Upcoming special elections in the next month		Changes from last ratings:	KY SD31: Tilt R to Tossup	LA HD18: Tossup to Lean D	PA HD114: Safe D to Likely D https://t.co/4kOrZb2PKp
Democratic former Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper will run for president in 2020
State Representative Fred Keller will be the Republican nominee for the special election in Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional District. He will face Democrat Marc Friedenberg on May 21
@JosephMouser Yes
The special election dates in North Carolina's 3rd Congressional District have been set. The primaries will be April 30. If runoffs are needed, they will take place on July 9 and the general election will be on September 10. Otherwise, the general election will be July 9
@JohnPlatner @Emptyset09 Yeah the second ct one hadn’t been declared at the time of the tweet
As a New Englander, THIS ⬇️ https://t.co/HQ5Wi1RJei
Full Results	Derek Slap (D): 5663 (63.9%) -1.9 HOLD	Bill Wadsworth (R): 3134 (35.4%) +1.2	Mark Greenstein (I): 39 (0.4%) +0.4	Jeffery Przech (I): 21 (0.3%) +0.3
Jumaane Williams has won the NYC public advocate election. Although this race is nonpartisan, Williams has run for past office as a Democrat
Interesting anecdote here which goes to show how much of an upset this was https://t.co/yqfeAYB9xB
Full Results	Joe Zullo (R): 1658 (54.1%) +12.3 GAIN 	Josh Balter (D): 1408 (45.9%) -12.3
@JJGomez127 yeah SD6 is the bad loss here
What makes matters worse for Democrats in the legislative special elections is that they don't even have a good pickup opportunity until April
In Connecticut Senate District 3, Democrat Saud Anwar has won to hold the seat for his party
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa Yeah fair point
FLIP ALERT: In Connecticut House District 99, Republican Joe Zullo has won to gain the seat for his party. Second gain of the night for the GOP, third of the year, although this one came in a Trump district
@Emptyset09 Nationwide
@SenhorRaposa Yeah he'll probably be example 856 of 'special elections don't indicate anything'
@baseballot @SenhorRaposa https://t.co/kGqVZo6dWl
@SenhorRaposa It's a stunning result. Bizzarro has overperformed in past races, but this wasn't at all expected
@baseballot Yes although it's way behind the spreadsheet I have going https://t.co/iyXgKOXUme
In Connecticut Senate District 5, Democrat Derek Slap has won to hold the seat for his party
FLIP ALERT: In Connecticut Senate District 6, Republican Gennaro Bizzarro has gained the seat for his party. Huge upset here. This is the GOP's 2nd legislative gain of 2019
If anyone has any results from any of these seats please send them. Only have HD39 so far
CT results, since SOS doesn't seem to have a page	https://t.co/cKFL0CZxCC
In Connecticut House District 39, Democrat Anthony Nolan has won to hold the seat for his party
@justingodfrey4 Nothing official, but I'll have a spreadsheet shortly
Special election previews for today: https://t.co/CC4M9ot38s
Mark Harris will not be running in the special election https://t.co/gRZQ7dnKvM
Adams seems to be a moderate Republican. Could probably have a chance in a runoff with Democratic support https://t.co/mCXkwPfoBQ
In Louisiana House District 17, Democrats Pat Moore and Rodney McFarland will advance to a runoff on March 30
Great result for Democrats here: Actually got a higher vote share than JBE did in 2015 https://t.co/etrFX24q0R
In Louisiana House District 62, Republican Dennis Aucoin and Independent Roy Adams will advance to a runoff on March 30
In Louisiana House District 18, Democrat Jeremy LaCombe and Republican Tammi Fabre will advance to a runoff on March 30
In Louisiana House District 26, Democrat Ed Larvadain has defeated a fellow party member in the special election. This is a Democratic hold
In Louisiana House District 47, Republican Ryan Borriaque has defeated a fellow party member in the special election. This is a Republican hold
In Louisiana House District 12, Republican Chris Turner has defeated a fellow party member in the special election. This is a Republican hold
Great results for incumbent parties so far in both competitive races. Let's see if it holds
In Louisiana House District 27, Republican Mike Johnson has won to hold the seat for his party
Special election previews for today: https://t.co/b2st4XTcjD
@wanderingpol Apparently didn’t want to face questioning from McCready’s lawyers
@wanderingpol Yeah although he’s fought it since then
At this moment, Democrat Dan McCready is probably the (very) slight favorite in the redo election. He’s raised a huge amount of money and this is a really big scandal that will hurt any GOP candidate, even if it’s not Harris https://t.co/kOVp4TFrus
BREAKING: In a unanimous vote the North Carolina Board of Elections has ordered a new election in North Carolina’s 9th Congressional District. Republican Mark Harris won by a .4% margin in an election which has since been marred by evidence of fraud
Last night in South Carolina House of Representatives District 14, Republican Stewart Jones and Democrat Garrett McDaniel won their respective primaries and will face off in a special election on April 23
@HelloJames8 I think it's very small but it's there. Regardless, it's not going to be enough to solve the GOP's issue of having to win Clinton districts
Thoughts on the Virginia election today:	-Ibraheem Samirah's win was definitely a major underperformance, but a lot of that is a result of Samirah's faults and are unique to this race. It's not a great result, but VA Dems are still favored in the House and Senate this November
Full Results from #HD86	Ibraheem Samirah (D): 3,738 (59.49%) -9.15%	Gregg Nelson (R): 2,162 (34.41%) +3.05%	Connie Haines Hutchinson (I): 370 (5.89%) +5.89%	Write-In: 13 (0.21%) +0.21%
In Virginia House of Delegates District 86, Democrat Ibraheem Samirah has won to hold the seat for his party

Republican US Representative Bradley Byrne of Alabama’s 1st Congressional District will run for the Senate seat held by Democrat Doug Jones in 2020. As a result, Byrne’s Southwestern Alabama house seat will be up for grabs

Upcoming special elections, 13 of which are coming in the next 10 days https://t.co/vPdj8FuSnd
@politicsluo Yeah although it’s been well known in Vermont that he’s running for awhile now
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020
There won’t be a Democratic convention as it turns out. 2018 candidate Marc Friedenberg is the only Democrat running and wins the nomination by default
Today former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld announced an exploratory committee to run in the 2020 Republican Presidential primary
In Florida House District 97, Democrat Dan Daley was the only candidate to file for an upcoming special election in June. As a result, the election will be canceled and Daley will become a State House member immediately. This is a Democratic hold
Full Results:	Fred Rangel (R): 2,319 (37.96%)	Ray Lopez (D): 1,186 (19.41%)	Coda Rayo-Garza (D): 1,164 (19.05%)	Art Reyna (D): 1,045 (17.10%)	Steve Huerta (D): 395 (6.46%)		Partisan Totals:	Democratic candidates: 3,810 (62%) +0.8%	Republican candidate: 2,319 (38%) +0.9%
In Texas House District 125, Republican Fred Rangel will advance to a runoff on a date TBA. With all ballots counted, It appears he will be joined by Democrat Ray Lopez, but Lopez's 22 vote lead over fellow Democrat Coda Rayo-Garcia is narrow enough that there could be a recount
Full Results:	Franklin Patten (R): 1,516 (43.13%)	James Burchett (R): 1,494 (42.50%)	Barbara Seidman (D): 361 (10.27%)	Barbara Griffin (D): 144 (4.10%)		Partisan totals	Republicans: 3010 (85.63%)	Democrats: 505 (14.37%)		Dems haven't contested recently but Trump won 66-34 in 2016
In Georgia House District 176, Republicans Franklin Patten and James Burchett will advance to a special election runoff on March 12. This is a GOP hold.

Upcoming special elections in the next 4 weeks https://t.co/P9N4KJWsN2
Full Results	Jason Rarick (R): 8,127 (52.0%) +6.6% FLIP 	Stu Lourey (D): 7,171 (45.9%) -8.7%	John "Sparky" Birrenbach (LMN): 298 (1.9%) +1.9%	Write-In: 27 (0.2%) +0.2%
One scary thing for legislative Democrats is that this is just the 1st of 4 seats in Trump districts they have to defend in the next two months. Certainly not an enviable hand they've been dealt, although they do have one prime pickup opportunity (PA SD37) in early April https://t.co/0YOxQF1ysJ
FLIP ALERT: In Minnesota Senate District 11, Republican Jason Rarick has won to gain the seat for his party. This is the 1st legislative special election gain for either party in 2019
Rarick extends it to 700. Favorable territory remains for Lourey in the last 25% of precincts but it looks like this will be a GOP flip
Now Rarick leads by 500 with 64% in. Definitely tilts his way, although there's a decent amount of Democratic precincts still out there
53% in now. Lourey (D) leads by 52. Still very close. Completely up in the air at the moment
@elium2 James McCanna
@elium2 He still wasn't the establishment pick I believe but that's a fair point
Very close right now, but I guess I'd rather be Rarick (R), who leads by 46 votes with 19% in
In Rhode Island House District 68, Democrat June Speakman has won the special Democratic primary. She will face 4 independents on March 5
In Georgia House District 5, Republican Matt Barton has defeated a fellow party member in an upset special election runoff result. This is a Republican hold
Polls have closed in the big race in Minnesota
The State of The Union will be the most covered event tonight, but there are also two special elections today: https://t.co/cYG6YHdNL0
@MichaelCasey_ It could limit their losses, but it's still a really tough map
Technically, Justin Fairfax hasn’t either, but he’s honestly the only person who has something to lose by calling for resignation
Fast forward to now and all but Saslaw have called for Northam’s resignation. Bizarre press conference not doing him any favors https://t.co/nDKBWcBiKS
@Lurker1387 https://t.co/Fy61ZvV5mo

Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey will run in the Democratic primary for president in 2020
Full Results	Art Fierro (D): 2,514 (53.35%) 	Mike Noe (D): 1,256 (26.65%)	Hans Sassenfeld (R): 943 (20.00%)		Partisan Totals	Democrats: 3,770 (80.00%)	Republican: 943 (20.00%)		No swing data as Republicans haven't contested recently, but Hillary Clinton won 67-27 in this district
In Texas House District 79, Democrat Art Fierro has won a special election outright with over 50% of the vote. This is a Democratic hold
Partisan Results	Democrats: 2,512 (73.9%)	Republican: 872 (25.2%)	Libertarian: 33 (0.9%)		Republicans haven't contested this seat recently enough to do a local swing calculation, but Hillary Clinton won here 67-29

In Texas House District 145, Democrats Christina Morales and Melissa Noriega will advance to a special election runoff to be held at some point in March, securing a Democratic hold
Fierro (D) leads with just over 50% in #HD79 early votes. Noe (D) in second

Also today, Democratic Governor of Washington Jay Inslee is reportedly running for President. This would creating a Gubernatorial opening in Washington in 2020
The seat went to Trump 60-37 so it will likely stay red in 2020, but the retirement is still very notable as Jones is the most liberal Republican in the House

@_Political_Nerd @_BlueGeorgia_ @politicsluo Turnout does seem abysmal there and Barrow is underperforming. I think it will be within 4 either way
Barrow isn't going to gain or lose significantly in the rurals it appears. Cities and suburbs will be the key
@mcimaps Yeah of course. Should've said in the case of even turnout
Barrow needs to overperform by about 1-2 statewide https://t.co/1vw692IYSh
Piece of good news for Barrow as he overperforms in Clay County by 2
Barrow underperforms Abrams by 10 in the first county to fully report, Webster County. Things still don't look great for him at the moment

In Mississippi House District 85, Democrat Jeffery Harness has defeated fellow party member Joann Collins-Smith in a special election runoff. This is a Democratic hold

@RRHElections What about the legislative races?
@Mariametz8 @_Political_Nerd It's over. Espy doesn't have a path
In Mississippi, Incumbent Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith has won the special election for US Senate
FWIW I had modeled this as 54.06%-45.94% in favor of Hyde-Smith. Looks like the final result could be in that region
A few counties reporting now and Espy consistently beating his 11/6 totals by 5-7 votes. Consistent with a 3-5 point Hyde-Smith win
I still think this will be a narrow win for Hyde-Smith
@faithandworks29 The county is 48% black

About an hour ago, Democrat Susan Wild was sworn in to represent the old #PA15. She will serve this district for the rest of 2018, before representing the new #PA07 in 2019 and 2020. The 115th Congress now stands at 236 Republicans and 196 Democrats, with 3 vacancies https://t.co/BJM2M38CkU

What do you expect in Mississippi tonight?
@andrew_striedl Really really hard to see that happening. He has been consistently losing points since election night
@andrew_striedl Yeah but it’s clearly over. They’ll still be counting by the time early voting starts in 2020 at this rate
Mississippi Senate and legislative previews: https://t.co/gxfBGx36JG
FLIP ALERT: In California's 21st Congressional District, Democrat TJ Cox appears to have won in a shocking upset to defeat incumbent David Valadao. Cox's win is the 43rd and final (40th net) Democratic pickup of the midterms, and pushes the House to 235-200 for the 116th Congress
@kdbug25 60-40 I believe. But typically black voters are only 30% of the electorate
Goes to show the polarization of Mississippi. Espy gets 98% of black voters but just 15% of white voters. Neither candidate seems to really be expanding on their base, so it really is all about turnout https://t.co/CxvkNHyTgb
Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!!!!
@andrew_striedl Wouldn’t be shocked if the Mississippi runoff is completed before they finish counting

@TheAlextrifier I would say it's Lean/Likely D at the local level. Scott is the only statewide elected Republican at this point
@TheAlextrifier Vermont often elects moderate Republicans to statewide office, despite being solid blue at presidential level

@UWEair She was 2017 though
All 3 were the kind of seats Dems would’ve flipped anyway. Just goes to show how special elections can produce unusual results that don’t hold

Have continued updating on Medium but kind of forgot about this thread. Through August 2 in terms of Senate elections and the first 2 gains have showed up (1/2)
@wilks_isaac @savedemocracy18 The question was about flips in 2018
@savedemocracy18 It’s all about turnout. Democrats are picking up ground in areas with typically high midterm turnout but struggling in the inverse cases
@savedemocracy18 Plus Conor Lamb for Congress
@savedemocracy18 9
Regardless, this was the last election before the midterms, but in the meantime I’ll be starting to work on some individual state previews and a model
One thing I think can be taken from this result and other 2018 special elections: Democrats are falling flat in many largely Hispanic areas won by Clinton, while making massive gains in upper middle class suburban Clinton districts https://t.co/eZ9b98IlMg
FLIP ALERT: In Texas Senate District 19, Republican Pete Flores has won in a surprising upset. This is the 3rd legislative gain made by the GOP in elections in 2018
I think it's over, but waiting to see what Bexar precincts are left before I call it
@nebhusker84 I wouldn't draw statewide conclusions from a low turnout special election
End of the day, this special election will come down to e-day turnout levels in Bexar (Dem base) and Medina (GOP base)
Results looking better and better for Flores here. Bit of a surprise and a major setback for Texas Democrats if the results hold
@marinerfanmatt It's very low turnout, but certainly a slightly good sign for Hurd
Everything still pointing to a close race, but high GOP turnout so far tilts scale towards Flores
The closeness of this race is partially because of high GOP spending, but it's also worth pointing out that Pete Gallego might have not been popular enough with the Democratic primary. He finished significantly behind Roland Gutierrez in the first round of voting in Bexar County
Early results indicating a close contest in SD19. Maybe a slight edge to Flores if anything, but too early to tell with no election day vote yet
@Rocket_CoffeeCo Always better when that isn't happening https://t.co/0Vfl8WeiYT
@Rocket_CoffeeCo “Nonpartisan twitter updates, specifically focusing on elections” doesn’t bind me from giving election opinions. My entire point is just that Bredesen is a better path to victory for the Democrats than O’Rourke.
@Rocket_CoffeeCo Please explain how anything in that tweet is biased. I never said anything about who I want to win
Polls are about to close in Texas Senate District 19 in 2018’s final legislative special election before the midterms. Difficult but fairly manageable defense for Democratic candidate Pete Gallego against Republican Pete Flores
@DWSalts Bredesen isn't that left all, and given post-primary poll results, he's got a very good shot
This poll should be a reminder that defeating Cruz is very unlikely, while Phil Bredesen is arguably favored (I would say he is) in Tennessee. Every cent the Democrats put in Texas should be going to Tennessee https://t.co/Ojg7rWiIyq
@politicsluo Probably TJ Donovan in Vermont
Andrew Gillum might end up carrying Bill Nelson, which would have seemed to be a crazy statement a month ago https://t.co/TkzyqXTlFw

In New York Senate District 31, Robert Jackson has won the Democratic primary, defeating incumbent IDC member Marisol Alcantara, who had served in the Senate since 2017
@tub_e_o That's what did it for me. Her winning Suffolk and Nassau by decent margins was surprising
@tub_e_o Is it though? Maloney and Teachout are splitting the vote way too much for one of them to emerge
Diane Savino survives easily in Senate District 23, but all 7 other IDC members currently are trailing https://t.co/zWHZFqjsfU

Super early results (&lt;450 votes) have incumbent Rep. Stephen Lynch leading challenger Brianna Wu 55-40.
Super early results (less than 700 votes) have incumbent Rep. Richard Neal leading left-wing challenger Tahirah Amatul-Wadud just 54-46.
Some votes for statewide races so far, but nothing from Congressional districts yet (according to the NYT).
First votes out of Massachusetts, from Middlesex County. Less than 100 votes, though.

Former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has won the Democratic primary in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District
In Arizona's 9th Congressional District, Steve Ferrara has won the Republican primary and will face Democrat Greg Stanton in November. Stanton is favored in this Democratic defense
In Arizona, Democrat David Garcia will face incumbent Republican Governor Doug Ducey in November
In Arizona, Republican Martha McSally and Democrat Kyrsten Sinema will face off in November for Jeff Flake's open Senate seat. It should be a competitive general election, with both sides fielding experienced Congresswomen

In Florida's open 6th Congressional district, Democrat Nancy Soderberg and Republican Michael Waltz will advance to general election, where Waltz will be favored
In Florida's 5th Congressional District, Incumbent Al Lawson is another Democratic incumbent to fend off a tough primary challenge to move on to an easy November defense
Two more primary winners in outside Democratic Congressional targets in Florida. In the 16th District, David Shapiro will face Vern Buchanan and in the 26th District, Debbie Muscarel-Powell will face Carlos Curbelo
Kevin Stitt has won the Republican runoff for Governor of Oklahoma. He will face Democrat Drew Edmondson in a fairly competitive general election
In Florida's open 17th Congressional District, Democrat April Freeman and Republican Greg Steube will face off in November. Steube is the favorite in that matchup
In the open 15th Congressional District in Florida, Republican Ross Spano and Democrat Kristen Carlson have won their respective primaries. Spano will be favored to hold the seat in November

@Cat19Green Yes it’s over
Andrew Gillum has won the Democratic primary for Governor of Florida
Gillum has just taken the lead in Florida. Major upset looking very possible here
In Florida’s 9th Congressional District, Incumbent Darren Soto has easily fended off a challenge from former Representative Alan Grayson in the Democratic primary
Andrew Gillum running surprisingly close to Gwen Graham on the Democratic side https://t.co/kJgCSPFf50

@TheAlextrifier Yeah it really is. They have a few in the state legislature actually
That's it for me tonight, but here's one more thing to keep an eye on: The 2 Alaska State House Republicans who caucus with Democrats, Gabrielle LeDoux and Louise Stutes, are both narrowly winning their primaries. The primary results could decide future control of the chamber
Independent candidate Alyse Galvin has won the Democratic primary for Alaska's at large Congressional district. She will face longtime Republican incumbent Don Young in November
In Alaska, Mike Dunleavy has won the Republican Gubernatorial primary, entering into a three-way contest between him, Democrat Mark Begich and Incumbent Independent Bill Walker
@DWSalts 6% or 7,000 votes

@DWSalts Very moderate establishment Republican
In Wyoming, Mark Gordon has won the Republican primary for Governor. He will be heavily favored against Democrat Mary Throne in November
One thing I'm curious about is whether moderate Democrats and Independents crossed over because of concerns about the conservative stances of Fraser Friess. Could have been enough to push the election towards Mark Gordon https://t.co/Bibz7Va3v9

@DWSalts He probably will
In Connecticut's 5th Congressional District, Democrat Jahana Hayes and Republican Manny Santos will advance to the general election for this open leaning Democratic district
@andrew_striedl The only concern Scott should be taking from this is the potential for some of these rural voters not turning out in November. Everyone except the niche gun control crowd is clearly still with him
@SenhorRaposa Also anyone has seen a debate between the two could tell that Stern was a weak candidate. Half the debate was Scott explaining to him what the Governor's powers were
Said this before and will say it again: Christine Hallquist is way more dangerous to Phil Scott than Keith Stern ever was
@andrew_striedl Read my mind there https://t.co/lLZLugPz04
Most people involved in VT politics would have said Scott was fine. Bit of an outside media freakout imo https://t.co/zVTjXdD6PO
@DWSalts @DagnyDelinquent It's almost a case of face a stronger primary challenge or face a stronger general election candidate however
In Vermont, Christine Hallquist has won the Democratic primary for Governor. She will be the first transgender major party Gubernatorial nominee in history and will face Phil Scott in November
@YashaKharrati Fwiw none of this is surprising to people involved in VT politics. General consensus was Scott between 60-65%
In Vermont, Incumbent Phil Scott has won the Republican primary for Governor despite a minor scare from Keith Stern
@andrew_striedl Yeah he's had it ever since he started winning in the rural north
In Kansas, Jeff Colyer has officially conceded to Kris Kobach, meaning Kobach will be the Republican nominee for governor. He will face Democrat Laura Kelly and Independent Greg Orman in November
In Connecticut, Matthew Corey has won the Republican primary for US Senate. He will be a heavy underdog to incumbent Chris Murphy in November
@SenhorRaposa Yep. Stern clearly didn't make it out of the Windsor/Rutland/Bennington area with name id
In Connecticut, Ned Lamont has won the Democratic primary for Governor
Phil Scott winning towns in the rural Northeast Kingdom, which backed Donald Trump, now. He's got this
@numanmyname Kornheiser is more progressive than Stuart. Endorsed by Our Revolution. Local people aren't surprised by the result
Brattleboro and Bennington, Southern Vermont's two largest towns, both come in. Scott wins Brattleboro but Republican turnout low, while Stern wins Bennington. While Stern's win is big there, he's getting some really bad results in the Burlington and Montpelier areas
Kornheiser, a community activist, just blew incumbent Valerie Stuart out of the water with 72% of the vote in this Brattleboro district https://t.co/S3kJs2WKKU
@AsInMarx @Polit_eur Scott should honestly become an independent
@Polit_eur I hope he wins the primary. If he loses it's a massive discouragement to politicians considering taking brave stances
@Polit_eur It's coming from some Democrats too based on primary vote %
St. Johnsbury is the first large community to report and it backs Scott and Hallquist significantly. Good news for both of them, especially Scott as it points to a positive trend in the larger towns and Burlington suburbs
@Polit_eur He could win Franklin. But big story should be that a complete nobody is probably going to end up winning counties against him
Phil Scott is going to need Burlington, Montpelier, and Brattleboro to come through for him tonight. I think they will
@Polit_eur Yeah Rutland County going about how I thought. Good news for Scott is that he's leading without a major town reporting yet
Two towns reporting in Vermont. Phil Scott loses the small rural town of Wells by 5 votes. Could see him lose a lot of similar places
Polls have closed in Vermont!

@DWSalts Sure not that many people moved to Vermont. But enough did to make a difference in such a blue state
@DWSalts Young people moving there more than counterbalanced the effect. Also lots of MA conservatives moved to New Hampshire
@DWSalts Basically lots of people moved from Boston and New York, which caused higher Democratic voter percentages, while many longtime residents embraced populist Democrats. Longtime residents are probably very close to 50/50 as a group
@Jasonwaldvogel1 Oops forgot to say Gubernatorial in there

This has amazed me. Vermont is about to elect the first transgender major party nominee in the country’s history and nobody is taking about it https://t.co/xfOJHDRF2R
Since I’ve been tagged in this: Hallquist will almost definitely win unless Ehlers gets a big result in Chittenden https://t.co/SjNaUuEbk5
@Polit_eur I think Hallquist will probably be in that range. Scott could be anywhere from 55-70 imo
@Polit_eur You disagree?
@YayySports Green = Brenda Siegel meant to say that
Objectively it's not Vermont but I'm definitely going to talk about it as if it is https://t.co/waWhwyHeqc
@DWSalts Democratic easily. But voting in the Democratic primary doesn't mean people won't vote for Phil Scott, especially if their candidate doesn't win
These county maps would likely equal a 65-35 Scott win and a 55% vote share for Hallquist btw
On the Republican side, Blue=Incumbent Gov. Phil Scott and Red=Keith Stern https://t.co/gmuNrIENHj

In Hawaii’s 1st Congressional, Ed Case has won the Democratic primary
Late last night in Hawaii, incumbent Governor David Ige fended off a strong Democratic Primary challenge from Colleen Hanabusa
@UWEair He probably will if Peter Welch doesn’t run
@TheSecretsSafe They are quite fantastic
@UWEair Donovan is the best bet probably, but I’d add State Senators Becca Balint and Tim Ashe and maybe LG David Zuckerman. Leahy’s plans for 2022 will have a big effect as well
As a Vermonter, I’d put this at 10% odds. His opponent, Keith Stern, has no name id. 72% of the state don’t know who he is. Stern could win several rural areas, but the 3 large strongly liberal counties in the state will probably come through for Scott https://t.co/RUHJawiJ8g
In case anyone wonders why I tend to say “barring a tabulation error” when calling close races https://t.co/ofIzOUtCxD
@DWSalts He’s a Vermont Republican of recent years. Socially liberal while economically conservative
@DWSalts Yeah although there is still a Republican governor here
Just voted early in Vermont. Was the 291st voter at my fairly large precinct
@JynxJ1337 I think it’s likely to stay R but maybe an outside shot of turning blue

@UWEair Which one is that?
@joepetz Can’t disagree with that. Tends to view trends and then propel them forward
@iamdarylleon @dankildee @electbizon2018 @DebDingell @BrendaLLawrence @repcleaver @ellis4missouri @DrKimSchrier Bizon won. Kildee and Dingell were unopposed. Schrier is leading and Eicholz lost
@iamdarylleon @dankildee @electbizon2018 @DebDingell @BrendaLLawrence @repcleaver @ellis4missouri @DrKimSchrier Lawrence, Cleaver, and Ellis were unopposed. Let me check the rest
I think he’s referring to primary endorsements here, which brings me to once again point out that Luther Strange is the last candidate endorsed by Trump to lose his primary https://t.co/6TtJ4WFExU
@wbaker18 All 3 are tossups with Kobach at the top of the ticket
In Michigan’s 13th Congressional district, Brenda Jones appears to have won the Democratic special election primary. She came second to Rashida Tlaib in the general election primary, which means she will serve in Congress for about six weeks
Also this morning, apparently Chris Collins, the Republican US Representative for New York’s 27th Congressional District, has been arrested by the FBI this morning. Could prove a real headache for the GOP if he doesn’t drop out
In Kansas’s 3rd Congressional District, Sharice Davids has won the Democratic primary
With 100% reporting In Kansas, Kris Kobach appears to have won the Republican primary for Governor by 191 votes
Looks like we won't know who has won in #KS03, the KS gubernatorial race, and the #MI13 special election primary for a while. I'm off to bed but will try to update those in the morning
@DWSalts 45K-35K in favor of the Democrats in terms of primary ballots cast

@niles_francis This is for the November election, but the result will likely be the same in the special election
In Michigan's 13th Congressional District, Rashida Tlaib has won the Democratic primary for this vacant seat
The Wikipedia page on the candidate who is currently second in Washington's 2nd Congressional District is something else:	https://t.co/JPvTTQg5Ro
@TowersTowers5 I don't doubt we could get into recount territory. But not close enough territory that a recount could change the result
@TowersTowers5 I was watching MSNBC when he said that and the way I interpreted that is that 5,000 absentee ballots haven't been returned. Realistically many of those won't have been postmarked by today in time to qualify
@TowersTowers5 Where are you getting that number?
In Michigan's 9th Congressional District, Democrat Andy Levin has won his primary for the open seat held by his father Sandy. He will face Republican Candius Stearns in November
@TowersTowers5 It's not going to be enough to overcome the margin
The Kansas Republican Gubernatorial primary might end up being closer than the special election
@nebhusker84 It's insanely close. Kobach leads by .3% with 73% in
@ASauer8 He's down .3% with 70% in
Something to note from Washington so far: Republicans are currently under 50% in 3 districts they hold: #WA03, #WA05, and #WA08. Could change as more votes come in
In Washington, Incumbent Democrat Maria Cantwell and Republican Susan Hutchinson advance out of the jungle primary
In Kansas's 2nd Congressional District, Republican Steve Watkins has won his party's primary and will face Democrat Paul Davis in a potentially competitive general election for this open red district
@sfor4th I have a hunch it could go to a recount, but 0.5% is still a nearly impossible margin to overturn in a recount

@Decision_Desk So according to you David Wasserman, a nationally recognized election reporter, doesn't know anything since he called the race before I did
@DetroitMisery1 @EricLacy 3% of precincts equals a way higher % of votes. It's over
@Decision_Desk It's not but think what you want
@Decision_Desk Because it's clearly over and nobody is going to base their votes off of what a twitter account with 1500 followers says
In Missouri, no surprise as incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Josh Hawley win their respective primaries for US Senate
Gubernatorial race
In Michigan, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer and Republican Bill Schuette have won their respective primaries and will face off in November
Btw this was the model's final prediction for today:	Troy Balderson (R): 50.59% (Hold) (-0.58)	Danny O'Connor (D): 47.73% (+0.43)	Joe Machnik (G): 1.67 (+0.15)

Just because I'm bored...give me an office/district and I'll tell you who I think will hold that office/district at the start of 2019
@marcusedelstein @SenhorRaposa This is the only correct answer
RT @marcusedelstein: @electionwatchus @SenhorRaposa Jeb by 50+
@Luky173 Yes but there’s likely a big crossover between people who are undecided in the election and people who are undecided about one of the most polarizing election issues
@emperorga79 Yeah it’ll be very competitive imo if O’Connor wins the special
@SenhorRaposa It’s very possible. I think it’s going to be very close either way. The big unknown is how Trump’s rally changes the picture
My money would probably be on Balderson by 0-2
What do you think the results of the #OH12 special election will be?
@emperorga79 I think he’s favored but Dean winning isn’t entirely impossible
@emperorga79 He votes with Trump more than any other Democrat, however
@Kyle_Whitlatch @MSMollinedo Exactly
@MSMollinedo I think they mean lean, as in they are more likely to vote for O'Connor
@samwilkinson Potentially. I'll probably do one more update tomorrow morning, especially considering there could be another poll today
This might be the most important part of the Emerson poll in #OH12. Working this into the model now https://t.co/cnqJrgYruQ
@TheAlextrifier All one can really do, right?
Potentially the final update from #OH12	Balderson (R): 51.17% (Hold) (-0.48)	O'Connor (D): 47.30% (+0.52)	Machnik (G): 1.53% (-0.04)		O'Connor still making up ground, but could be short on time. No polling data post-rally, which does bother me a bit
@iamdarylleon Cooper was unopposed, and Stotts Pearson appears to have narrowly won
@numanmyname Not sure about that. Black’s biggest rival was Randy Boyd, who isn’t a member of Congress
He defeats incumbent Tim Wirgau, who had represented the district since 2011 https://t.co/TCNyEjmmUw

In Tennessee’s 8th Congressional District, Incumbent David Kustoff has  fended off a challenge to win the Republican primary
In the open 6th Congressional District in Tennessee, Democrat Dawn Barlow and Republican John Rose have won their respective primaries
In the open 2nd Congressional District in Tennessee, Democrat Renee Hoyos and Republican Tim Burchett have won their respective primaries
@Patriot_Pat1 @JMilesColeman https://t.co/8baKzYJ0bM
What has happened in Tennessee with Bill Lee's upset primary win is the same as what happened with Mike Braun's primary win in Indiana. Two favorites went at each other hard, allowing room for a lesser known candidate to sneak up the middle
Bill Lee has won the Republican primary for Governor of Tennessee
@Twostepmike I think it makes sense for in-state elections. But the fact that people's lives are directly effected by the results of elections across the country is a bit weird. But no way around it I suppose
@Twostepmike He could win, but it's not incredibly likely. However, Bredesen's strong candidacy will make a lot more races competitive so there could be a coattails effect
Karl Dean has won the Democratic primary for Governor of Tennessee
No surprise in Tennessee as Democrat Phil Bredesen and Republican Marsha Blackburn will face off in November for US Senate
Tennessee Primary Previews:	https://t.co/Lgl0QTyWkT
@DWSalts He has voted the same way as Pelosi just 60% of the time, which will help his credibility with moderate Republicans. I think you're underestimating his favorability in the area
@DWSalts Two ways to look at it	1) Turnout will be lower among Republicans, so could be fewer Lamb-Trump voters than expected	2) Some Trump votes from longtime registered Democrats were more rebukes of Clinton than anything else and they are ok with moderate Democrats like Lamb
Two new races to add:	Nebraska US Senate	Deb Fischer (R): 67.50% (Hold)	Jane Raybloud (D): 31.61%	Others: 0.89%	Margin of Error: High		Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District	Conor Lamb (D): 54.08% (Gain)	Keith Rothus (R): 44.95%	Others: 0.97%	Margin of Error: Medium
Have to agree for the most part here.  Winning side gets a moral boost and good base for fundraising emails. Also, O’Connor has a shot in November if he’s an incumbent. But compared to other special elections we’ve seen, the impact here is small https://t.co/V0FikmrxKP
2 updates. Will release some new races tonight	#OH12	Balderson (R): 51.66% (Hold) (-0.58)**	O'Connor (D): 46.77% (+0.76)	Machnik (G): 1.57% (-0.18)		Texas US Senate	Cruz (R): 55.87% (Hold) (-0.03)	O'Rourke (D): 43.31% (+0.55)	Others: 1.36% (-0.53)
@Polit_eur I think his fate could come down to hispanic turnout in San Antonio
Big talking point with this race has been what it means for Will Hurd's defense in #TX23. Numbers aren't great for him, but he's a strong enough candidate that he still could survive
In Mississippi House District 77, Republican Price Wallace has narrowly defeated a fellow party member in a special election runoff. This is a Republican hold.
@UWEair We're looking at 5-10% turnout here by my estimate
Partisan Vote Totals with swings from 2016 State Senate Race	Democratic Candidates: 15,473 (59.3%) +3.4%	Republican Candidates: 10,333 (39.7%) -0.7%	Libertarian Candidate: 271 (1.0%) -2.7%
Totals:	Pete Flores (R): 8,965 (34.37%)	Pete Gallego (D): 7,541 (28.91%)	Roland Gutierrez (D): 6,351 (24.35%)	Carlos Antonio Raymond (R): 912 (3.49%)	Thomas Uresti (D): 798 (3.06%)	Charlie Urbina Jones (D): 783 (3.00%)	Jesse Alaniz (R): 456 (1.74%)	Tony Valdivia (L): 271 (1.03%)
In Texas Senate District 19, Republican Pete Flores and Democrat Pete Gallego will advance to a runoff at some point this fall

Looks pretty clear we'll be heading to a runoff in Texas Senate District 19 between some combination of Democrat Pete Gallego, Democrat Roland Gutierrez, and Republican Pete Flores
Special election previews for tonight: https://t.co/2kdFU9vAY1
@DWSalts It's probably not. Riggleman is capable of losing but I don't think Cockburn is capable of winning
Both candidates have major flaws and it's just an absolute mess. But according some people conventions give you better candidates than primaries
Virginia's 5th Congressional District is such a weird race
@DWSalts An indictment would be by a jury tho I honestly don't think he'd be convicted. Menendez and McDonnell set a precedent there
@UWEair @AnyDem2020 Yeah, they probably could've recruited better for the primary
@AnyDem2020 Yeah we'll see how it plays out. I'd say the odds are still decent for Hunter winning the election but much lower for him still being a congressman this time next year
@AnyDem2020 Yeah I think a Bernie endorsement would help shore up the base. Not convinced on Campa-Najjar's ability to flip moderates however
One interesting question that could unfold: If Hunter gets indicted, can he still survive the general? My gut tells me yes, but it's probably borderline https://t.co/hA8OgZMaAb
@Polit_eur Don't disagree. I think it will swing towards him as more polls come in
@TrendyHendy89 Big problem for O'Connor is polling data. He's hasn't led in any poll, although he's still gaining ground. What does help him is early voting data. More polling will change the model probably
One new race and one update:	Idaho Governor	Brad Little (R): 53.71% (Hold)	Paulette Jordan (D): 40.60%	Others: 5.69%	Margin of Error: High		Update from #OH12	Balderson (R): 52.24% (Hold) (-0.15)	O'Connor (D): 46.01% (+0.67)	Machnik (G): 1.75% (-0.52)	Margin of Error: Medium
Scott should win the primary, but his low approval among Republicans prove costly if a more conservative third party candidate runs. It's Likely R imo, but I think the Democratic candidate (especially if it's Christine Hallquist) winning a narrow plurality is not impossible https://t.co/UijK8tLIID
On the Republican side, Phil Scott. On the Democratic side, Roy Cooper https://t.co/CY0avn7b2Z
Geoff Duncan has narrowly won the Republican Runoff for Lieutenant Governor of Georgia
@Silly_GOP_ The NYT/AP had a massive tabulation error
@Silly_GOP_ Decision Desk has her up 6% with 94% in
In Georgia's 6th Congressional District, Lucy McBath has won the Democratic runoff
*Bourdeaux that is. Been a rough last 10 minutes
Can call a different race however. In Georgia's 7th Congressional District, Carolyn Bordeaux appears to have won the Democratic runoff barring something unexpected
Thanks to everyone who pointed it out
Sorry about the incorrect tweet re: Kevin Abel in #GA06. NYT/AP counts had a massive tabulation error
@haydenrobinsonn Oh ok
@haydenrobinsonn I think it's just way behind
@haydenrobinsonn Mostly yeah. Is there another source with different results?
All 3 remaining Georgia races are tight ones:	In CD6 (D), Kevin Abel leads Lucy McBath 50.9%-40.1% with 46% in	In CD7 (D), David Kim leads Carolyn Bordeaux 52.1%-47.9% with 44% in	In Lt. Gov (R), Geoff Duncan leads David Shafer 50.3%-49.7% with 74% in
He defeats incumbent Paulette Rakestraw, who had held the seat since 2010 https://t.co/RB06IzkCyp
@mjk1093 I suppose gain would also work
@Cat19Green Can't say I know that much about it
@DWSalts I think he'd be better served campaigning in Tennessee, North Dakota, and Indiana to ensure the Republicans hold the Senate. But yes, PA01 is Clinton +1
@madisonvking No the former PA-3 was Trump +26 https://t.co/Xzyjd2Ckml
@DWSalts Conor Lamb won a district which Trump won by around 20 points. Yes the special election turnout is a factor, but his moderate views definitely allow for a lot of crossover vote. The inverse on the Republican side would be Brian Fitzpatrick
@Cat19Green Probably not, but Abrams has a legitimate shot against Kemp, which she didn't have against Cagle
@madisonvking Yes it's Trump +20 according to NY Times
@mjk1093 For technical purposes, the new PA-14 has been considered a Democratic held district, while the new PA-17 has been considered a Republican held district. So based on that, yes it still is a flip
@madisonvking The current PA-16 is Trump +8. It is now the Trump +26 District 11.
Brian Kemp had been endorsed by Donald Trump. If I'm not mistaken, the last time he endorsed the losing candidate in a primary was Luther Strange last September. He clearly controls the party at this point
@madisonvking Suppose it's possible, but not at all likely. It's still Trump +20
Secretary of State Brian Kemp has won the Republican runoff for Governor of Georgia. He will face Democrat Stacey Abrams in November
Doesn't surprise me at all. I've been saying for a while PA17 is the 3rd most likely district in PA to flip (after 5 and 6) https://t.co/npAsMQyZrV
Early results look really good for Brian Kemp in the Republican runoff for Governor of Georgia

All of these questions and they couldn't fit in one about the Democratic primary for Governor smh. However, favorability numbers do nothing to change my opinion that Phil Scott likely beats Christine Hallquist by a margin of 55-45 in November https://t.co/kyiGanmPQs

@politicsluo How about KS-02 and KS-03?
Incumbent Steve Marshall has won the Republican runoff for Alabama Attorney General
In Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, Incumbent Republican Martha Roby has easily fended off a challenge from Bobby Bright in a primary runoff
@DWSalts Yeah he did about 2 weeks ago. Bright was very conservative when he was in congress but the Pelosi vote really hurt him
In addition to Roby's overperformance so far, the establishment will also like the strong lead incumbent Attorney General Steve Marshall has over Troy King
@DWSalts Yes but McConnell convinced Trump to endorse Roby and Bright is a former Democrat who had voted for Pelosi as speaker. That pushed a lot of pro-Trump voters away from him
RT @politicsluo: Bright is gonna need a monstrous margin in Dale to have even a shot at beating Roby. Dale is yet to report. #AL02
@UWEair Yeah that criticism and Trump's endorsement of Roby killed him
This race is seeming less and less like it will even become close
@AbrasiveObelisk Many Alabama voters were once Democrats. I think what helps Roby more is Trump's endorsement
In the limited vote totals we have so far from Alabama's 2nd District, Incumbent Martha Roby has a surprisingly big lead over Bobby Bright
Previews for the Alabama primary runoffs. Special thanks to Chris Luongo (@politicsluo) for writing up the AL-02 preview: https://t.co/ovOjrCZzsB
@deefromfranklin They need committees with more younger reps to deal with social media issues
@DWSalts I think they can at least do a fine job in committee on a lot of issues in terms of mostly asking the right questions. This is now the second Facebook hearing where many representatives don't seem to understand the internet
Have to say, watching Congress in meetings regarding social media is really painful
@Decision_Desk Does he though? You need a lot of Democrats to transfer over and if it gets bad enough the Democrats will replace Menendez. As for McCormick, she had no funding. Any serious Democratic challenger beats Menendez
@DGiant @LikeIGive_Adam Hugin is honestly not a great nominee. That's a quiet truth in the entire story. Menendez would be in more trouble if someone like Frank LoBiondo had run
@DGiant @LikeIGive_Adam Yeah. I think Trump's actions will hurt 95% of Republicans in competitive races. But this race becomes the exception if it becomes about Menendez's actions. Don't get me wrong tho, Bob Hugin will not be a US Senator. He just could come surprisingly close to being one
@LikeIGive_Adam Yeah I commented on the poor sampling. Even so it's a bit closer than people had thought
@SenhorRaposa @politicsluo 1) Nice	2) Bit surprised the % isn't higher
@tbone9070 Yeah no that’s fair. I should’ve double checked but I remembered it as an acquittal for some reason
@tbone9070 Ok my bad, but it was still 10-2 in favor of acquitting him. Regardless, my point is really that the SCOTUS ruling on McDonnell is the reason Menendez and others won't get convicted. I think that was a bad ruling personally, but with it in place he will never get convicted
@UWEair @MSMollinedo I think they'll spend the money if it got to a point where it was one of the races that decides control. But I doubt we get to that point
@mjk1093 Technically it's a Gravis poll, but Breitbart controls the rights to the release data
@MSMollinedo I think they didn't realize how truly vulnerable he is. I would argue that he is less safe than a few red state dems
@tbone9070 Menendez was prosecuted by the US government and acquitted. Blame the SCOTUS for their ruling on McDonnell
@DWSalts We kinda should be close to that at the very least, yeah
Also, Gravis has been known for some very bad polls, such as this one:	https://t.co/ctdgWxutOX
@MSMollinedo Yeah was just diving into it a little more. I'd still say Democrats are spending money on this race that they shouldn't have to
Ok...further examination on the poll says a lot. The sample is just Clinton +2 in a state which she won by 14. This seems to be consistent with a realistic 10 point win for Menendez, but Democrats will have to spend money they shouldn't have to on this race
I think Menendez will still win but wow...the Democrats made a huge mistake by not recruiting a primary challenger https://t.co/LUa9IFFcwK

Republican Michael Cloud was sworn in to the House of Representatives today after his special election victory in Texas's 27th District. The chamber now stands at 236 Republicans, 193 Democrats, and 6 vacancies. Only one of these vacancies will be filled before November https://t.co/d0oseaZL2R
@DWSalts Yeah it's too high. That's why I put the MoE as high. I trust the model to get it right by the fall, but right now it's still too early for some of these races. Any incumbent that's already behind in the model is in big trouble imo
@DWSalts Yeah, I like the numbers for Governor, but I think Senate is too affected by incumbency right now. It will probably narrow to about 55-45 once people know start to know who Renacci is. 50% of voters didn't have an opinion on him in a recent poll
Model's take on Ohio's elections:	Senate	Sherrod Brown (D): 60.10% (Hold)	Jim Renacci (R): 39.03%	Others: 0.87%	Margin of Error: High		Governor	Mark DeWine (R): 51.66%	Richard Cordray (D): 46.30%	Others: 2.04%	Margin of Error: Medium
In Mississippi House District 77, Republicans Hayes Patrick and Price Wallace have advanced to a July 31 runoff in this officially nonpartisan special election. The winner will take over for the remaining two years of the term for this Republican-held seat
By far one of the most interesting election articles I've read in a long time: https://t.co/RyTRabgUns
@fishercutbait Sure, so it's basically all about weighting different factors and combining them into percents 		Factors in order of weight:	Poll average	Candidate favorability	Polls in last week	Trump approval	Party approval	Incumbency advantage	Trump/Clinton	Last similar election	Obama/Romney
@AndrewSoboeiro Probably will narrow in the future once more people get to know and develop opinions on O'Rourke, but have to say it's kind of hard to see a path for him right now
@DWSalts Yeah working on Ohio Sen and Gov right now actually. Interesting to see how the model deals with somewhat popular incumbent vs. Trump support. As for Montana, I'm going to basically post things in order of primary election date, so it shouldn't be all that long
Keep in mind that all of these are for if the election was held today and will start out with a slight favoritism of incumbency. Feel free to shoot me any questions you have on things like methodology
Illinois Governor	J.B. Pritzker (D): 50.29% (Gain)	Bruce Rauner (R): 45.62%	Others: 4.09%	Margin of error: High
Texas Governor	Greg Abbott (R): 57.72% (Hold)	Lupe Valdez (D): 38.81%	Others: 3.47%	Margin of error: Medium
Texas Senate	Ted Cruz (R): 55.26% (Hold)	Beto O'Rourke (D): 42.84%	Others: 1.90%	Margin of error: Medium
Finally have a format I'm happy with, so I'm officially ready to start using a prediction model for the midterms. I have 3 elections modeled so far:
@politicsluo Unless there was one at a lower level than legislative, no
Partisan Vote Totals:	Republican Candidates: 21,702 (59.8%) -1.9%	Democratic Candidates: 14,199 (39.2%) +0.9%	Independent Candidates: 223 (0.6%) +0.6%	Libertarian Candidate: 144 (0.4%) +0.4%

In the open 4th Congressional District in Nevada, former Republican Representative Cresent Hardy and former Democratic Representative Steven Horsford will face off in November. Hardy defeated then-incumbent Horsford in 2014
@Cat19Green +5 from Clinton and -6 from Obama for the Democrats. 	-2 from Trump and +5 from Romney for the Republicans.
No surprise in North Dakota as Kevin Cramer wins the Republican primary for US Senate. He will face Incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp in November. Meanwhile, Kelly Armstrong has won the Republican primary for Cramer's US House seat
Full Results from Assembly District 42	Jon Plumer (R): 5713 (53.2%) -5.5% HOLD	Ann Groves Lloyd (D): 4834 (45.0%) +3.7%	Gene Rubinstein (I): 199 (1.8%) +1.8%
Full Results for Wisconsin Senate District 1	Caleb Frostman (D): 14,606 (51.4%) +23.0% FLIP	Andre Jacque (R): 13,800 (48.6%) -23.0%
@Cat19Green Basically she was too liberal for a moderate district
@Cat19Green Weaker candidate
In Nevada, as expected, Incumbent Republican Dean Heller and Democrat Jacky Rosen will face off in November's Senate election
BREAKING: In South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, incumbent Republican US Representative Mark Sanford has lost his primary to Katie Arrington, who was endorsed hours ago by Donald Trump
In Wisconsin Assembly District 42, Republican Jon Plumer has won to hold the seat for his party
@Cat19Green I'm doing my own calculations actually	https://t.co/dGjfu5no5b
In South Carolina, Incumbent Henry McMaster and John Warren advance to a runoff in the Republican Gubernatorial primary
@Jon19911100 Weak Democratic candidate and strong Republican candidate in AD42 is a factor
@HarrySteinDC Local reporter saying he declared victory 5 minutes ago
FLIP ALERT: In Wisconsin Senate District 1, Democrat Caleb Frostman has won to flip the seat. This is the Democratic Party's 10th legislative pickup of 2018
@Seraphim_Chin Maybe in SD1. Remaining precincts could be enough to pull Jacque back into it however
@RandySF45 No 3/16 precincts
@HinghamCPAMom I'm doing a spreadsheet	https://t.co/U1FBiGvyTk
Trying to put together results for the Wisconsin specials here:	https://t.co/U1FBiGvyTk
@DWSalts I live in one of the least competitive counties in the country. I get the feeling
In South Carolina, James Smith has won the Democratic primary for Governor
@DWSalts NOKO panning out could help win back the DC suburbs for sure
Wisconsin special election previews:	https://t.co/FS4ZfEU89M
@DWSalts If Kaine improves on Northam then I would say it's not in play. If Stewart improves on Gillespie, certainly possible
@DWSalts Yeah will be interesting to see whether Stewart performs better or worse than Gillespie
@NeoAlpha5 Agreed. I don't think either would have won, but Stewart could be a massive headache for the party nationwide
@DWSalts I think it'll be rough for Stewart in the general election. National GOP will probably turn efforts elsewhere
@numanmyname Not out of possibility
Corey Stewart has won the Republican primary for US Senate in Virginia barring a tabulation error. He will face Tim Kaine in November
@btpanko Yeah this is true. A lot fewer voters are unionized. Military endorsements are more important in some ways
@SenhorRaposa @btpanko Agreed. Spanberger was the more exciting candidate for sure
@Seraphim_Chin Not much no...He might win this primary tho
@btpanko Yes but he had labor endorsements and equal fundraising. It shouldn't have been that wide a gap based on expectations
@Seraphim_Chin Yep, it was a good call with all of Prince William County out
Corey Stewart now leads for the first time with 92% in
Virginia's 7th Congressional District was expected to have a close Democratic primary. However, Abigail Spanberger has run away with the nomination by a margin of 40 points
Maine primary previews:	https://t.co/S5CUCwTwID
Very close still between Freitas and Stewart with 64% in. Remaining territory seems to slightly favor Stewart but it might not be enough
Jennifer Wexton appears to have won the Democratic primary in Virginia's 10th Congressional District
E.W. Jackson has really fallen flat in Virginia. Remains a close race between Nick Freitas and Corey Stewart
Previews for the #SCGov and #SC01 primaries:	https://t.co/N385i4HKV5
@MaaOther Yeah
@AndrewSoboeiro For sure. We need more reliable polls in that race
@AndrewSoboeiro In more recent polls there's been a consistent advantage to Scott however
@UWEair I don't think it is. He's the favorite
Virginia primary previews:	https://t.co/AVE6cGp9gQ
@AndrewSoboeiro Yes there have. But limited polling in the other races have suggested tossups, whereas polling in Florida suggests Scott with a slight lead
According to polls, Bill Nelson might actually be the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the Senate. Not what anyone would have expected a year ago
Insert obligatory tweet about McCaskill being the luckiest politician in the country https://t.co/HqrfZGYwFZ
Got alerted to this one by @deedahnjr: In Alabama House District 39, Republican Ginny Shaver won her primary for a Democratic-held seat where no Democrats filed
@deedahnjr @politicsluo Ok I'll check that out
@ioannespastor Sorry about that 😬
@ioannespastor You're right I completely misread that. It's 1184 actually which means it's pretty much over
@KarryMeAway End of the week potentially, although recounts could happen
Looks like there's another in Vermont. Democrat Matt Birong looks likely to pick up House District Addison 3 after zero Republicans filed to defend the seat
@RJFlamingo I also specified midterm elections
@RJFlamingo That's a special election
There probably are others I'm missing, so let me know and I'll add them to the list
In California Assembly District 72, it appears two Democrats will make the runoff in the district vacated by Republican Rocky Chavez
In Vermont House District Windham 1, Democrat Sara Coffey was the only candidate to file in a Republican held district
I believe we saw the first two legislative flips of the midterm elections this week (Brief Thread)
RT @stevesingiser: This needs a thread, because is this such a lazy take. 		Start with point #1--Anyone who knows California knows probably…
#CA48 is really coming down to the wire for second place between two Democratic candidates Harley Rouda and Hans Keirstead. Rouda has a 73 vote lead, and my guess would be that it grows in the next few days of mail returns given his late momentum
In California Senate District 32, it appears Republican Rita Topalian and Democrat Vanessa Delgado will advance to an August special election runoff. The weird thing about this is that Delgado actually missed out on the top 2 to Democrat Bob Archuleta in the primary for November
In California Assembly District 45, Democrat Jesse Gabriel has won a special election to hold the seat for his party
In California Assembly District 39, Democrat Luz Maria Rivas has won a special election to hold the seat for her party
@Cat19Green No because it's a congressional race and not a legislative race
Going to try to get some sleep now. We'll know a bit more tomorrow morning, but overall take is a mediocre night for Democrats. Looks ok in every key House race for them, but losing SD29 is a major downside
@Cat19Green Was considered a tossup. Overall margin has been the biggest surprise
@Cat19Green Yes
@Cat19Green Ok I've taken another look and there are two things. Karla Bigham's win is marked as a flip when in reality it was a hold, and Conor Lamb's win is counted among the flips. That explains the numbers you got
Looks like Democrat Kevin De Leon will probably gain the second spot in the Senate election in California and face incumbent Dianne Feinstein
@Cat19Green No not until 2020
@andrew_striedl I don't disagree, but clickbait always sells. Worst recent example of this was leading with "Democrats with 86% swing from Trump" in a special election in KY this February, when in reality it was a purple district downballot with a horrendous Republican candidate
@andrew_striedl I would argue that this is a local issues result, just like Democratic pickups in Oklahoma
This is the Republican Party's 2nd legislative pickup of 2018 https://t.co/MeNiDeXzZw
FLIP ALERT: In California Senate District 29, Democrat Josh Newman has been recalled and replaced by Republican Ling Ling Chang
Matt Rosendale is the Republican primary winner for US Senate in Montana. He will face incumbent Joe Tester in November
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 Not necessarily a lost cause but 48 and 39 would make more sense to pour resources into
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 I'd argue Levin is a better candidate, but they're both strong so not much of a difference
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 He's behind. Looks like Mike Levin might advance
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 Right and Cox keeps those very competitive. 49 might still be a bit of a lost cause tho
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 I mean Newsom has way more votes than every Republican combined. If California went red in November, we'd be looking at a way different national environment than what we're seeing now
@DWSalts @AnyDem2020 I think the bigger effect of Cox will be helping Republicans downballot. It's hard to see a Republican winning statewide in CA without a scandal
@Seraphim_Chin No he very likely won't
@AnyDem2020 Yep
Republican John Cox will make the general election against Gavin Newsom
Democrat Gavin Newsom will advance to the general election for the Gubernatorial election. Republican John Cox is currently in second, but no call has been made
Meanwhile Dusty Johnson has won the Republican primary to replace her in the US House
Kristi Noem has won the Republican primary for South Dakota Governor
Dianne Feinstein will take one of the two general election spots for CA Senate as expected. Big question is whether De Leon or Bradley takes the second spot
@DWSalts Cisneros has gotten a surprising amount of Democratic support, while in this case it's Kim who has overperformed too much for the Republicans. Good start for Dems but far from over.
In CA49, it appears Diane Harkey has done almost too well for the Republicans, taking away support from other candidates who could have received second place
It appears at this point CA48 is the biggest threat to the Democrats in terms of being shut out of the runoff. Gil Cisneros and Mike Levin appear to have done enough so far in the early vote from Orange County
In Mississippi's open 3rd Congressional District, Michael Guest and Whit Hughes advance to a Republican primary runoff, while Ted Evans has won the Democratic primary
Michelle Lujan Grisham has won the Democratic primary for Governor in New Mexico
@Cat19Green They're counting the court election in Wisconsin
In Mississippi, Democrats Howard Sherman and David Baria have been forced into a runoff for the right to oppose Incumbent Roger Wicker
@DWSalts Yeah it honestly interested me the least of every state today
In Alabama, Democrat Walt Maddox and Incumbent Republican Kay Ivey will face off in the gubernatorial general election
@DWSalts Yeah and actually fairly conservative
More California previews: https://t.co/oY0RbDjlMt
In Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, Incumbent Republican Martha Roby has been forced into a runoff with former Democratic representative Bobby Bright
*Democratic primary that is
@DWSalts @UWEair Trump is the problem in these suburbs, while a benefit in rural areas
Fred Hubbell has won the Iowa Gubernatorial primary
@Seraphim_Chin Not really for me to decide if I'm honest. He certainly plays to white nationalists at times however
@notadeplorable 20% is great for a legislative special election
@UWEair Yeah there's definitely a clear trend
Claire McCaskill has got to love these numbers https://t.co/plHWOknCXX
Full Results	Lauren Arthur (D): 14,674 (59.6%) +20.9%	Kevin Corlew (R): 9,917 (40.3%) -21.0%	Write In: 27 (0.1%)		Turnout: 20%
@Cat19Green No it's a hold, because it went from Democrat &gt; Democrat
@Seraphim_Chin @EricGreitens Run? Maybe. Win? Unlikely.
@Seraphim_Chin @EricGreitens To be fair Greitens would have only made things worse
This is the Democratic Party's 9th legislative flip of 2018 https://t.co/e3OiWqcO0A
FLIP ALERT: In Missouri Senate District 17, Democrat Lauren Arthur has won to flip the seat for her party
AP calls the Democratic Primary in New Jersey's 2nd Congressional Disrict for Jeff Van Drew. Hard to see him not flipping this seat in November
In New Jersey, no huge surprise as Bob Menendez and Bob Hugil will face off in the general election. Only thing that's notable is the 59% showing by Menendez in his primary
@JoshHo8 @Redistrict That's kinda what'll happen when everyone's watching the same races
In the key Democratic primary in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, Tom Malinowski is the winner
@Seraphim_Chin He'll win the general, but he would have lost the primary to a strong challenger
South Dakota primary previews: https://t.co/7JGLOCWJfo
Bob Menendez is really underperforming in this election against a little-known opponent. Imagine if he had faced a legitimate adversary

@PhilVanderKlay @politicsluo That clears it up then
RT @PhilVanderKlay: @electionwatchus @politicsluo There are two questions, one ballot in the recall. If you select "no" on the recall, you…
@politicsluo Who knows though? The recall isn't getting nearly the clear coverage it should
@politicsluo Everything I've read seems to imply that it's not separate
@politicsluo I might be mistaken but I'm pretty sure it's the same ballot tonight with two questions
@politicsluo If people vote for the recall, that means the electorate is Republican. Very few voters will vote for a recall and then for a Democratic replacement candidate
@UWEair Yeah and it's not like Newman is personally responsible for the bill. They've just targeted him as the most vulnerable Democrat
Special election previews for today: https://t.co/SfBu7RDPvw
@gelliottmorris Worth noting turnout was 3%
@NonstopDiatribe It could've if the district wasn't so Democratic
@Patriot_Pat1 Pretty much my reaction when I checked Ballotpedia and saw an election today https://t.co/r0dHIvVQ4X
@homecici Because it's Vermont and most of the state loves him. Might not be a huge deal outside Vermont but it's massive in the state
@UWEair @CA_Dem Yes and the fact that it's a Monday night election for a six month term in a D+75 seat also drove down turnout
@AndrewSoboeiro Kinda low level state race though so I'm not surprised
@AndrewSoboeiro Yeah weird Monday special in Hartford
RT @UWEair: @electionwatchus TURNOUT: 3%
@UWEair Yeah figured it was low but that's awful
Partisan Swings	Democratic Candidates: 93.3% (+6.2%)	Republican Candidate: 5.0% (-7.9%)	Write-In: 1.7% (+1.7%)

In Connecticut House District 4, Democrat Julio Concepcion has won to hold the seat for his party
@TheAlextrifier I think the difference between Freitas and Stewart is Northam 2017 vs. Warner 2008 tbh. Big win either way, but with Stewart it could be shockingly large
Unless Freitas manages to win the primary, Tim Kaine is going to have a historically big win in Virginia this year https://t.co/9QCD9D0a5U
We have one random Monday special election on tap today: https://t.co/luWv88cFiB
@AnyDem2020 @politicsluo Bernie will crush any Republican by 40 points tbh
Rocky de la Fuente has qualified to run for Senate in Vermont, making it 6 states he has qualified to run in. He totally could win the primary in Vermont as well (cc: @politicsluo)
@NonstopDiatribe It's interesting enough to talk about imo, but the only close race in Vermont this year will be the State Legislature race
@NonstopDiatribe Ok what is it? I am always looking to refine things like this!
This guy, who is a well-known perennial candidate in Vermont, is likely going to become the nominee in multiple races at once https://t.co/wBiJBSbFFu
Hope you enjoyed the thread!
Finally, the only major potential GOP flip I can see is in the State Senate in the Essex-Orleans district, a two-member district which Trump won by two points but has two Democratic incumbents. Both could be vulnerable, as they are the only two VT Democrats in Trump-won districts https://t.co/87QBsO6iY8
Windsor-Orange 1 is a potential flip as well. The previous Democratic incumbent was unseated by just 2 votes last year, which means that this seat could once again be very much in play this year. Clinton won the district by 20 points in 2016. https://t.co/o699KIEoRf
In Windham County, my home county, the Republicans could lose their hold over their only seat in the county, Windham 1, a Clinton +20 seat. Incumbent Mike Hebert isn't running for reelection, and they are struggling to find a candidate to take on a well-funded Democratic effort https://t.co/V4wdbe3jzo
In 3 Lamoille County races, the Democrats could pick up seats. In Lamoille 1 and Lamoille 3, Democrats haven't fielded candidates but still have a massive voter advantage, while in Lamoille-Washington is a split two-member district. Clinton won the districts by 51%, 24%, and 31% https://t.co/6pbMpDn0DY
The Democrats will also look to pick up three seats in Chittenden County, specifically Chittenden 6-1 and Chittenden 8-1, both two-member districts, and Chittenden 8-3. However, they are still searching for challengers in all 3, despite Clinton wins of 49%, 33%, and 28% https://t.co/oOtc5vhnYU
Another pickup opportunity is in Bennington County, where the Democrats have a really strong opportunity in Bennington 2-2. This is another two-member district with one Democrat and one Republican, but the Democrats still need a challenger. Clinton won this seat by 21% https://t.co/STx5meTUX4
In Addison County, the Democrats could pick up three seats. Addison 3 and Addison 4 are both two-member districts where each party holds one seat, while Addison 5 is a one-member district with a GOP incumbent. Hillary Clinton won these seats by 21%, 27%, and 29%, respectively https://t.co/TfQnalsi2c
The Democrats essentially need to gain 10 seats for this majority, given that all 7 progressives will typically vote with them. Even 3 flipped seats would be bad for Republicans, as they would have to rely on the independents. With that in mind, here are some potential targets
The biggest goal for the Vermont Democratic party is creating a veto-proof majority in the Legislature. They have a 21-7 advantage in the Senate, more than enough for a two-thirds majority. They also have an 83-53 advantage in the House, with 7 progressives and 7 independents
Lt. Governor David Zuckerman, a member of Vermont's legitimate 3rd party, the Vermont Progressive Party, who runs as a Democrat is also attempting to get reelected. He narrowly won in 2016 and now faces a strong opponent in House Minority Leader Don Turner (R-Chittenden 10) https://t.co/z4xT9Y7yvL
Sanders will actually face a challenge in the Democratic primary, which he typically runs for before declining the nomination. That challenge is from Philippe Reines, a former Hillary Clinton aide who has run on arguing that Sanders isn't a real Democrat. Spoiler: It won't work.
Moving on to the US Senate race, Incumbent Independent Bernie Sanders shouldn't have that much trouble, especially considering his 45 point win in his last election. There will be a Republican running against him, but it doesn't seem like he will attract a strong challenge https://t.co/cBeXRO647H
At this point, the favorite in the Democratic primary is Christine Hallquist, a nonprofit executive, who if elected would be the first transgender Governor in United States history. One key factor in this primary, however, will be if someone can secure Bernie Sanders' endorsement
Four Democrats are running to replace Scott, but they are yet to find an A-list candidate for this seat, with many strong candidates not wanting to challenge a popular incumbent. The filing deadline is today in Vermont, and I've heard the party doesn't expect a late entry
The biggest election is the Gubernatorial election, where incumbent Republican Governor Phil Scott, the only Vermont Republican elected statewide in 2016, looks to win a second term as Governor after defeating Democrat Sue Minter in 2016. https://t.co/6ImeQ9xf2e
So, it may not be a big deal nationally, but I think there's a lot of interesting pieces in play in my home state of Vermont for 2018
Okay I'll work on this tonight then https://t.co/xPUCzA77C3
@Dindy5 @4Freedom4ever Greitens resigning is good for Republicans...
@AndrewSoboeiro There's a lot of results here: https://t.co/f0fYv09rUY
Do you have an interest in seeing a thread on Vermont elections this year?
@AndrewSoboeiro For sure, but nothing really surprised me about this result. Democrats have underperformed significantly in every MS special election this year. I think a statewide election in Wisconsin has more national significance
@AndrewSoboeiro I think that's an overreaction. The election was officially nonpartisan, so it's hard to draw conclusions about the two parties. Also, averages of generic ballot polling have continuously showed a D+6 advantage. Media has sensationalized outliers
@AndrewSoboeiro https://t.co/CJ78xoAhGl
This might have won it for Rosebud. Picked up a lot of voters in the district's largest county (and Ferretti's base) https://t.co/ojYrW4SFvr
@Jon19911100 No. Mississippi has bad precinct data but ballpark estimate is Clinton won this district with somewhere around 60-70%. Best I can do 😬
Partisan Swing from primary to runoff	Democratic candidates: 52.0% (-4.8%)	Republican candidates: 48.0% (+4.8%)
@Metzgurdlin Yeah he consolidated support well for sure
Full Unofficial Results	Tracey Rosebud (D): 1,551 (52.0%) +29.1%	 Blake Ferretti (R): 1,430 (48.0%) +4.8%		Swings based on May 8 jungle primary
@UWEair Yeah the non partisan thing basically caused this entire election to be about race
@DWSalts 52-48. I'll post full results in a few seconds
@Metzgurdlin Just finally found a result. Looks like Rosebud won by 100 votes
This was long building towards what would have been a major upset, but a late push from Democratic activists, both local and national, seems to have held this seat
In Mississippi House District 30, Democrat Tracey Rosebud has narrowly won and will hold the seat for his party
@Metzgurdlin Have you by any chance heard anything about the result in HD30 tonight? I can't find anything online
@ResistanceMemb2 No this district is one of the worst I have ever seen at reporting results. We didn't know the results of the primary until the next day
@Jon19911100 No special election. Parson holds the seat until 2020. And yes, it is a positive sign for the R ticket, especially with a key State Senate special election next week
Republican Governor of Missouri Eric Greitens has resigned amid a continuing scandal regarding an affair and blackmail allegations. Michael Parson, the Republican Lt. Governor, will become the new Governor on June 1

@AndrewSoboeiro Yes
@AndrewSoboeiro No I was talking about Wallace with regard to antisemitism accusations
@AndrewSoboeiro Both are weak. But Garrett is worse given everything we've heard about him in the last week
Arthur Jones (R-IL03), neo-nazi	Bill Fawell (R-IL17), Insane conspiracy theorist	Scott Wallace (D-PA01), Accusations of anti-semitism might cost Ds flippable seat	Tom Garrett (R-VA05), Laziest campaign of the year so far	Archie Parnell (D-SC05), Domestic violence allegations https://t.co/9c6CVAjgoK
Why internal polling is useless in 240 characters https://t.co/GftZDyVuUi
In Kentucky House District 71, Republican Majority Leader Jonathan Shell was defeated by Travis Brenda in a primary upset. Brenda is a teacher and this is viewed as a reaction to anger among teachers in Kentucky over a recent pension bill
@ASauer8 Republican hold as expected https://t.co/WCHh7BVfPQ
In Arkansas Senate District 29, Republican Ricky Hill has won a special election to hold the seat for his party
In Texas' 7th Congressional District, Lizzie Pannill Fletcher has won the Democratic runoff, giving the DCCC the candidate they wanted
In Kentucky's 6th Congressional District, Amy McGrath narrowly won the Democratic primary
In the Arkansas Gubernatorial primary, Democrat Jared Henderson and incumbent Republican Asa Hutchinson have won their respective primaries
In Arkansas Senate District 16, Republican Breanne Davis has won a special election to hold the seat for her party
In Texas, Lupe Valdez has narrowly won the Democratic primary runoff for Governor
In the Georgia Gubernatorial primary, Stacey Abrams won the Democratic nomination by a wide margin. On the Republican side, Casey Cagle and Brian Kemp were forced into a runoff.
@politicsluo Vermont is obviously Safe D
Two key Democratic runoffs in Texas. In the gubernatorial race, Andrew White could pull off a big upset over Lupe Valdez, while a moderate vs. progressive battle is on the cards between Lizzie Fletcher and Laura Moser, who the DCCC took the unusual step of attacking
Similar establishment vs. antiestablishment questions will appear on the Republican side where moderate Lt. Governor Casey Cagle is expected to defeat populist conservative Secretary of State Brian Kemp
#GAGov sees a Democratic primary which will have a lot to do with racial divides among southern Democrats and moderate vs. progressive candidates. African American progressive Stacey Abrams is currently favored to win over white moderate Stacey Evans
#KY06's Democratic primary is the biggest in Kentucky tonight. Popular former mayor Jim Gray is considered by many to be the best candidate for the general election in this competitive race, but faces a very strong challenger in veteran Amy McGrath
Twitter preview thread, updated throughout the afternoon
So I've found myself very busy with meetings this afternoon and evening so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to do for previews and other coverage. I'll do my best but it certainly won't be as extensive as usual
Special thanks to Jonathan Pestana for writing these previews for US House elections in Kentucky: https://t.co/SjTbsq860u
@Cat19Green Graham is a strong candidate on the Democratic side
@Cat19Green Walker has been good at surviving so far
@Cat19Green @nebhusker84 It's been overhyped imo. Texas is still a Republican state with an incumbent
@browntailedhawk That's true. Arguments like this can help rile up the base, but won't change anyone's votes
@AndrewSoboeiro Yep pretty much. Colorado hasn't elected many Republicans statewide recently
@AndrewSoboeiro I think it won't be close as people think it will be
@AndrewSoboeiro It's a favorable map for Democrats, which will help. There are a few potentially difficult defenses in Minnesota and Connecticut tho
@politicsluo @Patriot_Pat1 Essentially uncontested but I just think the August primary is a good time benchmark to see if Bredesen still has momentum
@politicsluo @Patriot_Pat1 I won't be convinced until post-primary polls give Bredesen the lead
@politicsluo That's optimistic but not out of question
@DWSalts Nah Sinema is one of the most conservative Democrats in congress. The socialist is someone else
@wbaker18 Yep Davis won KS02 against Brownback
@DWSalts Yeah but with a moderate like Sinema running on the other side she might have to at least pivot towards the center
@jeffstrabone Bredesen is strong but it still might be too conservative of a state. We'll see
@wbaker18 KS 02 has a really strong candidate in Paul Davis, while KS 03 was won by Clinton but could go either way
@UgaritNoosphere Yeah it's a tossup right now according to most prediction websites
@DWSalts John James is the most underrated candidate on either side, as long as he gets national party support. McSally could win Arizona, but not sure about Ward
@UgaritNoosphere Yeah he's got a good chance. But being a Democrat in Tennessee will be tough
@Ithacating Agree with everything you said there. Those would be the next two most likely to flip imo
@DWSalts Both in many cases. Renacci could become very competitive however, especially if his campaign touches on some of the questionable things in Brown's past.
@DWSalts Those were three of the ones I was least sure of anyway. If Democrats get the right candidates, they win all three. The wrong candidates and they lose all three. I think predictions aren't very accurate until after primaries tbh
@UgaritNoosphere No, I won't predict him winning unless he has a lead after the GOP primary
@DWSalts Nah Brown has crossover populist appeal. DeWine will win easily however.
@DWSalts Comstock is by far the strongest Republican incumbent, but her district was maybe too strong for Clinton. Iowa is impossible to predict because it swings back and forth so often. All depends on the candidates, but Dems have more momentum there as of now
@DWSalts I almost put Rick Scott red actually. It's a complete tossup there so I went with my gut. I also think Morrissey and Hawley could easily win, but I haven't seen enough independent polling data to suggest that
All of you are free to argue with me on any individual race from any of these three maps. I'd love to discuss it https://t.co/u5fc0KLoe4
I think the House is actually a lot closer than people think. I'll say 221-214 in favor of the Democrats for now, but poor candidates on either side could easily swing it in either way https://t.co/4YzAo1qHdu
@DWSalts Probably not, given that I have the Democrats very narrowly winning the house
In the gubernatorial elections, I see Democrats gaining six seats: Maine, Illinois, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, and New Mexico https://t.co/4IhX3KjxP7
@nebhusker84 I doubt O'Rourke wins in Texas, but Bredesen could easily win in Tennessee. As for Tester, I think he's going to barely hold on.
If I had to take a guess right now to the results of the 2018 Senate elections, this would be my prediction. The Senate stays 51-49, as Republican gains in Indiana and North Dakota cancel out Democratic gains in Nevada and Arizona https://t.co/6abLmaYh43
@thebossbabymom Of course it's an opinion. Putting facts was sarcasm
@Seraphim_Chin It's too irrelevant to modern politics tho. People know that fact, but Republicans should be talking about modern day issues they gain support on like taxes
@travisjbtweet I'm not taking sides. My point is an election analysis-based one that the GOP have much more effective arguments for black votes than this
While this is true, Republicans have a point that this is clearly getting more attention than the flip in HD48 https://t.co/U2Pu09mJCb
@Tykeltur It's just an opinion, which I'm allowed to state. I'm an independent who has voted for candidates from both parties in reality
Facts:		This remains the dumbest modern political argument https://t.co/lG7THDxroF
Full Results	Clint Owlett (R): 7,834 (76.0%) -4.8% HOLD	Carrie Heath (D): 2,472 (24.0%) +4.8%
@DWSalts No Clinton won by two points. However, Republicans have done better downballot there
@DWSalts PA01 has an incumbent in Brian Fitzpatrick. Lamb is an unusually good Democratic candidate.
Lamb's chances of winning here have been very underrated in my opinion. I actually think this district might be more likely to flip than PA01 and PA07 https://t.co/W5A35WRqIJ
In Idaho's 1st Congressional District, Ross Fulcher has won the Republican primary and will likely win the open seat in November
Late last night, Lt. Governor Brad Little won the Republican primary for Governor in Idaho
@Cat19Green In these districts specifically. Basically take Clinton/Trump and swing it +3 Dem and those were the results
Paulette Jordan has won the Democratic primary for Idaho Governor
So both parties gain a seat in Pennsylvania tonight. Democrats gain HD178, which had swung towards Clinton. Republicans gain HD48, which had swung towards Trump. Safe to say 2016 election results aren't an anomaly and signify a continued change in demographics
@TheSecretsSafe No not tonight. There will be some races in Arkansas next week however
Full Results	David Burkette (D): 3,873 (89.6%) -10.4%* HOLD	D.J. Johnson (R): 449 (10.4%) +10.4%		*No Republican candidate in 2014
@sistercrow @ASauer8 Thibodeau (52%) and Cavanaugh (43%) will advance to November general.
In the Oregon Gubernatorial election, Incumbent Democrat Kate Brown and Republican Knute Buehler have won their respective primaries and will face off in November
With 100% of votes reported, Kara Eastman leads Brad Ashford by 165 votes in the Democratic primary in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District
@LMBERG44 No it's a special election
@RandySF45 DLCC is calling it a win already. So is Tai's campaign. Typically campaigns are ahead of every one else in counts
FLIP ALERT: In Pennsylvania House District 178, Democrat Helen Tai has won to flip the seat. This is the 8th legislative seat the Democratic Party has gained in 2018
Susan Wild has won the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional district
Mary Gay Scanlon has won the Democratic Primary in Pennsylvania's 5th Congressional District
Defeats incumbent Dom Costa https://t.co/oTVISC3AVq
@UWEair @TheAlextrifier He's still *technically* serving as a Democrat however
In Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, Guy Reschenthaler has defeated Rick Saccone to win the primary for this seat
@TheAlextrifier Yeah he was open about being a Democrat, but ran as a Republican because he was too conservative to receive the Democratic nomination
@TheAlextrifier Long story, but he switched to the Democratic party within hours of being elected, so they didn't really gain anything
FLIP ALERT: In Pennsylvania House District 48, Republican Tim O'Neal has flipped the seat for his party. This is the 1st seat the Republican Party has gained as a result of a special election in 2018.
Shaffer defeats incumbent Randy Vulakovich https://t.co/el8CoV9fIq
John Fetterman has defeated incumbent Lt. Governor Mike Stack in the Democratic Primary. Jeff Bartos has won the Republican Primary
In Nebraska, no surprises as Democrat Bob Krist and Republican Incumbent Pete Ricketts will face off in November's gubernatorial election. Also, Jane Raybould has won the Democratic primary and will face Deb Fischer in the state's US Senate election
@politicsluo No that one is 50-50 with 14% in
@politicsluo 75-25 with 85% in
In Pennsylvania House District 68, Republican Clint Owlett has won a special election to hold the seat for his party
Two key primary winners in Pennsylvania	In CD4, Madeline Dean wins the Democratic primary	In CD9, Dan Meuser wins the Republican primary
@iamdarylleon @SenBobCasey @GovernorTomWolf Unopposed
@ASauer8 Well, that might change very soon. Madeline Dean has won her primary in the 4th Congressional District and will easily win the general
Special thanks to Jonathan Pestana for his help with the US House previews
Scott Wagner has won the Republican Gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania
@deedahnjr Seems 69% for Moore
Oregon primary previews: https://t.co/Ap2UpbCPDW
@wanderingpol Yes
Lou Barletta has won the Republican primary for US Senate in Pennsylvania and will face incumbent Bob Casey in November
Incumbent Deb Fischer easily wins the Republican primary for US Senate in Nebraska
Defeats incumbent Paul Costa https://t.co/64abs2hhyN
In Alabama House District 4, Republican Parker Moore has won to hold the seat for his party
@ASauer8 Theresa Thibodeau currently leads, followed by Machaela Cavanaugh
In Alabama Senate District 26, Democrat David Burkette has won to hold the seat for his party
In the key Democratic primary in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, Kara Eastman is narrowly defeating Brad Ashford with almost half the votes in. Would be a bit of an upset if she won.

@Metzgurdlin @akmcquade Ferretti appears to have given himself 50 extra votes in the total on his campaign website lmao. Everything else is the same
RT @Metzgurdlin: Because I had to search a million different places, here are my tabulations of #MississippiDistrict30 Special Election (@e…
@GlennMHarvey @Ready2Vote2018 @Cat19Green @BolivarCom Yes these are around what I got. Think Feretti had a few more votes in the one he posted
@GlennMHarvey @Ready2Vote2018 @Cat19Green Source is the Ferretti campaign. I'll post numbers when I get home
Someone in the area has just told me that Blake Ferretti, one of two candidates in Mississippi House District 30, is in fact a Republican. The other, Tracey Rosebud, is a Democrat https://t.co/RKMUrPElo8
@Metzgurdlin Ah okay. My guess was that he leaned right based on voucher views but he hadn't said anything publicly about caucusing with either party to my knowledge so I wasn't sure
Defeats incumbent Duane Hall, who was facing sexual harassment claims https://t.co/DFNhAamkW3
@Ready2Vote2018 @Cat19Green Ok. I have some results and it appears there will be a runoff between Blake Ferretti and Tracey Rosebud
In Mississippi House District 30, Blake Ferretti and Tracey Rosebud have advanced to a special election runoff. Specials in Mississippi are nonpartisan, but Rosebud is clearly a Democrat. Ferretti is more of an unknown and could end up caucusing with anyone
Defeats incumbent Beverly Boswell https://t.co/ljir1U22Ih
Logging off for tonight, with every key race called. Expect more results on @electionnight18 tomorrow morning
@nebhusker84 Certainly is
In West Virginia's 3rd Congressional District, Democrat Richard Ojeda and Republican Carol Miller, both state legislators, have won their respective primaries for this open seat
Former NFL player Anthony Gonzalez has won the Republican primary in Ohio's 16th Congressional District and will be favored to hold the Republican leaning seat
In Ohio's 12th Congressional District, Democrat Danny O'Connor and Republican Troy Balderson have won their respective primaries for both November and the August special election in the district.
Defeats incumbent David Curtis https://t.co/L167XidBjD
Defeats incumbent Joel Ford https://t.co/jmAzYmEY8t
@ASauer8 Yeah few more possibilities later as well in local elections
Defeats incumbent Joe Zakas https://t.co/TYnyPaj9kd
Jim Baird has won the Republican primary for the conservative leaning open seat in Indiana's 4th Congressional District. He will be favored to hold the seat in November
Defeats incumbent Mark Drennan https://t.co/e7YvHyqAxD
BREAKING: Mark Harris has defeated incumbent US Representative Robert Pittenger in the Republican primary for North Carolina's 9th Congressional District. This instantly makes the November general election with Democrat Dan McCready very competitive
Jim Renacci has won the Republican primary for US Senate in Ohio. He will face Sherrod Brown in November
Patrick Morrissey has won the Republican primary for US Senate in West Virginia
@ASauer8 83-17 percent wise with 87% in
@ASauer8 Never mind on the runoff. Apparently it's 30% for runoffs in North Carolina
@ASauer8 Yes but a runoff seems possible
@Cat19Green Have been looking but Mississippi kind of sucks at reporting results. I'll let you know when I find something
In North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, top DCCC recruit Dan McCready has won the Democratic primary
Don Blankenship has absolutely crashed in West Virginia. Appears either Morrissey or Jenkins will be the nominee
Mike Braun has won the Republican primary for US Senate in Indiana. He will face incumbent Joe Donnelly in November
Incumbent Joe Manchin has won the Democratic primary for US Senate in West Virginia
AP has now called for Cordray, but not for DeWine. They're both definitely advancing tho https://t.co/hxZA4qDi33
Democrat Richard Cordray and Republican Mike DeWine have won their respective primaries for Ohio Governor
Defeats incumbent Richard Hamm https://t.co/LbA3pSCUKt
Liz Watson has won a key Democratic primary in Indiana's 9th Congressional district and will face incumbent Trey Hollingsworth in November
Incumbent US Representative Robert Pittenger (R-#NC09) might lose his primary tonight. Down 53-45 in early vote
@ChazNuttycombe Yes I will as always

In South Carolina House District 69, Republican Chris Wooten has defeated scattered write-ins to hold the seat for his party
@Jon19911100 Last local election
@Shoresitter Yes. Just posted at SOS website
Full Results from #HD114	Javier Fernandez (D): 8,618 (50.9%) -0.1% HOLD	Andrew Vargas (R): 7,894 (46.6%) -2.4%	Liz de las Cuevas (I): 414 (2.5%) +2.5%
In Massachusetts Senate First Suffolk District, Democrat Nick Collins has defeated two independents to hold the seat for his party
@Seraphim_Chin Yes with the exception of Osceola County
There'll be a lot of takes from this result, but keep in mind that anyone only taking conclusions from Clinton/Trump for this result is oversimplifying things. Based on the actual lean of the district outside of presidential races, a close result is definitely an expected outcome https://t.co/DYmQ1ULdAg
@Seraphim_Chin Central florida in between Orlando and Tampa. Little bit south of Disney World
@FredPiccoloJr That's only for Polk County and doesn't include Osceola
Full Results from #HD39	Josie Tomkow (R): 9,891 (59.9%) -2.3% HOLD	Ricky Shirah (D): 6,628 (40.1%) +2.3%
@savedemocracy18 This is a good result for Democrats. This is a tossup downballot. Trump/Clinton is irrelevant here
In Florida House District 114, Democrat Javier Fernandez has narrowly won to hold the seat for his party
Given the Democratic lean of the election day vote, It appears Democrats are very slight favorites to hold HD114 at this point
In Florida House District 39, Republican Josie Tomkow has won to hold the seat for her party
Previews for tonight's special elections before polls open in 10 minutes: https://t.co/cnKSlJ87aL
Good detailed read on a key election tomorrow https://t.co/N6H78aNFji
Busy month in elections starts on Tuesday with 4 legislative elections. Biggest one will be FL HD114, a Democratic defense in a swingy Miami district that votes heavily Democratic at presidential level but more Republican downballot
Wonder if the Democrats will try to influence the primary to help Arpaio like Claire McCaskill did with Todd Akin in 2012. The seat is clearly Safe D if Arpaio emerges https://t.co/tYJmlCB6bU
@Seraphim_Chin @SenDougJones @ConorLambPA Yeah it shows a huge swing among GOP early voters as well. No good way to swing this for the Republicans.
@MikeMcFeelyWDAY I think the Democrats have actually figured out how to win elections since Tom Perez took over. Successful strategic planning won them Alabama and PA18
@Seraphim_Chin @SenDougJones @ConorLambPA AZ08 is actually maybe the worst of all of those results for the GOP. Moore and Saccone were weak candidates, while Lamb and Jones were very strong. Lesko and Tipirneni were both very average candidates
At this point, it seems almost impossible the Democrats won't retake the House https://t.co/OvnWkxJDDU
@Seraphim_Chin That won't happen. Tiprineni would need to win those ballots by 85%, which won't happen
Full Results from #AZ08	Debbie Lesko (R): 91,390 (52.6%) -10.7% HOLD	Hiral Tipirneni (D): 82,318 (47.4%) +12.3%
@trayf Definitely a much bigger deal. Never said it wasn't
@marcusrebmann Local GOP will be excited. Was talking more about national GOP
@Bella11301963 Trends aren't good with this. If this district votes in this way then GOP will have more trouble in AZ senate race
Republican Debbie Lesko will hold Arizona's 8th Congressional District, but it looks like the margin will only be 4-5 points, a real disappointment for Republicans
@foglandia All that info is in the graph which I originally quoted. NY is mixed, AZ is fantastic for Dems imo
@foglandia 4 positive swings towards Democrats, 7 flatlined results, and 1 swing towards Republicans is mixed results
Very much mixed results for Democrats in New York today, but the good news for them is that their caucus grows by one https://t.co/mTFVvQr40F
@Seraphim_Chin Bit of a surprise Doran didn't win to be honest
RT @ForecasterEnten: There's just no excuse for the GOP here. Early/mail voting is so easy to do in AZ and GOP voted plenty here. Lesko rai…
Jake Ashby (R) 7,797 (50.8%) -15.6% HOLD	Cynthia Doran (D): 7,517 (49.0%) +15.4%	Write-In/Blank/Void: 21 (0.2%) +0.2%
@ASauer8 Yes by just under 300 votes
Christopher Tague (R): 8,547 (45.9%) -19.7% HOLD	Aidan S. O'Connor (D): 8,259 (44.3%) +9.9%	Wesley D. Laraway (I) 1,809 (9.7%) +9.7%	Write-In/Blank/Void: 19 (0.1%) +0.1%
In New York Assembly District 107, Republican Jake Ashby has won to hold the seat for his party
In New York Assembly District 102, Republican Christopher Tague has won to hold the seat for his party
@M_Young_90 That sounds about right. Either way, bad news for the GOP
John K. Mikulin (R): 2,143 (63.3%) +0.7% HOLD	Matt Malin (D): 1,215 (35.9%) -1.5%	Write-In/Void: 29 (0.8%) +0.8%
Debbie Lesko takes just 53-47 lead based on early ballot results in #AZ08. This is a very bad sign for Republican hopes in the midterms https://t.co/Wz5eclzMZU
@PubliusEnig What is this in reference to?
@trayf Yeah that's a fair take. Mixed just seems bad when everything else since Trump has been overwhelmingly positive
@beardedcrank That's an outlier in comparison with every other election except for AD10. Rest of swings have been marginal
@trayf Yes but they really should have flipped AD107 as well. Both were very winnable races.
Democrats actually seem to be underperforming tonight in New York. Look set to fall just short in AD102 and AD107. 107 is especially disappointing for them. They should have won that race.
@MichaelCasey_ "Even though he gained intense support from the Erie County GOP, Bohen promised to caucus with Assembly Democrats if he heads to Albany. He has also promised to support Carl E. Heastie for speaker"
In New York Assembly District 17, Republican John Mikulin has won to hold the seat for his party
@MichaelCasey_ https://t.co/pkQSW1P81u
@ASauer8 Very close but he's narrowly leading
Doug Smith (R): 2,840 (63.1%) -0.5% HOLD	Deborah Slinkosky (D): 1,658 (36.8%) +1.9%	Write-In/Blank: 6 (0.1%) +0.1%
In New York Assembly District 5, Republican Doug Smith has won to hold the seat for his party
@politicsluo @ChazNuttycombe @JMilesColeman There's really no good way to do this except to tell New York to stop being weird
@Jon19911100 https://t.co/aHbFiAFqJT
Steve Stern (D): 5,748 (59.1%) +17.9% FLIP	Janet Smitelli (R): 3,969 (40.8%) -18.0%	Write-In/Blank/Void: 6 (0.1%) +0.1%
FLIP ALERT: In New York Assembly District 10, Democrat Steve Stern has won to flip the district. This is the Democratic Party's 7th flip of 2018
@politicsluo @ChazNuttycombe @JMilesColeman Democrat, but basically same situation
FLIP ALERT: In New York Assembly District 142, Republican Erik Bohen has won to flip the seat. However, he will caucus with the Democrats, which will take away a lot of GOP excitement over this. This is the Republican Party's 1st legislative flip of 2018
Going to count it as a flip with an asterisk I guess https://t.co/xBsqyzyIa5
@JakeSerafini He considers himself a Democrat and runs in their primaries
Mayer's win means the chamber now stands at 32 Democrats and 31 Republicans. However, Democrat Simcha Felder caucuses with the Republicans, giving them control of the Senate https://t.co/QhKOG1ZTN5
In New York Senate District 37, Democrat Shelley Mayer has won to hold the seat
In New York Assembly District 80, Democrat Nathalia Fernandez has won to hold the seat for her party
In New York Assembly District 39, Democrat Ari Espinal has defeated scattered write-in votes to hold the seat
In New York Senate District 32, Democrat Luis Sepulveda has won to hold the seat for his party
In New York Assembly District 74, Democrat Harvey Epstein has unsurprisingly won to hold the seat
New York special election previews are out! Perfect read before polls close in 10 minutes: https://t.co/XwX9GmLPAf
There will be another Congressional special election before the midterms, this one on June 30 to replace Republican Blake Farenthold in Texas's 27th district. We rate this race as Likely R.
@Seraphim_Chin Yeah there's no reason why they'll lose a district like this
@Seraphim_Chin Yeah I would say Lesko gets a win in the range of 5-15 points
RT @politicsluo: Heads up to folks on #AZ08: when the dump of early ballots comes in, unless it’s within a thousand votes or so, we’ll know…
@Seraphim_Chin Never Trump then I'm assuming? If so, is Kasich your top choice for a 2020 primary challenge?

@Seraphim_Chin Rumored 2020 ticket there
With Republican Congressman from Oklahoma's 1st District Jim Bridenstine being confirmed to lead NASA, yet another congressional seat will open up. Questions remain as to whether there will be a special election there before November

Another special election potentially coming here, although might be delayed until November https://t.co/W8so6w3Bah
@Jon19911100 @SenTomCotton @SheriffClarke Wow learn something new every day I guess
@Jon19911100 @SenTomCotton @SheriffClarke Aren't they both Republicans?
@Jasonwaldvogel1 Thune's name surprised me a bit but I like the pick
@wp4637 @politicsluo I love that you included an independent as well
@jacobfhsmith @politicsluo Lol I knew this tweet would happen
@politicsluo Two Vermonters again 😁
Hey #ElectionTwitter: Tell me your favorite politician from each party. I'll start with Phil Scott and Patrick Leahy
@TheAlextrifier Definitely very weird. Just shows how Republican politics are more popular in places with less population density and therefore places that look bigger in maps
@TheAlextrifier For example, this is a Democratic majority, but basically looks the same when mapped https://t.co/5NrgePxsZP
@TheAlextrifier Even by turning swing districts blue, the map won't actually look much different. Most swing districts are small in size. A Democratic majority would basically look the same on the map
@TheAlextrifier Map will always look very red to be fair, since most Democratic strongholds are in relatively small districts in area
With Democrat Conor Lamb being sworn in today, there are now 237 Republicans and 193 Democrats in the US House of Representatives. There are currently five vacancies as well https://t.co/LLt6v1oHff
Am I doing this right? https://t.co/lywY6QvidH
@stephaniemagui4 @POTUS This is worse than every other scandal we've seen however. There's an element of physical abuse here. It's shocking he hasn't been impeached or resigned yet
How has this man not resigned yet? https://t.co/oZoQsflzzx
@gordierox2716 R+6 is the general partisan lean of the seat. It means the district is 6 percentage points more Republican than the country as a whole. For perspective, Ryan's seat is R+5
@emperorga79 They'll find someone better than him for sure
@emperorga79 @IronStache Little too early to say, but State House Speaker Robin Vos is viewed as a strong potential candidate
Just an hour after Ryan's announcement, Republican Dennis Ross of Florida's 15th District will also not be seeking reelection. We now rate his R+6 seat as Likely R
@MelissaLKnutson It's a somewhat rich retirement area, so many of those voters actually do have pensions/financial wealth, which makes them less likely to support more liberal economic plans
@MelissaLKnutson Early ballot return numbers show a majority of voters as registered Republicans with an average voting age of 69. And, there is one poll which shows Lesko up by 14. Simply put, not enough likely swing voters in this area
Kevin McCarthy could be a more moderate pick if Republicans choose to go that direction https://t.co/1ArPYapDyY
If the Republicans do manage to hold the House in 2018, you'd have to imagine Steve Scalise will become the Speaker of the House. But that's a huge if at this point
BREAKING: Reports saying Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan will retire from the House and not seek reelection. His #WI01 seat will be open for an election, and is now somewhere on the border of Leans R and Likely R
@Seraphim_Chin Too early to have a strong opinion on this, but if Biden is the Democratic nominee, I'd say pretty low
@Seraphim_Chin 51-49 GOP Senate and 224-211 Democratic House
@Seraphim_Chin Seems about right imo
@Seraphim_Chin Seems rather unlikely. Early voting numbers look like a very Republican electorate
That's all for tonight. No elections next Tuesday, but we'll be back April 24 to cover 11 New York special elections and #AZ08
This is from Iowa Senate District 25, just to be clear
Annette Sweeney (R): 4,776 (55.9%) -46.1% HOLD	Tracy Freese (D): 3,786 (43.9%) +43.9%*	Write-In: Number Unknown (0.2%)	*No Democratic Candidate in 2014
@Seraphim_Chin Yes but I was talking about the % shift
@politicsluo Yes and no on whether it's better than PA-18. OH-12 is less conservative but has less of a history of voting Democratic. Regardless, would say it's Lean R right now while AZ08 is Safe R
Democratic chances looking even worse in this special election. #OH12 might be a much better special election target https://t.co/4K1fVaDgi0
@Seraphim_Chin Can't speak to that yet, with one county still out
@Seraphim_Chin Would agree with you on that
In Iowa Senate District 25, Republican Annette Sweeney has won to hold the seat for her party
@mlow29 @politicsluo Yes, pretty normal for a legislative special election, especially one which both parties didn't invest much in
*District 31
@ASauer8 I knew. Just briefly thought Donnally was Iowa haha
Full Results from Florida Senate District 25	Lori Berman (D): 22,860 (74.8%) -25.1% HOLD	Tami Donnally (R): 7,696 (25.2%) +25.2%*	Turnout: 9.8%		*No Republican candidate in 2016 or 2012
@ASauer8 Should have said Sweeney here. Got Florida R and Iowa R mixed up for a second
@Seraphim_Chin @IowaSOS @ActorAaronBooth Yeah it really does
@ASauer8 Voter outreach always does
@Seraphim_Chin The only reporting is on twitter right now. @IowaSOS and @ActorAaronBooth are both posting results
@ASauer8 My prediction isn't based on what I've seen so far, but more based on what I've seen in the lead up to the race
@ASauer8 Donnally by 5 points
@Seraphim_Chin Right now it's swinging 6 points to the Democrats, but that might change
@Seraphim_Chin Very preliminary results so far showing the Republican in the lead
@Seraphim_Chin 15
@Seraphim_Chin No they underperformed both Trump and Rubio
In Florida Senate District 31, Democrat Lori Berman has easily won to hold the seat for her party
Special election previews for tonight. Florida polls close at 7ET and Iowa polls close at 10ET. Both should count rather quickly. https://t.co/mp8R9EXNHM

In California Assembly District 45, Democrat Jesse Gabriel and Republican Justin Clark will face off in a June runoff
Calling it a night. Will post results from the two remaining California races tomorrow morning
In California Assembly District 54, early results point to Democrat Sydney Kamlager winning with around 65% and therefore holding the seat without a runoff
@GirlontheL Because they haven't run for this seat recently. They underperformed Clinton/Trump
@politicsluo Yeah, but Democrats have got to be very happy with this actually. Would not have been at all surprising if Hall had won this race
Full Results from Massachusetts House District 2nd Bristol	James Hawkins (D): 3,927 (51.9%) -9.2% HOLD	Julie Hall (R): 3,633 (48.1%) +9.2%
@MaaOther I agree with you on that, but I'm calling it a flip since it clearly is partisan in this case
@MaaOther It's an ideological flip. They're both officially nonpartisan, but Dallet will be completely different than the conservative who last held the seat
FLIP ALERT: We are projecting that liberal justice Rebecca Dallet will win tonight's Wisconsin Supreme Court race, gaining a seat previously held by a conservative justice
Meanwhile results looking good for liberals to gain a seat in the Wisconsin Supreme Court through Rebecca Dallet
Don't know numbers yet, but can confirm that margin was 52-48 to Hawkins https://t.co/RdncObwL8v
@UWEair Yeah having a rising star in your district will always help
@UWEair Yeah it certainly surprised me. Will be interested to see margins
Full Results from Rhode Island Senate District 8	Sandra Cano (D): 682 (71.9%) -3.4%	Nathan Luciano (R): 253 (26.7%) +26.7%	Write-In: 13 (1.4%)
In Rhode Island Senate District 8, Democrat Sandra Cano has won to hold the seat for her party
Margin remains unknown, but GOP will be slightly disappointed not to win this seat given other recent special election results in Massachusetts https://t.co/0ICrgFZgZi
In Massachusetts State House District Second Bristol, Democrat Jim Hawkins has won to hold the seat

Democratic Representative Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut's 5th Congressional District will not seek reelection after allegations of mishandling of abuse claims against an aide. Her D+2 seat moves to Likely D in 2018, but Democrats will likely be helped by her decision to not run
Republican Senator from Mississippi Thad Cochran officially resigned today. He will be replaced by Cindy Hyde Smith
This is a top level troll https://t.co/c1ghKqRSbr
Walker's right that it's dumb to have the special elections now. But if he had just called the special elections when the seats opened, they could have been on the ballot along with the Supreme Court seats on Tuesday at no extra taxpayer cost. He played politics and lost. https://t.co/gY3bMbi60J
@politicsluo Pure tossup. Could really go either way
@ASauer8 Yeah I think we're covering that race
Next week, here's what we'll be covering:	Wisconsin: Supreme Court runoff	Massachusetts: HD Second Bristol	Rhode Island: SD8	California: Top-two primaries in AD39, AD45, and AD54		All are Democratic defenses except WI Supreme Court. WI and MA the only realistic flip possibilities
Full results from Alabama House District 21	Rex Reynolds (R): 2,431 (52.8%) -14.5% HOLD	Terry Jones (D): 2,167 (47.1%) +14.5%	Write-in: 4 (0.1%) +0.0%
@Cat19Green Called it myself based on a combination of near-mathematical impossibility of Jones gaining enough votes and Reynolds already declaring victory and being sworn in.
@Cat19Green Right but Jones isn't going to gain 235 voters from the outstanding precinct. Also, Alabama Republicans are already declaring victory
@ASauer8 Yeah it's a bit weird that they're even having this election tbh. Reynolds will barely serve any days before November
@wanderingpol Waiting on one precinct but Jones is too far behind. Will post when it is official
@wanderingpol Not quite enough. Needs to be below 1% in Alabama
@ASauer8 Yeah the online count is always behind what the candidates have
In Alabama House District 21, Republican Rex Reynolds has narrowly held the seat for his party
@wanderingpol  https://t.co/wDhFxV0paa
@ASauer8 Terry Jones won it by 11 votes, actually.
*11 votes
Most Republican of the 3 goes to Jones by 9. Still would say a flip is unlikely https://t.co/A95pfv9oCg
168 vote Republican lead with 3 precincts left. But Doug Jones won those 3 precincts by 6%. Margin likely to narrow, flip might be a stretch
RT @JMilesColeman: How bout that. 16 of 19 precincts in for AL #HD21. Reynolds (R) up 4.6%. The three precincts left voted for Doug Jones b…
Margin now down to 49 votes (1%) in favor of Reynolds in #HD21. However, the majority of the five remaining precincts are Republican
More precincts come in and now Republican Rex Reynolds takes the lead by 10%. Rest of precincts seem mixed.
@RandySF45 All we know is that he won the full district by 13
@RandySF45 Precinct data is horrible in Alabama, so no idea. That being said, he won by typically overperforming in the suburbs, so I would guess well.
Democrat Terry Jones takes the lead in Alabama House District 21 with 3 precincts in. However, those precincts come from the most Democratic part of the district
@ASauer8 Not yet. Not reporting quickly at all
@gifuoh That being said I'll tweet about them occasionally if I find the results interesting/indicative of trends for other elections
@gifuoh Yeah I don't do municipals usually
1,000 followers! Thank you all so much https://t.co/KJpAr4rhxx
@politicsluo Thanks!
Quick preview of tomorrow's lone special election:	https://t.co/aFdRs0odFp
@nebhusker84 Yeah exactly. If young people stay energized this issue will kill Republicans in the midterms
This is why the organizers are really smart in making voting a huge point of the marches https://t.co/xJxcZ9Vkmg
I've been to many different rallies in my life, but this was one of the best organized from a future progress standpoint. Registering young people to vote was a huge part of it, and Phil Scott will be under a lot of pressure to sign gun laws the legislature passes https://t.co/hGIbx25PjE
@politicsluo Yeah I think Vermonters support the content when the bills are broken down. But there's a lot of "taking my guns" sentiment that people I know in rural areas have
@politicsluo That being said the majority is for gun control and Governor Scott will sign laws that are passing through the legislature right now. One thing I saw today is that people will vote him out if he doesn't sign it
@politicsluo Believe it or not there's a surprising amount of opposition in Vermont with a huge hunting culture.
@politicsluo Yeah I meant relatively. For a progressive state, Vermont has very few gun laws
Was in Montpelier today so stopped by the rally there. Very large turnout there. Interesting to see in a state where gun control is actually unpopular https://t.co/vPeCtFwNNQ
In Louisiana House District 93, Democrat Royce Duplessis has avoided a runoff and defeated three other party members with 72% of the vote, officially holding the seat for his party
In Louisiana House District 86, Republican Nicholas Muscarello has defeated a fellow party member in a special election runoff and officially held the seat for his party
This is obviously very bad for democracy in Kosovo but it is also one of my favorite political headlines of all time https://t.co/T45fvFST63

RT @AP: BREAKING: Republican Rick Saccone concedes Pennsylvania congressional race to Democrat Conor Lamb.
In Illinois' 6th Congressional District, Sean Casten has won a key Democratic primary	In Illinois' 10th Congressional District, Doug Bennett wins a key Republican primary	Both are slight upsets
Calling it a night. Tomorrow will update the following outstanding results on here and @electionnight18 	CD: 2R, 6D, 10R	HD: 1D, 5D, 17D, 42R, 46R, 47D, 49R, 56R
Kwame Raoul has won the Democratic primary for Illinois Attorney General, defeating former Governor Pat Quinn
He's probably not having a painful night given that he appears to have won a race many people thought he would lose... https://t.co/9jpHs8uDvy
Bruce Rauner vs. J.B. Pritzker was always the expected result. Should be one of the craziest campaigns in terms of finances we've ever seen
Incumbent Bruce Rauner has survived a massive scare and will narrowly win the Republican primary for Governor of Illinois
@DeuceTheSalty Well tbh either would have beat Jones
BREAKING: In Illinois's 3rd Congressional District, Incumbent Dan Lipinski has narrowly fended off a primary challenge from the left, winning by around 2%
Defeats incumbent David Reis https://t.co/CApyb6Bu4H
Defeats incumbent Ira Silverstein https://t.co/SZaUOkUTLy
@DeuceTheSalty Yeah Raoul has probably got this
@DeuceTheSalty Not surprised with the lack of Quinn ads. He's cruised to second on name recognition
@DeuceTheSalty Haven't followed too closely but I believe so
@DeuceTheSalty Raoul had a stronger ground game however. Drury would have had a better chance if Quinn didn't run
@DeuceTheSalty Yeah he definitely had the profile to be a more serious candidate than he turned out to be. Didn't run a strong campaign
Erika Harold has won the Republican primary for Attorney General
Confirmed that it was a counting error. Lipinski still leads by 1.8% now. Reports of Newman in the lead are incorrect https://t.co/r3nH7OhlAQ
AP suddenly has Marie Newman in the lead in IL-03. It seems possible to me there might have been a counting error in Will County, but we'll see
Bruce Rauner now looking in slightly better shape than Jeanne Ives
In the 12th Congressional District of Illinois, Democrat Brendan Kelly and Incumbent Republican Mike Bost will face off in a close November contest, having won their respective primaries
Something big from earlier today, as AG Secretary Cindy Hyde-Smith is likely to become her state's first female Senator https://t.co/DgHwkHRjYx
@DeuceTheSalty He's unopposed and will be the Republican nominee
@gengsanc They have a good chance if Ives wins
@DeuceTheSalty An attempt to primary Dan Lipinski, viewed as one of the most conservative US House Democrats
J.B. Pritzker has won the Democratic primary for Illinois Governor
In the Democratic primary in the 3rd, Marie Newman and incumbent Dan Lipinski are still running neck and neck. Lipinski leads by 4% with 68% in
In the 4th Congressional District of Illinois, Jesus "Chuy" Garcia has won the Democratic primary for this open seat vacated by Luis Gutierrez (D). He will face Republican Mark Lorch in November
Things looking good for J.B. Pritzker so far
@DeuceTheSalty Definitely
@DeuceTheSalty Even how close Ives is right now is something that hasn't been seen in recent years. Last time an incumbent Governor lost a primary was 2014 in Hawai'i
@DeuceTheSalty Very early still but early results definitely indicating that
Jeanne Ives is running very close to Bruce Rauner in the suburbs. This is bad for the incumbent
@DeuceTheSalty @electionnight18 Yes and with no runoff rule it'll be even more interesting
@DeuceTheSalty @electionnight18 Yes certainly a lot of possibilities
Once again, we'll be posting results from every race at @electionnight18. This account will only focus on the key races tonight
Polls have closed in the Illinois primaries. Results here:	https://t.co/gCbKMALN7P

It's unclear at this moment whether there will be a Congressional special election before November to fill this 55-39 Clinton seat
Slaughter was the first woman to chair the House Committee on rules and represented Northwestern New York since 1987
This is classless and embarrassing btw https://t.co/aYgW6UExxf
Incredibly sad news as Democratic Representative from New York Louise Slaughter has passed away at 88
@Decision_Desk Yeah that's true, but people are generally going to be more interested in Congressional races over judicial races. Media will typically what will keep people interested and therefore get views so I'm not surprised
@Decision_Desk Interesting trend: Democrats much more interested in legislative and congressional elections. Fewer big swings in municipal and judicial elections
@Decision_Desk Yeah NJ was an easy one for the Democrats. And AL and PA showed that bad GOP candidates and good DEM candidates can signify big swings. GA showed that a mediocre DEM candidate can fail to significantly overperform Clinton.  The House will be won in the primaries imo
@Decision_Desk Better argument would be that yes, Democrats are winning special elections, but the midterms will have different turnout numbers
@Decision_Desk I agree that they don't mean much for midterms except maybe indicating an enthusiasm gap. But they are wins, which makes the blip argument weird
@AaronD825 Yeah NJ was a very forgettable race tbh
@wv_rep Sure. He's a loose cannon and could easily find himself in controversy. One of the reasons why Democratic Senators Joe Donnelly and Claire McCaskill are in office in red states is loose cannon GOP candidates in 2012. If AG Jim Hood runs, McDaniel becomes a major risk
Annnnnnd the special election for Thad Cochran's seat just became competitive https://t.co/f9XcLu2ICN
@AaronD825 New Jersey
Um, so there's an argument that special elections won't be indicative of the general election. However, net gains of 35 legislative seats, 1 Senate seat, 1 Congressional seat, and 1 Governor's mansion don't seem like a blue blip to me. The "blip" has lasted for over a year https://t.co/0wUcjYxZdi
@DeuceTheSalty No there are at most 300 votes left, so it won't have an effect
@DeuceTheSalty Provisionals lean D	Military lean R
@Bella11301963 I don't work for any side. FOX News leans right, so they are telling their viewers (mostly conservatives) that Saccone still has a chance. Every vote has been counted except provisionals and military and there simply aren't enough of those to make a difference for Saccone
Republican Primary Runoff winners last night	SC HD99: Chris Wooten	AR SD16: Breanne Davis
Full Results from #PA18	Conor Lamb (D): 113,813 (49.8%) +13.8% FLIP	Rick Saccone (R): 113,186 (49.6%) -14.4%	Drew Miller (L): 1,379 (0.6%) +0.6%
With Greene County, every vote has officially been counted in #PA18 except provisionals and military ballots. Conor Lamb wins by 627 votes (about .2%). Your vote matters.
Washington County finally reported at 5:30 last night, and margin swung to Lamb. Saccone doesn't have a chance at this point
FLIP ALERT: Democrat Conor Lamb has won the special election for #PA18
I give up on Washington County. It's amazing how backwards parts of the country are with elections
RT @ForecasterEnten: This is so ridiculous. I know full well what the results will show (within a range), and yet I'm still awake.
Going to catch an hour of sleep and set an alarm for 2:30, when Washington County reports absentee results
@GraceJunSD Thank you!
Conor Lamb just declared victory now
These were my numbers tonight. Only problem was overestimating Libertarian vote, which is hard to guess. Candidates are in order: Lamb, Saccone, and Miller https://t.co/ArgH8YY4wr
@Cat19Green I think around 2am ET
While you all are here, I'm excited to announce that I'm going to try to launch an election prediction model before midterms. Tested it tonight and I got the margin exactly right. The next step is to test in #AZ08 to see if it will work in a differently styled district
@politicsluo Sleep is overrated
Might make a call in this race depending on absentee results in Washington County. Could be over an hour until we have those unfortunately
@Bella11301963 There were just under 7K absentee ballots, but we're down to just over 1K now. Democrats typically overperform in absentee ballots. Question now seems to be margin in case of recount
@Trumpsters45 Yes but he's out of votes to win this on the night. Will probably go to a recount
@Bella11301963 This is not true. There are just over 1K absentee votes remaining, and while they are in Saccone Counties, it won't be enough
The DCCC has claimed victory in this race
BREAKING: With absentee votes in from Westmoreland and every election day precinct counted, it looks like barring a big surprise Democrat Conor Lamb will flip #PA18
@Cat19Green Well, we'll have a better idea once Westmoreland reports around midnight
Full Results from Tennessee State Senate District 14	Shane Reeves (R): 13,139 (71.7%) -2.7% HOLD	Gayle Jordan (D): 5,179 (28.3%) +2.7%
In Mississippi House District 60, Republican Fred Shanks has defeated a fellow party member to win this Republican district via a runoff
Current mood: Steve Kornacki spitting out a pen on MSNBC
Allegheny absentees break towards Lamb by a 62% margin. Saccone will need 60% from the remaining absentees in theory. That would mean overperforming election day
RT @Nate_Cohn: .@DecisionDeskHQ says last two Westmoreland precincts are Latrobe2 and NLigonier. Saccone could reasonably hope for net-200…
This race will be basically a tie on election day. 7,000 early votes will decide this, and should lean towards Lamb in theory
This is a very bad take https://t.co/oykgVy6WDd
RT @gelliottmorris: 1200 absentee ballots won’t be counted until tomorrow. If you want to stay up until a call, you’ll be awake a long time…
RT @Redistrict: UPDATE: Lamb (D) lead falls to 928 votes (0.4%) w/ 95% of precincts reporting. Nearly all Westmoreland in. The remaining Al…
95% is in and Lamb leads by 928 votes. Should be insanely close
Greene County has fully reported, and it's only 2% of the district. But Lamb is running 5% ahead of the benchmarks @DKElections set FWIW
Westmoreland County is not reporting by precinct, making this a really difficult race to predict. It looks very very close however
RT @Redistrict: Right now, all the counties are breaking as they would in a tied #PA18 outcome. The reason I might but a thumb on the scale…
RT @Redistrict: I'd still maybe rather be Lamb (D) but this is a *very* close special. #PA18
@Cat19Green Not fully reported yet but a big GOP win it appears
In Tennessee State Senate District 14, Republican Shane Reeves has won to hold the seat for his party
This looks very close in #PA18
@DeuceTheSalty Yes but that will change when Saccone drives up margins in rural areas
@DeuceTheSalty I don't see a big lead here. I think it will be close either way
@DeuceTheSalty Yeah that's the picture of things right now
@DeuceTheSalty Yes based on what we've seen so far it looks really close, with a slight Lamb edge
@DeuceTheSalty Yes Lamb has the lead, but important to note that majority of vote coming from the most Democratic County, Allegheny
Count moving slowly but Lamb has a slight advantage so far https://t.co/Uu9bZg2umE
@Lmzeigler91606 Yes I would agree with that
Polls have officially closed in #PA18	https://t.co/XCdu0CLMtM
@fishercutbait Yes, which has been a rallying cry for Christian conservatives, but has also angered Democrats and motivated them
@emperorga79 Doubt they will as well but any diminishing of turnout could be bad in a state where special elections have swung hard left
In a low turnout race, it could really hurt GOP candidate Shane Reeves if strongly conservative Republicans don't turn out
Wow...Right wing Conservatives don't like their centrist candidate in today's special election in Tennessee Senate District 14. This post is from the Facebook of a Conservative candidate who has run in past district primaries, receiving 12% in 2016. https://t.co/1Dyr77RC1O
Random take but if Conor Lamb wins tonight, the narrative should be (but probably won't be) more about how good of a campaign he's run than how poor of a campaign Saccone has run
@politicsluo Thank you!
Special election previews for tomorrow, especially focusing on #PA18	https://t.co/swGfCKVf1T
@ioannespastor Yeah it just doesn't check out right with sampling. Certainly an outlier
2 things about this poll:	1) Generic ballot polls are not useful with these states. Manchin is ahead by double digits when you give voters an actual opponent	2) Hawley +8 is a good number for Missouri GOP but I'm not sure I trust their sample, which has Greitens at 49/48 approval https://t.co/Aue7b9S79R
@politicsluo Definitely will do it again. Trying to be ahead come election night. Will make things easier to cover
@politicsluo I just made the blank map lol. Was really bored
@angelsfan1982 Every Republican is being contested. Remaining spots will be filled in May runoffs
With four seats going uncontested in Texas, the Democrats will hold four seats without opposition during the midterms https://t.co/cjDCe7AF9X
@nebhusker84 Yeah spending 6 million on a failed primary campaign is embarrassing. Hulings failing to make the runoff was definitely surprising as well, given his support from the Castro brothers
Here's every candidate that currently will be competing in Texas US House elections in November. Remaining spots will be filled in May runoffs https://t.co/zvJrQYSICT
Still missing one precinct in Texas' 23rd Congressional District. Gina Ortiz Jones will definitely be in the Democratic runoff, along with probably Rick Trevino.

In Congressional District 6, Ron Wright and Jake Ellzey will face off in a Republican primary runoff
In Texas Congressional District 16, Democrat Veronica Escobar has won her party's primary for this open Democratic seat
We have our first US House runoff of the night in Texas. In District 6, Democrats Ruby Faye Woolridge and Jana Lynne Sanchez will face off in a runoff
Lupe Valdez and Andrew White will face off in a runoff in the Texas Democratic Gubernatorial primary
In the Republican primary of Texas Congressional District 7, Incumbent John Culberson has won
In Texas Congressional District 3, State Senator Van Taylor has won the Republican primary for this open seat

Still waiting for winners from many key Texas races	GOV D	Lt. GOV D	CD 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 16, 21, 23, 27, 29, 32
Beto O'Rourke has won the Democratic primary for US Senate in Texas
@nebhusker84 @gengsanc It is. What a crazy race that has been
Incumbent Dan Patrick has won the Texas Republican Lt. Gubernatorial Primary
In Massachusetts 3rd Essex Senate District, Democrat Brendan Crighton has defeated scattered write-ins to hold the seat
@gengsanc Yes and they'll all show up for O'Rourke in the general
@StuffJudeSays @HinghamCPAMom Nah O'Rourke is a sure bet here
@JosephMouser Yeah, holding judgment until the end. But he's under where you'd expect as of now
@iamdarylleon @BetoORourke Yes, he's grown since I tweeted about his low margin. Regardless, he should be at 70-75% given how much stronger of a candidate he is
@HinghamCPAMom @StuffJudeSays Yes but a lot is early vote. 1% of precincts but probably 20-30% of ballots
@ha2real14 Sema Hernandez, the left's pick and Edward Kimbrough, basically just a random retired postal worker
@StuffJudeSays 63.8%. Been going up with cities coming in
O'Rourke is going to get 50%, but margin is an interesting question
@StuffJudeSays O'Rourke will win. Margin is the question
@trump_nazi He will. Margin just a bit smaller right now than one would think
Beto O'Rourke isn't doing as well as he should in this primary. Bit weird
Incumbent Ted Cruz has won the Republican Senate primary in Texas
Incumbent Greg Abbott has won the Republican Gubernatorial primary in Texas
Also, we have two special elections tonight	-In Oklahoma House District 51, Republican Brad Boles is the favorite in a Trump +65 district. Would be a hold if he won	-In Massachusetts Senate District, Democrat Brendan Crighton is unopposed
Will be bringing back our second account, @electionnight18, to post every result from tonight. Give it a follow for local races, as this page will just be federal races!
Previews for 24 of Texas's house races. @RRHElections has a good write up which includes several of the ones I didn't get to. https://t.co/JATEM0fFTb
Sorry to say I wasn't able finish previewing every Texas House race. Looks like I'll only have 2/3rds done before poll closing time. Sorry guys
Interesting to see how this plays out. Likely means McDaniel moves to here as well as any viable Democratic candidate. Wicker probably goes unopposed now https://t.co/tL7SI9Cyfn

NE-02 https://t.co/UrQREXzioh
*Starts and builds
@lvandle Yes the Democrats still control just over half. But they controlled over 70% not too long ago
This is a sign of how to create long term Democratic momentum. Even if you don't win, contesting a local seat starts builds engagement among your base https://t.co/WgDWLinoor
@trump_nazi @galizerigfanda Yeah it will help him overall. Florida GOP not incredibly popular right now
@trump_nazi @galizerigfanda Montana will stay Democratic. Tester is a fantastic candidate. Arizona is possible depending on the GOP primary. Tennessee is difficult but entirely impossible
@trump_nazi @galizerigfanda Yeah I'd say between 20-40 is the best estimate for Democratic house pickups right now. On the senate, I'd agree with +1 for the Republicans. Definitely think they'll gain back Indiana, maybe Missouri, North Dakota, or Florida as well. Nevada is flipping blue however.
Democratic primary results from #AZ08 last night	Hiral Tipirneni: 21,703 (59.6%)	Brianna Westbrook: 14,701 (40.4%)
@wanderingpol You're welcome. Glad to keep people informed about a passion of mine!
@lvandle Yeah in comparison to where it was a few years ago
@wanderingpol 6 in 2018 and 33 in 2017
@galizerigfanda @trump_nazi Would agree with that as of now
Full Results from last night's #AZ08 Republican primary	Debbie Lesko: 25,508 (35.8%)	Phil Lovas 17,031 (23.9%)	Steve Montenegro: 16,987 (23.8%)	Bob Stump: 3,832 (5.4%)	Clair Van Steenwyk: 1,692 (2.4%	David Lien: 1,261 (1.8%)	Richard Mack: 1,014 (1.4%)	Others: 2,625 (3.6%)
Looks like Arizona might not give us anything else until tomorrow. Barring something crazy, it will be Debbie Lesko and Hiral Tipirneni in the April general election
@trump_nazi If Arpaio wins, it's a Democratic flip. If Ward wins, it could go either way but I'd slightly favor Sinema
@trump_nazi Absolutely. Would say Martha McSally's AZ-02 district leans Democratic with McSally running for Senate
@trump_nazi Most likely stays Republican. Least likely to flip out of the three special elections before November
Legislative primary winners tonight:	RI SD8 D: Sandro Cano	RI SD8 R: Nathan Luciano	SC HD69 R: Runoff between Chris Wooten and Anne Marie Eckstorm Green
@trump_nazi AP has only called the Democratic primary to Tipirneni. No word on the Republican side
A massive early vote dump from #AZ08 gives Debbie Lesko and Hiral Tipirneni early leads in their respective primaries
@wanderingpol Yes, I tweet the results of every election. The Republicans have only flipped 4 seats in 2017 and 0 so far in 2018, so I haven't tweeted many Republican flips
@politicsluo Less establishment but pretty much the same policy-wise
Alabama Runoff Winners tonight, both results were upsets	SD26 D Runoff: David Burkette	HD4 R Runoff: Parker Moore
Yes, this as well. District has leaned red downballot for a while https://t.co/SN1pNCsLEW
This Connecticut flip is a big one for Democrats. Yes, it was a district which Hillary Clinton won, but Republicans control over 30 of those. The state has been trending hard right, and this helps add a bit more room to a narrow Democratic Majority, which now stands at 80-71
@politicsluo *Hannity begins investigating Democratic cloning scandal*
RT @politicsluo: @electionwatchus both are democrats and both are state houses, too.
Two men named Phil flipped two different state legislative seats in New England tonight. What are the odds of that?

FLIP ALERT: In Connecticut House District 120, Democrat Phil Young has narrowly won and will flip the seat. This is the 6th flipped seat of 2018 for the Democratic Party
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa "Both been succeeded" lol
@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Very biased as a Vermonter but it's an incredibly interesting state as it's the only state with a relevant third party. Also I think the fact that both Bernie Sanders and Phil Scott are popular is interesting. Firebrand idealism and compromising centrism have both been succeeded

Full Results from Kentucky House District 89:	Robert Goforth (R): 2,809 (66.8%) -3.4% HOLD	Kelly Smith (D): 1,399 (33.2%) +3.4%
In Kentucky House District 89, Republican Robert Goforth has won to hold the seat for his party
@monica_scalpato Ballotpedia has a list of state legislative Special Elections. @DKElections is a good resource as well
@politicsluo @nytimes https://t.co/iqBCzacUga
@politicsluo @nytimes I'm 90% sure they will. it's on their election results calendar
@politicsluo It is very up in the air. Will be a good test of whether Clinton/Trump or 2016 district race is a better indicator
@politicsluo Very possible, that's why I put it as a Tossup. I'm just not sure Connecticut has the same Democratic energy as the rest of the country
@realityfan729 2012 Cruz Senate Election	Ted Cruz (R): 56.5% (-5.2%)	Paul Sadler (D): 40.6% (+4.6%)		2016 Presidential in Texas	Donald Trump (R): 52.2% (-5.0%)	Hillary Clinton (D): 43.2% (+1.8%)		Cruz losing is unlikely but possible in a wave election. Texas is clearly shifting blue in general
Full Preview of a busy day of elections tomorrow:	https://t.co/RFLKmoW8Wl
@jeffstrabone @MattStrabone Hmmm interesting. Could be a good preview of some contested house races in the area as well
@politicsluo Yeah Hood running could push this into a potentially similar scenario to Jones

Not related to elections but this is an incredible thing about my state https://t.co/fruIKG5R66
@jeffstrabone @MattStrabone Don't think I'll have time to cover the race too much, but I'll definitely read up on it. When is the election?
@angelsfan1982 2016 WI-1 House Election	Paul Ryan (R): 65.0% (+1.7%)	Ryan Solen (D): 30.2% (-6.4%)		2016 WI-1 Presidential Election	Donald Trump (R): 53% (+1%)	Hillary Clinton (D): 42% (-5%)		I'd expect a huge swing against Ryan this year. Potentially results close to 2016 Presidential numbers
@AaronD825 Every Democrat who was running for the seat is running again except State Representative Greg Vitali. Haven't heard much on the Republican side. Interest certainly dropping as it's kind of a lost cause
@Loripacker19438 Certainly. Would call it a tossup at this moment
@Sam_Brochin 2016 US House Result:	Lee Zeldin (R): 55.2% (+2.0%)	Anne Thorne-Holst (D): 39.6% (-5.0%)		2016 Presidential Result:	Donald Trump (R): 54% (+5%)	Hillary Clinton (D): 42% (-8%)		Expect Democrats will start to reverse shift right but might take until 2020 to win the seat
@Loripacker19438 Two ways to look at it. Roughly a 2% swing to Hillary Clinton from 2016, from Even to Clinton +2. Still +1 Republican leaning on PVI, down from +2 Was one of the districts that changed the least overall
Does anyone have races they are interested in seeing margin swings for? I'm bored and need entertainment

In Mississippi House District 60, Republicans Fred Shanks and Bob Morrow will advance to a runoff three weeks from now, ensuring a hold for their party
@MaaOther @therrera789 Regular state house elections in November. Belcher was elected tonight to finish a term that ends in January 2019. She has to hold the seat in November
@therrera789 @MaaOther Good news for Republicans is that she has a primary challenger in 2018. Bad news is that Belcher will be tough to beat in November
@therrera789 @MaaOther Yes although the risk was her running independent and splitting the vote otherwise
@therrera789 @MaaOther Yeah they didn't help themselves in an already tough race with that decision
@therrera789 @MaaOther I believe it is just top 2, no matter the percentage
@therrera789 https://t.co/LtK7UQHXpN
@MaaOther Still counting but looking like a runoff between two Republicans
@UWEair @ActorAaronBooth Ehhh I doubt too many Republicans go to Giles. Most should fall to Shanks or Morrow
@lupinus1234 Nothing yet. Polls closed rather recently
@ActorAaronBooth Morris Mock Jr. is the only Democrat. District probably too conservative for him to win	Jim Giles is a white nationalist. No way enough people vote for that, right?	That leaves Republicans Bob Morrow and Fred Shanks, who will both have backing from GOP establishment wings

@Humanitarian66 @ASauer8 Was relying on photos from reporters on site today. Nothing official was available until about 15 minutes ago
@RandySF45 Tbf they did choose a terrible candidate, but that doesn't make up the amount of vote Belcher gained
Full Results from Kentucky House District 49	Linda Belcher (D): 3386 (68.4%) +18.8% FLIP	Rebecca Johnson (R): 1561 (31.6%) -18.8%
Well, yes, but Trump's margin is irrelevant in this district. It's always been a 50-50 tossup district downballot. Don't get me wrong, the amount that Belcher won by is still very impressive, but let's not pretend this is a deep red district https://t.co/wPNZF2z7EJ
This is the 4th Democratic special election pickup in 2018 https://t.co/lijHh0qnYc
@ASauer8 Too early
FLIP ALERT: In Kentucky House District 49, Democrat Linda Belcher has secured a blowout victory to regain her former seat
@nyyankeesfan24 My basic view on the Senate is that Republicans remain heavily favored to retain control but Democrats have a clear path to victory

@angelsfan1982 Wait no Florida counts. Only Arkansas is a primary.
@angelsfan1982 No that was a general election, hence the talk about the Democrat flipping the seat. Oklahoma and Georgia were also general elections.
@angelsfan1982 Well they count but it's only to nominate the primaries. The next representatives for those seats won't be elected until May
@angelsfan1982 I mean these races are just primaries I wouldn't get scared over them
@angelsfan1982 Not completed yet
@ASauer8 She lost, which was expected given the district
In Oklahoma Senate District 27, Republican Casey Murdock has won to hold the seat for his party
In Georgia House District 175, Republican John Lahood has won with over 50% percent of the vote and will therefore avoid a runoff and hold the seat
@HallettJosh There are many ways they could lose the House imo. Senate will be very difficult to lose
@HallettJosh That's a bold statement. Smoked seems extreme. Floor is gaining about 10 House seats it seems

FLIP ALERT: In Florida House District 72, Democrat Margaret Good has won by a much wider than expected margin to flip the seat. This is the party's 3rd flip of 2018
@GraceJunSD No, in the country in general. Nothing scheduled in MN as of right now
More special election previews, this time for Tuesday https://t.co/TyhwwU8BS8
Probably the expected result from today's results, although Democrats will be slightly happier. Bad news for Republicans is that they won't have another shot at a Democratic seat until early April. During that time, they'll have to defend 12 seats, and are in danger of losing 3-5
Full Results from Minnesota Senate District 54	Karla Bigham (D): 7344 (50.7%) -2.5% HOLD	Denny McNamara (R): 6815 (47.1%) +0.3%	Emily Mellingen (L): 313 (2.2%) +2.2%	Write-In: 7

@savedemocracy18 Worth noting that Trump won this district, so a narrow hold is kind of what you'd expect in this climate
First of many times this will happen in 2018 https://t.co/0ilJTLt9g2
@ha2real14 How do you figure? That's not high, especially in a somewhat low turnout election. Also probably looking at a slightly smaller margin when the last precinct reports.
In Minnesota Senate District 54, Democrat Karla Bigham has narrowly won to hold the seat for her party
@ASauer8 Democrat winning but not by a wide margin
In Minnesota House District 23B, Republican Jeremy Munson has won to hold the seat for his party
Still looking like things will hold to partisan lean of the seats as of now https://t.co/2YNGcKs4sh
@beardedcrank Thanks!
@andrew_striedl Thank you!

Good piece of news for Democrats in SD54. Also true for HD23B but it almost definitely won't be enough https://t.co/rpt1x2jB9t
So far both elections in Minnesota staying at the normal lean of the district. Would mean two holds if this continues
Previews for tomorrow's special elections https://t.co/NaAGjhqbIY
RT @Redistrict: This map sacrifices #PA07 to Dems, but otherwise it's just a less aggressive GOP gerrymander. https://t.co/FXVKS1RBDf
@resist_2018 Yes I think it's defintely a mixture today. The question is what percent of the results are about Greitens. I'd say 70% enthusiasm, 30% Greitens. But that 30% was enough to push Revis over the top in HD97
@nebhusker84 Yes what I don't like about interpreting these results is the Greitens factor. But there is definitely a consistent swing towards the left evident in the midwest right now
@Lmzeigler91606 Yeah they are. Defending Revis's new seat will be difficult for Democrats but they have an incumbency foothold now
I think these elections today are very interesting, but much more for the political climate in Missouri, not so much the nation. However, next week there are three bellwether type races for the midterms in Minnesota and Florida
@andrew_striedl Yes, just barely though. And only 6 behind Trump, which is smaller than all of the other 3 elections.
This election gives Democrats a blueprint to the type of campaign you need to run to win back working class Trump areas and it was very interesting to see the similarities between this election and the upcoming PA18 election. Mike Revis and Conor Lamb are very similar candidates
Finally, specifically regarding the flip in HD97, it's an impressive flip and there's more to this than a general shift left and Greitens. The Republican candidate was out of touch and focused on the wrong issues and the Democrats capitalized with a strong candidate in Mike Revi
Greitens is a major thorn in the side of the MO GOP at this point. If you look at the margin shift in special elections, Democrats were 4-5 points more successful today than in 2017. Democrats probably won't win back the chamber in Missouri in 2018, but probably will gain seats
Thread of general thoughts from an in interesting group of elections today in Missouri. First, I think this election is a terrible midterm indicator. Much more about local issues than national issues
@andrew_striedl Yes although it was in 2012 when the district was more red. Regardless, this is by far the best result for Republicans tonights. Democrats would have hoped for a much smaller margin
Full Results from Missouri House District 144	Chris Dinkins (R): 2,998 (52.6%) -13.2% HOLD	Jim Scaggs (D): 2,699 (47.4%) +13.2%

Full results from Missouri House District 129	Jeff Knight (R): 2,153 (69.1%) -14.0% HOLD	Ronna Ford (D): 963 (30.9%) +14.0%
FLIP ALERT: In Missouri House District 97, Democrat Mike Revis has narrowly won to flip the seat in a somewhat red district. This is the Democratic Party's second flip of 2018
In Missouri House District 129, Republican Jeff Knight has won to hold the seat for his party

In Florida Senate District 31, Lori Berman has won the Democratic primary and will face Republican Tami Donnally on April 10
Yes Frelinghuysen is NJ11. Apologies for the error in the tweet. NJ02 is a very similar seat which is also worth watching tho https://t.co/52JGBK73zj
In Minnesota State Senate District 54, Denny McNamara has won the Republican primary. He will face Democrat Karla Bigham and Libertarian Emily Mellingen on February 12
In Minnesota House District 23B Republican Jeremy Munson has won his party's primary. He will face Democrat Melissa Wagner on February 12
Nothing to be very surprised about here, except slightly for Casey voting yes https://t.co/ig7RILHkgy
A couple GOP legislative primaries happening today in Minnesota in a rare Monday election. Will tweet out results when available
Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen of NJ02 will not run in 2018. This makes for a very close election in a seat Donald Trump only won by one point
Likely won't matter in the long run as PA07 will likely be Democratic after redistricting https://t.co/fcaqt4dVOw
Joe Kennedy III will give the Democratic response to the State of the Union. This is the start of him becoming a very serious 2020 contender
In Tennessee Senate District 14, Shane Reeves has won the Republican primary and will face Democrat Gayle Jordan on March 13
Kansas Republican Governor Sam Brownback was confirmed as Ambassador to Religious Freedom by a party lines 50-49 vote this afternoon. As a result, Kansas will soon have a new Governor in Jeff Colyer
@PhoenixWomanMN Yes he definitely did. Another positive swing for Democrats in a special election

Yes, but this is a misleading headline. There were three possible answers to this poll: Democrats, Trump, and Republicans. More than half blame either Trump or Republicans. In other words, everyone is blaming the other party and this hasn't changed anything https://t.co/ivqyomytK3

@ASauer8 Very likely. Schumer is excellent at controlling the way his party votes

Going through initial roll call now
Senate vote will start shortly. Expect it to fail
@Mrs_Schwarzski Exactly. When Democrats NEED their votes they will get them

@DeuceTheSalty No this is state legislative. More local than US Senate
This result in Wisconsin is especially good for Democrats since Schachtner will hold the seat until 2020. Wisconsin Senate is now 18-14, with one vacancy, giving Democrats a conceivable opportunity to flip the chamber
Additionally, In Wisconsin Assembly District 66, Democrat Greta Neubauer was unopposed and will officially hold the seat.
FLIP ALERT: In Wisconsin State Senate District 10, Democrat Patty Schachtner has won a special election to flip the seat. This is the first legislative seat to flip in 2018 and a bit of a surprise in a GOP leaning district
@luongochristop1 Well the outstanding GOP district dropped and Schachtner won it, so not much longer.
Wow. Apparently Schachtner has won GOP-leaning St. Croix County. This seat is going to flip barring something crazy. https://t.co/VD8OA4Yd8I
In Iowa House District 6, Republican Jacob Bossman has won to hold the seat for his party
@luongochristop1 There is no official WI SOS count but there are results by individual county, which makes a cumulative total tough. What's important is margins and basically Ds are much better than they need in the two D counties and right where they need in 2 R counties
@luongochristop1 The biggest county is still out and it leans R. Would say 55% chance Schachtner wins but it's basically a tossup
If anything would say Schachtner (D) is the slight favorite https://t.co/7POzsWV3UQ
SD10 still looks very close
@nebhusker84 Yes I agree. District very easily could have slipped, although don't put too much weight into my special election predictions. Too based on hunches to be an indicator of anything.
In Wisconsin State House District 58, no surprises as Republican Rick Gundrum has won to hold the seat.

@Cat19Green Hard to say. They really shouldn't win any of these seats given their Republican lean. However, a win in Iowa HD6 is very possible, and there are long shot opportunities in Wisconsin SD10 and South Carolina HD99. Hard to see a path to victory in Wisconsin HD58
Also could cause multiple flips to Democrats in special elections if they become referendums on impeachment https://t.co/GoIbORJfT3
This story is really flying under the radar which is surprising given how disturbing these allegations are. Bit of a setback for Republicans in Missouri.

Wow. Very good news for Democrats as this was the GOP seat with the closest margin last year. Our initial rating is Lean D https://t.co/aFQAxlvqD6

In Georgia Senate District 17, Brian Strickland has won the election outright and will hold the seat without a runoff
SOS mistake has been fixed. SD17 looks almost certain to be won outright by Strickland (R). HD111 looks very close. Question is whether Geoffrey Cauble (R) manages 50% (at 50.1% right now). If he doesn't, runoff will be almost definitely be between him and El-Mahdi Holly (D).
@RandySF45 @MaaOther @catscatscatz I don't think they are unenthused either. Just less enthused
Apparently there might be a mistake in the count on the Georgia SOS count. Will try to figure this out now https://t.co/l5LYiRUtTX

@blaireinfeldt Yes
@PeachResist https://t.co/hpGS3pQvIE
@MaaOther @RandySF45 @catscatscatz Definitely but in theory low turnout leans D in most cases because of enthusiasm gap
@RandySF45 Yes that is a possibility. We'll see though because I think both races are far from over.
@RandySF45 @catscatscatz 75% white. Mostly a moderate suburb, which is the type of districts Ds have over-performed in recently
@RandySF45 In terms of early vote leaning towards GOP?
@RandySF45 @catscatscatz Agreed but this shouldn't be one of those places. Clinton won HD111 and was somewhat close in SD17
@alexobe11 https://t.co/hpGS3pQvIE
@catscatscatz Georgia SD17 and HD111. Underperforming Clinton significantly in early vote
Early vote not looking good for Democrats in both races. They have to hope their voters turned out in numbers on election day

@lupinus1234 Probably not. It only passed 81-63. Not all VT Democrats in lock step on this. There's some hope among them that Scott will support it. If he supports it he runs away with the 2018 election. I'd say it's 50-50 whether he vetoes

In South Carolina House District 56, Republican Tim McGinnis has defeated a few scattered write-in votes to secure a GOP hold		Full Results:	Tim McGinnis (R): 299 (97.7%) -1.8% HOLD	Write-Ins: 7 (2.3%) +1.7%
Republican Representative Bill Shuster of #PA09 will not run for reelection. His seat is currently rated Safe R. Shuster is the 39th representative to announce that they aren't running in 2018 and the 25th Republican to do so
Good work as always by @RRHElections on the Utah Senate race https://t.co/gBXUyrXhNO
Mitt Romney has got to be the strong favorite to win this seat now https://t.co/eN64FO8MZb
Today is the first legislative special election of 2018. Republican Tim McGinnis is running unopposed in South Carolina House District 56 and should have no problem defeating scattered write-in votes
@mrredt Yeah kind of my thoughts as well. If it didn't decide the chamber I'd say give it to Yancey but this is too important
Oof. Awarding this to Yancey is an extremely questionable decision by the judge. There's no possible way to tell who this person wanted to vote for https://t.co/W2iMBYEvE8
The judge in the court case in Virginia House District 94 determined that a contested ballot will be counted for the Republican David Yancey. The race is now tied and there'll be a long process which could go either way, which is exactly why we didn't call this race yesterday https://t.co/Zvj6ImqfxK
Just to clarify this is for special elections only. Doesn't include Virginia and New Jersey
@jeffstrabone Just special elections. Wasn't clear about that
@Cat19Green Should have said special elections. That's all I was talking about
In Wisconsin Senate District 10, Republican Adam Jarchow and Democrat Patty Schachtner have won their respective primaries. They be joined by Libertarian Brian Corriea in a January 16 general election.
In Wisconsin Assembly District 66, Greta Neubauer has won the Democratic primary. Barring a write-in campaign, she has also won the seat given that the only two candidates to file were Democrats
In Wisconsin Assembly District 58, Rick Gundrum has won the Republican primary and will face Democrat Dennis Degenhardt on January 16.
*Bredesen lol https://t.co/f89V8xLfeL
With all 98 state legislative elections in 2017 completed, here are some stats:	-45 D seats and 53 R seats were up for grabs.	-Ds won 56 and the Rs won 42.	-14 seats flipped from R to D. 3 from D to R.	-Ds flipped 4 seats each in OK and NH and 3 in GA
@UWEair Yeah suburbs swinging left is a major concern for GOP. Puts a lot of currently Lean R districts such as KS-03 and GA-06 in doubt for 2018.
Full Results from Tennessee Senate District 17	Mark Pody (R): 5,990 (51.3%) -11.3% HOLD	Mary Alice Carfi (D): 5,682 (48.7%) +11.3%	*Margins from last competitive election in SD17
Yes. Margins look very bad for TN Republicans. Phil Bresden might have a better shot than anticipated in the Senate race. https://t.co/bqCgKijOoN
In Tennessee State Senate District 17, Republican Mark Pody has very narrowly won to hold the seat for his party
In Mississippi Senate District 49, Republican Joel Carter has defeated two fellow party members to officially hold the seat for his party
@SalT25a That's unlikely given that the Republican got over 50%
Full Results from Florida HD58	Lawrence McClure (R): 7,585 (54.5%) -4.0% HOLD	Jose Vazquez (D): 4,706 (33.81%) -7.69%	Ahmad Hussam Saadaldin (G): 1,184 (8.51%) +8.51%	Bryan Zemina (L): 443 (3.18%) +3.18%
Incredible work by @HillsboroughSOE. All votes were counted and uploaded in 20 minutes from poll closing time. Very impressive!
In Florida House District 58, Republican Lawrence McClure has won to hold the seat for his party
@nebhusker84 They definitely. Losing the SD17 race would be a catastrophe given that it went so heavily to Trump
Brief reminder of what races are going on tonight. FL HD58, MS SD49, and TN SD17 all in play. https://t.co/4y4GZFeHWQ
We are not calling this yet. Possibly will call tomorrow but too much uncertainty surrounding a one vote advantage https://t.co/rbIzjOwcik
RT @reemadamin: Recount unofficial results: Simonds has 11608, Yancey has 11607. Simonds is the unofficial winner.
JUST IN: Democrat Shelly Simonds has won by one vote in a recount in Virginia House District 94. These results have to be certified and there's a decent chance of legal action from the GOP. If this holds, the Virginia House of Delegates will be deadlocked at 50-50.
@luongochristop1 Either late today or early tomorrow. It looks like it will be really close, which could cause a bunch of lawsuits preventing anyone from being seated
Huge recount in Virginia today. David Yancey (R) had only a 10 vote lead in this race and his advantage is already down to 5. If Shelly Simonds (D) manages to win, the VA House of Delegates will sit at 50-50 https://t.co/hiq4jhmIFO

In Iowa Senate District 3, Republican Jim Carlin has narrowly won to hold the seat for his party
@Cat19Green It wasn't so much his backroom staff behind the scenes, but he constantly compounded his problems with questionable statements such as his slavery comments. I think he might have done better if he had laid low for 5 weeks
@Cat19Green Getting accused of pedophilia, poor fundraising, and repeated dumb statements
@nebhusker84 For sure. You never know
The difference between the two candidates in the Alabama Senate was that Doug Jones ran a great campaign and Roy Moore ran one of the worst campaigns of all time
@AaronD825 Moore is one of the all time worst candidates. But it's still a Democratic win in Alabama
Stunning result in Alabama: Alabama Democratic Senator Doug Jones. Who thought we would say this a few months ago?

Democrats appear to have avoided a bad result in Atlanta, with Keisha Lance Bottoms up by about 700 https://t.co/NCmwpVsxYu
In Georgia Senate District 39, Democrat Nikema Williams has narrowly defeated a fellow Democrat in a runoff to hold the seat
@nebhusker84 Yes, although we knew this seat would flip since two democrats emerged from the November top 2 primary. Bigger win for Democrats would be a Keisha Bottoms win in the Atlanta mayoral election
In Georgia House District 60, Democrat Kim Schofield has defeated a fellow Democrat in a runoff to hold the seat
*33rd https://t.co/Ozx34S33t5
@Cat19Green Yep. 15 in Virginia, 4 in New Jersey, plus 14 special election wins. So, actually 33 is the correct number. My mistake

@lupinus1234 Bit surprising but a lot of it down to an unusually strong GOP candidate in a small district
@lupinus1234 Still waiting. No SOS tabulation so it's tough. Will post as soon as available

In Florida House District 72, Margaret Good has won the Democratic primary. She will face Republican James Buchanan and Libertarian Alison Foxall on February 13

What should our endorsement policy be?
@Decision_Desk Oops. That was a typo. I definitely do know where this District is since my grandparents reside there. Glad you liked the article!
I just published “12/5/17 Legislative Special Election Previews” https://t.co/IiZc1OqHS9
I think Conyers is going to resign tomorrow, likely citing health issues or something along those lines. Whether Kihuen and Farenthold resign is definitely in doubt https://t.co/PYMVtKfnCQ
So currently 3 members of congress are being pressured to resign for sexual harassment: Conyers (D-MI), Kihuen (D-NV), and Farenthold (R-TX)
@Cat19Green Louisiana House District 42, where the Democrats didn't run a candidate and New Jersey Senate District 2
(2/2)	-CT Governor Dan Malloy has called a special election to replace Democrat David Baram in Assembly District 15 for January 9 	-FL Governor Rick Scott has set a special election to replace Republican Neil Combee in State House District 39 for May 1, with a February 20 primary
Other special election news from recent days (1/2):	-A special election in Tennessee Senate District 14 to replace Republican Jim Tracy will be March 13, with a January 25 primary	-Democrat Raul Bocanegra has resigned from the California assembly, triggering a special election
Mississippi Senate District 10 flip to the GOP continues a trend of Democrats underperforming expectations in Mississippi special elections, bucking the Democratic trend of much of the rest of the nation in recent special elections

RLCC is taking credit so safe to assume Whaley will officially caucus with the GOP. This is their 3rd legislative flip of 2017 https://t.co/qyOertzEDi

In South Carolina State House District 99, Republican Nancy Mace has won in a primary runoff and will be the GOP nominee in a January 16 general election against Democrat Cindy Boatwright. She will be favored to hold the seat for her party.
Remember to vote if you live in Mississippi HD54 or SD10

@Decision_Desk Also if you want to have a discussion on any topic dm me. I enjoy talking politics with anyone who's passionate about politics even if we disagree on some things
@Decision_Desk Fair enough. My advice as someone who has been doing this for a year. Just use your personal account to debate politics. Was a mistake on my part to open a can of worms with the original tweet. Not something I do often but felt it was necessary at the time
@Decision_Desk A) I'm not a decision desk. Most of the stuff I do is analysis.	B) Please don't lecture me on election coverage. You hide your obvious bias by claiming you are a non partisan group, but a quick look at your replies to Guadagno and others show you have a clear conservative slant
@Decision_Desk But if you play the "it was just a joke" argument you're doing what people defending Franken are doing regarding the photo. I believe Franken's accuser is believable even though she has worked for Fox News and I believe Trump's accusers are reputable even though some are Dems
In the Louisiana Treasurer's Race, Republican John Schroder has won with just under 60% of the vote. This is a GOP hold
@Decision_Desk Except a tape where he admits it
@Decision_Desk Also LA treasurer projection will likely be up in 5-10 minutes. State house projection already up
@Decision_Desk What's the factual difference between the cases though?	Trump has several accusers and strong evidence given the tape.	Spacey and Weinstein with several accusers and have practically admitted it by seeking treatment which makes for strong evidence
@Decision_Desk There's nothing proving Trump allegations are false though
In Louisiana House of Representatives District 77, Republican Mark Wright has defeated fellow party member Rob Maness in a runoff election. This holds the seat for his party
@Decision_Desk I mean yeah...They have also been accused of sexual harassment. So has Trump though. You can't pick and choose whose allegations to believe
@Decision_Desk Trump has been accused of sexual harassment many times. So has Bill Clinton. You say Clinton is a disgusting pig based on allegation but that Trump allegations are false when there is literally a tape of him admitting it. That's the height of bias. You sure you're nonpartisan?
Polls have closed in Louisiana, where there is a treasurer's race and a state house special election runoff between two republicans
@UWEair Yep
3) Way too much hypocrisy on both sides. No difference between Franken and Trump allegations. Either condemn both or neither.	(2/2)
My two cents on the Al Franken situation.	1) He should resign	2) What Franken did was wrong but don't compare him to Roy Moore. Franken committed an inappropriate act on an adult. Moore committed an inappropriate act on a child.	(1/2)
Correction: Margin was 2,234-2,203 in SD37
Full results from Oklahoma elections tonight	SD37	Allison Ikley-Freeman (D): 2,334 (50.35%)	Brian O'Hara (R): 2,303 (49.65%)		SD45:	Paul Rosino (R): 2,817 (56.78%)	Steven Vincent (D): 2,144 (43.22%)		HD76:	Ross Ford (R): 1,544 (68.35%)	Chris Vanlandingham (D): 715 (31.65%)
Will likely be a recount, but looks like a big win for OK Democrats. +41 shift left from Trump-Clinton. +15 from the most recent election in this district https://t.co/TalDmfzrVD
FLIP ALERT: In Oklahoma Senate District 37, Democrat Allison Ikley-Freeman appears to have won by 31 votes. This is the Democrats' 4th legislative flip in Oklahoma this year and 32nd total.
@JoshHo8 There was a glitch in the Oklahoma SOS system which caused conflicting reports. Accidentally said all precincts were counted when 2 remained.
With 1 precinct left, this number has grown to just 14, with the Democrat winning https://t.co/viQdKGaubh
Reminder of why your vote counts. With 3 precincts remaining the margin is just 7 votes in Oklahoma SD37
In Oklahoma House of Representatives District 76, Republican Ross Ford has won to hold the seat for his party
In Oklahoma State Senate District 45, Republican Paul Rosino has won to hold the seat for his party
Three special elections in Oklahoma tonight in State Senate Districts 37 and 45 and House District 76. All three solidly Republican seats that are in danger given the trend against Oklahoma Republicans. SD37 the most likely to flip on paper, followed by SD45 and HD76 in no order
State Representative Rick Saccone is the Republican nominee for the #PA18 special election
@iamdarylleon In theory potential pedophilia should be more damaging. Moore still favored. If Jones pivots more to center he could have a great shot

Fourth: #UT03. Curtis (R) is going to win barring something historic. Expect he gets 55%, while Bennett (UUP) and Allen (D) split the rest
Third: #VAHoD. Democrats will win back seats without doubt. Think they come short of the majority though. I'll go with 45/100 seats for them
Second: #VAGov. It's going to be close. Polls tell us that Northam (D) is a very slight favorite. I think he wins by 1-2 points
First off: #NJGov. It's almost certainly going to be Murphy (D) who wins, I'll go with a 12 point win
Predictions thread because why not make people mad at me?
We're posting every result on @electionday2017. Give it a follow!
#ElectionDay throughout the country. Remember to vote

@DemLibs Definitely. Good thing for politics in general to have more candidates running. Forces politicians to earn votes from constituents
Relevant to VA elections https://t.co/SI6LiyQpjb
@DemLibs 71/100 seats had one major party not run a candidate in 2015. That number is around 40 this year
VA Democrats will enter Tuesday with an early 22-10 lead from unopposed seats. Keep this in mind when interpreting early VA house results

In the Alabama senate primary, we are definitely headed to a runoff between Roy Moore and Luther Strange on September 26
Surprised they waited so long. Both us and @DecisionDeskHQ had called this an hour ago. It was pretty clear... https://t.co/cK1kxMIbzq
Mo Brooks is done. Moore/Strange runoff 90% probability. Maybe a 10% chance at best Moore wins outright
On the Republican side in Alabama, it's still somewhat undecided, though a runoff involving Roy Moore looks very likely
In the Alabama Senate race, all signs are pointing to a Doug Jones outright win of 55-60% on the Democratic side
In Florida House District 44, Bobby Olszewski has won the Republican primary. He will face Democrat Paul Chandler on October 15
@EricW573 This is true, but Jones will get a lot of African American votes due to his publicized role in prosecuting the KKK
@EricW573 Would agree with that. I just think Kennedy has a ceiling around 40%, whereas Jones could climb to 50 if no Kennedy people turn out
@EricW573 At the end of the day, Kennedy has spent way too little to get past 40% at most imo
@EricW573 Many people who said Kennedy were likely not following and just thought the name Robert Kennedy sounded appealing (2/2)
@EricW573 Let me rephrase: Anyone who was voting Jones in polls is paying some degree of attention to the race and will vote (1/2)
@EricW573 Disagree. People who said they would vote for Kennedy in polls less likely to show up. Would assume many went on name alone
@RogerBurnsNYC Maybe but I would argue that the closest Brooks has been to Strange is 3% away while the closest Moore has been to 50% is 12% away
In the case of Jones/Other, a surge by Michael Hansen would be the most likely scenario https://t.co/qxDu9tw966
#ALSEN DEM outcomes ranked by likeliness	1. Jones/Kennedy runoff	2. Jones wins outright	3. Kennedy wins outright	4. Jones/Other runoff

@HasanAli1984 Yes Manchin could be in more danger if Trump were to campaign for his opponent (likely to be Rep. Evan Jenkins)
@HasanAli1984 Of those 6 Manchin is the only one who isn't very vulnerable in my opinion. Flake could be primaried, if he is the GOP is likely to hold AZ
@HasanAli1984 More seats that will flip will emerge after primaries. Until then most incumbents favored
@HasanAli1984 Senate could go anywhere from 56-44 to 50-50. Very interesting rn
@ioannespastor This is a historically tough map for the Democrats. The projection will narrow but without a clear challenger most incumbents favored

Excited to announce that we'll have a couple medium posts coming out this weekend about some important upcoming elections this year
In Iowa State House District 22, Republican Jon Jacobsen has won a 3-way race the hold the seat for his party
Cindy Friedman has won the MA State Senate Fourth Middlesex District Democratic primary. She will face the Green Party's Ian Jackson on 7/25
The Democratic primary candidates in the 4th Middlesex State Senate District of MA are Cindy Friedman, Sean Garballey, and Mary Ann Stewart
The candidates in Iowa State House District 22 are:	R: Jon Jacobsen	L: Bryan Holder	I: Carol Forristall	D: Ray Stevens (write-in)
There are 2 state legislative special elections today:	Iowa State House District 22	MA State Senate Fourth Milddlesex District (D primary)
This 5-0 in special elections claim that Republicans have been making is hilariously false. Republican candidate only got 4% in #CA34 https://t.co/JvfR9mWBuK
South Carolina was actually more winnable because Rs weren't motivated to turn out there
Ossoff ended at 48.1%, which is the same as round 1. I think that's the best a Democrat can do in this district right now
My takeaway from last night: Ossoff  ran out of Democratic voters to turn out. Couldn't pick up any margin from primary to runoff
It's pretty much over in #GA06. Handel has a 99% chance of winning
In South Carolina House of Representatives District 70, Democrat Wendy Brawley has won to hold the seats for the Democrats
In #SC05, Republican Ralph Norman will be the winner by a narrower margin than expected

Republican Kevin Vaughn has won the special election in Tennessee House Of Representatives District 95. This is a GOP hold
12/18 precincts in and Kevin Vaughn's lead in #TN95 is now 1146
@UWEair No. Vaughn is leading by a lot. Meant that she narrowed the gap
6/18 precincts in. Vaughn extends his lead to 953
First E-Day precinct reports in #TN95. Democrat Julie Byrd Ashworth gains 20 votes on Kevin Vaughn. Total now stands at 1,846-926
First reports (all absentee) from #TN95 show Republican Kevin Vaughn with a 1,784-844 lead over Democrat Julie Byrd Ashworth
@muvipsycanalyst Do you have a sense of the race status? From what I know this is a solid R district that has been made closer by a strong D challenge
We are following tonight's state house special election in #TN95. Will post updates when we have them. Expected R hold, but you never know

Democrats have now gained 2 legislative seats in 2017 (both tonight) via special elections while Republicans have gained 1
This victory by Pellegrino is a significant turnaround for a district that voted 60-37 in favor of Donald Trump
