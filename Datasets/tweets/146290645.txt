Ok, so I'll concede that Rachel Maddow may actually have something real to talk about tonight.
Israel and the U.S. have so many joint military exercises that it really doesn't matter who fired the missiles...this is all coordinated by Trump and Netanyahu. It's just like when Iran says they had nothing to do with the Houthi rebels firing missiles in Yemen. **wink** **wink**
Maybe Trump and the US are so fed up with Russia in Syria that even if they did attack Homs...they would deny it. I mean Assad and Putin deny everything, including chemical attacks, so why not take a page out of their playbook? #Israel #Iran
I feel like if Donald Trump met with Assad that the Syrian dictator would convince him that the rebels in Syria are BAD, BAD hombres.
