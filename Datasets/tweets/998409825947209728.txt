If the El Chapo Act is not passed, either @realDonaldTrump must declare a national emergency with legal justification for doing so or @TheDemocrats need to step up and work with @GOP and our President to provide funds for the border wall.
It is unfortunate federal workers are currently not being paid during this government shut down. However, while federal workers are experiencing negative short term effects, not being paid, I appreciate @realDonaldTrump’s persistence to build this wall while protecting Americans.

Peaceful protests are not always completely “peaceful”. Hateful rhetoric and language may be used and that needs to change. We need to understand and educate each other. We must unite as a country if we want a better future for America. ☝️✨
(2/2) We are all people and if we are going to be hateful, we need to be held accountable. It is unfortunate that many police officers’ biases get in the way of doing their job and that needs to be changed. I know I’ve been biased and I must always acknowledge  it.
(1/2) People need to be held accountable for their hateful actions and it is unfortunate that people are not held accountable. I don’t take into account someone’s skin color or any other identity when hate is perpetuated onto someone else.
I strongly believe that if we want to change the system to better represent and serve our country democrats and republicans both need to stop attacking each other, start to understand each other and work together. They may seem radical, but I believe it’s possible. #OurFuture
(3/3) In my opinion, confronting hate with hate doesn’t solve anything, but if you believe that is what will work for you, that is your opinion and I will respect your point of view.

(7/7) Let’s work together!
(6/7) . . . Confronting hate with hate won’t solve any problems. I think that just further divided us, others may think differently. That is ok too. I think I am learning more about who I am every day. More to be revealed I guess.
(5/7) . . .about who I am. I will always be changing in some form I believe. If I am being perceived as “talking down” to those who hate trump, I’m not trying to? I’m just stating what I believe and attacking each other won’t solve any problems.
(4/7) . . .or a republican or whatever, it doesn’t mean they will be that way for the rest of their lives, maybe they will maybe they won’t. I don’t find it necessary to place myself under a category, in a box or put a label on it. I’m just being myself and more and more I learn
(3/7) . . .I am not going to change because someone doesn’t like it. Let’s have a conversation and better understand each other. It is the only way we can understand each other so I believe, and maybe others don’t believe that. That is ok. If someone’s identifies as a Democrat. .
(2/7) . . .I’ve been thinking about. I was very much close minded on the left you could say without even realizing it. I don’t want to be that way anymore. People don’t have to support how I feel or what I’m doing. They don’t even have to understand, but at the end of the day. .
(1/7) Through some of my own experiences, this past year actually, I have learned that being unwilling to work together and running from issues justified that I’m “doing what’s right” is not useful nor is it helpful. It could makes matters worse? Who knows. It is something. . .
Do Democrats want the Supreme Court pick to wait until November because they don’t have control of the senate? If they had control of the senate after November, would they consider the Republican view in making that decision?
People need to work together across the aisle to make this a more just and equal nation. The left isn’t going to solve the great problems of our nation on their own nor will the right. We must do better and work together. Resistance is not the answer. #HappyFourthOfJuly 🇺🇸✨ https://t.co/IRnTXEo1d0

Is it wrong to listen to people who have very different views then you to better understand them?
Is resistance effective? Does it help people accomplish what they are trying to?
A big problem we have in America is people who are against Trump and who blatantly direct hate towards Trump and his supporters are not able to back up their actions and what they say. They are acting no better.
Most people who make judgements aren’t even educated on certain issues, and I can say I’m guilty of doing this myself. It is important to learn from our mistakes and do better. At least that is what I am trying to do.
I just don’t understand how people navigate the world hating each other, thinking they are doing what’s right. Their behavior is divisive. It is not creating unity amongst people in our country and it is not generating solutions.

Thank you @SenatorTimScott for speaking with @realDonaldTrump! It is important we have conversations with each other to better understand each other’s perspective. Together we can work toward a better America every day! Please keep having conversations! They are so important! ✊
Having difficult conversations is important! Keep having conversations Sen. Tim Scott!! #workingtogether https://t.co/EnQZwRkIHW
I want to live in a country where people are willing to listen to each other. I don’t want to live in a country where special interest groups are attacking each other just because they don’t agree. Work together, understand each other and create policies that reflect America. ✊
Politicians attacking each other does not solve problems. We must seek to understand each other, seek to know the truth and seek to create solutions together. We must come together as a country and work together. We will always remain divided if we can’t work together. Period.
As a gay man in the LGBTQIA+ community, I do not support anti-Trump organizations. I do not want to support division in our country. I may not agree with a person’s actions, but I must be willing to educate them and understand why they took the actions they have taken. ✨

(1/3) From my own experience, I have let my emotions overcome me politically. When we let our emotions overcome us, we start to stray away from the truth and facts so I believe. At the end of the day, we need to look at the facts and the truth in every situation, not sit in. . .
Anyone has the right to express themselves however they want. The questions I have started to ask myself more now are: Is the way I’m expressing myself helpful or am I just fueling a “problem”? Am I working towards a solution or making the “problem” worse? Is my activism helping?

Work together to fix the “broken system”. We must stop attacking each other and start to listen to one another. Yes, I understand some people can be very hateful, but until we can move deeper beyond their actions to understand and work together, there is no unity in America.
We must work together, regardless of our beliefs, to create policies through engaging our constituents. #publicengagement is so crucial in gaining the trust of the public. Public engagement makes our communities stronger. #mnleg #workingtogether #OneNationUnderGod #OneHumanity

(10/10) I am truly grateful for becoming the person I have always wanted to be my entire life. I am grateful that I can be who I am and be confident regardless of what other people think of me. God has given me a beautiful life. I never imagined life to be this fulfilling! Amen!
(9/10) . . .NEVER be happy seeking validation from external sources. More often than not I am afraid to go out to the gay bars and I am terrified to talk to men. Out of my own fear and insecurity I have sought validation to make myself “feel better” without even realizing it. . .
(8/10) . . .strongly believed that if the external looked good it would reflect the internal, but that is not the case and it never will be. It NEVER will be. My happiness comes from within and it does not matter how many men or how many shoes or how much money I have. I will. .
(7/10) . . .that I would never be good enough. "If only I looked this way", "If only I was this skinny", "If only I had those shoes", "If only that person would love me". All of the things I have told myself for so many years caused me to live in fear and hate myself. I. . .
(6/10) . . .either. The relationships with my parents have always been broken and I have been independent since I was 18 years old. I let my environment, life circumstances and family determine my self worth. From a very young age I have always felt like a piece of shit and. . .
(5/10) . . .and mentally abused for being "different" and for not being a "tough guy" and "real man" because I always showed emotion when I was "not supposed to". I have never been close with my father and haven't seen him in over two years. I am not very close with my mother. .
(4/10) . . .teenage boy when I was just 6 and 7 years old. I never once revealed those experiences until several months ago. I'm 25 years old. I watched my mother get physically, emotionally and mentally abused for 12 years by my father growing up as a child. I was emotionally. .
(3/10) I may have hung out with all the "cliques" in high school including the jocks and preps, but I was bullied emotionally and physically growing up for being feminine and a "pretty boy". I was sexually abused twice when I was a child by neighborhood kids and a random older. .
(2/10) My name is Cody Thompson and I identify as a white, cisgender, first generation, gay college student. I grew up in a small town where it was unacceptable for me to be myself so I remained in the closet until I was 19 years old.
(1/10) I appreciate reading posts and watching videos on Facebook that my friends have courageously created expressing the core being of who they are. Nothing is more attractive than vulnerability and authenticity. Thank you for giving me the courage to do the same. Here it goes!
Many police officers abuse people mentally, emotionally and physically without being able to justify their actions. Many should not be police officers and those who harm people need to be held accountable for their actions. Their behavior is unacceptable!! #PoliceBrutality

@Jerrycise @ICEgov When a U.S. citizen violates the law and policies in place, do you look at everyone in the same light based off one person’s actions?
@Jerrycise @ICEgov If a Somali or Muslim identified person just like a U.S. citizen were to violate the law and policies in place that is their own personal circumstances. One individual’s actions does not define an entire community.
@Jerrycise @ICEgov Deporting all immigrants will not solve the opioid crisis and drugs being trafficked into our country. How can you say Somalis and Muslims are destroying Minnesota? Can you expand on that and provide more information so I can better understand where you are coming from?
