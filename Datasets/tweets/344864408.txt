President Trump says Senate Majority Leader McConnell will bring his proposal to the floor for a vote this upcoming week. 		Will it have the votes?
President Trump plans to begin weekly bipartisan meetings at the White House once the government reopens to really work on comprehensive immigration reform.
"That is our plan: border security, DACA, TPS, and many other things...." -POTUS
The President proposes three years of "legislative relief" for DACA recipients and extended temporary protection status.
President Trump's proposal does not mean a wall from sea-to-sea, but steel barriers at select locations.
Under the President's proposal, Central American minors can apply for asylum in their home countries.
"Walls are not immoral." -POTUS
President says he received input on border agents and Homeland Security when compiling proposal to reopen the government and get border security.

"May God bless the State of Israel and may God bless the United States of America." #Netanyahu
"May we neither fear nor dread the challenges ahead." #Netanyahu
"But I know that Israel does not stand alone; I know that America stands with Israel, I know that you stand with Israel." #Netanyahu
"Even if Israel has to stand alone, Israel will stand." #Netanyahu
"We, the Jewish people, can defend ourselves." #Netanyahu
"The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the eyes of their Jewish enemies--those days are over." #Netanyahu
"Elie, your life and work inspires us to give meaning to the words 'never again.'" #Netanyahu to Elie Wiesel at speech
"My friends, standing up to Iran is not easy.  Standing up to dark, murderous regimes never is." #Netanyahu
The second deal would prevent the horrific consequences of arming Iran to all of humanity.  #Netanyahu
We must now choose between two paths.  One leads to bad deal and will inexorably lead to war. #Netanyahu
Only alternative to bad deal is not just war.  "The alternative to this deal is a much better deal." #Netanyahu
"For over a year, we've been told that no deal is better than a bad deal.  Well, this is a bad deal.  It's a very bad deal." #Netanyahu
"If Iran threatens to walk away from the table...call the bluff, because they need to do a lot more than you do." #Netanyahu
"If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it ACT like a normal country." #Netanyahu
Third: "stop threatening to annihilate my country, Jewish Israel, the one and only Jewish state." #Netanyahu
Second: stop supporting terrorism around the world.  #Netanyahu
World should demand three things from Iran: first, stop aggression against neighbors in Middle East. #Netanyahu
Don't lift restrictions on Iran for as long as they continue to be aggressors in this world. #Netanyahu
"We don't have to gamble with our future or with our children's future." #Netanyahu
"A region where small skirmishes contribute big wars would be a nuclear tinderbox." #Netanyahu
Many of Israel's and Iran's neighbors will respond to these negotiations by getting nuclear weapons of their own. #Netanyahu
"This deal...doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb--it paves Iran's path to the bomb." #Netanyahu
"All of the restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will expire in about a decade." #Netanyahu
"Iran has proven time and again that it cannot be trusted." #Netanyahu
"Iran was caught twice...operating secret nuclear facilities that inspectors didn't even know existed." #Netanyahu
"Iran not only defies inspectors, it also plays a pretty good game of 'hide and cheat' with them." #Netanyahu
"Inspectors document violations, they don't stop them." #Netanyahu
"We must always remember...the greatest danger facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons." #Netanyahu
"When it comes to Iran and ISIS, the enemy of your enemy is your enemy." #Netanyahu
"This regime will always be an enemy of America..." #Netanyahu
"Iran's regime is as radical as ever..." #Netanyahu
#Netanyahu says we must all stand against Iran's regime of conquest and terror.
"Iran is busy gobbling up the nations." #Netanyahu
"Iran's regime poses a great threat, not only to Israel, but to the peace of the entire world." #Netanyahu
"This Capitol Dome helped build our Iron Dome." #Netanyahu
"Thank you, America; thank you for everything you have done for Israel." #Netanyahu
"Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support...especially in generous military assistance..." #Netanyahu
The bond between the U.S. and Israel has been, and should always be, above politics. #Netanyahu
"I know that no matter which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel." #Netanyahu
"I deeply regret that some might perceive my being here as political--that was never my intention." #Netanyahu
"I am deeply humbled by the opportunity speak...before the most important legislative body in the world--the U.S. Congress." #Netanyahu
