#SCOTUS: "Background of Justices," Supreme Court A to Z (CQ Press, 5th ed., Kenneth Jost, ed.): 70 justices had previous judicial experience (now 71 w/Gorsuch); more on state court (e.g, Brennan, O'Connor) than federal. Thus, 42 had none (e.g., Kagan, Rehnquist, Powell, Goldberg)
@jadler1969 Barrett's relevant experience pales in comparison to all of those listed by my friend @jadler1969 .. Byron White's relevant experience was thin: less than 2 yrs at DOJ; ditto, Rehnquist (also &lt;2 yrs)
@ChanceBGardener "Shanghaied" in Alito's written opinion: quite correct, not really an ethnic term; so why did he change the phrasing in his hand-down? Because he thought it is?
#SCOTUS vacancy, qualifications for: Many SCOTUS nominees chosen from outside judicial monastery have been chosen based on other experience: e.g., Kagan as SG + law school dean; Warren as gov of Calif; etc. cf. Byron White: very limited experience (&lt;2 yrs at DOJ); Barrett, 8 mos.
#SCOTUS vacancy watch: List narrowed to three, per NBC News: veterans Kavanaugh (CA-DC), Kethledge (CA6), newbie Barrett (CA7). Barrett, 46, wld be youngest nominee since Thomas (43); least experienced since ever (8 mos on CA7; cf. Thomas, 19 mos on CA-DC before SCOTUS).
