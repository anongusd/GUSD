Alright GOP, now you're the dog that caught the car. Trump has raised hope very high among his supporters. Can u deliver?
Has it occurred to anyone that we know next to nothing about this man? Taxes, business dealings, more sexual assault charges?
I can't believe it. I just can't believe it
We are about to elect a man with contempt for our democratic institutions.
We are about to elect a man who mocks the disabled.
We are about to elect a man who lies every 3 minutes.
We are about to elect a man who views women including his own daughter as merely sexual objects
We are about to elect a man who views immigrants as rapists
We are about to elect the man endorsed by the kkk.
Our system is not set up to deal w someone like Trump who respects no norms. This is a disaster for the nation.
Is a two state solution a possibility? KIDDING!!!!
Our nation is on the verge of electing a man who brags about sexual assault. I can't even imagine what I will tell my daughter tomorrow.
