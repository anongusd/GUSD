10- In 2019, the Russian state-owned company Rostec was forced to postpone the serial production of the Irkut MS-21 passenger aircraft because of the sanctions that the White House imposed on the Rostec aircraft building corporation. https://t.co/WYt20pR0j4
9- 🇺🇸 ranks sixth in the number of sanctions (nine), but in terms of the amount of damage, second (almost $ 1.17 billion).	The TOP 10 countries that have imposed restrictive measures against 🇷🇺 also include India, Belarus, Turkey, Australia, Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil.
8- The EU has become the leader in the № of restrictive measures imposed against 🇷🇺 - the № of sanctions has reached 25. The estimated damage amounted to 2.42 billion dollars.	This is followed by 🇺🇦 with 22 restrictive measures, the damage from which reached 775 million dollars
7- As of the end of 2018, 159 restrictive measures were in force against Russia, which were introduced by 62 countries. 	According to expert estimates, the amount of the estimated damage from the measures imposed was $ 6.3 billion. https://t.co/8k7RwwvIbV
6- It is possible that the calculation of the Kremlin leader will be wrong. And if so, then this may prove to be a very serious blow to Russia's passive-aggressive foreign policy.
5- Putin also believes that he understands the motives and real wishes of US President Donald Trump better than most "experts", and therefore he excludes any military intervention by the United States.
4- Putin's stubborn position may seem wrong, but it follows from the conviction that the crisis will inevitably lead to serious reprisals against protesters, thus forcing all external mediators to step aside from initiating empty protests.
3- Unlike in the case of Syria, Russia has no capacity for military intervention through the Atlantic. And her attempts to sabotage the American sanctions against the Maduro regime are far from effective.
2- Moscow is preparing its own draft resolution on Venezuela for a meeting of the UN Security Council, but their intention is obviously simply blocking any recognition of the legitimacy of the opposition to Maduro's rule.
1- Russian foreign policy, in its ideology, opposes revolutions. Most likely, for Putin, &amp; is fundamentally useful to him that the authoritarian rulers, whether in Syria or Venezuela, can not get rid of power through street protests.

7- Russia is there in a foreign field. Now the situation is different. Russia has phantom ideas that it can interfere and oppose the United States there. It's not like that at all. This territory is far from Russia. This is a zone of US influence. https://t.co/rJ4q8a9Cje
6- It is unlikely that some kind of interference from outside. Those who support Maduro, will give only moral support. Perhaps, Russia will send some warships to come with a "visit". But military intervention will not B. Russia has no resources for this, Venezuela is very far. https://t.co/qbucPlGmi2
5- If there is no bloodshed, there will be no direct intervention by the United States.	There are still oil issues. Anyway, oil is very interesting for the USA https://t.co/FZhfsgfxs4
4-From the 🇺🇸, if there is no escalation, which will lead 2 the death of 🇺🇸 citizens, or 2 mass executions, the intervention will not occur. External pressure will continue 2 ensure the army neutrality or 2 ensure the transfer of security forces 2 the side of the opposition. https://t.co/6SbgwGS9Xe
3- And how it will develop, will depend on what actions will be taken by the same European countries, the United States, and whether Russia wants to intervene there openly. And then we will understand how the situation will develop. By and large, this can lead to civil war. https://t.co/ALan3EhUrj
2- Everything will depend on the Venezuelan army, which plays an important role. If the army takes the side of Guaydo, the situation can be quickly resolved through elections. If not, the situation may not develop according to plan. https://t.co/c3tUIjHck4
1- We see mass demonstrations now, people took to the streets. In these conditions it is important what role the army will take. If the army takes a neutral position or at least part of it goes to the opposition, then Maduro’s fate will be resolved." https://t.co/gdST8UWlab

5- it is known that the authorities of the Russian Federation additionally allocated $ 350 million to their special services for the implementation of subversive activities in the elections in Ukraine in 2019.
4- After the annexation of the Crimea sobering comes to the Russian public. Ordinary citizens understand that Crimea is an expensive pleasure that Ukrainian taxpayers previously held. Crimea is not profitable
3- Today, only military operations abroad are the only way for the Russian authorities to maintain prestige within the country.
2- International sanctions, which Putin calls "ridiculous," have deprived the Russian budget of 173 billion dollars. Of course, for an ordinary Russian, this is big money. These are internal calculations of the Russian government at the end of 2018, which they do not advertise.

6- In addition, the port of Novorossiysk is behind the schedule of oil shipment. Through the Black Sea, Russians sell about 14% of all fuel.
5- At the moment (being in a watercourse), 39 million barrels of oil are stuck on the passage through the Bosphorus. This situation may affect the operation of the Mediterranean refineries, since the delays will definitely continue and intensify.
4- Russians suffer billions in losses due to overdue contracts and a several-fold increase in the time spent on fuel delivery. In fact, the entire oil trading business, which was based on deliveries through the Black Sea, was under threat.
3- Whether this is due to a kind of revenge for the seizure of the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov is not clear. Nevertheless, Putin, it seems, has learned that he can get an adequate response for his crimes at any time and from any side.
2- And all because of the hybrid actions of Turkey, which simply introduced new rules for navigation through the straits (hmmm 🤔), which created unbearable conditions for the Russian Federation.
1- 39 million barrels of bloody Russian oil were practically blocked in the Black Sea. To get through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Europe, each tanker needs to wait about 13 days. Waiting to the side takes another 13.	Thus, the profit fell tenfold. https://t.co/ndKDiD0Tgi
