@TaskForceNB keep up the good work!
Excited to see my gf on tv tonight. Obviously, I'm talking about Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
I'm predicting a low tide in Miami tonight. Go Irish!
The energy on Fox is so weird and intense, and features so many close-ups of sad white people, that I feel like I'm watching a Bergman film.
It's good to be Irish! #uNDefeated #BCS
On balance, I would say "fly up" is the best way to address a jury.
