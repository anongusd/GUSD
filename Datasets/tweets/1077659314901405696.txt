@Cofadad @Mikeggibbs Who says there's no line?		Oh, right - your strawman argument is now also a slippery slope.		If government were to pass legislation to make vaccinations mandatory, it could clearly specify which. We already have a recommended vaccine schedule. You're peddling nonsense.
@Cofadad @Mikeggibbs The rights of the children, who cannot understand the risks of their parents' decisions, and the rights of those who cannot be vaccinated to benefit from herd immunity, are more important than the rights of parents to endanger the public by believing in conspiracy theories.
@Cofadad @Mikeggibbs Yes, which is why I used the word mandatory, which you are trying to twist into assaulting children.		I'm not sure why it's so controversial to put public health above the uninformed opinions of parents, but here we are.
@Cofadad @Mikeggibbs The question is how to mandate it, which you would realize if you weren't making a bad faith argument.		Other comments have discussed withholding government payments for parents of unvaccinated children.		I was not endorsing forcibly injecting children, you are using a strawman.
@Cofadad @Mikeggibbs Claiming I endorse physical assault or unproven vaccines is the strawman, obviously.		It's hard to have substantive debate in 280 characters, but you're not even trying.

@farnorthsider @Mikeggibbs That's a fair criticism, and I'm not sure how best to solve it. Perhaps income tax returns? Place all return funds in a government fund to pay for healthcare, and release the money when kids get shots.		I appreciate you bringing a rational counterpoint to the debate, by the way.
@ProtectingM @Mikeggibbs We could call them "incubators." Or "leper colonies." And they'd have to be boarding schools, of course, completely cut off from access to the outside world.		The horrifying alternative is parents trusting doctors over Jenny McCarthy and kids getting their shots.

News orgs are made of individuals. I don't care what their political beliefs are as long as they report truth.
@CiscoL4 @raybee98 @brianstelter @mschlapp @AOC It's almost like two different situations warrant two different responses, go figure.		Yes, absolutely, Mueller is looking into obstruction.		You defending Trump like this proves nothing except that you're intellectually dishonest.
@CiscoL4 @raybee98 @brianstelter @mschlapp @AOC It's old and also invalid.		You're making a false comparison, and you have to realize that. The scope and volume of Trump's lies is out there for the world to see.		The WaPo fact checkers have taken issue with some of AOC's statements. She hasn't demonstrably lied 8000+ times.
@Shadoself @Mikeggibbs Yes, we should compromise public health by allowing the uninformed not to use safe, proven medicine, leading to a resurgence in preventable disease. That's extremely sane.		Would it help if they allow wearing a tinfoil hat while receiving immunizations?
@CiscoL4 @raybee98 @brianstelter @mschlapp @AOC She uses hyperbole and has misstated facts. That's a significant difference when compared to Trump lying to obstruct justice, or making up facts to justify his agenda.

His daily whining about a carbon tax costing Canadians without suggesting any alternatives is all I need to know about his "policy."
@SuzieWo74493002 @AndrewScheer Is 2% of Quebec's greenhouse gas emissions worth the jobs and revenue it will bring to the province?		This is much less of a legitimate criticism than it is pointing at a bogeyman. Right wingers would have attacked Couillard no matter what action he took on this issue.
@SuzieWo74493002 @AndrewScheer Also, this is a vast oversimplification of a complex issue, which I'm sure was not your intention.		There are many questions to ask. Will it have lower emissions than other methods of producing cement? Since Quebec is part of cap and trade, will it fund green innovation?
@SuzieWo74493002 @AndrewScheer This project was already underway when the Quebec (yes, provincial, not Trudeau) Liberals got into power. Conservatives would've been howling about wasting money and losing jobs if they canceled it, don't pretend they would oppose this if it was a Conservative idea.
@brinxee @AndrewScheer That's an interesting accusation, since I'm not a Trudeau fan.		Can you point to any substance? It's just constant retreads of the same tired attacks with no evidence.		Trudeau calling the CPC and PPC out for fear mongering over immigration is not hypocrisy. It's common sense.
@AndrewScheer Your Twitter feed is a non-stop stream of attacks on Trudeau, whining about Trudeau, and is utterly devoid of substance.		This is one of the most hypocritical things I've ever seen someone say. Why would Canadians want idea free Scheer as PM?

That's an absurd statement. Politics is about debate and compromise. If one party has a good idea and others adopt it, that's a good thing.
@Ken37584707 @Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ That's a sad, zero sum view of governing. I would like to see all parties try to help Canadians, not just offer criticism without alternatives.

@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Ah, a classic right wing tactic: pretend to have won an argument without providing anything of value.		Have a nice day.

@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Your lack of a coherent argument is showing, if that's all you have as an attack.
@captwaveydavey @AndrewScheer You should expect to be called an idiot when all you contribute is idiocy. I am not and have never been a Liberal supporter, nor do I approve of Trudeau. You're just making assumptions because everything is about which "team" people belong to, right?
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Well, for one, it was raising money for the government that was used to fund smart green policies, such as grants for home renovations to remove heat loss, saving money for households and cutting down on fossil fuel consumption.		https://t.co/SIJAPY5gH2		Scrapping it has costed.

@lynnemorvirat @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Go ahead and block me or report, have fun. I've violated no rules.		You presented a non sequitur and called me closed minded for... believing science? Shame on me.		Enjoy your echo chamber.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ I don't support the exemptions.		If you don't understand how a carbon tax will reduce emissions, you don't understand basic economics. The answer is VERY OBVIOUS. Here is Wikipedia, which most people can look up on their own.		https://t.co/13FW9AnuSK
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ In California, yes, through a cap and trade carbon dividend system.		What exactly are you trying to argue? If there's a logical point, it's well hidden.
@lynnemorvirat @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Name the "credible scientists."		https://t.co/f6q2I0gDkB		There is an overwhelming consensus, and ignoring the evidence is plain stupidity. Being on the fence is being anti-science.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Just because one country doesn't have a national carbon tax doesn't mean a carbon tax won't work anywhere. That's illogical. Meanwhile, California DOES have a cap and trade system which has been working great.		Ontario was a part of that until Doug Ford threw a tantrum.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ So, why do you think their emissions went down? According to the EIA, decreases were mainly due to a decrease in demand, followed by reducing dependence on coal and fossil fuels.		https://t.co/MCx5auE6sT		You know a good way to drive down reliance on coal? Hmm...
@lynnemorvirat @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ I understood it, it doesn't discredit the science of climate change in any way, shape, or form. It is reductive thinking and serves only to deflect from the real issues. Care to try a real argument?
@Biggy12Rbign1 @AndrewScheer Where do you think he will be "out on day parole?" He is being deported from the country after his sentence. Not a Canadian national.		Was it uncalled for when you still clearly don't comprehend the situation?
@lynnemorvirat @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Great job discrediting scientific consensus, you've sure proven... oh, wait, absolutely nothing.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ How, exactly, do you think those emissions were reduced? Go ahead, I'm sure you will at some point contribute something intelligent to this conversation.		As you can see, Canada is among the countries with the largest increases. What point are you trying to prove?
@CapersQ @Torguy68 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Hyperbole much? The impacts of inaction will be much larger, but feel free to continue living with your head firmly rooted up your ass.
@4CanadianAction @AndrewScheer @DefinitionHolly Oh, I bow to your clearly superior knowledge of the justice system, I was unaware that deportation was a choice. And since our borders have no customs checks, this will be a huge problem.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Oh, yeah, TOTAL failure.		https://t.co/AKvZYHSuG5		Compare to peak in 2017. Nobody is claiming change would be overnight. Increase has slowed dramatically, and as carbon prices go up, will decrease further.		But you're right, it's starting to work, let's give up like Australia.
@AndrewScheer So, an American who smuggled guns gets 8 years and then deported.		What would you do differently? Typical no ideas Scheer.

@CapersQ @AndersonBooz @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Standard talking point devoid of fact. Rates of increase have been going down.
@Torguy68 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ The curve is bending. Increases are slowing. As pricing slowly increases, it will decrease further.		Nobody claimed emissions would decrease overnight.

@CapersQ @delta_su @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ It's an easily verifiable list.		I thought you supported people doing their own searching?
@CapersQ @Rbjames09 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ So, in other words, "I refuse to provide sources because my opinion is more important."		If you had reputable sources, you would share them. All you have is bullshit.
@CapersQ @cp9082 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ You're either intentionally lying or an idiot. Either way, talking to you is a waste of time.
@captwaveydavey @AndrewScheer You're an idiot.		Politicians should have a platform. Full stop. Quit making excuses for a "leader" with zero substance.
@cp9082 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ I am not a Trudeau fan and don't like his platform. Not sure where you got that idea. His reckless spending is a disaster.		That said, a carbon tax is a smart proposal and only idiots and illiterates can ignore the evidence.
@CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Burden of proof is on the person making the claim. Back your bullshit up or stop spewing it.
@AndrewScheer Do you have any original thoughts in your head? Criticism of Trudeau alone isn't a platform. You have no ideas and are unsuitable to be PM.		It's easy to avoid bad optics when you only allow pre-screened softball questions from supporters, isn't it?
@cp9082 @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ I'm sure your opinion matters more than all of the prominent economists, including several Nobel Laureates, who say a carbon tax is the most efficient way to reduce emissions.
@CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Making up statistics and not providing sources isn't what I'd call "thinking for yourself," but continue with the masturbatory self praise all you'd like.
@delta_su @CapersQ @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ Cherry pick all you want. The Australian tax was reversed because backwards politicians made false promises.		Here's a list of places with carbon taxes.		https://t.co/mSy6zBgfxC		More evidence you'll ignore, have fun not reading it.
@CapersQ @Rbjames09 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ So, again, you're throwing out numbers with no sources. Classic.		Meanwhile, actual professionals whose opinions I do care about have done study and have actual evidence backing their claims.

@jfinn1971 @Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer @CPC_HQ I don't like any of the major party federal leaders, actually.		Just because I dislike Trudeau doesn't mean Scheer gets a pass on having no ideas, no charisma, and doing nothing but pandering on Twitter.

@awri125 @annetteymacdona @AndrewScheer I don't agree with the exemption, but if they were doing this just for votes, there wouldn't be a carbon tax. I'm quite awake, thank you for your concern.
@awri125 @annetteymacdona @AndrewScheer You implied the carbon tax is "just a tax grab." If that's not dumb politics, I don't know what is.
@realDonaldTrump What happened to Forrest?
@AndrewScheer Fight how? Have you come up with a climate platform yet?
@awri125 @annetteymacdona @AndrewScheer It's idiotic to say they're implementing a carbon tax for votes. Look how the reaction has been. Blatantly false talking point.
@awri125 @annetteymacdona @AndrewScheer You apparently think your opinion matters more than climate scientists and Nobel laureate economists, so, that says quite a bit.		And I don't "unfailingly support" the Liberals. I criticize them frequently, but a carbon tax is good policy.
@awri125 @annetteymacdona @AndrewScheer I don't agree with the exemptions, but look how much pushback there is on "increased costs" even with them. Cons would criticize the plan either way.

@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier No, I don't know that, because it's not bullshit.		Yes, I'm looking at current trends. That's better than an argument based purely on how you feel, and constantly yelling about anti-Semitism.		I'm not trying to "pin" anything on one group. I'm looking at statistics.
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier The same Israel that now has much friendlier relations with Saudi Arabia and Egypt?		Invading and illegally occupying territory is not self defense.
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier Oh, look, more insults... Shocking.
@__alex_h_ @SalHas81 @cwgraham1 @MaximeBernier So, you ignore evidence, argue based on unprovable hypotheticals, and try to shut down debate with cries of "ANTI-SEMITE!"		How is anyone but you the troll here?
@__alex_h_ @SalHas81 @cwgraham1 @MaximeBernier That's not putting words in your mouth. You called me an anti-Semite for... claiming Israel can do wrong?
@thormountain @benshapiro You are just blatantly lying now. I suppose all the bankruptcies and deaths because people can't afford medical care are something I imagined?
@Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer I won't hold my breath on that.
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier No, it's that I base my judgments on the facts. I don't know why you're ignoring evidence that right wing extremists were responsible for 59% of fatalities.		Oh wait, I do - you ignore it because it goes against your preconceived notions.
@jake330614 @joeypotato1 @benshapiro It's a *net* cost of $160. Not gross. What is hard to comprehend?
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier Really? It's anti-Semitism to claim Israel is anything but a victim? Absurdity.		https://t.co/zQDPQDDaAJ
@Francin_P @Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer Okay, if you say so.		I'm no Trudeau fan, I would vote for any party that offers to balance the budget and has a workable climate plan. That does not include Scheer.
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier That was an intentionally sarcastic comment. I wasn't saying Jews are brown people, I was saying here is more evidence of domestic threats from white, right-wing extremists, while you ignore that and say Islamic terror is the major threat.		Dang Muslims causing this!
This is too hilarious to be true! https://t.co/B4EyeKBW80
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier If someone criticized Japan during WW2, is that because they are anti-Shinto?		The Jewish people and the Israeli government are not one and the same. Netanyahu and his government deserve criticism for their violations of international law.
@jake330614 @joeypotato1 @benshapiro If spending $3000 on bloodwork (which is not reflective of the actual cost) saves a $2840 ER visit down the road, it has a cost of $160.		The point is not that there is only $160 to spend on each person. It is that an additional $160 per person can provide better care than ER.
@Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer Shouldn't his job be to provide a coherent policy alternative to Trudeau? Show ideas on how to move forward, instead of just criticize with empty statements? I expect more from the head of a major national party.
@thormountain @benshapiro You have a healthcare system that does great research, but doesn't work for the average person. Life expectancy will show you that.		Canadians traveling to the USA for medical care is not the huge phenomenon it is made out to be. Stats inflated by snowbirds.
@p_himmel @benshapiro Sorry, I thought it was sarcastic but can never be sure.
@Evelynne24 @AndrewScheer Scheer criticizes everything Trudeau does without offering alternatives.		Why? Because he has no ideas. Only cheap shots.		Do you want him as PM when he has no idea how to solve any of the issues he points out?
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier Tree of Life shooter was a right wing extremist. What far-left anti-Semite has a body count recently? I legitimately can't think of one.		Not even addressing the ridiculous UN point. Israel ≠ Judaism.
@p_himmel @benshapiro The ER is extremely inefficient and expensive, and having people unable to pay for primary care costs the healthcare system more when their condition inevitably worsens and they show up at the ER.		No other developed country has healthcare as dysfunctional.
@jake330614 @joeypotato1 @benshapiro Is it math or logic you don't understand?
@thormountain @benshapiro USA spends more of its GDP on healthcare than any other OECD nation and has more people uninsured and worse healthcare outcomes. The costs you pay do not reflect the actual costs of providing healthcare. Most countries pay less and provide more.
@joeypotato1 @benshapiro You're missing the point.		It's not spending on preventative care on top of ER costs.		It's investing in preventative care which is cheaper and better for public health to reduce ER visits, which will likely save money long run.
@benshapiro You conveniently ignore that they currently have access to care through emergency rooms.		Preventative care is a sensible investment that saves money in the long run. You're distorting the issue.
@cwgraham1 @__alex_h_ @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier Oh, look what popped into my feed today.		https://t.co/qaIOzvEqO9		Dang brown people!

@realDonaldTrump You could have bankrupted even more casinos?
@AndrewScheer What would you be doing?
@cwgraham1 @__alex_h_ @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier That was the stats for total "incidents," which is not what I was quoting. Stop lying.		The 59% statistic comes from the Anti-Defamation League, which you'd know if you bothered reading anything more than the bare minimum to find something to cherry pick.

@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier Fair point, I agree with that. Glad that our intelligence services and law enforcement are monitoring all terrorism.		Personally, the open expressions of xenophobia and bigotry by far right figures frightens me far more than lone wolf Islamist attacks. To each their own.

@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier I've seen more statistics for the USA than Canada, and haven't been able to quickly find more for Canada.		Could have, sure. Didn't. You and I both know we don't have access to or knowledge of all thwarted attacks. We can only guess at most of them. Without stats, that is useless
@swarren_ca @AndrewScheer And I see you live in an alternate reality.		Must be nice not having to worry about climate change!
@tennisblake @jaketapper Do you... watch the news? Nobody is calling for a boycott of Saudi Arabia? Give me a break.		China is much harder to boycott, from a practical standpoint. I'm sure there are still people who do.		This is all beside the point - 1A infringement.
@__alex_h_ @cwgraham1 @SalHas81 @MaximeBernier The truth is that white nationalists and right wing extremists are responsible for over half of domestic terrorism related deaths. It's right there, whether you accept it or not. Show me statistics that other groups attempted more killings but failed and I'll consider your point.
@tennisblake @jaketapper That's an absurd argument.		One can stand for Israel's right to exist without supporting its many contraventions of international law.		I also heavily criticize China and Saudi Arabia, among others - not sure where you get the "silent" idea. Strawman attempt?
@tennisblake @jaketapper And by "teacher" you mean speech pathologist. At least get the basic facts right.
@tennisblake @jaketapper There's a difference between Judaism and Israel, which you're obviously ignoring.		You can support the Jewish people but disapprove of Israel's actions. Many people feel that way, myself included.		There is a significant difference between being racist and opposing Israel.
@sharoot66 @ggreenwald @RashidaTlaib @marcorubio He was a pretty major 2016 presidential candidate, and has a fairly high media presence.

@GeorgeH19534572 @Johnny_G_Money @AndrewScheer Actually, that's exactly what science does. Look at evidence, determine a hypothesis, carry out experiments to see if it is supported or refuted.		That is the basic scientific method. Your ignorance is appalling.

@PreetBharara Careful, that's how you get Brexit.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer Classic conservative - fail to back up your arguments, throw out fake figures, and walk away as if the argument is won.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer 40%? Laughable.		According to NASA (which, last I checked, was pretty reputable) 97% of climate scientists "agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities."		You can read that yourself: https://t.co/f6q2I0yec9
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer You're right about me not wanting to hear nonsense. You've said very little that would qualify as true.		Your opinion doesn't qualify for a participation trophy. Forget a Nobel - those are reserved for people with intelligent thoughts in their heads.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer How would you force China to reduce emissions, ask politely?		"Many scientists and economists" my ass. The vast majority have realized climate change is real, it's an urgent issue, and it demands action. The rest, like yourself, have their heads firmly up their asses.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer That is quite literally the stupidest thing I've read all day, and trust me, there's been some competition.
@TheDemCoalition Klobuchar, Warren, or Sanders, ideally.		There are definitely some other great candidates out there, too, though. I quite like Sherrod Brown and Swalwell, as well.		I would hope Biden or (god forbid) Hillary does not become the nominee.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer Yes, you're right, I should listen to your opinion rather than the Nobel Laureates.		Your ideas of abandoning cities and... what, militarily taking over China? Is that the plan? They're brilliant, and practical. You should feel SO proud.

@deprisenw @AndrewScheer Source on $1.4 billion?		Exactly what "damage control" is needed, our relationship with India is fine... There are legitimate criticisms of Trudeau's foreign policy, the India trip is a tired, worn-out non-issue.		I invite Canadians who don't want a climate plan to fuck off.
@deprisenw @AndrewScheer Removing a carbon tax that doesn't exist yet isn't a "pillar," and Scheer has no climate plan of his own.		His ideas re: justice are nothing new, just same old Conservative talking points.		He has no authority to negotiate with India.		Fix third country how, exactly?

@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash I didn't think a cultist would see reason, but wasted my time trying. Still don't know why I bothered.		You are comically missing the point if you could read all that and still come up with that conclusion. Enjoy your land of make believe and alternative facts while it lasts.
@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash The second you look at an economic model where there is more than one player, you can see the drawbacks to tariffs. Country A can impose tariffs on Country B; Country B may then retaliate by buying, say, soybeans and seafood from Country C and D instead of A.
@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash So, if cost of producing a product increases for a company in Country A due to tariffs, a company in Company C may be able to undercut them and capture the global market.		So even if tariffs mean companies in Country A are "buying domestic" it can hurt these companies globally.
@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash You really don't have much of a grasp of economics for someone accusing others of lacking knowledge.		There are also companies operating in Countries B, C, D... Like it or not, the economy is global. Companies based in Country A typically also sell goods to these other countries.

@NookAppolloni @HillReporter This is also the most diverse House of Representatives in the history of Congress.		Take a guess which party that's due to. You can try to make a "both sides are the same" fallacious argument based on POTUS nominee alone. The only thing that proves is your cognitive dissonance.
@NookAppolloni @HillReporter You should try learning English before carrying on a conversation, it's a useful skill.		Whoever the POTUS nominee winds up being (I am a fan of Klobuchar, personally) Democrats are the party that stand up for women's and minorities' rights, time after time.
@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash This, in turn, raises prices to manufacturing in Country A, and can make Country A's companies less competitive.		That's a nice little grade school summary even a Trump cultist should be able to understand. Note that at no point does Country B pay Country A. Period.
@realAJ_Macaroni @justinamash No, it proves that you're either a moron or intentionally distorting the facts.		If Country A places a tariff on goods from Country B, companies in Country A pay Country A to import goods from Country B. This is with the intention that companies buy goods from Country A.
@NookAppolloni @HillReporter Did you just tweet MAGA and Facts Matter at the same time? That's a laugh.		You Trumplings really can't make a point without deflecting to Democrats, can you? Sorry if I don't hear your complaints over the sound of women and minorities abandoning your party in droves.

@MaximeBernier Why don't you address real issues rather than some minor party, one of dozens, which will have no impact?		This hardly demonstrates a problem with multiculturalism, and I'm sure you don't have a similar problem with the Christian Heritage Party or their ilk.
@realDonaldTrump You've really completely given up on the truth, haven't you?
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer Well, I can actually agree with that, but I think we both know how unrealistic it is to expect Canadians to support a carbon tax if they aren't getting something back to make up for higher costs.		For environmental policies, Greens &gt; NDP &gt; Libs &gt; Cons. I'll take what I can get.
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer I agree that the exemption should be dropped.		Again, though, I need to ask - what is your solution? A small step in the right direction is better than the nothing Scheer has to offer.
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer Again, you're either intentionally misrepresenting the purpose of a carbon tax, or misunderstanding it.		The main intention is to change the behaviour of businesses, not just people. The profit motive will change corporate behaviour, and that's the primary goal.
@thehill https://t.co/sMg2BYTKTK
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer There is zero reason to assume that businesses will not change their behaviour when the costs of using fossil fuels outweigh the savings of doing so.		A carbon tax of this type is the bare minimum needed going forward.
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer You should realize, being a part of the problem, that people will fight against a carbon tax tooth and nail.		A rebate to make it revenue neutral is a move to make this more politically palatable. It is absurd to call this "vote buying," considering carbon tax's unpopularity.
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer So, unless they've redefined the word "universally" since I last looked, you're either illiterate or ignoring what's right in front of you.		What, exactly, are you arguing in favour of? What is your climate change policy?
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer “There is basically no alternative to the market solution,” Professor Nordhaus said Monday.		...		The Nobel committee cited Professor Nordhaus for showing “the most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes.”
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer “One problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn’t exist,” Professor Romer said at a news conference after the announcement.		I wonder who that quote applies to...
@SteveJBerman @MickVillene @AndrewScheer You are either intentionally misrepresenting this or laughably wrong. In case you're too lazy to Google it, here's some background reading.		https://t.co/5n9r0wirDl
@Othmar53 @AndrewScheer So, you would prefer to wallow in comfortable ignorance than listen to science.		Thanks for letting me know, I won't waste any more time on you.
@AllThySons01 @DaveHawthorne7 @AndrewScheer If the price of gas goes up (note that it is lower in Alberta, which has a carbon tax, than Ontario) perhaps more people will take public transit. That would be a positive change.		If your heating bills are high, perhaps you should look at reducing heat loss.
@AllThySons01 @DaveHawthorne7 @AndrewScheer Yes, you're right, I'm the gullible one here for supporting a carbon tax. Do yourself a quick favour and google the 2018 Nobel Prize in economics.		Shame on you for believing blatant lies from the Conservatives and Scheer.
@MickVillene @AndrewScheer Oh, right - a carbon tax, as proposed by Nobel Laureate economists, has been disproved because some random guy claims it's not a viable plan. You sure showed me!
@AllanAdrian5 @AndrewScheer I never said we should stop using oil or natural gas immediately and completely. What we should be doing is investing in green energy and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, even if we can't currently completely eliminate it.		Sticking our heads in the sand is no solution.
@DaveHawthorne7 @AndrewScheer Ah, yes, I suppose you know more than the economists who won a Nobel Prize for their work regarding a carbon tax. It acts as a disincentive, meaning using fossil fuels is no longer the cheapest option, and naturally encouraging less damaging options.		How would you "limit" it?
@AllanAdrian5 @AndrewScheer Bullshit. If you want to increase jobs and investment, green energy is the future.		What is his CLIMATE plan? Canceling the carbon tax in and of itself is not a solution.
@DaveHawthorne7 @AndrewScheer Of course, Venezuela is the go to for right wingers who can't conjure up an original thought.		So, kill the carbon tax - what then? Do you not believe in global warming? How would you want it dealt with?		And I'm no Trudeau fan, but a carbon tax is just sensible.
@Othmar53 @AndrewScheer Either that or a person who actually listens to scientific consensus.		Are you denying that global warming is influenced by human behaviour?
@AllanAdrian5 @AndrewScheer He "will" have a plan? Don't make me laugh. If he had one, he'd be talking about it.
@AndrewScheer And what's your climate plan?		Oh, that's right - you don't even have a platform. You just rip on Trudeau without offering any alternatives.
This is a great positive change - shame the Liberals only roll those out during election years. https://t.co/fDg3QLhX5t
RT @EmmanuelMacron: Les luttes contre le réchauffement climatique et pour la biodiversité sont plus nécessaires que jamais.
@realDonaldTrump Criticism of the military from draft dodgers is invalid. You are a petty manchild and your insults are pathetic.
@WarnarSteve @4ForHappy @AndrewScheer At which point have you ever made a reasonable, articulate argument?		Your entire point was based on a complete fallacy, which is why I've treated your argument with all the respect it deserves - absolutely none.		When you have a legitimate point to make, do it.
@amconmag Exiting Syria and reducing troops in Afghanistan at this point will prove to the world several things: that America is essentially hostage to the capricious whims of Trump, and that it will abandon its allies when that becomes politically expedient.
@amconmag I would agree that Congress should be the only body to authorize a war, and that allowing a President to either declare a war or to falsely declare victory in one is antidemocratic and moronic.		However, the war started - it's not practical to just pack one's bags and forget it.
@amconmag Leaving aside the point of whether these wars should have started in the first place, which is a much more complex question, the main criticism I have seen is that a country's policy should not be decided by the president's whims, against the advice of his advisors.
@amconmag This article raises a valid point, but ignores the true nature of the criticisms against Trump.		Most of those arguing against his hasty decision are not doing so because they are war hawks, they are doing so because they think withdrawal should be orderly.
@JenniferJokes This tweet lead me to two realizations: that I could absolutely picture that being a Scheer scandal, and that I'll never forgive you for putting that image in my head.

@realDonaldTrump I'm not sure if I'm more alarmed that the POTUS is openly endorsing (and previously hired) a neo-Nazi, or that this is the height of vocabulary he's capable of.		"Very good and talented" sounds like an endorsement from a Russian bot.
@WarnarSteve @4ForHappy @AndrewScheer Congratulations, by waiting until today to post this, you avoid consideration for dumbest tweets of 2018.
@realDonaldTrump Translation for sane people: Democrats try to keep country running while narcissistic manchild throws own feces because neither party is interested in funding his vanity project.
@WarnarSteve @4ForHappy @AndrewScheer You have the law of supply and demand completely backwards. This entire premise, like the rest of your argument, is fatally flawed.
@MaryClementz @Open_Minded16 @realDonaldTrump Yes, she's discussing the incompetence of @POTUS. Dialogue is great!
@WarnarSteve @4ForHappy @AndrewScheer I'll bring that up next time I meet with him for coffee, thanks tips.
@4ForHappy @WarnarSteve @AndrewScheer Fun strawman argument you have there.
For the life of me, I don't understand how @vincecable isn't further up the polls. On Brexit and other issues, he's sensible, intelligent, and consistent. https://t.co/7bUXHpByKe
@fordnation You are a pathetic excuse for a premier, and it's laughable that you still claim to be for the people.		When you have a real climate change plan, I'd be interested in seeing it. Until then, have fun incompetently bumbling your way through corruption. You can't even do graft well.
@realDonaldTrump Bullshit.
@WarnarSteve @AndrewScheer Oh, you're right, let's give up completely!		I'm not sure if you somehow feel you were making a legitimate point, but we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. That doesn't mean stop using them immediately.

@jjl1979 @MgS_2011 @YukonGale @AndrewScheer I didn't say I'd vote for him or want him as Premier. I said as far as Conservatives go, he's the best I've seen in a while.		What I meant by that was if he won, I think opposition parties could have found common ground in some areas, which is a far cry better than Ford.

@jngibbs @MaximeBernier Point taken. Definitely some nations with 0s that deserve a condemnation.
@LonWoock @realDonaldTrump Hahaha illegal immigrants are allowed to vote? Citation needed.
@LonWoock @realDonaldTrump You honestly think a wall would prevent illegal entry? Give me a break. Nobody is advocating for open borders, despite what Fox News may tell you. A border wall is still stupid and impractical.

@realDonaldTrump It's funny, then, that the Senate unanimously voted against the shutdown.		A wall is not necessary or practical, regardless of how much you bloviate about it.
@MaximeBernier Should we take this to mean you support Israel repeatedly and flagrantly violating international law?
@realDonaldTrump Alternatively, don't waste money on a vanity project which will have no meaningful effect, and don't shut down government agencies responsible for protecting the border.
@realDonaldTrump Explain to me how retreating inward and abandoning allies doesn't qualify as being played by foreign actors.		The only beneficiaries of Trumpian foreign policy are Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other autocrats whose power Trump impotently craves.
@CBCAlerts An urgently needed reminder that green energy, not a pipeline, is where Alberta should be heading.		I'm sure this will be ignored like the rest of the evidence.
That goes for Canada, too.		@JustinTrudeau - it didn't make sense to pay the exit clause on the last LAV order from Saudi Arabia. That's understandable.		A hard line needs to be drawn now - no future sales. https://t.co/logCEiLHxT
