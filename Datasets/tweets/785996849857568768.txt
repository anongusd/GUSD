We are so excited to share that we have brought on TWO interns for this upcoming semester. These individuals are bright, talented and will be such an amazing addition to the team. We look forward to bragging about them in the coming months! More details to come!
Once we have worked with these offices waiting on guidance we will make public who IS and who ISNT paying their interns. Please email us if you have any questions info@payourinterns.com
Point of clarification: over the next few weeks our team will finalize the data on who is offering paid internships and who isn’t. The newly allocated funds DO NOT require members to use the funds. Many offices are waiting on guidelines on how to use the funds.

@ThePerezHilton We have a BIG problem with unpaid internships. When they’re unpaid you are only offering it to those who can AFFORD to take it on. By paying you provide equal opportunity. Interning for credit is a double whammy, paying for credit while still finding money to make ends meet

For everyone that's asking how members are going to pay their interns, well we fixed that two months ago when a bipartisan group of legislators came together and passed $13.8 million dollars in funding for interns.

@michaeldotgov @Ocasio2018 Yup.  It's something we fought hard for. Now we need to make sure every member uses these funds (they don't have to).

@LBOcean111 Yes, please do!
@LBOcean111 It is. Problem is the funds aren't mandatory. Offices can choose not to use the funds.
@KevinMLevy @narbit95 @brianschatz @jonfavs Yup. We made sure when it was written that members could only use it for intern compensation because if not it will never actually go to interns.
@narbit95 @brianschatz @jonfavs Good point Noah.  The way it was written only allows for it to be used on intern compensation. With that being said the funds don't have to be used by the office. That's where we come in, we're monitoring and ensuring each office is using these funds in an equitable way.
@Ocasio2018 Thank you Congresswoman-Elect for shedding light on the issue we are so passionate about. We are so excited to know we have another ally in Congress! #PayOurInterns

@AmberStocksdale @Ocasio2018 Hi Amber, there won't be a need for that since Congress appropriated $13.8 million for intern compensation. So all members need to do is tap into that funding to pay interns. https://t.co/L5q8LomxyZ
@BMartindc @JStein_WaPo @saikatc @Ocasio2018 @DPAQreport Good point. However that rule does not apply to the new funding House offices will receive. We worked with @RepTimRyan to secure $8.8 million for intern compensation. Each office will receive $20k but it will come from a separate account so it won't be impacted by the cap.
.@marisa_schultz thank you for shining a light on this and asking the hard questions. When the press holds elected officials accountable we make progress.

@Row_Boat_Cop @michaelwhitney No its not. @SenSchumer doesn't need this new funding to pay his interns. As the minority leader he has one of the largest budgets. He has no excuse to not pay his interns, especially when half of the Dem caucus started to pay their interns before this new funding kicked in.

@isaiah_kb @ChloDubs @michaelwhitney https://t.co/n0fnTW4FxQ
@isaiah_kb @ChloDubs @michaelwhitney Yup, we worked to get $8.8 million for House interns so each office will receive $20k to pay interns.  The funding will come in a separate account from the MRA so the staffing cap rule will not apply to these funds.
1. @SenSchumer came to Congress in 1969, as a *drum roll* PAID INTERN ($1,800/mth). source: https://t.co/WfLwJb63UH 	2. As a the minority leader he has always had the funds to pay his interns. 	3. He's receiving $65,000 to pay his interns for 2019. #cutmycheck #payourinterns https://t.co/1VpbiqWHD5

next year. POI was founded by former unpaid interns with no major funding from any foundation, business or donor. But we had grit and a determination to get interns paid. We are thankful to have assistance along the way from @dandpcs, Peck Madigan Jones, @Phone2Action. Congress
The Senate voted to pass the minibus (the leg. branch was attached to) on Wed., the House did the same Thurs. So we went from $0 in secured funding to $14million for intern compensation in one year. This will allow thousands of youth from all backgrounds to be able to intern
W/ the help of @JeffFortenberry and @RepTimRyan we were able to secure $8.8 million for House interns. came out to $20k per office. Leadership in both approps committees @NitaLowey @USRepRodney @SenShelby  @SenatorLeahy @SteveDaines were instrumental in making this a reality.
However there was still a way to make this happen. Both chambers would be going into conference and iron out the bills they had passed. During conference we could push for the House to take up the same provision as the Senate. And we did, even though we knew the chances were slim
This funding meant each office would receive about $50k for intern compensation and could only be used for that. Our next target was the House, but they had already completed their approps process. Now we had to wait until  next year to push for any legislation on the House side.
Besides the senators and their awesome staff, we had some partners on the outside. @congressfdn decided to step in send a letter of support on this legislation and @CollegeDems @collegegop pushed college students to write letters/emails to their members to vote yes on this.
..with @brianschatz proposal of $5million for intern pay. It was a long shot, and didn't really have a chance to pass. But we pushed diligently, with the help of a bipartisan group of senators @lisamurkowski @ChrisVanHollen @ChrisMurphyCT @SenatorCollins it passed unanimously!
Other senators who then started paying their interns included @SenCortezMasto @RonWyden @SenatorDurbin @CoryBooker @ChrisMurphyCT @SenatorMenendez @SenBennetCO. While we were excited with these mini-wins we knew that the long-term solution was legislation. We decided to go

was titled "Experience Doesn't Pay the Bills",listed the offices who paid and didn't, included 2 policy recommendations- one of them was for Congress to have a system-wide paid internship program just like they did from 1973-1994 with the LBJ program. https://t.co/uPdPQ97tYY
Now that we had the info, we went back to offices and made the case why they should pay their interns. We also let them know that we were going to make this data public. That was enough to convince some offices to switch from unpaid to paid. The report	https://t.co/6QetLqrsCe
So we collected that on our own. After collecting the info of all 500+ offices, we crunched the numbers, found out about 50% of Republicans in the Senate paid their interns, for Dems it was under 30%. In the House 90% of members didn't pay their interns. https://t.co/c8Tvu6hhlq

@YoungInvincible A8: Treat our interns like salaried members of the team. Invite them to meetings, give them meaningful work, and listen to their ideas. #MillennialMon #PayOurInterns
@YoungInvincible A8: Pay Your Interns! If you have interns you should pay them. You’ll see how many more candidates of color start to apply when you offer paid ones. #MillennialMon #PayOurInterns
A7: @YoungInvincible  🐸☕️ We're just going to leave this one right here. Served to you fresh and hot. #MillennialMon #PayOurInterns https://t.co/AyzSq1Dd2X
@YoungInvincible A7: Equity means fairness for all. And we know that because of America’s history and past laws and policies, not all families start from the same starting point. How much money your parents have should not prevent you from getting an internship	#MillennialMon #PayOurInterns
A7: Unfortunately no, but that’s why POI was started. A lot of students don’t bother applying to unpaid internships because they can’t afford to work for free. Did you know it can cost a young adult 7K+ to intern?! #MillennilMon #PayOurInterns https://t.co/fU5qg0FIul
A6: The city is your playground. Use it! There are tens of thousands of interns just like you during the summer -- meet some of them and learn from them. You never know what that relationship can do for you in the future. #MillennialMon https://t.co/l3fSvqSCpj
@YoungInvincible A6: Take advantage of events outside the office. Whether it’s a talk at a bookstore, a speaker at an event, or a panel at a think-tank, these are opportunities for you to network and also hear from people within your field. #MillennialMon
@YoungInvincible A5: No one place is the same! Internship experience vary from place to place and even person to person. Didn't have a good experience? That's OK, you learn from it! #MillennialMon
A4: Share your experience! You never know who is looking for feedback and your comments may convince someone to apply for an internship or potentially shift career focus. #MillennialMon https://t.co/eSciC8q3QT
A4: Be clear and concise about what you did and talk about how your role supported the team. Interns are valuable so let that shine through! #MillenniallMon https://t.co/eSciC8q3QT

@YoungInvincible A2: Write a thank-you letter to your supervisor and others in the organization who you worked with. Be genuine but be sure to include what you learned from your internship #MillennialMon
@YoungInvincible A2: You don’t need to have the letter of rec written, but you should get a written commitment from your supervisor that they would write one for you in the future. #MillennialMon
A1: Paid summer internships allow students of lower socioeconomic backgrounds the opportunity to gain real work experience. #MillennialMon #PayOurInterns https://t.co/YLXclvrIoL

@YoungInvincible A1: Summer Internships give students the opportunity to gain real life experience before pursuing careers.  #MillennialMon #PayOurInterns

@YoooooooSheNice 3k for rent for 3 months which amounts to 1k a month. This study is based on rent prices in DC, NYC, LA, SF which happen to be the major intern hubs in the country. Obviously if you're interning in Nebraska it's going to be much cheaper.
