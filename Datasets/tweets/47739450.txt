Next, we'll see how much money Trump can find under the cushions to use for (a few) more miles of new barrier. No, it's not what he promised, and his voters can judge him on that. But some progress from a border security standpoint.
On border deal: Yes, Trump got far less than he wanted. But from barrier policy standpoint, it's an improvement. Trump can already replace 125 miles of inadequate fence with real barrier. Now, he can add 55 miles of new, real barrier in Rio Grande sector. Incremental, but better.

Stone charged with lying when he told House he didn't ask Credico to communicate with Assange when he did make that request. Also charged with lying when he told House he and Credico talked on phone but did not exchange emails when they did use email.  4/6

Some good Roger Stone color (Frank Pentangeli!), but Stone basically charged with lying to House about his communications with Credico and Jerome Corsi over supposed second-hand communications and efforts to communicate with Julian Assange.

Read @KimStrassel on Bruce Ohr, the dossier, and the FBI. https://t.co/d9G5ao9mSx
Didn't keep up with day's coverage; but don't think Buzzfeed incident will really change anything. Tone of some coverage has more to do with emotions and longings than anything else. That's not going to change.
Later, re-read Mueller/Cohen documents. Buzzfeed piece didn't seem consistent with them. Why would prosecutors specifically say Trump directed Cohen to violate campaign finance laws, but remain silent on Trump directing Cohen to lie to Congess? Odd.
Haven't said much about Buzzfeed debacle. Was skeptical moment I saw it; I covered Valerie Plame affair, remembered author. But had other things to do yesterday; expressed caution and moved on.

Look at what the administration is doing on border barrier, and it's actually quite reasonable. So far about 40 miles of 'steel slats' built, officials say, replacing worst of old fencing. Another 75 underway with current funding. So that's 115 miles... https://t.co/dMtZIlGrw6

Do you have some issue with the statement that a large majority of lawmakers on Capitol Hill are not lawyers?	https://t.co/Dx58h36fr5
There are 1,338,678 lawyers in US (according to ABA) out of total population of 327,167,434. Most people, including large majority of lawmakers on Cap Hill, are not lawyers. They can't speak on legal/ethical issues?	https://t.co/rRZQI15FBb
Knew someone would say, 'But this is a special situation...' If that were the case, you'd think there would be at least one previous example the DOJ ethics official could cite that resulted in recusal...	https://t.co/J569bTXQx0
Think of precedent for incoming cabinet officer: Expression of opinion on some aspect of department's work would require recusal from supervising that part of the department? A crazy standard. Whitaker made right decision.   9/9  End. https://t.co/2FEzwzFvMH
Given the weakness of DOJ ethics official's case, Whitaker decided he 'does not wish to create the first precedent requiring recusal in a 'close call' situation.' 8/9
Also: DOJ ethics official 'did not identify any examples' of a previous AG, acting or not, recusing himself for such reasons. Best previous example ethics official could cite did not result in recusal.  7/9
The DOJ ethics official conceded that Whitaker's public comments did not even require a formal ethics recommendation. And conceded it was a 'close call...'  6/9
5) Despite all that, DOJ ethics official said there were 'circumstances other than those specifically described' in regulations that meant Whitaker should recuse. Specifically: 'Public comments prior to his re-joining the Department...'  5/9
4) DOJ ethics official examining Whitaker also concluded 'there was not a personal or business relationship' with anybody else that would require recusal from Mueller probe.  4/9
3) DOJ ethics official examining Whitaker also concluded 'there was not a personal or political relationship' with any person who is a subject of or would be directly affected by Mueller probe. 3/9
1) Whitaker did all required ethics reviews on possible Mueller conflict of interest. 2) The DOJ ethics official concluded there was 'no actual conflict' involving Whitaker and Mueller...  2/9

So beyond the freakout, Trump is asking questions that, most likely, many Americans ask about these military commitments. Will be interesting to see what public thinks on the Syria, Afghanistan issues. 5/5 End.
For example, beyond the Trump pledge to 'knock the hell out of ISIS,' what is the US goal in Syria? How do our 2k troops there bring that about? And in Afghanistan, what will continued involvement accomplish that we have not been able to accomplish in the last *17* years? 4/5
Third, what's happening is the president is asserting himself and his view of the world, which is the view he campaigned and won election on. He is asking questions for which the national security establishment does not have clear, indisputable answers. 3/5
Second, it is not exactly unprecedented for a SecDef to leave, over policy differences or otherwise. Mattis served longer than any of Barack Obama's last *three* SecDefs, Panetta, Hagel, Carter.  2/5
Somewhat louder-than-normal freakout over Trump and Mattis departure. A few thoughts. First, the willingness of leaders like Mattis and Kelly to serve in this administration has been a great service to the country. Thank them. 1/5

One vexing question for Comey: In FBI interview, did Flynn, former DIA chief, ever refer to fact that his conversations with Kislyak were recorded by US intelligence? How could he not know? https://t.co/gFrugoOauQ
We've seen snippets from James Comey that FBI agents who interviewed Michael Flynn didn't think he intentionally lied to them. But FBI has refused to release documents. Now, with Comey on Hill, a chance to ask questions: https://t.co/DfFTZppAUl
House investigators interview James Comey today. Time to learn more about the FBI and the Michael Flynn case: https://t.co/XcTqTwBuVz
New report about Justice Department efforts to 'rein in' the president after Comey firing. 'Range of options' was discussed, 'including the idea of Rosenstein wearing a wire while speaking with Trump.' From @CNN: 	https://t.co/ACs15sf0QV
https://t.co/cLvrIzia4x
Thank you for your insights. Asking Comey the questions listed would shed light on that, no? Public release of full questions and answers would be good, too, no?	https://t.co/4rmxiVAsmp
10) Other than Flynn-Kislyak talks, does Comey know of other instances in which Flynn did anything as part of a conspiracy with Russia to fix 2016 election? If so, what? 7/7 End. https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
8) Did Comey believe Flynn would be indicted for lying to FBI? 9) When did he learn Flynn would be charged/plead?  6/7 https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
6) Did Flynn, former DIA chief, ever refer to fact that his conversations with Kislyak were recorded by US intelligence? Ever acknowledge that transcripts were available to FBI officials? 7) What other evidence did FBI have that Flynn lied to agents?  5/7 https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
5) If agents did not think Flynn lied, how to reconcile differences between what he said in interview and in Flynn-Kislyak conversation transcript?  4/7 https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
1) Did Comey ever see wiretaps of Flynn-Kislyak conversations? 2) Did he see 302 from Flynn interview? 3) Ever discuss Flynn interview with agents who questioned him? 4) Did agents think Flynn tried to deceive them?  3/7 https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
But what about Michael Flynn? Comey spoke privately to Congress about Flynn in 2017, but public has only tiny snippets of what he said. This time, House can question, then release full transcript. So some questions:  2/7 https://t.co/vJYaVNWOCu
House will question Comey tomorrow. Some members didn't want to; wanted Rosenstein instead. But Comey it is, so what to ask? Some Rs will hit Hillary emails, while others say that's over, done with. Others will focus on Trump-Russia, dossier.  1/7 https://t.co/CKbiKw7yfa

But what about Tom (Gaudette), Bernie (McCarthy), and Squi (Chris Garrett)? If July 1 was the party in question, as some suggest, that would make them possible witnesses, no? Dems could contact, question. Somebody could have asked Ford yesterday.  3/5
It all matches up, they say. Ford said Mark Judge and Patrick J. Smyth were at party where she was allegedly attacked, and sure enough, there they are in Kavanaugh diary entry for 7/1/82 party. Voila!  2/5
This is confusing. Some anti-Kavanaugh types think they've found something significant in diary for July 1, 1982. Entry: 'Tobin's house -- Workout/Go to Timmy's for Skis w/Judge, Tom, PJ, Bernie, Squi.'  1/5

One feature of confirmation hearings, usually, is hat-in-hand nominee obsequiously thanking senators for their questions, no matter how hostile. Kind of refreshing to see that thrown completely out the window.
Push the nominee to his very limit -- Gang rapes! New allegations! Assault! -- and then, when he shows anger, tell him it's not a good look.
Kavanaugh to Democrats on Judiciary Committee: 'You have replaced 'advice and consent' with 'search and destroy.''
Question to Sen. Cornyn on Christine Ford: 'Did you find her credible?' 'I found no reason to find her not credible.'
Mitchell, just now: 'Dr. Ford, we're almost done.' https://t.co/tK8gHso8ya
To put it mildly, this hearing isn't working for GOP. Dems are asking big, meaningful questions. What do you remember? What did you feel? Could it have been anyone else? Getting big, meaningful answers. GOP's Mitchell focusing on little stuff. Huge contrast.
On Fox, Chris Wallace says hearing so far is 'disaster' for Republicans...

Remember some Dems said, no, let's don't filibuster Gorsuch, force McConnell to go nuclear. Gorsuch has too much support; seat is straight 1-for-1 replacement of conservative Justice Scalia. Not right time.  2/4

Think fair summary would be: I believe if confirmed to SCOTUS Brett Kavanaugh would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Therefore, I believe he attacked Christine Ford at a high-school party in 1982. https://t.co/VHN8ctbvuJ

The other reason is lack of investigation: 'No investigation--any legitimate investigation is going to happen between now and Monday.' So now, it appears Ford is a definite no, and Democrats will have to unite behind--Surprise!--calling for additional delay.
According to her lawyers, Ford's refusal to appear at Monday hearing is based on two reasons. One is her state of mind. 'Since coming forward, her life has been turned upside down. Rushing forward into a hearing when she's under this much pressure isn't the way to do it.'  1/2

In any event, damage is done; Dems already talking about a Justice Kavanaugh as stain on SCOTUS. Just wait: If he is confirmed, resistance types will talk about the rapist on the Supreme Court.  7/7  End.
So right now, it might be that Dems like to protest lack of FBI investigation more than they actually want an FBI investigation. 6/7
Not sure Dems really want to go down that road. They would prefer hearing from experts on victimization, that sort of thing. Plus, they'd like to make loud drunk Mark Judge a stand-in for Kavanaugh. All that -- but not Ford's credibility... 5/7
Also: Do we know whether Ford herself wants to take part in an FBI investigation? Bureau would be asking a lot of questions about her, looking for details, witnesses, corroboration, reputation for honesty, social media, etc. 4/7
So FBI could look into this case. But it would take time; no way investigation could be done by Monday. Republicans see Dem game, don't want to get into weeks-long delay. So no FBI investigation.  3/7
In background checks, FBI talks to old neighbors, old business associates, friends, enemies, colleagues, all sorts of people. Looks for things like alcoholism, philandering, honesty, stuff that could lead to trouble in public office. Not to prosecute, but to tell Senate...  2/7

Kavanaugh this morning:	https://t.co/awXInLQrCy
So what about timing? Original plan had been for final Kavanaugh confirmation vote around Sept 28. That leaves time for delay and still finish before midterms. Gonna have to be some agreement between Senate GOP and White House. Not clear what it will be. 6/6 End.
What about White House? Conway out this morning saying Ford 'should not be ignored or insulted. She should be heard.' But that is not definitive on question of hearing, versus background investigation call.  5/6
Will there be hearing? Appears Sens. Collins, Murkowski, Flake are in driver's seat on this. If they push for hearing, it will happen, whatever other Republicans think. That's the price of a razor-thin GOP majority. 4/6
Now, Judiciary chairman Grassley prefers what is called a 'background investigation' call, in which senators talk to Ford &amp; Kavanaugh (separately) to learn more about the story. Dems calling for hearing (although not now; Durbin wants weeks).  3/6
GOP points out Feinstein had meeting with Kavanaugh, could have had confidential meeting.  1300 questions for record were submitted to Kavanaugh, 32 hours of public testimony. Ford was never brought up; GOP obviously sees what is happening now as political. 2/6

Some notes, from phone talks this morning: Among some senators, great reluctance to re-open Kavanaugh hearings. Accuser Ford went to WaPo in July, to Congress in July, retained lawyer in July, took polygraph early August. Dems had many days to bring up. 1/6
On CNN, Sen. Durbin on Christine Ford allegation against Brett Kavanaugh: She must testify. But not now! This week? 'I think it's too fast.'
Kellyanne Conway on Fox says she has talked with the president, who thinks Christine Ford should be heard, and also Kavanaugh, on allegations, and then Senate should move on with nomination.

And even though Mueller has had the cooperation of Flynn, Gates, and lots of witnesses, not to mention zillions of documents, and the case is still, according to this belief, unmakeable without Manafort. Maybe that's true. But seems a stretch. 2/2
Hearing much excitement from usual suspects about Manafort plea. This is the big one! But that appears based on belief there is big conspiracy that only Manafort's testimony can reveal. Even though no one has been charged with any role in it so far...  1/2

Should add that I *hope* a proceeding in which judges approve wiretap that could reach deep into presidential campaign at height of campaign is atypical. https://t.co/xipDHuD0Jm
Fallback argument is now that FISA hearings are not 'typical.' 1) I said that. And 2) Hard to imagine a more atypical case that one involving wiretapping an American over allegations of foreign infiltration of presidential campaign at height of campaign.
For those who so confidently declared that hearings are *never* part of FISA warrant application process, option of hearing is specifically provided for in FISC rules. See below, and thread from @DavidKris https://t.co/pG9g0C11bO plus my thread from yest: https://t.co/HLGjCqz8sQ https://t.co/5CWxGjQJV7
Kenneth Starr has written a memoir of his time as independent counsel. From excerpt in @WSJ: 'I deeply regret that I took on the Lewinsky phase of the investigation...[but] the president had to be investigated for perjury.' https://t.co/Tgyc4d3H50 https://t.co/mIzfAJxDJb
So: Given precedent of hearings, not at all unreasonable to ask whether FISA hearing was held before wiretapping American in context of presidential campaign. And newsworthy that it wasn't done. End.
And 3) It is not unreasonable to suggest that when FISA court was asked permission to wiretap US person, and application referred to 'Candidate #1' 'Candidate #2' 'Political Party #1' during campaign -- well, red flags might have arisen.
Next, touching back with sources, a few additions: 1) Most FISA warrants are on foreigners, don't involve highest level of scrutiny, including hearings. 2) There have been hearings for FISA warrant applications that are particularly controversial.
A few things. First, I included graf from govt filing saying FISA court 'typically' doesn't hold hearings. 'The FISC typically considers FISA warrant applications based on written submissions and may decide matters without holding a hearing.' Are 'typically' and 'may' definitive?

One can see KFILE, Twitter mobs, others dig, dig, digging. Didn't happen--wasn't possible--in Clinton era or even Plame affair juries. Seems inevitable with confluence of social media and Trump Resistance.  4/4 End
Either way, journalists, freelance Resistance types will search for jurors' names. And then: Have they ever posted anything objectionable on social media? Have their children? Relatives? Any questionable online associations?   3/4
In that case, doxxing seems inevitable if jurors' names become public. That's why media request was troubling. One thing for jurors to come forward, speak voluntarily. Another to have court reveal their identities...  2/4
Thinking about Manafort jury and social media. First trial of Trump era. Resistance feels morally justified doing anything. So what if jury returns verdict and Resistance disapproves? Maybe mixed decision viewed as insufficiently punitive?  1/4

The Story That Would Not Die. https://t.co/K80McqlN3w https://t.co/fe9eQ9s2Tc
In Oct 2016, FBI told court Carter Page was 'agent of a foreign power,' probable cause to believe his 'activities involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes.' Not clear why he hasn't been indicted, especially given Mueller's penchant for FARA charges.

FBI 'speculates' footnote that people opposing Trump might be behind 'identified U.S. person' who hired 'Source #1' for dossier is really tortured. Since FBI calls GOP 'Political Party #1' and Trump 'Candidate #1,' why not say 'Political Party #2' and 'Candidate #2' did it?
You know that misleading Washington Post story claiming 'Trump campaign guts GOP’s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine'? The FBI cited it in its application to wiretap Carter Page. https://t.co/je3x1oLyrL  and  https://t.co/GdZawY3pB7
She seems to be arguing that the good stuff that supports her position is blacked out.	 https://t.co/GtN5NZDTk4 https://t.co/qljyF01Njq
Link: Carter Page FISA application, via @JudicialWatch: https://t.co/e1GaEQccjc
But the application seems a weak mix of Page's history, the dossier, and a bunch of press reports of varying reliability. And that's how a wiretap of a US citizen in the incredibly consequential Trump-Russia investigation was approved?  14/14 End.
Now again, there are lots of blacked-out parts. Perhaps they make it all make sense. And perhaps this seems old news because the FBI only released the parts that have already been made public.  13/14
22) In sum, the FBI believes Page is a) an agent of Russia; b) will 'engage in clandestine activities' on Russia's behalf; and c) those activities 'involve or are about to involve violations of the criminal statutes.' 23) Therefore, wiretap Carter Page.  12/14
20) Also on September 25, Page sent a letter to the FBI denying the allegations in the Isikoff article. 21) On September 26, the Post's Rogin posted an interview with Page in which Page called the allegations 'garbage' and said he did not meet with Sechin or Divyekin.  11/14
17) The FBI does not believe Source #1 [Steele] 'directly provided' the information to Isikoff. 18) Isikoff wrote that Page's role in the campaign is 'unclear.' 19) On September 25, 2016, Kellyanne Conway told CNN Page was 'not part of the campaign I'm running.'  10/14
15) On September 23, 2016, Michael Isikoff of Yahoo wrote that U.S. intelligence received reports that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin in Moscow. 16) Isikoff wrote that members of Congress were 'taken aback' by the alleged meetings.   9/14
14) In August 2016, Michael Crowley of Politico wrote that Trump adopted a 'milder' tone on Russia's annexation of Crimea, which could have possibly, maybe been the influence of Page.  8/14
13) In July 2016, Josh Rogin of the Washington Post wrote that the Trump campaign worked to make sure the GOP platform did not call for arms to Ukraine. (For the whole story, see here: https://t.co/K80McqlN3w ) 7/14
10) The FBI believes Source #1 is credible, even though he's working for someone whom the FBI 'speculates" is trying to discredit Trump. 11) The FBI has paid Steele. 12) Steele said Page and Divyekin discussed possible 'kompromat' on Hillary Clinton.   6/14
9) The FBI has a source, "Source #1" [dossier author Christopher Steele], who says Page met with Sechin and Divyekin, discussed lifting US sanctions.  5/14
6) Years later, in New York, some Russians tried to recruit Page [unsuccessfully]. 7) Page gave at least one interview to the FBI. 8) In July 2016, Page gave a speech in Moscow.  4/14
4) The FBI 'believes that the Russian Government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with [the Trump campaign].' 5) From 2004-2007, Page lived in Moscow, working in the energy business.  3/14
1) The FBI believes Page has been recruited by the Russians. 2) Page is a former adviser to Donald Trump. 3) Russia, as always, is trying to influence the US election.   2/14
On the newly-released Carter Page FISA wiretap application: There are many blacked-out paragraphs and pages. I don't know what is in them. That said, here, from the unredacted portions, is the dog's breakfast of a case the FBI made for wiretapping Page:  1/14

4) He doesn't want to give even an inch to his adversaries. 5) He really wants to improve relations with Russia. 6) He believes Sen. Charles "Six ways from Sunday" Schumer, suspects elements of IC are out to get him.
Twelve theories, some more plausible than others, on why Trump does not accept Intelligence Community verdict on Russian election interference: 1) He really doesn't believe it. 2) He can't admit anything that casts doubt on his victory. 3) He thinks it's an Obama plot.

Trump missed opportunity to say: I believe the verdict of US agencies. Russia did it. We've retaliated and we'll do more. But my adversaries at home have turned this into a politically motivated crusade, and it's time to stop it.  End.
Instead, Trump refused to say, went on about DNC servers (a legitimate issue, but not in that context), and made clear to the world he doesn't support US position over Russia's. That's the appalling part. 6/
So in response to 'Who do you believe?' question in Helsinki, Trump could simply have said I believe the House Intel, Senate Intel, and IC.  5/
At same time, nothing wrong with Trump fighting back hard against get-Trump part of investigation -- the 'witch hunt' part.  4/
But no reason Trump could not accept verdicts of House Intel, Senate Intel, IC (and, yes, Mueller) that Russia tried to interfere in US election. That's the what-Russia-did part, and Trump could endorse that finding.  3/
Trump clearly believes if he gives an inch on the what-Russia-did part, his adversaries will take a mile on the get-Trump part. That's consistent with how Trump approaches other problems...  2/
Concerning Trump's newser remarks specifically on Trump-Russia affair: Appalling. There have always been two parts to T-R investigation: the what-Russia-did part and the get-Trump part. Trump's problem has always been his refusal/inability to separate the two...  1/

Strzok would be easily the most consequential witness who has appeared before congressional investigators trying to learn what happened in FBI Trump-Russia investigation.  3/3
Instead, focus on Trump-Russia investigation, in which Strzok is the Man Who Knows Everything. Tell us about Papadopoulos. Mifsud. The EC. What about London? Halper? Steele? Dossier? Fusion? Page? FISA? And much, much more.   2/3
So if Peter Strzok does testify before Congress, hard to see why lawmakers would waste too much time beating him up for bias. OK, you don't like Trump. We get that...  1/3

Question for Horowitz: Did your various tech efforts, including enlisting DoD tech as last-ditch attempt, uncover other Strzok-Page texts from period when FBI collection was said to be in operation, that FBI did not turn over to IG?
IG Horowitz clearly proud of efforts to recover 'missing' Strzok-Page texts. Strzok 'We'll stop it' text not recovered until early May. Text date--August 2016--was during time normal FBI data collection was in place, but somehow wasn't preserved. Took DoD technology to find.

David Fay now saying he would have favored DQ for Mickelson; cites Rule 33-7, below. Is USGA going to reconsider 2-stroke penalty? Fay: 'I don't think the rules contemplate something like this at the highest level.' https://t.co/A9ggXqMEIW
Just watched replay. David Fay, while noting it was 2-stroke penalty, said one could almost argue for more, given distance ball would have roll had Mickelson not stopped it.	 https://t.co/FmFLEPS7b2
John Daly hit a moving ball on green in 1999 USOpen. Like Phil, got 2-stroke penalty. (Daly actually whacked ball back into fairway, where he had to chip onto green.) https://t.co/duZKmkpXsM
Agree with you on Mickelson career. But he explained to @golf_strange that he struck ball specifically to keep it from rolling off green. Recalls Rule 1-2 decision about player intentionally stopping ball to keep it from rolling into hazard--a DQ offense. https://t.co/htmrA6msmu https://t.co/5ijwMMPXTM
I like Mickelson. I wanted him to win. But this was an egregious, intentional rules violation, certainly in the spirit of violations that call for disqualification. @usopengolf https://t.co/MOl7sUEuHC
In this case, perhaps PO'd should equal DQ'd.	https://t.co/wPcB930Aud
Bottom line, on first impression, two stroke penalty seems light for what Mickelson did. Phil said he specifically did it to keep ball from rolling off green and down hill. Again, Rule 1-2 decisions: https://t.co/8VaZVTJWTk : https://t.co/wPyZN1tYU0
Rule 14-5 or Rule 1-2? Here are both, from USGA: https://t.co/df3OP1KdVd  and  https://t.co/J2w0QpkCTk  USGA called Rule 14-5 on Phil. But look at decisions for Rule 1-2 below.

Facts of case are what matter: At roughly same time FBI proposed to pay Clinton operative (a former real spy) to compile dossier on Trump, FBI informant insinuated himself into Trump campaign at height of election. Worth investigating, no?
Folks: The 'spy' vs. 'informant' semantic fight is dumb. In media talk, seem to be two big objections to 'spy.' 1) Actual spies say that's not what Halper did, not tradecraft. 2) Trump used 'spy,' therefore must be rejected. Fine. 'Informant' is a perfectly good, accurate word.
If true, doesn't matter. Clinton hired/paid Fusion, Fusion hired/paid Steele.	https://t.co/hSPVhWTFRm
Given pay arrangements in 2016, seems fair to call Christopher Steele a Clinton operative. So remarkable to think that at height of campaign, FBI told Clinton operative that they, FBI, had informant inside Trump campaign. Remarkable. https://t.co/0lDr5SwUrg

@MZHemingway @MichaelRWarren 1) Chait says my discussion of Trump loyalty request omitted context of Trump asking Comey to let Flynn off.

Comey talktalktalk, based in part on his still-secret memos, is going to fuel more calls for release of memos. He can send memo(s) to friend for leak to NYT. He can use them for book promotion. But public can't see? Link from February: Why are the Comey memos secret?
Also, ABC plays Comey clip this morning in which he says Moscow 'golden showers' story was still unverified when he left FBI. Does Comey believe it? 'It's possible,' he said. https://t.co/cMLHvNbGtO
Attention paid in Comey story suggests House investigators were right to focus on Trump dossier. Played key role in Trump-FBI relations.
NBC reports Mueller is readying findings on Trump obstruction of justice. Will send to DOJ before reaching conclusion on whether underlying collusion actually occurred. https://t.co/u8OfLtzH88
Comey interview with NYT: Atticus Finch is favorite literary hero; recommended 'Lean In' to FBI staff; wants Trump to read David Brooks' 'Road to Character'; would invite Niebuhr, MLK Jr., Sheryl Sandberg to literary dinner party. https://t.co/Vjzr9VgbnK
Now that full Comey book is out, will soon be fully talked over, seems likely he'll have to add tidbits to keep interest up through planned publicity extravaganza. Cap Hill types will be looking over his public &amp; private testimony in light of book, promotional revelations.

Worth noting that former British spy behind golden showers story never knew if it's true or not; has guessed there's 50-50 chance, according to Isikoff/Corn. Still, Comey pushed story with Trump, who immediately sensed he was being blackmailed. https://t.co/JLL6iqwqEf
If Trump pardons Libby, will be acting in case where special counsel Fitzgerald did not venture beyond core case, as Mueller has, but stretched out probe for years, even though he knew culprit at start. https://t.co/QOFnwpxuGG

@jbarro Yes, Fitzgerald stuck to topic. But he was assigned to find a leaker, and he knew who the leaker was *at the beginning* of the investigation. Still went on for three years; of course never charged leaker with anything. https://t.co/zZEpo6xaXn

I know everything is about Trump, but fact is, House GOP faces huge historical trends in November. Clinton lost 54 seats in first midterm. Obama 63. Didn't happen to GWBush because of 9/11. Barring big event, would be miracle if this president did *not* lose House.
