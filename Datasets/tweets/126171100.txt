This has kept me optimistic and hopeful throughout my time in Congress. Happy New Year! I hope you and your family and friends enjoyed the holidays, and I wish you all peace and good health in 2019.
Since I decided to retire last year, I have received many kind notes. I thank you all for that and for the great privilege of serving you in Congress. Every day in this job, I was reminded that Americans are good people who work hard, care about issues, and deserve to be heard.
The next Congress must also be bold and act with courage. It must address climate change, pass legislation to reduce gun violence, and raise the min wage, which is so low it is denying many their chance at the American dream.
Despite these gains, there is work to do. Congress must fix our broken campaign finance laws, which give corporations &amp; special interests too much power. I didn’t take corporate PAC or DC lobbyist money. The American people deserve to know who is spending money in our elections.
By passing the #ACA, we lowered the number of uninsured Americans dramatically. I am thankful for the millions of people who joined together to secure this landmark legislation and who have fought to protect the progress we’ve made.
In 2006, you granted me the great privilege of representing you in Congress. I'm so proud of what we have accomplished together. We enacted the Post- 9/11 GI Bill, repealed the hateful “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, and put limits on toxic burn pits overseas.
REALLY? https://t.co/5LaqPYbneo
I am deeply grateful for Sec. Mattis’s decades of public service and for his dedication to our country and the safety of all Americans. His resignation is extremely concerning, and everyone should read his letter to the president.

Six years ago, 20 elementary school children and six school employees were killed at Sandy Hook. Since that horrible day, we have endured far too many shootings. Congress needs to finally take action.
I am deeply saddened by the deaths of the five Marines who lost their lives while serving our country. My thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones. 		https://t.co/NQu288K5sW
Blue Water Navy veterans have earned &amp; deserve these benefits. I am beyond disappointed that this bill, which passed the House 382-0, is being blocked by a few R Senators. Failure to enact this bill is a grave injustice &amp; a betrayal to those who served. https://t.co/aE1kAUmAYv
You can still sign up for health insurance at https://t.co/253FsqO5mt! Most Granite Staters can find a plan for under $100 a month. If you have health insurance, you might find a better plan than you currently have. The deadline to enroll is December 15th.

It was an honor to speak at the Veterans Day ceremony yesterday at the State Veterans Cemetery. I am grateful to all who have served, and their families, for standing watch. https://t.co/pUOSkhfx6V
As my time in Congress is coming to a close, I want all NH veterans to know that serving them has been a true joy and the privilege of a lifetime. Through their example, they have inspired me, and so many others, to work hard to do good and make this country better for all.
On #VeteransDay, we honor the sacrifice of those who have served our great nation and defended our freedom. Our veterans deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. As a nation, we must work together to ensure veterans have access to the health care and benefits they have earned.
Happy 243rd birthday to the @usmc. I thank all Marines for their patriotism and their service to America.

I am grateful for the first responders who put themselves in danger to save lives. I am praying for Sgt. Ron Helus and the other victims, and for their families. I am also praying that we all confront this problem and work together to reduce this scourge on our country.
I am sickened and heartbroken by yet another mass shooting. This time it was in California, but it is happening all over the country. While we don't know the specific motives yet, we do know that our nation has got to tackle this problem &amp; that Congress has failed to do its part.

The #AffordableCareAct Care Act has changed people’s lives for the better. Health insurance has meant that more Americans can lead happy and healthier lives without the fear of bankruptcy or choosing between necessary expenses like food or rent and medical care if they get sick.
When I ran a social services agency before @HouseDemocrats passed the #AffordableCareAct, I used to have to tell clients that we couldn’t help them with some of their conditions because they didn’t have health insurance. It was heartbreaking, and many suffered without insurance.
I enjoyed speaking with UNH students in the Women and Politics class yesterday. I told them that women make up only 19% of the US House and only 300 have ever served, and that’s why we need more women to run for office.

SB3 undermines our state’s reputation for holding free and fair elections, and it hurts our democracy. The court made the right decision. https://t.co/3SvmQXqkEf
SB3 is a bad law that would make it harder for Granite Staters to exercise their fundamental right to vote. My full statement on the NH Superior Court injunction: https://t.co/fvjS7KEmVP
It used to be much easier to exercise the fundamental right to vote in NH. Since '96, our state has dropped from 4th to 40th when it comes to how easy it is to vote. Congress should restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. https://t.co/lxz4ROw9bC

Mr. Medbery is an American patriot, and we are all inspired by his service.

The Senate should not consent to President Trump, a man unfit for his own office, putting a partisan hack on the Supreme Court. #KavanaughConfirmation
The demeanor he displayed shows he is unfit to be a judge, and his partisan attacks confirm his true background as a life-long political operative who will defend dark money in politics, erode women’s health care rights, and jeopardize the privacy rights of Americans.
Not only does Judge Kavanaugh's treatment of women disqualify him from the Supreme Court, but his wildly uncontrolled testimony before the Judiciary Committee and assertions of unfounded conspiracy theories show that he can never be a fair, impartial, and nonpartisan Justice.
This is just wrong. It is a vicious attack on LGBTQ couples (most of whom cannot legally marry) that will hurt diplomacy. Speaker Ryan’s House and Mitch McConnell’s Senate must act to reverse this new policy. https://t.co/tEidB2fYkX
Wishing @JasonKander all the best as he tackles this challenge. Going public is so generous and will hopefully encourage other veterans who need help to go to the VA. If you need help or know someone who does, the VA Crisis Line is 1–800–273–8255. https://t.co/J7B8vmayP2

Dr. Ford was a credible, honest, and compelling witness. It’s right to delay the vote and update the FBI background investigation.
Today, the House passed legislation I cosponsored to help lower drug prices. The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act would prohibit health care plans from penalizing a pharmacy for telling patients if there is a lower price available for a prescription.
On #WorldLungDay, we highlight the importance of healthy lungs &amp; the need to prevent &amp; find a cure for lung diseases. My interest in this has driven many issues I've worked on: the #ACA, limiting DoD #burnpits, &amp; starting the Cong. Asthma &amp; Allergy Caucus. https://t.co/KJS8DCCtyE

Ms. Tham faces considerable danger if she is deported to Indonesia. ICE must release Ms. Tham immediately and allow her to stay with her family while all available avenues for permanent residency are pursued. This egregious miscarriage of justice must end now.
The continued detention of Etty Tham by ICE is unconscionable and must end immediately. Her detention is completely unwarranted; it ignores the request of Chief Judge Patti Saris to release her; and it is a disturbing departure from how ICE usually handles these types of cases. https://t.co/8W2KQqZx9r

Shana Tova to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashanah! Wishing you a healthy happy New Year.
Wonderful development for NH's Indonesian community. They should have permanent asylum, &amp; my office will continue providing all assistance possible to stop their unjust removal. Many have worked tirelessly to stop these deportations, &amp; I am deeply thankful https://t.co/ozZG21HSTb
Labor unions have made enormous contributions that improved the health, safety, and well-being of working men and women, but they’re under attack. Today as we honor working men and women, we know the fight for fair pay and benefits is not over.
I am grateful for his life and his long service to America. His life had many chapters, but each chapter had the same themes--his love for America, his service, his leadership, and his courage. Our country has lost a true hero. He will be greatly missed.
I am deeply saddened tonight by the passing of Sen. John McCain. The last time I spoke to Senator McCain, he walked over to my table at a restaurant in DC to tell me how much he loved NH, and said it was his second favorite state. I told him NH loved him back &amp; we certainly did.
Sen McCain has lived a life of service to his country and has always shown great courage. My thoughts and prayers are with @SenJohnMcCain and his loved ones during this difficult time.

This plan is reckless, it is an abuse of federal funds, and it has not been authorized by Congress. #DeVos must drop this scheme to use mental health funding to buy guns. If she does not, Congress must intervene to protect students from the consequences of this dangerous plan.
After severely limiting research into gun violence in schools as part of its school safety commission, it is abhorrent that @usedgov would consider this a solution to the gravely serious threat students face from mass shootings.
.@BetsyDeVosED plan to commandeer funding designated for mental health services, bullying awareness, and dropout prevention programs and, instead, to use that funding to buy firearms, will endanger students while taking away vital educational opportunities.
By weakening the #CleanPowerPlan, the Trump Admin has made a disgusting choice to place the interests of the fossil fuel industry &amp; their lobbyists above the well-being of the American people. Every American has a right to clean air &amp; water. This is a betrayal of these rights.
This is our justice system working to protect the US and our democracy, and it must be allowed to proceed without political interference. Speaker Ryan must acknowledge these mounting convictions and bring legislation to the Floor to protect Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation
This investigation is working to uncover both the facts about Russian interference in the 2016 elections and any crimes committed by members of President Trump’s inner circle.
The Department of Justice has indicted 26 Russian nationals for their role in hacking Democratic entities. And Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty, too.
The Mueller investigation has now led to the conviction of former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort on eight felony counts. Former NSA Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and former Trump Transition official and campaign aid Rick Gates pleaded guilty.

Americans and the world need and deserve a fresh start with a leader who will stand up for freedom and democracy.
Trump must step down now and spare our people a drawn-out ordeal. President Richard Nixon stepped down for far less than what Mr. Trump has done. And if he won't leave, Speaker Ryan must call for his impeachment.
its jailing and killing of Russian dissidents and journalists, and its actions to undermine our democracy, actions this president has denied. I believe President Trump is unwilling and unable to stand up for the USA and our allies.
Trump blamed the United States for deteriorating relations with Russia, instead of criticizing Russia’s illegal action to annex Crimea, its backing of Syria’s Assad Regime, its use of chemical weapons in the United Kingdom to murder British residents, ...
I am sickened by what I heard and saw from President Trump in Helsinki. His comments are disastrous for our country. He refused to back up our intelligence agencies’ unanimous conclusion that Russia interfered in our elections.
The indictments today make it crystal clear that Russian conspirators attacked our democracy and communicated with Americans to do so. President Trump should absolutely not meet alone with Putin under these circumstances.
House Republicans must immediately stop their puzzling efforts to undermine the probe and discredit American law enforcement agencies.
26 Russians. 12 Russian intelligence officers. 5 Americans, including 4 senior members of the Trump campaign. The #MuellerProbe is uncovering the truth. It needs to continue unimpeded by political interference.

74 years ago, brave troops from the US, Canada, and Great Britain stormed the beaches of France to free Europe. We can never forget the sacrifice of the thousands of soldiers who lost their lives that day. In 2014, I went to Normandy &amp; met with the heroes who fought the battle. https://t.co/BybdrCafPt
Today we honor the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our values, our freedom, and our nation. I visited Belleau Wood Battlefield &amp; American Cemetery, the site of one of the first WWI engagements for US forces, to pay my respects to America's fallen. https://t.co/mji8IeMsVR
Congratulations to Sean Cheng (and the Cooperative Middle School in Stratham) who reached the #NatGeoBee finals! The Granite State is so proud of you! Your understanding of the world is very impressive!
This afternoon, I joined a Democratic hearing on #gunviolence prevention featuring a panel of high schoolers who have been affected by violence. These kids are so brave and are leading the way in getting Congress to take action. It’s time for Speaker Ryan to listen. #neveragain https://t.co/MNueYgKszp
President Trump is continuing his attacks on women’s health care. This rule will defund #PlannedParenthood &amp; other critical health care providers and limit access to health care for so many women who need it. It cannot be allowed to move forward. #TitleX 		https://t.co/woYlxpNNa0
"Nobody knew what to do," a weeping student named Dakota told KPRC. "There was nothing we could do but run." There ARE things Congress can do. And we need to do them now! #NeverAgain.
The Senate this week passed a resolution to overturn the FCC’s repeal of #netneutrality protections. I cosponsored the resolution in the House and signed a discharge petition to force a vote. Paul Ryan should put the resolution on the floor.
The #FarmBill, which failed on the Floor, would have severely hurt seniors, children, veterans, and so many vulnerable populations. It was a shameful, cruel bill, and I am very surprised that House Republicans brought it to the Floor. My statement: https://t.co/0oJt7YnXVK
Today begins #NationalPoliceWeek, when we honor and recognize our law enforcement officers for all they do every day to keep us safe. It is also a time to remember the fallen officers who lost their lives to protect us. We will never forget their sacrifice.
The unemployment rate for #MilSpouses is 4 X the national average. It's #MilitarySpouseAppreciationDay, a day to say thanks for their personal and financial sacrifices. Proud to have introduced a bill to incentivize hiring of mil spouses. https://t.co/PsiN76BVes
Disposing of munitions in open-air burn pits poses unacceptable dangers to our servicemembers, veterans, and all who live and work near these installations. The Pentagon needs to stop this and take action to mitigate the ongoing threats to public health. https://t.co/q1hM4MDsJq
This is the right decision. Our Seacoast communities deserve answers about how PFC contamination is impacting their health.  https://t.co/pV55NTL8F4
We should steer our nation down the pathway to a safer and more peaceful world, not the pathway to war. This decision will make Americans and people all across the world less safe. We should side with our allies and stay with them in the #IranDeal. 		My statement: https://t.co/S9iFGlv7te

Not clear to me at all, @SpeakerRyan. "To be clear, that decision was based on my duty to ensure that the House has the kind of pastoral services that it deserves."
I &amp; three other Members led 148 of our colleagues in asking Paul Ryan why he fired Father Conroy. There was no good reason to force him out. Religious bias played a role. I'm very happy Father Conroy has decided to serve the remainder of his term. Ryan should let him stay. https://t.co/9IKaDSkXkk
On #WorldPressFreedomDay, we celebrate the free press, the 1st Amendment, &amp; the values we hold dear as a democratic society. We look to hardworking journalists to uncover the truth and strengthen our understanding of what’s happening in our country and all across the world.

Today, three colleagues and I led 148 Members of Congress in sending a letter to Speaker Ryan asking why he fired Father Conroy, the Chaplain of the House. Ryan says because some Republican Members asked him to. Religious bias.

I am pleased that EPA recognizes the importance of the Breton’s Cleaners Brownfield project and will be providing a $200K grant to clean up the site. Somersworth has already committed resources to revitalize the riverfront, &amp; EPA’s recognition of those efforts is well deserved.

19 years ago, 12 students and a teacher were killed at Columbine High School. Today, young people across the nation are making their voices heard and demanding that Congress finally take action to prevent gun violence. It’s time we listened.

With just 27% of Americans believing the #GOPtaxscam was a good idea, it’s astounding that the WH dispatched two super-wealthy multi-millionaires to sell Granite Staters on how this plan will be good for the middle class when it’s clearly a massive tax giveaway to the wealthy.
Most disgusting of all, the bill for this windfall for the wealthy will be nearly $2 trillion. Americans will have to pay for this in cuts to funding for education, infrastructure, the environment, and healthcare.
When it comes to corporations, shareholders are seeing a windfall, with JP Morgan predicting stock buy-backs will rise from $527B last year to as much as $800B this year, while fewer than 45 of the large companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 have passed on any benefit to workers.
Morgan Stanley predicted that just 13 percent of the #GOPtaxscam benefits will trickle down to workers while #WallStreet bonuses have jumped 17 percent to nearly $185,000.
Six years ago, Greenland Police Chief Michael Maloney was killed in the line of duty while he was helping serve a warrant. The suspect was armed and opened fire on the officers. We will always remember Chief Maloney's bravery and service to his community. 	https://t.co/BuHJudCAb4

Last night began Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel. We must never forget Nazi atrocities or stop working to prevent war crimes and human suffering across the globe.
It's only fair that women get paid what they've earned! Small businesses, families, and our economy suffer when women earn just 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. Let’s pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct so more workers can have #EqualPayForEqualWork. #EqualPayDay
55 years ago today, 129 sailors and civilians perished aboard the USS Thresher. Among those lost were many Granite Staters and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard workers. We will never forget their sacrifice. I'll be introducing legislation to establish a memorial at Arlington Cemetery.

Our servicemembers are patriots. It is wrong to deny anyone with the courage to serve from joining or serving in our military because of who they are. As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I will work to oppose this hateful decision. These are not our values. https://t.co/t4e5xzZfC0
8 yrs ago, President Obama signed the #ACA, which I helped write. 		In New Hampshire:		63K gained insurance		7.5K are receiving opioid treatment through Medicaid		600K w/ a pre-existing condition have been guaranteed coverage 		21K seniors saved $24.1 M on Rx drugs in 2016 alone
Our Seacoast communities deserve to know how PFC contamination in groundwater supplies is impacting their health. I am pleased that I was able to secure funding for this first-of-a-kind health impact study in the government funding bill.
The Manchester VAMC needs significant infrastructure investments. I am pleased the government spending bill we just passed includes $2 B for VA infrastructure. The VA must now prioritize &amp; fund projects that improve the condition of our facility in Manchester.
The omnibus will provide badly needed resources for our state’s efforts to turn the tide in the deadly opioid crisis. The $142 M set-aside for the hardest-hit states will help NH. But we will still need the Trump admin to direct more resources to our state.
Thank you VP Biden for visiting the Congressional Blue Collar Caucus today! https://t.co/cK9C16s8gU

Withdrew from #ParisAgreement, ended #netneutrality, repealed #CleanPowerRule and @CFPB arbitration rule. 187 political appointees used to be lobbyists (35 worked for the Kochs!). Many oversee industries they used to lobby for. Who are they working for now? #Sunshineweek https://t.co/t2YUITbzfu
I am heartbroken by the passing of my good friend and colleague Louise Slaughter. Louise was brilliant and effective, outspoken and fearless. And fun! I was blessed to be her friend and colleague.
Congratulations to Phillips Exeter student Vinjai Vale, who just won 7th place in the #regeneronSTS 2018, a prestigious math and science competition for high school seniors. He competed with 40 finalists and over 1,800 applicants from across the country. Great job! https://t.co/gcKRSqW0UX
After rallying with young people who are calling for gun safety legislation, I spoke on the Floor to call for change. When 18-year-olds are leading the country with moral courage, it’s time for us to respond in kind. We must pass gun legislation now! #neveragain https://t.co/WuEjAAzMrs
During #sunshineweek, it’s clear conflicts of interest are everywhere in this White House. 5 Trump Org projects under scrutiny for ethics &amp; legal violations, and countless potential conflicts of interest!

This is a great day for Russia, whose embassy praised the decision to end the HPSCI investigation, &amp; a sad day for America. Ending it now confirms that it was a sham intended to shield Trump while brazenly disregarding our national security &amp; ignoring all intelligence experts.

I am so pleased that the Executive Council voted unanimously today to hang a portrait of Dudley in the Statehouse so that everyone who visits can learn about her distinguished career and her groundbreaking role in New Hampshire politics.

I co-introduced a resolution today to reverse the FCC’s shameful repeal of #NetNeutrality. It has the support of 50 Senators, just one shy of what is needed to pass the Senate. Speaker Ryan &amp; his Republican majority should put the resolution on the floor &amp; help us pass it.
Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, was a fierce advocate for children and families. She truly was “unbought and unbossed.” I am proud to cosponsor a bill to place a statue of her in the Capitol that honors her incredible contributions to our country.
Yesterday, I joined many of my colleagues in wearing red to support the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women campaign. #GoRedWearRed https://t.co/EpLksPoeu3
I voted no on #HR620, which would place the burden of complying with the #ADA on the victims of discrimination rather than the entities that are in violation of the law. It is disturbing that Speaker Ryan is using his majority to attack the rights of people with disabilities. https://t.co/P7J1Ej3Tx0
Children and families across the country rely on their leaders in Congress for much more than thoughts and prayers. They need us to take action to keep them safe. Speaker Ryan must put bills on the floor to address gun violence. https://t.co/Bx9rdp8Nme
And yet, they keep happening. Every single week. This cannot continue—we need common sense laws to reduce gun violence. It’s the least we can do for all of the victims and their grieving families, friends, and communities.
I am once again horrified and sickened by yet another massacre at an American school. This is at least the 18th school shooting this year. I am praying for the victims and their families. Parents and students should never have to endure such awful tragedies.
We need to know how many WH staffers are being allowed to view sensitive information without a permanent security clearance. Chief of Staff John Kelly needs to come clean about what he knew and when he knew it regarding Rob Porter. https://t.co/eItop78GXX
Tomorrow, the House will try to pass #HR620, which would undermine the civil rights of people with disabilities. This is the latest bill by Speaker Ryan that would hurt people with disabilities after he tried last year to take away their health care. I will vote no.

The FCC’s decision to repeal #NetNeutrality rules will destroy the way we access the internet. We have to protect consumers. I urge our state AG to reconsider his decision and to join us in the fight for a free and open internet.
Just this weekend, we learned that a special provision to benefit real estate investors such as Donald Trump was added in secret with almost no public debate or awareness. And now, struggling families across America will be saddled with the bill.
At every turn, experts have found that this rushed and secretive process has led to legislative text that is riddled with mistakes and loopholes that tax lawyers and accountants will easily game for their wealthy clients.
In just six weeks, Congressional Republicans wrote and passed a 500-page bill. They didn’t have a single hearing on a bill that touches almost every single person and business in this country.
This lopsided giveaway to the wealthiest individuals and corporations will explode the debt by $1.45 trillion, setting the stage for automatic cuts to Medicare and other critical programs that assist working families and secure our nation.
The GOP tax plan reduces the rate on the largest corporations by over one-third and lowers the top rate paid by millionaires.
With their reckless process and shameful tax plan, Congressional Republicans have bestowed an enormously expensive gift to corporate lobbyists, multi-millionaires, and the largest corporations. And they got the middle class to pay for it.
New Hampshire should be on the forefront of defending a free and open internet to maintain our economic competitiveness and protect Granite State consumers. Read my letter urging our Attorney General to take action. #netneutrality https://t.co/ts1SSzkQ9h

We can’t stand by as the FCC and big corporations steal our right to equal access.
Its openness has enabled a new generation of New Hampshire innovators to turn a bright idea and a laptop into a business.
Without the guarantee of net neutrality, the Internet superhighway’s rules of the road will favor big businesses over newer startups. The Internet has allowed the proud tradition of American ingenuity and entrepreneurship to reach every corner of the globe.
Net neutrality is the simple principle that lawful content on the Internet should be equally accessible to everyone, and that Internet service providers should not be allowed to discriminate against some content providers.
I strongly oppose the result of today’s shameful FCC vote, and I will work to restore the #NetNeutrality protections American consumers expect and deserve.

But even after five years of inaction, I still have faith that the American people will keep their voices raised until Congress is forced to listen and pass laws to stop this sequence of avoidable tragedies, and to spare American families from such unimaginable grief.
Year after year, they have banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other federal agencies from conducting research about gun violence as a public health threat.
Not only have House Republicans failed to act, they have made our laws even less safe. Just last week, they passed the NRA’s top priority, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017.
The failure of Republican Congressional leadership to act while 1,500 mass shootings have occurred on American soil since that awful December day is both immoral and inexcusable.
After Sandy Hook, parents and communities across the country advocated for safer gun laws, but five years later, the Congressional majority continues to ignore their call to action.
Five years ago, a gunman shot and killed 20 little children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School. I am still praying for the families of those sweet six- and seven-year olds, who should be happy sixth graders right now.
Sent a letter urging tax conferees to scrap their plan to tax grad students’ tuition waivers.

@SenBobCorker It will take us years to come back from just these 11 months. Investigations need to continue. But the road back needs to start now. That is why I am cosponsoring H.Res.621, ‘Articles impeaching Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors.’
@SenBobCorker During a time when our nation faces serious threats around the world, this nation desperately needs a President who will work to build and unite, not threaten, divide, and destroy. There is no good or easy solution to the grave situation our country finds itself in.
@SenBobCorker Donald Trump lacks integrity and has not been willing or able to assume the moral leadership and seriousness of purpose the United States needs from its President. At this point, it’s clear he never will.
Many Members of Congress, including myself, agree w/@SenBobCorker that President Trump poses a dangerous threat to national security and the future of our democracy. I believe it is past time to put country before party and bring these discussions out into the open.
As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, a former military spouse, and an advocate for our troops and their families, I have been appalled to see the Commander in Chief repeatedly make outrageous and irresponsible public statements that put our troops in more danger.
&amp; added my name as a cosponsor of stronger articles of impeachment, H.Res.621, which focus on Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice throughout the FBI’s investigation of his campaign ties to Russia &amp; his attacks on our Constitution, including the 1st Amendment &amp; Emoluments Clause.
I believe our nation needs to openly address the fact that Donald Trump’s bizarre and dishonest behavior in office is degrading the United States Presidency and making our world less safe. That is why today I voted ‘present’ on Congressman Green’s articles of impeachment ...
As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I am deeply concerned that this decision could provoke increased violence and instability in the region, and I believe it is a harmful setback to efforts to revive the peace process.
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive topics in these discussions, and it should be part of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Palestine, not dictated through unilateral action by the President of the United States.
President Trump’s plan to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem threatens American credibility in the region and undermines efforts to negotiate an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
Health insurance shouldn’t end at the neck, and neither should the VA’s standard medical benefits package. That’s why today I introduced a bill to offer dental care to all veterans. https://t.co/sVw6VSCIZm #nhpolitics
I will continue working to stop the Trump Administration from interfering with the Mueller special counsel probe’s independence, because the American people deserve the truth and nothing less. #nhpolitics
Now we know why President Trump pressed former FBI Director James Comey to drop his investigation of Flynn and then fired Comey when he refused: an attempted obstruction of justice.
Today’s admission of guilt by Flynn is a very serious development in the Mueller investigation. Flynn has admitted that he lied to the FBI while he was a top Trump Administration official about his contacts with Russia.
Former Trump Administration National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is now the fourth member of Trump’s slimy orbit to face serious charges, joining former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign officials Richard Gates and George Papadopoulos.
It’s past time for Congress to invest in fighting the raging opioid crisis on a scale that matches its severity, and this bill will spur a much-needed investment. #nhpolitics https://t.co/kbSgXXeFDL

The FCC chairman’s plan to repeal net neutrality will favor big tech businesses over startups and will give ISPs unprecedented control over what content consumers can access. ISPs shouldn’t be allowed to discriminate. That is not what consumers want.
