President Trump‚Äôs requests very clearly laid out the funding and resources we need to address the growing crisis at our Southern Border ‚Äì but the bill being sent to his desk falls short.

Operational roles played by Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr, and their financial gain from it, were known to at least 1/2 dozen senior FBI and DOJ officials prior to the first FISA application, but were never disclosed.
Before yesterday, we thought the FBI and DOJ had not disclosed material facts they were aware of in the FISA application. If Bruce Ohr testified truthfully, we now know that to be the case.
Looking forward to joining @seanhannity shortly to discuss my questioning with Bruce Ohr on his connection to the Steele dossier. @FoxNews

ICYMI: Here's my opening statement from today's @HouseHomeland cyber subcmte hearing on the state of the federal government‚Äôs cybersecurity risk profile. https://t.co/mQpj5SveBX
According to OMB &amp; DHS‚Äô report, we need to: 		1. increase cyber threat awareness		2. standardize IT &amp; cyber capabilities		3. consolidate security operations &amp; improve incident detection/response		4. increase accountability thru improved gov‚Äôt processes
This creates enterprise-wide gaps in network visibility, IT tool and capability standardization and common operating procedures, which is especially concerning when roughly 75% of gov‚Äôt agencies‚Äô cyber programs are either at risk or at high risk.
OMB &amp; DHS‚Äô ‚ÄúFederal Cybersecurity Risk Determination Report and Action Plan‚Äù revealed that a lack of threat info at federal agencies results in ineffective allocations of limited cyber resources.
.@HouseHomeland's cyber subcmte is concerned that the federal gov't isn't equipped to determine how threat actors seek to gain access to private info. 		I'm chairing a hearing at 10:30 a.m. ET to address this concern. Tune in here: 		https://t.co/T2G5VwtM4q

Susan Rice's "stand down" order in response to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election occurred almost simultaneously with the launch of the Trump campaign investigation.

But one week later, Obama admin officials told our own cyber chief to "stand down" and ignore Russian efforts to interfere with our election...	 	So was the Trump investigation really about our national security ‚Äì or was it politically motivated?
On July 31, 2016, the Obama admin initiated an aggressive investigation into the Trump campaign under the pretense that it centered on national security and fear that the Trump campaign may be colluding with the Russians to interfere with our election. https://t.co/stLhMJ0NDP
If your foundational evidence is so corrupted and tainted by how it's been collected, then everything that comes after that ‚Äì every search warrant that's obtained, every confession that's obtained, even every plea agreement that's entered into ‚Äì is likewise tainted or poisoned. https://t.co/JMdU2iTyvn
