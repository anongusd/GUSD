@DonaldJTrumpJr @nbc6 What is shocking is the fact the Democrats will stop at nothing to win. Democrats Corruption in Florida .
@DavMicRot @RAMRANTS No. I live in Florida. It's about allowing illegals and felons vote.	And writing in votes with a claim that originals were damaged but threw away the so called damaged. The ones written in were for Democrats.	This happens every time major candidates are being elected.
@TomiLahren Amen and yes we did. I for one was right giddy to be rid of them.
@JohnDennisWEEI @4VictoriaBC1 @AndrewGillum Yup. Snipes allowed illegals and felons vote. Democrats attorney said he came to win the election not to make sure votes were being counted right. Even in court their attorney and Nelson and Gillum argued all votes including illegals should be counted. The judge agreed with Scott
