I noted on @MSNBC the time when Trump said at Camp Humphreys that that base was for South Korea's security, not really America's security. His failure to coordinate w/South Korea on his pledge to stop joint military exercises further decouples the US from SKorea ally. Shocking

Jim, seriously? Did you hear Trump ask us trust his instincts? his feel for Kim Jong Un? Are you lining up to defend this arrangement?  It is not vacuous to expect detail.

Kim Jong Un got incredible reward in #SingaporeSummit and will buoy his position in eyes of North Korea's "haves." He gave up virtually nothing but an undefined commitment to denuclearize. Had Obama, Hillary, Bush, or anyone negotiated such a deal, GOP &amp; Dem ldrs would scream
RT @joshrogin: Trump on North Korea: ‚ÄúThey have given up a tremendous amount.‚Äù Fact check: False.
Trump: "Chairman Kim a very powerful man.  He has firm control of his country.  He has very powerful nuclear weapons.  It's my honor to deal with him." #NorthKoreaSummit
No verifiability provisions. No inspection provisions. Trump seems to have offered troop reductions and a freeze in military exercises. Details fuzzy -- but any US President other than Trump would be excoriated by both parties for such a weak, vague agreement #NorthKoreaSummit
What are long term @GOP hawks going to say about a #NorthKoreaSummit that is based entirely on @realDonaldTrump TRUST in Kim Jong Un.  Key point of #IranDeal was that it was negotiated skeptically, with worry about compliance. We are being asked to trust Trump's feelings.
