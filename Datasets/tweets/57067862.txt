@RadioFreeTom Governing in the U.S. is in essence done by coalitions.  Most of the most landmark legislation or policies (Cold War) are done with coalitions.  No coalition member is required to support every policy.  Likely to continue with a strong two party system.
@DesignGreek @JRubinBlogger @RadioFreeTom @TheBeatWithAri That is uncalled for.  It is so difficult for me to watch republicans or former one branded as RINOs.  What is accomplished?  I do not expect my family to agree 100 percent with me, so why expect it from those you share a party label with?
.@RadioFreeTom. Watched you on Morning Joe/read your piece in The Atlantic.  First, very sorry to see you go even though you speak poorly of those of us who choose to remain.  Second, correct, it is about winning.  Battleground is policy,  even though it is less discussed today.
