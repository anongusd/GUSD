In 2014 our businesses added nearly 3 million jobs, the best year since 1999 (when I still had hair). http://t.co/ljv9BhopCl

This is a pivotal moment for working people, our economy and the entire nation. I couldn't be more eager to get down to work!
I share Pres. Obama’s vision of a growing economy powered by a rising middle class, with ladders of opportunity available to everyone.
DOL plays a critical role in making sure people have the job skills needed to succeed &amp; that an honest day’s work leads to a decent living.
Thank you to former Sec. Hilda Solis &amp; Acting Sec. Seth Harris for their stewardship of and excellent work at @USDOL.
Excited &amp; honored to begin my 1st day as secretary of @USDOL. It’s a tremendous privilege to serve the American people in this new role.
