@SkipCarver1 @kipp_ya @GOPChairwoman @GOP He stated non viable and severe deformities. As an ICU nurse, I read that as something causing imminent death or severe deformities (anencephaly-brain stem is pretty much all there is=brain dead) or others. These are heartbreaking situations that nobody wants.

@10MinutesaDay4U @SenatorCollins Watching this process has been heart wrenching. Memories that we wanted to forget have been brought forth for all of us. I have felt the pain of a country full of survivors and it's been devastating that that pain has been so politicized.
