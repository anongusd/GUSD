There‚Äôs a lot of allegations in this 100+ page report, but a few recommendations include a compulsory code of ethics for social media &amp; an independent UK regulator for tech with actual power to punish companies with ‚Äòhefty fines'..
Beyond data privacy, the committee wants the antitrust regulator to look into Facebook, as they say Facebook uses its market dominance to crush rivals‚Ä¶.
They accuse Mark Zuckerberg of contempt for not showing up to their hearings‚Ä¶ and they say Facebook deliberately sent execs who weren‚Äôt fully briefed on the matters so they couldn‚Äôt answer properly...
The biggest takeaway: the committee claims Facebook has "intentionally and knowingly" violated both data privacy and competition laws. (Facebook denies this)‚Ä¶.

Keep in mind this entire lawsuit has had a political cloud over it because Trump said he wanted to stop the merger (&amp; his feelings toward CNN, owned by Time Warner). But political aspect was dropped before trial began - judge blocked AT&amp;T‚Äôs request for discovery on WH comms
Meanwhile DOJ had sued to stop AT&amp;T‚Äôs merger with Time Warner in *Nov* 2017. Pre-trial status conferences were going on by *December*

Also, DOJ Antitrust chief Makan Delrahim was here again. He shook Prof. Shapiro‚Äôs hand after Shapiro stepped down. Court resumes Thurs afternoon - we *might* hear from Shapiro again. Otherwise they will discuss logistics for closing arguments!
Shapiro pointed out that they were doing all this arguing over the low end of the range - and that he could‚Äôve focused on the high end but he was acting conservatively in his study.
The fight was over what data Shapiro used in his analysis. Petrocelli argued that certain numbers had been changed w/o Shapiro knowing, or that Shapiro didn‚Äôt use the most updated data which would significantly lessen the cost increase
Things got quite a bit more heated on cross. Shapiro noted Petrocelli had some ‚Äúnice flair‚Äù for how he was asking questions and the two were talking over each other - Judge had to intervene #USvsATT
Direct questioning of DOJ expert economist Prof Shapiro‚Äôs rebuttal testimony has wrapped. Pretty strong defenses against Prof Carlton (AT&amp;T‚Äôs expert) criticisms of his study which showed price increase if AT&amp;T/Time Warner merger goes through... but we‚Äôll see what cross brings...

Which serves as a knock against one of the government‚Äôs key arguments against this deal - that the merged company will use Time Warner content as leverage to extract higher prices from pay TV rivals and attract more customers to AT&amp;T services.
One part of those notes was a section on how AT&amp;T can use Time Warner content to their advantage without hurting Time Warner‚Äôs need to be widely distributed, because ‚Äúthe value of a content company is how many people watch the content - period.‚Äù
first 30 min or so of direct questioning Stephenson went through history of how the deal with Time Warner came to be, including details on hi thought process and first lunch meeting with Jeff Bewkes. Entered into evidence were Stephenson‚Äôs first hand written notes on the merger
Here we go - AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson just took the stand in the #USvsATT trial.
Randall Stephenson will be the next witness after Stankey wraps. He will likely be the AT&amp;T‚Äôs final witness in this trial - fittingly so as CEO.

Many reporters chattering outside feel this was a good day for DOJ - tomorrow we hear from AT&amp;Ts expert economist. Dueling economists! My husband would be proud.
We are done with our marathon day with government expert Shapiro. It was clear he‚Äôs done this before and was not rattled by Petrocelli trying to poke holes in his analysis - still some questions from Leon about it all - who noted it was ‚Äúnot intuitive‚Äù
Lots of metaphors today about crystal balls, binoculars, microscopes and telescopes to describe these attempts to predict the changes to the industry #USvsATT
Shapiro said his analysis is looking at long term changes to the industry - those long term contracts expire at some point though Petrocelli notes no one knows what world will look like then
On cross examination of Prof Shapiro - Petrocelli notes Shapiro analysis doesn‚Äôt account for longterm contracts still in place - just one of those contracts which goes on for years, when put into Shapiro analysis takes away vast majority of price increase Shapiro estimated
