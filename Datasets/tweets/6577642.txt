A few additional key takeaways for leaders from @NolaBeth: be authentic, articulate what you stand for and manage your message.
On the power of a tweet: “Instead of sending out a press release or doing 50 interviews ... your tweet becomes your statement on a certain matter. There’s a lot of power in that. Tweets have moved markets. We’ve seen single Tweets that have sent stocks up or down.”
According to @NolaBeth, leaders need to think forward: “I like leaders who are forward looking and forward thinking. Instead of focusing on what’s been or what’s happened, they are focused on the future. That is extraordinarily powerful.”
