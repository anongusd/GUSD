@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi If you don‚Äôt support human trafficking you should secure our southern border. 		It‚Äôs happening, right now. 		But agreeing with anything Trump wants to do is a problem for the Left. 		So Democrats obstruct, thereby enabling criminals, thugs and drugs to flow in.
@RepSwalwell Every debt I have agreed to take on I‚Äôve paid. 		You‚Äôre Socialist Democrats now. 		Why just stop at #StudentDebt? 		When are you guys going to include; credit card debt, auto loan and mortgage debt? 		Free, free, free..

@SenGillibrand If the problem is greater than your comprehension, of course you don‚Äôt understand. 		Parents didn‚Äôt drop their kids off for the bus, they gave them birth control. 		Incompetence is not securing the border for political reasons and allowing this to continue happening.
@RepSwalwell The ‚Äòdo-nothing‚Äô title belongs to those unwilling or unable to work with the other party. 		Socialist Democrats are the party of negativity and obstruction. 		Look at all the folks you‚Äôve burned just to be anti-Trump. 		Lame tweet Ric..
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi Nancy only fights for women and families if they‚Äôre non-citizens looking for a new country or Democrats. 		She apparently doesn‚Äôt see human trafficking as a problem or she‚Äôd work to fix the southern border. 		Drop the broad brush descriptions they don‚Äôt fit.
@SenJeffMerkley But when it happened under Obama, it was ok? 		Look in the mirror Jeff, get a good look at what a partisan politician willing to do anything including hurt the country he swore an oath to support. 		If you‚Äôd done your job and secured the border these folks wouldn‚Äôt be coming.
