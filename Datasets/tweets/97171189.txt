I discussed new legislation, a California-based abortion issue, the Zika virus, and more. @WTAW1620	https://t.co/0ENHyaXAsU
Because no one should be forced to violate their conscience or be threatened with losing their job for refusal to participate in an abortion
The bill also provides a private right of action so that individuals who face discrimination can seek legal relief through the courts.
...to participate in or provide coverage for abortions against their conscience.
This reaffirms the Weldon Amendment, which provides that a state may not punish or discriminate against a health care entity for refusing...
That's why we passed the Conscience Protection Act in the House today.
No one should be forced to violate their conscience or be threatened with losing their job for refusal to participate in an abortion.

Unfortunately, today‚Äôs ruling makes it harder for Texans to ensure they are receiving the best and safest medical care.
In the wake of the Gosnell case, many states reviewed and strengthened their standards for women‚Äôs health and emergency care.
There is a real need for these standards, as the horrifying conditions of Kermit Gosnell‚Äôs clinic and 2013 murder conviction demonstrated.
The Texas law ensured that every woman can receive care with safe, uniform standards and admitting privileges to local hospitals. #SCOTUS
I am shocked and disappointed by the #SCOTUS ruling today. https://t.co/SPy2dftHKw

Happy Birthday to the @USArmy! https://t.co/yHffCZIzBR
We are strengthened as we band together. #Orlando
These monsters must see the strength of a free people who stand shoulder to shoulder with clear eyes to face down their threat. #Orlando
Our leadership must address this threat head-on and not ignore the danger of this war &amp; the despicable cowardice that has come to our shores
ISIS will not get the results they want - we WON'T be torn apart - we WON'T back down in fear. #Orlando
As the horrifying events in #Orlando are confirmed as a terrorist attack, our hearts are grieving for the lives that were cut short.

These individuals paid the ultimate sacrifice for America‚Äôs security, freedom and prosperity. #veterans #MemorialDay
Since I was sworn into office in January 2011, we have lost 10 heroes during the Global War on Terror. #veterans #MemorialDay
The 17th Congressional District of Texas has a rich military history and is home to many #veterans. #TX17
While we pay tribute to the brave men and women who died for our freedom, we should also honor those defending our liberties today.
It is important that we take time to honor those who have given their lives in service to our nation.
This Memorial Day, let us remind all Americans to keep ‚ÄúMemorial‚Äù in Memorial Day.
It is important that we put the VA on a path to permanent success.
...and making sure that the mechanisms are in place to improve access to care and accountability.
The Department of Veterans Affairs should be committed to putting the care of our nation‚Äôs veterans first...
...we need to ensure their health care and benefits are in competent hands. #veterans
When that fight is won and our sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, friends and neighbors return home...
We must ensure that they are properly prepared.
Our troops serve as the world‚Äôs first lines of defense against expansions of tyranny and terrorist activity.
Our troops make many sacrifices to preserve our freedom. They are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for this country.
Additionally, it reforms the military justice system and focuses on improving readiness through the rebuilding of our nation‚Äôs military.
The House recently passed the #NDAA which provides for a strong national defense in a fiscally responsible manner.
...and the authority they need to fight and defeat the threats that exist in the world today.
We have an obligation to ensure that our men and women on the front lines have the resources...
They raised their gaze in the face of conflict, believed in what America could be &amp; pushed forward. We are compelled to follow their example
The one thing that they all have in common is their selfless love for our nation and their courage to stand up to protect and defend it.
America‚Äôs history is exemplified in the efforts of the men and women who died for our country.
They never stood down, and we must continue to stand up ‚Äî to protect freedom, liberty, self-determination, govt by consent &amp; free enterprise
And Gen. James ‚ÄúMad Dog‚Äù Mattis and our Marines laid siege to Fallujah.
Washington‚Äôs militia pressed on across the Delaware. The Greatest Generation stormed the beaches of Normandy.
...but with the contagion of his courage; and with a kind of desperate joy we go back to the fight.‚Äù
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that, ‚ÄúAt the grave of a hero we end, not with sorrow at the inevitable loss...
Going forward, we must continue the fight to change the direction of our country.
on a bipartisan basis to remember their valor and to pray for their families who have been left behind
On Memorial Day, we honor their sacrifice, we lower our flags to half-mast and we join together
and Marines have laid down their lives for their friends, their families and our nation.
From the depths of the Pacific to the deserts of Iraq, more than a million American soldiers, Airmen, midshipmen,
‚ÄúGreater love has no man than this, that he would lay down his life for his friends.‚Äù
These patriots‚Äô service and sacrifice to our nation remind me of the words of Jesus in John 15:13 ‚Äì
On #MemorialDay, we remember the service of the brave military men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice defending our freedoms.
