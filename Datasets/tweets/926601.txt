RT @ThePlumLineGS: Cohen is now claiming that Weisselberg directly witnessed firsthand Trump participating in the illegal hush money scheme.
Incredible to see all the hubris drained from Cohen. I've been personally screamed at by Cohen on the phone before and know how much bravado he once had. This is a man with nothing left, with no reason to lie or obfuscate at all. Humbling, in its way.
One big q for Cohen: Trump Tower Moscow and the hush money payments were presumably the *final* acts he did as "Trump's fixer." What *else* did he do in the decade before that first established him as "the fixer"? We've heard literally nothing from prosecutors about those acts.
In some ways, Cohen is telling the first coherent, believable version of the 2016 Trump campaign‚Äîa consistent set of lies and conspiracy.
Cohen is quite powerful speaking, even more so than his written words‚Äîand he comes across as broken and believable.

4) Which again is why Cohen's prepared remarks today should be carefully studied. They've been surely carefully vetted by counsel and lawyers (maybe even prosecutors) all with a vested interest in ensuring that Cohen remains credible witness for future trial(s). /END
3) And that's precisely what Mueller and SDNY did with Cohen; you can rest assured that when they've allowed Cohen to claim something or say something, they have corroboration‚Äîother testimony, documents, etc.‚Äîto back it up.
2) Prosecutors are used to witnesses with credibility problems. One challenge: Most people involved in crime are criminals, so easy to doubt their veracity. That's why prosecutors rely on corroborating testimony and evidence to back up claims....

5) Trump's incoming attorney general already said this behavior is a crime, two days before it became public. https://t.co/im1pUD4qtw
4) The president's family is potentially in lots of legal trouble. Ivanka and Don Jr.'s fingerprints are all cover Cohen's deals. And there's no way a $300 million project in Moscow is proceeding without them. https://t.co/im1pUD4qtw
3) Any obstruction case would be much bigger than Comey. Don't get caught up in the legalese of the president's Article II powers. Any obstruction case would be a pattern, beginning during the campaign, through the transition, and into the White House. https://t.co/im1pUD4qtw

5) What has Felix Sater told Mueller? The man known as ‚ÄúIndividual 2‚Äù in the Cohen agreement, real estate developer and peripheral Trump figure Felix Sater, possesses perhaps the most intriguing background of anyone wrapped up in the scandal. https://t.co/ieMKSLv3NS
4) How did Trump himself, and the Trump family, react to Cohen‚Äôs updates on various schemes? Cohen's plea agreements are notably silent on what was said in key conversations. https://t.co/ieMKSLv3NS

8) Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just a challenge for government or a business problem‚Äîit‚Äôs a challenge for our whole society. We need to rethink our embrace of the internet and how both our geopolitical strategy and our corporate strategies should adapt. READ MORE: https://t.co/TcETbs8kTr
7) This book tells the story of how the U.S. began to impose costs using every tool the government had, from handcuffs to international sanctions. The story, though, is far from over‚Äîand, in many ways, it‚Äôs actually still getting worse. https://t.co/TcETbs8kTr
The number of FBI, Secret Service, and HSI squads who tackle complex cyber cases remains tiny‚Äîand consistent over years. Pittsburgh and Atlanta for the FBI, Nevada for HSI. We need a *lot* more good guys online.
6) The government's efforts‚Äîas best intentioned as they are‚Äîremain orders of magnitude short of the need. I remain shocked reporting on national security how small the circles are....
It's an inherently insecure medium, designed among friends who never imagined it would underpin global commerce. Looking over 35 years of history, it's amazing how many vulnerabilities remain, how many of familiar attacks still work, how many old hacking tools remain useful.
5) In reexamining the history of the internet, today‚Äôs mess of a world is utterly predictable. The flaws of the internet and today‚Äôs digital world were present at the creation‚Äîthe internet is the fundamental problem....
4) We, amazingly, still have no real guess of the scale of cyberattacks. In the GameOver Zeus case, the FBI stopped counting at $100 million in thefts. We have no idea how much that *one* gang stole, let alone the "tax" we all pay for data breaches, cyber thefts, &amp; online fraud.
Iran first attacked the financial sector; North Korea attacked our free speech; Russia attacked the rituals of our democracy, China stole our federal personnel records. What have we not imagined that will come next?
3) We have done a terrible job imagining where our cyber vulnerabilities are. All four of the first significant nation-state attacks against the US targeted "critical infrastructure" we'd never considered:
2) There is no meaningful line between Russian state-sponsored cyber attacks and criminal attacks. No country is more of a rogue state online than Vladimir Putin's Russia. Many of the biggest cases involve criminals working under the protection of Russian intelligence.
1) The scale of China's pillaging of US intellectual property is vastly larger than most people realize and has contributed significantly to its rapid growth. In a book excerpt in @WIRED, I examine one such case: https://t.co/toLrMWlVQf

Which leaves us with this interesting question: When is the US government's other shoe going to drop on Cozy Bear‚Äîand why hasn't it already? Why is there no FSB involved in Mueller's probe and charges yet‚Äîis that a puzzle piece still to come???
And we know that the Dutch intelligence agencies (a big part of today's indictment too!) have been all over the FSB's Cozy Bear too: https://t.co/m2q5nTDMqA and Dutch today: https://t.co/QAjfjmjZP9 ....
See this WP piece by @nakashimae from last year, which says the Washington Field Office is looking at Cozy Bear ...: https://t.co/FKkNc8HGih
3) The ongoing targeting of the GRU by the US government and the FBI is semi-puzzling because we know the FBI and other intel agencies also have a lot of information on the FSB team known as Cozy Bear. ...
but we haven't seen many Pittsburgh fingerprints on the case so far. Is this a hint that Pittsburgh was watching the GRU while the 2016 election unfolded? That could be *really* interesting.
Reuters and others reported early on that the FBI Pittsburgh probe was involved in the Russia probe. https://t.co/Y0YHuQaBst ....
The Westinghouse hack‚Äîwhich is what gives Pittsburgh jurisdiction to put together the rest of the case‚Äîdates back to 2014 and 2015, which seems to indicate that the FBI has been watching this group for a while‚Äîwhich hints at an unanswered questions of the Mueller probe....
2) While most people are focusing on the GRU's anti-doping hacks, the hack of Westinghouse Electric's nuclear power efforts is intriguing too. ...
1) The case came out of the Western District of PA, aka, the FBI's crack cyber team in Pittsburgh, home also to the big PLA indictment in 2014. https://t.co/9JB0AN6yXt

There are still very significant parts of the Mueller investigation where we've seen no public movement, including Roger Stone, George Nader, Qatar, and meetings in the Seychelles. ....
And it still seems like Mueller is only getting started. So where does Mueller go next? I laid out some of the outstanding questions: https://t.co/6PZv5TlsNE
These are *just* the people who have pleaded guilty and been found guilty at trial. None of this counts the other people/groups that have been CHARGED by Mueller, like the Internet Research and the Russian military intelligence service GRU.  ...
That's an incredible tally for a federal investigation. ....
6) Another Gates protege, Samuel Patten, has also pleaded guilty to being an unregistered foreign agent, helping to funnel illegal foreign money to Trump's inaugural campaign. ...
5) Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and stonewalling its investigation into his contacts with Russian nationals during the campaign. ...
4) Trump campaign aide and Trump's deputy inaugural chairman, Rick Gates, has ALSO pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States. ...
3) Trump's national security advisor, Michael Flynn, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, charges that include how he was working as an unregistered foreign agent for the Turkish government during the campaign. ...
2) Trump's campaign lawyer and deputy RNC finance chair, Michael Cohen, has pleaded guilty to EIGHT charges, including campaign finance charges, tax fraud, and bank fraud. ...
1) Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has both been found guilty at trial and pleaded guilty to charges that include money laundering, conspiracy against the United States, and that he was working as an unregistered foreign agent for pro-Putin Ukrainians. ...
Together, they paint a picture of the "America First" campaign being anything but, of a campaign staffed with liars, crooks, and grifters ...
