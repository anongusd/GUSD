Why does the messaging at CPAC matter? It's often where themes/ideas bubble up before entering the GOP mainstream.
The China focus at CPAC was echoed by Lindsey Graham, who said at one point in his remarks: “How many of you are worried about Chinese students and professors coming to America to basically steal our stuff? Because I’m [Judiciary] chairman, we’re going to take that up.”
Smart piece by @SchreckReports on how China has become the new boogeyman at CPAC: https://t.co/NTafW1Pnvu Among the juicy tidbits: Organizers considered, then passed over, Terry Branstad as a speaker bc he was deemed "too soft on China"
Graham quips that he and Trump have resolved their differences after a bumpy beginning: “We’ve got a lot in common now. I like him, and he likes him.”
At CPAC, Lindsey Graham says of Kim Jong Un: "If he doesn’t get a deal with Trump, he won’t be anywhere much longer.”

‘Not good, not nice’: At Florida rally, Trump says China has ‘targeted our farmers’ https://t.co/GZQ9u6xFUm with @AshleyRParker
A nod to the back-and-forth over whether he stayed overnight in Moscow in 2013? Trump in FL tonight: "I was probably in Washington in my entire life 17 times. It’s true, 17 times. I don’t think I ever stayed overnight. You know what I’m getting at, right?"
"I know the wonderful people and I know the scum," Trump says of his experience in Washington so far. Sadly, nothing further on who made the scum list.
"My only special interest is you, the citizens of the United States," Trump says, in a message that would also double as a great Valentine's card
"Remember the attack on Merry Christmas?" Trump says, in July. "They’re not attacking it anymore."
“We may have to do some pretty drastic things, but we’re gonna get it,” Trump says on border wall funding, hours after he renewed his threat to force a government shutdown over it.
Trump riffs on being "presidential," in what sounds (at least to this reporter's ear) like an impression of Barack Obama. "And I will leave now because I am boring you to death," he concludes.
“Polls are fake, just like everything else," Trump tells the crowd, before going on to tout a poll showing "the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party is Trump. Can you believe it?”
"China and others have targeted our farmers. Not good. Not nice. And you know what our farmers are saying? It’s okay. We can take it," Trump says.
"Our first lady is home watching," Trump says at Tampa rally. (Not if she's watching CNN, which is not airing the rally live.)
