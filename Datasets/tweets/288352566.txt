@ForestServiceNW Absolutely. You're right it's also a fantastic tool. And increased visitation is also a positive thing. The great outdoors changes peoples lives for the better. On the flip side, it's all about reducing impacts of humans. Not a simple topic for a tweet :)

@pctnumbers2017 Hope is also accessed via BC Transit https://t.co/5v1Nw01ntK
@pctnumbers2017 Option 4: walk the long way to Hope via the Heather and HBC Brigade Trails through the Cascade Recreation Area. Maybe.
@john_osborn So, we mapped it out, but it's not something we're likely to publish. Maybe. Basically, make your way to The Great Trail and take that to Vancouver. Easy to connect to TGT.
@pctnumbers2017 Option 3: you could also walk to hope pretty easily via Silver Skagit Road, which looks pretty nice.
@pctnumbers2017 Option 2: ~85 mile walk through Skagit Valley and Chilliwack Lake Provincial Parks, half on The Great Trail to bus in Chilliwack (or continue on foot to Vancouver via TGT.)
@john_osborn Sounds pretty cool! Map it out!

@CoachNOTE Probably the Cougar Crest Trail or Polique Canyon.
@CoachNOTE Fawnskin.
@MattVas Adding trail town information has been on the to-do list since we removed it around 2011. It's likely!
@MattVas Not quite understanding your first tweet, but your second tweet (hikers following the path of those before them) is probably what's going on. Plus, there is often sound logic behind the popular towns. I'd love to do a hike that visits these "lost" locations.
@MattVas Want to write a story on it?
@wheres_laura It's probably a huge list. Fawnskin and Crestline are two that are near each other.
It's really interesting how PCT hikers bypass so many towns and services that could be reasonably used but aren't.

@LFilliger Absolutely true. Everyone is responsible for their own safety.
@LFilliger Yeah, sure. Risk is absolutely a part of wilderness travel. But so it understanding and mitigating it, right?
I believe that long-distance backpackers should all have taken a high level of wilderness first aid. But it's not on PCTA to provide that.
Actually, how about communicating the risks in general? Too many heat related, medical related, and other incidents as well. #pct2017
How can we better communicate the danger that the snow pack presents? There are far too many near-misses involving #PCT hikers.
