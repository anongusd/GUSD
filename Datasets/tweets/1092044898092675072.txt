‚ÄúAmerica was founded on liberty and independence‚Äînot government coercion, domination, and control.¬†We are born free, and we will stay free.‚Äù -@realDonaldTrump #SOTU19
@Lesperado1 The economy had already hit bottom and would have recovered without his piss poor welfare initiatives.  Also, the recession was created (with bipartisan support, ü§Æ) in the Clinton admin.
This actually gives me the lol‚Äôs.  #snowflake #weownthelibs https://t.co/jibNERO0ti
Damn you @realDonaldTrump for creating a business friendly atmosphere and fostering good regulatory policy!  #obamadidntbuildthat #weownthelibs https://t.co/oXiGBj3F6x
@ericswalwell LIBERAL NEWS ALERT!!!! Trump goes outside to get some fresh air.  THE LIES, THE HORROR.  What a joke.  #weownthelibs
@RepTedLieu @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Maybe you don‚Äôt Congress very well, but did you üëÄ the prescription drug work #trump is doing?
@Lesperado1 üòâüòâ right, I‚Äôm sure you do üòâüòâ #nottodaycommie.
@Lesperado1 A smart person would look at the end of the Obama market to compare it to the start of Trumps.  I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt read the article but it shows the stagnate market at the end of the Obama administration and then how it‚Äôs taken off since Trump got there. LOGIC!! Use it.
@Lesperado1 So are we and adding to NATO coffers.  Not good for Putin.  #ThanksTrump
@Lesperado1 I repeat facts, where ever they are from.  I‚Äôm not beholden to Rachel Maddow like you.
@Lesperado1 Tell me the stocks are bad.  Prove it.  Please, prove that the market is worse under Trump.
@Lesperado1 You must be the political elite making tons of $$$.  That‚Äôs sick that you‚Äôre just now paying your fair share.
@Lesperado1 Do you just make this shit up?  99% of ISIS is destroyed, tax revenue went ‚¨ÜÔ∏è up AFTER the tax cuts were passed. NKorea hasn‚Äôt launched any missles (Iran has) gender pay gap is a myth, more American families are making over 100k a year than those who make 50k a year.
@Lesperado1 It‚Äôs fairly even over the last 6 months, and still up 30% since the election.  üò≥üá∫üá∏ü§Ø my 401k is lookin good.  üòé
@Lesperado1 And the DOW is currently up 150.  But hey, who needs facts? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@Lesperado1 Lowest ever black unemployment rate‚úÖ		Lowest ever Hispanic unemployment‚úÖ		Lowest women unemployment in 60 yrs		The Korean War is over ‚úÖ		Economy is best it has ever been‚úÖ		Taxes at 60 year low ‚úÖ		ISIS obliterated ‚úÖ		US energy independent ‚úÖ
@EdKrassen I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll delete this next year.  Haha.
@Lesperado1 But the Clinton investigation showed clear bias and collusion with investigators.  That‚Äôs not happening with Trump.  It‚Äôs sad, but justice isn‚Äôt blind.  Political elites are not treated equally under the law.
@Lesperado1 The only Russian connection that has been proven is between the Hillary campaign and  the Russians.  #factsmatter
@CNN Now do OBAMA!
@EdKrassen Jobs, booming economy, more liberty.  If that‚Äôs not giving a crap, he needs to give way less of a crap.  #winning #weownthelibs

@AOC Are you looking at stealing someone‚Äôs lifetime of work?  That‚Äôs disgusting.
@Lesperado1 That‚Äôs true.  She does hate this county.
@Lesperado1 Because he‚Äôs corrupt justice department wouldn‚Äôt investigate him.  Did he know Hillary has a secret email server that was hacked by foreign actors.
@Lesperado1 That‚Äôs discrimitory.  Texas is the second largest state economy in the US.  Maybe the poor blue states need to learn something besides common core.
@Lesperado1 An American President colliding with the Russians to thwart the American citizen.  SAD!!! https://t.co/ed0WquTSBe
@Lesperado1 More facts!   Agh!  I know it must be frustrating to you.  Good day.  Obviously you are not willing to learn.  You have too much hate in your heart.  That‚Äôs not healthy.   https://t.co/lyYG7spiS5
@Lesperado1 I believe the states should decided the educational future of our kids.  No Washington.  Why is that a bad thing.  The federal government has no authority over that.
@Lesperado1 https://t.co/7ycDxZMFHD
@Lesperado1 Your really pushy in saying I don‚Äôt know what policies are.  You tell me.  How did deregulating that industry hurt the country?  I‚Äôll wait
@Lesperado1 The department of education should be abolished and I don‚Äôt have time to debunk the rest of the opinion piece from a liberal mouth piece.
@Lesperado1 Cool story bro, tell me again after ‚Äònet neutrality‚Äô was repealed how internet speeds were slowed?
@Lesperado1 There‚Äôs a difference between oversight and over regulations.  Over regulations = slavery
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è are you dumb or incompetent.  I don‚Äôt know which one.
@Lesperado1 Right, the freedom from regulatory burdens and government.

@Lesperado1 Unemployment at a historic low, stock market at a historic high, manufacturing jobs, blue collar jobs, lower taxes, less regulation.  This is a great economy. #Trump2020
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton Hillary paid a law firm (Perkins Coie) who paid a ‚Äúresearch firm‚Äù (Fusion GPS) who paid paid a foreign intellegence Officer (Michael Steele) who paid some Russian intel officers for a unverified and salacious dossier. Those are facts, proven conspiracy to thwart American election
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen Is @HillaryClinton going to pay more Russians to thwart our election? #weownthelibs
@EdKrassen You have obviously never read a history book.  No they wouldn‚Äôt.  The Congress is responsible for ‚Äòtrying‚Äô the President through impeachment.  You‚Äôre a joke.  #weownthelibs

@elchsa @EdKrassen America has an aboindance of healthcare.  Our system worked great (before Obama Care) and no waitlist! I ‚ù§Ô∏è the free market. #weownthelibs
@moravian63 @EdKrassen 1. It doesn‚Äôt work.  2. If you need surgery, you go on a wait list (good luck) 3. Medications are controlled by the government, meaning if there is a better medicine that the government hasn‚Äôt negotiated for you don‚Äôt get it. 4. It doesn‚Äôt work #weownthelibs
Look!  More dumb libs lying to Twitter.  What else would you expect.  #weownthelibs https://t.co/LlDPFRTkTz
@EdKrassen Fact is, it doesn‚Äôt work.  It‚Äôs expensive, lacks patient focused healthcare and prolongs wait times for the simplest treatments.  Medicare for all would be like going to the DMV for a cold.  How many Canadian companies hold patents in healthcare?  #thanksamerica #weownthelibs
@immrhodes123 @EdKrassen Because he paid for it.  It‚Äôs the best PRIVATE hernia center in North America.  Did I mention it‚Äôs not ran by the Canadian Health Care system.
