Why, did he pitch a fit on the sideline after that INT? @denverbroncos Anyone else think Brandstater's got a little Cutler in him?
3 takeaways for the Broncos D tonight... I love it.  I might be sick but my senses are being assaulted by... optimism.
@mariasaidwhat Rachel Yamagata.  I approve.

@Cougar15 You're not serious, are you?  Anything better than 3-13 this year will be a miracle.  Hope for the best, but... yikes.
@Cougar15 Nope.  Listening on Sirius.
@scrubbybubbles Only on paper.  The INT was thrown left handed from the SEA 1 yard line and turned into 7 points for the bad guys.
@jemelehill It isn't Orton's fault.  He's Kyle Orton.  He can't help it.  Believe me... Broncos fans put this on McDaniels.
Orton's Jake Plummer impersonation turns into 7 points for the Seahawks. I want to be optimistic. I swear I do. But he's not making it easy.
Dear Pat Bowlen, Please fire Josh McDaniels at half-time.  Sincerely, Humanity.

@pinkelephantpun Lansing tea party had between 250 and 500, depending on who you asked to estimate... HUGE energy.  Four or five TV stations
HUGE energy at the Lansing Tea Party... with a few pictures -- http://tinyurl.com/cwrb28 #TCOT #sgp
@melanieann79 @wendyjday @apackof2 Lansing Tea Party was OFF THE CHAIN! Not an expert estimater but I'd say 350-500 people with flags, signs
@chadmiles They're more likely to promote her.
@chadmiles She's not joking... she's taking the council of the racist group that gives out the "Sambo" awards.  Disgusting.
Getting ready for the Chicago Tea Party: Lansing, MI Style at high noon!  If you're in the area, swing by and say hello!
Mike Murphy:  we should put right to work on the ballot here in Michigan. 		GOPers clap, Dems groan.
Harold Ford, Jr (Dem):  Raising taxes at the state level handicaps businesses and makes it harder for them to grow and succeed.
Mike Murphy: "Republicans in Congress are like eunichs at a wild party in the playboy mansion."
SoS Terri Lynn Land giving remarks. Harold Ford, Jr and MI native Mike Murphy debating during main event.
WOOD radio morning show host Rick Beckett passed away last night. Very sad. The man was the voice of my HS mornings on WGRD.

Just met @irishduke. Twitter buddies coming together in real life. Awww.
Weiser: republicans will win Michigan not at the state capitol but home by home on our own blocks!
Weiser: 6,000 elected republicans in MI. 70 percent of total!
New MRP Chairman Ron Weiser addressing the convention. Focusing on the importance of unity, core principles and "person to person" convo.
Weather is coming in fast. MRP convention taking parliamentary steps to save an hour or two. All candidates to be nominated at once.
@aaronpj Alan Keyes was the first Presidential candidate I ever cast a vote for.  He'd get it again in that scenario.
We have our first casualty.  Too many hours on my feet and my right shoe has officially and legitimately fallen to pieces.  Tennies tomorrow
Gubernatorial candidate Tom George with vols dressed as police, construction, nurses etc. One kid has an inflatable pink hammer. :/
McManus now has the mic. Ton of energy.
Each SoS candidate thus far slamming ACORN. Glad they recognize the danger to ballot integrity from crooks and liars.
Cameron Brown at caucus with about a million and three teenagers volunteering. Easily the biggest vol army thus far.
Judy Emmons announcing her candidacy for SoS. Will have to grab her for a RightMichigan interview ASAP!
Anne Norlander talking about bad acts by ACORN during 08 elections.
Now focusing on importance of 19th special election. "Nationally watched race."
Bishop: "john stryker does not represent our michigan values!". Big applause. Guess no one cares about "the preservation of the great ape."
Mike Bishop asks if folks are sick of big government. "Sick and tired of being blown away."
Terri Lynn Land talking about her record and importance of being a fiscal conservative. Has cut employees by 20 percent while upping service
Judge Bill Schuette prepping to speak at 3rd Dist. Has advantage of being only candidate of either party in race who isn't a Lansing insider
Man just walked into Caucus. Dead ringer for Jim Rome.
Cong Hoekstra to 3rd Dist Caucus: "you think we spent too much under Bush?  You're right. But what the Dems are doing makes us look Dutch!"
Sen Jansen addressing 3rd District caucus re: 19th Senate special election. Expects Dems / Stryker to spend millions to beat Mike Nofs.
Enthusiasm at this place is off the hook. No hyperbole. Don't remember a Feb off-year convention with this much life.
Just spoke with Torrian Bridges... Told RightMichigan.com exclusively that he's running for Wayne State Board of Governors again!
Michelle McManus, Cameron Brown and Pete Hoekstra also working the rooms. @sanuzis multi-tasking like a pro.... Staff has been great!
