@RepAlexanderOC @CNN You claim to be pro 1st amendment?
@RepAlexanderOC @mdewest1977 A maga hat is not a swastika
@RAislinnRodgers @SandraDawn4 Well he isn't a public figure. He didn't mean to go viral
@aspexit America is a place for justice not collateral damage
@aspexit Ya ik and Nick got persecuted for no reason. He deserves big time compensation
@RepAlexanderOC Do you not see a problem with calling people Nazis without any proof?? I guarantee you in not anything you listed above. I'm not even that conservative
@SandraDawn4 Obama was the president and Nick is a high schooler. Big difference. With that logic Trump would be able to sue nbc and cnn
@SandraDawn4 Well Nick sandmann is a private citizen and Obama isn't. It requires malice to sue for libel if you are a public person
@RepAlexanderOC Can you give me the definition of a Nazi cause I definitely am not one
@RepAlexanderOC When your argument is an ad hominem you lose credibility immediately
@RepAlexanderOC I mean 1) I'm not a bigot and it's morally wrong to call someone that off of no information. And 2) the press does not have the right to lie about private citizens which ends up ruining their lives.
@RepAlexanderOC Uhhh nooooo it's not. The media sought to destroy his life by publishing fake news about him. The media spread false info about him for days after the full truth came out. Libel is not protected by the 1st amendment so goodluck.
@aspexit That's true social media is hard to sue, However the media did lie and defame these kids for days
@aspexit I mean it kinda does. They ruined the kids life
