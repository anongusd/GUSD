Participating in what basically amounts to a media blackout and misdirection is aking to willfully engaging in a cover-up. If something like that was found to eminate from the top of these media structures and foreign hackers have evidence of that. Then this is going to get dark.
Clearly horrible, it's just we've seen it before, no-one is shocked R-Kelly did this. But what about the MSM? Did someone direct western media to cover this to distract from #palmbeach, and if so.

"These are all vitally important functions in a US military with a chronic deficit of good intelligence -but also the sort of abilities activist at places like the @ACLU argue could destroy civil liberties". Which it has.
That could mean crunching aerial footage of highway traffic to find candidates for smugglers trucks or watching financial records to identify likely payoffs and terrorist money laundering operations, or watching communications metadata to find enemy hideouts through associations.

Shit that happened; in Jan 2017. Developers formed a picket line protesting outside Palantirs HQ demanding Thiel's company abstain from supporting Trumps agenda of forming a "Muslim registry" and aid Trumps deportation agenda. Trump would also sell the technology far and wide.

I have no doubt some of these people/organizations initially hoped to help me. But if these predominantly are intel operatives then it would seem they have been replaced with operatives from opposing fractions or just political operatives aligned with Trump, looking for my Intel.
They are just using this platform to blend in with my friends and family to cover up their initial crimes, experimental research and hide their activity. I am not in charge of my life and this group has utterly isolated me, most likely hoping I would do harm to myself or others.

There's no legal basis for their activities and they do not represent me or any of my work in any legally construed fashion. I am a victim of this and demand that it gets tested in open court. They continually seek to distort my various statements and punish me if I contest them.
These people have engaged multiple of my friends and family members, and I have been made aware that some of them do actively pretend to help me, or act as if they have my permission to target me. But I urge you to make them prove that with me present. They will no doubt refuse.

That being said; it should be noted both sides of the political spectrum have sacrificed portions of free speech to silence critics in the West. Ignoring that censorship is the tool most used by bigots offering them the platforms and secrecy to spew their hatred unopposed.
Plus: black cube tracking Obama staff, Joel Zamael's dealing in the Seychelles. Covering up classified info the Russians were handed in the oval office. Stripping arab Israelis of their rights, lying to the UN. Also his son's drunken antics leading to a criminal corruption probe.
It's a bad case of yelling wolf. Bibi precipitated all of this, saving the treasonus oligarchs responsible for the rise of Trump and white nationalism in Europe.

"He lent us his house once. And I was there, my grandchildren were there, my daughter was there, and we all got massages," Dershowitz told the site. "It was therapeutic. I had a therapeutic massage with an old old Russian. . . "
Accusers councel: "Alan Dershowitz's absurd attacks on me are consistent with his pattern of attacking every lawyer who has represented women who have accused him of sexual abuse," Boies said."
Dersh - "slammed her as mentally unstable and said she'd bizarrely claimed to be in possession of a video of President Trump engaging in pedophilia and sex tapes of both Bill and Hillary Clinton."
2/2 "he'd orchestrated an international sex trafficking operation, the Herald reported."		Epstein, a hedge fund manager with a mansion on the Upper East Side and a private Caribbean island, was once friends with the likes of Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Woody Allen among other.
1\2 The Herald's investigation highlighted the unusually	cozy relationship between Epstein's legal team and Acosta, who gave the sex offender a generous plea deal. Epstein only served 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail despite ample evidence ....
"Roberts alleged that Maxwell recruited her for Epstein in 1998, when she was 15 years old and working a summer job at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort."
Ehm...		"Ransome alleges in her suit that even as Epstein used an army of powerful attorneys — including Dershowitz — to fight a sex trafficking investigation in Florida, he continued "transporting young females" in New York."	https://t.co/RiJ8zd8RmW

Oh and here's the kicker:	https://t.co/wdvPMRKB8c
2/3 FB believes that unlike previous leaks and breaches focused on demographic information, this leak was driven in part by the company’s need to harvest imagery from Facebook to build facial recognition models that could be used by the Russian government for surveillance.
1/2"this time admitting that a Russian company that counts the Russian government among its customers had bulk downloaded so much data from the platform that its marketing materials claimed it essentially had a mirror of the Russian portion of Facebook."	https://t.co/r0E93ShUhk
By default, Facebook users in the U.S. will be signed up for these face recognition alerts, unless they have previously opted out of a similar, more limited feature. But users can turn off face recognition, Facebook says.	https://t.co/SfHOVAAzcI
Surveillance: Malware infections or aggressive tracking mechanisms could turn devices with facial recognition tech in them into de facto “telescreens,” the always-on surveillance systems from the novel “1984.”	https://t.co/zMQpPacitc
"the social media platform is trialling facial recognition technology which asks users to look into their device's camera so it can work out whether to grant access by comparing your face to pictures and videos you've been tagged in."	https://t.co/QdmqfKNx4U
“We decided, in consultation with privacy advocates and people, that the best approach for this offering was to notify people on Facebook and provide a way to adjust it in their account settings at any time.”	https://t.co/ATflBLenL3
Facial recognition software has proved problematic for Facebook. In 2011, its commitment to privacy was questioned when it turned on facial recognition software to automatically identify people in photos.https://t.co/GLtcxw29Xb
2016: It works by comparing photographs to profile pictures on Vkontakte, a social network popular in Russia and the former Soviet Union, with more than 200 million accounts.	https://t.co/v45sYPqvxt
