AND AGAIN!!! WHY
@ummkelly absolutely yes and also i remembered the phrasing was "BE INTERESTED in why you feel the need to ask that question" which means I was not "intentional with my word" which would disappoint her
@PatrickSimmons1 yes!
@sonicdork I play on branson's and am honestly very good!!!!!
@mcbyrne I mean, I'm speaking about my experience as a freaking acting student at a private university. it is very good for a professor to discern what is a real question and what is an exercise in ego that is wasting everyone's time and I wish every professor had done that with my peers!
@mcbyrne of course some folks learn by asking questions! this is clearly not about that. this refers to ppl who don't have actual questions, and who speak simply to circumvent intellectual rigor/self-examination or hear themselves talk. it's an elitist impulse &amp; quieting it is noble, imo

a few years ago a woman wrote a web series about herself &amp; asked Branson to play himself &amp; she gave them SEVEN sex scenes!!!! had he said yes, it would've been a real A STAR IS BORN vibe except the web series would have had 60 views &amp; I don't have the benefit of being a model

@benkling thank god we can both agree.... whatever!!!! hope this dude enjoys his twitter-free divorced life
@benkling this is all to say that one doesn't need to say "as a woman" to speak to being a woman, and it sounds like this person commiserated with/ comforted women about subjects they wouldn't have shared with a man. so... idk i am very tired and having opinions about this for some reason
@benkling ... if women were reading him through the lens of believing the author was a woman, "jokes" (?) about the experience of walking down the street, having conversations or being corrected, confidence, self-image, etc could be interpreted as speaking to an experience of being a woman
@benkling definitely pivoting from that screenshot which I'm too tired for, and this is sort of a broader conversation bc I did not know this account's content at all, but one thing I'll say is I think that it's fair to say that YOU didn't see their content as "identity-focused" but...
@benkling I saw some people upset that it was on those ‚Äúfunniest women on twitter this week‚Äù lists, which I took to be about willful, knowing impersonation not (as he had suggested) an accident he hadn‚Äôt fully understood? but, and I really can‚Äôt stress this enough, whatever!!!!
@kristencheeks Tetris 99 has also been a major part of my hiatus!!!!!!
@benkling idk I just became aware of the account today but I don‚Äôt find people‚Äôs reactions to be unusual or misguided
@benkling I don‚Äôt really see anyone who‚Äôs pissed the account did well or thought the content was ‚Äúfemale‚Äù?? I‚Äôm seeing women who had a personal relationship with that person who are feeling betrayed/angry, which I think is fair, or ppl who think his explanation is fucked up, which it is
@1followernodad think the dude should rot but at the same time....... the reveal at the end that his beautiful wife who knew he had this account and absolutely was cool with it is also divorcing him? good stuff
@1followernodad saying he loved posing as a woman because "honestly who would want to be a man on the internet" made blood come out of my eyes

@jourdayen this is a vile response, I am so sorry
@_brittanyv thank you but let's be clear: I also want to die!!!!!!
@_brittanyv there's such a long time until the primaries &amp; it's all a bad horse race. I don't think any candidate's reputation or popularity can withstand a straight year of play-by-play analysis, so it's probably for the best that everyone's cycling in and out of the convo consistently
I had such a fun morning with Alanna talking about how Meredith has changed and matured since we met her!!! More info coming very very soon but the pod is premiering in THREE WEEKS so get your damn self ready!!!!! https://t.co/RZXxgSVAbn
primaries are a way off so I'm hoping this becomes a competition to out-left the other. I'm already dreading the sexism but hoping this many women in the field dulls the impact on any single woman. ANYWAY, having two people who want to "the progressive one" is, I think, very good
the ball is in Bernie's court to match that &amp; maybe even exceed it, to respond to criticism from 2016 about his shortcomings in those areas. it's clear that Warren, a woman who grew up middle class &amp; was a mostly-single working mother, gets it. I'd LOVE for Bernie to get it too
one thing that Warren is doing, which I love, is she's sharing platforms that are unequivocal about how poverty intersects with race and gender and how reproductive justice is economic justice. her tax plan excites me &amp; her proposal for universal child care is incredible.
(if you don't like bernie sanders' personality, that's a dumb reason to vote for someone with worse policies. but also, if you're a bernie voter who doesn't understand why some people have serious issues with how he speaks about race/class, that's also dumb!!!)
hero worship in politics is toxic &amp; stupid!!!!!! politicians should be challenged, not idolized. there is legit criticism of every single person in the race and that should be discussed. but the most important thing is to support policies &amp; platforms. they aren't your friends

feel like I've said this a lot but just to be extremely clear: I love Criminal Minds so much and I think it is a great show
Am I proud that I watched 314 eps of Criminal Minds in 82 days (averaging 3.8 episodes/day which is 2.75 hours oh my god)? Proud isn't the right word, but I am accepting. Considering it takes only 28 days to form habits, I am, as you can imagine, panicking about what to do now
I really tried to savor season 14, which is the most recent season of Criminal Minds, and I stretched it over 9 days, which is literally the best I could do considering it was only 15 episodes. now I'm all caught up and have to wait with everyone else for the FINAL SEASON EVER

nearly killed my boyfriend when I said very genuinely that him having a bad cold made me realize how much I'm usually the center of attention. he laughed so hard he did something I guess I could most closely describe as "sputtering" and his legs almost buckled. I'm soooo funny!!!

(which is not to say that current writing staffs are overflowing with straight cis white women! but looking at the gatekeeping &amp; institutional barriers, there's obviously a great deal of hiring privilege that we have &amp; nonwhite, disabled, and queer ppl don't!)
I think these workshop series were a great success, but next time I want to get more women of color in the room. I only shared the registration info on twitter &amp; had no idea what to expect. I learned from this round who that reaches, and will try some other approaches next time!
thank you, too, to the hundreds of ppl who took the time to fill out a feedback survey! I'm thrilled that 99% of you found the workshops interesting/helpful &amp; I'm noting the most common requests: social networking events, a workshop on desk pieces, and more info about writers rms
@caveatnyc @MelindaTaub @MikeDrucker @annadrezen @hordie @jennyhagel thank you to the 500+ people who attended!!! 	thanks to @wrongwhale who, when I asked if @caveatnyc could donate space, asked ‚Äúhow many weekends do you need?‚Äù	&amp; the biggest thank you to the teachers who donated a lot of time to prepare &amp; teach. it was a big ask &amp; I‚Äôm so grateful.
@caveatnyc @MelindaTaub @MikeDrucker @annadrezen @hordie fifth and final workshop was this morning, taught by @jennyhagel on late night packets. when I moved to NY I‚Äôd only go to Harold nights her team performed on, so this was especially cool for me!!! man, this was a v inspirational &amp; helpful workshop and absolutely packed. https://t.co/Fml8xXOHrw
@crimeboy5 @SamFishell cowardly to share your side of this while I was sleeping
I'm not saying all women are taught to apologize too much. What I'm saying is I just said to my boyfriend, "I'm sorry I thought a feather was a spider."
thx to ppl for the venmo requests. will try to do it again in a few weeks. $500 went real quick &amp; it was only up for 15 min. if u saw it but weren't quick enough on the request button and it's an emergency, DM me &amp; I'll see what I can do. xo

to be clear, the old man WAS texting "Curses! Foiled again!"	woman was writing an email that out of the corner of my eye appeared to have the subject "FUCKING UPDATE"	smell mystery never solved	I'll be looking over my shoulder for the rest of the day........... can't be too safe
I had the unholy train trinity today, AKA being surrounded by 1) a crying woman typing a text so furiously she might break her fingers, 2) an old man with XL font writing something like "Curses! Foiled again!" 3) a putrid smell with NO CLEAR SOURCE. Bad omen. Must be vigilant.

petition to retire "you're my favorite _________" / "I'm your ONLY _________" from all movies or TV shows. if u want to get the same thing across just have the first person say "I'm kind of a dum dum" and then the second person reply, "dum dum beep boop." thanks!
7- idk who wrote this but I just want to say I love you and I get it and your feelings are 100% valid but also try to ignore them bc they ended in, "maybe late night isn't right for me" and that's wrong bc it is. if u wanna talk about this more, email me!!!!
6 - late night needs you. TV needs you. the world!!! all of it!!! needs you. shows suck more because yr voice isn't on it. look out for each other and share opportunities. submit even when you're like "this is stupid! some harvard grad will get it!" don't write packets in &gt;1 font
5 - I think Anna said most of what u should be doing is trying to be the answer to the question "Hey, you know who'd be good for that?" Yes, u have to do more work than white men to be in the convo. FUCK THAAAT. but I PROMISE: if you're good u WILL get a chance. be ready for that
4 - "get twitter famous" is hell BUT... what does it really mean? it means be visible. share yr gift &amp; POV. making your own stuff does this too! this advice is really just "put yourself out there." be loud &amp; take up space online bc you can and it DOES help. it's also free!!!
3 - rarely are packets invite-only. "find white men to tell you" is half joke, half real. EVERYONE should share packets bc it benefits all. if yr friend gets hired THAT IS GOOD FOR YOU. yr unsolicited packet might not get read, but also it might, &amp; u also now have more practice!!
1 - late night, &amp; TV in general, has a serious pipeline problem which IS demoralizing. it's objectively more difficult to get staffed if u don't have certain pedigrees.	2 - that IS changing (slowly) esp w/ new shows like @BusyTonightTV, @robinthede's sketch show, @SHODesusAndMero
"One thing [I found] disheartening is the disconnect between clear passion for diversity and a lack of tools &amp; bandwidth to really pursue [it]. Hearing that my options were 'find white men to tell you abt packet opportunities or get famous on Twitter' was really demoralizing."
Reading through feedback from weekend one of late night writing workshops and read a piece of feedback that really struck me. I want to share &amp; discuss it. Here was the comment, mildly abridged to fit in one tweet:

I keep having dreams in which I own a tablet (sure) that‚Äôs the size of a TV and it‚Äôs so heavy and it won‚Äôt turn on, but that‚Äôs not what the dream‚Äôs about. what did I do in my waking life that makes me dream in extra stupid Black Mirror and can I stop it
‚Äútwice day‚Äù seems like something the lin-manuel miranda character would say in the new mary poppins and that‚Äôs reaaaalllly getting to me
i swear to god twice day i still see new pieces like "why marie kondo can't fix your anxiety" or "why doing a konmari isn't the answer to your parents divorce." bitch, it is a book/show about clutter and you do not have to read/watch it

one of my favorite things about the "you're my person" phrase from grey's anatomy that's now a cultural mainstay and all over etsy mugs &amp; cutesy cards is that it is said by cristina to meredith to explain that she's listed her as the emergency contact for her scheduled abortion

yes, the 13th season of Criminal Minds is available for purchase for $35. but.................... I have to have a line somewhere. don't I? please god I can't spend $35 and buy a season. I just signed up for CBS all-access. how much more must I degrade myself for the thing I love
here's one massive fucking problem: I signed up for CBS all-access (ugh) and they only have season 14!! netflix ends at season 12!! I haven't gone more than two days without watching a Criminal Minds episode in two months. this is about to be an emergency. WHERE IS SEASON 13???
took my sweet time (nine days) and just finished season 12. the cast felt imbalanced this season, not just with Hotch leaving, but everyone took leaves of absences and had personal subplots. it was a lot, but I forgive everyone. I love Criminal Minds and nothing will change that!

reproductive justice centers black women's voices and experiences. repro justice is not simply about abortion access. it is about fighting reproductive oppression-- the power systems that limit choices/access/education based on economic status, race, immigration status, etc.
i will support the democratic candidate with the farthest left agenda even if i don't like them. it isn't about me, it's about all of us. that said, it's an absolute requirement that they have a radical commitment to &amp; understanding of reproductive justice. no compromise there!!!

obviously Ted Bundy, big picture? not hot. but the thing was that people didn't expect him to be so violent and terrifying BECAUSE he was hot. you're casting a celeb to play him. up the hotness to make it work. another option? don't make a fucking movie about Ted Bundy!!!!!!!!!

I love to jump &amp; yell very loud about unionizing, but it's important to point out that digital media is fueled by freelancers. it's much more complicated &amp; difficult to unionize when you're not working on a contract. and it's terrifying when your FT editor gets fired. bad day.
what's angering &amp; sinister about it is that buzzfeed was making money. this wasn't a digital media bubble bursting or blowback from a video pivot, as it so often is. this is capitalistic trash by a CEO who said his employees don't need to unionize because he would protect them.
unfortunately, everyone who's worked in digital media has experienced the gutting of a department or team where talented, brilliant people &amp; great friends are let go. it's more than the anxiety of losing a job/insurance/etc. it's emotionally brutal. this buzzfeed purge is awful.

weirdly do not miss Morgan all that much, but am surprised &amp; was sad he left mid-season. soon I will finally look at Shemar Moore's instagram, but only when I have 10 or so free hours to spiral. "escaped serial killers from previous episodes" is a great cliffhanger &amp; I can't wait
to consider subscribing to CBS all-access so you can watch season 13 of criminal minds doesn't feel too bad. to know with absolute certainty that you will subscribe to CBS all-access and that you never even really had a choice? that's unbearable. but I'm getting ahead of myself
hi, I have finished season 11, or as I lovingly call it "the season of two-parters." so many two-parters! hey Criminal Minds writers, stop thinking so big! I'm just kidding, I love you, never change your perfect minds. season 12 is the last one on netflix, so yes, I'm panicking!!
I‚Äôm not ready to share details, but I can confirm that something truly fucked up and sinister happened when I was eating a hot dog tonight. I am stable for now, but have a long road ahead. The sole witness has been given a protective detail and will undergo therapy. Thank you.
quick dispatch from season 11. in the last couple mins of this ep, Joe Walsh is inexplicably in poker game (playing himself!!!) and then the closing quote is from "Life Is Good." Bill Withers is there, too. I know there's a reason, but I don't want to know it, no one tell me. https://t.co/vz8rZMWpcK

@MelindaTaub just a kettlebell class I‚Äôve taken dozens of times before, but today happens to be ruining my life
It‚Äôs 6:20 so now I‚Äôm in a full blown panic. Who knows how many hours I have left before I MUST go to bed and however many it is (at least four!) it isn‚Äôt enough, and I will be exhausted tomorrow, which is the WORST THING to be and definitely not something I am all the time anyway
@luckybrand can you explain how the exact same style jeans fluctuate in sizing constantly? I ordered the size I currently wear, then had to size up three sizes for them to fit! in another style, i had to go down two sizes. this happens all the time w/ you &amp; it's a massive hassle
well, it's almost 3:30 which means it's time for me to start getting upset that I signed up for a gym class before work tomorrow morning! hours from bedtime and yet convinced everything is irreparably bad &amp; exhausting. gorgeous!

@udeskym oh my god I just looked up what episode was yours and I LOVED IT. it's on my UNABRIDGED (help) fave list. loved ALL of it, but the reveal at the end that the first victim actually did commit suicide is a top ten gutting moment on the show. I promise I am not blowing smoke!!!!!
season 10 had a strangely legendary episode (strange bc who has a legendary ep in SEASON 10???) called Mr. Scratch (dir. by Gubler, baby!) &amp; it was so good!! Two months ago this tweet would have been NONSENSE to me!!!! I don't remember what it was like to be that girl anymore!!
I watched all of Criminal Minds season 10..... in two days. I know this is "bad." I would like to lie and say it took longer, but I am an honorable person, like the agents of the BAU (in Criminal Minds.) Hoping the perk of finishing on a Saturday night is no one is seeing this!!!

Wow!! 500 people have signed up for workshops! I've spent all day going through forms &amp; getting to know y'all to make rosters. I also learned from yr surveys that there's extra interest in late night packets, so now 2 workshops will cover that. (The 2nd graph is political comedy) https://t.co/ixJeQuV706
@LarissaComedian Okay, I actually just checked and I've already placed you! Set aside 10:30AM-1PM on Saturday, 2/9.

incredible piece from @annehelen that made me think ‚Äúyes! yes! YES!!!‚Äù throughout. wild to say, but all millennials should read this: https://t.co/s9LOGFxHgP
@sarahelizaa_ certain shows are harder to get packets for than others. some shows don't staff every season or have a list of ppl they want. but late night shows in general have quite a revolving door and I know ppl @ SNL, Fallon, Kimmel, &amp; Corden who got hired off a packet someone fwd'd them
@sarahelizaa_ ... and that you sort of have to tell everyone who you're friendly with in the community that you're looking to hear about packets. that's also why it's so important to share them. once a friend gets hired somewhere, you can an in/pipeline to hear about hiring at that show.
@sarahelizaa_ the other thing you're bringing up if no one you know has an "in" for packets, there's a question of how to get in the loop of knowing what shows are hiring. that's the hardest part. it is my personal opinion that people are too coy with sharing their desire to get staffed...
@sarahelizaa_ short answer: yes, unrepped people get hired off of packets for late night shows all the time! 	long answer: i think you're bringing up a few different things here. the first is that the internship --&gt; staff or assistant --&gt; staff pipeline is crowded &amp; not guaranteed.

I am very passionate about this!! we have a little Q&amp;A with the Full Frontal interns when they start their semester &amp; I immediately make an ECCENTRIC FIRST IMPRESSION by shouting about how everyone has to share packets and be each others' agents!!! a rising tide lifts all boats!
also want to say that many, many ppl do not get reps until they get their first TV job. reps are in no way required for all submissions. the truth is everyone just has to help each other. if yr friend gets hired, that's a GREAT thing for you, so send them that packet you got!!!!
@karal00 honestly I love it?? it tells me to stand up once an hour and has an app called ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù that has a blooming/deflating flower to match your inhalation/exhalation. watch treats me like a baby but watch is god

@nwalks just got tickets for the 31st!! can‚Äôt wait
Hi, me again! We just hit 200 registrations!!! That's more than a quarter of total capacity for all 5 workshops, which means I might close the form before the week is out if every class fills up. If that happens, I promise to do more later this year. Thanks for understanding!
@RohanNadkarni it's overwhelming but as Marie Kondo says, tidying has an end!!!!
@alexnjacobs @AmySilverberg hell yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am always down to talk Marie Kondo with anyone. I never ever thought her method would work for me, and I especially didn't think it would have a lasting impact but it did and I'm unfortunately obligated to talk at length about it to anyone, even when people want me to stop
I just watched the first episode of Marie Kondo's show and dang, do I have a lot of affection for that tiny bizarre woman. I read her book &amp; tidied almost three years ago (!!!) &amp; it changed my life even though it's crazy. I wrote about it for @GQMagazine:		https://t.co/Ol405kX2ou

@lrnlrsn I want to scream!!!!!! also it is so big of you to not tag this person!!!!!!!
‚Äúmy watch is stupid and expensive but it confirms that my fear of death and loss impacts me physically‚Äù
I was gifted a smart watch &amp; was like, this is something no one needs, but then I got anxious &amp; saw my heart rate almost double &amp; now I‚Äôm thinking about how much I‚Äôve paid therapists to tell me my anxiety is real when I could‚Äòve bought this dumb self-gaslight killer watch instead
I've also seen other people in different cities say they would love to see some of these materials online. I'll see what I can do!
It looks like we've got about 130 people signed up in the first four hours!!! I've seen some ppl call this an "application." Just to be clear: there is no application, this form is merely a tool to place people in classes that match interest/avail. No barriers, baby
I went outside tonight. The air was cold, not like inside air at all
@TheOhBits @caveatnyc hi!! I've filled up all our time slots for this round but I hope to do this again in the future and will absolutely hit you up. thank you!!!!
Hi! Here is that survey!		https://t.co/Q8CLGk2fzY
This form will be open for at least a week. I'll post any updates to this thread. You can also ask questions on this thread, and I'll do my best to answer them. This is a big thing to coordinate, and I'm doing my best but I think it's going to be really cool and helpful.
I'm thrilled to share that I've organized free/low cost workshops about Late Night Comedy for women, LGBTQ+, nonwhite, &amp; disabled writers in NY. @caveatnyc is partnering w/ me &amp; writers from SNL, Full Frontal, Late Night &amp; more are teaching! Sign up:		https://t.co/Q8CLGk2fzY

my boyfriend is getting so mad at me because he is trying to do real work and I'm watching The Masked Singer and saying OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD over and over again and also screaming a little
I would like to address the rumors about how I got back to Brooklyn Sunday night and have not left my apartment since. This is true and also no one spread this rumor because no one talks about me because I never leave my house if I can help it. Happy New Year to me only
@marissatweeting I KNEW IT

also lol i was never going to vote for biden for like a thousand reasons, he is awful awful awful
sanders has VERY recently sucked w/ this. his voting record is great!! but when it comes to him being a movement leader, he's openly willing to trade away repro rights for "non-social issues" which is embarrassingly dumb. how does he not get that repro justice IS econ justice???
ok cuz y'all asking: biden has a dicey record on repro rights, though the last 10 years have been..... fine..... tho of course in that time he wasn't voting on legislation or having to take a personal stance
no dem candidate is perfect but I‚Äôll tell you, there is NO chance in hell I‚Äôm giving my primary vote to ANYONE who‚Äòs said the right to abortion is optional in a progressive platform. even if the rest of their agenda is lefty &amp; good. I demand reproductive justice, uncompromised

I have discovered someone I like has unfollowed me on both instagram and twitter. I am very calm about this and not spiraling over it NOT THAT THEY WILL EVER KNOW THAT
@bransonreese probably but she's in witness protection so she can't really voice any allegiances. anyway, looked it up and the episode I just watched aired three days before Whitney Houston died. does this help
@bransonreese omg Hotchner's ex-wife was murdered like one month after balloon boy. this can't be a coincidence
@bransonreese you missed Prentiss dying, about 10 episodes where the team copes/mourns, the reveal that Prentiss faked her death, and a full resolution where everyone forgives her for deceiving them
despite the fact that I've watched 150 episodes of "criminal minds" in 30 days, netflix always tells me that the next episode is a "55% match" for me. that is such a profound and deep neg, my college boyfriend is taking notes

@bransonreese thank you for changing your photo!!!!!
I didn‚Äôt include any eps where team members are in danger or w/e bc for whatever reason that violates my invented rules of purity

y'know, I thought about taking the holidays off.... but instead decided to work twice as hard. it's a christmas miracle! I've finished season 6!!! it was........... bonko. I can't imagine how many online petitions I would have signed if I was watching in 2011. JUSTICE FOR JJ!!!!

it's sickening that a motto like "believe women," which is grounded in the fact that false accusations are basically nonexistent, can be weaponized. it's disgusting and sociopathic, &amp; seeing a woman do it to evade accountability tonight made me feel sick to my stomach. that's all
tonight I saw a woman (!) who was called out for harassment manipulate the convo by invoking language that connotes metoo. suddenly the behavior of the person she was harassing was "misconduct." anyone who criticized her was "tone policing." she "spoke out" &amp; was "minimized"
the most upsetting and triggering byproduct of the metoo movement has been seeing people co-opt the language in order to get away with their own shitty manipulative behavior. it is so deeply damaging to the cause, and it's also extremely apparent when it's happening!

I think it's despicable to accept $ to humanize someone who normalizes fascists &amp; advocates harm to ppl, i.e. the destruction of palestine. I don't care if bad ppl are "nice." w*iss liking p*yser, a fellow white woman working in media, is not impressive or surprising in any way
didn't click, didn't read, both of them suck. saw screenshots where they bond over agreeing re: the aziz ansari situation (the headline, if u recall, "aziz ansari is guilty... of not being a mind reader"!!!) &amp; the danger of the "moralistic left." anyway, THEY GOT PAID FOR THIS

Well, nothing says, "we're a resource for students" like putting "media interview requests" in a more prominent place than a button with mental health resources which, uh, is nowhere. You have to click on "mental health screening" or "clinical services" and really look. https://t.co/9p9BVShKdR
Also! The NU health center denied me a birth control refill until I came in for a pap smear, a procedure that had a SIX MONTH WAITLIST. They wouldn't refill it even if I made the appt; they'd only do it once I came in, forcing me to yo-yo w/ hormones &amp; increase risk of pregnancy.
This thread is upsetting. When I was at Northwestern, I was going through a family crisis &amp; needed immediate psych support.

@paulspyder Obviously the system is fucked &amp; many people can't afford to make one payment in full. I think my particular situation was unique because a) my insurance covered most of it, and b) I wanted an alternative to a payment plan. The only real answer is socialized healthcare.
@paulspyder I don't know. Many people pay in full without questioning (because they don't know they can negotiate) &amp; many don't pay at all (because they don't know they can negotiate). It balances out. Discounts are usually wrapped in SOME payment plan so providers guarantee they get paid.
I just got a hospital bill for an ER visit this summer. My insurance covered 85% but it was still $730. I called and asked what discounts (paying cash or otherwise) they could offer, and they said they'd reduce the bill by 20% if I could make a one-time payment. HELL YEAH, BABY

(I didn't say, but bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes. But also, who gives a shit)
9. Enjoy! For Native people, today is a day of mourning. https://t.co/ez0J7F4ePJ
8. The pie is done when the edges are set but the center is slightly jiggly. Set it on a cooling rack for 2 hours for the center to set. National sports teams use racist portrayals of Native people as mascots. People claim "spirit animals" and wear Native identity as a costume. https://t.co/9C7l5XdeHc
7. Because I blind-baked, I needed a foil rim around my crust to prevent burning. If you don't blind bake, keep an eye on the crust and add this (or a full foil tent depending on pecan topping) later on. I live on someone else's land: https://t.co/o2zHcOdb1U https://t.co/UjXvujtetd
6. Pour the filling into the pie crust (I did a 15 min blind bake.) That looks soooooo good. 70% of Native people today are uninsured. Native hospitals are critically underfunded, and often far away. https://t.co/4WEaXIZTSb
5. Finally, stir in 2C of toasted pecans. In the European colonization of America, white people routinely massacred Native people. Over hundreds of years, more than 60 massacres were carried out by colonizers and/or military forces, often against unarmed mothers and children.
4. Add 1/4C butter, 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1.5tsp vanilla extract, careful not to over-stir. Until 2013, tribal courts did not have jurisdiction over non-Native perpetrators of crimes. Still, 67% of federal prosecutors decline to prosecute sexual abuse cases against Native people.
3. Add 4 room temp eggs to mixture, stirring to make sure eggs don't curdle. 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their lifetime. 84% of Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime. 97% of this abuse is committed by NON-NATIVE individuals, and it's rarely prosecuted.
2. Dissolve sugar and bring to a boil for 2-3 minutes, stirring continually. Remember 1 in 4 Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in poverty. Safe drinking water and running water/plumbing are unavailable in over 13% of Native homes. Take mixture off heat. https://t.co/g7iBMFV3xy

Also... this is the fun one about me... I don‚Äôt really like Bernie Sanders!!! I still like @DemSocialists! Woohoo!!!!!
And remember: @DemSocialists is not a party! While many like the idea of a third party/proportional representation, they get that‚Äôs not where we‚Äôre at. They do work within the Democratic Party, particularly to get progressive Democrats elected. It‚Äôs fun!
All you have to like about @DemSocialists to join are the ideas. The people who yell about it the most sometimes suck, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should stay away. The more women, POC, and LGBTQ people get involved the less we can hear from the shitty self-appointed spokesmen.

I was prepared to say, if they couldn't offer me a discount, "I know that my insurance company likely would have only paid X dollars. At the very least, can my bill be reduced to that?" Even then, it would have been about 50% of my bill.
I didn't end up needing this, but Healthcare Bluebook shows what, on average, insurance companies pay for all kinds of procedures/tests/services. It is less than what you're charged, and hopefully more than what you will pay after asking for discount.		https://t.co/EWDSkvkq3e

@ChrissySh I also think her hair color going back to brown in the final scene is meant to be read as an act that honors him, which implies that her (awful) orange hair went against his values ‚Äî and therefore that he was right about all that
@inlandemperor @guybranum And, yes, I‚Äôve loved reading your thoughts! Thanks for being game to chat and being so much smarter and more pleasant than every single person who has ever responded to me on this website
@inlandemperor @guybranum That makes sense to me. I felt Cooper‚Äôs direction pretty strongly when I was viewing it (he also directed in his Maine voice, apparently, which... wow) and O think it naturally skewed towards his rise/fall with Ally‚Äôs experience often serving as something to challenge him
@inlandemperor @ArchivalGossip @guybranum @PopRocket @wyntermitchell oh wow!! to me, it is almost exactly ‚Äúlook what you made me do‚Äù in both theme and melodic variation, but also in how much I personally like it (not at all) !!!
@inlandemperor @guybranum Absolutely. I just, and I know I sound like a broken record here, don‚Äôt think the movie effectively conveys this on its own. (But it is better at suggesting this than it is at providing Ally‚Äôs perspective.)
@ArchivalGossip @inlandemperor @guybranum I absolutely agree!
@inlandemperor @guybranum Ultimately what I was saying in my initial joke tweet is that Lady Gaga's performance more deeply and directly addresses this dynamic than the script does. The blueprint of heterosexual romance normalizes some of the behavior, but on top of that, the movie sidesteps a lot of it.
@inlandemperor @guybranum I agree with a lot of what you're saying. I do disagree with your dismissal of his abusive behavior as "surface" for many reasons, but that isn't necessarily integral to your point.
@inlandemperor @guybranum I see what you're saying. But don't you feel that the emphasis on authenticity and the POV of Jackson Maine (she nixes dancers and then seeks his approval at her commitment to the "message," etc.) shows that the movie doesn't necessarily hold pop in the regard that you or I do?
@arielzetina all I'm saying is if scientists want a break from the whole global warming thing, I would like some answers
@mwidds another person was like it's about the "sacrificial aspect of heterosexuality" and how  "women &amp; men both can‚Äôt be winners" like i know straight people are wild but there's something else happening here!!!!
@inlandemperor @guybranum I also think your read sort of bypasses the abuse in this particular relationship which is linked to Ally‚Äôs womanhood. She sees being a woman as a caretaker, has no girlfriends, performs female glamour alongside drag queens, etc. It‚Äôs not simply the either/or of male/female fame
@mwidds lol people literally responding to me saying ‚Äúthe message of the movie‚Äù says otherwise
@inlandemperor @guybranum The movie seems confused about whether or not Ally's album is "good" -- Her performance is clearly dumb/inauthentic but then Jackson is wrong to judge it. It's unspoken to a fault that women are held to different standards in the industry. I just found it ideologically sloppy!!
@inlandemperor @guybranum I think that is an extremely generous read of the writing/directing!!!!

I still get death/rape threats a year after ‚Äúamplification‚Äù of backlash to a tweet I wrote about respecting women. His snark in the replies shows he doesn‚Äôt get what happens to women online. He can tweet whatever he wants &amp; feel safe.

Most of these are pretty small asks, though a couple are larger. It‚Äôs great to contribute money to big causes, but sometimes it feels even better to directly help another person and know it impacts them immediately. So, this is that!

@lenaeinbinder üíú you lena!
@mileskahn To me, the main issue is that people know so little about severe mental illnesses that even when a public figure with a known diagnosis is having a textbook manic episode, there's no understanding of how to respond. There are ways to minimize damage AND discuss his impact.
@mileskahn I thought it was well-known that Kanye has bipolar, but I've learned through the replies it's not. I've also learned that people have so little understanding of bipolar, they can't envision a middle ground between "total denouncement" and "excusing because of mental illness."
@MostlyPregnant yes!!! beautifully articulated. thank you
@wyntermitchell Also having access to healthcare doesn‚Äôt necessarily help when you‚Äôre manic, same as with addiction/ED/etc. You can‚Äôt make someone get help who doesn‚Äôt want it. The fact that he has such enormous power/wealth probably makes it harder for people to force him to stabilize
@wyntermitchell I just disagree with the idea that mental illness is a crutch. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a scheme. He‚Äôs sick and doesn‚Äôt want help. He should still be held accountable. My ‚Äúhill‚Äù is that I‚Äôm hurt by people who make shitty jokes about bipolar. That‚Äôs the crux of my thread
@CInsistence no, I appreciated what you had to say!
tonight I tried to have conversations about mental illness with people who replied to me. if the "Defending Your Life" system was real the judge would see a video of me tonight and be like "okay, yeah, that's all I need to see. Send that dumb bitch back to earth right now"
@FaWonderer My thread was just saying, "hey, don't make shitty jokes about bipolar disorder" and then you asked "how dare you?" and said I degraded people with mental illness. In my thread I said I'm in pain. You attacked anyway. Don't tell me it wasn't your intention to make me feel bad.
@yodaberg I assumed he was off meds. There's something w/ bipolar called "the seduction of mania" that's very common. Sometimes stability can feel "flat" and considering Kanye has called bipolar his "superpower" (a view that... is problematic) I wouldn't be surprised if he ditched his meds
@st8less Okay, buddy. At this point I just think you should read the thread because that's not what I said at all and I'm not responding to shit that I clearly didn't say. Have a good night!
@redactedbadger hm yes that's the part where I say "he should be held accountable"
@yodaberg I think we're on the same page. He's causing damage; I wasn't disputing that. I'll just say I bet he has a support system trying to help. It's difficult to get anyone unstable to take their medication or check themselves in to a hospital, let alone someone with this power/wealth
@st8less Kanye has discussed his bipolar diagnosis and has been placed on 72 hr holds; there's no such record/history with Lahren or Jones. I'm truly not clear on what you want to prove here. Mental illness does not make you a Trump supporter or a bad person. It's a disease to be treated
@FaWonderer hm let me try your tactic: "are you calling bipolar people murderers?" that was easy! 		you clearly don't know anything about severe mental illness, &amp; didn't read my tweet-I said he should be held accountable. as for going to hell, reading your tweets i'm already there, so thanks
@st8less this thread's about not making shitty bipolar disorder jokes &amp; how ppl should learn to recognize severe mental illness. it's not about liking kanye (which tbh I don't!) &amp; it's definitely not about tomi lahren, etc who aren't mentally ill. truly what the fuck are you talking about
@FaWonderer uh some people with bipolar are also shitty people, that doesn't mean he doesn't have bipolar disorder or that people shouldn't learn how to spot a manic episode. it seems you didn't read/understand my thread, so honestly how dare YOU (x3) tag me in your rude bullshit?
@yodaberg What I'm saying is that it is not unrelated. textbook manic episodes present as racing thoughts, paranoia, feelings of power, aggression, perceived epiphanies, knowing "the answer," erratic nonsense, etc. I'm not saying don't call him out - just know what's going on
@DarthSpiderMike also no. "mentally ill" isn't shorthand for people who are racist. would you ever say "you have to have cancer to support trump"? I'm actually gonna go out on a limb and say you don't really respect people with mental illness if this is how you think about them
@DarthSpiderMike yeah sorry that's just not how it works. if you're unstable you are unstable, you aren't scheming, you are sick. your tweet is insulting

also, every time he barked about how his life was ruined and his name was destroyed and his reputation shredded, I thought, "this is not a good argument for giving you a job that depends on 'credibility' &amp; it's alarming that you don't realize that" idk I'm spiraling don't mind me
I can't stop thinking about how much Kavanaugh yelled yesterday, how scary his anger was, how inappropriately partisan his points were, how rude he was to people, especially women, and how undeniably unfit he was for any job, let alone this job. how could anyone stand by that
Some personal news: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be getting out of bed today
There are many qualified judges (some of whom are women) who would be just as devoted to overturning Roe. There was no meaningful reason why it had to be Kavanaugh, even with the indictment stuff. Going through with him is purposefully cruel. Stop explaining stupid bullshit to me
I don‚Äôt care if you agree with me; if you respond to me with your basic-ass explanation of Flake‚Äôs career aspirations for higher office or lobbying like I‚Äôm a fucking idiot who doesn‚Äôt watch the news 15 hours a day for my job, I‚Äôm blocking you. I understand the situation. Shut up

EXHIBIT A: PROOF THAT I PLAN NOT TO RAPE OR BE RAPED OVER THANKSGIVING WEEK, A HOLIDAY I ENJOY VERY MUCH https://t.co/aC1jzPqTWM
The type of crying Kavanaugh is doing is the type of crying you see after children compete on reality talent shows and they have so much adrenaline and fear and want it so bad that they just are leaking, and I mean absolute NO disrespect to talented children with this comparison
@ JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TEACH YOU HOW TO CRY, YOU'RE DOING A WEIRD JOB
This reminds me of my interview for @FullFrontalSamB. I screamed right in Sam's face, "LET'S BEGIN WITH MY HISTORY OF BEING FUNNY. SINCE I WAS A CHILD I FOUND A WAY TO MAKE LIGHT OF SITUATIONS. YOU WILL FIND NO PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT I AM NOT FUNNY. SECOND, I AM VERY EASYGOING"
Kavanaugh is not in pain. I know what pain looks like. He is experiencing deep frustration and fear that he might not get what he wants. But this is a JOB INTERVIEW, not a criminal trial, and this behavior is extremely concerning for an applicant. I find him very scary.
I'm so upset I'm missing entire words from this sentence but u get it

I don't really believe in God, but I cherish Jewish practices/traditions that ask people to be better, more thoughtful, ambitiously and radically loving people. There is so much value to taking time to think about how you have treated others and admit to shortcomings. /3

THE END!!!! I liked it!!! it was not as scary as the ride thank you!
okay yes I see the birds. the dinosaurs of the sky. we still have dinos. thank you.
give me..... laura dern's arms..... hammond's white linen......... little girl's braid....... jeff goldblum as husband...... I will become Jurassic Park. I will be hot and happy
BUT SCIENCE ONLY GETS U SO FAR........ MY BIG HUNGRY GIRL HAS SAVED THE DAY
THIS IS WHY WE NEED MORE WOMEN IN STEM. THIS CHILD HACKER IS SAVING THEM ALL
these kids don't know it because it's something you learn in tenth grade, but if they'd just make a raptor like a grilled cheese in that kitchen they'd be fine
might be obvious to state, but the child who got electrocuted is not doing well
WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SNAKE IN THERE ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. SHOW ME HIS FACE GETTING RIPPED OFF DON'T SHOW ME A GODDAMN SNAKE
HAS A CHILD DIEDOH MY GOD A RAPTOR USED A DOOR
very good of that man to die for laura dern. automatic bid to heaven
this t-rex is breaking ALL THE RULES!!!!!!!!
that dino sneeze was disgusting. this movie should be rated R
oh good a woman to teach a man that he has to "feel" it. ok wait never mind laura is yelling! oh no she's yelling about the people we love. honestly torn on this one
awww this scene is sweet. dr. grant is legally these kids' dad now
JEFF LIVES! please tell me his dick is okay
not to be a bitch but cars really should stay on the road rather than in trees, streams, off cliffs, etc. much safer
grant doing better with fatherhood but needs to dial back the intense eye contact about 30%. know it's a stressful time but I think it'll help
the minute he came on screen i said to @bransonreese  "dino gonna eat that guy" and it feels good to be right. assuming he didn't have children
and who is this gorgeous girl full of poison? are you also hungry?
newman took a tumble
she ate lawyer but still hungry and I get it!!!! sometimes u are like "intellectually I know a whole pizza is enough but my body demands more"
HAS THIS DINO KILLED JEFF GOLDBLUM???????
uh oh big girl still hungry!!! maybe he find lil legal snack in the toilet
omg that's samuel l jackson!!!! samuel........ where did you get that cigarette that lasts forever
I'd let this Jeff Goldblum character fuck me in a way that ruins the rest of my life
houston? we're gonna need a bigger toilet
what if laura dern is crying because her fetish is a sick triceratops and she just thought in her whole life she would never have an orgasm
jeff goldblum is smart enough to stay in the car and THAT is why he is my boyfriend
ungrateful scientists, maybe just enjoy the weird way a goat sits down!!! not everything has to be about a dino you know
hm this poison spitting dino is not where they said it would be. probably just drinking some water, nothing to worry about I'm sure
wow this subplot of laura dern loving kids while the sensible man does not is not working for me
hammond and jeff goldblum each think they're socialists and I don't know which is more legitimate, but I know which one I want to fuck!!!!
wow I wasn't kidding there's nothing left of that cow
OMG THAT DINO WAS NOT A HUNGRY BOY.... IT WAS A HUNGRY GIRL. wow a lot of hungry girls. that cow is dead now
if my lawyer didn't know the difference between "animatronic" and "auto erotica" I would fire him, and I think that's fair
loving this animated backstory. very helpful and clear, take notes @GameOfThrones
personal announcement: I will only have sex with men wearing Jeff Goldblum's half-functional transition lenses for the rest of my life!!!!!!!!!!
I know this is so dumb but it's insane that the logo of the Jurassic Park in the movie is the logo of Jurassic Park movies ???????
dr. grant is having the reaction to seeing dinos that I do when I enter a sephora in manhattan
pretty big dino. hungry boy
also this helicopter is way too close to the water what are we trying to prove here
oh thank god I didn't see this as a kid, I could not have afforded to have a sexual awakening around this Jeff Goldblum character, I was already too fragile for this world
now look at THIS kooky old fella!!!!!!!!! this guy is gonna be fun. he is gonna be all about the dinos I can just tell
Laura Dern's boyfriend is kind of a jerk!!!!!!! don't terrorize a kid and ask me to respect dinos buddy, run away Laura u can do better
oh no a man has died
I'm watching Jurassic Park for the first time. I resisted for a long time and asked @bransonreese a million times if it's as scary as the ride, which I find actually very scary. Hopefully the dinosaurs are gorgeous and quiet!

It‚Äôs only getting worse. Many of the jobs that some of us had and lived on before ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù don‚Äôt exist or don‚Äôt pay anymore. Those of us with jobs, a voice, and even a little bit of power have to speak up and demand better. Payment for labor! Unions for all! Now and forever!!!
Contributors for websites, performers for improv theatres, writers for TV shows yet to be picked up... these people are doing labor that is the entire reason companies can make money at all. That they do this yet go un(der)paid is one of many ways capitalism fails us.
Artists‚Äô work is labor. Just because it comes from a place of passion doesn‚Äôt mean the artists shouldn‚Äôt be paid, and paid well. My mom is an accountant. She LOVES being an accountant. No one ever says, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky to be working at all. The experience is payment enough!‚Äù
Today is Labor Day, which means I gotta shout out my union, @WGAEast. Without the WGA, writers would be paid in snacks and experience. Unions aren‚Äôt only good for their members; they raise the floor for everyone. Because of my union I make a salary, have great benefits, and more!
@bransonreese you're right. my real answer is "you've got mail" "while you were sleeping" and then "you've got mail" again and "grey's anatomy" which is technically a movie (long, on a screen) and fifth place is a three way tie between them
@bransonreese branson....... i haven't seen any of these, but good news for you: mine is just "you've got mail" five times

socialism is the future. medicare for all, decriminalizing immigration, ending prison privatization &amp; the school to prison pipeline, ensuring free abortion on demand, etc - these are good fucking messages. (they're also the messages of the show I write for, not that you watch it)
next: the person you're attacking is not a perfect progressive but y'know who else is not perfect? bernie sanders. his views, for example, on reproductive justice are profoundly lacking. I don't see u being a bitch to him online tho? hold him to a higher standard too, dummy!!
also: I see you being assholes to women &amp; giving men the benefit of the doubt. it's a bad fucking look, and it's not congruent with our progressive platforms. either be horrible to everyone or be reasonable to everyone. make a choice, babe
for example, people who have supported HRC/centrists &amp; now believe in more radical progressive platforms are good, not bad. it's stupid to punish them for not having always been on board. we need the numbers. WELCOME them to leftism and share the platforms. that works better!!!
I am a proud n loud @DemSocialists member so I feel confident saying: god damn there are a lot of "leftists" who are fucking assholes online. and there are assholes everywhere, don't get me wrong, it's not a leftist thing, but this isn't how to show that socialism is good

I mean, aside from their abuses of privacy, ask yourself if you want to keep working for a billion dollar corporation that proudly serves as a platform for millions to see conspiracy theories, false information, and calls for violence (that have resulted in deaths worldwide). no.
the truth is that @facebook one hundred percent does not give a shit what their users think because we aren‚Äôt the consumers. we are the product, whose info they sell to corporations. but I think we all should delete Facebook. it is a very very bad site made by awful people
if @facebook took the fucking time to ban phrases like ‚Äúmen are garbage‚Äù which, as a reminder, is not hate speech, they have the time and resources to enforce whatever fucking content control they want. they just don‚Äôt want to protect anyone except men.
Hey @facebook explain to me why Holocaust deniers can find community on your site, but in my private group where a woman shared her story of being abused THREE WOMEN were prevented by your system from posting comments that were critical of men due to ‚Äúcommunity guidelines.‚Äù

Today, the way our government works to dehumanize migrants and poison public opinion to create hostility and fear towards anyone who isn‚Äôt white in this country ‚Äî I find this tactic to be very obvious. I know exactly what they‚Äôre trying to do.
Obviously we know that there were people who were not fooled by Nazi narratives and risked their lives to protect Jews. I assume if you would have asked them about the propaganda and government messaging, they would have been able to tell you exactly what was really happening.
I was taught Hitler was evil. I was taught Nazis, even the ones just following orders ‚Äúshould have known better.‚Äù And when I learned about propaganda, books really made it sound like it was this subtle mind-warping magic that no citizen could have guarded against.
I was 14 when I realized that the reason why we didn‚Äôt have huge Thanksgiving gatherings or dozens of cousins was because so much of my family tree was murdered in the Holocaust. I still can‚Äôt totally process that, and the way I was taught about the Holocaust didn‚Äôt help.

Thank you for reading, this has been Another Annoying Fucking Thing Many Women Have to Deal With That We Never Have Time to Complain About
This past month I was on a devil pill called Isibloom, which must have been made by the most incompetent people on the planet because it tastes absolutely foul. Everything about it sucks, and to its pharma company who clearly doesn‚Äôt give a shit about women: please go to hell
It‚Äôs already hard enough to find a birth control option that is ~*~right for you~*~ and then then pharmacy will just suddenly replace the pill your body is used to. There ARE ways to get a special order but it‚Äôs a big effort most women don‚Äôt have the time to carry out every month
One of the most frustrating things about being on the pill is that your pharmacy just routinely switches what generic you‚Äôre on, which you have to take to stay on schedule, and you might have shitty side effects for a month or more!!!!

@MikeDrucker you should compare notes with the guy who tweeted at me with the assumption that I put my entire jalape√±o hand fully inside my vagina

in any case, whether or not Kanye is sick, which, again, there's no way to know and it's not my business, seeing how people react makes me sad because as a society we are so tragically undereducated about mental illness, and making fun of manic-like behavior enforces the stigma
in my experience, manic episodes often show up on social media as near-constant, passionate, somewhat nonsensical posting (multiple tweets per minute, rants about "the truth," etc.) it can be tough to tell, but generally, if something feels really off to you, it probably is.
in general, would just like to say: I have witnessed multiple manic episodes on social media and no one ever really knows what to do with them, because we culturally don't learn how to recognize it. below are some common symptoms of mania (not everyone presents all symptoms!) https://t.co/aTYlsDydkL

Hey @CynthiaNixon, just an update, the D/F doesn‚Äôt go into Brooklyn so you have to take the F/D, or do what I did, which is take the F/D to W4 then transfer to the D/F until the announcement that it ends in Manhattan then transfer back to a F/D. I paid so many taxes this year.
Hey @CynthiaNixon the F train is running on the D track &amp; the D is running on the F track, which means to get off on an F stop you have to take the D, which is running, but on the F track, which is free because the F is on the D track, &amp; all this should be illegal. Thank you.

@PileOfTears lorelei you should try what I do, which is love every single show I ever watch and have no true concept of "quality"
@tweetrajouhari what the hell!!! we never learned this in public school!!!!!!!
@PileOfTears I like the show too!! And I totally get that as a takeaway as a viewer, but I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs the message the men in the show are getting. I feel like they just get ‚Äúlet the real you shine through!‚Äù
@amos_true yes!!! It seemed more to me in this show to be framed as a version of self-care but you‚Äôre absolutely right
I just don‚Äôt buy the idea that cishet white men are inherently perfect, or that superficial changes naturally lead to deep ones! and I know everyone is just trying to enjoy a tv show, so sorry!!!!
I sincerely doubt his marriage fell apart because he never presented her with fresh guac, or had a messy house, or an untrimmed beard. yet we‚Äôre to believe that‚Äôs all it takes for a 57 y/o man to change his life
in the first episode we meet a thrice-divorced man who has no idea why his most recent marriage ended, but is determined to win his ex back. five people ‚Äúfix‚Äù his life as it appears to the world: they give him a groomed appearance, a clean house, a recipe for homemade guacamole
the idea of a ‚Äútrue self‚Äù is a philosophical shortcut that removes any difficult reflection from the equation and allows men to continue to be ‚Äúright‚Äù while admitting something in their life needs to change: ‚Äúdeep down I am a good person, no matter my actions‚Äù
but everything we know about socialization of boys points to a very different reality: that the foundation upon which many men form their world views and create behavioral patterns is toxic. contrary to what Queer Eye tells us, some men do have to do hard work to become better
one of the basic premises of the new Queer Eye is that within every straight man exists a perfect person, if only he removes the muck that obscures and walls that guard him from the rest of the world. you don‚Äôt need to CHANGE yourself, you just have to REVEAL your true self
I always knew I would never be an Olympian. Congrats to all of them, but I knew my true path was to take a full ten years to realize I‚Äôm not that good at musical theatre.
Trump only spent six minutes with grieving families in Florida before going back to his country club, but to be fair, that's long enough for him to say two whole sentences.
I don't know what the tipping point could possibly be for something to change. all of us losing someone? seeing a child shot dead? what will it take? already the majority of Americans support background checks. when will our government actually be led by the will of the people?
my boyfriend lost a close friend in one of the deadliest school shootings. my hometown grocery store was the location of a mass shooting where six died. each new shooting is hell for us, and more and more households are becoming like ours, where everyone has a gun violence story.
my second favorite GOP stance is "ain't no grief a flag at half mast can't fix! now what's for dinner? I'm simply famished"
my favorite GOP stance is "you know who should be ASHAMED??? the parents whose children were brutally murdered in their schools that used bad words on television!!!"

really got to hand it to bari weiss, for I guess at least skimming the aziz story before writing a lazy, genuinely underbaked take for the nytimes on how asking men to respect women is essentially asking them to "read minds." thanks for weighing in, very helpful!
oh! and one final thing: in these cases, it's extremely rare for there to be an "isolated incident." generally speaking, if a man had sex with one woman without consent, statistics say that this is recurring because it's a toxic internal philosophy of consent. okay thanks byeeee

this is a willful misinterpretation of what I'm talking about. this isn't about being asked on dates, it's about men applying a philosophy of "women secretly want it" to sexual encounters https://t.co/b7y2OUBVzv
and I do feel for the many, many well-loved men who are realizing they're a villain to someone they'd forgotten, or tried to forget, or somehow justified. today you can resolve to never put someone in a "grey area" again. because the age of consequences has arrived. finally!!!
many women are only just now realizing many of their sexual experiences were not consensual as we talked ourselves into believing they were, and we have the right to be angry and hurt about it. strength &amp; solidarity to women processing or reprocessing trauma. you are powerful!
I understand that recategorizing past sexual encounters as ones in which you didn't obtain consent is angering &amp; shameful &amp; causes you distress - but lashing out with denial, or forcing us to center your feelings over women's long-held trauma is unacceptable
men continue to coerce women into "grey area" sexual encounters because a) it's normalized, b) they rarely if ever experience one single consequence, and c) they carry no awareness and therefore none of the pain/trauma
understandably, men say they're counting on women to communicate when they're uncomfortable/disinterested. what men haven't realized is ~women already are~. if your definition of non-consent is a woman screaming &amp; punching you, that's very convenient because it's not gonna happen
reluctance from your sexual partner should be a red flag, and there shouldn't be a negotiation process where you keep asking until she's willing to participate in some sexual act. this should be common sense, but the person you're about to fuck should be truly eager to fuck you
non-consensual sexual experiences don't usually occur because a man thinks, "well, time for me to be a criminal!" most happen because of men's deeply engrained beliefs that women ~know not what they want~ &amp; "the chase" is sexy. but it's not!

Anyway, before I get swallowed in a rabbit hole of rage, you should support @kyrstensinema, a Democrat running for Senate in AZ. You can donate to her here: https://t.co/pIKBkqsJkM
I truly believe McSally is a bad person. Just the fact that last week she used the anniversary of the Gabby Giffords shooting (an event that is the whole goddamn reason she even had a seat to run for) to advocate against "harmful vitriol," not commonsense gun laws, is nauseating.
The fact is McSally's Pima County constituents largely do not like her. She votes with Trump &gt;95% of the time, and voted for both the GOP healthcare and tax bill. Now that she's running for Senate, she's pandering to Maricopa County Republicans, and she's pandering HARD.
Martha McSally is my hometown rep, and her ad today terrified me. Her crap about Sharia law and "standing up to liberals" is sickening. It's also entirely different from how she first came into politics in AZ. This was her first ad in 2012: https://t.co/cAwxAtLGhn

And speaking of people (flawless segue), Branson is the best person I know. I love him so much, and I can't tell you how much joy I feel that his whole dang life changed his this year because of a project he designed just to improve at something he really loved doing.
Making art for an audience of tens of thousands can be stressful, and not really what he anticipated when he started out. He also didn't anticipate so many people would be shitheads in the comments and give him a hard time. This also confirmed for me as a fan: artists are people!
You don't get rewarded every time you work hard, but Branson is really proof that if you work hard for long enough, people notice. And you're also then prepared to walk through doors when they opened for you. The old "How do you get to Carnegie Hall?" joke really is true.
Branson's entire world has opened up because people got to see his work. He has always been brilliant. But just sharing his comics with people, even when it didn't feel "ready" or "perfect," led to massive opportunities that changed his life. It's really inspiring!!!
Some days he hated his comic! Other days he was really proud! It's so fucking cool to watch someone push themselves and see their work in a big picture sense. It's also really cool to watch someone's determination and commitment directly lead to success, which is what happened!
When Branson set out to do this challenge, he was just starting to dabble in the form, but he felt like it clicked as a format for his voice and art, and he leaned in. He always challenged himself to try new techniques, tone, and styles, but most of all: do the best he could.
Hi! Many people know that my sweet partner @bransonreese vowed to make one comic a day for a year, and today he hit the year mark. I'm so proud and I learned so much about artistic commitment from watching him. So lemme brag on Branson for a sec:

I know she grew up with money and went to elite private schools, but Meghan Markle used to hold a briefcase on Deal or No Deal so this is, in its own way, a rags-to-riches story!!!
(Also Warren uses the exploding toaster example because she did have a toaster that caught fire because of an on-switch with no timer which is, logically, not how toasters operate anymore because it puts the consumer at risk) okay bye!!!
That's why I think you should care (a lot) about the CFPB! It's not perfect, but it has done a lot of good for many Americans who were cheated out of the future they worked hard to earn.
Banks haaaate the CFPB because it's one of the only things that keeps them from peddling predatory scams. What the CFPB does is nonpartisan. It's not a "liberal" agency. It's an agency that simply holds financial institutions accountable.
The CFPB also requires lenders who sell mortgages with high interest rates to have an outside appraiser determine the worth of the house for the borrower, has comment lines open for consumers to file complaints, and is actively working to end scams.
But the CFPB isn't just damage control, it also issues rules that protects you in future financial dealings.		Thanks to the CFPB mortgage lenders can't force you into high-priced loans, loan servicers face penalties if they don't have live customer service...
so does the CFPB work? Is it even doing anything if this is the first you've heard of it? The answer is yes and hell yes!		IT HAS RETURNED OVER $11.8 BILLION TO NEARLY 30 MILLION CONSUMERS.		when banks con you out of money, the CFPB fines them and has them return the money to you
That is what the CFPB is. It was established by Dodd-Frank, and is an independent agency. Within its jurisdiction are banks, credit unions, securities firms, payday lenders, mortgage-servicing operations, foreclosure relief services, debt collectors, and more. wow!!!
so this was basically her pitch: We need an agency (or something) that protects consumers of financial products. https://t.co/w1AzmPVpbZ
She pointed out that a mortgage/credit card is a product. We have government oversight to make sure you don't have lead in your food or a broken carseat for your child - so why don't we protect consumers when the product is financial?		In Warren's own words: https://t.co/MPrggzb24A
what she also said was: THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.		the bank system didn't accidentally miscommunicateand screw up your life, future, and savings. They simply wanted a fast profit and DIDN'T CARE. They used false advertising, confusing legalese, and fine print. Enter the CFPB:
one of the things that Warren (who, again, not yet an elected official just an expert on this stuff) said was - this will happen again without oversight or regulation AND the consumer (i.e. you, the American) is completely unprotected
as we all know now, that crash can be traced back to predatory bank bullshit like subprime lending, predatory lending, and severe bank deregulation. we're talking false advertising, bait-and-switch interest rates, etc that caused 10 million Americans to lose their homes
after the economy crashed in 2008, Warren was brought on to chair an oversight panel that would monitor the stabilization of our economy. They would release reports about the process, essentially analyzing the government's response and banks' cooperation/behavior. fun stuff!
let's talk about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and why you should care about it.		the CFPB was proposed by Elizabeth Warren, long before she was the elected official you love/hate, back when she was better known as one of the country's experts on bankruptcy law

@sasimons I think, to me, the real ask is that companies/producers/etc don't put women in this position where they have to choose between working (when that's so hard to come by) and sacrificing career for the sake of integrity while men keep skating by and get more chances
@sasimons the ripple effect of abusers always has the strongest negative impact on the least powerful people. already projects that had women/POC/LGBTQ voices produced by CK have been dropped. I don't know if these women firing their manager is a fair ask

@BadAndyRox but I believe you owe me an apology. You called me unintelligent, but you're the one who can't cite a specific example of what you accused.
@BadAndyRox There are plenty of specific problems with men's treatment towards women - that's what this list is. It's clear this list hurt your feelings
@kok3YY @BadAndyRox Please quote one specific bullet point that is hateful towards men. Don't talk around it and be general. Be specific.
@BadAndyRox Quote one specific bullet point that's hateful towards men. Why is that so hard for you to do? I know - because none of them are.

Don't let anyone make you think that birth control is about promiscuity or "morals." Birth control is freedom.
If a man doesn't want to be a father in order to focus on his career or education, that's his right. Women deserve that right, too.
To restrict women's access to birth control is restricting women's futures and success. Period.
Birth control also leads to better, longer-lasting marriages as well as healthier, happier kids.		https://t.co/WeqHxqBpnt https://t.co/mflxCwtdSV
1/3 of the wage gains women have made since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contraceptives. https://t.co/MYS3vmrOej
Birth control allows more women to attend/finish college, be primary breadwinners, and save money.		https://t.co/C6l8NDbZ6u
Birth control is additionally strongly linked to the career and wage advancement of women. Studies prove it:		https://t.co/qfS3jwCy2I
(Birth control is also really good for the U.S. economy.) https://t.co/cyvmJqwp2b
Women in poverty cannot get out of poverty without birth control. Family planning is left entirely up to women, and women pay the price.
Birth control isn't about having sex carefree! Family planning directly impacts women's careers and financial stability.

And as the needs of our society evolve and we become more enlightened, our laws should also reflect that!!
Sharpening the parameters of our constitutional rights through examining intent of our founding fathers is extremely American!
Also there are obvious public safety exceptions with the first amendment (dangerous speech, etc)
Free speech is a constitutional right but if an ink was found toxic, the gov‚Äôt mandating that it cannot be used/made is a different thing

Access to weapons designed for mass shootings is the number one problem. If another disease is to be treated, it's the white patriarchy.
Mental illness treatment as a substitute for gun reform is a myth invented by the right, AKA "guns don't kill people; people kill people."
42.5 million Americans have mental illness. Mental illness isn't the cause of gun violence. (Just like Islam isn't the cause of terrorism)

REMINDER: 74% of Arpaio's inmates are not convicted criminals. They're awaiting trial for traffic stops, DUIs, or just being Latinx.
The problem IS the sheriff. Arresting innocent people is the problem. Nearly 75% of people in Maricopa County prisons are AWAITING TRIAL. https://t.co/OM0Uvp7ncr
Calculations show that over 200,000 prisoners pass thru Maricopa County prisons each year. Arpaio was in office 24 years. Do the math! https://t.co/AsNoua4NU0

@SilverSummerSun Hi! I do live in NY but am a third generation Arizonan. Sometimes NY can be an echo chamber, but I'm very connected to my family back home.
@unuthryear found like five articles about this in three seconds		https://t.co/syhbD6M1Rk
I hope you can tell that I'm genuinely just scratching the surface. For each tweet, there are hundreds of thousands of people who suffered.
I'll just pull this one straight from Wikipedia because it's just so succinct and horrible. https://t.co/eT6W6WdVoD
When inmates sue, it's taxpayers who pay for Arpaio's defense/settlements: more than $140 million since he was elected.
Inmates who give birth can't see their babies. Pregnant inmates are served rotten food, contaminated water, &amp; get no prenatal vitamins.
Wrongful deaths in Arpaio's prisons are terrifyingly high as evidenced by thousands of lawsuits &amp; over $43 million in settlement claims.
Let's also not forget when Arpaio staged his own assassination attempt, costing Arizona taxpayers $1.1 million.
His prison's conditions were found inhumane and unconstitutional ten years ago. That's just who Arpaio is.		https://t.co/ePuGnk3sf8
Arpaio put American Flag stickers are in every cell and if they were ripped or defaced, inmates were punished with a 7-day bread/water diet.
Arpaio also plays patriotic music over the public-address system and all prisoners are required to sing along.
He was known for playing Christmas music TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY during holiday season for over a decade. (He recently decreased it to four)
Arpaio's prison officers use racial slurs against Latino prisoners and punish prisoners for not speaking English.
Arpaio's focus on immigration offenses keeps officers from responding adequately to allegations of rape, assault, and sexual abuse of girls.
In raids, Arpaio dictates that all Latinos on the scene be arrested, regardless of whether or not they're on the warrant.
He's called "Tent City" a concentration camp. In his prisons, inmates receive criminal medical care, examples here:	https://t.co/u3h8eWkRho
He believes jail is about humiliation. He pushed for ALL mug shots to be posted online, and has male inmates wear pink underwear/handcuffs.
He reinstated chain gangs, including for women and juveniles.
He also created "Tent City Jail," army tents for prisoners NOT YET CONVICTED OF A CRIME. In summer, the tent would reach 145 degrees.
Women (particularly Latina women) are denied sanitary items, forced to sleep or sit in their own menstrual blood.
His inmates are only fed twice a day. No meat, no salt/pepper. Meals cost the gov't 15-40 cents and inmates must pay $1 to eat them.
As an Arizonan I've heard horrific stories about Arpaio all my life. He is one of the most racist, evil men alive. Here are some examples:
