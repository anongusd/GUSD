@azstudigital @NBCNews @NBCLeftField Again, it's not a "fad". To call it that is to disparage all those with Celiac disease. They wouldn't call sugar-free or products for those with diabetes a "fad" because it is not a "fad".  Gluten-Free products and foods are a necessary for a great number of people everywhere.

@PleaseStandByUS @NBCNews @NBCLeftField Exactly! They have been calling it a fad for a while now. They obviously don't understand nor care that it's an autoimmune disease. Guess diabetes is a fad too? You think a news source would be better informed.
@NBCNews @NBCLeftField Celiac disease is not a "fad", it's an autoimmune disease. It's like saying diabetes is a fad. Clean up your copy, @NBCNews  - you should do better.

@JonNoel5 @NBCNews @NBCLeftField Those with Celiac Disease cannot tolerate gluten from wheat, barley, or rye. It's a common misconception that those with Celiac Disease are able to tolerate wheat products from Europe.
@NBCNews @NBCLeftField Not sure who is writing your copy but "gluten-free" is not a "fad" but a medical necessity for many people. You should know better.

@BuyDirectUSA That means he is feeling better. That is a good sign.
@BuyDirectUSA That is so cute!
@BuyDirectUSA Our Edward had a tooth removed last month. Because he was pain free, he would eat too fast and not hold the food down. (Second time this happened.) So, we have to put his food on different dishes to slow him down. It's such a balance. He doesn't like it we are not home either.
