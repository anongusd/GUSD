Meanwhile, I‚Äôm hearing from South Carolina farmers who are worried about going out of business and families who need certainty and support. My constituents have suffered enough and shouldn‚Äôt have to wait any longer.
Americans impacted by last year‚Äôs natural disasters are being used as pawns. House leadership has held disaster funding hostage in the last two spending bills. It is unacceptable to put the millions of Americans struggling after last year‚Äôs natural disasters on the back burner.
H.R. 8 takes no steps to prevent criminals from acquiring firearms yet criminalizes law-abiding gun owners trying to protect themselves and their families.
Dem extremism was on full display last night. Many Dems opposed a measure that would notify ICE when an illegal immigrant tries to buy a gun &amp; threw their support behind a gun control bill that undermines the 2A.

If you take one thing away from this: if you're trying to figure out how much $$ you saved on taxes this year, compare your tax liability year over year, not the size of your refund!
If you like ice-cream (&amp; ice-cream puns), and have questions about your tax refund vs. your tax liability, this video is for you:		https://t.co/6a2FLkyOcV https://t.co/NauWV6RY2a
The size of your refund doesn't tell you if your tax bill was higher or lower. A smaller refund means you kept more of YOUR money that you worked for every pay-period instead of sending it up to bureaucrats in Washington.
Some of my friends across the aisle are missing the mark when it comes to tax reform &amp; refunds. Let's clear this up. Your tax refund reflects how much you overpaid in taxes during the year. It's not a bonus check, it's a return of the money you loaned to the gov interest-free.

I wanted to take away the guessing and provide people with a degree of certainty during an otherwise uncertain time. The 2018 Natural Disasters Tax Relief Act creates an automatic 60-day tax deadline extension after a Presidentially Declared Disaster.
Hurricane Matthew made landfall in South Carolina just a few days before a tax filing deadline. Hurricane Florence hit us in the middle of a tax filing season. My constituents have had to deal with this uncertainty more than once.
Can you imagine worrying about a tax deadline when you don‚Äôt know how a natural disaster will impact your home, your family, and your community? https://t.co/1pos2591bx
Unbelievable that Dems would shut down the government again to release criminals into our community, handicapping law enforcement &amp; endangering their own constituents. They're out of touch with South Carolina. They're out of touch with America.
"Over 90% of ICE's arrests are aliens who have a criminal conviction, have been arrested for a criminal offense, or have been previously removed."
Note: "Approximately 72% of ICE's current detention population is subject to mandatory detention due to the alien having certain convictions or having committed certain acts."
That's right- they are demanding a random limit on how many illegal immigrants can be held by the federal government. Anyone over this cap, even those with criminal records, would be released into our communities.
I didn't think Dems could get more extreme, but I was wrong. Their latest demand in border security negotiations? An arbitrary cap on the number of beds in immigration detention centers. 		https://t.co/dFwzwU5gym

I cannot believe this would be celebrated in the United States. It is unconscionable. In the State of the Union, President Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to ban the late-term abortion of babies who can feel pain in the womb. We‚Äôre already getting to work.
In NY, they actually lit up the One World Trade Center to ‚ÄúCELEBRATE‚Äù the passage of a bill that allows abortions to be performed right up to the moment of birth. In VA, the gov advocated for a bill that allows abortion to be performed when the mother is ‚Äúabout to give birth."

Instead of offering the same doomed bill 11 times, Speaker Pelosi should come to the negotiating table. President Trump put forward a good faith proposal rooted in bipartisanship. While it certainly isn't exactly what I wanted or what Mrs. Pelosi wanted, it is a starting point.
Instead of participating in meaningful negotiations, Speaker Pelosi wasted time bringing the same sham bill that includes $0 for border security to the House floor. It's time for her to work with the President instead of against the American people. Enough is Enough.
Today, @HouseGOP voted to pay federal employees while we work to reopen the government and secure our border. Before deciding to go home early for the weekend, 215 Democrats voted to deprive federal workers of their pay.
Democratic leadership should spend less time working against President Trump and more time working across the aisle to address the crisis at our southern border and reopen the government.

This is a political game to them- and they're playing to win. But they're playing with the lives of people in South Carolina who are hurting and need our help. It's time Democrats come to the table to provide disaster relief, secure our border, and reopen the government.
Democrats they made the disaster relief bill subject to opening the govt. w/o border security by adding a CR to the bill at the last minute. The added CR was a poison pill that ensured that an otherwise legitimate, bipartisan bill won't be considered by the Senate or @POTUS.
I even offered an amendment to this bill that would have streamlined the rebuilding process and helped people get back into their homes as quickly as possible.
Democrats' shutdown tactics reached a new low today. The House considered a bill that would have provided disaster relief funding for South Carolina, and surely would have been signed into law once the Democrats decided to stop with their games and reopen the government.

Democrats have said time and again that they are for ‚Äúborder security.‚Äù They should prove it by supporting a bill that will help secure our border, provide critical disaster relief funding, and keep our government open.
The border wall will help stop the flow of illegal immigration that is hurting the economy &amp; endangering communities across the country. This funding bill reflects the priorities of not only #SC07, but the entire country.
Securing our border is a matter of national security and a matter of life and death in the Seventh District. Law enforcement officers have attributed the 150 opioid overdoses in our district last year to drugs coming across our porous borders.
Many of my constituents are still recovering from Hurricane Florence and this funding is critical to helping the Seventh District rebuild. I will continue to assess the unmet needs of our district and ensure we have the resources for a complete recovery.
The House just advanced a spending bill that includes $7.8 billion for disaster relief and $5.7 billion to secure our border.

The straightforward approach suggested by the Trump Administration will provide much needed certainty, return authority to state and local entities, and promote responsible management of our nation‚Äôs water and land in accordance with the Clean Water Act.
Farmers were no longer able to plow their own land or became tied up in jurisdiction disputes that took years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve - it was the predictable result of such a massive government overreach.
It was a power grab of epic proportions that subjected South Carolina farmers, landowners, and small businesses to onerous rules &amp; costly requirements. At the time, I heard concerns of many constituents whose fears turned into reality across the country.
The @EPA and @USACEHQ proposed #WOTUS definition is welcome news in #SC07! President Obama's regulatory-happy EPA expanded the federal govt's regulatory authority from "main waterways" to all bodies of water, even on private property.
I would like to thank Governor McMaster for his lifesaving actions during the storm and his commitment to the people of South Carolina during the recovery process. We will continue to work together to ensure a strong, complete recovery for our constituents.
Additionally, I am glad the Governor has asked the South Carolina delegation to find a way to fund I-73 as an emergency evacuation route. Improving our outdated infrastructure is critical to enhancing our disaster preparedness.
In #SC07, we are facing a long and costly recovery from Hurricane Florence. Governor McMaster‚Äôs request for additional CDBG-DR funding will ensure we can help as many people rebuild as possible.

I-73 will help mitigate the life-threatening impacts of future disasters and provide the lifeline we needed during Hurricane Florence.
Hurricane Florence highlighted the need for an adequate evacuation route for the Grand Strand and I'm fighting for it! The storm put 250,000 of my constituents at risk of being completely isolated from the rest of the state with no access to food, water, or medical supplies.
Part of living in the beautiful state of South Carolina is preparing for natural disasters and part of our responsibility as government officials is ensuring we are doing everything possible to improve future disaster mitigation and response efforts. https://t.co/URyJllxLrd

Just as American families and businesses must operate under a budget, so should elected officials and the federal government.
The federal budget deficit is now almost $800 billion and today's bad choices will fall onto the backs of the next generation. Reducing each Member's Representational Allowance by 5% is a doable way to save millions of taxpayer dollars.
Fiscal irresponsibility has become the status quo in DC, and it‚Äôs past time for us to take action to rein in our reckless spending habits. .@realDonaldTrump asked his Cabinet Members to reduce their budgets by 5% and today I asked .@SpeakerRyan &amp; .@GreggHarper to follow his lead. https://t.co/mG97UwzkFk

In addition to cementing in the benefits of pro-growth tax cuts, this legislation will encourage American innovation and help families save for the future.  Tax Reform 2.0 will build on the economic momentum that is creating new opportunities &amp; lifting people up in #SC07.
Today, the House voted to make tax cuts at every level permanent and lock in tax relief for small businesses, which will provide certainty and support long-term growth.
Now, less than a year after tax reform was signed into law, our economy is booming- unemployment is at a record low, consumer and small business confidence are at historic highs, and wages are growing at their fastest pace in nearly a decade.
When we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it had been 31 years since our tax code had been reformed, causing America to fall behind our global competitors and hurting our middle class.
Tax Reform 2.0 is about changing the existing mindset in Washington. Instead of allowing decades to pass by without implementing economic reforms, we are actively working on policies that will create prosperity for workers, families, and businesses. https://t.co/Cq4oEqGAsC

While the total damage we will sustain from Hurricane Florence is yet to be determined, it is clear that federal funding will be necessary to rebuild and recover.

For the first time since 2008, the economy's estimated economic potential was revised upwards and the nonpartisan CBO is predicting that #GDP will reach 3.3% in 2018!
@WaysandMeansGOP is examining how the positive impacts of #taxreform have dramatically improved America‚Äôs economic outlook in the 5 months since the bill was signed into law. #Taxreform provided the kick start our economy needed after sub-2% growth during the Obama years. https://t.co/rf9PYpPOkN
