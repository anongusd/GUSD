Steve Chapman's column today is "Trump &amp; The For Profit Presidency." I won't read him ever. Judging from the title, it's a slam piece. Please note, that Obama was flat broke in the 90's, worth about $500k in 2007,  and is now worth $40m. Take note Mr. Chapman; that's your hero.
@BreitbartNews Why? She is such. Some poor slob that made love her has to look at her on TV as well. That poor bastard. I'll bet he calls her a bitch too.

@mitchellvii @peanutbutterisg RINO/boozer that left his 1st wife &amp; kids high &amp; dry in the 70's. I'll bet his mission was compromised by his blood alcohol when he was shot down. He liked/drank with Ted Kennedy; that says it all.
@joncoopertweets He honored McCain's final wishes; he also lent the family AF-2. Gracious by most standards. Call a spade/a spade; McCain was a boozer back in Academy days. His mission was compromised by alcohol in his blood when he was shot down. He came home; caroused &amp; left wife/kids. JAGOFF!
@realClintonM614 @CheeksGrammy Combine that with his drinking; maybe he was hungover when he got shot down. In any case, there is a ton of tarnish on his "hero" image.

Dateline Chicago: 60 shot/10 dead in another "wild, wild, west" weekend. No worries though; Rahm and his Aldermen are all fine. Rahm had plenty of police at Lalapalooza protecting the suburban white kids that paid big $$$ for tickets, hotels, &amp; restaurants.

Jimmy Carter taking shot at POTUS Trump? The 2nd worst, and weakest of all of our presidents has the audacity to even open his liberal mouth. We should get a portrait of Carter &amp; Obama that says NEVER AGAIN!

@chelseahandler You are a bitter person; we are winning. Hang on, it's going to get worse. If Trump was like your hero Barry, you would have quite the IRS issues. Be happy, that won't happen until the 2nd term.
@jeepsuzih2 @thebradfordfile Totally off topic; 1) what bathroom does "she" use? 2) was "she" in Orange is the New Black? 3) if "she" cut her hair and grew a mustache, "he" might turn "it's" husband on. Ref- Larry Sinclair.
@seanhannity @Warrior4Victory Sean-Lil Jimmy is that guy that runs his mouth at(in) the bar...wants "to go outside." Then, when you get outside, he suddenly isn't so aggressive but after he sprints to his car, he flips you off as his car speeds off. Been there/seen that.
@RealJamesWoods @JeffreyGuterman Yes, it's the Trump supporters that need to get a grip; the "left" is always on solid moral ground. WTF?
@BreitbartNews Setting aside our political differences, how cheap was that dye-job? Wow, you look ridiculous. For people to take you seriously, you might need to change that.
