Left ,but he didn't. The next day they were like buddies, because by the grace of God a storm hit and cancelled his flight.	But we want to fix this so bad, he left 2 months later and we were told he could come back legally. We are still waiting.
I appeared on television many years ago, to say that we should give the people that are already here a # to identify everyone. Our system is so backwards.	The officers left my husband at the airport. That is how much of a creditable man he is.	They left him! There he could have https://t.co/GThKqJqm3X
Of deportation. We also applied and received his legal work permit to legally work in the USA, also a legal social security card, his. A legal drivers license.	A good work record making America beautiful. Even had a DOT approval to Drive his work vehicles.
I am for boarder control and legal Immigration, this is why my husband is not here now. We tried so hard. He was detained and let go the first time and he did not go to the west coast to the hearing, which none go I fear of deportation.	So he received an automatic order....
I get that you don't want law breakers, and neither do I. 	My husband, like many immigrants cannot just go and get a visa like us Americans. 	My husband is a good family man not a criminal. He did enter the USA without inspection over 13 years ago.... https://t.co/GThKqJqm3X

Immigration reform is NEEDED!	So I can get my Husband back!	This is not fair! 	How many families are seperated besides mine? How many immigrants cannot fight for the right! 	May God give me the voice to be the voice 	for ALL families that are being RIPPED APART by this! https://t.co/PRzjSsx9ni

First of all, can someone get this guy spell check!!!	 Idiot!	 It is spelled weeks, not weaks! You are the president you can't even spell!! 	You said you were going to get Mexico to pay for this stupid wall! You are the ONLY on that wants this stupid wall!!! Here is an idea...... https://t.co/7EKdNezqIh
No this is not what happens sometimes! You did all of this! 	You single handedly put America in this position! You act like it is not a big deal! Probably because you don't know what it is like to struggle!	You reap what you sow!	This is not a show, it is time that you go! https://t.co/YoappKwxbz

Another day I wake up without you by my side, I wish I never let you go.	It was like we had NO choice you know.	They know you are a good man, I am doing everything that I can.	How I miss you every day. All we can do now is pray.
Good morning America! God bless you all!	Stand strong, we don't need a wall!	how about a bridge instead, 	Baby, it is so lonely in my empty bed.	Immigration reform we need, I love my husband indeed.	How I wish you were here by my side, just like old times, oh what a ride!
Now I lay down to sleep, I pray to God my soul to keep. 	To God in heaven I pray, to please wake me another day.	All things are possible to those who believe, give me the strength to go on, as I try to achieve, to fight this fight. Help me Lord to make this right.	Amen good nite

My one true love, when you think of me,	 just look to the sky above. You will always be my true love. https://t.co/pIuiz0oq0C

We almost had it all, then someone had an idea, let's build a wall, big and tall. 	With no thought at all, how many lives would be affected by this silly wall. 	As far as you and I, today, like every day,	 I cry, I cry because you were the joy of my life.	Now I feel nothing but.
Every day I wait and I pray that we will be together again to my husband, I love you so much! 	We almost had it all! 	I am so sad without you! I wish my prayers come true. Te Amo mi amor por siempre.
