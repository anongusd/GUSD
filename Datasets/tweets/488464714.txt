@SebGorka You are so bizarre..please come back to us from wherever you are!
@sam_vinograd You are not even close.	Your comments are bizarre.
@BreitbartNews No way!
@VanJones68 You were great at CPAC!
@RashidaTlaib wow...the proof of not being racist is being able to disagree with women and muslims...
@SecPompeo You're awesome man!
@jonkarl +2,864,903 popular vote for Hillary Clinton.....not the " over 4 million"	you mentioned on Len &amp; Michael 710 radio! https://t.co/phWyUS06WY
@MarkSimoneNY Amen brother
@AOC Your advocating against Amazon is so hurtful to the people you profess to help.  Making Amazon move out is way beyond foolish.  Please come back to reality.  You can't continue to operate outside the real world!
@GeraldoRivera Wow, you're missing this one by a mile!
Long Island, NY
Saw you on Fox...You're awesome! 	Love Ya
@jenzzzzzz Glenn Crawford Lavey
@IlhanMN New York Democrat Donald Trump....just sayin' https://t.co/v6GI4XOsKP

@IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump Just sayin' https://t.co/9blYU7AzkW
@ninaturner You're awesome lady!
@KamalaHarris Couldn't agree with you more! 	Universal background checks are a no brainer.
@AOC Just one death at the hands of an illegal is too many!
@GeraldoRivera @RepAOC Agree with you my friend.
@thedailybeast @AOC Just listened to Fox news clip.	You guys are missing it by a mile!
@RealSaavedra @JKCorden Good rebuttal.  We still need to change our present system.  Including special interest influences is just plain wrong.
@JKCorden I really like that you speak "your truth" to power.  Your questioning was very good, although the point just stated the obvious.  Unfortunately, this has been our system (Rebs. &amp; Dems) for ever.  We need term limits.  No retired Congress should be allowed to lobby.
@TamiaDBooker I've been very into you and Canidate Booker.  Not into this tweet at all.
#cnnsotu
@CapehartJ On MSNBC you said how great Mr. Shultz was by ( Deed ).  How in the world can you knock him now.
@TharonJohnson You're a good man!
@TharonJohnson Saw you on CNN.	Agreed with you completely.....
@IngrahamAngle Love Ya
@RepAndreCarson Heard you on CNN, you're a good man!
@CoryBooker Saw you on "The View". Really liked what you said and the way you said it.  I'm having a problem with your actions during tha "Kavanagh" hearings.  Do you regret the way you treated Justice Kavanagh?
@KamalaHarris Do you regret the way you questioned Brett Kavanagh?
@RepMiaLove Rep. how did we lose 3 billion during the shutdown?
@TheJuanWilliams Please get a grip!
@RedTRaccoon I wish someone would have stepped in and smacked everyone of those kids!
@allinwithchris @RashidaTlaib Dems not involved at all?	You are so patently unfair it's amazing!
@RepKatieHill @RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr @RepAOC @RepKatiePorter @RepUnderwood @RepSusieLee Maybe he's out building the wall!
@RashidaTlaib @RepMaxineWaters Wrong again my friend!
@RashidaTlaib @JasonLeopold Very wrong again my friend!
@RashidaTlaib Wrong again my friend!
@NoCopAcademy @BYP_100 @AssataDaughters @BLMChi @ForThePeopleChi Wrong again my friend!
@JoeNeguse @RashidaTlaib Wrong!
@jjz1600 @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN Wrong!
@kilmeade I love ya man...	But 15 secs. given to Pres.Trump possibility asking Cohen to lie to Congress....very disappointing for Fox News....you are supposed to be Fair &amp; Balanced!
@jeffjarvis Heard you on MSNBC this am. You lose any credibility by the way you present your point of view!
@kwilli1046 Wow!
@maziehirono you are so partisan - onesided...we will never get anything done.  Please come back to reality!
@crampell someone punches you and your answer is don't retaliate because they will get really mad at you!
@crampell sorry...you drive me nuts.
@kathygriffin 5head!
They travelled 2,000 miles.  Why not caravan to ports of entry?
@60Minutes Great coverage of a horrible policy.....but why do you call Donald Trump "Mr." and not President Trump?
@SamChampion You're Awesome Man!	Miss Ya........
@alisyn_camerota Love Ya but taking exception to Teresa Shook's concerns is bizarre.  If her co-chairs befriended  some type of white supremacist group you would be appaplectic!
@TeresaShookWM You're 100% correct!
@TheJuanWilliams 91,000 lost or uncounted votes....maybe 30 to 40 boxes of votes?
@tylerperry Please run for President!
#@JoeMSNBC Listened to you this am.  Your assessment of President Trump's motivations toward the Saudis is so bizarre!
@JoeMSNBC Listened to you this am.  Your assessment of President Trump's motivations toward the Saudis is so bizarre!
@joelockhart would you please filter your ridiculous partisan comments through the fact that there was no corroborating evidence found to Dr. Ford's accusations.  Judge Kavanagh was falsely accused!!!
@ChrisCoons Thought I liked you.  Now that you got what you wanted, (FBI investigation) your comments today are bizarre!
@SenBlumenthal Having lied about your military service, you should recuse yourself from the Supreme Court issue.
@AndrewGillum Sounded great today on Morning Joe....
@CNNPolitics Wow...a scuffle broke out at a college bar!
@smerconish You're awesome man!	A breath of fresh air.....Thanks!

@aliciakeys "Thanks-I love you too"
@RealPhilRivers Saw you on ESPN....	You're awesome!
@LenBermanSports You're the best! Thank God Schnitwitz is gone. Mike Readle outstanding....
Jake-President Trump was joking when he hoped the Russians could find Hillary Clinton's lost emails.  Get real!
@morningmika I'm begging you to PLEASE report the news.  Stop filtering, spinning, running every news story through "get Trump".	I used to love you guys but you have completely lost it!
@JoeNBC I used to love you....but you have completely lost it.....some day you'll look back and say "what the hell was I thinking about"!
@POLITICBROS The civil war has started!

@greggutfeld You're awesome man! 	Please pressure the Fox management to get rid of JUAN Williams.  He's turned into a complete moron!
@FoxNews Management needs to get rid of JUAN Williams....The Five!
@TheJuanWilliams YOU'RE RIGHT JUAN....	LET'S HOPE THE N.KOREA DEAL FAILS!
@TheJuanWilliams You've completely lost it!
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Great question....makes me sick....	NRA Swamp - just another Trump flip flop....
@PressSec You're awesome-Love ya!
@MichaelEDyson agree with you.  Saw you on CNN
@MayorBronin wow...you're missing it by a mile!
@LenBermanSports Show is great....so much better with Mike Riedel.
@KatiePavlich Well said!
@foxandfriends Great idea!
@ChrisCuomo Wish you would sit back and watch your (CNN) programs.  You've become so one-sided.  Every issue is filtered through your obvious bias!
@davidgregory You are so one-sided on every issue.  Please come back to reality.
@jaketapper Wow.....I'm starting to really like you!  You have been a breath of fresh air.
@MarkSimoneNY Wow...that's so bad!
@KatiePavlich Love Ya but please don't defend bump stocks..

@SHSanders45 - Would you please stop calling people by their last name.  It is disrespectful.
@nikkihaley Love Ya....FP = Future President!
I'm an Independent - I watch 	CNN,  FOX NEWS and MSNBC	in equal amounts.	You guys have lost it completely! 	Your hate for President Trump has 	made it almost impossible to watch your network.
Sorry my friend but you've turned into a complete ass!  A 2x illegal alien	Kills someone and you can't see why that's a tragedy!
Love Ya man....a breath of fresh air.	Wish other media people were as open, fair and balanced as you!
#MorningJoe I used to be a big fan.	You guys have lost it completely!
@smerconish Once the trial is over and the defendant found guilty the judge now speaks for the "people".
You look great!
@LaraSpencer can't believe they have not promoted you to a more visable position on air.  You're awesome!
@KatiePavlich watching you on 	"the five" you're awesome!
How unbelievably bad is it for the GOP to back Ray Moore because they need his vote....so hypocritical!	What has happened to integrity!
@nikkihaley You are just plain awesome.  Please run for President ASAP!
@KellyannePolls: Wow you're not being sincere with Chris Cuomo. 	Still love ya but can't we please put what's right ahead of partisan politics!
