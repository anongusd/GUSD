We also need an overhaul of our Immigration. SECURE THE BORDER &amp; REDO OUR IMMIGRATION.
If it comes to it, I say we pass a C.R. to Feb. 22 and do a big border security bill. Drones, Steel Barrier, and enhancing port of entries.
@SpeakerPelosi let's build the the Wall in some areas and then we can place our tech in other places.
When Dems are thinking about $5.7B on BORDER SECURITY BUT NOT THE WALL, it is bogus. Dems won't give this President one victory.
When the Senate votes tomorrow, I hope some Dems have the guts to vote for the #TRUMPPROPOSAL. REMEMBER, we need 7 Dems. 53-47.

This Year, we should reduce the debt and get serious about spending. Will we? Probably not.
Fiscal Year 2020's Budget Process begins in 2-3 months (should be sooner). Does it matter? No.. Dems don't care. How did we get here?
We should bring our troops home. However, we need to keep increasing defense spending.
