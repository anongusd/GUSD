@TM9skillz @SkySportsNews @Laporte Not saying that he should all of a sudden take one of their spots but if The French National team gave him a chance to show his potential I’m sure he would be outstanding, of course Varane and Umtiti are better because they have more experience with the team.
@SkySportsNews @Laporte has been an amazing defender for Man City and is showing why he should be in the French National Team.

@EliasAhmed2002 @brfootball No it’s ok 👍🏻 but yeah I agree Pep looks like he’s more concentrated on the Champions League
@EliasAhmed2002 @brfootball I don’t think so they are doing good business and there way of playing always beats Pep’s style of play
@ManCityMEN City NEED a midfielder and a decent one to challenge for the title again
@EliasAhmed2002 @brfootball That what I’m saying if they beat us with the players they had last season then this season with the players the bought they will for sure challenge for the title

@PeleHedgehog @nikegbite @nigelhoar @City_Watch Fernandinho is getting old and I think Pep really used him a lot last season with no real back up player for him. Kovacic is more of an CAM than a CDM
@PeleHedgehog @nikegbite @nigelhoar @City_Watch Now we just gotta hope that City can buy Kovacic! But still think Jorginho would have been a better option 😫
@ChampionsLeague @ManCity  https://t.co/AkJeTZFJfQ
@nikegbite @PeleHedgehog @nigelhoar @City_Watch But that wasn’t the issue he enjoyed working under Sarri, yeah Chelsea offered more money but the Napoli president gave him an option, he choose to follow his old manger
@City_Watch Good signing but competition will be tough to get into starting lineup. I think we needed Jorginho more than Marhez but I can’t complain great addition to the club
