@charliekirk11 @AOC This is a fallacy. Property taxes and income taxes are two different things.
@RepHartzler @RollingStone This coming from people that claim that Dems wish to put illegal aliens first, and that Dems show more loyalty to Central and South America. It is is not hate speech to speak bad of America or it's government. It is not bad to speak ill of Israel. It is bad to speak ill of Jews.
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Statistics from DHS, and the Bureau of Prisons disagree with everything you just said.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Are you really helping them back into civilian life if your getting them into a position even more dangerous than before?
@realDonaldTrump Hey here is something for you to look at. https://t.co/w4Egho9Do7
@GOP @GOPChairwoman It is called a recession. Black unemployment is heavily effected by the state of the economy. We wont know if the GOP has done a thing for Black unemployment until there is a recession as a result.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump A report from DHS shows more illegal immigrants leaving the country as of 2011 and this trend has continued. The population of illegal immigrants has shrunk as a result. If it is anything it is not a crisis.
I once said it was a conspiracy to have your competitors at war. Saudi Arabia and the US take out their oil competition with war to stifle their economies, transportation of goods (oil), and make themselves rich https://t.co/hApGXqPDFw
@Jim_Jordan Americans voted in Dems in the last election. Would you not agree that this is what they want then?
@JohnCornyn Is this a viable solution at 300 to 500 million per a structure? How long before it would pay itself off? The products made from it are they going to cost more than what we already have? I am not against it, but price will be the ultimate decider.
@GobAbiertoBOL @JohnCornyn What does a wall have to do with carbon emmissions
@realDonaldTrump I will leave this right here and note that this was piblished before the Vietnam summit. Kim and Trump are such great friends.	https://t.co/XzCLpHvjpq
@GOP @IvankaTrump Sounds like another scheme to cut so called "entitlements"
@Jim_Jordan It looks like he disagrees with you on every point and brings up valid points.....imagine that
@GOP You guys are against anything that helps the poor, but for anything that helps the rich. You have votes in legislation that lets companies deny class action lawsuits, ended Net Neutrality, tried to cut or end what you call "entitlements", and blamed them for the deficit.
@realDonaldTrump Weren't you two pals?
@nprpolitics Maybe she should quit?
@atrupar Does Trump really think that a wall will stop rape that happens in Mexico?
@charliekirk11 Since Trump was so successful with NK and they are "friends" of Trump here is something you should read. Note that it is dated Feb 1, before he went to Vietnam.	https://t.co/XzCLpHvjpq
@charliekirk11 The 2nd claim is shaky at best and the guys making it are shady at best.	https://t.co/2BZ1NzOiNU
@Fox48Fox @RoKhanna I know this is a "conspiracy theory" with no real backing, but I think this was part of the reason for our wars in the middle east. War takes your competitors out of place and the US and the Saudis are the world's biggest producers. It also inflates the price of oil.
@ILCitizen @kathyand37 @GOP Obamacare had two major problems. 1. It was a subsidy to insurance industry. 2. It did not address insurance discounts (a market failure that is a major cause to rising healthcare costs)	Even with these problems it addressed a discrimination issue with pre existing conditions.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You and @GOP are great with copy and paste. I see some version of this false claim every couple of hours.
@GOP I dont agree with it either, but the GOP is doing absolutely nothing about healthcare costs. If anything you blame it on doctors (who have little to do with it) and overlook health insurance discounts, which is a majority of the problem.
@GOP @VP So we should not be worried about Oligarchy? If we give to much to the rich that is what we get. Not only did some businesses pay no taxes, but then they turned around and asked for billions in tax returns.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Please share this to the guy who came home from probably his first ever trip to Vietnam https://t.co/XzCLpHvjpq
@mmpadellan He has already talked about punching people in the face so I doubt it.
@KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump Something that makes absolutely no sense about Kim not knowing about it is that it happened after his admission of guilt.
@IngrahamAngle Oligarchy has the same result.
@PrisonPlanet So one doctor represents them all?
@SenTedCruz @CPAC Start by being actual conservatives
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This is just propaganda. If you look at the unemployment rate for women it follows the state of the economy. We wont know if Trump did anything for them until a recession.
@jsolomonReports Did anyone here read this? 37% say credible, 39% undecided, 25% not credible.
@Blunted517 @NBCNews How do you know she is a terrorist?
@GOP I dont necessarily agree with the "Green New Deal", but unlike you at least they are trying to do something. You are absolutely doing nothing about market failures, and that is what regulation is supposed to address economically.
@GOP @VP Please look up what an Oligarchy is
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So your going to hold Democrats to a higher standard, but not yourselves?
@CR_HIATT @brithume @steph93065 Has nothing to do with the Presidency? So conflicts of interest with a hotel in Moscow, and being involved with the DNC leak has nothing to do with that?
@WhiteHouse @BetsyDeVosED @SenTedCruz @RepByrne The last I checked the education credits paid a % and not a dollar amount. So the parents that spend 50k to send their kids to a private school get 80% covered as does the kid going to a school for 2k a year. Just another subsidy to the rich.
@cdarkall @spaceottobot @Disco42duck @WhiteHouse @BetsyDeVosED @SenTedCruz @RepByrne Change that to regulated privatization and I will agree with you.
@CR_HIATT @brithume @steph93065 Cohen has evidence for some if not everything he said during his hearing. Even if you refute Cohen, how do you refute the evidence?
@esaagar @DailyCaller We could say the same of Oligarchy
@CR_HIATT @brithume @steph93065 You know that the whole Trump family flipped on him to right? So only one can be lying.
@GOPLeader Yawn, prove it
@realDonaldTrump You came back with nothing and you have no cards, because you said you would not stiffen sanctions. Your just making sure that you have a place with no extradition treaty to run to.
This video aged well for @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/YTo5G8V0a5
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP This is a fallacy in the making. You take two unassociated things and make them sound like they are the same.
@2coBenedicto @AOC She has a minor in economics.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So your complaining about some backwater news outlet that most have probably never heard of. Meanwhile the White House and GOP serve up #FakeNews daily
@NBCNews I think we poked the Bear
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Its meaningless because it is easily refutable.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You could say the same of your family, the RNC, and the GOP. The difference is Cohen has evidence.
@rainrainbow66 @DonaldJTrumpJr I like how Hannity leads the question as well.
@HuaweiFacts I will accept facts about you from 3rd parties. Especially since we knoe some chip manufacturers have put rogue chips on motherboards
@Anthony_DSmith @HuaweiFacts You mean what the US did, and Snowden revealed?
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump His leaked 2005 tax return does not shed a favorable light on him and I doubt the others will. Also, his 2005 return was never checked against the things Cohen mentioned. Although I don't think Cohen was working with him then.
@pradeepraturi1 @realDonaldTrump So this didnt happen? https://t.co/B2TLxTGu1t Note that the article was published before he testified before Congress. To top it off how did he win the RNC primaries if he had the RNC backing if he did so horrible in the polls?
@pradeepraturi1 @realDonaldTrump I dont know what he has proved wrong....
@GOP He walked away with nothing, but did not up sanctions. Just showing he had no cards to play. He also tried to shed a favorable light on a man who has said he would nuke US soil and allies. Is this because he is setting himself up a place to run to without an extradition treaty?
@JackPosobiec @DavidCovucci I see this on both sides. Conservative outlets do the same thing, and your doing the same thing they are by villifying left media outlets. Your also creating the victim mentality that many speak against.
@BreakingNLive @JackPosobiec There are an average of 20 hate crimes a day according to FBI data, where is the media on that? Basically what's your point?
@45SuggestionBox @JamesOKeefeIII If twitter deboosted this post why am I seeing it?
@chrislhayes No special treatment but you got moved to front of thr line. Haven't we heard this before about something else?
@realDonaldTrFan The troll is real with this one.
@GOP @EPA You could not find a scientist to be the EPA head....Oh wait they disagree with you
@IvankaTrump @GOP @USAID This is a real problem outside the US, not in it. However, it is good to see you helping others.
@Stephen97785070 @ChatByCC @DonaldJTrumpJr The long term capital gains tax has been around for years. Trump lowered it by 5%. The corporate tax was lowered to 21% from 34 or 35%. To use this loophole you just need a good lawyer. Yes they all used them, but anything Clinton did does not justify what Trump does.
@act_america @DonaldJTrumpJr Is that why the US leads it?
@GroverNorquist Unless your going to show data that they came out ahead of last year, this is just propaganda.
@GOP @IvankaTrump So your not subsidizing farmers, because of a trade war? Just because Unions rejected AOC's deal does not mean they embrace the GOP either.
@mr_toadmeister @mikeo188 @GOP @IvankaTrump Conservatives are literally running toward Oligarchy which has the same result.
@present_enough @DonaldJTrumpJr Really, because last I checked Pakistan and India are not exactly friends
@PatriciStr @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/pJrLI8Ve2g
@act_america @DonaldJTrumpJr Looks like the UN taking an anti terrorist stance
@DrPaulGosar Yawn, you need to tie Hillary to whoever leaked that she was investigated. That has not been done, so it looks like she was just cleaning house.
@GOPoversight Setting my record player to repeat....
@DonaldJTrumpJr Wasn't this guy mentioned in Cohen's testimony? I mean I could be wrong as I haven't had the chance to listen to the whole thing yet.
@ChatByCC @DonaldJTrumpJr That is a lot of hypocracy talking about moochers. The Trumps have been mooching off taxpayers for years by evading taxes, and recently by giving themselves loopholes with the #GOPTaxScam
@DonaldJTrumpJr How do you know that the Pakistanis and others were not warned also? Last I heard twitter was deleting suspected terrorist accounts?!
@JohnCornyn You are debatably right on almost everything you said. The infanticide is an outright lie.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump If Trump comes back without NK's nukes or saying the sanctions are back on, no one has to wonder which side he is playing on anymore. He is simply cuddling up to dictators, because they don't have extradition treaties with the US.
@GOP @Jim_Jordan If that is his only defense it is a flimsy one at best
@LouDobbs @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump More distraction from the Mueller investigation
@realismistrue @billiescentaurs @IvankaTrump Dont understand? I understand that somehow when you say "Demo Speak" that, that somehow nullifies everything even though it does not have a point.
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump The estate tax is for above 10 million and is less than 1% of all estates. I would be all for getting rid of it for business if those that inherited it didnt just sell it off.
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump Yes they pay more of it. 10% of a billion is more than 75% of 50k. Tax free government bonds would not be needed if they were paying the same effective tax rate. Why are my taxes required to pay them interest? Why are they entitled to more of every dollar everyone else makes?
@realismistrue @billiescentaurs @IvankaTrump Also, the fact that you call it Demo Speak means you dont really have a point.
@realismistrue @billiescentaurs @IvankaTrump Nice assumption. Never doubted that writing a book was not criminal.
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump How is the effective rate irrelevant? So your saying the rich are entitled to more of every dollar everyone else makes?
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump About the estate tax, if I receive any money that has had taxes paid on it already (even if it was paid by someone else), I should not have to pay it again. So no one should be paying taxes.
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump Long Term Capital Gains tax of 20%, Corporate Tax Rate 21% (they would just need to consult a lawyer to use this loophole).
RT @FPWellman: @GOP This is some big accusations. I was wondering if the RNC is doing an investigation into why you guys made and kept him…
@GOP So did Cohen did an about face, did you, or both?
@realismistrue @billiescentaurs @IvankaTrump I will repeat it for you. 95% of the money Obama made while in office was book deals....hardly criminal.
@realismistrue @billiescentaurs @IvankaTrump I cant speak for them all, but if your referring to the money that Obama made while in office...95% of it was from book deals.
@xtc43 @krisgeorge84 @IvankaTrump The rich do pay most of the taxes, but they do not pay the highest effect tax rates with the loopholes provided. The people recieving money from an estate did not earn that money. How can you steal something you did not work for or earn?
@NBCNews Will hamberders be served?
@Renee72112172 If you read what I said I never mentioned AOC, but thanks for making it about you.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump He is not breaking Attorney-Client privilege if he is being asked by a court of law to testify, because he is not doing it voluntarily
@GOP @realDonaldTrump For one their nuclear facility had a problem, and two they have what they needed from previous tests. If they are not giving up the missles they have then nothing was accomplished for the US, we just gave NK what they wanted.
@Reuters Lol, so this in response to a Russian troll farm being taken offline?
@LisPower1 @AOC We can start with the child in the White House @FoxNews
@IvankaTrump Obviously you have never talked or lived amoung the poor on government assistance. Most of them do work. Also, it is ironic you mention taxes. Donald got rid of a lot of things that those in lower income brackets would deduct from their taxes or lowered those amounts.
@charliekirk11 @IvankaTrump @AOC You mean like corporate America? They are not paying for taxes and turn around and ask billions in tax refunds. So who is getting the handout?
@PatriotJay73 @charliekirk11 @IvankaTrump @AOC I guess your okay with handing it to big business instead. Those same businesses that are not paying taxes are asking for billions in tax refunds.
@politico Isnt this the piece of garbage that keeps making passes at AOC?

@RyanAFournier Let me know when Trump is a member of Jeep's board of directors or works with them directly. This is propaganda at best.
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @DanaPerino @USIP This is very vague and in one part sounds like it is encouraging surgical strikes as well as CIA hits. Two things that have been proven to fix the problem are education and equality. This won't fix anything, it might make it worse.
@brianschatz Were you reading this for @realDonaldTrump? I heard he loves story time.
@WaysandMeansGOP Most are withholding less but get a smaller return, so did they really pay less taxes?
@RepAndyBiggsAZ You can start by repealing the #GOPTaxScam. Let us know when your done subsidizing the rich.
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems So you never lied Jim? We should believe you?
@GOPLeader @GOP all of you are saying the same thing to get your base riled up, does not make it true. BTW, nice use of copy and paste.
@realDonaldTrump Yawn, another lie. They voted on a bill to give mother's the right to abort a baby if the mother's life is in jeopardy or the baby won't live, nothing about after birth.
@DiamondandSilk Hospitals are having trouble because Medicare is cutting the amount it is reimbursing all the time, but they cant say no to them either.
@GOP @RepKinzinger #FakeNews is also a security threat
@mmpadellan The weird way of doing sex is @700club Pat Richardson trying to get his creepy old man self on.
@housebudgetGOP People are bringing home more in their paycheck, but getting a lower refund. So are they really paying less taxes. Mean while, if we go off Trump's leaked 2005 tax return he saved between 20 to 35 million. The rich got tax cuts (permanent). The rest got breaks (temporary).
@Axlsmom100215 @MrAndyNgo The 400 are over a 5 year period and the 7000 for a one year period. Like someone else said, 1.1%
@Jim_Jordan So we should continue to let the crazies shoot up the place?
@Jim_Jordan Have you ever looked up voice recording laws? The only state that you need the other person's permission is Texas.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I have an anonymous account, because I have received to many death threats.
@WhiteHouse I expect a defection.
@GOP The only problem with ACA is it did not address market failures and was an insurance industry subsidy. Premiums on ACA rose slower before you defunded it. Also, medicare for all is a bad idea as you will see areas loose doctors because it does not even cover the cost of a visit.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @GOPChairwoman Easy to do when you make political donations tax write offs.
@stevehosid @grailsnail @GOPChairwoman Are you an economist? Even Thomas Sowell said that a fair tax cut for all groups would help the economy the most. Also, do you know what the Laffer Curve is?
@GOPChairwoman It is addressing a market failure in the health insurance industry that @GOP is not even attempting to address. Capitalism must be regulated or it becomes an Oligarchy.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump So does Oligarchy.
@washingtonpost I smell hypocracy. Before it is over I bet US troops are sent there by a draft dodger. @realDonaldTrump
@surecantpickem @HuffPost I believe it was 1.5 trillion. The corporate rate is 21% it was around 37 to 39% before. The long term capital gains tax was 25% it is now 20%, so that CEOs can pay even less taxes on their bonuses.
@HuffPost So if the refund is lower, but they have more in every paycheck....did they actually pay less taxes?
RT @HuffPost: Americans are continuing to see their tax refunds nosedive with the average payout now down by double digits according to the…
@JackPosobiec Maybe you should try and find the tweet she was referring to. I haven't researched it myself, but since it is such a big concern for you, you should. If it has a shred of evidence you should open an inquire into @senatemajldr https://t.co/x3C9W9ENGf
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I wonder if he will defect
@GlennKesslerWP This is like when Trump says a wall will stop rape that happens in Mexico. Seriously, is the rapist going to tell himself that he cant rape because of a wall hundreds of miles away? It is the same of human trafficking. The thing that should concern us is they are being sent here.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TPUSA The video your talking about it is hard to even tell what is going on.
@seanhannity Fox does the same thing with not covering the guy from the Coast Guard turned terrorist. Also, I don't think there was a word about Trump from Smollett. Thanks for making it fit your narrative. You make it sound like hate crimes are made up when the FBI says they are increasing.
@politico He will probably defect
@FAIRImmigration @news5wcyb He entered in the country on a work visa in 2016 and then overstayed	https://t.co/e3DUw3bbVB
@GOPoversight @Jim_Jordan Lets see what he has to say first.
@charliekirk11 The US does not have energy independence when we imported over 10 million barrels of oil in 2017.
@charliekirk11 ISIS has been weakened, but our own military advisors said they could have a resurgence. We will see how that one plays out.
@charliekirk11 Taxes at a 60 year low? At what cost? A trillion dollars has been added to the debt. A higher debt means higher future taxes. The poor who got tax breaks (temporary) are being setup to pay for it, while the rich got tax cuts (permanent) to enjoy lower taxes.
@charliekirk11 If the Korean war is over why do we still have troops stationed in S Korea and at the border of the two?
@charliekirk11 The low unemployment has to do with the state of the economy. We wont know if we have done anything for specific groups until there is a recession and see if their unemployment numbers are higher than other groups.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Oligarchy is not the American Dream either.
@JudgeJeanine She didnt pay her boyfriend herself. Trump did pay Stormy Daniels. Also, note that Trump has his family running everything in Washington as much as possible. We see the same thing in mafias.
@benshapiro If you did a per capita of pollution the US is double the next closest country. There is a lot we can do. Also, as tech progresses solar and other renewable energies they will take over because they will become cheaper. Lets not mention that China is moving to solar already.
@GOP And Oligarchy is not oppressive?
@realDonaldTrump Does not matter the speed if it is slowed down to dial up speeds, because we ended Net Neutrality
@freefaln94 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Conservatives are running straight into Oligarchy. Just think about what has happened. Consumer protections are being removed, we have tax breaks for bilionaires and big corporations, we have tariffs killing innovation to save dying industries, etc.
@realDonaldTrump You put a tariff on solar to promote coal. You ended Net Neutrality and gave corporations the power to end class action lawsuits. Many people have poor utility service for this reason. You put a tariff on steel imports, when the US is the World's largest steel importer.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He should get a Trump *cough Tramp* stamp on it as well. That is what it is really all about, a vanity project.
@realDonaldTrump You mean what you do everyday?
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I think I may have to mute you. I feel like your a cheerleader on the sidelines for Trump. You don't really have a purpose except to sit on the sidelines and yell for your team, even if you dont know why you are.
@realDonaldTrump Does this mean we can get a refund on the wall when it does not work?
@CressMarko @jdrjbray @MpoppEileen @Education4Libs @Nikkki_R It is not his failed businesses that bothers me, it is his lawsuits. If even 10% of them are true he is no where close to honest. Most businesses fail within the first 2 to 3 years.
@jacks301 @politico @washingtonpost I would find you some if there was not a pay wall
@politico @washingtonpost you could say is left leaning, but I have definitely seen articles that support the right more than the left. This is what we call an attempt at unbiased reporting.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Bernie will destroy the left, just as Trump will the right. Most Americans do not support either even in their respective parties.	Also remember communism - socialism - capitalism - oligarchy
@LindseyGrahamSC @BetoORourke @realDonaldTrump Your post is arrogant in that you think all Dems support Beto, and all Repubs support your wall
@jdrjbray @MpoppEileen @Education4Libs @Nikkki_R So news articles on the subject are just made up as well?
@jdrjbray @MpoppEileen @Education4Libs @Nikkki_R A quick Google search would reveal to you that the only banks that with do business with him are ones that already are. Namely Deutsche Bank, not an American Bank.
@MpoppEileen @Education4Libs @Nikkki_R You could add the banks that wont even talk to him
@jasoninthehouse So you can prosecute this guy, but not Trump for the same thing?
RT @LindseyGrahamSC: Donald Trump is not a conservative Republican. He's an opportunist. He's not fit to be President of the United States.
@HermanSun3 @shaunking @NRA Since it is already thing and not mandatory how are people not bring sued or going to jail?
@Reuters History repeats itself. I wish I could say the US had a history of being a good ally.
@DiamondandSilk So there was not 3 bills that had bipartisan support about border security that went through Congress in the last year?
@matthew_wall @BBCBusiness It is because they feel it is their fault and are embarassed about it.
@shaunking Education has been proven to decrease violence. We need to have common sense gun reform. For example, make mental health reporting mandatory. This is something even @NRA said should be done. It wont be though, we have to many spineless politicians.
@WhiteHouse What we have already has been shown to work. Since 2011 more illegal immigrants have left than come to the country
@MarketWatch Maybe they dont need the tax incentive anymore because of a huge tax cut.
@GOP @SenJohnThune I would be more worried that you have already embraced Oligarchy with the GOP tax plan. You even had plans to cut taxes again for the richest Americans.
@trish_regan If you knew how labor economics works you might know the real reason they left.
@robertproehl @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump The fact that you can only call names, only means you dont have a point
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Because some people eat garbage
@Newsweek What the @GOP did does not justify what she has or will do. However, if Trump is going to hold to his words he would tale care of it on both sides of the aisle.
@Lisafox0877 @MKWyzlic @PoliticalShort @realDonaldTrump Lol, so I am a bot because you dont like what I said? I made my account private after someone showed up at my door one day.
@BetsyDeVosED @GovRonDeSantis Private institutions are not held to the same standard as public ones.
@staplesrusty @BetsyDeVosED @GovRonDeSantis Technical you are. They write it off against their taxes as a business expense. So they pay less taxes. This would not be a problem if we were not in debt. It basically means your paying mlre taxes in the long run to,make up the difference.
@MKWyzlic @Lisafox0877 @PoliticalShort @realDonaldTrump Your point?
@Lisafox0877 @MKWyzlic @PoliticalShort @realDonaldTrump The prison bureau statistics say they are 10 times likely to be a criminal, but 20 times less likely to be violent.
@realDonaldTrump Didnt you and the Clintons hang out at one time?

@JayHenryMarino1 @Jim_Jordan @RepCummings @realDonaldTrump What any of them did or did not do, does not justify what Trump has done or is doing.	Was the warrant on bad info when we know Trump Jr was working with Russians to get info on Hillary?	Was the warrant bad when we know that Roger Stone worked with WikiLeaks, Russians and Trump?
@JayHenryMarino1 @Jim_Jordan @RepCummings @realDonaldTrump You didnt even attempt to answer my question. Despite what they do they have to provide evidence. Also, was it not a Republican controlled congress when this started?
@NRA @RepMattGaetz BGCs don't amount to much if mental health reporting is not mandatory.
@JayHenryMarino1 @Jim_Jordan @RepCummings Prove that a cabal exists. I have seen a lot of Trump's most loyal followers mention it, but no proof or even an explanation of its existence. @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump We want the 11 billion back for a government shutdown.
@JackPosobiec That is according to Burr what about the other members of the committee?
@ScottPresler @DonaldJTrumpJr 1. Cut healthcare	2. Gave tax cuts (permanent) to rich and corporations, and tax breaks (temporary) to every one else	3. Wants to cut SS, Medicare, and Medicaid, and has cut food stamps	4. Wants to build a wall at PR and CA's expense	5. We can go on
@krassenstein The right always talks about the left running toward socialism. The right is embracing oligarchy which has many of the same results.
@sabufe44011 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @TVAnews I lived in the cloudy north. They had a solar farm and the local University had one as well. As for the south it is expected that not everyone will be able to use them. As the tech becomes improved upon coal will still be pushed out even in those areas.
@SteveScalise At least Dems are calling out their racist remarks instead of embracing them.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump @TVAnews You should go look it up. Solar has become cheaper over time, especially with improvements in tech over the same period. It does not matter what is done with coal if solar is cheaper. Everyone will move to the cheaper option.
@realDonaldTrump 6. The only regulation I have seen you kill off is those protecting consumers, families, and workers	7. The border issue is totally fabricated	8. Should I go on?
@realDonaldTrump 4. VA: I would not say it is doing great with vetrans committing suicide in the parking lot.	5. Your tax plan gave the rich huge tax cuts and everyone else tax breaks (temporary). Your taxing blue states more and setting up the poor to subsidize the rich
@realDonaldTrump 1. Depleted Military: How can,that be when are military spending was already higher than the rest of the world.	2. Endless Wars: Your move in Syria may cause a resurgence in ISIS. NK is not keeping its deal. Russia and China are going unchecked
@PoliticalShort @realDonaldTrump DHS gave a report showing that more illegals are leaving the country than coming in. Their population as a whole has been shrinking since 2011. Since what we have is already working, tell me again why we need a wall?
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump The crossings in Israel fell before the wall waa completed, because they hired more people to patrol it. So was it the wall or the people that patrol it having an effect?
@realDonaldTrump The part you have wrong is man made warming is scientific fact, the part you have right is we dont know how much we contribute to warming. That aside all of us want clean water, air, and food. Something you are against for your own profit.
@Jim_Jordan @AdamSchiff A double standard is that you would change your tune if it was Obama in the same situation
@realDonaldTrump With how the last election went you really think that you can win in 2020?

@GlennKesslerWP My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!
@politico @AOC I am not for whatever works. Carbon capturing and then burying it has been found to be very expensive. We should consider costs in these things. Solar is cheaper than coal over the long run and wind is almost there. As tech progresses green energy will only become cheaper.

@Jim_Jordan Did you forget about FDR's New Deal?
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS It sounds like you never talked to a Dem. Just like when only Mitch was negotiated with over a border wall.
@Jim_Jordan Where was this in the 90s when at least double the number were showing up at our borders? The crisis is over and has been for a while. More illegal immigrants are leaving than coming. The population of illegal immigrants has actually shrunk.
@realDonaldTrump Didnt the last caravan come to a legal PoE? Also, 12k is far less than those that are apprehended at the border. Not a massive number of people.
@BrandieSarah @GOPLeader @GOP Getting rid of regulations is one of the things that got us into the last financial crisis. The participation rate has not budged since 2009 which is a more accurate measure of unemployment. Cutting taxes only creates a temporary boost.
@BrandieSarah @GOPLeader @GOP Oh yes black unemployment. When you go to look at again go back over 20 years and look at the state of the economy. You will see that it follows the state of the economy. No wonder it was say bad during the Obama years. Btw, calling me a liberal just means you dont have a point.
@GOP Looks like creative video editing to me.
@DevinNunes Nothing the Clintons did or did not do justfies what @realDonaldTrump has or has not done.
@GOPLeader @GOP a more accurate measure of unemployment is the parricipation rate that has barely budged since 2009. The wages going up is more due to minimum wage increases, because lowest earners are getting raises. GDP and the market are rising due to corporate consumption (buybacks)
@RBReich It does not matter the party this happens. All political donations need to become illegal.
@LindseyGrahamSC Yes, your so confident of this you dont even mention one policy.
@Jim_Jordan This is just hype. An average of 50k illegal immigrants are apprehended at the border a month. Averaging out muder rates amoung them that is less than 1 for all of the immigrants trying to illegally cross. Sounds like a real crisis.
@EdwardAshton30 @Jim_Jordan Um start with proving that the deep state exists. Btw, use real sources, not some conspiracy site.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Not one word about a wall either. Maybe conservatives could be more than a #FakeNews echo chamber.
@realDonaldTrump I dont think he paid porn stars to keep quiet. Pot call kettle black. Also, what someone else did or did not do does not justify anything you have or have not done.
@VP @POTUS @DEAHQ Yes, I am sure it is a real crisis. Just like the last one. Wait what happened to the last one? I guess what happened with them does not fit your narrative.
@OvrCsUSApatriot @CNN @TheDemocrats @DHSgov @BPUnion I would like to see the DHS report your talking about since the last one I read showes more illegal immigrants leaving since 2011, and no need for a border wall.
@nypost As for the relying statement in this article. The US has been a bad ally in that arena for over a century. We were the last to come in during WWI and WWII, and so on. We can say well we saved Europe's ass, but we cost millions of European lives by not being reliable.
@zodiac_wolf @Jim_Jordan @RealMattCouch The brain is not growing it is changing, and it is going through changes well after the teenage years. This line of logic would mean no one could vote.
@fat18638 @pauline10580 @Jim_Jordan If convicted they cant vote
@realDonaldTrump All you need to do is open your mouth and let out all the hot air.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, the hypocracy
@realDonaldTrump Were there not complaints about this same thing and Muslim countries?
@Ddel1122 @Chippewa48 @ThePresObama @DonaldJTrumpJr Also anything @BarackObama did or did not do does not justify anything @realDonaldTrump did or did not do.
@Ddel1122 @Chippewa48 @ThePresObama @DonaldJTrumpJr Nixon took 7 years. Just sayin
@ericbolling If the headline was FBI agents killed would it change your mind?
@jasoninthehouse @FoxNews even if they all voted in the same election that is less than 1%. It is 0.36% hardly a crises or widespread voter fraud.
@realDonaldTrump A wall will stop crime and rape? You make it sound like a wall will make them stop. Your logic makes no sense.
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer It seems you have forgotten the democratic process.
@mattd546 @ArnettProject @Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Does not matter what he did or did not do. It is what he said he was going to do. Also, we are paying the tariffs not Mexico. Consumers pay the tariff not the country that it is made in. It is the same if we were to subsidize the same industries. We pay for it.
@JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump So we have GoFundMe's for the rich now? His net worth is around 5 million. I wonder what else it hets used for.
Good read, and goes along with what my own research has shown https://t.co/lamPh6fMyA
@LindseyGrahamSC Why do all the Republican senators sound like they are at pep rally?
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump I am starting to wonder if this is a bot. I see alnost the same response everytime some defends @realDonaldTrump. How is Moscow this time of year?
@realDonaldTrump Nice deflection. Do you always mention @CNN because they speak bad of you or because they speak the truth?
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi So @realDonaldTrump didnt announce to everyone her itinerary? Did he not tell her to fly commercial after he grounded her military flight. At least she stated hers was for safety concerns? What was Trump's about?
@LindseyGrahamSC #FakeNews
@davidhogg111 There are really only two kinds of people in this life....victims and survivors. I would like to think your the latter even if I dont necessarily agree with your politics.
@nytimes It must be those tax cuts and new loopholes.
@RepRiggleman @RobWittman #WhereIsMitch
@HuffPost Medicare for all should not even be considered until market failures are taken care of
@RepDavidTrone @realDonaldTrump A DHS report said we dont need a wall and it would be ineffective. It also said more illegal immigrants have been leaving since 2011. This is a fabricated crisis
What this was really about was changing a republican rule to stall investigations. https://t.co/TRIvZ6wOUx
Not a surprise. This is exactly what DHS said https://t.co/TrkCY7t2Gp
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ++ The video of Hoyer is nothing but creative video editing by @FoxNews
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump + So what this is really about is Republicans were stalling the investigation
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You should give the whole story on the rule change it didn't ask for any lawyer it asked for a specific one. "When the Republicans controlled the House, up until early January, a  lawmaker from the committee that issued the subpoena had to be present  for a witness deposition. "
@SenToddYoung @CoachLouHoltz88 Do all of the members of @GOP just copy and past this?
@DonaldJTrumpJr If all you can do is call names, all it does is prove you really don't have a point. Also we could say the same of @realDonaldTrump  with Kim
@JudgeJeanine Let us know when you give an example......
@KenCalvert This is just more political games for both sides. @SpeakerPelosi. Said when the gov reopens and wanted a date. @realDonaldTrump kept it on the schedule so he can say Dems cancelled it. Besides was there not talk of Trump having the SOTU in the @WhiteHouse
@senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Fair - in accordance with the rules or standards; legitimate.
@senatemajldr This is not a "fair" compromise when there has been no vote on bills from the House, because you are worried about a veto over ride that would place the blame for the whole thing squarely on @realDonaldTrump. The only bills you will let go to a vote are ones Trump agreed to.
@GOP Are you guys a parrot? I see this every couple of hours with slightly different wording.
@maggieNYT Cough *tramp*
@maggieNYT He wants it done by 2020 so he can get a Trump stamp on Mars.
@RepGosar You mean the wall that DHS said we dont need?
@NBCNews Wearing blackface to basketball games, yelling it is not rape if you enjoy, calling girls sluts, and a video previous to your stunt at the Lincoln Memorial give a totally different spin on your story.
@DailyCaller What's your point? You obviously call @NBCNews fake news already. Btw, your bias is showing.
@RealSaavedra @FoxNews I am thoroughly convinced that you do all of this for ratings only and care little for the truth.	There was a video taken previously, before what happened at the Lincoln Memorial, and it leaves no doubt to the character of those boys.
@Gmvdroid @RealSaavedra We already have that. It is called Radio Free America and PBS
@JudgeJeanine #WheresMitch. Trump vetoed 2 border security bills already. We have 6 being blocked by @senatemajldr. This is a hostage takeover on a made up crisis.
@BlazeTV @deneenborelli I didn't bother to watch it past 10 secs, because you did not state a fact. The border crisis is not getting worse according to DHS who said that illegal immigrants are leaving the country as of 2011. They even said it would not address other problems as well.
@Newsweek Why are we spending more on a problem that is already taken care of or cannot be handled by a wall according to DHS? Illegal immigrants were shown to be leaving the country as of 2011
@AOC The wealthy pay just above 20 to 21% for an effective tax rate. The next time you talk about tax history you might mention that there are taxes on literally everything to get the poor to pay an even higher effective tax rate, that did not exist 30 to 50 years ago.
@mmfa ++ This is the class warfare that has been going on for decades that you wont talk about
@mmfa + Then we added on taxes for literally everything. These taxes disproportionately effected the poor the most because they were paying more of every dollar they made. The rich do pay the most, but they certainly do not pay the most of every dollar they earn.
@mmfa Lets talk about tax history. In most of the earlier part of the 20th century the upper tax brackets were between 70 to 90%. Since then those taxes have been lowered.
@favAuntJulie @Pagemc03 @SpeakerPelosi Having read the studies and gone over this subject before....their (transgender) depression rates are higher than normal before treatment, but return to normal after treatment. This is what professionals say, and yes I can link studies if you like
@Jim_Jordan @OANN @NeilWMcCabe You said they are biased but led the @HillaryClinton investigation. They all must be really corrupt to launch the investigation the week after Comey was fired. This video makes no sense of your line of thinking.
@realDonaldTrump More BS, you never provide a source, because if anyone read it they would know your full of it
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How about you provide a link for your tweets, otherwise, I am inclined to think it is just bs
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Nope, that is the economy. People try to say @BarackObama had high minority unemployment, but if you look back at 20 or more years of unemployment you can see it follows the state of the economy. Fact is neither can take credit for it.
@EPAAWheeler @POTUS You are not even an expert on EPA subjects. Why should we believe you are on immigration?
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepBrianBabin @RepTedBudd @RepMGriffith @RepRalphNorman @RepGosar @replouiegohmert If you actually listened to DHS they already said a wall would be a waste of money. Illegal immigrants have been leaving the country since 2011. Why are we going to build a wall when there is no crisis, except the money laundering child/family camps.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/tG0AgohlIS the experts say otherwise. It is not above pre recession levels. Yes it is growing, but it is not roaring back. Also, production levels are low and is a bad sign for the sector. By certain metrics it has been coming back since 2009.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany There are six bills @senatemajldr is sitting on and not letting go to a vote. Trump already vetoed two previous border security bills. The only person Trump negotiated with was Mitch. Only the bills Trump wants will be voted on because of Mitch. Not a compromise.
@sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You mean the crisis DHS says does not exist, because as of 2011 more illegal immigrants are leaving than coming? This whole thing is manufactured.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Of course Mitch liked the idea. He was the only one that was negotiated with. Mitch wont let a vote happen on anything else.
@WhiteHouse A better measure of the unemployment rate is the participation rate that has barely budged since 2009.	African American employment follows the state of the economy if you look back 20 or more years. Nothing you did to help that.	No idea where you got the confidence measure.
@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump According to DHS the current system is already working as of 2011 more illegal immigrants are leaving than coming. This is a fabricated crisis. Open government instead of making it about not getting what you want @senatemajldr
@marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump They were offered something they were already given. The only reason this deal was offerred is @senatemajldr would bring it to a vote. None of the other bills have been because a veto from Trump would make him own this entire thing.
@CNN How can you call this Democracy? @senatemajldr has blocked bills. Mitch will only bring what @realDonaldTrump wants to be voted on, so that when it fails they can blame Democrats. A veto on Trump's part would only show with no doubt it is his shutdown.
@CNN @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr the only reason Mitch is blocking a vote is so Trump can attempt to blame it on Democrats, because he has not vetoed anything. The moment Trump vetoes anything no one can doubt this is an @GOP shutdown.
@audrey_boyette @josh_abplanalp @nowthisnews @AOC This a fallacy. Your taking one part and saying that it represents the whole. The KKK says it is a Christian group. Should we assume it represents all Christians? They are a small part of the whole. She said nothing of abortions either, so your off topic.
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump No @ChatByCC, the only thing they are against is immigrants getting a free ride. Neither side is for this, both sides are for legal immigration as well. However, only one side is listening to experts. For example, DHS itself said more illegals are leaving the country.
@realDonaldTrump @DavidWohl please provide the evidence
@realDonaldTrump + you gave the super rich and corporations tax cuts (permanent) and everyone else tax breaks (temporary). Your setting them up to pay the debt your creating while giving the rich and corporations loop holes and lower tax rates.
@realDonaldTrump 2/2 The market is up because of corprate consumption (stock buybacks. A quick look of the last 20 years of tax revenue and the state of the economy shows that tax revenue is heavily effected by the state of the economy not just the tax rate.
@realDonaldTrump 1/2 Cutting taxes only creates a temporary boost to the economy. This is why you have already talked about cutting taxes again. The participation rate is a better measure of unemployment and has hardly budged since 2009.
@realDonaldTrump Going to add another 11 million hostages?
@realDonaldTrump A DHS report says your wall is a waste of money. As of 2011 more illegal immigrants were leaving the country than coming in. Even DHS says we don't need your wall.	@GOP @senatemajldr @VP @WhiteHouse @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats
@Nappy_Snitter @julsbreakey @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump In no video or speech do you have a Democrat wanting to build a wall. All of them are gor border security. May we remind you that DHS thinks that a wall is a waste of,money as well. As of 2011 more illegal immigrants are leaving the country than entering it. This is manufactured.
@BBCWorld No matter what happens someone ends up getting taken as a hostage.
@BuckSexton No what undermines Democracy is @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr. Mitch will only let the senate vote on bills that Trump already agrees with and would never let a veto override happen. The right of the senate to vote is being taken away.
@Newsweek @realDonaldTrump already going back on the deal you made? You and @senatemajldr have ended Democracy. Until you get what you want Mitch will continue to block a vote that would override any veto by yourself.
@LindseyGrahamSC @GOP I guess this is how you think Democracy works @senatemajldr blocks anything you dont want to vote on, than you only vote on what @realDonaldTrump wants. Thanks for ruining democracy so much for @freedomcaucus
@Newsweek @realDonaldTrump looking at historical precidents the market will fall 10 to 20% when your impeached, but will quickly recover. The fall during Nixon's impeachment was more than likely over gasoline.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This a textbook example of deflecting. If you really wanted to compromise this would be asking how you can bring everyone to the table.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You can be a good example and start by holding the White House accountable
@PCrapidy @SenFeinstein How will this create a Civil War?
@realDennisLynch @AOC @RepJahanaHayes @KatieHill4CA @LaurenUnderwood Let all of us know what is so secret about the Constitution with @realDonaldTrump 's antics. Pot calling the kettle black. Your statement is so biased it is ridiculous.
@Jim_Jordan @RepClayHiggins @RepBobGibbs @RepRalphNorman @RepArmstrongND @RepMarkGreen @RepCarolMiller @RepGregSteube @RepChipRoy You can start by making @HouseGOP Republicans again. The political party I see now is not recognizable
@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @GOP @senatemajldr A DHS report says a wall would be a waste of money. This is because since 2011 more illegal immigrants are leaving than coming. Why are we dumping more money into a system that is already working?
@RudyGiuliani If this Hill article is so true why don't you provide a link? Maybe because even you know it is BS?
@GOP @VP We all know that you don't have the integrity to go and fix a problem. Instead, you will just place blame. The American people want to see problem fixers, not problem causers. We don't really care whose fault it is.
@DonaldJTrumpJr When looking for credible sources I look for two things.	1. Does it just link back to itself? If it does it is probably not a legitimate news source	2. Does it ever make apologies for getting it wrong? If they don't it is probably not a good source for anything.	#FakeNews
@realDonaldTrump I wont put links up to it again, but DHS statistics and reports disagree with your made up numbers.
@senatemajldr This is just deflection away from the shutdown that you are now the owner of just as much as @realDonaldTrump
@DonaldJTrumpJr That was to Vladimir's predecessor, and the person was @BarackObama. Most of what was sad was not heard and it was in an open space not behind closed doors like it was with @realDonaldTrump. Also read a fact check https://t.co/tkFRYpQZkr
@Jim_Jordan @GOP @senatemajldr You had the chance to accept 25B in Feb but @realDonaldTrump turned it down. No one saw a compromise on national TV just demands.
@SteveScalise I already shared the statics from DHS with @realDonaldTrump and @DonaldJTrumpJr that disagree with building a wall to fix these problems.
@RudyGiuliani If she wanted to fire him it is because he may have broken the law, not for convenience as @realDonaldTrump has.
@tmcgregorchina @nypost Source?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump They never supported a wall, barriers maybe, they have supported more patrolling though. Also, they wanted Comey out, because he may have violated a law, not convenience. They being Democrats.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You should really watch the whole thing. 	https://t.co/QJFIf7T7nl
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The US Drug Enforcement Agency disagrees with you. Most of it comes through legal ports of entry https://t.co/KKLC7GTFfj
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I wonder if a Russian bot is running this fake news train
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump It also looks like border security is already working according to DHS and is even discouraging from repeat attempts https://t.co/m4dvbM26Gi
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/y3roWpvtBs
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump DHS statistics dont agree with building a wall. https://t.co/QK7Gov7xGI
@DonaldJTrumpJr More fake news like @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/rboaw7e3cf
@DRUDGE_REPORT More fake news. https://t.co/rboaw7e3cf
@realDonaldTrump So they need a hard hit before pulling out yet they have been defeated? All your doing is creating a vacuum for Russia, ISIS, or something worse to fill.
@Newsweek @RudyGiuliani no there not God, but neither are you or @realDonaldTrump. Give a defense or evidence if they are not correct
@GOP @SenTedCruz You had the chance to get 25 billion toward border security funding in February and Trump turned it down. It even included wall funding. You are the crisis.
@Alewis569 @DavidAmerland @charliekirk11 One of the main causes to the Civil War was tariffs not to different from the ones @realDonaldTrump has put in place.
@marioparker2 @ThaToken @KyleSpieles @charliekirk11 The first generic of the EpiPen was just approved in August of 2018, before that there was not one. You were seeing a monopolistic price and not a competitive one. It may take time, but we should in time.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump So Trump didn't throw out the idea for 25 billion for a wall? You yourself say that you have a bunch of people guarding you with guns, but no wall. In Israel at the same time the wall was built they added people to patrol that border as well.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump The video is unavailable. I guess YouTube called it fake news
@Newsweek @DonaldJTrumpJr so we are comparing immigrants to animals in a cage now?
@GOP @VP Shutting down the government to get what you want is not what we would call a legislative process
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Statistics from the BOP and even The Daily Wire (a conservative leaning outlet) disagree with you. 		https://t.co/D1yX0KWOdP	https://t.co/ihROYWNQGr
@GOP Because illegal immigration peaked in the 90s not today. If you were going to build your wall then would have been the time to do it not today. @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC
