@utahsenate Is it poor people or just voters in general that you hate? asking for 50,000 friends.
The saddest thing in the whole HB96 "debate" is the fact that the @LDSchurch finds marijuana as a "moral issue," but not helping the poor.  I have about 2000 pages of scripture and 189 years of Prophets saying the opposite.
HB210 covers more people for less money, and doesn't need the federal government to sign off on it (because they already have). Yet the "fiscally responsible" @UtahGOP is willing to spend more to cover less to because they hate poor people and voters.

I mean, I know we've been asking the bakers for pancakes instead of chocolate cakes for a decade now, and the "new" bakers haven't agreed on pancakes for the two years they have been in charge, but trust us. /3
Besides, cake is right there in the name. Oh, and you only get the pancake if the baker helps pay for the pancake, despite the fact that the bakers has said he'll only pay for chocolate cakes. But, don't worry, we have it on good authority that they'll pay for pancakes now. /2
So, let's say you wanted a chocolate cake, and you got a pancake, because the person giving the cake said they "couldn't afford" chocolate cake. They are the same, because they have four, eggs, milk, and sugar. Do you think you got what you wanted? #utpol /1

@downrightdave @utahjazz Wally would end up living a few more years, and kept working his spot. He passed in 2015, just short of his 100th birthday. We did one last dance in his honor that season, and decided to retire the dance after that. /6
@downrightdave @utahjazz The dancers approached a few of us to take Wally's place, and we opened it up to any usher that wanted to join. Wally was well enough to "break out" of the hospital that night (much to our surprise) and joined us at the end of the dance. /5
@downrightdave @utahjazz Sometime around his 90th birthday (in 2005), Wally was invited to dance with the Jazz dancers. That became an annual tradition for several years. One year, Wally got really sick in January and was in the hospital for about 3 months. We thought Wally wouldn't live much longer. /4
@downrightdave @utahjazz When LHM died, Wally stood in line over 2.5 hours to pay his respects at the viewing, despite being told by several higher-ups that he could bypass the line. Even Greg Miller came to get him, and he refused because he was "regular people" and that was a regular people line. /3
@downrightdave @utahjazz He worked the player's entrance at the Salt Palace and Larry Miller joked a few times that when he was designing the Delta Center, he asked Wally where he wanted to stand, and built the arena around him. /2
@downrightdave @utahjazz The usher dance had a little history. Wally Price was an usher who started at the Salt Palace about the time the team moved to SLC. He took the job to give him something to do post-retirement from the postal service. He was in his 60s. /1

@MichelleLQuist @bbart76 Usually, for a bigger convention, we will require more of a deposit/guarantee.  But, between banquet space rental, food, and hotel rooms, $20k is pretty easy to rack up. My property has already hosted a conference in 2019 that just hotel rooms = &gt;$200K.
@MichelleLQuist @bbart76 Often, those contracts have a 48 or 72 hours cancellation, especially if it's a group that the hotel would want repeat business from such as a government entity.
@bbart76 I know that my hotel in downtown SLC has lost some business.  It's still relatively small for us, but we are one of the larger hotels.  I know of one smaller hotel in the valley that had a conference cancel to the tune of about $20k lost revenue due to the shutdown.

@gopTODD really?  I mean, it's a pretty blatant case of mixing religious influence with civil government.  It's also a pretty blatant case of a church dominating the state and interfering with it's functions.
@gopTODD Utah Constitution, Article I Section 4: "nor shall any church dominate the State or interfere with its functions." Doctrine and Covenants, 134:9 " We do not believe it just to mingle  religious influence with civil government." "Compromise" violates both. #utpol #prop2

@DrugSafeUtah "fact" 5) Under #prop2, if you are caught with cannabis between 1/1/19 and 7/1/20, you will still be cited/charged with possession as you are now. However, charges will be dismissed if you can prove to the court that your doctor recommended it. /2
@DrugSafeUtah 3 of the 5 "facts" on your home page are lies. 1) Even for those living &gt;100 miles from a dispensary still won't be able to grow in their homes. It's pretty clear in #prop2. 2) The limits on personal possession still apply, even in the home. /1

Even then, 2 years ago, we knew the Russians had hacked the DNC. We knew they had hacked the DNC to help Trump. What we didn't know about then was the meeting at Trump Tower with Don Jr. 2/

@gopTODD I figured that you spent a good amount of time yesterday defending the summit, you'd have some positive spin.
So, when Trump sat down with the North Koreans, we at least got a promise of denucularization out of it. Broken promise, but still something to walk out of there with. 		What did we get out of the Putin meeting? Anything? Maybe @gopTODD has an answer.

If you believe these conspiracies (I'm looking at YOU, @jasoninthehouse ), I have some land in west-central Tooele County to sell you.
It's like the people that point to WTC7 as proof that 9/11 was an inside job so that GWB could go to war with Iraq. Why wasn't WTC7 a focal point of the tributes? And why did bomb Afghanistan for 18 months before starting against Iraq, and make up WMDs?
So, the conspiracy is that an FBI agent hated Trump so much that he started a phony investigation to prevent Trump from becoming President, but didn't bother to leak it to a single reporter prior to Nov 8? Seems.... odd.

@carty64 the biggest store in the chain is blocks away, and carries nothing but Jazz. Gateway store has more Utes than Jazz.

Mitt Romney has based his whole political life on the fact that he was a successful businessman. Why can't we ask about his business history
@EyeOnUtah if he is still on record as CEO, than stuff that happened during that time is still his fault then. Can't have it both ways.
Why the Bain story is important: if Mitt left in 2002, hess been lying about it for 13 years. If he left in 1999, he lied to fed govt #utpol

Karlmalone and Donald Trump have something on common: they'll say something outrageous knowing that everyone is talking about them.
So, Karlmalone wants to coach the Jazz, but insists on bashing the people who run the Jazz. No wonder Karlmalone isn't with the Jazz.
@TySpace Karlmalone won't talk behind closed doors, because that's not how Karlmalone does things. @GregInUtah can't negotiate with himself.
Lets face it. Jerry Sloan retired. He was done. Had been done since at least late December 2010. I could see it in his face, body language.
And so everyone believes Karl's made up version and not the version from guys who were in the room. Unbelievable.
So, Karl Malone spots off the same bs he gave last year when he showed up with his scalped ticket, and the worst columnist in utah prints it

@mikebrice It took a miracle to get private clubs eliminated.  3.2 beer is a pipe dream....  ;)
@mikebrice Herbert's exec order was a comporomise with legislative leaders.  Imagine that, someone in the Senate lied......
@mikebrice override was unneccessary. Herbert issued executive order requiring go'vt offices to open on fridays, yet preserve 4/10 system.
@mikebrice In an ideal world, Utah gov't would be open 6 days a week for that reason.  However, we don't live in ideal world.  We live in UT
Tonight's special session cost Utah Taxpayers $240 per minute.  Not including resources for Bramble's police escort.  Great use of resources
@mikebrice I'm sure the number of people who work 9-5 is greater than the number who work 4 10's.
Utah State Employees now get to spend less time with their kids.  5-day workweek is anti-family.  Good job Legislature.
Well, once again, the Utah Legislature seeks to hurt working families.  Working people now need to take time off work to visit govt agencies
I suspect that tonight's override session is really a secret plot to show how good Gov Herbert looks compared to the @utahsenategop....

4day work week allows state agencies 2b open more than normal business hours, allowing citizens to access state agencies w/out missing work.

@elforesto If having kids in private school forbids you from discussing public ed, then not going 2 bars should mean you can't talk booze.

@jonrinehart Maybe Hayward and Evans could workout with Jeffers.  They need some meat on them bones....
@jonrinehart is it just me, or has Jeffers bulked up a little since the season ended?

@UtahProgressive Actually, Granato has come out swinging the past week.  He has only sent the noise to the press, not to the rest of us.
@UtahProgressive utdems have a strategy.  It's to be a "bold" as possible. You know, in backwards world where "bold" = "dull"

All these large #NBA salaries coming in already make me even more pissed about next year's work stoppage. Arena employees will suffer.

RE:|@realsaltlake but, with the number of ads i've seen 4 50% tickets 4 tomorrows game, arent season ticket holders getting screwed?
@RealSaltLake true. but having to pay full price meant you were half full, if that.  More chance to fill RTS if you charge less.

@TySpace every time they have to pull the voting machines out of the closet, it costs the state something like $1.5 million.
@TySpace a party is choosing a candidate, at taxpayer expense.
First post-election Tweet. Very Senatorial. But funny.  RT @mikelee2010: San Dimas High School football rules!
Remember when I used to have "guest posts" on my blog from my Card-Carrying Republican alter-ego? I'm thinking of bringing it back on Twiter
@FrankStaheli even your glass is only 13% full. Which is 87% empty. Which is sad.
@SamGranato We need to start defining @MikeLee2010 tomorrow! He has spent past several months defining himself. He is EnergySolutions.
