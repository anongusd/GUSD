(6/7) After NPR’s reporting in December, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., said he would hold congressional hearings on the black lung epidemic, saying “Congress has no choice but to step in.”
(5/7) By the mid-’90s, federal regulators knew miners were being exposed to excessive silica dust. They were urged to strengthen regulations. They didn’t do enough, then or since. 	https://t.co/D0ctNZjkKt
(4/7) Black lung is a terrible disease. As pulmonologist Robert Cohen put it, miners are “essentially suffocating while alive.”  	https://t.co/7DjxvZe7sE https://t.co/kXTorchEmU
(3/7) More and more coal miners were sickened, but the federal agency monitoring the disease missed the epidemic. From 2011 to 2016, federal researchers counted 99 cases of advanced black lung. NPR counted more than 2,000. 	https://t.co/lIqugH7THu
(2/7) Here’s how that happened: As the big coal deposits were mined out of Appalachia, miners had to cut through more rock to get to what was left. That kicked up silica dust, which is 20 times more toxic than coal dust.
(1/7) Decades ago, black lung disease declined sharply in coal country. Then it roared back. And this modern epidemic? It could have been prevented. 	https://t.co/7DjxvZe7sE

The guns currently can only be taken to one of a handful of shooting ranges within New York City. Depending on how broadly the court rules, the case could have wide ramifications for gun rights and gun restrictions across the country.
