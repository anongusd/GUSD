“We decided a long time ago that we would embody inclusiveness fully here in Portland, Maine. Nothing... that happens at General Conference tomorrow or anytime in the future... will change that. The question has been answered.” https://t.co/iIZjwbRIzm #UMC #GC2019 #LGBTQ
I received this from a colleague, and now I'm passing it on:	Hey preachers, be brave and strong tomorrow.	If you're a United Methodist preacher, please don't be ambiguous. People are listening, and they need you to be clear and precise. A lot depends on this.	#UMC #GC2019 #LGBTQ
5 //  Know this: Facebook &amp; Twitter outrage is not enough. Sitting back &amp; trusting that someday will come is not enough. Blaming international delegates is not enough. Agreeing to disagree is not enough. The current reality is untenable. Change has gotta come. #GC2019 #UMC
4 //  And once the days of lament and grief are past, it’ll be time for organizing. Allies, let’s step back and center the voices of our #LGBTQ siblings and POC but let’s not get comfortable, because countering the prejudice &amp; discrimination is our work. #GC2019 #UMC
3 //  We need to remember that it happened and acknowledge that the homophobia and hatred run much deeper and are more widespread than we’ve ever wanted to admit. We must not minimize the pain or deflect the blame. It’s time for serious self-reflection. #GC2019 #UMC
2 //  I don’t know what’s next, but I know we need to stay committed to never forgetting all that entire down: the violent words, the devastating votes, the callous disregard for passionate #LGBTQ cries for change, every last blow. #GC2019 #UMC
1 // You know what would be even worse than #GC2019? If we all just went back to normal and pretended like that $hit $how never happened. That would be worse because it’s the status quo, the comfort zone, the denial, the business-as-usual that got us to this place. // cont. #UMC
@wbarter1234 I hear you, @wbarter1234. I am so sorry for the ways in which this brings pain to you and to so many, even across denominational lines. No question, the ripples extend far and wide. It sucks. #GetItTogetherUMC #howlong #ashamed
This is not heroic. It's just about honoring &amp; celebrating the dignity, full humanity &amp; sacred worth of all persons, hard stop. I stand ready to be part of a movement that is faithful, loving &amp;  just. I will not be part of a denomination that continues to do harm. #UMC #GC2019
To state this very clearly once again, I will never ever sign a pledge of conformity, and I will remain in ministry with my LGBTQ siblings in all ways, including officiating marriages that unite two people in loving covenant as part of my ministry to all people. #UMC #GC2019

@ltkerner I think something new will be born out of the rubble. I hope our LGBTQ siblings and people of color will lead us forward. The status quo is untenable. It’s going to be messy and uncertain for a while. Something new and beautiful will emerge. That’s my hope.

"The Rev. Allen Ewing-Merrill, a pastor from Portland, Maine, pledged defiance of the Traditional Plan, tweeting: 'I will not participate in your bigotry, sin &amp; violence.'” Yeah, I said that, and I meant it.  #UMC #GC2019
That time when the AP picks up your tweet. https://t.co/PXyUn8bx7j  #UMC #GC2019
The optics here are horrible. LGBTQ folks and allies are in open revolt. There is deep, deep pain, despair, and hurt, and the talking heads on the stage are proceeding as if nothing has happened. I can't with this General Conference. I can't with the #UMC. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. #GC2019
I want to see the BISHOPS going &amp; standing with LGBTQ folks right now. They have a choice to make: side with the bigotry, homophobia &amp; violence? Or stand with those who are hurting right now &amp; pledge their support to live into something new, compassionate, and just? #gc2019 #UMC
This church can die. If we deserve anything at all, it’s death. #UMC #GC2019
Here’s my most honest thought about General Conference: This is no way to run a church. Truthfully, I find the whole thing repulsive and endlessly tragic. I kinda think God agrees with me.  #UMC #GC2019
In the words of Mark Miller, “We resist. We refuse to let hatred in. We rise up. We won’t back down. We’re in this ‘til the end.” #UMC #GC2019
If you are a student of history at all, you should know that movements of justice always win in the end. You may win short-term victories, but in the end, love always wins. #UMC #GC2019
To the authors, champions &amp; supporters of the Traditionalist Plan, let me say this clearly: I will never sign a pledge of conformity. You can’t make me. I will not participate in your bigotry, sin &amp; violence. I will continue a ministry of Biblical faithfulness. #UMC #GC2019
@rmnetwork I hear that + I hope you're right. I trust those who are making these strategic decisions. I'm not in St. Louis. I know that good + faithful people are laboring long + hard to strategize how to wade through all this crap as efficiently + faithfully + impactfully as possible.

@ru_thank @kikTonks During debate, someone called the question, and that passed by more than 2/3. Then they closed debate on the Traditionalist Plan and passed it on to the full body for vote tomorrow.
I took a vow to "resist evil, injustice, and oppression in whatever forms they present themselves." I will never sign a loyalty pledge that forces me to uphold oppressive practices and policies designed to do harm to #LGBTQ siblings. It’s time to resist.  #UMC #GC2019
General Conference delegates: I urge you to refer to it as the Traditionalist Plan, not the Traditional Plan — in conversation, at the mic, when talking with media, always. The WCA prefers Traditional, with good reason. Please resist. Be consistent. Language matters. #UMC #GC2019
Besides that, most of the other priorities relate to exit plans. Together, these determined priorities, which define the sequence of debate, do not signal promising things for #GC2019 or for the #UMC.
Yesterday’s #GC2019 vote is not a final decision, but it is a prioritization , and that’s difficult news to receive. It signals, “This one’s our favorite. Let’s start here.” It’s a kind of straw poll. A lot can change, of course, but it suggests more of the same for the #UMC.
4 // I think as an act of resistance, and really to speak the truth, delegates, observers, and journalists should be consistent in using the original term proposed by the Commission on a Way Forward: the Traditionalist Plan. Language matters. #UMC #GC2019
3 // Traditionalist, on the other hand, connotes a resistance to change, a paralyzing &amp; rear-facing force. #UMC #GC2019
2 // Traditional is an endearing word that calls to mind apple pie &amp; Grandma. Tradition is a component of our Wesleyan Quadrilateral. It’s friendly branding for a horribly regressive &amp; oppressive policy. #UMC #GC2019
Who can explain why we're now using the term Traditional Plan? It suggests the WCA folks somehow got their way. They’ve been advocating for the use of “Traditional” over “Traditionalist,” and with good reason. Tradition is softer, more palatable. #UMC #GC2019

How about you? #MEPolitics #MoralMaine #homecare #Yeson1 #Maine #Elections2018 #ElectionDay https://t.co/Y4Eajthopq
Critically important: Passing this referendum will send a strong message — a message that can't be ignored — that Mainers want universal access to compassionate home care for seniors as they age. #MEpolitics #Yeson1 #MoralMaine
Remember that if the referendum passes, the State Legislature will still have to implement it. When it goes to the Legislature, there will be an opportunity to advocate for changes to the pieces of the proposal that you think aren't quite right. #MEpolitics #Yeson1 #MoralMaine
As a person of faith, these justice issues matter to me: dignity for people who are aging &amp; people w/ disabilities; fair wages &amp; benefits for home care workers, the vast majority of whom are women, people of color, &amp; immigrants; and fair taxes. #MEpolitics #Yeson1 #MoralMaine
I’m voting Yes on Q 1, Maine's Universal Home Care initiative. I have studied it very carefully &amp; I understand the objections to it. I strongly feel the justice issues outweigh the objections. #MEpolitics #Yeson1 #UniversalHomeCare #MoralMaine https://t.co/v9b3SeP1wN

@CollinsWatch Fair enough. Last word from me: It’s not my style to assume evil motives, but I certainly honor anyone’s right to draw those conclusions. Thanks for the feedback! Let’s all keep pushing and protesting in our own ways. The issues are urgent and of grave concern. Peace to you.
@CollinsWatch I don’t disagree. Her record speaks for itself. I have called her out on many of these things &amp; will continue to do so. What we have seen from her so far is not good enough. On SNAP, we agreed. Here I am calling her to stand &amp; vote where she has said her heart is. Time will tell!
@CollinsWatch Perhaps so. I want to call her &amp; challenge her to be her best self, to lead with conscience &amp; compassion, to dig deep &amp; remember why she sought public office to begin with.

In DC today w/ @bread4theworld. Met with @SenatorCollins to talk about the #Senate #FarmBill and why #SNAPMatters. #Hunger is a moral issue. Any legislation that puts up barriers making it more difficult for people to access #food is immoral. Senate bill: good. #House bill: BAD. https://t.co/DwpyPYNfQp
Thanks, @bread4theworld. See you soon!
#Grace is the free gift of God’s #love that we do nothing to earn. But grace comes with a sacred responsibility to do #justice, love #kindness, and #WalkHumblyWithGod. No #PersonalHoliness without #SocialHoliness
God loves you infinitely. You matter to #God and God’s kindom. That’s intensely personal. But don’t miss that God also calls you to practice your faith in ways that bring hope, healing, liberation, and justice to those who are suffering. No #PersonalHoliness w/o #SocialHoliness.
Make no mistake: any #Christian faith that is completely self-centered, focused solely on me + #Jesus, w/o any focus on #compassion for those who are poor, oppressed, and marginalized, w/o concern for #SocialJustice, misses the point. No #PersonalHoliness w/o #SocialHoliness.
Heading to DC for the @bread4theworld Advocacy Summit &amp; Lobby Days. Visiting w/ Maine’s Cong.  delegation and/or staff tomorrow on Capitol Hill to urge them to preserve #SNAP &amp; support global anti-hunger programs. 		#BreadLobby #SNAPMatters #HandsOffSNAP #FarmBill #MoralMaine

@wilranney @mxbarclay Exactly. And what does it mean for the #UMC to claim #unity when that unity presupposes exclusion of #LGBTQ members of our body, who have been called and gifted for ordained ministry or who desire to make the commitment of marriage? Any such claim of "unity" is dishonest.
None of this changes my commitment to a #FullyInclusive #UMC or my conviction that everyone is a #ChildOfGod made in God’s image, #beloved by #God, called and claimed by God. But I am #grateful for the conversation and for my brother in Christ. #UMC #LoveIsLove #AllMeansAll

I know the concept of #protest is unsettling for some. I’m good with protest, but I always remember that pro-test means “testifying for” something. Pro=for. Anti=against. Pro-test = testifying for. When I protest I am always standing for #truth, #peace, #compassion, and #justice.
@KeithMcilwain I don’t even know what that means. But I wish you well, and I will continue to pray and act for justice. God’s peace to you.
@KeithMcilwain I don’t want to debate this ad nauseam. We see this very differently. I hope you have relationships w/ LGBTQ folks w/ whom you can share &amp; really listen to their experience w/o judgment. Our denomination has policies, but we actually don’t get to decide whom God calls and gifts.
@KeithMcilwain But surprise, surprise, there are many in our ranks, and they serve with passion and joy and giftedness, and their churches are thriving. And their “behavior” within mature, consensual, loving, monogamous, committed relationships isn’t an issue anymore than your sexual behavior.
@KeithMcilwain Some of the absolutely most gifted UMC pastors I know – mentors and role models! – are gay and lesbian, as are some of the most gifted and undeniably called young adults on the path to ministry. That’s just my experience. I am eternally grateful to God for them.
@KeithMcilwain Do you feel the same way when someone who is divorced asks you to officiate at their second or third marriage? Or when someone who is divorced seeks ordination in the UMC?

“Spirituality means to me living the ordinary life extraordinarily well. As the old-church father said, 'The glory of God is a human being fully alive.’”	— William Sloane Coffin	#WordsToLiveBy #spirituality
@KeithMcilwain I think we would agree about this. We would likely disagree about what constitutes a sin, and about some of the exegesis around certain texts. It seems to me we would do well to focus a lot more on our own sins and spend a lot less time and energy pointing out the sins of others.

@matthew_p_roy Money is not the problem. There is enough #Medicaid funding to cover the expansion well into 2019, and #Maine has a $130 million surplus at present. Maine voters have spoken clearly: we want our tax dollars to provide #healthcare for those left behind by our broken system.
@matthew_p_roy Correct. However, far too often the #Republicans in the #MaineLegislature take their marching orders from Gov. #LePage. He has been the primary obstacle at every step of the way. Do you remember those 5 vetoes after the legislative branch approved #MedicaidExpansion 5 times?
What we really need is #UniversalHealthCare or a #SinglePayer system, but for now we’ll take #MedicaidExpansion. It works in 33 other states, and none of the dire predictions and scare tactics have proven to be true. #Healthcare is a #humanright. #MEpolitics #Maine #justice
We can expect an appeal, of course, because Gov. #LePage is famous for trying to obstruct #justice when it comes to compassionate policy. But justice will prevail, because the law is the law. And soon we will have a new #Governor. #abouttime #MEpolitics #healthcare #votecarefully
Five times the #MaineLegislature passed Medicaid expansion, and 5 times Gov. #LePage vetoed it. No more. The people of #Maine have spoken definitively, and the Court has affirmed that this is the law of the land. 70,000 more Mainers will now have access to healthcare. #justice

@KeithMcilwain The Gospel does not change. The BOD changes quite regularly. Very often it has codified positions that we later determined were unjust, discriminatory, and oppressive. We have repented and apologized for these and changed our positions. BOD &amp; Gospel: not the same.
@KeithMcilwain I agree that the BOD reflects, in part, our current understanding / exegesis of Scripture. As such, it changes every four years. That's not debatable. It is an ever-changing document. But what you said was, "It's the Gospel according to the UMC, in a sense." I disagree with that.
@KeithMcilwain I do believe delegates take Scripture seriously, and while I've never been a GC delegate, I do, as well. Absolutely. I bring my understanding of Scripture to the table quite regularly. But I would never elevate the BOD to the status of the Gospel.
Wow. Who knew The Discipline is the gospel according to the UMC? #UMC https://t.co/roeZfAZf38

What is there to say, really, about a church that has the opportunity to pursue justice, compassion, and a grace-filled welcome of all, and chooses instead to willfully institutionalize practices that are antithetical to the Gospel? #bwcumc18  #UMC
With Bishops who cling to their consecration vows "to uphold the order and discipline of this church," rather than fulfilling their moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws, what we get is more deeply codified discrimination, oppression, and injustice.  #UMC #bwcumc18
With Judicial Council ruling last week, we are on the verge of another ugly battle which promises to be a repeat of #GC2016. All of the pieces are in place for a substitute motion or a petition to keep the discriminatory BOD language in place and tighten accountability. #UMC
In the words of MLK, “One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” The #UMC is perpetuating unjust laws. What we need, desperately, are Bishops willing to disobey unjust laws. #bwcumc18

Five years later, we've got 3 trash bags full of asbestos the Trustees tore off pipes, down in our parsonage basement. Sigh... #neumc

@mellanella @etobey01 The glass is 1/6 full. :-)
@GregorySmith7 You think? Exactly the same average worship attendance 17 years later?  That would be surprising.
Over 100 of our churches have higher average worship attendance than in 1995. I guess that means 530ish have lower AWA. #neumc

@elsapeters Basically because it was. That's a widely shared assessment. It's impossible to do this work as a global church. Also harmful.

@MarlaMarcum YES! Is there a list of their names somewhere? #gc2012
Sadly, her sentiments are felt by many, including (perhaps especially) LGBT persons and all who long for an inclusive church #gc2012
