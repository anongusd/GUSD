‚Ä¢It‚Äôs time to get back to the real issues. POTUS focused on infrastructure, HCR, improving economy, but media fails to give equal coverage
‚Ä¢The Left &amp; the media are using the Russia investigation to obstruct the President‚Äôs agenda. They are refusing to talk about the real issues
‚Ä¢And, Comey himself testified under oath on May 3rd that he had never been told to stop an investigation because of a political reason
‚Ä¢Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified in the days after Comey was fired that ‚Äúthere has been no effort to impede our investigation.‚Äù
‚Ä¢The public record is definitive that the President never obstructed an FBI investigation
‚Ä¢Many high profile Dems said they lost confidence in Comey . Their flip-flo to now criticize firing Comey is something to behold
‚Ä¢The testimony also confirms that President Trump did not impede or engage in obstruction of justice of the investigation.
‚Ä¢While investigating Clinton emails, Comey succumbed to political pressure from the Obama WH‚Äîfar worse than rumors about what POTUS said
‚Ä¢Comey has a long history of blatant contradictions and misstatements
‚Ä¢Former FBI Director Comey lost confidence of both sides of the aisle, and the president was justified in firing him.
