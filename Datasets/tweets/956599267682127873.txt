@realDonaldTrump 	In my last tweet about meds under Medicare prescription plans, I take all generic meds from Aetna.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  All cost $20 - $47 for a 30 day supply.  Pretty average as I understand it.  POTUS is working to lower prices.  Big pharma luvs $.
@realDonaldTrump 	Under Medicare, if you take expensive prescriptions or more than a few, you have to pay for a prescription plan separately.  Co-pays can be very high.  Mine run as high as $47 each for a 30 day supply.  Some are much higher.   Not inexpensive!
@realDonaldTrump 	Here's something Dems aren't telling you.  To get full coverage under Medicare, those covered now pay 20% out of pocket or buy private insurance.  Not that appealing, huh?
@realDonaldTrump 		Medicare has been paid for by workers and employers.  Making it available to everyone is ridiculous.  It's failing now.	Those who have never paid into it, or worked, haven't a chance.  They will ruin it for everybody and bankrupt the UNITED STATES!	Why?
