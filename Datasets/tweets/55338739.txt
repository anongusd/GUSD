Black women were not invited to Seneca Falls in 1848, and only one Black man‚ÄîFrederick Douglass‚Äîwas.	Black women were forced to march in the back of 1913 suffragist march on Washington, DC.	Black women and other people of color didn't have full enfranchisement until 1965.
Black women's suffrage clubs were essentially barred from the national women's suffrage movement under the guise that their membership would anger white Southerners.
The reality behind the suffragist movement:		White suffragists were actively opposed to the 15th Amendment because it "degraded" them to below the status of Black men. They also regularly used racist terms when talking about Black people.

NYCHA 2.0 is dedicated to serving the residents above all because they are the backbone of our city. This is not privatization. These are reforms to improve the residents' lives right now and in the future.
We're also starting NYCHA STAT, a program that's similar to COMP STAT and was championed by @BPEricAdams, which will track and release information about the situation at each @NYCHA development regularly.
We're also rapidly addressing five types of problems that affect residents in their daily lives. We'll cut the length of heat outages down to 12 hours by next year and cut the rat population in half by 2020 while also addressing lead, mold, and elevators.
@NYCHA These programs along with the new Section 8 Conversion plan will generate an estimated $16 billion to address capital needs at @NYCHA. With an additional $8 billion from the city, state and federal government, we can address up to 75% of NYCHA's capital needs in the next decade.
The Transfer to Preserve program will sell unused air rights at @NYCHA developments to make roughly $1 billion that will address capital repairs.
@NYCHA Build to Preserve is a program that will deliver roughly $2 billion for capital repairs through new developments on unused @NYCHA properties. And all of the new money will be dedicated to the surrounding developments.
We are expecting light snow tomorrow starting at 8 am. Forecasts predict half an inch of accumulation before rain starts around noon and continues through the evening. We're monitoring the situation, but plan to exercise caution on your commute and follow @NotifyNYC. https://t.co/c914S4DTe9
