Likewise, we call on the United Nations and all affiliated bodies to undergo much needed reform to correct their chronic anti-Israel bias.”
Block concluded: “Unfortunately, the UNHRC has failed in its obligations toward one nation: Israel. We call on the UNHRC to immediately abolish discriminatory Agenda Item 7.
The ‘report’ also ignores Israel’s extraordinary and unprecedented efforts aimed at avoiding civilian casualties.”
The ‘report’ maliciously covers up violent excesses committed against innocent civilians by both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
As part of its perverse strategy, Hamas sent civilians – many of them just children – to threaten Israel’s security and provoke the soldiers who defend it.
Israel, like any other nation, has the inherent right to defend its citizens from attacks and threats to their existence.
Block continued: “The ‘report’ falsely equates Israel’s defensive actions with deliberate acts of violence carried out by Hamas that forced Israel to take defensive steps in the first place.
What ‘investigators’ described as ‘unarmed demonstrators’ were, in fact, violent rioters carrying guns, knives, stones, explosives, and Molotov cocktails with the intent to breach the security fence and infiltrate into the Jewish State to commit terrorist attacks.”
Israel is the only country in the UNHRC with a dedicated council item.
“The ‘Investigation’ is the latest in a long series of hostile actions taken by the UNHRC, whose obsessive hatred of Israel is codified in Agenda Item 7 that is exclusively devoted to discussing alleged human rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza.
“The Israel Project strongly condemns the malicious and disproportionate report issued Thursday by the United Nations Human Rights Council on the State of Israel’s defensive response to violent Hamas-orchestrated Gaza riots,” TIP CEO and President Josh Block said.
