@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are a danger to the American people.  I hope your group comes to their senses and removes you from leadership.
@NancyPelosi not what your showing me. I see a traitor to the people only worried about lining your pockets and those that do your bidding.  You are the face of corruption.

@NancyPelosi @SenateGOP just wait.. they will soon ask for the impeachment of our new Supreme Court Judge.. Just another lie they will tell the sheep that follow them.  It takes a 2/3 vote to remove him.  We the People won't allow that to happen.  We are taking our Country back from the Corruption.

@realDonaldTrump Thank you for being a beacon of hope in these very dark times, my President.  Proof, Corroborated evidence, statistical facts, and our Laws are used to guide us back to freedom.  Not the heartstrings of fools.
@elizabethforma God save us all if you run for President.  You believe in destroying a mans life with no proof or witnesses.  I guess you're a peddler of fabricated lies, right? Since you seem to have an issue telling the truth about yourself.

If your so weak to stand up to these tactics then you should step down from office.  The burden of proof is on the accuser.. not the innocent being accused.  We are Innocent Until Proven Guilty.  DONT FORGET THAT!!!!
@SenateGOP , @HouseGOP You should not be sway by public opinion or feelings of someone's believability.  The only thing that should be focused on is facts. Provable facts that can be scrutinized and corroborated.
@CoryBooker Watch out, kids, this man will believe anything if it fits his agenda.   With no facts to support the allegations.  People like this need to be removed from office if basic rights are being denied. WE the people of the United States ARE Innocent until proven Guilty.
@TheCrone17 @tedlieu Scary people believe when no facts can be provided and all others she stated were there, say they have no recollection of it. Yet you believe. God forbid your ever on a jury.
@tedlieu Ford fly's on a regular basis. It was just a stall tactic just like the rest of these theatrics being played out.  I fear for my sons if this has become the new standard of our governing body.  The assumption of guilt is scary becoming the norm.
What happens to Equality?  No matter what color your skin, sex or religion you are your voice should not weigh more than anyone else's.  Allegations are proven with facts.  Should be no gray area in this. We are all innocent until proven Guilty.
@tedlieu that's really sad that you can say that at all.  She has no proof yet your so blindly accepting it as fact.  Facts can be proven and she cants prove any of it. You clearly should never have been elected to office if those are your standards. I fear for my sons more now than ever.

@OKane33Lysa @SenSanders @TheDemocrats actually .. she has been working on this for months.. She has lawyers and talked to news outlets. Ya.. it's not as hush hush as they said.  It was very well orchestrated and timed perfectly.  But please.. let your emotions and not facts sway your opinion.
@SpencerHayesPR @SenSanders @TheDemocrats I don't agree.  No one should be accused and raked over the coals when someone just accuses them of something like this.  We are innocent until proven guilty.  If you don't have evidence then you should shut your mouth.  At 15 she should remember something. She has nothing.
@fheckiostiem @RyanMarkHendo @BernieSanders God save us all if the Democrats get to dictate how much you're allowed to make when you create a profitable business. What would be the incentive if you have a government that will just rob you of your hard-earned money?  Its a trick just like medical coverage tax was.

@charliekirk11 YOU know.. this is really an amazing idea.  We could get everything that way.  He would be playing within the rules. He can open up everything so it all can be seen.  SO the true corruption can be traced back to its sources. And the people will finally know the truth.
@SenSanders I have never felt so angry toward a group of people.  @TheDemocrats theatrics has made me want to never ever support such a degusting group that would fling around such allegations just because you're not getting your way.
@SenSanders You, Sir, are wrong.  SHE needs to prove what she is allegedly happening.  I am a rape survivor. I know exactly where and when it happens and I was under the age of five. WE the PEOPLE are INNOCENT till proven Guilty. Sad that you have forgotten that.
@elizabethforma You are right. We should be teaching all men and woman of the United States how to use and defend themselves from those that miss use guns.  Giving us a fighting chance to protect yourself.  We do not need to have what is happening in Chicago all over the United States.
@elizabethforma Shame on you people.  I am a rape survivor. I was raped as a child from the age of 2 to my 5th birthday. Even at such a young age, I know details.  This woman is disgusting to try and play this game with someone life.  I hope she is held accountable for her actions.
@Education4Libs she is probably the real spy.. not the driver. she probably fed him the United States Secrets for all those zeros.
@DavidJHarrisJr Kavanaugh is innocent until proven guilty.  I look forward to them pick through her life and the proof of why she is doing this.  Its a vendetta against the Kavanaugh family. What a setup and the Dems are disgusting trying to destroy such a good man.
@tedlieu What happened to be innocent until proven guilty?  This is a setup and the American people should shun such stunts.  I look forward to her being sued for defamation of character.  She is destroying the voice of real victims with this fake allegations.

@SenGillibrand I loved Kavanaugh.  What was sad, how desperate and theatrical the democratic party became.  @CoryBooker made such a spectacle of himself it made so many people laugh at him for his poorly planned fake Spartacus moment.  He really is desperate for attention.
@tedlieu Cling to Obama .. soon enough we will know he is the head of the snake.  Please keep up your rants and trying to scare people.  When people look at the Democratic Party.. they will just see Communism trying to take over the united states with your fairy tale socialism push.
@tedlieu Yet credible economist that seems to be able to count confirmed that Obama had nothing to do with our current good fortune.  How about the FBI and DOJ are in bed together to take down trump with the Media Help. OOooo Loving these new texts from Strzok-Page messages coming out.
@SenGillibrand Kavanaugh was so inspiring. He inspires by his actions, not just the well crafter words he speaks.  He lives his truth and his devotion to his faith shines from his daily life.  We will be so fortunate to have such a wise and ethical person on the Supreme Court.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We already know what you want to do.. @RepMaxineWaters was just out talking about impeach, impeach, and impeach.   We don't need more Race Baiters or Communist in government.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Check out how Canada health care system works.  They pay huge taxes. They have to wait for 6 to 8 hours if you have a broken bone.  Or you can go and buy privet insurance.. yes.. pay the huge tax and still have to pay for insurance so you can get help when you need it.
@SenKamalaHarris I have to admit. I really enjoyed watching you and @CoryBooker make complete fools of yourselves. Please get more airtime.  We have not had comedy skits like this in years.
@tedlieu @CoryBooker Oh, Henny Penny the theatrics of his crocodile tears and now this fake illusion of him taking the risk just shows how phony and morally corrupt @CoryBooker is.   Does not help he also race baits and creates more separation based on color.
@MoveOn @Ocasio2018 Well, of course, she sounds good.  She is selling you a pipe dream. Also, she might want to pick up a history book of the Democratic party.  Check out Canada's Medical program.  Look into the truth, please.  Nothing is for free.
@marieballardmar @texpatnj @SenSanders Feel free to go farther down the thread when we were actually talking about this. You're a bit late Marie.   Have a wonderful day.
@marieballardmar @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders I don't think we are all Lazy.  You could work your ass off and not keep your money if you don't know how to invest, save, and learn self-control. No Hate at all, I'm sorry you took it that way. The destruction of family, education, values in our nation create this environment.
@DavidJHarrisJr I would say driving people from the state but they have already done that. We are being invaded and watching our friends and family move out of the state because it's almost impossible to live here.
RT @EdithGreensly: Poll: Will you be voting for President Trump in 2020? Please respond and retweet to expand the sampling. 🇺🇸
@DavidJHarrisJr Trump had invited many pastures to come and talk at the white house.  So much love and hope was talked about.  Those men are the faith leaders. Not the trash doing the devils work preaching hate.

We moved to Washington and any time we travel to visit. I-n-O was our first stop.  TY for the memories I-n-O.
@JTrutheau @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I am seeing Government more and more like sports teams.  Should have trading cards for each House and Senate Members.  Have cards for each President and Accomplishments.  Trumps Card would have to be mini book since he has done so much already, and there is more to come.

@cookmichaelv13 @anglersny2 @Ocasio2018 You're Asking the Wrong Question @Cookmichaelv13 he did give you two facts. You should have asked, "cite your sources". then you can go and scrutinize it. If you find it to be false then you can cite your source to disprove it.
@oldtoothlessli1 @HelenICURN @RealJamesWoods Medicare mass take backs should be criminal.  They basically rip off the Doctors and force them to prove with documentation of money they had already been paid.  Not compensating them for all the time and money to fight it and prove to get their own money back.
@Biaggi4NY @nytimes @Ocasio2018 When are you going to stop hiding behind the media and actually start answering some real questions?
@j0nny5 @Ocasio2018 @SachaBaronCohen Did  @tedcruz off people free Healthcare for all and Free college with no economic plan or statistical data that can be reviewed and debated?  No, they are offering hopes and dreams with no proof of how they would obtain it.
@HelenICURN @RealJamesWoods Doctors spend years learning their craft and then get slammed with the corruption of the Insurance Companies. Not only do they rip off the customers with the high rates, they rip off the doctors by not paying them for the services rendered.
@RealJamesWoods Does he plan on paying for it out of his own pocket?
@dbongino What do you think insurance is?  They keep adding more and more kinds of Insurance. now we are ensuring our identities so they are not taken.  Figure out how much you pay for all your insurances and that is depressing.  That's the ultimate Scam.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Their own local government failed them.  You putting the blame at the feet of the president is really quite silly.  Especially since there are countless videos already circulated how they wasted so much aid that came to them.

@babernathy78 @realjackhq @FGSakeDMc @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders I was not looking for a universal living wage. I am sorry you felt that was what I was looking for Ziggy. Each state, hell ever city cost a different amount to live in.  I happen to live on the Central Coast of California. Many are leaving because it cost so much to live here.
Why is the @UN not there helping these people from being slaughtered in their own homes? https://t.co/7084P1htnJ
@mishlmc @Ocasio2018 Not so much what she has to say. But answer for the things she has said. She is being sheltered so she cant be opposed.  What are they hiding?  Possibly they really have no mapped out plan and are just offering hope and dreams with no statistical data to support it?
@ArianaGrande I miss seeing things about your brother.  I really enjoyed watching him on Big Brother.  I hope he is well.
@neetersimpson @RealJamesWoods I would like to watch a body language expert read her.   Those pauses and how she looks for the words.  Each moment can tell you if they are embellishing, lying, looking for a memory.  I would enjoy that.
@SenKamalaHarris Your just race baiting and that is really sad to see.  We have come so far yet.. people like you can't seem to move forward.  You toss fuel on the fires of race haters.   But please keep it up.. you do you.
@TomiLahren because they are to busy manufacturing fake news.  Why cover something that is not within the current narrative of destroying @realDonaldTrump ?
@S_McConnell_ @texpatnj @SenSanders I did ask.. and yet still no one has said what amount would be a livable wage.  If you can't even figure out the simple part of how much is enough.  How will it ever be debated or fixed?
@babernathy78 @realjackhq @FGSakeDMc @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders My mom cared for my great-grandmother, aunt, grandmother because she saw what they do to people in homes. Some are nice but it's not being with your family. I told my mom I would never put her in a home. I didn't. I spent six years caring for my mom till she took her last breath.
@babernathy78 @realjackhq @FGSakeDMc @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders Oh please ziggy.. so many people ship off their parents because they don't want to deal with it.  They send them to homes to die alone.  They say they can't deal with it. It's too much.  NO! it's never too much, people are just lazy and not willing to give of themselves.
@babernathy78 @realjackhq @FGSakeDMc @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders I responded to homes once cost $25.  I was pointing out change. The new norm of single-parent family units. With no help from the family like they once had when houses were only $25. Keep up Ziggy!!  smiles::

@realjackhq @FGSakeDMc @babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders We also had family units that had not only the mother and father in the house but grandparents were active in the care of the kids.  Kids are shipped off to daycare and old people are shipped off to convalescent homes now.  Our culter has completely changed.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Did you ever go when Clinton, Bush, and Obama held law braking ILLEGAL immigrants?  Did you make your voice heard when the little boy died in Obama's care? Your fake outrage is laughable. But keep it up, Henny Penny. How about fixing the Immigration policies?
@AshaRangappa_ @tedlieu @NaveedAJamali Yes, Keep pushing Russia angle, even though it's proven to be a setup. https://t.co/5nHWdABesq
@tedlieu oh gosh here goes Henny Penny again.. the sky is not falling people.  The lines are redrawn each time the power switches.  They mess with the lines. Dems did it, Reps do it.  It's pretty common.  I often think of Ted running in Circles with his hair on fire when I read his posts.
@FGSakeDMc @babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders We are talking about what is a fair living wage.  I asked a pretty simple question. How much is enough?  If you can't answer it.  No reason to try and make it personal and deflect.   Just say you don't know.
@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders You are not answering the question.  How much?  I was looking at the minimum wage went to glass roof and they pay two dollars over minimum wage for the lower level jobs.   How much is enough to live on?
@Ocasio2018 When are you going to stop hiding behind the media and actually start answering some real questions?
@RealJamesWoods Even though I can't stand her, she has media hounding her non-stop. It would be pretty easy to get some bad pictures of anyone if you take enough of them all day.
@dixon_jamee @babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders please tell me how Jamee.  Just telling me I'm wrong won't help.  I would like to hear your point of view.

@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders how much is a living wage to you?
@swayrock @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders I'll share my background with you. it's not all roses and gold goblets. Might be a bit disappointing for you. ::laughs::
@SaraCarterDC What area of government did Obama not destroy the people's confidence in?  IRS, DOJ, FBI, BLM, Now the Pentagon and the list grows.
@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders Yes, Amazon has allowed their business model and there practices to be reviewed by colleges and is used in the curriculum.  They also open up a platform for anyone like you or me to sell our products thru them.
@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders prison's and privet prison's are a whole other conversation.  Don't go muddying up the waters.
@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders they are only trapped in poverty and debt if they spend more than they make. If they lived on assistance and got a job at minimum wage they should have been able to save. Problem people don't save, don't invest in them self. That's not a new pair of jeans. It is Money in the bank
@CariniGambarini @texpatnj @SenSanders Each of his children are educated and have been successful in business.  When the family unit brakes down you don't have parents with time to mentor their own children.  The lack of communication then is passed down to that generation. We have generations of latchkey kids.
@CariniGambarini @texpatnj @SenSanders I really do feel we end up pore from the lack of knowledge and self-control it takes to keep our wealth.  The break down of family values and communication has created this larger divide.  Let's use Trump as an example, his father mentor him and he mentors his own children 1/2
@babernathy78 @marknutter @texpatnj @SenSanders If a company went into a small town that had no jobs.  Then he gave them all jobs.    Jeff Bezos give people jobs and make them porer?  What about the market is it charging more? Did land prices and rent go up?  I am not seeing how he is the bad guy.
@CariniGambarini @texpatnj @SenSanders Let's figure out what you considered to be pore. Because what you value and what I value might be different.   What your needs to be happy and what my needs to be happy can also be quiet different.
@TripTLFantastic @nomessoms @SenSanders @GOP As far as my FSIL, with the booming economy, we have seen a huge upswing in building new homes, We just had two shopping malls put in and a new Auto mall is in the works.  I live in California.  2/2
@TripTLFantastic @nomessoms @SenSanders @GOP There are a lot more applicants because of how they are obtained.   Most businesses don't take calls or walk-ins and you have to apply online.  some use ATS Robots. With all the job sources on the net, one person can send out quite a few applications every day.  1/2
@nomessoms @SenSanders Why yes!!  My soon to be son-in-law started at a very nice wage when he joined the Electrical Union.  Literally making more than me with a simple degree and 30 years of experience..  We need people doing jobs like Welding, concrete, plumbing.
@SenSanders no one forced them to take the job at those rates.
@DebraKe98192288 @MSNBC Still more important headline than a flag is up or down for a McCain.
My great grandmother loved Butter Toast in a bowl and topped with half &amp; half. She also liked cottage cheese, mayo, pineapple and tomatos, she would take a little of each in each bite.   ⚡️ “People are sharing their weird food combos 🥤🍟🍦”		https://t.co/InR3ktUWrc
@MSNBC You're more worried about some guy who is dead than the deal that is going to effect Millions of people in two countries.   Where the flag is, won't affect anyone's life.  Not one.  Oh yes.. really important News you have here Fake News.
@PZabroski @atensnut He wet fired his plane.  He was the cause of it all. Just because people go and try to rewrite history and definitions of words, does not change the facts.
@Ron4Trump38 @MikeNorCal1 @JohnJoh35969237 I think mike is just a troll.. he is not adding to any conversations really.
@tedlieu @POTUS @McDonalds Well, Potus does represent the forgotten. Not everyone saw McCain as a hero, some saw him as a traitor.  I applaud my President for not acting fake.
@tedlieu Trump Posted 5 tweets. You cherry pick 1 out and write crap about it.  Your such a little man.. not just in stature but mind.  I notice Most of your stuff is just retweeting. Nothing really originates from you.  Perhaps CNN has a place for you and your fake outrage.
I am sorry for your loss. Thank you, to the family that raised such a brave and patriotic individual. https://t.co/3xY3Mp0VDH
@sincitycomedy @DavidJHarrisJr Not sure why it would matter who appointed them.
RT @staceydash: @HillaryClinton Most of the country are still waiting for you to go to jail. Stop with your fake concern. The children are…
@DavidJHarrisJr We need to look at who are judges are even in the lower courts. This judged should be investigated or the laws they are being bound by changed.
@tedlieu @NRA NO!! Because., you have gun free zones like Chicago and they are playing the real-life version of purge on a daily basis.  Give people back the tools to protect themselves. It's in the Constitution.  Why we need a Constitution supporting judge in the Supreme Court.
@atensnut McCain should have never been in government. It just shows that the legal system has been unfair for many decades.  USS Forrestal in 1967. The naval disaster killed 134 sailors and injured 161. Having 2, 4-star Admirals and father rose to Commander comes in handy.
@MikeNorCal1 @JohnJoh35969237 @TomFitton @DonaldJTrumpJr please explain what this BOT crap is.  I keep getting and seeing other Trump supporters get this response from people that evidently can't figure out an adequate reply.
@JohnJoh35969237 @TomFitton @DonaldJTrumpJr what about Trey @TGowdySC .  This man seems to be ethical and educated and knows what's going on.  I think he would be amazing.
@samanthathoms @Jason_Aldean @lukecombs awww.. but Jason is so gosh darn sexy.  I find Luke adorable but he is the same age as my boys.  I hope you have tons of fun.
@AdamSchiffCA well, let's investigate you Adam. I bet you have talked to someone that has broken a law someplace.  If we pick through your life and all your associate's lives, I bet we will find plenty of things.  Why not .. let's pick through Adams life and see if he likes it.
@GaetaSusan @FoxNews @POTUS Please keep in mind, they have to have someone with his point of view on the network,  or it would look like CNN and MSNBC only one point of view.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump yes, makes perfect sense.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump yet I feel like we didn't accomplish anything.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/cf9djO9s3k
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I was excited about the conversation. Most people just stomp off in a huff and don't try and find any common ground.  You and I couldn't find any baseline.  I don't agree with you, and that's okay with me. I need to work on my communication skills it seems.  TY for your time Low.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Not going to talk with you anymore Sir. You don't wish to have a conversation but an argument.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump wouldn't that be racist?  If your only helping one race?
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump You're Lucky you know who your ancestors are.  I have no idea who mine are.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I hope you find you are not alone.  Many want equality for all.  I hope you find a way to see past the fence and know you can leave.  You are free to be all you want to be.  I hope you seek knowledge and use it to better yourself and give a helping hand to others.  Wish you well.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump because it's not a black thing its a poverty thing. All Pore are going through the same issues.  A lot of single moms are Spanish, white and black.  Its a pore thing no matter what color your skin is.  Stop dividing us we need each other Low.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That's right,  and he would have never been president if white people didn't also vote for him.  You act like the struggle has been shouldered by blacks only.  A lot of white people also died for equality for all.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Indians, Eskimos, and Mexican families lost their lands.  Jews, Chinese and Japanese all were treated badly.  We can't change what happened in the past.  We just have to make sure it is not repeated. You still don't have an argument on why you're oppressed because you're black.
@dsmaybin0308 @lukecombs man.. you can say it over and over and scream it from the rooftops!!  Luke has a way of putting words to raw emotions wrapped up in music that soothes the soul.  One number away, Beautiful Crazy and my favorite Must've Never Met You.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Hell no, question everything!!  I started to look for the full speeches and look for the full reports on things people were talking about.  I was shocked how much is twisted to push their narratives. Both sides are guilty of doing this.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump please explain:"See this is why we can’t agree because you refuse to admitted to the wrong doing."  We never talked about Jim Crow Laws or 1965. Nor am I sure why we would talk about it today.  How is it affecting you today?
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump If every black person in the united states was pore, then I could see your argument having credibility. But every race has rich and pore. Lack of knowledge and know how is color blind. We need to educate ourselves and our children.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Obama, Oprah, Cory Booker, Daymond John, Micheal Jordon, Robert L Johnson, JayZ and the list goes on.  Pore white people have been here since this country started and they still are white pore people today. It's not a color thing. Lack of education and communication for all pore.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump No, I don't agree.  I have a very diverse background.  These conditions are not just in color neighborhoods, but in all pore neighborhoods.  Communication is our biggest problem. Being able to communicate in a positive way even when we don't agree.  Keeping families together.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I agree with wanting to hear the other side views.  But I don't find this to be much of a discussion but more of a tit for tat.  I really don't see it being beneficial to either of us.  Perhaps if we find some common ground where we do agree.  Education, Abortion, Men's rights?
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Cite Facts not feelings.  Feelings are not facts. Facts are proven by statistical data. I have yet seen you cite anything that can be factually proved. YOU feel Trump is Racist.  What proof do you have of it?  What has he done while he is @POTUS that only benefit white people?
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Well, we will have to agree to disagree.  ::hugs::
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Was a pleasure chatting with you LowwkeyE. Hope you have a wonderful day.
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump The Ellis Island Medals of Honor.  Shocking how not till 2016 did anyone start calling him a racist. The proof is in, that the DOJ, FBI, and DNC tried to frame him.  The Fake Media has known the truth yet push the fake news anyways.  And you want to be seen as an oppressed? STFU
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Your so determined to be a victim. Be one, it's your right to whine and point at everyone else for your failures.  Yet looking around I see so many making it, of every color, religion, and demographics. https://t.co/WXpBbsSmxK
@LowwKeyE @Bonelesscakes @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Now your making up things.
@LowwKeyE @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump When did NFL become black only?  Again lot of white people live in Africa.  Your really having to reach to be offended.  Stop acting like a victim. It's not all about you.
@dbongino Mueller has to hold out till after the November elections. So they can come out with breaking news that goes no place to try and distract the people.  Mueller witch hunt is the insurance policy Peter Strozk talked about.
@LowwKeyE @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump What has happen to you, to make you think he is Racist? I don't see any nationality being held back by Trump.
@FoxNews Why is there a court case if he already said he did it?
@rgoodlaw let's see, Trump brought it up and Obama belittles him because of it.  Obama staff was instructed to stand down and allow the hacking.  Yet you accuse Trump? He was the one that told the world it was happening!!
@sally_elder Why are you imply something that didn't happen?  I guess the fake news does that every day.  I don't see an issue asking if they are working together.  We are one nation and Dem's and Rep's should be working together.  Trump has asked the Dem's to come to the table.
@laurapedirose @elizabethforma You're more than welcome not to comment or read what I say.  FREEDOM IS YOURS. Thank you to all the men and woman that have fought and died for you to have that freedom.
@DavidJHarrisJr Just another Reason why she should never run for a government job.  She has warped views.  Remember.. the doctors are trained to clip the vocal cords first so they don't have to listen to the babies scream as they rip them apart.
@TweeterMaus @patrickykim @elizabethforma I see you're quite passionate about something. But you didn't state one specific thing to justify it. give me some fact or link to prove your outlandish statements.
@patrickykim @elizabethforma Trump Supporters Chant it now. I am not debating when the term originated.  Warren is just coming to the table with this idea that is already being focused by the Trump's White House.  Why shouldn't they work together on it since they are wanting the same thing?
@Yemayah777 awww.. that is really funny.  If you want to talk about what I said, I am open to it.  But to try and quiet my point of view is wrong.  I feel you should be heard even if I don't agree with you.
@patrickykim @elizabethforma What do you think Clear the Swamp is?   We will have to agree to just disagree.  I find your statement to be BS.  She lied about her heritage to try and get ahead.  What else will she lie about?
@elizabethforma Is this a bi partisan Bill?  Did she work with the Trump team at all on this. Sense this is what they have been running on for the past few years.  Its like Elizabeth Warren just woke up and heard what Trump supporters have been begging for.  She is spinning it like its her idea.
@johnsertich @ARmastrangelo @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Thank you for sharing your point of view.  It is okay if we don't agree.  Hope you have an amazing evening.
@SenWarren https://t.co/7Mtc81QdTV
@RealJamesWoods @TheDemocrats Illusory truth effect is a real thing.  Its very simple, if you repeat a lie enough you can trick the human brain to believe it is true.  CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and now @netflix are propaganda networks to push the Democrats Agenda.
@thehill Always shocks me, when people try to rewrite the meaning of words.  Get a clue @SenSchumer if this was a dictatorship you would be dead a long time ago.
@johnsertich @ARmastrangelo @HillaryClinton @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump you can disagree.
@Jason_Aldean They grow up so fast.
@woodpeker99 @JudicialWatch thank you Woody.
@JudicialWatch Why is Judicial Watch doing what the different branches of government are supposed to do?  They are to have oversite and make sure each of them is following the law. Oversite needs to be able to hold Obstructionist accountable.
@Amber_305 @NinaSky_2 @elihbeckman @BarackObama @HillaryClinton Are you talking about Eli Beckman, Amber?
@ARmastrangelo Don't forget the two-headed snake, @HillaryClinton, and @BarackObama who corrupted the FBI, DOJ, CIA, IRS, and BLM. They travel around the world talking negatively about @realDonaldTrump and the United States. They have no use for their clearance now.
@NinaSky_2 @elihbeckman please do explain how he is a sucker for Kim Jong Un?  He stated that its a work in progress, that he was clear what his goal is.  Did you not get the memo... FBI, DOJ, @BarackObama, and @HillaryClinton framed the Trump team.  It was all a setup.  Look past the Propaganda.
@elihbeckman What is your proof?
@tedcruz Illusory truth effect is a real thing.  Its very simple, if you repeat a lie enough you can trick the human brain to believe it is true.  The media will keep doing this until they are held accountable.  Fines might get their attention.
@Anthony2028Gill Very true, I don't think enough focus on communication is made.  How to ask for guidance, how to interact in a positive manner, even when having opposing views. My ability to communicate was greatly hindered by my upbringing.  Took the long road, 40 years figure that out.
Illusory truth effect is a real thing.  Its very simple, if you repeat a lie enough you can trick the human brain to believe it is true.  CNN, MSNBC, and CBS are propaganda networks to push the Democrats Agenda.  They knew Trump was framed, yet said nothing. https://t.co/t5QpuWRniB
@SenGillibrand We have more than equal rights.  We have taken men's rights away.  They don't even have the right to choose if their child is kept or aborted.  Where is the equality?  Force him to pay for a child he didn't want, force him to allow his child to be aborted.  I don't see equality.
@SenSanders 1) Didn't Democrats get the tax break?	2) Billionaires didn't spend millions to elect Democrats?	3) Are you telling me that only Republicans are rich and we can't work hard and become rich ourselves? 	Statistical Data shows Socialism has not worked.  Stop trying to destroy us.
@TomiLahren well, not only did the FBI, DOJ, CIA, and IRS become corrupted under Obama but the BLM as well.  They are affecting the lands that some cattle graze on.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump We really need to start looking at who is in our courts.  What judges we have ruling over these cases.  We do not have equal justice under the law. The Judges are key, The corruption is not just in the DOJ, FBI, CIA, IRS, and BLM.  We need judges that support our laws, period.
@tedlieu What scares me is I supported @BarackObama and feel guilty that he weaponized DOJ, FBI, IRS, BLM, and CIA.  His unethical corrupt behavior destroyed the credibility and trust of these agencies. Obama Framed Trump.  Get your head out of the sand Ted.
@DavidJHarrisJr Crazy talk!!!  They made a conscious choice to break the laws of the United States.  That alone should make them ineligible to stay here.  We are a nation of laws.  Perhaps their lack of ethical behavior is why their own Countries are falling apart.
@SenGillibrand We need a man like Bret Kavanaugh to stand up for our constitution.  Little by little, we are losing our rights.  Stop your fear mongering @SenGillibrand The harder you fight, makes me think we need him even more.
@eyesopen1 @PastorDScott @realDonaldTrump Don't dwell on simple-minded words. You are Beautiful, brave, forward-thinker, and patriotic.  Do it with a smile and joy in your heart.  ::hugs::
@perfectsliders Question:  They broke up Bell phone company when I was a kid.  Why don't they brake up FB, Twitter, and Youtube to open the market up?  If they had competition, they would be less likely to abuse their customers.
@ericpaslay Oh.. I want to go fishing now.  Thank you for sharing. ::hugs::
@DavidJHarrisJr Well, we will have one more to add to it after this frame job all come to light.  I hope the buck stops with him and he is held accountable.
@MSNBC really nice job spinning this.  You didn't mention that Bruce Ohr is key in the case to try and frame President Trump.  I hope someone is protecting him and his wife Nelly.  They are key and Killary and Obama secrets are coming out.
@RealJamesWoods @nytimes He is not a King.  He is more powerful than a mere King.  Look at the Queen of England, what power does she have?  We have had DOJ, FBI, IRS, and CIA become corrupted under the Obama years. Please tell me how that is not Treason when they don't follow their Commander and Chief?
@969thekat @lukecombs I can't get enough of Luke's music. Such a gifted and sexy man.
@DanielDadler970 @RealJamesWoods I know how you feel!!  I live in California.
@LisaStepanek @MSNBC @maddow Brennan has done more than just the frame job, this is just the start of his legal issues.
Just so shocking, I'm glad it is all starting to come out. https://t.co/qVGJeaDBJ4
@MSNBC @maddow Yes, he should be reviewing his legal options. He has committed Treason and is part of the attempt to frame our sitting  President.
@RealJamesWoods People joke about this young lady all the time but she has the ear of many people that want free stuff. I'm scared she might win and this could spread like cancer. Socialism destroys Countries.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI @POTUS Better protect Bruce Ohr.. he is the key Master and Killary, and so many others have a lot to lose for him to live.   Better get him into protective custody.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI @POTUS Why can't people who know about this lie be prosecuted for treason?  People like Ted have known Trump was framed yet have been spreading lies to divide the people.    18 U.S. Code § 2381 - Treason.  Make it so they can never hold office again.
@RunnerBoy97 @charliekirk11 again all the more reason to cut all funding and refocus it toward the Lost Americans that are homeless.
@neal_katyal @WSJ Many levels to why Brennan should have his clearance taken.  One that is very simple, he had no use for it.  Because this administration does not have any use for him. As such he has no reason to have such clearance.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump People have to have their head in the sand to think he is racist.  Shows how powerful Propaganda really is. The brainwashing continues, if they repeat it enough it must be true.  “illusory truth effect” Why repeating the truth is so important.
@realDonaldTrump I went to the mall today looking for Dan's book.  He is so on top of what is going on.  Shocking what you have to go through my President. Thank you for being willing to weather the storm to make our lives better.
@nytimes That is a beautiful image.
@charliekirk11 Good question! That money can be used for our lost Americans that are homeless across our nation.
@RepAdamSchiff Brennan marketed himself on his past job and his still standing clearance. Past leads didn't run to the news to be obstructionists. The clearance is to aid them, Brennan clearly is not helping anyone but his pocketbook. No one gagged him so he can still whine all he wants.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump That makes no sense. The man was not gagged. He just can't market his clearance now.
@nineteen70sumn @CNN LOL.. that is funny
@wookietim @CNN You go ahead and worry about something not even proven to exist. I wish you well. Was nice talking with you.
@wookietim @CNN They set up a question that no one should answer.  I can't guarantee what my husband said years ago before I knew him.  I would be stupid to do so.  They created a negative out of it, and it's not even relevant.
@MrJasonByrd @BoSnerdley @DailyMailCeleb I agree.  I am shocked they didn't bring Omarosa back in.
@mirniazi @ian_donnie @CNN I will still mess it up again.. I hope you catch it next time as well.  ::laughs::
@wookietim @CNN Tomothy-  His actions show me he is working his bum off.  His personal life I don't really want to hear about.  I don't know one person who has not said that word at least one time.
@wookietim @CNN Don't you think them asking her questions about his personal life not related to business at hand is Gossip? I do not care about who he had sex with or if he said the N word or his locker room talk.  That does not matter his actions and what he is doing for us is what I want.
@SpanoJanae @FoxBusiness Don't know how he keeps soldiering on Janae.  His focus has to be amazing with all the BS that is tossed at him.  I just don't agree he handled this well. He is human and is not perfect. I want him to give us all he is fighting for. I wish there was more we could do to help.
@wookietim @CNN If the reporters want to just peddle Gossip maybe they should move their news to the register stand next to the Inquire.
@wookietim @CNN I feel the question in itself was silly. Sarah's job is to report what is currently going on in the White House, how it pertains to him working for the people.   You can see it was worded to trap her to make a story. Fake News.  I want to hear about Real Events Current for today.
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods oh .. that's good to imply something like that when you don't like what they have to say.  You don't have to agree with me, I don't have to agree with you. But I'm open to having a conversation without trying to imply my thoughts are not my own.   Good luck to you.
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods Not really sure where my ancestors hailed from.  My Birth Certificate says my mom was white and my dad was negro.  proving government run anything is half-ass.
@ian_donnie @CNN :: hangs her head in shame::    yes yes.. You are or You're.  Thank you.
RT @DavidJHarrisJr: Omarosa, Impeached Dirty Judges and more! https://t.co/EFypMCGBgk
@DavidJHarrisJr A man worth listening to.
@kjp5886 @therealroseanne No.. I didn't know VJ was black.. and if you look at the picture and at VJ.. she looks like them.  Nice try though.   It had nothing to do with her being black. But you have chosen to believe that.. so we can agree to disagree. wish you well.
@Jason_Aldean @opry Wow...  your such a sexy man.  I am looking forward to hearing you sing. Such a big fan.   I hope you're doing well in your personal life.
@dbongino Dan, I really don't think they will change their tune.  I think they are committed to this.  They will just say its a cover-up or some other ism they might make up.  Scary watching history repeat itself.
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods Not sure why you feel you should be entitled to someone else's money.  I am struggling to make it right now.  But that's my own doing, no one else's. I just need to find a job and learn to invest in myself more.
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods SOME OF THE PEOPLE &gt;&gt;&gt; THEY ARE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME!!!!  THEY  took a chance and made it.  Now you want to profit from all their risk.  I just don't understand that at all.
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods Wealthy on the backs of regular workers?  Okay.. so you feel you should be equal?  So when things get tight.. you going to cut back your pay so the company can keep going through rough patches? You going to get a loan to make sure payroll happens? These are the things they do.
@CNN ::laughs::   YOUR really struggling to be relevant CNN..   keep trying.
@lukecombs I think you're blessed with a gift and grateful you share it with us.  Keep it up!!
@therealroseanne I am missing you on tv Roseanne.  Don't lose your spark over their misunderstanding.  I see who you are. ::hugs::
@Nightline @lukecombs Love how you put words  to emotions I have such a hard time expressing.   Thank you for sharing your gift.  ::hugs:: 💗 Must've Never Met You 💗
@ScottSmith7961 @FoxBusiness I am not qualified for such a job.  But I can express my feelings and opinion on it like you.  Wish you well.
@ScottSmith7961 @FoxBusiness "Cry me a river.  Don't care."  Sorry we have nothing to talk about.  I do care.  So many lives have been sacrificed for that freedom.  Men and Woman cared enough to die for them to have the right of freedom of speech.  Finding a better way for them to express it is worth my time
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods ::laughs::  well I am looking for work. So my husband would say I am a freeloader on his dime.  Those that own companies, they are taking all the risks and the tax cuts give them more money to higher people, give raises, update equipment.  Some companies are doing just that.
@DiuSabani @FoxBusiness They do have the money, but that never means you have the know how. Money does not equal knowledge.  If you never had the opportunity to learn about something does not make you stupid.
@CNN @AnushayHossain @CNNOpinion I do not like Omarosa. I also do not like when Trump calls people names. But it is far from sexist or raciest.  You are as bad as Gossip rag now days.
@SenGillibrand Men do not have equal rights.  We force them to be fathers when they don't want to be. We force them to loose their child when they don't want to.  HOW  IS THAT EQUAL?
@PrincessBravato I honestly don't think I know one person that has not said that word at least once.  Some people talk differently when they are in privet compared when your in the public eye. Locker room talk and BS with your colleagues gets a little colorful at times.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Wish we could watch him answer questions publicly.  I am getting tired of all the secrets.  Secrets only breeds Corruption.  Please stop calling people names.  only shows you didn't have anything at the time intelligent to say.  I know your intelligent, so you have no excuse.
@FoxBusiness When your attacked even if you know your wrong you become dogmatic in your belief. Insulting someone will only make them dig in deeper and cling to their position. I don't agree with them, but I do understand their point of view. 2/2
@FoxBusiness I know I had a rough time growing up. A lot of social norms and how to get my point across I have struggled with.  Some of our Football players come from hard lives.  Do you think maybe they just don't know any other way to express themselves? 1/2
@selectttt @RealJamesWoods I don't understand. We all have opportunities in life. I can look back at many mistakes I made. I dont envy others wealth. They just made better choices than me. I just need to do better.
@BWoehrel @mcoon12369 @RealJamesWoods I will be young at heart forever.  I was born to broken couple. My dad was a pimp and my mom was his bottom b*tch.  I watched my mom transform her life into something to be proud of.  There is common ground in every extreme. You just have to be willing to look for it.
@KamalaHarris Climate change has been going on way before humans were even on the surface of the earth.  Look at the whole picture not just a small window of data.
@GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec She is quite a woman, an inspiration to me.  Happy Birthday, Sarah! I hope you have a stressfree day filled with love and wonder.
@mcoon12369 @RealJamesWoods I really hope you're wrong.  I think we all choose our paths and it takes longer for some than others to find our way.  How they were raised has a lot to do with their reaction.   Just need to find common ground so we can relate to each other and find solutions.
@RealJamesWoods They seem to put more into emotion than facts that can be proven. Maybe we can reach out to them on the level they are comfortable and show them the emotional side of moving away from the Globalist movement and focus on making our own country more prosperous.
@CNN @CNNPhotos They chose to do this to their own children.  You brake the law, bad stuff happens.  They could of went to a port of entry or applied at an American consulate. They knew they were breaking our laws. That alone should be a reason to never allow them to stay.
@FoxNews Every person is not the same. We are products of our environment.  Dogs are more so than even us because you are their world. What environment you provide for any dog reflects in the emotional stability of the dog. Disappointed in you Fox, your feeding a stereotype not reality
@realDonaldTrump Not many people step out of their circles to engage others that live so different than themselves.  Our President is so inclusive and the more they try and point out how evil and divisive he is. His actions seem to show differently.  A man of the people, for the people.
@RealJamesWoods It did make me think you might be a tad bit bord.   But I'm enjoying your tweets, so please keep doing what you're doing. Unless you have an opportunity to do something really amazing.. and could tell us about it. We will all be in awe and stuff.
I love the way you said that. https://t.co/5roLFLs7Kp
@RealJamesWoods I am not good at getting my thoughts clearly across to others. The creator or designer of the can opener designed it to be open that way.  It became corrupted over time. Perhaps we should cling closer to our constitution.
@Marcelo77931223 @RealJamesWoods We all let bad people near us. Once you see the real person you remove them from your life.   We all should be glad she was removed as soon as she was. We just learn to see the signs faster with every mistake.
@RealJamesWoods I watched her on Big Brother.  She really is out of touch.  she uses god as a tool in name only.  Omarosa's actions didn't reflect the words she spoke.  She works people over like a conman would.
@RealJamesWoods @earthship_HQ - alternative building materials articles and videos, using tires, hay and bottles, and cans. Thermal mass heating with rocket stoves and shipping containers and hay bale homes.   We can fix this crisis. idea BLM land gifted to the people, to build off-grid living.
@AnnCoulter I am normally a fan of what you say, but this might be coming across wrong.  I am taking this to be a very racist statement.  Ann, I really hope I'm reading it wrong.
@fouch_von @cocojo414 @RealJamesWoods I really think her heart is in the right place.  A bit nieve but willing to put herself out there.  I do wish she was a better focus on something real.  Her energy is amazing and contagious. Don't underestimate her, and her ability to motivate that party.
@ArianaGrande ~ @ChrisStapleton - What are you listening to	~ @lukecombs - Must've Never Met You	~ @kanebrown - What ifs	~ @FFDP - Jekyll And Hyde	~ @NRateliff - Night Sweats - S.O.B.
@realDonaldTrump @harleydavidson My President,  thank you for having a vision and the know how to get us there.  Just think how much faster this all would go if you didn't have the obstructionist in your way.  What we all could achieve if they would only believe in you.  Please keep inviting them to the table.
@stonecold2050 I am so sorry for the loss of such a brave man.  His life should have been shown more respect from our media.  Thank you for sharing this with us.  These are the people we should be honored as heroes.  Show the world, not all humans are takers. Some give all, to their last breath
@Cameron_Gray I am really sorry you feel that way.  But your statement is all-inclusive.  Each of us, we are different and not all people are racist.
@IronicPhase @tedlieu @FBI :: smiles::  if you have a different view.. please share.
@FoxNews I had someone tell me to look at my pill intake. I was prescribed so many pills for different things.  After checking the meds I was taking. 90% had a side effect of depression, hallucinations, Insomnia and other effects that didn't affect me for many years till one day it did.
@FoxNews What is heartbreaking is it never happens all of a sudden. Depression is a silent deeply personal for the person braking deep within.  If you want to pray for anyone. Pray for the souls that walked along the same path as his and failed to see the signs of them trying to reach out
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @GregAbbott_TX Wish they did that in my state of California.   We don't need sanctuary Cities if you just fix the Immigration Laws.  If you break the law to come to America, you should never be allowed to stay. There is a right way to do things.  Stop making excuses for Criminals!!
@tedlieu @FBI they really are finding out how corrupt our FBI and DOJ are.  How they are attached to the DNC.   Ya. I am liking the new things they are finding out through the texts with Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steel.  It should be public so we can see him Squirm.
@FoxNews The flag is a symbol of freedom.  All people in the UNITED states are free because men and woman of every color and religion put their very life on the line so you can have such freedom.  How can you look at a soldier without shame filling your heart when you take a knee?
@FoxNews You kinda have to laugh at them.  They can call a press conference and make a statement of what they wish to bring light to.  Yet they do this like children trying to get attention.  Grow up and use your words. You have a platform you can get your message out there. Use it!!
@tony_myriad @CNN I have!!  thank you for noticing.  ::giggles::
@CNN Having a well-balanced life with work and play is a struggle for so many.  Looks like he successful at both. We all should strive for such a balanced life.  Thank you, my President, for setting such a wonderful example.
@BBCSteveR @BBCWorld thank you, I have wondered what they might be saying.
@IamPaulRevere @DimetriosV @K1tt3n105 Really well said. Thank you.
@NRATV @DiamondandSilk I don't know why this is even being talked about.  When I'm at work I can't just start protesting on company time. These players, are at work.  How about have a press conference before or after the game and talk about your concerns you wish to be brought to light, a Clear Message
@Ocasio2018 @benshapiro :  I would not meet with him either if I was you. He would use documented facts and statistical data to destroy your half-baked idea that has yet to be written down for anyone to see what it really is.  Thank you for shedding light on our homeless, we need that.
@Ocasio2018 We have statistical Data proving your idea does not work.  You're pushing a dream that has DESTROYED Countries and people from those countries come here for a better life.  Please Talk to them!!  About your slip-ups, your talking from the heart not a place of wisdom.
@realDonaldTrump I never understood secrets.  Secrets do nothing but hurt people.  Your FBI, DOJ, BLM, and house Staffers are Corrupted and Hide in the Secrets that are being kept from us. The American people.  The corrupt are depending on the truth never being seen.  Declassify and clean house!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What I have seen is Trump opening dialog and not saying it was fixed. He said, It will be a long road and we have seen progress.  No Missiles are being launched, an Open dialog is happening. Prisoners returned and some of our Dead returned to us.  But please keep up the rhetoric.
@SenSanders Yes, because you have shown us, that our safety is not much of a priority for you.  Forcing people to pay for insurance allows them to raise our rates.  They don't have to compete because you force us to have it.  No one should be forced to buy anything. We need Less Government!!
@MaddowBlog wow ... NBC..is all opinion and zero facts.  That's not news, just a gossip and opinion pushed as propaganda to divide the people.
@GOP Are we being brainwashed by mainstream media? Byron York: Harvard study: CNN, NBC Trump coverage 93 percent negative. “illusory truth effect,” if you repeat it enough it must be true.  We need to come together and stop letting Media rip us apart.
@TomiLahren May you be given all the Resources you need to be successful. Thank you, for protecting us.
@tedlieu @IngrahamAngle Ted, you don't like what she has to say, but a lot of Americans feel this way. Her comments have nothing to do with racism so you trying to make it such shows more about you than you know. We have a broken Immigration system that needs to be fixed. Fix it!
@benshapiro @JeremyDBoreing Oh Ben, don't threaten us with a good time.   You had to see this coming. ::laughs::
@kanebrown Such a cute couple. I hope you're as happy as you look.
@dbongino I am a 70's baby and was born into a mixed family. My Dad wanted to surprise me and drive me home in his new car.   After that day, not one kid was allowed to play with me. It was hard to understand racism then as a child, and I find it hard to understand now.  #AbolishRacism
@SenSanders Stop race baiting the American people. We have come so far. Stop trying to drag us backward.
@realDonaldTrump We need facts and open debate with statistical data to show the American people both sides of the argument without all the Posturing and cheap shots.  Outline what will be addressed and bring forth your proof.  Like Medicare for all, socialism. Help us, help you.
@Ocasio2018 I see you bring to light,  issues that need to be addressed.  I love it. But. BUT... Your ideas have been tried in other countries and it didn't work. Not just one but many. You have statistical data proving it won't work. Healthcare is an oligopoly, why not fix that?
@SenBooker This has already been proven to be false.
@SenBooker We are being brainwashed by mainstream media! Byron York: Harvard study: CNN, NBC Trump coverage 93 percent negative. “illusory truth effect,” if you repeat it enough it must be true.  Search out the truth. Don't let people like this use fear to push their corrupt agenda.
@dbongino When people protest, Normally its to drive a message you want others to consider.  These people had no message. They were flinging things out just to incite a negative reaction.  They were calling Candace Owens a Nazi and a traitor to her race.  They had no message at all.
@CGBReal @warriormama1019 @KamalaHarris Count every person, citizen, and non-Citizen. Nothing wrong knowing how many Illegal Immigrants are here.
@DavidJHarrisJr It is like they are living the Purge Movie every day in Chicago.
@tedlieu What a scary time in our history. We have Conservative voices being banned from social media and Biggots celebrated and their bad behavior justified.
@julieoccin @MSNBC How do you feel about what happened to Sarah Sanders or Kirstjen Nielsen?
@MSNBC Are we being brainwashed by mainstream media? Byron York: Harvard study: CNN, NBC Trump coverage 93 percent negative. “illusory truth effect,” if you repeat it enough it must be true.  Politicians have used this trick for years.
@AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders Bernie has no fight in him. He rolled over like a beat dog for @HillaryClinton and you don't even have a mapped out Financial plan for your dream of socialism. You're pushing a dream you have yet to figure out how it will be paid for. We don't need any more swamp rats.
@cnnbrk It is like they are living the PURGE every day in Chicago.  Might as well give them back their guns and give them a fighting chance.
@realDonaldTrump I grew up in California, the Crypts and Bloods came together and started a truce. This action changed many lives, not just the gangs. Gov. seems to be at war and everyone is out for themselves.  We need y'all to work together. If the Crypts and Bloods could do it, why can't you?
@steveavonloor @KingJames I am a cult 45 Deplorable. But attacking people for not saying it just right or writing it perfectly will make me question your dedication to change. My @POTUS I defend you when you don't say it right or break a norm in the protocol. You have other things to focus on. please do.
@charliekirk11 The real story is why is China's Number 8.8M.  Perhaps because we and other nations shipped our trash to them.  As of January, we have to figure out what to do with it.  Since China refuses to be the worlds trash can any more.
@lukecombs @FOXTV Thank you, Luke, for putting words to my emotions.  I play these two songs every day thinking about an old friend I miss. 	❤💞💋One Number Away  ❤ Must've Never Met You💋💞❤
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Oh, I loved the video. Just showed us how out of touch you are to the average American person. I went shopping and out of the three stores I went to. I was asked to show ID twice.  You can't google that btw. I lived it.
@AbdulElSayed @lsarsour Your Running on a dream you have yet to figure out how it will work. How about you print out a plan of how it will be funded. Tell us how much you will be taxing us and putting our Nation at risk by cutting our Military. Nothing is for free.

@AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders Do you believe in Sharia-Law? Do you think Sharia-Law has a place in the United States? Do you think Democratic Socialism is the answer, if so? How do you plan on paying for it?
@chucktodd Are we being brainwashed by mainstream media? Byron York: Harvard study: CNN, NBC Trump coverage 93 percent negative. “illusory truth effect,” if you repeat it enough it must be true.  Don't Normalize hate.
@SenSchumer Tell me when you chose to flip on Immigration reform? When did completely abandon your stance on it? I want to know, what pivotal moment happened, Republicans are fighting for the same policies you used to speak to people about.  Why are you abandoning your past values?
@ChuckCallesto DEM's are in bed with Russia and with China and shipping pallets of cash to people who hate us. They have the media repeating their propaganda over and over brainwashing the American people.  History is repeating itself as Newspapers try to justify hate. #WalkAwayMovement
@PattyMurray What happens to men's rights? What if they don't want to be a father? Why should a woman be the only one have the choice if they wish to be or not to be a parent. Why can't men have that choice? Let us fight for Equal Rights.

@brianschatz @sarahjeong Its like they are trying to normalize Hate &amp; Racism. We all need to stand up against hate based on anyone's Race, Religion, Gender or Sexual orientation.  Der Stürmer German paper published propaganda about the Jews.  Don't wait too late to stand up for your fellow American.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @ACLU This shows how little you have to talk about. Sense @BillClinton was in office this has been going on.  Yet only now do you find a voice to say something. Holding Centers for Illegal immigrants are nicer than most jails for American Citizens. #FakeOutrage

@ladygaga Friends and Family are often times ill prepared to deal with what demons we have rolling around in our heads. The look on their face slowly changing as you voice the dark emotions your struggling with, makes you die a little more inside.  Is there something like AA to help people
@MSNBC should bare, humanity has come to this. That she possibly is the first press secretary in history to have to have a secret service protection for her and her family.
@MSNBC Body Langue alone. She was ready for this moment and you could see it. The emotion and crack in her voice as she touched the bases, Each Slight, Each Event that has been witnessed by the people while she is in service of the people. Land on Home plate with the shame we all-
@MSNBC Jim Acosta wound up and pitched a perfect fastball to Sarah Huckabee Sanders!. Watching Sarah's fingers slide over the tabs in her binder was like she was adjusting her finger along the grips on a Louisville Slugger. You could see she would be hitting this out of the park with -
@MSNBC Please Watch the full press conference to see the full story. Like CNN, MSNBC is pushing propaganda.
@DimetriosV @K1tt3n105 @educationweek @RepMaxineWaters You have no answer to this. I asked you for open conversation and you can't bring yourself to have one. She does push hate and she tries to divide us not bring us together. write if you change your mind.
@tommygun264 @yolcuatmom @GunnyJ @thehill Why Yes!  FOX covered how we(the U.S.) have had remains here that have yet to be ID. The U.S. use outdated DNA tests that take more time and are more expensive. They give a full story good and bad, not Propaganda.
@AllmandStaci @OutFrontCNN @keithboykin Please do, all voices should be heard.
@benshapiro You have such a brilliant mind and I am in aww every time you support your views with statistical facts that can be verified. I also get to expand my vocabulary having to look up words like Mobius Strip.
@seanhannity Ivanka Trump can have different views from her father, it's our freedom as humans and American Citizens.  News: should report the verifiable facts to us and keep your opinions to yourself. Opinion pieces should be labeled as such. If we want your opinion then we can look for it.
@CNN @Acosta Ivanka Trump can have different views from her father, it's our freedom as humans and American Citizens.  I have watched your coverage of an event then seen uncut footage of it. You are not News Network your Opinion pushing Network aka Propaganda.

@dbongino Did the FBI ever talk with Aleksej Gubarev, the CEO of XBT Holding, he sued BuzzFeed and Chisterfer Steel?  The video I saw said Muller never contacted him about the part he played in being in the Dossier. I can't find anything past June on UK lawsuit.
@Ocasio2018 Thank you for bringing light to our forgotten American people who have been ignored far too long.  But taxing us to support your socialism concept would make even more of us end up on the streets. Your running on a dream, that we can't even review to see how it will be funded.
@KamalaHarris I find your comment very insulting.   It's like your telling some of our population they are too stupid to get an ID card.
@idrissharifali @DArnott8 @dbongino Not even to mention your every action affects every man woman and child on earth.  Your conversations are global and you're dealing with people who can literally destroy all life on earth.
@idrissharifali @DArnott8 @dbongino My friends at the media are going to write up stories that are leaked to them and harass you every day before the world. Its okay if its fake manufactured news.  Just keep the pressure up.  Every day Every hour.  Your every action and word scrutinized.
@idrissharifali @DArnott8 @dbongino OH did I mention I asked you for a job I really wanted and you would not give it to me? Oh, and I'm going to hand-pick all my friends that don't like you to be on my team.  I have unlimited resources and no limit on time to try and find anything.
@idrissharifali @DArnott8 @dbongino Now there seems to be no limit to what I can investigate in your life. Going back even before we met. I also will investigate everyone in your life and pick through their lives until I find something they might have done wrong.
@idrissharifali @DArnott8 @dbongino Let us make this a little more personal. If I didn't like you and I went and manufactured a fake document. Now the document cant stands on its own so let me have my friend at the media create a story. Now I lie to the court and they give me license to pick through your life.
@tedlieu Please don't vote for the Democrats. The only thing booming in our once admired State of California is our homeless population.  Our own American Citizens being ignored.  Look what Republicans have done for our Economy. I want to keep my crumbs, how about you?
@OutFrontCNN @keithboykin No, you set the tone. You have given us proof your fake news.  You have been caught staging stories.  We will practice our freedom of speech and point out how fake you are.
@TexasInsp Democratic Socialism.. is it still in the concept phase? Have they given a clear plan on how they would achieve it? Or is this just a politician way of offering you free stuff.. yet never deliver?
@lukecombs Luke.. want to thank you for the song: Must've Never Met You. Often times a few lyrics of a song hold meaning. Every word was perfect and spoke to my soul.  Again thank you for putting words to my emotions.
@KevinHart4real Awww.  she is beautiful.
@SenSanders Don't cry about the mess you made.  You force people to buy insurance created an oligopoly. Insurance and hospitals took Obama's lead and told us the mergers would lower the prices.  They no longer had to compete for our business.  This also destroyed Privet practices.
@MSNBC YOU chose to push fake unverified stories.  You attack the man we voted into office with  your bias coverage. You chose to push propaganda and become an enemy of the people. Run a more ethical business, you might get a better response from the people.
@code_name_v @trngchief11 @CNN I am sure if FBI could pick through your life and all your friend's lives, the FBI would find something to indicate any American on. People are caving because it cost too much to fight it. The government has endless resources. It's like you bringing a knife to a gunfight.
@CNN They only prolong it to try and manufacture something. Now its obstruction thru twitter,  since they can't find Russian collusion.  We see the FBI, DOJ Fake News Conspiracy.  This Sh^t show is the insurance policy.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I worked for @HomeDepot and reported my Store Manager for fraud. It only took weeks for them to harass and fire me 4 times before I gave up the job I loved.  I couldn't fathom how he stays focused on running our Nation with the ongoing personal attacks. I am with you my President
@SenSchumer @SenateGOP Did either Kagan and Sotomayor serve a sitting President? Is it common practice for these documents to be sealed? You flip-flopped on Immigration reform. Are you being hypocritical about this as well?
@H_X_S Sonia Sotomayor was nominated July 1, 2009, and was Confirmed on August 6, 2009  vote 68-31	Elena Kagan was nominated May 10, 2010, and was Confirmed on August 5, 2010 vote 63-37	How did they obstruct?
@CoryBooker Your party made it clear no matter who @realDonaldTrump chose you would obstruct the nomination.  Its the only message I am hearing.
@DontGoAwayM4d where have you been?  I have missed seeing you.
@SenSanders So is your idea published? Can I read it and see where you plan on getting the money to fund it?  Or are you still in the concept phase?
@DimetriosV @educationweek @RepMaxineWaters I won't be quiet and I asked for open dialog, a conversation. Did you not see the question mark?  Again What has she done. What project? what policy? I want to know.
@RepAdamSchiff What toll, do you think it takes on a person being attacked 24/7.  How distracting. When the obvious conflict of interest and bias has been documented.  Our President is on the world stage making deals with world leaders. I am frustrated for my President
@RepAdamSchiff It's hard to ignore the conflict of interest Mueller has and is all based on a fake dossier. It's hard to ignore how corrupt the DOJ, FBI, and IRS became under @BarackObama.  What happened to you are innocent until proven guilty? We do not have a fair justice system.
@scottlincicome Just think how much more @realDonaldTrump could get done if he had media support and we had public servants in office and not just Obstructionist like the @TheDemocrats
@SenSchumer Is that all you have to run on is to Complain and Whine about @realDonaldTrump   What is your plan?  Is this all the Democratic party has come to? TELL US your ideas without insulting the man we chose to be President.  Change starts with a conversation.
@SenSchumer Anyone can be an Ostrctionist. @realDonaldTrump  invites anyone wanting to work with him to come to the table.  You chose not to participate. Why have you flip-flopped on Immigration reform? What is your message other than whine about Trump?
@charliekirk11 because we do not have equal justice anymore in the United States. The DOJ and FBI have been corrupted and used against the American people. Muller is a perfect example of the corruption and how out of control it is.
@trabrewog @debaptiste_john @BernieSanders We should stop people from basically bribing our politicians to get their way.  Politicians no longer serve the people.  Why I am so impressed that our President is a true servant of the people and getting things done.
@jonbaltz @SMattMurphy21 @SenSanders Jon, why do you live in NY and not in a Scandinavian country like Denmark? Now, do they have to pay Tariffs? Do they pay for the military to police the world? Do they have Issues with Illegal Immigration? How much aid do they give to other countries?
@nytimes wow, your way of describing him does not do this man justice. U.K. does not have the same freedoms of speech as we do here in the U.S. He is just bringing to light what the government keeps covering up. The rape culture and the pedophiles that have invaded their country.
@DavidJHarrisJr Brigitte Babriel has been talking about this for some time.  They have had a plan. But to speak out about it will get you labeled as racist or Islamophobic. Europe under attack. They are being told they are being taken over to their face.  Europian government is complicit.
@CNN a source?  ::laughs::  Is this one of your staged stories? Or is this just your way of not verifying before publishing more BS?
@CNN The facilities are better than when Clinton, Bush, and Obama ran them. How about holding the criminals accountable for their actions.  THE PARENTS that put their children through this. This is like blaming the person getting robbed than the person robbing them.  I don't get it.
@RealJamesWoods comments like this happen when they have no real issues to run on.  Simple minded movies stars have been used throughout history to push propaganda.
@ChauncineC @CNN You must have missed the News Conference of those waiting for the remains. Many remains have been here many years and not ID yet. The DNA tests that the government use, are expensive and outdated.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You ask a politician a question and they talk in circles to the point your not even sure what your question was in the first place. They make promises they never intend to keep.  You are a Warrior, A successful Businessman an Advocate for the American people. Not a politician!
@FoxNews it's a beautiful thing when parents show their children to give and not just take.
@KlongName @nytimes I agree with the family detention and deporting together,  I don't agree with accepting every person that comes to a port of entry. They can apply at an embassy and wait their turn.
@FoxNews Seems kind of shady to me.
@KlongName @nytimes Please tell me what you feel should be done when people cross the border and brake our laws with their children in tow.
@ProjectKengiKat @educationweek @RepMaxineWaters Maxine Waters has been in office for a very long time.  Please tell me what she has done to make your lives better?
@DavidAlex1986 @educationweek @RepMaxineWaters Maxine Waters has been in office for a very long time.  Please tell me what she has done to make your lives better?
@DimetriosV @educationweek @RepMaxineWaters Maxine Waters has been in office for a very long time.  Please tell me what she has done to make your lives better?
@nytimes Children have been separated from their parents for at least 24 years. Since Clinton started this policy.  Yet only now kids are having issues?  How convenient that is to push your propaganda.  Your fake outrage is disgusting and misleading. Why you are labeled as FAKE NEWS.
@nytimes What about all the American's who are sick, hungry and homeless? Put the blame where it belongs. On the people putting their own kids at risk. We are a nation of laws. We have ports of entry.
@DavidJHarrisJr How effective can you be if you can't even stay awake? Shows how bias she is as well.  If she is only staying in because Crooked Hillary didn't make it into office.  Shows Trump won't be treated fairly by her.  Not someone I would want on the Supreme court.
@FoxNews @AlanDersh How did the judge not toss this out?  It is Fruit of the poisonous tree. This whole investigation was from the dossier.  Why has the FISA Court not done anything? Do they not have any power to hold FBI accountable when they are lied to?
@dbongino come to the central coast of California. We have an Avocado Farm that is on Hwy 41 near Morro Bay. They have the most amazing Hass avocados. Plus Morro Bay is beautiful.
@jarringcreation @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews actions speak louder than words.  The Dems are not willing to come to the table.  If they are resisting to change a broken system then they are for the broken system.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You have shown us change is possible. Pleases Hold your ground till we get Immigration reform and our wall.  Mexico new president has already publicly shown his hand. How are his statements not seen as a threat to the United States?
@Burtcomma @BenShapQuotes @benshapiro I like that he is on twitter. He seems more relatable. He is not perfect and polished and talking in circles like a politician.  He speaks plain and gets things done. I love the comment about the laser pointer. 😆
@Mediaite @benshapiro I don't think she is a real candidate. I think she will be disposable like Bernie was. Why they are not challenging her outlandish claims.  They will let her run amuck to distract until she has outlasted her usefulness.
@debaptiste_john @BernieSanders I don't agree.  When did the rich become our enemy? I dream of financial independence with a small place of my own. Some dream of more. Capitalism is what built this Great Nation. Why are you waging war on it?
@BernieSanders you realize these are the people who are creating jobs for us? The less we all have to give to you to waste gets put in the American peoples pocket.  That drives the positive economy.  Why do you hate America so much?
@SenSanders Who do you know that has moved to a socialist country to have a better life?  What socialist country is doing well? How are you going to pay for it? Nothing is for free. We don't need politicians false promises.
@NYYANKEES42HOF @KamalaHarris I wish they would focus on our people who are being left behind.  Our sick, hungry and homeless need to be taken care of before anyone else.  We should never leave an American behind.
@KamalaHarris wow, you're going to focus on something that has been going on for Millions of years. Its the circle of life.  How about you focus on our homeless, sick and hungry American people being ignored.
@Ocasio2018 PLEASE.. keep in mind. Nothing is for free.  Somone has to pay for it. Who do you know that has moved TO a socialist country to have a better life? How are Socialist Countries doing?  Don't be tricked by goody bag of false hopes.
@TomiLahren @DiamondandSilk OH, I just love this picture.  Thank you for sharing it.
@KamalaHarris Not sure why you keep trying to use fearmongering to persuade the people.  You're just doing what your handlers tell you to. Resist at all cost, no matter who Trump picked. You already tipped your hand weeks before the man was announced.  Why would we listen to you now?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @jack Keep in mind... they only attack your family personally when they don't have any platform of their own.  Stay the course and keep making our lives better. We see the positive change.. that's what is scaring them and making them leash out.
@KamalaHarris what are you doing about the American people who are homeless?  Your fighting for criminals from another country. How about you fight for the American people who are homeless and hungry living without the basic needs being met.
@DianneFeinstein Is there a legal precedent of this done to those that served past Administrations? Or is this just because he is Trump's choice?
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Why has the FISA court not done something?  They should be holding accountable those that lied to them. Nothing should stick because this all was started by lies.  I am tired of seeing the double standard. If I lied to the court.  I would be in jail.
@MattMurph24 Who is going to pay for this?  Who has left the U.S.A to live in a socialist country for a better life?  No one.. because it does not work. There is proof for all to see it does not work.
@SenWarren The economy is doing wonderful and you begrudge the rich making money? They create jobs.  What do you do? Other than lying to us?  We should not have to pay for ineffective politicians like you.
@tedlieu @POTUS well, he calls it as it is.  I watch the full speeches and see how they miss leading the sheep.  We are plagued with fake news AKA propaganda. It's so bad that socialist spouts off BS and media spread it like fact.
@SenSchumer We have long time enemies coming to the table to talk with our President. He strives to make the world safer.  You are not even willing to meet with your own President.  You made it clear you would resist every choice @POTUS made. Perhaps you're the real Enemy of the people.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Your non-stop attacks of our President show your desperate attempt to persuade the American people. Your words are never founded on fact or statistics but your warped feelings and sound bites from your handlers.  Our President is making a positive difference in our lives.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I have read in History again and again how corrupt people like you use the media to spin false stories to push your narrative with no burden of proof. You lose your law Lic do to your corruption? see we all can make misleading questions.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Henny Penny the world changes and so should we. Stop using the American people as your personal piggy bank. We need Immigration reform, we need a reciprocal trade if you can't fight for us get out of the way.
@tgilbrea @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump I love how smug @BarackObama was looking at the camera.  Asking how Trump was going to accomplish his campaign promises.  Sit back and be schooled Obama. This is what it looks like when government works for the people.
@DavidJHarrisJr [Hook: Ludacris]	Move btch, get out the way	Get out the way btch, get out the way	Move btch, get out the way	Get out the way btch, get out the way	Move btch, get out the way	Get out the way btch, get out the way	Move btch, get out the way	Get out the way btch, get out the way
@cnnbrk FAKE NEWS as usual.  Watch our Presidents full speeches you will see how bias CNN really is.  THEY stage and mislead the American people. Don't be sheep.  Search out the truth, because CNN only pushes Propaganda.
@Jambrady @misterbumface @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS The government has had unidentified remains from the Korean War since the war. They are using outdated, expensive DNA testing. @23andMe DNA, @Ancestry DNA, and @MyHeritage DNA should offer their services.
@RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump I never liked Politics or Economics because I always found it to be unfair. We are taught that we are stuck with this system. You have proven them all wrong my President.  We just need leadership willing to fight for change. We need to vote out lazy politicians.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump Nice Microsoft Graph.  Did you YouTube how to do it?
@SenSchumer Flipper Flopper you have no credibility on this subject.  You were talking crap and chanting resist before you even knew who Trump picked.  Your dogmatic and blind to your own hate to see what is best for the American People. Please keep Preaching your Resist BS!!
@tgilbrea @TalbertSwan @realDonaldTrump Obama talked a good game.  But Accomplished nothing.  I voted for him, I wanted to believe we as a nation had come so far to vote in an African American to the highest office in the land.  I am just sad it was a thief and a lier we chose to represent us.
@ballentine47 @SheriffClarke are you upset he wants to give 12billion to hard-working Americans or that he didn't ship pallets of cash to countries that hate us and promote Terror? HE is making free trade possible. HOW GREAT IS THAT?!! Obama couldn't even wrap his brain around it. Trump is making it happen.
@TalbertSwan your issue the amount of money that was spent or that it's being spent on the American people?  Not some pallet of cash dropped off in some land that chants Death to America.
@TalbertSwan Your Jealousy Shows.  Ya, he does not talk like a politician where they make promises and don't keep any of them.  He actually is there working to make our lives better.  Obama could not even wrap his brain around what Trump is accomplishing.
@EskimoFunk @TalbertSwan no issues with their choices in their personal life.  Every man or woman can live their life however they so choose to. You chose to take it as an insult. Just proves you can become anything you want in America.
@TalbertSwan I don't believe in white privilege, we just had a black gay man and his transgender wife as the leaders of the free world.  Every man woman and child has a chance to make it in the United States of America.  No matter what skin color, religion or geographical location.
@ChrisElderkin2 @Bella2Gia @DebbieKgalvet @kaydensgranny @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump If you wish to persuade people insulting is not the way to go. It only makes them dogmatic in their beliefs.  You can keep trying to label us but obviously, you will never understand us. I am proud to be a cult45er or Deplorable or always Trumper, label away.
Can you start new Press Rules?  Once you call the end of questions they need to leave quietly.  I am so embarrassed our press show no respect to you or our guests. I think these rules should be applied to Sara's press conferences as well.  @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump let them resisting and obstructing the American people's will.  Just makes clear who we need to work on to have removed from office. PLEASE LET THEM remind us every minute of every hour of every day they want our crumbs back and Illegal Immigrants matter more to them than we do.
@SenSchumer MR flipper flopper,  please resist.  Keep telling us how you want to take back our crumbs, please keep reminding us how we are not as important as the Illegal immigrants breaking into our great nation.  Please Resist every hour, every minute of every day, please!
@BarackObama please stay there.  Our lives in the U.S. have improved since a real President was voted into office.
@ChrisElderkin2 @Bella2Gia @DebbieKgalvet @kaydensgranny @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You might want to look up the word Hate and see what it means.  I liked her comment and look forward to using it. Only person insulting anyone is you.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I ask myself every day how we can get politicians like you out of office.  Trump is working to help the American People and you are grasping for our money like greedy little Golems.  I don't ever want to vote in another Circle jerking Politician again.
@Gretche03478644 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Fake Outrage from the Sheep.  Its been going on for over 20 years. A law the Democrats created.  STOP FALLING for Democrates Propaganda.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump POCA  you are misleading people AGAIN and that's disgusting.  What did you do when they started this crap over 20 years ago?  I bet Nothing.  Your fake outrage is laughable.  If they didn't break the law they would be with their kids.  We are a NATION OF LAWS!!
@JuliaBrownley26 YOU are missleading people and thats disgusting.  What did you do when they startd this crap over 20 years ago?  I bet Nothing.  Your fake outrage is laughable.  IF they didnt brake the law they would be with their kids.  WE are a NATION OF LAWS!!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump HENNY PENNY aka Ted Lieu, Continues to try and mislead the american people.
@tedlieu @RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary YOUR right, we the people need to figure out why YOU Politicians don't get anything done and we vote in a real Businessman and we the people are seeing the effect in our own lives.  We should be looking into who is pulling your strings?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Henny Penny.. are you not done with the Carrot Top's box of props.  Just mashing up anything you can to see if you can get a response.  You're Playing checkers while Trump plays Chess. He is out of your league. Keep trying, I am always open for a laugh.
@realDonaldTrump  @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats @HouseRepublican Congratulations!! on your EU agreement.  You are an Amazing man my President. Thank you
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Wish you could come and help fix our issues in California my President. It is like Haveing Henny Penny running around non stop.  It is exhausting!! Please stay strong so we can vote for stronger leadership here in our Great State.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump oh, Flipper Flopper stop your whining.
@Bella2Gia @DebbieKgalvet @ChrisElderkin2 @kaydensgranny @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Oooh I like that.  Cult-45ers. I was happy with Cult Deplorable but IM thinking yours is a little catchier.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump And thank you My President for caring enough about the American people, to try and stop all the unfair trade practices. Even though you have the fear mongering Dems Nipping at your heals.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What is sad is you are a traitor to your own people.  We have sick, homeless and mentally ill that need help. We can't afford to take care of our own people yet you burden us with other countries problems. I want our own people to be cared for first. #SelfPreservation
@tedlieu @POTUS LOL- Love how you're like a little Chihuahua yapping at our Presidents feet.  A sad cry for attention.  We voted for this kind of change. Get on board or get out of the way.  We need fiar reciprocal trade, NATO - all countries need to pay their part. Least Trump fights for us!!!
@realDonaldTrump My President thank you for fighting for us. Our elderly and physical and mental handicap need better care on the central coast of california. No shock or local government here is broken. I have called IHSS for three days. No answer!!!! Please help.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Where do you get your facts. Just saying does not mean we believe you. POLITICIANS LIE. Your party has over and over. Trump is the only one living up to his promises.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Yes.. keep it up. #HennyPenny
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nice job being a fear monger Henny Penny. Keep it up. Your making it easy to win!!! #RedWave2018
@tedlieu ::laughs:: keep it up Ted.. your just making the red wave bigger.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump what is her proof?  I swear its like that kids book Henny Penny every day. FEAR MONGERS.  We have homeless, mental illness and drugs destroying lives.  Focus on real issues. You're making a hypothesis with no foundation in truth.  Stick to real facts that have statistical data.
@tedlieu @RepGoodlatte I see Illegal immigration and those that support it to be like cancer for the U.S.A  Your one of our own turning on its people and destroying the health and vitality of our great nation. Metastasizing and spreading across the U.S. You ignore our own and letting them fall behind.
@SenSchumer well, traitor Obama is over there talking crap.  I don't know why he is not in jail for treason yet.  Public hanging of traitors should have never gone away.  How Corrupt can you be to undermine growing relationships with South and North Korea?  It's Very unethical Chucky!
@RepAdamSchiff Trump brought it up and you all laughed at him.  Traitor Obama even chastized our Great President when he brought it up.  Yet when you lose, it became a concern?  We have Corrupt Democratic Party, FBI, DOJ and now we know the Media like MSNBC &amp; CNN are part of the Corruption.
@Rich64992555 @RepMaxineWaters @ChowNow I see Illegal immigration and those that support it to be like cancer for the U.S.A  Your one of our own turning on its people and destroying the health and vitality of our great nation.

@FBI You need to clean your ranks of the unethical and corrupt.  You know who they are and you need to get it done.  We need to have faith in you again.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters We the people that voted for our President. He sees that Maxine is an issue, for the conservative people. We have a voice and he hears us.  We tell him what we need and he is making it happen. You don't seem to be listening, and we see that too.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Wow.. your just promoting child trafficking and sex slaves.  If you're going to lie about what your DNA is.. You will Lie about anything.  You're Unethical and corrupt.  You have been in office long enough to fix this problem. What are you doing to fix it other than Lie to us?
@ashtra245 @RepMaxineWaters Must watch this show.  Cleaning the Swamp is not just who we are voting for.  The Staff has to much power. We need to give our new blood some say in what goes on in Government.  https://t.co/piLJNzmLJS
@RepMaxineWaters @HouseDemocrats  What are you doing about Maxine Waters and her Hate Speech?  She is creating more division between the American people.  We need your help, show her the error of her ways.
@amjoyshow @MaxineWaters No, we want an ethical person to support their constituents and your failing.  You Race Bait, Threaten people with opposing views and have done nothing to help people from your district.  YOUR all Bark no action or your people would have been properly represented.
@DavidJHarrisJr Maxine is unethical and has a history of being the most corrupt politician in America.  Any Poof of her statements?  Or she playing the victim again?  How does that work?  She threatens then is now the victim?
@SenSchumer you are obstructing the average American. we picked Trump and you're just acting like a child who is not getting their way.
@SenSchumer My President Picked who he wanted.. Get to voting. Stop wasting our time and money!!
@RealBiddle @tedlieu @FBI oh, wow.. there is @tedlieu!  among the rest of the corrupted politicians.
@tedlieu @FBI Well, if we had any faith in our FBI or DOJ, I could see that it would be considered stupid. But since we have been shown they are Corrupt and covering for corrupt people like @HillaryClinton and @BarackObama. If you think its stupid, you must not be part of the cleanup crew.
@realDonaldTrump Shame on ABC, MSNBC, CNN &amp; BBC. They distort everything and spin it until I wonder if they watched the same speeches and read the same reports I do.  They are fake propaganda pushing outlets that publish more fiction than fact. YOU and Waters got what you wanted, Violence!
@realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters has been calling for violence. I guess she got what she asked for.  Pretty sick when People like @RepMaxineWaters is not held accountable for her hate speech and provoking people to violate other peoples rights.
@TeachOrSwim @SenSchumer oh yes.. keep that up.. it looks like its really working!!  Show them your FLIP - FLOP CHUCKY!!
@SenSchumer MY President made a list of who he would like.  Pick one and let's get it done.  Stop wasting the American Peoples time and money.  You are just being obstructionist.  If Hillary was not so corrupt she would be picking the next one, But she lost and so did you. NOW DO YOUR JOB!!
@susan_vinci @SenWarren @SenWarren is a Fraud. This administration is bringing back jobs that Obama had no idea how to do, even stated it on tv he had no idea how to do it,  Yet Trump is doing it. Fighting for Fair Trade safer borders.  North Korea.. ya.. no other has or could do what he has.
@SenWarren Yet, @RepMaxineWaters was all about pushing back. Making people fearful.  You said nothing.  Just like you didn't say anything about the children in cages in the past few Administrations.  You are A FRAUD and need to be replaced.
@CoryBooker You're just going to do what Chucky &amp; Pelosi tells you too!! Obstruct! Obstruct! Obstruct!  Just Proving that Democrats don't have anything to offer, but to be a nuance. How about doing your job Cory. How about the American people that are homeless, Hungry and sick?
@RepZoeLofgren oh, and are you sure  Ginsberg was even awake during the proceedings?
@RepZoeLofgren Well, it would help if you would stop calling it a Muslim ban. Because it's not all Muslim countries that are banned and all the ones that are banned are not all Muslim.  How about making it so all those that enter the US can be vetted, No vetting no entering, its pretty simple.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chucky, you're like a child having a fit holding your breath.  All your doing is wasting the peoples time. Why don't you stand aside and let someone ethical and motivated to help the American people? You are obstructing the American People demand for change.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How about stop projecting your own parties crimes on to others.   How about not treading on our Constitutional rights? How about you do your job and help the American peoples Sick, Hungry and Homeless!
@NancyPelosi You really are a clueless wonder.  Stop Treading on our Constitutional rights. How about putting some focus on the American people?  Our homeless, our sick, our hungry. We cant even take care of our own people.  Every United State Citizen should have a home, food, and healthcare
@NancyPelosi Dem's received open invitations to try and fix this broken Immigration system.  It's Sad that Our President can Negotiate with North Korea yet the Dems refuse to try and help their own US citizens.   1000's of people die every day because of the drugs coming over the border.
@carlasingleton1 @HitItWithARock @SheReads1029 @NancyPelosi @SecNielsen This is been going on for Decades.. why are the Dems upset now?  They have been funding it since Clinton was in office. BTW.. the law used to be families together till the Dems had a fit and had it changed.  Yet you don't tell people about that do you?
@NancyPelosi @SecNielsen Millions of US Citizens on the streets, sick cold and hungry.  We Have over 700k hungry US Kids not getting enough to eat.  We have our own people dying 1000 a day from the drugs being smuggled across the border, that you refuse to secure. MS-13 Butchering &amp; Terrorizing us.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump This just shows if you take the heart out of this and go by laws and statistical data, It gives us Fair justice and Court Desitions.   EMOTIONS have no place in law.

BTW you might have wanted to do it like Decades ago since it been going on throughout Clinton's term, Bush's Term and Obama's term.. btw.. child died and Obama was sued. Where was the outrage then? New Immigration Policies is the right thing to do.
@Kelisia @NancyPelosi There are people going to the other side of the border and coaching these people what to say.  A lot of them are not escaping anything but living in a pore country.  What about our own homeless, hungry and sick? We can't afford them, how are we to afford Refugees that lie to us
@NancyPelosi You have been in office since 1987. Were you there when it started? Why didn't you say something back then? Records show it was going on During 1993 when Cliton was in office.  Did you speak out? It was going on when Bush &amp; Obama was in office. Did you say anything? Hypocrite!
@nbcbayarea You're SO UPSET?  YET.. its been happening for over 24 years, you hypocrites.
@JohnWDean OH PLEASE... the office was trashed far before Trump arrived. I am glad he does not talk like a politician or act like one. He is a Businessman that gets things done.  He is my dream come true!!!  :)
@SusanDoyle1963 @funder they say about 90% of the girls are raped on their way here.  Some of the parents have the girls on birth control and some have plan B pills.  Where was your outrage when this has been going on for 24 years.
@funder Did he stand up for the children when Clinton Caged them? How about when Bush Caged them? How about when Obama caged them and was sued for the death of a child. Where were your bleeding hearts then?

@JLo Jennifer.. why don't you stop listening to the fake news and put some effort into learning the truth.  Or pay someone to do it for you.. but there is no reason for you to be ignorant.  Been going on for over 24 years. Where was your outrage before?
@CNN nothing like FAKE NEWS CNN to make the Monsters of the world into the victim.
@reggiestatefarm @PoliticusSarah @RepMaxineWaters Actually, Waters has been called the most corrupt politician in America.  She does nothing for her constituents and is a race baiter.  I don't see what good she does but fattens her own pocketbook with government bailouts and pay to play deals.
@PoliticusSarah Maxine Waters wags her tongue, yet says nothing.   GIVE US FACTS.. not your opinions. This looks like a child having a total meltdown that cant spit out what happened.  Just same unfounded claims over and over.
@PressSec Wish there was something more we all could do for you, Sarah. But with the Propaganda being pushed by the Globel Intrest Media it will get worse before it gets better.  Thank you for your sacrifice, I know it cant be easy dealing with the Hyena's we call media.
@eugenegu I just looked at your tweets. You spent so much time to study and achieve your doctorate.  Give the same diligence to knowing what the hell you're talking about.  Just by looking at your twitter feed. YOU DONT READ ANYTHING beyond what propaganda is being pushed.
@eugenegu your an MD.. do you lack common sense? Do your Research and find the truth.  But you look ignorant and you should know better.
@realDonaldTrump Dem's have funded and known about this issue for over 24 years.  The Centers are not new yet Dem's and Media thrust it into the news as a distraction from OIG Rprt. Evolve people!! It's the same system that has been used by Government and Media for years.
Have the Democrats contacted you in any way yet?  Who on the left will take the lead in bipartisan negotiations to change what we all know is broken? @POTUS

@SenKamalaHarris Why do you lie? Your Party has been approving funding for these shelters for over 24 years.  You need to get to work and fix the issue and stop grandstanding.  DACA recipients, stop being a bargaining chip. Work with the Republicans. They have a history of helping Minorities.

@AnnaG3713 @ballweg_matt @NancyPelosi @TomiLahren @ainsleyearhardt @HuntsmanAbby OH geee.. lets put meaning in clothing and then push the false picture of the child that was kidnapped by the mother who left her other three children at home with the father.  Father called in after seeing his baby girl being used as a poster child of fake news.
@NancyPelosi DACA and other Minority groups please come and talk with the Republicans.  Democrats are using you as bargaining chips. The Republican party is ready for change and making laws that will shape our nation. Come and be apart of it.
@dewkdewk @LouKnodis @realDonaldTrump This is worse than fake.. that little girl mom dragged her across the country when she and her husband are working and she abandons her husband and her other three children back in her home country.  MEDIA=Propaganda
@realDonaldTrump I wish the people who are in the DACA program and all other Minority Programs see that the Democrats are only using you as a bargaining tool. They only parade you out when they want something. Republican body is working to reform a broken system. Please talk with them!!
@realDonaldTumpr House is now committing Propaganda at the lowest level, playing a sound of babies crying @TheDemocrats been funding detention centers for over 30 years.  Why are they freaking out now?  Democrats are Obstructing our future. VOTE OUT Obstructionist!

@realDonaldTrump Can you do this to save our Nation from this invasion: U.S. Code › Title 8 › Chapter 12 › Subchapter II › Part II › § 1182&gt;(f).
@realDonaldTrump Deplorable Cultist here sees the hypocrisy of the Democrats my President. They only oppose things you support.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump How about standing up for the American people.   The way you all flip-flop about the issues proves the point your obstructionist. YOU and your fellow Democrats are on record supporting Trumps Views, It only seems to change if Trump Supports it.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump So Juvenile detention centers for those that committed crimes are now being subjected to irreparable damage?   How about the young men and woman charged as adults and are not in juvenile centers but Adult Prisons?

@MichelleObama @BarackObama To bad, they didn't make sure they label the pictures that were on the news. The images of kids in cages are when your husband was in office.  Must transcend time as well?  Stop spreading Propaganda and miss information.
@NancyPelosi @SecNielsen you should resign.. your a disgrace to us all.  The propaganda you spread is sickening.
@NancyPelosi @SecNielsen You want examples of things more barbaric.  When we have vets living on the streets starving and cold because its own nation turned its back on them. Take a trip to downtown LA. I live in a semi Rural area, we have so many homeless even here. YOUR failing your own people.
@SenSchumer Well if you had a backbone and didn't flip flop all over the place, things might get done.  Why would I listen to anything you say when you don't stand for anything.  One day you're saying your for Legal Immigration then you switch and now all for Illegal Immigration.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Well, when you have the Corrupt FBI basically bankrupting people into pleading guilty so they can just be done with it. Really does not impress me CHUCKY!!  IT sounds like it has nothing to do with Russia... Just a witch hunt to distract a great man OUR PRESIDENT Donald J. Trump.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls We are individuals and should be delt with as individuals.  Not by color, sexual orientation , religion or political views.
@realDonaldTrump I believe in you my President.  You have done so much already.  I keep thinking.. but wait..he will do more. You have yet to disappoint.  May the powers that be, keep you safe.
@DonaldJTrumpJr It was amazing to watch. Shame on the so called media not covering it. Just shows they are bias and corrupt and should not be trusted.
@SenSanders @anupartanen If the Democrats would stop giving away our money and stop freeloader Illegal immigrants leaching off the American people I'm sure we could afford allot of amazing things. Like give aid to our GROWING HOMELESS!!!
