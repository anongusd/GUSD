@freep @therealbakari "Most anyone would agree -- any Eminem fan -- that he went on to create bigger and better substantive work. But as a fun piece of crossover hip-hop-pop music, it's a nostalgic ride," Brian McCollum of @freep says.

@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "The idea that, he may not relinquish power even if he loses it through an electoral process -- it's a scary prospect," @PreetBharara says of Cohen's statements about President Trump on this topic Wednesday.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "The Republicans seemed to have no strategy at all for dealing with this witness," @Fahrenthold says.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "Most of them spent time talking about potential book deals when there were other points to be explored on this very point" of Cohen's claims that Trump speaks in code and whether or not there was explicit direction from Trump to lie, @PreetBharara says of GOP questioning.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "I think people are hoping that we'll find some recording where Donald Trump says, 'OK, let's do collusion now,' and that's probably not going to happen. Even if there was some coordination, we know it's going to play out in little pieces," @Fahrenthold says.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "Among all the pieces of criminal exposure that were talked about yesterday, it seems that's the one that has the most evidence and the most smoke," @PreetBharara says of the Stormy Daniels hush money payment and the question of a re-payment by President Trump.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "This is the beginning of the floodgates opening with respect to investigations," @PreetBharara says.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "Let's be clear: When they call him a liar, they really want to call him an apostate, because he left the inner sanctum of the religious cult and no longer is loyal to the head of the Trump mob," @RepRaskin says of Michael Cohen.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "There's obviously a reason the president doesn't want us to see it, and that's why we must see it," @RepRaskin says of President Trump's tax returns.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "We're making progress against all of these drags on the rule of law and democracy," @RepRaskin says.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "As I said, they weren't upset because he lied to Congress. They were upset because he stopped lying to Congress," @RepRaskin says of his Republican colleagues in the House Oversight Committee and Michael Cohen.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "My Republican colleagues harassed him the whole day as a liar, not bothering to point out that he lied for the president of the United States at his direction," @RepRaskin says of Michael Cohen.
@RepRaskin @Fahrenthold @PreetBharara "He's basically like someone who has left an organized crime family," @RepRaskin says of Michael Cohen. "But he feels emancipated, unburdened and free."

@AngelaStent "You need to measure what you're doing and think about the consequences of possible actions and Russian reactions," @AngelaStent says about sanctions
@AngelaStent "Putin seems to have developed a  pretty clear strategy of what he wanted from the world and is pursuing it," says @AngelaStent
@AngelaStent "I think often the United States does not give Russia and Russians enough respect," @AngelaStent says.
@AngelaStent "When you look back on the Gorbachev years, it really does seem like the golden era of the late Soviet period," @AngelaStent says. "From our vantage point, it really does look like a golden age."
@AngelaStent "This is not a power that's on the rise. It's declining economically, it's declining demographically, and yet it still has the ability to project power in this disruptive way," @AngelaStent says of Russia.
@AngelaStent "The economic fundamentals are really quite bad. The population is declining and it's unclear as to whether or not that can be reversed," @AngelaStent
@AngelaStent "The one area in which Russia has always been able to project its power is through military," @AngelaStent says.
@AngelaStent "Suddenly, when Putin came back, we realized that he was just trying to restore what he believed Russia should be and get rid of what happened in the 1990s," @AngelaStent says.
@AngelaStent "The reason things didn't work out the way we wanted wasn't because they were communist but because they were Russian," says @AngelaStent
@AngelaStent "He has managed to work his way up and command the world stage," @AngelaStent says of Putin.
@AngelaStent "What he learned from Judo is that even if you are smaller and weaker than your opponent, you can still exploit the weaknesses of your opponents," @AngelaStent says of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "If you turn your phone off, that's going to go a long way in avoiding geo-fencing," @evanhalper says.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "Regulators are really struggling to understand what's happening. They're usually looking at regulation after it happened," Stephanie Hankey of @Info_Activism says.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "In the Brexit context, these kinds of techniques were used intensively," Stephanie Hankey of @Info_Activism says.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "I may be seeing completely different ads than people within my own household," @shanegreer	says.		"The world we see is more like the world we want to see, even if it isn't the world the way it is."		Greer says this could erode democratic debate.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "There's clearly huge benefits to this in terms of how you can get your message in front of people," @shanegreer says of campaign tech.		One example might be for candidates without the large budgets or substantial name recognition.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer .@shanegreer says the regulatory environment of the U.S. when it comes to elections is "much more of a free-for-all" than European countries like Germany.		"The breadth of what campaigns can do is huge."
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "They say this is about messaging, and you want to get the right message to the people who it will be the most effective for,"  @evanhalper says of political campaigns' defenses for this type of advertisement targeting.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "Smart TVs are giving out all kinds of new information about you that you may not realize when you go to set one of them up," @evanhalper says.		"You're authorizing data brokers to track every show you're watching."
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "What we're finding is whether it's through apps or the way you're connecting to WiFi ... there's just an immense amount of data on anyone who's using these devices, and that's being used by political campaigns to track you," @evanhalper says.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "You go to the data broker and say, 'I want to target everybody who was in this room, and I want to keep sending them ads,' " @evanhalper says of campaign tech and advertising.
@evanhalper @Info_Activism @shanegreer "It's called building a geo-fence," @evanhalper says of political advertisement targeting at campaign events. "Then you can not only target ads at their phones while they're there, but you can also follow them home and target them there."

Many 18-year-olds who had just become parents themselves," @KO_616 says. "While the politics can swirl around us, centering and understanding the human cost of it all is really important."
@caitielee0917 @ceostroff @KO_616 @KLR_Editor "There were several states that passed protection orders to keep guns away from people who have shown they might be a threat to themselves or others," @ceostroff says. "There are instances that we found with those types of protections. Some of these might've been preventable."
@caitielee0917 @ceostroff @KO_616 @KLR_Editor "They're not just affected by school shootings. It affects them outside of school as well," @ceostroff says of gun violence and its impact on young people.		"Unless people choose to acknowledge it, it's not going to change."

"He made a promise to turn back the clock, and that is a promise that fundamentally can't be kept," @PeteButtigieg says of President Trump and his campaign rhetoric.		"I don't think an honest politics can mention the word 'again.' "
"This is a season for unlikely outcomes," @PeteButtigieg says. "We just had our first reality TV star elected to the office of the presidency."
"This is about building an alliance between generations who believe that it's important to leave the next generation better off," @PeteButtigieg says of his messaging surrounding "intergenerational justice."
"What's wrong with politics that young people who care don't see what it has to offer them?" @PeteButtigieg asks.
"I think if we really want to have more voter participation, for young people and for all people, not only do we have to take measures to make it easier to vote, but also do things to make elections matter more,"@PeteButtigieg says.
"The younger you are, the longer you're planning to be here, the more you have, arguably, at stake with issues like climate change," @PeteButtigieg says.
"The longer I was mayor the more I realized the other side of the job, the symbolic side, just setting a tone, just being a walking avatar of the city, was really important. It had its own substance," @PeteButtigieg says.
This isn't the first time Mayor @PeteButtigieg has been on On Point! He joined the show back when he was a Harvard student, in 2001, discussing trust in our political institutions in the wake of 9/11.		"That is memory lane there," he says.
"It turns out that good government can help secure those freedoms, just as bad government can impair them," @PeteButtigieg says of his messaging for voters.
Have you heard of South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg?		The 37-year-old South Bend, Indiana, mayor is exploring a presidential candidacy.		https://t.co/GVztr2HBQy
"I think more and more the generation can detect insincerity and posturing from a mile away," @PeteButtigieg says. "I think we have an expectation that's classically millennial but maybe classically Midwestern, that you ought to just mean what you say."
"I never would have guessed that local politics and government would be where I found purpose," @PeteButtigieg says.
"I was 29 when I ran," @PeteButtigieg says of becoming South Bend's mayor. "Right around the time Newsweek came to our city and said we were one of 10 dying American cities."		"There were a lot of my people that believed we weren't dying, and wanted to be part of that change."
"A lot of folks may know that Notre Dame is here. What a lot of people might not know is we're typical of a city in the industrial Midwest," @PeteButtigieg says of South Bend.

"Our status as the safest city in the U.S. with a population greater than 500,000 is not solely attributable to a fence put up during the Bush administration," @mayor_margo says.
"I'm concerned about our staffing level of Customs and Border Protection," @mayor_margo says.
What's El Paso really like? @mayor_margo says President Trump has got it wrong. https://t.co/7U807vD4fL
"We are the largest U.S. city on the Mexican border," @mayor_margo says. "We always remained as a safe city."
"There's only about 78 miles of fencing total in the El Paso sector and it's not continuous," @mayor_margo says.
"I don't like to call it a wall, it's a fence," @mayor_margo says of El Paso's border barrier. "It is a barrier. It is part of a border security strategy. But you cannot build a wall from El Paso to Brownsville, Texas."
"What a lot of people aren't talking about is that illegal crossing rates, they plummeted in 1994," which was when the Hold The Line initiative pushed border patrol agents to the Rio Grande," @nachoaguilar says.
"He did pivot noticeably, even from a week ago, from talk of the wall to a broader sense of what he wanted from border security," @nachoaguilar says of President Trump's address in El Paso, Texas, after getting word of a congressional compromise on border security.
"The president, as he took the stage, within a minute he was talking about border security and the wall, but he did allude to the fact that there was some kind of compromise," @nachoaguilar says. "But he kind of brushed it aside."
"ICE has always done this, especially in the Trump era: detained more people than Congress has allowed with funding. While this is a decrease is from what ICE is detaining now, it really brings ICE back in line with what Congress has allowed in funding," @LisaDNews says.
"In the end they just sort of maneuvered around each other and they're just choosing statistics that help them with their base," @LisaDNews says of Republican and Democratic leaders and the compromise.
"As this deal was announced, the two sides sent out details about what was in it, and the numbers were different from Democrats than Republicans," @LisaDNews says.
"It's not clear yet. He hasn't said what he's going to do," @LisaDNews says of how President Trump will handle the deal proposed by congressional negotiators.

@BloomsburyPub "For me it's a terrible tragedy if women -- if all of us -- aren't given opportunities to grow into all that we can be," author Mary Pipher says.
@BloomsburyPub "What I would really like to see happen with this book is that it starts a whole new cultural conversation about the concept of aging and the potentials for growth in this life stage," author Mary Pipher says.
@BloomsburyPub "Certainly there are systemic problems with the way we isolate older people from young people. It's not that I'm saying the culture doesn't need to improve. ... As a psychologist, my interest is in cultivating resilient responses," author Mary Pipher says.
@BloomsburyPub "We're so polarized. We're so into putting people into categories ... that we forget a basic fact of human nature: all of us experience the entire gamut of human emotion," author Mary Pipher says.
@BloomsburyPub "What I wanted to convey by the word 'rowing' is that if we're going to be happy in this life stage, it's going to take some work," author Mary Pipher says.
@BloomsburyPub "The grief of losing siblings, friends, life partners -- there's a lot of challenges, but we also have seven decades of cultivating resources to help us deal with those challenges," author Mary Pipher says. "We're at a point in our lives where we're capable of emergent behavior."
@BloomsburyPub "What I try to say in this book in this life stage is a critical life stage," author Mary Pipher says. "The core concern of this stage is how to cultivate resilient responses to the challenges we face."
@BloomsburyPub "Most older women are deeply engaged with the world around them. They're connected to people, they're caring for people and they're often in the happiest life state that they've experienced," author Mary Pipher says.

@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "Embracing some sort of form of Medicare-for-all is now a litmus test for getting into this race," @CHueyBurns says of the emerging Democratic field for the 2020 presidential election.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "It is an aspect of this that makes some observers ... think there's something really, really serious here if everybody is lying," @JackBeattyNPR says of the indictment of Roger Stone and other Trump associates.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "He's one of the most recognizable figures in Trump's orbit," @CHueyBurns says of Roger Stone. "It's very difficult for Trump to distance himself from Roger Stone given their relationship span goes way back."
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "Even though the president expanded his majority in the Senate, we're looking to see if there are any fault lines in Trump's coalition in the Senate," @CHueyBurns says. "That's going to be critical not only for 2020, but also as we get anything else from the Mueller probe."
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "Such a smackdown. It was amazing to see the Senate -- so many Republicans on board with this, following Mitch McConnell's lead on Syria and Afghanistan, saying, 'No, President Trump. ISIS is still a threat, Afghanistan is still a mess, " @juliemason says.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "It raises questions about whether or not we are headed back into Cold War territory," @CHueyBurns says of the U.S. suspension of the INF Treaty nuclear arms deal with Russia.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "It's never a good thing when you feel like there has to be some kind of an intervention between President Trump and his intelligence chiefs, and that's what we are seeing," @CHueyBurns says.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "It seems like this is the approach that he is pushing forward. His advisers have said that this would be a last resort. It sort of feels like we are at that point," @CHueyBurns says of the border wall and the prospect of a national emergency declaration.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "Rarely in American politics has one seen such rapid self-subversion," @JackBeattyNPR says of public opinion of President Trump following the demand for a border wall and government shutdown.
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "He knows that he can't get this from Congress," @CHueyBurns says of President Trump and a border wall. "What's going to be interesting is what kind of legal challenges this would expose the president to."
@juliemason @CHueyBurns @JackBeattyNPR "He seems so removed from the process. He's so excluded from it," @juliemason says of border security talks and Trump's plans for a wall. "It's felt for a long time like we're headed in the emergency direction."

@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "It's mostly helping higher income students who in many cases may be paying more of the full sticker price," @jselingo says. "It's not necessarily helping affordability."

@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "Family incomes have not been growing at the same rate as the cost of education. The costs of college tuition ... are the highest in terms of how much they've grown since the 1970s. They are far out of sync with inflation," @anya1anya says.
@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "There's so much in here that's about signaling and values," @anya1anya says. "How does a college say, 'I'm going to charge less, and it's not because I'm in financial trouble, it's because I want to be fair and I want to increase access?' "
@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "This move for us was part of a larger strategy that we employed. We were thinking more about where we want to end up," Panayiotis Kanelos of @stjohnscollege says.		The school cut tuition from $52,734 this school year to $35,000 next year.
@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "We had been increasing our tuition year after year by about 3 percent," Panayiotis Kanelos of @stjohnscollege says.

@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "Bottom line, most colleges, by cutting their tuition even significantly, they're not necessarily changing their revenue or their yield per student. In fact it may be going up because they may change the types of students they attract," @anya1anya says.
@anya1anya @stjohnscollege @jselingo "There's been a 9 percent in enrollment overall starting in 2010, so there's just fewer students than there used to be," @anya1anya says.

@DorothyBGilliam "When I first started at the Post in 1961, it was before the newspapers really started to get negative press from the larger country because they had failed to tell the American people about what was happening in any communities besides white communities," @DorothyBGilliam says.
@DorothyBGilliam "I think it's important to realize that the mainstream press totally ignored the black community until after the 1954 Supreme Court ruling that ordered the integration of schools," @DorothyBGilliam says.

@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "Right now I think getting on with investment is much more important than worrying about the debt or deficit," @MIT's Peter Diamond says.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "Addressing climate change is right at the top of things I think we need to do," @MIT's Peter Diamond says.		Here's our segment on a carbon tax from a few weeks ago: https://t.co/3rHINSJFok
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "Social Security, by law, doesn't borrow," @MIT's Peter Diamond says.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "If we want more money for infrastructure, education ... you really have to get a handle on social security and medicare," @Brian_Riedl says. "Which I know is a third rail."
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "It's a lot easier to shift money into capital gains. It's a lot easier to move that money overseas. Rich people who have that much money can decide what form to have that money in," @Brian_Riedl says.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "People say, 'A 91 percent tax rate under Eisenhower didn't kill the economy.' That's because virtually nobody paid those tax rates because the threshold's were so high and there were so many loopholes," @Brian_Riedl says.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "Historically we've had innovation for decades without having the same income inequality," @MIT's Peter Diamond says of the U.S. economy.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "A lot of people who make that much money don't cash it out as taxable income," @Brian_Riedl says of wealthy Americans making at least $10 million, the target population for a 70 percent marginal tax rate increase.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "You're talking $20 billion a year, which sounds like a lot, but that would only close about 6 percent of the budget deficit," @Brian_Riedl says of the money that might be raised from a marginal tax rate increase.
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "By itself is that enough to do what I envision this country needs? No," @MIT's Peter Diamond says of a 70+ percent marginal tax rate for wealthy. "But that is the right place to start."
@AOC @MIT @Brian_Riedl "We've got a real investment shortage here, and we've had it for decades. That is a mistake for the growth of the country," @MIT's Peter Diamond says.

@hooleil 2/ The host, @MeghnaWBUR, condemned those remarks and addressed the issue several times in the remainder of the hour.
Message from On Point: In the second hour today with food critic @hooleil, at 11:30 a.m. ET, we took a call from someone who identified himself as Domenic from Aspen, Colorado. He unexpectedly made racist comments about African-American restaurant patrons.
@hooleil @sfchronicle @raceandfood "There's a lot of class stuff mired in cheese knowledge," @hooleil says.
@hooleil @sfchronicle @raceandfood "I don't expect to be didactic," @hooleil says. "I don't want to write these long scrawls about the housing crisis, but it all factors in. It all matters."
@hooleil @sfchronicle @raceandfood "The premise of introducing politics into food criticism is really funny, because I think the opposite -- the absence of politics is a political choice, as well," @hooleil says.
@hooleil @sfchronicle "Especially with Instagram and of course social media and food porn, a lot of people engage with food as a leisure topic and as a leisure activity, and so they're interested in food criticism," @hooleil of @raceandfood says.
@hooleil @sfchronicle "After I graduated from college, I got jobs in kitchens," @hooleil says. My "perspective is very much informed by that. By knowing how things work behind the scenes."
@hooleil @sfchronicle "For me, that was my entrée into Vietnamese identity, was actually tasting the food and growing up with the food and gaining that palate," @hooleil says.
@hooleil @sfchronicle "I think it was a really natural place to continue doing what I do and focus on the themes I know and love," @hooleil says of San Francisco. "Historically, they have had these big conversations about food and politics."

@jpinsk @newdream "Some of the friction that people ran into often came into the matriarch or patriarch of the family" who'd been giving gifts for a long time and couldn't understand why the family would ditch the tradition, @jpinsk says.
@jpinsk @newdream .@jpinsk discusses one family in west Texas who has fully embraced no-gift Christmas.		They shared "how much fun they were having because they weren't doing all of this stuff."
@jpinsk @newdream "I definitely detected a lot of exhaustion in all of the people I talked to," @jpinsk says of those trying no-gift Christmas.
@jpinsk @newdream "You can't really say there was a single reason that all of them stopped doing it, but I think the thing underlying this is a lot of them just wanted to spend more time together and less time trying to figure out what to get someone," @jpinsk says.

@ceboudreau @cl_kitchens "I can easily teach and train a tobacco farmer how to produce high-CBD industrial hemp with out a lot of retooling. So it just make a logical step," says Chad Wilson, industrial hemp grower and owner of Sacred Seed Farm.
@ceboudreau @cl_kitchens "I lost quite a bit of income off the farm due to weather washing me out," says Chad Wilson, industrial hemp grower and owner of Sacred Seed Farm.		Last year, he lost a lot of his crop and did not have access to insurance.
@ceboudreau @cl_kitchens "This is gonna be actually huge for us, in many ways, having access to crop insurance, making interstate commerce easier," says Chad Wilson, industrial hemp grower and owner of Sacred Seed Farm.
@ceboudreau @cl_kitchens "This has been a priority of his for a number of years," @ceboudreau says of Sen. Mitch McConnell's support for the legalization of hemp. "He considers it a potential boon for Kentucky."
@ceboudreau @cl_kitchens "House Republicans wanted to impose stricter work requirements on between 5 and 7 million people participating in the food stamp program, but that did not go through," @ceboudreau says.

@KGeee @KathleenGerson "We're still talking about this as if it's a woman's problem, rather than a social problem, a problem for all humans," @KathleenGerson says. "It's time that we change the conversation, that we change the metaphor. It's not just about women. It's about all of us."

@KGeee @KathleenGerson "We can read, we can give ourselves tools and understand the value of speaking up for ourselves, but a lot of times when that's not enough, it has led women to internalize their own discrimination and say, 'I must've not done this right,' " @KGeee says.
@KGeee @KathleenGerson "These are skills that many of these women don't get from home," Anna Dapelo-Garcia says of building confidence, voice and negotiating abilities.
@KGeee @KathleenGerson "There's a catchphrase that we're continuing to use in this around having a choice to have it all. And for many women, especially with Latinas having the largest wage gap, it's not a choice," says Anna Dapelo-Garcia.		"It's what we have to do to try to do it all."
@KGeee @KathleenGerson "I had bought into this idea that if I just worked a little bit harder and negotiated a little bit better, the world would work out for me," @KGeee says. "And that's just not true."
@KGeee @KathleenGerson "It is not just about self-success," says Anna Dapelo-Garcia, founder and president of Lean In Latinas. "Lean in Latinas is about the success of everybody in the network."
@KGeee @KathleenGerson "'Lean in' for me has never been about telling women they can have it all. I agree that's not the solution," says Anna Dapelo-Garcia, founder and president of Lean In Latinas. "I had to figure out how to do it all as a single mother on limited income."

@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "The hope is that these really extreme events don't become normalized," @ClarkPolar's Karen Frey says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "This is the 13th time that the Arctic Report Card has been released and I don't see it going away any time soon," @ClarkPolar's Karen Frey says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the globe," @ClarkPolar's Karen Frey says.		"You're creating a jetstream that is loopy and slow, &amp; that means at lower latitudes you can transition back &amp; forth between extremely warm &amp; extremely cold temperatures."
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "You don't have to be in the Arctic to experience Arctic change," George Divoky (@CooperIslandAK) says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "The Arctic is the canary in the coal mine. This rate of change is unprecedented and it may well be happening at lower latitudes soon," George Divoky (@CooperIslandAK) says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity It has been that Arctic warming and that Arctic melt that has changed this global atmospheric circulation pattern," George Divoky (@CooperIslandAK) says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "There's a really tightly linked ecosystem in these areas," @ClarkPolar's Karen Frey says. "We're seeing unraveling, with these massive changes in the physical environment -- all of the ecosystem responses."
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "Basically the population has to either adapt or go instinct," George Divoky (@CooperIslandAK) says of bird populations in the Arctic.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "This is no longer the Arctic, it is now the sub-Arctic," George Divoky (@CooperIslandAK) says.
@CooperIslandAK @ClarkPolar @ClarkUniversity "We're really transitioning toward a thinner, more vulnerable, less stable ice cover," @ClarkPolar's Karen Frey says. "We're transitioning from a white Arctic to a blue Arctic."		This marks a transition from heat reflection to heat absorption.
