"The report also said that Zuberi belatedly registered as a consultant to the government of Sri Lanka, as required by law under the Foreign Agents Registration Act."
"Zuberi‚Äôs habit of trading on his political connects veered into his role as an agent for a foreign gov't....the Times said that in 2015, ‚Äúthe scandal-plagued gov't of Sri Lanka paid a total of $6.5M to Zuberi...to have included seeking to influence the American gov't.‚Äù
"Mr. Zuberi‚Äôs co, Ave Ventures, acts as a consultant and has offices in China and the UAE, w/investments in India and Bahrain. The donation apparently generated coveted invitations to black-tie dinners and photo ops w/the US pres and some of his high-ranking officials..."

The fact this guy is based out of L.A., tells me that either Broidy or Barrack set him in front of Cohen and Trump.		Possibly even Dana Rohrabacher, since Zuberi donated to him as well.

"Sri Lanka paid [Imaad Zuberi] $4.5M directly and $2 million to a company he co-owned for consulting work that included influencing the U.S. government. And he didn‚Äôt properly disclose to the United States the extent of his arrangement with Sri Lanka, the report said."
