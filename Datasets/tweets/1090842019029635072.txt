@KLeswing @KamalaHarris My teachers did not help me take that road to healthcare. I made that choice. Teachers are very important, however are not any more dedicated than the rest of the workforce.  There are good teachers and teachers who could care less.
RT @jeffreysadezwi1: Ok everyone who follows me and to everyone who does not I need a favor I need you all to retweet this to try and brake‚Ä¶
@KLeswing @KamalaHarris I‚Äôm sure you work hard as well but the degree of liability and stress in healthcare far outweighs the job of a teacher. No offense. I would have loved to go into teaching but I chose to make more money therefore a job with more stress.
@KLeswing @KamalaHarris How many months do you have off a year? I‚Äôm a healthcare worker and we also have to bust our butt and continue education on our own time, work holidays. I‚Äôm sure you work hard but you do not work a full year and should not get paid for 12 months
@KamalaHarris They work 8 months out of the year but want to get paid for 12?
@hafaton @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs not racism. Why is it racism?

@210RaisedMe @ChrisJZullo @KamalaHarris McDonald‚Äôs jobs are not meant to support a family. I get what your saying
@210RaisedMe @ChrisJZullo @KamalaHarris Don‚Äôt give up! I moved out at 17 and all student loans in my name. Just pick a trade or research your degree and see what is lucrative. Best of luck to you!!!
@210RaisedMe @ChrisJZullo @KamalaHarris Everyone can get a student loan unless you have defaulted on a prior loan. The problem is that kids don‚Äôt go to a 2 year college first and then transfer. Not to mention worthless degrees, pick a degree that is lucrative in the work force
@210RaisedMe @FluffyK1tt3n105 @ChrisJZullo @KamalaHarris I was a single mom and went to college. I lived without many wants and settled for needs. The prize st the end was worth every sacrifice I made.
@Jamesabides1 @KamalaHarris Bull
@210RaisedMe @ChrisJZullo @KamalaHarris Then go to college
@KamalaHarris And they never will if you are president. You will tax the hell out of us and aren‚Äôt you supporting restitution for slavery? So if you are white that‚Äôs another tax you will add on
