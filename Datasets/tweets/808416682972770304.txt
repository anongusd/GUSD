President Bush exemplified true public service, opting to do what he believed was right for the nation over what was politically expedient. This has always been the hallmark of our government, and he and First Lady Barbara Bush practiced it every day.
Today, I join the nation in mourning the passing of President George H. W. Bush and honor the long legacy of his service. We have lost a true patriot who put his country first both on the battlefield during World War II and as a public servant.

For Arizona’s future, we must promote conservation practices that allow our farmers and ranchers to conserve water in a way that is fair and equitable, by ensuring there is necessary funding. #AZ01 #FarmBill
For Arizona’s forests, we must create a restoration economy that will grow jobs and provide value to rural communities, while reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. #AZ01 #FarmBill
For Indian Country, we must promote tribal self-determination and sovereignty in forestry, nutrition, and education. We must also ensure that tribes are heard at USDA by the continued presence of the Office of Tribal Relations in the Office of the Secretary. #AZ01 #FarmBill

My office partnered w/ the Veterans Upward Bound Program to help Pinal Co. vets get started in college. Keeping our promises to those who served our nation is a top priority for me. I'm eager to promote higher ed for vets who choose to pursue it. #AZ01 https://t.co/0Jewff7SdX

Today’s meeting and press conference were a slap in the face to all of the brave men and women in our military and civilian intelligence agencies as they work to get to the bottom of Russia’s efforts to meddle in our elections. #AZ01 https://t.co/c2eYIIykXM
There should be no scenario where the President of the United States stands up on the international stage and denounces the work of our nation’s intelligence community while praising a foreign leader who has so blatantly ordered an attack on our very democracy. #AZ01
#AZ01 families don't care about partisan ideology, but about good-paying jobs, a strong economy, &amp; a safe community to raise their children. I don't believe either party has all the answers, so I'm committed to reaching across the aisle to find solutions. https://t.co/shdlNoWJwf https://t.co/GIjRmFRFgd
During my visits across #AZ01, I have the privilege of delivering surplus @LibraryCongress books to public schools &amp; libraries. I joined my staff this week to pick out some books that I can bring with me during my upcoming visits. https://t.co/MpObtkcFqC
Vets in rural areas face more barriers to quality care than vets in urban areas. Securing high quality care for all vets is essential in rural #AZ01 &amp; across America. Read my op-ed in the @WMIcentral to learn how I'm taking action on this issue: https://t.co/pteFeP77xT

Learn more about my Taxpayers DIME Act here: https://t.co/1vEqW5EOXN
I intro'd the Taxpayers DIME Act to prevent this kind of waste of taxpayer dollars. No gov't official, regardless of party, should use tax $$ to charter private jets or fly first-class. Mr. Price should repay the American people the full amount that HHS deemed wasteful. #AZ01 https://t.co/77bXihX0nv
As a former police officer, I saw the horrifying effects. Research into commonsense violence and death prevention is crucial. Yesterday's vote to strip the CDC of funds to research gun violence and deaths is disappointing. #AZ01 https://t.co/p0gD8o12x2
“So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.” - Matthew 7:12		Today we celebrate the #NationalDayofCivility. Respect and tolerance is something every member of Congress should commit to practicing. At the end of the day we are all Americans. #AZ01 https://t.co/qKgBlkaM5W

2/3 I'm deeply concerned and disappointed by @USTradeRep's announcement of an additional $200 bn in tariffs on Chinese goods. I worry that it will spark an even greater backlash that will devastate rural America and #AZ01. Congress must check these harmful trade policy.
1/3 Our rural communities are the backbone of #AZ01's economy. They make up the very fabric of our nation. While much of their success relies on trade, this Administration seems hell-bent on making it harder for them to get cotton, beef, pecans, &amp; other products to market.

Fortunately for rural America, the House voted against these cuts &amp; protected EAS today. Yesterday, the House voted unanimously for my amendment to ensure the Comptroller General provides Congress with an economic analysis of any future reforms to EAS 👇 https://t.co/D40u4lt2dM
Cutting EAS would be neither kind nor easy for the Americans living in rural communities across the nation. It will make efforts by these communities to bring in new businesses, strengthen their local economies, and attract families to live and work even more difficult.
My colleague from California believes cutting Essential Air Service (EAS) would be the "kindest and easiest cut Congress could make.

Now is the time for the President to stand by his commitment and actually drain the swamp. I hope he will hold his Administration officials accountable and work with any ongoing investigations.
We are here to serve the American people, not reap benefits or reward our friends at the expense of hardworking men and women. We must be held to the highest standard.
The recent allegations against Scott Pruitt are so far the most troubling.		He's used your tax dollars to:	- fly first-class and chartered flights	- rent a DC condo from a lobbyist &amp; donor	- pay for unprecedented 24-hour security	- give raises to his closes aides without approval
I am disheartened by the news that has come out over the past year about the rampant abuse of power in Washington and how little the President has done to put an end to it.
A few thoughts on the unfolding scandals surrounding EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt:		I have agreed with @realdonaldtrump’s calls for reform and accountability in Washington. 1/

The President should unite us, but his divisive language distracts us from our goals. We need to focus on bringing stability to DREAMers and passing comprehensive immigration reform to strengthen our communities.
They have come from every corner of the world, contributing to our culture, shaping our traditions, and making us the greatest nation in the world. The President should apologize for his disparaging, vulgar remarks about the countries from which immigrants arrive on our shores.
The strength of our nation and the very idea of the American Dream are rooted in the longstanding notion that we are a country built by immigrants seeking a new life.

Today I gave a speech urging my colleagues to work together on health care. We must fix it; not nix it. Watch: https://t.co/7KarLqNssP #AZ01 https://t.co/PUIFizdlvy
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix it, not nix it.
We need to include the public in this health care debate. We owe them a better plan.
We must work together to stabilize the insurance markets and develop a long-term solution that improves our health care system.
These are our children, our loved ones, our family and friends. We cannot stand here and play politics with their health care.
More than 1 million Arizonans with pre-existing conditions would lose vital protections that ensure they have access to affordable coverage.
The brave men and women who fought to defend our country, could lose their coverage because of this proposal.
1.9 million Arizonans who rely on Medicaid could be at risk of losing their coverage.		Of those, more than 45,000 are Arizona veterans.
It will send premiums and coverage costs skyrocketing and slash funding to rural and tribal health clinics, forcing them to close.
The newest repeal plan is irresponsible and will endanger the health and well-being of my constituents.
While the Senate’s misguided repeal and replace proposal has been defeated, we cannot rest.
Arizonans I have spoken with are stressed and anxious as they watch politicians in Washington threaten to take away their health coverage.

If we want to get serious about fixing our #healthcare system &amp; bringing down costs, we must work together on bipartisan legislation. (9/9)
While we play partisan games, the health and wellbeing of our families, friends, and neighbors is at risk. #SenateHealthCareBill
From the beginning, these pieces of legislation have been crafted behind closed doors w/o input from doctors, nurses &amp; #healthcare leaders.
Meaning hundreds of thousands of people, including nursing home patients, who rely on life-saving coverage will be kicked off #Medicaid.
Recent reports show the cost of #Medicaid cuts in this bill could cost #Arizona more than $7 billion.
The cost of this legislation will be paid by those who can least afford it.
We're placing our working families, our elderly, veterans, &amp; Native Americans in harm’s way by making coverage unaffordable &amp; unattainable.
This bill, like the #AHCA, proposes drastic cuts to #Medicaid and would saddle my constituents with skyrocketing premiums and deductibles.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep misgivings about the recent #healthcare proposal put forth in the #Senate.
Tune into @cspan a little after 9am to hear my concerns about the Senate #BetterCare Act. https://t.co/BsjbNobFbK #AZ01
