@ToddBrody This number includes these individuals and their descendants. UNRWA follows the same rules of derivative refugee status as other UN and refugee agencies, including UNHCR, where descendants of refugees are registered as refugees until they receive a just and durable solution.
@ToddBrody Great question, @ToddBrody. It's because many Palestinians were made refugees from their homes in 1948. These Palestinians were originally from Be’er Sheva, Yaffa, and other places north and east of Gaza in and were forcibly displaced to Gaza during the Nakba.

“Palestinian refugees, now totaling nearly 6 million, are entering their seventh decade of statelessness and exile, and constitute the world’s longest-lasting refugee situation.” And the US just cut all funding to @UNRWA. #FundUNRWA https://t.co/Mk9HS655AO
Thank you to our host committee, fundraisers, and volunteers in our local DMV community that have come together for the 2018 DC #Gaza5K! We are humbled by and appreciative of your commitment to the life, dignity, and mental health of Palestine refugees. https://t.co/DXHcTUD5bD

On #LetsTalkUNRWA @UNRWA's Dr. Seita puts on his Gaza marathon tshirt in solidarity with DC Gaza 5K participants. He is unable to participate in the event, but plans on running 5K in Jerusalem to show his thanks to the American people who are running for refugees in Gaza on 9/22! https://t.co/2AMAswJiJH
On #LetsTalkUNRWA, Dr. Seita shares an inspirational photo of art created by a Palestine refugee in Gaza who used painting as a way to cope with trauma and stress following @UNRWA staff encouragement. https://t.co/QbuI9vG5Dm
On #LetsTalkUNRWA: "We had a child in 2014 who lost all her family members in the Israeli assault. The @UNRWA counselor and principal worked with her. We cannot replace the family but we hope to protect her future. After time, she became more engaged in school again." -Dr. Zaqout
“I’ve worked in other disaster contexts. People generally have a recovery phase once the war is over. The best healer is that people go back to a normal life, but there is no normal life for people to go back to in Gaza." - Dr. Zaqout on #LetsTalkUNRWA speaking on mental health
On the impact of the US decision to cur all funding to @UNRWA: "The disruption of UNRWA has a big impact on Palestine refugees because it symbolizes their identity. It is one of the few sources of resilience for Palestine refugees.” - @UNRWA's Dr. Iyad Zaqout on #LetsTalkUNRWA
“It’s important for people to know the psychological context of Gaza. We live in a world of uncertainty. @UNRWA is one of the sources of resilience for Palestine refugees. It’s one of the only relatively reliable services and is a model for others." - Dr. Zaqout on #LetsTalkUNRWA
UNRWA Director of Health Dr. Seita: “Non-communicable diseases like diabetes are a great concern for @UNRWA staff. It’s not because they eat junk food; it’s because they are poor and do not have access to healthy food and exercise like you and I.” #LetsTalkUNRWA
"The children don’t have playground facilities. They are very important for the children’s mental and physical development. @UNRWA counselors are staying in a new after-school play program to help decrease the children’s stressors." - @UNRWA's Dr. Iyad Zaqout on #LetsTalkUNRWA
On #LetsTalkUNRWA LIVE: "The health of Palestine refugees is not just access to health services but access to life. It's not just physical health but it’s mental health and a healthy lifestyle." This is what @UNRWA health professionals are trying to address in their programming
.@UNRWA's Health Director Dr. Seita responding to the impact of the funding crisis on health services: "All our primary health services still ongoing. But if the funding crisis continues, it could affect health services — something we’ve been doing for 68 years." #LetsTalkUNRWA
"In field visits, I’ve seen @UNRWA health services in person. What I find interesting is that the doctors are refugees themselves so they know very intimately the issues they are dealing with, especially mental health." @lailamo on #LetsTalkUNRWA https://t.co/cHfPLrzbHA
.@UNRWA Health Director Dr. Seita: "We are using a modern, comprehensive approach to our @UNRWA healthcare provision. We use a family health approach in all medical health centers. We have 144 clinics and 500 doctors covering 5.4 million refugees." #LetstalkUNRWA
.@UNRWA Health Director Dr. Seita on #LetsTalkUNRWA: UNRWA provides primary health care for 5.4 million Palestine refugees including maternal care, treatment for NCD's, general care, oral healthcare, physical therapy in Gaza, and mental health care for those in conflict.
We're LIVE on Facebook for Ep 5 of #LetsTalkUNRWA. UNRWA USA's @lailamo is speaking to our @UNRWA colleagues Dr. Seita and Dr. Zaqout about UNRWA's health program, its impact, and how it has been impacted by the funding crisis. Join us + ask questions: https://t.co/cHfPLrzbHA

"Education at a young age shapes people’s whole lives. When you see children you can have a glimpse of the future, and significantly, you can shape the future if you take the right approach. That’s what’s happening with @UNRWA education in the Gaza Strip." @MohEid1 #LetsTalkUNRWA

UNRWA USA supporters can help protect the fundamental right to education for 526,000 Palestine refugee girls and boys. Your $100 donation can cover the education costs of an @UNRWA student for a month + a #backtoschool kit: https://t.co/Rqynlvly6c #FundUNRWA https://t.co/AYVNpJJ2F7
There's no guarantee @UNRWA schools will remain open. Despite reducing the deficit to $217M since the funding crisis began in January, no additional large-scale contributions have come in, so UNRWA only has enough funding to run its services until the end of September. #FundUNRWA

"We walked outside and I saw the bulldozer come towards my house and knock down houses nearby too. It was the first time I had ever seen every grown up in my village helpless. We ran away. We don’t have hotels, so we went to @UNRWA schools to stay in classrooms." - @MohEid1
"I remember the first military assault. I woke up to the sounds of tank engines. You cannot sleep. There was shooting and you can't go outside. They were followed by bulldozers that drove through the camps and made their own roads knocking down homes." - @MohEid1 on life in #Gaza
"My family was displaced to #Gaza from the north. Gaza Strip is 8 refugee camps and we were in Rafah Camp. The only reason we survived was @UNRWA. We used to receive food assistance and support." - Mohammed Eid at @MiddleEastInst speaking on the role of UNRWA in his life in #Gaza

"Flour was the most important part of the @UNRWA food package. In #Gaza, we start baking first thing in the morning and you wake up with the smell of bread wafting through the streets. My favorite meal is dipping bread into tea." - @MohEid1 shares his story at @PalestineCenter

As we commemorate #WorldRefugeeDay, we reflect on what it means to be a #Palestine #refugee in 2018. In #Jordan, it means a challenging life and the fear of being forgotten, as poverty grows and unemployment rises.
As we commemorate #WorldRefugeeDay, we reflect on what it means to be a #Palestine #refugee in 2018. In #Lebanon, it means living in overcrowded camps with dire living conditions, facing systemic challenges of access to employment and business opportunities.
As we commemorate #WorldRefugeeDay, we reflect on what it means to be a #Palestine #refugee in 2018. In #Syria, it means being trapped in a brutal armed conflict, deprived of access to water, food, electricity, and basic healthcare.
As we commemorate #WorldRefugeeDay, we reflect on what it means to be a #Palestine #refugee in 2018. In the West Bank, it means living under occupation, structual and physical violence, and lack of economic, social, and educational opportunities.
As we commemorate #WorldRefugeeDay, we reflect on what it means to be a #Palestine #refugee in 2018. In #Gaza, it means being subject to a decade-long blockade and humanitarian crisis, resulting in 1 million people dependent on @UNRWA food assistance.
Today on #WorldRefugeeDay we commemorate the strength, courage, and resilience of millions of refugees worldwide. We'd like to specifically honor @UNRWA's staff of 30,000 refugee teachers, doctors, and mental health counselors, as they serve and support their fellow refugees.

Now a huge strain on health sector in Gaza due to the funding crisis, and @UNRWA is absorbing that. Hospitals are overstretched and don't have capacity. UNRWA is providing prosthesis and physical rehabilitation, adding a $10 million deficit to its work. #WeRise2018

"UNRWA USA is hosting an #iftarforgaza in NYC and DC. If you're in the area, join us for an opportunity to give back and do more for Palestine refugees in #Gaza." - @abbysmardon on how Americans can support refugees in #Gaza on today's #LetsTalkUNRWA
"Americans can support @UNRWA's emergency food assistance program by making a Zakat certified #Ramadan donation. Also by hosting a charitable #iftarforgaza, supporters can ensure food assistance in Gaza can continue for the entire year." - @abbysmardon on #LetsTalkUNRWA
"We are a peaceful people and want a dignified life." @Adnan_Hasna on #Gaza's message to the world. #LetsTalkUNRWA
"Currently, @UNRWA cannot guarantee food in the fourth quarter of the year. Can you imagine what it would be like if 1 million people do not receive food assistance in #Gaza?" - @matzschmale on #LetsTalkUNRWA from #Gaza. Donate to provide food assistance: https://t.co/LJT3t0ENDo
"We cannot guarantee the opening of the new school year because we lack 3-4 month’s worth of staff salaries. What’s at risk are our core services — education and healthcare." - @matzschmale commenting on the @UNRWA funding crisis as a result of the US decision to cut funding
"Ramadan this year in #Gaza will be the most difficult in history. I don't know how people will survive, and it will affect the poor the most. I hope that we at @UNRWA can get the funds for Ramadan to provide essential food assistance." -@Adnan_Hasna #LetsTalkUNRWA
"I’ve worked in places where food insecurity is caused by drought. I have never been in a situation where it is caused by a blockade. People lack the means to buy food. @UNRWA provides emergency food assistance to 1 million refugees in #Gaza." -@matzschmale #LetsTalkUNRWA
"There is less than 4 hours of interrupted electricity per day. @UNRWA staff go home worried if their food has gone rotten because their refrigerator was not functioning. Kids do their schoolwork by candlelight and don't know it's normal to have electricity." #LetsTalkURNWA #Gaza
"In #Gaza, the main issue is the blockade. It is a prison cut off from the world. There is so much economic and business potential here, but there is no opportunity. It is not normal to have only one border crossing point that people can rarely access." #LetsTalkUNRWA from #Gaza
"There are about 1000 @UNRWA IT graduates per year. #GazaGateway connects people with skills to those outside the blockaded strip. The one thing the blockade hasn't stopped is the internet, but that's just a few people. 65% of the youth are unemployed." #LetsTalkUNRWA from #Gaza
"We have a lot of heroes among our @UNRWA staff. Not only because of the fantastic job they do but heroes because of they way the cope and the way they support those beyond their family." - @matzschmale on the Palestine refugee staff in #Gaza #LetsTalkUNRWA
The environment and the economy are collapsing in #Gaza. The equivalent of 42 olympic pools of sewage go into the ocean every day, resulting in the death of one child a day on average from swimming in the contaminated water. #LetsTalkUNRWA
"People cannot leave Gaza due to the land, air, and sea blockade. We've reached a level that there is no tomorrow in Gaza and there is frustration, hopelessness, disappointment, and a feeling of abandonment by the intl community." - @Adnan_Hasna #LetsTalkUNRWA
"As a Palestinian and a refugee, I was shocked by the number of fatalities. Gaza will suffer for the rest of their lives. There is also a huge psychosocial need. This comes on top of the trauma from the 2014 Israeli assault." - @Adnan_Hasna and @matzschmale on #LetsTalkUNRWA
"When you talk about #Gaza, you're talking about refugees. More than 80% of the population are refugees." -@Adnan_Hasna from @UNRWA's Gaza Field Office #LetsTalkUNRWA

To address the @UNRWA funding shortfall, there was a ministerial conference in Rome, hosted by foreign ministers and with @UN Secretary-General @antonioguterres. There was extraordinary support to the work @UNRWA does and the need in this moment. - Peter Mulrean #LetsTalkUNRWA
"This is when you feel that it's real. This is the impact you get to have on @UNRWA's work on the ground [from the US]," says Peter Mulrean on why he is fundraising and running the NYC #Gaza5K tomorrow 3/24, recorded on today's episode of #LetsTalkUNRWA.
"You only have to look at the work @UNRWA does to know what's at stake. There are 5 million girls and boys going in school, over 3 million people depending UNRWA for healthcare, and 1.7 million food insecure people depending on UNRWA for food." - Peter Mulrean #LetsTalkUNRWA
RT @magsmitchell: #FundUNRWA! https://t.co/IhcQSqraSB
"You can’t have the largest humanitarian actor in #Gaza [@UNRWA] and tie its hands behind it’s back. You can’t take the funding away from them and expect a humanitarian crisis in Gaza can be dealt with easily." - Peter Mulrean from @UNRWA in NYC on today's #LetsTalkUNRWA
"Looking at #Gaza is the easiest place to see what's at stake in the face of the @UNRWA funding crisis. You’re talking about an area that is already suffering from economic degradation and the psychological effects of 10 years of blockade." - Peter Mulrean on #LetsTalkUNRWA

The UNRWA Girls’ School in Jalazone, with over 1,000 students, is one of the largest in the West Bank. #unrwalive
The school’s location is a big protection concern due to the clashes and the Israeli military presence around the settlement. #unrwalive
The UNRWA Jalazone Boys’ School is located just outside the camp in Area C + rests directly opposite the Beit El settlement. #unrwalive
Clashes occur almost daily and sometimes result in the Israeli Security Forces (ISF) entering the camp. #unrwalive
The ongoing expansion of Beit El has been a catalyst for intensified confrontations b/w camp residents + Israeli security forces. #unrwalive
~9,450 refugees live in Jalazone camp - they originate from 36 villages in Lydd, Ramleh, Haifa and in the area west of Hebron. #unrwalive

Amidst the protection crisis in the West Bank, UNRWA does critical work in places like Shu’fat which lies on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
Protection challenges resulting from the occupation, from home demolitions to settler violence, increasingly affect refugees’ daily life.

.@BoSchack1, Director of UNRWA Operations in Gaza, on the importance of Summer Fun Weeks to Palestine refugee children. https://t.co/uwy76SUg0Z
Dealing with mental health is very different in minority communities, making care accessible is crucial, which is some of UNRWA's work.
In Gaza, almost 200K children signed up for UNRWA Summer Fun Weeks, a series of activities to give kids a chance to be kids.
UNRWA provides mental health counselors to help an entire generation of Palestine refugees cope with the traumas they face.
Post-assault, nearly all children experienced PTSD - a mental health disorder which makes integrating into society difficult.
Today marks the three year anniversary of the 2014 assault on Gaza, but the aftermath is still felt in Palestine refugees' day-to-day life.
Thanks to @ZakatUS's generosity, UNRWA USA has teamed up with them to rebuild houses that were destroyed in the 2014 Gaza assault https://t.co/gxDNlnJzyx

@UNRWA We will continue to stand with Palestine refugees, no matter what, until they receive a just and durable solution to their plight.
@UNRWA For decades, generations of Palestinians -- refugees and non-refugees -- have persevered as their rights are repeatedly violated. https://t.co/t0pXYldvPe
@UNRWA New refugee camps were established to house the newly displaced Palestinians. Many still live in these camps today.
In 1967, @UNRWA had already been providing services to the 750,000+ Palestine refugees displaced by the Nakba for 17 years.
Some 400,000 Palestinians fled from the West Bank and Gaza, mainly to Jordan and Syria. 50 years later, the Israeli occupation continues. https://t.co/0eCUvjcmvG
Many of the Palestinians displaced by the 1967 war were already registered refugees, and so they suffered displacement for a second time. https://t.co/KaqdddtG5W

Why the #Gaza5K? Because children and adults alike continue to experience trauma from recurring Israeli assaults and the blockade on Gaza.
Why are we moving for mental health at the #Gaza5K? Because every child age 10+ in Gaza has witnessed death, destruction, and displacement.

More than 95% of Palestine refugees who remain in Syria are relying on @UNRWA to survive. You can help them: https://t.co/AsOyuQQ2LT
71% of the over half a million Palestine refugees registered with 	@UNRWA there have been displaced.
Palestine refugees in Syria are among the worst affected by the ongoing and brutal war.
UNRWA is providing Palestine refugees in Syria w/ emergency food assistance, healthcare, shelter, and helping children re-enroll in schools.
In early February, 200 Palestine refugee families in Syria were displaced from Jamleh, Ash Shajarah, Koya, Tassil into Muzeirib, and Jilin.
The violence in Jilin is part of a larger pattern of population displacement caused by increased fighting in the south of Syria.
It can take up to 8 hours on a dangerous road - periodically closed - for Palestine refugees to travel to Dera’a city to receive services.
The two UNRWA schools in the village of Jilin have been forced to close, but UNRWA is still providing emergency education in Syria.
Since February 12, 2,500 UNRWA students in the Dera'a district have missed an average of two weeks of school due to the violence.
UNRWA estimates that over 90% of the Palestine refugee families have fled the village of Jilin, near Dera'a, Syria, since February 20.
Through it all, @UNRWA remains committed to providing uninterrupted access to life-saving services to Palestine refugees across Syria.
We are devastated by the situation in Syria and echo @UNRWA's demand that all parties comply with their obligations under international law.
We need your help to ensure our #UNRWA colleagues in Syria can keep saving lives: https://t.co/AsOyuQQ2LT https://t.co/ycoszdMqOM

Dozens from the refugee camp have found employment because of Jameleh's innovative ways. And she is just getting started!
These projects Jameleh started through her community-based organization generate much-needed income for the community.
Constantly paying it forward, Jameleh used the profits from the lunch program to start a kindergarten, and then a guesthouse.
With UNRWA's support, Jameleh transformed a small cooking project in Aqbat Jaber, her refugee camp, into a healthy school lunch program.

.@UNRWA's Cash-for-Work program is so important because it mitigates the socioeconomic effects of occupation all across the oPt. #UNRWAlive

Asmahan told us the same thing we've heard repeatedly here in Gaza: people don't want handouts, and there are not enough jobs. #UNRWAlive
We met Asmahan at an @UNRWA food distribution center. She's one of 53K Palestine refugees temporarily employed by UNRWA in Gaza. #UNRWAlive https://t.co/zJCpdB1u4V

Gaza is under Israeli and Egyptian blockade. The 10 year blockade results in severe shortages of clean water, electricity, jobs. #UNRWAlive https://t.co/fbmKYkMvST
