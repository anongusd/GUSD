From my family to yours, we wish you all a very Merry Christmas! To those who are serving away from their families and friends this holiday, thank you. #SecDef Mattis captures my thoughts and feeling perfectly. https://t.co/tDozX5ZLsg
This first consequence of @POTUS' decisions is the resignation of Secretary #Mattis. There will be more: safe havens for ISIS and the Taliban, expansion of Russian &amp; Chinese influence (Iranian too), &amp; our allies will question our commitment. Nothing positive will come of this.
The rash withdrawal of forces from #Syria &amp; #Afghanistan isn't based on a sound strategic plan. It isn‚Äôt clear on what these decisions are based. Doing so sends the wrong signals to allies &amp; adversaries alike, &amp; will have serious long-term consequences for our national security.
Secretary Mattis served his country with honor. His resignation is a loss to our country‚Äôs leadership; his counsel to @POTUS, cool head, and steady hand will be sorely missed.
It is critical that we push back against Chinese IP theft, intelligence operations, &amp; economic war against the United States. These indictments are just the latest in a multifaceted effort to combat China‚Äôs activities in &amp; against the U.S. 	https://t.co/Mtw0JXkrPQ
This decision gives fodder to those who question America‚Äôs commitment to our allies in the region and around the world. Let‚Äôs hope the Pentagon can change @POTUS‚Äô mind and reverse this decision.
There's a huge difference between degraded &amp; defeated; ISIS isn't defeated. Its capabilities are degraded, but it's still a threat. @POTUS claiming victory &amp; pulling our forces out repeats the mistakes of the past, risks a resurgent ISIS, &amp; hands a win to Assad, Erdoƒüan, &amp; Putin.

P.S. Admiral McRaven is a proven exceptional leader.
Operation Neptune Spear &amp; the intel activities that led to its launch is a model of how our government should work &amp; how leaders should behave, which is more than can be said for what‚Äôs happening today.
The operation was well planned, well executed, &amp; done with bipartisan support at the White House &amp; in Congress (I should know, I oversaw the entire intel process through execution after assuming the chair of intel committee).
To criticize Admiral McRaven, the SEALs, the brave intel professionals, and all those involved in the successful mission to eliminate Osama bin Laden is simply incredible. ‚ÄúSooner‚Äù? If it could have been done sooner, it would have.

Tune in tomorrow morning at 8am Eastern to @NewDay on @CNN to hear my thoughts on the President, Russia, and whatever else happens between now and then...
The KGB and Putin. Nothing has changed.
Boris Nemtsov	Boris Berezovsky	Stanislav Markelov 	Anastasia Baburova 	Sergei Magnitsky	Natalia Estemirova	Anna Politkovskaya	Alexander Litvinenko	Sergei Yushenkov	Yuri Shchekochikhin
Not much has changed since the Soviet days. Here are some brave Russian reporters and dissidents who sought free speech, fought against corruption, and promoted democracy, daring to speak out against Putin and his cronies and lost their lives for doing so:
GRU Col. Oleg V. Penkovsky	GRU Maj. Gen. Dmitri F. Polyakov	GRU Maj. Pyotr S. Popov	Adolf G. Tolkachev	KGB Lt. Col. Valery F. Martynov 	KGB Maj. Sergei M. Motorin	KGB Col. Gennady Smetanin 	KGB Lt. Col. Gennady G. Varennik 	KGB Lt. Col. Vladimir M. Piguzov
It is what many in Russia have stood up for and in so doing lost their lives. Here is a short list of those who, inspired by our values, volunteered to help U.S. intelligence agencies, and in so doing risked their lives for a better Russian future and paid the ultimate sacrifice:
When you stand alongside a former KGB officer and disparage our Intelligence Community you undermine our global position, weaken our international leadership, &amp; tarnish our values. Those values are central to what we as a country stand for and what makes us unique in the world.
To embrace Vladimir Putin as openly as the President did, and in the face of clear Russian provocations, is to fundamentally cede our global leadership to the very person that wants to see America fail.
Fact: Russia interfered in the 2016 election. 	Fact. Russia continues to launch bold and increasingly aggressive cyber-attacks against our infrastructure. 	Fact: Russia actively undermines our interests and those of our allies in Europe.
The President‚Äôs performance yesterday in Helsinki was nothing short of shocking. To ignore the conclusions of our entire intelligence community and simply accept the word of a former KGB officer is a betrayal of our brave intelligence professionals.

#Corrected: #Russia aims to develop an alternative to the #DNS system to protect it from "possible external influence". If this occurs, Moscow &amp; other users could restrict domestic internet access &amp; be much more aggressive in cyberspace. https://t.co/sMRzGs7xqP
#NorthKorea's continued ICBM development isn't surprising; they clearly are learning lessons from failed launches. Yet, if they have a missile that can reach the CONUS then they are one step closer to fielding a full nuclear capability &amp; that is concerning.

3/3: We must work with our partners and allies around the world to deny ISIS safe havens, wherever we find them.
2/3: Yesterday‚Äôs use of the Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) was targeted at ISIS fighters hunkered down in tunnels.
1/3: While most attention paid to ISIS is in Syria and Iraq, they have a growing presence in Afghanistan.
The cmte has a lot of work: Russia, ISIS, Syria, cybersecurity. Educating Americans on the issues is critical for an informed citizenry.
The committee more broadly can refocus on the intelligence and national security issues facing the United States.
Recusal is not punitive; stepping back is an opportunity to allow the cmte to focus its energy on the investigation, not the controversy.

We live in the greatest country in the world. Sometimes it is important to take a deep breath and remember that.
I was in the FBI. I have the upmost confidence in their ability to conduct a fair and effective investigation. We must let them do their job
Collaboration should not be a dirty word. It's important for us to work together - this is how we find the best solutions.
The changes at the NSC are a positive development. There are big crises facing the administration and it needs clarity and focus.
3/3: The conflict serves as a training ground, beacon, and source of inspiration for ISIS and their sympathizers.
2/3: We must work with our allies to isolate the Assad regime, prevent further attacks, &amp; work toward resolving this ongoing conflict.
1/3: The Assad regime‚Äôs chemical attacks against civilians are appalling and horrifying. The international community must condemn them.

4/4: Those that recklessly release information to un-cleared, and unauthorized people, should be punished to the full extent of the law.
3/4: Intelligence must be strictly controlled and not disclosed to the public to advance anyone‚Äôs partisan agenda.
2/4: In our democracy, intelligence should not, and must not, be a political tool regardless of the party in power.
1/4: The revelation that a deputy assistant secretary, Evelyn Farkas, pushed classified intelligence info to Hill staff is shocking.
When we are at each other‚Äôs throats, the Russians win...again.

Not only do Russia and Iran not fear us, they do not respect us.  And that, is dangerous.
As leader of the Quds Force Soleimani has blood on his hands. The Quds Force contributed to the deaths of at least 500 US soldiers in Iraq.
We should not underestimate what this means to our national security. A leading General in Iran told the world that the USA is irrelevant.
Reports indicate Gen. Soleimani traveled to Russia despite a travel ban and U.N. Security Council resolutions barring him from leaving Iran.

The first national security ? not  for 20 min into the #GOPDebate.  This is why I founded @APPSUSA  Join us to drive the debate.
Most important #GOPDebate question: If the Iran nuclear deal is in place, what tangible things would you do to hold Iran's feet to the fire?
#GOPDebate question: Would you continue releasing prisoners from Guantanamo Bay?
#GOPDebate question: Would you advocate for putting Ukraine or Georgia in NATO?
#GOPDebate question: Would you approve defensive weapons going to Ukraine?

.@washingtonpost Doesn't tell story. As we heard today, there is extensive review, back/forth, changes b4 FISA applications are finalized.
Those of us who uphold oath to protect secrets (which protect US) can't provide clarification for public because info is classified (2/2)
The most damaging aspects of selectively leaking incomplete classified info is that it paints inaccurate picture of intel programs (1/2)
Public trusts govt to protect US from attacks, but trust wanes when faced w half truths, outright lies about the way intel programs are run
@KenDilanianLAT Terrorists already changing their tactics because of the classified information released. Makes it harder to protect the US
@KenDilanianLAT Respectfully disagree. Leaks damaged natl security by disclosing source/methods. Strict oversight by all 3 govt branches.
