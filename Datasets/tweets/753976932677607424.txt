@larryelder @rgreader Also not being a hypocrite works wonders way before you save up $200 with TANF and get a business,before this there was also doing things like going to the library,not involving yourself with violence and the best thing ever which was going to church haha
@larryelder @rgreader Who‚Äôs giving you keys to success,perhaps in the made for TV movie era you did those things,nowadays to be successful you start a business for $200

They put me back on LinkedIn.
@MarkHalperin There are no heroes however many villains with a change of heart lol
I have been to the mountain top
Not a professional networker any more. It's more effective for me to make connections w/o LinkedIn. F them don't use the app.
You raise money from hard working middle class citizens and you don't ever win the lawsuit
You exploit the labor power of hundreds domestically and say that it's an operating expense
You squander the goodwill of the public and seek to profit from an audience of misinformed youth but you call it activism
You libel,slander,and defame and call it news.It is sedition,just tell the truth and maybe you won't have to beg for business
And you call this work,you ask for contributions. You write meaningless thoughts and call it copy.
I'd rather lose again by 173,631 votes than to crease to professionals with no impact on their life other starring at a screen for hours
And if you don't agree with my level of professionalism don't vote for me,don't invest in my companies,don't give a cent to my organization
So as the old adage is said the customer is always right.
It's because I'm independent that they take issue, the listing standards of the NYSE and Nasdaq don't so I'll take them over social media
The reason for my saying that is because I'm a candidate for federal office,I'm 29,I'm successful in business on my own I'm independent
So obviously they tried to censor me,which I do believe is because of my political prowess
So apparently it was a game move to make 400 connections in a day,they restricted me for that. Is that a violation to be favored by all
So enough of them. From now on you can find me @mantanonanicho1
Shame on LinkedIn. I have a 1:1 persona and they can't stand my approach to making clients and raising money. Blame it on a decade ago
I know the truth. It's because I have what it takes to do everything independently. I don't need assistance from the media to be effective
So that's apart of the reason why I don't do social media strategy as a marketing tool when it becomes larger than life they prohibit you
Such is life my influence remain so tge tweet has more of an impact
I made too many connections on LinkedIn so they restricted me I think after 400+ high ranking individuals reach out to you they shut you out
@realDonaldTrump I feel you are delusional in thinking other times your genius is remarkable,perhaps you should just focus on balance sheet as you said

Y take advice from media,as if they're used to stuff,when was the last time a journalist did you a favor, how kind was that lol
I already made my way in. Like who you know at 28 with a campaign for federal office,and yes dropped out of college cause it was whack

And even if I wanted to join your party everyone already wants to get in mine,it's been that way since 2009 when I founded my faction
Like don't worry I'm a third party candidate, don't need your vote I have my own
Then like yah I know God is the greatest,but really just to get votes or contributions which advocates most for you in an interview lol
They didn't buy my cd-rom in '98 is tiring coverage,like let it go get back to your non profit oppo spiel
Should I be like oh no let's not want to work with them like can't you get someone else
Like nah it's not 1950, it's not even 2008,it's what came out at a Wall St Sunday supper lol
wasn't concerned with the haters like it's just a hundred thousand or more people that voted the other way, I took it on the chin being new
Okay I was playing Trump the game to pass the time in 1989,like car phones and escalators was how I became introduced to politics

You know what take it personal,get a committee and run it,put your own money up and get your own message
It's like oh yah would love the press but nah my media relations have been stressed due to everyone taking everything personal
Like I guess you better get down to solving your own issues because it seems that the democrats aren't going to have much voice on things
How can you make money when you're an intern
Like how could there be any politics that you could do when you're always at school listening to a professor
Tell the truth, even the opposition wants to get a new deal with the president
I'm ready to work with democratic leaders,like speak for yourself cause I'm doing my own thing,I'm not actually going through that again
A lot of sore losers over the climate deal,maybe the environmental lobby is over, I mean it's not 2003 anymore, so get over it
You know what I don't like about Donald Trump...That phrase is the most overused behind closed doors
If we've met on the hill then you've got my respect but that doesn't mean my Wall St. supper group does
"Not what we need" lol spoken like a true politician
So everyone wants to know what I think of the president. That's a discussion for silver hair lol
Like why would I make promises to campaign,if you do this I'll make sure that, nah I'm straight in fact it's the straight campaign
Like oh no let me not say anything to lose votes or sponsorships or contributions, umm no fuck that
It means so much to be respected in the town that I have had a chip on my shoulder since 2015 that I forgot in 2017 about the edge

I am an ultra conservative. I give everyone a look in the eye. FORGET about divide and conquer. SEPARATION and FEAR are for democrats
So like its about religion,not about skin. Don't make it about skin.
Should I weaken my genes just for social purposes? No. My tribe is not gonna
Of course I don't dabble. I mean what I say. Do you think I want someone to have my genes which is not from my conviction?
Steve King is the reason for this rant.

they tried to give me pills,they were knock off drugs I was like shame on those providers,like real drugs mean more than fake insurance
and yes I will show you some furnitureüòâ
don't @me if you wanna sext me,this my real twitter not my burner phone
maybe we should make imagination a new American destination#sayyes
I could see that convincing wasn't working so I began to freelance,and wound up at the top
shit was steep,a hard sell to go, there was a debate,it was anniversary night at DU,I pioneered, but after seeing the game from both sides
I worked as an individual contributor for a firm,my first day at work I met and shook hands with Paul Ryan he was picked for VP that morning
so it was 2012,I had to get across the aisle,I was doing OFA,that will never go away,but the time came to cross so I did
it wasn't about money it was about how I was treated,I don't do liberal causes anymore due to seeing how socialism destroys #redisred
after that the whole democratic party wanted work,so I took the liberty to cash a check or two or eleven or twleve
I had friends who needed help so I gave them props on Sen.Reid's 2010 campaign,that was the eureka moment validation came at 50.3% majority
thats another story I aint trying to tell
everythingn began to slope for me, there was a total negative effect on me since i didn't support the leaders except those opposed the exec
things got even more challenging, I fell out with friends cause my business was on paper and they only had dreams and what they heard on tv
that made no difference cause the banks gave me accounts, even though I had like no money the money I got I opened accounts
the collapse happened I took criticism from all my loved ones, we fell out due to lack of intellectual resource
I was totally on my own, that's what ownership means, everyone doubted me but that made no difference I had something they wanted they had 0
it was 2008, I formed a LLC, I made myself the registered agent and all the other things listed on the form, hence how it was formed
retail was the shit back then but I wanted the license, so obviously there could only be that for me, so I chased that
all the jobs were franchises,lol so I learned the traditional business of the United States, like retail
quit like all the jobs, cause I knew math, I would be like I made you a quarter mill in 3 months, fuck is you stupid what is $300 #seventeen
the mall was like fast times, I learned how to manage and was like fuck college, that's for ppl w/o connections
I was a PATRIOT they had an ACT for that I didn't need a permission slip, that's when I was like okay rob everyone, it was what it was #2004
lol and it wasn't about education I always went to Catholic school, stop dissing on my church and when i went to public school I was like no
okay anyways like the real Independent, that would be like always was self-made, dropped out at 16 to work in the mall, took the GED at 18
lol grab them while supplies last #funny/notfunny https://t.co/3d43f0USL7
like we used to talk about the future now all we talk about is the past, no likey let's talk about the present lol compromising huh
like I like to go out but it's seldom that I havve a nice time, like it's always ruined, I just do it for partonage, evry1 needs customers
so yeah with all the socializing i had forgot that I'm not for that shit anymore
so no I don't remember and what makes you think I would and new ppl who are you
and I'm never satisfied that's my curse nothing makes a difference lol no pressure
it's just not working out, like that's the truth
it's non of my concern I don't believe in celebrity cause I have met so many,I was younger and they told me about this shit its success
like fuck dignity and respect, if that's all you want then grattitude leige, I want spoils and more laurels
like I don't car about anything I lost that feeling over the last eight years, it was a challenge and now it's finished like i lost it all
I know I know but you'll get over it, I had to wait until i had secured everythinng to express what I feel and not lose a job over it
the new shit for 2017 is offcial campaigns not causes that donate to campaigns, like y would i raise money for that shit, I can panhandle me
social media is a tool, i know how to excercise my rights on it but im not going to say that it's the new its played out #so2008
and this is me as a free citizen, not currently in candidate mode
this my personal, I'm not a business I am a person
so what I know is that it's another great day in Washington
and it's not even a socio-economic thing, I'm just pissed cause you can't have the cake and eat it too, and I made the cake
I'm not going to so I'm not going to as if I needed any money to pursue, all I need is books and eventually the money will arrive
do I need to take my heart out and just be ruthless, possibly it seems to be the only way to rise above the rest
so I'm upset about things like the same people you defend turn agaisnt you, funny should you turn back on them?
people didn't but businesses and governments did, i was always inside I only stepped away to see what the word on the streets were
so I did everythinng officially that I could do to make people like me and accept me, the funny thing was they didn't
anyways all my role models followed the same path, so it was inevitable that I do as well
I thought this shit had a purpose, you mean to tell me I risked my life for you just so you could gamble with the IRS, I'm not an idiot okay
I'm angry over the shit cause that's not y I became involved in it, I did it cause of true love, but power endures so I grew up
so I will make it available for everyone to gorge on partisanship, I came in the game with the usual accounts brokerage,business &amp; personal
like the issue is not money that is a use the issue is once you take it in politics they alwasy want to give it like it solves things
I did all this work to make a way or give a voice and now my voice and way will be impeded due to asking others for money #fucked
the candidate personally allocates funds and then assigns them to the campaign that makes it Indpendence,-it spoils it otherwse
so like why shoudl I allow voters to give me contributions, see I think people have it twisted so allow me to explain how it goes
and even if you give me money which people always will and always do, they want to give it to me for free not for my campaign
then y should you be able to view the contributions, like I don't need people who don't give money to give me attitude
I love the game,but not all of it like reporting contributions, y should I have to beg you to vote for me, that's not right
and stop pretending we're cool, we are not I just have to be kind to you cause I practice what I campaign about, unlike the hypoctites
and after an entire two terms of trash, I now have to get back to actually reading the laws from scratch  like In 1776 #freetime
So now my politics are like machiavelli, and they always have been hence the myspace, but no exile just the northwestside
like you gotta live through endowment, stop pretending you have another agenda, it makes the image of the U.S. look like how we do our taxes
like I don't know how to make money anymore, it seems that I am now above the working class and the social class too
like I cannot believe, I didn't believe it did not change the only thing that changed was the taste level of ignorance and my toleration
when he said freedom he really meant poverty, when the new guy says great he means wealth, like did you get tax relief, nah you got rollback
so I'm not doing the 501c(3) lol i turned it into a 527 political organization, like as soon as he cut exec comp i got used to "freedom"
like peep game- let me try to convince you to give me money so I can give it to someone who only has prints opinions on society
like for real those socialists want to take all your money and use it to do nothing except waste it, y would i ever listen to that
like all of my businessess failed over the last eighty years, but my political organizations held them together, like thank the lord
and yeah that was him and his constituent base, like it made no sense to me it was a footnote in my history, it didn't define me
that was before this "new era"of engagement, like how did we engage, he apoligized for everything, like every speech was a euloogy or a cry
and so fucking what my mom worked for neilsen,she was with all the watch parties, like all the neighbors knew i didn't care for him
and it will always be https://t.co/vAOIUilHRH, that convention was lame I walked out and smoked ganja while playing golf at city park course
like of course I wasn't going to vote for that, that was propoganda, he wrote books like no i live in 3-D, like it's not so dreamy now huh,
it's like now I gotta work extra cause I have to prove that the difference between me and the guy leaving office are worlds apart
like I know you're not gonna let them get away with that they tried to play you like yeah i know but it was only eight years
and y are you always starting a busines or a cause but never coming up with an exit plan, like how many degrees does it take to manage?
like let's ask each other why you don't got an iphone or a playstation vue or better an xbox slim in 4k, like whats the drilly with that tho
take a break from your polis and focus on your conscience, this isn't hypothetical place or theory world, this that post materialistic shit
and stop going around being mean to everyone, it's the holidays, like go and hand someone a card or give a hug show some love
and like yeah the problems won't leave until you yourselfs arrive at the solutions, stop blaming other's for what you did with your vote
so like wtf Selena Gomez,is that whats goin on in millenial world? instagram,bodies lol dating
obviously the game was fair and you should respect it,that's all, love the eagle DJT- he took your lunch now you want it back for free#irony
and if you listen to MSM,y you think they always seem to be cool with talking about race,lol cause it's in the value propisition#boycottMSM
and its all love to everyone,but its all war with those who oppose me,that's politcs,it's how I eat,so dnt try that,it won't work lol
and even if you made racism a priori,they fucked that up like eight years ago,like it was obvious that what should have been done wasn't
why is it always about skin color,like fuck does that have to do with appropriate signatures required# skin color don't translate
not done yet,I'll tell u when
and yeah,imma speak on that like y is it injustice like just cause you didn't get your way#immature #childish
lol,dnt be mad cause you lost,like that just shows that if you would have won how you would have treated ppl,#shameful
and it's great always just cause,but now it's more great anyhow cause it shows you the way to win
like where you get your information from,lol according to your source she's still gonna win by 10pts,lol it won't get old
kids love me,old people compliment me,teens say let me borrow cash,women either enjoy or detest,and these men either respect or get stepped
happy holidays,I'm reading the long loneliness,cause it will be just that this year due to my political ties#MAGA!!!!!ü§ó

lol donald with the nsc codes
oh and sports,like espn over everything
Going to take some time away from the game,enjoy life for awhile,like thnksgvng,xmas,nye,and ice cream,cake,candy
I won,cause I didn't lose I got a comittee number and a candidate one I am alllowed to raise unlimited amounts of$,but I dnt need that
I mastered this politics shit from the inside out,like only reason y I'm not applying for a job is cause I turned them down to do me
who's ready for greatness
so I did what was best,I held my vote, I saw it for what it was and it was,I'm in the game as a candidate,like I used to lobby now what

Will dress in slacks all winter but will wear jeans over them
Won't put you in a class will say that you need more information
Won't stop spending money will start asking others for it and save that for later
Won't stop watching the news will stop listening to it
Won't stop defending the rights of the causes but will not anymore let the people who work for them disrespect me,like fuck your vote
Don't know about what you should do about the relationship but does believe you should accept the child
Can't tell you every law but does know the ones that make it free like complete freedom
Don't know about conflict resolution but I do know about the element of suprise lol
Don't know about life know about looks and it's not what it seems but I like looking nice, Donald always had nice wives lol
like you don't wanna be alone but you don't want to get distracted,lol better have a plan in the relationship,at least Bill had a plan,lol
keeping all options open,remember those days like I'm not an entertainer or athlete,politician is my occupation so yeah I'm numb to the hate
and the only reason y I say such deplorable things is cause I tried to be chill in get consensus but its more effective to jazz it up
lol and even if she was fascinated by sex and being a nasty woman how is that not what you want in politicsüòâ
It's true most of the women I like are super nasty lol whats wrong with a nasty woman what if you want it nasty like who likes nice anymore
And yeah even if it was a thing like what would it turn into,lol I'd be running round brunching with you listening to you how bout or nahü§î
And yeah you know the DC style is getting raunch but the women want me only for purposes and yeah I'm not one of your conquests #doublestand

You know the deal but you should have read the details,I got the best deal but the worst work lol
it was never about money it was only about showing that if you read the rules and guidelines and you practice you can have anything
Got the whole industry mad at me lol cause I would rather smoke a joint than rehearse a talking point
America be like Nick,im like stop calling me that I told everyone Nicholas is my grown up name
lol i guess it's true what they say about the game
what happens when Kim gets robbed,lol I guess Kanye was false advertising
lol you better do as your told voters or the media is going to raise prices on your attention span,lol it's going to be a regime change
Like really I could have been....who speaks like that, I still am the greatest,like check my valuations lol
Been reading my strategies from when the Obama administration began,like yeah no suprises,truth is in 07 I knew that it would be like this
been listening to all the songs of various generations and it seems that yeah i grew out of making songs when i was eighteen üòâ
Legends blessed me last month from the Senate and House floor but the public curses me,like I became a politician for lack of better title
FEC won't let me off the deal,saying it never ends,like ahhh you mean i gotta be public property forever??? Will I ever get out of the lobby
And if you felt that you got paid in the recession,the only profits you got were from those who lost money,lol you didnt create anything
If you thought you had hype in 2008,it was only cause my mom worked for Neilsen and we threw parties,my kid brother sold T-shirts lol
Had to drop out of college cause it was easier to start my own organizations than listen to professors who never made one in their life
Like I dropped out of high school and went to work for small businesses now I own eight
The reason why I setback eight years was cause of time and timing and this time I went further than evry1 my age but still have to wait
When you do it Independently as a Federalist you get mad love,when you bootstrap you get mad props when you earn spurs you gain nods
Okay,what I am going to do next would obviously start a party,but I only want ppl who have conviction cause it will be challenging
Everyone on the hill knows I got next,I just don't know what I am going to do next,I just do it cause of the Declaration #duh
What price the crown,when ppl say aww you're not going to win I say winning wasn't the objective experience is and yeah stop being neg lol
major fail but pleasant dissapointment like who else at 28 had enough gravitas to write-in for a seat Independently,it's not about money üó∫
it's okay you just need faith,like read the Constitution not the news
Brings a hundred ones to the Senate Gallery everytime I go like you might as well learn to count cause you don't get to have a pen there
I look older than I am,like why you wanna take my legs and steal my blood lol
Media takeout,okay so oil on the low, pound on the rise,market on thw flat and obviously election weeks away
I played this game when I was sixteen,like wow lets go back to 05 tactics
Came to Washington not knowing anyone so what's up with the rumorsüñï
Focus on what to do the day after election night
So no more plans only transactions
I found what I was searching for but there is still more best decision ever to drop out of school
There is no more to see after seeing the 3rd floor of the US Capitol,but there is more to life than it,like dating
Nothings going to change quit with all that preaching I'll take my chances don't try to spin me or confuse me
With a candidate committee I now am able to raise large funds so for all those who had questioned check my quarterly report
When it comes down to it my first actual loss on a campaign will be election night, the takeaway is that I pushed myself into a new cycle
They don't understand I have a large spirit and the flame of my soul won't be doused
Been in Washington for ninety-five days,of course I have changed the switch up from fried chicken to crab cakes got me all distant üèõ
And dont blame me politics is a sport the media blows it up but fuck that due to a technicality
Is being out funded by almost a million down but umm yeah i pitched $2.00 lol so yeah now im gonna make a million soon even if i lose
Had a super implosion camapign totally blew up lol
My heart goes out to all the people who get in too deep when it comes to politics,myself i will not be satisfied until...	.......like ever
Remember a genius such aa myself is still not a fortune teller so dont expect anything except in avoidance of taxable income receipt
Had me mistaken like I was going to waste political capital on these toy soldier politicians like everyone run for their seats lol #star
#"Star"  lol hot mic
Toast to the times when it meant love
Social media,no thanks its enough the world wants my demise
187 iq lol high Iowa test of basic skills #genius
In avoidance of taxable income receipt #Genius
So whack lol
six weeks until
Oh and peoplw treat me with down talk like I understand it's politics or business both trades get me no love nowadays so long dates lol
This time I made it to thw third floor I got a candidate and committee number,I got the software,I'm official it doesn't end ever
Why would I sale my morals I would rather try again and again and an when I know cause actually getting this far was way more than ever
So no love my two dollars on October quarterly gives me one shot to go out  the gates but unless you've got actual dollars then no sale
It comes down to money in the end I'm 934,850 dollars away and no one gave me shit cause I was too kind to take money from ppl
In the next six weeks I am going to prepare for the next six years it's not a Senate race in TN and that's why I am gonna wait for 2018
Oh yes and for those who think they can outsmart me in this industry run against me cause this year I made it to the general and I have 6wks
Check out that new green day visual for I'm still breathingüòé
At 30 I have two chances at office at 35 I want to see what happens but for the last two years of twenties imma roar the loudest#firsttime4
The way I am going to campaign for Senate and President is not the same way I am going to campaign for Representative and I'm at rep level
And so when I went to the DNC I knew what it meant to be the one to watch I still am but I don't do bias filler I like social media but no
The way I came up is through the pen and the paper so if you don't like it that way then too bad cause I knew in 2008 not to got but wait
I secured the Vote through writing in I could give a fuck about party nomination I don't want your signatures lol your name is trash
Why did Howard Dean say trump was using cocaine....umm Bush did and Obama smoked ganja,I still smoke ganja that shit is approved by me in dc
And I got mad friends we just talk like this on Twitter cause it's an invention
And even if you were mad you've got the bill of rights but don't fuck with my constitutional rights I'm not equal
I did not sale my people I didn't fuck families over all I did was listen to my teachers now I fuck with legislation and ppl mad #deal
And I don't even have a dream anymore that was last week now all I have are nightmares of people telling me that I don't rep hard like what
And I wish all this shit would cease cause before 08 I could date who I wanted now it's all about skin whatever happened to dreams lol
I even got a thumbs up from John Lewis last Wednesday nite in the House Gallery,I'm not even from his hood I'm from Memphis
And even if it was sixty years ago and they were killed because of their skin color you're not going to die you would cower out,I know ppl
And even if they killed those people on purpose do you think that they killed them because they were black that is so sixty years ago
And why would you blame the same people in the community that protect you,don't you think you'll need them when your not safe,no matter what
And what's with all the buddy buddy shit,where was all the unity in the recession when it  to do with the economy everyone blamed everyone
How is it history that's what dinosaurs are,we are humans we make civilization,#getmeright
So miss me with the black lives matter shit,I didn't even go to the museum open over the weekend that shit is stupid what you call history
Cause on the real talk I'm from a life where pride gets you killed no matter what you do either way if neither side has anything to hide
Maybe if those who were killed on both sides didn't pretend to be so though they would have lived‚ò∫üòâüòÑ
You're only gangsta when it's peace when the shots going off you're all sympathetic I think that's so fake,like get an identity
Just cause you wanna bad mouth my  senators who do shot on the daily in thw streets doesn't mean imma back ya little agenda talking bout war
Oh I guess I changed cause I did it the way you're supposed to not shoot people or throw brick bricks and now I don't relate nah,get real
If it matters so much then log on https://t.co/Kvq8NYW1G3 click on candidate and committee viewer and type in Nicholas Mantanona,then what
Or does it matter because if it meant so much to me and obviously since I'm pro life then you would have made a contribution to my campaign
Oh I know why it matters cause people who didn't follow the rules should be made exceptions to them then you get upset over bullshit right
Why do black lives matter again???? I'm confused because I'm out here risking everything for the sake of right and all I got is two dollars
Only candidate for Congress who's writing in this year as an independent  umm don't worry about voting for me you don't know me like that
So those who make contributions there will be favors those who oppose shall get no leeway #DontIntervene
I say that cause I have to state everyone's rights that's how I rep but fuck that after last week at the top of the world I see how some are
I don't understand why we can't be but I am going to say from now on zip it when you see me ur not a candidate you don't know your rights
Was all in the gallery not trying to get an infraction while people are all up in the seats down talking the leaders who literally made me üò≤
Saw the whole thing in the galleries last week discovered  I am a a natural politician #MeNow
Mr. Write-In
#theonlyfederalcandidatethats28
#back
All last week I was in the galleries of the Senate and House #3rdFloor,like yeah not concerned with anything except....

In attempt to thwart these adversaires, Nicholas Mantanona, candidate for United States House is now accepting all contributions :)
after the TN primary, it looks as if four candidates remain, I'm one of them and three didn't make it out, the campaign escalates
have you heard the good news, lol
THE HUNDRED DAYS......
So I capitalized .05% from $500, no one needed to know,all I wanted to do was be a cashier to practice,and so I applied it job after job
I looked up to those who had hedge funds and commercial brokerages,watching them was like school,I turned 18 when the crocs IPO launched
I was turning 17 and I had discovered that it wasn't the money it was the price and I was willing to double down on equity,I began lobbyingüí°
So that's how it began,I got fired and was relieved cause I was only making 6.50,everyone else was making a killing,selling tapes or ganj
I went home one night and watched mtv2,I think it was viva la bam and the aha moment came, i was like hmm go to college or get in politics
Anyways,for the record I wasn't famous,lol I was paying dues everyone was sneaking me in bars and clubs and giving me advice on life
The all-star game was in Denver, I met everyone who had fame,lol that's when I knew not to sell out
Oh Shaq was on the heat,and I'm sure everyone was fascinated with the Paris Hilton sex tape
Can't forget the shuffle,lol does anyone remember the dell juke ir the Zune hehe
Okay we'll wait on the steam,where were we oh yes 2004,everyone was wearing livestrong bands and iTunes had the mini and nano
vous etes, to be continued, gotta take a steam and then we'll get back to the unabridged version of how I came to be part 3
so yeah, I got kicked out of school, after 3 weeks lol, I wasn't going to  going to be intimidated by anyone, I then discovered cherry creek
anyways, there was plenty stuff going on, for me I was sent to Denver to study, lol I felt like Karl Rove, it was 16
anyways plenty stuff happened like Enron going under, mci failing, lol do you remember when there was desperate housewives, lol
so in the midst of all this there was the oc, the killers, right around now it's time for 2004, do you remember vanity fair war and destiny
the road to war begins, lol you got this guy thumbing his nose at the world gassing his people, lol something about a chicken bone after 72h
anyways around this time the 5000 missile and the 10 dollar tent became a soundbite
anyways, I had good grades and went to high school on academic scholarship, it was all boys school, I learned the executive game at 13
after I read the indictment, I stopped caring about being popular, it wasn't worth my while, so that's when I got my style
so for those who dont remember, after the sour grapes came what I had already knew, which was people were not going to agree with me
so where do I begin, I think the year was 2000, oh yes the 6th grade, there was 5-4, lol you know you're not a decider
I kept the key to the game for 10yrs /like I only didn't vote cause I'm not a sell out, I'm wise, I value my rights, my right is my right
lol, lets think back to what everyone wants me to talk about which is life before 9/11, and growing up while it was going on, you know 01-07
so here's the scoop, no dad(usual) mom left at 2(heard it before) gma had me reading at 3(wow) skipped pre-k(bright) did catholic school,K-8
is going to write the auto-bio, like forget that, see me and only me for the 411, like what records do I really have, I just got an ID
has never seen a bootstrapper ever call it quits
getting ready for the fight of my life, I plan to take the whole purse
making the campaign soundtrack, it's primary week, as you know I wrote in for the general, so next hundred days gonna be ready for whatevs
so does anyone actually think that either of these candidates are fit to lead the nation or is it just leftovers from y2k ????
what do you expect I'm a millennial right, I'm gonna take your job right lol
okay so the whole campaign will be ran digitally and through usps, srry not srry way late for srry
RT @NFL: If the @Giants want a üíç...		They better know how to chase one down. #NFLTrainingCamp https://t.co/xIVG0i7ikU
I should be watching golf right now
don't try to guilt me cause you were premature with success, I thought that was an acquired taste
-now, sorry not sorry, like why should I be, everyone had a shot in the millenium
life will be told from the perspective of 2000
everything will be a post materialistic philosophy and a rational choice theory
I ran on the simple facts in the founding documents
Interns do it for free, lol I do it better
Used to bang my fist on the table to get my point across lol that was power when I was ten
I'm melting its so hot here lol
-think of it this way when it comes to playing to the base, 97% of people who quit are employed by the 3% who didn't give up on themselves
There was green green grass
A people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives, so international tariff and arm regs
imma stay connected like the Wi-Fi
I'm a writer my 25 is my 25, lol
I have to work on my one-liners, people love when you can say a hot verse
and this twitter is cool, but I still don't play that get outta line and I'll hit you with the laptop
and yes I play video games but I still don't play that like pause Madden and hit you with the controller
ahh got even older, you know it was politics and I still dont play that, like forget the petition hit you with the clipboard
got even older and still didn't play that customer service industry was like get off the phone, hit you with the phone
got older and still didn't play that, service industry was like forget the job, hit you with the dishes
still don't play that, public school was like drop the books hit you with the Snapple
we don't play that, I went to private school moves was like drop the books and hit you with the gym bag
and I don't hate media, I just hate yall's
I know it's fucked up I gotta talk through the pen, but I can't afford to not record this way
if I was a baller then I would get play, but since I was a square I wasn't around, lol that's why they say  be there or be square
-so now I'm a candidate and they still won't date me, if I was an entertainer then I'd have plenty of options, but I'm not as entertaining
-the firm's not doing this, I'm doing this as a free citizen, lol I remember back when I was a lobbyist, women wouldn't date me
aww pa, you was punching the clock, I was walking off the jobs so I could go to the mall, it was a recession so I incorporated
don't make diss you, I don't wanna but I will if I have to, I run positive campaigns, but if you intervene with my election I'll have to
the game is kinda slow, like I'm a millennial, all you think we know is medical weed and fashion, nah I was a cashier
it's like be in politics, be in jail or be a murder victim, funny how the last two sorta coincide, so politics it is
And all my role figures followed the same path
Thinking back to summer when I was sixteen,seventeen,and eighteen,remember those days,it seems like just last week
What a man puts in his mind he becomes
(I)Nicholas Mantanona, it was way better than playing as a team, and it has it's own ring to it, plus it looks great on a stationary
All I can say is we go our own way
It's Nicky and I'm penny up what
#freetime,
I would love to engage and express my thoughts on the happenings of the world,but that's not what this twitter is for,no its for me to chill
Sick sad world circa 1998
Everything you want you don't need don't believe everything that you read only half of what you see
I'm self funded not crowd funded,
My entire message is how you wish you sounded
My whole campaign is how you wish you could campaign
Alot of ppl dnt like what I represent,that's too bad cause changing my style is a no no
Americanism,like what sort of philosophy is that,umm the one where we rub it in your face while we kick you through the dirt over and over
and I quit school cause of recess,decided it was better not to play with yall no more
My designer is mismatch
Speak English lol
if the only way to win is to go negative, then negative it is, ahhh I miss Denver the campaigns are positive, lol or at lest non-partisan
It was good speech, im just wondering if he'll keep the candor for the next 100 days, lol I bet you felt proud of your country huh :)
Just remembered that dr pepper is prune juice and twenty three other flavors,that's how great America isüòâ
The big night üåÉ
If not then I'll stay unaffiliated until Mrs. Clinton announces a running mate,I'll know who's a liege and who's an ally
Tonight we'll see what's what with this whole candidacy,if I like what I'll see I'll go on ahead and through my support if not then.....
@Slate would strongly have to disagree, like what are you silly, last time I checked the dinosaurs contributed the most,lol
Mr. Cotton you're a war fighter,and a senator,you've earned the right,but you're not a politician,you seem as if more of an opportunist
The ticket was soft,the first nite was lame,they better get organized or you might not ever live this down
Oh and tan skin,you get no curiae,there's no place for that except if your trying to win votes from weak hands #shameful
These guys was all they had,they give the party a bad image,they've got no ideas,how are they wise? why are they best for national image?
I'm sure they'll delegate better by calendar Wednesday,I'm going to sleep#don't wait up even Sen. Hatch wants to get to bed early after that
Not impressed,amateur night,just cause you showed up and had remarks on the performance of others doesn't mean you'll perform better
Lots of angles in the platform the gist is they're tired of losing the big one,all I'm getting from this is that they're risking it all
You think the convention is a bore,what's the matter? You don't wanna play no more?
per discussion
Y didn't any1 tell me I've missed like a whole year of pop culture???
so if I turned the low paying jobs down, then of course I didn't take the useless salaries, like what do you expect #NOFUTURE
in a decade I did what people said couldn't be done, proof that people don't know a thing about anything is my candidacy
My parents don't approve, lol I'm the candidate though :)
no I'm not going to dis you on the internet, I wouldn't waste my type on you
I grew up in the 90's looking up to people society looks down upon, funny how the tables flipped, but it's still the same in this industry
I know a lot about the game, but I wanna learn much more, politics are what they are, but the profession is what makes the game a sport
this campaign is gonna have a heavy focus on the internet, but less focus on things like umm basically whatever I lose attention on
that wasn't a shot, I don't take shots at legends, that's just something I don't do, but I'm just saying, those books were lame propaganda
I'm thinking back to when I was 20 and at the DNC, everybody compared me to that man, we're nothing alike I'm from Memphis, he was from idk
I was always into politics, the last time I lost an election, I was in the 4th grade, that sparked this campaign #mostlikelytobogart
these journalists try to burn you, so no media relations, lol instead I will be doing everything firsthand on the campaign, it's been 312wks
I know the social media game, back when myspace was in, I was 16, not much has changed except more posers and less posters
politics of self interest, we all want a job that cuts slack, that's not my campaign, we all want kids who won't talk back, I'm not one lol
To all my constituents and voters who enjoyed my last campaign, this one is an Independent "write-in" style campaign, so get your cash out!
First thing first, America will always be great, umm like if you don't think so, then shame on you- you should have measured up
Maintenance in progress, I'm inviting people over later to stare at their phones and tablets lol
