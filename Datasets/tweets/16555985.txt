Asked what question she would ask @realDonaldTrump in a debate, @amyklobuchar says she’d ask: “Would you pledge to obey the law?” She says it comes down to a fundamental issue of truth.
“No, I am not for free four-year college for all” @amyklobuchar says. She says she wishes she was a “genie” and could make it happen. But “We have a mounting debt,” she says during @CNN town hall. Doesn’t want to leave that debt on their shoulders.
Asked whether she supports free college for all, @amyklobuchar talks about refinancing &amp; getting more kids into community college. So I think the answer is No. Says she wants to have a “big discussion”
I have to say that dozens of women on the campaign trail in recent weeks have told me how exasperated they are about the careful line that female candidate have to walk: tough but not too tough, strong but not too strident, fierce but not shrill. Clinton’s struggles def live on.

“Am I a tough boss, yes” @amyklobuchar says during our @CNN Town Hall. “Have I pushed my staff too hard, yes” but she says she has high expectations for her staff and the country. I don’t feel like that fully answers the question about her treatment of staff.

This is the most interesting divide in the Democratic field, @amyklobuchar stops short of endorsing Medicare-for-All. She says maybe someday but right now she’s focused on something that would work now.

I’m sure I’m in the minority here, but from a pure political calculus perspective - I think that if @realDonaldTrump whittled down that speech, cut out super controversial parts &amp; focused on goals like infrastructure &amp; prescription drugs, he’d be in a stronger position for #2020

@kentborg Weird. I’ll check.
If you missed our Iowa @CNN town hall, @jaketapper &amp; @KamalaHarris talked a lot about why she thinks the wall would be ineffective in stopping transnational gangs: "I have been to the border. I have seen the tunnels.” 	Full transcript is here: https://t.co/aCj4yNZ49N https://t.co/CSk6FeZOKy
Yeah, this was a good moment for @KamalaHarris b/c she’s got a lot to say on the campaign trail abt the air-conditioned &amp; well-lighted tunnels at the border used by transnational crime organizations.

Note that @KamalaHarris leapt to her feet when a dreamer questioner said she didn’t want to be used as a bargaining chip. Her advocacy on that issue will be incredibly important to her chances in Nevada and California, which is going to be a tough tough primary for everyone.
But that was interesting at the @CNN Town Hall, that she brought in the concept of sons and fathers - and the importance of breaking barriers. So that’s how she broadens that conversation to include everyone men, boys etc. #HarrisTownHall
Here’s the thing, @KamalaHarris doesn’t really like questions about all her historic firsts. So she always goes to that saying from her mom who told her “You might be the first, but don’t be the last.” People like that answer. #HarrisTownHall

Many in California GOP and national party leaders wanted Duncan Hunter to step aside months ago, so they would have time to advance another GOP candidate and save CA-50 for the GOP. Hunter was defiant, and that didn’t happen. Now, too late to even push a write-in candidate
But decision by @SpeakerRyan to strip Hunter of his committee assignments says a lot about where the Republican Party stands right now on @Rep_Hunter who has always been a lone wolf.
So far, it looks like @Rep_Hunter will stay on and fight the charges. His spox says he believes the charges against him and his wife are “purely politically motivated.” His lawyers face a steep hill given the detail in that 47 page indictment. https://t.co/b239jd7Gr4

In making case that Duncan D. Hunter and his wife lived well beyond their means, prosecutors say they overdrew their personal bank account more than 1,100 times over a 7-year-period. Indictment says that resulted in $37,761 in bank fees
At this juncture, Duncan Hunter’s name will remain on the ballot regardless of what he chooses to do. No other GOP candidate can run for CA-50. The only way to remove his name is if that is ordered by a judge. That is a huge development in race for control of US House.
Congressman Duncan D. Hunter and his wife Margaret, who was his campaign manager, have been indicted on charges of using campaign funds for personal use.

There will be a GOP primary for @MittRomney in the Utah Senate race. He just came in second to Mike Kennedy in the second round of delegate voting here at the convention. Romney 49.12% Kennedy 50.88%
Regardless of what happens in the second round of voting (occurring now) @MittRomney will still be on the Utah primary ballot, because he collected the requisite signatures to qualify. But Mike Kennedy (who has framed the race as David v. Goliath) is close on his heels.
In first round of caucus voting @MittRomney did not clear the 60% he needed to avoid a GOP primary and become the Utah Republican Party's nominee. The 4,000 delegates will now engage in a second round of balloting.

So @MittRomney is deep, deep, deep in his charts and graphs at his 1st event ... Right now we are looking at a slide that shows “CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuel Burning, 1950-2012” as he talks about global warming. “We have to get China to take action"
In the let-Mitt-be-Mitt ethos of this Senate campaign, @MittRomney has prepared his own slide presentation to outline the nation’s challenges and is asking for the clicker here at the Utah County GOP dinner. Power Point or White Board = His Happy Place.
“We’re going to hold the House and the Senate,” @MittRomney says, telling the audience that they can’t pay attention to polls this early.
In keeping with the (very) low-key tone of his U.S. Senate campaign, @MittRomney has opted not to give an actual speech here at his first event. Instead he’s reading &amp; answering questions submitted by the audience.
At the Utah County GOP dinner, @MittRomney is asked about what it was like to run for President. He says Fritz Mondale put it best: “All my life I wanted to run for president in the worst way, and I did.”
On guns &amp; the FL shooting, @MittRomney said the best solutions to halting gun violence will come from the States. Says states should consider school “intervention teams” to target troubled youth, and possibly age and psychological restrictions on gun purchases
Classic @MittRomney as he steps out as a candidate: "I want to dispel the rumor that I only ran for President as a stepping stone to become the senator from Utah."
.@MittRomney offers his prayers to victims of Florida shooting in 1st appearance. He says he would be open to legislation sponsored by Orrin Hatch for “enhanced background checks.” “Waiting and hoping doesn’t work,” he says.

Enough w/the blame &amp; use of the phrase “open secret” .. the theories abt what cud have happened if more women spoke up. Change the culture.
That’s why women don’t want to talk about it, report it. The instinct is to curl up and think about how you might have done something wrong.
I must have accidentally done something that confused the person. I should have talked more about my boyfriend. Did I smile too much?
Here’s what goes through your head: Maybe my dress was too short. I shouldn’t have worn those shoes. Did I send the wrong signal?
This is so true. I cringe just thinking about the stories my mother told me abt what she dealt with —&gt; https://t.co/9LyQQeXRkh
Yes, there needs to massive cultural change. And there are so many brave, heroic women telling their stories. But it’s also ok if you didn’t
Or you face the terrifying situation as a young 20-something where your bosses want to make you part of the story to teach the guy a lesson.
This is exactly right —&gt; @lizzieohreally https://t.co/r5sYbEgfJf
Nobody should be judged for not coming forward in an upsetting situation. Nobody wants to draw attention to themselves in that way.
Sometimes it’s a lot easier to deal with creeps than to deal with human resources, or the embarrassment of telling bosses, or talking abt it
I would really like to stop reading pieces about sexual harassment that suggest the women somehow failed by not reporting it ...
