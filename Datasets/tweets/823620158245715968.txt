@BrettKavanaugh @senjudiciary It has become socially acceptable, even beneficial, to claim “victim status” in the “Me too” movement.  My question is, what happens to the accusers who wrongfully accuse their “attackers” of these vicious acts?  Nothing! We believe you and are praying for you and your family. 🙏
