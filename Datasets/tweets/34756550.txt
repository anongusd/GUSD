A major advantage that President Trump has heading into 2020 that nobody’s talking about is all his dirty laundry has already been aired, now it’s time to see what skeletons are hiding in the closets of Kamel Toe, Spartacus, Pocahontas and all the rest...
According to the Wall Street Journal, President Trump leads a Generic Democrat Presidential Candidate by 6 pts in polling in Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania...
I heard Hillary just underwent a sex change operation...		Is this true? 😆
Any Democrat Presidential candidate you’re worried about facing off against President Trump in 2020?		If so, who?

Russian Collusion is more dead than John McCain.
If Otto Warmbier was black, Barack Obama might have made a phone call to North Korea.
Otto Warmbier was held captive and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in a North Korean Gulag while Barack Obama sat idly by as President of the United States of America...
Barack Obama’s failure to act is what led to the eventual death of Otto Warmbier.

Come Election Day 2020 remember today when making your choice...		Trump: Negotiating World Peace in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un &amp; North Korea...		Democrats: Grilling a criminal two-bit shady lawyer for 7 hours over shit that means nothing to the American people...
The more Democrats resist the more Trump succeeds...		It’s actually quite joyful to watch from afar...
Michael Cohen basically compared Trump to a Hitlerian Mob Boss yet worked for the man for 10 years all while committing numerous crimes at his own volition...🤔		Hahahaha what a chump! 😂😂😂

@TheJeffBurkett Can’t have someone that served for Sessions, gotta start fresh. Clean slate.
Lindsey Graham has already said he’s not interested in the job. Trey Gowdy sounds great, but never produces results. We need someone that will get results!

@colemarisa49 Tax cuts are protected by Trump.!power of the veto!
@scott_felps Trump is our wall.
To all the Debbie Downers out there, sleep it off, take a few days and come back ready to fight for 2020.		Or be a huge pussy, crawl under your bed and suck your thumb for the next two years.		Good grief. We’re tougher than this! Cmon!
@JonasOlssen_ They didn’t really dominate, 26 seats isn’t that many... And most of those seats they won by razor thin margins.		No doubt in my mind we win back the House in 2020, especially if Jim Jordan is Minority Leader!
@ChrisBr83143864 We own the SC, no worries there!
The House of Representatives is like the cold leftover fries on your plate after you’ve devoured a delicious Burger and chugged down a Cold Beer...		Here you go Democrats, here’s some of our Cold French Fries. 🍟
An accurate description of tonight’s events is a Blue Raindrop.💧 		When the skies clear, Trump will still be President, we increased our lead in the Senate, held on to important Governships, &amp; will completely solidify the Supreme Court...		Other than that, they kicked our ass 😂
You know who’s not happy tonight? Ruth Bader Ginsburg.		Heavily controlled Republican Senate for at least two more years and most likely four!
@QAnon_WWG1WGA @rentonMagaUK And Iowa and New Hampshire.
If that’s a Blue Wave, Democrats are screwed heading in to 2020. 		Bring it on you Front Holes!
Another caveat...There were a lot of Dem House Candidates that ran as moderates to get votes, Trump and McConnell will expose these phonies &amp; get a voting record on them...		We’ll have a boat load of ammunition against these candidates in 2020 if they vote Radically...
Trump prioritized Senate over the House this Election &amp; rightly so...		Odds were stacked against the House!		Scenario A: Campaign hard 4 House, lose it, &amp; barely win Senate?		OR		Scenario B: Campaign hard 4 Senate, crush it, &amp; win House back in 2 years when odds are much better?
Another bonus to a big Senate Majority...confirming Trump cabinet nominations just got a whole lot easier...		People are going to be replaced soon starting with Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein. Mark my words!
People always asked why Trump buried the hatchet with Mitt Romney and took the high road after winning...		This is why. He knew one day he would need Romney’s vote to advance his own agenda.		Same with Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul.
@quit_lies Yes
@karldav84202052 Trump gave it his all. What else could he have done?
Best news about increasing our lead in the Senate...Trump can nominate a much more Conservative Supreme Court Justice to replace RGB due to the cushion we now have!		Amy Coney Barrett, come on down!
Democrats would trade places with us in a half second if they could...		They won the battle tonight, but we are winning the War.		Smile. We got this! 👍🏻
Give me another Conservative Supreme Court Justice and a whole host of Conservative Appeals Court and District Court judges the next two years over some meaningless power in the House...
Remember that time the House Representatives was in charge of confirming Supreme Court and other Appeals Court Judges? 😂
Republicans lost the House tonight, yet nobody protested, rioted, threw a temper tantrum or blamed Russia...		We have class! We’ll learn from this and move on. It’s called life. Not everything goes your way every time.
Republicans must fix the issue of losing in Suburban areas just outside the Big cities. This is clearly the issue in the House...		We need to get back to basics &amp; figure out how to connect w/ these voters. Dems found a weakness &amp; exploited it tonight.		Trump will figure it out!
@Surfingcity We turned out, just not at a 2016 level. In 2020 we will be fully out to protect Trump. Guaranteed!
@Surfingcity The other side gets motivated while the winner becomes complacent. It happens in all aspects of life.
@HappyBeMez Around 30 but gained at least 3 in Senate and maybe 4. Plus held Florida Iowa and Ohio Governor. 3 big battleground states for 2020.
•Reagan lost 27 House seats after winning in ‘80		•Clinton lost 54 House seats &amp; 8 Senate seats after winning in ‘92		•Obama lost 63 House seats &amp; 6 Senate seats after winning in ‘08		All 3 won Re-Election easily the following Election.		Trump did better than all 3 tonight!
@karldav84202052 It’s the nature of politics, it happens to every President in your first term after winning.
@RickModularone They have zero power still. All this does is delay things, doesn’t end anything.
This was a referendum on Paul Ryan, not President Trump...		Now that the weasel is gone, as well as some chumps in the Senate, we can move forward building a strong, united and motivated Republican Party for 2020!
I’ll take The White House, over the House, any day of the week!
Bragging about holding The House while the other side holds the White House, the Senate &amp; the Supreme Court is like celebrating a Touchdown when trailing 35-0 in the 4th Quarter...
President Trump gave it his all, he did more for his party in a Midterm Election than any President in history! We’re so fortunate he’s our leader!		We’ll get the House back in 2020 when Trump is on the ballot! Nobody said fixing America would be easy!		Heads Up! Fight on! 🔴🇺🇸🚂

@mitchellvii Bill, this has nothing to do with Kavanaugh’s character, this is simply a stall tactic for more accusations to arise. This is clear as day.
