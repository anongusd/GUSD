@Emolclause @senatemajldr This is why the House and Senate must take steps to #ReleaseTheFederalHostages . They are suffering and pawns in this whole #TrumpBorderWall #TrumperTantrum we are all seeing in front of us. The only National Emergency is the one Trump created. End this asap.

@Redpainter1 @realDonaldTrump Can't agree more. So many are working with a level of altruism this President can't even comprehend. His comments that this #TrumpShutDown is only hurting Democrats is False. A President represents All People regardless of political party affiliation, religion, race or gender.
The National Emergency isn't the Border Wall. It's the Emergency @realDonaldTrump is creating not getting these hardworking Federal Employees back to work. Trump had Bills ready to sign (House and Senate approved) before Christmas. Trump reneged on this agreement. https://t.co/S8g4elfdzn

The Fed EEs I spoke w/ today are Republicans. These people are living paycheck-to-paycheck (Stay-at-Home Mom, 3 children, one paycheck household situations).

You can be rest assured these "talented and highly skilled people" will be pursuing opportunities in other countries. The U.S. has become a joke and human rights violator. But, stay the course and carry on with #MAGA And, while you're at it, #ReleaseTheFederalHostages https://t.co/XkU8spjqMY
