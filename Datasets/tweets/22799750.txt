White House denies potus directed Cohen to lie to Congress. They don‚Äôt deny that people in admin helped Cohen plan the testimony and whether or not potus knew about those plans. Narrow answer to insulate potus from worst suggestion.

One good sign is potus pushback by lawyer is to tell us not to believe Cohen and he was not their source apparently. https://t.co/rL9ONYmlUA
I have not criticized anything or anyone. This is standard procedure. On something like this all of us try to match reporting to build the credibility of the assertions. That‚Äôs journalism. https://t.co/rL9ONYmlUA
Barriers are part of the solution but otherwise I agree. The point is to do what can be done to get potus to a deal where he does t get as much as he wanted. https://t.co/TZ6XTsGFwJ
Always the case. Of course, depends on who sources are and what they showed to back it up. Either way, it is too heavy to play with until more reporting confirms. https://t.co/pdWyfE7ESv
I think you stated it better here. And you are right by all accounts. Wall helps, but not the fix potus sells. And his crisis talk is bs. And his demonizing of who comes is too. https://t.co/BquwSbxDYU
The buzzfeed story is a powerful allegation. So powerful that if we can‚Äôt match the reporting I can‚Äôt really do anything with it. One of reporters said on @NewDay that they have not seen evidence from sources. Have to go slow because it matters too much. Major crime if true

There is too much ‚Äúwe win if they lose‚Äù in the air. Makes it hard - but potus makes it even harder by not keeping his word. Still, the suffering should be highest concern and clearly is not https://t.co/TEz9N4qW3u
Wrong. It is not a panacea. Of course a barrier helps.  Dems have funded them many times. And are offering funding now. Potus lies to you about the crisis and how much a wall will help. https://t.co/GI0Ggmlt8w
Matt - read what I have written. Potus has backed off 5b. And rightly so (ironic that he was offered that much once before and walked away). Fencing is needed. Dems know that and you should too. Talk to dhs and CBP. It is about how much and where. https://t.co/gYbNsysvuf
Yes they say that but they don‚Äôt say it is a panacea. And the amount and location of barriers and how much of the budget should go to it are absolutely up for debate. Stop drugs? Xrays ar POE help more.  Terror? Foot traffic almost irrelevant. Illegal entry? Airports are the key. https://t.co/ZA6VUYrryd

Never said it was all on pelosi. That‚Äôs stupid. I am saying we need them all to figure this out. The ‚Äúwait for him to cave‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt deal with terrorists‚Äù notions are not likely to help the suffering any time soon.  And dems are not anti border security. https://t.co/Ig5HoGbgWm

Really hope it doesn‚Äôt get to that point. People should not pay for poor politics. https://t.co/uDkwHyd0rE
Dems offered to fully fund wall. Have funded barriers many times in last. There is actually a law that provides as much from Obama admin. This is about how much and where - not abt dems being anti physical barriers. https://t.co/5a85ntGYl1
This doesn‚Äôt work for me. First, US give deals with terrorists all the time. And that tortured analogy aside, potus clearly can‚Äôt make a deal himself. No shutdown has ended without a combined effort.  That‚Äôs not ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù bullshit, it is reality. https://t.co/5Z0PELhfjl
She is clearly the only one on top of her game. I know you don‚Äôt want people to keep suffering and you can‚Äôt be naive enough to think potus just caves, right?  Only a fool thinks a deal gets made with only one side https://t.co/VwznL4CpW7
Goo follows potus. If he stops making the physical barrier the only thing that matters they will get in line https://t.co/S5d0ioD4hX
They are offering a billion+. The same amount he asked for in his budget!	They offered him 25b and he walked away.  Congress would likely vote to end shutdown but McConnell won‚Äôt do job.

Not how it reads - and says there is substantial corroboration- and I didn‚Äôt say it came from mueller. Not my reporting so I don‚Äôt know the sourcing. But it is a heavy allegation. https://t.co/Cjm3Issx71
This would not be mistake of law. Potus would go with ignorance altogether and they would have to show he did know.  IF Cohen was told by admin to lie and they helped develop his lies...and if potus was aware...hard to escape. https://t.co/njWPV3cUAW
Yup.  That will be part of the counter narrative when the report comes out. But for all the yap about missing texts, two IG‚Äôs looked and there is no good reason to question the probe. There is political reason but not factual reason. https://t.co/L2DtXzd0bj
Every allegation needs proof, whether it goes to a crime or something unethical or just plain wrong. That‚Äôs why the mueller report is essential and as much of it must come out as possible. https://t.co/7ySfHsNhuZ

They will and have. They offered 25billion that included physical barriers. They are offering over a billion now for the same. This is abt potus wanting a huge price tag, making the wall more important than all the other border needs, to prove he kept a farcical promise. https://t.co/TJ2PrghoSZ

Zero interest in big brother. America is the land of being free to succeed or fail on your own merits. Hope the vaping doesn‚Äôt hurt you. If it does, that‚Äôs on you. https://t.co/QFIGDxtjIl
It being hard does not diminish the simple truth that quitting is the only cure. https://t.co/DszuZQLbLm
If you want to quit, I hope you do. https://t.co/GRzb4ZygiP
Horrible analogy. And I am not telling anyone anything and neither should you. Reading some pieces does not make you an expert. There are many chems in play and you don‚Äôt know what vape makers really do as they are not really examined. https://t.co/R9ni0fCUSr

Depends on use. Assuming you really know. My pop quit 3 packs a day cold turkey; was humbled by the withdrawal; scared him straight. don‚Äôt know how he did it. I was unable/unwilling. Don‚Äôt confuse my concern with being blind to reality of addiction. I get it. Wish I didn‚Äôt https://t.co/PK5P3Lr51X
My experience is deep and irrelevant. Literally a lifetime of exposure to the illness.  And no counselor asks people to go from coke to booze, etc. stepping down is about reducing amounts, combos, and habits. Even then it is risky and often unproductive. https://t.co/0H7gsZMGnI
Completely consistent. It is so hard to stop smoking that often the physical addiction to heroin can be less taxing. Sometimes. Again - we are dealing with deadly addictions. I would love to learn vaping is a safe passage away from any of it https://t.co/DbXKOHnIRK
That‚Äôs twitter. I know this for a fact, smoking will kill you. And quitting nicotine is very very hard. I just won‚Äôt be surprised when we learn there is a reason all these teens can‚Äôt stop vaping. Parents talk to me abt it all the time. See it in my own experience. https://t.co/hR5h7ODBDU
Less bad. Not safer. We don‚Äôt know it is safe. That‚Äôs the point. And stop assuming vaping is the cure for smoking. We don‚Äôt know that either. I know some who called to stop. I know more who now can‚Äôt stop vaping. https://t.co/TXOkAWqYP1
Many proponents argue exactly that: that it is harmless. And we are seeing more and more cases that suggest otherwise. And the idea of stepping down from one bad to a lesser bad - is not new. And not the best way to quit any drug. https://t.co/9TlXnrtCcv
Brava! So hard to do. Congrats. Don‚Äôt smoke today! https://t.co/HM4N6gTz9z
I don‚Äôt think so - except for small trump base. One piece of advice: ignoring any positive moves by admin does not enhance scrutiny of the same; it weakens your ability to argue the negatives. https://t.co/7BxI2EWpRQ
And it may be better than smoking...but we should all agree that is a poor standard. being a smoker sucks. Very hard to quit. But quitting is the only safe course. Heroin rehab often allows people to smoke because too hard to quit! https://t.co/IW4xHRLXJ9
You are exaggerating the known to cover the unknown. And you think shifting from smoking to something less bad justifies all. I don‚Äôt. Worried about kids and as an ex-smoker...quitting is the only safe path. https://t.co/8eH5pSbnNB
How about all the vets having to tell landlords they don‚Äôt have GI Bill money and won‚Äôt for up to a year!?! Govt needs to have urgency for them that they have for wall? https://t.co/0IRgSKMsKz

They are not bots. That‚Äôs the challenge. People are so far apart when their interests are so often pretty closely aligned. Here, all want the law enforced and more judges and staff and accommodations would do that better and faster https://t.co/IkWHxc4y61
Who says?	And even if that‚Äôs true - even if a third are kids and their moms...that‚Äôs thousands and abusing one is too many. You can enforce the law and be decent. https://t.co/RKSq283BE1
Well- pols make it hard. But calling for staff and judges and a better process is very do-able. If potus is invasion-conscious, why not improve the system to help? (Assuming he wants to see a solution and not more chaos) https://t.co/Hxm2wTjh0e
Migrants are not breaking the law by coming for asylum. That is what the law allows. More judges would help. Ask for that. Being decent to migrants is not weakness https://t.co/P1TCIzZqlf
It was crowd control. Not an invasion. Look - I see your side demonizing the migrants, and those who oppose your position, are outraged and equally passionate to see brutality called out and stopped...but what matters most is leaders figuring out how to control the flow https://t.co/SWuXpeqx6s
My reaction? It is sickening to see kids in that turmoil. My job is to work sources to find out what happened and why and to expose what I can show and to plan going there to have eyes on any conflicts in real time. https://t.co/7SOYxOOLvT
That‚Äôs what we are working on now. And the 39 arrested in connection with the event. And the truth behind the 500 arrested by Mexican authorities. https://t.co/UFmegkNwkF
And you have to know who did it and hold them to account. My point is just to say that all of CBP is not to blame. Find the facts of who did what and go from there. That‚Äôs what we are doing https://t.co/CCyaSF00X6
Or not. Why not just expand the process...more judges, more accommodations, more staff...to process humanely and effectively. This is not a hard fix. https://t.co/TaUNGccIQ0
We will survive - but how we come through this is the issue: we can‚Äôt expect to process large numbers of people in ways that force families apart and create chaos. We can do better https://t.co/Ree7sdVhGf
That‚Äôs never true.  All duty requires discretion. Especially in these situations. https://t.co/PzpAShMol3
Fact-less https://t.co/VHk8rhQTtG
I keep hearing from people who know potus that they are not sure he will run. Find that hard to believe https://t.co/wXWuHowBNN
Voting is always the answer. But I would be slow to put so much pressure on mueller report (assuming acting AG or whomever is in power then let‚Äôs us see it. Mandate is to only deliver to AG, but don‚Äôt see how they can not disclose to public in some form). https://t.co/VaxVToSoFQ
Not about cleaning up. I see opportunity for politicians who find answers to this and other issues. Millions just delivered a mandate for oversight and accountability and better from govt. https://t.co/yig2q76mRz
That didn‚Äôt work https://t.co/5mcwXyXxgp
If it is true that the majority of Americans want to see migrants treated with respect and for their to be reform of the system, leaders would be placating by doing something about it. https://t.co/7a5dyq30i7
All true. But you also know it didn‚Äôt get done and the prospects for comprehensive reform are unclear - and while potus owns the greatest responsibility, i have not heard lawmakers pushing for answers here. Maybe after today they will. https://t.co/Lf4KGzVQ8N
Of course not but where did you guys get the idea that false reports are the norm? Do the research, happens but usually someone who decides to leave all they know and love and make a desperate journey are not faking. https://t.co/LupejK0Rp0
But the system matters too. Congress said it wants to reclaim oversight, dems specifically, do we have plan for migrants congregating bear border that respects them and is efficient? No word of same from potus or admin https://t.co/tswmexZHgJ
Propagandist and mendacity often go hand in hand. Real concern: we witnessed cruelty towards children and adults on border by govt, I hope people don‚Äôt pay less attention if it happens again. Compassion must not fatigue https://t.co/6ngfmmwe1p

Strong point. Word sounds great, but means something terrible. Can‚Äôt believe it is relevant in this country in this day and age...actually, yes, yes I can believe it https://t.co/8ZxG30jKAK
Whatever word - it was decisive and related to his negativity and constant attempts to divide. Potus even basically admitted he is not trying to unite the country right now. https://t.co/aURSrc8JLR
never an excuse for inhumanity. My concern:  I see more of this coming if there are not solutions to help all these people in a faster and humane way. And potus may point to that as proof of his invader pitch when his rhetoric and lack of plan helps create the problem https://t.co/g4SaQzQ48T
I have never - personally - seen gas being used by troops/cops because gas was used on police/troops first. I have seen it to deter riots and violence toward cops. https://t.co/vpjyeEd79K
Agree 100%. https://t.co/m5k8HWxSig
Agree 100%. We need to test power in #SanYsidro (and wherever migrants come together) and demand transparency. Media will have to be there. And you must see what happens and be informed. And govt has to create solutions. https://t.co/v162sUlSju
Remember the polls during Crimea ‚Äúannexation‚Äù? Do Americans want to be involved? Is that the only metric that matters? Tough situation for potus especially with all the Putin posturing https://t.co/MZrH48Zbyk
Let‚Äôs say you are right. And again, that would be a sad commentary on a nation of immigrants - and no matter what potus says, that‚Äôs what we are. We are still left in the same place. How do we fix what is going on to respect the people and the need for a process? https://t.co/xS6Btrojjc
Here is the main problem: even if everyone was acting with the best of intentions (and potus makes clear that is not the case), we don‚Äôt have a set up to process these numbers with respect for humanity and law. https://t.co/DrK8NhRmzX
Facts are facts. The politics are as obvious as the predicament: can‚Äôt leave the situation as is...can‚Äôt have thousands coming here and no system to accommodate. We have to be able to do better.  We can have respect for migrants and law. https://t.co/KBwl6rRHGb
I don‚Äôt believe this country hates immigrants. So many -	like me - are a couple generations in or less.  Potus pitching antipathy for migrants was rejected widely in midterms. Remember that https://t.co/6VPektPM5G
Problem is system wasn‚Äôt working then or now where mass movements are involved. Call out the ugly lies, hold officials to account for methods, but the main problem has to be addressed - by congress and potus. If Tijuana becomes a staging ground for thousands, we need answers https://t.co/cS9jrjdtLo
Agreed - and when I see proof of the same I go after it - enough to be a  constant target for potus and his loyalists, right? I get your point - I just think the emphasis should be fixing what is happening. We can‚Äôt have gassings and altercations like this. What is the solution? https://t.co/xkPrpE1LnG
Mass migration happened and holding kids who came alone happened but the stated objectives of being cruel as a deterrent? Casting all migrants as invaders who are coming to rob and kill? This is all a signature of this potus. Own that. https://t.co/Qvgechsh89
Oh yes he did. Bragging abt 2 senate seats? should have gotten 5 with this map. You lost 7 govs and house, in part, because potus jingoistic fire-breathing and lying was rejected across the country. https://t.co/i8PFd1kM9r
This is a good watch. It was a policy, not something they were forced into. https://t.co/313cpI1bOn
Don‚Äôt know where you get the number - but there were far too many ok with doing what was done. And we exposed it for the irrational harshness it was.  And potus got whupped in midterms peddling his migrant mendacity https://t.co/7cnFrMSSbu
Not bickering. Discussing. Not everything has to be toxic. And who said equal blame? You can play that game I see a bad reality coming and my job is to test power - on both sides - to see what they will do about it. https://t.co/eQhkyC4213
government should be able to handle this. You are making a generous offer- usually it is ‚Äúhey Cuomo why don‚Äôt you take them in‚Äù	- which is the exact jaundice potus bet on and lost in midterms.  Problem is potus was bs abt invasion but he didn‚Äôt fix or plan and now it may get ugly https://t.co/anehcfnbQ0
You are right about potus - at least as far as he has showed us to date. But spreading his feelings to all in govt is unfair. I spoke tonight to people involved and they care, they act out of pathos as much as out of a duty protect https://t.co/7Gs4LKlObL
And they wouldn‚Äôt let us see at first. And lied about it. And then HLS Secy there was no separation policy and we showed that wasn‚Äôt true and showed documents suggesting as much. We have been all over this and with good reason. And the worst may be yet to come. https://t.co/2aHkgevJ0w
I have seen lots of people, kids, elderly gassed. I have been gassed. It sucks. The situation sucks but the point is to not demonize the men and women in duty without cause and to address the problems that lead to them facing this overwhelming group of people who deserve help https://t.co/oz1OOw3NFi
I covered that fight closely; it was too big to pass. Rubio was right: immigration needs to be done in pieces. Gop can‚Äôt complain about a migrant issue and claim to be abt law and order and then not address the problems w/ the law and the order - without paying yet another price https://t.co/03tRtoSRPD
Streamline? Asylum is a process and an important one.  System can‚Äôt handle flow. There are legal and logistical obstacles that have to be addressed. Dems in house can try and if nothing else expose potus and co desire to do nothing productive - if that‚Äôs the case https://t.co/tRPkzhjuPN
I said no such thing. And you know it. They needed to simplify the fixes and they stuck to a grand gesture and got nothing done. That‚Äôs the reality. Dems have power and a chance to help. Isn‚Äôt that why they wanted power? Your left right handwringing is tired, pal. https://t.co/0rfzmusOC0
spoke to several who say potus abandoned deal w/ dems. He caved to party xenophobia aka ‚Äúhardline‚Äù. For all his bluster about invasion he has not tried to do a deal since. Potus wanted people to vote out of fear. Maybe he thinks doing nothing will make him right abt problems? https://t.co/qXpnT3alpX
This is all nonsense. Are you just a flamethrower? You really think comprehensive reform has a chance or just sounds good? They need to deal with this issue (migrant mass movement). Now. https://t.co/4sFY7Vvdvq
And we wonder why nothing gets better. Political feelings aside,  I have been with CBP folks along the border. Plenty. And I know many are latino and  I have seen compassion in their treatment of migrants. Actually did a doc on it. Check HLN On Demand: Inside with (me) https://t.co/qxzJ6Cabhc
Trump is in power, calls shots with CBP/HLS. been a constant agent for jingoism/bigotry toward migrants. Period. That said, dems have power and w/ that comes responsibility. Will this be a top priority? However, the situation may come to head before Jan https://t.co/Fw7hvnvnwr
That‚Äôs what you want to put out there. Fine. My job is to test those in power and to show the situation for what it is. And expose the problems. And there are many. And it may soon be worse. Don‚Äôt get why dems don‚Äôt front load this as a priority. Why give this issue to trump? https://t.co/i9Vd6NYiuo
It could certainly be both. Facts: The system can‚Äôt handle the flow; doesn‚Äôt accommodate the realities of who is coming and how and why. We are not a wall away. There could be 10k in TJ soon. Where is congress and this WH working on ways to help? https://t.co/sk3JO5f1If
The question is why Congress and the WH apparently didn‚Äôt even make an effort. An EO ending asylum? Legally and politically foolish. DHS and CBP are doing their jobs but the system has flaws that compromise those protecting the border and those seeking a better life. https://t.co/cWQJMKlG6U
Ignore? Ww cover potus and co lies  on immigration regularly. And I - unlike you - don‚Äôt see the need to exaggerate the already toxic hostility. I am pushing leaders for ideas for progress not platitudes. And if Tijuana gets as bad as they expect, we will be there. https://t.co/NcemJYjJ1N

Not scary at all. Rubio was good to make that moment. And we have spoken numerous times. He is no different than the others - all must be tested https://t.co/3JgyHRQhFJ
I don‚Äôt disrespect faith. Nor Rubio. I want him to be tested. As all others who are responsible for the rest of us. https://t.co/ZUEOyUVP5u
The process is flawed. Period. Not the fbi fault. Impossible position. This is not about the truth - it is about cover https://t.co/9HBWRWqNNe
Some saw that as righteous indignation and a virtue - like trump did. Others saw it as you did. Each senator must decide and then make case to you https://t.co/uhPhAraOIG
I would fight. That‚Äôs not the point.  How you fight matters. And shows what u r about.  K is being considered for a position that must be free of political animus. Each senator must judge if K showed the temperment scotus requires. https://t.co/Uq62NrdLv3
deleting this. I am all about engagement and disagreement - but I am not about adding to ha politics and using victims as fodder. Ford was victimized again - by politics. I won‚Äôt add to that. I have no fight with Mika or anyone. We must be united on respecting victims https://t.co/1KFwLZkQUw
Anyone looking at this fairly will see what is going on and that my asking for fairness to victims is not the problem. I will deal with the controversy between right and left on this - which I think is totally manufactured and unproductive on SiriusXM 124 at noon. 866-967-6887 https://t.co/jy2dP9CuqB
He has the right - but it really is not right. Even his yes men had to say it was wrong. It is far worse that that but for them that is a big step! Again - problem is Ford became a piece in an ugly political chess match. https://t.co/EdYmhYL5oJ
I didn‚Äôt watch. But I see what went on and I get the point abt the egg for @Mika. I said the same last night.  I don‚Äôt get why left and right are making this political. It is not. It is about how we treat the reality of people being hurt and then silenced https://t.co/RsQTCfMAyj
This is exactly right. I have now reviewed all the reax to @Mika - wasn‚Äôt aware of it when I tweeted. This seems really unproductive. Ford was trying to do the right thing in a bad place at a bad time. This is all abt getting K thru, not the truth of her story https://t.co/Mk4QSDzt0p
I just watched and read. Again. I get why there is a controversy that has. I thing to do with me.  I was just making a point of fairness, not looking to insult - clearly. We all want to see victims respected and heard. Let‚Äôs focus on that https://t.co/lcohTgIGJy

Touch√©. False accusations happen. The problem is that there is no earnest effort to figure out the truth. And this isn‚Äôt about harrassment or workplace wrong (which matter too of course) - ford alleges an assault. And attempted rape. https://t.co/00TfmCAqMD

First - I think the time has come for you all to show yourselves. If you want to be heard, be seen and own it. 2nd, what system? We are not in court. Do your kids get a jury trial option? No - we need to figure out what the standard and burden are. That‚Äôs my point https://t.co/SsnyGubGiV

I see it a little differently: while I agree Kavanaugh intentionally did not shake the man‚Äôs hand, the situation speaks more to how far his GOP supporters will go to insulate him. https://t.co/2rEddV1y1O
We have invited prof ford and the others on @CuomoPrimeTime. We can‚Äôt force them on and some are not ready. If an allegation is true you must remember how hard it can be for someone who was victimized to talk about it let alone to be scrutinized https://t.co/GUYC8Vx8dc
Hard to judge until you see how he answers when tested. Again, kavanaugh may be telling truth. His problem: credible allegation, friend who was very very different, yearbook gives different view and potential assessments may counter. But GOP won‚Äôt allow witnesses. Odd? https://t.co/Y87uVzyrrn
Refusing to give any legitimacy to people claiming abuse has worked really well for us so far. Odd to hear a middle aged man criticizing such a change. Not. https://t.co/JycvEYahDT

Interesting intv tactic: instead of testing #kavanaugh credibility, ask him to test the accuser‚Äôs credibility. Then follow by asking if he is surprised the New Yorker would publish such a thing (as if it was mere gossip). Quite the fox pressure cooker here.

But there will be no trial. That‚Äôs the problem, the struggle in situations like this. What are the standards of judgment? How do we proceed and discern allegation vs conclusion? Lots of agendas can mask the truth. As we see right here and right now https://t.co/M7OPMs3FwK

This is certainly not an unbiased body. The pushback on any delay makes that additionally clear. Why rush? To remove any chance of K getting further compromised. This is abt getting him thru for GOP. Not abt looking for reasons to remove him. Inherently biased https://t.co/sCUeNOxUJc

@serenawilliams class act! Telling fans to stop booing and congratulates #Osaka who was amazing. Serena could have dominated this moment but she was very generous under the circs.
You are saying she didn‚Äôt get the violation for coaching but that was only one step. Violating for racket. Taking the point. Taking a game. Very harsh moves. And Serena clearly said I know the rules. This always happens to me here. It is because I am a woman. https://t.co/4VZqkNw8UE
What will @serenawilliams say at the ceremony?  She was very gracious to #Osaka at net - and the winner here was outstanding. @ChrissieEvert made the right points about coaching and the match. Then penalty put the match out of reach though Osaka was in command.
