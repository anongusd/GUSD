From the above @WSJ article: “largely rural states like Maine need more broadband investment” - I agree. But it shouldn’t cost them their right to individual decision-making to get it.
I’m in favor of letting everyone make their own decisions when it comes to information digests. I try to diversify mine, and some would rather only consume certain things. The important part is that *we* are deciding what to consume, not our ISPs.
Here’s a hypothetical: @AjitPaiFCC’s repeal stands. ISPs decide that they should make consumers pay a higher rate to get @FoxNews, but @CNN and @MSNBC are more affordable-but you can’t afford that higher rate! Are you going to let them force-feed you that liberal media crap?

With that said, Shakur is still a fugitive who escaped from prison. That is an objective fact, and that deserves a penalty.
I’m inclined to condemn Shakur’s actions. However, I agree with the argument regarding COINTELPRO and the FBI’s potential bias.
