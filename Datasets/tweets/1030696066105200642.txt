@BitingHalberd Dig it all up and shove it on a judges desk with a licsenced attorney. Then there is no choice but to prosecute as the law dictates ....
@RealJamesWoods Financial protection act it was and still is all illegal yet they are going to attempt to arrest me again. Just to try to watch how they handle it instead of doing what is known already to be the right thing to do.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Makes America Great, guy goes to jail for trying to work. Wouldn't just accept false claims and government handouts so they formulate to force him to take them. This is not the American way I don't care what your excuse is...

@BridgetPhetasy @ConceptualJames The point is to take initiative on things that are right but not acceptable by standard. Not intentionally doing anything wrong that you can possibly conceive... Being an American not a scum bag .
@RickPainter @BridgetPhetasy This is not funny
Why are they hiding my FB account accesses from me while trying to use children for excuses? Can we have all the facts if your trying to make conclusions on inaccurate incomplete informations please?
Do people understand forced religous activities is just as wrong as actual racial violence. And is legally equal as a Hate Crime?	   	 Is this not America?
@BridgetPhetasy Do you know politically forced actions is a hate crime?

@BitingHalberd Why is that?
RT @BitingHalberd: i still like voice and internet controllable things		a lot of them are cool
America should be proud of your profits
I'm disappointed beyond repair. Don't worry, if you don't agree I'll help you get the facts straightened. Not your one sided entertainment scandal babble.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh well they will support choas, right wrong or indifferent. I'll  keep my complete opinion to my self. But these people are their own worst enemies and don't understand.
@RachelFine Looks like love at first site
@lyndseyfifield I'm in America can you describe great?

@tonyi542309991 @RealJamesWoods I don't agree
@KatTimpf If they can't take a harmless joke then they need the help that national drama is not going to help. Hell not everyone thinks clowns are funny but others love them. Don't need national hatred over  misunderstandings and "differences" that's what makes America ability of choice ..
@KatTimpf But they were only trying to be like them like some momma said. Stop being an uptight drama queen bigot. Get over it.
@BridgetPhetasy Why do you have empty actions with perceived concerns.

@BridgetPhetasy I'm not cheering for it. I wish better for everybody. But, I have a hard time feeling anything about it as a whole. I feel bad for the innocent dependants involved. But they should realize abuse of politics is also "A Hate Crime".
@ashleytisdale Can you explain who you are? I mean I don't even know if this is a real person!!
I don't want to destroy peoples careers but this may be necessary to make a point in the near future. If they don't care why should I?

We can just disable all the bank vaults too and just trust people to leave the money alone. Sound like a good plan now? Perspective people. Perspective. Now stop being childish and build the wall.
The wall needs to be built. At the very least, as a symbol stating we will put our country first. If not then gtfo. Maybe that makes you the real threat to the country then? Civil disobedience to structural security? Sounds un-american to me...
@BridgetPhetasy @robbysoave In case you didn't know...		- hue. Green, orange, yellow, and blue — each of these is a hue, a color or a shade that's true. A rainbow shows the melting of one hue into another, from red to violet, and all shades in between. The noun hue means both a color and a shade of a color.
@BridgetPhetasy @robbysoave Not sure what the hue is but, ☝️

@Ken57611603 Don't ever force your options of life (conservatism) on some one else. Including political opinion or agenda. This is domestic torture formulated for profit. And trying to force me to take action, causing myself problems to cover up others wrong doings before they get exposed.
@Ken57611603 I'm on my last nerve with the intrusion of basic rights and abuses occurring without affording appropriate actions. There reasons are misleading and wrong. This is not a joke this is not some role. I'm not ok with this.
@Ken57611603 No I'm sitting in a lobby waiting for my "brother" to drop off money. America at it's greatest. Just ask Trump. I'm not humored. At all...
@Ken57611603 These actions directly disgrace the very people who have lost there lives and, pointlessly risk their life for rights the common American obviously can't even obtain. Nor is there even decent humanity in the failed attempts if people are wronged. I'm disgusted!!!

I sit in this Lobby and wait till tonight because I was trying to do things on my own. Again for at least the third time the same people have stolen everything from me and had to start over. What's Carls doings with some of this?
Punishment for trying to do things on my own. After legal authority stealing my debit cards and taking other direct actions to force my environmental availabilities, here is my Christmas now. https://t.co/HXrj23xcNw
Dan cullett your a disgrace I'm heading to he lobby of the hotel because you formulated for them to withhold my pay you are not a Christian. You will not be forgiven.
@katierogers You guys just do that to Americans over the topic of protecting our country... They lengths people will go to for handouts and a story to tell is out of control. I'm about completely done with this whole topic.
@katierogers Then options for criminally charged and/or convicted criminals legal entry procedures that are realistic, not empty worded policy and paper work but policy to look at the person and situations involved "even ifit take active monitoring" no one is trying to break up their families
@katierogers If people destroy "americans" lives over just the topic of this and ruin holidays and waste days of life on the topic. Everyone causing problems should adopt a illegal right in to their home no questions asked. Other wise shut up put up the wall and focus on legal immigration.
What are they really trying to cover up?
How much more bs are they going to try to cover up for for sharita?
And the judge has seemed to support this the whole time, especially with using and covering up for the local authorities and their actions denying me fair legal process.
Look what you people have drug children through, and it's all long-term harrasment from the local dtf from harrassing me as a kid when I wouldn't help them like they wanted after they manipulated me as a child. Still harrassing me and has through this whole thing.
If this gets any worse maybe I can collaborate with an outside the area you journalist outlining some of these concerns, and maybe if it doesn't I don't really care at this point.
And if you can't treat a working American appropriately why would we focus or support any one of a lesser status then that?
And people try to exploit Christmas and you morons contribute to it. Who wants their god ego stroked today trying to play God?
On Christmas someone is going to force a person to these circumstances. A person that has does nothing but work, you have to go to these lengths to disrupt their life. This is the deffinition of how bad things happen.
What is the full description of santcuary cities? Does this include the authorative politics also?
@IvankaTrump Do you know what kind of position I'm in now? How can you smile?
@PhilipRucker You do not disrupt an Americans life in the interest of screenwriting to this point. They always want a one sided story... I wonder why? Their story will never hold up to facts that they steal.
@PhilipRucker If I were only to explain the insane actions people have taken to prevent me from even filing taxes recently like it's a joke. I'm disgusted. This is not a joking matter at this point. I'm done playing your fool.

@PhilipRucker I think, so I will make the statement. The only thing they (the Democrats)wanted was a (tax payer funded hand out) vacation and we the people were their ploy to get a nice long vacation on us the stupids.
Hopefully people don't allow things to get to the point of blame discussion after something terrible happens. So sick of seeing so many games being played. Then blame being shifted by the people causing the problems.
@HillaryClinton Ya Merry Christmas to you too, but guess who's not and why?
Merry Christmas...
@justinbieber Shared my pain enough already... Merry Christmas Justin!!!

@IngrahamAngle That's just my opinion while your on the topic of children "democracktic" parties...
@IngrahamAngle Ya why where at it let's abandon all other security measures in America. Do you know how stupid that sounds. The fact that the wall will eliminate the "breeding" of children to run accross the border with frowned upon drugs should be enough for everyone's support. But hey...
@DearAuntCrabby @jeffgartner @realDonaldTrump Hear that kids, just do like this lady... Great ideas you morons

@PressSec The damage of false allegations and accusations can be austoundingly unrepairabely damaging. So if your going to act like you care at least be intelligent about it. That's all....
@PressSec before you senselessly badger an individual who tries to tell it to you straight...
@PressSec I'm gonna go with a 90% chance that the FBI is investigating, however every wrong doing undoubtably probably leads right back to their own. That's why there has and will continue to be so many misleading stories. Aim your anger correctly and understand an accusation......
RT @StevenTDennis: It was like a week ago Cotton confidently insisted this bill would not pass.
@USMC That's awesome what about the Americans being abused right here on our soil. Who has sacrificed so much only standing for rights of his country. To only be rediculed for others profits?
I am not ok with your invasions of privacy. Do you understand plain English?
So sick of this religious cult forcing actions in my life, look here your illegal actions are beyond acceptable at this point. And stop trying to use children, as your lame excuses. That is so pathetic at this point. People are way too far out of line.
@Pink I think that IS  the ugliest cute thing I have ever seen .
@VP @usairforce @LockheedMartin @SpaceX Make sure to get some good videos...
So tired of seeing the false allegations for "private/classified" information exposure tactics being used. It is lame and sick and quite overplayed at this point. Find another day job if this is your best efforts at your current positions.
@AndrewShimmin @SwiftOnSecurity Sure blame it on the Aussies the only one you haven't heard blamed in the last 5 years. Them and antarticans if that's an actual word.
@TARSENSRD @SwiftOnSecurity Anti hater avoidance clearly. Haters are real if you haven't heeerrd.
@JellyRoll615 Lol
@realDonaldTrump The cost of following false threats alone without it would justify the expense to America funding it themselves. Even if there is a projected return Mexico will pay for it even if it is initially funded by America. Come on people use your Brian's... This is just rediculous.
@realDonaldTrump Truly should be deciphered pre-court.

Laws are unfair and wrong, especially when misapplied. Period
You give me any individual in politics, with their detailed past experiences and unresticted access to the records, I will show you a criminal "technically", not literally. It's the way the laws are wrote. If you don't apply them appropriately then that's a crime too.
