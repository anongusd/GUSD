@mavengoechea @AshleyAnneYo @rpetty @browardschools Absolutely not, the criminalization of ALL students is not okay, but who does it ONLY happen to?... STUDENTS OF COLOR.  Also, who‚Äôs condoning violence? You missed several points ma‚Äôam.
@rpetty @browardschools There has been several fights this year, not only by ‚Äúcombatants‚Äù of color, but yet I haven‚Äôt seen the same energy poured into those fights. Hence why this again, promotes criminalization of black youth. Time to change that culture. We don‚Äôt need that to address school ‚Äúsafety‚Äù.
@rpetty @browardschools The race of the ‚Äúcombatants‚Äù matters, because it promotes that narrative whether you aimed for it or not. Yes, it‚Äôs happening at MSD, but fights also happen at nearly every high school across the nation. It shouldn‚Äôt now be a priority to ‚Äúfix‚Äù just because it‚Äôs happening at MSD.
@rpetty @browardschools Comments on this post such as ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù and ‚Äúanimals‚Äù are not ok. I don‚Äôt condone violence but I don‚Äôt condone the criminalization of black youth either. We can make schools ‚Äúsafer‚Äù without that narrative. Using this video to promote school safety only amplifies that narrative.
@lyliahmtaylor SAY IT AGAIN!
RT @lyliahmtaylor: Had the video been of some white kids, it would‚Äôve been ignored and they wouldn‚Äôt have been called ‚Äúanimals‚Äù or ‚Äúthugs‚Äù.
I hope we can stop the criminalization of black and brown youth while promoting school ‚Äúsafety‚Äù. Stop perpetuating that student of color are a ‚Äúdanger‚Äù and are ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù to promote your own personal agenda. That is not ok, no matter who you are.
