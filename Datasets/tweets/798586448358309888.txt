@DineshDSouza speaking at #RTM2018 days after being pardoned.
Earlier this week, a @realDonaldTrump judicial nominee was confirmed 95-0. Despite this, he still drew a Democratic filibuster. This unprecedented obstruction is why @SenateMajLdr had to cancel the August recess and why the #BlueWave is going to crash into a #RedWall in November.

Great to hear @KellyannePolls at @FaithandFreedom #RTM2018. No one takes the fire from the #FakeNews like she does! People like Kellyanne are getting the Trump message out despite hostile outlets so we can continue to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Today I remembered how thankful I am that everyone in the Presidential line of succession is a Republican. On top of that, @realDonaldTrump is ensuring that the judiciary will remain conservative for years to come. Good time to be alive!
