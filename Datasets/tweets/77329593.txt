@mrsolsonsays @AOC @realDonaldTrump I understand, and it's very subjective to say the least.  Just noting that a lot of people are more concerned with the sound of a woman's voice than they are of a man's.
No matter how much evidence #MAGA gets that they'e fallen for a con man in @realDonaldTrump, they will double down in their investment in those lies because they are what holds together their own damn identity politics.  It's sick.
Every GOP member in the #CohenHearing today is awfully mad that he lied to Congress last time he testified.		Are they upset he lied? Or upset that he got caught? Because those same lies are STILL being maintained by Trump and his cronies and that doesn't seem to bother them.
Michael Cohen giving his closing statements directly to #MAGA is powerful and succinct:   Don't make the same mistakes I've made by overlooking the truth and basic decency to support a man who has no concept of what America stands for.  #CohenHearing
The entire GOP half of this #CohenHearing doesn't have a single question about Trump's status as an unindicted co-conspirator in  campaign finance felonies. They do, however, have lots of tweets and random news articles that must be part of the record.   #pathetic

@ballendraaister @jasoninthehouse Yeah "Trump has been a scumbag in every era of his life so that disproves that he was a scumbag in order to become president" is such a great defense.
@realDonaldTrump "He did bad things unrelated to Trump" does not erase the fact that Michael Cohen is going to prison for felonies YOU directed him to commit on your behalf, @realDonaldTrump. You are an un-indicted co-conspirator, Individual 1.  Enjoy another Adderall night from hell.
@realDonaldTrump I'm starting to get the impression:  Urine a lot of trouble @realDonaldTrump

Bravo @RepKatieHill for drilling down to the clear evidence that a sitting president of the United States conspired to commit felonies by fraudulently skirting campaign finance laws.

@psstpassiton @peterdaou Moreover, before Hillary announced she was the most popular Democrat in the field. She was very popular as SoS.  But yep, they dumped their bullshit campaign of smear anew and the media played along.  And a lot of Sanders supporters did too.  Most did not, thankfully.
@psstpassiton @peterdaou I could not disagree more. The GOP has methodically sought to create negativity and fear around every leading Dem, regardless of record. Obama, Clinton, Clinton, Pelosi. Being a victim of their crap is a sign they fear you.

@psstpassiton @peterdaou I didn’t blame him. There is much to admire about him and he almost had my support.  The point is that he was held to a much different standard and that is not going to happen again.
@psstpassiton @peterdaou He never received the unending scrutiny in the press that she had for 20 years, and the reason being, few in the press thought he was a serious contender. They enjoyed the battle and fanned the flames.

@Abbyroad713 @MsMollyRachael By the way Gail, I have to go but I wanted to say something about your situation you mentioned earlier. It’s unfortunate people don’t understand the limits you have in your life but I hope you know it’s not a failing in any way, but a victory for self-care. So I applaud you!
@Abbyroad713 @MsMollyRachael That may sound like a very sad story to some, and I don’t mean to minimize the pain that comes with the territory that I know so well, but your story is one of strength.
@TobyBerry6325 @RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Oops!  That was meant for someone else!
@TobyBerry6325 @RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael In some ways, yes. I have a niece and nephew who are very nice, kind hearted people. But they lack some basic manners about this kind of thing, or even saying thank you. Learned behavior!
@Abbyroad713 @MsMollyRachael Yes. I think of depression as a set of symptoms as opposed to a specific illness. I say that because it seems so often the condition is specific to each person, their personality etc. That’s one of the reasons why I think self-care is so important.
@TobyBerry6325 @RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Oh I totally agree but I wasn’t necessarily referring to other depressed people. It’s just a common every day thing that people get wrapped up in their own stuff that they lose perspective of how much we all suffer in similar ways.
@Elisabeth_Drcy @pinata1138 @siano2020 Amen.
@Abbyroad713 @MsMollyRachael Thank you Gail. That is very kind of you. Are usually don’t get personal on Twitter but it seems this is an area where we must.
@TobyBerry6325 @RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Yep! Empathy can be taught to a degree but that usually happens in early childhood. Moreover, people who have traumas or suffering of their own are often so wrapped up in it that they don’t notice others with similar predicaments.

@sayitlikeitis52 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael I interviewed a woman once who said something incredibly simple that floored me:  "Sometimes you just have to let yourself be happy." There's a ton of context to that I can't get into here but there's a truth there. We need time and love to make that "letting" possible. ♥️
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Sounds vry familiar! I use to beat myself up for missing out, as if that form of self-care were a flaw instead of a necessity. I have way overdone it out of fear of the worst but I've also, at times, challenged that fear + prevailed. That must come from a place of security/love.
@megamouthmedia That's hard. I am sure that even now, I am probably not "fully me." But a piece of this has been learning to accept that the "fully me" I thought I was was an illusion. Part of me is depression.The battle is to keep room for the rest, the part that makes life rich. Are u ok Barb?
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael TY. Very kind. And that works both ways! I've maintained open channels w/ a few who love me + know me well. I'm lucky in that I always have somewhere to go. But mostly, I've learned self-care. I fail at it from time to time but at least I have a tool belt to turn to when needed.
@goodbye56789 @RichWnKS @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael I agree but we must do it with care. We owe it to ourselves to protect that which is tender and private to the degree we need it. We sometimes do. And we owe it to others not to overlay our experiences on others as if they are necessarily a fit. They may not be. This is humbling.
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael I'm sorry for the suffering you and your daughter each have had to face.  I was really struck by the connection of depression and anxiety in my own case.  Each of us is unique in our situation but perhaps your anxiety helps you understand your daughter. That's something.
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Today has me thinking bout the dbl-edged sword of our anonymity to one another. One 1 hand, I reflexively distrust or at least take w/ a grain of salt the support I receive from a stranger. On the other, I recognize it can free me to both help + receive help. Our common humanity.
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael This is by far the most public I've been about it. I still struggle w/ how open i can be b/c part of MY self-care is not letting this be a dominant force in my life. But another part I'm finding even now is that acknowledging it, normalizing it is ok. It's not about me after all.
@RichWnKS @goodbye56789 @TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Wow.  Thank YOU. I cannot lie:  I've been selectively closeted about my depression for most of my life.  Some of that was shame and some just self-protection. Most people do not get it and it's exhausting to respond to their good intentions or, worse, indifference.

It causes us to only look one way, and not able to see the future. And in the past, it remembers just the dark or the lost. The present is what can clarify, can clear the fog.

@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Given that you live in the dark and dreary north like me, I encourage you to give dawn therapy a try. All of our hormones affect our mood and energy. They start (or don't!) their cycle when the sun rises. If we don't sense that, we need something to replace that kickstart.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael It was said elsewhere in this thread but bears repeating: One thing that can help is finding a way to focus on others – not pleasing them or being something for them, but finding a way to just be there for others. If nothing else, helps the spirit &amp; takes the focus off ourselves.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Ugh. It's tough, Tracey, I know. That this thing messes with the clarity we need to find our way out is the real bugger.  I've really had to learn self-care (which we should all learn anyway). When we need others, when we need to be alone, when we need to focus on simple things.

@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael All this means that I find a way to accept both sides of me, even the illness. I make use of it. I embrace the fact that it teaches me understanding. I sometimes feel depression is my superpower. It gives me vision. But first I had to accept that I needed help &amp; deserved better.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael But when I find a way out, that complete immersion in the darkness feels distant and has little power over me. Instead, I've stepped into a river of warmth where one kind word, one beautiful shimmering tree can suddenly light a way. I can remember what it means being fully me.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael When I've been depressed, it feels like I've stepped into a cold and dark stream where I am connected to every depression, sadness, trauma, heartache and anxiety of my life. My memory and sense of the dark of my life is acute... and I can't remember happiness, what it feels like.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Anybody have any questions about any of this, ask! You need professional help through this hell but some of it is just practical guidance w/ what feels like an interminable fog.  I'll leave you all w/ this observation:
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael BUT it's really going to differ per person what will work. i will say this though: If too much or not enough or irregular sleep is at all a problem, that's HUGE. But fixable! I got a dawn simulator w/ a normal work light + take vit D3 daily. Your circadian rhythms are crucial.
@TraceyBVoice @MsMollyRachael Anti-depressants + therapy. The drugs were tough because I had to cycle thru 4 or 5 before I found 1 that works. Hardest part. The therapy was super helpful for many reasons but, in general, it helps you separate out the illness from your reaction to it, the part you can change.

@MsMollyRachael I’m so sorry.  I have spent decades of my life in the very same place and it seemed it would never end. Know that you are not alone. It really can get better and it will be so worth holding on for.
@pinata1138 @siano2020 This exactly.  I hate to oversimplify, but we have one party that is pro democracy and the other that proactively works to undermine democracy. All the things we want depend on us acknowledging that and defeating the anti-democrats.

@TheAesculapius Armando, I appreciate the civil dialogue but I have to get to work.  I wish you a good evening – and I thank you for your service.		If you'd like to understand why this problem exists here and nowhere else, I encourage you to read this: https://t.co/HmD0MyJrXE
@TheAesculapius No one is going to ban guns.  You are arguing against it for no good reason.		Also, you are wrong.  Guns are NOT illegal in Mexico: https://t.co/e2FRVeEcKH
@TheAesculapius There were literally no new gun regulations during that time.		We regulate cars for safety and car deaths have gone WAY down... but we have more cars than ever.
@TheAesculapius You keep arguing against the banning of firearms.   I haven't argued FOR the banning of firearms nor is any mainstream politician.   The fear of guns being outlawed is so rampant because it sells guns.  So stop falling for that.
@TheAesculapius And where do you think they get those firearms?  From the US mostly.
@TheAesculapius No one is proposing that only gov't officials be armed.  That is, literally, propaganda.		Are you denying that for 8 years there was endless concern that Obama was going to take your guns?  Are you denying that gun sales went UP during that time??  Those are both solid facts.
@FaaaaaaaaaaaH_Q Yep. I see it a part of our national psychosis.  Way too many people don't quite believe this problem is real, of the massive proportions it is and that it's unique to the US. It's a fantasy reality sadly.
@TheAesculapius 40,000 gun deaths EVERY YEAR is a national disgrace and tragedy.  We have more guns than ever but it's not made us safer. The opposite.  We have to acknowledge that we are responsible for fixing this. Blaming liberals for gun-free zones doesn't solve anything.
@TheAesculapius This is bogus propaganda you've fallen for. The NRA were screaming that Obama was coming for your guns. Over 8 yrs, no guns taken away... but boy that propaganda saw a HUGE increase in gun sales.		Criminals in Australia and UK don't find a way to get guns. Only happens here.
@TheAesculapius 5 police were shot.  Were they not well armed?		The problem isn't that the employees weren't armed.  The problem is that an employee WAS armed!
After every single mass shooting, there are countless clips of locals saying "I never thought this would happen here."		It happens everywhere in America. The problem is national and the solution must be nationwide.  #genuineNationalEmergency #Aurora
@TheAesculapius Um, dude.  The shooter was staff.
@MrDane1982 More ice cream

@Cannibal_Sauce @RockyinTX There is, however, a self-correcting mechanism in the construct of the Republic that has worked from time to time and is available to us now – but we have to do a little growing up in order to embrace that. Two steps forward, 1 back, 3 sideways....
@Cannibal_Sauce @RockyinTX As I see it, the core problem is cultural. We have a self-identity that is way too often self-serving and adolescent. This isn't a Christian nation but a nation that by &amp; large believes in their own personal prosperity and no one else's. Meanwhile, lots of happy talk on morality.

@Tucson_Ron @MarkDice 3.  Thank you for your service.		Now I simply ask that you cease to make assumptions about me and my POV simply cuz you disagree. Everything u have accused me of, u have done in spades on your timeline.		I have little interest in back &amp; forth but you deserved a response. Cheers.
@Tucson_Ron @MarkDice substance, it's this smear.	2.  I don't care what you think of the term "whataboutism." The tactic of saying "so and so" ALSO smeared somebody is irrelevant to the question of whether this is a smear. It's a sexist, disgusting low-life smear.  What others do doesn't effect that.
@Tucson_Ron @MarkDice cohorts who support this smear should be ashamed of yourselves.  You want better politics? Then focus on the issues, for one. Dice is on this smear campaign literally while she's spending an hour on TV answering the public's questions in great depth. But rather than respond to

@CasiArgiud62 @Lawrence Yes, and as a billionaire, he thinks he can skip past all the messy work of building coalitions etc and just jump right to the top of the ballot.  This ego trip + the Electoral College is a fine way to bring about more GOP control.
@theterribletoo @realDonaldTrump You have been mighty sheltered if you think big business can be more trusted than gov't (let alone more efficient). Without gov't, what's going to keep them in check?  You think taxes are theft?  I suppose what Wall Street did in '08 was a-ok, huh.
@Lawrence The more pertinent question is why can't/won't Schultz run as a Democrat?  Does he think he can't compete in a field of people that includes centrists but also plays to our nation's cry for a more representative gov't??		The last thing we need is another billionaire.

@Khanoisseur Among those 8 denials ARE a few technically true things.  That doesn't change the fact that he had massive conflicts of interest and lied about it.		Again, his 8 denials, each containing at least 1 falsehood: https://t.co/QK8zyXqzLX
@Khanoisseur Finally, your argument is based on framing the whole debate on Trump saying only narrowly "I've never completed any real estate projects in Russia."   		That's not what he said. "I have nothing to do w/ Russia."  Plainly a lie.		8 times: https://t.co/QK8zyXqzLX
@Khanoisseur No. You're responding to 1 aspect of what I've said.  First, all of those customers were paying way above market value. Why?		Second, Trump's business has always relied on loans.  He couldn't get loans from US banks anymore for all his bankruptcies so he got loans from Russia.
@Khanoisseur The whole reason Trump was being asked about Russia was because of obvious conflicts of interest.  He replied, "I have nothing to do with Russia."  And yes, afterwards said, "deals".		But whatever the wording, he absolutely had more than 1 egregious conflict of interest. He lied.
@StevenBeschloss Mike Pence was the US gov w/ the LOWEST approval in the US at time he was chosen.  Paul Manafort had never run a national campaign and hadn't worked in US politics in over a decade.  		Naw, nothing fishy going on here...
@Khanoisseur His own son said they got all of their money from Russia – and there is extensive reporting of Russian oligarchs buying up Trump properties in the US at way above market value,   Not quite "I have nothing to do with Russia."  In fact, more like, "I already owe tons to Russia."

@bigthink Well then, Elon.  What’s keeping you?  You can afford it.
People forget that what Trump wants more than ANYTHING is justification for firing Mueller.  If Mueller breaks the  rules of the special counsel law – i.e. revealing findings to the public w/o AG review – they’d have that. My guess is the statement was compelled by Whitaker.
RT @TheRickWilson: They should be in protective custody. https://t.co/HKC3CUXXSG
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek I don’t think a rational explanation is grasping but that’s just me :-)		The bottom line is we don’t know the underlying facts and how corroborated they are by evidence. We will eventually! Can’t wait for this clusterfuck to be over.   Have a good night.
RT @goldengateblond: What a year we've had this week.
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek @TwitterSupport @realDonaldTrump Of course he works for us.  But he has to follow the law and the law says he defers to his boss and the AG.  The law says he reports his findings to them, not to us.  You can't blame him for not telling us what's up. He's not allowed to.  Cheers.
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek I don't either but you don't seem to understand that Mueller is not independent. He doesn't get to decide what we hear when. That's been a huge part of the Barr hearings, for example. Mueller is working for a pro-Trump AG that has authority over him and may well have forced this.
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek He doesn't work for us.  He has a boss (2 bosses, actually), and he doesn't necessarily get to decide what is made public. That's written in the special counsel law. For all we know, Whitaker said "You have to deny this story"... and so he did to degree allowed by facts.
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek I know, that sucks.  But, in the end, it's not going to matter.  Whatever the facts are of this situation, THAT will have way more consequences than Trump's incessant spin.
@Aygent_Orange Thanks.  A decade old but the eye's still the eye 😉
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek I don't think it's Mueller's job to be transparent now.  He has a special counsel law to follow and superiors to answer for. For all we know, the JD demanded he put out a clarification w/o revealing the truth. 		Comey, OTOH, proactively inserted himself into the story. Big diff.
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek If there's a mess now, that was instigated by the leak, not by Mueller. He's by the book. If he's not ready to reveal, we don't necessarily know why. We've had 2 years of half the country taking every news report as gospel. But they're the first draft of the truth, not final say.
@Aygent_Orange Ha!  That's my eye.  (An old headshot, not very RSL.) https://t.co/LgJWqTXPiQ
@shelly2161 @comehithercreek Fair points but I feel he was put in an impossible position.  He hasn't leaked but, in this case, he had to clean up after somebody's leak.  Right now the expectations game is insane and the nation is on edge.

@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Could you explain how the party is supposed to "purge" a duly elected senator?  That's not the party's job.  That's the job of the electorate.  Organize and purge by all means!  But don't pretend that WV is just waiting for the DNC to give them an AOC.  Doesn't work that way.
@UWantZamoraThis @Testudo23 @rules_follower @marcushjohnson Oh, so the half of the country that doesn't reliably vote are all secret democratic socialists waiting for a democratic socialist to show up on the ballot? Absolutely, we need to give them something to vote for. 1 way you do that is to show that progress DOES matter. The ACA did.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Sorry but Obama absolutely did NOT run on a message of radical change. It was a pragmatic Dem message and a central message was unity and bipartisanship, not radicalism.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson By all means run candidates as far left as you like.  I'm all for it!  But if they don't win the primary, you back what you've got.  There are WAY bigger factors in elections than just perceived ideology. Structural barriers are a huge part. But so are demographics.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Andrew Gillum just (barely) lost in Florida.  He was plenty progressive and an awesome candidate.  Was his electoral strategy flawed?  Not that I can see. Florida had disenfranchised hundreds of thousands of voters.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson So every close race is because the winner just didn't have a good enough strategy?  That logic is laughable, sorry. Some districts are more conservative. Lots of other factors, yes but some districts are very hard to win. We need electoral reform big time; that'll help.
@Testudo23 @rules_follower @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Yep, she squeaked by because she had extremely high Native American support – which the GOP just tried to disenfranchise.  And turnout among NA was higher in large part because of Obama.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Heitkamp didn't win by some fluke. She won, in part, cuz she reflected her voters who – guess what? – are more conservative than AOC's voters in NYC.		I'm in a district that went blue for 1st time ever. It was an open primary field w/ several good candidates. DCCC didn't pick em.
@Testudo23 @rules_follower @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson Yes, we are more polarized than before –  but the upshot is we DO have a more progressive Dem party than before.  And when you look at the agenda, it shows.
@UWantZamoraThis @rules_follower @Testudo23 @marcushjohnson I do too. Work and make it happen.		But when you don't get every seat you want, u work w/ what u have. You don't get progress by holding out for your own single perfect idea. Sorry. Social Security? Super flawed when originally passed. Now 1 of most popular &amp; effective programs.
@rules_follower @Testudo23 @UWantZamoraThis @marcushjohnson I'm all for electing more progressive Dems.  The *party* is not in charge of purging conservative Dems – nor should they be. Talk to the voters of WV, MT, LA and ND.

@newtgingrich You're delusional, Newt.  You're counting on your usual ass-kissing talking points to reach only those living in a Faux News unreality bubble.  The Dems are 100% behind Pelosi.  Trump can't say the same about the GOP.		And you know it.  Enjoy the Trump hitting the fan!
@ElizabethMTHC @jasoninthehouse @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Actually, you don't get it. The bills were written and PASSED in a fully GOP congress.

@lesliern92 It was just raining like usual here... until you hit the pass and boom!
@VickyMaybin That's where I grew up.  Lots of hazards abound!
@AlfredAmericanX Oh, I know.  I'm just being playful.
@swinnickmd Exactly!
@artbyhobo @Ardamora 😁  Thank you.  I'm honestly shocked how many people are concerned and wishing me well.  Very heartening quite frankly.
@Ardamora EGG wackily!  It's a funnel for  shitty weather.
@Ardamora @artbyhobo I'm okay, really.   The impacts were on the side of the rear and I didn't feel much where I was.  Even the truck survived okay.   But yeah, it was close!
@watergatesummer Thank you.  Me too!
@analienteacher Thank you!  Gratitude all around.
@Cheryl17878578 Thank you.  Me too!
@TBrno11 Thank you!  And I agree!
@WhirledCitizen_ For you?  Of course.
@JudyAronson5 @PattyThomas Yes, indeed.  It was the rear that smashed, thank goodness.  But still, it was not looking good there for a second!

@jzanier468 @bgail2 Agreed.  If they want to spin off some of their work for charitable causes, awesome, write that off.  But otherwise, no.  YOu're a business.
@___lor__ Me too!   I have been dead a number of times before and it wasn't really all that much fun.  This surviving thing is so much better.
@crews_elinor Thompson is going to have to have a bit of a makeover after this.   But she's still got her get up and go, so I'm grateful.

@bgail2 @jzanier468 Legally, it mostly is.  But too many politicians fudge it when it comes to their public face.  It's just such weak bullshit.  I would like to see people being FOR things that we should all have in common and do not conflict with a free multicultural society.

@artbyhobo I'm strangely giddy.
@bgail2 @jzanier468 Oh yes.  It's definitely FAR more prevalent.  For me, while absolutely atheist, I don't like to define myself that way because it puts my identity in relationship to god/no god... which is extremely secondary to me.  I have faith in love, gratitude, compassion, humanism, science.

@calgrabsback @jzanier468 Yes, I decided that the insurance was a goooooood thing.
@AlfredAmericanX Everyone is saying this!    What they don't realize is that the only way to do this is for me to march half a mile in the snow/rain to my truck and get back on the road from hell to go get said ticket.  NOT gonna happen!
@StacksTindal I'm making a negroni and wrapping myself in bubble wrap.
@Linda06737183 Yes, elongated into surreal slo-mo...    In the words of James Comey:   Lordy.
@bgail2 @jzanier468 I love people of faith (most of the time).  I don't begrudge others their beliefs.  I find anti-theism to be almost as obnoxious as anti-atheism.  It's the proselytizing that bugs the bejeesus out of me.		Do you believe in Bee Jesus?

@MFL1956 Yes!  Cheers to 4WD!;
@Kerr_Kurr Thanks.  Yeah, there are basically 3 miles RIGHT at the pass that are ALWAYS the worst of whatever bad weather we're having.  It's a little hairy at times.

@sciencechick1 I'm going to try to channel it into baked goods....    You know, Christmassy stuff.
@FireZMissiles yeah, it was heavy rain until RIGHT at the pass.  It's the only way for me to get home.  I live in the mountains where it's winter storm half the time :-)
@SDSF3333 Haha.   I think I'll just count my blessings instead.
@happyloner Me too!  It was brutal out there!
@SaneDaysFan Sure, I welcome a miracle.  But I will still hold them accountable for taking us this far down the path of ugliness and shame.
@debenjoylife Mmm. Dunno.  It hit the back two corners and broke stuff I had packed in the bed but up front where I was didn't feel much of an impact.  Kind of two glancing blows that smashed out reflectors etc... but luckily didn't kill me dead 💀
@jzanier468 I'm an atheist but yeah, it's still something I say.   "My lucky stars" sounds positively loony.
@SaneDaysFan It's not impossible.  But she's a bit of a whacko TBH.  But Arizona's got a Dem now so there's hope for the future of this recently purple state.  👍🏽
I just survived a spin out in driving sleet on I-90, my truck smashing against a wall but avoiding getting crushed between two semis.   So how do I feel?  L-u-c-k-y.  It might be time for a... refreshment.
@SaneDaysFan I don't think it's quite as awful as people think.  The Republican governor was going to pick a Republican no matter what.  She lost narrowly.  So he can make the case that she'd been vetted and was a credible candidate...
