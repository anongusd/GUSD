@BernieSanders Please drop out.
@NYCSpeakerCoJo Huge loss for the City. And your single greatest failure as Speaker. You really hurt us with this one.

@CarlHeastie Same day voter registration!
@zellnor4ny 1/2 scanning machines down at Brooklyn Central library. VERY long waits solely because of this.
@NYCVotes @BOENYC one scanner at Central Brooklyn Library and very long lines. Get it together
@maggieNYT This headline is crazy misleading. Almost 60% say they definitely or probably will vote.
@SenatorCollins You‚Äôre a never ending disappointment
@SenRonJohnson What about his lying?
@IngrahamAngle you understand that all of those groups include women, right?
@JohnCornyn Disgusting
@zellnor4ny Done! Your volunteers in front of Brooklyn Central Library (just one, not the other) need to be more aggressive. Many voters entering without a leaflet.
@MiguelSeabra @serenawilliams Thin skin. Not fit for the big leagues. He should be in the chair for juniors.

@Delta how is the wait time on the platinum reservation line 59 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes!? Ridiculous
@Delta sitting on the tarmac for over an hour because of paperwork. DL 6136
@Delta DL 418 is delayed by an hour because your crew left a door open and the cabin flooded. Including my seat 6A. Do better.
@Delta don't offer your first class cabin hot breakfast and then announce that only cereal and cold food will be served üôÑDL 1879
@jigginup Which polling place?

Productive day!!!
I'm just going to do everything I need to in 3 weeks. No biggie. Or...drink? Hmm...
I'd rather be on Bondi. Outlining my life away.
Danielle, it's dragonforce, not rancid. ugh.
HGH
