You'll forget your first childhood crush, but you'll never forget your first quadruple-OT #NHL game. It was a Game 7. #Islanders beat #Capitals 3-2 on a Pat LaFontaine goal. It became known as the ‚ÄúEaster Epic‚Äù because it started on Saturday but ended on Easter Sunday.
I watched a #Yankees - #RedSox game in 2015 that lasted 7 hours! I didn't tweet in 2015, so you'll just have to take my word for it. Almost as miserable as the #McEnroe-Wilander tennis match that lasted that long. And once saw a quadruple OT game between #Islanders and #Capitals.

@kcjss The only reasons to have kept it was for emergency calls related to the kids or calls that would be to both me and my wife. Those types of calls are few and far between now. Definitely not worth having a landline. Cable is also worthless to me.

Paul McCartney used to perform with a really good lead guitarist named Jimmy McCulloch. I always wondered why they stopped working together after 1979. I guess his dying in 1979 had something to do with that. (June 4, 1953 ‚Äì September 27, 1979) #Wikipedia

I went from #SusanGordon lending me "What's Up, Doc?" to Laurie Jacobson's Davy Jones tweet of 2/29/12 to @SherryKondor like to @Carole_King writing for #TheMonkees to Davy to Marcia to Maureen McCormick to @TheRealEvePlumb. Yes, I was good at Trivial Pursuit Baby Boomer Edition.
It's a Sunshine Day is a great album, btw. And kinda weird how I got from #TheMonkees and Davy Jones to Eve Plumb just now. @Therealeveplumb https://t.co/0ptTj79OcD
Nobody tell Maureen McCormick, but I always liked @Therealeveplumb more.  Jan had to overcome adversity, while everything went Marcia Marcia Marcia's way, except that time with the football. Plus, #EvePlumb was exceptional in Dawn:  Portrait of a Teenage Runaway and lots more.
I'll never forget the time Marcia Brady got to meet Davy Jones. I always wondered if Davy knew he was really meeting Maureen McCormick. #Monkees #TheBradyBunch
Davy Jones of the Monkees was British. I always just assumed he was the reason for the funny spelling. #humour
Teens today are so dependent on GPS that most haven't even noticed yet that house numbers are in sequence.
43 minutes when it said it would be 29 to 39. Pretty close to the projected time of arrival. It's hot. That's the important thing. It was cold when she got lost the last time. She blamed her GPS. So I suggested she have a map for backup. She said, "What's a map?"
Steve Wynn is trending. I'm sure that can't be good. #SteveWynn #RNC
I saw #BarbraStreisand in "What's Up, Doc" at the Newton Drive-in in Newton, NJ when I was shorter than that dude from Game of Thrones.
Maybe getting 8 hours of sleep last night was the result of doing 96 minutes on the treadmill yesterday? First time I've had that much sleep in a few years. Or maybe just exhausted from all the nights staying up late watching the #WinterOlympics from #PyeongChang2018?

Working on a comedy film about a towering figure of Hollywood who becomes eccentric and clones dogs. It's called "Off the Rails!" So far I've come up with the idea &amp; I've tweeted the title.		p.s. I know there are already 5 films with this title, but mine has an exclamation point!
One of the most underrated (and best) comedy films of all time: What's Up, Doc?  #BarbraStreisand
She was once a towering figure of music, stage and film.
280 characters is a long way to travel for a punchline.
Feels like the #WinterOlympics were a million years ago.
I had four Lifetime Memberships at video stores. The last one was at a place that's now a physical-therapy center. I went to get treatment for my knee. She asked me if I had a referral. I handed her my Blockbuster card and said, "I don't need one. I have a Lifetime Membership!"

Oh, wait! Also just read that Barbra Streisand cloned her dog a second time. Funny lady! #barbrastreisand
@Nobilis That's good. LOL What made me think of it just now is that I noticed that Davy Jones of the #Monkees passed away on February 29, 2012.
Actually, my friend is getting married on February 29. I said, "Why'd you choose that date?" He said, "This way I'll only forget my anniversary every 4 years."
Do you ever worry that you will die on a February 29th and that people will only remember every 4th year that you died?

Attention span when listening on #iPhone approaches zero, to use calculus terminology. Last time I listened to an entire album, from beginning to end, on my iPhone, was back in 1989. Meanwhile, last time I listened to an entire album, start to finish, from a CD, was right now.
It comes with a 100-page lyric book and pictorial history, which I could one day read if I ever get around to getting eyeglosses.
23,000 songs on my hard-drive, tens of thousands a click away in various websites I use -- I suppose I could survive with just having this 10-CD set on CD and not on my iPhone, iPad, PCs, USB drives, Amazon Fire, and so on?

Getting to 300,000 subscribers on YahooGroups, Topica and ListBuilder (previously ListBot) by September 2001 was the easy part. The time-consuming part was generating the content to push to these people, all the while only caring that they click on my Dell and Avon links. LOL

I can write a joke about anything, but it'll cost you extra if you want the joke to be funny.
@MsWonderland That one probably won't play as well with the Trump supporters.
@claw71 Maybe that also explains how the notoriously poor foul-shooting Wilt made 28 of 32 foul shots that game? I bet Milt was the good foul shooter.
I don't want to be just another statistic ... unless that statistic is Wilt's 100-point game against the Knicks. https://t.co/LBYbgv7Pq9

It took 90 minutes to buy nothing. Which is quite an entertainment bargain! 		I've got Rhapsody in Blue #NowPlaying on CD player in the living room. That one was 67 cents. I think it's performed by either London Philharmonic or the International Silver String Submarine Band.
I suspect this one will be associated in some way with @SherryKondor's mom, but it would be helpful if #FYE put the music artist's name with the album title. (Okay, I drilled down and it's a Carole King 2-CD set with 36 songs.) https://t.co/KUIEsRqLyU

Very impressive that Natalie Merchant can still command $9.99 for a USED CD at #FYE. I got Mariah Carey's Music Box CD for 56 cents.

@mousewink I was just wondering if you'd changed at all, and if your hair, was it still red.
I'd have to say that my favorite of the DIE HARD films was Dye Hardboiled: the Easter Bunny's Vengeance.
@mousewink You know I had to go right to IMDB from your #DieHard reference. De'voreaux White played Argyle. And I can't believe it is 30 years since Die Hard was released.
It's hard to believe that I walked all the way upstairs for that slight gag.		And now I have to walk upstairs again to put the LP away, so I might as well tweet LP back before I do.		#VelvetUnderground https://t.co/JXvZbG5nE2
I used to think that when they said something was a "sight gag" that they were saying "slight gag" because I never found them all that funny.

I read an entire book dedicated to #AndrewJackson's "Bank War," but I can't recall a single thing about the subject.

I've only seen Groundhog Day once. Watched #SusanGordon's DVD copy. That's also how I saw Some Like it Hot. I'd not seen it before. She'd bring it with her from 2003 through 2010, but we never got around to watching it. Finally watched it in her living room on October 17, 2011.

The part of Inception that still confuses me is the part that takes place in the snow resort or hospital or whatever it's supposed to be. Also confusing are all the other parts of Inception.

@blaineblaine You can't tell from this photo, but there was a 2nd-floor bedroom. One bedroom on 1st floor. And there was a porch on the back.
Here's our next-door neighbors' log cabin. We'd spent a lot of time visiting them. The cabin was demolished a few years after I took this photo in 1996. It was a Sears-Roebuck mail-order log cabin. Google that and you'll see it was really a thing. https://t.co/t2GON8Ajyf
This house was 3 houses down the street. We owned this little house before moving up the street to the 4-acre lot. I took this picture with that same digital camera on May 17, 1996.

This is one of the first digital photos of me. It was taken May 17, 1996. I'm drawing a blank on the brand of camera. Nothing u ever heard of. It was $900+. I returned it because it took terrible photos indoors. It wasn't great outdoors either. https://t.co/5ZOvRnfwEb
I used to sled ride in the woods next to our house. We had 4 acres of treacherous land, so, technically, we had to trespass on the neighbor's property to find anything remotely safe to sled ride on. Still crashed into trees a few times. Explains a lot, right? #Bobsleigh https://t.co/WGlphkNTXA

Okay, so in 1994 I start making interactive CD-ROMs using Visual Basic 3. By 1995, this www thing is getting big so I start using it, as well. Then I build these huge followings on ListBot, eGroups, and Topica to drive traffic to my own websites. I was up to 300k subs by 2001...
That's how I began burning CDs before 99% of you knew that a CD could be burned at home. My first CD-ROM drive cost $1060, purchased from a place called Dirt Cheap Drives. Thank God it was "dirt cheap"! LOL A year earlier that same drive cost $15,000, two years earlier $30,000.
So, we make the big advancement to get the stuff to go to CD-ROM instead of microfiche. Don't tell TMZ, because SAG was on those CD-ROMs. Anyway, it was like THX-1138 over there in Woodcliff Lake, NJ. But, again, it was just as boring as you might think.
At first the script information was on microfiche. For those of you who don't know what that is, count yourself lucky. It was all SQL, so I have no clue why the stuff was ending up on microfiche. I don't think anyone knew. It was like Logan's Run, people just accepted how it was.
I ask my manager what it is. She says that employees have to submit a form requesting reimbursement every single time they get a prescription filled. I'm like WTF. She says, "Yeah, it's so these companies can avoid paying for coverage." Nice, right? Asshat billionaires. 2/2
I'd read the contracts between these huge entities and our company. CALPERS was one. Another was Halliburton. We're automating everything so u people can go to CVS and hand a card and get your script. So I see one thing called "Direct Submit"... 1/2

One last point! This was same the same semester I was friends with Dr. Tetevi Dodgi Logovi from Togo, Africa. I had more in common with Tetevi than with the kooks in that D&amp;D Big Bang Theory room. Tetevi was 35 and living in the dorms. He was a medical doctor learning English. https://t.co/gOw4GXYQOQ

I've gone bowling only 3 times in my life. First time I bowled a 123, third time I bowled a 134. I can't recall what I bowled the second time.  I probably didn't bowl a 300, because I think I would remember that.
In this sample photo, my bed would be the one with the zig-zag comforter.  The D&amp;D game was at the far end of the room, so I had plenty of space to escape if things turned violent over there. LOL https://t.co/w3X0x5TWYS
It was a really atypical dorm room. None of them drank alcohol. They were locked in on D&amp;D from noon Friday until late into Sunday night. No showers. They'd order pizza and wings. They'd come and go sporadically, so it wasn't always 10 of them in the room. Here's a sample room. https://t.co/EQkKxeq3pa
To complete the story, these roommates were a lot like what you see on The Big Bang Theory, except they only had ONE girl for 8 to 10 guys. I didn't spend much time in that room on weekends. It wasn't fun like the TV show. I was ostracized for not playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons! LOL

@RodochReagan The harassing tweet is gone, so I guess all's well now.
And to continue the story ... these 8 to 10 guys would not shower all weekend. The room smelled like a locker room by Sunday. EXCEPT, sometimes the ONE girl they knew would come to play D&amp;D. On those rare occasions, the room reeked of every soap, shampoo and deodorant imaginable.
As previously noted, ***** was annoying to live with, but he was nothing compared to the winners I lived with next. These 3 guys would invite 6 or 7 of their friends to our dorm room each Friday afternoon. Then they'd all spend 60 hours playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. #TrueStory

King Creole was the best film #Elvis ever made. As for the best premise for any film he ever made, it definitely was NOT this:		"An incognito nun tries to help a doctor clean up an inner city ghetto, with the pair growing closer as time goes on."		#MaryTylerMoore #ElvisPresley
Just read that Yuna Kim was so worried about falling on the ice at the torch lighting that she wished the principal had called for a delayed opening ceremony.		#WinterOlympics  #WinterOlympics2018 #PyeongChang2018  #PyeongChang #PyeongchangWinterOlympics
I attended an all-boys Catholic high school after attending public school from pre-k through 8th. The biggest difference? The boy-girl ratio.
In high school, we were instructed to do "creative presentations" for religion class. So I wrote a comedy skit: "The Last Supper: Why Jesus Dined for Our Sins". Needless to say, that was the last time they had us do "creative presentations".
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
I also have the original Russian theatrical-release film on DVD. The commentary track is so overly serious that it seems like a practical joke. #Solaris #Solyaris #Tarkovsky https://t.co/N95JwvADhe

I've been through it all, I've seen religion, from Jesus to Paul. How do I sleep? Not at all. Well, unless u televise a snore fest, replete with Korean techno pop. Then I get 5 hours of sleep, This is still the network that gave us Leno at 10:00. And Lauer. Can't forget Lauer.

Yeah, so last year I ordered Tripping the Live Fantastic on CD for a dolar, but they sent me Alabama's Greatest Hits. Can't even imagine what FYE's warehousem is like to cause that to happen.
I can sum up my entire childhood in 2 words: Evel Knieval. My life would be bliss if only I could break every bone in my body at Caesar's Palace.
I was so into Elvis as a kid that I knew the difference between Spinout and Speedway. Neither was quite The Manchurian Candidate. Sinatra had better management. He had connections.
When I was growing up, I wanted to be like A.J. Foyt and Richard Petty. Then came December 20, 1978 and that class trip to the Winter Garden. Never saw another Elvis movie after that night.  Change of habit.
Gotta give Garth credit for trying to boost a genre that Patsy, Hank Williams and Johnny Cash made matter. I do love Faith Hill, but they threw her back years ago.

Look at me blaming "I Love a Rainy Night" for the downfall of country music when I stayed loyal to Paul after Ebony and Ivory, with its lyric so weak it makes one wonder if he didn't die in that car crash in '67. But then who wrote Blackbird?
Add Korean techno-pop to post-Eddie Rabbit country to the list of music that won't be filling any gigabytes in my 75 gig music collection. I called it a night at 9:15pm and now I'm wide awake at 2:52am.

Look at me with the discipline to wait the full 18 minutes before sending this tweet.		My personal Twitter theme song should be Led Zep's "Ramble On"!		Quell is such an odd word. It's like a hybrid of quest and Prell, so "quell" should mean "search for shampoo". 		#RandomThoughts
I was reading that the "half life" of a tweet is 18 minutes. That's a level of optimism I can't relate to!
I'm afraid to read @KatieCouric's tweets because I fear she might be tweeting #PyeongChang2018 spoilers.
I'm wearing my rally cap, so that's why stocks are up today. Also, easy to be up 300 points when you're already down 2,700 points.
If you're old enough to remember the "agony of defeat" guy falling off the ski-jump hill, you're probably old enough to know that Meadowlark Lemon and Curly Neal were better basketball players than Michael Jordan and LeBron ever were.

My tweets are semi-autobiographical and loosely based on reality. My next-door neighbor really is from South Korea, but the conversation didn't go down quite like that. Also, Angie Dickinson was making "Police Woman" when I was in elementary school, not college. I improvised.
I don't really have an all-time favorite skater, but @ScottHamilton84 skating to "Rocky" music was memorable, even on a 12" black-and-white TV.
Next-door neighbor is from South Korea. I asked what the biggest difference is between life in South Korea and life in the U.S.. He said "Well, the biggest difference is that people keep asking me what the biggest difference is between life in South Korea and life in the U.S.."
It's safe to say that the worst skater I ever saw on NBC was Meredith Vieira. @KatieCouric probably knows what I'm referring to here. #NoJokeHere https://t.co/2DO0Ho0l6Q
The all-time greatest skater name was Elvis Stojko. Every night he'd be the last skater practicing, and every night the security guard would lock the door to the ice rink behind him, and think to himself ...		wait for it ...		"Elvis has left the building!"		#PyeongChang2018
It pretty much doesn't matter if they try to spoil it for me by telling me the name of the person who lights the flame, because it'll be someone I never heard of &amp; I'll have already forgotten the name by the time I watch it later. Plus, I'll fall asleep on the couch and miss it.

When I was taking Major American Writers 2 in college, the guy sitting next to me, turned to me and said, "Emily Dickinson is dead, right?" I said, "Of course she's not dead. I just saw her in a new episode of 'Police Woman'!"
When Pocahontas was born in current-day Virginia in 1596, her parents never could've predicted that she'd die in England. When Jan Janszen Van Breestede was born in Denmark in 1596, his parents never could've predicted that he'd die in current-day New York. Death's unpredictable!

Parade of Nations is trending. Probably because I just tweeted about it. Or maybe because it's 14 hours ahead of me at #PyeongChang2018?  @katiecouric

Which #WinterOlympics sport is your favorite? And you can't say Snow Shoveling, because that goes without saying.
Right now Grayson Allen and Bill Walton are trending as if the #Olympics aren't on. This is what happens when #NBC starts the Olympics a day too soon, plus the overwhelming charm of Grayson and Bill.
Every day you'll wake up and the Olympics will already be almost over for the day, but NBC is saving them up for you to look at later. I think that's the direction this goes.
