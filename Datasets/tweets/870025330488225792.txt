@IronStache When will we start putting our feet in our #VETERANS shoes? A good example is to think.... What if it was your father, brother, son, mother, sister, etc... COMPASSION. Understanding what it means to SERVE YOUR COUNTRY. Ultimately understanding the realities of WAR.
@IronStache It seems in our time today in #AMERICA for veterans there is a lack compassion and many do not understand the realities of #WAR #veterans face when they return.. #invisiblewounds. It takes compassion to dig a little to fully understand.. When will we find the time? When?

@Paulaminger1 @RepMarkTakano @HispanicCaucus @VetAffairsDems And yes we should be taking care of our 100% physically wounded Vietnam veterans but never choose to go against other veterans in need. #ALLVETERANSMATTER.
@Paulaminger1 @RepMarkTakano @HispanicCaucus @VetAffairsDems And let's be honest the last thing on a veteran's / #combatveterans mind returning from #WAR is their citizenship as most believed it was automatic as they were promised citizenship during recruitment. Afterall, you did lay your life on the line for this country #honorably
@Paulaminger1 @RepMarkTakano @HispanicCaucus @VetAffairsDems Again, biased anti-immigrant views cannot possibly reach a solution 2this specific issue which is very sad 2see in our country. #ALLVETSMATTER. Vets who serve return with mental difficulties-fighting horrific experiences locked inside their minds we may never understand. #PTSD
@Paulaminger1 @RepMarkTakano @HispanicCaucus @VetAffairsDems No this racist anti immigrant agenda our nation is falling in2 is outrageous. You fight in combat/ risk your life then come back and speak on behalf of our #combatveterans and all vets who have experienced trauma due to their service 2our country.  Sounds like a #va issue 2me.
@Paulaminger1 @RepMarkTakano @HispanicCaucus @VetAffairsDems Perhaps your response needed to be addressed. #Allveteransmatter #havesomecompassion
@MichaelFore @Drat56 @RepGutierrez @Suntimes Untreated #PTSD perhaps?

@spearsmariel Some end up in "detention" centers  (basically prisons) ; for months/years fighting their case on their own or if lucky w/laywer (probono)
@spearsmariel This threatens their citizenship &amp; causes difficulties w/their immigration status. Some end up deported as they are not appointed lawyers.
@spearsmariel Most appeal their cases with the VA. This process can take years. Most are left suffering from #PTSD and run into trouble with law.
@spearsmariel Returning from war/service they suffer from #PTSD. Apply for benefits with VA seems less than 20% actually get help the others are denied.
