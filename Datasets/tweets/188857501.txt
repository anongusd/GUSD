"Don’t leap to the conclusion that impeachment is necessary," Holder said of how House Dems should go about investigating the Trump administration. "I mean, let’s find out what the facts are. Hold hearings, elicit evidence." https://t.co/eXVBXITQhz
Holder on the Green New Deal: "This is our generation's moonshot ... I think the aim is perfect." 		But says he's not yet fully familiar with "the guts" of the deal. https://t.co/NkgTFSDrHO
Reporter: Has President Obama urged you to run [for president]?		Holder: Let’s just say I don’t talk about my conversations with my favorite people. 		Reporter: Have you had a conversation with him about this?		Holder: Yes.
(h/t @TomBeaumont for that question framing).
Holder said a decision would for sure come before Selection Monday (March 18)
Holder on timeline for a decision — 3-4 weeks, as previously reported, but "I’d say closer to 3 than 4" (this elicited a concerned "ok..." from his press aide). 		"In my own mind, I have some dates," Holder said.		"Okay, well let’s not share those right now," his aide replied.
Question: Is there space for you in the field of Democratic presidential hopefuls? 		Holder: "I think what defines whether there is space, whether you have the vision, the experience, the ability to inspire others to deal with the issues of the day." https://t.co/T8Fm9dXBgW
Update: A gaggle! So we have remedied this oversight.
Holder wraps up, zero questions about that whole maybe running for president thing.
Holder: "Justice Departments are best when they are independent. They get in trouble when they are beholden to the White House."
Holder says his "biggest failure" as AG was "my inability to bring about sane gun safety legislation."
Holder says his worst day as AG was going to Sandy Hook in 2012. 		"I remember thinking: America's gonna do it. This will be the thing that drives us into a more sane gun regulatory system…if every American had been with me that day, we would've been successful."
Question: What do you wish you would have had more time to work on as AG?		Holder: "Gun safety legislation."
Question: "What do you think is the biggest threat facing our democracy?"		Holder: "Person or concept?"
(the fuller context there is that Holder thinks it's important for college students - much of the audience here - to know you can have a satisfying, fulfilling life and career even if your talents mean you're not going to be "the next Beyonce" or a basketball star or something)
"What I hate is when we tell kids they can be anything they want to be," Holder says, because it's not true. 		If it were, Holder says, "you would be talking to an ex-guard for the New York Knicks"
Audience question: "What’s your advice for aspiring attorneys?" (This event is at Drake University). 		Holder, after pausing for a beat: "Study."
Jeff Sessions becoming AG had a chilling effect on that effort, Holder says: "He was always kind of an outlier, he was kind of, you know your crazy grandfather who you like but don’t really listen to. And suddenly, he was AG. And he put the kibosh on criminal justice reform."
Holder talks about the bipartisan support for criminal justice reform. Recalls a meeting that pulled together reps from Freedom Caucus, Koch network, ACLU, Center for American Progress. 		"Remember the bar scene in Star Wars? One of those kinds of things."

RT @sgrubermiller: "I'll be here the next day" if anyone tries to get rid of Iowa's nonpartisan redistricting process, Holder says, to appl…
Holder: "There's some great Republicans. Some of my best friends are Republicans."
Holder calls out Freedom Caucus-ers Meadows + Jordan  — "They can spout all the crazy stuff that they spout and not worry that somebody's gonna say, 'hey, we want a sane person,' because they pack districts with— I wouldn't say insane people, but people" who are more Republican.
Holder says the dangers of gerrymandering is lawmakers are more concerned about primaries than generals, so it pushes them to partisan extremes.
Holder: "Remember the Women's March, with those, uh, interesting hats..." (he got a laugh)
Holder points to the Iraq war, when the country was willing to spend trillions of dollars and send troops to war in order to give people there the right to vote, "yet we're going to make it harder for people here?"
Holder says if he were still Attorney General, DOJ would have looked at things like "cutting down on the number of days people can vote" and "the proliferation of voter ID laws"
"It’s especially good to be out of Washington DC now ... among some kind of normal people," Holder jokes
(the grammar in that tweet is terrible, and I am sorry)

"We cannot separate these issues," she adds.

Gabbard says her concerns about the Green New Deal include that it doesn't address nuclear power and fracking, and "the idea of creating make-work jobs in the federal gov't is something that I think is a problematic concept that's proven to have failed in other countries"
Gabbard: "I'm still reviewing the Green New Deal. I think there are some positive aspects to it. There's a lot that's vague and that's not clear."

a note: this speech was delivered on a stage surrounded by palm trees, with water in the background, and was preceded by a solid hour of singing and hula dancing performances.
Gabbard: "As your Commander in Chief, I will work to end the new Cold War and lead us away from the abyss of a nuclear war that could destroy our world in mere minutes"
Gabbard also embraced one of the things she is most often criticized for — that she met with Assad when in Syria. 		"I will have the courage to meet with both friends and adversaries in pursuit of peace and our national security," she said.
The rationale for Gabbard's candidacy, based on this speech, is calling for a shift in foreign policy, and getting the US out of armed conflicts — "I will end the regime change wars," she promised. https://t.co/syOtbeoPhR

Q: What can Dems do to change your mind? 		Schultz, with another AOC reference: "I respect the Dem Party. I no longer feel affiliated because I don't think their views represent the majority of Americans. I don’t think we want a 70 percent income tax in our country."
Schultz on how he would have handled relationship with Saudi Arabia after the Khashoggi murder — "How could we turn a blind eye to that situation? So if I would have been president at the time, I would have placed serious, significant, acute sanctions on Saudi Arabia."
How would you run against Trump? 		Schultz: "First of all I think President Trump is a very insecure man, and that insecurity is really manifested with all those attacks … we’re not gonna get in the mud with him."
Schultz on the calculus of deciding to run: says he'll "huddle" with wife and kids, "and then I think we will see over the next three months if we can ignite a national movement for a better choice."
More @HowardSchultz	on selling the Sonics: "This was a big mistake on my part. I’m human, I’m not perfect, I can’t undo it, and I feel terrible about it."
ARS: "There are a lot of people in Seattle that are very unhappy that you sold the Sonics in 2006"		Schultz calls it "the biggest professional mistake I’ve made"
Schultz asked about @AOC advisor saying existence of billionaires is "failure of the system."		Schultz: "It's so un-American to think that way…I think there is a problem that she has identified. But I think the way she’s going about it, unfortunately, she is a bit misinformed." https://t.co/nhNzWdKL09
2020 bingo: Schultz talks about the "dignity of work" cc: Sherrod Brown
Q: Would you drop out if polls showed you would help Trump win? 		Schultz: "If I decide to run for pres as an independent, I will believe, and I will have the conviction and courage to believe, that I will win…I certainly will not do anything to put DT back in the Oval Office."
Schultz: "If a Democrat were to win the White House in 2020, is there any evidence to anyone here that our political system is all of a sudden going to change and people are going to start working together? There is no evidence of that whatsoever."
Schultz shuts down any possibility of deciding to run as a Democrat. "No," he says. "If I run for president, I’m running as a centrist independent."
At which point he gets shouted down by protester number two, who yells: "healthcare is a human right!" a number of times.
Schultz, asked why he wouldn't run as a Democrat — "I would have to say things that I know in my heart I do not believe, and I would have to be disingenuous," he says. Says the left is calling for free healthcare, free college, guaranteed job.
.@HowardSchultz — "Donald Trump, if he is the Republican nominee, and there’s likely some questions about that..."
Schultz, justifying a third party vote, argues that in the current system, 7-10 states determine the outcome of the presidential election. "What if an independent candidate could create a 50 state race?"
.@HowardSchultz on Trump's tweet: "I think he’s been on the wrong side of almost every issue. And he’s clearly on the wrong side of this."
"I don't agree with his conclusion," @HowardSchultz says of Bloomberg's comments
The protester got booed. 		But some scattered applause when Andrew Ross Sorkin (who's interviewing Schultz) reads Michael Bloomberg's comments about the issues with running as an independent.
Protester stands up almost immediately at Schultz event: 		"You'll help elect Trump, you billionaire, egotistical asshole. Go back to getting ratio'd on twitter. go back to Davos with the other billionaire elite."

Kamala Harris - “I think that folks realize that we cannot take for granted that the right thing will happen in an election. The only way we can be sure of the outcome is if we weigh in.”
Asked about elex stakes, Newsom echoes Harris: “a lot of soul searching right now about who we are ...this is not who we are. It’s not reflected, at least, in the nightly news. It’s certainly not reflected in the White House and Washington DC right now. We’re better than this.
Newsom: “What makes California great is we don’t tolerate that diversity. We celebrate that diversity.”
Newsom, to huge applause in the auditorium - “I love all this caravan talk about refugees. But this is a state that brought in 112,000 refugees in just the last 15 years. We are a state of refuge.”
Gavin Newsom on 2018: “If you’re like me, self- medicating watching Rachel Maddow. It’s been tough. Not good for the liver. Not good for the heart.”
Kamala Harris mentions Charlottesville, Tree of Life - “We’re gonna have to speak those truths that must be spoken ... racism, anti Semitism, sexism, homophobia are real in this country.”

Jeff Flake's 2nd trip to NH this year wasn't supposed to be a thing. Then Friday happened.   https://t.co/pE9KSY46ug
Flake calls for a change in political culture so that hyper-partisanship: "will be punished at the ballot box … When you come to destroy and not to build, you will pay a political price"
Flake: "I, for one, am waiting for the additional information that will come from the supplemental FBI investigation to inform my decision on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination"
"There’s a sickness in our system and we have infected our whole country with it," Flake says. "And that was just last week."
Jeff Flake takes the stage at St. Anselm Institute of Politics in NH. “When I titled this speech ‘After the Deluge,’ I meant that metaphorically,” he cracked. “I hadn’t counted on an actual deluge.” https://t.co/UxotRkiwq9

As for House candidates to whom Trump might lend his efforts, source familiar pointed to John Chrin (PA-8), Gianforte (MT-AL), Danny Tarkanian (NV-3), he'll be in WV-3 today (Carol Miller is the R candidate), and also mentioned "contested seats" in Kentucky.
No specifics on which races/candidates Trump would focus on in those states.
per a person familiar with the president's thinking, Trump will hold campaign events (rallies/fundraisers) in as many as 15 states over next 6 weeks. Those states include: 	North Dakota	South Dakota	Missouri	Montana	Nevada	Kentucky	Tennessee

To be sure, Wagner had been gearing up for a Senate run, and that Trump stuff is part of why that didn't happen. And that also meant she had Senate candidate money ($2.98 million, as of 7/27). 		But still interesting that she totally avoided backlash.
something I found interesting last night — after the Access Hollywood tape in '16, Ann Wagner unendorsed Trump.		Other Rs who did that have had rougher primaries — Sanford lost, Roby got forced into a runoff, etc. 		But Wagner got no serious primary challenge. She won easily. https://t.co/gsPr7TamuH

Also, while I'm emptying my notebook here, I'd like to better describe the Bobby Bright rally that led to me interviewing him in the middle of a field near some piles of  cow dung, because there wasn't room to really convey the wonder of it in this piece  https://t.co/gjdPNnFRuR
TBD if that comparison holds in #AL02 – it's still early in the vote counting.
In Grimm's case, that didn't translate into votes — he got crushed. On election night, Grimm told reporters Trump's endorsement had been more determinative than he'd known. https://t.co/bpUte8b5o2 https://t.co/WPrBXIZQCr
Grimm, like Bright, said Trump's endorsement of his opponent didn't matter, that Trump had to make deals with the GOP establishment and ppl understood that. https://t.co/uGuO7HJlUr
Another similarity: Grimm voters kept telling him he they saw him "everywhere." Bright's making a similar case - that he's been everywhere talking to voters and Roby hasn't been around.
One man, when I asked why he was backing Bright, told me he'd known him since grad school and,  "If I'd've had a daughter, I'd've been glad to have him as a son-in-law" #AL02
Also - lots of Grimm supporters said they were backing him bc they knew him personally or had had some personal contact where he helped them. 		A lot of Bright supporters said the same - many said they knew him since he was mayor of Montgomery
Roby v. Bright has some similar to Donovan v. Grimm on Staten Island a couple wks ago — former rep challenging the incumbent they lost to; challenger running as a Trumpian candidate, only to have Trump endorse the incumbent
Also, possibly the best quote a candidate has ever said to me: 		"She told the president to step down and get out of the way, and then she went — every time he pooted, she was there to smell it," Bright said of how Roby got Trump to endorse her. 		https://t.co/ujewGNIENq #AL02
Bright: "Martha has compromised herself as a legislator, you know, when she is now in a position that she has to support everything he offers … If she doesn’t, people say look, look, look, she’s not supporting him again. So she knows she’s there as a rubber stamp for the pres"
In an interview, Bright basically said Roby had sold her soul to Trump in exchange for the endorsement, and therefore she would no longer be able to be an independent representative of the district
Bright's slogan is "Make District 2 Bright Again" — which he had emblazoned on red hats for supporters — so he's had to do some rhetorical adjustment in the wake of Trump endorsing Roby https://t.co/NVnWcFZlLx
What Brian said - Trump endorsing didn't make anybody forget what Roby had said about Trump   https://t.co/q15MUixdEK
A take on Bright's Pelosi vote: "I don’t see a lot of difference in voting for Pelosi for speaker + voting for Boehner for speaker," said Riley Seibenhener, chairman of Geneva Cty GOP. "They’re both really hard core estab folks who want to continue things the way they are" #AL02
"12 years ago everybody in the state was a Democrat," one Bright supporter told me at a rally Saturday. Besides, he said "I still can't get over Martha Roby asking Donald Trump to 'step aside.'" #AL02
Bright and his supporters say his past as a Dem doesn't matter bc he's conservative. 		One man said he'd been "leery" of Bright. But after talking to Bright at a Friday event, he felt better — said: "he's a lot more conservative," even when he was a Dem, he was "his own person."
Bright, fwiw, has other speaker ideas now. He mentioned (in order): Mark Meadows, Mo Brooks, Gary Palmer, Jim Jordan (but he'd have to "clarify" Ohio State stuff first), Steve Scalise. 		Kevin McCarthy? "I’m not enthusiastic about him at all"
The fact that Bright was a former Democrat has given Roby an easy attack line: He voted for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. And she's hit him on it repeatedly.		For example: https://t.co/6yntzheSW2
Polls are closed! #AL02
a sampling of that sentiment: 		"not out speaking to the people" 		"I don't know her, I don't see her," said one couple, who said they'd seen her more this campaign than ever before, but that it was hard to have an opinion of someone they never saw. 		"Won't return calls"
A common thread among Bright supporters — they said they felt like Roby was never around, wasn't available to her constituents, didn't show up to things —
@agustuspinel She got 39 percent in the primary, so now she's in a runoff with Bobby Bright. Trump endorsed her after the primary, before the runoff.
The above quotes from a mix of Bright supporters, Roby supporters, and people who didn't want to tell me who they were supporting.
A sampling: 		"Just having Trump endorse somebody is not going to make me vote for them" 		"I'm gonna vote what I think best regardless"		"We vote for who we like"		"not really" 		"That's his personal opinion"		"I thought it was a backdoor deal up there"		#AL02
I asked Rs in the district this weekend if Trump's endorsement had swayed them in any way. The answer? Meh.
As Bobby Bright made a point of noting in an interview, a Trump endorsement hasn't been a guarantee of success in Alabama this past year. He endorsed Luther Strange (who lost to Roy Moore), and then Roy Moore (who lost to Doug Jones). https://t.co/3fAbBWhnut
But unlike Sanford, Roby spent post-2016 making nice with the administration. So instead of a tweet bashing her on election day (like Sanford got), Trump endorsed her in late June. And then a lot of DC Rs calmed down and felt like it was fine. #AL02
Roby only got 39 percent of the vote in the primary. Which is...not great. https://t.co/kvmc3L3uTV
DC Republicans have been worried about this one since the beginning. It's not a good moment to be a Republican in a primary who didn't support Trump (See: Mark Sanford). https://t.co/nO2Bc3k2eL

RT @VaughnHillyard: Part of an exchange with Michael Grimm today. Lots of folks on the ground have echoed these lines: He pushes aside his…
Pat and Teresa voted for Donovan. "He's more for Trump as far as I know," said Pat. 		"And we're for Trump," added Teresa. 		It was Grimm going to prison "that was the deciding factor," Teresa said. 		"I don't trust him after him going to jail," said Pat. #NY11
RT @ShaneGoldmacher: Lara Trump has also recorded a video for Dan Donovan https://t.co/WEZt1Y3EzK
Joe said Grimm’s conviction didn’t bother him. “I feel like they had it in for him” bc he’s a Republican. “He got a raw deal.”		And what he did, Joe said, just wasn’t that big deal. #NY11
“I didn’t like Donovan’s view when it came to sanctuary cities. That really turned me off,” said Joe, a Grimm voter, leaving the polls.		When Trump endorsed Donovan, “I was a little bit confused about that bc I am a Trump supporter. But I couldn’t go against what I believe” #NY11
“Forget about the Republican Congress and what they’re doing,” Teresa added. “There’s no backbone.” She again pointed to the family separations. #NY11
Teresa voted Dem. “I am sick and tired of Trump. I cannot stand the slime…I cannot wait until he’s out of office.”		“I don’t even want to talk to my sister anymore,” she added, “because she thinks he’s a human being.” 		She cited the family separations, among other things. #NY11
Abe said he likes Trump as a president. “I don’t look at his character anymore. I look at his accomplishments. I think he’s done quite a lot.” 		He doesn’t like the “dumb talk” from Trump, but he likes what Trump’s doing. #NY11
Abe’s a disaffected former Democrat. He switched his party affiliation today. “I never left the Democratic Party. They left me.” #NY11
“I love Michael Grimm. I think he’s a great person. I think he was railroaded ... like Trump was,” Abe said. #NY11
Abe switched his party registration from D to R today. It was too late to vote in the R primary, but he wrote in Donovan anyway.		The Alabama elex, he said, “is weighing on my mind. That’s why I went for what Trump said.” Otherwise, he said, he might’ve voted for Grimm. #NY11
This is Cheechie. He and his flowing locks were waiting for his owner outside a Staten Island polling place. #NY11 https://t.co/u6873ooaIV
“I only vote Democrat, I’ll never vote Republican,” said Anne. 		“If it was a Republican running against a camel, I’d pick the camel.” #NY11
Frank was another Donovan voter. “As someone said, in the general election, Grimm could not win.” 		Trump’s endorsement, he said, was “not really” a factor. #NY11
@JamesArkin The voters here are chatty!
Jerry is voting for Donovan on the basis of Trump’s endorsement. 		“If he recommends him, there’s gotta he a reason,” he said. 		Besides, he said, Grimm’s already gone to jail once. Who’s to say if he’s “mended his ways.”  #NY11
RT @Robillard: !!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/iOKzgEn4Yo
Another woman, a Democrat, was frustrated to discover her registration meant she could only vote in the Democratic primary. 		She wanted to vote Republican because she didn’t think “a known felon” should have a shot at being in Congress. #NY11
Greg backed Donovan bc he’s the incumbent, “I believe he knows what he’s doing.”		Also, he said, noting “this is kind of a joke,” but Grimm’s last name brought to mind the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. 		“I don’t want fairy tales,” said Greg. #NY11
Pat and Frank voted for Grimm. “He’s more for Staten Island than Donovan is,” says Frank. “He got things done, but then he got caught. ... there’s so many others who didn’t get caught” 		“We’re going to give him another chance,” said Pat. #NY11
Woman at a polling place said she’d originally planned to vote for Grimm bc she’s a big Trump supporter and didn’t love that Donovan had voted against Trump’s wishes on some things. 		Trump endorsing changed her mind. “If Trump says to do it, we’ve gotta do it,” she said. #NY11
Grimm says the fact that Donovan is endorsed by Trump, state GOP, NRCC, House leadership, US Chamber etc is “gonna make the victory so much sweeter.”		“We literally have everyone against us ... And all I have is the people,” he said. #NY11 https://t.co/lxrW5QfTBR
The Grimm campaign had stamps made for ppl to write him in on the Conservative Party line. 		Grimm said today if he got Conservative line but Donovan won GOP nod, “I would decline it. I would do the right thing bc I want a Republican to keep this seat.” #NY11 https://t.co/S55BJpqDzI

#AL02 note — some Rs I talked to saw Roby's issue as a numbers game. They were worried she'd go to a runoff, but only bc so many challengers would make it hard to get to 50%. 		But it's not clear she's even going to break 40%. That suggests there might be a bigger issue here.
NRCC statement on #AL02. Roby was one of the members in the NRCC's Patriot Primary program, designed to help members who's major challenge was the primary, not the general. https://t.co/ffxf1uAcjX
Also, as @HenryJGomez pointed out, it's not like Bobby Bright is one of those deep south former Dems who switched parties in the 90s, à la Richard Shelby. 		Bright is an Obama era Dem. He ran — and lost to Roby — as a Dem in 2010. https://t.co/dedFmLFfFt

Also, to be clear, Roby's the favorite in #AL02 — she should get the highest vote total today. The question is whether she can break 50% and avoid a runoff.
For the Mike Coffmans and Barbara Comstocks of the world, who rep swing districts, breaking with Trump is useful in the general. But Roby's major competition is the primary, so she needs Trump voters. #AL02
Roby's a test case for how longterm effects for Republicans who buck Trump. She's partnered with Ivanka on stuff, been at the White House a lot, voted for Trump's favored legislation. But will voters forgive her for not backing him in 2016? https://t.co/wvFPNPAZu9
Anyway, results are starting to come in for #AL02. Read all about it. https://t.co/FjSdP35XI0
Or you can watch Hobson in the music video he and his Christian rock band made (he was on his way to play guitar when I interviewed him in April) https://t.co/wdpZTBO2Wy
(Note the prominent Roy Moore cameo)
Hobson also hits Roby on not voting for Trump in a TV ad — and touts his record as a Roy Moore guy, an opponent of Planned Parenthood, and a supporter of Trump and gun rights #AL02  https://t.co/I2q4iCvky7
Another Roby opponent is Rich Hobson, who was Roy Moore's Senate campaign manager last year and is a longtime Moore guy. Some Rs think he could lay claim to a number of Moore voters. #AL02
Barry Moore did, however, loan himself $40k over the past few days, per FEC filings. #AL02
In fact, Barry Moore made entirely false claims about his fundraising. He told me on 4/23 that since the legislative session ended (3/29) he had raised "about $1000 a day" and was "probably at $130k."		Per FEC filings, he only raised $17,821 from 4/1 - 5/16. #AL02
Then there's state Rep. Barry Moore, who's banking on his rep as a very early Trump supporter in 2016. He was the first one into the race against Roby, but his fundraising is not reflective of that — it's been pretty bad. #AL02
Bright is personally wealthy, and he self-funded to the tune of $309k so far. He told me in April he'd "put more in if I have to." (He didn't, but he could in a runoff) #AL02 https://t.co/FjSdP35XI0
And Bright's slogan this time is "Make District 2 Bright Again." (There are hats. They look...exactly like what you'd expect). #AL02
Bright explains the Pelosi vote as "procedural." 		Also, that it was "before Nancy Pelosi became so toxic." #AL02 		https://t.co/FjSdP35XI0 https://t.co/gIN7x2KvZy
Of course, Bright's a former Democrat. And if he winds up in a runoff with Roby, she'll hit him on voting for Pelosi for Speaker and Obama for president.
Former Rep. Bobby Bright, Roby's most well-funded challenger, is running this TV ad - with a 2016 clip of Roby calling on Trump to "step aside"  https://t.co/OAqyosdWWY
Voters held the Trump comments against her: Roby got 49% of the vote in the general elex in 2016. Trump won her district with 65%. #AL02
There's a runoff unless someone gets &lt;50% of the vote. Roby has 4 well-known primary challengers — spurred in by her 2016 Trump comments — which makes 50% a steeper hurdle for her. For several months, Rs have worried she's headed for a runoff https://t.co/C3ijxtBGV3
Polls close in 3 minutes in Alabama. The race a lot of Republicans are watching: #AL02, where Martha Roby's 2016 rebuke of Trump might come back to haunt her https://t.co/C3ijxtBGV3

Moser puts down the mic, starts to leave, then says - “And everybody don’t give up. We’re gonna keep fighting. And we’re gonna change this city and change this state and change this country.” #TX07
“The key objective here is to beat John Culbertson ... if this night turns out like it looks like it’s going to turn out, I encourage everyone to support [Lizzie Fletcher],” Moser says, to applause #TX07
Moser now lacing into Culbertson - “he doesn’t care if our city goes underwater.” #TX07

Which is all just to say, I agree that historical context matters. But you have to look at all of it, not just the part that makes you look good.
Joni Ernst, in Q1 of 2014, was a barely known candidate in a multi-way GOP primary. 		Her 'Squeal' ad, which went viral and put her on the map, came out March 25, 2014, right before the quarter ended.
Cory Gardner in Q1 of 2014? He got into the race on Feb. 26, 2014. So he raised that $1.2m in the just over a month remaining before the quarter ended.
and in Q1 of 2016, Missouri Senate, where Kander was challenging Roy Blunt, wasn't even considered a race. Whereas Hawley v. McCaskill is one of the most competitive races on the board this year.
But a couple notes on that: for starters, none of those other candidates had a sitting president come and fundraise for them in the comparable quarter.
@N_S_Dolkart "recruits from previous cycles"
Hawley camp pushes back on my read of their fundraising quarter: https://t.co/p3P645GDrz
But even at $1.5m, same goes — This is a still not a great haul for a candidate billed as a top recruit, and for whom Trump held a fundraiser for him this quarter https://t.co/CpPMfPfpZa

More Lamb on Trump:  " I have been very focused on our voters here. They overwhelmingly want me to work with the president. Where it benefits us here in Wedtern PA I'll be more than happy to do that. And I haven't seen anything to say that we won't be able to do that." #PA18

Some Ds in #PA18 have crowed that Lamb has energized lots of western PA-ers, and they see signs even outside the district. 		But that too, is confusing, per my friends, bc if the guy down the block has a sign, he must be voting, right? So then maybe they *are* in the district.
Pittsburgh area friends say there's quite a bit of confusion leading up to tomorrow's #PA18 vote — namely, are they voting based on the new district lines or the old district lines?

To be clear, Webber was taking issue with the idea in Moser's article that ppl should just get over housing prices in DC, noting that gentrification has raised housing prices so much that some black residents of DC have had to move https://t.co/WzPYpX6Pt5
Jeri, who "joined the American Legion 'for the bingo' a few years back" is my favorite character in this. https://t.co/WDwqhE5980
Webber is also the co-founder of Houston Black Lives Matter and Houston Rising.
Webber said until she read the article, she thought Moser and Westin should be the candidates in the runoff (and she has some criticism for Fletcher and Triantaphyllis, too). But now, she said: "After reading that article, Laura Moser has no business representing CD-7." #TX07
Laura Moser is a sponsor of the March for Black Women. 		"If I had read that article this time last week, she would not be sponsoring," Webber tells me. "I am a little uncomfortable with it because I think that at this point, she needs to answer for what she does." #TX07
Some more conflict in #TX07 Dem primary:  Kandice Webber, organizer of tomorrow's March for Black Women in Houston, tells me she read Moser's 2014 Washingtonian article this AM (that DCCC put up as oppo): "It was completely tone deaf and it just, it reeked of white privilege."

Though at least the dog's probably happy either way, so that's good.

It just seems like it places potentially unachievable expectations on the dog as a clone that it's going to be like the last one. and what if it's not?
and I feel like this is something that Barbara Streisand has thought about since she noted in the interview that “They have different personalities"
Do you resent it for not being exactly like the original?
Can you love the clone(s) as much as the original? Do you see it as an individual entity or just a xerox of the old one?

Anyway, there are some anecdotes that the numbers can prove wrong or right in a bit. #ALSEN
@PatriciaRaye it's true, it's made me so lazy.
Tim Bullock came down from Massachusetts for a few days.“It could be a momentum changer … I think it can kind of slow this roll of this right wing takeover.” #ALSEN
In this final wknd, this election drew some out-of-staters who wanted to campaign for Jones. Liza Joffrion drove from Nashville. Before Nov. 2016, she said, "I paid attention. I wasn’t making road trips to swing districts." #ALSEN
(I'm aggressively abusing 280 and I'm only sort of sorry)
Laura Williams, in 1986, was press sec for then Dem Sen. Richard Shelby. She said she hasn't spoken to him in a year bc of Trump, but was grateful for his comments on Moore Sunday. "Richard Shelby is a decent human. He showed us his true self yesterday." #ALSEN
"The physician who lives next door to us says this to me every time I see him - 'go Doug.' He’s never voted for a Democrat. My bridge partner has never voted for a Democrat; she is this time," Williams said #ALSEN
"We have lots of neighbors and friends who told us they’re voting for Doug Jones. They’ve never voted for a Democrat. Never," said Laura Williams, a Jones backer from Homewood, AL #ALSEN
"I think [Jones] can do it," Christie Dowling said at his final rally. "And I’m scared of what it means if he doesn’t." #ALSEN
Dems are painting #ALSEN in dire terms. 		"I’ve been involved in campaigns before, and it was more like a football game—you were rooting. And this one just has a lot more to it," Christie Dowling told me at Jones' rally last night.
And, while you wait for numbers in #ALSEN, some anecdotes from a weekend spent largely at Jones campaign events —

Moore - "obviously I've made a few people mad"
Pastor Mike Allison, introducing Moore, calls him "a man of character, and a champion of right," says Moore is "facing attacks that would completely crush most men" #ALSEN

Now we're watching a biographical video about Roy Moore, narrated in an inspiring tone #ALSEN
"This is nothing new for us, church. We've been lied about," pastor says, touching on Moore allegations #ALSEN
Pastor on Moore: "Why did you have him come? I said, 'because he is what we stand for.'" #ALSEN
Moore is sitting front row center. Seven seats down is Breitbart's Matt Boyle. #ALSEN
Pastor earlier said he's grateful Moore is here despite "all the fire he faces. Lord, I thank you God for a man who will stand the test of time and do what's right." #ALSEN
@FoxReports I believe that's exactly what she did.
