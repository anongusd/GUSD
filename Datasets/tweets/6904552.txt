@ScoreSomeElli I would not want to excite your anticipation. It was just the usual thing.
@d_twit @epc303 @ureallykicking @RaduMarinescu6 @BubblesVampire Oh, heavens no -- that ridiculous @carolelee and that minx @carenbohan. They bring out the worst in me, every time.

@mrmattschnoor Find a show you like. Obama is relevant and I am not about leading the resistance.
@docmpc so early don't jinx me!!!
@Kitzman76 Not rude, just willfully misunderstanding.
@mrmattschnoor Ha -- how is giving you facts and perspective "equivocating"? I am not here to lead the resistance, and if you can't handle some context then what are you here fore?
@Kitzman76 Hi no one is absolving Trump.
@milineashade @EvanLovett @MaryWills612 @thehill You know what? I did miss that. I have been on radio eight years and covered the White House for 10 years  and spent 15 covering politics before that, and Dem outrage just totally passed me by.
thank you https://t.co/51cBw1hMkN
@NoblePies Of course not. Just not buying any attempt to depict Obama as transparent on this issue.
@mrmattschnoor I am not here to defend the rollback as good policy, just put it in some perspective because the Obama/ Always Good and Trump/Always Bad insistence is ridiculous.
@Kitzman76 It's not my "excuse." the point is there was little accountability for Obama, and now Dem outrage over Trump is very unpersuasive, to me.
@mmahaffie Not remotely. Just not here to ignore facts or history.
@Polarbear56 @HallieJackson @janschakowsky Exactly, thanks.
@EvanLovett @MaryWills612 @thehill He threatened them with prison, surveilled their private email, seized phone records and accused them of crimes.
@AdrienneFreyer The trails really are intense -- steep, high, terraced orchards. Very treacherous. You could *totally* see derps trying to traverse them in flip-flops, with disastrous results.
@MaryWills612 @EvanLovett @thehill Ha -- thanks for filling me in on this. I have a different view
@MaryWills612 @EvanLovett @thehill yeah, that's not really the point.
@nancykaymar I've been, it's lovely
@unroolie_julie @carolelee @pooliganspod omg she's everywhere! when does it stop?
@EvanLovett @MaryWills612 @thehill Trump is just following the Obama playbook. Not really a "win" for anyone.

@presspooler @POTUSPressPool How can I help?
@akbussey There is a difference between boycotting a show, and boycotting advertisers. You hate my show? Find another one to support. You want to flex on my advertisers? Look forward to content scrubbed and approved by advertisers. Huge difference.
@CarducciJoanne @AdamReizner Your hypotheticals are meaningless to me because I have already experienced what happens when a minority of idiots flexes on advertisers to alter content. Someday a group will come for a show you like and respect. Remember that you defended this process.
@akbussey Really? I worked at a place where customers boycotted advertisers. The result was pressure from management to tone down critical coverage of the war in Iraq. Do you think that was "capitalism at its finest"? This is exactly the same thing.
@CarducciJoanne @AdamReizner Maybe you haven't heard my show lately. The work we do is very dependent on advertisers. Your membership fees are important, but they are far from the whole shebang.
@RaduMarinescu6 my favorite writer
The voice I miss the most consistently is Michael Kinsley. I would love to watch him every night talking about all this, and read him every day.
@Chad10460814 @confusedraptor You have to get this: It does not matter whether *you* believe that he is a journalist or not. Your assessment of his credentials matters zip. You are endorsing a plan that will allow advertisers to dictate content, across the board. (btw, Maddow is not a journalist).

@DickTheCat2017 Is Lawrence O'Donnell a news show? What about Don Lemon? They could be next.
@gnftr78 I hear the same thing all the time about MSNBC and CNN. Try peeking outside your bubble -- the mob will come for programming you like because leftist propaganda network. Then what will you say? Unfair! First Amendment!
@Cwalk1349 The result will be the worst programming, all approved by advertisers. Nice trend.
@Flostation @JoshTager I worked at a place where customers boycotted our advertisers. The result was pressure from management to ease up on critical coverage of the war in Iraq. So no, I am not a fan of advertiser boycotts.
@Flostation @AdamReizner No -- most of those advertisers are also on MSNBC.
@wegreenlaw Also not journalists: Rachel Maddow, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Nicole Wallace, etc etc etc.
@randall_connell @raduray This isn't about me, any mob can come after any broadcaster and certainly will if these stupid advertiser boycotts persist. Then you'll have nothing but advertiser-approved content. Well done!
@maitre_jack phew -- I was concerned for your welfare.
@mfaria11 OK. Enjoy.
@MichaelNessen @JeffPeskoff Boycotting advertisers gives advertisers control of content. Do you want to tune in to a show knowing all the scripts, guests and topics have been scrubbed by advertisers? You obviously didn't bother to read the link.
@JoshTager I get it -- you're unhappy and you want immediate impact. A good remedy is changing the channel. There is no quick solution.
@MichaelNessen @JeffPeskoff Boycott the show, not the advertisers.
@MichaelNessen @JeffPeskoff @RaduMarinescu6 There is still a lot of merit-based success in the industry, not sure how advertisers "decide who succeeds." Customers have power in setting ratings. If you object to a show, don't watch or listen.
@MichaelNessen @erinnburke They advertise based on the audience, not the content of the show. Don't believe me? Check out all the identical ads on MSNBC and FOX News.
@MichaelNessen @JeffPeskoff Public funding of the news industry won't attract the best, most talented people to the biz, even if the public was inclined to fund it (which they aren't). Dumb non-idea.
@Cwalk1349 No, the public can still have a say by boycotting the show. By boycotting advertisers, you give advertisers the right to dictate content. Market forces are the audience, not the advertisers.
@erinnburke Yes! And in the future when you tune into the news, that "impact" will include knowing that advertisers influenced and signed off on all the stories you get.
@JeffPeskoff @RaduMarinescu6 boycott the show if you're unhappy, is the point.
@raduray @ureallykicking Please cite anywhere in my Twitter feed where I said that.
@JeffPeskoff @RaduMarinescu6 Good luck.
@maccapg No, they are just responded to a boycott. You give them too much credit to think they are interested in anything other than reaching his audience with their ads.
@scared60 You should find a show you like.
@confusedraptor Nope. We are both analysts with journalism backgrounds who are broadcasters with advertisers.
@DeanVFenenga So you think advertising on shows is a direct endorsement of content?
@petersrobertg Can you see me getting canned because I don't have any? I work for a corporation that depends in part on advertising. If you give them power to determine content, it won't be a matter of whether I bend or not. I will simply disappear.
@raduray So you're saying you are good with advertisers dictating the content of my show.
@maccapg That's really easy to spout. Doesn't mean much though.
@Cwalk1349 The consequences should be dictated by the audience, not the advertisers.
@JeffPeskoff @RaduMarinescu6 Then all you are doing is giving more power to advertisers. What will you do when the mob comes for the advertisers of a show you like?
@petersrobertg No.
@raduray @ureallykicking That is really missing the point. No one likes what he said. But pressure on advertisers will allow them to dictate the content of shows.
@AdamReizner Well if you make an exception for him, you are empowering all those who would make the same exception for me or anyone you like hearing from.
@confusedraptor Well then I am just a presenter, too. I will await the dictat from my advertisers on what I am allowed to say. (Did you know O'Reilly is an award-winning journalist, btw?)
@petersrobertg Yes, you're right -- capitalists should decide content. When they come for Maddow, I will think of your pleasure in this.
@mrnegroni Not remotely relevant.
@AohRuger I know that reading links is hard.
@ureallykicking Will you feel bad for me when I am only allowed to say things approved by advertisers?
@maitre_jack Wow -- right? You're seriously mixing that up on a Wednesday night in America? Dude.
@AdamReizner That doesn't make any difference. The point is advertisers should not be involved in content decisions. Should my advertisers decide what I get to say and talk about?
@confusedraptor Did you read the piece at all?

@Christi49738072 @whca I know the #resistance wants a big anti-Trump show but that's not our role. And the dinner was on CSPAN because as journalists we support presidential speeches being open.
@Christi49738072 @whca The "capitulation" theme really has no place in this. The dinner has been planned without consideration for the non-attending president, and focuses on the organization's key mission. that's not capitulation.
@BoGrym @whca It's neither appeasement nor protest but a partisan wouldn't get it.
@ballgamz @whca Your opinion on this is a reflection of your partisanship. The annual dinner is not a protest.
@ballgamz @whca It's been on CSpan because as journos we believe events where the president speaks should be open.

@mbp2112 @whca By "means" I meant a membership in the organization, in which case then yes, obviously your opinion would matter. Do you sound off on your local Elks Club dinner or Pharma Convention speakers, too? Do you think they should worry about your opinion of their speakers?

@ArtMurray1 WHAT
@alyounkins Thanks! I am sorry I am sure I said your name all wrong!
@Drew42X They could do anything. He also could get a primary challenger.
@alyounkins In the past when the president came, it made more sense.
@guruofchem @whca Who cares? People who knew nothing of a more than 100-year organization until last year really are non-concerns in this. If they think it's knuckling under, they should read something.
@AbuZeina Really unmoved by hot takes from non-members declaring this choice some kind of capitulation. We are not part of the #resistance and this is our annual dinner. Nothing more. Who cares if the general public has "interest"? they don't buy tickets.
@bossymaggoo It's going to be great -- more like a professional dinner than a glitzy dinner cruise.
@RaduMarinescu6 @whca The presence of celebrities helped sell tickets, which pay for journalism scholarships.
@lcarroll1954 @AdamReizner sorry about the link
@EddieJones063 @whca @POTUS The comedians were fun! But they are not necessary, and if the president isn't going to participate, it's good to take the dinner in a less glitzy, more professional direction.
@SethAtkinson4 @whca Surely you can see that you have no idea what you are talking about. There is no "catering to the WH," this is a choice that underscores the organization's mission. It makes perfect sense unless you are totally blinded by #resist or #MAGA
@kamalmohammed59 @whca At a troth. ?
Predictable and hilarious that so many with no stake in the @WHCA dinner and no means of attending nevertheless nurture very strong feelings about this year's excellent speaker and misguided notions of the organization's brief.

@UsuallyLeft @JeremyColer @Acosta @Yamiche @whca Sorry when you repeatedly tweet at me I assume you are looking for a response. I won't bother.
@JeremyColer @UsuallyLeft @Acosta @Yamiche @whca What you are asking journalists to do is basically drop all professional standards, step into a protest line and join the resistance. I am sure that would be gratifying to partisans. It would be disastrous to our industry. Please drop this.
@JeremyColer @UsuallyLeft @Acosta @Yamiche The story has been widely reported on.
@JeremyColer @UsuallyLeft @Acosta @Yamiche The @WHCA, which represents the White House press corps, is on this and handling it. Again, appreciate the public interest but unified protest is not the answer. We've all been at this a long time and actually know what we're doing, thanks.
@RobertZArts I am sure we appreciate your interest, but this is a really bad idea that is wrong in several ways, counterproductive, not in anyone's interest and is basically a protest. Like @PostBaron said, we are not at war, we are at work.

@johnm0100 @d_twit @pooliganspod Love that bar. Also the lounge at Tabard Inn is a great place in the afternoon. It's probably not cold enough for the fireplace, but it's a creaky, dark old living room full of couches and art.

@sarah_beretta @ruthielee21 @realDonaldTrump My caller was in no way racist or inflammatory, she was stating a pro-Trump viewpoint that you just don't agree with. I don't have to "normalize" her. She supports the president of the United States. She's already normal. You are the one posting racist pictures on Twitter.
@wby_69 Yes!! Some dog or coyote or something was charging at my friend's pug along a footpath in Austin, and Perry, who was out for a run, grabbed the dog and held it over his head.
