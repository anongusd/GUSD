To that end, IDC calls for a sustained American presence in Southern and Eastern Syria to combat ISIS and serve as a check on Iran, the Assad regime, and allied Shia militias while allowing Syrian refugees to return to their homes.
Allowing his bombing and gas attacks to continue will add to the refugee crisis and the economic and political owes it has created, particular for Lebanon.  Strong, swift and targeted action must be coupled with a long-term strategy in Syria.
IDC calls for a strong international response led by the U.S. to punish the Assad regime for its use of chemical weapons, the targeting of de-escalation zones &amp; carpet bombing civilians. Assad’s actions have caused a refugee crisis to overwhelm neighboring Lebanon and Jordan.
In neighboring Lebanon, Maronite Patriarch Beshara Rai iterated that “We appeal to the consciences of the great powers and the international community to work to end the war and to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting peace through political and diplomatic means.”
“Attacking innocent civilians in Syria w/chemical weapons is a gross violation of humanity &amp; utterly immoral,” stated IDC’s Executive Director @ptnassif on April 12th. “All parties who were involved must be held accountable &amp; the world must ensure these attacks do not continue.”
On Saturday, April 6th, Syrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics reported that more than 40 people were killed in a chemical attack on Douma, a rebel-stronghold in the Eastern Ghouta region of Damascus.
IDC the nation’s leading advocacy organization for Christians and religious minorities in the Middle East, condemns the use of chemical weapons against civilians by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. 	https://t.co/QwJE3Y8YjM

IDC calls for a expedited reconsideration of these cases and urges the administration to work towards a process which allows for religious minorities and others facing persecution, such as Christian and #Yezidi genocide victims, to seek shelter in the United States.
In the letter, they iterate that: “The law is clear: these applicants should be presumed eligible for refugee status. DHS and the State Department should admit them as soon as possible, and if any applicants are denied, the agencies should explain the reasons for the denial.”
In a letter directed to the Vice President of the United States, Congressmen Randy Hultgren (R-IL) and James P. McGovern (D-MA), Co-Chairs of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, urge his assistance in resolving the cases of roughly 100 Iranian refugees.
...The United States was founded to be a safe haven for those fleeing religious persecution, and helping religious minorities, in this particular case heavily persecuted by the Iranian regime, is in our national DNA.”
On Friday, February 23rd, IDC’s Executive Director @ptnassif said that: “These persecuted minorities, who include elderly and disabled people, are not a threat to American national security and there is no excuse for why they should not be allowed to seek refuge in this country.
Now, these mostly Christian refugees face deportation back to Iran, where they will surely suffer severe harassment, punishment, and imprisonment by the Islamic Republic for attempting to seek asylum in the United States.
The refugees have been stranded in Austria for over a year while they awaited for approval to be resettled in the United States.

U.S. support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, which include the YPG in their ranks, stems from the need to combat ISIS and close porous borders that jihadists have been able to capitalize on to terrorize Syrians.
The #Afrin canton has served as a safe zone for refugees of the war, and currently around 15,000 #Yazidis and 250 #Christian families live there in relatively safety from the Assad regime, ISIS and other extremist organizations.
He added, “it is worrying to see people who fled the Syrian regime and ISIS now fleeing @NATO member Turkey’s offensive. Moreover, these refugees are being denied entry into Syrian government controlled areas, making the Assad regime complicit in putting their lives in danger.”
On Tuesday, IDC Executive Director @ptnassif stated that “Americans of goodwill should be concerned about ongoing Turkish operations in Afrin since it destabilizes a relatively stable area of Syria”
In particular, #Christians and #Yazidis are expressing concerns over the participation of Turkish-backed Syrian Islamic militants who have been threatening religious minorities and targeting civilian areas.
As the Turkish air and ground offensive against the U.S.-backed Kurdish YPG in the Syrian Kurdish canton of #Afrin enters its fourth day, IDC expresses serious concern over the invasion.
