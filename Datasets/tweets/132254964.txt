Kavanaugh during @SenatorLeahy questioning about whether he will be called to testify: Mark Judge developed very serious alcohol addiction, almost died and also had leukemia.

Kavanaugh: My family's been destroyed by this, Senator, destroyed..."I'm all in immediately" if committee decides to move forward w/ FBI investigation.
Rachel Mitchell, special prosecutor brought in who specializes in sex crime cases, also appears to be handling questioning of Judge #Kavanaugh
Kavanaugh: my family and I have no ill will toward Dr. Ford
#Kavanaugh says when he was younger he was focused on his goals &amp; family but at times drank w/ friends but firmly states “I never committed sexual assault”
.@ChuckGrassley thanks Ford for testifying &amp; for her “bravery”
Ford: lawyers advised her to take polygraph, says it was extremely stressful process &amp; felt she had to share her whole life during the test
Ford says she was able to "get up the gumption" to take flights for this testimony, lawyers earlier said she considered driving to East Coast due to fear of flying.
Ford asked whether other incidents/factors "contributed" to her anxiety &amp; PTSD as she earlier stated. Ford says that the alleged Kavanaugh incident was most "striking" trauma that happened to her.
.@ChuckGrassley speaks out on Democratic Senators handling of the situation, there were 45 days this committee could've been investigating this situation &amp; her privacy would've been protected
Ford says she's run into Judge one time since the alleged attack - adds she ran into him at Safeway and he appeared "nervous" and as though he was avoiding her

Grassley says each member gets 5 minutes for questioning, he gives his time over to Rachel Mitchell - prosecutor who specializes in sex crime cases from AZ
Ford: It is not my responsibility to determine whether Kavanaugh deserves to be on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell you the truth. #SCOTUS
Ford: I have been accused of acting out of partisan interests..."those who say that do not know me. I'm an independent person and I am no one's pawn."
Ford: My family and I have been forced to move out of our homes. With the help of security guards, we have gone from one secure location to the next. "I've had to relive this trauma in front of the world"
Ford: "I've been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable." - says personal threats and attacks on her have been dreadful
Ford: "I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country" - says thousands have sent messages who have survived a sexual assault thanking her for speaking out.
Ford says she's terrified, facing threats on her &amp; her family and "agonized daily" w/ whether to come forward with information. Ford says she reached out "out of a sense of duty"
Ford: on July 6th, I had a sense of urgency to relay this information to the President &amp; lawmakers but I didn't know how to go about this
Ford says she confided in some close friends over the years about the assault, and it came up in individual therapy sessions, along with one martial counseling session. She says she never identified Kavanaugh by name in most of these interactions.
Ford: this was first told in detail during a home remodeling project with her husband. She wanted a second front door for security &amp; others disagreed - eventually says she thought 'the boy who assaulted me' could one day be on the Supreme Court.
Ford: over the years I told very very few friends that I had this traumatic experience, says she told her husband before they wed that she experienced a sexual assault.
Ford: this attack "drastically altered my life...too ashamed to tell anyone these details"for many years.
Ford says she was able to break away from Kavanaugh &amp; Judge bc they were drunk &amp; Judge jumped on top of the two during assault.
Ford: It was hard for me to breath and I felt that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. "They seemed to be having a very good time" during the "attack"
Ford says Kavanaugh groped her &amp; tried taking off her clothes - "I believed her was going to rape me"
Ford says she drank one beer and Kavanaugh &amp; Judge were "very drunk"
Ford says Kavanaugh, Judge, PJ &amp; one other boy she cannot remember were at the party in question, along w/ her friend Leland. "I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I'd like to", adds some things have "haunted" her &amp; she will never forget.
