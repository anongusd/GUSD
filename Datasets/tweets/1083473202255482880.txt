@MirrorMovies @DailyMirror Really??? Why ??? No popcorn ??
@ABC This coming from  The Worst  Governor in NJ HISTORY . Why is NJ paying $64,000 a month too cover up emails from Bridgegate?? Christie is 100% Guilty Christie loves too coverup evidence . Governor Murphy is just as bad !! Even worse !!! Murphy tried too coverup rape of K Brennan
@GMB @piersmorgan @susannareid100 @RichardAArnold @CharlotteHawkns Hope your ok
@PatriciaHeaton @Lindamedvene @glennnutley @MartinKatzLtd I was thinking about a reboot of Everybody Loves Raymond . So many other shows have been rebooted
@mchooyah I like this idea very very much
@ProudResister I remember many comments speeches from both sides on Trump and how the flip flopping occurred . Trump without a doubt is the worst President in US History.  Trump has gone out of way too destroy American values .
@TheDeniseCrosby Never ever going too happen . I know sooo many and the way India treats their women  is Disgusting . Middle Eastern women are treated just as Horrific
@prattprattpratt Awesome Congratulations Chris
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Since Trump has had unprotected sex . Do you think he has other children he does not know he has ?? Fox turned on him this weekend  so Trumps  time is up . He has no media ally left .
@RobertPicardo I met Deforest  in 1986 .
@mchooyah Very  sad.  But the guy video taping ?? I hope things get better for this kid .
@Joancollinsdbe Dynasty is on CW Seed app watching the episode about Congressmsn MacVane . I jumped and went to Season 9 and watching Alexis and Sable going at it . Fun to watch when I was driving
@RealJamesWoods LMAO
@RepMaxineWaters Agree time too Impeach . I‚Äôm a Republican and I‚Äôm physical sick  at what  Trump has done too America and our people . McConnell is no better . #ImpeachTrump
@RealJamesWoods Love these videos and totally amazed and always respect these surfers .
@BernardKerik @BillSpadea Totally Agree 100% . Governor Murphy is also involved in a scandal that did not become national news yet but very soon it will . Gov Murphy is a corrupt lying fraud . Murphy is only concerned about  marijuana and illegals . Screw the average NJ Residents. #ImpeachMurphy
@mchooyah The jumping on the bed with the same clothes on. OMG!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI definitely love this video . I can not understand why this woman did not adopt the boy . Reagan and the kid are bonded for life . Dogs and kids . I actually prefer dogs too humans . Maverick and I watching 60 Minutes https://t.co/uv4YuOrlbJ
@MeghanMcCain I read the article never heard of her before . I can not believe the wonderful people of  Hawaii elected  her . She basically is turning her back on the Hawaiian people they are very nonjudgmental and very open too new ideas and philosophy. Too me she seems not too fit the vibe
@SamuelLJackson 100% Correct. All Trump does is lie
@SenatorMenendez @ricardorossello @Carmelorios I saw you were enjoying the sun on your vacation !!!! Must be nice too be on vacation during a Crisis with the Fed Gov shutdown. Nancy stayed in DC . Very very inappropriate at this time . Plus when the 3,000 Americans were dying in Puerto Rico why did you do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr I‚Äôm still trying too figure out your job is Donny ?? Are you just supporting your father or do you have an actual position in his admin like Ivanka ???
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Like a Russian Howdy Doody
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Like Cylons ?
@patrickhealynyt @morgfair Agree
@TylerFlorence 4
@morgfair Very  true I agree
@GovMurphy It‚Äôs actually worse !!!! You lied and are covering up the crime committed to Kate Brennan . Your are covering up the Horrific Crimes Of MCPO Andrew Carey the reason of he holds your fate . THATS WHY YOU &amp; GURBIR ARE OVERLOOKING HIS CRIMES HE DID TOO ME. YOUR DEFENDING A CRIMINAL
@KathieLGifford ü•∂‚òÉÔ∏èüçæüõ∏üõ∏üõ∏üõ∏üõ∏üõ∏
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Love your Fox interview . Fox has turned on you know so is Fox Fake News too . Donald. OPEN UP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
@GovMurphy Watching  JERSEY  MATTERS on Me TV . What A F**K**G JOKE MCPO is in charge of The Kate Brennan Sexual Assault !!!! You  Phil you KNEW &amp; DID NOTHING !!! WHY is GURBIR NOT DOING ANYTHING!!! I was illegally drugged by MCPO Detective I reported and GURBIR DID NOTHING !!! WTF PHIL !!!
@morgfair Agree I‚Äôm very impressed with your tweets . They are very accurate and  insightful
@chucktodd @SenTedCruz @timkaine @MeetThePress Fox has now turned on Trump . Without Fox there is no Real News for Trump . With the Gov Shutdown , The Russian Connection with new evidence this weekend &amp; Fox turning on Trump  . Trump Admin in Crisis . Trumps Downfall is IMMINENT
@EdKrassen Trump walking around with his shirt off would be a leading cause of blindness .
@RudyGiuliani Rudy you need damage control after a Trumps Disaster interview on Judge Jeanines Show . Trump needs too do interviews  on networks besides Fox . It looks really bad . Trump has already been found guilty of treason on Twitter . Much backlash over Fed Gov shutdown .
@NateDiaz209 @TeamKhabib Khabib owns your A**. Nate you were defeated by a stronger opponent . There is no shame in that
@TeamKhabib You are the Champ  . This can not be denied
@jamieoliver Perfection üëçüëç
@piersmorgan @MailOnline Interesting fact .
@jamieoliver Cauliflower  anyway  of serving it is  wonderful  . To raw in a salad  too California mashed potatoes . Cali mAshed is cauliflower mashed . Really good too .
@ChrisEvans Chris your 100% Correct he has something on Graham . He hAs turned 180 like you said . It‚Äôs like Trump has the smoking gun on McConnell and now Graham and they act like they fear for their lives if they stand up too him . #VeryStrange
@morgfair Something be is was tired of being treated like dirt by Jeff Bezos . Darth Bezos is a evil greedy lying scumbag . I know him . I‚Äôm glad she will be the richest woman on the planet .
@BetoORourke Looks peaceful
Very very true https://t.co/xZOKFbdzlm
@AMAZlNGNATURE I‚Äôm in love with this video ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
@GovMurphy Just saw on CHANNEL 12 news a bill will be passed too protect dogs and prosecute the people who abused them . Excellent then it will be very easy too prosecute your employee MCPO Andrew Carey for him and his Detective abusing my dog . Toms River Police acknowledged the truth
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Why is it always Fox News . ABC is very well respected and honest . I personally know many people at ABCNews . Doing interviews only on Fox is one sided . This needs to change
@moonlight26a I think McConnell is getting either money or some special benefit for the unconscionable support he gets from Trump . What US Senator would not fight too keep government open
@Comey I bet it was good . I passed the theatre the other day . I always eat at Jones . They have awesome Thai Chicken wings . The food is really good . The mAshed potatoes . OMG!! Sooooo Delicious
@ProudResister @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump @HouseDemocrats Yes Ryan the closed door two hour meeting with Putin that the press was not allowed to cover?? Something very secretive was going on ??? I never trusted Trump with that . Plus even before he was elected his undying devotion too Russia ??? Plus Putin was playing Trump like a putz
@krassenstein They would have exploded !!! Maybe , I was actually thinking McConnell tremendous unwavering support for Trump ?? MAybe McConnell is getting a kickback or snow me benefit from Trump ??? I can not believe a US Senator would not do his best too open the government. #Treason
@levarburton Looks good
@7NewsSydney @realDonaldTrump Trump is  doing  too distract from The Russian Connection . Since more evidence was brought too light that proves Trump conspired with Michael Cohen  and his visit too Prague and  Manoforts connection too Russian spies and the money trail
@ananavarro Why can‚Äôt the Senate  &amp; Congress just overrule General Fake Bone Spurs ?? Can‚Äôt the Supreme Court do something ??
@tyrabanks I‚Äôm drinking Tim Hortons coffee right this second
@GovMurphy Oh God Snow which means you will have another excuse why you are not prepared to Lead New Jersey thru the storm . Your success rate for bad weather SUCKS !!!
@AronEisenberg Aron your right tick tock . Donald Trump basically ended the party of Abraham Lincoln . Everyday the country reaches a new low just like his casinos and every other one of his businesses
@EdKrassen Kelly &amp; George‚Äôs marriage must be special since both are standing up for their beliefs but both are st polar opposite
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Sooner the better
@realDonaldTrump Forget the wall open the Government!!!
@realDonaldTrump Donald you LIE all the time too
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump With an X Brian
@EdKrassen @NRA I did not know it was illegal but this article is true and pretty much common knowledge . The NRA owns Trumps A**.
@smh Skipping breakfast is SO wrong!!! Breakfast starts your metabolism for the day . Which aids in weight loss
@piersmorgan Piers did you not read the latest world headlines that Pork is the world most nutritious food ? Bacon bacon bacon !!!
@MJMcKean I m surprised I did not know he was still alive . I watched . I still can not figure out if is Guilty or not .
@BetteMidler LMAO . Totally Agree . But Trump needed help to figure out .
@jamieoliver Love Love Love frittatas . I love at the end you cut it like a pizza , so do it . It‚Äôs freezing and this is an excellent and fun food  too eat for breakfast lunch or dinner . Breakfast food in NJ is eaten  a lot for dinner during the winter months  making NJ Diners a staple
@omzmusic Agree
@ProudResister @Twitter Is this tweet Real ??? OMG !! If it is this is really scary
@ProudResister All I can say Da
@ProudResister I think because the Russian money that saved his multiple bankruptcies is the reason . Russians owned him .  NobEuropean or American bank would loan him money . Bad risk
@krassenstein @NRA Totally 100% Agree
@EdKrassen They already have
@chrishemsworth @zocothebodypro Good wotkoutüëçüëç

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Yes universal health insurance for everyone I totally  Agree
@jaketapper @MalcolmNance Nope Nixon does not deserve a ship named after him
@DemWrite @funder I seen stories of people not able to pay their mortgages
@krassenstein Soo agree . I have too been harassed into not tweeting about corruption and ethic abuses by law enforcement and State Officials in NJ .
@VancityReynolds @blakelively @johnkrasinski @MaryPoppins Mary Poppinx could kick DeadPool‚Äôs A**. Plus she is a much better singer .
@MrTommyCampbell They do . I want too be on that show . I love those types of competition
@albinokid @bwaycon Sounds very cool and fun
@EdKrassen @BetoORourke Looks peaceful too me
@ProudResister @GOP @realDonaldTrump Trump preys on the uneducated and less informed .
@EdKrassen @KamalaHarris I really think she might win or will be a top contender
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Exactly I have ever once been threatened by an immigrant .
@krassenstein Agree
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I got into tweet battle with Ann total not nice person and very ignorant . Rush  OMG!!!! Is he still alive ??? Dinosaur of ancient times . Fox is so one sided that it is basically a pulpit for Nazi Germany. Trump Destroyed the Republican Party . Time too evolve and change
@Acosta Of course I guess Trump never heard of Colonel Klink and HogsndvZHeroes #ISee Nothing
@nj1015 @BillSpadea @9thDistrictNJ I signed very happily
