@MattRooneyNJ @nytimes This is why there are 2 chambers of Congress. One where size and population play a role in a state‚Äôs ability to leverage their votes, and another where everyone has an equal vote.

@j_salvo @jonfavs Again, Democrats are really the only ones who care about keeping DREAMers here. If you really care about them then you‚Äôd spend your time and resources to mount pressure on Senate Republicans. Instead you make the Democratic Party weaker, which will hurt the DREAMers.
@j_salvo @jonfavs They‚Äôre the only ones who actually give a shit. Liberals and Moderates. Put pressure on the Senate Republicans because they‚Äôre the ones that don‚Äôt even want to even debate granting citizenship to DREAMers
@j_salvo @jonfavs I understand your frustration, and I‚Äôm angry too. But the reason these kids are in danger is because they play a large role in a conversation Senate Republicans really don‚Äôt want to have. However you feel, don‚Äôt waste energy attacking @TheDemocrats.
@j_salvo @jonfavs Trump, the leader of the Republican Party, rescinded DACA and the Tom Cottons of the Senate seem to have his ear. If it was up to them, the DACA KIDSw would be deported and that would be the end of it
@j_salvo @jonfavs This bleeds into a much larger issue about immigration that the Republicans have largely ignored, mostly because they don‚Äôt want to set a precedent by guarnateeing citizenship to a bunch of kids they very much consider ‚Äúillegal‚Äù.
@j_salvo @jonfavs If he does not come through on his commitment, there will be another shutdown, and Republicans won‚Äôt have any valid excuses or diversion tactics this time around. You also have to understand that Democratic votes alone will not save the DACA kids.
@j_salvo @jonfavs But now all of that will be addressed, and we came out of this shutdown with a commitment from  @SenateMajLdr that talks on immigration and DACA can actually begin in earnest by February 8th
@j_salvo @jonfavs The whole point of this shutdown was so the Republicans could get all the talking points out of their system (CHIP, Military funding, etc.)
@j_salvo @jonfavs This short term thinking is why the Liberal wing of the Democratic Party is doing us no favors when the pressure gets turned on.
