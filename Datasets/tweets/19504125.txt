@JCP_L Why did PSE&amp;G restore power in Maplewood and South Orange more quickly with similar damage?
@JCP_L Bailey Rd in Millburn lost power March 2, no trees are down, someone turned a switch off in the grid- got power back for 8 hrs - then off since Weds and restore the 15th?  The next street never lost power in Maplewood serviced by PSE@G.  Why the difference?
@LeonardLanceNJ7 @firstenergycorp Thank you Congressman! When one compares disparate performance on adjoining blocks, it's pretty clear that JCP&amp;L is severely deficient.  @firstenergycorp is based in Akron OH, and they are not responding to NJ citizens like Newark's @PSEGNews

So JCPL said via text power was estimated to be restored at approx 4 am.	JCP&amp;L:	We expect to restore power to the majority of affected customers by  03/14/2018 11:30 PM 	Cause: Inclement Weather 	Status: Additional Crews Requested		That‚Äôs a difference of 5 and 1/2 days
@JCP_L I want PSE&amp;G not this terrible utility. What do we have to do to get competent service?

Jersey Central Power and Light. Only a few hours of power in Bailey Rd in Millburn since Friday 2nd, now text to restore by the 14th? Next street over in Maplewood never lost power! Disgraceful!
@MillburnTwp Hello can we get rid of JCP&amp;L and PSE&amp;G instead. Power out since Friday, no trucks anywhere. Maplewood, West Orange South Orange Montclair have similar probs with downed trees but most have power. Bailey Road has been a dark Street since last Friday
Jersey Central Power and Light is the worst! Millburn in the dark while PSE &amp;G gets Maplewood on line immediately
