@WillmontSarah @marklutchman People don’t know what to say so they just would rather disappear I guess. I’d think a good friend wouldn’t do that but people are odd.  Then others just stop calling when you can never go out not understanding how hard it is to go out. Hey on wards and upward.

@RealDrGina Ha first thing I said was I want to slap that look off his face. He is very transparent to those who see.
@RealDrGina @JacksonLeeTX18 @TGowdySC The whole thing is BS. Did anyone think he would be truthful? They have been preparing for this for months. Totally bogus.
@LauraLoomer What he wants us to believe is his texts meant nothing. My conclusion is, if we are 2 believe him, he was a keyboard cowboy just trying to get laid. #fbipillowtalk Ooooo baby tell me more about how Trump supporters smell. Oooo tell me more about stopping him. Now that’s hot talk
@TonAlba2 @WholeFoods I go anyway so I gave nothing but time. 😉😊
it. YES, YES YES!!! Tell me more about how Trump supporters smell!! OOO ooo ooo what you do to me baby with that kind of talk.
Strzok meant nothing he said in his texts. So in other words, he was a keyboard cowboy and he was just trying to get laid. So what we thought was a lack of pillow talk was in reality pillow talk for these two. Must be an FBI thing. Oooo baby tell me again how you're going to stop
@marklutchman I lost many friends when my son was diagnosed with autism so I know how you feel. I was attacked after President Trump as elected by some liberal friends, oh well BUBYE!  Stay strong it says more about them and their intolerance.

@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump I thought the same. I am an autism mom so I have like 2 friends. Gonna be a very small funeral LOL And in the end, who cares? As far as McCain, I feel sorry for him. Even at deaths door he is hateful and mean. What a sad man he seems to be. Not a way to live and not a way to die.
@RyanAFournier You got that right! He has my vote and my prayers! @realDonaldTrump we love and support https://t.co/2fp3vBlVme ARE our President! We are proud!

@MarkDice Yes!! Clearly he is drooling at the chance.
@shoshannaclaire @ScottBaio Not true. He has audio from Nicole herself. Maybe give a listen before you talk.
@shoshannaclaire @ScottBaio I watched his video. He has written timeline proof. Maybe you should watch before you try to scold me. It’s clear you talk without knowing facts.
@ScottBaio You go Scott. Liars need to be called out and stopped.

Thanks for the follow!
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork I enjoyed our debate. You have a great night.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork See we can agree on something.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork Yes the US is the bad guy. Always. I agree we should let you all sink or swim and stop sending aid to those who don’t appreciate or use it to help their own. The picture is always bigger than what those in control want us to see. And that goes for all countries. Sadly.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork Nice try. I give you A for effort. 1 tweet is not continuously going after some1. I excercize my right when I see fit &amp; I pick and choose carefully. Maybe you should deal with what goes on in your country instead of commenting on something you have no skin in the game 4.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork Please say more. The more U post the more ridiculous U sound.  There is other social media besides twitter &amp; you have no idea what I’ve written or to whom or where. More assumptions on your part. You enjoy your day too. Thanks 4 the laugh. Better than Conan has been 4 years.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork Haha. That comment was perfect.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork He is a public figure and I have every right to tell him and his network what I think. Do you have an original thought or are you going to keep regurgitating my words? Maybe they should hire you after all.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork And this is a tweet about his sensationalized visit to an impoverished country. Not about Trumps unproven comments that a known liar that leaked bs he “heard” in a private meeting. Do they pay you to troll? If so TBS might want to spend more on their trolls.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork Actually I’m not following him so there again is another wrong assumption on your part that was something you actually could have seen if you bothered to look. And you clearly are obsessed with commenting on my tweet that had nothing to do with you. There’s a name for that....
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork You assume alot. Conan hasn’t been funny 4 years/my opinion. I never said I wasn’t a Trump supporter. Just that this tweet had nothing to do with him. U didn’t interest me enough 4 me to go to your feed. I see here u live in your own assumptions,it works 4 U. Enjoy.
@chuckwoolery We don’t answer the phone if we don’t know the number. The one time I did they hung up on me when I didn’t answer the way they wanted. All baited questions.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork This has nothing to do with Trump. You’re the one who brought him up. Obsessed much? It does however have everything to do with the oppression in the Haitian government and a “comedian” going there thinking people will speak out against it in the beautiful backdrop of Haiti.
@teresanavarro76 @PressSec @POTUS Clearly you don’t have mirrors in your home. Sarah is not only beautiful but brilliant. I suggest you yourself slim down before you fat shame someone.
@gopal_ndvss @ConanOBrien @TBSNetwork I guess reading hate in that tweet is what a hateful ignorant person does when there was no hate in that tweet.

@Rosie @jnam @kol__10 @MattsIdeaShop @benshapiro @Twitter When she first started she had some good rolls.

@terescavs @jrt67 @MrsScottBaio @JimfromPA @LizClaman Well that goes without saying. Lol
@terescavs @jrt67 @MrsScottBaio @JimfromPA @LizClaman Ha I’ve heard the LizClaman thing before. Someone stopped me in the grocery store once. And thank you both my boys are my heart.
@MrsScottBaio @JimfromPA There are plenty of pics of creepy uncle Joe touching women and children and what really telling is the look of all the woman AND the young girls. They are clearly uncomfortable in every photo.
@ElderLansing Seems everyone is jumping ship. Presumed guilty until proven innocent. This is not my America. And if those who jumped ship did so cause they knew something then they are just as guilty. If he is innocent I hope those liars pay dearly and the GOP learns the lesson.
@usererror00 @MrsScottBaio @Pats4Freedom @ScottBaio User there is something seriously wrong with you. Now sit down and shut up the adults are having a conversation.
No offense @seanhannity cause I love and support you but having Geraldo on talking about creepy men just didn’t seems right to me. You know cause he likes to pose in his undies and drunk text. Just sayin’
@MrsScottBaio Those that accuse and are lying take away from every true victim. That’s where the outrage should be.

@RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr @washingtonpost @nytimes Thank God for JW and all conservatives that speak out for the American people.  Many prefer to listen to what they agree with. I’d rather the cold hard truth. So thanks.
@ArcuriPolasek @AmericanTrue7 @NotElizabethNJ Pretty sexist statement for an open minded liberal. They probably identify as men while making coffee. 😉

@MrsScottBaio @SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain @SenBobCorker I also want my money back that they are spending on that stupid Trump investigation. Investigate Killery there’s the real Russian collusion. The GOP sucks.
@GiannoCaldwell Babs should just stop talking.

@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange If you and your friends want to make a difference don't show where there are kkk creeps. Get a permit and rally a different day. Be heard.
@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange And I'm not talking organized groups but real people.
@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange What's sad here is there were people there who really wanted to make a difference and every time they are met with violence on both sides.
@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange And they did it illegally. If they wanted to take stand they should have had a permit. POSSIBLY it could have been peaceful if they did.
@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange Not sure where you get your info. Kkk had permits. Right/ wrong they protested legally. Antifa come from all over  and when they do, trouble
@drewshi2000 @JuliannAssange No1 should have bad weapons. If all had proper permits maybe they could have been separated&amp;if the police weren't told to step down...
@Canadian_Cam @JuliannAssange Without the proper permits. If it was meant to be peaceful they would have done it legally. But they never do. They just show up, armed.
@9ontheturn @JuliannAssange Actually it is how that works.
@rustywonder @9ontheturn @JuliannAssange Pretty sure we agree on that
@RepDWStweets I believe there's room for you too. https://t.co/on300QzPrq
@davitydave Keep drinking. Hopefully you'll pass out and stop tweeting nonsense.
@JuliannAssange 1 group had a permit. The others didn't &amp; came looking 4 trouble. If Antifa and BLM can protest so can the KKK like it or not agree or not
@JuliannAssange 8 years of Obama race baiting we are as far apart as I've ever seen. Did we not see this coming? Sooner or later the kkk was going to show.
@JuliannAssange All of them including politicians who told police to stand down.
@davidmweissman @ananavarro I say again WHO?
@w_terrence @AshleyJudd In thinking about this, I think she must have done questionable things to boost her career and now she's vagina hat wearing angry.  Girl bye
@w_terrence @AshleyJudd She must be off her meds. Looking for something to be offended about is becoming its own mental illness. Angry, man hating woman, how sad.

Why Was The Electoral College Created? – for you Keith Jarrett, and all your moronic fans who also have no clue SUAP https://t.co/P3uEx5KP3t
@RealDJTrumpTeam @SpeakerRyan @POTUS @seanhannity cause they haven't really worked in years if ever. A life time in government🤔term limits!!
Can't b a muslim ban when all 7 countries have other religions &amp; can't b a ban with a time limit Can't believe this is still the narrative.
@RealJamesWoods WOW just WOW
@A_M_Perez @borismayfield When one is given the facts they must then go do their own research. The mind is a terrible thing to waste.
@A_M_Perez @borismayfield Just a question. Are you saying those 7 countries are of only one religion?
Keith Jarrett a loud mouth no nothing of why we have electoral college. Why founding fathers wrote our constitution the way they did. #moron
@minnman47 @tomesimpson went to a Keith Jarrett concert last night. Paid A lot of money just to hear him bad mouth POTUS. Ignorance!
@davidmweissman I had fun on his tweets.
@ThomasH15744537 @davidmweissman @MMFlint well when you put it that way... LOL
Obama is behind this, no doubt! But he is not alone and his name will never be connected. Others will take the fall.
@davidmweissman @MMFlint Not worth my time David. He is all about the money and this is the only way he can get laid, ugly on the inside.
@chucktodd Report the news instead of giving personal opinion. You delegitimized yourselves. AND FYI, we don't need POTUS to tell us UR FAKE
@chucktodd Sit down, shut up and watch how it's done.
@chucktodd Do your job then. I don't care about your opinion, just give me the facts. I am able to figure it out without U "helping". Liars!

@sardverb don't need  to be told to buy.  But because of the attack on Ivanka from the corporations you protect hard to find her clothing.
@sardverb we don't need our President to tweet for us to react. We reacted before he said anything. If it was you child you'd do the same
@CGasparino @sardverb @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness we didn't need POTUS to tweet for us to boycott. Ivanka is being bullied period.
