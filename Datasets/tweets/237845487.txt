People know about speaking truth to power. But the path to truth also requires taking back our power. The Cohen testimony would never have happened without the Blue Wave. And the conviction and imprisonment of Donald Trump and his cronies will require a bigger one in 2020.
Israel's sitting Prime Minister is being indicted on bribery charges. America, take note. No one is above the law, and your office shouldn't shield you from prosecution where there is evidence of criminal activity, especially ones in goddamned plain sight.
Why on earth would Trump take Kim Jung Un at his word on the murder of Otto Wambier, or on anything for that matter? Oh yeah, because Trump is a bumbling, unredeemable idiot.

It is Executive Order 9066 that made me a social and political activist dedicated to preventing such miscarriages of justice ever again. Roosevelt was a great President. But he was also a fallible human. A great President can also make great mistakes.
I remember the barbed-wire fence that confined me for four years from ages 5 to 8. I have memories of sentry towers with machine guns pointed at me. I remember the searchlights that followed me when I made the night runs from my barrack to the latrine.
Today is the day we call #DayofRemembrance, to commemorate the day 77 years ago that defined my life. On that day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which imprisoned my family and me simply because we looked like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor.

This is my personal journey, from silence to spokesperson, from fear to "fabulosity." I stayed silent for so long, but in honor of those intrepid folks who first stood up for our rights, I will never again be silent or silenced. /9
In 2019, I am honored to be one of the #StonewallAmbassadors, bringing the spirit of Stonewall to people across the world, where our work remains so very unfinished. Being an out and proud member of the LGBT community has been a blessing beyond measure. /8
In 2005, then-governor of CA, Arnold Schwarzenegger, vetoed a law that would have legalized same-sex marriage. Again, young people took to the streets. Seeing them filled me with pride and resolve. This time, with Brad, I made a choice. I came out. I was no longer silent. /7
In the 1980s, AIDS struck our community. Gay men were dying by the thousands. Society reacted not with compassion but revulsion and fear. Many people marched for their lives. I gave funds, went to fundraisers as a "closeted supporter." I was not out. So I remained silent. /6
In 1969, a miracle happened. Gay people grew tired of the harassment, and a brave group at the @StonewallInnNYC, led by drag queens and trans people, fought back. Three days of riots ensued in NYC, and a movement began. But I was unready to join them. So I remained silent. /5
When I would go to gay bars to meet other men, there was always the risk that the cops would come and arrest us for being "deviants" and "perverts." People who were caught lost their jobs and their families. I was afraid and kept a low profile. So I remained silent. /4
After I became an actor, a few colleagues knew that I was gay, but the world at large did not. Coming out could end a career in that day. I remember watching heartthrob actor Tab Hunter be outed in the gossip rags, then dropped from studios and projects. So I remained silent. /3
As a child, I always knew that I was different than the other boys. They would talk about "Monica," but I had my heart on "Bobby." I played along, but I knew that if I spoke my heart, I would be ostracized. So I remained silent. /2
On this #ValentinesDay I choose to write a love letter--and a confession. The love letter is to the brave souls who, 50 years ago this June, launched the Stonewall Riots and gave birth to the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The confession? Well, read on. This isn't easy to say. /1

The true danger is not this government shutdown, miserable as it is. The true danger is that Trump invokes a false "national emergency" to seize extraordinary powers--enough for him to circumvent Congress--for his wall. We cannot allow that to happen. Please RT this if you agree.
There is a bill pending Wednesday in the House to reopen parts of the government. Many GOP House members are now considering voting for it. Tonight's "address" is a desperate attempt to keep them from bolting. Trump doesn't know what he's doing, and Pelosi has him running scared.

At this point, people should stop asking whether they would ever vote for a woman. Men so far have led the world to the brink of ruination, and into more wars and conflicts than we can count.		At this point, people really should be asking whether they should vote for another man.
@ABC @matthewjdowd Don‚Äôt you have better things to talk about, @ABC?
Let the comedians and the twitterati hash out whether Trump really deserves to be called a motherfuck*r. MSM should stop wringing its hands about tone and focus on ringing the warning bell about a federal government in paralysis.
The press need to stop devoting OpEds and airtime to opinions about crude language and dancing. We have a government shutdown, a president talking about declaring a national emergency, and 800,000 federal workers without pay. The nation is unraveling. Do your real jobs.
Prepare, all good citizens. If Trump declares a ‚ÄúNational Emergency‚Äù in order to fund his wall, the House and the Senate are empowered under the 1976 National Emergencies Act to repudiate it. We will face a constitutional crisis if the Senate simply rolls over. We must mobilize.

Christmas is a time not just to celebrate the birth of Christ but the spirit with which he and his family were received. Let us renew our commitment to the poor, the migrant, the downtrodden‚Äîand share our gift of wealth with them whenever we are able. Merry Christmas, friends.
Let us be clear. The hit to the stock market is entirely self-imposed, due to uncertainties created by Trump‚Äôs tariffs, trade wars, administration missteps, and threats to the integrity of the Fed. He is the reason we are teetering on a bear market. #TrumpSlump
Unfortunately, this morning Santa also submitted his resignation, and so until the Senate can confirm a replacement (Snow Miser is a top contender among his Senate pals) Acting Father Christmas will be The Grinch, who apparently is a big donor to Trump‚Äôs 2020 campaign.

Trump calls Saudi Arabia a "spectacular ally" even after our CIA confirmed that their crown prince ordered the killing of a US resident and WaPo contributor. 		Trump is cozy with thugs who order the killings of their political opponents. Never forget that. Keep your eyes on him.

I value experience and track record. @NancyPelosi has both. She was the architect of the Affordable Care Act. She has unparalleled fundraising abilities. And she just led Dems to their biggest House victory since Watergate. Don't listen to GOP attacks. Pelosi's the woman we need.
Trump blames the CA fires on the under-raking of leaves.		I don't have a further comment, because really nothing is going to beat that on its own.

We won't soon forget the way Kemp suppressed votes in Georgia. They may have "won" this by the count today, but at the high cost of election integrity.		And if the GOP thinks this will dishearten us, they are mistaken. We will fight back harder than ever. We will sweep them away.
