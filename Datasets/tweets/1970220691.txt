@whimsicalmusing The people who didn’t own slaves didn’t get stuff for free.
@whimsicalmusing But my opinion isn’t factually wrong. People picked cotton even after slavery ended. After slavery ended, the northern economy boomed. There is no justification for slavery. Please don’t be a pro-slavery apologist.
@whimsicalmusing If workers are paid wages to do work, the work still gets done. It's just that the workers benefit, too.  If it requires slavery to get things done, we would have starved to death 150 years ago. You're entitled to your opinion; but don't talk down to me.
@whimsicalmusing I don't agree that the entire nation benefited from slavery. The rich people who owned the slaves certainly benefited; but the slaves didn't, poor people didn't, native americans didn't, etc.

@TheMominatrixx @lisakwildman @studentactivism @CNN @GOP American culture is very hard to understand. The man is playing drums, and the kids are singing and dancing. This looks like a celebration. If the man doesn’t want them to sing and dance, why does he encourage them by drumming? Sorry, it is hard to tear oneself away from Twitter!

@TheMominatrixx @lisakwildman @studentactivism @CNN @GOP It was the NA who accosted them.

@TheMominatrixx @lisakwildman @studentactivism The adults are to blame. They should not allow “black out” games, and they should explain to kids why they might cause offense if they go to far with the theme. Don’t demonize kids. Teach them. And stop killing each other so much, Americans.
@TheMominatrixx @lisakwildman @studentactivism This isn’t a “man”. This is a teenager. Part of being a teenager is learning how to interact with people. “Destroying lives” means destroying their reputations for life, taking away education and career opportunities, and making someone more likely to be a target of violence.

@KDogPeele @studentactivism I was told that they might have been having a “black out” game. I had never heard of this phenomenon before today; but evidently it is common in America. Maybe people should be more careful with “black out” games. It looks like sometimes children go too far with the theme.
@TheMominatrixx @lisakwildman @studentactivism We don’t know what the colors originally were. Also, I was told that maybe this was a “black out” game (Don’t ask me. I’m no America pop culture expert). Certainly the kids need to be educated on how to avoid offending people. They don’t deserve to have their lives destroyed.
@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism You said that everyone hates Hikind, and I noted that he was re-elected (which would have been impossible if everyone hated him). I guess foreigners have no right to argue. How could a stupid foreigner know how elections work!
@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism Yes. That sort of thing is a shame, regardless of the race of the innocent victim. It seems to happen a lot in your country. The only thing you guys seem to like more than killing each other is killing Muslims.
@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism Are you referring to the “murdered” black teenager who was bashing a Latino’s head against concrete, and calling him a “faggot”?
@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism It must be great having the privilege of deciding what non-Americans are allowed to talk about.
@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism Obviously the kids need to be educated on how not to unintentionally offend people. They don’t deserve to have their lives destroyed.

Do you have proof that this was a “black out” game? And even if it was, why assume that they were intentionally mocking black people, like this guy was? https://t.co/tPK4GqYhG2

@lisakwildman @TheMominatrixx @studentactivism In the picture, the tee shirts look black. Are you saying that the tee shirts are actually blue, and the image was photoshopped? If so, maybe that’s blue paint, not black. Whatever color the paint is, it’s the same color as the tee shirts.

@mckeonmk @Enquirer I Googled it. I’m not sure I saw the same video, though.

A Native American protestor said that this “theory” is “bullsh*t”.
@mckeonmk @Enquirer Great. I want to skip ahead to that part. At what point does that part start?
@mckeonmk @Enquirer At what point do the students defend stealing native land? The BHI defends stealing native land in the first few minutes of the video.
@mckeonmk @Enquirer Some guy the students didn’t know walked right up to a student and started pounding a drum. Meanwhile BHI was yelling threats, and slurs at the students. Some students chanted school cheers to drown out BHI. Regrettably, some of the more immature students goofed off.
@mckeonmk @Enquirer The students didn’t defend stealing native land.
@mckeonmk @Enquirer I have done so. Take a look here. The video starts with BHI yelling at Native Americans that they lost their land, because they worship buffalo rather than God. Later on, BHI harassed the students. Then the drummer came between them. https://t.co/SBEd6SOMNe

@sjwrenlewis My numbers are the same as yours; but with People’s Vote at 200, and Soft Brexit at 100. Adding May Loyalists and Soft Brexit together gets 300, which is not a majority.

@Otto_English I don’t agree. May’s majority was paper thin to begin with. The DUP will play hardball. Some Conservative MPs who sent in letters against May might be tempted to topple May’s government, hoping for a new, Tory Prime Minister.
