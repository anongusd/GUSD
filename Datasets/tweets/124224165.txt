The World War II generation often spoke to the rest of us about the character and standing of our nation. President Bush‚Äôs passing certainly reminds us what we desire in our leaders: compassion, honesty, trust, grit, &amp; a duty to try and do the right thing.
President George H.W. Bush leaves behind a powerful legacy as a war hero, statesman, &amp; consummate public servant. Above all else, he was a dedicated family man. A husband, father, &amp; grandfather whose faith guided his life in everything he endeavored.

#Taxreform has helped spur economic growth and investment for our nation‚Äôs manufacturing sector and enabled the build-out of more energy infrastructure.
Since the passage of the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act, utility companies in 48 out of 50 states, &amp; DC, have taken action to pass their tax savings on to their customers. In my home state, several utilities have publicly announced their plans to pass on their savings to Michigan families.
This is not just partisan political rhetoric - we are actually seeing the benefits of tax reform across the United States economy. Since the beginning of 2018, the country‚Äôs GDP has risen by 2.2 percent.
The new tax law is the most comprehensive rewrite to the tax code in more than three decades. Across the country, its impacts on our economy are already evident, in the form of reduced tax burdens and more money in the pockets of middle class Americans.

Thanks to tax reform enacted this year, we‚Äôve seen historic investment in our local economies, tax cuts, &amp; more money in worker paychecks. Now, with Opportunity Zones we‚Äôre seeing even more opportunities to build more businesses &amp; create more local jobs.
In good news, The U.S. Treasury &amp; IRS recently approved the state of Michigan‚Äôs application for Opportunity Zones. Michigan was one of only 18 states approved. This first set includes cities and townships throughout Michigan ‚Äî 24 designations in #MI06 alone.
Next, tax benefits are offered for reinvesting prior gains into Qualified Opportunity Funds. These funds must hold at least 90% of their assets into Opportunity Zone properties ‚Äì everything from a local startup to an affordable housing project.
Here‚Äôs how it works: Governors identify a limited number of Opportunity Zones in areas most in need. States are required to consider local economic development initiatives &amp; successes with other programs to ensure Opportunity Zone designations equal LOCAL results.
Despite these efforts, communities in Michigan &amp; across the country still lag behind in business &amp; job growth. It‚Äôs time for new innovative approaches to bring investment to these areas. That‚Äôs where Opportunity Zones come in.
For many years the tax code has provided various tax incentives to encourage economic development in low-income communities. In my neck of the woods down in #MI06, local development groups have a strong track record of leveraging these programs to benefit our communities.
Opportunity Zones are economically distressed rural &amp; urban areas eligible for tax benefits aimed at spurring private investment, econ growth, &amp; local jobs. The goal is to bring long-term, private-sector investment to the places &amp; people who need it most.

We won‚Äôt completely solve the problem of school violence overnight, but we're off to a good start. As we look ahead, there are plenty of additional areas we can find agreement to further improve school safety &amp; curb gun violence but it will take commitment, courage, &amp; consensus.
Importantly, the leg. will provide an historic investment in school safety plans including prevention training for teachers &amp; administrators, the formation of crisis intervention teams with mental health professionals, &amp; better coordination between schools &amp; law enforcement.
In March, Congress passed &amp; the president later signed into law, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018 &amp; the Securing Our Schools Act of 2018. These bipartisan pieces of legislation address flaws in the system that fail to prevent violence in school.
When we send our kids off to school, we expect them to arrive back home safely.
As I've been meeting directly with students, teachers, parents, law enforcement officials, gun owners &amp; others back home in places like St. Joe, Portage, Kalamazoo, Gull Lake, Niles, Hartford and elsewhere it's clear school safety is at the forefront for many folks.
Today‚Äôs announcement that @onetoughnerd's request for assistance from the U.S. SBA was approved for dealing with flood recovery costs is welcome news for our area. These low-interest loans will help our local businesses &amp; residents recover. https://t.co/zCikn2xBEn #MI06

More recently, I introduced bipartisan legislation alongside @RepDebDingell - the ACE Research Act - to provide the NIH support on research for new, non-addictive pain killers &amp; other emerging technologies that can offer hope to those suffering from opioid addiction.
As part of our landmark 21st Century Cures Act, an additional $1 billion was allocated to states to address opioid addiction treatment &amp; prevention. Michigan was on the receiving end of more than $16M - this will have a real impact on those suffering from addiction.
In 2016, #CARA was signed into law. This sweeping package of laws attacks the opioid epidemic from all sides. This legislation included more than a dozen bills passed by @HouseCommerce &amp; I proudly chaired the Conference Committee that finalized the comprehensive package.
The tragic opioid abuse epidemic has hit communities here in #MI06 and across the country. In response, we have led the charge to pass bipartisan legislation to address this epidemic.

Consumers are also seeing lower energy costs thanks to tax reform. With more to come, several utilities have publicly announced their plans to pass on their savings to families in Michigan.
We also saw the big news that Fiat-Chrysler announced they were investing more than $1 billion to modernize a plant in Michigan, providing bonuses for employees, and adding 2,500 jobs and moving some truck production back from Mexico.
Also recently attended a groundbreaking ceremony at Pfizer in #Portage for a state-of-the-art facility that means more than 200 new high-skilled, high-wage jobs &amp; a stronger economy for our region. They also recently announced bonuses for all non-executive employees.
I recently visited the folks at Shelton‚Äôs Farm Market in #Niles. They‚Äôre doling out bonuses for all 80 of their employees &amp; their leadership team told me that they‚Äôre feeling more optimistic than ever about the future of their business thanks to tax reform.
We promised a focus on the middle-class &amp; we‚Äôre delivering on that promise. The U.S. Treasury Dept reports that upward of 90% of workers will see in increase in take-home pay, reflecting the lower rates, larger standard deduction, &amp; doubled Child Tax Credit.

Folks in Michigan and across the country are sick of the dysfunction, it's time to get our government working again for the people we serve. Today's two-year bipartisan budget agreement is a great first step.
Of critical importance to Michigan, it also furthers our efforts to combat opioid abuse and drug addiction. No bipartisan deal such as this is perfect - we came together and both sides made compromises...
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 properly funds our military and gives our soldiers a pay raise. It makes critical investments in America‚Äôs veterans, medical research, community health centers, disaster relief, and infrastructure...

It has become abundantly clear that our outdated tax code is a major drag on our economy and on Michigan families struggling to get by.  That is why I support efforts to advance pro-growth, pro-American tax reform and relief.
I've heard countless stories from constituents impacted by a tax code that is outdated, unwieldy, and too often rewards special interests at the cost of regular folks.
Plain and simple: our tax system is broken. It has not been updated since 1986 and since that time has become a complicated mess.

While every budget is merely a blueprint, it‚Äôs important we keep the momentum going for our pro-growth tax reform initiatives.
Importantly, this budget keeps spending levels in place for key domestic items such as the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative and the NIH.
This budget blueprint also outlines reasonable measures to reduce our deficit while charting a path on how we can get there.
With the passage of this budget resolution, the path to pro-growth, pro-American #taxreform has been made easier: https://t.co/1EbBDM5N1d
