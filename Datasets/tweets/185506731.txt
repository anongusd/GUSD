25/ As with most aspects of this topic, the problems are not made out of thin air. As I outlined above, these are real, long-standing issues and it does seem that the Norwegians were caught spying. But that doesn't mean that Russia isn't maximizing this case....
24/ Some might see that as naive, but many residents see it as pushing back against Cold War 2.0 hysteria. Of course, this leads to the question of how much of this is Russia influencing and not just something organic happening on its own.
23/ This isn't to imply that northerners are brainwashed by Russian propaganda or something. They have a different perspective on Russia. As people would often say in Kirkenes: "the closer you are to Russia, the less you fear it."
22/ There's been plenty of propaganda and misinformation around the case, but the impact and debates that have resulted b/c of the arrest and details that have come out afterwards have caused real distrust in the north towards the government and spy services
21/ The FSB have said that they were monitoring Berg since 2015, but it's hard to say what the answer to the above question is. Either way, there is evidence that Russia has used to case to its advantage and to sow divisions.
20/ Berg's case lands right on this North-South fault line. This has led to two main questions around his arrest: Was he set up to provoke an incident to help undermine a strategic NATO member? Or was he simply swept up in an operation where Norway was outmatched?
19/ This has been an indirect way of getting to how an espionage case can be used to inflame internal divisions. North &amp; South difference in Norway are not new, but the heightened security environment of recent years &amp; deepening standoff w/ Russia have given them new meaning.
18/ Frode Berg's case  and its fallout -- as well as the Cold War-like rhetoric and actions between Russian and the West since 2014 -- have obviously brought lots of these feelings back up to the surface.
17/ But the legacy and wounds from those days are still in many ways raw. Lots of people expressed distrust of the intelligence services to me while reporting up there
16/ In 1996, the government even formally apologized and recognized that they overstepped during that period. https://t.co/ED3vAi1zNb
15/ During the Cold War, leftist politics were big up north and there were plenty of Communist sympathizers (and as discussed above, real cases of spying for the Soviets). This led to widespread surveillance (and harassment) of northern communities by Norwegian intelligence
14/ The lack of recognition of those who helped the Soviets is a point of contention and there has been a movement to get their contribution to the liberation of Norway better recognized (officially and unofficially)
13/ This, of course, is a different history from the rest of the country that had British and US -assisted resistance movements and pushed the Nazis out with their help.
12/ Northern Norway also has a different WWII history than the rest of the country. Kirkenes was liberated by the Soviets from the Nazis in 1944. Many people from the regions fought as partisans for the Soviets during WWII, gathering info on their behalf and helping w/ operations https://t.co/9NX9yQbTsT
11/ Norway's involvement even led to Nikita Khrushchev threatening to use an atomic bomb to flatten Bod√∏ airport in Norway as a possible consequence for Oslo‚Äôs cooperation.
10/ Operation Grand Slam, the U-2 spy plane flight operated by Gary Powers that went down over the Soviet Union was supposed to go from Pakistan to northern Norway. https://t.co/D9504VvpvY
9/ Spying in northern Norway also played a role in the U-2 spy case in the 1960s. A young Norwegian recruited by the Soviets provided them with a picture of a U2 plane in Bod√∏ airport, further establishing Norwegian and American involvement with the spy plane
8/ ...it became famous as a spy nest, where Soviet operatives would recruit Norwegians to spy back in Norway. The bar was eventually shut down and Norwegian authorities put a stop to crossings, aided by the death of an American tourist in Soviet custody. https://t.co/gNOgfkGMGC
7/ But I was surprised as I learned about the Cold War history up north and that it's long been an active area for spying and the fight for the hearts and minds. In the 1960s, the Soviets even opened up a bar across the border that was a popular destination...
6/ For northern Norwegians, Russians neighbors are their friends. Economies are entwined &amp; the visa-free travel creates lots of contact. A popular refrain from people in my reporting was that Oslo doesn't understand Russia and should listen more to northerners
5/ For one, people are mad at the spy services and the government in Oslo that someone from a community used to build trust across the border was recruited for an operation. Also, the revelation that other people had been approached, sparked further anger.
4/ In northern Norway -- and Berg's hometown of Kirkenes in particular -- his case has had a real effect. While the initial shock has dissipated, Berg's admission that he worked as a courier for Norwegian military intelligence has had a real effect on people.
3/ Berg's lawyers have limited access to him. They say the best is case to secure his release in a prisoner swap. The problem has been that Norway has no one to trade. But in late Sept., Oslo arrested a Russian citizen for potential spying https://t.co/9K1f4cBcKF
2/ For starters, Frode Berg is still in Moscow. Earlier this week, his detention was extended until December. He still has no trial date and Russian authorities can extend his time w/o a trial for 18 months from the time of his arrest (Dec. 2017).
1/ Now that this piece is out in @ForeignPolicy/ @CodaStory, I thought it was worth talking more about the spy case and also some details that didn't make it into the final copy. Hope you'll follow this to the end. https://t.co/lXMEavupCt / https://t.co/9Di3dxnDzK

5/ They now face a common dilemma for populist parties. They want to keep growing their tent, but how can they expand and become more mainstream and accepted without pulling themselves apart.
4/ It will also be key for the future of the Sweden Democrats. They have managed to change the debate on immigration in the country and pushed the other big parties to the right on the issue.
3/ They probably won't be part of the next government, but are a potential kingmaker and will play a direct or indirect role in whatever Sweden's next government is.
2/ There has been lots of sensationalist commentary about SD in the lead up to this election and it's important to push back against that. But also, we shouldn't minimize that they grew and have solidified themselves in the political landscape.
1/ People are right to point out that SD unperformed compared to polls and that they represent a small share of the overall Swedish views. But still, they are the third largest party, gained seats, and will be decisive in the coming negotiations.

Early exit polls are disappointing for the Sweden Democrats, who are shown with only 16.3%, down from the nearly 20 percent they were polling out. Also, Social Democrats and Moderates are projected for disappointing nights.

8/ 	-In sum, don't hold your breath about Finland joining NATO.
7/ 	- Trump and his turmoil with Europe and NATO don't give lots confidence right now. Finland is a Western EU country, but Russians still view it as a buffer state and would see FIN NATO membership as a serious game changer. At the moment, no one wants to break the status quo
6/	- No one in Finnish politics wants to be the guy to poke the Kremlin in the eye. In my opinion, Finnish politicians are scared of provoking Russia and are in extra caution mode of late.
5/	-Finland is not a neutral country and this isn't the Cold War, but that doesn't mean Finland isn't doing a modified 21st century balancing act with Russia, the U.S., NATO and West at large. Russia has made it clear they would "take action" against Finland if it joined NATO...
4/ 	-There are few politicians in Finland that actually want to take up foreign policy issues. Public debate is lacking and at times depressingly absent from politics in Finland.
3/	- The only thing that I could see moving Finland towards actually joining NATO (at least until the next generation takes power) would be if Sweden joins, which depending on their next election, isn't out of the question. But would also not be a fast process.
2/ 	- Support for membership is low in Finland (around 1/4 of the population.) This article references a poll that shows that 1/3 of Finnish voters would change their opinion on joining NATO if the president came out in favor. Which is interesting, but won't happen with Niinisto
1/ A few things on this:	- "A possibility" isn't a change from Niinisto's line on NATO. He has pursued an open door policy, keeping the option open and potentially pursuing membership as a chip to leverage with Russia. 	https://t.co/DsunLdaHZZ

6/ I get the urge to correct the record, but this doesn't come across as some smart form of push back. It looks like a rhetorical retreat from an entire ministry after some comments were made by a Russian official off the cuff at an event.
5/ I spent the last few weeks writing articles about Finland's relations w/ Russia &amp; the West, and corrected more than a few journos about calling Finland neutral. But it's hard to have sympathy when statements like this happen. Maybe you can see why foreigners get confused?
4/ Not to mention the second-last graf of the statement, which is basically saying that cooperation with NATO is not so strong and is "case-specific."
3/ If I am Shoigu and I say something inflammatory about Sweden and Finland drifting closer to NATO and then Finland puts out a statement saying "Shoygu is incorrect in saying that Finland is being pulled into NATO" then that's pretty much what I want to hear
2/ After hearing all the consternation from Finnish officials over the last few weeks during the summit about how foreign journalists kept calling Finland neutral or "neutral ground", this statement doesn't help. It just muddies the waters about where Helsinki stands

So... "Trump is scheduled to be in Brussels July 11-12 for a meeting of the NATO military alliance, before traveling to the U.K. for events on July 13." The final World Cup game is July 15 in Russia. Does that mean July 14 would be the meeting? https://t.co/HFsfWEytJA

---&gt;  Everyone has figured out Trump: Uzbekistan signed over 20 major business deals with United States companies, which "could sustain more than 10,000 U.S. jobs and open opportunities for billions of dollars in future U.S. contracts."
"Both leaders vowed to intensify constructive cooperation to protect fundamental human freedoms, including the promotion of religious freedom. President Mirziyoyev committed to implement a comprehensive roadmap to advance religious freedom."
"President Trump applauded President Mirziyoyev‚Äôs ambitious reform program to improve the human rights situation in Uzbekistan ... These accomplishments have created the conditions for increased economic, political, and security cooperation."
"President Mirziyoyev declared that progress in Uzbekistan is irreversible, underscoring that the government must always place the Uzbek people‚Äôs interests first."
A five-year plan, what could possibly go wrong? "President Mirziyoyev‚Äôs ‚ÄúFive Year Strategy of Action‚Äù promotes good governance, judicial reform and rule of law, economic liberalization, social development, and an open and constructive foreign policy."
Here is the readout of Trump's meeting with Mirziyoyev yesterday. A lot of what you'd expect, but here are some highlights below: https://t.co/ywpXsoRJ2m
RT @joannalillis: #Uzbekistan media says human rights discussed at meeting with Trump https://t.co/NwR7HWOFKi
@BrucePannier @nytimes not in the slightest. I keep going on this thread though!
So far this is just one meeting &amp; it's not like things have fallen apart. As I wrote for @washingtonpost's @DemocracyPost on the White House visit, we should be skeptical about Uzbekistan and Trump, but helping open up the country is worth pursuing. https://t.co/A8HIca6vVR
The new government wants this money back and has issued a call for the money to be repatriated in the past. What it will take for this money to be sent back will be an important litmus test for how serious the Trump admin is about a new Uzbekistan policy.
Karimova is accused of accepting bribes to allow an Amsterdam-based telecom company to enter the Uzbek market. DOJ is obliged to return assets seized through the initiative to the victimized countries, once a court determines whether there are valid claims to ownership
Another important thing to keep an eye on as things move forward for U.S.-Uzbekistan ties is what happens to the nearly $1 billion seized through U.S. kleptocracy initiative. The money was funneled through corrupt deals by Gulnara Karimova, the previous president's daughter ...
No doubt, this is part of what makes Trump appealing to Central Asian leaders. I tried to get into this back in January 2017 after Trump took office and there was lots of optimism about him. https://t.co/oKtjqNqEfE
It's possible they pressed for this behind the scenes or on a different level and this was mostly a meet and greet/ photo op for the two presidents. But there is, of course, the risk that Trump doesn't really care about human rights concerns or press freedom...
Here is the full report: https://t.co/SUHU16KqxO

I wrote about this back when Trump took office. https://t.co/oKtjqNqEfE
Will be interesting to follow this. No doubt Trump's transactionalism was warmly met by Central Asian leaders, who see this as a new way to get back in Washington's good graces after so many years on the sidelines. Especially in Uzbekistan's case.
This is no doubt a big diplomatic coup for Uzbekistan and the new regime. The first visit since Karimov was welcomed by George W. Bush in 2002 after 9/11.

@eerohokkanen @FIArctic @MakiReinikkaUM Also, no offense, but if you are calling this alarmist, then I think you need to readjust your definition of that word. I think calling this yellow journalism is very off base and veering far outside of your lane and reflects poorly on you and Arctia.
@eerohokkanen @FIArctic @MakiReinikkaUM But beyond all that, it's not the job of journalism to write headlines that please communications staff or the narratives you are trying to push.
@eerohokkanen @FIArctic @MakiReinikkaUM Hi @eerohokkanen.

@davidmacdougall @HenriVanhanen @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera Also, (and final point). The reason why the outside world focuses on NATO is b/c it is the lens that most countries/governments see defense/foreign issues in Finland.
@davidmacdougall @HenriVanhanen @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera And in general, this election has been frustrating to watch, mostly for the lack of real debate on foreign policy issues. Most politicians have mumbled their way through. Whether you're pro or anti NATO, it's an important issue and public would benefit from better discussion
@davidmacdougall @HenriVanhanen @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera Having said all that. 1) I'm not sold on a referendum on that, especially given direct democracy's recent SNAFU's 2) the main reason I posted this article, is that I was surprised to see them brush aside Swedish membership as if it wouldn't greatly shake things up
@davidmacdougall @HenriVanhanen @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera I agree with David that Niinist√∂ is frustratingly cryptic on the issue. Only really clear about not wanting to take a clear position, but I guess that's the point. And Henri, yes, Sauli has broad popularity and mandate, but what's the point of political capital if not to use it?
@HenriVanhanen @davidmacdougall @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera Feel free to share now, too!
@davidmacdougall Yeah, I think that's mostly true, which is interesting in and of itself. But I also know lots of Finns who have told me that they like Torvalds' NATO position but just 1) don't see him as a viable enough candidate 2) have a hard time going for Swedish party given its narrow focus
@davidmacdougall curious what you all think, @Himantero @charlyjsp @veitera?
@davidmacdougall But Sweden joining changes things quite a bit and might force Helsinki's hand, so to speak. That was a central part of that report commissioned by the MFA in 2016. https://t.co/fHnQcQIvCh
@davidmacdougall Highly debatable and largely theoretical at this point what would happen if a high-profile politician were to champion it. EU membership wasn't very popular idea at first either, until politicians made the case to public...
@davidmacdougall What I also find interesting about NATO debate here, only roughly a quarter of Finns come out in favor. But polls have also shown that if an elected leader were to come out and make the case, they'd reconsider. But no one wants to be the one to make that case.
@davidmacdougall ... But also, I think like elections anywhere, most people don't really get swayed by FP issues in elections, even in this, which is theoretically supposed to be about them. /2
@davidmacdougall I'm sure he'd probably be polling somewhere close to that anyways. I wonder what kind of platform the issue would have drawn if it was championed by someone not from the Swedish People's party and had a larger profile..../1
All Finnish presidential candidates, except for @NilsTorvalds, say that it's possible for Finland to stay outside of NATO even if Sweden were to join... maybe possible, but smart? https://t.co/xab5V2bgL1
