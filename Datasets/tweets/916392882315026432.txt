@jjonesholcombe @TechSolidarity @Flipthe14 @ButteCountyDems Congratulations @jjonesholcombe
Winning a majority of local delegate votes at the #CA08 pre-endorsement conference is a major vote of confidence. Grassroots leaders are tired of entrenched prof‚Äôl politicians from both parties! I look forward to securing CA Dem Party endorsement at the Feb. state convention.
Humbled to have achieved 60% of the votes in yesterday's pre-endorsement caucus.  This after just 3 months of campaigning.  Thanks to all who can see with me the road to victory in this congressional district.
Loved meeting with Rev. Jim Burklo @jtburklo last month to talk faith, politics, and public service. #CA08 https://t.co/533dNpEQfJ

Such a beautiful building with incredible history.  The land was dedicated in 1860 (before the Civil War) and the building was built 20 years later.  Oh if those walls could talk!
I was so honored to meet Chairman Vega and other tribal leaders and elders.  I am moved by how dedicated these amazing leaders are to their people.  I hope to emulate their example.
Also heard from the wonderful, dedicated healthcare professionals about needs in their community.  They're fearful about the negative impacts of sabotage to the ACA.  I call on current leaders to reverse this horrible trend and do the patriotic thing - support our constituents!
