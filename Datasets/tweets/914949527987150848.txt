@DiamondandSilk @DebiJon36345603 It was the Democrats who targeted a whole Race with their War on Blacks aka Super Predators with their 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act with mandated 100:1 sentencing disparities.	Going after the President is nothing 	but is in line with their socialist agenda!
@Mamaleh_Trump @CongressmanHice @Jim_Jordan @GOPoversight It effectively scuttled the Trump/Kim Summit!	I feel Democrats would rather West Coast cities be sacrificed in nuclear holocaust than for Trump to succeed.

@mikebwonder Not at all!
@HillaryClinton Did you apologize for targeting Blacks with 100:1 sentencing disparities with the 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act all based on a lie about Crack Cocaine?	How many Super Predators did this wrong headed thinking create?	How many Black lives did it destroy?
@barcssarc @GOP @realDonaldTrump I’m pointing out other nation leaders of the world said nice things about past U.S. leaders because we willingly gave up money to have friends.	The E.U. charges us an average 10% tariffs &amp; China charges us 25% !	We have been sacrificing manufacturing jobs for decades for friends?

@Mamaleh_Trump @essenviews We did not take a time out on tariffs, we are still charging 10% on many Chinese imports.	Trump just postponed going to 25% to match China’s tariffs.

@Mamaleh_Trump @essenviews Not really!	Tell me, do you support China’s average 25% protective tariffs while we only charge them 2.5%?	Negotiations didn’t work to fix this so Trump raised our tariffs to 10% with little effect but the threat to match China’s tariffs did bring them back to negotiate.

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Let’s face it, Trump is against the Globalist!	After many years of brainwashing by the leftist media only half the nation has succumbed to their brainwashing!	This is pushing the Globalist media to expose its bias!

@PattyMurray Then Senator insure Congress sends a Spending Bill to the President!	You failed last time never achieving the 69 votes in the Senate!	It was never a Trump Shutdown because the Senate Failed!	No more SenateShutdowns!
@DanPannozzo @RWPUSA @MalcolmNance Dan as someone that worked in manufacturing justify to me another manufacturing worker why China’s 25% tariff &amp; the EU’s 10% tariffs on my products are fair where as we only charge both of them 2.5% tariffs on the same products?	That’s why Trump was elected!

@DanPannozzo @RWPUSA I work in manufacturing. That’s simply not true. Thursday after Trump was elected our largest customer showed up wanting a meeting. They said that crazy Trump will start a TRADE WAR. We want to lock up 25% of our capacity. Then the next customer showed up and the next!	Cont...

@Heather99851724 @RWPUSA I wish Richard had gone a little further&amp;explained this became a real threat with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999sign by President Clinton!The larger the Banks the greater the  corruption!	Just look at the 2008 Banking Crisis!It’s bipartisan because almost no one went to jail!
@CoDoArtWorks @RWPUSA No this is where the real harm started!	Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999!	The repeal of the Glass Steagall Act by President Clinton!	Trump is just a knee-jerk reaction to this Globalization!
@KermitHigby @RWPUSA That’s the most ignorant statement this morning!	If we want to thank anyone it has to be Bill Clinton &amp; Gramm &amp; their 99 Banking Modernization Act or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.
@MaximusMager @RWPUSA LMAO!	It was bipartisan signed by Bill Clinton that got us into this mess with the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act!	Do you have a third party in mind that would reintroduce Glass Steagall and limit Banks to State lines?
@andrew_i_am @RWPUSA The best solution would be to bring back the Glass Steagall Act which would limit the size of Banks &amp; the potential harm these institutions can do this reducing potential corruption!	The 99 Banking Modernization Act caused the 2008 Housing Crash!	The potential is still there!
@DanPannozzo @RWPUSA LMAO!Dan it was the Clinton’s &amp; their 99 Banking Modernization Act that makes Kleptocracy a real possibility in the U.S. with undoing the Glass Steagall Act which limited the size of Banks and thus the potential corruption!	Those you call deplorable stopped drinking the Koo-Aid!
@RWPUSA You make a strong argument to go back to the foundation of safe Banking the Glass Steagall Act!	Limit the size of Banks automatically limits corruption!	The argument for doing away with Glass Steagall was so America Banks could loan money to countries like Greece.

@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Taking racism lessons from Democrats is like taking feminism lessons from Harvey Weinstein!	Thank God Trump is undoing Democrats War on Blacks with the First Step Act!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Senator why are you fighting so hard to maintain the supply of Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal labor!	Is it your maid service?	Is it your gardener?	Democrats the Party of Slavery still the party of Cheap illegal Exploited labor!	Fight for non-Exploited legal immigration!
@johncardillo @EOLeinberger If I were a Judge I would throw out the case and say Stone can’t possibly get a fair trial anywhere that has CNN!	You invite the news for a splashy arrest you as a prosecutor lose all integrity!	You are no longer a prosecutor you are a politician!
@RyanAFournier @meschief_55 Wrong!	They never had 60 votes in the Senate!

@hotmess42363108 @wazzudave77 @senatemajldr @IWV First off it’s a 234 mile extension and repairs to Obama’s 600+ mile WALL!	And Pelosi had Democrats vote down paying Federal workers!	Schumer wouldn’t let a clean Bill go through to pay the Coast Guard!	https://t.co/kfVpwBFYKs	https://t.co/VZPiL7OuVu
@tomholmes2016 @mrPauliePaul @SenFeinstein I’ll take that bet!
@DLiberally @SenFeinstein Garbage!
@SenFeinstein Something Democrats refused to do!	We have a 3 week time out!
@SenJeffMerkley What’s your argument?	Pointing out Democrat &amp; RINO Globalists Control much of the mechanism of government?	When one looks at what crimes Democrats get away with &amp; compare there’s no doubt.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You have a Three Week victory, or what most will call a Time Out!	The funding for the extension to Obama’s Wall will be in the final agreement!
@RWPUSA More like a Time Out!	3 weeks and without the funding for the Wall we will do this again!	Richard, what is your personal reason to maintain the flow of Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal labor?	Is it your maid or your gardener?
@SenSanders A typical Democratic lie!	You Senator and your colleagues never sent Trump a Spending Bill to Veto!	You could never get the 60 votes needed!	If MSM wasn’t your Joesph Goebbels propagandist more Americans would understand their 9th Grade Civics!
@SenJeffMerkley @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Do you understand the difference between Defeat  and Time out?	Don’t worry you will.
@SenJeffMerkley Senator this per my 9th Grade Civics test never became the TrumpShutdown because Congress never produced a Spending Bill!	Do you understand what the separation of powers really means?
@SenJeffMerkley Are Democrats coming back from their Holiday?
@KamalaHarris First off it’s not President Trump’s vanity project he is merely adding 234 miles of President Obama’s wall!	Secondly Democrats in the House refused to pay Federal Workers &amp; Schumer refused to pay the Coast Guard!	Are you feeling the pressure Senator?	https://t.co/VZPiL866k4

@melinda_mosheim @crampell I use to say “The WAPO is to news what Harvey Weinstein is to Feminism!”	Then Sarah Beattie of SNL offered oral sex to anyone who would punch a kid, Nick Sandmann &amp; I’m not sure that’s a good comparison anymore....
@IsabelDuffie @charliekirk11 Nick is guilty of FaceCrime!	Leftist are bringing about Orwell’s 1984!

@rosedixontx @_Proud_American As the author of the most racist Law since the Law that created the Japanese Internment Camp’s, Vice President Biden has much to answer for his racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act!	100:1 sentencing disparities for Blacks &amp; the Republicans &amp; Trump had to fix it!
@CharriseLane @tcarmistead @oldmanebro The way people are attacked when they wear the MAGA hat is like the reception Jews got when wearing the Gold Star sew into their garments...

@jmesd @SenJeffMerkley So you get your vote do you truly think 20 Republican Senators are planning to retire after this term?
@rdFran @SenJeffMerkley @eralpatky That will take a year and then you have to convince 20 Republican Senators who plan to retire to vote with you!
@SenJeffMerkley Senate Democrats claim that they care for the middle class, but the SenateShutdown is harming hundreds of thousands of families across the U.S. It’s time to reopen the government.	Until you guys in Congress send Trump a Spending Bill it’s your Shutdown!
@MrRon3313 @newtgingrich @POTUS The Democrats House Bill needs (get this) 20 Republican Senator votes to become law!	A vote is a waste of time like Democrats wasting to this point over $50 billion not to add to Obama’s wall!
@MrRon3313 @newtgingrich @POTUS As I said the President is just a Cheer Leader until he is presented with a Spending Bill.	This is not a hearing exam it’s a Government Class.
Democrats are hypersensitivity to Racism, But anyone that supports Democrats who supported the 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act is by Definition a Racist or an Uncle Tom depending on race!	And it took Republicans &amp; Trump to undo the Democrats &amp; Clinton’s Legacy!

@CNN Bernie lost all rights to call anyone a racist when he voted for the Racist Target Blacks 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act particularly the President who undid his the &amp; the Clinton’s Legacy!	All based on a lie!		https://t.co/Hvg33G8TGB
@realDonaldTrump @VP Here’s a thought question.	Would ‘Uncle Tom’ support Democrats like the Clintons, Biden, KKKByrd, Bernie Sanders for passing the Racist target Blacks 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act with unfair sentencing?	Would ‘Uncle Tom’ support Trump for undoing this legacy?
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Yes! Can you imagine Trump undid the Clinton’s Legacy their crowning achievement giving Free Room &amp; Board to Blacks unjustly sent to prison with the Democrats racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act!	You have no clue about Human Rights!

@NumbersMean @jpjinco President Obama was a good politician but what he knows about manufacturing is what fills engineering books!	How automation has worked for us is the guys are like George Jetson, they push a button but closely monitor the operation.
@NumbersMean @jpjinco For the record; Obama did not directly connect the GDP with a Magic Wand.	Obama did say (high paying) manufacturing jobs were gone forever and would require a Magic Wand to bring them back.	Thanks for the conversation.	I
@stenstadvold_m @bastafarian13 @CraigChamberlin @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer In NC one guy tried ballot harvesting I think he is going to jail.
@NumbersMean @jpjinco You don’t understand the economy do you?	Manufacturing jobs are the greatest multiplier of other jobs. 	I ‘ve seen studies in rural America where each manufacturing job creates 3.6 more other jobs.
@JayDeaz @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Because McConnell can’t get the 60 votes needed!	He needs 7 Democrats!	Schumer needs 20 Republican votes to override a Presidential Veto!	When Trump gets to Veto a Spending Bill then it becomes the TrumpShutdown!
@adshubert @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Good point just use the funds the DEA has collected from the Mexican Cartels &amp; El Chapo.
@MarnelMn @GeraldoRivera @ace2blue @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer If you will refer back through the news you will see Congress never sent a Spending Billy the President!	From 9th Grade Civics the President is just a Cheer Leader until Congress fulfills its obligation.	Trump was never given a Bill to sign or Veto!
@stenstadvold_m @bastafarian13 @CraigChamberlin @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Funny you bring that up! Ballot harvesting in California makes gerrymandering look like child’s play!	But Republicans gain seats in the Senate where Gerrymandering doesn’t count!
@MaryPer71733421 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Trump tried that for 2 years.
@DavidCastillo99 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You suffer from to much brainwashing and not enough 9th Grade Civics!	President Trump never got a Spending Bill to sign or Veto!	Until this happens per the Constitution the President is just a Cheer Leader!	This is Congresses Shutdown until they fulfill their duty!
@lepton939 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Good of the country?	What country is that, China, Iran, Russia?	Trump brought back high paying manufacturing jobs &amp; that’s great for the U.S.!	https://t.co/NsSoyQhf9N

@NumbersMean @jpjinco Watch this!	https://t.co/BWsUMiJZuc
@NumbersMean @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump But instead of laying people off we increase production &amp; automation is a great way to innovate.	Most don’t understand but most good innovation comes from the people on the manufacturing floor!
@NumbersMean @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump In a Free Enterprise capitalist system there are no such guarantees.	As for automation Elon Musk said, “Humans are underrated”!	We have automated in the manufacturing I work at but in 43 years we have never had a lay-off!

@Cheeverl @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I thought I put it in words you could comprehend....
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Pelosi &amp; Schumer could end this you understand?
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Here’s a lesson in 9th Grade Civics, per the Constitution Congress has to present the President with a Spending Bill to Veto to take credit for the Shutdown. Until the President receives a Spending Bill he’s just a Cheerleader for one side or the other.	See how that works?
@lizziewonka @xtabuxangelx @lilponyusa @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Off topic.
@xtabuxangelx @lilponyusa @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump For those who failed 9th Grade Civics, Congress had to present the President with a Spending Bill to Veto to claim credit for the DemocratShutdown!	He never got his chance to tell Pelosi &amp; Schumer where to stick their Bill!	If you need further tutoring in Civics I’m available.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You have not been watching the National Gossip Media, you can’t really call them news since they get so many stories wrong!	Trump has tried negotiating but the Democratic Leadership would rather go on vacations!
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately Pelosi &amp; Schumer per our Constitution are the ones holding things up!	Trump never even got to Veto their Spending Bill so he can’t even take credit for the DemocratShutdown!
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump And to think the extension to Obama’s Wall would have only cost 0.11% of the GDP!	Are all Democrats mathematically challenged or just their Leadership?
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump From 9th Grade Civics, that’s a absolutely not true!	Congress has to pass a Spending Bill and the President has to sign it to end the SenateShutdown.	At this point McConnell doesn’t have 7 Democrats and to override a Presidential Veto SchumerShutdown needs 20 Republicans!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump This may go over your head being a Leftist limits people most are Mathematically Challenged, but Pelosi could end the sufferings of 800,000 Federal workers &amp; some 4,000,000 Federal Contract Workers!	Think about how that blade cuts both ways!
@Cheeverl @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump I feel/fear Pelosi is a narcissist with zero empathy or compassion for anyone or anything but her wallet and the power trip she is on. 😧	This is a worldwide nightmare...
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Pelosi doesn’t care about our country nor about our future. And he lies about everything including spreading conspiracy theories that climate change is just a Chinese hoax or that we need global warming because it’s cold outside today. It’s unconscionable. https://t.co/tlJaWiMSqq
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump But Pelosi doesn’t care about 800,000 federal workers who aren’t getting paid. To him, they are just hostages and human bargaining chips. He doesn’t care about American citizens who are placed in jeopardy because of the shutdown either. To him, we’re just expendable pawns.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Your post should have been; “Pelosi doesn’t care about the 800,000 federal employees who aren’t getting paid. Some of them, who have type 1 diabetes, are rationing their own insulin because they have no paycheck.”
@CNN CNN is Leftist propaganda!	It’s not even good gossip anymore!
@RodriquezKhaliq @rhod07334710 They have already in this Shutdown wasted over 1% of the Federal Budget not to extend Obama’s wall!
@RMettner @JerryMoran @senrobportman Clinton did!	Of course Ignorance is a prerequisite to being a leftist.
@stephphilip8 @pat_yust Democrats would rather the U.S. went into a long deep Depression than for Trump to extend Obama’s WALL?

@MAR0855 @thecjpearson Your ignorance is something to behold!	Btw it wasn’t A Republican Congress or President that passed the most racist laws since Jim Crow Laws also passed by Democrats it was the Clinton’s Legacy until Trump undid it!	https://t.co/NkU9PDktbA

@steven_t_keller @GOP Nah, it’s actually the Mexican Cartels &amp; El Chapo who are funding the Wall!

@MrRon3313 @newtgingrich @POTUS Ron did you fail 9th Grade Civics or are you brainwashed by MSM?	Trump wanted credit for the Shutdown like Clinton did with his Veto’s but Congress never let Trump!

@BSpaniel91 @PattyMurray What Tribe do you claim?	I can better answer your point.
@KamalaHarris Congress has wasted per Senator Jeff Merkley’s calculations over $47billion not to spend $5billion to extend Obama’s Wall!	Not to mention the hardship it has caused over 800,000 Federal workers &amp; the 4,000,000 Federal Contractors!	Are Democrats cruel or mathematically challenged?
@whitmoreje @PattyMurray Sarcasm!	I love it!
@BSpaniel91 @PattyMurray As I said you probably wouldn’t be here &amp; your Native American descendants of your Native American ancestors would have been forced to speak French or Spanish as opposed to it being an elective...
@WSeattlePete @PattyMurray So wasting over $47 billion to date is better than spending $5 billion to extend Obama’s WALL?
@BSpaniel91 @PattyMurray Yes, that might be true but you wouldn’t be here &amp; chances are they would be speaking Spanish or French....
@mhuber51215711 @PattyMurray Why would adding 200 miles to Obama’s WALL be a vanity project when his own former CBP officer who Trump fired said it was desperately needed?
@WSeattlePete @PattyMurray Nothing will stop illegal immigration other than Open Borders.	The point is to slow it down like the Wall did to the Caravan in San Diego!
@Techtonic17 @PattyMurray @RinaRay56644337 Good point!	Democrats have wasted over $47 billion and caused hardship in most cases irreparable hardship on 4-5 million Americans not to add a $5 billion extension to Obama’s WALL!
@Palooke76 @PattyMurray Yes, thank you Senator for wasting over $47 billion and forcing hardship on 800,000 Federal employees not to adding a $5 billion extension to Obama’s WALL!	Democrats are mathematically challenged.
@BSpaniel91 @PattyMurray Then Great Great Grandmother would have never meet my Great Great Grandfater!

@WalterAppling @jfediganpgm @AP We survive through innovation!	So much of our innovations come from observations &amp; questions from our operators on the floor.	We have never in 43 years had a lay-off!	Not many manufacturing companies especially textile companies can make this claim.
@WalterAppling @jfediganpgm @AP Walter, I help run the largest knit dye house in NAFTA.	Our lowest paid 1st year employees make over $50,000/yr under Trump &amp; his tariff threats.	It was less than $30,000 under Obama.	We have automated but as Elon Musk says “Humans are underrated!”
@WalterAppling @jfediganpgm @AP The systematic destruction of our manufacturing base since NAFTA for geopolitics has done more to weaken the U.S. 	Allowing China &amp; E.U. to respectively charge a base tariff of 25% &amp; 10% while we only charge them 2.5% is manufacturing suicide !
@GCoinCollector Obviously today justice is not for All!
@WalterAppling @jfediganpgm @AP You have a point.	The Pelosi Poisoners would rather the U.S. fail than Trump succeed!	&amp; are crazy enough &amp; willing to have a coup to stop Trump!	I was late to the Trump Train but Trump brought back manufacturing even though Obama said those jobs were gone forever!

@ang_cianciosi @Malexander @AP He never had the 60 votes in the Senate!
@PabloReyes0220 @Malexander @AP Civics 9th Grade!	If you took it you would know Congress never sent Trump a Bill!	This is the SenateShutdown because McConnell doesn’t have 60 votes and Schumer needs 67 to get a Spending Bill through!
@WalterAppling @jfediganpgm @AP She’s malignant and obviously mentally ill.  What I wonder about is why so many are in complete denial about it.  Is that how personality cults work?

@TexasLumpy @Scottke59 @ErickFernandez @SenatorCollins Why would Trump want to add to Obama’s Obama’s Vanity Project?	Trump is only adding 200 miles to Obama’s much bigger WALL.
@tartarusorbust @PattyMurray @senatemajldr Democrats are heartless they would rather our nation fail &amp; 800,000 Federal Workers go bankrupttgan fir Trump to succeed!
@TexasLumpy @Scottke59 @ErickFernandez @SenatorCollins I ask my friend who works with CBP. He said Trump wants to add 230 miles of physical barriers that are currently heavily patrolled by Border Patrol agents. 	This will free up resources to more throughly check legal points of entry.	He said it’s like automating part of his job!
@DailyCaller Some Republicans sometimes say racist things that may hurt people’s feelings but Democrats do terribly misguided racist things!	Can any liberal defend the Racist  Clinton’s, Biden’s, KKKByrd’s Legacy the 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act?	https://t.co/Hvg33G8TGB

@chelseahandler @SenCoryGardner @SenDanSullivan @SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorCollins @SenPatRoberts How do you figure?	Democrats need a minimum of 13 Republican Senator votes to pass a Spending Bill and another 7 more to override a Presidential Veto!	Schumer has the same problem as McConnell they need 60 votes!
@chelseahandler Obviously Not nearly as much as the Democratic Leadership!	They encourage girls &amp; women to cross our border illegally knowing 80% will be raped!	https://t.co/8SxnJHxshq
@KYPatriot17 @senatemajldr He knows it will go down 53 to 47!	Best case 50 50 no where near the 60 to pass or 67 to override a Presidential Veto!	Pelosi is in the same position Newt was in with President Clinton!
@TexasLumpy @Scottke59 @ErickFernandez @SenatorCollins For ever DHS or DEA officials Democrats produce saying we don’t need a WALL there are 4 officials that say we do!	I have a neighbor who works for the DHS and another who is an FBI agent they are both strongly for the WALL.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Interesting you would point this out.	I was reading that if the Shutdown goes beyond 30 days the Trump Administration can lay-off those Federal Employees permanently?	I suppose that’s an effective way to use the system to downsize!
@mikeisshocked @SenatorCollins @senatemajldr Civics 9th Grade, All Spending Bills by Senate Rules require 60 votes!	 There were at max 51 Republican Senators the past 2 years.

@tedlieu Congress has wasted over $40 billion and has not sent a Spending Bill to the President!	Over 800,000 Federal workers are not getting paid with the likelihood of them getting paid far off in the future!	Federal Workers ask, if this is not a National Emergency then what is?
@dorianbanks @Alyssa_Milano @MichaelAvenatti That explains a lot...

The votes before Christmas no longer matter the Republican Controlled House sent their Bill to McConnell but McConnell knew he couldn’t get the 9 Democrats needed for Senate rules!
@cynthiagibas @bluenote74 @KamalaHarris @Interior That’s because SchumerShutdown doesn’t have 20 Republican Senators votes to override a Presidential Veto.	The question becomes how much Federal Workers heartache and how many $10’s of Billions will Democrats waste not to extend Obama’s WALL?	We’re over $40 think $100 billion?
@SchmoopyWoopy @KamalaHarris @Interior That’s because a vote would be pointless until Democrats come to their senses or Schumer finds 20 Republican Senators votes to override a Presidential Veto!

@bluenote74 @KamalaHarris @Interior Trump wanted to own the Shutdown but (Civics 9th Grade) Congress never fulfilled their obligations and sent him a Bill to Veto so he could own it!	Until Congress sends a Bill to the President he is merely a spectator/Cheerleader!

@rpj66 @newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Senate rules, Neither McConnell or Schumer had the needed 60 votes to pass a Spending Bill much less the 67 votes needed to over come a Presidential Veto. McConnell rightfully saw taking a pointless vote on either the House Republicans or House Democrats Bill as a waste of time!

@realDonaldTrump President Trump declare an emergency that Congress can’t complete it’s obligation to send a Spending Bill to you to sign &amp; say funding for the WALL is the reason so you will use the military to build the WALL to end the stalemate!

@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr David I see you were on Twitter since 2003 but didn’t see any of your comments about the Obama/Coyote Children Trafficking Ring.	Nothing the Trump Administration is as nearly so bad!	https://t.co/A12Vf3yoTC
The truth is painful to CNN! https://t.co/RqaYqi4mjX
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Explain this discrepancy if Trump is lying!	https://t.co/mKsjPc7Z7z
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr All Republicans feel like hostages &amp; I’m sure all Democrats feel like they are hostage to this situation.	We feel equally strongly that SchumerShutdown &amp; Pelosi are holding a gun to us as you may feel Trump is holding one to you!
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That’s categorically not true!	All Democrats have to do is allow Trump to spend $5.7 billion to add to The Obama/Bush Wall!	As I keep repeating we will by MONDAY wasted over $40 billion not to add the extra miles!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr You say potato I say potato....	Wall, fence, or barrier....	https://t.co/SrTybYaHHy
This expresses my opinion completely! https://t.co/OEqNgkVnfd
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It was built by Obama &amp; more importantly Obama voted for it.	You want to call it the Bush/Obama WALL?	That’s OK with me, it just points out the fact both preceding Presidents thought it was needed.
And he had to double date with Pelosi! https://t.co/rKhBn7xTV4
This is funny! https://t.co/4aOLGTSa64
@Rise1Soar2BFree @LM16612718 Only their wives...
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Oh, so you agree this is a pissing contest that either side can stop?	By MONDAY we will have pissed away over $40 billion to not add 200 miles to Obama’s WALL!	Add that with the sufferings of Federal Workers how much damage should Democrats inflict?
@RepAdamSchiff Congressman are you saying the past two Administrations foreign policies were better with Iraq &amp; the Arab Spring Creating millions of War Refugees?	Are you delusional?	Two simple questions of course the answer to the first tells me the answer to the second!
@SarahPalinUSA We use to eat at Red Lobster once a month that practice just ended!
@SenSchumer The DIRTY DARK SECRET is Democrats can end the SHUTDOWN any time they want!		They will by MONDAY WASTED OVER $40 BILLION to not add 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ miles of WALL!
@KamalaHarris The DIRTY DARK SECRET IS Democrats at this point have the same ability to end this!		By Monday DEMOCRATS will have wasted over $40 billion not to add 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ miles of WALL!		THIS IS THE THE BOTTOM LINE!
@adjunctprofessr @ObamaSpied @POTUS By Monday Democrats will have wasted over $40 billion not to add to Obama’s Wall!

Someone has to ask was the design of ‘Chucky’ done on purpose?	Timing! https://t.co/HqeGg1HHot
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr So adding 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ mile WALL IS A TRUMP VANITY PROJECT?	Filling in the holes makes this all of a Sudden Immoral?	Democrats are propagandist!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That’s propaganda that Joseph Goebbels would have been proud of!	The bottom line Trump wanted to add 200 miles to Obama’s Grand Immoral Pelosi WALL!	Which is already 700+ miles long!	And not adding the $5 billion has already cost the taxpayers over $40 billion come Monday!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Has SchumerShutdown gotten 19 Republican Senators votes?
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr That’s because he Can’t get 8 Democrat Senators votes &amp; Schumershutdown can’t get 19 Republican  Senators votes to pass a Spending Bill.	I guess it’s a SenateShutdown!
@jeremyburroughs @JohnSmi04264866 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Timing!	He started the Shutdown when he still had control of the House.	He’s actually got better numbers in the Senate!
@PaceTheRage @LindseyGrahamSC That’s because Democrats by Monday will have wasted over $40billion with a 24 day shutdown and the waste continues to not add to Obama’s Wall!So unless you are for Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal Maid&amp;Lawn Service that hurts our minorities more you are un-loyal?	Twisted!
@BaconJoel @LindseyGrahamSC If that’s treason what would you call this? 	A soon emerging nuclear power that will threaten us &amp; this moron gave them the money to build them!	https://t.co/lBGicUg7hC
@LindseyGrahamSC Based on Senator Jeff Merkley’s calculation Democrats will have wasted over $40 billion come Monday to not extend Obama’s 700 + mile WALL by another 200 miles which would have cost only a little over $5 billion!	That’s MONEY that could have built almost 8 WALLS!	So far!
@Acosta Is there an IQ minimum to work at CNN!
@senatemajldr Democrats have wasted over $30 billion to not spend $5 billion to add to Obama’s Immoral WALL!
@watspn1013 Navarro wants her Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Steve Cortes problems are not hers!	Ana Navarro would have been a Banana Plantation Owner with plenty of slaves in a different era!
@ScottPresler @EOLeinberger So what’s your point?	Do you really think Democrats are going to let Republicans get between them &amp; their Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service?	Hell, they fought a Civil War to keep their Cheap Exploited Slaves before!
@marpatco @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump $30 billion wasted to not add to Obama’s 700+ miles of WALL!
@Friendlygiant20 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You might have a different opinion if you were a Federal Worker!
@jeremyburroughs @JohnSmi04264866 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Civics 9th Grade. Republicans had to get 60 Senator votes, They only had 51.
@Judith59921252 @JohnSmi04264866 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You realize the Shutdown has already cost taxpayers over $30 billion not to extend Obama’s WALL?	Yes, Obama put up over 700 miles!	Trump wants to add 200 more.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You understand that BLADE CUTS BOTH WAYS?		Americans should not have to be concerned about whether the food they’re feeding to their kids and their families is safe just because Democrats shut down the government.	 	It. Is. Time. To. Re-open. The. Government. Now.
@Acosta Jim I think you are missing the whole point!

@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump @wef You know after wasting over $30 billion not to add 200 miles to Obama’s WALL I think both sides should be ashamed!
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump @wef He meant Mexican Cartels would pay!
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump @wef We learned that lesson from Harry Reid!
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @wef It became the PelosiSchumerShutdown when Democrats wasted $20 billion to prevent Trump from adding 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ miles Wall which cost only $5 billion!
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @wef Because of Democrats desire to stop Trump they have wasted over $30 billion to stop a $5 billion extension to Obama’s WALL!	Why wasn’t it racist or immoral when Obama was building it?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @wef Trump wants to add 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ miles WALL!	What’s racist is Democrats desire for Cheap Exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	If Democrats weren’t racist they wouldn’t be fighting for Exploited Illegal labor but for more legal immigration!
@KGalliah @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Which could end up in another Civil War where Republicans fight Democrats desire to have cheap exploitable Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service! https://t.co/WrzES2VQPM
@NormDeploom @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It was improving but if you look at any data they mysteriously stop at 2016!	Things have gotten significantly worse the last year &amp; 1/2!
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr At what point is it the The Government is responsible for wasting an estimated $1.7 billion a day?	How much money should be wasted in this pissing contest becomes the question?	Any answers, $50 billion, $100 billion, $200 billion!	And all the sufferings of Federal Workers?
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr How is adding 200 miles to Obama’s 700+ miles a monument to Trump?
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Not the current Congress!	None so far!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Trump has negotiated for the last two years with Democrats giving no ground.
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Valid point!	All Democrats have to do is come up with 20 Republican Senators votes to override him!	I don’t see this happening!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Trump has no power other than sign or veto a Spending Bill!	I’ve not read where Trump vetoed a Spending Bill the Democrats sent him!	Until Congress sends Trump a Bill requiring 60 votes in the Senate, it by Definition from the Constitution can’t be a TrumpShutdown!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr The DEA has collected enough money from the Mexican Cartels to build the 200 more miles to add to the Obama 700+ miles of WALL!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Simple math problem is the Federal workers &amp; the Federal Budget in better shape because Democrats didn’t want to build a $5 billion wall?	The Shutdown has already wasted over $30 billion with this number increasing by about $1.7 billion a day!
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Trump has been patient for 2 years.
@HeathenOnEarth_ @1DavidMalcolm @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr For two years Trump has wanted to add 200 miles to the Bush/Obama wall but was blocked by Senate Rules!	Democrats have already wasted over $30 billion to not add to the 700+ existing miles!	Federal workers will be waiting a while before Democrats come to their senses!
@1DavidMalcolm @HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Ok David, let’s say the 200 miles of additional WALL Trump wants is a waste after Obama’s 700+ miles of WALL!	The Shutdown has already wasted over $30 billion to not build 200 miles of more WALL!	Does this make sense?
@RWPUSA Government spending?	The Democrats Shutdown has wasted over $30 billion to stop 200 more miles of WALL!	Obama built over 700 miles of immoral WALL!	It became the Democrats Shutdown after the first $20 billion!
@SpeakerPelosi Obama built over 700 miles of walls &amp; fences all Trump wants to do is build 200 more?	How was Obama’s 700 not immoral but Trump’s 200 miles is?

@marklevinshow Caricature News Network!	We stopped watching SNL because it was to predictable.
@tedlieu So the Wall is ineffective for Israel?	You’re saying Jews are stupid?	I think your analysis is wrong...	But you know what stupid is?	Wasting over $30 billion to not build a $5 billion wall!	But Stupid is politically incorrect should we use the term Mathematically Challenged?
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Senator by your own estimates this SchumerShutdown has wasted over $30 billion not to build a $5 billion wall!	The question becomes are all Democrats mathematically challenged or just the Leadership?
@r_mxsrr01 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Good point!	Another investigation but I suggest we investigate why the Democratic Leadership is protecting Mexican Cartels Human Trafficking &amp; Illegal Drug Smuggling Routes?	We know the Mexican Cartels have bribed many Mexican officials why not ours?
@ImaWorldWatcher @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Democrats have already wasted $30 billion not to build a $5 billion wall.	That’s the bottom line!	St this point it doesn’t matter if the Wall is a waste or not....

@HeathenOnEarth_ @jerryjr52171 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr It’s going to be a long cold winter for Federal Workers but not nearly as cold as your heart!	Democrats have already wasted $30 billion on this SchumerShutdown not to build a $5 WALL!
@brblwh @SenSchumer @senatemajldr You understand the hardship this causes Federal Workers and that Democrats have already wasted over $30 billion to not build a $5 billion wall!	Personal question, are all Democrats mathematically challenged?
@SJDoubleYeah @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Schumer is in the same boat McConnell is in he Doesn’t have 60 votes!	McConnell is closer to having 60 votes than SchumerShutdown!
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Senator, in 20 days of a SchumerShutdown you have wasted over $30 billion not to build a $5 billion WALL!	Is this how Democrats save money?
@JHShattu @CNN @KamalaHarris Read your Constitution!	Trump never vetoed any Spending Bill until Congress gets their Act together like it or not it’s Congresses ShutDown. I just think the SchumerShutdown has a better ring than the PelosiSchumerMcConnellShutdown!
@CNN @KamalaHarris It take two sides to have a fight!	Democrats rational is the WALL is a waste of money!	The SchumerShutdown has already wasted over $30 billion to stop a $5  billion WALL!	The 800,000 are as much a Democrats issue as it is a Trump issue!

@RBReich I was reading the Constitution something I recommend, especially recommend for lawyers, Trump never got a chance to SchumerShutdown the Government.	You could even call it the McConnellSchumerShutdown.	But what it’s not is the TrumpShutdown.

@HighPope_Brun @vwbuglvr @tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump If you are not better under the Trump economy versus the Obama economy you are a true loser!
@tedlieu @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Bottom line everyday the Government is shut down you people in Washington waste about $1.7 billion!	Currently all you clowns have wasted over $30 billion to not build a $5 billion wall!	On what planet does it make sense to waste $30 billion?

@andewanderer @realDonaldTrump That started under Obama, you know the low paid part time service job economy but Trump is bringing back high paid manufacturing jobs that Obama said were gone forever!	https://t.co/NsRQnrZFoh
@caymanisland75 @realDonaldTrump Valid point!	Trump used his magic wand and brought back those jobs Obama said were gone forever!
@tim_tcouch1 @MittRomney Valid point!
@DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Are you saying the Democrats are willing to waste $ trillions of $ to save $5 billion?	Are all Democrats mathematically challenged?
@Melissa94432101 @realDonaldTrump The magic number is you need is 21 Republican Senators that’s up 3 you guys are going the wrong direction!
@RepSarbanes @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi The Bill, HR 1, will do more harm than good if we don’t break up the monopoly of the MSM!	Unfortunately we no longer have a Free Press!	Our Press is bought &amp; paid for!	https://t.co/WKf0IChRnj
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats I’ll support HR1 as long as it has a provision to break up the MSM.	90% of our news is Controlled by just 6 entities!	Citizens United was a ruling to reduce the monopoly these 6 corporations have on our government!
@SenSchumer Yes, let’s stop wasting almost $2 billion a day to save $5 billion...	Let’s stop playing politics!	At this point the cost of the Wall has become trivial!
@RWPUSA @CNNPolitics I think they are laying the groundwork for another Civil War, first you dehumanize the other side...	Glad I’m on the side with the most guns...
@Julie19921823 @SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Will give new meaning to the term “Wetback”!
@_dlh52 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mexican Cartels have already donated to the DEA enough to build the Wall!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator the Congress has already wasted $25 billion because of the SchumerShutdown?	The question becomes how many $10’s of billions will Democrats waste to save $5 billion!	I Wish liberals could understand the concept of counting!
@CNNPolitics To think it only took the Democrats threat to waste $billions upon $billions to supposedly save $5 billion!	Spend thrift Democrats have already wasted over $20 billion with that number increasing everyday!
@1776Stonewall Their spouses?
@FigZayas @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Read my bio....
@realDonaldTrump Finally a President that cares about Fair Trade instead of using our Jobs for political bargaining chips!
@WhiteHawkRaven @boo_dady @WilliamDavidBe4 @krtmd @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Rpasangel he’s own over 500 businesses!	He’s goes 7 using bankruptcy.
@WhiteHawkRaven @boo_dady @WilliamDavidBe4 @krtmd @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump I think Jerome Powell thinks the economy is sound despite Pelosi &amp; Schumer’s best efforts with the SchumerShutdown.
@FigZayas @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr That’s fair.	My expectations for leftist has gone down over the years also.
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Actually it’s Huffington Post..	That bastion of Conservative thought!	https://t.co/8SxnJHfQSQ
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Tge Democratic Leadership knows the numbers know the outcomes 80% of the time but defend illegal immigration!
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Think of a system with no chain of custody, with same day registration and tell me how do you get fair elections, a fair count of legal votes!	It’s because of this perversion of the electoral process we have the Electoral College!	In places we had greater than100% participation!
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Then (and no liberal had ever tried)	Explain why Democrats are encouraging Mass Rape for political gain?
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr In Hollywood how many Republicans got caught up in the MeToo movement?
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Bottom line McConnell needs 7 Democrats votes or Schumer needs 20 Republican votes to get the Government moving again.
@FigZayas @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr I actually think your reasoning is warped.	No offense, I know it’s not your fault so many years of MSM brainwashing....
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr JC if you lived in CA &amp; witness the ballot harvesting here you would have a different opinion, unless of course you were a hypocrite...	Not calling you one just saying...
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr That’s because Democrats in their self serving sadistic misogynistic way are sending signals of encouragement to those people wanting a better life at the expense of our minorities!	When Trump was first elected Illegal border crossing dropped dramatically but Democrats fix that!
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Capitalism is not an evil word and is not synonymous to exploitation!
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr JC check your Civics Book Trump has never gotten a Bill to sign or Veto!	Until Congress gets a Bill in front of the President it’s their Shutdown!	Call it the McConnellSchumerShutdown!
@WhiteHawkRaven @boo_dady @WilliamDavidBe4 @krtmd @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Are you a Chinese Troll defending China’s high protective tariff?	I just invested $35,000 yesterday in the stock market.	I think we will get through the Pelosi correction. Noticed the stock market was doing good until Wall Street realized the Democrats would regain the House! https://t.co/uFY9gx3A9B
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr The whole point of the Wall is to discourage people from attempting to cross the border illegally!	JC why do you want to encourage people to make this crossing knowing over 10,000 have lost their lives and 80% of the girls &amp; women will be raped?	https://t.co/8SxnJHfQSQ
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr My family &amp; I help out in Shelters for the Marginally Housed.	I’ve seen &amp; talk to people who were just making ends meet and lose their jobs to cheaper exploitable Illegal immigration labor.	My wife &amp; daughters talk to girls who were raped making the illegal crossing. It’s bad.
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr So JC one question give me an amount the Democrats should waste on this SchumerShutdown to save $5 billion for the Wall?	$100 billion, a $ trillion, a Depression?	Pick a number we are already over $20 billion.
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr I don’t have to I read history and Joseph Goebbels propaganda doesn’t work on me!	Walls were effective in War until the invention of cannons to knock Walls down! If Illegal Aliens use cannons we have a different problem!	The Wall in San Diego stopped the caravan.	That’s thinking.
@4RANDALL1 @RichardCHendry2 Here’s an idea.	A Republican needs to introduce a Bill paying Reparations to Blacks &amp; the poor who suffered under the Clinton’s,Biden’s,the Evil Genus KKKByrd’s, &amp; Democrats Legacy the Racist targeting Blacks 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act!	https://t.co/NkU9PDktbA
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr The point is the Government Shutdown is going to last a long time!	SchumerShutdown has to get 20 Republican Senators to override a Trump Veto!	But then again SchumerShutdown would rather the U.S. go into a Depression than Trump get the Wall!	Democrats don’t care about you!
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr I’ve never seen a big amusement park like Disney, Six Flags, without one.	Say for argument sake the Wall is a bad idea. Democrats have already wasted the money in the SchumerShutdown to build 5 of Walls!
@SteveScalise @dr_palazzolo @realDonaldTrump Most of them?
@jgcarey80 @boldredbull @SusanKFuller1 @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Wall work both ways.
@boo_dady @WilliamDavidBe4 @WhiteHawkRaven @krtmd @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump No what would have been sad would have been electing another Globalist as a President!	We dodged a bullet in 2016!
@jgcarey80 @SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr We’ve already collected the money to pay for almost 3 Walls from Mexico!	Senator Cruz has introduced a Bill to redirect that money to fund the Wall!	Have another argument?	https://t.co/F5QlJ76pmY
@SusanKFuller1 @boldredbull @RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr Ok semantics! TrumpShutdown SchumerShutdown who cares the bottom line is everyday the Government is Shutdown we wasted almost another $2 billion Trump could have built 4 Walls with the money the Democrats have wasted so far to save $5 billion!
@SusanKFuller1 @krtmd @senatemajldr Susan why do you support MASS RAPE?	4 out of 5 girls &amp; women who cross our borders illegally become new MeToo victims!	80% are raped!	Why encourage Mass Rape?	https://t.co/8SxnJHfQSQ
@SandraTXAS 4 out of 5 girls &amp; women are MeToo victims and are raped attempting to cross the border illegally!	You have to be a terrible sadistic misogynistic person to encourage this!	Why would Democrat’s be so heavily invested in supporting MASS RAPE?	https://t.co/8SxnJHfQSQ
@RWPUSA You mean like last week?	https://t.co/gLmtfzwB1t
@RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr The Democrats reasoning for being against the Wall was it’s a waste of money. 	Currently they have wasted over $20 billion to save $5 billion with the cost rising by almost $2 billion a day!	How much is fighting the Wall worth wasting!
@RobRubright @krtmd @senatemajldr I stand corrected!	Thank you.
@robjh1 I think this is her Dukakis moment.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Speaker of the House Pelosi,I often disagree with your politics but I have read many of the negative profanity laced comments directed at you and as a Conservative I find them appalling!	The question remains how many $billions are you prepared to waste to stop the $5billion Wall?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump To some a simple campaign promise matters.
@JonCope4 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump What no reply???
@krtmd @senatemajldr Doesn’t count, all Appropriation Bills must originate in the House.	This is going to be a record SchumerShutdown!	It became the SchumerShutdown about $17 billion ago!	We are fast approaching the $25 billion mark of wasted money to save $5 billion for a Wall!
@JudgeJeanine What would you expect of Democrats they encourages mass rape of girls &amp; women on our southern border, roots for Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service and was the Party of 100:1 sentencing disparities that targeted Blacks!	If they didn’t have the MSM....
@Lisa4839 @amaralantis @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump But we’re not all Democrats but mostly Federal workers are.
@deplorablem1ke @smalltownandrew Heck I’ll be 122!	I suppose asking him the meaning of life would be pointless for me st that point.
@SenSchumer I may disagree with your politics but this is a point of agreement.
@WalterAppling @realDonaldTrump Look, Trump put a big monkey wrench in the Globalist Plans!	90% of the news we get comes from just 6 news organizations!	We haven’t had a Free Press in decades!	It’s all bought and paid for by the Globalist!	https://t.co/cLkL1IZrv7
@Lisa4839 @amaralantis @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump How is SchumerShutdown going to get the needed 20 Republican votes to override a Presidential Veto?	Or do you enjoy the worrying &amp; suffering Mostly Democratic Federal workers are having to endure!
@amaralantis @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Funny thing is in the past 12 days SchumerShutdown has already wasted over $20 billion!	It became the SchumerShutdown when the price went over $5 billion!
@DebbieLew60 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Are you saying Schumer had a plan?	Democrats have already wasted over $20 billion assuming the $5 billion is a waste of money though I disagree, the question to you Debra becomes how much pain for our Federal workers &amp; how many $ billions are you willing to waste?
@maryroach @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump maryroach wants to protect either the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes or mass rape of children &amp; women!	Unfounded can’t claim ignorance any longer.	Which is it?	https://t.co/8SxnJHfQSQ
@JohnHart7217 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We’ve already wasted with this Government SchumerShutdown over $20 billion to save $5 billion!	The question becomes how does SchumerShutdown get 20 Republican Senators to vote with him to override a Presidential Veto?
@DVOnAZ @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Maybe Mexican Cartels bribe money!	We’ve already confiscated enough Mexican Cartels money to pay for 3 Walls!	https://t.co/vahfAkykT9
@ErocWolverine @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That’s why Civics should be taught in the 12 Grade not the 9th.	If it were you would possibly know the budget must get 60 votes in the Senate to pass currently Republicans need 7 Democrat votes! Or Democrats need 20 Republican votes to override a Presidential Veto!
@sandypie38 @fbecke @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Point 1 the Mexican Cartels have already had enough money taken away from them to pay for the Wall.	Point 2 Democrats have already wasted per Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley over $20 billion to save $5 billion!	Is this smart how many billions should we waste?
@fbecke @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Democrats have already wasted over $20 billion per Senator Merkley to save $5 billion!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator your job is to secure enough Republican votes to override a Presidential Veto or the Government becomes the SchumerShutdown!	You’ve already wasted per Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley over $20 billion to save $5billion!		By my count that’s 20 Republican Senators votes!
@WalterAppling @realDonaldTrump That’s the problem with MSM they purposely take Trump to literal.	To say he is lying. No past President has been held to this level of scrutiny per the Harvard School of Journalism.
@BreSta7 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump It became the SchumerShutdown after he  wasted more than  $20 billion to save $5 billion!	Democrats can no longer make the argument the $5 billion would be wasted after wasting over $20 billion to stop it!
@DDaley51 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump I think you may regret posting this.	You have the wrong President &amp; Administration.	It was the Obama Administration that aided &amp; abetted kidnapping &amp; Trafficking of Children.	https://t.co/A12Vf3yoTC
@KVWUPPfromIoff @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Let’s for argument sake say that is true, Trump has no sense of responsibility,is it worth the hardship &amp; over $20 billion &amp; climbing all ready wasted to save $5 billion?
@JonCope4 @SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump And protection of the Mexican Cartels &amp; encouragement of mass rape of children &amp; women makes them feel important.	The question becomes do you approve?	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Playing politics Senator?	The whole point was for Democrats to save what they thought was $5 billion on the Wall but The SchumerShutdown has already cost by your own estimation over $20billion!	And for what?	To protect the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes or is it the mass rape?
@ronaldm85467531 @NPR Sarcasm often doesn’t work!	Be careful...
@DustySunbeam @NPR The discouraging of Mass Rape of 80% of the girls &amp; women who attempt crossing the border illegally is Un-American?	People who encourage this behavior are either very ignorant I&amp; stupid or sadistic &amp; misogynistic!!	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@AmyLarimer1 @NPR That blade cuts both ways!	I can’t understand the stupidity of those supporting &amp; encouraging mass rape and the Mexican Cartels!	It’s no longer a matter of ignorance those people are stupid sadistic misogynists! A Wall would deter girls from this crossing 	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@sheriemary @NPR Mexican Cartels should not have their Smuggling Routes interfered with?
@NPR The Mexican Cartels are very dangerous!	The question becomes why is our Democratic Leadership fighting so hard to protect the Mexican Cartels Smuggling Routes, is it fear or bribery?
@The_Trump_Train More importantly don’t let anyone tell you we have a Free Press!	Ours is bought &amp; paid for!	https://t.co/cLkL1IZrv7
@SenSanders Finally a point of agreement when do we start re-geo-engineering the planet?	We have been geo-engineering the planet with fossil fuels for over a century!
@realDonaldTrump More importantly the Democrats have once again proven they are the Sadistic Misogynistic Anti-Female Party encouraging mass Rape of children &amp; women knowing 80% will suffer this fate!	My liberal friends how do you defend this!	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@RyanAFournier We all know you can’t be a Democrat &amp; not be a hypocrite the same can be said about MSM but that would be redundant.

@surveyfan @zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube Valid point.
@753112jma @zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube You never answer the question why you encourage &amp; support mass rape?	Unfortunately you can no longer claim ignorance.	Democrats will do anything to protect their Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service! Their wage Stagnation hedge against inflation.
@753112jma @zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube Facts are hard to deal with...
@Q86Dee @zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube Remember your 9th Civics, Same rules apply needing 60 votes, McConnell needs SchumerShutdown Democrats votes!
@753112jma @zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube Curious how many Billions is it worth to protect the Mexican Cartels &amp; Sex Trade?	80% of all girls &amp; women will be raped attempting to cross our borders illegally?	I know why the Dem. Leadership encourages this but Why do you encourage this?	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@zivinilee @ChuckGrassley @YouTube Come January it becomes the SchumerShutdown!	Trump’s Wall cost $5 billion but the Democrats have already wasted over $20 billion to make a point.
@Lorie945 @ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump This may have started as the TrumpShutdown but as soon as the price tag went over the $5 billion mark which the Democrats claimed was their reason to oppose the Wall (Common sense, who spends in excess of $20 billion to save $5 billion?) It’s now the SchumerShutdown!
@agcia87 @WalterAppling @AlenaSatoshi @realDonaldTrump I think they are called steel &amp; aluminum tariffs!
@WalterAppling @AlenaSatoshi @realDonaldTrump Hidden in the steel &amp; aluminum tariffs.
@WalterAppling @realDonaldTrump The point is Mexico has already paid enough money for several of Trump’s Walls.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I suspect it’s a matter of manipulation of the data to get the numbers one wants.	The BOP (Federal Bureau of Prisons) gives a different representation of the numbers,	https://t.co/7oXnwa39Qa

@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Does it matter at this point who’s Shutdown it is if the goal was to stop Trump from wasting $5 billion?	We have already wasted over $20billion to save $5 billion with that total climbing everyday!
@bigleaguepol Trump wants $5 billion for a Wall Democrats say it’s a waste of money and to prove their point they will waste $12 billion a week to stop this waste!	Democrats, not only are Hypocrites they are mathematically challenged!	It’s politically incorrect to call them stupid....

@akaANonEMouse @MLeoCooper1 @NPR That debate has been put off for immigration reform for over 20 years now because of its usefulness as a tool to stop inflation. Left to the Democrats &amp; RINOS we will never really address it!
@SenJeffMerkley Senator assuming the Wall is a waste, Exactly how much money are Democrats going to waste to save $5 billion?
@KamalaHarris If the ACA is such a good deal, HealthCare Insurance Companies shouldn’t be such fans of it!
@MLeoCooper1 @NPR I think during the Reagan years we had a change in the Republican Party. Remember the scary monster was inflation. Cheap Exploited Illegal labor became the answer to put downward pressure on wages to keep inflation in check. This philosophy gave us the Bush’s &amp; Clinton’s.
@MLeoCooper1 @NPR RINOS &amp; Democrats figured out this cheap Exploited labor was good to keep inflation low through wage Stagnation. NAFTA was specifically designed to create a large pool of illegal labor when our large corporate farms dumped corn into Mexico!	We left poor Mexican farmers 3 choices!
@MLeoCooper1 @NPR Many of our small competitors use cheap exploitable Illegal labor to run their businesses. Cheap Exploited Illegal labor is the chief cause of wage Stagnation &amp; increase income inequality. 	As for RINOS they are a relatively new breed of Republicans call them Globalist.
@JohnCornyn Senator is it a prerequisite for Democrats to be mathematically challenged?	You’ve already wasted a minimum of $25 billion to save $5 billion for a Wall!	Democrats will spend as much as needed to protect their 21st Century answer to Slavery, Cheap Exploited Illegal Labor!
@western_meadow @GrumpAdam @NPR Don’t have to we already have the money!	https://t.co/2yNyDqBvlf
@MLeoCooper1 @NPR I respectfully disagree.This issue of border security caused by Democrats &amp; RINOS passage of NAFTA&amp;CAFTAneeds a permanent solution.We have become to dependent on Cheap Exploited usually Lighter Skin Illegal Maid, Cooking,&amp;Lawn Service .It keeps inflation low thru wage Stagnation
@GrumpAdam @western_meadow @NPR The Mexican Cartels have already had enough money taken away to pay for the Wall! 	It’s now a matter of getting the money appropriated.	Senator Cruz has already written a Bill.

@BlueSea1964 @KNP2BP So Democrats need 20 Republicans to vote to convict both with the Agnew model established where they only needed 10 Republicans?	If Howard Dean thinks this is possible or likely he needs to check himself into to a psychiatric facility. 	This is reality.
@RWPUSA Richard do you want Trump &amp; his family members raped while they are in prison?	I mean you &amp; Democrats encourage girls &amp; women to cross our border illegally knowing 80% will be raped!	Here’s another question, is Sadistic Misogynistic Democrats redundant?	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@Lowcountry1Girl Bottom line. 	The shutdown cost $12 billion a week!	80% of the girls &amp; women attempting to cross the border illegally are raped!	Only sadistic misogynistic Democrats would encourage girls to make the attempt!	Here’s the question, is Sadistic misogynistic Democrats redundant?
@AlbernalNissan They are fun at traffic like lights being the first at 45mph...
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Congressman Swalwell the Shutdown be it the TrumpShutdown or the SchumerShutdown cost ~ $12 billion a week!	All this political jockeying all this pain &amp; misery for $5 billion or 0.1% of the Federal Budget?	Congressman are you proud of the failure you guys collectively are?
@NBCNews I’m appalled at all the Democratic sadistic misogynists encouraging girls &amp; women to cross our border illegally knowing 80% of all girls &amp; women will be raped attempting the crossing!	Can any of you leftist defend this?	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, please ask the Democratic Leadership why they are such sadistic misogynists?	They know 80% of all girls &amp; women will be raped making this dangerous crossing yet they still encourage this dangerous journey!	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@RWPUSA You’re funnier than SNL!	Getting enough votes to override a Trump Veto because he doesn’t want mass rape!	He wants to discourage this!	And you encourage this?	Richard I like many you can’t claim ignorance!	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@CNNPolitics Yes, let’s encourage mass rape!	80% of women &amp; girls are raped crossing our border illegally!	The question becomes is the average leftist ignorant of this or sadistic misogynists? We know the Democratic Leadership is aware of this which makes them....	https://t.co/AGvwxFUKHD
@CNN Why do Democrats encouraging the crossing of our borders illegally?	The know the coyotes &amp; others will rape 80% of the women &amp; girls and over 10,000 have lost their lives since the 90’s? Is there any wonder that children will lose their lives also?
@GOP That’s because Democrats have discovered ballot harvesting!	Soon to be legal in every Blue State!
@SenSanders Senator Sanders where was your criticism on Twitter when the Obama Administration was partners  in Child Trafficking &amp; Slavery?	You’re proof you  can’t be a Democrat &amp; not a hypocrite.

@phase2phasetit @rodglef @realDonaldTrump We have 1st, 2nd,&amp; 3rd generation workers at our plant and flexible working hours to accommodate them. In 43 years we have never had a lay-off.  Keeping good workers &amp; innovations are the keys to our success!
@CoherenceFan 11 followers? Are you a new Troll?	I actually disagree with the President on this issue. 	The Fed needs to reload and increase interest because the Trump economy is still relatively strong.
@GeoTweetWatcher @LindseyGrahamSC Thank you for the link.
@RWPUSA Richard do you find it poetic justice  the party of Slavery (Democrats) are also the greatest cause of Black deaths today? All to save some inconsistencies for rich White Women.	https://t.co/kDF0NeAe9u
@GeoTweetWatcher @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry posted reply to wrong tweet.	Democrat Senator from Oregon Jeff Merkley. https://t.co/axgnYIXZ6S
@GeoTweetWatcher @LindseyGrahamSC Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley is my source.
@GeoTweetWatcher @LindseyGrahamSC Ok. Let’s say for argument sake President Trump doesn’t understand how Government works.	Please justify to me &amp; Federal workers costing them &amp; the waste of over $12 billion a week to teach Trump not to waste $5 billion how this makes sense.
RT @mitchellvii: Democrats hate America.  Retweet if you agree.
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics From your bio it looks like you are one of those Chinese Trolls...
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics We will see how damaging the Pelosi lead House will be to our economy!
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics There will be some rebalancing but the Farm Lobby has has to much power in Washington for too long. Did you know when NAFTA was signed our huge Corporate farms dumped corn into Mexico destroying the livelihoods of millions of Mexican farmers?	Forcing them to cross illegally.
@GeoTweetWatcher @LindseyGrahamSC It’s your tax payer dollars being wasted too!	Assuming you work and pay taxes...
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics Jeanne a point of agreement!	For ever 10 high paid manufacturing jobs they create 31 additional higher paying service jobs!	It’s the multiplier effect!	https://t.co/0zAKN9SBFe
@rodglef @realDonaldTrump You must have one of those Obama lie paid service jobs or work for the Government!	If you had a high paying manufacturing job with more overtime than you want you would have a different perspective!	https://t.co/4TcpDvMDK7
@thisisphild @Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump And we on the right will show up with our guns!
@bdeame @realDonaldTrump Say for argument sake the Wall is a waste of money. Per a tweet from Senator Merkley the 2013 shutdown cost $12 billion a week!	How can Democrat’s justify to Federal Workers Spending a minimum of $20 billion to save $5 billion?	How much money do you think Democrats should waste?
@Midnighter65 @realDonaldTrump Getting an endorsement from the dying Time Magazine is like getting an honorary degree from some High School.
@teacherdude @realDonaldTrump Well that works with Democrats &amp; RINOS in charge but not with President Trump!	Trump gas help create 400,000 high paying manufacturing jobs that President Obama said were gone forever!	https://t.co/4TcpDvMDK7
@DreAdams1 @realDonaldTrump President Obama had nothing to do with the +400,000 gain in high paying manufacturing jobs!	President Obama said those jobs were gone forever &amp; would require a Magic Wand to bring back!	https://t.co/4TcpDvMDK7
@WilDonnelly @realDonaldTrump Well considering most every economist was expecting a recession after the 2016 elections with it being much worse if Trump was elected I think we have done very well!	https://t.co/P1HT0DmMGZ
@reasonablelady @realDonaldTrump You’re one of the few exceptions.
@watspn1013 Most of us think of America as a country, Democrats think of it more in terms of a Plantation and how to get as many depended Slaves as possible.
@KamalaHarris Senator you should work with President Trump!	He has been a Godsend to us manufacturing workers in CA.	He helped bring back those jobs President Obama said were gone forever!	No, seriously, he did it!	&amp; you should read this!	https://t.co/4TcpDvMDK7
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator Schumer per a Tweet left by Senator Merkley the 2013 Shutdown cost about $12 billion a week!	This Shutdown will cost a minimum of $20 billion if you get it fixed Monday!	How do you justify to Federal Workers wasting $20 billion to save $5 billion?
@mitchellvii A better fight would have been Joe Fraser &amp; Mike Tyson.
@KamalaHarris Talk about useless, per Senator Jeff Merkley the 2013 shutdown cost $12 billion per week!	We are in our 2 week with no end in site!	Democrats will have cost us a minimum of $20 billion to save $5 billion!	Is this smart?
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics Over 400,000 new high paying manufacturing jobs in less than 15 months!	The article was specific to high paying manufacturing jobs.
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics Are you a bot?
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics No, painstakingly customized for you!
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics No, I actually work in manufacturing.	It gives me a unique window in world trade. We buy machinery from Europe the tariff is 2.5%. When we ship product to the E.U. they charge us 10%!	China use to charge us 25%!	As I said a unique perspective.
@TheNoahRing It’s about controlling population growth of poor minorities!	Baby turtles are endangered!		This saves future money of not having to support the lower class!		The perfect leftist solution!

@bbusa617 Well she packs her own strap-on...
@itsSandraDee Open.	Obama’s plan for us to become a service Economy was a mistake for Britain &amp; would be a mistake for the U.S.A.Despite our high employment &amp; environmental cost in operating in California we survive &amp; thrive through innovation.	Obama shouldn’t have given up on America workers!
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC I was late to the Trump Train, I actually voted for Bernie in the primary here in California.	I was voting to stop the Globalist World wrecking Clinton’s, Bush’s, &amp; Obama.
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC I’ve seen repeated force migration caused by NAFTA &amp; CAFTA!	The Globalist Wall Street elite is destroying nations.	Trump is the first a President to buck this trend.	This world wide redistribution of wealth comes at a price of destroying industrial nations middle class.
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC The leftist are the easiest pawns.	I helped out at shelters for the marginally housed. I’ve seen the suffering first hand. Much of it caused by how Dems. turned the War on Drugs to the War on Blacks with the Racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act.
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC I was checking my post I didn’t find any of the seven words banned by the FCC except where I quote someone.
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC Sometimes you get drugged down into the cutter!	Can you justify spending wasting the $2 billion a day?
@AnnMeganHurley @itsSandraDee @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC What makes you say that?
@JamesMSama @realDonaldTrump Holy shit. Have you no compassion, man? Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid, Cook, Lawn Service &amp; Labor hurts our minorities disproportionately more causes wage Stagnation, income inequality, &amp; is the tool of the Globalist Wall Street elite!	Can’t you see?
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics That’s to be expected after the Democrats regained the House.	Wall Street knows the Democrats would rather the U.S. would go into a Depression than for Trump to be successful! https://t.co/GWv2Adk7KC

@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics Well our manufacturing plant is booked 6 months out!
@Jeanne00055608 @CNNPolitics Did you not bother to read the articles or are you only semi-literate?	At the manufacturing plant I work at the average salary for the first year employees under Obama was less than $30,000/yr. Under Trump it’s over $50,000 with lots of overtime!
@Goblue0010 @AshcroftGloria @CNNPolitics If you worked in manufacturing you would have a different opinion!	We haven’t had it this good since NAFTA went into effect!	https://t.co/EoYeGtvga7

@ThosChamberlain @CNNPolitics Yes, the same poll that gave us a President Hillary!
@david3hart3 @CNNPolitics The U.S. became the largest economic power in the World behind protective tariffs!	China followed this example with their 25% protective tariffs and surpassed us as a manufacturing power!	These points are beyond dispute!
@philcs333 @CNNPolitics Yea, 7 bankruptcy’s out of over 500 businesses!
@CNNPolitics The TPP was a bad deal for manufacturing in the U.S.!	Look how manufacturing improved after Trump was elected!	Fair trade is the magic wand to bring back those jobs Obama sAid were gone forever! This was no accident or caused by Obama!	 https://t.co/EoYeGtvga7
@RWPUSA @VictorBlackwell @NewDay CNN &amp; the MSM are to fairness what the guillotine is to life support!
@GOP Why are Democrats so protective of Mexican Cartels Illegal Drug Smuggling Routes?	Are they worried it will effect their base?
@MPhillpotts @SenMarkey I suppose you are arguing the Democrats are fighting for their illegal drug using base by defending Mexican Cartels Illegal Drug Smuggling Routes.
@OneManCast346 @EvonS777 @LindseyGrahamSC Agreed!	But the a Democrats have no problem with wasting almost $2 billion a day to save $5 billion.
@KathleenHawk4 @EvonS777 @OccupySD Trump’s Veto power will be unaffected!
@4TLove229 @EvonS777 @ReneeCarrollAZ He has distanced himself from the party of Slavery, they want to maintain their supply of cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid, Cook, &amp; Lawn Service!	Exploited illegal labor is the Democrats 21st Century answer to Slavery!
@cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo What does the T stand for?
@itsSandraDee @AnnMeganHurley @leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC I thought Twitter was suppose to be something more than a vehicle for name calling.
@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump Walter, are you saying Trump is wrong &amp; we should just learn to live with China’s Unfair Trade Practices?
@DFBHarvard The Obama Shutdown in 2013 cost the American tax payer over $24 billion!	Today that’s almost $2 billion a day to save $5 billion!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump The Government shutdown cost nearly $2 billion a day!	Congressman how much money do you plan to waste to save $5 billion $20-100 billion?
@politico Some RINOS may feel that way.	The bottom line is the shutdown cost almost $2 billion a day!	How much money will Democrats spend to save $5 billion?	This is an example of socialist math!
@John_KissMyBot Socialist logic!	They will waste almost $2 billion a day to save $5 billion!	Currently Democrats have wasted over $14 billion!	That number will be over $20 billion January 3rd!
@LindseyGrahamSC I’ve read a lot of profanity laced comments by dimwitted leftist!		Understand this, everyday the government is shutdown cost us tax payers almost $2 billion! 		We have already spent well over $12 billion and that number will continue to climb over a messily $5 billion!
@leeleeb50 @LindseyGrahamSC Another limited leftist.
@DamonSparks1 @LindseyGrahamSC Actually it was the Mexican Cartels that paid for the Wall with confiscated drug money!	Senator Cruz is trying to get it to build the Wall.
@RWPUSA Agreed, the Healthcare Insurance had a hearty enthusiastic support for the ACA!	What the Democrats forced down our throats is a rip off!
@NPR The Democratic base is being hurt.
@tedlieu @MarkHarrisNC9 Funny what is election fraud in NC is now standard practice by Democrats in California?	Don’t you feel just a little hypocritical Congressman?
@RWPUSA @WSJ Richard please explain to me a hard working tax payer the logic of the Democrats Spending over $12 billion a week to save $5 billion?	By the 3rd Democrats will have wasted over $20 billion to save $5 billion!	Is this the kind of Socialist Spending logic they have in Venezuelan?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Only socialistic logic would waste over $12 billion a week to save $5 billion!	Democrats are equally to blame &amp; there is no denying this!
@cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo I often help out in shelters for the marginally housed during the Obama years.	Many of my Black friends were there because of two reasons both signed by the Clintons.	#1 was the racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act the other was NAFTA.	See the connection?
@cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo I don’t have a problem with legal immigration or a pathway to citizenship for legal immigrants.	I do have a problem with cheap Exploited Illegal immigration.	A couple of examples most don’t know about; https://t.co/A12Vf3yoTC		https://t.co/nspR4Iu6gH
@SenJeffMerkley Per one of your previous tweets the Shutdown cost the Government over $12 billion a week!	The question becomes how much will hard-working Americans have to pay to save $5 billion?
@JohnCornyn Socialist logic let’s waste over $12 billion a week to save $5 billion!
@Rcrooks1969 @realDonaldTrump Robert, does it matter?	The U.S. is hemorrhaging over $12 billion a week because of the Shutdown!
@mngreen13 @ClariseliCS @realDonaldTrump I think it’s a joint effort but as the cost mounts it becomes harder for Democrats to justify blocking the funding for the a Wall to save money.
@JamieHalls22 @ClariseliCS @realDonaldTrump See Jamie; we’re back to talking about 9th Grade Civics, though this would have been a bonus question.	Because of Senate Rules the Senate needs 60 votes the Republicans only gave 51.

@JamieHalls22 @ClariseliCS @realDonaldTrump Trump never got a Chance to Veto a Spending Bill!	Per your 9th Grade Civics class until Congress sends him a Spending Bill the SchumerShutdown is Congresses, 	Or can’t you remember that long ago?
@mngreen13 @ClariseliCS @realDonaldTrump Per Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon!
@Rcrooks1969 @realDonaldTrump The bottom line this Fake Crisis cost over $12 billion a week to save $5 billion!	I don’t think Pelosi &amp; Schumer have enough RINOS to override a Presidential Veto!	But then again Democrats &amp; RINOS don’t care if the U.S. goes into a Depression as long as they beat Trump! Losers!
@LBGDE13 @realDonaldTrump And Leftist Venezuelan Socialist thinking is it’s better to spend over $12 billion a week to save $5 billion?	Democrats will do anything to protect their source of Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Still the party of Slavery!
@liljbastard @realDonaldTrump Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal labor is the cause of wage Stagnation &amp; increase income inequality! It keeps inflation low &amp; hurts our minorities disproportionately more!	It’s the 21st Century answer to Slavery!	Only the victims are responsible for their transportation!
@ClariseliCS @realDonaldTrump Typical Leftist response!	Would rather the U.S. go into a Depression than for Trump to get his Wall!	Every week the Government is SchumerPelosiShutdown we lose over $12billion!	Only Leftist Venezuelan Socialist thinking could justify spending $12billion a week to save $5billion!
@_mamadeb @realDonaldTrump Border crossing were down early I. 2017 but are up again.
@darenaudsr @realDonaldTrump It has In the form of confiscated Mexican Cartels money.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Each week the Government is shutdown cost over $12 billion!	Our Government is willing to lose how much money to save $5 billion??? 	This is Socialism logic!
@alexazzam40 @GOP @SteveScalise ???
@SarahPalinUSA The 2013 Shutdown cost about $12 billion a week!	That puts the $5 billion in perspective!
@alexazzam40 @GOP @SteveScalise What exactly did Obama do other than send blankets to Ukraine?
@mundyspeaks @BreitbartNews Well the 2013 cost about $12 billion a week!	How much money does Trump want?
@OfficeOfMike @Gene_972 Vacation...
@DailyCaller Jemele Hill is a House Slave on the Democratic Plantation, she can’t help herself it’s sort of like Stockholm syndrome.
@alexazzam40 @GOP @SteveScalise I think with Trump dumping the Intermediate Missile Treaty &amp; Sending Offensive weapons to Ukraine Putin is thinking he was better off with Hillary &amp; Obama!
@SenSchumer The Shutdown cost over $12 billion a week!	Senator how do you justify this over $5 billion?
@SenSchumer The 2013 Shutdown cost taxpayers about $12 billion a week. 	Senator this is no longer about the money!	This is now the SchumerTrumpShutdown!	Next week it will be the SchumerPelosiTrumpShutdown &amp; yours and Nancy responsibly is to get enough Republicans to override a Trump Veto!
@AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews Isn’t that the same poll that predicted Hillary would win the 2016 elections?
@TheRochaSays @realDonaldTrump The ObamaShutdown of 2013 cost about $12 billion a week!	We could have gave Trump money to pay for two walls by now!
@redderthanmost @realDonaldTrump Do you have links of your assertions?	Or is s this Twitter Gossip?
@jnottah @aseegs3 South Carolina tried that in December 1860, it didn’t turn out well!

@mynewline @kdDesertRed @realDonaldTrump SchumerShutdown# never gave Trump a chance to Veto anything. All Schumer and the Senate had to do was send Trump a Spending Bill without the funds for the Wall and see if Trump would Veto it!	Schumer didn’t.
@GloriaSacer @realDonaldTrump No, ever read Benjamin Franklin?
@MelissaOtero @realDonaldTrump I don’t see the votes for a Congressional Veto override.	Do you?
@kdDesertRed @realDonaldTrump Say for argument sake the Wall is ineffective.	Is shutting the Government down for a long period of time worth 0.1% of the total budget?	Are there no adults on the Democrats side?	Or is this simply about politics?	Would the Democrats rather the nation go into a Depression?
@matthew254045 @realDonaldTrump See Blacks unfairly placed in prisons by the Racist Democrats, the Clintons Legacy or manufacturing workers would have a different opinion.
@skypeople63135 @realDonaldTrump There’s a Wall around Disney with cameras.	It’s highly effective.

@JHamBri @realDonaldTrump @kbartness Actually protecting people that didn’t vote for him.
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I hear it’s more expensive in Canada &amp; Australia.
@SenatorMenendez Most Federal employees I’ve ever meet were Democrats!	How many votes did Trump get out of DC?	I think what you call lies is mostly political conditioning. It’s a knee-jerk reaction for you guys!
@SenatorMenendez Day 6 of #SchumerShutdown: I’ve been reading #ShutdownStories from Americans around the country. Coast Guard, TSA,federal law enforcement officers under DOJ,&amp; hundreds of thousands of others are working without pay. Many live paycheck to paycheck and missing one causes real harm.

@marklevinshow I thought CNN was for Caricature News Network the TV actors on CNN once you learn not to take them seriously are funnier than the TV actors on SNL!	SNL is so predictable how’s it possible to keep that funny!
@DaveGreenSays @GOP @GOPChairwoman See Democrats &amp; RINOS have to come up with enough votes to overcome a Presidential Veto.	See we are in a representative republic. Trump’s popularity is a moot point in our form of government as long as Congress can’t come up with enough votes to override a veto.
@boyle_kathy @GOP @GOPChairwoman Do you have links?
@mikefpringle @GOP @GOPChairwoman Yes the Democrats are willing to crash the Government &amp; economy over 0.1% of the Federal Budget!	This Division is not one sided!
@KamalaHarris And we have instead the Schumer Shutdown over 0.1% of the total Federal Budget!	It such a small amount it makes people wonder is it petty politics or something bigger like bribes from the Mexican Cartels or are the Democrats intimidated by the Mexican Cartels?
@RWPUSA That’s not a fair comparison let’s compare Trump with the last three Presidents Obama, Bush, &amp; Clinton.
@GaetaSusan Look, I can’t say anything bad against Democrats!	They somehow resurrected my strong Republican Mom &amp; Dad and got them to vote for Democrats in the last elections!
@The_Trump_Train I bet Michelle has a better jump shot!
@KamalaHarris And remember the Democrats wouldn’t sign a deal because they want to protect the Mexican Cartels!	$5 billion is only 0.11% of the total budget, mathematically a rounding error!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Senator Warren, Democrats shut down the Government over 0.11% of the total Federal Budget because of 	a) petty politics 	b) Mexican Cartels bribes	c) Democrats fear of the Mexican Cartels 	and it’s only Trump’s fault?
@matchracer @CNN We’ll see.
@kjmpalermo @CNN All he’s asking for is $5 billion out of a budget of $4 trillion!	Now I understand why Democrats . are fighting so hard to keep their Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service after all Democrats are the party of long sentences for Blacks &amp; Slavery.
@JohnStr97832612 @CNN $5 billion in terms of the multi trillion budget is a rounding error so your comment from strictly a mathematical point of view should be, “Democratic Leadership playing poker with other people’s livelihoods. Who would have thought?”
@Alyssa_Milano That don’t generally publicize these things in advance.	There’re called War Zones for a reason.
@Montel_Williams @realDonaldTrump Montel if you could think you would understand you don’t want to publicize these things until The President was off the grounding heading home.	They call these places War Zones for a reason....

@mitchellvii @brithume What do you expect Brit is on the Mexican Cartels payroll...
@brithume @JonahNRO Is this about the WALL Brit?	When did you go on the Mexican Cartels payroll?
@brithume But there’s a down side that could have been avoided if 10% of every product sold in a nation was made in that nation. This quick centralization of manufacturing at it lowest labor cost point is not sustainable. That’s why nations like Chins have such high protective tariffs! https://t.co/hrSUTUYB6L
@larryelder The Mexican Cartels have lots of money, it makes one wonder if or how they are using it to influence our MSM along with Democratic Leaders....
@mitchellvii A Tesla...
@freedom_moates If Kasich is running in 2020, The question becomes which party.
Why is it when leftist can’t hold up their end of a discussion they resort to name calling then block you?	Poor weak minded creatures.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I haven’t seen any funding announcement for the Wall so I guess we will have to wait until the Democrats can tell the Mexican Cartels, “Sorry we are going to have the Wall after all and screw up your Smuggling ring.”
@SenJeffMerkley What’s more shocking is Democrats still encourage illegals crossing our border knowing over 10,000 people have lost their lives since the 90’s and 80% of the women &amp; girls will be raped!	That’s s Special kind of sadistic misogynistic behavior for political gain!
@bigleaguepol @MisterB76428978 He sounds like the perfect Democratic Candidate for Trump!
@mark60c Maybe it’s Mexican Cartels bribe money?
RT @Jordan_Sather_: How rude. It’s like the global Cabal doesnt want Trump to succeed, and are weaponizing the Federal Reserve against him…
@tedlieu @davidcicilline @DHSgov Here’s another item to consider, since the 90’s over 10,000 people have lost their lives attempting to cross our border illegally &amp; 80% of the women &amp; girls are raped yet Democrats encourage these crossings, # 1 are Democrats sadists &amp; misogynistic # 2 or do they just not care?
@MisterXtfr @JulianSvendsen @realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Which is your right.	As a manufacturing worker who has seen manufacturing flourish under Trump it is my right to defend the man who had a magic wand &amp; brought back those jobs Obama said was gone forever!
@JohnStutz7 @CNN That’s the way it works.	Presidents often bluff to get what they want daring Congress to present them a Bill to Veto.
@MisterXtfr Last refuge of the left, when they’re not smart enough to engage in political debate they resort to name calling, exposing their weak mind for all to see.
@MisterXtfr @LindseyGrahamSC Educate yourself and follow his rulings!
@MisterXtfr @LindseyGrahamSC Mister Xtfr is another Freedom From Religion, Limiting Citizens of Religion Rights leftist.	Should it be mandated that Christians wear a Yellow Cross sewn into our garments?	As for Lindsey, he saw a smear campaign for what it was and called leftist out for it!
@JohnStutz7 @CNN Well we can’t possibly be talking about Trump. If you hadn’t skipped so many classes in Civics you would know the importance of Congress presenting a Spending Bill to Trump to sign.

@AP Over 80%of all women &amp; girls are raped&amp;Over 10,000people have died crossing the border illegally since the 90’s&amp;that figure is probably under reported!	The question becomes why do misogynistic sadistic Democrats encourage this behavior knowing these facts?	https://t.co/YKOT4wLjYT
@Alyssa_Milano Over 10,000 people have died making the dangerous crossing of our border since the 90’s &amp; 80% of all women and girls are raped!	Any American parent that attempted such a dangerous stunt would permanently lose custody of their children! And rightfully so!	https://t.co/YKOT4wLjYT

@TheNoahRing I don’t know for comedy it’s tough to replace CNN!	CNN has invented the 24 hour live Caricature News Network!	It’s already replaced the predictable SNL in our household!
@politico All Trump needs is to hire some Limey to make a Fake dossier linking the Mexican Cartels with the Democratic Leadership!	He could then have the Attorney General appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate!	It’s at least as plausible as the Russian collusion thing!
@FAIRImmigration @Gene_972 @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder I suppose they could parole him to a Sanctuary State with the understanding if he leaves he will be castrated &amp; then deported.
@CNNPolitics How many Wars was the U.S. involved in when Trump became President?	I think Cold War or Iraq War Political experiences is a net negative!	Judging by the results!

@NBCNews Shutdowns will interrupt normal Presidential duties. Of course this is just another shot at the President from another Fake News Organization.
@rial_rocks Maybe the Republicans can get some Limey to create a dossier about The a Democratic Leadership &amp; the Mecican Cartels so Trump can appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate 	This makes as much or more sense than the Russian collusion.
@JohnStutz7 @CNN Are we talking about Schumer?
@jingles90 @CNN CNN would probably just fold but judging from the ratings you would have to hear about it from Fox.
@KokomoKid1 @CNN We collected plenty of money from the Mexican Cartels the problem is Congress still must appropriate the money we collected from the Cartels!
@kaoticchemistry @CNN There here on our border! Much safer than in Syria or Afghanistan.	You disagree?
@Feisty_FL What do you mean by partly?
@ChuckCallesto I truly don’t believe there are enough Democrats &amp; RINOS to overcome a Veto!
@NBCNews Then the whole list is bogus!	Any entity that thinks the U.S. is dangerous for journalists gas to be by Definition A Fake News Organization &amp; and MSM that would report it is by extension a Fake News Organization!

@_I_LikeTurtles @Zwoodbutcher Maybe collusion between the Democrats &amp; the Mexican Cartels?	It makes as much sense as the Russian &amp; Trump collusion acquisitions.
@Genghistwelve @FaithfulToTrump @cstamp88 @mitchellvii But requires 60 votes to pass in the Senate per Senate rules, Republicans only have 51 votes.
@CarsonWells @mitchellvii The Senate Bill was a suggestion.	All appropriation Bills originate in the House. That question is always on a Civics Final Exam.
@PeonPundit @mitchellvii @HorsesRLove22 Take a Civics Class it will explain the Senate rules requires 60 votes Republicans only have 51.
@edisn @mitchellvii But there are not 60 Republican Senators!	Take a class in Civics!
@rubicon524 @mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump It’s a Democrats Protect the Mexican Cartels Smuggling Routes at all cost Shutdown!
@KoreyKruse @mitchellvii That’s because all appropriation bills originate in the House. The Senate vote was a suggestion...
@nickdangerca @mitchellvii @rbsugarskid A point of agreement.
@canisvex629 @mitchellvii He does want to make a stand against the Mexican Cartels, the question becomes why are the Democrats fighting so hard to protect them?
@HeelyBarker @mitchellvii So since $5 billion in a $4 trillion Federal Budget is a rounding error why crash the economy?	I truly believe the big winners in this budget fight are the Mexican Cartels.
@awolf12 @mitchellvii @piercedart See Adam you are a victim of our MSM.	President Trump could see a couple of drowning kids on the Potomac run out reach down pick them up &amp; carry them to shore and the MSM headlines would be, “Trump Can’t Swim!”
@Dianykinns @mitchellvii Valid point.
@msjoven @mitchellvii @LisaDayss There’s enough confiscated  Mexican Cartels Drug money to pay for the Wall.
@garyjr61969 @mitchellvii He wants the credit of standing up to the Mexican Cartels and disrupting their smuggling routes,	The question becomes why does the Democratic Leadership want to protect these Smuggling Routes?
@YohanHayyim @mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump You forgot the real winners the Mexican Cartels!	Is that whom you suggest they are colluding with?	Seems Trump should appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate the Democratic Leadership to see.
@tacootje @mitchellvii Nah, the House passed a Bill (Ryan) where all appropriation bills originate sent it to the Senate and McConnell couldn’t get 10 Democrat votes to get the 60 Senates required by Senate rules. 	Poor Trump never got a Bill to sign or Veto.
@SenSchumer Senator enlighten me did Congress send a Bill to the President to sign?	Until you fulfill your Constitutional Obligation and send the President a Spending Bill to Sign or Veto this is the SchumerShutdown!	Trump will Veto any Bill that won’t slow your friends the Mexican Cartels!
@SenSchumer And Democrats would rather crash the economy than spend a mere $5 billion. Let’s argue the $5 billion is a waste is it worth crashing the economy?	The question Senator becomes should President Trump appoint a Special Prosecutor to see if there is Mexican Cartels collusion?
@JohnCooper0610 @justdeplorible About the same as us who voted...
@Tlincali @GowenAnita @NBCNews It never got out of the Senate with the needed 60 votes!	You can look it up...
@godspianoman37 You have them friend.
@JeremieMc @Rowemanite @NBCNews See there are currently three parties in Congress the Democrats, Trump Republicans, &amp; RINOS. 	There are not enough Democrats &amp; RINOS to overcome a Trump Veto.
@PastorDScott Brother I’m in the same boat!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You mean you will finally send President Trump a Spending Bill?	The House did their Job the problem seems to be in the Senate!	I think though without the Money for the Wall you will not get s Spending Bill.
@PaulWDrake @Amylou3030 @LoriVassallo @LindseyGrahamSC No point getting emotional.
@TheDemocrats Aren’t the Democrats getting enough money for keep the Mexican Cartels Smuggling Routes open?	They should have asked for more money if they’re not!
@GOP The question becomes why are the Democrats fighting so hard to protect the Mexican Cartels Smuggling Routes?	Should Trump appoint a Special Prosecutor to find out?
@Rowemanite @NBCNews Until a Spending Bill is presented to Trump to Veto or Sign all Trump can do is Bluff.	Congress has an obligation to do its job.
@Amylou3030 @LoriVassallo @PaulWDrake @LindseyGrahamSC I suppose you defend the Democrats racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act &amp; are upset Trump has undone the Clinton’s Legacy!?!!

@JonesNne @NBCNews What does Christmas have to do with stopping Mexican Cartels?
@Maelvampyre @NBCNews You think the Democrats can get enough votes to overcome a Presidential Veto?	Over just $5 billion?	Makes one wonder how involved the Mexican Cartels are in this equation?	I mean the Mexican Cartels have the most to gain or lose!
@Andrewb2617 @NBCNews Serious question: what more could the Mexican Cartels want than this? All of this.
@Rowemanite @NBCNews The House Republicans fulfilled their obligation and sent the Senate a Bill. Per the Constitution all appropriations bills start in the House.	It’s on the Republicans &amp; Democrats in the Senate to produce a Spending Bill for President Trump to sign.
@GowenAnita @NBCNews Unfortunately per your 9th Grade Civics Class until Congress sends President Trump a Spending Bill to sign or Veto the onus is on Congress.	If you need a refresher check out the internet!
@IncookieCook @NBCNews I think the term is ride it down!	Destroy the country over petty politics.
@love2sing71462 @NBCNews Unfortunately that blade cuts both ways!

@TM72774 @alicia45KAG @dmaxter1200 @hirschA8720 Yes everything good is Obama everything bad is Trump!
@SenBlumenthal You Democrats would rather our nation go into a Deep Depression than Trump have his Wall?	Why risk the nation to protect the smuggling routes of the Mexican Cartels?	I’m forced to ask the question is their money that good?
@realDonaldTrump Good analogy!
@RWPUSA Do You think it’s time for the 25th which is the trigger of another Civil War? 	Why?
@leannewattphd @RWPUSA I think you think it is time for a Civil War.	The question becomes why?	Why destroy this nation to make it a Socialist Utopia like Cuba or Venezuela?

@slack2thefuture @realDonaldTrump You have a point the question becomes why are Democrats &amp; some RINOS so intent on protecting Mexican Cartels smuggling routes?	Have any ideas?
@LAGoldenrod @realDonaldTrump The (heroin) Opioid Crisis alone has already cost this nation a $trillion!	This number is not in dispute. Pain killers are the gate way drug to heroin. 	The Mexican Cartels Control 98% of all Trafficking of Heroin. 	$5 billion seems a small sum to fight the Mexican Cartels!
@MaggieGDBriggs @realDonaldTrump Is it?	I mean to fight the Mexican Cartels?	Knowing the strong support the Mexican Cartels have from Democrats &amp; RINOS. Maybe trying to stop the Cartels smuggling of illegal drugs, humans, &amp; Children Trafficking is insane but it’s the right thing to do!
@Brimshack @realDonaldTrump Stupid statement. 	No offense.
@CNN Maybe finally we can replace enough old Cold War Generals to develop a workable Middle East Policy!	Cold War Generals have all the wrong instincts to fight asymmetrical warfare!	40 years of doing the same thing over &amp; over again expecting different results is not working!

@SenBobCorker We already collected the money from El Chapo!

@realDonaldTrump I’ve read many negative post but Trump should ask the Democrat Leadership why they are so adamant in protecting the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes?
@JudgeJeanine @SebGorka Judge Jeanine, the Democrat Leadership desire to protect the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes need to be question!
@SandraTXAS Since 98% of all illegal drugs cross our southern border maybe the Mexican Cartels made the Democrat Leadership a better deal!	Just the Opioid Crisis (Heroin) alone has cost this nation a $trillion! 	$5 billion seems a small price to secure our borders!
@Lowcountry1Girl Is McConnell in the protection of Mexican Cartels smuggling routes along with the Democratic Leadership!	98% of all illegal drugs cross our southern border and just the (heroin) Opioid Crisis alone cost this nation a $trillion!!! &amp; Democrats can’t find $5 billion to stop this!
@AmyMek The question becomes do we want to be align with such a country?

The Democrat Leadership main goal is to protect the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes!	98% of all illegal drugs come through our Southern Border!	Only explanation plausible!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump See somehow it’s in Chuck Schumer’s and the Democratic Leadership interest to protect Mexican Cartels smuggling routes!	With 98% of all illegal drugs coming from south of the Border what other expkaination is plausible for their change in opinion?
@NevadaJack2 @Rick95648 It’s their Affirmative Action program Rich White Boys....
@MisterXtfr I’m sorry you started with a low blow.	Ridicule is the first step in denying the rights of others for their own good.
President Trump ask the Democratic Leadership why they are so intent on protecting the Mexican Cartels that they would shut the government down?	The (Heroin) Opioid Crisis has alone has cost the U.S. a $trillion, with 98% of the illegal drugs crossing our Southern Border. https://t.co/1OfhrFLvqb
@MisterXtfr @LindseyGrahamSC You have to understand how editing &amp; sound bites work.	Need an example take Obama and 57 states. Fact Check to hide the fact he said it marks false and says 57 (Islamic States) talk about cover!	The original for your entertainment!	https://t.co/r095xzheKq
@JoanneRise68 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Ok, let’s try this approach!	The (Heroin) Opioid Crisis has already cost America $trillion!	98% of the Heroin crosses our Southern Border.	These numbers are not disputed!	The question becomes why are the Democrats fighting so hard to protect the Mexican Cartels smugglers?
@safeagain1 @realDonaldTrump This is how coup begin!
@realDonaldTrump President Trump ask the Democrat leaders why they work so hard to Protect the smuggling routes of the Mexican Cartels? 	98% of all illegal drugs cross our southern border!	Just the (Heroin) Opioid Crisis has cost the nation $trillion!	Ask the American people! What’s $5 billion?
@DailyCaller @luzabrg Senator Schumer says Republicans Must ‘Abandon’ Protecting our Southern Border from the Mexican Cartels!	98% of all illegal drugs cross our southern border!	Just the (Heroin) Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation a $trillion!!!
Why are the Democrats willing to Shutdown the Government to Protect the Mexican Cartels smuggling routes knowing98%of illegal drugs cross our Southern Borders?	Just the (Heroin)Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation a $trillion!	That’s the question Republicans should be asking!
@derekjGZ LSD using missileers are a clear &amp; present danger to the country!
@RealSaavedra Senator Hirono, can you explain to me why it is so important to protect the Mexican Cartels Illegal Drug trade?	It’s only worth a little over a $billion to Democrats to stop illegal drugs? Just the (heroin) Opioid Crisis has cost us a $trillion!!	I don’t understand your thinking!
@CB618444 The question becomes what do the Mexican Cartels have on the Democratic Leadership that would force them to protect the smuggling of drugs?	Just the (heroin) Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nationa $trillion!
@funder The question becomes why are Democrats protecting the Mexican Cartels?	And Trump should resign because he wants to slow down Illegal drugs crossing our border?	The (heroin) Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation a $trillion with 98% supplied by the Mexican Cartels!
@SeemaCMS @Rick95648 @larry_levitt Hey, let’s be honest, we all should have gotten very suspicious when the Health Care Insurance Companies were so excited about the ACA!
@ChristinaSchaf1 @thomesinc @CB618444 @jimmykimmel What did you say? https://t.co/u4aoml4bJG
@LindseyGrahamSC Senator Lindsey, Illegal Drugs are a plague on this nation with 98% being supplied by the Mexican Cartels! Just the (heroin) Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation a $1 trillion!	The question becomes why are Democrats fighting so hard for the Mexican Cartels?
@cpribno6 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Anyone that sayswalls are a waste never went to Disney!	But the biggest argument for the $5 billion is to stop illegal drugs from the Mexican Cartels!	98% of all illegal drugs come through our southern border.	Just the (heroin) Opioid Crisis has cost this nation a $1 trillion!!
@justdeplorible @RyanAFournier Unfortunately Pakistan gave them too...
@AngeloRayGomez @patreiss @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Look a secure border means fewer illegal drugs! 	The Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation $1 trillion! 	Knowing 98% of these illegal drugs cross our southern borders the Democrats won’t spend $5 billion to reduce it!	The true question is why not?
@John_KissMyBot Democrats want their Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service but the Wall will reduce Illegal drugs entering the Nation that’s what the Democrats are fighting for!	To protect the Mexican Cartels. 	The question becomes is it for money or are they just stupid?
@JenGriffinFNC @braschen1 A principal based on Cold War mentality!
@Stableharleymom @SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump Stop the Opioid Crisis build the Wall!
@justdeplorible @Maggieb1B @chuckschumer I figured it out!	Democrats want Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service but it’s just a cover!	What they really want is to protect Mexican Cartels! 	They won’t spend $5 billion to protect us knowing the Opioid Crisis alone has cost us over $1 trillion!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump What’s the hold the Mexican Cartels have on Democrats?	98% of all illegal drugs in this country are shipped across our southern border. The Opioid Crisis alone has cost this nation $1 trillion and you won’t spend $5 billion to stop it? Is it the money or do you do this for Free?
@dscc All this fighting to protect the smuggling routes for illegal drugs of the Mexican Cartels!	Pelosi &amp; Schumer won’t spend $5 billion to protect Americans from just the Opioid Crisis which has cost this nation $1 trillion!!?!?	With 98% of the illegal heroin coming from Mexico!
@DarrellWest1984 That wins the award as dumbest post of the morning.	No offense.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I hope Trump does what ever is necessary to stop Democrats from protecting the illegal Mexican Cartels Illegal Drugs Smugglers!	The Opioid Crisis alone has cost this Nation $1 trillion with 98% of the heroin crossing from Mexico!	This is more than about illegal aliens!
@realDonaldTrump President Trump you need to rebrand the Wall! 	Stop making it about Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Make it about stopping Illegal Drugs!	Tell Pelosi &amp; Schumer to stop protecting Drug Smuggling and spend $5 billion to stop the $1trillion Opioid Crisis!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Why are Democrats protecting the smuggling routes of illegal drugs from Mexico?	The Wall is our best defense to stop illegal Mules from carrying illegal drugs into the U.S.	The opioid crisis has cost this nation over a $1 trillion and 98% of the heroin crosses from Mexico!
@SenMarkey And Democrats working for The huge Illegal Mexican Drug Dealers will do anything to keep those Illegal Drug routes open!	https://t.co/2OFZeAicYF
@RepRaskin And Democrats will use any excuse to keep open the Drug Trade along our Southern Border and block any effective Barrier that Trump tried to implement!	From Slavery to Human Trafficking Democrats never change!	https://t.co/ami3FLnlsw
@NBCNews You’re asking the wrong question.	How much does illegal drugs cost this nation most carted across our Southern Border by Illegal Alien mules!	Trump should rebrand his Wall and Call it the anti-drug barrier!	https://t.co/ami3FLnlsw
@The_Trump_Train @speakersamerica The Wall could be justified merely for stopping mules carting drugs across the border!	The question becomes why do Democrats defend Drug Trafficking?	https://t.co/ami3FLnlsw
@MisterXtfr I help in Shelters for the marginally housed.Speaking to people there I was stunned how many had been displaced by exploitable Illegal Alien labor. It was a downward spiral after losing their jobs &amp; the racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act made it worse!
@MisterXtfr When the Senate voted it’s S.J.Res.54 - A joint resolution to direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen Trump decided to disengage from the Middle East.	Will this be a wise decision is another question.
@TheDemCoalition @MisterXtfr I strongly disagree!	Trump yesterday undid the Democrats Racist 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act the Legacy of the Biden, Clintons, &amp; the Clinton’s mentor the Evil Genius KKKByrd!	Who else would have been Strong enough? Obama couldn’t!
@MisterXtfr I see you are not a Fan of the 1st Amendment.
@fillyphyl You’re right about 5,000 out of several million over 28 years made it with 10% of the illegal crossers being Border Guards.	So I would say the Berlin Wall was very effective!
@MisterXtfr @LindseyGrahamSC Civics usually isn’t offered until the 9th Grade in most school districts.	And most kids in college would fail.
The party of Exploited Slaves, the party of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service.	Some things never change!
@TheTrumpLady Walls don’t work...
@NotRealPressSec @Reg7d88 @LindseyGrahamSC Mostly in California.	The ballot harvesting in North Carolina was penny ante stuff!
@darkcloudkilla @jaygriffin8 @LindseyGrahamSC Jay is as much a Republican as Hillary....
@darkcloudkilla @jaygriffin8 @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry I meant to say Jay...
@NotRealPressSec @Reg7d88 @LindseyGrahamSC With ballot harvesting popular vote is less relevant.
@RuthieRedSox Funny how that works.
@RepGwenMoore I suppose we could say the same thing about you?	I mean why would you defend the racist Clinton Legacy?
@cajunqueen91 @LindseyGrahamSC That’s just funny!
@jaygriffin8 @LindseyGrahamSC That’s the dumbest post of the day!	Are you an artist or some other liberal arts major?	300,000,000?
@DServon @LindseyGrahamSC Democrats fought a Civil War to keep its Exploited labor! Why are Democrats still fighting to keep the flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service?
@CharisHamilton8 @LindseyGrahamSC $5 billion is just to cover the high traffic area.
@jjenzo6 @LindseyGrahamSC So what’s the problem with $5 ?
@Reg7d88 @LindseyGrahamSC If your 59% was accurate Hillary would be President!
@Reg7d88 @LindseyGrahamSC Gee, I thought it was a Representative Government?
@Monique00951137 @LindseyGrahamSC He did with the USMCA.
@MisterXtfr @LindseyGrahamSC See, you’re the reason Civics should be taught for two years in High School.	It doesn’t become a Trump Shutdown until he gets a Bill to Veto. As much as Trump would like to take credit he can’t!	It’s assuming Schumer can’t get 10 Dem. Votes the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@tracec66 @LindseyGrahamSC You may have a point!	Democrats fought a Civil War to keep their slaves!	They will fight to keep their flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service and will even use the same reasoning, “Whose going to do those jobs” for what the leftist want to pay!	Sick!
@TrumpTromper @realDonaldTrump Trump dared the Congress to send him a Bill without the $5 billion.	Congress failed to allow Trump to Veto it!	Senator Schumer just proved he wouldn’t give Trump a poisons snake knowing the snake would bite Chuck.	This is now the Schumer shutdown.
@SarahPalinUSA Why donate anonymously?Leftist are the ones promoting the flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service knowing Illegal immigration hurts our minorities disproportionately more! They even use the same arguments, whose going to do those jobs for what we pay?
@realDonaldTrump President Trump the nuclear option here would be a long term political mistake!	Better gave the vote in the Senate if the measure doesn’t pass because Schumer won’t allow 10 Democrat Senators vote for the measure call it then what it is the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@JeffFlake Hey a point of agreement!	Much better to put it to a vote let the measure fail and call it what it is, the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@45RAPEDKATIE @realDonaldTrump If you were Black &amp; had suffered under the racist Clinton’s Legacy and had been sentenced to 5 years for Crack Cocaine sitting next to your White cell mate that got caught with 100 times more Cocaine or was a manufacturing worker you would have a different opinion!
@CNN @drsanjaygupta Prayers for her speedy recovery!
@20jhosier16 @OKIndian1 I’ve talked to season FBI agents they say the clowns on the 7th floor of the J. Edgar Hoover building do not represent the FBI!		And Trump should stop speaking poorly of the rank &amp; file!
@williamlabbe @senatemajldr I think Mitch delivered every Republican vote all Schumer had to do was deliver 10 to avoid the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo So you are fighting to continue the flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service knowing this hurts our minorities disproportionately more? And I suppose you use the old tried &amp; true line whose going to do these jobs at what I pay!
@Troyation @SenFeinstein Admittedly Trump tried to take the blame!		But Schumer wouldn’t give Trump a a Mad Dog knowing the Dog would bite Chuck so he never gave Trump a chance to Veto the Bill &amp; take credit!
@SSteve115 @cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo Duly noted!	From an objective observer in the U.S. Justin Trudeau is laughable and a disgrace.	Does this work for you?
@goodgr8vy @freedom_moates You’re right he did bluff Congress.	Democrats should have harvested votes and sent a Spending Bill to Trump and see if he would really Veto it!
@cjmoose @CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo Ever thought of moving to Canada?
@betterdace @ffein @brianschatz @lilsun83 I’m always amazed at Democrats desire to maintain their flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Claiming who will we get to do these jobs at what we pay?	Exactly like old slavers who would ask who is going to pick our cotton!	Some things never change!
@JudyWesen @senatemajldr So in the name of common sense the Democrats would rather have a Schumer Shutdown over a messily $5 billion?	You guys will do anything to protect your flow of Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Next I’ll hear whose is going to do those jobs?	Racist all!
@soyboy2000 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo So Party that is against allowing more Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service the Party that was formed to stop Slavery are the traitors?	Seems nothing has changed since Late 1860!	On either side!
@CanadaEh16 @senatemajldr @ChrisCuomo Don’t worry we think the same about Justin Trudeau.
@AnnCoulter Ann if you are going to post columns you need to stay aware of the news....
@freedom_moates Well until the Senate gets its house in order &amp; have a vote this is the SCHUMER McConnell SHUTDOWN!	Ironically &amp; the season inconvenient truth of the matter, legislatively speaking, Trump’s hand are clean until the Senate produces a Spending Bill!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump The irony &amp; inconvenient truth is until Trump gets a Spending Bill to sign or Veto it’s a SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!	Trump’s hands legislatively are clean,
@ffein @brianschatz @lilsun83 Schumer likes to hurt people....his idea of Christmas joy, I guess.	The irony is Trump has not received a Spending Bill to sign or Veto.	Until this happens this is the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@grantmichaels @brianschatz That’s ok! The inconvenient truth is this is the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN until they send a Spending Bill to Trump to sign or Veto!
@brianschatz Yes, a point of agreement!	What’s a messily $5 billion Senator?
@PattyMurray Democrats need to put away their pride over a mere $5 billion!	The inconvenient truth is until Trump gets a Spending Bill this is the Schumer Shutdown!
@SenSanders The Democrats are willing to shutdown and destroy the Country over $5 billion!	This is the inconvenient truth!
@SenSanders The inconvenient truth is until Trump has a Spending Bill to sign or Veto its the Schumer Shutdown!
@SenFeinstein We’ll have a vote in the Senate &amp; see.	The inconvenient truth is, if it fails because Senator Schumer fails to get 10 Democrat votes to pass the Spending Bill this becomes the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!	And ironically as it sounds Trumps hands are clean.
@mishanti2 @SenFeinstein Then I suppose they will have to come back.
@jrossiart @SenSchumer Schumer the Defender of Masters of poor Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service!
@SenSchumer When did Trump Veto the Spending Bill Senator!
@SenFeinstein Why not go to a House Senate committee and iron out the difference?
@SenJeffMerkley You’re right but the question is why didn’t you even give Trump a chance to VETO a Bill?	Congress failed to let Trump be the reason for the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP From what I understand Congress has to send a Bill to the President to sign.The President is not responsible for Congress’s failure to send a Bill!The House did it’s job so you personally are off the hook!McConnell did his job the problem is Schumer.	This is the SCHUMER SHUTDOWN!
@cpribno6 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump The only people that think the Wall is a waste of money are brainwashed or desperate to protect their Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn Service.	Illegal immigration labor hurts our minorities disproportionately more!
@fillyphyl Wow!	I’ve never traded post with anyone that crossed at Check Point Charlie illegally!	Thousands cross our border legally just like at Checkpoint Charlie, It’s the ones that try &amp; cross illegally that matters!
@426Bdizzle @_AltDonaldTrump @SenSanders And they are effective.
@debnk9s @_AltDonaldTrump @SenSanders See that’s the problem with leftist!	They don’t know what a dictionary is and throw out words they truly don’t understand the meaning!	Let’s start with the word, “everyone”.
@BorderExplorer @_AltDonaldTrump @SenSanders What you want to use Cheap Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal labor to save money?
@IsteveneNieddu @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump You are taking a sacrifice to protect your Cheap Exploited Illegal Lighter Skin Maid &amp; Lawn Service!	Illegal immigration hurts our minorities disproportionately more!
@MrTommyCampbell @SenSanders And Democrats are the party of Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn service!	Not a huge jump from the Party of Slavery.
@SenSanders Bernie the job of Congress is to give Trump a Bill to sign or Veto.	It’s that simple.	It’s not Trump’s SHUTDOWN until he Vetos a Bill.	Do your job get a Bill to Trump!
@Rndy_918 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t apply!	It’s not crazy to protect the nation, it’s his Job!	Democrats the party of Slavery now the party of Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal Maid &amp; Lawn service!	Some things never change!
@PastorJAVELEZ @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I think Schumer means well but until Congress sends a Bill to Trump this is by definition the Schumer SHUTDOWN!
@cpribno6 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump BUILD THE WALL!
@JoanneRise68 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump There is no Pressure on Trump until he gets a Bill!	When do you expect Trump to VETO the spending Bill?	The reality is This is the SENATE’s SHUTDOWN &amp; McConnell has delivered his votes it’s up to Schumer to come up with 9 or 10 votes!	Until then it’s the Schumer SHUTDOWN!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy when do you expect Trump’s VETO to shut the government down?	Are you even going to give TRUMP the chance to SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator Schumer is the $5 billion for the Wall worth shutting the government down and forcing McConnell into the Nuclear ☢️ Option?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Until the Senate sends Trump a Bill to Veto it’s the Senate’s Shutdown!	Spin all you want!	This shutdown is Yours Senator!	You never gave Trump the chance to Veto the Spending Bill!
@Margare30507196 @Briteeye777 @GSDAlpha @realDonaldTrump It appears the Republicans have steered the whole debate into decision time for Schumer to Fund the Wall or shit the Government down.
@fillyphyl Contrary to your statement the Berlin Wall proved very effective until Reagan convinced Gorbachev to tear it down!
@CBSNews Did Trump Veto the spending Bill?	Until Trump vetoes something the Shutdown is in the hands of the Legislature!	The House has sent a Bill to the Senate. It is up to the Senate to produce 60 votes per Senate rules. McConnell has delivered all 51 of the Republican votes.
@Reuters The future of the Senate is not in the hands of Schumer!	He either relents on the Wall or the Senate becomes a reflection of the House!
@dsumma Don’t you see the beauty of this?	Trump doesn’t have to veto a Bill because Pelosi was wrong when she insisted Trump didn’t have the votes in the House!	The shutdown is in Schumer’s hands!	This will be a Schumer Shutdown by definition!	Funny when you think back to 12/11!
@rebeccaballhaus But by definition Trump must get a Bill for Trump to Veto to shut down the Government!	Pelosi said Trump did not have the votes in the House for the Wall! She was wrong and has left Schumer hanging!	The Shutdown is in Schumer’s hands by definition!	Not Trump’s!
@fillyphyl I disagree strongly!	Walls though out history have proven effective to stop military invasions until the invention of the cannon!	Until illegals use cannons they will work!
@thehill Trump can’t shut the Government down if he does not get a Bill!	The House has delivered a Bill!	McConnell has delivered the Republican votes.	Minority Leader Schumer it’s your decision to keep open the Government!	No one else’s!	It will be by definition your shutdown!

@essenviews What do you propose, a coup?
@NancyPelosi Democrats are not for border Security! 	They want their Exploited Cheap Lighter Skin Illegal maid &amp; lawn service! 	Some things never change!	They know it causes income inequality, hurts our minorities disproportionately more but it keeps inflation low through wage stagnation!
@NancyPelosi What stopped the caravan?	Walls are effective against humans without cannons!
@NancyPelosi It’s a Schumer Shutdown until Trump gets a Bill!
@ResnickElliot 16 Republican Presidential Candidates and two former Republican Presidents all said Trump was not a real Republican!	That’s why I voted for him!	Because Hillary was close enough to being a real Republican!

@ByronYork @EddieDonovan They really don’t if they put the $5 billion up.
@opREDPILL @Sweet_PeaBelle I suppose he can do what he wants until he gets a Bill to sign or veto.

@colmc39 @mitchellvii Trump’s had had 7 bankruptcies. But that’s out of about 500 companies. That’s like batting 986!	And true, The Deep State is throwing everything at him!	The Globalist really hate him!
@colmc39 @mitchellvii First off it’s a joke saying Trump is less confrontational with Russia or China!	Secondly Trump is correct in insisting our allies pull their own Weight!	Mathis is upset with both Yemen &amp; Syria. 	Trump doesn’t think the Middle East  is worth our soldiers dying for.
@colmc39 @mitchellvii No, but let’s be honest &amp;!agree the Democrats would rather we go into a depression than let Trump succeed.
@SenSchumer @GypseBautista Senator Schumer I think you will find out, you and Trump will have a different opinion on what “must” means.

@colmc39 @mitchellvii I quote politifact when they can’t put enough spin on a topic.	Trump is a story teller. I think his lies are more a matter of perception. Let’s use illegal immigration. Trump says the cost is $200billion a year others say less than $100billion but Trump adds the cost of opioids.
@realDonaldTrump Poor Lindsey has one weakness he truly believes competing tribes can be democratized.

@essenviews And the left is only interested in keeping Blacks on the Democrat Plantation that’s why it took so long to undo the Racist Clinton’s and their mentor the Evil Genius KKKBYRD &amp; their Legacy the 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act.

@essenviews It may take a generation to get through the gross reporting of the unfair press but I believe she is correct!

@simsimsala @TexasMa80834181 @realDonaldTrump Explain how a 10% tariff on aluminum &amp;  a 25% tariff on unfinished steel could triple your material cost?	Our chemical cost has gone up some but the Chinese are manipulating their currency so we are only seeing about 7-8% in price increases.

@JLMarchese111 @ktraczy People from outside of Paris are coming to the city to protest the gas tax! Outside of Paris where mass transit is scariest the Carbon Tax really hurts!	Saying this is a protest about low taxation on the rich is just leftist propaganda.

@realDonaldTrump Under the Paris Accords China gets to increase CO2emissions until 2032but China already burns 50.7%of all the coal consumed on the planet!	Trump’s 25%tariffs on Chinese manufactured goods will lower the CO2footprint of Americans &amp; do more to reduce CO2emissions than the Accords!
@IronMonkey1034 @realDonaldTrump Trump is right the Paris Agreement is a joke!	It allows China to increase its dirty coal usage until 2032 &amp; use 2032 usages as its point to decrease CO2 emissions!	China already burns 50.7% of all the coal consumed on the planet!
@StringBassMotiv @realDonaldTrump But you also may learn with effort!	Look up the terms Freiwillige or Waffen-SS.

@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump We need an European Army!	Let’s call it Freiwillige!
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump I read Trump’s Tweet no mention of England or Frsnce just Germany barely spending 1/2 their obligations towards the collective defense of Europe.
@LorineMS @realDonaldTrump First off look up the term Freiwillige.	Secondly Obama wanted the NATO Counties to do their fair share also.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Question Senator, do you want to destroy American Manufacturing or solve the problem of Climate Change? Every article we import from China instead of manufacturing here raises the CO2 footprint of Americans!	China consumes 1/2 the Dirty coal burnt on the planet!
@Red_Menace206 @veteranhank @realDonaldTrump Where do you get your information?	CNN?	https://t.co/EoYeGtvga7
@GoranLerum @veteranhank @realDonaldTrump I work in manufacturing in L.A. The company I work for has been open for 43 years, under 3rd generation we have never had a layoff and under Trump the lowest paid hourly workers make over $50,000/yr while under Obama it was less than $30,000!

@SasjaBeslik China burns 1/2 the Dirty coal consumed on the planet to make stuff for industrial nations!	Trump’s 25% tariffs will do more to reduce CO2 emissions by accident than the Paris Accords Can hope to do on purpose!	BTW U.S. emissions down almost another 3%!	https://t.co/tZ1Q2Fvbrr

@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump Where were these Foreign Add under Bush or Obama?
@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump China uses the WTO to its advantage. It declared itself a backwards Developing Nation.	And of the last 3 Presidents Trump is the only one to seriously challenge China.

@thatsmydog8 @realDonaldTrump Actually I am concerned with the Deficit but a 25% tariff on $500 billion worth of Chinese goods helps! Reduces our deficit by over 10%.	Not to mention if Trump called it a CO2 Tariff to reduce Americans CO2 footprint.	Both WIN WINS!
@veit2coffee @Aaronpannell2 @realDonaldTrump You know I was in Thailand in the service 45 years ago when an old Chinese woman wished me an interesting life.	Is your “Wish you the life you deserve,” Like that?

@Aaronpannell2 @veit2coffee @realDonaldTrump I’m talking Dec. 2016 - Dec.2018 we still run 7days a week! The salary of our lowest paid hourly under Obama was less than $30,000/yr but under Trump it’s greater than $50,000. Not bad for a kid out of High School. We have firm orders till April 2019 which is longer than normal.
@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump Walter, are you saying Trump is wrong &amp; we should just learn to live with China’s Unfair Trade Practices?
@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump Listen to NPR.	Trump’s Trade War with China will benefit the Chinese citizens as much as it will benefit America workers.	Xi has a very unique idea on commerce with China becoming China Inc. undoing privatization &amp; the Communist Party regaining complete control.
@veit2coffee @Aaronpannell2 @realDonaldTrump We in manufacturing know differently!	Thursday after Trump was elected our largest customer showed up and said,”That crazy Trump will start a Trade War, we want to lock up domestic capacity!” Within two weeks we had sold 150% of our capacity for 2 years!	We are not unique!
@AndrB35552598 @Magicscooter @realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Ok just for argument sake, how has China developed the fastest growing economy in the world with protective tariffs 10 times higher than the U.S.?	And if you study History, How was it the U.S. becamevthe strongest economic power shielded by high protective tariffs?

@mkultra1979 @realDonaldTrump I think it is obviously the opposite.
@WalterAppling @jmap8 @realDonaldTrump China was playing a very long game against the Globalist Clinton’s, Bush’s, &amp; Obama. Trump is playing a fast pace game to make up for the short-sighted Globalist. By denying China its largest customer by diversifying the U.S. &amp; thus the worlds buying options this will hit China!

@AndrB35552598 @realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron China burns 1/2 the coal consumed on the planet &amp; President Trump’s 25% Tariffs will do more to reduce CO2 by accident than the Oaris Accords could hope to reduce by design.
@realDonaldTrump @EmmanuelMacron Allowing China to burn 1/2 the coal consumed on the planet to make stuff for industrial nations doesn’t lower the worlds CO2 footprint!	This is an inconvenient truth!
@realDonaldTrump The strange thing is Trump by adding a 25% tariff of Chinese goods will do more to reduce Climate Change than the Paris Accords!	China consumes 1/2 the Dirty coal burnt on the planet!
@realDonaldTrump Wonderful idea President Trump!	Since China burns 1/2 the Dirty coal consumed on the planet &amp; is responsible for over 80% of the mercury pollution that falls on North America you should charge a 25% Environmental Tariff of Dirty Chinese stuff.

@The_Nova_Legion @dvanpat @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump The acceptance of the concept of interest is partly why we had the Industrial revolution. It is why Europe left the Middle East behind.
@The_Nova_Legion @dvanpat @_FlyTheW @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump That’s the advantage of being the worlds currency.	Cheaper interest than could otherwise be justified.
@realDonaldTrump I agree, since judging by the South China Sea we can’t buy the peace let’s stop giving them the money to arm themselves.	If China wants Trade it has to be Fair Trade &amp; we need to add a tariff based on their Carbon &amp; pollution footprint.
@veit2coffee @Aaronpannell2 @realDonaldTrump Does he?	Manufacturing job growth hasn’t been this good since the mid90’s!	https://t.co/ftQqcr8vjh
@Aaronpannell2 @veit2coffee @realDonaldTrump Actually starting in the 80’s to force the collapse of the old Soviet Union the U.S. would agree to Trade Treaties sacrificing manufacturing jobs for Geopolitical reasons.
@The_Nova_Legion @dvanpat @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump That’s equivalent to banning home loans.
@The_Nova_Legion @_FlyTheW @dvanpat @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump And 80% we owe to ourselves.
@The_Nova_Legion @dvanpat @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump You should tank a class in banking.
@dvanpat @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump I think better than under Obama. Obama doubled the debt, I don’t see Trump doubling it.
@creaturemonster @Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump How many manufactured jobs have we added?	I work in manufacturing we haven’t had it this good since the mid-90’s and there is no denying this!	https://t.co/ftQqcr8vjh
@Rothbardian1627 @dvanpat @realDonaldTrump The whole premise of Economics is motivation.	What motivates people.	How do you get them to do things.	Allowing other nations to charge protective tariffs without responding just encourages more protective tariffs by other nations.
@StanStevens17 @realDonaldTrump That’s how to do it!	GM builds a car in China then exports to the U.S. &amp; face a 25% tariff more than the labor in the car. 	How many of those cars do you think GM sells?
@fabvinny72 @realDonaldTrump Vincent you have to think for yourself &amp; not believe the Wall Street Globalist Press is telling you the whole truth!	https://t.co/ftQqcr8vjh
@veit2coffee @realDonaldTrump The very notion that it is ok for other nations to have protective tariffs   &amp; we not respond to protect our citizens &amp; workers is treasonous and unethical.
@thedeneau @realDonaldTrump We were already priced out of China with their 25% tariffs.	And UnFair Trade by definition is unfair.
@Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump Two ways actually, #1 Tariffs pay down the National Debt, #2 it encourages manufacturing here creating more jobs with people paying more taxes to pay down the National Debt.
@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump Points of agreement.

@GeraldoRivera @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I don’t have a problem with that. As a matter of fact Trump should contact Mexico to prosecute the leaders of the caravan and pay the poor stooges to go home.
@realDonaldTrump I understand Twitter is limited in characters but Mr. President you have to explain to many of these former Participation Award Winners that in negotiations it is better to negotiate from a position of strength. That is why we have the a Military Budget we have!
@MtnMD @realDonaldTrump Were you a regular Participation Award Winner in School?	I only ask because if you won a lot you would understand it’s better to deal from a position of strength in negotiations.
@4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump Wow! I’m surprised how many posting don’t understand it’s much better to deal from a position of strength!	There is the downside in our participation award mentality in teaching today.
@girlinseattle @realDonaldTrump And you should know if you had more real life experience in winning it’s much better to deal from a position of strength.
@pkropf @realDonaldTrump Obviously you don’t have much real life experience but trust me dealing from a position of strength is always better.	If you knew this you would not have made this post.
@thebradfordfile @RuthieRedSox The truth of the matter is cheap exploited illegal immigration labor is the Globalist answer to slavery. Think about it, it keeps inflation low through wage stagnation. 	Something all the Globalist Elite want.

@KamalaHarris @RepJayapal See Kamala that’s part of the point of pushing for Exploited Lighter Skin Illegal Immigration Labor!	So you can exploit them &amp; use them to keep inflation low though wage stagnation &amp; it hurts and allows control of our minorities!	You Democrats have been like this since slavery.
@Stephm717 @essenviews Well if that’s true Great!	Manufacturing hasn’t had it this good since before NAFTA kicked in!	Trump has that Magic Wand Obama said was needed to bring back those jobs gone forever!	https://t.co/ftQqcr8vjh

@jojoh888 Well considering the Racist Democrats with their War on the Poor &amp; their 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act created so many felons it limited their choices!	https://t.co/NkU9PDktbA
@essenviews I on the other hand find it fascinating that anything Howard Dean says is relevant.
@MotorCityBadBoi @immerresistdjt @EdResists @essenviews You have to look at the big picture not cherrypicked results.	We’ve gained over 337,000 new high paying manufacturing jobs tge last year 12 months!	https://t.co/o3R6Q9N0mO
@lionelljeffers1 @washingtonpost How do you reconcile that statement with the fact Trump has sent offensive weapons to Ukraine &amp; threaten a New Cold War over The Intermediate Missile Treaty?	It makes the intellectually honest ask what did the Russians have on Obama!
@PradRachael @wwwillstand @BreitbartNews Then you have to ask the question what did the Russians have on the Clinton’s &amp; Obama?	Obama never sent offensive weapons to Ukraine or threaten to walk away from the Intermediate Missile Treaty even though the Russians were cheating under Obama’s nose!
@StormIsUponUs @Outlaw3065 That’s not true with the Globalist Wall Street Press this fight is in its early stages!
@sxdoc @wwwillstand That’s cool.
@Stop_The_Donald @GOP Let’s agree under Trump your glass is always half empty mine is half full but no one can argue the glass has more in it!
@Stop_The_Donald @GOP Checking the website I see in actual jobs between 2016 to 2017 part time jobs decreased over 300,000 but full time jobs increased over 2,000,000. https://t.co/lZm6HFRGgm
@Stop_The_Donald @GOP How about this one? &amp; let’s try &amp; use data fresher than 3 years old.	https://t.co/o3R6Q9N0mO
@immerresistdjt @EdResists @essenviews Our customers started coming to the plant saying that crazy Trump will start a Trade War &amp; we want to lock up 25% of your capacity.	Before we realized it we had sold 150% of our capacity!	In some ways I hate it!	Everyone has cars under Trump and my commute is 30 min.longer!
@immerresistdjt @EdResists @essenviews No, the average salary of the newest hourly employees at the manufacturing plant I work at under Obama was less than $30,000/year under Trump it’s over $50,000!	We never had a layoff in over 43 years of operation but struggled to stay open 5 days/week under Obama.
@Stop_The_Donald @GOP The point is the jobs are different under Trump vs. Obama.	Trump is the manufacturing economy the one that Obama saidcwas gone forever &amp; would require a magic wand to bring back!	https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg

@immerresistdjt @EdResists @essenviews Which one, the one for Bernie in the CA primary or the one for Trump in the General Election?
@bubba_wubba @GOP @realDonaldTrump Doesn’t matter what Trump intends. If China doesn’t back down and Trump imposes the matching 25% tariffs of Dirty Chinese Stuff the result is a reduction in CO2 emissions plus added $billions to lower the deficit.
@Stop_The_Donald @GOP There’s no denying Obama was the King of Low Paid Multiple Part Time Service Jobs to make ends meet Economy.	But Trump is the King of the High Paid Full Time Manufacturing Economy!	https://t.co/o3R6Q9N0mO
@fried_chicken_7 @GOP Are you one of those Chinese Trolls?
@bubba_wubba @GOP @realDonaldTrump The deficit is growing but Trump’s 25% tariff on Chinese Intensive CO2 generated Stuff could lower the deficit by over $100 billion and lower over all CO2 emissions!	A true WIN WIN!

@icejackel2015 @essenviews The increase is easy to explain, Everyone is trying to beat the upcoming jump in tariffs to 25% to match China’s tariffs on our products.	Before Trump China would charge 25% tariffs while we only charged them 2.5%. Do you think that’s fair.
@aksluicy @essenviews Well we in manufacturing have really appreciated Trump. Manufacturing hasn’t been this good since just after they signed NAFTA.

@Dangerouslytal @DJT_Editor @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS It’s always been a one way situation as far as Trade is concern with China.	Xi’s policies are bad for us there’re bad for the Chinese people! 	Xi wants to make China into China Inc. Which is bad for everyone.

@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Is that a confession?	Don’t be so hard on yourself.
@Dangerouslytal @DJT_Editor @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS First off Clinton never had a Trade War with China because we didn’t give permanent normalized Trade status with China until Late 2000 as President Clinton was leaving office.	And Bush help China join the WTO so he never fought unfair trade.	All Obama did was appease the Chinese.
@DawnDavis64 @DavideFurman CNN is much funnier than SNL!	I mean people don’t watch “The Big Bang Theory” to learn about physics!	People don’t watch CNN to learn about the News!	It’s for the reality show style comedy!
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Just one question do you think it’s right that China has a 25% tariff on our exports while we only charge them 2.5% on their exports and it is ok for the Chinese to steal our intellectual property &amp; should we or should we not do something about it?	Simple question.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Educating liberals is hard.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Xi’s response has been to increase from their standard 25% tariff to 35% andvstop buying American Farm products. 	We don’t patent stuff anymore we file but don’t publish because all we do is teach the Chinese how to steal our innovations. 	In conclusion this is a needed fight.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS The Chinese people have seen their standard of living increase under privatization but Xi’s plan reverses this &amp; slow the rate of increasing the Chinese standard of living.	All Trump has done is raise our tariffs 10% to get Xi’s attention then to 25% when it didn’t work.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Let’s focus on Trade between China &amp; the U.S. 	Ever hear of China Inc.? This is Xi’s centralization/monopoly planning of the worlds manufacturing in certain important segments of the economy &amp; is bad for the U.S., the World, &amp; the Chinese People.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS Most economists are Globalist first. Tariffs is to them the Boogieman, it’s like Pandoras Box once open it can’t be controlled. 	Trump’s insistence on Fair Trade scares most Economists beyond rationality!	So let’s discount for argument sake economists opinions on this.
@DJT_Editor @Dangerouslytal @CageFree777 @VP @POTUS The plant I work at has been open for over 43 years we have never had a layoff.

@alfredanchor @VP @POTUS First off the American Worker is one of the most productive worker in the world and with low energy cost the only thing holding us back is unfair trade.
@alfredanchor @VP @POTUS China charges 25% on our manufactured good we export to China where as we only charge them 2.5%. Reciprocal trade is just a symptom of UnFair Trade.
@alfredanchor @VP @POTUS I gave you the rules and now you want to change the topic to pollution?	But the biggest thing Trump has done is insist on Fair Trade.	Of course the rest of the world was use to taking advantage so the Trade War was predictable.

One customer came to us and said that crazy Trump will start a Trade War &amp;we want to lock up 25% of your production &amp; then the rest came!
@alfredanchor @VP @POTUS That’s not true! Trump has rolled back many rules that would make energy cost higher. With cheaper energy cost it makes possible to compete with low labor cost countries.
@SenatorMenendez It’s hard to believe how stupid your supporters have to be to believe your post!	This stuff about Putin owning Trump?!? Did Obama send offensive weapons to Ukraine after Crimea?	Did Obama threaten to walk away from the Intermediate Missile Treaty for Russian cheating?

@therealOrrinO @DailyCaller There’re mostly Globalist Propaganda. We for decades have distorted trade by agreeing to unfavorable deals to push global goals. Disagree?Explain to me why theE.U.for years has been allowed to charge10%tariffs on our manufactured goods block our farm exports &amp;we only charge 2.5%?
@DailyCaller Currently the E.U. charges 10% tariffs to fund their E.U. bureaucracy mostly on our manufactured products exported there with a luxury tax added to that where as we only charge them 2.5% tariffs on their exports!	Matching their tariffs would lower our deficit by $40 billion.
@mitchellvii Do you have links?
@DuckworthRobyn @CNN A good way to create more high paying manufacturing jobs here &amp; lower the deficit and more importantly lower our CO2 footprint!	All WIN WIN WINS!
@dystopiRIC @CNN Do you understand where the money from the Tariffs on Cheap Environmentally Dirty Chinese goods go? To reduce our deficit.	By reducing purchases of Environmentally Dirty Chinese goods we lower out CO2 footprint 	China burns 1/2 the worlds coal consumption to make products for us!

@tonyg0 @realDonaldTrump Did you support Obama?	Obama added $10 trillion to our debt.

Raising your environmental footprint when those same products could have been made here with less than 1/5 of the environmental footprint.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump it’s all in the marketing!	Don’t talk about Fair Trade, talk about Pollution! China burns 1/2 the coal consumed by the planet making stuff for us causing smog in the Central Valley in CA &amp; responsible for over 80% of the mercury that falls on North America!

@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump The irony is Trump by imposing a 25% tariff on Chinese manufactured products has done more to reduce CO2 emissions than  the Paris Accords.	China the last few years has burnt half the coal consumed on the planet!	They are responsible for most of the smog in the Central Valley CA.
@charliekirk11 Aren’t most Democrats?
@SenSanders Let’s teach Saudi Arabia a lesson!	Let’s turn over the Middle East to the Iranians!	Haven’t seen this much stupidity since we went into Iraq!
@FOXLA @GCoinCollector Good for the Democrats ...	Good for the Republicans...	Is this a Win Win?
@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump Good a point of agreement.	Most on the left think we should do nothing to China. They are satisfied with a Low Paid Multiple Part Time Jobs economy so they can buy cheap stuff from China. 	I find that to be very shortsighted.
@SenWarren @RWDSU @amazon Be careful Senator!	You may disturb the Giant that owns the WP....	Have you seen their reporting on Trump?
@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump So you would tell me a manufacturing worker that we should do nothing about China’s 25% protective tariffs on all our manufactured goods?	Didn’t Great Britain want the same deal with all its Colonies?
@tomselliott @DeplorableAlex As a Trump supporter I must admit President Obama has a point!	He could have screwed the increase in U.S. oil production with over burdening regulations on Fracking just like Al Gore could have screwed up the internet but they didn’t.
@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump I work I Manufacturing &amp; Trump has been a God-Send to us!	Trump brought back those jobs Obama said were gone forever with his magic wand &amp; there is no denying this!	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@littleimpressio @realDonaldTrump If you worked in manufacturing you would understand these things take time but the good news is all the manufacturing jobs Trump brought back with his Magic Wand, you know those jobs Obama said were gone forever!	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@Free_Media_Hub @realDonaldTrump That blade cuts both ways!	Take Trump, Obama, Russia. Ukraine, &amp; weapons.	https://t.co/KKtFuhGXTs
@lloyd_t_spencer @realDonaldTrump @TeamTrump First off that 14,700 was reduced to 14,000 but GM is not the whole country. We are averaging over double the new high paying full time manufacturing jobs per month under Trump!	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@NOW1SOLAR @realDonaldTrump Or post on Twitter it seems!	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@TheAdventurizr @realDonaldTrump And it’s obvious you don’t work in manufacturing either!	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@TheAshMorgan @realDonaldTrump You have to look at the larger picture.	https://t.co/eB3p3ycplX
@mrdavehill @realDonaldTrump Is it a strap-on?
@Mamaleh_Trump @realDonaldTrump Obviously you don’t work in manufacturing! 	These things take time &amp; we in manufacturing are worried the New Democratically Controlled House May fight Trump and we will lose gains in manufacturing made under Trump.
@charliekirk11 @K1erry It’s the elite &amp; poor against the middle class.
@adriannebyrd @VP @POTUS You think you have problems live in California!

@imillhiser You’re kidding right?
@JohnBrennan It is a shame that John O. Brennan is a free man &amp; Edward Snowden is in exile!
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump It’s funny how the facts differ from your rhetoric!	President Obama refused to send offensive weapons to the Ukraine.	President Trump on the other hand has sent a lot!	Trump is a far more assertive Watchdog than President Obama ever tried to be!	https://t.co/3bahfm1wSP
@SecPompeo Anything we do to weaken Saudi Arabia strengthens Iran!	Why would Democrats want to do this?
@tedlieu @SecPompeo I think that would have the predictable consequence of seceding most of the Midfle East to Iranian Control.	Is that the outcome you are hoping for?
@NPR That’s a big IF...
@newtgingrich As a Salary Californian worker I now hate Trump!	Because of Trump the manufacturing plant I work at is running 7 days a week! Under President Obama we were lucky to work 5. Often I got to take 1/2 of Friday off! &amp; the traffic has added 30 min. longer. https://t.co/BxD97oMJUz
@JohnBrennan And if there is a just world your name also will be scorned &amp; Edward  Snowden name will be revered!
@Alyssa_Milano Do you feel the same way about President Obama?	He was the original Cage Master &amp; turned over Illegal kids to Human Traffickers!	Or are you just the typical hypocrite?	https://t.co/t28Jw4hs5q

@Bolstelp @SenateGOP The Fiscal Year is October 1 - September 30. The tax cuts were in effect for 3/4’s of 2018.	But revenues were still ahead of 2016.
@SenJeffMerkley Well Senator you have to admit it’s not like they are turning these kids over to Human Traffickers like the Obama Administration did!	https://t.co/GnAMTEzXsl

@Bolstelp @SenateGOP If that’s true, then why are revenues up over 2017 or 2016?	I think we have a spending problem.
@kbg351 @SenateGOP You need to change jobs. The hourly wages of the workers in the plant I work at are up 60% under Trump vs. Obama!	And we are the norm not the exception!	https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg
@JoeAmericaFirs1 @SenateGOP Yes it is Trump’s fault with his magic wand bring back jobs Obama said were gone forever!	https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg
@Batt6C @SenateGOP Then get a High Paid Manufacturing job! You know one of those jobs Obama said was gone forever!		https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg
@TheZenofWriting @SenateGOP That’s the old Obama economy!	Hourly workers at the manufacturing plant I work at are making over 60% under Trump than Obama!	I bet Obama was upset when he found out Trump had a Magic Wand...	https://t.co/o3R6Q9N0mO
@BonitaTeuben @SenateGOP Well at least unlike Obama he is not turning kids over to human trafficking! BTW Obama caged and gassed illegals too!	https://t.co/T5NUcDSOQn
@sectime @SenateGOP You mean the H-1B visas that many companies took advantage of to lay off higher paid American workers?
@Lurvetufsa @SenateGOP @BarackObama Yes! Let’s thank Obama for all those Low Paid Multiple Part Time Jobs Economy because it will take a Magic Wand to bring back those High Paying Full Time Jobs!	You know those jobs Obama said were gone forever!	https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg
@kelliscottbooks @SenateGOP You need a better Union!	All the hourly employees at the manufacturing plant I work salaries are up 60% since Trump was elected.	We few salary employees are up 30% because of bonuses.
@kagleslie @SenateGOP @SenJoniErnst You must have believed Obama &amp; was a fan of the Low Paid Multiple part time jobs economy because all those high paid manufacturing jobs were gone forever. 	https://t.co/jbGN4p02xg
@joliehawk @SenateGOP Thank God we have President Trump &amp; his Tariffs on Chinese manufactured goods!	China the last few years has burned 1/2 the coal consumed on the planet &amp; you can’t justify that with terms like per capital or historic usage.
@WillieLinnear @SenateGOP GM will introduce new products for several of those plants.
@mksystem74 @SenateGOP No they don’t they haven’t been this profitable in decades!
@jessealan @SenateGOP That’s exactly what GM is doing ending production of cars that don’t sell.
@kathleeneholmes @SenateGOP So.	GM is closing plants that make cars people don’t want!	What would you do as CEO?
@katymuldoon @SenateGOP @GM Their making cars in those plants that don’t sell but are making more profits than they have in years!	What would you do if you were the CEO?
@LaBellDebi @SenateGOP Assange is Russian?
@DailyCaller Where was Rihanna when the Obama Administration was turning Illegal Alien kids over to Human Traffickers?Where was Rihanna when the Obama Administration waslocking up Illegal kids in cold cages making them sleep on the floor?And where was the Hypocrite when Obama gassed illegals?
@IngrahamAngle I didn’t know Assange was Russian?
@NPR Not exactly they lose that right when they turned down jobs &amp; asylum in Mexico per the law.	I didn’t realize NPR was so bias or ignorant?	Which was it?	https://t.co/ofkrA5wBD6
@RWPUSA From what I’ve seen $7,000,000 is chump change in Washington!	The median net worth of a member of Congress was $1,029,505 in 2013 with over 1/2 being millionaires.	At $7,000,000 in 2018 I would bet Paul Ryan is in the lower half in Congress.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Did the tax cuts explode the deficit?	We were projected to go into a recession but the Tax Cuts put that off!	And we collected more money in taxes than we did in 2016.	Looks like to me we have a spending problem.

@FarmLadyFarm @SenatorCollins Why are you defending the Racist KKKByrd &amp; the Clinton’s Legacy?	Their War on Blacks the 94 Violent Crime Control &amp; Law Enforcement Act which targeted Blacks with the 100:1 mandatory sentencing disparities!	https://t.co/Hvg33G8TGB
@mrpkennett @SenatorCollins So you support the Evil Genius KKKByrd &amp; his minions The Clinton’s &amp; their War on Blacks with their 100:1 mandatory sentencing guidelines that targeted Blacks?

@RWPUSA So we replace Trump and nuke Russia!	Is that the plan?
@RWPUSA Have you looked at the manufacturing numbers &amp; jobs created?	If President Trump is crazy it’s Crazy as a Fox!	But why are you defending China’s 25% protective tariffs?
@mflynnJR Or how about the poorest Americans?	Illegal immigration labor is exploited labor causing low inflation through wage stagnation which hurts our minorities disproportionately more!
@RWPUSA How many will recognize sarcasm?
@RWPUSA Richard we need to stop Trump!	He has everyone working &amp; buying cars and mass transit usage here in L.A. is way down!	My commute has increased over 30% because of Trump’s economic policies!	He must be stopped!		https://t.co/K3XESvhFwS
@washingtonpost We need to have Nancy Pelosi as Speaker maybe she can get rid of Trump!	Here in L.A. the commute is terrible!	Everyone has cars and good jobs!	Mass Transit riders are at historic lows per mile because everyone has a car!	We need to stop Trump’s economic train for my commute!

@MOWaterhouse @realDonaldTrump You mean President Obama has a good reason why he turned kids back over to traffickers with no questions asked?	https://t.co/heaIPECBKE
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I wonder how fake news would have reacted if you systematically turned the kids back over to traffickers like President Obama did!	https://t.co/heaIPECBKE
@HighPope_Brun As if that’s the worse part! Everyone now has a job. Mass transit ridership is down here in LA because everyone has a car!	My commute has increased 30+% because of that darn Trump!!!
@HighPope_Brun Would it make you feel better if I told you I hate Trump?	I have plenty of reason to hate him!	Before he was elected it was tough to keep the plant open 5 days a week, many Fridays I only had to work 1/2 day. Being salaried it didn’t matter but under Trump we work 7 days a week!

@John_KissMyBot I hate Trump! I voted in the primary for Bernie and Trump in the General election not that it mattered here in California.	Ever since that Darn Trump got elected everyone has a job and a car and it’s added 30% more to my daily commute!	I hate Trump!

@HighPope_Brun Mostly it’s the German Labour Front, they had all kinds of radical ideas like 8 hour work shifts, Paid Breaks, higher wages, Social Security, minimum wages, and other benefits. Basically you had a 12 man staff that told Companies how they were going to treat their workers.
