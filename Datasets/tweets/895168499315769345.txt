PRESIDENT TRUMP forget about the NFL. PUERTO RICO IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. THEY ARE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES !
@EVargasABC I just love  you.   I am a recovering alcoholic,  I have 2 years and 3 months sober.  You give me strength.
@realDonaldTrump you do not care about poor people or people of color!  Your actions and lack of actions of PR proves it. THEY ARE AMERICANS
@realDonaldTrump I would like to know why you continue to tweet things that's do not sound very intelligent and make people mock you?
@TheView I hate the term snowflake.  And I am not a "snowflake "
@TheView I have Native American family.  We have never complained.
Will Donald J Trump PLEASE grow up!
