@RepBobbyRush The military's support for Trump is very hard to understand.  It makes me wonder exactly what information they are exposed to and what is being filtered out.
@EdKrassen I hated Reagan.  You're probably not old enough to really remember Reagan.  I rolled my eyes throughout W's presidency, but never hated him.  I had a massive crush on Clinton, and was mildly disappointed but OK with Obama.		I loathe Trump.  Is there a stronger word than loathe?
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber @AOC This is not because she's a woman.  It is because she is going to destroy them, and they are terrified.

@kylegriffin1 In any normal circumstances, Trump wouldn't stand a chance in 2020.  But these are not normal times. We need to worry about what Trump will do to stay in power.
@thomaskaine5 I personally think democrats need to soften their stance on abortion.  And also work harder to focus a pro-active message, instead of just constantly reacting to Trump.  Reaction and defense is not a message.

@brycecovert @BeBraveMyLoves How about we guarantee full time jobs first, instead of letting companies (and even govt agencies) hire multiple part time people instead?
@SenGillibrand @BeBraveMyLoves Pointless when companies can just avoid hiring full time employees.  That means they can just fire you.
@NPWF @BeBraveMyLoves @gillibrandny It's pointless unless you do something about the companies that just hire two part time workers instead of one full-time.  That's what they all did when Obamacare passed.  Made things worse for us because our hours were actually cut.

@Notobolshevism @supremegroypr @ADL Neither for nor against, as neither political side makes a lot of sense.  Better access to healthcare and family planning is the only sensible approach to eliminating abortion, but elimination should be a goal.
@Notobolshevism @supremegroypr @ADL Simply false.  Billionaire donations are about half and half, give or take from year to year, although it's impossible to say precisely since there is little transparency in campaign finance.
@Notobolshevism @supremegroypr @ADL Hmmm, I wonder if they would reproduce less like puppies if women had better access to healthcare such as birth control?  But I guess GOP must like the rabbit-like reproduction, as they seek to deny both abortion and birth control.
@Notobolshevism @supremegroypr @ADL No, dictatorship eventually crumbles.  More democracy tends to evolve into more socialistic economy.  Power for all = wealth for all.  Most of our wealth and power is hoarded by a few.

No. 2 VA state politician who should resign, Amanda Chase.  Says she doesn't need ERA because she open carries a gun.  She began open carry primarily to deter immigration activists from confronting her in public. Says replacing confederate street names gives her heartburn. https://t.co/AROKxFrn3l
I'm going to start listing all the VA state senators who should also resign if Northam or Herring resign.  Introducing Republican Charles Carrico, who tried to bring back confederate license plates (it wasn't back in college, it was 2015) #VirginiaDemocrats https://t.co/YE7Cn7oqHu
@MeetThePress @JulianCastro Castro can just butt out.  Anything he says is completely self-serving, just to promote his own political agenda and make himself appear more progressive.  We need to do what is good for Virginia and the people of Virginia, and that needs to be the first priority.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Trump is not a legitimate president,

@MeetThePress @AOC This is right.  I am sick of the race police trying to decide who gets to claim their heritage and who doesn't.
@stuartpstevens I think people who have never lived down here have trouble grasping how the very roots of today's racial issues are fundamentally different here.
@SassyKadiK Hate to be contrary, but all these GOP theatrics were actually started by 2 blundering Virginia Dems who didn't understand their own bill well enough to suitably explain it when asked.
How VA Democrats actually started the GOP's viral infanticide lie by being being unprepared to answer questions about their own bill.  Seems tone-deaf to blunder into this bill on a hot-button topic without even understanding it themselves.  		https://t.co/T0hawgugbL

@DeargDionadair @DavidAFrench @WalshFreedom You just proved what I said.
@DeargDionadair @DavidAFrench @WalshFreedom He clearly stated it.
@DavidAFrench @WalshFreedom This author starts with basic climate denial, so really no point in reading further. It‚Äôs really simple science any school child can understand so anyone who is this uninformed is not credible in any capacity.
@politico How many VA politicians will be left after we finish checking all the yearbooks?
@flowingfire @ProudResister Don‚Äôt you watch science fiction? Only most of us will go extinct. Billionaires don‚Äôt care because they will live in a giant spinning space paradise.
@joshtpm I wish younger people would understand that we actually didn't always look at a picture like that and see racism.
@RadioFreeTom Does anyone think maybe this system of appointing people should perhaps be changed for one where people must actually be suitable and qualified for the job based on some more objective criteria?  You know, like every other job in the world?
@joncoopertweets I think people should always be allowed to grow and and change.  If their more recent actions strongly support that they have left behind racism or whatever-ism, then we should look to their actions first and forgive past mistakes.
@senatemajldr @POTUS Trump or Mcconnell's endorsement tells us she's completely unsuitable for the job.
@daveweigel I can't remember who Howard Schultz is.
@girllyfan Probably all of them south of here.

@funder Republicans here are desperate to take back legislature before 2020 presidential race so they can rig elections and also pass anti-abortion laws in case roe v wade is overturned.  They will do - and have done - anything they can.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump Yeah, we paid more.  Middle class, didn't make any more, paid thousands more in tax.  This is really wrong.
@MSNBC LOL Obama didn't commit any crimes.  But they certainly harassed the hell out of him anyway.  And don't forget poor Bill Clinton - harassed and impeached for a BJ.
@yusuf_VI Agreed.  And people in office should actually not be allowed to lie.  We don't let companies do it to sell their products.

@jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham LOL you keep saying the same stupid things.

@DMDoubleG @JimLahe28728880 @RedIsDead @djt5900 @linnyqat @bayofarizona @jonallendc @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett Sorry, I guess it was an un-funny joke.  Just pointing out that VA Republicans trying to oust those three Dems are much much more racist and sexist.  Thought your perspective was probably from a more liberal state.
@egavactip Virginia.  You can't take her anywhere.
@EdKrassen If he is so concerned about sex trafficking and trafficking of children, then why did they send unknown numbers of children off with "sponsors" who might not even have been related to them without even keeping track?  And now won't even try to find them?

@DMDoubleG @JimLahe28728880 @RedIsDead @djt5900 @linnyqat @bayofarizona @jonallendc @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett LOL, now ask yourself, if that's what a progressive democrat looks like in VA, what does a right-wing Republican look like?  (Hint - looks like mandatory vaginal probing of pregnant women and torch marches against Jews).
@MaddieBarry8 @AviFlyGirl Should be on a stamp.
Infanticide hysteria - so confused, can't even figure out what GOP trying to outlaw and Dems trying to protect - basically all from VA Gov Northam's wrong answer at presser.  Plus blackface x 2, sex assault. Then GOP with bathroom bills and slavery monuments. Do better, VA.
@EdKrassen Another result of Virginia stupidity and conservative misinformation.  Late term abortions exceedingly rare - only two in VA in the past 20 years, and fetuses not viable.

@ewarren Hillary Clinton said this back when she was just a First Lady.  And nothing happened.  What little improvements were made, were too little too late for most of us, and undone by Trump for the rest.  Unless someone has a real plan for how this will happen, it's just more BS.
@realDonaldTrump That doesn't mean they like you.  They just had a very low bar for the SOTU.
@MarkWarner NoVa residents seem to be owing lots more tax this year. GOP tax cut and mortgage deduction elimination are bad for us.  And as a small business person I can't see any benefit that I got from the tax cuts.  Please try to do something about this when Dems take over.
@ironstowe I'm enjoying the site of him seething over all the Pelosi clap photos, since he probably couldn't see her most of the time as it was happening.
@altUSEPA @thehill I do want to solve problems going forward.  And the first problem to solve is ending the corruption in Washington.  This is not a past tense thing.
@RealSaavedra @WalshFreedom I'm not a Warren fan, but I'm tired of the race police.  Tribes can determine membership in their tribes, but they don't get to say whose DNA they share.  Warren apparently believed in and was rather proud of her Native American heritage. People have a right to their heritage.
@joshtpm And sadly, partisan politics have figured out how to weaponize the desire to be rid of these things.  Just dig something up, or make something up,  to where it's hard to know what's real or not, what to believe or not.

@Yamiche @JoyAnnReid I've been saying from the beginning - this was a coordinated attack to undo an election that rejected confederate statues, bathroom bills, and mandatory vaginal ultrasounds!  Republicans have a 3 seat majority right now.
@ironstowe This was a coordinated attack by the VA GOP.  I've been screaming that since day 1.  They have a 3 person majority and 1 vacancy.  Before Northam and Fairfax VA was state of bathroom bills, confederate statues, and mandatory vaginal ultrasounds.  VA rejected that.

@JimLahe28728880 @RedIsDead @DMDoubleG @djt5900 @linnyqat @bayofarizona @jonallendc @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett Maybe they are loyal to Virginia and its people. If you don‚Äôt luve here or understand the political situation here, you should not butt in.
@djt5900 @DMDoubleG @linnyqat @bayofarizona @jonallendc @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett And then when they are gone do you think anyone will call for resignation of republicans left in charge? They are Trumpers with ties to white supremacy, but guarantee you they won‚Äôt be stepping down.
@djt5900 @linnyqat @bayofarizona @jonallendc @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett Unfortunately, this was a gop strategy to deliver a 1-2 punch to remove the two elected dems who stand in their way of complete control of VA. It is attempt to undo election. Regardless of flaws, these guys are better than alternative - bathroom bills &amp; confederate statues.
@showusyourwork @cranstonl1972 Um, no, actually facts are true. That‚Äôs the definition of a fact.
@jdawsey1 I keep saying it. Republicans. If Northam leaves, Republicans gain a firmer grasp on a slim majority. If they both leave, we are back to being the state of bathroom and vaginal ultasound  bills. Non-virginians need to butt out.
@JakeSherman @dougmillsnyt This photo is going to drive Trump insane.
@DennisMJordan @LillianVikingDK @realDonaldTrump @GOP Yeah, same here.  Thousands more in taxes paid this year, but no more made.
@JoyAnnReid I still think they were cheering because someone pointed out that quite a few of the female additions to the workforce are when Democratic women took the jobs of Republican men in Congress.
@mkraju Romney's spine went into hiding.
@CBSNews So...the answer to mass shootings is for people to carry more guns, but if you have a gun out at a mass shooting the police can come in and shoot you.
@UnfollowTrump He doesn't know the difference between socialist democracy and socialist dictatorship.  Perhaps he unaware of Norway's existence.
@guypbenson It is a real problem that dems continue to support this without better messaging on what exactly this entails and why it would happen.  And if the truth is not a better message, then they need to rethink this position.
@TIME It doesn't seem that the goal of anti-racists is actually to end racism.  They don't want people to be racist, yet there are 3 generations of people still alive who grew up in a very racist environment.  Many of them have learned and changed.  That needs to be allowed.
@ironstowe Abrams speech was great.  Wish she would slow down just a bit.  Ready to vote for Abrams for president.
@DGComedy The surgeon lifted her brows too much and now she can't close her eyes.
@CBSNews If this was a poll of CBS viewers than I don't buy it.  I watched the CBS live view for about 10 minutes and got so nauseated by the running positive commentary about Trump that I had to turn it off.  Like ESPN doing toddler ice hockey, but not cute.
@EdKrassen People in cities also tend to be more educated.  The more educated people are, the more they rely on facts and logic, the better able they are to evaluate information, and the less they fall for lies and empty rhetoric.  Also why PhD's are the most liberal.
@UnfollowTrump Problems neglected because they either don't exist or didn't exit before Trump.
@WalshFreedom They didn't matter when FACTS shows Kavanaugh tried to rape a girl in high school.
@ironstowe Based on what's going on at the border, I suspect he will actually attempt to build the wall illegally.  Maybe borrow money from Russia?
@IvankaTrump Normally I would agree with that, but this is one woman who really really needs knocking down.
@AOC Great statement by AOC, but I feel more like we're flying in a hijacked plane than without a pilot.
@Justice_099 @CBSNews No, I didn't say that.  Not anywhere.

@Daniel_Lewis3 @Acosta She clapped right in his face and then nodded like "Yeah, that's right bitch."
@TheDemCoalition Is thbptttttttt a word?
@kylegriffin1 And "we have to fight all enemies, foreign and DOMESTIC."  I feel she meant the one in the white house.
@Justice_099 @CBSNews I'm not really sure how you got that.  If you lived in VA and you had a choice between a guy who used to be racist but now supports a progressive agenda and a guy who loves Trump and supports neo-nazis and voter suppression, who would you choose? Or do you just not live in VA?
@kylegriffin1 She found a way to clap and totally own him at the same time.  Brilliant.
@UnfollowTrump Unless they are brown children; then we take them away and put them in cages.
@atrupar Pelosi has weaponized clapping.
@mkraju And he just took credit for a cut in drug prices.  Did that even happen?
@Justice_099 @CBSNews He might have been a racist once, but he hasn't governed like one or pushed racist policies.  If Dems had a majority in legislature, I'd say get rid of him.  But it's him and Fairfax, or Republicans, and the VA Republicans are way more racist than Northam could ever be.
Trump thanks the dem women for cheering loudly and standing when he announced that women has taken 58% of newly created jobs.  He doesn't realize they were laughing and cheering because THEY took them from Republicans.
@RadioFreeTom Beto better respond to this.
Fact check from NYT:  Trump just introduced a family of victims killed by illegal immigrant. EXCEPT the man has not pleaded guilty or been convicted.  So Trump just convicted a man without a trial.
Trump really cannot stay off the topic of women and girl sex slaves.

Trump says ridiculous investigations will hold back his "economic miracle" and Pelosi doesn't bother to hold the laugh in this time.
He said "America is winning every day" and Pelosi literally choked back a laugh.
Never watched a SOTU before.  Is it normal for half the room to stand and clap after each statement, while the other half sits and glares?
He just claimed to pass a massive tax cut for working class families. What country was that in?? Cause I paid more this year.

@nikoCSFB If it's true that Kamala Harris plans to give a rebuttal herself, then someone needs to tell her to back off.
@renato_mariotti @ActualEPAFacts Maybe Graham is the one with dementia.  He hasn't been making a lot of sense lately.
@thehill I'm drawing a blank.
@CBSNews People really need to understand that Northam resigning may not be in the best interests of the people of Virginia.  We elected a democratic gov and lt gov, and losing them leaves the state in Republican (confederate) control - this is not what the people want or deserve.
@AltFireAviation This is the administration that pretended to fight a lawsuit over dumping toxic waste in Arizona, while secretly dumping toxic waste in Arizona anyway.  Should not surprise anyone if they try to build the wall illegally.
@ProudResister @LillianVikingDK I did not vote for Trump.  Glad to hear I have license to complain.  I plan to do a lot of it.
@nowthisnews Using this kid to push their agenda is so despicable.
@K4JUSTICE @RepJayapal Give the man some credit.  He's done more for white supremacy and Russia in 2 years than Obama did in 8.
@TouchOfMaine @burgessev My impression was that was true. Do you know of a specific time otherwise? I have never heard of anything like that that didn‚Äôt turn out to be a hoax.
@MrFilmkritik Thank you. We need to stop giving Melania a pass. She is the most complicit Trump. An immigrant who benefited immensely from our country, she says nothing about inhumane border and knows full well Trump is a Russian asset. She is a traitor and human rights violator too.
@WalkingDead_AMC Oh thank god. Mueller is a good show, but needs way more zombies.
@joanwalsh Did you say something besides Bernie is an out of touch old man who is trying to undermine women and refuses to properly acknowledge the preeminence of race in modern political discourse? Because that seemed to be all that was allowed by the privilege police yesterday.
@thehill @HillTVLive It‚Äôs too late. Only can save this presidency is impeachment.
@realDonaldTrump Wait, this isn‚Äôt the parody account?
@RepJayapal He‚Äôs done more than any president before him.

@psychdr100 @dc_tribune I hate all these teasers.  I get so excited, and then Jr. doesn't get arrested.
@atrupar Well, they were so quick to jump Northam.  Maybe the feeding frenzy is over because they've eaten their fill?  Or maybe they're realizing that this was a GOP strategy move to get rid of the only two people standing in the way of Republicans taking back VA.

@ahsoka2019 @TrinityResists @AviFlyGirl @NFL Disagree.  Ignoring roots of white-privilege discourse for a moment (because they are far from "widely" known), term is used only by relative small group far left liberals (not ALL far left liberals) and is of criticized in academic circles (on academic, not political grounds)
@TouchOfMaine @burgessev viable just means alive....the assumption was that there is something wrong with the child that would not allow it to survive.  That is the only scenario he was discussing, and the law in Virginia does not allow elective abortion late in term except to save mother.
@leeleeb50 Middle class, made less, paid a lot more in tax. No refund.
The good news is nobody is buying Trump‚Äôs BS. Now if only dems can halt the slide into exclusive and divisive tribalism among themselves, reason might return to the white house. https://t.co/vFzibwrekd
@TrinityResists @AviFlyGirl @NFL Then please explain why my reply was wrong, other than disagreeing with group-based rhetoric of left identity politics, in spite of my general agreement with the political position. Questioning group rhetoric should not exclude one from group.
@SailorHaumea @burgessev There is no situation in which a woman has an elective abortion if the baby can survive outside the womb and it is legal in Virginia.
@burgessev Northam was talking about what doctors do when a baby is born with an un-survivable defect. Most parents want to hold the child - not have it ripped away for fruitless intrusive and terrifying medical procedures.

@TrinityResists @AviFlyGirl @NFL Not to be an ***hole, but just because one person is disadvantaged does not make the other privileged, by virtue of the definition of "privilege."  That seems to imply that the normal state is to be disadvantaged, which suggests normalization and acceptance of discrimination.
Yes, it's true. Trump's father was arrested after KKK members attacked police in NY.  When asked, Trump first responded it wasn't his father, but a different Trump.  When shown it was his father, he responded the arrest didn't happen.  Then he said his father was never charged. https://t.co/Az42RNtLhV

@mkraju Warren should butt out.  This is a GOP strategy to take over the VA senate.  Funny all of them are known confederate supporters, racists, sexists, and Trumpers.  The irony of Northam and Fairfax resigning so they can take over is infuriating.  Warren should think about the people

@RepCummings I nevertheless fear that a hasty decision could lead to having actual clan members running the state, as the VA GOP is already strategizing how to gain power from the resignation (or not).

Virginia deplorables are currently freaking out over the prospect of Justin Fairfax (the black descendant of slaves) becoming governor, while simultaneously cackling with glee over the possibility that it may prevent Fairfax from running in 2021. #Northam
Also, as I suspected would happen, they plan to try to block Fairfax from seeking election in 2021 due to the one term limit for VA governors.  They stand a good chance to do so, as a partial term is a first for VA, and thus untested.
For those cheering Northam to resign, Virginia deplorables already scheming to increase their power through laws which may give increased power to Republican VA Senate members if Lt. Gov. Fairfax vacates current position to assume Governorship.

According to Northam, he and Fairfax have spoken a lot and Fairfax does not wish him to resign.
@FenitN @washingtonpost It is disturbing that the man not only asks for forgiveness and wants to make amends, but that his actions over the past 2 decades of public service have been examples of making amends, and his policy record absolute proof of change.  Why can a person not grow and change?
But oh good lord, he now admits to wearing blackface as part of a Michael Jackson costume.  I guess that pic is out there somewhere.  He also claims he has changed and grown, which is supported by his public record.  But it looks bad.
Northam says he never saw the photo, didn't buy the book, and it's not him.  Unfortunately, it's a day too late.  I don't think it's going to fly, even though I frankly don't think his resignation is good for Virginia or that he is in fact a racist.

@CitizenJane1001 @adamcbest This exactly.  No doubt they are talking.  Everything else is just noise.
@adamcbest Perhaps they are working with Fairfax and Northam to come to a unified decision and give a more measured response than all those jumping into the feeding frenzy to serve their own political ambitions.  Some people care about Virginians in all this.
Some things to think about if Northam resigns:		Virginia governors may not serve 2 consecutive terms.		Fairfax was favored to win in two years.  If he serves the rest of Northam's term, no guarantee he can run again.  Republicans will almost certainly attempt to stop him.

Interesting.  I am so disgusted over how quickly so many have rushed to condemn, for self-serving political reasons.  I feel strongly we need to wait, get the full story, and see how the people of VA and the lt. governor feel about it before anyone outside of VA butts in. https://t.co/GDITRRXZ2A

@CaraLynnBirts @OfficialCBC His policies have been the exact opposite of racist, like expanding healthcare, criminal justice reform.  I know a lot of people who might have taken that photo in 1984, and a lot of them are liberal progressives now who totally get it and have changed.
@RepJeffries Then perhaps you should also call for the resignation of Gillibrand and Harris, who attended Women's March with anti-Semitic organizers with current (not 40 year old) ties to hate group.  Funny how self-serving people's outrage is.
@RalphNortham Please please do not resign.  Self-serving and hypocritical calls from dem candidates are sickening.  Some went to women's march with anti-Semites and known ties to hate group.  Please prove thru action they are wrong.  People of purple VA NOT calling for resign.

Self-serving #hypocrites @kgillibrand2016 and @KamalaHarris were willing to speak at the Women's March although it was organized by #antiSemites with current ties to a hate group, but are quick to call for resignation of VA's effective Northram over a single 40 year old photo.

@amovingtrain67 You must be very young if you don't understand how much our idea of what is and isn't racist has changed over the past 40 years.  That's called revisionist history.

It‚Äôs so sad to see that liberals are just as illogical and unable to think in critical or nuanced ways as Trumpers.
@jcbraun1 @rnelson0 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham How is that ironic? It is just more evidence that Northram today is no racist.
@ActualEPAFacts @Weinsteinlaw And in any case, Northram‚Äôs actions in the 40 since have consistently opposed racism. Remember we‚Äôd have had Gillespie otherwise. Can‚Äôt a person be allowed to grow and change?
@ActualEPAFacts @Weinsteinlaw Maybe, maybe not. 1984 was a different time.  There was not the sense that a costume like this was racist in the same way we understand it now (but it was not ok either)
It scares me that a presidential candidate is so quick to condemn, and also to claim to ‚Äúheal‚Äù when clearly she does not understand the unique politics of VA and what the fallout of resignation will be for the state, the legislature, and the people who live here. 		Self-serving. https://t.co/RsirPWT0xU
@essenviews It‚Äôs hard to understand them with all the missing teeth.
@Alyssa_Milano Really? So people can‚Äôt change in 40 years and a lifetime of doing good and fighting racism means nothing if you wore a racist costume inn1984? You know, i remember when alyssa milano was no feminist.  Do you?
@MikeNellis @DeepInTheHills @KamalaHarris @CNN Was quickest to bash fellow dem northram to further her own political purposes, without regard for what the people who elected him and live in his state might want. She lost my vote,
@Weinsteinlaw @ActualEPAFacts Republicans stick together. Its what keeps them in power. Dems should try it.  I won‚Äôt vote for any if these self-serving dem candidates bashing northram like sharks circling a wounded whale. They are so transparent.
@amyklobuchar How self-serving of you.
@saffroncash @jcbraun1 @rnelson0 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham I meant Justin Fairfax. It would be hard for Northram to stay if the lt gov was not supportive.
@MommaPittsburgh @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Imagine that - people can change. Good thing byrd didn‚Äôt just resign.
@MakeItPlain I officially hate almost all of the democratic candidates. They self-serving and self-righteous and i can‚Äôt imagine any of them as president. Still hoping for Beto, but will vote a non-Trump republican if i have to.

@CoryBooker Mind your own business, Cory Booker.  This is very self-serving and I have lost respect for you.
@OfficialCBC He's had more than three decades and has used them to DO better in every way.  What exactly should he have done about a three decades old photo?  Put is on his campaign flier?  He was a democrat running against real racists.  I don't think that would have helped.
@kylegriffin1 That's five I'm not voting for.  Their self-serving and self-righteous condemnation sickens me, especially those just weighing in now, as thought it was their idea (Warren).
@hickforco @jaketapper What a sad thing, when a lifetime of helping people can be erased by one photo 40 years ago.  I guess if we allowed people to change and grow and learn, then we couldn't feel all high and mighty and better than everyone all the time.
@Comey Said the king of speaking out when he should keep quiet.
@rnelson0 @thedailybeast Maybe.  We don't really know.  In 1984 I was racist, too, although I didn't know it.  Doesn't mean I am now, and doesn't mean it erases everything I've done since then. I would hope to be judged on a lifetime of dedication to helping all people, not on one day in 1984.
@thedailybeast This article is fact-free and does not show any "real" racist Northram underneath.  It just assumes. Why is one photo stronger than a whole lifetime of working for inclusivity and the benefit of children of all races?  Why is a person not allowed to change?
@kylegriffin1 And I will not vote for a single one of them.  Either quick to make self-serving judgements, or quick to jump on a bandwagon when they saw the winds blowing.  At this point, Larry Hogan would have my vote over any of them.
@ewarren Late to the bandwagon, but quick to jump on it.  What spine.  No vote for you.  This is pathetically self-serving.  He didn't call for you to resign over your Native American mess.
@rnelson0 @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham I don't think Northram is a racist.  I don't think it's fair to say a person can't change, when the evidence of his entire life and policy decisions says, not racist.  He's not pushing confederate monuments and border walls - he's pushing healthcare for poor children.
@MarkWilkbank @OptioTriarii @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Idiot.  The KKK was not "left."
@lyfeasebbie @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham The racists hated Northram too.  It won't matter much.  But I don't think Fairfax will win a second term if Northram resigns over this.  I guess he is the one who will need to decide whether to back Northram or not.
@ggqt3 @PaulSaucier9 @WeWantClean Sorry, but I have one (a ten year old) and I'm not so sure.
@SenGillibrand How self-serving.  A person is allowed to change.  Northram has shown nothing but respect for all people, and has evidenced no racism at all in almost 40 years.  Just the opposite.  It is you who show no respect for those who elected him.  Butt out.  You've lost my vote.
@adamcbest Speak for yourself.  Why can a person not be allowed to change and grow over 40 years?  This is not a person pushing racist policies under the guise of security or preserving monuments.  This is a person who has long helped people and fought against racism. Condemnation is wrong.
@bllyrush @funder Not sure how that is relevant.
@tribelaw It should be up to the people of Virginia. We elected him. And he‚Äôs been doing a damn good job. So butt out.
@IntjUnimpressed @HuffPost It‚Äôs so self-serving.

@HuffPost She just lost my vote. Anyone so quick to judge, and in such an obviously self-serving way, does not need to be president.
@JRubinBlogger Republicans stay loyal hoever big a shitbag the guy is. Thing us, it works. It‚Äôs how they have maintained power with a minirity and the worst president ever. Maybe dems should stop falling on the sword so often. It‚Äôs not working for us.
@EWErickson @gtconway3d Agree. It‚Äôs not exactly excusable, but the facts of his work and policy decisions have shown inclusivity and the opposite of racism. I still don‚Äôt think he should resign. Also because it would make virginia confederat aholes really happy.
@thedailybeast I still strongly feel he should not resign, if only because it would make way too many racist sexist confederate assholes happy.
@PaulSaucier9 @WeWantClean @ggqt3 My neighbors give all their kids assault rifles on their 10th birthday.  It‚Äôs ok though cause they go to church.

@jcbraun1 @rnelson0 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Probably, yes.  But if Northram resigns with no input from him, and sort of slinks away in shame, I feel republicans will take the next election and we'll get a Gillespie.  As of right now, Fairfax has not said anything. How he reacts will have a big influence on people.
@VaBlackCaucus @joshtpm I have not seen anyone excusing the pictures.  But they do not necessarily call for resignation.  Certainly not without any input from the lt. governor.
@sannewman @joshtpm They will win - VA is a tenuous blue state at best.  A dem governor who slinks away in shame is a sure recipe for a republican governor next time.
@thehill @NAACP Perhaps NAACP would have preferred Gillespie?  Or Stewart?  Perhaps they should have the courtesy of shutting up and butting out at least until Virginia's first black lt. governor can make a statement.
@OptioTriarii @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham And Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.  People also forget that Virginia was part of the South.
@jcbraun1 @rnelson0 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Not true.  Fairfax was a big deal, at least in Northern VA.  Do you even live in VA?

@Judeless77 @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham That's my feeling exactly.  Fairfax could be more than filler, but not if Northram slinks away suddenly.  Maybe if Northram stayed and Fairfax ran next term.
@jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Thank you but I am well aware of who the lt. gov is.  If dems slink away in shame, and Fairfax is suddenly thrust into the governship, it won't stick.  And I have no idea what hundred year old clan history of a racist southern state has to do with today's VA - we are now blue.
@rnelson0 @jcbraun1 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Wow, you can't see the difference between someone whose actions and policies are inclusive and anti-racist, but took a racist photo 40 years ago, and someone who still believes that we should have slavery.
@jcbraun1 @rnelson0 @DerrickNAACP @AprilDRyan @NAACP @RalphNortham Northram has stood up to racism.  The photo does not change his actions and policies over the years since.  Unless Fairfax starts calling for it, he should not resign.
@kylegriffin1 Butt out, Kamala Harris.  This is very self-serving.
@CapehartJ @AprilDRyan I would like to hear what Fairfax has to say.  I think everyone else, especially self-serving presidential candidates, should butt out.  We elected him, not them.
For all those non-Virginia's calling for Northram's resignation, BUTT OUT.  He is OUR governor.  Personally, I'm waiting to hear what Justin Fairfax has to say.  If he calls for Northram's resignation, Northram is probably done for.  If he backs him, he should stay. https://t.co/v79ZmQw3ni
@jaketapper @jaketapper do you really have nothing better to report on??
@mkraju We should wait for Virginia's AA community to weigh in. WE elected him.  Everyone else should butt out.

@theworldindex @AndyRichter All the top countries are both more democratic and more socialist than the USA.
@funder It's not up to you.  VA elected him, and we get to decide when he leaves.  When Virginians call for his resignation, then he will resign.  You butt out.

@JulianCastro @AprilDRyan That's not up to you.  The people of VA voted for him.  His policies have been inclusive and helpful to people of all races, and he has actually stood against racism here in VA (which is rampant, btw).  WE will decide when leaves, not you.
@MrFilmkritik It's VIRGINIA.
@jaketapper Perhaps Castro should mind his own business.  The people of Virginia voted for him, and WE should get to decide how long he stays.  Castro is just pandering for votes.  I will not vote for any democratic candidate who calls for Northram's resignation.
@RalphNortham PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT RESIGN.
@funder No, he doesn't.  Such knee-jerk reactions are what gives us more republicans in power - all they have to do is dig something up and a democrat leaves.  Dems need to start fighting for what they believe in, and Northram has been helping people, not passing racist policy.
@Ancient_Entity @AP Yeah, it's bad.  Kind of hard to believe he would be so stupid, even in 1984.  He probably won't win election again.  But his life since then earns him something.  It will hardly be swept anywhere, but he should not resign.  The VA GOP really IS the KKK, not just in costume.
@sdeitch @AP It DID work for Kavanaugh.		Plus, he tried to rape someone and then lied to congress.  		Moreover, Kavanaugh as a nominee was despised by the majority of Americans and nominated by the least popular president in history.		None of that is true of Northram.
@bllyrush @funder The Russian economy is not terrible by Russian standards, and people there are used to hurting.  It's like a way of life.
@keyoproducer1 @MrFilmkritik Yes, probably - especially if his policy positions were harmful to minorities and his political accomplishments involved primarily giving more money and power to old white men.  But Northram's are just the opposite.  And if he leaves, we get the real KKK - the VA GOP.
@DeplorableBabe @AP Please take your white supremacist symbols somewhere else.
@politico I can't believe there are more tweets about this than the fact that our president is a Russian asset who is attempting to dismantle the safety and security of the United States.
@TheDemCoalition @GOP This is the guy who suggested that when he found out Marla was pregnant with Tiffany, he wanted her to have an abortion.
@jaketapper @RalphNortham I hope to hell he does not resign.  That will leave the GOP here in VA in charge very soon, and they are racist as hell.  That photo is the ONLY thing racist about Northam - you can't point to a single action or policy move since then that would suggest it.
@AP What he says is true - his whole public life since then has been about the exact opposite of racism.  A person is allowed to grow and change and learn.  His actions since then speak to his character more loudly than that photo.
@RalphNortham please do NOT resign.  We've got Trump, Steve King, and all the rest and they aren't resigning.  I don't know if you have a good explanation for that stupid photo or not, but if you resign you hand VA to GOP, and they are definitely racist and will govern that way.
@Skepmi @MrFilmkritik Then you will hand VA to republicans, who are definitely racist, right now, not in 1984.
@MrFilmkritik I hope he does not resign.  He's been a good governor and his actions as such have definitely NOT been racist.  He has helped people of all races.  Dems have got to stop apologizing and being f***ing boyscouts all the time.  That's how we get Trumps.
This.  As a Virginian, I can say that Northram's actions have been anything but racist.  He has nothing but try to help people of all races.  Hopefully actions over many years speak louder than a 1984 photo.  It's not like he raped someone and then got on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/8dp9Eu3Z7n
@AOC lol @AOC didn't know she was supposed to be bought.  I guess she's doing it all wrong.
@krassenstein Sorry, but I disagree.  Northram has led an exemplary life in which he has helped people of all races, is popular with people of all races, and is known as a person who is selfless and caring to everyone.  He should not be defined by one photo from 1984.
@BillKristol Imagine how it's going to be when today's Facebook babies start running for office.
@AP I'm sure Republicans will jump all over that, but first they might want to look at who's in the oval office.  They hypocrisy is about to be overwhelming.
@JuddLegum But everything Northram has done since then has been about helping people of all races, and his actions as governor have been anything but racist.  In 1984 it would have been considered in bad taste, but there was not this sensitivity to racism.
@jaketapper @BillKristol @SymoneDSanders @finneyk @KSoltisAnderson @TheLeadCNN No, Beto does.
@bllyrush @funder Yes, he is actually.  And very very popular in Russia.  He's just not our friend.
@bllyrush @funder Neither the US nor Russia have complied 100% but it kept things minimal and diplomacy and threat of sanctions have worked excellently in the past to keep the arms race at a standstill. Do you actually trust Trump?? I‚Äôd probably trust Putin more - he‚Äôs a liar but logical and smart
@SusanSolomon Because putin wants it and trump is a russian asset
@bllyrush @funder Attempting to bring them into compliance was the only reasonable course of action. Going back to the arms race is a step backwards for the whole world and puts every man woman and child in more danger.
@joshscampbell How come 30% of Americans are dumb enough to believe him?
@bllyrush @funder Because backing out alliws them to build without limit and gives no leverage at all for compliance. It simply releases them. That‚Äôs what Putin wants.
Seems like a move a Russian asset would make. https://t.co/72yNu8BZXd

@atrupar Democrats need to think about that messaging, especially the abortion part.  If it is repeated enough, it will be believed.  It's not enough to have truth on your side.
@ironstowe Also, they are apparently planning to take a lot of the fencing down.  		https://t.co/tnTs7SXz9X
@ironstowe Well, in any case, we certainly want to model ourselves after North Korea (currently ranked at the bottom of the world for both democracy and quality of life).
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump Let's please find the intelligence chief who will admit he told Trump he was misquoted.
@atrupar Yes, but we don't need to read the transcript to know he's lying and his supporters CAN'T read the transcript, so he can get away with it.
@thehill omg they are literally wearing their racism.
@thehill I wonder how he will feel if Trump decides he won't step down.
@HuffPost It's more like telling her she has to earn her A instead of buying it.
@TIME Will they  next argue that God has ordained Trump to be the ruler of the USA and we can't impeach or unelect him?
@EdKrassen They mainly rank higher than us in quality of live and level of democracy.  They are all more democratic than we are.  The US is only about 70% democratic and is labeled a "flawed democracy."  Most of the above are 90%+ democratic and full democracies.
@eterry28 @JoyAnnReid @TiffanyDCross @YouTube Unfortunately, recent environment, education is treated as barrier, support, and also cause of barrier, and then it is charged with creating equal access.  But in reality education is not cause of the barrier has little power to remove it and not enough support to overcome it.

@thehill It's not a terrible idea.  She's not talking about handing out money to people, she's talking about investing in education and other infrastructure needed to lift African-Americans out of the poverty they were left in after the end of slavery.  It's needed whatever you call it.
@washingtonpost I'd be angry too if I had to listen to her for a living.
@EdKrassen Americans receive almost NO education in different forms of government and economy.  At best they learn cold-war era equation of socialism with totalitarianism, and are never taught the important relationship between democracy and successful socialism, such as in Norway.
@thehill He really has to stop broadcasting his naughty fantasies.  It's embarrassing.

@AidenWolfe Agreed.  Ronald Reagan was a more refined, less stupid Trump, but that only made him more effective at dismantling protections for the poor and middle class and making the rich richer.
@DailyCaller It does indicate a problem - rich white guy is arrested for betraying an entire country and putting all national security in danger, and he walks out without even paying bail.  A poor black man gets arrested for smoking weed and ends up sitting in jail for months without a trial.

@rosadelauro @RepMaloney @SpeakerPelosi Equal pay laws and such cannot work as long as we allow employers to force employees to sign agreements not to speak about their pay.  They simply give themselves a pass on the law by doing this.

@JoyceWhiteVance Hardcore Trump supporters are victims of our horrendous education system, which has barely taught them to read much less given them any ability to tell the difference between the truth and a pack of self-serving lies.  They also have no idea how govt works.
@AOC Americans have a sad inability to comprehend the difference between people who have been successful by profiting from a product or service and people who have been successful by serving the public.  That's pretty sad, as the two require completely different qualities.

@TopRopeTravis 1988 was the very end of the Cold War.  There was no such thing as a Russian oligarch then.  It is extremely unlikely Bernie would have had any contact then with any of today's oligarchs, as some weren't even born yet and the country was still communist.

@ironstowe Absolutely - this must be investigated.  It seems unlikely that no funds were actually withheld or diverted.
@rtraister @chrislhayes This event is not a "women's movement."  Instead of supporting women, the organizers have bonded over scapegoating another group - Jews.  No true civil rights movement relies on tearing down others.  Sadly, so typical of the problem women have supporting each other.
