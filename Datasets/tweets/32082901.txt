I am so grateful to have become friends with such an amazing soul.  In 1995, Dr. Thaler and his wife established the Thaler Holocaust Memorial Fund whose mission it is to educate colleges about the Holocaust. Please consider supporting their fund as well. https://t.co/SLu6QoFZQ6
Dr. David Thaler and I wrote each other after my graduation and remained friends.  Then one day in 2000 a letter arrived in a different hand‚Äîit was from his wife, Joan.  She shared the news of his passing.  It was the end of a chapter for me.  Holocaust.
To this day I remember that moment and the emotions that welled through me and they are as raw as they were that day over 20 years ago now.  I was honored that he chose to share his story with me.  It felt intimate and it felt as though we were alone in that room.
His frail, aging frame stood before the class as he introduced himself saying that he had not spoken about his experience to a class before and so he was going to talk with his one friend in the room to make it easier on him‚Äîthat friend was me.
Our professor said we were having a special speaker that day‚Äîalways a welcome break from everyday lectures.  But what I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was who would be speaking.  My friend walked onto the stage and was introduced to the class.
A sweet man who was thoughtful, intelligent and kind.  Over the course of the years and through our many classes together we became friends.  But it wasn‚Äôt until my History of the Holocaust class that I was truly introduced to him.
Toss in the influences and impacts of religion (one of my minors) on the war and you had me hooked.  I took several classes and in each of those was an older man who was auditing the classes with the students.  By older I mean grandparent age.
Throughout our lives we meet people who have immeasurable impacts on us‚Äîdeep impacts‚Äîthe kind that pierce your soul.  When I was in college, I met such a person.  One of my majors was history and I was particularly interested in WWII‚Äîboth the European and Asian sides of the war. https://t.co/053FEnTu8R
