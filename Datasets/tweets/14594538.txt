@dangheesling should've been a two time BB winner-he's played amazing, mist-filled games.  #bb15
Chickens have been more significant in the BB game than bunnies so #bbchicken  #bb15
At least Elissa was the one who finally gave McCrae &amp; Andy the experience of being nominated #bb15
The longer Amanda's in #bb15 the sloppier her appearance becomes. By the way, immature and trampy is no way to go thru life.
Hm, this seems like this is a game for the guys. #bb15
Candice remembers to wish GM a Happy Birthday and also hugs Aaryn - now that's pretty classy but they will still bash her ruthlessly  #bb15
For once Amanda the big mouth doesn't have much to say - sweet!  #bb15
Will the Bear shirt return to #bb15 ?!
CBS should give Helen a powerbar to eat before she plays in the returning jury member challenge #bb15
Ok so Helen has had her not-so-great moments but overall she is a really decent person &amp; loves #bb15 so I wish her luck.
The jury member who returns ought to get 1 week immunity from eviction to give them a real 2nd chance or they'll be out immediately #BB15
Great - now we'll be subjected to more creepy Clownie on the night feeds.  #bb15
Amanda loses again - here comes another whinefest from her about her competition performance frustrations.  #bb15
Jessie is a well-spoken HG &amp; she really did the best she could w/the hand she was dealt. Wish she could've stayed longer in the house #bb15
Amanda is getting uglier &amp; uglier. It won't be entertaining TV if she makes it to Final Two with her bully-ish ways.  #bb15
What a schlubby looking group of HGs tonight. Did they forget it's a live show?  #bb15
Yeah, I'm over Helen in this game. What a disappointment she turned out to be.  #bb15
Ugh Jessie, you don't want these people to be your "2nd family"!  #bb15
Aaryn/GM fight brought to you by Jessie &amp; them being a Have Not - ha!  #bb15
Andy denied an HOH room reveal showing on an episode. That's funny. #bb15
The self-righteous HGs are justifying Y they were right 2 evict Judd. Now the claws will come out &amp; they'll start to eat their own. #BB15
Aww, look at all the fake sadness - give me a break. Sorry Judd, you were betrayed for no good reason. BOO!!!  #bb15
If Judd goes at least he'll take his grizzly bear shirt with him. #BB15
Aar is obviously unprepared - what the heck has she been spending her time thinking about if not planning the next move?! #BB15
Another low blow crack about Candice being adopted from GM. Shame on GM, she is TRASH. #bb15
Candice has a right to say whatever she wants b4 the vote. GM interrupting only makes GM look even more foolish than she already does #BB15
Time to practice some deep breathing...it's DOUBLE EVICTION night on #bb15
@persianqt  At http://t.co/L4sdTYlfvn on their Big Brother page under HOH Blog.
If you drink every time you spot a spelling error in GM's HOH blog post, then you'll have to be treated for alcohol poisoning! #bb15
Ama's behavior during POV is Y I will continue 2 vote her as 3rd nom if Amer is  MVP. I was a fan of hers @ 1 time but no more. #BB15
Way to be a Sofa Nazi there, Ryan. Thanks for your service to our country and all, but get a grip &amp; control yourself in the future! #RHOC
Amanda nailed it, Ash is 30 yo &amp; put herself in a bad situation-Y didn't Ash answer Cha's calls? Ash crying victim is laughable #Princesses
Ashley sees the girls approaching @ the winery &amp; she bolts yet somehow they're supposed 2 know she needed "help"? How silly #Princesses
Ashley from #Princesses is about the MOST ridiculous &amp; idiotic person in all of reality TV. Don't know if I can watch a 2nd season w/her.
1 of the most unintelligible explanation deliveries by an HOH during nom ceremony ever - &amp; GM has nerve 2 criticize Candice's voice  #bb15
What's up with no "We love you Howard!" from Helen?  She evengave Jeremy that send off! #BB15
So long Howard, we hardly knew ye. Good luck on the outside, glad you escaped that snake pit aka #BB15
This would be the week that the #bb15 HGs get a Pandora's Box if Aaryn's noms are not popular...
Hi Big Jeff - lookin' as cute as evah :)  #BB15
Let's see if Aaryn keeps her deal with Helen about letting Helen choose the noms if they vote out Kaitlin instead of her today. #bb15
Come on people, don't start voting yet for 3rd nom until AFTER the HOH game!! @bb15
Kaitlin could've gone farther in #bb15 - she gave up the game for a worthless showmance. Live and learn, I guess.
Of course Nick is watching, GM, he's got to know when it's time to get the restraining order. #BB15
Does Judd's grizzly shirt have its own Twitter account yet??  #BB15
It irks me 2have2 watch the scene again where Elissa acts like a jerk,lies,and rats out the work her alliance is trying to accomplish #BB15
Rude much, Elissa? If u didn't find Amanda entertaining then Y continue hanging out w/the group? There was no need 4 ur mean comments. #bb15
Done w/Elissa-hope she's evicted asap from #bb15 -Obnoxious &amp; stupid gameplay on her part 2day. Feel bad 4 those in an alliance w/her.
Kaitlin is a threat to the other side of the house, she's good at comps - Aaryn could end up being safe again for another week. #BB15
Happy for Judd!!  He could have an easy HOH week because America's nominee will likely support what the house is wanting anyway.  #bb15
Be smart #bb15 voters - don't put all your votes in one basket in case the 3rd HG wins Veto - have a back-up HG to be the replacement.
America gets to nominate the 3rd HG?!  This will send sobering shock waves throughout the #bb15 house. It's gonna be great!
Drinking the Have Not milk and drinking the wine saved for those coming off HNs is what made it easy to vote you out, Jeremy. #BB15
Good job #bb15 on evicting "Jermy."  He's the champion of ringworm apparently.
So glad I stopped reading #RollingStone by the late-90s. They have become such a dumb joke. Wouldn't line a bird cage with that rag.
YAY HELEN!!  Whew - that was a nail biter!! #BB15
15 seasons later and I STILL get a nervous stomach when it's time for the HOH competition! #BB15
Relieved that Nick is being evicted over Elissa or Helen. It'll upset Jeremy, Aaryn &amp; GM and that's good. Way to go HGs! #BB15
Not cool @CBS for only showcasing Aaryn's vile remarks while leaving out Spencer, GinaMarie &amp; Jeremy who have been awful too. #bb15
Holy Hershey Sterling Cooper! #madmen season finale was GOOD!

SHUTUP KIM! Sooo over her whining about something that Brandi once SAID when she never acknowledges what she once DID to Brandi! #rhobh
Appreciating #TAR acknowledging that last week's mission was insensitive and for apologizing.
Sorry #TAR but that was a horrible roadblock mission - thanks 4 the reminder though that capitalism is freedom &amp; comm/soc is oppression.
Please Kim, like u weren't the happy pot-stirrer @ Mauricio's party by blabbing what Brandi said 2 Paul &amp; Adrienne. #rhbh

Great, now Ian can buy a ton of hammocks &amp; B a weirdo N the lap of luxury #bb14 officially sux @Dangheesling was robbed, glad he got $50k.
It's harder 2 win #bb14 if u can't rely on winning comps. @Dangheesling was out the door asap unless he went ruthless. I hate bitter a jury!
Ian = Wannabe. Ian had a cake walk while @Dangheesling was dead man misting the entire game and had to fight the whole way. #bb14

Hoping Rachel's mouth doesn't cost her the game during Jury questions. #bb13
Hmm, Adam, I don't know about that (about u winning against Rachel). Kinda sounds like Adam is gonna vote 4 Rachel now though. #bb13
It won't be a landslide 4 Rachel no matter who she takes so it's a matter of who she feels better about winning $50K or $500K. #bb13
I've been rooting for Big Booty since the Fast Forward...way 2 final HOH and good luck to her winning the game! #bb13
I will never forget NY-DC-PA. I promise. God Bless America.
Goooo Big Booty (aka Rachel)!! #bb13
Jordo, ur a class act.  Way 2 make it to the final 4.  You've got nothing 2 prove, girl, b/c you've already WON this game before :) #bb13
Adam has won 2 Vetos and an HOH and came in pretty close in a couple comps, so it can't be said that he's not a competitor.  #bb13
Win the next Veto Rachel or Jordan (or Adam, as long as he doesn't plan 2 flip on R&J)!!! #bb13
Congrats Adam. Please don't screw over R&J who have saved u and helped keep u in the game this long.   #bb13
Kalia's game is over mostly b/c of her choice 2 align w/Dani. Adam spared himself from a bad alliance, she shouldn't b mad @ him that. #bb13
Way 2 stay strong Adam and way 2 survive the suffering that is being hounded by Kalia. #bb13
Sorry Shelly, ur arguments 4 ur actions r weak. U could've gone much farther if u hadn't of backstabbed. #bb13
Oh this is gonna be a fun HOH to watch! #bb13
Face it, u know u look 4ward 2 Rachel's goodbye messages, which are never dull-lol #bb13
Um Shelly, when u don't win comps, ur in NO position to make "big" moves b/c u can't protect urself after u strike.  #bb13
Haha - they skipped Porche's "who wants to see my HOH room"  That fame ho is gonna hate being denied that screen time. #bb13
Hot Jeff w/his zingers & common sense will B very missed-Only silver lining is getting thru BBAD super quick by ffwding scenes w/P/K/S #bb13
Poor Jordo, comes N 2nd place N back-2-back comps. Meanwhile do-nothing, muffin top Porshe finally wakes up from napping & gets lucky #bb13
Forget it Shelly, u used ur alliance while crying holier than thou about ur supposed integrity & THAT makes u a lying rat #bb13
At least Big Jeff won an extra $15k and hopefully America's fave prize b/c he made the big move in the game. #bb13
Rach & Dani R both a piece of work but at least Rach is more entertaining & doesn't troll around & whine N the kitchen like Dani does #bb13
Yeah Daniele, u know all about being pushed ahead, huh?  Considering that "Amer Player" helped u out in ur 1st season. Short memory. #bb13
THANK U Jeff, Jordan, Rachel & Adam!  Bye bye Whinele! #bb13
Shelly's a liar, not a straight shooter as she claims. If u flip, then fine but own up 2 it instead of being a 2 faced backstabber.  #bb13
Um, there is video footage of Dani repeatedly planning to get Jeff out. He has every right to get her out first while he can. #bb13
YES!  Hot Jeff is that much safer and that's all I care about :)  Way to go Brendon, you earned it and now Rachel will cry less too! #bb13
This season would be so lame w/out Rachel,Jeff & Jordan.  Vote 4 Brendan 2 return as backup in case Rachel doesn't win against him. #bb13
Jordo comes through! Way 2 b HOH!  So happy to get to watch Jeff in the game for at least 2 more weeks :)  #bb13
ED will redeem himself w/me IF he gets Brenchel out AND helps keep Jeff/Jordan in. #bb13
Is Dani mute this season or what?? #bb13
Bananas!!!  Ode to Casey the Angry Banana from BB 11!!! #bb13
Well hello Jeff. Thanks 4 helping me have a happy summer :) #bb13

STOP showing feelings Jill or Kelly's head will explode & she'll wear more fur vests & eat more candy. Satchels of gold, yo. #rhny
ICAM! RT @atmegs  Kelly translation - it's okay for me to be a hypocrite #rhny
Newsflash LuAnn ---&gt; Royal titles are lame. Get over yourself.   #rhny
Reasoning w/Kelly is clearly a waste of time. Her mind is 2 warped & she's in bigtime denial. I feel so sorry for her daughters. #rhny
Danielle is just a hustler and will do most anything for a buck. Jacqueline is right about her glomming onto people with $$$.  #rhnj
Now Kim G. will claim that Bravo edited her to be two-faced. To quote Danielle, "LOL - whatever."   #rhnj
It would be comical if Kelly's nuttiness was an act, but she is delusional for real, and it's so sad that she's raising kids. #rhny
Yeah, LuAnn, Bethenny DID apologize and yet you STILL bring up her calling you a snake every chance you get - GET OVER IT! #rhny
Happy Flag Day!  "You're a grand old flag, you're a high flying flag..."  #tcot #sgp #912 #teaparty #beck #rush
Kelly, you posed for Playboy, so spare us all the "holier than thou" attitude you have about one night stands.  #rhny

Dang, Donald.  Announce the winner and that's it?  No time 4 them 2 comment or see them celebrate? I was rooting 4 Holly, oh well. #celebapp
I feel bad 4 the 4 ladies. Their vacay in paradise gets interrupted trying to cope with the ramblings & mood swings of a sociopath. #rhny
Now I get it...Kelly is a bonafide sociopath. Seriously, that's exactly what she is. I feel bad for her kids because she needs help. #rhny
Oh come on, Kelly. Surely u picked up some photography tips during ur Playboy photo shoot, but u know nothing of 1 night stands, huh? #rhny
It's called a goody bag, you twit, and it's a very nice gesture which you are too stupid to appreciate. I can't stand Kelly!  #rhny
Good job, Sandra - I was rooting for ya!  U especially deserved the mil when u tossed Russ' hat into the fire :) #survivor
Yay!  More psycho-obnoxious Kelly fun for next week!! #rhny
Vintage Kelly rears her ignorant, nutjob head. On 1 hand she's a buzzkill, but on the other hand I could laugh in her face all night! #rhny
"She's renewing her buzz..." LOL - that's why I'm on Team Bethenny! #rhny
"Waiter, may I have a pitcher of the Femme Fatale please?"  That's the only way I could get through this date if I were LuAnn.  #rhny
So why doesn't Kelly lecture Jill & LuAnn when they're gossiping and calling them sick & demented?  What an idiot. #rhny
Oh Kelly, I hate to agree with Ramona, but it's true--you have NO brain!  You are truly a stupid person. #rhny

@agrodner22 EVERY TIME there's a low road 2 take, Gnat tavels it. Most.Despised.HG.EVER! I'm w/Jeff, "It's Over." #bb11 #bigbrother
@agrodner22  Well, guess I have more free time on my hands cuz I ain't wasting a moment watching BB w/Jeff gone & that POS as HOH. #bb11
@agrodner22  U take a powerful story like Pan's Box & use it 4 a LAME lux comp? U suck bigtime Grodner. Say byebye 2 ur ratings. #bb11
Request 2 BB fans:If U ever run n2 Gnat after show is over, PLEASE try 2 find a bug 2 throw on her so she'll remember she's despised! #bb11

Jeff might need his Cross and Holy Water 2 keep that blood-sucker Gnatalie at a distance. #bb11
Why didn't BB include a pic of each HOH when they were in high school since that's the theme this year?  #bigbrother #bb11
Hope Russ wins Veto 2 B safe this wk & force house 2 vote out Gnat.Keeps #'s good 4 Jeff/Jor/Mich 4 the following wk.Then ditch Russ.  #bb11
Couldn't agree more! RT @realitytalk ...too soon to send Russell home.They should wait until next week. Get rid of Natalie as planned! #bb11
Once again, BB8/Jen has rocked the unitard best over BB9/Sheila, BB10/Michelle & certainly Lydiot. #bb11
Pay attn Kev...Gnat just indirectly admitted that she made up story of Mich approaching her & Jess in green rm 2 save Ronnie. #bb11
@agrodner22 It's crappy&unfair that Mich's HOH was cut short.She was denied many HOH luxuries b/c of the 3 twits' drama. U owe Mich! #bb11
I hope Russ & Mich give J/J plenty of alone time in HOH room so they can cuddle which always seems 2 rejuvinate those 2. #bb11
Sure Gnat,u couldn't wait 2 leave Mich's HOH rm reveal-that's Y U & Chi were last 1s 2 leave b/c U spent 20 mins bashing Russ 2 Mich #bb11
What a satisfying BB wkend so far ---&gt; Jessie gone. Chima gone. Jordan HOH, so Gnat or Lyd likely 2 B gone.  Good job, Jordo! #bb11
No tears 4 Chi.She KNEW bout myst pwr b4 she played 4 HOH.Should've not won if she didn't want her HOH affected.She screwed herself. #bb11
@agrodner22  BB loses credibility of having control over the HGs if they continue 2 allow Chi/Nat/Lyd 2 bully production.  #bb11
Jef/Jor/Mich/Rus can't destroy Chi/Ly/Nat's property but they can mess w/Jessie's! BBQ his t-shirts & watch the twits flip out! #bb11
I adore Jordan - she laughed when Ronnie cried & laughed at the 3 loser twits 4 crying over Pinhead - way 2 keep ur humor girl :) #bb11
Come on BB, make another AC rewards contest so America can vote 2 give Jeff more love & further upset the 3 loser twits! #bb11
These 3 R good 4 weight loss b/c they make me lose my appetite w/all their hypocrisy, stupidity & bitterness. #bb11
Best ep of BBAD ever! LOVE that Jess' pic is gray & that 3 twits R bawling & embarrassing themselves on TV over that idiot! #bb11
HAHA - once again Jessie got owned by America - THANKS  AGAIN 2 those who voted Jeff 4 CdT!! #bb11
Gnatalie, the "18 yr old" says she didn't lie.  Way 2 ramble there in your speech Jessie - I LOVE this! #bb11
Jessie wore a special t-shirt for the event. Guess he's at peace about it - lol!  #bb11
Good grief Jordan, is it THAT big of a surprise 2 U that Jeff is the Wizard?  Jessie looks absolutely SICK - LOL! #bb11
CH-ima's definition of a "strong woman" is 2 hate men & think women R superior which isn't what gender equality is about. #bb11
So glad Chima's COH (Czar of Household) regime is OVER!  #bb11
Level of digust is steadily rising, ready 2 tell this Govt: GO FISH YOURSELF!   #tcot #iamthemob #fishy #handsoff #912 #sgp #teaparty
Chi will B(but shouldn't B)mad @ Jeff 4 using CdT if she puts Jeff up as nom replacement.Lyd/Russ/Mich/Kev will owe Jeff 4 bootn Jess #bb11
I hope Russ wins so he can take himself off & that Chi puts up Jeff 4 replacement.Then J uses CdT & rocks Jess/Nat/Chi's world! #bb11
Veto comp 2day: looks like Gnat,Jeff,Kev R playing w/Chi,Lyd,Russ. Praying Nat doesn't win so Jeff can put up Nat/Jess on Thur! #bb11
Chi better watch it w/the threats she's making 2 BB bout acting up on Thur if CdT is used-she could get penalty nom'd 4 the next week #bb11

Ok, I will congratulate Chima on her CD 'cause Purple Rain is still an awesome soundtrack even 25 years later. #bb11
Oh Chima, too bad you don't know that the Coup de'Jeff is gonna steal your thunder during your entire HOH reign :)  #bb11
"Who wishes that Chima would lose her voice for a week?!?!"   #bb11
LOVE YOU SO MUCH JEFF - Way to put Gnat on the spot!!!! #bb11
Hey Gnatalie, 1985 called and wants their plastic hair clip back you makeover-needing, two-faced, lying flea! #bb11
So Chima is this yr's BB10/Michelle who cried out "This is for you Jessie" when she won HOH. LOL-Chi's HOH is meaningless #bigbrother #bb11
And hey, Lydia, do U ever plan 2 not B one of the 1st ones to be eliminated from a competition this season??  #bigbrother  #bb11
"I hate you Ronnie"  --&gt; Michele got the last word in - HA! #bb11
Chima now knows 2 things: she's not the wizard and neither was Ronnie. She'd better choose her noms VERY carefully!  #bb11
Good that Chi is HOH-she can't play next wk & Jeff can nom 2 boot either Jes or Nat & some1 from other side has better chance 2B HOH!  #bb11
THANK YOU 2 everyone who voted 2 award my BB boyfriend the CdT :-)  Buh bye Ratfink - No Jury House 4 U! #bb11
Can u imagine the scrambling they R doing N the editing dept 2 get appropriate footage of all the fights ready 4 Thurs show?!  #bb11
So did Ronnie get more screen time 2nite b/c he's waaaay behind in CdT votes and they're trying 2 get him some more? #bb11
So Jessie, not dressing up for the Veto ceremony this week?  Idiot. #bb11
So tired of "I'm smarter than he/she is" BB, pls give IQ tests so we can crack up when it turns out that Jordan has the best score! #bb11
Just a friendly reminder to #VoteJeff before the voting cuts off tonight! #bb11
Jess thinks Mich isn't interesting? This coming from dull-to-the-core-no-personality-having Jessie. #bb11
@RoraBorieAlice  Ooo, forgot about that...I didn't see her either. Wonder if that was intentional b/c of the R&C fight? #bb11
So they named Jessie "Jessephus"  Heh heh - remove the p in that name - heh heh #bb11
Tonight's BBAD is the gift that keeps on giving.  #VoteJeff  #bb11
RatFink is getting his ugly cry on - LOL  #VoteJeff #bb11
Russell, you have missed the mark. It ain't Michelle who's the problem, it's Gnat & Jess but you've got a blindspot 2 them  #VoteJeff  #bb11
Gnat, I'd B nervous if I were U-it's just a matter of time B4 ur schemes&lies catch up & U face the mob.She won't B able 2 handle it.  #bb11
Can't believe this season finally brought the bigtime drama. Sad that BBAD is over in 45 mins :(  #VoteJeff #bb11
Watch out people-it's still possible 2 receive a penalty nom & vote, not 2 mention immedate ejection! Don't let the Rat stay #VoteJeff #bb11
Wow Kevin - way to finally come alive!  ----&gt; #VoteJeff #bb11
Gnat on the hot seat protesting too much.   ------&gt; #VoteJeff #bb11
Um, Chima & Jordan...if U suspect now that Russ & Ron are working together, then why wouldn't U boot Ron 2 break them up?  #bb11
Chima, Michelle just backed you up 2 Russ. You owe Mich now - tell Russ that Gnat & Jess lied about Mich!!!! Do the right thing!! #bb11
Rampant cases of "selective hearing" in the BB house. They hear what they want 2 hear & treat it as the truth.  #bb11
Be tough Michelle!!  #VoteJEff #bb11
If Russell is lame enough 2 B duped by a pinhead like Jessie, then he deserves to lose this game.  #VoteJeff #bb11
"When everyone starts lying, all you have left is trust" Jessie the D-bag quote on 8-3-09. Yeah. Seriously. &lt;eyeroll&gt; #bb11
Being a Have Not is wreaking havoc on Jess.Apparently slop,squid,squash,steel bed&cold H2O R his kryptonite cuz he's losin' it.  #bb11
Hey Ronnie, Louis Skolnick called and he wants his hair part back. #bb11
LOL - #voteJeff and relieve him of the stress of worrying about winning HOH :) #bb11
Russell is smart. Even if he's not catching scheming, he knows where everyone is & who's talking/whispering 2 who. #bb11
"Be vewee quiet, I'm hunting wats!"  RT @NY_Watcher  Russell is using his Hunting skills like Elmer Fudd #bb11
Goooo Russell!  "Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man..."  LOL #bb11
Jessie thinks wrestling is seductive.  He must've read about that in the "Neanderthal's Guide 2 Impressing Stupid Women." #bb11
Jeff on a rant is so entertaining :)  #VoteJeff 2 b the wizard if u wanna see good TV! #bb11
UGH! Stop the stupid little girl/baby talk Lydia - you sound ridiculous!! #bb11
Jeez Lydia...I was hoping getting hit by the diploma numerous times would knock some sense n2 u. Stop wasting time w/Jessie! #bb11
Laughed SO hard during 2nite's BB episode that Ron & Gnat picked boxes w/nothing inside during HOH comp--HA!!! #bb11
Chi 2 Mich "People make s--- up" It didn't bother Chi when Jess/Nat told her about the LIE they made up about Mich & told 2 Russ 2day. #bb11
Loving the Team Jeff avatars!  Way to show support for the cutest BB guy evah :)  #bb11
It's been a super crappy night for Jessie ever since the live show began. Couldn't have happened to a jerkier guy. Rock on #Jeff !! #bb11
BB shouldn't have told HG bout myst powr.If alliances R smart they should scheme NOW bout what 2 do if 1 of them wins b4 it's announcd #bb11
Man, does Jordan realize how unbelievably fortunate she is 2 B in that house with #Jeff getting all that attention from him??? #bb11
@Cfahooligan I'm guessing she's N splash room regretting saying all the smack Russ overheard her say about him the other night :) #bb11
Jess thinks Mich was hinky Casey vote b/c she yawned when she came out of voting?  WHAT A FREAKN IMBECILE HE IS!!! #bb11
I hope Amer voted for squid & squash, but I suspect it's liverwurst & licorice. #bb11
I hope Casey will B sitting home laughing @ Gnat saying, "Go fix Jessie a bowl of slop."  #bb11
Gnat-get.over.yourself. If ur bf breaks up w/u b/c of HaveNot sleeping arrangements, then ur relationship is weak and ur still stupid. #bb11
I think Russ genuinely likes JefJor. In their deal, Russ threw in Jor w/out Jeff asking. Right now I think Ron&Lyd will B the noms. #bb11
Um, I took the "Which BB HG R U?" quiz, but I feared they were gonna label me Lydia so I quit b/c I am SO not her!! #bb11
See that Ronnie...ur name wasn't in the hat b/c Jordan is a decent person & not a scumbag. Learn a lesson doofus. #bb11
Lydia - you have moved from needy & annoying to downright ridiculously pathetic for volunteering 2 B a Have Not for Jessie.  #bb11
Good grief Jordan, you put Jeff's name in the hat??  Jeez, do NOT vote Jordan for CdT - she'd be a disaster!! #bb11
So did Jordan win power to draw names for Have Not as a HOH comp prize??	 #bb11
Don't reward two-faced, self-righteous, game-disrespecting, egomanical bullies - SUPPORT JEFF & JORDAN!  VOTE JEFF! #bb11
Jeff is worth the $10 text votes people!!!!!!   #bb11
Jeff, you shall have the POWER!!!!!!!!!!	 #bb11
Go Jordan-Go Jordan-Go Jordan. If it's endurance, U don't have 2 b the smart crayon or think, just HANG ON & don't give up girl! #bb11

Ratfink is the boy who lied wolf.His credibility is shot.He could say it's 2009 & no one is sure if he's telling the truth or not. #bb11
@LyndseyN09  Ratfink Ronnie loves to play the victim role.   #bb11
Lydiot: queen of beating a dead horse & holding grudges lectures Casey that he should let it go. Hypocrisy is ALWAYS the invisible HG. #bb11
Ronnie the master debator: deny, refuse to respond and further engage, then walk away nervously smirking.  #bb11
Wish BB had Amer vote 2 reward certain HGs so all HGs would know who is liked most-Like how Janie/BB6 won stuff that made Yvette cry. #bb11
Work it Casey! No offense 2 sweet Jordan but Casey staying is WAY better 4 breaking up the Jockstraps & booting Jessie the Tool. #bb11
@icrazycanuck  THAT rocked!  #bb11
Is it known if Gnat truly has a boyfriend, or has she lied about that like she lied about her age?   #bb11
I miss the Sho2 commercial during BB8 w/the "I'll give you something to remember" song to promote Showtime original shows. #bb11
@gingerkiller  I could not agree more. He hasn't learned anything about how 2 be a decent person after his BB experience last summer. #bb11
@missknits Jeff's loyalty 2 Jordan is sweet but she's a drain 4 him & I want Jeff 2 make F2-he could do it if he didn't hav2 carry her #bb11
Jordan's a doll but she's weak-gamewise it'd be better for Jeff/Mich/Kev/Lyd to keep Casey to help breakup the Jockstrap alliance. #bb11
Re: Casey's HG imitations, how does he overlook Jordan constantly playing w/her hair?! #bb11
Jessie takes more time to pray over his food than the time he puts into his booty calls with Lydia.  #bb11
Casey called Ron "Teflon Ron" because nothing sticks to him - lol!!  I will sooo miss him if he gets voted out this week. #bb11
I like Casey, but him as an "angry smoking ba-man-na" is hilarious! #bb11

@MargieThiel I hope so! ACORN is obviously riddled w/webs of far-reaching corruption & they MUST be stopped-Go Glenn & Bill! #tcot #sgp #912
Good work CA voters who said NO to more taxes! Way to stand your ground! #tcot #sgp #912

@ladymisssusan I think the ankle-biters & tweens (who are the majority voters) will give it to Adam, which I can understand.  You?
Seems like this is gonna be a close race...  #ai #idol #americanidol
Wellll...I believe I like Kris' version a little better than Adam's despite that Kris' voice isn't as powerful. #ai #idol #americanidol
Ok, here goes w/the "apples 2 apples" performances. Sounds like an okay song.  #ai #idol #americanidol
Um, I don't need #idol 2 inspire me 2 think about the state of the world & what the future brings-Get over urself Fuller.  #ai #americanidol
Not bad at all, Adam. The guy can definitely hit the high notes. #ai #idol #americanidol
Yeah, I can co-sign on Kris singing this song. #ai #idol #americanidol
Good call, Adam. This was my fave performance from him this season.  #ai #idol #americanidol
A financial feet freak. Watch out Jillian!  #bachelorette
Yay! ABC bringing back "Wipeout" this summer. That show had me cracking up!
@KathrynDarden  Went 2 TRF yesterday. I liked the Castle tour. Didn't realize about the dressing up part b/c I've not been 2 a RenFest b4.
@Lisaleh Wow, she has a lovely portfolio on her site. Thanks for the link.
Sierra reminds me of a cross between Drew Barrymore & Kate Hudson looks-wise. #survivor
@Lisaleh @zegolf  I do. I believe that took place in Central Park.  #survivor
I sooo miss the times when Jeffy was more cheesy and flew in on a helicopter to deliver the votes for the finale - lol #survivor
Debbie, you've been a liar in this game. Shut up about being honest.  #survivor
I'd throw away a vote from Coach 4 me just 4 the chance 2 tell him where he could shove his dragon stick.  #survivor
The part I anxiously await at the end of every Survivor...Final TC where the jury speaks their peace!!! #survivor
Woah - JT seemed 2 receive some LOUD body language from the jury! #survivor
LOL-I still look to where they place the pen on the parchment 2 figure out which name they R writing. #survivor
@jessewm  Not to my knowledge. I thought 2nd place was still $100k.   #survivor
Mind your balls Final 3!  LOL! #survivor
No offense, but if someone doesn't want 2 hear a show's spoilers, then Twitter is the last place they should be hanging out at.  #survivor
Final immunity game used 2 run 4 a long time. They've adjusted that game so it doesn't take hours & hours anymore. #survivor
Hoping during reunion Jeff holds Debbie&Coach accountable 4 saying Sierra lied when she told JT&Stephen about D&C recruiting her #survivor
LOL - funny how fallen comrade lets us see castaways who were no longer named in the opening credits if they didn't make jury.  #survivor
Ahhh...the walk of the fallen comrades. total tradition. #survivor
Daaannng...well, I'm with Taj - if Erinn outwits her way into final 2, then I'm rooting for her to win.   #survivor

@dcdecker No, it's not easy 2 watch some1 B so ill, but it's a chance 2 reflect on how precious the time is that we're given 2 live.
hmm, seeing her w/most of her hair gone wasn't as "shocking" as I thought it coud B. Her famous hair doesn't trump her soul! #farrah
Mr. Fawcett is gettin' 2 me. His devotion 2 #Farrah is so touching. #farrah
#Farrah & the other Angels were a part of my childhood. So sorry she's suffering now. It's brave of her 2 record her fight.
The Office season finale starts in 15 mins. Thursday nights will be a little less fun for a while...

Well, now Victoria knows that her father is an old adulterer, so let it go Luann. #rhny
Kelly seriously lacks personality. I can barely stand 2 listen 2 her. Could she be more rude..."I don't want a tissue" Forget U then! #rhny
It's so difficult 2 follow along w/what Kelly tries 2 say. The girl struggles to speak in full sentences & her point gets chopped up. #rhny

Why don't they just give it to Adam now & spare us any more soft sounds from Kris & Danny's goofy dance moves  #americanidol #ai #idol
Allison was robbed.    #americanidol #ai #idol

@Kafrine Basically Randy gushed about Allison & Simon gave this reasoning that didn't make sense 2 explain Y he disagreed w/Randy.
Kelly is crazy & there's no talking reasonably w/her. Bethenny is right, K is from another planet. #rhny

Best of the night:  Danny, Allison & Adam.  #americanidol #ai #idol

Danny's voice was made for this style of music, IMO.  #americanidol #ai #idol

@AJae @VioletLilly  They sure like the gray color for their website! Thanks 4 the link.
@Violetlilly Hmmm, unemployment benefits...I wonder too. That should bring Alex & Simon's shopping sprees 2 a halt 4 a while.
@rightwingchick Nah, they'll figure out a way 2 reinstate him @ DunMif eventually, I think. It'll B fun 2 see him on his own 4 a bit :)
@AJae @VioletLilly Seems like she'd have 2 B in order to make enough $ to keep up w/her RH co-star's lifestyles. NYC ain't cheap!
@rightwingchick  Hm, that's all well & good I suppose, but you better be caught up on The Office - afterall Michael quit!  lol ;-)
@AJae @VioletLilly Oh yeah, she wears fancy boots on the basketball court - what an inspiring role model!
@AJae @VioletLilly I believe he's a hotel manager.
@AJae @VioletLilly She said that her family would be ok as long as Simon has his job. Don't they make $$ from being on Real Housewives?
@AJae @VioletLilly A couple weeks ago I read that Alex lost her job at Victoria's Secrect due to company layoffs b/c of economy.
@AJae @VioletLilly If I were Bethenny, that's when Kelly might've had a drink tossed in her face after that insulting remark.
@AJae @VioletLilly  That's why I like Bethenny best. She's not perfect, but definitely most down-to-earth & honest of the bunch.
@AJae @VioletLilly These Housewives have some warped ideas abt what's respectful/appropriate/proper ettiquette - they ALL have social flaws
@AJae @VioletLilly Oh come on now Alex...no excuses...Simon's tennis game is lame!
@AJae @VioletLilly  Bethenny called it - Ramona is freaking out even if she is faking being calm.
@annakate22 Focus your energies on fighting the good fight & know that you're not alone :)
@SarahDownSouth Ooo, yeah, that's a tough film 4 ADD/ADHD to sit through :)
@AJae @VioletLilly She sure does!
@SarahDownSouth I was in bed getting over a sinus infection at the time, so I was a captive audience for it - lol
@AJae @VioletLilly  Kelly's daughters seem more mature than her!  (And didn't know Simon was Australian, I thought British)
@AJae @VioletLilly  That was a wickedly good idea Bethenny had for a substitute!
@SarahDownSouth I did (good memory!)  I'd rate it about a 7 out of 10, I guess.
@AJae @VioletLilly I found myself agreeing w/Bethenny's assessment of Jill's apt.
@SarahDownSouth I "read" that movie on the movie spoiler website :)  Seems like it had a sort of interesting plot.
@AJae @VioletLilly They sort of remind me of Carrie & Stanford from SATC. I'm w/Jill, don't like the new coffee tables Brad picked.
@AJae @VioletLilly  I've not watched MillMatch before. So it's good?
@AJae @VioletLilly  I'm watching the latest NY Housewives episode right now - are you watching it?
@AJae @VioletLilly  Oh geez LuAnn, I'm sure these young girls from Brooklyn will dream of becoming a Countess one day. Get over yourself!
@AJae @VioletLilly  Agree!
@AJae @VioletLilly Yeah, no question Simon is at least metrosexual, if not gay!
@AJae @VioletLilly  LOL - maybe her height is what she meant when she told Bethenny that she (Kelly) was "up here"
@Violetlilly @AJae Yeah, it was something like that. Way to be "up here" Kelly!
@AJae @VioletLilly  As strange a couple as they are, I think Alex (of Alex & Simon) is most sane housewife.
@AJae @VioletLilly I think Kelly got in trouble recently 4 some spat w/a boyfriend. Couldn't happen 2 a nicer twit - lol
@AJae @Violetlilly  I think LuAnn is stuck up too. And I'm on Team Bethenny, Kelly is nuts!
@karpo Well shoot, that's disappointing.
@Violetlilly Sorry 2 butt in, but I was surprised by it. So was she when she rec'd an EMAIL from him saying he's in luv w/Ethiopian woman!

@sdn16182 If I were Mari, I'd have had a very hard time agreeing 2 B on the show 4 fear that a secret like that would B revealed!
@sdn16182 Well I'm kinda wondering if Mari's ex-bf from high sch who was so possessive was perhaps a pimp of sorts so I thought it was past.
@taxman300  It's definitely in the top on that list! Still a cool tune to jam along with today, IMO :)
@laurakbarr  Is that the Tyranny book? I've been hearing about his book all day, Rush raved over it.
@sdn16182 Yeah that's a tough thing 2 overlook/dismiss but Jess is wrong 4 deciding that's all there is 2 Mari's past life-People do change
@sdn16182 That's a very bold accusation for Jess to make about Maricela, but I believe Mari when she says that Jess needs help!

@KHill215 I believe room rates normally start around $180, so yeah, $99 is pretty darn good!

@SarahDownSouth Yes! It blew debris over the hwy & all kinds of tree branches on the roads. The storm has passed but it's still very windy!

@SarahDownSouth Also, try drinking some diluted apple cider vinegar.It's claimed acv helps fight infections.B sure 2 rinse mouth afterwards
@SarahDownSouth Oh, and avoid dairy as much as possible 4 now. Milk is a mucus-builder & you need to rid mucus asap.
@SarahDownSouth Zinc lozenges are nasty-tasting (like Coldeeze), but they really work for me. Sorry 'bout ur throat, I know it's miserable!
@SarahDownSouth Maybe 4 a little relief 'til the meds kick in 2 clear the virus, try sucking ice chips. The ice may help numb the soreness.

@profound_brew  LOL!!!! (ok, people sick/dying from salmonella is NOT funny, but big props for that little joke!!)
@robints Just want to say good job on the interview this morning with Michael DelGiorno. He should be on Twitter!

@TraciKnoppe Oh, I love that song - good playlist add!
@tygerbaby Those are the best kinds of playlists because of the fun surprises that one can come across :)
@tygerbaby Oh wow, haven't listened to that song in ages!
@britneyfrancis  I can only hope everyone has learned from the Katrina tragedy and that it's never repeated. Have a good night.
@britneyfrancis Well, you're seriously misinterpreting then, and that's unfortunate b/c it hinders holding a civil, intellectual discussion.
@britneyfrancis ...to hold local gov't accountable & instead place the blame fully on Fed Gov't is what is hard to understand.
@britneyfrancis It's a fact that the delayed help at the local gov't level contributed to delaying Fed Gov't assistance. Why you refuse...
@britneyfrancis Please refrain from making ridiculous conclusions. I never stated that anyone "deserved" suffering.
@britneyfrancis Much of the suffering was preventable, but dependent people didn't know how to prepare & the local gov't failed them on that
@britneyfrancis It's people who fully depend on the Fed Gov't to take care of them who fall apart during disasters. That's the real truth.
@beulahgg  I didn't see the entire show, but no, I didn't see anything mentioned about KY during the portions I did catch.
@Hail_Mary_Jane  Nah, no more comebacks. I don't want to distract you from further killing brain cells by replying to me. Goodnight :)
@britneyfrancis The suffering was tragic, but nat. disasters occur yearly & most people don't fall apart like that. Y was NOLA different?
@Hail_Mary_Jane  Well, "dope" works to both describe the person and substance in your case - be sure to take a toke in my honor :)
@britneyfrancis The real concern is re:Mayor/Govnor/citizens inability 2 better prepare 4a hurricane 4a city under sea level w/weak levies
@Hail_Mary_Jane   I know smoking dope is stupid & illegal and could impact the ability to properly spell a word such as "you're."
@britneyfrancis  LOL - I love that you're so frustrated that you revert to foul language when losing a debate - you made my night, thanks :)
@britneyfrancis  Yeah, you should be focusing your energies on continuing to blindly worship your Obamassiah. Goodnight :)
@britneyfrancis Go right ahead & cling to a conveniently warped recall of history 2 suit your agenda since u don't care about facts.
@britneyfrancis Don't bother trying 2 race bait b/c I don't fall for that. I expect him & fellow libs 2 fail us & yes they live up 2 that.
@britneyfrancis Yeah, guess he's 2 busy forcing USA further into socialism 2 B concerned about a natural disaster killing Americans.
@hohner At least it helps keep me from overeating since I get so nauseated by it all - lol!
@fourstringfuror I kinda figured, but thought I should verify. She & Robert Plant won a Grammy 2nite & I was happy 4 her.
@fourstringfuror  What about who? Sorry, couldn't tell which tweet you replied about.
@britneyfrancis The people who've suffered/died due 2 winter storm STILL haven't heard from O,but that will never be rapped about, I'm sure.
@britneyfrancis The mayor & governor failed to act & dropped the ball. FEMA wasn't perfect, but Katrina was hardly Bush's fault.
@profound_brew  I hear she's a quality performer in concert - hope to catch her show one day.
Yay for Allison Kraus!
@dahwg  What was wrong with it?
@KateOH  Gotta nominate Sarah for that gig :)
Y was Lil Wayne ripping on Pres Bush re:Katrina in his rap? Hasn't Obama raised up some liquor & beads 2 multiply & rebuild New Orleans yet?
@profound_brew  Couldn't agree more :)
@unterekless Ahhh, gotta love poodles...my mini-poo just strolled in the room to visit me :)
@lauraelizabethm I was thinking that those 2 girls have dating a Jonas Bro in common, don't they? Did they date the same one?
@penguinponders LOL - for real! I'm switching from the Grammys to Desp. Housewives in about 10 mins, then ending the night by reading too :)
Calling it a night....gotta get up in the morning and get ready to do some special shopping :-)

@stix1972 Oh, I didn't know that. And that was after he parted with Van Halen?
@rickbizzell  I thank God for his voice as our country was formed!!
@stix1972  Ahh, I see. Didn't know being red was associated w/the Cards. Sammy's a small business man, so he may very well B 4 smaller Gov.
@meanolmeany  I guess since they're not acting like animals then the MSM doesn't see it as newsworthy.
@stix1972 Do you mean "red" as in, Republican, or something?
Hmm, 3 new followers all w/the same exact initial update "So this is Twitter, eh?"  Um, BLOCK!!!
@stix1972  Wellll...Golden Earring's Twilight Zone was fairly popular, so they may barely escape being considered one hit wonders maybe??
@stix1972  That is an excellent tune!
@RightGirl  Sad country music & alcohol don't mix well!
@RightGirl  I have that song on a country classics CD, it's a tearjerker. Sorry for your loss.

@rightwingchick  You're on :)  I completely heart Dwight Schrute!!!  I lost it the other week when he claimed that IHOP was socialist! LOL!
@stix1972  Good song!
@rightwingchick  No problem! I could quote the heck out of that show & love to chat w/other fans about it so I wouldn't want you to miss it!
@rightwingchick Definitely!  According to the preview that NBC showed, it appears that there's a real fire in the DunMiff Scranton office!
@rightwingchick  I'm not exactly sure, but it'll be at least 20 mins I think.
@rightwingchick  Don't forget that there is a special episode of The Office airing during the Superbowl's halftime!!!

@rightwingchick  I just saw Elf for the 1st time this past Christmas and LOVED it!! Such a sweet movie :)
@rightwingchick @moms4sarahpalin  And Starskey & Hutch where he played that perverted guy in jail - lol!
@rightwingchick  It's a comedy about 2 teen girls' involvement w/Nixon & Watergate-totally fictional of course. My teenaged niece liked it.
@moms4sarahpalin  I do! Thanks :)
@rightwingchick   I enjoyed his cameo in "Dick" too - that was actually a pretty good movie, especially for Gen-Xers.
@SarahDownSouth  That's happened to me. I HATED Austin Powers when I first saw it in the theatre, but then I grew to really like it!
@rightwingchick Yeah, Blades of Glory wasn't as good. Come to think of it, I never saw Kicking & Screaming either...
@SarahDownSouth Really?? My brother highly recommended it.  Hmm, might have to read some reviews I guess.
@melindaloomis  That's my plan too - I will rejoice bigtime the day I pay off my one last card balance!
@rightwingchick  Same here. Haven't seen Talladega Nights or Stepbrothers yet, but I plan to!
@rightwingchick And when he's running to get to the station, he knocks that guy out of the way for no reason! SO funny!!
@stephenkruiser Goodness, so besides the 3-D effects, they want people to Twitter too?  I guess watching the game isn't all that important!
@melindaloomis "Whameeee!"
@rightwingchick  @melindaloomis  My niece & I love saying, "I immediately regret this decision."
@melindaloomis  "Even the guy who can't think says something!!!!"
@rightwingchick "Would you like to go to the pants party?"
@rightwingchick  "It's quite pungent...it stings the nostrils."
@LeBeau0605  "Time to musk up..."  LOL
@a99kitten  Oh yum, I miss having their mexican pizza, but I'm trying to eat better these days. Enjoy it though :)
@rightwingchick  "When in Rome..."  :-)
@LisainDallas There are conservative comedians out there, just not nearly as many as raunchy, liberal ones.
@rightwingchick  "It's a deep burn...I can barely lift my arms because I did so many."  LOL - yeah, lots of great lines :-)
@mikeus Oh, I'm not surprised, but it never ceases to amaze me nonetheless. I mean, they have SO much more material to work w/ b/c of Dems.
@LeBeau0605 RT-SarahDownSouth "You know it doesn't work with just any black guy, right?" (SNL on GOP & Steele)
@LisainDallas  Good call! But they don't have the guts to joke about one of their own like that. #tcot #sgp
@rightwingchick "People know me...I have many leather-bound books..." LOL - I watched Anchorman earlier ;-)
@SarahDownSouth  Y'know, that little joke could B a sign that they're a bit freaked out by the RNC now. #tcot #sgp
Well, SNL just tried to insult Steele. Classy. #tcot #sgp
SNL Weekend Update on now - time for more love to O no doubt. Talking Blago first.  #tcot #sgp
@rightcommentary  Congestion was awful in Reston, but yes, I've driven the Beltway MANY a time and I agree it's beyond the pits.
@decidedlyright Ohhh, I used to work near the Reston Town Center once upon a time :)  You're right, it's a lovely place but hellish traffic!
@rightcommentary  Glad you had a chance to educate him!  #tcot
@rightcommentary  The friend seriously didn't realize that???  #tcot
@rightcommentary  Yeah, I guess the "tax-challenged" are struggling w/patriotism right about now.  #tcot
@LizMair  Perhaps he was referring to the illegals there? (I used to live in NoVA so I know all about them!)
@rightcommentary  Tell 'em to wake up and smell the dissent (which is patriotic according to Hillary, right?).
@SarahDownSouth They've praised O in almost EVERY skit so far! Thou dost over-praise, so who R they trying to convince, he won right? #tcot
@WomenGunOwners  Always happy to support our military - good night :)  #tcot #sgp
@DianeDurdaller The pop-culture fan in me is making me hang in there 2 C the SNL Update 2 C if they rip on O in that skit. #tcot #sgp
McaGyver on MacGruber was kind of cool.
@SarahDownSouth  Nope, it's not just you, my friend!
@WorthyWire Oh, you're killin' me!  I already have about a gazillion fonts - lol!
@DianeDurdaller Steve,I want 2 think fondly enough of U but U just had 2 insult Bush, didn't you? Martin really is "The Jerk" LOL #tcot #sgp
They couldn't manage to get through the skit without mentioning Pres Bush to stir up some laughter b/c O is so lame. #tcot #sgp
SNL getting ready to start. Let's see how much (if at all) they're willing to rip on O and his ridiculousness. #tcot
@Flap  Poor Campbell, desperately trying to be relevant even if it means adding to Rush's notoriety. #tcot
@retiredfirecapt Ahhh, okay. Yeah, I'll bet it's a thought that weighs heavy on his mind!
@retiredfirecapt Did Rahm say this in an article or in a TV interview?? #tcot
@rightcommentary  LOL -reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where George thinks the zinger "jerk store" that he thought up is a real winner :)
@SarahDownSouth Oh for sure - wouldn't be surprised at all if the Tracy Flick character was inspired by her!!
@lynj65  Cool new avatar - way to celebrate the new Chairman :)
@SarahDownSouth What did U think?I thot plot was unique & acting was superb. The story took turns I didn't see coming-I like black comedies.
@a99kitten Love to quote lines from that movie, it's very funny :)
@beulahgg Oh yes, I can listen on 650AM & watch it on the GAC cable channel. It's great to see the show live in Nashville though :)
Was watching Anchorman: Ron Burgundy but putting it on mute because it's TCOT conference call meeting time!!  #tcot #sgp
@beulahgg I grew up on country music and have always listened to it. Thanks for the link :)
@SarahDownSouth Oh, I like that movie!
@velvethammer  You came to mind today while I was watching the movie Cocktail when Brian mentioned a velvet hammer drink in his poem :-)
@WorthyWire That sounds about right in terms of the world heading into the End of Days...
@SusanHW I believe Michael Savage was in a legal battle against CAIR. What a disturbing organization. #tcot
Anyone planning a special Superbowl feast? Last year we did Mexi-fest, this year it's a spread of Italian dishes.
@SharonDay  So happy for you (and the RNC) - Congrats!!
@jenuinejen Exciting? Not really, but I am looking forward to watching the Superbowl (game and commercials!). How 'bout you?
@RightGirl That reminds me of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry discovers that he always comes out even  :)
@lavellecollins For sure-the LAST thing they want is for conservatives 2 unite & organize & that's exactly what's happening! #tcot #rncchair
"TCOT, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"  Congrats to Chairman Steele!  #tcot #rncchair
@lavellecollins  They're totally intimidated and trying to dump on our moment to distract & discourage us but it won't work!
This feels like a Friday soap opera ---&gt;CLIFFHANGER - lol!  #tcot #rncchair
@rightwingsparkl  You're so right about that!
RT-Brooks&Dunn R promoting CaseForAmerica.com. A program to revive small-town independent businesses & all things "Made in America." #tcot
@decidedlyright  I agree. My family ran a small independent grocery store when I was a teen, so I vividly recall how people bought sodas!
Saying a prayer right now that the very best candidate is elected RNC Chair. If you pray, please do so as well.  #tcot #rncchair
@decidedlyright  I'm from southern MD & we said soda. I recall a few who said Coke referring to sodas in general, but no one called it pop.
@spcghst440 Hey, I thought today was Jan 30, not April 1 ;-)  #tcot
Brooks&Dunn R promoting CaseForAmerica.com. A program to revive small-town independent businesses & all things "Made in America." #tcot #sgp
@rightcommentary So would you say he's a nice guy? He seems nice, but you certainly can't judge by the characters they play on TV, y'know?
The headline of "Penpals" w/side-by-side photos of O & the Iranian nutbag underneath on TCOTreport.com is HYSTERICAL!!!  :) :) :)
@erconservative   It must eat them alive to have to beg for the Repubs' support even tho they have the majority - I'm loving it! #tcot
@rightcommentary Cool! Did you get to speak with him much?
I'll be watching The Office in about 5 hours and I'll be happy  :)
@rickbizzell  I suspect there will already be less viewers of the Superbowl if so many people are still without power over the weekend!
@spcghst440  I feel the same way.
@michellemalkin I'll bet he will AND it'll have some "Ofc of the Pres" patch sewn on it lest anyone forgets that "he won." HA! #tcot
@jimmiebjr  Love that quote you shared in the beginning, I hadn't heard that before.
All those who voted against the SPENDING package (I refuse to call it "stimulus") should be sent a message of thanks & encouragement  #tcot
@RedCountyBlogs You'd better believe if I had a kid in school I'd contact them 2 make sure that crap like this wasn't taking place.
@streetlightlily Yep, that would impress me as well - good catch!
@SarahDownSouth Good! I like to hear that more women are taking measures to protect themself.
@MelissaTweets Ohhh gawd - yes indeed about her!!
@MelissaTweets LOL - I think many a band over the past 30 yrs or so can offer that kind of hope :-)
@donnaastern  I no longer assume that the 2nd Amend will always be protected, so I'm taking action to embrace that right!
@SarahDownSouth  Uh oh...hope it's not on the dreaded "do not eat" list!!
@stephenkruiser HA!  You're right about that!
@MelissaTweets Oh jeez, that song and We Built This City - UGH!!!
@donnaastern  Go for it.  I'll be joining that club soon myself  :-)
@chenenko  LOL!! Yeah, there goes the making of such strong, responsible leadership, huh?
@readmylipstick Glenn Beck has been warning of this same thing over the past few days. It's so NOT where America should head! #tcot
@itsonlywords Definitely - he soooo lacks a poker face so it's easy to tell when he's aggravated.
@itsonlywords  What I like most about Ann is that she gets under the skin of the Left & they react to it b/c they know she has their number.
@CathyNagle  Thanks, that's a nice thought to fall asleep on :)
@MelissaTweets Spreading malware? Is this redistribution of pc attacks?
@LisainDallas LOL - my pleasure :)
@alamocitypundit Ahhh, so true. I think Rush is gonna play a big role in getting us through these next few years!
@SarahDownSouth I love how Rush welcomes listeners to his show now by mentioning that the Pres has instucted us not to tune in - lol!
@CristaHuff Praise God!!
@alamocitypundit  I thought Rush's economic proposal made some good sense. I suspect O is too arrogant to even considerate it though. #tcot
Don't know if it's already been tweeted about, but if you heard Rush's proposal today to O re: our economy, what did you think?  #tcot
@rightwingsparkl  I agree. It really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
#tcot PLEASE CALL Your Senators!  Sen. Alexander's office just told me they've rec'd A LOT of calls re: NOT confirming Geithner!
@bearfanron This guy's going on a flippin' media tour & b4 u know it he'll garner all out sympathetic support instead of held to corruption!
Goodnight all - here's to great coming week for everyone!  Keep up the conversations, we're only growing stronger :)  #tcot
@JillMe Oh, it's good that it's melting. Bad weather makes for very unpleasant morning commute!
@deadvoter "Who turns down a Junior Mint?!"
@CristaHuff  When you've seen a movie over & over then the fun becomes quoting dialogue. I quoted Best in Show when it was on earlier today.
@RightGirl  Junior Mints? Why they're very refreshing (according to the gang on Seinfeld - lol!)
@rockingjude  I'm sorry to hear this. You're in my prayers.
@JillMe Just watching TV and hanging online...basically doing the Sunday wind down thing to prepare for the new work week. How 'bout you?
@JillMe  :-)
"I've spoken my peace and counted to three."
"Is you is, or is you ain't my constituents?!"
I invented moral fiber!PappyO'Daniel was displaying rectitude & high-mindedness when that egghead you work for was still messing his drawers
@SarahDownSouth  Well, I'm no fashionista, but I do like spotting the pretty & not-so-pretty gowns, hair styles, jewelry, etc.
@SarahDownSouth It was O Brother or the SAG Awards. I couldn't stomach the SAGs after watching the egos in some of the red carpet interviews
"doooo - not - seek - the treasure"   "Weee - thought - you - was - a toooad!"
@RalphReagan  My family loves that line about "I don't mean to be tellin' tales out of school...." It's fun finding situations to use it in!
"You ain't our daddy, not since you got hit by that train." "Mama's got a new beau." "He's a suitor!" "Mama says he's bonafide."
@RalphReagan "Thank God your mammy died givin' birth to ya. If she'd seen ya, she'd have died of shame!"
"Them Si-reens did this to Pete. They loved him up and turned him into a horny toad!"
"They a fine bunch of boys. They sang in da yonder can and skedaddled."
@profound_brew  It's part of a good movie soundtrack!
@dmzdan Cool!
@RalphReagan "Mrs. Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T"
@BearTwinsMom  Yep, I agree! I didn't quite dig it in my younger years, but I truly appreciate it now :-)
@RalphReagan  I'm discovering some lines that are relevant to life right now such as, "Who elected you leader of this outfit?"  LOL ;-)
"Me and the Soggy Bottom Boys is steeped in ole timey...'I am the man of constant sorrow...'"
@readmylipstick  Thanks for the info on FB on sending Sarah Palin a b-day card for her b-day on 2/11. Mine will be in the mail tomorrow.
"Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. It's 2 weeks from everywhere!"
"You men from the bank? Daddy says I'm supposed to shoot anyone from the bank...I nicked the Census man."
@meanolmeany Bwahaha!
Ahh, "O Brother Where Art Thou" is on now.  Another movie I enjoy quoting!
"What Shih Tzus need rescuing anyway? You don't see Shih Tzus straggling around the streets in an old coat, 'help, alms for the poor'"  :-)
"...Bow Wow - delish!  Bow Wow - some dish!"
"I'll tell you what, if you come into my neighborhood dressed like that then you'd better be a doorman."
@CristaHuff Prayers lifted up for them. Keep us posted!
"You obviously don't know my dog. There's a pet store downstairs?What you are you, a wizard? a genius? Why didn't you tell me that before?!"
"We have you down for a queen."  "What are you suggesting my good man?!"
"Harlan Pepper, if you don't stop namin' nuts..."  LOL - LOVE quoting this movie!
Dang It!  I missed the first 18 mins of "Best In Show" At least I caught the song, "God loves a terrier." :)
@Divapalooza Oh, I love her "Bad Girls" book series!  She's an awesome lady :)
He's a rather crude goofball, but Dane Cook can crack me up. Watching his latest special on Comedy Central.
@lauraelizabethm LOL!!
So the pagent moved to Vegas, practically hidden on a cable channel, and has Mario Lopez hosting &lt;sigh&gt; How & when did it go wrong??
@BearTwinsMom   I think it looks like a tacky wedding dress.
Congrats to Miss Tennessee for making it to the top 3 - too bad she didn't win the crown. Oh well.
I'm not feeling the black sashes the contestants are wearing. I guess maybe they think it shows up better on camera.
@lauraelizabethm Yep, someone in Georgia needs to be schooled on how captialism ideally works.
Good for you, Miss Iowa, for saying that the Gov't. shouldn't make college be free.
Oooo, Miss America question time!!
@SarahA3347 @karpo   Yep, "change" is a word I could do without hearing for a looooong time!!
@SarahA3347 Hee hee :)  What would be your answer?
@karpo   I'd have to guess "historical."
@Mauricio_TN  I want the Mayor 2 identify all these companies who will happily do business in TN now that they don't have 2 speak english
@a99kitten I hear ya. I can only hope they are being as responsible as possible as long as they're breeding like this.
@a99kitten As a Poodle mom, I take some pride that Poodles seem to be  popular to be "hybrid" with (Labs, Cocker spaniels, Retrievers, etc.)
@nheater Great Odon's Raven!   :-)
Shout out to fellow fans of The Office: How funny was it last night when Dwight accused the IHOP restaurant of being socialists - LOL!
@bhdonovan It's beyond sickening to know some of my tax dollars are paying for them. I don't know how some politicians sleep at night.
@the_wild_gypsy I'm not afraid of O.I criticize him b/c socialism will ruin America & I refuse 2 sit by & let big Gov't take over our lives.
@MollyNichelson Where are the good ol' Alices who the Brady's hired when you need them?  LOL
@pinkelephantpun LOL - so true! Never thought of it like that, but now that you've said it, I won't be able to think of it another way!
@karpo You just KNOW he absolutely regrets selecting Biden - he deserves what he settled for - only the rest of us have to pay too :(
@karpo Well now, O can join the club w/those of us who have to get used to feeling "displeased," huh?
@RightGirl But sure, bring back the gloves because going retro is usually pretty chic :)
@RightGirl  A couple weeks ago I heard the latest trend is white nail polish & last week I saw a gal w/white nails and it did look cool.

@Gribbit Fran Drescher was just on Hannity saying she wants 2 replace Hillary & is considering running in 2010 if Gov doesn't pick her.#tcot
@streetlightlily I like Mitt too.
@lilliew Oh man, is she ever! She has added NOTHING to the panel's discussion that's notable - just spewing worthless rhetoric.
@MelissaTweets @EdDriscoll  Great. Now I'm eyeing my mini poodle looking for signs of her feeling blue.
I used to love Idol auditions, but now it's just - whatever.  I'm ALL about Hollywood week where the real drama takes place!
Paula Abdul is giving advice on what's "normal" to say?  Funny, considering some of the things that have come out of her mouth.
@jimmiebjr Thanks!
@rightwingsparkl  For real!
I'm told Rush will be on Hannity tonight. #tcot
@MelissaTweets I totally agree! They're not doing their kids any favors either.
@jimmiebjr @SarahA3347  Now I'm recalling the "You know how I know you're gay? Because you like Coldplay" scene from 40 Year Old Virgin ;-)

@streetlightlily I hear ya! I am sick to death of all their ads for the O. #sgpball
I kind of wish tweets could be longer than 140 characters. Maybe up to 155? 165? I wonder if O can make them give us welfare characters?
@KenWoodruff There was lots of prep for '08 yet a RINO still won the Nom. Primaries matter & we need to get them right.
Thanking the Lord for my CD collection, Twitter, SuperTalk 99.7, SmartGirls & The Office on TBS for getting me through 1/20/09!!
Thx 4 the Ball y'all & I seriously want to hug the inventor of Tweet Grid :)  #sgpball
I'm still trying to understand how McCain won the Repub Nom. The results from the Primaries need to be evaulated & addressed, IMO. #sgpball
Hi all. I would like to request "Friends in Low Places" by Garth Brooks please :) #sgpball
@KatieFavazza I wondered the same. TVGuide.com says Yes for Nashville.

The BALL is in our court!!!  Twitter Ball - January 20, 2009 - 9pm Eastern #SGPball
@SarahA3347   Was it the "IT Factor" on Bravo in 2001?  I did a quick search and found this article: http://tinyurl.com/75ckq2
Time to call it day, nite all :)
@SarahA3347 I don't recall that show off-hand. Was it a more recent program, or was it on a while ago?
Just composed & submitted my Thank You email for Pres Bush. I didn't expect to get teary about it, but that's what ended up happening.
@thinkingmonkey ROFL - many thanks for that much needed chuckle :)
Ocean's 11 is on. TV Guide says it's about a gang who organizes to steal $150 million. Sound kind of familiar???
@ScottDismuke LOTS of us feel that way!

@LeBeau0605 Ouch! Sorry your Sunday has started off this way!
@LeBeau0605 Amen!

@jimmiebjr I'm going to get a lot of crafting & other 'to dos' done since I'm avoiding TV for the next several days...
@jimmiebjr Yeah, maybe if it's a $200 question :)
@JillMe Don't know how long D&Bs has been there but I recall a game place @ Opry Mills where teens hang but there's no bar so prob not D&B.
@jimmiebjr That game show makes me feel bad about myself 'cause there are some subjects I know zilch about!
@jimmiebjr  LOL!
@Fussypants I forget how to DM!!  Grr!!
@jimmiebjr Hmm, did the Woodstock crowd sweep away the homeless from the "security zone" to make D.C. look clean & pretty like O is doing?
@JillMe It's located at Opry Mills so I get to do my part to contribute to the economy - hee hee!
@JillMe Hi :) I've been told it's like Chuck E Cheese for adults. Very nice menu and sophiscated games, bar, good for watching sports, etc.
Going to Dave & Busters this afternoon - never been before, but I hear they have good food & fun games.  Looking forward to it!
Forget Jan. 20th - the REAL historic event is Feb. 17th when TELEVISION CHANGES! Yes, they will!  ;-)
@lynj65 Yep, I'm seeing that happen too :(
Sooooooo HAPPY it's Friday!!!!!
@MelissaTweets Over the past years, I've realized more & more that I've had it w/"Forrest Gump" and his self-righteous attitude.

Okay, time to top off the Amer Idol premiere with some Office :)
@allenfuller Thanks. I was happy to vote Very Poor for that weasel.

Ahhh, the first audition and first rejection on the new season of American Idol was just shown - rock on!
@jenciTN 2009 is the 11th year that I haven't had a car payment b/c the Civic I bought brand new in '93 still runs well so I agree w/article

@moms4sarahpalin It angers me to no end that they seem to be getting away with their criminal activity.
@nheater  I was thinkin' the same thing...
@gibsongirl247  I agree!
They say that the sometimes the Golden Globes results predict the Oscar winners - we'll find out if it holds true this year.
@unterekless If it was a joke against Repubs, it would've gotten a standing ovation.
@martinigirl87 Yeah, he said that and then went on to complain about being overlooked for Emmys because of race {rolling eyes}
#goldenglobes  I LOVE that Mickey Rourke thanked his past & present dogs - that's so sweet and I totally understand what he means :)
@the_wild_gypsy Maybe Speilberg should do a movie about Madoff to try and earn some of his lost money back?
@the_wild_gypsy   I thought the same thing - lol!
#goldenglobes Wondering if Steven Speilberg & Kevin Bacon have had a chat tonight about being ripped off by Madoff?
@shanevanderhart Me either.  I think about renting the seasons on DVD for a weekend marathon, but haven't gotten around to it.
@unterekless For real!
#goldenglobes Kind of weird how it's so cold in many states right now, but they're sweating on the red carpet in mid-80's temps.

Good luck to the cast of "The Office" tonight!
Watching Golden Globes red carpet while eating potato salad and waiting for laundry to dry. Life ain't too bad.
I just ate fresh pineapple. Yummy & nutritious yes, but also kind of stringy and now I need some floss.
@pinkelephantpun Sounded like he's trying to lower expections re: his performance even more & still not offering specifics or substance.

Watching football to see who will play against the Titans next weekend and handling some "to dos"

@justmatthewj  Unfortunately I feel that way as well re: '08.
Just saw that Billary Clinton is going to press the Times Square ball 2nite.  Not the 1st time ole Hill has brought a ball down, I'm sure ;)
Wondering what Google's new year homepage design will be after '09 is over when they won't have "00" to use any longer?
@lilliew Weren't those clips of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly dance routines AMAZING?!!!
@michaelemlong Since his wife is finally proud of her country, perhaps some of that will rub off on him (we can HOPE he'll CHANGE, right?)
@justin_hart Enjoy the baked brie (my family had that for Christmas-yum!). I'm jealous over the fondue!
Watching That's Entertainment I,II,III on TCM. It's sad what passes for entertainment nowadays compared to ye olde MGM musicals, etc.
Alrighty, I've been given the okay to call it a year here at the office  :)
Any second now the boss is gonna walk out and announce the office is closing early for NYE, right?  Right???
This time next year, NYE will be on a Thursday which means 3 day weekend!!!
Happy New Year's Eve Twitterdom!  Make this last day in 2008 a good one!
Fifteen mins until "The Office" begins on TBS. Just sayin'  :-)

@shanevanderhart LOL-for real! It started when my 18 yr old niece shamed me in2 getting a cell phone w/qwerty keyboard for better texting :)
@SGPolitics I think it's wise to keep a close eye on leaders within the party and hold them accountable.
@shanevanderhart Oh, and I'm ready to finally get a digital music player.  I have & still use a walkman & discman occassionally - lol
@shanevanderhart It was a Christmas bonus from my employer @ the time. 	I like using a PDA but am getting embarrassed to use such a fossil.
@mgallops Something tells me he'll regret making such idiotic statements.
Researching the iTouch...it's time to retire my 10 year old Palm III -
@SGPolitics: Well if I don't matter to him (being a member of the "public" and all), then I guess my RNC donation$ won't matter either.Jerk.
@sophiadare:  Oooo, diluting it with juice sounds much more palatable, thanks for the tip :)
@sophiadare: LOL - I'm remembering Ross from Friends performing his "sound"  :)
@lynj65  I was going to watch that but don't have time to really sit and pay attention to it right now.
Wondering if I'm the only one watching "The Sound of Music" on ABC right now...
Just finished drinking a 2nd glass of diluted apple cidar vinegar - this better have the health benefits it claims to b/c it's rather yucky!

Choose whom you will serve because we ALL bow down to someone or thing. I cannot be bought, nor be fooled by smoke&mirrors or double speak.
How do u become informed about someone when that person hides info about himself? This is a time when what we don't know will harm us.
@fadedjeans How is Harrison doing today, Sandra? I'm praying for you guys!
Wondering if enough people are concerned by the numerous red flags warning us of danger ahead or are too many people BLINDED by said flags?
Looking forward to leaving work to get ready for The Office tonight.
