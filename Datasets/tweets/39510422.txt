Before serving in Congress, Pompeo was a successful business leader. He co-founded Thayer Aerospace, and served as President of Sentry International.
Pompeo graduated at the top of his Harvard Law School class, where he served as Editor of the Harvard Law Review.
Pompeo graduated at the top of his class at West Point.
Just over a year ago, 14 Democrats joined with the Republican majority to confirm Pompeo. They found him to be an appropriate nominee to lead our nations intelligence agency. Since then, Pompeo has rewarded their support with impeccable leadership at CIA.
He has already proven his ability to work closely with our allies in Europe and the Middle East to advance US interests in places like Iran and North Korea.
During his time leading the CIA, Pompeo oversaw crucial efforts to degrade and diminish ISIS.
While a member of congress, Pompeo served on the House Intelligence Committee, where he was trusted with some of the nation's most closely guarded secrets.

RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks said: 	 	All Americans owe Speaker Ryan tremendous gratitude and appreciation for his service in the House and his leadership as Speaker. He has accomplished great things for the nation.
The Republican Jewish Coalition will miss his leadership in Congress but will always be grateful for his commitment to Israel and his service to America.
Speaker Paul Ryan is a man of integrity who has always made his priorities clear and has never wavered in standing up and fighting for them.
America‚Äôs finest leaders are those who are rooted in the Constitutional principles and values of our Founding Fathers. Those principles and values are deeply ingrained in the DNA of Paul Ryan.

Taylor is now the namesake of the Taylor Force Act. A bill passed by the House, that would cut off aid to the Palestinian Authority until they stop their Pay for Slay policy.
The U.S. government gives the Palestinian Authority hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The Palestinians spend almost the same amount of money on paying terrorists who kill Israelis and Americans, and their families.
Taylor, an American, was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist, in Israel. The terrorist's family will receive a stipend from the Palestinian Authority. That stipend is far more than the average Palestinian's income.

@POTUS It is time for the entire Jewish community to come together and realize that @realDonaldTrump reportedly recognizing Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital isn‚Äôt a partisan issue. We should celebrate it no matter what President or party.
@POTUS Israel has made, and agreed to, many fair peace offers with the Palestinian Authority. At this point, waiting for the PA to agree to fair terms isn‚Äôt a reasonable justification for not doing the right thing.
@POTUS The United States should never wait on the UN, or an international consensus, to do the right thing. In this case, that means recognizing that Jerusalem is, in fact, the capital of Israel.
What happens if @POTUS recognizes Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital:		1) Shows Israel same deference every sovereign nation enjoys	2) Puts world on notice that the US won‚Äôt be intimidated by threats of violence	3) Tells UN/Int‚Äôl community we won‚Äôt stand for unfair treatment of Israel
