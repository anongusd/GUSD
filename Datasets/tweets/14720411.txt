@reborncabinets @bbb_us That told me whatever the reason this wasn’t typical. I respect that because I’ve never met Ryan. But that young man changed my perspective. Though every hard time a lesson for us all to grow.
@reborncabinets @bbb_us I was most impressed with the younger gentleman when he back Ryan the project manager as probably #1 in company. That is someone that you want on your team.
@reborncabinets @bbb_us Please take care of these employees as they are a valuable asset. As for the first crew. I would say just training, ppl you employ should always want to improve. I’ll always remember the last crew.
@reborncabinets @bbb_us The professionalism of these 2 impressed me. Their knowledge, &amp; understanding was great. The older gentleman had amazing knowledge. The younger gentleman was just as knowledgeable &amp; had a keen sense of customer service.
@reborncabinets @bbb_us This is good when you get a response &amp; resolve. First I would like to thank the 2 gentlemen that you sent on 3rd try. They should’ve been the first. #greatjob
