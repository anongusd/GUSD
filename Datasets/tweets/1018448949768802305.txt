@joncprevo Who are the Dems even gonna run in IA? NC you've got Jeff Jackson and Anthony Foxx, but I can't think of any all stars in IA.
@joncprevo NC is a way better target than IA, mostly because the Dem bench in NC seems stronger and Ernst &gt; Tillis
@joncprevo Governor Richard Cordray (D-OH)
@dana_balter is one of the most consistently underestimated candidates of 2018. She's outraising and outpolling Katko. That ain't a Likely R race. I for one look forward to having a Democrat representing Syracuse. #NY24

@geoffreyvs Maybe the numbers are too good for Dems, but c'mon dude, WI-GOV clearly isn't Lean R at this point.
@pkcapitol absolute unit
@deedahnjr @TaylorDesloge @SenhorRaposa Well, the House at least...
@deedahnjr @TaylorDesloge @SenhorRaposa Same with Iowa too
@BruneElections Scott should just switch parties at this point. I love the guy but it's clear he has no place in the modern GOP. Same with Charlie Baker.

@SenhorRaposa Katko &gt; Faso
@cooljeanius @ballotpedia MI-01 had one Dem candidate but he was disqualified from the primary ballot (he's running a write in campaign for the primary), GA-08 had two but they both dropped out (one is running for Ag. Comm.), no one filed for NC-03 because Jones is entrenched as hell
@byelin @ballotpedia There was a Dem candidate, Matt Morgan, but he was disqualified from the primary ballot on a technicality. Fortunately for the Dems he's running for the primary on a write in campaign and chances are he makes it on the ballot in November.
@redPak7 @Redistrict Hurd is safer than Culberson/Sessions but he's still quite vulnerable
@joncprevo Kemp's going to lose if he doesn't at least tack a bit to the center for the GE. He went pretty far to the right for the primary but he's actually more moderate than Cagle on policy.
@shabba_04 @ChazNuttycombe WI-GOP is horrendous but NC-GOP is straight up anti-democracy.

@DKElections NJ-02 to Safe D? https://t.co/mgr0pesro5
@BruneElections Without seeing the poll, I think Lamb's the favorite here. I bet he's up by at least 2.
@joncprevo Cockburn is a worse candidate but Wallace is costlier for the Dems since his district is inherently more competitive
@IAmKrishanPatel Roy Cooper should have more power
@politicsluo @HaleyLive @suneel @RepGreimel @SaadforCongress Honestly I feel like any of them could win the seat pretty easily.
@baseballot Garcia's a much better candidate than Farley if you ask me. Does consistently better in polls, higher name recognition statewide, and good on education (an important issue in AZ)
@joncprevo One of these days Rocky's gonna win a primary, we just gotta believe!
@andrew_striedl @politicsluo Agreed with all but Herrell and Roy. As already said, Herrell is very far from a lock in NM-02. I'd say there's actually an outside chance of Kopser winning in TX-21, he's a good candidate in a district that swung hard against Trump.
@BenJ_Rosenblatt @politicsluo @IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa People seem to think that Katko is as strong as, like, Valadao. He's really not, and he's certainly beatable. I think Balter's biggest hurdle is that it looks like the DCCC is giving her the cold shoulder since she beat a DCCC backed candidate in the primary (same with Eastman)

@gdebenedetti Hurd is trying to moderate because he knows he's getting thrown out of office by @GinaOrtizJones this November. Remember: he votes with Trump around 95% of the time.
@politico_chris @JoeManchinWV Manchin is a heavy favorite now, Tester was already a heavy favorite, McCaskill and Nelson are keeping their numbers stable... that whole statistic about "ten Trump state Democrats" is overblown, all but two (Donnelly/Heitkamp) are favored to win.
@postsbybrandon @marklnewman @ChazNuttycombe @SenhorRaposa I don't think Farley stands a chance in the primary at this point. It's almost definitely Garcia.
@NonstopDiatribe @politicsluo I can confirm he's a phenomenal fit. Andy Harris is pretty far to the right even for his district. It's R+14 IIRC so still a massive uphill battle but it's still worth keeping an eye on.
@NonstopDiatribe @politicsluo Colvin is a very good candidate (he reminds me a lot of Jared Golden) and, in terms of contributions, he outraised Harris 3 to 1. Up there with CO-04 and AL-05 as one of my top deep red sleeper races.
@SenhorRaposa Lewis is a caricature of conservative talk radio. Paulsen is a caricature of vulnerable Republicans literally paddling away from Trump.
@politicsluo Ron Johnson said he's retiring in 2022 regardless. If he follows through with that, that seat could flip even under a Dem prez.
@kkondik Cagle's downward spiral has been insane. He's been gunning for the Governor's Mansion for over a decade and it all fell apart within a month and a half.
@politicsluo @joncprevo True but he's pretty weak regardless. Reddick was the stronger choice, just like Browning over Gershon and Della Pia over Mitrano.
@politicsluo They still have OK/GA as Safe R while having SC as only Likely
@NonstopDiatribe @politicsluo MD-01 with Jesse Colvin and AL-05 with Peter Joffrion come to mind. I for one wouldn't mind seeing an all Dem delegation from MD.
@lvandle @cwm396 @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo Not to mention he's tacked right during the primaries. It's hard to say it didn't help him DURING the primaries but it's going to cost him hard in the GE.
@politicsluo @joncprevo He's just sort of inherently a bad fit for the district. It's not like he's actively dug himself deeper like Scott Wallace.
@politicsluo @joncprevo Looking forward to that sexy six seat flip this November. I would say seven but TJ Cox is, like, the worst.
@joncprevo @politicsluo I'm really hoping Morgan ends up on the ballot. I hear he's got a write in campaign for the primary but it would be a travesty if we didn't contest such a winnable seat.

@MattFriedmanNJ NJ-11's flipping. I wouldn't be surprised to see an 11D-1R delegation out of New Jersey this time next year.
@politicsluo Mike Castle (R-DE)
@politicsluo Interesting that the libertarian wing seems to vote with Trump less often than the moderates.
@politicsluo They're the best of a bad field, but Ing has ethics problems and Fukumoto was literally a Republican until last year (although she's probably the best candidate)
@deedahnjr Ige has recovered from the whole alert debacle pretty well, actually.
@politicsluo Not for long, unfortunately. The primary to replace Hanabusa is such a mess and there isn't a single good candidate in the mix.
@stevesingiser Wasn't it 10 times? 1, 4, 10, 21, 25, 39, 45, 48, 49, 50? Either way, 10/14 is an incredible feat. The only ones they missed were 22, where Janz still raised a million and a half, 23/42, which are solid R races, and 8, where there isn't even a Dem on the ballot.
@politicsluo FWIW the Dems have a fierce primary going on in MN-08, whereas in MN-01 the Dems have a strong presumptive nominee in Feehan. That alone doesn't mean MN-08 is more vulnerable, but it could be a factor if the primary heats up further.
@dbernstein @XochforCongress @Yvette4congress @CookPolitical Between a strong cash advantage, the lack of an incumbent, Torres Small being a great candidate, a Dem turnout advantage in the primary, and the seat being formerly represented by Harry Teague? This seat's got a very good chance of flipping.
@politicsluo MN-08 and KS-03 are wide open on the Dem side as well, and the Dems' selection could have an absolutely massive effect on their chances of winning each seat.
@JMilesColeman Balderson's definitely the favorite here but this race has all the signs of a sleeper race. I would expect a mid single digit Balderson win but this race has potential to be a shocker.
@ActorAaronBooth @DinoRossiWA @DrKimSchrier Rossi's a strong candidate and shouldn't be underestimated, but this is another case where the fundamentals really favor the Democrats. Not to mention Rossi's record isn't exactly a winning one. I still think the Dems will win WA-08 if they win the House.
