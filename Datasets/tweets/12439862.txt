@MarySchiavo , The N/S route determined by Inmasat calculating distance. Inmarsat has 2 overlapping sats there. Why can't they triangulate?
@GeorgeHatcher flt path determined by distance from Inmarsat. They have overlapping coverage there with 2nd sat. Crude triananglation??

@GeorgeHatcher Here is the marine chart . Should be easy to find http://t.co/WMnECqnfTF
@GeorgeHatcher water depth where the door maybe was located only 130 feet
Here is the reported location where they perhaps found the door on #mh370. It's very shallow there - about 130' water http://t.co/3In1qTrvuw
