@brigidbergin It‚Äôs the line for free stuff.
@POTUS if you allow kids and community leaders to tell stories of harassment in classrooms, on campus, throughout entire school system in America, you‚Äôll be shocked at amount of bullying and misbehavior that occurs on campus during lifetime of just one student.
@POTUS there are honest leaders in every community that know and understand local kids. Bring them to WH let them tell stories of teacher bullying. Bring college kids to WH, let them tell you how their teachers mark down their grades if they introduce conservatism to argument.
@ECHOtheCALL @RNRKentucky I volunteered admissions office, and opened my home to kids for pizza parties and discussion. Sometimes they got a little more rowdy than I‚Äôd prefer. In any event, they opened up and told their stories. All over America, @POTUS we need to hear these stories.
It‚Äôs truly incredible Republican Party has been hijacked by same vacuous entities as Democrats. It‚Äôs power that corrupts, and their corruption is deep. Americans stand with @realDonaldTrump in his fight against the SWAMP. We can‚Äôt give up now, we‚Äôve almost got our country back. https://t.co/UnSBivfH86
No, teaching children a better way should be top of ticket in 2020. Stopping bullying on campus should be enforced. FREEDOM to love America should be at top of ticket. We are already global leaders in green technology. Americans need to hear that truth. https://t.co/DxQH7AV47L
BTW, I knew teacher asked other teacher because my sons chemistry teacher told me and my son when he called me into the classroom at years end upon retirement to tell me my son was one of the best students in chemistry he‚Äôd ever had. 		Never let bullying get a pass. EVER!
5/4: I listened, I made my son listen, after this my son never looked back. Last two years of college 4.0 GPA. He‚Äôs working now and desires to complete his Masters Degree in Project Management. Never let a teacher bully your child, never let principal tell you can‚Äôt do anything.
Ends up, my son is so good at Chemistry he doesn‚Äôt have to study. Takes him 10 minutes to test and then he exercises. End of year, 9th grade teacher asks him who‚Äôs your best student this year, he answers with my sons name. My son tutored 37 students in college (Chemistry). 4/4
Son didn‚Äôt want to take advance Chemistry because he was still unsure he‚Äôd do well. Funny thing is, he winds up getting toughest teacher at the school who ends up being his 9th grade teachers best friend. Time flies by and my son runs laps during class. 3/4
Next thing you know, my son doesn‚Äôt want to take biology, in order to go to college because he thinks he too dumb to continue. May as well go to community college, he says. I said no way, got him a tutor. He got a ‚ÄúB‚Äù in the class. Next was chemistry. What an argument 2/4. https://t.co/oBP5xHER3M
In 9th grad my sons science teacher told him you should never go into the field of science because you‚Äôll never grasp the concepts. He ended up giving him a ‚ÄúD‚Äù in the class. Suffice it to say, teacher and I had a battle, including principal. 1/4 https://t.co/G2Lq5i53fX
@ECHOtheCALL @RNRKentucky If y‚Äôall think teachers don‚Äôt bully your kids, stop by their classroom one day and stand outside, or sit inside, or listen when your kids talk to you. Ask questions, you‚Äôll hear it all. Invite your kids friends over, feed them and ask. You‚Äôll be angry at what you hear.

@wikileaks Everyone would know if @realDonaldTrump was speaking with Assange, Democrats were tapping all of his lines.
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 People, Rep. Gaetz just reminded MichaelC that he‚Äôd better be honest about his testimony because he would be hung on a cross (as Cummings said) if he lied and his family would suffer. If he cheated, would you stay with him after this fiasco?
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Don‚Äôt resign from anything, VA is your precedence. Democrats don‚Äôt own you. You apologized. What you didn‚Äôt do was meet with him in private setting to discuss what was to be said in Congressional hearing.
GazProm of course. https://t.co/kHP8aw0DXr
@seanmdav LannyD didn‚Äôt take money because he knew if he did, he‚Äôd be liable for malpractice. Lanny have guilt, come on!
DWS to MichaelC you should have claimed your computer and records were all destroyed in a telephone booth by hammers and bleach, and all blew up when you accidentally dropped a match. https://t.co/GUtl3GxvVl
@BuzzPatterson @mlemiller1151 MichaelC was Lannied. I truly felt pity for the guy today, he is up against the wall and trying to save his wife and family. When an enemy offers something for free, RUN.
@FuctupMike I‚Äôve always paid more than my ex-husband for everything. More for child care, insurance, furniture, college tuition, books, medical care for chronically ill child, but my kids know me far more than they know their father. That means more to me than money ever will!
@ArthurSchwartz @RepAdamSchiff So that‚Äôs what Cohen and Schiff were doing before the hearing? How about you ask Cohen about his discussion with Adam Schiff about the hearing. Did Cohen Schiff and/or LannyD decide to withhold testimony until last minute. @Jim_Jordan @MarkMeadows ask MichaelC, please?
I just made a passing comment said Tlaib nothing to do with you and the PROP behind you. How do Democrat‚Äôs get away with this evil? https://t.co/yT2ZroUgX7

Rep. Gaetz‚Äôs tweet is no different than Adam Schiff meeting with MichaelC. Actually, it‚Äôs just a tweet that he apologized for mangling. How do we know if whether or not a Schiff threatened Cohen or his wife or coerced testimony when they met about Congressional hearing.

Lack of knowledge lack of schooling lack of parental oversight drug zealots who love money more than people confusion about addiction over prescribing overusage of drugs, all allow addiction to flourish. Drugs are best lover around. Education is enemy of addiction. https://t.co/IycjoiSdzE
Maybe they could write entire series based upon story and have Jussie be imprisoned for 3 years with community service upon his departure. He could sing and entertain all the dudes in EMPIRE cellblock. Somehow JussieS will get another hand slap, just like b4. https://t.co/1wZO9gt9dS

@charliekirk11 @TPUSA This dudes on film. He needs to be evicted from Berkeley.
Don‚Äôt believe that for a second, there is much more to Smollett issue than money. This entire charade needs to come to light and all the players need to be identified. The Nigerians seem to be the biggest dupes of all. CAMF Jussie paid them $3500 a piece. https://t.co/PPjMJ27jAt
Discussed Smollett with my daughter when it happened and we were both a bit skeptical. Later when we found out he was a gay black JEW just seeking attention, we were heartbroken for all those who literally fought against racism, for equality, and Jewish right of survivorship.
You don‚Äôt need Smollett to sell racism. Stop pandering, it‚Äôs not a good look for you. https://t.co/gG85sfgIwm
Here we go with pain and anger, now it‚Äôs onto giving this self serving prick a pass because he‚Äôs a downtrodden pitiful guy that‚Äôs has a horrible life. Really, cuz it wasn‚Äôt his race that made him steal his brother‚Äôs identity and claim it was him that got the DUI. https://t.co/JXop9E4ef2

It‚Äôs not from glee, it‚Äôs from hurt and anger. This guy took away CPD and FBI from doing the job of defending citizenry and called those that support @POTUS racists bigots. Punk ass dick head! Those that assisted Jussie with idea (Kamala and Cory), we see you. https://t.co/ybBOqjnbbu

@GOP we need to involve youth in platform. Most have been brainwashed, so need to slowly move with message. @GOP is for renewables and green energy, just not at expense of unemployment of Americans.

@speakrofhouse @STUinSD All the nonsense that Democrats sell involves free everything because it‚Äôs easy to silence citizenry with free things. We must not allow socialism to impair our country. Our children deserve freedom, training, and a listening ear. Let‚Äôs bring them into the capitalist fold.
@speakrofhouse @STUinSD Fire must be fought with fire, most youth of today don‚Äôt understand that America leads world in clean environmental progress. We need to incorporate message that all can participate. Need to gather business leaders together and begin to train youth for tomorrow.
@speakrofhouse @STUinSD Watch Harvest Ballot California, Gavin is another, along with OC politicians. @GOP would gain from providing and continuing a message to youth involving green renewables, but sorting through the sh*t to explain reality. Give educational lectures on independence in biz ownership.

@BreakingNLive @FreyjaMoody @POTUS demanded end to all funding of Islamic brigades throughout Syria and elsewhere. When war goes unfunded, it ends.
@BreakingNLive @FreyjaMoody Obama JV Team allowed ISIS to grow, funded IRAN caliphate, Hillary shivered in wings, @POTUS unleashed military and crushed Islamic neofascist uprising in less than two years. Imagine what he could do with assistance of right people targeting this thuggery over next six years.
Actually, @realDonaldTrump is just drawing attention to Democrats‚Äô double standard.

@POTUS isn‚Äôt getting away with anything, BarryO declared a national emergency against drug cartels in 2011, @realDonaldTrump is just using Democrats own verbiage executive order and cartel funds. @tedcruz thank you for the info you signaled @POTUS and America.

@POTUS @IvankaTrump @WarrenBuffett @elonmusk @BillGates and all independent thinking business owners, Americans need training in value of owning and operating business, profiting off of success, and how to fail and pick themselves back up and do it again. Give weekly address.
@POTUS Greatness of America is it‚Äôs independence, freedom of speech, freedoms to protect oneself, freedom to believe in your god, and freedom to believe in self-sufficiency and profit off your own good works. TRAIN Americans in what you know. Give us your own business forum.
@SpeakerPelosi now understand why Democrats don‚Äôt want business owners at @POTUS business forum, because independent thinkers may turn your socialistic programming on its ear. Americans might begin to think for themselves and may not need or want your so-called handouts anymore. https://t.co/Olw6wnks55
@POTUS we need to change socialism conversation by providing information to Americans that we can stand on our own by removing training to work to training for self-sufficiency.

@CNBC @JillRTeamXRP Leaving politics aside, maybe @POTUS Ray Dalio @BillGates @WarrenBuffett JeffBezos and other independent biz owners should help train youth of America in value of independent thought, savings, operating a business and making a profit in 21st century. We don‚Äôt need more taxation!
@CNBC @JillRTeamXRP Capitalism is not taught in home, school, life. What‚Äôs taught, worker beeism. Democrats push social programs to counter fact they take everything for themselves and to purchase silence. You want change, train all to self-support pay bills save money run business in 21st century.

@PoliticalShort If you think Saudi Arabia didn‚Äôt know what Khashoggi was doing and didn‚Äôt share that information with @POTUS while our investigatory bodies remained silent attempting to make him look a fool knowing Khashoggi was working with Turkey and Qatar for Muslim Brotherhood.
@PoliticalShort @JudicialWatch #KhashoggiGate needs investigation. @POTUS stood alone while Congress allowed @washingtonpost to push a war with Saudi Arabia all while knowing Khashoggi was foreign agent working for Turkey and Qatar was dictating articles on behalf of Muslim Brotherhood.
DEMS and @washingtonpost did their best to start a war with Saudi Arabia at behest of Qatar and Muslim Brotherhood.

In return, we expect fee on outgoing wires from people illegally residing in America that live off our tax dollars while sending tax free cash home. @POTUS we‚Äôre sick of being sacrificial lambs.
