@justdevin Like the obvious abuse via his fraudulent charity, the campaign finance abuse was blatant, but allowed to persist, enabled, for years, because he was tight with corrupt Democrat and Republican officeholders and power brokers. Period.
@justdevin Emoluments is about being in office. That's a different thing. His campaign finance abuse was in effect from essentially Day 1. Anyone of moderate intelligence who bothered to make an effort could see it.
@gscottoliver Fwiw, I would not have worked on Johnson's campaign if I even suspected that were true. And, fwiw, I don't know a single Libertarian for whom that is true. And I have known many who have run. At their own financial sacrifice, in fact.
@gscottoliver As someone who watched Trump's FEC filings, I can confidently say that you are completely and thoroughly incorrect. Trump's abuse of the campaign system was unique.
@justdevin Instead, many Democrats and media actively worked to legitimize Trump as a candidate, as a purposeful strategic decision. #truestory
@justdevin Explaining that the campaign was an income-producing PR fraud from the start might have ended this particular nightmare.
@justdevin You joke, but they were flouting campaign finance laws from the start, and I have yet to see one single piece of journalism detailing the abuse, or one single indictment for it, and the statute is ticking on that behavior.
Cohen confirms what I have been howling about into the abyss for years: The Trump campaign was an income operation for the Trumps.
Don't forget that Stone claiming to speak to Assange and provably speaking to Assange are not the same thing.

Since I'm on a roll, here's another unpopular opinion: It doesn't matter what happened re Smollett. One MAGA attack, or hoax, or whatever, is not a trend. Proves nada. No cause for anger, or giddiness, or whatever. As Bill Murray would remind us, it just does NOT matter.
I'm rooting for the hoax to be a hoax, so everyone has to check himself.
@kasie @ScottWalker @MittRomney @LindseyGrahamSC Were the journalists gushing over the politicians during these occasions? Because, if so, then yes, many of us have a problem with it. 'They did it, too!' is not a sound, rational justification. Please do not use cries of sexism as a rhetorical crutch.
@GayPatriot You could have let one of us gals have the "Crafty Beaver" name, just this once. https://t.co/CgLF3NjPBh
Did pols and other figures of the idiocracy 'pounce' on the Smollett incident? Sure. It's what they do. But did media really do anything other than cover it as they would any similar incident? I honestly don't know. I was too busy not giving a shit.
@ShannonPoe Did you see the abs?
At least he hired a couple of hotties. And they went to the "Crafty Beaver." And nobody was attacked. AND, in a twist, you Trumpers get to play victim. I mean, come on. It's not all bad.
The ignorance, hypocrisy, tribalism and irrational thinking are not new. But they seem worse. Especially the latter. And it seems the value of being a victim has greatly increased. People will inevitably try to acquire that asset. But wtfdik.
@ThinSkinFatDude I think I'm just being a contrarian. But habitually. I'm always siding with the losers, lately. *shrug*
When do we get to talk about "Crafty Beaver." Might have to use that for my dating profile. Or something.
Everyone is an ignorant hypocrite. No wonder I'm so popular.
Nearly everyone complaining that folks believed something they saw in the news is a hypocrite. People are biased - maybe now more than usual - and believe what they want to believe. Without confirming it themselves. Most US politics is based on ignorance.
Journalists should be cynics. Law enforcement must be. But it's just not rational to create an environment where pols are expected to comment on this shit, and then hold them accountable for someone else's hoax.
He may have justified this by telling himself that it happens IRL to others likes him, so he's just using his platform to help blah blah. People rationalize some crazy, irrational shit, esp these days.

It's not just old people whose lives are dictated by Medicare, regardless what medical best practices and their unique circumstances say is sound. People become 'eligible' for 'entitlements' and are burdened with the consequences, whether they want them or not.

As things even up, I see potential for the strong local Tarrant Co Libertarian Party to build and flex our muscles. (Holla if you want to help in any way.)
Tarrant will probably tip from leaning Red to leaning Blue at some point soon. But only because we're the largest red county in the country. Has nothing to do with Beto, or Cruz, or Trump, or any other one pol. But we've long had Dems in FW. (Remember the tennis shoe lady?)
@mhendr61 @KenGardner11 Yeah, Cruz's problems are about Cruz. The fact he flipped on Trump and sold out his brand. The shape of his face, etc. Lots of factors unique to him, imo, that prevent drawing a bunch of broad implications from his race with Beto.
Sessions still taking it up America's ass for Trump, by quitting, so that Trump can place his lackey-of-the-moment in charge of the Mueller investigation.
Ugh. Y'all, please stop acting like a huge deal that a Democrat won in either Dallas Co or Tarrant Co (Fort Worth). It's really not. It's Texas, but they're also among the most populated counties in the whole country.

No, it's independent thinking motivated by morals, ethical behavior, and rational use of time/energy by people who refuse to be sheep enable violence. (And if you happen to have a different opinion, you are no better than me or anyone else.) https://t.co/YtKJweMO2B

@justdevin I might disagree on that, but only this once. üòÅ I love getting to have the conversation.
@justdevin I'm also only nitpicking you on this because you are among the few humans who are still capable of having this conversation with me. Smh. Thanks.
@justdevin I'm only nitpicking you because I have been thinking about this and would love to see us (me, included) do better at aiming our ire at the specific negative behaviors (esp violence), tone down the judging people for POV, and try to stop connecting the two (b/c bigotry etc).
@justdevin My 'extreme' (read: consistent) opposition to force leads me to be an anarchist. That makes me 'fringe.' But I work at not being rude, irrational, hateful, or intolerant. Neither my nor any political POV causes those undesirable traits. (Believing it does is bigotry. #PSA)
@justdevin No offense, but you aren't helping by implying that there's something with having 'fringe' views. Human rights, civil rights, were once 'fringe.' Politely-expressed strict nonviolence is still 'fringe.' We can have rational debate without denigrating people with uncommon beliefs.
@emilyaheil @AG_Conservative The date undercut the entire thrust of the story. You decided what to write and then ignored facts contrary to what you had decided to say.

@DWCook Narcissists are fun like that.
If you want a reason to not confirm Kavanaugh, you don't need underage drinking (STOOOOPID REASON) or suspected sexual assault. The fact that the man just wasn't impressive during this process should be plenty. Struggled with pitches over the plate. https://t.co/JtHZrHr0oT
Folks, there are very very few children that manage alcohol well. Esp in this country, where we don't help them learn alcohol moderation. Kids have undeveloped brains that struggle with sound judgment. That's why we don't let them drink or become SCOTUS judges.

@CraigR3521 It's a language thing. How can folks not get that?
I've oft and long-wished we had a non-gendered pronoun. For as long as I can remember. And while, for the same time, I've also been radically pro-gender/whatever choice tolerant, my reasons for wanting to be able to reach for a generic pronoun have never been political.
oh ffs https://t.co/hZuawBLvG7
Democrat Machine, not Christine Ford, is quite obviously steering this. No wonder not all her 'choices' made sense or protected her interests. It's really fucking depressing, in fact, to watch.

It wasn't a 'moment' for female empowerment or sexual assault victims in the elevator. It was an irrational shrieking loon. Ugh.
@Evan_P_Grant Yeah, but Dr. SChacherer is a good dude.
@instapundit @ABAesq Oh, wow. He wrote that shit on his own? Yeah, he's done. Or should be.
I'm not a child. But the legalization of cannabis for my sleep seizure disorder would be life-changing. And, unlike the dangerous drugs that the @GovAbbott enables, it has zero side effects. Doesn't he care about those of us who aren't children? Legalize now.
@bcuban It's not offensive. Just stupid. 	And you're not old, Brian. 60 is the new 30, or some shit. (Just go with it.)
RT @Mark4Gov: I have never seen two people have such a hard time saying "YES" or "NO." 		If @LupeValdez and @GovAbbott cannot give a straig‚Ä¶
For the record, we here in Tarrant County Libertarian Party candidates that are at least as impressive as this woman. No offense. With respect, the Sheriff is not impressive. #TeamLupe
Gov Abbott talking about how "he gave money and checks" to people who needed it. Eff you, dude. That's taxpayer money. Stolen from us. You didn't give anyone shit. #peev #TxGovDebate
@TheMaverick21 Turn around and go to your room.
So, am I a clueless liar, too? Since I'm old and white. Or does the fact that I'm finally getting some sun and still look hot in a bikini save me? Or does this only affect men? Perhaps @MichaelAvenatti can advise.
The only candidate that would seriously take on our absurd property taxes is not on the stage: @Mark4Gov #TxGovDebate #LetMarkDebate
"Old white guys are liars." -- Just as old and even whiter guy. #AcceptableBigotry https://t.co/SgnzXYX47p
@MichaelAvenatti @tedcruz You are as old and even whiter than Ted Cruz. Does that mean you are a liar? Geez. What a stupid thing for a supposedly smart fella to say. Basta, as you might say.
"Let's start by unnecessarily scaring the shit of our children by focusing on shit that almost never happens and the minuscule risk of school shootings." This is so stupid. WE are so stupid. Plz put me down in history as getting that. #TxGovDebate
RT @Mark4Gov: Join me here for live tweet of the fake Texas Governors debate.		#TxGovDebate
#txgovdebate is a fraud perpetrated by the Dems, GOP, and media, because it doesn't include all the candidates on the ballot. And it doesn't include the far and away BEST candidate on the ballot: @Mark4Gov
@LBJLibrary @KXAN_News @GregAbbott_TX @LupeValdez This fraud of a 'debate' does not include all candidates on the ballot and is, therefore, a commercial for by Democrats and Republican parties. Shame on the LBJ Library and KXAN for being part of it. It's an abuse of power by all of the above. Let @Mark4Gov debate.

I wasn't initially worried about a PhD's ability to realize that her interests weren't being prioritized. Until I saw Dr. Ford. (No offense, sweetie.) But now I better appreciate just how little control she has. She's the one getting flipped around in this pinball.
Ford's lawyers sure seem to be consistently working obo the Democrats' interests more than hers. Not a fan. Too bad we don't have a good enough media to notice this shit. https://t.co/hTcputUVkM
