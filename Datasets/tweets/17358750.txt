There is no greater contrast between Washington and the real world than this government shutdown. Tonight just highlighted that even more clearly, and why it needs to end now.
If @realDonaldTrump's tantrum lasts into this Friday, it will be the longest shutdown in national history, and that -- like so much about this presidency -- is an absolute disgrace.
President Trump owns this shutdown. His tantrum is having a real impact on cities like mine, where unpaid workers still have bills to pay and no money to spend in our local businesses.

We are no longer trying to ‚Äúmanage‚Äù homelessness, we are trying to end chronic homelessness. It‚Äôs not easy or expedient.

If you live in Georgia, make sure you have a plan to vote tomorrow. If you‚Äôre out of state, you can still help. Find friends in Georgia right now, and remind them to vote for John Barrow on Tuesday. Georgia can‚Äôt afford a Brian Kemp lookalike.		https://t.co/bzhmJNUdVk
We all saw how the election in Georgia was manipulated by the outgoing Secretary of State to secure his victory in the governor‚Äôs race. On Tuesday, December 4, Georgians have a chance to elect someone who will guarantee free and fair elections for all: Democrat @Barrow4Georgia.
We must also rally more communities to organize gun buybacks like those we hold right here in Los Angeles, which have taken over 16,000 dangerous weapons off the streets since 2013.		Thoughts and prayers are not enough.
Today, as we take a moment to honor the victims, we must commit to #HonorThemWithAction. We must demand that Washington enacts common sense gun safety laws and stronger background checks and demand that they close loopholes in the laws already on the books.
Exactly three years ago, our neighbors in San Bernardino suffered one of the deadliest mass shootings in history: 14 people were killed and 22 people were seriously injured, including Shannon Johnson, a resident of Los Angeles.

This isn't about forest mismanagement, this is about earth mismanagement. From the fires in my state, to the floods in Houston, to the storms in Florida, climate change is right in front of us. We need to cut carbon emissions. We have no other choice.

We're told to be silent, and to just remember. We are told to pray, but not to act. But tonight, we will not be silent. We will stop the scapegoating. Stop the hatred. Stop the violence. Because it is only with boundless love that we can conquer senseless hatred.
Tonight, we commit to working towards a future defined by compassion instead of a toxic ideology of hate and division. Tonight, we are saying this is our America.
Tonight, Americans across the country came together with Pittsburgh for vigils to remember their lives. Tonight, people of every faith and people of no faith lit a candle and made a connection.

RT @TheCityClub: ‚ÄúOur reach should exceed our grasp. For after all - what is America for?‚Äù - @ericgarcetti @MayorOfLA #CityClub
Those two Americas they talk about?		It‚Äôs an analog Washington vs. a digital world.		This is why we urgently need change.
Right now we can‚Äôt count on 536 politicians to adapt quickly enough to prepare us for the future. That‚Äôs at the core of why we‚Äôre falling behind.
We must flip Washington on its head.  		Americans can no longer be defined by Washington. Washington must be defined by Americans.
We must demand that Washington follows the lead of local communities, instead of the other way around.		We must demand that our national leaders pay attention to our local successes, and spread those victories throughout this nation.
It‚Äôs time for power in our country to come from the people and from the places where we live.		This isn‚Äôt about re-claiming the House; it‚Äôs not about new leadership in the White House.  Those things are necessary; but they are not enough.
Our Declaration of Independence states: ‚ÄúWhenever any form of government becomes destructive‚Ä¶ it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government.‚Äù		My friends, it is time for the people of America to institute a new government.
I ran for elected office because I thought I had something to offer to my community. But my real inspiration comes from being a foster parent.
About to take the stage at @TheCityClub. Tune in: https://t.co/TTFBtirBgm

DC only listens to big-money lobbyists. @SellersforMayor and I spend our time listening to our neighbors, at community meetings and at the store, face-to-face.		When Washington won‚Äôt listen, we have to join forces ‚Äî we have to fight for our country. #MayorsGetThingsDone https://t.co/x73dIhlgjH

Most importantly, his opponent, @RosenforNevada, is a truly inspiring candidate.
And he should be. Of all the Senate races in 2018, Republican Senator Dean Heller‚Äôs seat is the most likely to flip. He won his last race by just one point, and Nevada went to Hillary Clinton in 2016.
So when he tweeted about the Nevada Senate race, he showed us that he‚Äôs worried about keeping the seat.

Our 2018 midterms -- and the future of our democracy -- are threatened. Washington must work with state election officials to secure our elections.
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a Republican, a Democrat, somewhere in the middle, or completely off the map -- we cannot politicize the fact that America‚Äôs democracy was attacked. When a foreign power directly intervenes in our electoral process, we deserve answers.
Another seat flipped from red to blue. The 38th seat to flip since Trump became president. It's a sign that people across the country are fed up with Washington. It's a sign of what will happen in November. Let's go. https://t.co/8EfzDkvge5

The path to a Democratic majority in Congress runs straight through California.		Things may have been different in previous years. But today, 10 of our state‚Äôs 14 Republican-held House seats are battlegrounds.

It‚Äôs up to us. We in California can change the course of history. We can lead the wave for a Democratic House majority. 		https://t.co/jvxzxzkc26
Our Members of Congress are supposed to go to Washington and stick up for us back home. But Republicans like Congressmen @SteveKnight25 and @DanaRohrabacher instead vote to take away our healthcare and even support Trump‚Äôs plan to drill off of our coast.
This is unprecedented. And this is what we will do across the country in 2018.
Democrat @RepLindaBelcher won last night's special in Kentucky HD49 by 68-32. That's a 37-point margin.
Yesterday, voters elected a Democratic woman in a place that Trump won 72-23 in 2016. That's a 49-point margin.
This is a sign of what's to come.
Members of Congress have a 97% re-election rate. But we can absolutely change that this year if we are strategic and aggressive.

@keepPDRmoving I agree--these should be decided at the local level.  We need to prevent deaths and be flexible. This should be only one of many options.
@josh_onwilshire @MayorOfLA @KNX1070 We are looking at going to Bundy.  Local return probably wouldn't be enough but federal funding could help us get there.
@SteveDucey For the person waiting for housing, it's as real as it gets.
@SteveDucey Because we'd have to buy that land for much more money which would come out of our budget (and would take 2-3 more yrs to get).

#WisDems do not cede power you have before you exercise it.  	This is your state. This is our country. This is our time. Let‚Äôs go seize it!
Can‚Äôt afford their xenophobia	Can't afford their discrimination	Can‚Äôt afford their cut to #healthcare for 23mm Americans.
I fight for #immigrants because it‚Äôs right thing to do &amp; they contribute more than $232 billion to economy.
In Los Angles, making community college free.
We win by lifting working people up, like we did in LA when we raised our #minimumwage #raisethewage
We‚Äôre putting carpenters, electricians, machinists, laborers to work.
LA‚Äôs infrastructure plan means almost a half-million, good paying, middle-class #union jobs
#governorwalker ‚Äî if you are watching, it‚Äôs time to take notes.
#democrats do big things!
Most of us in la are not movie stars. We are teachers and truck drivers, nurses and firefighters.
In la, what they want and need is no different than what they want and need in Milwaukee.
We must win on both defense and offense--just as we're doing in cities across America.
We as democrats don't need focus on a #Democratic agenda. We as #Democrats need to  focus on an #American agenda.
In a word, their agenda is a big pile of covfefe!
Instead of paving our streets, they‚Äôre sending us tweets
Working people in Wisconsin &amp; across America aren‚Äôt just anxious and insecure. They‚Äôre angry and impatient
People are working fewer shifts, fewer hours, getting less overtime	Automation isn‚Äôt a future threat, it‚Äôs on the factory floor right now.
TURBULENT POLITICAL TIMES AND TIMES OF DEEP ECONOMIC INSECURITY FOR AMERICANS
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ACROSS AMERICA NEED TO REMEMBER -- WE CANNOT WIN WITHOUT WISCONSIN.
WHEN REPUBLICANS ATTACK LABOR IN WISCONSIN, THEY ATTACK WORKING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.
