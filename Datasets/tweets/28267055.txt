In Senator Heitkamp’s new ad, she touts her support for repealing the oil export ban. What she didn’t tell you is her support for the Iran Deal opened world markets to Iranian oil, hurting ND energy producers and leading to more financing for terrorist groups.  #NDSen #NDPol https://t.co/VFds56GyZ2
