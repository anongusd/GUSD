@GunnerVike @markl280 @iggieowned @myleftone @MrSmithisready @pacecar86 @Tayl94078417 @SenSchumer @RexNutting Do some research. There are many free nations with better, more affordable healthcare that is not a 100% government model. Don't stay brainwashed by greedy free market notions that regulations are always bad and no regulation is good. That's not how free civilization developed.

@GunnerVike @myleftone @iggieowned @MrSmithisready @pacecar86 @Tayl94078417 @SenSchumer @RexNutting The notion that many come here for basic healthcare is a myth. There are instances where a Canadian may cross over for a faster MRI, or lab test, but it's not as common as you've been lead to believe.

@Troll_Troll4Fun @Hilemarka @eRikster2 @HealthCareRenew @RepDaveBrat @SpanbergerVA07 @DaveBratVA7th Um, hun, there's a lot of information already out there about it. Do your research. @RepDaveBrat's buddies from Big Pharma are planning to fight it tooth and nail. #VA07 deserves better than Brat. @SpanbergerVA07 is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.
@Troll_Troll4Fun @Hilemarka @eRikster2 @HealthCareRenew @RepDaveBrat @SpanbergerVA07 @DaveBratVA7th If it works (and that's a big 'if), it could help some Americans with some prescriptions; but if Tim Kaine's Medicare X gets passed, then, wow! it really might make a dent in the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. @SpanbergerVA07 supports Medicare X!
@Troll_Troll4Fun @Hilemarka @eRikster2 @HealthCareRenew @RepDaveBrat @SpanbergerVA07 @DaveBratVA7th If you're still talking about Trump's very limited prescription proposal for people on Medicare, then it's not a "bill that's been signed into law."

@mbmk7 @nomadinabag @IWestbrook @KangasMom1 I have thought about this, also; and by my estimation, I think the Constitution does not allow the federal indictment of a sitting president. I think this is how Meuller reads it, too.
@JoyceWhiteVance @CHEESEBURGLAR45 My grandmother said, "In this family, we are born Democrats, and we will die Democrats." But the party is wrong. People are allowed and must push back. It is not a lack of civility; it is the defense of our democracy. It is defense of our personal liberties. It is self defense.
@mbmk7 @nomadinabag @IWestbrook @KangasMom1 Frankly, I want Meuller to wait until 45 loses the 2020 election. Impeachment will only put Pence in charge, and allow him pardons. If patience prevails, the DOJ can pounce when Dems are running it. States will be welcomed to also pile on with tax evasion charges.
