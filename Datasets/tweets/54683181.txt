In closing, I know you join me in expressing our heartfelt thoughts and prayers for those impacted by Hurricane Michael. As islanders, we've felt the wrath of nature on more than one occasion and know first hand the devastation and life-changing impacts that can occur..
The Sunset Concert featuring Roman Street will be held at Fort Gaines on Sunday, Oct. 14 at 430pm. Admission is $5 per person (FREE admission for pre-teens).
The 8th Annual DI Art Trail will go on as scheduled this Saturday, Oct. 13 from 9am-4pm. The "Flight of the Frigate Bird" documentary (presented by the Mobile Bay NEP) will be shown at Green Park (instead of West End Beach) on Saturday at 7pm. FREE Admission.
People currently on the west end with vehicles other than 4-wheel drive should NOT try to exit the area until sand clearing along Bienville Blvd. has reached your home/rental property and standing water has receded to safe levels.
Alabama Power Company repairs crews were able to reach the far west end late today and electricity should (I'm actually not sure at this time) be completely restored to that portion of the island.
The checkpoint at Raphael Semmes Street will remain in place until further notice. Please bring proper credentials to gain access to points west. Four-wheel drive vehicles are a necessity until sand is cleared from roadways.
Public Works personnel will be operating two pumps to help remove standing water from rights-of-way. In addition, they will also be picking up trash and other debris items.
UPDATE FROM Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier:  		Sand removal equipment and personnel arrived late today and clearing of roadways is underway. Crews will focus on Bienville Blvd. first and then move to the side streets. Progress updates will be provided on a daily basis.
