michael cohen brought more than just receipts. he has plenty of tea to pass around as well. i don‚Äôt know how the hell trump escapes this. can‚Äôt be dismissed. cohen is already going to prison. he has nothing to gain by lying again. he‚Äôs testifying under oath that trump is guilty!
@TeaPainUSA yeah. it seems too good to be true. someone needs to be apprehended TOMORROW as soon as cohen testifies under oath.
how do the feds not slap the cuffs on trump as soon as he gets back on air force one to fly back to the states? he needs to be indicted tomorrow and brought to justice. this bastard stole the 2016 election by colluding with russians and paying hush money to defraud the electorate
his insecurity is amazing. https://t.co/evoGHqXIrD
if cohen is not supposed to be discussing russia, why is it right smack dab in the middle of his opening statement? he says it right there in black and white that trump talked to roger stone about his contact with wikileaks and forewarned about the hillary email dump. that‚Äôs game
