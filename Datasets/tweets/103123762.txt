Pretty sure some Chinese national is going after my inheritance in the Mainland right now but the bank locked her out of my account. But Yuan is going to depreciate to the Mark soon so it doesn’t matter anyways. Bye Felicia.
Not Red Cross bc that’s a tax fraud. Not churches that violate FECA by telling you having a rape kid (not kit) is God’s plan. Please check with IRS and FBI first to avoid scams. Many GoFundMe’s are scams and the Chinese raised $60k in my name but took it all. https://t.co/PzkOZx7FTF
