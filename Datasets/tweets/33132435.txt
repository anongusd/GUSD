@ledarga22 @BarackObama @Lin_Manuel Yeah right dimwit...one word...URANIUM Smh your administration did nothing to affect change in this area.
@BarackObama U were in office 8yrs and shootings escalated. Coming from Chicago u should have done more instead of focusing in on celebrity and dossiers. We see thru u. Lovely portrait btw LMAO
@HillaryClinton Why do your bodyguards have guns if you are so opposed? You were in government for how long, and now it's this administration to blame? U still r clueless to why u lost. Side talking when it serves ur agenda once again smh
@CNN I support the NRA and the 2nd amendment. These companies jumped on the media band wagon too soon and will regret it. Mental health and lack of law enforcement oversite caused this. U will never disarm citizens, civil war will ensue.
@realDonaldTrump Agree, and add more social service support and mentoring for kids struggling as well as better pay. #MentalHealthMatters
@RealJamesWoods Breakdown of the family unit and old fashioned discipline because a parent was home watching, while the other worked. Really worked, and EARNED everything they had.
