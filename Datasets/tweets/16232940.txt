Eric Bolling of Fox News offers this evaluation of the candidates at tonight's debate: https://t.co/A8ZxubYURc
Carly had a polished, patriotic close #GOPDebate
Trump closes with we will be strong again, everyone will respect us, it will be a friendlier world. Bush..."forge consensus" #GOPDebate
Cruz really surprised me when he said leave Hamilton on $10, but replace Jackson on $20. He just lost 30% in Tennessee #GOPDebate
Carly had by far the best answer when she said keep Hamilton on the $10 bill #GOPDebate
Kasich: Mother Theresa, Christie: Abigail Adams on $10 bill #GOPDebate
Carson: my mom on $10 bill, Trump: my daughter/Rosa Parks. Bush: Thatcher, Walker: Clara Barton, Carly: I wouldnt change $10 bill #GOPDebate
What woman do you want on $10 bill? Huckabee-my wife Rubio-Rosa Parks Cruz-I would take Jackson off $20, leave Hamilton
Carson says of Trump: "He's an ok Doctor" #GOPDebate
T: Autism is an epidemic. I favor vaccines. They should be less over a longer period of times. Someone who works for me had this #GOPdebates

Tapper asks on climate change #GOPDebate
Christie goes big on means testing social security payments. This will not help him #GOPDebate

Carly: My husband and I buried a child to drug addiction. Smoking marijuana is not like drinking a beer #GOPDebate
2 words I didn't need to hear tonight: "cannabis oil." Thank you Rand Paul for mentioning it twice. #GOPDebate
This is hilarious! https://t.co/YxmtitCYF3
Paul to Bush: Kids who had privilege like you didn't go to jail for smoking marijuana #GOPDebate
Jeb - 40 years ago I smoked marijuana. I admit it. My mom's not happy I just did. Govt should provide more treatment/prevention #GOPDebate
Marijuana legalization? Seriously? #GOPDebate
Exactly right. https://t.co/sSriuty4fX
This is funny. https://t.co/jvREQf3vGk
Bush: I think John Roberts is doing a good job at SCOTUS #GOPDebate
Cruz: It was a mistake to appoint John Roberts to SCOTUS. He changed the law to uphold Obamacare. GHW Bush appointed Souter #GOPDebate
Bush dodges question from Dana Bash on whether his brother GWB's appointment of John Roberts to SCOTUS #GOPDebates
Carly we need 50 army brigades 300 to 350 naval ships we need to invest in our military technology Tapper interrupts her #GOPDebate
How much longer is this debate? #GOPDebate
Carson opposed going into Afghanistan in 2003. OK, fair enough, but why, Jake Tapper, are we dwelling on 12 years ago? #GOPDebate
Carson "on the record I suggested to GWB he not go into Iraq in 2003." Trump shakes hands with Carson #GOPDebate
That's funny https://t.co/6nLp4PWLTy

Rubio: I miss a lot of votes in the Senate because the Senate is out of touch with the people. I am leaving Senate  #GOPDebate
Tapper tries to get Rubio to hit Trump on foreign policy capability, but Rubio doesn't take the bait #GOPDebate
Trump: I will have the finest team anyone has to deal with foreign policy issues #GOPDebate
So far, the questions from the CNN moderators are much better than those from the FoxNews moderators in 1st Debate #GOPDebate
Carly: Hillary does not have a track record of accomplishment #GOPDebate
@agripundit "Gratuitous" is from the Latin
HH asks Kasich why he won't attack Hillary, and why Carly always attacks Hillary #GOPDebate
Carson: their should be a starter minimum wage for teenagers, higher wage for others #GOPDebate
Carson "the federal minimum wage probably, possibly should be raised. Both sides should negotiate a reasonable minimum wage." #GOPDebate

Paul just said he wants to get rid of the payroll tax! #GOPDebate
Trump "what I'ld like to do is a major reduction in taxes, the hedge fund guys will pay more." #GOPDebate

Carly hits Trump on 4 bankruptcies, but Trump says Atlantic City is a disaster where his casinos were. #GOPDebate
Trump said Yale Biz School prof called Carly 1 of worst CEOs in history. Bought compaq, led to destruction of HP. #GOPDebate
Carly defends her record leading HP during difficult time. We went from lagging behind to leading. Fired due to challenging status quo
Paul: I hate to say it, but @realdonaldtrump has a bit of a point here on birthright citizenship #GOPDebate
Carly asks why have Dems not solved immigration problem, we have been talking about it for 25 years, dodges Tapper birthright Q #GOPDebate
Trump: '14th amendment says "birthright citizenship" is wrong. Mexico doesn't have that. We're only ones stupid enuf to have it #GOPDebate
An hour and a half into #GOPDebate it's starting to drag....
Carly claims "we were talking about illegal immigration in 2016 before Donald Trump brought it up" #GOPDebate
Carson: Americans don't seem to want to work in the agricultural sphere #GOPDebate
Bush: "I'm going to show respect by answering a question in Spanish" #GOPDebate #tcot
Trump: Bush is wrong, illegal immigration is not an "Act of Love" as he says #GOPDebate
Bush: Trump went too far in invoking my wife. Why don't you apologize to my wife 4 saying her birth in Mex makes me soft in Mex? #GOPDebate
Carson: Yuma County AZ put in a double fence w a road. We need border security #GOPDebate
Trump: Illegal immigration is costing us over $200 billion a year #GOPDebate
Trump: 1. Build a wall 2. Get rid of a lot of bad dudes 3. Make sure immigration laws are adhered to #GOPDebate

Kasich: We operate better in the world when our allies work with us #GOPDebate
Cruz: Iran will not comply. There's a reason they call Israel "the little satan" and US "the great satan" #GOPDebate
Paul: Sometimes military intervention makes us less safe #GOPDebate
HH to Trump about red line in Syria - Trump--I wouldn't have drawn the line. Had our Pres gone in w force, wouldn't have crisis #GOPDebate
Huckabee: Iran deal is about the survival of western civilization. This threatens Israel immediately. #GOPDebate #tcot
Bush: No, we shouldn't cancel that state dinner with China... #GOPDebate #tcot
Walker: Why are we giving official state dinner to China when they have just completed massive cyber attack on us #GOPDebate #tcot
Paul: criticizes Carly for saying she won't talk with Putin, rips Cruz for ripping up Iran deal on day 1: "that's absurd." #GOPDebate

Carson on money: We now have over 500,000 donations. #GOPDebate
Trump to Bush: Don't make things up #GOPDebate
Trump to Bush - your claim about me was totally false #GOPDebate
Tapper to Bush: Trump says you are a puppet to ur donors. Are you? Bush--the 1 guy who tried to give me money was Trump #GOPDebate
Carly: People are supporting outsiders ... because politicians have been in that system forever #GOPDebate #tcot

The Kiddie Table debate was a good warm up. #GOPDebate starts in 1 minute #tcot
The main event is about to start #GOPDebate #tcot
Mercifully, no closing statements at the Kiddie Table debate #GOPDebate #tcot  Santorum &amp; Pataki probably have a hard time staying in race
Graham's unique quality: " I will win a war. I get my foreign policy from being on the ground. I'm a good friend with Kasich" #GOPDebate
Jindal brings this unique quality: "I'm a doer not a [fast] talker" #GOPDebate #tcot
Santorum says he brings this unique quality: "I shook things up in Washington." #GOPDebate #tcot crash &amp; burn
Pataki says he offers this unique quality: " I can govern and lead" zzzzzzzzzzzz #GOPDebate #tcot ..."Once I've won . . ." good grief
Except the clock kid question https://t.co/bNSRIM4Sfb
Jindal still talking too fast #GOPDebate #tcot
Graham on Syria: "Assad must go" #GOPDebate #tcot
Santorum giving speeches that are too long.... zzzzzzzzzzz #GOPDebate #tcot
None of the 4 at the Kiddie's Table is embarrassing  themselves, but none is breaking out, in my view #GOPDebate #tcot
Personally, I think Santorum is performing the worst at the Kiddie's Table so far #GOPDebate #tcot
Santorum vigorously defends his proposal to increase minimum wage. Graham gives him grief #GOPDebate #tcot
Tapper to Graham on minimum wage. Santorum wants to increase it. Graham: increasing makes it hard to hire more #GOPDebate #tcot
Pataki would keep home mortgage deduction, would reduce corp tax rate to 12% #GOPDebate #tcot
Santorum says he will introduce a 20-20 flat tax plan - 20% person income tax and 20% corporate income tax . #GOPDebate #tcot

Jindal says putting Roberts and Kennedy on SCOTUS was a mistake #GOPDebate #tcot
@EconomicMayhem My point was just those who say Gov of KY can't fire her by law are correct.
@SarcyMalarky you have that right!
Yes, you are right https://t.co/X2U1KKATQi
You are absolutely correct! Pataki kind of stepped in it there. Kim Davis should follow the rule of law but not Gov! https://t.co/HBldT88WKg
You are absolutely correct! https://t.co/fEtlnRkUdF
Pataki kind of blew up his own point that Davis should follow rule of law. Under rule of law, Gov can't fire county clerk #GOPDebate #tcot
Pataki did just make a mistake saying as Gov he would have fired Kim Davis. Gov of KY can't fire Davis. She is elected clerk #GOPDebate
Pataki: "I would have fired Kim Davis" #GOPDebate #tcot
Graham: "Young men from the middle east are different from Kim Davis" #GOPDebate #tcot
Tapper asks about balance between vigilance and discrimination. #GOPDebate #tcot
Tapper asking about the 14 year old kid who made the clock ? Give me a break #GOPDebate #tcot

Graham "we're going to need more LEGAL IMMIGRATION" #GOPDebate #tcot
Graham's one word interruptions of Santorum are kind of annoying #GOPDebate #tcot
Graham interrupting Santorum frequently #GOPDebate #tcot This is what CNN is looking for in the second debate also.
Pataki proposes community service for those here illegally who want legal status #GOPDebate #tcot
Pataki - "We can't ignore 11 million people who are here.. I would require those who want legal status to come forward" #GOPDebate #tcot
I think Jindal drank a little too much coffee today. Talking very fast. #GOPDebate #tcot
Dana Bash to Santorum on Immigration, who says "this debate should not be about what we do with someone who is here illegally" #GOPDebate
Good point! https://t.co/R3nq224XT5
Pataki on Trump: " He will do for America what he did for Atlantic City" #GOPDebate #tcot
Hewitt to Pataki-You broke pledge to support GOP nominee if Trump is nominee. Pataki-Trump won't be nominee "unfit to be Pres" #GOPDebate
Tapper on theme of Trump to Graham: Why would your SC constituents prefer Trump to you? Graham-I am best qualified to be CIC #GOPDebate
Santorum says Trump has the right to run as a Republican.. smacks Jindal a bit for attacking fellow GOPer #GOPDebate #tcot
Tapper: Jindal, u called Trump "unstable, narcisstic,egomaniac" - Jindal says "let's stop treating Trump like a Republican" #GOPDebate #tcot
Santorum "most of you know me most because I'm the proud father of 7" really? #tcot #GOPDebate
Pataki's opening statement a snore.... what a shock! #GOPDebate #tcot

Jake "will follow up and guide the discussion"
Pataki announced
