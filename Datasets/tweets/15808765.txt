I‚Äôve seen firsthand how our failed drug laws can fracture communities, destroy families, and make us all less safe‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I wrote legislation in 2017 that will start reversing decades of failed federal drug policy.		Today, I reintroduced my bill‚Äîthe #MarijuanaJustice Act. https://t.co/TOgF0bS2Zn
To learn more about the Marijuana Justice Act, please text ‚ÄúJUSTICE‚Äù to 40203
Let‚Äôs legalize marijuana at the federal level, push states to do the same, AND help those who have suffered due to its prohibition.
Excited to announce that my Marijuana Justice Act now has strong support in the Senate &amp; House‚Äîbut we need to build support to make it law. I hope everyone who's in favor of legalization will speak up &amp; become an advocate for a more restorative justice. https://t.co/K4Xgmai5xk
Finally, my bill includes community reinvestment provisions like job training for areas hardest hit by the failed drug war‚Äîto make them more economically vibrant, fair and just. Let‚Äôs make marijuana legal but also invest in undoing the damage done by a war gone horribly wrong.
A marijuana conviction is often a life sentence‚Äîpeople can‚Äôt get jobs or many business licenses, and they can‚Äôt get food assistance like SNAP or public housing if it's a felony. The @abaesq found over 45,000 collateral consequences facing formerly incarcerated people.
And it‚Äôs not enough to just legalize marijuana, we should help those with records for use and possession convictions, and allow people currently in prison for marijuana-related crimes to petition for resentencing, which is why my legislation includes expungement provisions.
Black people are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than their white peers even though they use marijuana at similar rates. If we truly want to be a fair and just nation we need to correct for this disparate treatment of enforcement practices.
The Marijuana Justice Act doesn‚Äôt just end the federal prohibition on marijuana‚Äîit also incentivizes states to change their marijuana laws if those laws are being enforced in a way that disproportionately impacts people of color and the poor.
The failed War on Drugs has really been a war on people‚Äîdisproportionately criminalizing poor people, people of color &amp; people with mental illness. I‚Äôm reintroducing the #MarijuanaJustice Act to begin reversing our failed federal drug policies. Join us: https://t.co/K4Xgmai5xk

I‚Äôm not in this race to tear people down. I‚Äôm in it to build people up and bring people together to make progressive change and build a country that's more fair and more just. https://t.co/XSa9bUWr2G
I know that together, we can‚Ä¶ we will, rise.		I hope you‚Äôll join me. https://t.co/NqOSrlvaS7
Despite our divisions, the hatred of some, and the economic hardship of many, together we will ensure that our generation and generations to come will achieve things others say can‚Äôt be done.
When I went down to Washington, people told me it was a place where you couldn‚Äôt make change happen, but I‚Äôve been able to pass laws that start to turn the tide against mass incarceration and spark historic investment in vulnerable communities.
When I moved to Newark to protect tenants from slumlords, people told us we couldn't win. Well, we beat them. When I was mayor, we showed the doubters that impossible things could still happen in our city.
I've spent my entire career running toward big challenges others had given up on, bringing people together to do things that we were told were impossible. That's what our country needs right now.
People feel left out. They worry that the lines that divide us right now are stronger than the ties that bind us. I‚Äôm running to change that.		In America, we have a common pain, common challenges. But what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose.
The promise of our country, that this is a country that works for everyone, is hanging in the balance. When we should be coming together to take on our biggest challenges, there are forces at work trying to split us apart.
I want to take a couple minutes and share a few thoughts about why I‚Äôm running for president:
Thanks for the pic. I miss my dad. He died days before I was elected to The Senate. 	He had wise words that kept me grounded. When I graduated Law School: "Boy u got more degrees than the month of July but you ain't hot, life's about the service you give not the degrees you get." https://t.co/A7y05UVKKd
He told me when I was growing up that I was his "stunt double."		Shout out to @JulianCastro for not being the only presidential candidate that has a doppelg√§nger. https://t.co/hxwMlMo4QK
So grateful for your kind feedback. Thank you. https://t.co/gGlLr4t2PE
Michael this really moves me. Thank you for joining our team. We will work together to honor your Paw Paw and all of our ancestors who lived so that we could have a better, more just life. https://t.co/YSM4cuIB67
So grateful for my family in Iowa who gathered to watch me launch my campaign.		My grandmother was born and raised in Des Moines and I owe that community and the church she grew up in so much. #Roots https://t.co/V91sNG7OR3
We‚Äôre building this campaign together the right way: I won't take a single dollar from corporate PACs or federal lobbyists.		Our campaign will be funded by real people -- like YOU!		Chip in now to join our team: https://t.co/NrgbUJ5MpA
My dad used to say to me: ‚ÄúBoy, don‚Äôt forget where you came from and the people who sacrificed to get you to where you are.‚Äù https://t.co/PqESzfPUYG
My soul belongs to God. I fear no man. 		And I believe that anyone's individual capacity to denigrate will never be as strong as our collective power to elevate. https://t.co/YBEwRD9FjK
Thank you for this commitment. https://t.co/RWlEuoy0OS
That is not the call. The call is to unite with people around our shared values and ideals. Too many of us focus on the hate of the some and not the limitless potential strength of the active many.		I am more worried about the silent disengaged many than the hateful active few. https://t.co/HF8f1KtOZH
Huge gratitude for your support. This means so much to me and my family. Onward! https://t.co/JYsNvmxw5D
Last thing I will ever do is insult you. I sincerely wish you and your family the best. May both you and I get better at extending grace even when we disagree and at being tough without being mean. All the best. https://t.co/wcQdFPok7h

RT @ABC7Annalysa: Just interviewed Senator @CoryBooker. Here‚Äôs what he had to say about Kavanaugh. #SCOTUSNomination https://t.co/BgNvMsUMOO
The fact that Kavanaugh believes that a President should not be subject to civil litigation or criminal investigation while in office means that Trump just nominated a justice who has already reached conclusions on these serious questions. That should raise enormous red flags.
President Trump is currently a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation‚Äîthere is a clear conflict of interest inherent in the President nominating someone who could be the deciding vote on a number of potential issues from that investigation that could come before the Court.
Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs at stake with Kavanaugh on the Court: the rights of women to make their own medical decisions; the rights of Americans to quality, affordable healthcare; civil rights; voting rights; the rights of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions; &amp; more.
#Happy4thofJuly! As we celebrate &amp; rejoice in America‚Äôs blessings, let‚Äôs also take a moment to reflect on the fact that we in this country are inheritors of a great legacy. We owe a debt for our freedoms that we can‚Äôt pay back‚Äîwe have an obligation to pay it forward.

But instead of trying to work with @SenateDems on any of the bills we‚Äôve introduced to lower drug costs for Americans, Trump and @SenateGOP passed their tax bill which resulted in the 10 largest drug companies using their windfall to buy back stock, not to lower drug costs.
Trump should also endorse my bill with @SenSanders &amp; @SenBobCasey ‚ÄúThe Affordable and Safe Prescription Drug Importation Act‚Äù that would also lower costs by allowing safe importation of drugs from abroad.
If Trump truly wants to lower prescription drug costs he should endorse our bill ‚ÄúImproving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act‚Äù that allows Medicare price negotiation, ensures innovation in developing meds &amp; discourages companies from spiking drug prices.
Trump's announcement today on prescription drug costs is a talking point, not a plan. Trump won‚Äôt allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug costs. He won‚Äôt allow for importation of drugs from other countries.

Congrats to @ConorLambPA and the people of #PA18 on this incredible victory. 		This is another stark reminder that every vote counts. Democracy is not a spectator sport‚Äîget out and vote! https://t.co/22F2OBocpC

The dream of our land can‚Äôt be real or secure or safe anywhere until it is made so everywhere. 		We have common pain, let us unite in common purpose. 		Columbine and Camden; Newtown and Newark; Parkland and Paterson. 		Never Again, Never Again, Never Again.
Local leaders valiantly struggle; 		Local police courageously face military weapons;		Activists call to a nation‚Äôs moral conscience. 		‚ÄúDo you see my children, do you care about our kids?‚Äù		And still thousands of beautiful people of equal worth and equal value continue to die.
In communities like mine, gun violence continues. 		Children killed.	Women murdered.	Young men slaughtered.	Families torn apart.	Carnage unabated. 		Between mass shootings, the gunfire does not stop. 		Between horrific national headlines, beneath even local news focus, we die.
A young man I knew was murdered at the top of my block yesterday: Shahid Smith. 		He was killed by an assault weapon that does not belong on my block or any street.		Shahid lived below me in Brick Towers where I lived for 8 years. 		His life mattered.	His death must matter.

My love goes out to the #WomensMarch2018 ‚Äì I'm with you in spirit. Unfortunately, because of the #TrumpShutdown I'm in the Capitol fighting for a solution that gets the government up &amp; running while protecting our military, CHIP funding, Dreamers &amp; more. 		We will prevail.
The way forward is clear: Republican leaders and the President must pass a bipartisan solution like the one on the table to reopen the government, restore CHIP, and provide a place in America for DREAMers.   		The American people deserve nothing less.
If anything, tonight has revealed once again ‚Äì the President does not have compassion for our fellow Americans who he put in this perilous situation.
But tonight when the President and the Republicans refused to let that bipartisan solution be put forward for a vote ‚Äì it became crystal clear they are willing to play political games with American lives.
And the frustrating thing is ‚Äì there‚Äôs a solution on the table right now. It‚Äôs supported by Republicans, by Democrats, and by most Americans.
President Trump and Congressional Republicans claimed they wanted a DACA solution that would provide relief to the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who are American in every way except for a piece of paper.
The Republicans control the White House, Senate &amp; House. With that power comes a basic responsibility to keep the government open.   		Tonight they failed, and now the American people will suffer. #TrumpShutdown

And it is deeply frustrating that Puerto Ricans are being treated like second-class citizens. We must do better by our fellow Americans. This is a matter of justice.
At the end of the day the Trump Administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been woefully inadequate. We must hold them accountable.
At a minimum, Medicaid funding and the federal matching rate for Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands must be temporarily increased to 100%.
I am pushing for Congress to include a Medicaid fix in third emergency disaster relief bill for areas impacted by last year‚Äôs storms, including Puerto Rico. This is crucial. https://t.co/EBPjHKXRf5 https://t.co/KctBY0lops
Up to 1 million Puerto Ricans are at risk of losing their health coverage because of a Medicaid funding shortfall. It is cruel.
Hurricane Maria resulted in the largest blackout in US history. And nearly 4 months after the hurricane hit, 40% of Puerto Ricans are still in the dark. Full restoration of power isn't expected until MAY. That's an unacceptably long time.
Right now there are 3.4 million American citizens in Puerto Rico. They are our neighbors, our fellow citizens and we must do more to protect them in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/0pbrMdDAGw
