If you can‚Äôt understand why people get later abortions, listen to those who have. Their voices deserve to be heard, their stories deserve to be honored, and they deserve compassion, not judgment.	https://t.co/ZTYafM3bC3 	https://t.co/RHDv0ekheK 	https://t.co/AwxNNUNChe
Inflammatory lies about later abortion not only spread dangerous misinformation, they villainize pregnant people and families who have had an abortion later in pregnancy, usually under difficult and tragic circumstances.
Health care isn‚Äôt one-size fits all. Every pregnancy is different. Your health should drive important medical decisions as your pregnancy progresses‚Äîand politicians shouldn't interfere. You deserve care based on your unique circumstances &amp; your doctor‚Äôs best advice.
People in these tragic situations deserve accurate information about their health and the health of their pregnancy, not judgment and government interference. Patients+doctors need every option possible, not restrictions by politicians that tie doctors‚Äô hands and shame patients.
Pregnancy is a complex process, and complications can come up at any time. Conditions that impact the pregnant person‚Äôs health or the fetus‚Äôs survival often can't be detected until later in pregnancy. Some pregnancies ‚Äî no matter how many weeks ‚Äî will never be viable.
The vast majority of abortions happen very early in pregnancy. When they happen later, it‚Äôs almost exclusively because the pregnant person‚Äôs health or life is seriously at risk, or the pregnancy is no longer viable. https://t.co/GSZIFAG4Sd

7 Ways To Protect Your Healing Heart When The News Is Full Of Sexual Assault https://t.co/HsTJuzDp1F
If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault, there is help available. @RAINN is a good resource. Planned Parenthood health centers are also a safe space for survivors of sexual violence. #BelieveSurvivors
And low wage workers (who are more likely to be queer, disabled, or POC) can be especially vulnerable to threat of job loss.
People may fear they‚Äôll be blamed, not believed, re-victimized, or face retaliation. They may not be able to access services for sexual assault survivors, or trust the institutions that provide them.
The experience of discrimination and oppression, on top of the valid fears or concerns that already prevent many survivors from sharing their experience of sexual assault, can make it harder to speak out &amp; seek help.
And they may be more likely to be targeted because of prejudice, or the belief that law enforcement won‚Äôt pursue their cases.
Discrimination is a major risk factor for sexual assault. People facing discrimination are more likely to work in high risk or low wage occupations, have a hard time finding work, or face homelessness, which increases their risk for sexual violence.
LGBTQ people, people with disabilities, and people of color all face disproportionate rates of sexual violence. It‚Äôs important that we name and dismantle the power structures that contribute to sexual assault.
Anyone can be sexually assaulted. But discrimination and oppression make people more vulnerable to sexual assault.

To all survivors: We believe you. We‚Äôre here for you. It‚Äôs not your fault.
Sexual assault is a crime. If you or someone you know has experienced this type of violence, you‚Äôre not alone, and help is available. Planned Parenthood health centers serve patients who are survivors of sexual violence every day. @RAINN is also a great resource for survivors.
You can help survivors of sexual assault: Listen. Believe them. Remind them that they‚Äôre not alone. Don‚Äôt judge or blame them for what happened. Remember that the blame is on the person who commits the assault, and not on the victim.
Survivors of sexual assault deserve respect. Survivors also deserve access to the full range of health services and support ‚Äî including emergency contraception, rape kits, STD testing, PEP, and abortion.
You never have to talk about a sexual assault unless it helps. And it‚Äôs never OK for someone to pressure you into talking about it if you don‚Äôt want to. The decision to call police or file a report is yours to make &amp; not everyone decides reporting their assault is right for them.
Dealing with the aftermath of rape or assault can be overwhelming. Talking about trauma isn‚Äôt the same for everyone. Many people find it helps them heal. Others say it can feel like the trauma is happening all over again. It can take a lot of time‚Äîeven years‚Äîto feel safe again.
Most sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone the victim knows, or even with a romantic partner.
When someone does something sexual to you without your consent, it‚Äôs sexual assault. No one gets to tell you, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù When it comes to your experiences, you‚Äôre the expert. You‚Äôre the one who knows what effect it had on you, and you‚Äôre allowed to feel those feelings.
Many survivors of sexual violence have chosen to publicly share their stories despite the doubt, stigma, and shame heaped upon them ‚Äî some of them for the first time after years of silence. #MeToo
