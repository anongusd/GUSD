It is an imbalanced society that blames women. That excuses mens poor behaviors. That calls for a ‚Äúpublic stoning‚Äù. I pray for all of them and that their emotions are lifted so they can see clearly. #khole #jordan #redtabletalk @jadapinkettsmith #jadapinkettsmith https://t.co/T7Rq8x4DUx
It‚Äôs so sad that @jordynwoods has to face so much public scrutiny. For one I believe her but the amount of hate that is being thrown at both parties is harsh and uncalled for. We as women have to stand up for each other more...
