Special assessments can be used for construction and reconstruction, but cannot be used for maintenance. #lmcleg
? from members on other city tools 4 street maintenance- prop taxes have been subject to levy limits, which have blinked on &amp; off. #lmcleg
Tax exempt prop do not pay prop taxes- Some cities have 50%+ tax exempt properties within their jurisdictions. #lmcleg
The League believes HF745 is a fair approach to maintaining the city street system. Groups in opposition rely on system. #lmcleg
Furthermore, special assessments are not deductible for tax purposes. Prop taxes &amp; street improvement districts are tax deductible. #lmcleg
Special assessments have a benefit test. The amount assessed can't exceed the amount that the project increases the prop value. #lmcleg
Some cities are no longer using special assessments. The benefit test is too onerous, esp w/ instability in the housing market. #lmcleg
