@anamariecox What surprised me is that it's "more than 20" who have come forward. That's a lot, and suggests even the most cursory of checks by the WH would have made clear he was not qualified and could not clear the Senate.
@anamariecox You have a point, but Ronny Jackson also said, "Yes, I am the right man for this job." when asked to do a job he knew would require background vetting and a protracted approval process.
Tester says the committee effort "is bipartisan in nature" and that he and @SenatorIsakson share the same concerns and they are working together to get answers.
Tester says the committee has not corroborated the allegations with any additional documents/IG reports. "It's verbal so far," but from credible sources.

@navvento @seanmdav I think the replies and comments just underscore that there is nothing simple or easy about implementing this kind of federal policy, regardless of how one feels about it its chances of success.
@seanmdav Definitely not that simple. The issue of training is a real one. Concealed carry not enough. Law enforcement officers have to regularly train and recertify. The LEOs in my family have to requalify 3x/year, with 100% accuracy for the rifle test, and guns are their comfort zone.
@bradheath @jameyo Seems like you get around legal challenges by making it opt-in, not a requirement for employment. Similar to airline pilots. Another consideration: it requires thorough and consistent training. Not a one-and-done session. LEOs have to regularly re-up firearms training.
@bradheath Great point.
@JrVarTeam Weak argument, we're not talking about LEOs, but civilian employment. What about movie theater workers? Shopping mall employees? Can the government require you to arm yourself as a condition of your non-law enforcement job? Opt-in training is one thing, forced-in is another.
Not sure how requiring the arming of teachers is legal on its own merit. The right to carry a gun, and the right to NOT carry a gun,  would seem to be protected by the same vexing Constitution, no?

@PMBrief Yep, my point is there's only 1 realistic path to pass a big immigration bill and it requires Democrats.
@LastWordWilliam That is very true. This is a problem Congress has refused to solve, but it is Congress's problem.
@brianrell @RosLehtinen Anything is possible. But a comprehensive immigration bill by Feb. 2018 would be a Washington Miracle.
@PMBrief Could, but that is a path for a bill that passes with a majority GOP votes. And GOP has been anti-comprehensive bill for years.
The only realistic path I see for a DACA-bill to pass is to let Democratic leaders take lead to cut deal with Republicans like @RosLehtinen https://t.co/zjCz7CxeAd
@LastWordWilliam Yes, that seems to be the plan. And consistent with administration approach to Congress.
@StevenJDuffield It's certainly possible, but it would have to be GOP leaders essentially handing over the floor to Democrats. The politics are tough.

@_KatieMM_ @JP_Delahoussaye This could end up being a very popular short-term argument with long-term consequences.
@JP_Delahoussaye Yeah, seems to be more about being anti-Trump than anti-Gorsuch. Democrats argued harder and more personally against Betsy DeVos.
@JP_Delahoussaye Dunno. Hard to game out the Democratic "win" here except the obvious political calculation that the base is angry and wants a fight.
Hard to connect dot that Dems' consequence for GOP = making it easier for President Trump to fill another SCOTUS seat if/when it happens. https://t.co/QFIoWn1uro
