@RepMcSally @RepGosar @andybiggs4az, in #AZ, #ACA premiums are up an average of 116% this year https://t.co/d02ZObJcfr #Obamacare

@SpeakerRyan Provide risk pool stabilization funding 2 states, Cultivate healthy risk pools, Give more choices, Allow subsidies off exchange
The top 50% of population ranked by expenditures accounted for 97% of overall health care expenditures; lower 50%, only 2.7 percent of total
@C4AHC calls on #Congress to provide $20B in annual funding for risk pool stabilization. We estimate such funding to lower premiums 20-24%
2017's ave.annual nat'l premium for "Silver" plan for a 40-year-old w/o subsidy=$4,929! That's up $1,000+ since 2014 https://t.co/d02ZObJcfr

@HouseGOP, @C4AHC research shows large premium &amp; cost sharing growth and a reduction in choices. Individual market is rapidly deteriorating. https://t.co/ROv5Ni8ZzI
#ACA has made it more difficult to utilize tax-preferred mechanisms such as Health Savings Accounts (#HSAs) to help cover high cost sharing.

.@jwhite_health: The public option is a bad option. The public option's goal is to create competition, but competition can exist without it
.@jwhite_health: Consumers shop for health insurance based on premium prices, not cost-sharing. Thus, insurers offer high deductibles.
.@jwhite_health: Deductibles are increasing on average by about 20%. Deductibles are so high b/c it allows insurers to charge lower premiums
.@jwhite_health: HSAs can help people afford skyrocketing deductibles, but there isn't enough awareness amongst patients about this tool
.@jwhite_health: Taxpayers pay for the subsidies offered on the #ACA exchanges. Cost shifting doesn't make healthcare plans more affordable

@jwhite_health: #ACA enrollment is only half of what CBO originally projected. As a result, risk pools are smaller and sicker than expected.
