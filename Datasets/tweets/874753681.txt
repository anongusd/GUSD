There would be no private prisons or private schools, or private parking, or private public transportation. No proprietary voting machines, or public infrastructure running on proprietary software.		American "Democratic Socialism" is both limited in scale and imagination
A truly Democratic Socialist nation would solve such a problem by nationalizing utilities and operating them without a profit motive which only insensitivises such utilities to fight the solution to climate change (a decentralized renewable energy grid)		🔥🔥 NATIONALIZE IT 🔥🔥
1. upgrading infrastructure to accept and distribute excess energy from homeowners is expensive	2. so is generating energy only when it's needed (as opposed to base energy production)		Utilities cannot operate profitably if we are to address climate change..
A look at the energy crisises in Australia and California shows that decentralizing energy production through solar and other renewables by generation at the point of use inevitably bankrupts utilities. Consumers pay less and private utilities go bankrupt for two main reasons..
The only way to ensure it's responsible use is to		🔥🔥 FUCKIN' NATIONALIZE 🔥🔥
Oil companies cannot operate at a profit without subsidies, yet we still need oil for plastics. Yet it's use as fuel and plastic pollution is destroying our environment, and it's not all that profitable to recycle plastics, even though it's quite easy to do so
Health insurance? Auto insurance? Home owners insurance?		🔥🔥 NATIONALIZE IT 🔥🔥
Take for example insurance, a product that fundamentally contradicts itself and rips consumers off by merely existing. To turn a profit insurance companies must deny as many claims as possible while collecting the most from consumers.
A real Democratic Socialist America would formost subordinate business to "the people, " businesses would not have the "right" to operate, rather the privilege. Best fucking behave. A democratically controlled government would often dissolve and nationalize businesses
That I'm aware of we don't have real Democratic Socialist politicians in the US, much less Socialists..		Fucking thread:

@Libertarian247 Government can create wealth however. It's exactly how all the weapons manufactures are going to get rich off this Venezuela coup, by printing money to pay for the weapons
@Libertarian247 Oh I know. 😂👍 You're proving my point 		How is wealth "created" with a finite money supply then? It's fantasy to think a workers wage isn't somehow comprised of money redistributed from somewhere else in the economy, it's redistributed to the rich currently
Love how libertarians can simultaneously think we can't print too much money because it's finite (or should be because of inflation) but that somehow wealth is just "created" and not simply a measurement of who exploited the working class the hardest https://t.co/AgqaWu2Bgp

@DavidAstinWalsh @1aprildaniels Nuclear would likely be prohibitively expensive to do safely. The sun is the safest nuclear power plant anyway, and all that needs to be done is harvest it's energy
@1aprildaniels @DavidAstinWalsh My reply comes from being annoyed by the college-left and it's opposition to studying anything they perceive practical to stick it to business, while all their generalized education requirements are arbitrarily set by rich liberals who think capitalism can be ethical
@1aprildaniels @DavidAstinWalsh And yes, it is just a matter of swapping equipment. I trust scientists more than authors to know of existing technology that can solve the climate crisis.
@1aprildaniels @DavidAstinWalsh Insecure? No. Insecure would be forcing engineering students to study humanities in the process of trying to prove how important they are. The "problem" of engineers being sociopathic ass holes is a symptom of our economic system which elevates their class status.
@DavidAstinWalsh Yes, let's solve climate change by not using energy efficiency or renewable energy sources. What are you going to do paint about it? write your way out of it?
@DavidAstinWalsh If politics would actually assign engineers to the task, yeah actually, some 'engineering hack' would solve the crisis. Only someone with no interest or knowledge of engineering would say something like that

@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter Beyond what I have already said is that the vast majority of the rich don't actually innovate, what they do is leach form labor and refuse to pay for educating labor so that the most amount of people can innovate
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter So tax the rich providing for the basic needs of people, like me, who want to write software but can't you capitalist piece of shit
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter Yes, tech workers created open source software which anyone with the desire to contribute to can innovate on provided they have the free time, which is dependent on their necessities being already met dumb fuck
@Manzoire @akstonsdiner1 @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter Exactly what I'm talking about
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter The truth that you don't want to hear is that poverty itself is not a sufficient motivator
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter How about a proposal that places the tools for essential needs directly into the hands of each individual, after that we can continue to bitch about where money needs to be placed. Instead we're bitching about whether poverty is a sufficient motivation to be self sufficient
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter If you actual stood for innovation and success, you would argue that wealth should be destributed based on the value that it creates for the most amount of people
@akstonsdiner1 @Manzoire @JonathanHoenig @AnnCoulter Successful at what? skimming profit margins off the labor of workers who create the products that provide necessities. Fuck that. What you're arguing for is not innovation, you think money should be placed in the hands of people who do little more than hoard wealth

@_memorable2 Yes, WE know their immorality has everything to do with some sort of "sickness" / lack of compassion, but that's because atheism is simple not-theist but try to explain that to the general public especially after the "why don't you run around raping then" arguments are validated
@_memorable2 Based on how Bernie Sanders describes his "spirituality" I think he's atheist, because it's exactly how I've always described my spirituality, I think he, like many just doesn't want to admit he's an atheist. Someone that rational cannot possibly think the universe was "created"
