@Bakari_Sellers Thanks @Bakari_Sellers I'm sure they are waking up everyday disappointed in your lack of approval of their political appearances and beliefs.
@thehill @DailyCaller @washingtonpost Can we get the manifest (passengers) on the recent Congressional flight overseas led by @SpeakerPelosi We would like to know how many staff, friends, donors and family also traveled in the delegation.
Watch the Dem default:  @realDonaldTrump is bad; then any issue concerning racism and sexism (with no comment about Virginia leaders) and then climate change. The economy would totally tank under a Democrat admin. They are just not tuned in to small business working families.
@Bakari_Sellers @StaceyPlaskett Yes, she is quite dopey...and partisan to the core.

@TODAYshow The average voter doesn't buy in to the partisanship and the use of a convicted, spurned felon to work with Dems to present "dirt" on @realDonaldTrump. Never Trumpers love it. But, it's all old news...just a TV show to try to smear our president.
Cohen admits he was being represented "for free" from Democrat  loyalist/attorney Lanny Davis. He admitted he worked with @RepAdamSchiff  @RepCummings and other Democrats on his testimony. This is an attempt  to smear @realDonaldTrump by a convicted felon.

@RealJamesWoods The rabid, radical left wing cannot wait for a MAGA supporter to retaliate. Then, the media will claim it was their fault. It is painful to watch - like the Turning Point Cal Berkeley video. But, the media is waiting to pounce and twist anything that shows MAGA violence
@NBCNews So, the next question is, with your penchant for creative stories, will your next stop be CNN or MSNBC?
@JRubinBlogger @allinwithchris Jennifer, was there illegal voting or did he just amplify the number?
@politico Of course she didn't comment. She's an empty suit who would rather race bait and divide our country.
@politico Or, in other words, he reported a story to the police that CNN, MSNBC, NYT and WAPO would love.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuck, Democrats have cheated in NC politics for years. In the last gubernatorial campaign, the loser, incumbent Pat McCrory, unsuccessfully argued for a full investigation into Roy Cooper's campaign irregularities in the same counties now being examined. Democrats always cheat!
@BillKristol Bill, don't worry, we don't expect you to withhold your unending and implacable ad hominen attacks on @realDonaldTrump no matter how bone tiring they are (*especially coming from a Republican).
@tribelaw @JRubinBlogger Securing the borders is not a farce. America elected @realDonaldTrump and we see the expense and harm caused by illegal drug, gun and human trafficking as well as illegal immigrants just wantonly "jumping the fence."
@NBCNews Did he just say that? Did he just accuse the media of ignoring the families of so many young men (and bystanders) now being shot over the massive Mexican Cartel Drug Gang War now being waged in Chicago?
@RealSaavedra @AdamSchiff Because he jumped to conclusions for a political purposed and is trying to do the same to carry on a narrative against @realDonaldTrump Just like how he met with Fusion GPS's Glenn Simpson in July 2016 to start the fake Russia collusion narrative. https://t.co/S8hqZ9NkAU
@thehill Can you blame him? Can you imagine the outrage is a white guy had claimed that Obama supporters had beat him up? Smollett combined his hatred for whites and Republicans in one choreographed hoax. This must be punished to the fullest extent allowed by law.
@dbongino NY sealed its fate by electing AOC...she doesn't understand jobs, the free market economy, the merit and achievement based system where you work hard, plan well, save your money and achieve as much as you can through capitalism. She favors social engineering and socialism.
CNN's Avlon, Berman and Camerota giggled today that even though Mueller's investigation might be ending, other investigations are just now starting, including state inquiries in NY and NJ and congressional investigations. Sending encouragement to their friends = HRC/Advisors

@rollcall The Democrats and Republicans both did it...it was known several elections ago. It was never investigated and did not change the outcome of this election. SEAT Mark Harris.
@nprpolitics I think we just need to unseat any candidate that has gotten votes in these counties including the last gubernatorial race where Gov. Pat McCrory vehemently protested ballot irregularities in these counties but the Democrats argued against an investigation.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump David, what's going on with the owner of your newspaper being sued by Nick Sandmann of Covington (KY) HS for $250M and tweeting his junk a la Anthony Weiner.

How did we get such hyper partisan folks in our intelligence services? The fact that Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, etc and others, including Comey and McCabe all exhibit such hatred against Trump amazes me. America voted Trump into office and are not stupid.

@brianstelter Yes, but he has had Trump Derangement Syndrome for years now. Brian, you will literally report or say anything to try to damage or undermine this president. The sole function of CNN is jump on Trump no matter what.
@brithume No evidence and nobody calls him out on it...just a lot of unrelated facts he tries to combine to weave a narrative that is filled with innuendo and supposition. I have lost faith in Media to unbiasedly discern facts and report the truth.

@MaxBoot Drug dealers push drugs; if there was no cartel, there would be fewer drugs to push and get people hooked on. A drug dealer's greatest victory is to get someone hooked who becomes a repeat customer.
@PostOpinions @MaxBoot Max, glad you have become a Democrat campaign strategist. Hope that works out for you.
@latimes @latimesopinion The Mexican Drug Cartels make about 45 billion a year shipping and selling drugs in America, as well as trafficking women/girls and assault weapons.

@thehill So, Wikileaks is run by Russians and the communications show a strategy of the Russians to collaborate and conspire with the Trump campaign. And there is communications where Stone advised Russia to buy Facebook ads to sway stupid Americans to @realDonaldTrump Is this the story?
@politico People with money pay to isolate their families and themselves from bad stuff. Unemployed people. Bad public schools chocked with illegal immigrants. Drug dealing. Cars on blocks and indoor furniture and loud parties in front of houses. Poor illegals drift to poor towns.
@brianstelter You are twisting the data by comparing all drugs seized to all the drugs that might get through the wall. Like the Yale/MIT immigration study that claims double the number of illegal immigrants are here at 22 million? Do you dispute this study of the numbers from two top schools?
@Angry_Margarita @TheMemeWarrior @SenBobCasey Most of the drug violence is being perpetrated by criminal actors. Like Trump said. Crack down hard on drug dealers. But, people who want to avoid the system and acquire guns illegally always will. Then you just have a registry of law abiding gun owners.

@ChangetheB Mark Harris won the race. Period.
@McCreadyForNC Mark Harris didn't hire anybody. His consultants hired a political worker who has not been proven to have done anything to change the outcome of the election. You lost and have sour grapes and are trying to steal the election.
@politico That's really your headlines? #fakenews is when you twist and slant the facts to slam the news/newsmaker you hate and promote the news you like. It's called bias and this article is the perfect example of trying to cast this press conference in the worst light possible.
@thehill I smiled when Stacey talked about the "Artificial Electoral College" in her talk this week. Of course, no one called her out on the system - no secret - we have all used since the beginning.
The two things that convince me that the Deep State runs things. First, there is a debate about asking those living in the U.S. whether they are legal citizens. Secondly, jurisdictions are fighting to claim residency for those in prison so they can get extra government funding.
So a MIT/Yale study finds double the number of illegal immigrants in the country and the Supreme Court must decide on the government asking whether people living in the U.S. whether they are citizens?  https://t.co/5J0aQOrJpJ

@margare24279378 @USATODAY Cartels sell 40 BILLION in drugs to Americans each year and are one of the most sophisticated and profitable business enterprises in the world. And, you point out one (?) one drug bust as evidence we don't need a wall? The Cartels use about 30 ways to get drugs in.
@latimes @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson   Should the US sue California to get its billions back they squandered on the high speed rail project they just deep sixed? We could use those billions to chip in for the new border wall.

@rebeccaballhaus @AnnCoulter You, @MaxBoot and @BillKristol can have a nice glass of Pinot together tonight at the club.
@AnnCoulter I worked on Capitol Hill 40 years ago and politicians were debating illegal immigration way back then. @realDonaldTrump - however you see what he is doing - is the first president to take a decisive step in the right direction. All others gave "El Toro" "Come on In" lip service.
@SenatorShaheen @realDonaldTrump is taking the first substantial action in over 40 years to secure the border. A porous border means more drugs and human trafficking and misery, expense and loss to poor and blue collar families. Elitists will never see the drug wars, kids getting hooked etc
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions Max, I worked on Capitol Hill almost 40 years ago and there was an illegal immigration debate going on. If you can't see the rot, misery, expense and problems rampant illegal immigration has caused many poor, blue collar families, you are truly in an elitist bubble.
@charliespiering WOW, CNN talking to the victims of illegal immigration? Can we do it prime time?
@USATODAY A vote will be wonderful at a time Trump's approval is 52%. The Dems  could show they support drug and human traffickers and Drug Cartels  making billions by getting our citizens hooked. And, thumb their noses  at angel moms and victims like Cpl. Ronil Singh and Kate Steinle.
@brianstelter Brian, you are so hilarous...I'm proud of you for being a media leader of the Never Trumper Resistance Movement.
@pkcapitol @ktullymcmanus So this is Trump's fault? The Dems control the House and GOP controls the Senate. I suspect both are tired of rampant protesters, activists and, yes, even journalists chasing Congressmen in the Capitol. Not authoritarian at all...probably just setting rules and procedures
@ddale8 It's easy to have done a great job on the border because of how the previous administration ignored the problem for 8 years. At least Trump will have his 8 years to fix the problem.
@BillKristol Illegal immigration has an enormous cost to our education, law enforcement and health care system. Many illegals come to deal drugs, get citizens hooked. The expense and lost productivity is enough for the wall. Employers say a major problem is applicants passing drug tests.
@TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi Dems are on the wrong side of history on drugs. Every effort you make for Open Borders = soft policies on human trafficking and illegal drugs. In poor U.S. towns, drug peddlers fueled by cartel drugs work hard to push drugs and get people hooked. Must be stopped!
@TianaTheFirst Total lie and Dem talking point to undermine border security and promote Open Borders. These percentages assume that we know where ALL illegal drugs cross into the U.S. It's like illegal immigration: experts say 11 million; a Yale/MIT study says 22 million. We just don't know.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Dems know nothing except for RESIST RESIST RESIST. None are compromising or trying to be bipartisan, including you. To get something very important done for the American people, this is the route that @realDonaldTrump must take to secure our southern border.

@deborah36719698 @politico He said he thought the coliseum held 8,000. It held 6,500 and it was packed. At least that many people were outside. So, let's say $13-15,000 came out to see him. I saw pictures of the Beto crowd and I think 5,000 (in his hometown) would be extremely generous.
@NBCNews Democrat grabbed a hat on the way in and furthered a "Trump violence against the media" narrative for the far left. Who was he? Was he arrested? Did he have a rap sheet? Was he a Democrat?
@TheDailyEdge @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/6jVaEE84q6
@politico Most ridiculous story. Fire dept says it doesn't give attendance estimates outside but they are being quoted that Beto had anywhere from 7-15K when his rally was OUTSIDE. Trump's rally was 100% full and there looked like an equal number were outside watching on screens.
@maggieNYT @marklandler So, was he "shoved" or "attacked" and was it unprovoked? Was he arrested for assault? Did he have a record? Was he a Trump supporter or a Dem plant to further a narrative? Are their any facts? Seems you are jumping to conclusions based on your bias against Trump.

@zahiratorres So, the coliseum was completely full with thousands outside who couldn't get in. I saw the photo of the Beto talk. Since you are an unbiased, professional journalist, Zahira, were there 1,000 people there to hear native son Beto? Didn't look like it to me.

The cartels enforce their Mexican turf by threatening or bribing their competitors, law enforcement agents and judges. In the U.S., they shy away from violence for fear of focusing the public's attention on the illegal drug trade. "In El Paso, murder's bad for business."
"Faced with U.S. law enforcement pressure, the cartels quickly shift ground, changing their points of entry, the size of loads, kinds of vehicles used, time of day they move and even the cargo being smuggled. Confrontation interferes with business, and business comes first."
"Large loads of valuable drugs are abandoned rather than risk a fire fight with U.S. law enforcement. Instead of a range war against U.S. border defense personnel-a war the cartels are very well equipped to fight—their agents drop their guns and run when they are confronted."
"Violent confrontation in the United States is not in the Mexican cartels' best interest. Violence focuses U.S. public opinion and law‐enforcement power against them, so they avoid confrontation in this country with iron discipline."
"Politicians fail to grasp that the Mexican cartels are not interested in power or violence for their own sake. They want to do business, to sell drugs-not create chaos. They will go to great lengths to protect their business interests, but they are opportunists, not terrorists."

@cspanwj @RetireRevised @ReutersMoney Amazing interview. Mark didn't equate SS with welfare but talked about age eligibility increase as a "cut in benefits."

The Democrats conveniently ignore entrepreneurship, the proposition that if you educate yourself, learn a skill or trade, save your money and either take a risk or invest your money, you can build wealth. The mantra is that some are born lucky and others aren't. We aren't India.

@JeffBezos @washingtonpost Ok. But please ask reporters to use time-honored journalistic standards and not weaponize their opinion in the news pages?

It's called free market because anybody can start at any level and achieve success.

@TheRevAl 300,000 new jobs in January, Al. Most of these folks do pay their taxes, unlike you. You are the race pimp pedaling dependency, victimization, lower expectations. You need to be railing against the 70%+ black illegitimacy rate and ask "where are the dads?." #wherearethedads

@CoryBooker Corey, we are happy with the numbers of the Administration creating 300,000 new jobs in January. I know you want to make everybody dependent and on welfare. But, most of America is happy participating in the free market U.S. economy and are looking for six more prosperous years.
@CoryBooker Corey, do you feel that 70%+ black illegitimacy (7 out of 10 babies born to single parent households) has hurt the black family and their ability to excel in a free market economy? https://t.co/ucAjOd7nNI
@SpeakerPelosi 300,000 plus jobs added in January. @realDonaldTrump is putting all people back to work! This is what makes America the envy of the world. We are prospering as a people. If you aren't working, you aren't trying or you can't pass a drug test...
@seanhannity What a freaking joke...the Socialists will try to out-Socialist each other. The rest of the world wants to get into the USA for capitalism, freedom, the right to earn and keep your money, good schools, the shear opportunity to excel based on hard work. @CoryBooker is against this

@BreitbartNews Amy, @POTUS did come to America's kitchen tables Sat., laying out the problem, his solution and a compromise that has his base up in arms. Dems promptly told him to stick it. And you want HIM to come to the table? Let's be serious.
@PressSec @DanScavino @stevenmnuchin1 @realDonaldTrump @BeschlossDC ABC, NBC and CBS all declined to carry the White House national address on live TV...is this the first time a pres wanted to address the nation during a serious domestic crisis and networks refused to broadcast?
Reportedly, ABC, NBC and CBS spent a lifetime in the news business - 27 minutes - on the Cohen/Buzzfeed story. But, all of these networks declined to carry @realDonaldTrump presidential address on the gov shutdown. But, no slant, no bias, right?
@SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi Ok, total partisan gridlock. #pelosishutdown will continue! Screw your union gov employee friends (AFGE) and the DACA kids. The wall is immoral but spending millions flying around the country and using taxpayers to pay for hundreds of thousands in alcohol is not?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuck, you have never solved the problem...you love kicking the can down the road. All those employees are your constituents. Tell them that you have no proposal, no plan, just 100% no compromise. #gridlockisgood #SchumerShutdown #resistTrump
@SenBobCasey Bob, you are part of the problem...you have done absolutely nothing to solve our porous drug or immigration flow since you've been in Washington. You are king of "Let's Kick the Can Down the Road" club. Your tweet is hilariousl With no Dem compromise, let's keep the workers out.
@CNN Pres. Trump clearly stated the situation and transparently laid out a compromise. The Democrats are acting like children. Fine. The AFGE members will continue to suffer, military flights will be grounded. Let's see who wins...certainly not the employees.
@SenCapito @POTUS The Dems want to keep their friends/union ally, the America Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) off work a little longer. Most Americans are sympathetic but maybe the gov employment rolls need to be purged a little as well. If @SpeakerPelosi doesn't care, why should we?

@jciv @DavidNakamura John, at some point you have to acknowledge one of the best economic periods (growth + employment) in recorded history and love America more than you hate Trump! Wait for the announcement this week!
@jciv @DavidNakamura Rory Gamble, UAW vice president, said in response to the latest news,  “We would wholeheartedly support this, if it happens, and we expect that  Ford and VW will create jobs for families and communities that are  good-paying union-represented jobs.”
@jciv @DavidNakamura "Additionally, Volkswagen is looking at having Ford build  vehicles for VW in the U.S. market. That would be such a win-win for  both companies. Volkswagen has nowhere near the market share that it  should have as the largest or 2nd largest car company in the world."
@jciv @DavidNakamura OK, John, lets wait until next week when this big announcement comes through:  https://t.co/zZd4Khpyh7
@jciv @DavidNakamura John, I know you are a Democrat Genius but you responded to my report of a auto manufacturer expanding in America from the last week with an article from 2017.

@Acosta https://t.co/48jaWVlIO2
@TomFitton Yale/MIT estimates 22 million illegals; CTR for Imm Studies estimates 63% of Illegals get welfare benefits. Another estimate is that each illegal costs the US about 70-80,000 a year in services, including schooling for children. Add up these numbers and that's a pretty big crime.
@maggieNYT Sounds like more evidence of the Deep State looking for any way to get Trump. Can you write another story about Peter Strok, his girlfriend, the back and forth texts showing Trump hatred and the unorthodox FISA warrant process? This is what is stunning!
@dcexaminer No hurry...lights are on, water is flowing, cashed a check, bought gas, went to the pharmacy, ate at a restaurant. Most Americans would never know there is a shutdown unless they turned on CNN. Let's see if Dems come to their senses.
@JeudiJuetten @DavidNakamura @realDonaldTrump has been 100% right so far, esp with one of the best economies in history, the lowest unemployment and the highest growth. I get the sense that a lot of voters are just now understanding what a fabulous economy they would be putting at risk following Dems.
@cenkuygur @IngrahamAngle So Cenk, you can't read though? "Illegal" does not mean "Legal." We have a contract to teach English to the 1 million immigrants we welcomed in this past year. But, having another 2 million jumping the border puts a strain on money for @DeptVetAffairs and the ELDERLY.

@DavidNakamura Dave, you do understand I'm sure that if Trump engineered a much, much better deal for America with Mexico, reducing their trade advantage and bringing hundreds of millions more in tax revenues back that, in effect, he is balancing the playing field and getting Mexico to pay.
@realDonaldTrump Barrier solves humanitarian crisis and improves interdiction. Slowly, we're closing a loophole Open Border Dems love. Drug pushers would have fewer opportunities to poison our kids and get women hooked and into  prostitution. Is it the only avenue? No. A critical foundation? Yes.

@CNNPolitics BUILD THE WALL! You are keeping the government closed. This is the @SenSchumer shutdown. Build the wall that @realDonaldTrump wants and open the government back up. Quit playing politics!
@CNNPolitics @SpeakerPelosi Please build the Ronil Singh Memorial Border Wall. You never, ever say one word about Kate Steinle or thousands who have lost their life based on your soft immigration policies. You have the temper tantrum. BUILD THE WALL!
@Acosta You are not a reporter...you are an activist with a mic. You would never, ever in a million years say one thing positive about the admin so quit saying you are balanced. Your job is to attack the president and try to be political. Worst WH journalist I've ever seen. But its CNN.
@BlazeTV @AOC Can somebody explain to aoc that people die coming here to achieve their dreams w/o hi taxes. People work 60, 70, 80 hrs a weeks to start a business. The tooth fairy doesn't do it. Wages? Don't like them? Start your own company! Watch Shark Tank? Anyone can be an entrepreneur!
@Acosta She mistook you for a journalist?
@realDonaldTrump If I were @AFGENational and/or @WeAreALPA and had concerns about the "Ronil Singh Memorial Border Security Shutdown," I think I would be on the horn to @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @LeaderHoyer @WhipClyburn etc. about appropriating funds to secure the border. That is the pathway.
@MittRomney Your "suits" got me to drive 2 hours at 5 am to be your polling place "monitor." But, the "suits" had not registered me as such. Your campaign was weak, seriously flawed and deferential to Obama. Your elitist, bitter, resentful attack on @POTUS showed you are still out of touch.
@SenSchumer Chuck, you, @SpeakerPelosi and @LeaderHoyer and other Democrats who ignore Cpl. Ronil Singh's death at the hands of an illegal immigrant are the problem. You have no concept of border security. Until you wake up, all of those thousands of non-essential gov. workers will be home.
@markknoller @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @Scavino45 So, who is the shutdown going to hurt more? Trump and his hard-working, entrepreneurial base? Or, Pelosi and Schumer's base of government workers, illegal immigrants and Wendy Williams watching SNAP beneficiaries? Maybe there should be some negotiating from the left?
RT @GOPChairwoman: You know the numbers are strong when the MSM can't hide their shock and amazement.		Thank you, Mr. President! https://t.…
@realDonaldTrump My power/water are on, DMV is registering cars, police are patrolling, grocery and pharmacy are open and street lights are bright. The shutdown is not affecting me. If the Democrats are worried about their MD, VA and DC workers, maybe they should come to the table?
@realDonaldTrump This is not @realDonaldTrump  shutdown. This is the "Cpl. Ronil Singh shutdown" because no  legal immigrant/American should ever lose their life to an illegal  immigrant while doing their job. Anyone who supports open borders and  sanctuary cities supports Singh's killer.
@Fuquar1 @SpeakerPelosi Most of the job growth in America today is from people launching their own company and working 60, 70 or more hours a week to make it successful. Entrepreneurial activity, a la "Shark Tank" is what makes being an American so much different than being from any other country.
@SpeakerPelosi This is not @realDonaldTrump or your shutdown. This is the "Cpl. Ronil Singh shutdown" because no legal immigrant/American should ever lose their life to an illegal immigrant while doing their job. Anyone who supports open borders and sanctuary cities supports Singh's killer.
@SpeakerPelosi Surely, you know about entrepreneurship, the quickest way those on the bottom can rise to the top. Taxing hard-working folks as they start their companies only keeps them down. The Democrats don't ever seem to talk about those who sacrifice everything to lift their families up.
@RepJeffries @NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Most clueless and corrupt bi-coastal reps: @RepJeffries @NancyPelosi  @SenSchumer @ericswalwell @AdamSchiff @RepBarbaraLee @RepJerryNadler  @RepGregoryMeeks @AOC Come hang out in middle America to learn the many problems you ignore.
@AndrewJLurie @washingtonpost @MittRomney @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Andrew, do you want protection for yourself and your family? Are you comfortable with open borders and having 50 illegal immigrants flood into your neighborhood and all send all of their children into your children's school? Can we raise your taxes to pay for these folks?
@csites73 @JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv Democrats in North Carolina cheat everyday. You are only upset when you candidate lost. Harris WON.
@mkraju Shutdown doesn't bother me either. Had a nice holiday. Electricity is flowing, tap water is flowing, groceries/pharmacies are open, DMV is open and police are patroling. Shutdown affects lifetime gov workers (Democrats) in DC/VA/MD suburbs doing non-essential work. No compromise.
@AndrewJLurie @washingtonpost @MittRomney @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer Andrew, do you lock your doors and have a fence around your house? This is @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer Democrat shutdown. They are not budging. Pelosi wants more officers killed by illegals like Ronil Singh in Modesto, CA.
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv Has there ever been a more offensive candidate than wild-eyed Dan ("Greedy") McCready begging for money on Facebook and calling Harris a thief? He is horrible...a liberal activist in a Marine uniform. The election is over. Swear Mark Harris in immediately!
@JoeBrunoWSOC9 @wsoctv Never has a party be so complacent while the Democrats try to steal this election. Mark Harris won. Period. Harris voters deserve to have him sworn in. If it is proven that there were political shenanigans dating back 20 years, you can't invalidate all past elections.
@washingtonpost @MittRomney Did Utah elect you to join forces with @NancyPelosi and @SenSchumer to attack our president and be on the side of Open Borders and an Economic Slowdown?
@CR @RandPaul Romney's team got me up at 5 am to serve a polling place as his "monitor." Except his campaign had not registered me as such. His campaign was weak, seriously flawed and deferential to Obama. Romney's bitter, resentful attack on POTUS Trump reveals he knows he blew it.
@dcexaminer Thank God this Socialist Manly Boston Woman is running. "Pocahontas" has virtually nothing in common with hard working, entrepreneurial middle Americans trying hard to feed their kids. She wants to take away from their families to give to the 60% of illegals on welfare.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You should be ashamed of your lack of support of border security. The death of Cpl Ronil Singh is on the heads of those who usher in illegal immigrants and work to keep them in America. Why won't you support the President's plan for border security to keep us safe?
@seanhannity Power is on. Spigot water is flowing. Policemen still patrol. DMV open.  We're still functioning fine. The shutdown affects DC census workers  advocating for counting prisoners as residents &amp; those delaying  development over the heel splitter. Let it continue.
Power is on. Spigot water is flowing. Policemen still patrol. DMV open. We're still functioning fine. The shutdown affects DC census workers advocating for counting prisoners as residents &amp; those delaying development over the heel splitter. Let it continue.
@thehill Where do you live? We will move 50 refugees and illegal immigrants in your neighborhood...we want to raise your taxes to pay for their welfare and we want them to pour into your children's school to change the culture and take up resources. WE TOOK IN 1 MILLION LEGALLY LAST YEAR!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Rep. Pelosi, you should be ashamed of yourself.! Your soft immigration policy and support for sanctuary cities got California Cpl. Ronil Singh killed. You and @SenSchumer want to jam as many illegals into our country and get them on fed assistance...to get votes. Shame on you!
@kayleighmcenany California has set the tone for the most anti-American and anti-law enforcement policies when it comes to illegal immigrants being given sanctuary...even those who have committed multiple offenses. God bless the Singh family and Corp. Ronil's family.
@thehill You place more concern on these illegal immigrant kids than  the kids that are cheated in schools by the flood of illegal immigrants who take up vital resources in those school and demand English as a Second Language classes. Do you agree to live among a large group of illegals?
@thehill Great reporting on the treatment of illegal immigrants, most of whom are trying to bypass US law and enter the country any way they can. It appears the children are uncooperative and I suspect most of the growing caravan immigrants will continue to be uncooperative. Fake News.
@PressSec My favorite @MickMulvaneyOMB congressional speech was when he asked what was going to be cut to increase spending. The other MoC were in awe. Cut? What if we framed issues like:  illegal immigration welfare and services means less money for vets and the elderly?
@NancyPelosi Watch the media "Kiss Nancy's Tush" during this press conference and contrast this with how they treat Sarah Sanders and anyone associated with @realDonaldTrump No, the media are not biased liberals looking to slant every story they see...of course not.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Nancy, move into a small town that has been overrun with illegal immigrants, send your kids to a school where half don't speak English and then have a car accident with an illegal alien with no insurance. Come enjoy blue collar life with the illegal aliens you advocate for.
@WhitfordBradley An elitist view is I'm right and everybody else be damned, especially those damn traitors and fools who voted for Trump. Forget he won the Electoral College and most of the counties in America. But, as an American, you are free to call him names along with CNN and MSNBC, Bradley.
Everybody is a victim and wants to champion their behavior to force others to accept it. Whether it be sex, sexuality, race, creed, immigration status, all want to impose their views, further isolating them from the mainstream.
https://t.co/PnMeWZBvu3 One of the most ridiculous, embarrassing skits in SNL history. Just mind-numbingly bad.
@charliekirk11 Any Elderly person or Veteran who votes Democratic is voting to give away his/her benefits to illegal immigrants. There is not enough money to support everybody.
@dcexaminer Simply put, we just will have to take away from the Elderly and the Veterans to make sure we feed all of the illegal immigrants flooding our country.
@BuckSexton So embarrassing to pimp for Loren Michael. HORRIBLE any way you frame it. Trying to be relevant to a grotesque level. So out of the mainstream, hideous and obnoxious. Any kid who thinks this is cool is a freak.
@jasoninthehouse We have already determined it is fine to subvert normal communications channels, destroy evidence under subpoena and share classified information with impunity. But, don't be associated with @realDonaldTrump or you're in big trouble!
@kylerothenberg @FoxNews We need to move about 50 of these folks next door to all of the no border apologists including CNN's Scuitto, Acosta, Cooper, Lemon, etc. as well as @ChrisVanHollen @NancyPelosi @BernieSanders @MaxineWaters @SenSchumer
@ByronYork https://t.co/MnM5OzA8qW
Clear eyes not sycophantic and idealist. They believe in one thing, themselves. We love that the pompous, elitist Philippe Reines is still shilling for her for another run. There is nothing we would rather see than Hillary at Tumbleweeds Rallies.	   https://t.co/uJwkeEQ8pH
@maureendowd Tipping Point Reached where not all WAPO, NYT, MSNBC, CNN journos are Clinton lapdogs and sycophants. A&amp;E gave us a clear, balanced trilogy of the Monica affair now Maureen sees them with clear eyes. After all these years, the 'loyal" media friends are starting to defect.
@Jeanjeannie20 @dbongino @MonicaLewinsky @realDonaldTrump Against Hillary? I know Mothra. She has skated without scrutiny. But, you should read Maureen Dowd's piece on the Clintons in today's NYT.
@dbongino Ken Starr was investigating Whitewater and Paula Jones and @MonicaLewinsky were dumped in his lap. Mueller, conversely, is actively squeezing any and everybody to find some shred of dirt to tie on @realDonaldTrump Is a SP a broad blank check to vet and re-vet a sitting president?
@dcexaminer Love the Democrat overreach. @NancyPelosi and company don't care about the American people, only their power and bringing down Trump. Preoccupation with investigations and bringing down @realDonaldTrump will only serve to boost him for 2020. Dems literally have no message.
@seanhannity Perfect...love Democrat overreach. Let's now preoccupy the government with "getting @realDonaldTrump " especially for stuff that happened 25 years ago. Derangement syndrome. Would like to do a psychological profile of these Democrat's obsession with bringing him down in any way.
Bernie says Fox News is owned by @realDonaldTrump and was depressed when Hillary, who he thought had a 75% chance of winning, won. Has there ever been a politician more in the D.C. Northeastern bubble than Bernie and his Socialist agenda?
Good journalism once featured unbiased, balanced reports presenting  both sides. Now, major news outlets boldly proclaim their opinion as  facts. They bend info to further their point, often using innuendo and  conjecture. "Expert" panels  all parrot their views.  Bad journalism.
@DailyCaller Race pimp...making a career out of trying to elicit white guilt instead of analyzing why, after trillions in social/New Deal programs, blacks as a whole are slipping further behind. My great, great grandfather did things I don't agree with, but it has nothing to do with me.
@Acosta Jim, why don't you move to a rural area with your family and send your children to a public school overrun by illegal immigrants who can't speak fluent English? Your reporting is one-sided and reflects someone with an elitist, secure, insulated lifestyle.
@dcexaminer Lots of airlines will take them to another country that is better in their eyes. Why not move? There is no caravan of Millennials headed to Syria or Thailand. Why not take the leap to a fabulous country like Guatemala or Columbia? Seriously, why stay in such a terrible place?
@DailyCaller She brought five of her kids? How many does she have that will need to be fed, clothed, provided healthcare and education? Where is her husband...is he there to help? This is not an asylum case. She cannot jump in line in front of others who legally are trying to come to America.
@washingtonpost Ridiculous opinion piece. The socialist and fascist left sends their thought police followers to attack conservatives in restaurants, college campuses and even Congress. The Left is the party of groupthink, censorship and violence against those who hold a differing opinion.
@thehill Sanctuary City Nancy? Insider Trader Nancy? Open Borders Nancy? Anti-law enforcement Nancy? Anti-ICE Nancy? Tax and Spend Nancy? Great choice to run the Democrats' message as House Speaker. Please, Please, Please.
@dabeard @AP @SFGate Almost all of the countries in this part of the world regularly dump huge amounts of trash into their waterways daily. It is common and accepted. It is repulsive.
@thehill Thanks for running Stacey and for bringing the Big O to Georgia. But, you sound a little like Hillary trying to dream up an alternative view of how you got beat.
@StephenGutowski @RepSwalwell Swallwell is a joke, a media darling because he dependably bashes the right. But, he looks like a kid in sixth grade with marbles in mouth trying to act like a serious adult. Perfect for California.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta No one loves the attention more than this grandstander. He believes he is leading the charge for the 1st Amendment. But, he is defining arrogance, opinionated and biased reporting and rude and obnoxious questioning. Hopefully, the WH is developing rules for decorum for reporters.
@DailyCaller @SenSanders Such tolerance coming from the crazy socialist uncle who lives in the attic... https://t.co/6iTKfCqps9
@CNNPR @Acosta @FoxNews Can I have a WH press pass too? I publish on Twitter.
@peterbakernyt @Acosta Acosta? The activist who is fair, unbiased, balanced and respectful in his coverage and not an activist grandstander who tries to hijack the press conference and make news? You know, the one who starts out with "I want to challenge you on...." The hatred &amp; disgust is amazing.
@ACLU @realDonaldTrump Maybe the White House pool should just consist of reporters not activists who want to debate the president or try to insult him with their questions. Many in this pool are so far left with a vision of America so skewed, they will never be unbiased or balanced in their coverage
@NYDailyNews Did anyone really think Amazon HQ was headed to a Red State...or they would hire a @realDonaldTrump supporter? Their company, their HQ, their newspaper (WAPO), everything about Bezos screams liberal NYC and D.C. Glad to see them goosing real estate values in those cities.
@CNNnewsroom @brianstelter CNN is an activist, anti-Trump opinion channel that "demands" to take up all the airtime in the room. 95% negative Trump opinion. They call Trump a fraud, liar, white supremacist, racist, etc. 24-7. @Acosta and @AprilDRyan are not news gatherers. They want to be the news.
@gordon_phil @joelockhart When leftists don't have an argument they always default to racism, white supremacy, fear mongering and, if this doesn't shut you up, they just come to your house and terrify your wife or run you out of a restaurant. Or make fun of your appearance at a WH Corr. Dinner.
I am waiting to hear more from the larger media outlets condemning the terroristic threatening at @TuckerCarlson home last night. Not seeing much. We would be hearing more about Tiki Torches if the target was on the Left.
Matthew Whitaker was fine as a backstop guy at @TheJusticeDept Now, he is Public Enemy #1 in the media. They try to rip, tear apart and demonize anybody associated with @realDonaldTrump But, they give the Dems a polite pass.
Tweets lamenting Susan Blasey Ford's sacrifices for coming forward. First, she made that choice. Not one of the "witnesses" backed up her account. She could not remember who drove her home, which is the person who would/could collaborate. And, she got about $800K from Go Fund Me
I was just pondering who CNN could send to the WH as @Acosta replacement. @abbydphillip is surely liberal but she seems to be a true news gatherer. CNN would do well to get an unbiased trained reporter rather than a narrow view, opinionated grandstander to fill this role.
@sutcasa @KevinJerpi @mikiebarb @AllisonFox4News @PressSec @Acosta @acosta challenged @realDonaldTrump on a political point. His time was up. Reporters do not run WH press conferences or briefings. Free speech does not equal insulting or badgering the president, giving political opinions or speaking out of turn. Not a free speech issue.
@HallieJackson @whca Please boycott...please boycott....please boycott. And, while you are at it, please host a training session on WH press conference protocol. The president calls on reporters as he chooses. You may be unhappy but this doesn't give you the demand the right to grab others' airtime.
@JebBush Jeb, these "questions" are attacks. Obama, Earnest, Gibbs and Carney got incredible treatment. WH reporters practice groupthink...it would be nice if media hired reporters who knew Middle America. Questions are fine but not framed as innuendos and attacks. And, there is protocol.
@PressSec The WH Correspondents Association is threatening a walk out. If reporters feel they can't abide by the WH rules, standing up and interrupting (@AprilDRyan ) or demanding to ask multiple questions (@Acosta ) or trying to laugh at the @POTUS (@BrianKarem ), they should walk out.
@Acosta CNN anchors spout 95% negative opinions 24-7. Very little reporting. The Podesta Wikileaks dump showed all the anchors attended parties for HRC before the election. CNN is biased and hates that Middle America chose a president. Fox allows debate; CNN is an extension of the DNC.
@NewsHour @PBS @Yamiche @realDonaldTrump Framing a divisive question to imply @realDonaldTrump is a white nationalist is insulting. Obviously, she was subtly accusing the GOP of racism/Nazi intent. It was a racist question by a reporter who is obviously preoccupied by her own skin color. Like April Ryan.
@KevinJerpi @mikiebarb @AllisonFox4News @PressSec @Acosta Acosta's one question started with "I want to challenge you..." The President took the question and, per protocol, he moved on. CNN doesn't get special treatment. To not give the mic to the next reporter and given an "arm block" to the intern is inexcusable and unprofessional.
@brithume Modern day Democrat party. Stifle free speech. Hey @donlemon, Tiki Torches? Really? The violence and hatred is spewed by the left. Look at the baseball shooter, confronting @SenTedCruz or @SarahHuckabee at restaurants. Screaming protestors at the Capitol. Unhinged and dangerous.
@Acosta You and CNN are a DNC extension. You hate Trump, reflected in your reporting. If there is a negative angle, you will find it. Aggressiveness is fine. But, are on a political crusade. Fake News=omitted positive stories &amp; an overall interpretation/spin to your liberal world view.
@the_deaninator @joelockhart So you pushed the waitress at the restaurant and used the defense that it should have been a waiter? Don't get your logic. Are you defending abusing young women under any circumstances? Is it ok to "arm block" the young lady?
@PressSec Totally biased "reporter" using force to retain the microphone. This force was against a defenseless young lady. Acosta hates @realDonaldTrump The treatment he and the WH Press Corp gave Earnest, Gibbs and Carney was so chummy. Now they try to intimidate and attack.
@NBCNews We Americans condemn the obviously one-sided, partisan attacks posing as questions at WH news conferences. Some of the WH media hates @realDonaldTrump  but loved Obama, Carney, Gibbs and Earnest and sucked up to them. TEACH OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM AGAIN.
@RedNationRising Acosta doesn't have a right to take up other journalists' air time at a press conference. He had a question which was accusatory, not an inquiry. He has a grudge and tries to play out the leftist agenda in his questions and reports. Clearly biased. He did arm block that intern.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Great assessment. The key? Pres. Trump's high octane motor and ability to draw tens of thousands of voters. The consistent conservative message is attractive, but the down to earth, honest delivery is very refreshing in an age when most politicians have no intention of delivering
@CNN Really. Hmmmmmmmm. https://t.co/ZOUYO4sDew
@joelockhart Joe, reporters that use questions to insult rather than inquire, continue to speak when asked not to and who slap at women interns don't deserve the "hard pass." When you stand up and start talking (April Ryan) without being called on, you may be next. I'm sure you had protocol.
@sunny @Acosta Try to be unbiased, but I know this is possible on a network that is 95% opinion with 95% of those opinion far to the left of America. Journalism schools used to teach students to check their opinions at the door. But, now journalists use questions to try to accuse or insult.
@BrianKarem @Acosta @PeterAlexander Ridiculous assessment. The public saw the exchange although CNN AC360 declined to show it tonight. He is constantly trying to use a question to make an implication, accusation or political statement. CNN is 95% negative reporting about the Trump administration. We know the M.O.
@NBCNews @realDonaldTrump The African American White House journalists and others, including CNN's Nina Turner and Symone Sanders are preoccupied with race. They constantly imply Pres. Trump is a racist. This PBS reporter's "question" was more of an implication and accusation than inquiry
@MonicaCrowley Her daughter has a new HBO documentary about "the bubble." The GOP has to win 23 of 30 toss up races to keep the House. Let's hope that a lot of people outside the bubble understand the consequences of losing the House and VOTE!
@kayleighmcenany @RonDeSantisFL Gillum will destroy Florida's economy...no question Florida will be much worse off if Gillum wins...Trump has revved up the economy where there are now 7 million job openings. Watch what happens when Gillum raises taxes and ruins the tourism and retirement economy in the state.
@FoxNews @NancyPelosi Conservatives win either way... GOP wins and keeps both houses. Or, GOP loses and Pelosi, Waters, Carden, Swallwell, Harris, Booker etc. start investigating after investigation gumming up government. Great  platform for GOP in 2020. Dems don't know how to govern!
@SteveScully @cspan @rushlimbaugh @realDonaldTrump @WHPressSec @KellyannePolls Kudos for broadcasting the Trump rallies. However, surprisingly, when you went to the CSPAN cable description of the Trump rallies in the last few days they were labeled either Public Affairs or Campaign 2018. Why not "Trump 2018 Rally" or "Obama 2018 Rally?" Trying to hide this?
@benshapiro The liberals heads are exploding because Trump is winning...listen to racial activist Nina Turner or April Ryan on CNN. When you have no argument, you allege racism. Many in the most reliable Dem voting bloc, blacks, are getting good jobs and leaving the party. The media divides
@CNN CNN anchors unabashedly shill for Dems and mock @realDonaldTrump every day with 95% negative coverage of this administration. When Wikileaks emerged all of the CNN folks were attending a pre-campaign party for Hillary Clinton. Let's not get sanctimonious about bias...
@maggieNYT Maggie, is this all you got today negative about Trump? Did the DNC not supply you with any more negative tips so you can try to rip him any more today? Just glad you don't write about the record unemployment, GDP growth and millions lifted off food stamps.
I'm sorry, I have yet to hear a compelling argument from the Democrats about why we should move away from an historic economic revival that lifted millions off food stamps. Now, @BarackObama disavows all that came before him, but wants to take credit for the economy years after.
@NBCNews So, you don't take medicine, drive a car, fly in a plane, live in public housing or receive government benefits or open a bank account or cash a check...any of dozens of ways you normally have to participate in everyday life in America. Correct? Sounds a little disingenuous.
The funniest comment this morning...thanks Jr. for lightening my day. Is @donlemon still employed? Is so, does CNN approve of this reverse racist language? #MAGA @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Gq1NylXADR
Will never be reported...the lib base is worried about losing their greatest voting bloc of all time. Are we gradually moving from the "nanny state?" https://t.co/QHZJbCJD9E
@cspan @cspanwj Super segment with @HBO documentarian Alex Pelosi. She sees the Sanctuary Cities and illegal immigration angst in 	Purple Country and both the rednecks and lib elitist.		I think.		@SteveScully unfunny SNL clips are annoying..CSPAN is showing its true colors....
So, if those in the immigrant caravan are scared for their lives in their own country, couldn't they find safety, security and asylum in Mexico? Why do they need to cross that entire country to get to the U.S.?
@ABC @karentravers Reporters whose lens only filters a liberal perspective honed through a liberal Northeastern education. These reporters never visit the rest of the country and, God forbid, work with those who have lived or think differently. Elitist Perspective and Propaganda.
@ABC Yes you are.... https://t.co/Zv9C1DJwr7
So, Timothy, how many illegals committed crimes or were arrested last year in America? How many accessed free medical care, were on SNAP, received free housing, crowded our public schools or brought gangs and drugs to our communities? True cost? https://t.co/QO9zbkwz2k
@TwitterMoments Loren, give me about 3 minutes and I will make up the coolest SNL skit about this jughead former actor with an uncontrollable leftist resistance anger. Can we do a cartoon of this guy. Ranting. Wild Eyes. Blustery. Threatening. Would be hilarious!
@ananavarro Perfect! A wonderful place for you to rant and rave incessantly about @realDonaldTrump with a group who will not only enable but wholeheartedly support your deep seated grudges against the President. One-sided screaming, venting show....made to order for you.
@townhallcom Helping legal immigrants, latinos, blacks and single moms off food stamps is bad? @realDonaldTrump @MickMulvaneyOMB have put people back into the work force in 2 short years. Phenomenal! Next, infrastructure. Reversing a decade long Socialist trend is heavy lifting! VOTE GOP
Democrats have recruited military veterans to run in this year's midterm to try to fool voters. They will vote with @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi Our economy is the best in our lifetime, lifting up legal immigrants, blacks, latinos, women. "A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats." VOTE GOP https://t.co/4DybDgUhyh
@FoxBusiness @realDonaldTrump @thehill @dcexaminer @FoxNews So, we just got these unbelievable economic numbers today...with 7 million job openings just before a midterm election. Have to hand it CNN to ferret out the REAL NEWS  https://t.co/13zWPvOdwf
So we want to exchange incredible success with distractions and even more investigations? We really want to ruin one of America's great historic economies led by @realDonaldTrump ? We want to gamble with all the progress we have made in two short years? STAY THE COURSE https://t.co/cpjr7na3BL
@McCreadyForNC Voting for Dan McCready is a vote to gum up the House on endless investigations of @realDonaldTrump, adding to the distractions. The Republicans have historically stimulated the economy and put two amazing Judges on the Supreme Court. Don't gamble with Success!
@NickReisman Great, now will Gillibrand repeat Delgado's lyrics about women, Iraq and his N****** to her children on air if these lyrics are so mainstream? His rap lyrics may show a cultural divide and a mindset but bringing them up is not racist.
@DailyCaller @AndrewGillum So glad that the anchors for CNN and MSNBC all picked up on this quote...it's not news unless it is negative speculation about a Republican. They ignore bad news about a Dem...and hype any hint of bad news about a GOPer. We call it Fake News.
@RonDeSantisFL Law and order. Professional management. Incredible economy. Dedication to Service. Florida would throw that away from an Obama Wannabe already under ethics investigation? Charlotte NC had a similar "up and coming" mayor (google) Patrick Cannon. Sentenced to 44 months.
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY @NancyPelosi would marshall her colleagues to start investigation after investigation to harass @realDonaldTrump and impede the historic economic gains we have made. 7 Million Open Jobs. Voting against Trump to damage the economy is unconscionable. Don't ruin prosperity!!
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Chris, if the rap lyrics are acceptable and off limits for Faso, will you repeat all of Delgado's rap lyrics about women to your children word for word on air? Are you proud to go to a public place and recite these lyrics? You are acting more &amp; more like a mouthpiece for the DNC.
@CNNTonight @donlemon So the media's divisive Democrat mouthpiece anchors - @ChrisCuomo @andersoncooper @donlemon want to call out white people? Cuomo talks about the Delgado rap lyrics being normal but which he wouldn't repeat to his children. Come on...stop the "fake news" rhetoric!
@BuckSexton CNN should suspend Don Lemon and his show immediately for this Racist slur. Put the shoe on the other foot and focus on the terror threat from black men. Talk about divisive...this is the fake news @realDonaldTrump talks about. No news, just resistance Democrat talking points.
@BreitbartNews There is a cottage industry - birth tourism - so non-citizens can exploit this loophole. El Chapo, the largest drug cartel boss, sent his girlfriend to LA to birth his daughters. https://t.co/dlixnJ7slD
@BetoORourke Beto, you are a naive dilettante, who literally believes that El Paso is safe just by accident. The drug cartels need to stay low in El Paso not to attract attention. You are open borders, anti-capitalism and would be a resistance vote. Dangerous for Texas.
@MadelinePBerg Sad that you don't pursue NBC, MSNBC and CNN higher ups about their coverage as well.
@thehill CNN and MSNBC go as hard to the left as an extension of the DNC as possible. If you think they are "Main Stream" think again. Watch them and Fox and tell me which channel tries to give opposing guests more respectful airtime without interrupting and laughing at them.
@thehill Racist comment...par for the course. Worst anchor on CNN. Totally hates @realDonaldTrump Calls himself a journalist but he is not even an intelligent talk show host. Will argue will a conservative on his show in a heartbeat. Would say anything to try to smear Trump.
@hemy_l @realDonaldTrump @Negron4Congress John James in Michigan and Eddie Edwards in New Hampshire are holding their own in their congressional races. They both remind me of @SenatorTimScott It appears both have a shot and could use a boost from @realDonaldTrump
@thehill Of course neither Soros nor another Dem organized the caravan. These uneducated immigrants from multiple countries had the idea of collectively organizing, tipping off the American media and storming America all at one time on their own. Stroke of luck.
@thehill Thank you for working hard to bring us together, Chris. And, you are mad when Trump calls you and your fellow anchors "Fake News?" Your show must be produced in cooperation with the DNC.
@ChrisCuomo We accept you are an unpaid DNC hit staffer, but lately, you are going off the rails. Especially defending Delgado's Rap lyrics to Faso. If you are so cool with these  lyrics, will you bring your children on air and recite Delgado's explicit rap lyrics word for word to them?
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Unbelievable accomplishments. The bottom line:  are we better off now than at any time in the eight years under President Obama? The answer is a resounding yes! "Community organizers" (the Resistance) are fighting a historic economy that is lifting up Latinos, Women, Blacks.
@thehill Iraq "Weapons of Mass Destruction" is all you need to remember.
There is no question...but giving more power to Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer is a vote for legislation to ruin jobs and for a preoccupation to attack @POTUS and his success. https://t.co/9CEW9fdgqC
@seanhannity Literally, Nelson seems senile...how he is so close to @FLGovScott is beyond me. He is a resistance seat warmer...way too liberal for Florida. His Pelosi Schumer hyperbole is ridiculous. Florida needs @RepDeSantis and @FLGovScott to keep the wonderful progress we have made.
@SaraCarterDC Every anchor at CNN has a liberal, Democrat agenda...John King, Bash, Cooper, Lemon, Berman, Baldwin. They are all cut from the same cloth and are working very hard as an extension of the DNC. They describe themselves as journalists...the biggest lie in the world. Fake News.
@NelsonForSenate You have been asleep at the switch and pulling against an historic economy lifting up working women, latinos and blacks. The best social program is a good job and there are 7 MILLION openings for those who want to work...unheard of. The "resistance" candidates will ruin Florida.
@ScottforFlorida Vote for two Florida candidates who will keep this historic economy going strong for blacks, latinos and women:  @RepDeSantis and @FLGovScott Why would we want to change course from a high growth, low unemployment economy? To choose the "resistance" will ruin Florida.
@bennyjohnson Nice that the mainstream media picked up on the fact that not everybody in Pittsburgh protested @POTUS @FLOTUS visit. Many thought it was a fantastic gesture to acknowledge the pain and anguish of the city.
@thehill If there is an anti-Trump citizen, @JohnBerman and CNN will find him/her. Old school religious leader blending her personal views into her religion. There are conservative, moderate and liberal religious leaders and this one obviously interprets her religion through Dem eyes.
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL Vote for @AndrewGillum and watch Florida's business climate, vacation, retirement and tourism business plummet. Who needs jobs anyway? We need social programs, right? I would never support a candidate that wears the race card on his sleeve...always looking for the racial issue.
@thehill Joe, you and the Democrats are the Mob...chasing people down in restaurants, encouraging violence. It has gone too far. Trump has never said to track liberals down at private restaurants, but you find this acceptable. Stop the rhetoric!
@FoxNews @POTUS No president has had the sheer stamina @realDonaldTrump has. At his age, he is amazing, crisscrossing the country, stumping for numerous candidates and dealing with 99% negative media. Anyone - white, black, brown or green - who works hard for a living has to love Trump!
On point...two systems of justice and this derives from our having embedded partisan left leaning bureaucrats serving years and year who are making decisions based on their political views. They see things one generally liberal way and can't understand why others don't agree. https://t.co/Ej4WvDJ1Wg
@RepMarkMeadows Hillary Clinton is under a subpoena and destroys 33,000 emails. Her exoneration is written before the FBI interviews her. Classifed emails show up on Anthony Weiner's laptop. In D.C., justice and the media aren't always fake, but certainly slanted left most of the time.
@jimsciutto Jim, when was the last time you reported on a Trump success. The WH press corp was a lap dog to Gibbs, Carney and Earnest. CNN is running 99% against Trump. @JoeNBC was literally begging ppl to vote Democrat today. @PoppyHarlowCNN doesn't try to hide her partisanship. Unfair?
@nonnashirley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump The good people referenced were those protesting the Confederate monuments and those who want the monuments to remain. You can call Confederate ancestors inherently racist, but the Civil War was part of history and you can nullify and erase that. Family relatives died
@SteveScalise I am aware of only one major political party that encourages their followers to actively confront, accost and shut down discourse...but MSM only blames the rhetoric on one side...
@morningmoneyben If you think NPR if factual, your bias is so far left, you can't see straight. Northerners love to paint Southerners as hicks and rednecks but I just got back from Revere, MA. Not different than SC. People are people. NPR, CNN, BBC, WAPO, NYT, MSNBC all hire only extreme liberals
@BreitbartNews Thanks George, you can go back to Jerry's basement now.
@BreitbartNews Companies and retirees are pulling out of Costa Rica because of 50% debt to GDP. Elect Gillum and watch businesses, retirees and tourists flee. Socialism doesn't work. This Socialist candidate would drive Florida into the ground if elected Governor.
@SebGorka @MSNBC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump CNN folks called the sender "the bomber." Repeatedly tried to tie @realDonaldTrump comments to "assassination attempts" on former presidents. Ignored many, many examples of left violence. Did the bombs have a trigger? Could they have exploded? Just smells of Primary Colors.
@jonswaine So, is this a Primary Colors scheme to influence the mid terms? Did the bombs have a trigger? Could they have been detonated under any circumstances? Assassination attempt? Looks and smells like a Robert Creamer Brad Woodhouse operation to try to make @realDonaldTrump look bad.
@rollcall @thehill @dcexaminer @WashTimes I am old enough to remember when CNN still reported the news 24-7. I could get caught up in minutes. Loved Bernard Shaw and Lynne Russell. Now we get 24-7 "slanted" opinion. When I hear an anchor say they "broke a story" I laugh out loud
@thehill Thank God we only have to look at this image for a couple of more weeks before the concession speech....Count Heidi in the Big L column.
@maggieNYT I believe @HillaryClinton also used her personal cell phone as well as a private unsecured server that resulted in classified emails being sent to @AnthonyWeinersD @HumaAbedin computer. Nice to focus on @POTUS but also reflect upon extremely poor decisions by prev Sec of State
@realDonaldTrump Thank God @HillaryClinton didn't use her cell phone and an unsecured server that most likely resulted in thousands of calls and emails being intercepted by foreign actors. Why do we not ever reflect upon how insecure her communications were as Sec of State? @thehill @rollcall
Democrats need problems to solve. Poor people. Caravans of immigrants. Perceived racism. Perceived sexism. Disparate outcomes = inequality despite unequal effort. But, if a group has not achieved or too many are thrown in jail, there must another reason. Identity politics.
@marklutchman Like there is some invisible force wall keeping black people from getting up off the couch and getting a ride downtown to get an ID. Not only is this premise widely offered up by academics, but the fact that so many white people nod their heads and agree is so racist as well.
@Acosta Jim, let us know all the reporting you and CNN have done to find out whether this is true. Have you gone into the caravan to find out why all of these people suddenly called up each other and said "let's hop over a few countries and arrive at the US just before the midterms."
@CNNnewsroom @wolfblitzer Wolf, if you ever say a pleasant or pseudo positive thing about a Republican or @realDonaldTrump I think your beard would fall off. Thanks for being the unbiased journalist we can come to appreciate from the Cable Fake News Network.
@GeoffRBennett Stop the presses......mehhhhhh https://t.co/SU5EG8IuLm
@thehill So the question is whether she has enough Cherokee blood to make prominent claims at two universities of Native American status . She is 99,9 white and is less of a minority than most Americans. Trump said if, as a candidate, a neutral test proved it, he would pay. So there.
@JamesOKeefeIII Because Democrats are doing everything they can to present themselves as conservative while taking PAC money from every extreme liberal source. They are trying to fool voters - like Dan McCready in North Carolina - that they are mainstream when they are extremely liberal.
@FullMeasureNews @SenSchumer @chucktodd @maddow @donlemon @NancyPelosi You guys are all welcome to interview Ms. Monahan and investigate. This is what @realDonaldTrump means by fake news. You slant everything to the left and omit stories that don't suit your purpose or fit your narrative.
@foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews We just need to get down to the bottom of this very, very important story. In other breaking news, 82.5 million Americans have 1/1,024th native America blood and should immediately apply for casino revenue. https://t.co/xndgpSOQVX
@AndrewJKugle The liberals are just hoping...hoping that a GOPer responds with a punch, push, slur, or scream. Guess what will make the headlines...the retaliation. What will not make the headlines? Any of what is in this video.
Would not be surprised to see @LindseyGrahamSC tapped to be our next Attorney General after the election and @nikkihaley appointed to fill the remainder of his Senate term. #PalmettoStatePower
@thehill A lot of people have a lot of time on their hands to immediately post complimentary memes. Congrats on the resistance...the rest of us are taking full advantage of the best U.S. economy in decades. Remember that the best social program is our wonderful free enterprise system.
@washingtonpost Doesn't take much recasting for those being chased in the SOBs, Capitol,  restaurants and airports around D.C. Actually, the anarchy, screaming and threats shows America how unhinged and unreasonable the left is. Also, please write more about HRC...Republicans love her cackle.
@seanspicer @NBCNews Ken, Trump won 30 of 50 states and more counties than any Republican nominee since Reagan (2623 to HRC's 489). Popular vote? So you think NYC, San Francisco, LA and Chicago should run things? Might do you well to travel around America, my friend.
The unholy alliance between professional protest groups and the media. 1. Give overblown liberal activist coverage. Ignore conservative protestor coverage! Glorify Sat. Nite Live "hit" skits. Refer to the 60's and highlight activists chasing down lawmakers. It's all one-sided.
Kavanaugh relates to middle class Americans like Sotomayor or Kagan never will. He is from metro D.C. and is a Yalie but his work ethic, sports background, love of family and boyish nature may be funny to SNL viewers, but he strikes a chord in middle America. @BrettKavanaugh
@seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @seanspicer Conservatives need to understand how to access the Capitol and S/HOBs during protests. Those professional community organizers at least know how to access to try to intimidate, scream at and threaten MoC. Conservatives need to balance.
@thehill Linda Sarsour...starts out protesting for Palestinian issues, moves to womens rights and then starts screaming white supremacy at Sen. Susan Collins. Many of these people don't work after Obama glamorized "Community Organizer." They just drift from cause to cause. https://t.co/mHYMkKJ2cv
https://t.co/gqOChRtDrF
@dbongino My suspicion is that many of the Kavanaugh women protestors live within  driving distance of D.C. hence they go to or studied at schools like  Amherst, Brown, Yale, etc. that resist free speech. They feel smarter  and entitled and have been trained on GroupThink tactics.
@thehill Spoken like a liberal Democrat who can't deal with being out of power and who doesn't want to investigate DNC Vice Chair @keithellison because his accuser has evidence and this was a recent incident...not 40 years ago. Face it, he was never voting for a @realDonaldTrump nominee.
@thehill Students who spend time together in college don't often stay politically aligned. This is a political "hit piece" with the "buddies" using their one-time brush with a judicial star to get 15 minutes of fame and to smear. Silence is the antidote for this "disrupting" their lives.
This is how the Democrats have treated women in the past...intimidation, shaming, etc. But, Democrat politicians have never been investigated or covered in the media like the right. Like, Keith @keithellison https://t.co/JBFBMPwlTL
@amyklobuchar @HeidiHeitkamp Amy, I hope you are still Heidi's friend after she is back in North Dakota sitting around a toasty iron heater sipping cocoa and regaling her friends about that time she was in the U.S. Senate before that Kavanaugh vote.
@thehill Some of these are the Maine women who have signs that call Kavanaugh a "Sexual Predator." If a women can take an unsubstantiated allegation and twist it into this, our American politics have hit rock bottom. Are we going to support and reward this behavior? @SenatorCollins https://t.co/k7TdYhOi4K
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @JeffFlake @thehill CSPAN showed Maine Kavanaugh women protesters holding up "Stop Sexual Predator Kavanaugh" signs outside the SOB. If you vote no, you are supporting the type of judgment you would never accept from a sitting judge.
@senorrinhatch @JohnCornyn Yes we take notes....remember? Do some in Congress think the American people are stupid? https://t.co/4lGXB6mlB9
@thehill So you harass @senatemajldr but give Bill and Hillary Clinton and Keith Ellison a pass. How noble you are.
@funder @senatemajldr When are you going to advocate the DNC firing Keith @keithellison. Very recent and substantiated allegations of abuse but crickets from the left. Hypocrites. https://t.co/vH5WULG501
Counterintuitive but true. Women can see husbands or sons destroyed by unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations if we automatically assume they are true. If she had facts on her side, the entire situation would be different. https://t.co/XT9wZIcPG5
@CalebJHull He'll just head over to @NPR @BBCBreaking @CNNPolitics @MSNBC and get all the attention he needs...with no blowback.
@davekent005 @PeterWSJ @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @Sen_JoeManchin @JeffFlake The FBI is fully capable of doing an unbiased job quicky. We can see some early attempts at discrediting for a fall-back position as well as the intemperate argument. Lack of time. Restrictions. Didn't interview our 40 people...see the MO? Resist. Delay. Attack the swing Senators
Conservative women have husbands and sons...it's pretty scary when the total sum of their accomplishments and reputation hang on the vague 36 year old memory of a lady who the accused barely knew and who didn't tell a soul about the incident for 30 years. @TuckerCarlson
The biggest story the left wing media ignores.... https://t.co/n0dHgtVkHK
One of the last public accusers... https://t.co/AinGdd7GWa
@senorrinhatch I have gotten 2-3 emails a day from Dems trying to raise money off of Dr. Ford. Compassionate listening to her meant nothing. Lack of facts also means nothing. @jimmyfallon @StephenAtHome @jimmykimmel @nbcsnl and left wing media have ceaselessly hammered Kavanaugh and his family.
@DavidCornDC Fantasies help left wingnuts sleep. It is not Kavanaugh's job to prove that he is innocent. It's accuser's job to provide some evidence...not speculation, wishful unicorn thinking or innuendo. America should seize and shut down beer makers if they cause sexual assault.
@realDonaldTrump Richard Blumenthal was the most sanctimonious of all senators, knowing full good and well there is no corroboration, no facts. Yet, he, @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @SenSchumer or @SenFeinstein say nothing about Ellison allegedly beating up his girlfriend...with recent proof.
@seaniedee @NateSilver538 You clearly want to believe totally unsubstantiated and uncorroborated accusations on a person whose entire life and career is the antithesis of the charges. Will be waiting to see if the lady she was allegedly with can shed details to the FBI under penalty of felony perjury.

@SebGorka @MariaBartiromo @seanhannity @seanspicer @realJeffreyLord @TuckerCarlson Can Conservatives get detailed instructions on accessing the Capitol hallways and elevators during @SenateGOP Judiciary Hearings so we can scream our case at Dem senators like liberal activists do?
@seaniedee @NateSilver538 He's acting like a guy with an impeccable career who has been blindsided by totally uncorroborated 36 year old accusations that you wouldn't want slung at your male family members. He is upset by the tactics of the left. You betcha. Even her best friend at the time doesn't agree.
@IngrahamAngle @bigleaguepol LI, can you get Conservatives information about how we can go to the Capitol and ambush liberal Dem Judiciary Members in the Capitol hallways? Jump in their face on the elevator? Also, can we get info on the 200+ arrested earlier in the hearings? They may apply for a job with us.
@JeffFlake https://t.co/yLuIKEpWIn These women appeared to be sincere...but it now feels like a Democrat Soros ploy. Can Conservatives get information on how to ambush Dems in the Capitol hallways as well? @FoxNews https://t.co/m2kXrJxh12
@NateSilver538 Innocent until proven guilty...is the a projection of yearbook slang the best you can do to try to smear Kavanaugh? "Repeated deceptions?" Anyone can Accuse Anyone of Anything at Anytime? Does this make it true? 36 year old yearbook posts? Really? Don't you find this sad?
@MaddowBlog @SenWhitehouse Conspiracy theorist. I don't find you credible. In his mind:  Drinking Beer = Sexual Harassment. Innocent until proven guilty? Absolutely no facts. First reported this in 2012 to a therapist, 20 years later. No collaboration. Anyone can accuse Anyone of Anything.
@FoxNews @ChrisCoons Democrats:  Jeff @JeffFlake has answered your prayers and given the FBI longer than the A. Hill investigation. If the results are the same, I look forward to seeing a bi-partisan vote...wouldn't you expect 10-20-25 Dems to cross the aisle and vote for Kavanaugh? Reasonable?
@thehill I'm glad Tester has an open mind...He is a @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer liberal democrat more in step with San Francisco or NY City. How in the world he got elected is beyond me. This is the best Supreme Court nominee in my lifetime. @SenatorTester
@mattbai After hearing 200 resistance protesters scream and disrupt at his confirmation hearing, you think he was in the mood to engage a stranger in the room? Perhaps if the Democrats had shown a modicum of professionalism. But, not when protestors are running folks out of restaurants.
@brithume He got played...looked like a deer in the headlights after being trapped on the elevator. Give in and you just encourage the resistance crazies who chase Republicans out of restaurants. Listened to Blumenthal who used the additional time to hammer Kavanaugh on the Senate floor...
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity So, was Keith Ellison angry and defiant when he beat his girlfriend up?  Any comment about this? Crocodile tears when it suits the Democrat narrative but  crickets if it might cost the Democrats...@SenSchumer 's silence speaks volumes. And it wasn't 35 years ago.
@SenJeffMerkley Jeff, so what's your position on Karen Monahan. Should Keith Ellison immediately suspend his Minnesota AG's Campaign and resign from the DNC? We're waiting on your official comments on the matter.
Dr. Elaine Heath, distinguished educator/author/former Duke Divinity School Dean. Allowing a few students to rudely interrupt her formal lecture shows a total lack of institutional control. How a distinguished school like Duke allowed this eludes us. https://t.co/ktFiVFoXiD

@AnnCoulter I've known a few punch drunk boxers that took way too many shots to the cranium in their career. But, no, on second thought, they weren't as dumb as the Queen of Hawaii.
@SenSchumer So, are you calling for an Keith Ellison to step down from Congress, his Minnesota AG campaign and his position with the DNC? I believe his accuser, don't you?
That a lone 36-year-old allegation comes at the 11th hour doesn't deter the accuser from seeking to direct the timetable of how the U.S. Judiciary Committee does it's job. Reminds me of campus protesters who disrupt class, interrupt speakers, make demands and destroy property.
@DailyCaller I know when I'm considering my choice for Supreme Court nominees, the first person I always turn to is John Legend. No, honestly, let's just say as a distinguished political authority, John is a tremendous musician. Stay in your lane John!
@townhallcom Would love to have Cory "Dumpster Fire" Booker or Kamala "In Your Face" Harris as 2020 Presidential Candidates. Obama 2.0. Campaign slogan:  "Hey, let's resist, divide people, promote victimization and destroy the economy!"
@RepMattGaetz 98.9% anti-@realDonaldTrump coverage on CNN. They are never fair and come at each story advocating such a far, far left wing perspective that it is hard to watch. Cuomo's family is steeped in NY Dem cronyism for decades. But, you got your point and you stood toe to tow. Amazing!
@MSNBC @maddow Thank you @maddow @HillaryClinton for the airtime. The more the public sees how dismissive HRC is of losing 30 of 50 states and more counties than any Republican nominee since Reagan (2623 to 489), the better. She is so Machiavellian and egotistical, she can't see her faults.
@jimsciutto So the fact that she can't remember all the details and doesn't want the bright lights and tough questions not a part of the equation? She wanted to be front and center...the door is open. Everyone is waiting.
@SenSchumer Are you calling for an FBI investigation of Keith Ellison?
@foxandfriends The current IP/SP narrow directive is Trump collusion with the Russians. Monica was screaming to see Bill at the White House gates as a result of an affair while he was president. Mueller's team is squeezing Trump associates and trying to find crimes from 10-15 years ago.
@thehill This is journalistically disingenuous. There have not been "allegations." There is one hazy, half remembered, 36 year old one time accusation by a proven Democrat partisan. It is fake news to try to blow up this one allegation into more than it is.
@CNNSitRoom Innocent Until Proven Guilty. The speculation and innuendo is nauseating. The left is grasping at that one tiny straw. Let the women speak but those who assume that a hazy, half remembered 36 year high school accusation is disqualifying, the entire Congress should probably resign

@thehill I am waiting on the call from @SenSchumer and @NancyPelosi for Keith Ellison to drop out of Congress, end his campaign for Minnesota Attorney General and to relinquish his DNC position. We're waiting...this didn't happen 36 years ago. Do you both endorse this with your silence?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Abe Lincoln faced the same crap. Elitist officials all around him called him dim witted, classless, stupid and awkward. Politicians all over D.C. plotted to get him removed. Lincoln kept working for the people, winning a 2nd term. Remembered as one of our Greatest Presidents.

@BoSnerdley Anybody can accuse anybody of anything...even if they claim it happened 35 years ago and never told anybody.
@thehill Democrats playbook per the Kavanaugh Hearings. 1. inject race in anyway possible. 2. try to show your "Resistance" chops in anyway possible (i.e. leaks, severe condescension). 3. bring up sexual harrassment (#metoo). 4. Look for Latino angle. Stir the pot for the mid-terms!

Now Mueller is investigating all who ever knew Trump to uncover anything that will justify the excuse for losing that @HillaryClinton gave at the end of "Shattered."
@thehill So anyone who shook your hand 30-40 years ago has the right to publicly accuse you of anything? Was this accusation brought up at any time during Judge Kavanaugh's distinguished legal career? To Harvard where he taught? I can't remember half my high school class 30 years ago.
@WashTimes A nearly 40 year story that she didn't feel was serious enough until the 11th hour of a Supreme Court judicial decision? Music to the Democrat's ears? Details are sketchy, even from her 2012 therapy sessions. I have compassion for what she thinks she believes. Vote Thursday.
@chucktodd @FEMA_Brock Why is NBC and Chuck Todd preoccupied with a year old storm in Puerto Rico in the middle of a natural disaster occuring right now on the East Coast? Trying to score political points in the middle of massive United States flooding?
@jonathanvswan The Democrats must have an illusionist candidate who can successfully obfuscate our historic economy where small business is thriving. He/She must say "but, you aren't getting enough free stuff" to those uneducated, who won't work or the immigrants who are in low wage jobs.
@cspanradio @SteveScully @joe_allbaugh Steve, can @cspan get Rev. @JasperWilliams3 on Washington Journal? He gave a rousing contrarian eulogy at Aretha Franklin's funeral and has sparked a discussion that many powerful interests seem to want to snuff out. I don't know if the Reverend would participate but it's needed.
@FoxNews Represents low wage immigrants who want to change our system to get more $$$/stuff. They don't understand how America works...like first learning English. Democratic Socialism is a fancy way of saying "I want to give you a lot of free stuff" without worrying where it comes from.
@DailyCaller Socialist hack. Focused only on welfare for all, disincentives to work, victimization claims. Totally subservient to a Community Organization to lower the standard of living for all Americans. Anti-business. Anti-free market. Killed the economy. 2% GDP.
@thehill When America's Horatio Alger story was front and center. All of us knew that  hard work, determination and persistence was key. Today, many are attacking that concept. Victimization. Disadvantaged Minorities. Women. Now welfare, single parent HHs, assistance, quotas. Go To Work.
@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Mike, from what platform are you trying to insert yourself into a national discussion? You are a lawyer with a checkered business background who represents a porn actress. Are you running for something? I know CNN and @MSNBC love your rap, but I don't get it. Provocateur?
@WashTimes Democrats believe they are the only ones. They thought @HillaryClinton would be nominating the next Supreme Court judges. How can Feinstein keep information quiet in her office since July and spring it at the 11th hour. Dishonest. Kavanaugh is a great jurist/man.
@thehill If there is no underlying predicate for a specific crime, is the Mueller Team authorized to interrogate all those in any way associated with @realDonaldTrump to try to find any crime? Is this his mandate?
@MariaBartiromo @DevinNunes @SundayFutures @FoxNews Fantastic! Honestly, isn't it time we look at all angles instead of the "Let's Bring Down the @realDonaldTrump Presidency" angle? I'm tired of almost every news outlet droning on in a coordinated attempt to bring Trump down.
@larryelder @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Amazing how what was once a mainstream thought is now radical. The attacks on Rev. Jasper Williams at Aretha Franklin's funeral were deafening. But, just a few years ago, Obama was saying the same thing. Our country has truly moved dramatically left.
@DailyCaller We all know how "Resisters" will vote. They would increase taxes, take away 2nd Amend and put all their focus on equalizing our society. This group hates the fact that minorities and women are making huge economic gains under @realDonaldTrump They are "Hate Trump All the Time."
@DailyCaller So did Kenneth Starr investigate every person close to Bill Clinton...look at their finances, confiscate their files? Lean on every women Bill had a relationship with to try to find some dirt to "squeeze" them on. Threaten all with jail? Just to uncover something? Anything?
@FoxBusiness @charliekirk11 America is inherently achievement based. You can't equalize effort, drive and persistence. We are all Free to Choose. Some kids laugh at their free schooling, etc. while others, incl third world immigrants, embrace opportunities. Those who focus and work hard will always achieve.
@CNNPolitics CNN, The View, WAPO, NYT...if there was any balance whatsoever, the America voter might put stock in what any of them say. But, it's 100% "We Hate Trump" all the time. Meanwhile, working men and women, including minorities, have more economic hope than they have had in a decade.

@AnnCoulter @TuckerCarlson Well over 100 people - many recruited/paid by special interest groups -  publicly disrupted the Judiciary Committee's Kavanaugh hearing. Can you  tell us any reason why we shouldn't be provided the names/residences of  each person arrested? We want to know.
@SenMikeLee Well over 100 people - many recruited/paid by special interest groups -  publicly disrupted the Judiciary Committee's Kavanaugh hearing. Can you  tell us any reason why we shouldn't be provided the names/residences of  each person arrested? They should not be anonymous.

@NPR Dems don't seek answers. They want to be rude (like Kamala's mocking why he couldn't remember talking about Mueller to anyone in a law firm). And, they want to find any obscure point to politicize. This is about 2020 not any "answers." Kavanaugh is beyond qualified. Dilettantes.
@krassenstein Brian, note that Alex Jones aggressively harassed and put his hands on a U.S. Senator. I think @marcorubio showed amazing Christian restraint. You must know a lot about Christianity and faith to throw your judgment around. See you in church.
@nprpolitics So "journalists" can start aggressively putting their hands on Members of Congress in the Capitol. who knew?
@TwitterMoments Fake News. Alex Jones aggressively harassed Rubio and then put his hands on a Member of Congress. He needs to have his credentials suspended immediately. He is not a journalist. He was looking to harass Sen. @marcorubio Wonder who edited/wrote this story....fake news.

@JordanUhl So who is Alex Jones and why is he allowed in the Capitol to harrass Members of Congress? He needs to be stripped of his resistance credentials and sent back to Louisiana. He is an idiot.
@USAttyBash Mr. Bash, you have to understand the liberals heads are exploding! America is doing great and they have nothing to run on. They are worried that society will realize that conservative principles work! The resisters - especially in the media - are grasping at anything they can.
@DailyCaller Judge Kavanaugh had been screamed at by liberal activists all day during what should have been a civil proceeding. And, he was attacked by the Resist Crowd on Judiciary. Do you blame him for not engaging with an aggressive stranger brought by D. Feinstein? Crazy LIBERAL SLANTED.

Ever get the impression that the liberals want to portray 2018 like the 60's? I keep hearing comparisons to the civil rights marches. Crazy? There has never been a better time anywhere on the planet for legal minorities in America. Free school. Companies are fighting to hire!
Liberals have Hollywood, Most Media, Professors, Unions, Gov. Employees. Conservatives have families, small business, church-goers, two parent households, hope, faith and the will and energy to do it yourself. Libs believe Gov is the answer. Sad, sad, sad.
The resistance is getting old. There is a big, wonderful America who is excited that ISIS is gone, the economy is roaring, and new China &amp; Mexico trade deals are coming. Family businesses means something. Trump's policies are helping minorities get ahead. Lib heads are exploding!
Seems like CNN, MSNBC, WAPO, NYT, NPR all interpret news through a liberal filter. Nothing on the right is good. The slant is obvious. So Kavanaugh didn't shake a stranger's hand after dozens screamed at him all day? Would you be on edge to have a guy agressively approach you?

@USATODAY But, this so-called comedian was sponsored by the "unbiased, even-handed, nonpolitical, fair and balanced" White House journalists. The same folks who kissed Carney, Gibbs and Earnests collective rear ends (as well as the Obama's). Fake News Journalists.
@HillaryClinton @OnwardTogether If I come, will you sign my book, "Shattered?" Great story of a narcissistic, self-absorbed, purposeless presidential campaign?
Washington, DC thrives on lobbyists and gov spending. That's why the town is so Democratic. Incestuously, editors for years have hired "mind meld" doublethink reporters. Over time, DC became radically liberal. The town hates having an entrepreneurial, decidedly un-PC president
@BretBaier You can't compare Wolf's comedy to being offended by Pres. Trump. Pres. Trump is the politician. Wolf's routine was sponsored by supposed "fair, even-handed, balanced, unbiased" White House journalists. Her routine shows how inherently biased the Washington press corp truly is.
As long as the comedy fits their resistance agenda, they love it. As long as they have Hollywood, SNL, university professors and MSM (including WHCs) behind them, they love the humor. The rest of the country sees total liberal bias. it was embarrassing. https://t.co/zfssZDnkI1
@hughhewitt @washingtonpost Total embarrassment for the national WH press corp. Just showed their stripes. Since Watergate, editors have hired journos that parrot their liberal mantras. An entrepreneurial businessman is a martian to them. The entrenched liberal DC swamp will never accept his presidency.
Squarely on point. @CapehartJ makes a false equivalency: Wolf was sponsored by the "even-handed, fair, non-biased" news media. You know, the same one that fawned over Obama and constantly kissed Carney, Earnest and Gibbs collective rear ends. https://t.co/gnheso9f2b

@LindseyGrahamSC 800K are the ones who registered. They have kids. It's estimated that at least double this amount didn't register but will come forward once they are granted citizenship. CBO cost estimates for benefits for the original 800K is about 40 billion. It will be much higher. $$$$$$$$$

@ABC Giving citizenship to 800,000 DACA recipients (and untold children) will cost taxpayers an est. $30 billion. Why are we so much more worried about DACA recipients than legal "Homegrown American" kids who are struggling. Can we give them the $30 billion? #allaboutbuyingthevotes

The main Russia collusion I have seen runs from HRC/DNC through Mark E. Elias, a DC atty, to Glenn Simpson/Fusion GPS to C. Steele to the Russian government. Millions were spent to work with the Russian government to implicate DJT on anything.
I heard Donald Trump had lots of emails on a private server that probably proved Russia collusion. He deleted tens of thousands of emails and bleach-bit and smashed his team's mobile phones and computers. Would this be OK? It was for HRC.
Left wing legislators and MSM commentators continue to insist Russia helped Trump in the election. What I saw was Wiki exposing emails that showed Dem back-biting, collusion, lying and cheating. See how quickly they swept Donna B. under the rug?
