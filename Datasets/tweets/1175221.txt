This was a challenge while I was at @SunFoundation. When a POTUS is an amoral fabulist who abuses his powers, debases his office, degrades public discourse, &amp; erodes democracy, reporting that he’s done so (much less opposing it) angers partisans, who tell that’s not nonpartisan.
It is not partisan to report @realDonaldTrump lies.	It IS partisan to claim that he doesn’t.	Or that he isn’t corrupt, or dismiss a history of racism, misogyny, or fraud.

@JasonLeopold Thank YOU, Jason. Keep going.
@KHShan @PressSec @POTUS @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr Your fear is correct.	It's going to be incredibly difficult, but there is a way forward: build up fortresses of  information, inside &amp; outside of government, that the public can trust. @m_older's science fiction is one vision of how this works out. There are other timelines.
@JasonLeopold Thank you for your continued public service. I never get tired of these FOIA tweets, though they always make me angry.
@PressSec @POTUS @FoxNews None of this is new, but it bears repeating: @realDonaldTrump has undermined US government policy worldwide, from #anticorruption (cf. nepotism, lack of divestment &amp; disclosure) to development to disinformation to democracy itself. @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr are both complicit.
It's almost like the @PressSec has no credibility to advocate for #pressfreedom &amp; foreign government believe they can treat the press with impunity when the @POTUS calls journalists the "enemy of the people." Perhaps @FoxNews could cover illiberalism more? https://t.co/WO9by525dV https://t.co/bkUTb41g4o

I’ll believe the @ombpress is serious about any of these weak commitments when the @presssec @WHOSTP actually shares the plan &amp; takes questions about it &amp; @opengovpart on the record from the press. That’s way below the standard we should expect from any @whitehouse, but it’s 2019
@jbordeaux Sure. Feel to reach out https://t.co/5ryhuhsAeY
It’s ludicrous that the @whitehouse has “committed” to …doing what Congress just passed a law mandating it do. 	Committing to honor existing sunshine laws, from FACA to FOIA, would have been welcome. 	Or for this @potus to stop calling journalists enemies of the people.	But no.
@jbordeaux I advocated for the bill for 3+ years, defending against efforts to weaken it, &amp; have pushed for every level of government to be better stewards of public data. It’s fair to say I am a strong supporter of CDOs. https://t.co/gmfFqfZFLv Committing to do what the law requires is BS.
I’m not surprised, but it’s still disappointing to see the US government do this, even after 2 years of ugliness. https://t.co/mICvF1swYi when @usgsa invited tech trade groups instead of good government watchdogs in 2017  &amp; @whitehouse defended #opengov regression https://t.co/smqszYaopr
The year is still young, but the US government’s fourth national action plan for #opengov exemplifies openwashing, committing to existing digital government &amp; management policies instead of #anticorruption, ethics or sunshine law reforms. https://t.co/kDu7Bcf1ap https://t.co/p0qPtNJ8xz
There was 0% chance OGP would lead to this @POTUS releasing his tax returns.	But @WhiteHouse could have restarted releasing visitor logs.	Or a beneficial ownership registry.	Or @FOIApost R21R2A FOIA policy.	Or open PACER.	But @OMBPress never even shared https://t.co/GPTQEzN6c2.
But at a deeper level, US advocates were unable to use @opengovpart as platform to get the @whitehouse to commit to any meaningful #OpenGov reforms that are responsive to the serious corruption or transparency problems that persist in the USA, eroding already low public trust.
This is probably good news for @opengovpart: it won’t have to make the USA inactive. The steering committee may well criticize a flawed consultation &amp; weak, unambitious  #opengov plan, but the @whitehouse endures worse on a daily basis from watchdogs, Congress &amp; editorial boards.
After going silent for 6 months https://t.co/mICvF1swYi &amp; failing to engage the public: https://t.co/GPTQEzN6c2 the @whitehouse @OMBPress has released a new national #opengov plan that repackaged existing #opendata programs &amp; commits to doing what Congress mandated.
“…if the @WhiteHouse submits a plan, look for it to position existing digital government initiatives &amp; emerging technology programs – like those outlined in the Presidential Management Agenda – in a handful of commitments in a new #opengov plan.” https://t.co/IxiJ7rd2Bi	Today: https://t.co/TVrz3fmL2h
@Integrilicious @SunFoundation @danielschuman @POGOBlog @NormEisen @OpenTheGov I can’t identify a single commitment advocates asked for in this.	There’s no big commitment.	0 on FOIA.	The one on CDOs is literally what Congress just mandated.	Data strategy was already in the works.	And the irony of the final one won’t be lost on any workshop participants.

@realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @POTUS Perhaps @NYTimes reporters are not be shocked, but brazen corruption &amp; the abuse of public power by any @POTUS should not normalized by the paper of record. If the Times still had a public editor, I'd flag this line. (It's not much good to tag @DeanBaquet, either, I'm afraid.)
"@RealDonaldTrump’s public war on the inquiry has gone on long enough that it is no longer shocking."	False.

@brianstelter @IlhanMN And I agree that journalism means adding context &amp; verification, not just accepting a written, spoken or tweet statement.

@brianstelter @IlhanMN It's true to say politicians from every party have learned to "go direct" to the public online, as their predecessors did using radio &amp; TV.

@waltshaub @RepKatieHill @SAmeyJD That's it for this hearing. Thanks for listening, as always. It's been a while since I've tweeted like this from Congress, but this set of issues is particularly important to me.
@waltshaub Does transparency help restore public trust in our democracy? asks @repkatiehill 	Yes, says @SAmeyJD.	@WaltShaub: It's most important tool we have to ensure that elected leaders act on our behalf		Cf. https://t.co/N0LXIdd127	#OpenGov #HR1
The only conflict of interest guidance that the drafters of the Constitution gave us were the emolument clauses, say @WaltShaub. (Just so.)		The challenge they may not have anticipated is Congress not acting when a POTUS violated those anti-corruption clause.
To review: @Jim_Jordan has spent more time being upset about the decision of @OfficeGovEthics to use Twitter to implore @realDonaldTrump to disclose &amp; divest than this @POTUS taking emoluments from corporations &amp; foreign states, in violation of the Constitution #HR1
Now @Jim_Jordan is asking @WaltShaub about 2016 OGE tweets encouraging Trump to disclose &amp; divest.	I'm having deja vu. 	January 2017: "House Oversight should be doing oversight of corruption, not threaten @OfficeGovEthics."	https://t.co/SQmWAYgiZM

After referencing LMGTFY for parties that use superPACs, @chiproytx compares disclosure to "doxxing" voters, referencing the (now suspended) @EveryTrumpDonor account https://t.co/3kpWGGicrK In response, witness claims that such disclosure chills voter participation. #HR1
Now @AOC:. She's asking the witnesses about what's legal under the law today for a "bad guy," with respect to conflicts of interest or holding equity in a company while he or she advances legislation. 	"We have a system that's fundamentally broken" #HR1 	https://t.co/OuQ3MFWcY5
In an oversight hearing notable for a growing number of empty seats, particularly after members ask their questions, I’ve watched @RepPressley @RepAOC @RepRashida stay, listen &amp; take notes the entire time. #hr1 https://t.co/fmPNUp76dZ
To review: @RepClayHiggins said additional disclosures required in #HR would chill speech, after citing his research into campaign donations to Members of Congress as evidence for who it would benefit. And then walked out of the oversight hearing.
"This bill resembles Russian government policy," says @repclayhiggins, who then claims #HR1 abridges the freedom of speech. 	He then referenced donations to Democratic Members from trial lawyers, using the disclosures his colleagues decry as chilling of "speech" to inform debate.

The exemption for a @POTUS &amp; @VIP in the Ethics in Government Act https://t.co/Oxrlm8ZTbX wasn't to provide an incentive, but because a president can't recuse, says @waltshaub, which is why divestiture has been the practice – until now. #HR1

@Murdokahn @RepMarkMeadows @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @Trump @POTUS @TurkishAirlines @Jim_Jordan Correct. But he should be: https://t.co/UHMh1yNoXU Every @POTUS should.	Second, he's receiving emoluments in violation of the Constitution.
@RepCummings It has been made clear that it has been made difficult for people like me to vote, says @RepCummings, citing federal court decision on partisan gerrymandering: https://t.co/sgeTva5aH8 	(my previous tweet has the wrong link, to a Virginia decision).
Now, @RepCummings is noting a federal court that noted restrictions on the voting rights of African-Americans in South Carolina https://t.co/XWv7yZw2hV	Cummings says his mother's last words were	"Do not let them take out votes away from us."	He's absolutely furious. Raised voice.
@RepMarkMeadows @waltshaub @POTUS By the logic that @Jim_Jordan's just advanced, as the @FTC &amp; @FCC have a chairman &amp; 4 commissions, they are "partisan." Reforming the @FEC to not be dysfunctional in a similar fashion, would stop it from being "bipartisan."
@Murdokahn @RepMarkMeadows @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @Trump @POTUS @TurkishAirlines @Jim_Jordan You don't know what's happened to this @POTUS' finances, &amp; neither does the public, because he has not disclosed his taxes. Regardless, even should your assertion be accurate, that't mean he is not engaging in corruption under the Constitution.
Challenged by @RepMarkMeadows, @WaltShaub says he never imagined a @POTUS would refuse to eliminate his conflicts of interest, have appointees uninterested in government ethics, or, with all due respect, a Congress that would refuse to exercise its oversight responsibilities	#HR1
@Murdokahn @RepMarkMeadows @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @Trump @POTUS @TurkishAirlines @Jim_Jordan 1400+ reasons https://t.co/BAaXL1ZMqh
@RepMarkMeadows @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @Trump @POTUS @TurkishAirlines So far, this hearing is a reminder that:	1) oversight of ethics &amp; corruption is not "presidential harassment" 	2) GOP keeps arguing disclosure "chills speech"	3) @RepMarkMeadows &amp; @jim_jordan remain unconcerned about @POTUS violating Constitution's anti-corruption clause clause
After @RepMarkMeadows asks @WaltShaub to clarify, he says he didn't mean people  hand cash to @realDonaldTrump, but rather Trump receives $ when people, parties or corporations patronize @Trump, as @POTUS did not divest. 	Or nations. Cf @TurkishAirlines: https://t.co/iE0iAo10pg
@waltshaub @OfficeGovEthics @POTUS @Trump @realDonaldTrump @RashidaTlaib We have a situation where people who seek to influence the POTUS can do so with cash his various properties – &amp; unfortunately the @POTUS has done nothing to mitigate this. Instead, Trump embraces &amp; encourages. 	Cf. @TMobile execs staying at @TrumpDC: https://t.co/xaBWGquDMY
@waltshaub @OfficeGovEthics After listing how special interests &amp; political parties have ought to influence US government &amp; @POTUS using @Trump businesses, after @realDonaldTrump didn't divest, @RashidaTlaib says 	"I cannot believe this is not illegal already," &amp; says her constituents view this as a payout
#HR1 would increase transparency of waivers, which inform the public, says @WaltShaub. Unsigned, undated waivers undermine the integrity of government. "We need ethics reform before the public's trust in government is shattered beyond repair," says former @OfficeGovEthics head
@gilgrim @SykesCharlie The answer to your question was literally in the tweet: the @KnightFdn commission on democracy. Teaching history is exactly what the commissioners recommended. I'd encourage you to insult people less &amp; read more carefully before you respond. Thanks.
@KHobertFlynn @CommonCause @RudyMehrbani @realDonaldTrump When presidents &amp; agency heads do lead, violations of various ethics laws follow, says @RudyMehrbani, along with 	waste of taxpayer resources &amp; lowered public trust in government. He notes 1/3 of voters ranked corruption as their most important issue. #H1
Polls show the public wants bold ethics &amp; transparency reforms, giving them more voice in our democracy, says @KHobertFlynn: @CommonCause supports #HR1. 	@rudymehrbani highlights the relevance of ethics reform, given the secrecy &amp; corruption of @realDonaldTrump's administration.
@SandersNowell @facebook Yelling at strangers online is a poor use of expression, but suit yourself.
The @POGOBlog's @SAmeyJD is now testifying. House Oversight doesn't have testimony up, but POGO posted a statement: https://t.co/z2zrfs0YQJ As he notes, #HR1 is supported by nonpartisan watchdogs &amp; #opengov advocates. 	Watch: https://t.co/OuQ3MFWcY5
I haven't heard this argument from a Member  before, but @congressmanhice just claimed that forcing states to automatically register people to vote will "open the floodgates"  for illegal aliens to vote. This is a farcical claim, supported by no evidence from states that do this.
Jordan is quite exercised at the idea that the names of people who donated money  to nonprofits should be public. He says that supposed to be private &amp; references so-called "dark money."		AKA, where powerful interests hide influence using nonprofits: https://t.co/1N0F9un682 #HR1
@WhiteHouse Echoing @SenateMajLder, @Jim_Jordan claims #HR1 would 	"tilt the playing field" in the favor of Democrats, drawing laughs.	"you laugh, but it's true." He says disclosure would enable people to "exact political retribution" &amp; is an attempt to stifle expression of political beliefs

@ibarguen OK. There is a cohort in American society that has now embraced a variety of nationalism that is actively hostile to journalists, led by a presidency that has stoked animus.  To my Q: should news outlets really seek to represent that thinking inside of newsrooms? #KnightComm

@andrewhaeg Listening is inherently not about getting anything out there, but a way of showing respect, being open to feedback about a story, and seeking ways to improve it
@SykesCharlie One answer to this challenge is transparency, suggests @SykesCharlie. It will help, BUT: I'd argue that conservatives need to find a way to constructively critique bias while still defending freedom of the press &amp; its role in American democracy https://t.co/jOgb8W8SEf	#KnightComm
@andrewhaeg I'd argue that tweeting, done right, includes more listening than broadcasting.
Innovation practices around transparency in journalism haven't evolved, asserts @MeredithA, who notes outlets that removed comments ceded conversation to "someone else's house" on social media. I'd disagree on the former ( https://t.co/TiMmBBCEdp) but agree on latter.	#KnightComm

Gerstein is one of the best reporters on transparency beat, as shown by his coverage the @ObamaWhiteHouse. The point he makes here is worth amplifying: this @WhiteHouse could be more open, but that require disclosing evidence of their claims https://t.co/tNb2wGlUij
@saundra_barlow @WhiteHouse @ObamaWhiteHouse This has nothing to do with the SOTU and everything to do with how this White House is open to the public. It’s not disclosing visitor logs. The last one published over 6,000,000.

@howard_beale77 @POTUS I've been on Twitter since March 2007.	I've found lots of threats to model over that time, but people angry because I shared facts they didn't like isn't one of them I concern myself much over. https://t.co/ESegJsBRw2

@ianbremmer The original Facebook was created by scraping student photos from university servers without notice of consent &amp; posting them online, after deceiving original business partners regarding ongoing development of the platform on their behalf. That's a lot of things, but innocent?
@ThomasWelch15 @WhiteHouse "The media" generally isn't a useful frame, because there's so much heterogeneity across radio, TV, print, cable, &amp; Internet outlets. Some journalists (&amp; advocates) are incredibly helpful. Others are actively corrosive.
"The lessons are clear: If an administration commits crimes without being held accountable, the next commander in chief feels emboldened to keep skirting the rules and violating the public trust."		Restoring public trust means holding every @POTUS to account for corruption. https://t.co/HIf09ukOCM
@ThomasWelch15 @WhiteHouse Indeed. In the piece I linked in this thread, I interview @Thomas_Drake1 about whistleblowing &amp; retaliation. Congress can &amp; should do better. Thank you for highlighting the role of the MSPB.

Roles of free press?

@BerinSzoka The long term solution remains Congress addressing this and making it clear that NN rules apply to ISPs, not a a service that works on top of the access they provide, like ISPs.

The world that exists today is the result of people in power &amp; industry focusing on growth over other priorities. The gap is broadened, &amp; history shows this level of inequality leads to dark ages.
Progress: @Facebook has "rolled out the ability for fact-checkers to review photos and videos in addition to article links, because we know multimedia-based misinformation is making up a greater share of false news." https://t.co/9eZsdcnnvz

@Mickleby Thanks.	You tweeted "NO ONE" at a person who tweeted a story &amp; asked Congress to act on it. That's not an invitation to discuss, nor is suggesting that it was virtue signaling. Best of luck with the rest of your day.

It's not enough to just point out that Trump is lying. (We know.)
This the first time I've seen a Congressional committee account ever directly correct a @POTUS on Twitter, but I may have missed others over the past decade when Obama was in office. @RepJoeWilson will live in infamy for yelling "you lie" to  @POTUS44 in person during an address. https://t.co/A1gQObRccY

@TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy You do you.
The "truth" is @realDonaldTrump has lied to the public daily, including about his campaign's contacts with Russia &amp; his business interests, obstructed justice, abused his powers for private gain, &amp; broken his oath of office.	In this limp tweet, he just displays  more ignorance. https://t.co/9Le0w6XPxL
@sshotbot @TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @Twitter @Policy No.		But now we both know you are willing to make a baseless accusation to try to slander a critic, building upon targeting him with a tool you made after he highlighted that it broke a Twitter's Terms of Service.
@sshotbot @TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @Twitter @Policy That is a good example of why preserving tweets of non-politicians can have public interest value, which I acknowledged in my thread. 		What money do you think I made "exposing "his" deletes?
@TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy I said nothing about accountability or your argument. I'm focused on consumer rights under the Rules to retract tweets, a service that has taken that away, &amp; what exceptions should exist &amp; for whom.
@TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy I would not "feel" it was a violation: it would be illegal under HIPAA.	If you instantly deleted the tweet, you would still have broken the law but the resulting harms would be reduced if no one amplified or copied.
@TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy No: like they shared a photo of a survivor of spousal abuse. Or a witness in a murder investigation. Or sensitive personal information from medical records. Or a journalist retracting a bad error misidentifying someone or some entity.	Don't trivialize this as being about "typos."
@TimGrey1337 @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy I want to be able to delete my tweets.	I want other people to be able to delete their tweets.	There are real consequences for people if they cannot do so. 	So I'm using the platform I have to advocate for a consumer right for those who do not have the same access or influence.
@sshotbot @JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @Twitter @Policy Thank you. 		Please give everyone else you have added without asking that same opportunity.
@exactlyAllan https://t.co/GLvSt3sJX5, when it goes back up
@sshotbot @JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @Twitter @Policy . @ajtosh shouldn't be able to decide he can unilaterally take away the ability of others to delete their tweets. Do it right, by changing @Policy, or don't do it. Adding me because I highlighted you breaking the Rules was obnoxious.
@sshotbot @JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @Twitter @Policy No, but I do have both specialized knowledge and experience with this issue. 		Please remove me.
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy OK.( I mean, you've made that obvious, but worth noting.)	Option 3: Twitter &amp; I agree, but doing something about it is really hard, technically, and risks alienating an incredibly important group of users (journalists) that it cannot afford to lose.
While some government officials &amp; the accounting industry might feel rosy about the "state of #opendata:  https://t.co/imMgSGT2gK … nation cannot be a leader in #OpenGovData unless it is also a leader in #opengov, from #pressfreedom to FOIA. https://t.co/ltZUa6DQKO
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy That's your claim.	I'm curious: do you understand that I was the deputy director of the nonprofit that operated a service that @Twitter shut down for preserving deleted tweets, contrary to its @policy?	Or have talked with their staff for a decade about Rules, including this?
@facebook @WhatsApp @messenger This is an interesting answer to my open question, from @SarahJamieLewis:  https://t.co/jQD0jNx6h0
The @NYTimes found that during the 2016 presidential campaign &amp; transition, @realDonaldTrump &amp; at least 17 campaign officials &amp; advisers had contacts with Russian nationals &amp; @WikiLeaks or their intermediaries: 	https://t.co/r8pQ6HFCU6 https://t.co/0JZCS5w6jP
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy Taking a screenshot of a deleted tweet &amp; tweeting it is preserving a deletion against the user's intention, which is against @Twitter's rules.
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @DavidPCourtney @sshotbot @Twitter Because my main point here is that while Twitter's @policy is clear, its enforcement is ambiguous around this issue, &amp; it should not be. So I wanted to check in about whether you understand that, or are (unintentionally) trolling me.

@pilhofer @saila Not exactly, but as the "McCain building" saga showed, people can &amp; do add elements &amp; change annotations. https://t.co/64lHmUmalw That one was brutal: tech illiterate media hammered Google for making the change.
@pilhofer Looks highly restricted, though perhaps a tour is possible: https://t.co/oLcpiyVj1U
@pilhofer @saila I have bad news.
@pilhofer I bet this is going to end in someone going there. 		I have learned that Petty Island was once owned by Venezuela, until Chavez donated it to New Jersey, &amp; was once "a hotbed for gambling and dueling in the 18th and 19th centuries." https://t.co/swIIHKuwWu
@jedmiller @realDonaldTrump This one has more context for his beheavior. https://t.co/XX0i69VsnQ
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy No. Here's the page on deleting tweets: https://t.co/0bgcrTGyHS
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @DavidPCourtney @sshotbot Is it your position that no one should be able to actually delete tweets, regardless of what @Twitter's Rules are?
@AOC @ProPublica @frontlinepbs @TYTPolitics @brigidbergin @WNYC Agreed! I grew up on @WHYY &amp; Maine public radio, then grew to love @WBUR:  https://t.co/6AOyfGQ4Ga @wamu885 is fantastic, whenever you're in DC. I hope you'll talk with @jejohnson322 on @1A.
I assume @Twitter will tolerate a journalist archiving @jairbolsonaro's deleted tweets, because of the precedent for a public interest exception: https://t.co/x6QldPCjFJ but @policy should be clear to @ICFJ that it's doing so, &amp; why.
@jalbertbowdenii It's an coordinated hate campaign that brewed in online cesspools, not a continuation of a tired debate from the past decade.
"Imagine how nerve-racking – terrifying, even – tweeting would be if it was immutable and irrevocable? No one user is more deserving of that ability than another. Indeed, deleting a tweet is an expression of the user’s voice."– @Twitter, in 2015		Still true, @Jack @ColinCrowell?
@mark_earnest @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy But it's not. That's a cliche, not reality. Bitrot, linkrot, &amp; services going under without preserving content are part of online life. Go try to find archived videos of my livestreams on Livestream or uStream.
@JohnBrownlow @ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy ? @Twitter *has* already banned this under its rules, as I highlighted. But it doesn't enforce the rules, in part because of the difficulty of enforcement.	It shouldn't grant a blanket tacit exemption. @policy should clarify if it's OK, when preservation serves a public interest.
@Trump_FactCheck @Twitter @politwoops @Policy @jack @SunFoundation It cannot. 	But it can &amp; should suspend services that post screenshots of deletions &amp; the people who operate them, if it doesn't grant public interest exceptions for archiving them against the intentions of those consumers.
@ajtosh @sshotbot @Twitter @Policy So far, @TwitterSupport @TwitterSafety @policy have said &amp; done nothing.	If @Jack &amp; @vijaya want to change the @Rules, they can. But if @Twitter allows automated services to break its ToS without granting a public interest exception, what conclusion should we draw, @ColinCrowell?
I challenged @ajtosh about @sshotbot preserving deleted tweets against the wish of consumers, broking @Twitter @policy: https://t.co/3hr0fKEr4L He retaliated by adding me to it, so now I can't delete tweets without a record. (He deleted his own tweets) I reported the bot &amp; owner.
@Twitter @politwoops @Policy @jack @SunFoundation 3 years later, @Twitter continues to allow journalists, media organizations to screenshot &amp; tweet deleted tweets by many accounts, from politicians to corporations to CEOs, along with various activists &amp; advocates. It's a tacit public interest exception, but not official @Policy.
@Twitter @politwoops @Policy @jack @SunFoundation When @Twitter restored access to @Politwoops in December 2015, it wasn't particularly transparent about it (neither was @SunFoundation, ironically) but it was clear that they'd made a public interest @policy exception for the public speech of politicians. https://t.co/PDMkBzKPBT
@Twitter @politwoops Politwoops came back to life because @Twitter granedt a public interest exception to its @policy, which says we are allowed to delete our own tweets:  https://t.co/0bgcrTGyHS Thank you, @Jack. (I saw this agreement when I was at @SunFoundation, which used to run @Politwoops.)
It's in the public interest for @Twitter to allow @Politwoops preserve deleted tweets of politicians:  https://t.co/Hlf87PKFjQ	Companies should preserve ephemeral updates by politicians &amp; government officials, too: https://t.co/2dpKjYn6dU	Archiving should be done by governments.
@DefendAssange @wikileaks Assange called my question "rubbish" in 2015, and made the same defense. You're consistent in your talking points, as well as not being transparent in their authorship.
@dellcam @ScottShaneNYT @DDoSecrets But are they people familiar with the matter, or just someone “close to the president?”
@SandersNowell @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Given that experience, what do you think of a POTUS using a propaganda tactic that is historically associated with the USSR &amp; now post-Soviet Russia to respond to criticism of his record? (You are now doing the same thing with Obama, by the way.)
@NatSecGeek @ScottShaneNYT @DDoSecrets Thank you for listening &amp; replying. That was my understanding, but I’m glad that you further confirmed your view.
When I asked Julian Assange why @Wikileaks doesn’t pursue &amp; disclose Russian secrets in 2015, he angrily said I was parochial, that the West spends the most $$ on surveillance, &amp; that WL did host documents. 	https://t.co/WvpCfGGfrd	He kept focusing on USA: https://t.co/Uu4VSkjuEv https://t.co/5G9gPT0EtC
When @ScottShaneNYT writes this release is “widely viewed” as a “counter strike” to Russian actions in 2016, he didn’t quote anyone. He put @DDoSecrets on the same level as a state actor. It’s unvalidated by #opengov advocates. What isn’t he reporting? https://t.co/T5Lpjp9qJs
Neither @PressSec, @Whitehouse OMB Director @RussVought45 or @ombpress have ever made any comment on US participation in @OpenGovPart. Ditto @SecPompeo or @POTUS. https://t.co/ltZUa6DQKO Now that the #GovernmentShutdown has ended, perhaps they will explain their plan to #opengov? https://t.co/gTnmPrYLxy

@SandersNowell @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your service, then.	Respectfully, then, I don’t agree that you are honoring your oath by making this accusation, particularly in response to what this POTUS is doing. What do you make of him using a Soviet tactic?
@SandersNowell @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are you making baseless claims about me &amp; Soros because you are a/n:	🔘conspiracy theorist	🔘persona operated by Russia’s IRA	🔘”useful idiot”	🔘automated entity	🔘anti-Semite	🔘depressed lonely person who tweets absurd things at strangers

@dgwbirch @facebook @WhatsApp @messenger Interesting. Idea.
At the end of defiant remarks that obscure no new funding for his wall, @RealDonaldTrump says that either Congress will solve this (presumably, more funding for his wall) by 2/15 or he will use the powers given to the @POTUS "to address this emergency." 	#GovernmentShutdown for 0
My wife and 5 year old daughter came over to listen to the @POTUS speak about the shutdown. I just muted him after he went off on lengthy, lurid, descriptive diatribe about women being kidnapped, bound &amp; taken over the border. This isn't new rhetoric. https://t.co/TlrQTM9w94
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec @PaulManafort @MichaelCohen212 The @POTUS says:	•he agreed to a deal to end  #GovernentShutdown, funding the government for 3 weeks, until 2/15	•Civil servants will receive back pay as "soon as possible"	•Asked @SenateMajLdr to put on the floor ASAP	•bipartisan group to discuss border security provisions

Starting with media organizations &amp; journalists makes sense to me, but integrating both more signals &amp; ways to provide feedback than just Follow, RT or Like seem critical to me to achieve the "healthy conversations" @Twitter says it wants: https://t.co/UWKfMhljtf
Who or what do you trust the most on @Twitter?	Wire news, like @AP or @Reuters?	A newspaper, like @WSJ?	A news network, like @ABC?	A company, like @Google?	US government, like @FEMA, @TheJusticeDept or @FBI?	A journalist, like @carlbernstein?	Celebrities? https://t.co/jDLrVEYpQd
@Dan_Rowinski @Twitter @verified @NewsGuardRating @RottenTomatoes Jinx! Buy me a Coke: https://t.co/B3db2hbR9T But seriously: yes. Which is why there also would need to be an expert rating based on an open rubric, too. Could be an annual census. Could also be from professional peers, like LinkedIns endorsement. Weight highly trusted folks more.
There would be huge challenges of @Twitter gave us the ability to rate the veracity of other accounts or tweets, from campaigns to gaming the system (see abuse of copyright or abuse reporting) to more existential issues about humanity. 		But RTs, quotes &amp; Likes already signal it.
What if @Twitter added “veracity scores” to accounts, perhaps starting with @verified media? Could  @NewsGuardRating’s model for websites work here? Show public ratings on accuracy (flag for errors?) &amp; expert ratings based on review of standards &amp; accuracy, like @RottenTomatoes?

@brianwolly Shoot. Ugh. For some reason, I thought it was today. Retracting.
Verifying &amp; adding context before you publish is what turns an unverified report into journalism.	Figuring how to do that in the open with the public we seek to inform is hard, but I think it’s the way to earn back public trust. I wish @Twitter rewarded getting it right, not 1st.

Best practices for journalists on Twitter:	Show your work.	Share the journalism of others.	Share your email.	Answer questions.	Ask for help investigating.	Ask CEOs &amp; politicians questions.	Thank subscribers.	Find sources.	Be skeptical.	Verify before you amplify.	Embrace empathy.
One of the consequences of choosing the wealthiest, most unethical @cabinet in US history is that its members are divorced from the economic precarity of the lives of most Americans, including federal workers.

@rich1 @brianstelter @fmanjoo It probably require the vast majority of the public to stop using it &amp; state/non-state actors to stop realizing value from misinformation campaigns. It felt like a small community because it was a relatively small group of people who didn’t face automated abuse or mass trolling.
@jpappone I’m saying that these are all valid uses cases for journalists on social media, practicing journalism in the open. Showing your work &amp; investigating require both skepticism &amp; verification prior to amplification &amp; validating a report’s accuracy. https://t.co/4PI8ZmXGNJ
@DerekDoesTech What you described is being skeptical, looking for verification, confirmation, &amp; more context. Which is to say, practicing sound journalism, as I have observe you do.		Is that how you see this headline is being interpreted by other journalists or the public?

@jpappone You’ve missed the point.
The prevalence of misinformation, disinformation, abuse, &amp; trolling are a real problem. It’s exhausting for many people be a community manager for a masthead: underpaid, underappreciated, huge risks, skeptical bosses who dismissed the Internet &amp; social media until they couldn’t.

@ArchivesMaarja This is the first time I recall reading the phrase, in this context: https://t.co/G5H4HZZVNh Public, to me, means created by the public sector, vs personal or proprietary; The default is open; some public records remain classified for decades, but they still belong to the public.
@Jennywombat Oh no! I didn't realize these two forums conflicted until just now.
Over the past 10 months, @Facebook &amp; @Google collectively pledged to give $200 million annually to support journalism: 	https://t.co/fnGxJ7AMY9 That's welcome, but likely not enough. Direct subsidies from foundations to nonprofits will help. States should invest in public media.

@Seanmakesjokes @Teclarosa23 @AOC You keep comparing men to women in hypotheticals. I am providing concrete evidence of racial bias in different settings that would create data that would affect machine learning.

@Seanmakesjokes @Teclarosa23 @AOC Is it possible that you are displaying   confirmation bias towards "certain groups" that suggests the onus is on their behavior as opposed to their race? I'm not assuming anything: it's literally what this study showed.

@gurugk @WSJ @Verizonmedia_ @YahooNews @HuffPost With all due respect, that's corporate jargon. Are you laying editorial staff off, keeping headcount level, or hiring?
@Teclarosa23 @AOC i don't insist anything of the sort, nor call you evil. It's also hilariously misguided to suggest that I don't like data or observations. But you do sound like a racist, which is why I asked if you were aware.
@Teclarosa23 @AOC That false assertion is both a vast generalization and a conflation of three different political ideologies, all of which have varying views on the size of the state or its role in industry or aspect governance.
@Teclarosa23 @AOC Are you aware that your assertion that "the culture of those communities is more accepting of behaviors that can lead to interventions or crimes" could be interpreted as racist?
@Teclarosa23 @AOC Relevant example: racial bias causes black boys to be disciplined more at school. https://t.co/kCcd77vZAJ This creates data that reflects that bias, which in turn will create models that will, if trained on them.
@ianbremmer The State of the Union is #shutdown.
@Teclarosa23 @AOC No. I am irrelevant in this situation. The question is whether there are differential outcomes in a given algorithmic process due to a protected class (race, gender, etc) not whether I "agree" or not.

@hawgman22 @senatemajldr @POTUS That's right: the Constitution mandates that the *US House makes* spending decisions. Not the President or Senate. The President isn't adjusting to the realities of divided government, &amp; McConnell is enabling him, at great cost to the country.

@hawgman22 @senatemajldr @POTUS Right: He reversed course after criticism &amp; provoked the crisis.	But a @POTUS doesn’t just govern his or her base. Trump doesn’t just represent the 62,984,828 people who voted for him. That’s only 19% of the US population. A #GovernmentShutdown hurts us all. It’s indefensible.
@hawgman22 @senatemajldr @POTUS Senate passed spending bills unanimously in December, which POTUS agreed to &amp; then reversed on.	House has passed the same bills in 2019, which is a compromise.	This is no way to run a government: families are caught in the middle.	Congress should just send POTUS same bills.

When @senatemajldr says "the Senate won’t take up any spending bills the president won’t sign," he is making a choice. He could send Trump the veto-proof bill that passed, but lets an immoral #GovernmentShutdown continue that puts public safety &amp; security at risk &amp; hurts workers.
To be blunt, @SenateMajLdr's hypocrisy is brazen. His opposition to campaign finance reform &amp; failure to check Trump has weakened our democracy. His cowardice in not sending POTUS a bill is hurting hundreds of thousands of Americans working without pay in #GoverntmentShutdown.

This is part and parcel with describing Congressional oversight of the executive branch, which is manifestly corrupt under @realDonaldTrump, as "presidential harassment." Power is to be exerted in secret, without accountability, consent of the governed, or challenge by the public
At a time when political corruption is a growing concern for the electorate &amp; voter participation remains low, @SenateMajLdr ignores both &amp; doesn't proposes reforms. He claims informing the public of the source of ads is a "power grab" that leaves people vulnerable to harassment.
The @SenateMajLdr says HR1 "would broaden the type of speech the commission can define as 'campaign-related' and thus regulate," without acknowledging the opacity that exists for online political ads or why that's shadowed electioneering is a democratic vulnerability for the USA.
To @SenateMajLdr, the public disclosure of payments for electioneering, which SCOTUS upheld in McConnell vs @FEC, is an "attack" on "privacy" https://t.co/rQW5wej4IN Put it another way: he's against transparency for who pays for political ads, which is table stakes in democracy.

@zwiebeln45 @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama @POTUS You’re literally quoting something I didn’t say. (Ironically, you are yourself guilt of the very behavior you false accuse me in the made up quote.)
@stormestone @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Try evaluating the words or actions of this @potus on their own merits, instead of reflexive “whataboutism” regarding former presidents. The fact is that Trump isn’t engaging in service on #MLKDAY. Obama is irrelevant to that choice.

@mdscott @POTUS @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @tribelaw He has authority over the use military aircraft, as CiC, though I wonder how or if that may be challenged, but his ability to control the movements of Members of Congress is another matter entirely.
Trump falsely described the formerly *secret* trip by @SpeakerPelosi to a war zone a "public relations event." His supporters are calling it a "junket." The Speaker of the House is second-in-line to the presidency. Visiting troops &amp; bases is part of oversight &amp; 1st branch's role.

I'm not at all sure that it's within @realDonaldTrump's powers, however, to "postpone" @SpeakerPelosi's trip anywhere.  Perhaps @tribelaw or constitutional scholars can weigh in on that count.
The @POTUS responded to a letter tweeted by @PressSec. @realDonaldTrump claimed @SpeakerPelosi's (previously unannounced?) trip to Egypt &amp; Afghanistan "has been postponed" – &amp; says it's her prerogative to "fly commercial." Internal inconsistency. He also can't control her travel. https://t.co/UWln4nJQqj

@danielschuman @SarahSchacht @anildash @AOC @washingtonpost Nope, though maybe I should pull all 3 of these together there, when I have time.
@adjectivalnoun @danielschuman @SarahSchacht @anildash @AOC Politwoops was reinstated in 2015. ProPublica runs it in the USA; there are dozens of other versions for other countries. But it’s a patch: companies should keep a public interest file &amp; send to archives, not a single nonprofit journalism outfit.
@danielschuman @anildash @SarahSchacht @AOC They have. They stopped trying after 2018. Just tweets of note, or something along those lines.
@danielschuman @JuggerKnotty @anildash @SarahSchacht @AOC Is that true, in terms of records keeping in member offices?
@danielschuman @SarahSchacht @anildash @AOC I’ve had several discussions with different institutions now. It’s technically doable. Just need intention, demand, &amp; a public interest exception in Terms of Service, like Twitter. One obvious patch: it’s possible to save stories by default to an archive; politicians should. But
@danielschuman @anildash @SarahSchacht @AOC It’s ok! What was missing is also advocating for them to maintain archives or for government institutions to archive the records. Didn’t see around that corner, among others :)

As I argued at greater length, when a politician hosts a public forum or sends constituents public messages using a given social media platform, there should be a public archive of those records, on @snap or @Facebook or whatever’s next: https://t.co/MeUrCfNdQC https://t.co/UI2Peu3bra

Dear @AP: this isn’t a “boost to proponents of counting immigrants”	https://t.co/GyW0jFAlda The Constitution mandates “counting the whole numbers of persons in each state.” This isn’t a “both sides” or “some say” story. It was a naked, undemocratic attempt to undercount our union

Women &amp; children travel in “caravans” for safety. Refugees seeking asylum are not a national security threat.

Outside of DC, whether the snowstorm is heavier, I’ve seen heard reports that @DARPA is testing out some new winter gear. Honesty, these seem poorly designed: https://t.co/p4Aeuu0gcr Stick with snowcats &amp; hovercraft. https://t.co/ECyAuLDoel
I haven’t seen guidance from @SafeDC of @DC_HSEMA, but it looks like the #GovernmentShutdown has affected the local national guard’s fuel? This vehicle has just been sitting here for hours, collecting snow &amp; blocking plows. I wonder if it was a Wookiee mistake. https://t.co/F6kP2mEDs5
Good morning from DC! 5” of snow on Capitol Hill, with more falling. DC government is open, but the #GovernmentShutdown continues. Careful on the roads out there; I passed some federal contractors who’d had a spin out earlier. https://t.co/Vc8tsNYWFD

Tonight, when asked if he was secretly working for Russia: https://t.co/X0jNhf2I9r @realDonaldTrump said he was insulted — but never answered the question. Audio: https://t.co/1HTSd0wIPV He didn’t just say: “no.” https://t.co/uPvDdI1L5Y

The last 24 hours of news suggests that the unprecedented corruption in this White House might be the lesser threat to the union. If we are fortunate, what’s ahead will mean this presidency will be used as a rationale for ethics reforms, akin to sunshine laws after Watergate.
@dpatil If we get through all this, maybe you’ll get another shot. That’s would be good news.	The bad news is that there will be a lot to repair and revive.	Fingers crossed.
Congress should investigate payments to @Trump, &amp; act. If a @POTUS is receiving emoluments, it is appropriate to consider impeachment. https://t.co/qt6lCgcrRj That's the recourse  the Constitution provides for violation of its anti-corruption clauses. https://t.co/4Gu8z6Rd3C

Accessibility is a civil right with or without federal ADA regulations." https://t.co/pdPnIGdZmd
@facebook @SusannahFox @TheJusticeDept @AFB1921 Unfortunately, DoJ did not. (I've found no press release about it, &amp; @CivilRights hasn't tweeted since January 2017.)	As @seyfarthshawLLP pointed out, @TheJusticeDept put this rulemaking on its inactive list in July 2017: https://t.co/1vPq3LcDAK Elections matter.
@facebook @SusannahFox @TheJusticeDept What I found this morning, however, is that @TheJusticeDept quietly withdrew its rulemaking on Web accessibility on December 26, 2017, the day after Christmas. https://t.co/NJawAulpcG	@AFB1921 did not, &amp; explained to the public what it meant: https://t.co/KrqJeoJ73V
@facebook @SusannahFox My piece highlighted @TheJusticeDept's 2010 rulemaking on whether it should apply the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to websites that offer public accomodoations, thereby making many more online resources accessible to millions of our fellow Americans.
@facebook I need to come back to this today. In 2011, I wrote about a study by @SusannahFox which found that disability or illness hindered millions of Americans from using the Internet: https://t.co/SAHOc5bupR	Today, a disability divide endures: https://t.co/LXhmKF5F3q https://t.co/Pi0e8MJrdo

@jbenton Fair. I saw tabloids at the supermarket checkout line &amp; convenience stores that I saw in the 1980's in rural upstate NY &amp; Iowa, far from city newstands. To your point: a peak of ~6 million/week for Enquirer in the 1970s isn't most Americans. (Circ is much smaller now, I gather.)

This is a good question. It reminds me of what @jackshafer &amp; I talked about in February 2017: https://t.co/vn50C85SIU I don’t think there’s a precedent in US history for this @Cabinet, nor a database to confirm that as a fact. @BeschlossDC might know where to look, or who to call https://t.co/NaEWYXF0qq
This is the America I love: open to huddled masses yearning to breath free coming to our shores to find opportunity from around the world, committed to giving their children the dream of a better tomorrow. It’s an old story, but remains one of our best: https://t.co/aDGG6ubyVw https://t.co/gcaVYgTVkF
Thank you to @ProPublica for continuing to maintain open, civic infrastructure for everyone to use &amp; reuse. https://t.co/25TSZZqRbl	From 2012: “The United States (Code) is on @Github” https://t.co/TEeWgRBzW2 We all know more as a result.	#opengov #oss https://t.co/GhXKQoGsSk
@blakehounshell yep
@rachelkbergman It would be valuable if you could assess what databases have become inaccessible, as opposed to what's happened to websites, and where (if anywhere) backups of data exist. https://t.co/tjQV9wonII
"It's also possible that the @realDonaldTrump administration will keep delaying and drawing the consultation process out, given the absence of meaningful consequences for doing so in the court of public opinion." https://t.co/KbH5SbuBTH #opengov
The front page of the @WhiteHouse website on January 2, 2019, on the 12th day of the #governmentshutdown. Official updates sent on Facebook &amp; Twitter today both contain a nonsensical lie about the spending bills introduced in the House. https://t.co/5Pw7hFKABL https://t.co/fW8Di5epSz
@WhiteHouse @OMBPress @MickMulvaney @PressSec @hogangidley45 "This is the start of a process, not the end"	https://t.co/zjm1k5jJct
@richggall @PacktPub I wasn't asking for a retraction, but ok.
The @WhiteHouse has been silent for 4 months, after senior officials &amp; @OMBpress civil servants repeatedly told #opengov advocates that the 2017 &amp; 2018 workshops were being held in good faith. Any comment, @mickmulvaney @presssec @hogangidley45? https://t.co/VNrm9wHDx6
@PacktPub While I appreciate the link, but you've plagiarized a lot of my writing without attribution. Please appropriate quote and attribute my work. #opengov #opendata
@bot4hire Get back to me when you're ready to debate in good faith instead of use an anonymous account to avoid standing behind the courage of your convictions.
@ib_ventures @opengov You mean @OpenGovInc
@mcq1966 @gtconway3d Also false.
@bot4hire White Christian nationalism.
@mcq1966 @gtconway3d False.
@bot4hire I see we've moved on from whataboutism &amp; "lies don't affect me" to "sure he lies, but promises kept." 	"Probably" doesn't hold much water compared to what the facts show: https://t.co/PakALbP4uP
@bot4hire Internationally, trust in US government &amp; this president fell precipitously after the 2016 election, due in no small part to obvious BS. https://t.co/1CLfd0XheO
@bot4hire Historically, trust in US government has gone down after wars or corruption: Vietnam. Watergate. 2nd Iraq War. Financial crisis. https://t.co/kD5OgJs5Ze	In 2018, it's also heavily partisan, as you are demonstrating. https://t.co/tG86AaNl28	Root causes: https://t.co/DOS4df3XaC
@bot4hire You're welcome to your own opinion, as ever, but this level of presidential mendacity puts public safety at risk, undermines US foreign policy, &amp; public trust in government. It's well beyond "problematic."

@bot4hire Good one.	Now go find 15 false claims a day. https://t.co/FwjwIo5P8c
Dear @Engadget: You've been spun. https://t.co/GvLnq2TNL2	If Haley had just created an official account when she joined public service, to comply with ETHICS RULES, this wouldn't have happened. Look into the  history, going back to 2013: https://t.co/WwKqK0FCgc https://t.co/U3m99z8Jc5
