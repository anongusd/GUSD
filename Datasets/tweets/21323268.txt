The trading of the $80 million bonds on the corner of wall and broad led to the creation of the NYSE in 1792. The first products to trade on the NYSE were those Hamilton bonds as well as the Bank of New York. https://t.co/Jd5auQp3TT
Hamilton published the Report on the Public Credit in 1790, which laid out his plan for establishing the foundation of the US financial system. A key to Hamilton‚Äôs fiscal plan was the sale of $80 million in bonds to investors. https://t.co/DO4RrBq6JV
Alexander Hamilton was born on this day 262 years ago (though there is some debate on the exact year). He was the first secretary of the US Treasury, and wrote the Report on the Public Credit in his office just around the corner from where the NYSE stands today. https://t.co/Vz3sng35Gm
