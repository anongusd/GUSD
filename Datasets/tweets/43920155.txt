.@DesertFlower23 I'd say yes. Cali high speed project broke ground already. Projects under discussion in Texas (Dallas and Houston)...and FL
.@ChingChangChiu Roads, bridges, rail, transit, ports, airports, broadband. Such investments pay us back by cutting traffic and growing jobs
.@dasgeh @USDOT Best practices and strong engagement bw USDOT and local leaders. We can cut fatalities and accidents by working together.
