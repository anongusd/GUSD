Or has Facebook built a contraption that neither Facebook nor anyone else can really "fix"?
Easy to see how this task, done at scale, with a lot of better-compensated human input, would turn Facebook from a tech unicorn into closer to a traditional (and less profitable) media company. But is it even possible to do well?
But few people seem satisfied with the job they are doing. Different critics have different opinions about how adaptable FB should be to local rules &amp; customs. And as Casey and other reporters have shown it is a Sisyphean task overall.
FB in the past faced a lot of criticism for wanting to have it both ways as a platform -- all the content and little or no responsibility for it. Now, responding to public pressure, they are moderating more content.

@HotlineJosh I think in a broad sense that is true — but Schultz’s thinking is really rooted a narrower world than that.
Obviously Warren’s critics aren’t obligated to adopt her framing — and politics is in part a war of branding.	But I think it is intellectually mistaken to view her kind of proposal as a kind of mindless attack on rich people.
They view policies like Warren’s as rooted in envy, or class warfare, or as actual socialist.	But for Warren, who is not a socialist or a populist but a liberal technocrat, taxing huge concentrations wealth is a means of fixing capitalism and protecting liberal democracy.
@bdomenech I need to read this with my glasses on.
It's a notional critique of "both sides" that is functionally a critique of liberalism.	Speaking anecdotally, I hear this a lot among Wall Street types, usually but not always well-off men. They particularly dislike Warren.
Notable that Schultz describes himself as an ex-Democrat. He evinces a particular kind of centrism -- too cosmopolitan/coastal/secular to have a comfortable home in the GOP, but chiefly concerned with liberal economic policies (and, sometimes, "identity politics").

4) I think what any general interest outlet wants to be doing is ensuring that a reader following its coverage can be reasonably well-informed about a range of things -- what's happening that day, how the candidates contrast, what they've proposed doing in office.
3) News Outlet X ran three "horse race" stories for every one "policy" story is not a particularly useful metric for evaluating coverage. The term "horse race," as it is applied in some critiques, is both simplistic and opaque.
2) Voters do not always make decisions based on policy. Maybe that's bad. It's also a reality of human politics since we lived in caves (or had voters, or democracies).
There's a couple of things I hope critics, professional and otherwise, will also keep in mind:	1) Candidates do not communicate largely or even chiefly in formal policy proposals. They tell stories --about themselves, about the country.
Appreciate all the responses and counterpoints people have raised here. It’s worth all of us thinking about.
@_cingraham That’s...my point?
Finding a reader-friendly and fresh way to integrate more policy reporting into daily campaign coverage is the Holy Grail of campaign journalism.
@gadyepstein @ashleyfeinberg By all means, let's exclusively use one term that may or may not be widely understood by casual readers!
I think @Sulliview has some good ideas in here. 	https://t.co/UyW3GFwof4	What's really tough is integrating more policy reporting. There's a lot of policy reporting; but it's mostly adjacent to campaign reporting.	And candidate policy proposals are static; campaigns are not.
Ed Feulner and Ocasio-Cortez have a lot in common in some ways.
Ocasio-Cortez et al are doing now what conservative insurgents did successfully on some issues over the decades: 	Starting with an idea that seems outlandish and impossible and slowly moving it into the realm of the reasonable and possible.	Voters will render the final verdict.

On the *other* other hand, Facebook never asked your friends if they were cool with it. They argue that since your friends already shared that picture with you, they could show it to your friend through Bing.
On the other hand, Facebook also acknowledges that these partnerships have raised user trust issues. And they are now winding all of them down.
I.e., in this context, Bing or Spotify or a Russian search engine are effectively part of Facebook. They are delivering data to you -- such as data about your friends -- that you already could see on Facebook.
So what does Facebook say about all this? We had many long exchanges with the company, which provided a lot of useful context and information. 	The key argument: Facebook doesn't need explicit consent because these partners are all functionally extensions of Facebook itself.

#5: Regulators let it happen. For almost the entire period Facebook had these data deals, it was under federal consent decree with the @FTC. Four former @FTC officials tell us they think the deals violate Facebook's consent decree.
#4: Facebook was sloppy. At our prodding, Facebook found data partners it forgot it was giving your information to. And some of the partners we called said they didn't even know they were getting the data. https://t.co/1J7MUSp3tW
#3: That's right. No one told you. Try finding these details in that endless privacy disclosure. The only sure way you can limit Facebook's corporate partners from gaining access to your info is by blocking everyone else. https://t.co/1J7MUSp3tW

These deals are different in significant respects from the access afforded app makers like the one working for Cambridge Analytica.	But in a broad sense they are not. 	Companies you may never have had a relationship with could see your stuff.
The Times obtained internal Facebook documents showing in intricate detail how Facebook allocated user data to “partner” companies, ranging from @Microsoft to @amazon to @Spotify and @Yahoo. 	The key deals were all active in 2017. Some remained in place until this year.

@RTMannJr You could make that argument about many different variables in the campaign. Weather. One more visit by Clinton to Wisconsin.	And how would you distinguish between the impact of organic American content--much of it spread far more widely -- and similar Russian-directed content?

"We will never sell your data" is definitely snappier than "we will never sell your data, but we might enter into commercial arrangements in which we swap your data for other things of value without explicitly telling you."
This is perhaps not surprising for a for-profit company, but it contrasts with the company's public posture and, for lack of better term, its official corporate ideology.
One really big theme in these documents (which may only be a narrow slice of broader discussions): Zuck's thinking on changing Facebook Platform and user data access in 2012-2013 was framed entirely in terms of monetization and competitive advantage, not protecting users.

@7im Maybe, but honestly, it would end up saving such a miniscule amount of money.
Not endorsing this argument, simply laying out what I think is an interesting case. Think of it as buying back your government from special interests.
If you paid Members and staff like other well-educated professionals, you might also be able to slow down the revolving door. As it is, moving out to K Street is now basically an assumed part of the congressional lifecycle.
But is *very* easy to demagogue incumbents on raising their own pay, especially when so many of them are already rich.
Two possible reasons for why government is less responsive to the policy preferences of low-income people is:	1) Poor people cannot afford to run and serve (or intern)	2) With fewer staff, Members are more dependent on moneyed interests and trade groups in policymaking. https://t.co/hCcYKnY2VM
Things the U.S. government can definitely afford, and for which there are good arguments in the broad public interest:	1) Subsidized D.C. housing and a higher salary for Members of Congress.	2) More and better-paid staff for Member offices.	3) Intern salaries.

@chick_in_kiev @AsteadWesley I’ve seen this term used across other social science research to apply to a range of more and less explicit prejudices as tested by agreement with certain statements.	I don’t believe it’s something @MattGrossmann made up.
So when stories like ours last week evaluate her responsibility for recent events it is not via some arbitrary journalistic framework.
2nd: Sandberg was given a particular portfolio within Facebook — and extraordinary power to fulfill it.	Some of it she has succeeded at spectacularly (making money) and some less so at the moment (managing Facebook’s political, regulatory, and reputational risks).
Two other points:	First: Team Sandberg is savvy enough to know that this very discussion makes it much more difficult for Facebook to push her out even if Zuckerberg wanted to (and it seems like he doesn’t).
But then consider where this leads to:	Zuck can’t be fired because it’s his company.	Sandberg can’t be fired because Zuck can’t be fired and it would be a double standard.	So no one actually has to be held responsible except a guy who was already leaving.

That said, leadership challenges, ideological tug of war, and intra-caucus jockeying for appointments and influence are pretty routine even after wins. I would put the rump anti-Pelosi faction in that broad category.
The case for replacing Pelosi seems weak on its face—even Moulton didn’t offer many specifics in his oped beyond “new blood”—but so is the comparison to Schumer.	Schumer’s had his job for only one cycle. And consensus is the Senate Ds did pretty well given the map.

He also appeared to be concerned that if Democrats hammered FB too hard on privacy, FB would cave to Rs on disinformation.	Of course, there's a good case that privacy and dis/misinformation are actually closely related policy problems.
Context: Schumer sees Big Tech as a job creator, broadly part of the Dem family, and a relatively well-behaving industry on the scheme of things. You can see some of this in his @Recode interview with @karaswisher.
Schumer told Warner in July to back off Facebook, telling the Virginia Democrat that he should look for ways to work with Facebook, not damage it. https://t.co/MLgVwWYNWT
Facebook is also fairly close to Washington's most senior Democrat, Chuck Schumer. In 2016, FB employees gave more money to Schumer than to any other lawmaker, per @OpenSecretsDC. When fellow Democrat Mark Warner started going really hard after Facebook, Schumer intervened.
In the end, the subsequent Cambridge Analytica scandal overrode other concerns, and Facebook flipped--coming out in support of Klobuchar's bill in an effort to reset. https://t.co/MLgVwWYNWT
Yet Sandberg, in particular, was not shy about using her Democratic ties to try to dampen the fervor against Facebook. After Amy Klobuchar introduced the Honest Ads Act, she got an angry phone call from Sandberg (who had featured her on "Lean In.")
Point here: It's no accident Facebook has been slow to respond to abuse and disinformation on the platform. They believed (correctly) that it would anger the party that until last week controlled Washington. https://t.co/MLgVwWYNWT
Facebook's top D.C. guy, the Bush White House veteran (and Kavanaugh buddy) Joel Kaplan, warned against roiling Trump or the right. 	"Don't poke the bear," he told his colleagues. https://t.co/MLgVwWYNWT
But Facebook has been very focused on defending its right flank in Washington, while relations with Democrats deteriorated. 	Startling example: In 2015, Zuck asked his team whether Trump could be suspended from Facebook after calling for the Muslim ban. https://t.co/MLgVwWYNWT
We tend to think of tech companies like Facebook as liberal. Zuckerberg founded an immigration reform group. Sandberg is an ex-Clintonite and a bundled for Obama, HRC, and other top Dems. Facebook's workforce is generally liberal.

BIG PICTURE: In the post-Cambridge Analytica era, FTC consent decrees are the feds' chief means of enforcing privacy protections in Big Tech. 	But taxpayers -- even Congress! -- get to see almost nothing about the actual mechanisms.	And FTC's powers are sharply limited by law.
This test applied to one of a large number of so-called "controls" in the assessment. We don't actually know what the controls are, or how almost all of them were tested, because Facebook can change them from year to year, and those details are redacted from the public reports.
CXN: "wouldn't" say, Apologies.
Facebook disputes our finding that they failed to police these partnerships. It does appear that Facebook designed protocols, expanded in later years, to govern this sharing.	But the company would say whether it directly audited compliance with these protocols.
After @nytimes broke the news of Facebook's data partnerships this summer, @RonWyden, whose office had access to the unredacted assessments, asked for more information about what he had seen. 	Facebook replied in October. Here is their letter: https://t.co/aj61sXg75U
Our story provides some of the very few known inside details of what the FTC-ordered privacy assessment actually assessed. There have been 3 since Facebook accepted a 2011 consent decree. 	The public versions of these assessments are heavily redacted. https://t.co/e40pjD7wQA

Seeing a lot of this. Okay, so let’s say gerrymandering and voting restrictions are what undergird R electoral strength.	The paradox is that Dems still have to win enough power to remove those obstacles—with votes from people who are less impacted by them. https://t.co/Je5l4ZVpJo

The Dem successes in the Midwest are real and significant, but in practice the state-level wins may be best viewed as repairing the worst of the political damage from 2010 and 2014.
The other thing is how disconnected this election and the last one seem from actual economic conditions. The social scientists will know if that disconnect is growing (and statistically the disconnect may be less real than it seems—@johnmsides?)
@jbarro Yep, as Trump won election in a booming economy.
You can attribute some of this to political gerrymandering — which these wins will alleviate —and some if it the designed rural gerrymander of the Senate. But those are still real barriers.
What strikes me this morning is how much had to happen for Democrats to win a relatively modest House majority.	—historically unpopular president	—extraordinary Democratic midterm turnout	—huge 4th quarter influx of cash from a few big donors to match the surge in small donors.

@republicofspin They’ll love it, but that’s more a revenge win then a political validation of running as an unapologetic liberal Democrat in a purple state.
President Trump signed into law a huge tax cut, cost his party the House, and arguably saved it the Senate. 	He’s unlikely to be removed from office and will continue to appoint conservative judges.	If you’re a mainline Republican, all else aside that’s a good trade.

Meanwhile, Republicans are losing many of their 2010-2014 gains in industrial midwest, the old labor-left strongholds where Democratic collapse presaged Trump's 2016 win.
A lot of rural-state and southern Republicans who Trump campaigned for are nailing it. He's already taking credit and he's not wrong.
A lot rides on Florida and Georgia for progressives, but many will take O'Rourke's 48 percent as a moral victory (Rs will happily take the actual victory). Plus restoration of felon voting rights in FL, minimum wage, Kobach's defeat.
There is really something for everyone in these midterm results, and I'm not being glib.	Different voices and factions on right and left are all going to walk away believing they were vindicated.

The ICO notes that the companies had a close working relationship, but "we have no evidence that AIQ has been anything other than a separate legal entity" -- basically it was a frequent subcontractor for CA on projects, including in the U.S.
The report also largely dismisses accusations that AIQ--a Canadian company set up to provide some services to Cambridge--was some kind of front or shell for Cambridge itself, perhaps to do secret or improper work for Leave.
But ICO also debunks a few things. Notwithstanding a variety of contradictory statements from CA officials on the subject, the report states that Cambridge never did any actual work for https://t.co/L2w3sV1sJk.
It also seems that Cambridge made at least some attempt to delete Facebook data in its possession right after the ICO announced its investigation.	Nevertheless, ICO found that Cambridge in 2018 retained (at least) proprietary models based on the improperly obtained Facebook data.
Worse: When the warrant was served, ICO investigators found "a number of disconnected and physically damaged servers." The suggestion is that Cambridge employees may have tried to destroy evidence.
Cambridge itself was equally sloppy with the Facebook data it obtained. When the ICO executed a search warrant, it found passwords written on Post-it notes stuck to walls. They used personal email accounts to transfer data. They didn't encrypt transfers.
Keep in mind: In 2014, Cambridge, via the contractor who built its Facebook app, was a small new political data firm and just one of a huge number of companies surfing Facebook's platform and harvesting user data.
Some observations, since we've got another eight hours or so until election returns start to trickle in here in the U.S.	The big one: Facebook does not seem to have had any meaningful procedures to vet how platform partners used the data they extracted.

@mshields007 @bykowicz That's a separate question from whether union spending and influence receive enough attention relative to business spending or spending by wealthy individuals.
@mshields007 @bykowicz Got it. I do think the data shows that Republicans benefit more from "dark money". My practice, and I think it is reasonable, is that a contribution from SEIU does not count, because you know where the money comes from (SEIU members) and whose interest it serves (theirs.)
@mshields007 @bykowicz I don't understand why Mike is describing Steyer and Bloomberg contribs as "dark money" -- they are the opposite of that term as usually defined.	Unions disclose IEs like everyone else. But their "political" $ is not easily distinguished from lobbying &amp; advocacy spending.
The alleged bomber's social media -- memes and JPEGs and conspiracy theories he wrote or shared -- is a sobering reminder that this kind of content really is designed to drive certain people crazy.	And social media is the most effective system ever invented for spreading it.

The only good Halloween Twitter handle in history was @johnjcook's.
@SulomeAnderson My feeling is that moments of great crisis are precisely when we need journalism that is most sober and focused. A thousand reporters cracking wise about Trump isn't worth jack to readers and citizens.
I haven't even mentioned the most important thing, which is that all news organizations urgently need a social media policy banning Halloween-themed handle changes.
@SulomeAnderson I'd agree that what ails trust in journalism may be beyond journalism's ability to repair, at least for some skeptics. We may disagree on the best way to fix it as best it can be fixed.
@SulomeAnderson The Post's social media guidelines are basically the same as ours. "Post journalists must refrain from writing, tweeting or posting anything...that could be perceived as reflecting political, racial, sexist, religious or other bias or favoritism."	https://t.co/oB2A47jxFn
@SulomeAnderson I guess it depends on which skeptics. Also would be a better test if more of our newsroom (and others) honored the policy.
@BenjySarlin @nycsouthpaw Agreed, it is schizophrenic throughout news organizations.
@nycsouthpaw I don't think it is a bad policy. I do think it is poorly enforced and observed, in part because the broader discussion around "bias" and "opinion" is confused.

I'm assuming at that point high schoolers will have been communicating entirely in a pidgin of emoticons and triple-ironic slang, so the expert witnesses will be semiotics professors.
I wonder who the first Supreme Court nominee will be who has his or her racist or merely boneheaded high school FaceGramTweets read aloud in a confirmation hearing.

@dicktofel @adamdavidson @jbenton Rich, to your point: Liberals routinely attack as "Koch-funded" any organization or cause that has even a scintilla of direct funding from a Koch-run group, or even if they merely have an association with a group partly funded by the Kochs.
@dicktofel @adamdavidson @jbenton I'm aware that Soros is the target of frequent anti-Semitic attacks in Europe and the U.S. The question to me is whether conspiracy theories about what causes he funds are inherently anti-Semitic, regardless of who employs them.

Also gives Kavanaugh a chance to rebut allegations in a sympathetic televised setting before he has to rebut them in a more hostile or mixed setting. For millions of Americans, it will be the first time they hear directly from Kavanaugh about these matters.

This will be a bit of an experiment, much like similar efforts by @BuzzFeed and @ProPublica. But these are facts that can really only be gathered effectively--if at all--by the crowd, absent platform openness that doesn't exist on Facebook and YouTube.

Some say properly Democrat-controlled Senate next year would pressure on Cuomo to be more progressive.	I don't think it's that simple. Fact is, the weird balances of power in Albany have long enabled a kind of liberal charade among the legislature's nominal Democrats.

@richardmskinner @JMilesColeman Who knows if Cuomo goes for a fourth term? If he does, and liberal Dems want to beat him, I think they are going to have to a) split some of the big unions off from Cuomo between now and then and b) find a challenger who really excites voters of color downstate.
@richardmskinner @JMilesColeman It depends a little on where you decide the northern boundary is... at this point I think of UWS as stretching to Columbia University. But yeah, a lot of the UWS proper is Cuomo/Williams, and then Nixon/Williams in the northern third.
@MarkHarrisNYC @JMilesColeman If I am reading this map, most of Harlem went Cuomo/Williams. But maybe I am reading it wrong?
If Cuomo wins in November, then by 2022, a Cuomo will have been governor of New York for 27 of the previous 35 years. #butcheckmymath
The really fascinating thing? Look how many precincts in black central Brooklyn and southeast Queens voted for Cuomo at the top of ticket but Nixon's African-American running mate, Jumaane Williams, as lieutenant governor. https://t.co/9SHVDv120m
Now look at @JMilesColeman's map. In NYC, Nixon/Williams was, by and large, a ticket of the Upper West Side and white/hipster Brooklyn. + Queens. You definitely can't build a progressive insurgency in New York unless people of color are on board.   https://t.co/9SHVDv120m
Don’t overlook unions, which are downstate’s dominant political organizations and still the engine of progressive politics. They’ve mostly stuck with Cuomo. It’s pretty hard to build a liberal insurgency in statewide races without them, or against them.
You can rightly cite his overwhelming financial advantage in both campaigns — and maybe more importantly his overwhelming institutional advantages — but it’s still very stark.
Cuomo has now faced two primary challenges from candidates who mined the left critique of Cuomo’s governorship and he crushed them both.

Here's the super-detailed version of the IA's proposal. 	https://t.co/UaSeR1JsiL	Notably, the @InternetAssn's former regulatory affairs chief is now Trump's White House senior advisor on tech.
The proposal suggests that the FTC take the lead on enforcing new rules, but does not specify any particular new powers or authority for the FTC--a fairly small agency whose statutory authority rests heavily on questions of, more or less, false advertising.
The industry wants any national law to pre-empt both existing state privacy and data security laws AND data breach notification laws. Significantly, many states have already achieved tough rules in these areas.
Fundamentally, and not surprisingly, the industry wants a "risk-based" approach, meaning companies are punished for misusing your information only when you can prove "tangible harm." I.e., consumer privacy would not be an inherent right.

I'm confident that my colleagues on OpEd would not accept this submission from an official who was not actually senior, or who had some obvious conflict--although in a sense, this author has the ultimate axe to grind.

3) Machines control far, far, far fewer jobs. They have less to give and so command less loyalty. Many have degenerated into mere gov contracts-for-contributions enterprises, w/less connection to regular voters.
2) Today, all politics is national. Primaries in races that are low-stakes for partisan control of institutions now become high-stakes tableaux for national activism and energy.
Other theories: 1) Machines used to be relatively cost-effective and reliable way to touch voters in local elections, now other means (social media) are as effective, or more.

@antoniogm So was Facebook lying when they put out the statement criticizing the California privacy bill, which didn't have the private right of action?	Google and Facebook's trade associations also went hard against the bill.	And even now they are lobbying to weaken it in Sacto.
Sam Patten, a Manafort associate, pleads guilty for failing to register as a foreign agent: https://t.co/Iw8Lgls0LH	N.B. Patten also had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica from 2014 until earlier this year.
Is it all an elaborate con? Maybe. @jason_kint and others have argued that GDPR is only "good" for these companies if they flout the letter of law or lobby regulators to adopt their preferred interpretation of it. True! That's always a danger in government regulation.
So if this law is so good for them, why did they dislike it? Facebook's explanation is that they just didn't like the private right of action. But lots of folks think it goes deeper. Any move toward basic privacy regulations is dangerous to a surveillance-based business model.
Nevertheless, Facebook and Google both fought pretty aggressively against both the original California initiative and the final law. I think it's always useful to look at what companies do as much as what they say.
As I wrote in the story: Mactaggart never set out to "hurt" Google and Facebook. He and his team made a deliberate decision to focus on third-party data-selling/swapping. He thought he could get rid of the creepiest stuff that way.

Twitter is so biased against Trump that he is the single most influential Twitter user in politics and lost proportionally fewer followers in July’s bot purge than Barack Obama’s.

McCain's reputation as a political centrist solidified during this period, and clung to him after he had moved back in a more orthodox conservative direction on policy. 	Arguably he remained something of an institutionalist in a party that increasingly detests institutions.
Haley's interview doubles as an archeological dig into probably the peak of McCain's political centrism, in the late 90s-early oughts: Campaign finance reform, patients' bill of rights, national service, fuel efficiency standards, background checks, voting against Bush's tax cut.

DCN correctly points out that while Facebook and Twitter have borne the brunt of public and official criticism this year, Google is by far the most pervasive collector of user information. If you use Google apps or an Android phone, this study will probably shock you.

Tomorrow I'll pick up with some behind-the-scenes moments from California, where my story (and Mactaggart's) ends.
The Cambridge Analytica scandal scrambled the old playbook, in part because it indelibly associated Silicon Valley's lucrative data mining with -- fairly or not, Trump's victory. In California, Mactaggart's ballot initiative was suddenly very popular.
The playbook: Argue that privacy rules are unnecessary because "no one cares." Or too technically difficult to implement. Or will make it hard to catch criminals. Or kill jobs. It worked--until California, and until Cambridge Analytica.
He first tried to negotiate w/Facebook &amp; Google. Mactaggart sat with both companies last year to discuss a compromise. A couple months later, they secretly started funding a campaign to crush him. Dems in California led the charge, using what had become a familiar playbook. https://t.co/TkjFTrPjQf
Mactaggart had money, and passion, but no fixed idea about how to tackle privacy. He hooked up with a few privacy vets, including @JustinBrookman, @hoofnagle, and @ashk4n, who came on as a consultant. The lessons of Washington, Illinois, and other battles shaped their plan.
Around the same time, in California, a Bay Area real estate developer named Alastair Mactaggart was getting interested in privacy issues, after dinner with a Google engineer who told him how scared people would be if they knew what Google knew about them. https://t.co/VL4ks8QDYK
That lawmaker, Terry Link, has never commented publicly on his amendment, which was quickly withdrawn. But he spoke to @nytimes for the first time about what happened--contradicting @facebook's explanation: https://t.co/sf0xre27od
Big Tech was arguably even more powerful in state capitols. In 2016, after a judge ruled that a Chicago man could sue Facebook, an Illinois lawmaker proposed amending the law behind the suit -- his own law, as @arstechnica, @TheVerge, and others reported at the time.
P.S. the internal politics of the privacy activist community matter here too, as we shall see.
In the end, privacy advocates found it too weak, even as industry argued it went too far. No one really liked it. So it collapsed. And the moment was gone. The battle shifted to state capitols.
Obama famously proposed a "privacy bill of rights." Snowden derailed the effort, and in 2015, Obama’s commerce secretary -- his former campaign chair, friendly with Facebook exec and Obama bundler/advisor Sandberg -- worked with tech companies to water down what remained. https://t.co/B1s9FEEAk3
The first story begins in Washington, where the emerging giants of Big Tech wooed and then enraptured the Democrats, a party institutionally eager -- for reasons of culture, money, and politics -- to be on Silicon Valley’s good side. Big Tech had friends everywhere: https://t.co/f53w2Qo6Ja

Big Tech has two reasons to work with WH on a gentle tech regulation: Facebook faces a multi-billion-$ privacy lawsuit bought under Illinois law, and California just passed a fairly stiff consumer privacy law. If industry can get both laws pre-empted, they'll be happy.

The really interesting question —and it is broader than any one donor — is how and why the Koch network has paid almost zero price from Trump for bowing out of the presidential race.
Is there a single Senate seat the Koch high command is willing to see flip to a Democrat to teach Republicans a lesson?	Maybe, but I really doubt it.
It is maybe worth considering that Koch is “distancing” himself from Trump in rhetorical, brand-management sense rather than a functional political-spending sense. And that this isn’t a new thing since Koch “distanced” himself in 2016 and still did very well under Trump.

Maybe we can apply @joshtpm's theory of "nonsense debt" here.
If you attack a popular and effective public policy -- say, banning insurers from denying people with pre-existing conditions -- as part of an insidious socialist takeover, at least some people are going to decide that maybe they are okay with socialism.
You could argue that this is all semantics, but then again labels are powerful and curious things.
Here's a good weekend story from @alexburnsNYT on the rising Democratic left, some of whom identify as socialists, but who chiefly advocate policies that I associate with the traditional American labor-left.  https://t.co/Y1beC1HzlP
One thing that strikes me when I read about successful U.S. socialist candidates and rising acceptance of "socialism" in polls is how conservatives devalued it as an attack by using for years against the obviously non-socialist Barack Obama for non-socialist policies.
Not 100% clear, but one interpretation is that Tronc wants NYDN to pivot to breaking and commodity news. Worst case: A click farm. 	Has anyone at Tronc leadership been paying attention to trends in the media business lately? https://t.co/MqEyAlCtW7
