@shootersix @alexrblackwell @DavidPriess He is asking the equivalent of who has kicked the most field goals. Sometimes the answer is the same as who is winning but it is not the same question. Economics is important but it is far from the only way to keep score.
@Jazzziered @HartsockRob @SenMikeLee @EWErickson I'm with you guys. Fuck doctors. Those guys will recommend anything found to be effective by rigurous testing. Bring on the nut nectar and free market medicine.

@SenatorWicker Does this bill extend to newborns after they have left the hospital or are they on their own after that?
@WeWuzBoomers The bottom needle is just what a vaccine is. What does he think they are supposed to contain?
@GiffensParadox @rextreking @SRuhle Are you just adding those up? That is like saying my car goes 180 because that is the highest number on the speedo.
@GiffensParadox @rextreking @SRuhle That number seems really high. Could you show your math? You have twice the tax burden of the average American.
@femmilvet @zappaneese @abenrml @Lamhfada @Manglewood @TheCryptoDog @JohnLeFevre @AOC It is also a standard tactic for anyone whose circumstances have changed for the worse. Why is personal bankruptcy seen as a moral failing and corporate bankruptcy seen as a standard tactic ?
@jpearson1982 @RdubHall @markberman I agree that the "destroying the earth" framing is overblown. Maybe "A likely end to modern human civilization that is possibly unrecoverable" is better. 		And again, your information is coming from people that are paid to change your view, to their benefit.
@jpearson1982 @RdubHall @markberman Anti-climate change information is pushed by a group of people that benefit monitarly from people like you agreeing with them. The similarities between that and the half century fight to regulate smoking is striking.
@charliekirk11 A guy named Charlie Kirk owes me $20. How do you want to send me the money?
@jaketapper @BGrueskin @CNN Was his mom too busy to join in?
@RdubHall @markberman One guy says smoking will take 10 years off my life, another says 15. They both can't be right so smoking is fine.

@GovMikeHuckabee @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump She could NOT care less. For God's sake, get this right. How are all of you so bad at this.		I will give you halfcredit for spelling everything "correctly"
@garethstephens @jmj Have you ever played with AR? Hololens seemed like a good middle ground between being there and full VR.
@HalpernAlex Listen, I don't need your judgement. I am terrible shot and this gives me a chance to hit the target without changing clips. 		Next you are going to say I should wear my glasses when I shoot.
@garethstephens @jmj Broken management and culture is much more common than it should be but the point is still valid. If you find a way to make WFH successful for your company, you will have a real edge. 		The trend following failures will get attention and the successes will profit. Just like agile
@RichardMilhousN @drshow @nytimes @lauren_kelley What started as a sarcastic comment about wolf abortionists ended with me feeling really bad for condors. Thanks Nixon.
@CoachClintSwan @Susan_Hennessey @DavidPriess I am right there with you. Robots!		Secondly, he has a hobby that will teach him skills used in a bunch fun and profitable industries.
@RichardMilhousN @drshow @nytimes @lauren_kelley I was not able to follow. You believe a woman, or condor, should be allowed to control their reproduction? If a wolf learned to perform abortions, would they be free of any regulation?
@RichardMilhousN @redsteeze You missed something in the video.
@ChrisIntel143 @AdamWeinstein @FunnyLikeAClown I have only ever seen the absurd pictures and unhinged rhetoric. What were their intentions? Do you think they did more good than harm?
First, spell check. Second, shoulder to shoulder, a furlong of workers would contain about 440 people. She would need about 2.6 million to cover the last two pay periods for them. She could cover this amount, she is millionaire. Last, your concern for consumer rights is lovely. https://t.co/5jsW6gVSU3

@SenRonJohnson This is called a conference call. No one likes conference calls. Chatroulette would have a better chance of engaging voters.
@cjm02767 I think Tip was correct but missed a corollary, a good leader uses their position to reinforce the idea of a common good and shared sacrifice, getting people to see beyond their local politics. That seems to be non-existent with Trump.
@jim23593330 Are you a bot? You have the name and posting history of a bot. Also, are you a Federal employee or contractor? You have said both.
When did they start honeying all the nuts? How did I miss this? In the spirit of transparency, this can is empty. All of the nuts were consumed in a fashion befitting a starving person on an island who found this washed ashore. https://t.co/yRnMgP4QgP
@TKing978 @RandPaul I couldn't agree more. The entity created to represent my interests and provide for my security should not have the power to do anything worthwhile.
@TheDouglyTruth @robdelaney Doug, there comes a time in every person's life when they need to admit they can't do everything themselves. You should find a good accountant and lower your tax burden.
