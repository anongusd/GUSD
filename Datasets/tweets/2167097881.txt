With months remaining in the current Congress, the only reasonable explanation for the rush is that Senate Republicans and the Trump White House are concerned about what will emerge if the appropriate documents are produced.
This is just the latest demonstration of the extent to which Senate Republicans have hijacked the normal process for vetting Supreme Court nominees and turned it into an opaque, partisan, wildly incomplete exercise that is an affront to the Senate‚Äôs constitutional duty.
Holding a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee before receiving even a small subset of documents that Republicans themselves have requested is stunning.	https://t.co/R8G17xGn4s

What we already know about Kavanaugh is deeply troubling‚Äîwhich is why it‚Äôs even more critical that his full record come to light &amp; be debated in the Senate.
President Trump is currently a subject of the special counsel investigation into Russia‚Äôs attack on our democracy‚Äîyet we‚Äôve already uncovered that Kavanaugh is the only one from Trump‚Äôs #SCOTUS nominee list who‚Äôs openly stated that a president can't be under investigation.
With so much at stake for the #SCOTUS nomination that we‚Äôre expected to vote on in just a few short months, Kavanaugh‚Äôs complete record must made available &amp; reviewed by senators‚Äîwe cannot fulfill our constitutional duty to ‚Äúadvise and consent‚Äù without them.
Bounds‚Äôs failure to get a vote in the Senate is a reminder of just how important it is for senators to review the complete records of judicial &amp; #SCOTUS nominees before voting.
Bounds‚Äôs nomination failed because his despicable views on race relations, labor rights &amp; LGBTQ rights came to light as senators reviewed his record &amp; past writings.

There are many reasons why this #SCOTUS nominee shouldn't move forward‚Äînow we need to fight &amp; make our voices heard. Call Republican senators &amp; demand they reject this nomination: 202-224-3121. Remember: ‚ÄúThe power of the people is always greater than the people in power.‚Äù
We‚Äôre also in an critical election year &amp; according to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs own rule that Supreme Court nominations should only proceed after elections, the Senate should wait to debate any nominee until after the American people have spoken in November.
Kavanaugh has written extensively on his beliefs that a sitting president shouldn't be subject to criminal investigations or civil lawsuits‚Äîthis all but assures he would work to shield Trump from any litigation or criminal proceeding related to the special counsel's investigation
The Supreme Court could eventually end up issuing a decision on whether a sitting president can pardon himself or be criminally indicted‚ÄîPresident Trump should not be able to nominate a justice to that court while his own investigation is ongoing.
We can‚Äôt underscore enough the fact that @realDonaldTrump is a subject of an ongoing criminal investigation &amp; there's a clear conflict of interest for this president‚Äîwho has a history of demanding loyalty tests‚Äîto name a justice to the court that could be involved.
I'm going to do everything I can to stop Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination‚Äîbut there are also strong reasons why this president shouldn't be able to nominate, nor should the Senate even debate a nominee at this time.
Kavanaugh has a long track record of working to undermine the @EPA &amp; laws that protect our environment from big polluters.
In recent years, a narrowly divided Supreme Court has shown hostility toward labor unions &amp; the right of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions‚ÄîKavanaugh‚Äôs decisions have favored corporations over workers &amp; he will likely continue this troubling trend.
Kavanaugh has shown a willingness to overturn common sense protections against gun violence, such as assault weapons bans &amp; other measures.
Kavanaugh has worked to undermine the @CFPB‚Äôs power &amp; its efforts to protect consumers from predatory lenders &amp; bad corporate actors.
Kavanaugh has a demonstrated hostility toward provisions of the Affordable Care Act‚Äîprotections for those with pre-existing conditions, minimum standards for insurance, coverage for routine care like birth control &amp; breast cancer screenings are all on the line.
President Trump has been crystal clear about his intent to only nominate justices that support overturning #RoevWade‚Äîthere‚Äôs no question Kavanaugh meets this litmus test.
We need to get money out of politics &amp; end the corrosive effect that dark money &amp; corporate donations continue to have on our democracy‚Äîbut Kavanaugh's record suggests he will side with corporations and uphold our existing broken campaign finance laws.
If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages &amp; working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law &amp; more.
Our next justice should be a champion for protecting &amp; advancing rights, not rolling them back‚Äîbut Kavanaugh has a long history of demonstrating hostility toward defending the rights of everyday Americans.
Right off the bat, this nomination couldn‚Äôt get any swampier‚ÄîKavanaugh is a partisan Republican, who worked for Kenneth Starr during the Clinton impeachment &amp; in the George W. Bush White House.
The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is alarming &amp; I‚Äôm strongly opposed to his confirmation. #ScotusPick

McConnell should apply his own standard to this vacancy and wait for the American people to have their say in the fall election before bringing a nominee before the Senate.	 	If not, those of us in the Senate should do everything we can to stop a nomination from moving forward.
We arrived in this moment because of a perversion of the Constitution and Senate rules ‚Äì by Mitch McConnell literally stealing a President‚Äôs power to appoint a Supreme Court justice.
Our next Supreme Court justice should be a champion for protecting and advancing rights, not rolling them back.
What‚Äôs at stake are some of our most important values and ideals. The rights of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, the rights of workers to organize for better wages and working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law, and many more.

Taking parents and children ‚Äì who are seeking nothing more than a better life in the United States ‚Äì and detaining them indefinitely is inhumane and diverts resources from addressing actual threats to America‚Äôs security.
President Trump should immediately reverse the abhorrent ‚Äòzero-tolerance‚Äô policy, which undermines America‚Äôs highest ideals and doesn‚Äôt make our country any safer.
The lack of any plan to reunite children with their parents and undo the damage that has been done by President Trump‚Äôs family separation policy is unacceptable.
Incarcerating families and children fleeing violence and oppression is an unacceptable response to the family separation crisis created by President Trump and his administration.

We know that certain pesticides can increase the risk of cancer and can negatively impact brain development in children‚Äîit is critical that we have adequate protections.
Unfortunately, the Trump Administration is now proposing to weaken these common-sense protections‚Äîsafeguards that have been 10 years in the making.
Farmworkers &amp; others who come into close contact with dangerous pesticides should at the very least have a basic level of protection‚Äîsuch as a right to safety information about the chemicals they're exposed to &amp; an agreed-upon minimum age for handling dangerous pesticides.

In the words of Liz: "To paint us as things that don't deserve to be considered human beings ... is the most un-American thing that could happen. And if it can happen to Dreamers, what group of people here in the United States could be next? Will we allow that?"
More importantly I hope that Liz's presence at #SOTU will speak to every single Dreamer in America ‚Äì that we see you, we hear you, we love you and that you matter. This battle is not over.
I'm bringing Liz to #SOTU because I hope that her presence shows the President that Dreamers like Liz carry the flame of the American Dream forward. We must find a permanent path for them immediately.
But Liz's DACA status and work authorization will expire in a little over a year if President Trump refuses to find a permanent path forward for Dreamers.
She then went on to work for Samsung, leading STEM outreach initiatives for students in grades K-12. 		Now, Liz runs a nonprofit she founded called latinoTech, which is dedicated to helping Latinx entrepreneurs access venture capital.
In high school, Liz excelled in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), graduating second in her class and earning a college degree in mechanical engineering. After college she launched her own logistics tech startup that has employed over 900 part-time workers.

The way to end the #TrumpShutdown &amp; solve issues that Republican leaders have been ignoring for months was to take up a bipartisan proposal on the table that Democrats, Republicans, most Americans, and the large majority of Congress supports. That wasn‚Äôt the plan voted on today.
Republicans, who control the White House, Senate, and House, have a duty to govern responsibly. Pitting our most vulnerable against one another is no way to govern. Neither is passing another short-term funding bill‚Äîa practice the Pentagon called ‚Äúwasteful and destructive.‚Äù
President Trump manufactured a crisis when he ended DACA, throwing the lives of hundreds of thousands of dreamers into chaos and uncertainty. In addition, 113 days have passed since CHIP lapsed, and Senate Republicans have been using uninsured low-income kids as political pawns.

And lastly I am very proud that my friend &amp; colleague @SenKamalaHarris will also be joining me. 		We will be the 2nd &amp; 3rd African-Americans to ever serve on the Judiciary Committee in its 200+ year history.
We can not let this administration drag us backwards.
But I‚Äôve also been encouraged to see the growing bipartisan support for comprehensive criminal justice reform in America.
I‚Äôve visited prisons to talk with incarcerated individuals to hear their stories, their hopes. 		And I have seen first hand how the criminal justice system is biased against the poor, against the drug-addicted, and against people of color. https://t.co/lsDete7TdO
And that‚Äôs why in the Senate I‚Äôve introduced over 20 bills to help fix our broken criminal justice system, including my latest bill to end the War on Drugs ‚Äì‚Äì the Marijuana Justice Act. https://t.co/rA6PRjX3If
That‚Äôs why I worked with the ACLU and residents to increase transparency and seek reforms at the Newark Police Department.
That‚Äôs why as Newark mayor I established the city‚Äôs first office of prisoner re-entry to help formerly incarcerated individuals re-integrate into their communities.
That‚Äôs why one of my 1st jobs out of law school was a tenant lawyer with Urban Justice Center ‚Äì fighting for the civil rights of the most vulnerable in our communities. https://t.co/KjKUFgfFP5
But civil rights &amp; criminal justice reform matter to me. Greatly.
During Sessions' confirmation hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee ‚Äì I testified against him. Why? Because he has shown over and over again that civil rights &amp; criminal justice reform don't matter to him. https://t.co/W0MRmIfjeb

@GOP This Senate @GOP #HealthcareBill is a shameful rejection of our most fundamental American values. 		It. must. be. defeated. 	7/7
@GOP Medicaid provides coverage for America's most vulnerable ‚Äìchildren, seniors in nursing homes, low-income Americans, those w/ disabilities 6/
@GOP It's especially perverse that Senate GOP is paying for these tax cuts with an unprecedented gutting of Medicaid 5/
@GOP Just a reminder: this is all to give the richest Americans a HUGE tax cut 4/
@GOP AGAIN: under this version of Trumpcare, millions will lose health coverage, health costs will go up &amp; quality of coverage will go down 3/
@GOP In fact, this #HealthcareBill was deliberately crafted to protect &amp; increase the wealth of the few 2/
The Senate @GOP #HealthcareBill ‚Äìdrafted in secret w/ no public input‚Äì was NEVER intended to give better health care to more people 1/

As a former mayor, I know how disastrous these policies would be for American cities, police officers &amp; public safety.
No doubt our broken immigration system needs fixing, but forcing local police officers to act as ICE agents is NOT a viable solution.
Demanding that cities repay federal funding used to hire officers or fight crime &amp; arguing this will make communities safer defies logic.
It harms the ability of officers to build trust and cooperation with the communities they are sworn to protect.
It distracts police officers from fighting serious crimes.
Forcing local police to detain undocumented immigrants who are suspected nonviolent offenders wastes limited resources
To Attorney General Jeff Sessions:
But the way forward is most certainly not #Trumpcare. 	The way forward is to work together to strengthen the ACA.
There is still work to do to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care
ACA has helped countless families w/ healthcare costs, expanded access to affordable coverage &amp; reduced # of uninsured to a historic low
Today‚Äôs outcome is a testament to countless Americans who made their voices heard, and who took time to write, email, call &amp; go to an event
Trumpcare would have left millions more uninsured, all while giving the wealthiest individuals and corporations a massive tax cut
The failure of #Trumpcare is a victory for millions of Americans who don‚Äôt want to see their healthcare costs rise and their coverage worsen

It would halt science research, making it harder for America to make advancements in finding the cure for cancer, Parkinson‚Äôs &amp; Alzheimer‚Äôs
It would undermine the life-saving work done by diplomats representing American interests across the globe, making our nation less safe
By gutting Meals on Wheels, the Council on Homelessness, Habitat for Humanity &amp; more, Trump‚Äôs budget jeopardizes health &amp; safety of the poor
By gutting institutions that protect workers' rights, Trump's budget makes it harder for Americans to build a better life for their family
.@realDonaldTrump's proposed budget cuts would set our country back and make hardworking Americans suffer

Pushing 24 million Americans off health care is devastatingly cruel, and we must all fight back against this.
The independent budget experts are telling us in no uncertain terms: @realDonaldTrump is breaking his promises w/ #Trumpcare.
Remember when @realdonaldtrump promised Americans "great healthcare for much less money" and "no cuts" to Medicaid?
This bill will leave millions of Americans with worse health coverage than they have now.
This bill will cause the number of uninsured to rise by 24 MILLION over the next decade.
According to the CBO, this bill will explode healthcare costs for millions, particularly older Americans.

I will oppose this legislation every step of the way.
It‚Äôs a betrayal of @POTUS‚Äôs promise of ‚Äògreat healthcare for much less money‚Äô and 'no cuts' to Medicaid.
This proposal would damage our economy and jeopardize the health &amp; financial well-being of millions of Americans.
As well as ending federal funding for basic preventative health services offered by Planned Parenthood &amp; other reproductive health providers
All while allowing insurance companies to charge older Americans much higher premiums &amp; dismantling Medicaid as we know it
It cuts taxes for the wealthiest Americans and shifts more costs onto working families.
This repeal bill would force millions of Americans to pay more money for worse health insurance that‚Äôs attainable for fewer people.

As history has shown us, so will the American people.
I will fight every step of the way, this renewed attempt to play the worst kind of politics at the expense of our most cherished values.
This reckless and un-American executive order once again blatantly defies our nation‚Äôs highest ideals and makes our country less safe.
The previous Muslim ban was rejected by millions of Americans and blocked by the federal courts.
They are trying to exclude refugees and immigrants of a certain religion from entering the United States.
It‚Äôs clear that the Trump administration‚Äôs intent with this executive order is the same as it was with the first.
A rebranded #MuslimBan is still a Muslim ban. 		Plain and simple.

Congressional Republicans must recognize this, fully exercise their oversight responsibilities, and demand an independent special counsel
There should be an independent investigation into Jeff Sessions‚Äô actions as well
Moreover, there must be a thorough and independent investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election.
For the good of the country, Jeff Sessions must resign as Attorney General.
Now, Sessions has irrevocably eroded confidence in his ability to continue serving as an impartial enforcer of America‚Äôs laws
Sessions ‚Äìour nation‚Äôs top law enforcement officer‚Äì should know better than anyone the gravity of withholding relevant info under oath
It‚Äôs clear that Sessions withheld critical information from the Senate Judiciary Committee
New information that AG Sessions had direct contact with Russia‚Äôs ambassador on multiple occasions last year is profoundly disturbing
