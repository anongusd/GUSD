5/ The Montana Department of Corrections doesn't allow teens to be put in solitary confinement "as a sanction to manage behavior." Isolation is only allowed in emergency situations to protect teens from hurting themselves or others.
4/ Montana's prison system provides more oversight and protection to teens than they get in private programs for troubled youth.
3/ Karlye Newman, whose 2004 suicide spurred a largely unsuccessful push for meaningful regulation of residential schools, was put in isolation nearly 30 times in six months. That's according to the school’s own notes, which were included in a lawsuit filed after her death.

5/ But every time, the bill has failed when church-related groups argued regulation would infringe on their religious freedom, according to videos and audio of legislative hearings and minutes from the Legislature.  https://t.co/rEu66yliQP
4/ Since 2007, when the Board of Private Alternative Adolescent Residential and Outdoor Programs was given licensing power and programs affiliated with churches were exempted from oversight, health professionals and lawmakers have fought to close that loophole.
3/ "Because they're not licensed, there's no enforcement authority" over programs by the Division of Child and Family Services, said Sarah Corbally, its former head. Even when able to verify reports of abuse, it "had no ability to follow up and make sure the programs are safe."
2/ That means when children are sexually assaulted or psychologically or physically abused, the state's child protection system can move the child to safety but can do nothing to the program or its employees who caused the harm.
1/ In Montana, residential treatment programs can house troubled children and teens without any state oversight if the program claims a tie to a religious organization. 	https://t.co/rEu66yliQP

7/ They visited the campus and met with the school director, who assured him the program could accommodate Ben’s health needs.
6/ Ben’s father said Montana Academy was supposed to be “the Harvard of these places, a real top-notch program.” It cost about $8,000 a month, plus fees, to send his son there.
5/ The wilderness program staff recommended Ben attend a longer-term residential program to solidify his progress and suggested Montana Academy.
4/ “He was like a different person when we went up to visit him. We thought, ‘This is great.’ He's sharing his feelings and emotions with us, and we were learning how to communicate.”

5/ Zander Blewett, a Great Falls attorney, represents the girl alleging sex abuse. “Now they’re saying it’s her fault because she was already 16 at the time,’’ he said. "Our point is, well, for God’s sake, they’re a therapeutic boarding school.” 	https://t.co/XDgwJ8ECR5
4/ All three cases allege Reflections Academy was negligent in hiring the staff member, failing to protect the three girls and not reporting the abuse to the proper authorities.
3/ Reflections Academy Inc., opened in 2016. The three lawsuits allege that a staff member of Reflections Academy groomed the girls by showing them pornographic images on his cellphone, engaging in inappropriate physical contact and, in the case of one girl, sexually abusing her.
2/ The civil lawsuits were filed between Oct. 5 and Christmas Eve, 2018, in Sanders County District Court.
1/ A residential treatment program for troubled teenage girls in Montana's Sanders County has been sued three times in three months over allegations it misrepresented the qualifications of its staff and employed a man who groomed the young girls, sexually abusing at least one. https://t.co/mnft9lSbDx

4/ It's been ten years since the school where the girl committed suicide, beset by lawsuits and plummeting enrollment after her death, closed its doors.		https://t.co/0Mr60uLHy7
3/ It's been twelve years since the watered-down measures approved by the Legislature attempting to regulate for-profit residential programs went into effect.		https://t.co/0Mr60uLHy7
2/ It's been fourteen years since the Montana Legislature — spurred in part by the girl's death and a national focus on “tough love” residential treatment programs like the one where she died — vowed oversight of the programs and their methods.		https://t.co/0Mr60uLHy7
