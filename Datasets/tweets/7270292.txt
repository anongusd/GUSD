Heartbreaking‚Äîthe fact that Dems blocked this shows how radical &amp;out of step they are w/ the American people. The House must bring this important bill to a vote so Americans can see where all their elected officials stand in protecting the innocent babies who survive abortions. https://t.co/SmyZGZQQ17
After the shocking statements from the VA Gov in support of withholding medical care to babies aborted alive, Democrats claimed they were not the party of infanticide. The Senate Dems refusal to vote for this bill today shows that they are just that‚Äîthe party of infanticide.
Tonight, Senate Dems can vote to protect babies who are born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide the same level of medical care they would any other baby or they can stay silent and tacitly endorse infanticide. This is simple.

Taiwan has long shown its commitment to world health and has earned a seat at the table in all international bodies, especially those where they have shown substantial positive leadership.
Actively working to include Taiwan in the World Health Assembly will go a long way in checking China‚Äôs efforts to enact their expansionist agenda through international organizations.

The #FY19NDAA will not only give a needed pay raise to #Oklahoma troops, but it will also support the critical operations at our bases in Oklahoma through provisions that support the KC-46 (Altus), B-52 (Tinker), and PIM system upgrade (Fort Sill).
OK‚Äôs military installations are on the front lines of our nation‚Äôs military readiness, modernization, &amp;maintenance efforts. The #FY19NDAA supports our military presence by ensuring the latest training, equipment &amp;provisions are available to improve our military families' lives.
It takes a dedicated, consistent approach‚Äîone he clearly presented in this year‚Äôs bill. I applaud Chairman @SenJohnMcCain‚Äôs leadership and commitment to ensuring our military is well-trained and that the equipment they use is sufficiently maintained and combat-ready.
Under the @POTUS admin, we have been able to begin the long process of rebuilding our military after eight years of chronic underfunding &amp; budget cuts. Chairman @SenJohnMcCain fully appreciates continuing to rebuild our armed forces cannot be accomplished in just a year or two.
As Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I prioritized maintenance &amp; modernization efforts that will allow us to remain competitive against China &amp; Russia‚Äôs advancements and sponsored provisions to support critical partners in Africa, Taiwan and the Kurdish Regional Government.
Earlier this year, @realDonaldTrump outlined the first National Defense Strategy in over a decade that correctly prioritized the growing threats to our country and the direction of our military. Today‚Äôs #NDAA reflects and supports this strategy.		https://t.co/0YTwjyTZJm

No more. https://t.co/2CiDi92emR
@POTUS Remember that the admin‚Äôs strong sanctions‚Äîthe ones that brought NKorea to the table &amp;led to the release of the 3 Americans‚Äîare still in place. As NKorea remains economically &amp;diplomatically isolated from the world, I believe that they will be willing to come back to the table.
This is a continuation of @POTUS' tough talk &amp;clear expectations for NKorea. He‚Äôs never wavered from the commitment that talks had to be about complete denuclearization. If there was an indication Kim Jong Un was not willing to uphold that, then POTUS was right to cancel.

U.S. Conference of Mayors reports that each public dollar invested in water infrastructure increases private long-term GDP output by $6.35
Investment in infrastructure expands our economy. Plain and simple.
We have to make sure fed mandates don‚Äôt force communities to spend millions of $ on projects that may have little impact on water quality
We need increase support for small rural communities who simply can‚Äôt afford the investments that @EPA wants them to make. @EPWMaj

In our proposal to help #Flint and other communities around the country, we are planning to provide $70 million to capitalize WIFIA. @EPWMaj

It is time for a White House that will rebuild our military, protect our borders &amp; execute a clearly-stated strategy w/ allies against ISIL
The president's policies are weakening our nation‚Äôs security at a time when we face the most dangerous world in modern day history.
He also is working to close the GTMO, releasing most of these terrorists to countries around the world &amp; bringing the remaining to US prison
Instead, he has downplayed Benghazi, called ISIL a JV team and said ISIL was ‚Äòcontained‚Äô hours before the attacks on Paris.
Terrorism is what the president should have been discussing with the global community during his visit to Paris this past December.
And instead recognize and stand up to the reality of the serious threat of radical Islam.
I urge the president to set aside his rhetoric that global warming is the biggest threat we currently face.
The US must also continue to work together with Europe and all our allies to preserve democracy and protect our freedom-loving citizens.
U.S. must continue to reassess &amp; tighten our own security measures and vetting process of individuals looking to enter the country.
Dir. Clapper has testified ISIL is ‚Äòtaking advantage of the torrent of migrants to insert operatives," &amp; are "skilled in phony passports."

Two courts have already said #WOTUS is likely illegal.  It will be overturned. We don‚Äôt have to stand for this.  We can stop this rule.
In '09 @EPA claimed they needed legislation to expand federal control. When leg was unsuccessful they redefined #WOTUS though regulation
EPA‚Äôs entire rule-making process, and now the lack of debate in the Senate on #WOTUS ‚Äì is an example of Washington at its worst.
Instead of doing their jobs, 11 senators asked EPA to change final #WOTUS rule through guidance instead of voting to allow debate on S1140

It‚Äôs time for Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund our roads and bridges. Americans demand it, and our economy depends on it
With a fully-funded, long-term hwy reauthorization, OK would see a savings of $122M &amp; millions more savings from contracting certainty
OK lost $63M in construction dollars over the past few yrs as a result of inefficiency and uncertainty of short-term hwy extensions
Mark my words - any extension longer than three weeks will result in a lost 2016 construction season. #DRIVEAct
2nd hurdle: DOT Sec. Foxx has said the HTF will drop to dangerous level by Nov which will significantly affect states' construction seasons
Addressing these Dec. deadlines will requires Congress' undivided attention, some solutions could, I fear, siphon off payfors in #DRIVEAct
1st: Congress has other very pressing deadlines to address: Dec. 11 - govt funding; Dec. 31 - tax extenders &amp; expiring NDAA provisions
If we fail to get this done by Nov. 20, we will be faced with two new significant hurdles.
Due to the similarity in both @EPWMaj and @Transport bills, I'm confident Congress can have a bill on @POTUS‚Äôs desk by Thanksgiving

We are now just days away from another cliff, and the two Chambers have not yet been able to conference a long-term transportation solution
The Senate worked hard to put forward a bipartisan solution for our nation‚Äôs roads and bridges and passed the #DRIVEAct 65-24
Short-term extensions have caused industry, stakeholders, &amp; local govt to lose faith in Congress‚Äôs ability to provide funding certainty
Since expiration of SAFETEA-LU in ‚Äò09, Congress has passed one short-term extension after another just to keep highway program in operation

Gitmo a great resource for our nat'l security, prevents bringing terrorism into US. Terrorists shouldn't have the same rights as US citizens
I'm helping lead 50 Senators who're telling Obama we will NOT be bound by the UN Arms Trade Treaty- it violates the rights of the US people
B/c of shutdown NPS is closing national parks/memorials, putting up barriers to make a point--costing MORE than leaving them open. Absurd.
IRS &amp; White House exchanged confidential taxpayer info. The latest in a string of disturbing Chicago-style tactics of Obama Administration.
RT @SarahPalinUSA: Wishing @JimInhofe a speedy recovery. We need him back fighting for us in the U.S. Senate!
Feeling good after my heart surgery. May miss some votes-I encourage the Senate to pass a bill reopening gov't &amp; stick w/conservative values
Obama is favoring big business over regular Americans. #Obamacare employer mandate is delayed, Obama should delay the individual mandate too
Obama making gov't shutdown worse by putting up a FENCE around WWII memorial, Vets can't get to it. Unnecessary, disgusting political ploy

It would be easy to send a few cruise missiles into Syria-if it would end there. We do not have a clear military objective &amp; could escalate.
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and all those affected by the senseless act of violence at the Navy Yard today.
We can't continue to cut military funding and expect to meet our national security needs. Obama can't have sequestration and Syria.
It's Dove season in Oklahoma-- RT if you are thankful for our Second Amendment rights.
RT if you agree Obama should not take action in Syria w/o approval from Congress.
