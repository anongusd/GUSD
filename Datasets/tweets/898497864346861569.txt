@BatBinSup On it😊
@BatBinSup American lives shouldn't be a negotiation tactic. Imho
@BatBinSup Yet Obama was able to broker the Iran deal never meeting him and giving him a platform.
@BatBinSup Oh and he absolved Kim for Otto Warmbier's death.
@BatBinSup The brutal dictator got to sit down with the most powerful leader of the free world and got nothing accomplished. Now North Korea can use that propaganda.

@BGtheGreatest @ScottWalker The difference is she isn't attacking one single person repeatedly(stalking). And he doesn't rebut her, he gaslights to fit his narrative. That's another word for lying. Oh, and you say lefty like it's a bad thing	🤷‍♀️

@BGtheGreatest @ScottWalker The fact that you and Walker have yourselves in a tizzy about a 28 year old freshman congresswoman is glorious. Toughen up dude.

@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Heard of them. Thank God you came along. I had been debating him.a long time. Do you know how prevelant they are? Oh and the despise the military
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok, so I just researched these people a little. They are scary. They don't think they have to follow laws, pay taxes, cops don't have any jurisdiction, are a bigger threat than almost all terror groups in the US. I just couldn't find how common they are. I can't believe I never
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash It is. You get paid peanuts. I was working 3 jobs to make ends meet at the time. When ur 17 and want to go to college, there aren't a whole lot of options. So technically, my tax dollars were paying for it too😊
@Triumphantlier @gunther1970h2 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Omg. They are lunatics. Wow!!!😂😂😂
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I am in awe!!! And this dude was giving me a hard time because my ex husband joined the military to get the GI bill and said he got a free education off his money. I live a very sheltered life wow.
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Omg, that's literally crazy!!!
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I sure wasted a lot of time trying to understand his perspective. Thanks for the heads up. I appreciate it.
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok time to block, thanks for the info!!
@OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash You just said fuck the cops and you don't even have plates on your car
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Fee pays for. You can own a car but in order to use public roads, there is a fee. He believes he doesn't have to pay any taxes but still be able to use all the things taxes pay for
@Triumphantlier @OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I didn't, this dude is off his rocker. He is trying to tell me the government is taking away his right to travel. That he doesn't have the right to own a car. My point is you can own a car but if you don't pay the registration then you don't have the right to use the roads that
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash That's a demented thing to say
@OutlawedMind @GrayHouse77 @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash So what about Vietnam Vets? They were forced by the government. No compassion for them either?
@OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash So you think the government owes you roads to drive on? Stoplights and signs to keep people safe. If you get in an accident and hurt somebody, who is going to pay for their hospital Bill's. Dude you.are selfish
@Triumphantlier @zekeslater @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I worded it wrong, sorry.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash My husband worked for peanuts and earned his Gi bill, graduated college, got a great job and we were able to afford for me to go and get my degree. I was working 3 jobs while he was in the service so I paid for it too. I am extremely proud that our teamwork and hard work paid off
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Obama cut the military budget big time and the GOP used it against him at every possible turn. Trump has added more to military budget compared to anyone in modern history
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I hate cops too so don't refer to them as your cops
@OutlawedMind @GrayHouse77 @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Apparently you haven't met very many vets, if any.
@zekeslater @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Nobody forces you to register it.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Just don't pay your property taxes then.
@Triumphantlier @zekeslater @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Ya so you own it. What's your point.
@OutlawedMind @zekeslater @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash You can own a car all you want. If you want to drive it on public roads, you pay a fee to pay for those roads. Don't pay it. Park your car, sit  in it, wash it, wax it, just keep it off public roads.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Worked out great. Thanks for asking.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Here is an idea. Just don't pay taxes then you wont have anything to complain about. Also don't use anything that taxes pay for.
@GrayHouse77 @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Have you taken any homeless vets into your home? Have you fed any? Well I have. Guaranteed you haven't
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash You pay property taxes, that's not taxes on your house. That money pays for schools, public safety, parks, snow plowing, street maintenance, sewers etc. How would you suggest those things get paid?
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash He didn't have a zero policy and thousands of children weren't being sexually assaulted. Oh and he didn't steal children never again to be returned to their parents
@4LibertyRising @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Hahahaha
@zekeslater @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Where does it say it's your right to own a vehicle?
@gunther1970h2 @alllibertynews @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I am not even going waste my time educating you. You are way too stupid
@gunther1970h2 @alllibertynews @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I find you utterly disgusting that as an American citizen that you don't know to spell or write a coherent sentence. Sad.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash What part of working 3 jobs don't you understand? Neither of us have a problem with hard work. We also needed healthcare so we didnt rely on the government for that. You won't shame us for working our asses off.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash My HUSBAND'S gi bill. I worked 3-4 jobs at the same time. We could have just done it the easy way and taken out student loans, defaulted on them and let the government pick up the tab.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Did it so we could be self sufficient and be contributing members to society.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Well nobody is telling you can't walk or ride a bike. So apparently you still have the right to travel.
@GrayHouse77 @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash What part of they LEGALLY applied for asylum is so difficult to understand? You must not have children. If something is willing to walk thousands of miles in the desert surrounded by so much danger, you must be desperate to save your child. I know I would do anything for mine.

@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Trump and Nielsen implemented the zero policy to deter https://t.co/DTnCwGFUW9 coming.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash No, that's false. Obama never separated families. Ever. There were unaccompanied minors they were forced to put in detention. Big huge difference.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash You then start school, work a part time job, have a baby and are struggling to put food on the table, one weekend a month would let you make enough to make rent and all you did was basically parades and community service. In 98, war was not even a remote possibility to us.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash When you are 17 years old wanting to go to college and have no way to pay for it and recruiters come in selling it. It seems like the answer to your prayers.  You spend 4 years at Fort Hood with not even a thought of war and being able to prepare for college, you thank god.
@UK_National So it won't cost a cent to have lawsuits after lawsuits over a wall that will never be built. Gotcha
@wsutton39 @4LibertyRising @kenolin1 @justinamash And neither are yours
@OutlawedMind @AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I never told you who I vote for.
@gunther1970h2 @alllibertynews @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash These children came with their parents and were separated under the zero policy trump enacted. The legally claimed asylum and yet were treated by criminals and separated from their children. You defending any part of this is disgusting.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok, I am having a total blonde moment. I don't understand what you mean by selling our rights to travel back to us??
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Nope, this was entirely the GOP. And trumps cabinet picks.
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash This was trumps policy. I can't believe they aren't getting charged with human rights abuse. It keeps me up at night
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash The catholic church ( I grew up catholic).is an abomination.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash He joined right out of high school for the GI bill. Then joined the guards in 98 to help our young family financially. At that time, war wasn't even a remote possibility. He was supposed to be done in 2002. Then 9/11 happened....the rest is history.
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash He is my ex husband but we are still close. He is just a different person now. I am always there for him. It really sucks. Our kids don't get the dad he was which is the worst part.
@OutlawedMind @AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash If you hate it so much, why do you stay? Not being condescending, just wondering.
@wsutton39 @4LibertyRising @kenolin1 @justinamash I emphatically disagree with your assessment.
@OutlawedMind @AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash I am really don't think I've told you who my heroes are.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash So you believe someone who is convicted of drunk driving should still be able to drive? Yet no one is stopping them from using a cab or train or just walking? Am I understanding you correctly?
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash We elect pedophiles and jail babies and allow them to be sexually assaulted in our custody. The trump policy.	https://t.co/XuY1EuRrTY
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash The U.S. and not everything he said was false but still. We are stuck with this idiot President and just trying to deal getting through that. My ex husband, father of my children spent 3 tours in Iraq. He was in the national guard and was ordered. It just about destroyed him
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Lol ya for sure!!!
@wsutton39 @4LibertyRising @kenolin1 @justinamash No it sucks, all that money wasted when trump himself knew it was going to get blocked in the courts. He doesn't care about the money wasted. He just wanted to look good to his base.
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Blocked
@AccidentalAnar1 @AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Ya, it's time to block. He talks about evil yet that's all that comes out of his mouth.
@wsutton39 @4LibertyRising @kenolin1 @justinamash I've been trying not to throw this in your face. The wall will never be built. Lawsuit after Lawsuit will keep this in the courts for years. Trump even admitted it when he declared this so called emergency. As soon as one lawsuit goes through, another one will start.
@AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Lmao, seems to be your country too. Nobody is forcing you to live here. As I learned recently,  travel is a fundamental right. I really think anyone that has that much rage should seek professional help.
@OutlawedMind @AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash All destructive anger does is cause harm.
@AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Us pretty sure you're the one who should delete your account. You spew hate and disdain for fellow humans. You are pathetic.
@AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Far from numb and full of compassion, too much I've been told. I definitely never disowned my sibling for joining the airforce. That sounds pretty horrible. But you be you. Spewing hate and disdain instead of actually doing anything.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Thanks for that. I wasn't aware of that. My question is tho, how has government stopped travel? I seriously am uneducated about this.
@AntiStupidWars @OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash Please seek help.with your anger and hate issues
@AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash You also seem extremely angry, there are doctors to work through this anger with. And sometimes there's some medication that may help.
@AntiStupidWars @AccidentalAnar1 @OutlawedMind @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash You seem nice. Disowning your own brother. Wow.

@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Why is traveling a fundamental right?  If we can't afford a car or car insurance to drive and travel, how is that a fundamental right? If we can't afford to fly to Orlando for a family vacation, how is that a fundamental right? I know of nothing in the Constitution or law
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash How to you propose we pay for things? Military, etc?
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Don't disagree with that
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash I have respectfully answered every one of your question.

@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Nope, I have zero problem if someone wants to spew hate speech in the roads. But expect some resistance. They aren't entitled to use private platforms like  Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. That's not infringing on their rights. They can say whatever they want in public places.
@OutlawedMind @AccidentalAnar1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @kenolin1 @justinamash We sure did. Dirt roads. Crappy bridges, etc.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash No, I mean people don't always use guns for self defense.

@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash What does that mean?
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I am not trying to force anything on you. I was just trying to give you a different point of you. Just like I was trying to understand your point of view.

@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash It's never going to pass with this Senate but I thought I did answer you. Why wouldn't you just get a background check so that wouldn't even be an issue.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Especially the more I read how they work. Traveling???
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I am literally trying to learn. Why are you being so condescending? Are you referring to fishing and hunting licenses? If you are, I think.those are bullshit. 1st ammendment???? If you are talking about no knock warrants, those are corrupt as hell
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Except for gun show loopholes, online sales, and person to person sales.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I am definitely not a dirty bastard. I am a kind, caring, thoughtful person. I want everybody to live a fulfilling life without infringing on someone else's happiness. I want to live in a world where everyone has opportunity to live a prosperity filled life.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok. If that's the case, don't you think if you want that kind of gun, you should have to go through intensive training? I don't think an amateur should be able to possess one without it.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I 10000000000% agree with that!!! Lobbyists writing laws by bribing reps...HUGE issue in Michigan..	We have no fault. Never had a ticket, hubby had one speeding ticket 10 years ago and 16 year old daughter. $856 a month.
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Did it bug u to have to do it? How big of an inconvenience?
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash So apparently you're not a U.S. citizen since if u were, it would be your government too
@PatrickOwnby1 @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Because if the Government decides to invade its citizens, your guns will protect you from their tanks, bombers, IEDs, grenades and most sophisticated guns on the market? Um ok.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Again, what's the big deal about doing a background check? My husband is a hunter and gun collector. We have a huge gun safe in our basement. Neither of us has a problem going through a universal background check.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok, I'll bite, give me some examples of that happening.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Why would you be against getting a background check?
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Don't put words in my mouth. You are the last person to criticize when it.took you 2 days to study the difference between debt and deficit.
@PatrickOwnby1 @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash I probably should have and called our local sheriff's office where my nephew works and he told me it was legal since it was a hunting rifle. If it was a pistol, I would have to.  It wouldn't have cost me anything. I made a mistake. Apparently, I am the only one who ever has.
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash He is literally taking money from the military, disaster relief, and programs to fight drugs coming into our country.	https://t.co/ab1xNmB2eD
@PatrickOwnby1 @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash The humanitarian crisis the dems were talking about was separating children from parents seeking legal asylum and putting them in detention centers. It's still happening and is an atrocity. Thousands of these children have been sexually abused. Don't take my word for it, Googleit
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I am trying to understand your views. I really am. Nobody is calling for a ban on guns. Not everyone has the best intentions. You have to know that. Work with me, I am open to other points of view. Do you have any ideas or solutions??
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash No, I hate this potus. That wasn't what I was talking about.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Guns that's only purpose is to kill a human being with maximum damage. Unless of course you are ok with grenades, RPGs, and all those awesome war defense materials.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash We have to have car insurance in case we cause an accident that kills or severely injure someone. Why is this any different.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash How "you people"? Who are you referring to? I don't understand that take???
@PatrickOwnby1 @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash No police should too. They also go through extensive training. I should have added that.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok, so what do we do to change course in your opinion.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok, I haven't brought Obama up once. Because I knew my views would make this debate go off the rails. Did I agree with everything he did? No and I will leave it at that.
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Dude, that is not remotely true.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Come on, I thought we were having a respectful debate
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Universal background checks and mandatory waiting periods do not cause people to go to jail
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash So you're not? Can I ask why?  Not everyone with a gun is a good guy.  I live in a place where Nov 15th is considered a national holiday. The schools close, many local businesses all for opening day of Deer Day. Everyone around here is fine with background checks
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash How hard is it to pass a universal background check?  Never said anything about drug laws or super predator laws. Please don't put words in my mouth.
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash And school shootings shouldn't be rare, they should be nonexistent
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Except when you buy a gun online or at a gun show. Ex: I won a mossberg at a Wildlife banquet. They did a background check. I already had a decent hunting rifle. I put an ad on craigslist, sold it to a stranger and it was perfectly legal.
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash So why wasn't it an emergency the last 2 years when the GOP in charge?
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash I 1000% agree that our debt is unsustainable. The GOP was the ones that have drilled in our head it was our biggest enemy and yet	https://t.co/dtvA7U5iZA	.
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash 1.3 billion was appropriated for the wall. Do you have a clue how much the entire wall will cost?
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash That's a flat out lie
@wsutton39 @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Ok I need to ask, who is your rep
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I don't think anyone who hasn't had military training should be allowed to own war guns.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I don't want anyone locked up. I want universal background checks, no one that has a history of abuse, mental illness to be able to get a gun. I think everyone besides military should have to go through training. I think you should have to have insurance on your guns.
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Please don't hunt me
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash As much as I would love to declare a national emergency for gun violence, that's not how it works.
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Do you understand what the trade off was?
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash Worse than trump? Seriously?
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash So you don't thing stealing money from money already appropriated for other things is legal? Btw, check out where he is stealing the money from.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Full disclosure, I don't like the current guy proposing it.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Seriously, where did u get I think more people need to be locked up? That is definitely not one of my opinions
@PatrickOwnby1 @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash That's what I meant to say lol.	And Citizens United will never be overturned with the current court.
@PaulG16808960 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Research the big pharma and insurance companies.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash The 2006 Security Fence act was passed by Bush. But to your point, all Dems are for Border Security. There is not one single on that isn't. But a vanity wall isn't the answer. Upgrade the fences in disrepair, use technology, hire more border agents.
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Not true	https://t.co/zGWGwZtFqa
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash So you are ok with having a for profit health care system? Literally people profiting off people's sickness? And insurance companies and pharma getting wealthy off other people's hardships?
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash My daughter just got her driver's license. She had to go through extensive training, pass multiple tests and it took her a year. We now pay $320 a month for car insurance. Why such a higher standard for a drivers license compared to a gun license?
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Do you have a better solution. I'm tired of dropping my kids off at school and praying they come home safely. I live upper Michigan, we have a hunting camp. What's wrong with universal background ground checks? All of us up here are for them.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash What are you talking about?
@PatrickOwnby1 @wsutton39 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash Nope. I'm talking about the first offer.https://t.co/k9ENrMiK1Z
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Money go to American men and women supporting families. Using their income to spend money in our economy.
@OutlawedMind @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash First off, in 95 I was just out of high school. It never would have crossed my mind. I am all for Border security. I think our agents are amazing. So if we are going to spend that amount of money. Why not hire more border agents. We could hire thousands more. I would rather that
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @kenolin1 @justinamash I'm not agreeing with that or disagreeing with that. But the current one is just raised it to a bar that I worry will never be lowered. I also think most popular.could be grouped.with that. I think lobbying should be banned
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash You do realize the dems offered im.25 billion.for a wall and he turned it down, right?
@PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash And to be honest, I am kind of hoping he sets that precedent because you know how politics goes. The next dem will claim a national emergency for climate change, health care, and gun violence. It's a bad idea.
@PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Lol, I am 100% against a wall yet if it is done legally and can be funded legally, I will voice my dismay against it but can't say a word about its legality
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash No one could have ever imagined a Potus under 19 investigations would ever hold the office. They trusted the person in that office would always put the United States first. There was no way for them to  imagine a traitor in the white house without Congress holding him accountable
@wsutton39 @PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @kenolin1 @justinamash When Congress passed the Emergencies Act in 1976. They didn't think it would be used to bypass Congress. It was put there in case of an actual emergency when Congress didn't have time to act. They never imagine a POTUS would use it for a fake emergency to go around Congress.
@PatrickOwnby1 @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash And most of us want stricter gun laws, universal health care, etc.  They don't. We can have disagreements on what we want and how to do it responsibly. That's how a democracy is supposed to work. But we follow the Constitution or change laws through Congress. He is upholding it
@OutlawedMind @wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash You are forcing me, a left leaning Democrat to stick up for a Conservative Constitutionalist

@MisterUbiq @browntailedhawk Hey, Trump promised he'd release his taxes. Shocker, he didn't. Forgive me for questioning it. You still didn't explain his votes. All you did was attack me. How are you any better than trump supporters.
@MisterUbiq @browntailedhawk Dude you just called me dumb. You are a real ass. I hope you aren't the future of our country. You are as bad as the trumpers.
@MisterUbiq @browntailedhawk I freely admit I am uneducated. That was literally why I asked. Why the hostility?
@Wendelltwink311 @AylingLindsay Oh, I see @wittywriter commented. I can't really see her picture but she doesn't look white to me 🤔
@MisterUbiq @browntailedhawk One question I do have. What are your thoughts on Bernie not releasing his taxes? And his chief Strategist Ted Devines ties to Paul Manafort. Also him voting against the Magnitsky Act and then missing the vote on Russia sanctions?

@Wendelltwink311 @AylingLindsay The Corwin amendment was never ratified. The DeWolf family isn't putting statues up honoring their ancestors. In fact they are for reparations. I don't care if you call it a war between the states or a civil war. They wanted secession from the United States. That is traitorous

@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash So if that's your theory, do you really think terrorists would cross the Mexican border? No they would do it on the Canadian border. Are you advocating for a wall on the Canadian border? How do you propose stopping tunnels and ladders? How do you propose stopping boats?
@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash And yet you didn't know the direction between the national debt and the national deficit. It took you days to finally be able to come back with the answer. Sure Jan.

@browntailedhawk Omg. Me too! I am literally shocked at how so many people around me are such low information voters and how they let hate and their insecurities shape their views. It's maddening. I have sent this meme to many of our fellow Yoopers. https://t.co/Cfl79rI2r3
@browntailedhawk 100% . We have to. Never know when all this snow will wall us off with the rest of the country, eh?
@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Lol, I really don't need you to explain things to me. How quickly you forget Obama inherited an economy in a serious recession. He pulled us out of it. If you want to thank anyone, you should thank Bush for putting our economy in a place where Obama needed to save us.
@browntailedhawk McConnell the GOP just is evil. Btw, I appreciate you teaching me things😊https://t.co/6rk5PJ3oZ0
@browntailedhawk I honestly have a ton to learn. I never spent anytime learning politics until trump. I now spend a ton of time learning it. I read a thread the other day explaining MTRs which I had never even heard of. I tried to find it but can't. I did find this old article. I think under
@browntailedhawk I 100% agree with that.

@browntailedhawk This bothered me too. During this vote, why would 26 dems vote to an ammendment the GOP was forcing? Is it because they are in tough districts? I am not educated enough on it.
@browntailedhawk https://t.co/oc52vHmzcI
@browntailedhawk Ok, did you read the article, is this what you are referring to?https://t.co/ggNeuFyyFa
@browntailedhawk Ya that bothers me. A lot.
@browntailedhawk People are unaware about. Not saying I agree with everything she says and does but she is making people aware. On a side note, she endorses Bernie, I will take this all back. I am really hoping for @ConnieSchultz husband😊
@browntailedhawk I understand why you feel this way. My question is aoc is 1 of 435 so why are people freaking out about her? What I do like about her is she is getting people to discuss things. Doesn't mean you have to agree with her. I like that she is bringing awareness to a lot of things
@browntailedhawk @neeratanden @charles_gaba @IanN_RN @wheelguy123 Our teachers should go through the best training possible and make a wage that they don't have to stress about buying a home let alone a car. This is fundamental to giving our children the tools to be successful in life!! This is just my humble opinion.
@browntailedhawk @neeratanden @charles_gaba @IanN_RN @wheelguy123 My opinion is that education should be the number one priority in this Country. They should be funded so much that schools have a surplus. It shouldn't be if you live in a poor district, you don't get as much because people in your district they can't afford a mileage.

@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Pull up Delta County Michigan and look at all the drug busts. It's coming from Americans. Meth, heroin, tons of prescription pills, etc. The Americans are the ones doing the drugs.
@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash So explain to me why no where in that article does it say they were from Mexico. Which leads me to believe they were Americans trying to smuggle drugs back from Mexico. They aren't charged with illegally crossing the border either.

@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Yep, because you are making shit up. Most undocumented immigrants are here from overstaying their visas. Most drugs are stopped at legal points if entry or on boats. Illegal border crossings are lower than they have been in many, many years. These are all stats you can verify.

@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash Why didn't he get it the first two years. Huh. Probably because it wasn't an emergency. But again, I really do hope he sets the precedent. Because it will be glorious when the next Democratic President just bypasses Congress to get what they want by declaring a national emergency
@wsutton39 @kenolin1 @justinamash And I truly hope be sets that precedent because I guarantee you, the next Democratic President will use that same precedent for healthcare, gun violence, and climate change.  Funny how it wasn't an emergency for.the first 2 years trump was in office though.

@BlueballsNina @DAVIDHA33427366 There is zero evidence that Congress members have dual citizenships. You make up conspiracy theories. Facts. Facts. Facts.
@BlueballsNina @DAVIDHA33427366 You are just spewing lies. And stupid, uneducated people believe you. Give me a break. You can have opinions but you have to prove facts. And you can't.
@AlanDersh @TrueFactsStated You were saying?	https://t.co/D8ZEP3vrE3

@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger We really don't need a border wall. We need technology, we need more agents, and drug dogs. He wants 5 billion, do you realize an archaic wall is estimated to be 35-40 billion? So that 5 is peanuts to appease his base? There are so many more ways to secure our border.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger And if you're union, right to work should outrage you? Why doesn't it?

@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger That's just a Republican tagline. No Democrat is for open borders. They want humane immigration laws. And Democrats talking points are the same ones FDR talked about in 1944. He called it the 2nd bill of rights. It's just sad people don't research and listen to the hate
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger But it's not, it's insurance companies being greedy and want to profit off people being sick. Please research it. It started in the mid 90's. That's when healthcare prices started to drastically increase.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger Do you really believe the economy is so great? Yes, minimum wage jobs with no benefits are abundant but good jobs with a living wage and decent benefits are not.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger And they also are paying less into pensions. It sucks but union wages and benefits are something to be grateful for. Pay attention, Republicans are pushing to get rid of them. Right to work is all Republican policies. Just research it. Voting for them is voting against yourself.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger Ok, I get that. We pay a lot too for healthcare and also have a H&amp;W fund. But why do you think it's because of Obamacare? One has nothing to do with the other. It's the insurance companies raising their prices. People assume what you think but it is simply not true.

@realDennisLynch What a patriot!!! Wtg Governor!
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger That is a myth that Obamacare raised prices. Prices for healthcare were skyrocketing before that. Because of big pharma and insurance companies, they are/were the ones raising prices.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger By not being able to use work related deductions, mortgage interest, and property tax, it puts us in a higher tax bracket. So we pay more because it shows we made more plus we are paying 28% now.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger I do appreciate the respectful dialogue. It's refreshing, really.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger I thought you said you were union? How would Obamacare have affected you? 3 bucks an hour if you work 50 hours a week is only $150 a week? For healthcare for a family? That's cheap.

@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger I am just not ok with that. Our deficit has skyrocketed, screwed middle class all so corporations could buy back stocks? So they needed more money? How can anyone but wealthy people be happy with that?
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger So why would you be ok with this tax scam?
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger That's simply not true, at least of Bill Gates. And comparing the wealthy to middle class is apples to oranges.	https://t.co/cO7vcJsHjf
@wittywriter Mitchie, u really shouldn't be lol
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger Those deductions helped make it worth him being on the road and away from our kids. Now we are stuck with a huge tax bill. Btw, I don't know a single union worker who wouldn't itemize. That doesn't make sense.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger Apparently, you have jobs close to home then. My husband is on a job 5 hours away from us working 5 10s so not only does he have mileage, but a $250 motel bill a week. Unions don't cover expenses, if they bid a job, SOMETIMES u may get a per diem but that rarely happens.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger So you had more taken out, therefore you are paying more taxes. Why are middle class/poor people ok with this. It is utterly crazy to me.
@andrewlukenbach @rmayemsinger My husband is a Union Boilermaker which means we basically support two households because he works on the road. All his work deductions are gone. We can't claim our mortgage interest or property tax yet if we buy a private jet, we can use that.	https://t.co/2QVx0mtzfj

@TheShadow4444 @StevenTDennis You must have missed his campaign then. He said Mexico was paying for the wall. He never said if the United States tax payers won't pay for the wall, I will just shut the government down.
