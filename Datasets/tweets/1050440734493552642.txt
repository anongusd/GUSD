Americas got talent is as joke.
If liberals get in in 2020 we are gonna be in deep doo doo
Simon is an idiot. That poor girl would not have been voted in and he knows it. The golden buzzer I know where he needs to put it.
The left and their hounds of hell are going after anybody and everybody close to our president . They can't get Trump so they are causing trouble and terror to this country so another Republican will never be elected. The crazies are on the loose. Out of the asylum.
THE FAR LEFT MUST BE VOTED OUT, FOR OUR REPUBLIC TO SURVIVE.
Pelosi works for Mexico.
To quote RoboCop: Obey the law, stay out of trouble .
Liberal Socialist " Go ahead make my day! "

Nations that act like old Rome , fall like  old Rome.

The people who do not want a wall live in gated communities , behind reality.
The left wants globalism. Keep people poor and on welfare, that way they will always vote democratic.
