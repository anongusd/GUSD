If we were concerned about his hypocrisy when he said buy American during the campaign... it would've seemed problematic because most of his products... have been made in China, Bangladesh... #AMJoy https://t.co/3KFIjUd6GG
.@AmandiOnAir-I think we have to look past this issue of hypocrisy &amp; bad faith &amp; perhaps at something more sinister... I think #Trump is so dogged on this issue simply because it's another way to divide Americans... #Immigration has become a wedge issue in U.S. &amp; the world #AMJoy https://t.co/T0LFnuVokZ
.@MariaTeresa1: The crux of the issue is not whether or not we like [undocumented workers] enough because there is a disdain for the worker but whether or not they should have the rights of individuals, of humans. The president has basically dehumanized these individuals. #AMJoy https://t.co/RnTJEOAdNw

.@JoyAnnReid: #Trump shut the government down for 35 days. The one thing that is true is that he owns it https://t.co/xU7mQ3sjQG via @amjoyshow #GovernmentShutdown
‘The Art of the Deal’ author @tonyschwartz on #Trump: Most deals in the book were failed deals https://t.co/Kls7I1u3us via @amjoyshow #GovernmentShutdown

.@NunbergSam, former #Trump insider, on #RogerStone’s indictment https://t.co/sr977JDhPj via @amjoyshow
.@donnabrazile: This is a historic year for Democratic party. We have a record number of candidates. We know they're out &amp; about across this country. Is America ready [for a woman president]? Absolutely. Will it happen in our lifetime? Absolutely. Could it happen in 2020? Yes. https://t.co/izKORNUZtp
.@BarbMcQuade: When I was U.S. attorney we prosecuted street gangs for threats they made on social media about people who were rats... The fact that #RudyGiuliani and President #Trump are saying this out publicly does not in any way minimize the criminality of it. #AMJoy https://t.co/789sTtEHOg
.@MalcolmNance: I have never heard of a person ever editing their SF-86 security form like Jared Kushner did with over 100 modifications. Because anyone who modified their clearance application form once had their clearance pulled and they were never given access. #AMJoy https://t.co/aCt3EPWYIA

.@tonyschwartz: #Trump's a terrible negotiator. And actually always has been. Go back to "The Art of the Deal," which was a title I came up with... as a marketing message not as an actual expression of reality... Most of the deals in "The Art of the Deal" were failed deals #AMJoy https://t.co/DbvvtNLkr0
.@NunbergSam: I think that #RogerStone and #DonaldTrump are very similar... I think both will fight towards the end. Roger's the types of person where he would think, "I'll do a year in jail, and I come out and give speeches." #AMJoy https://t.co/ymEBxmgb5I
.@mayawiley: It was not funny to Randy Credico at all. If you think about mob tactics where people kill animals and leave them on your doorstep... It was clear that it was not funny to him.

.@EJDionne: If #Trump puts out something that vaguely resembles sort of, kind of a proposal, he gets way more credit for it than any other president Republican or Democrat would get because the expectations of him are down to zero. #AMJoy https://t.co/hh5QRDG0uE
.@EricBoehlert: If you watch Fox News, they're not even that excited about [the wall]. They were way more hysterical about Benghazi, Hillary's emails. They don't like playing defense. They feel they have to do it. It's not a burning desire among this base. #AMJoy https://t.co/GvKhywja5G
.@kurtbardella: Coulter loses her mind on Twitter we wake up this morning &amp; a different #Trump is tweeting something very different from what he said a day ago. How could anyone expect to negotiate w/anyone who changes their mind on the whim of co-President Ann Coulter? #AMJoy https://t.co/U5MRd8XXls
.@MsTaraDowdell: #Trump negotiates &amp; operates in bad faith. One important thing to note is just because he's offered this deal, even if Dems take this bad deal, we don't know that he would stand by this deal because he has a history of not standing by deals he's put forth. #AMJoy https://t.co/eRcNh4DHF4

.@SenJeffMerkley: They adopted a strategy of hurting children as a strategy of deterrence. That is a political strategy. This memo speaks to that... It lays it out just as it was implemented by the administration. #AMJoy #Immigration https://t.co/d5FCmCJDyg
.@perrybaconjr: Yesterday was about Republicans &amp; #Trump. They're nervous about the strategy so #Trump finally gave them some kind of bill they can call a compromise so they can bring it to the floor, vote on it, Democrats can block it &amp; that's what Mitch McConnell wanted. #AMJoy https://t.co/H4Z1yHsKDg
.@NatashaBertrand: #Trump does not really care about the wall... I think that he sees the walls closing in on him [related to] the #Mueller investigation. And guess how else is effected by this #GovernmentShutdown? Prosecutors who are investigating him. #AMJoy https://t.co/moboPox6s2
.@jacobsoboroff: The exception to the rule is drugs that come between ports of entry. I have seen it with my own eyes.

Rep. @ericswalwell: If #Trump really wants border security he will get that. I don't think that's what this is really about. I think the last thing Trump cares about is actually having a wall. I think this is about the other walls that are closing in around him... #AMJoy https://t.co/05A4MCkIN6
Rep. @ericswalwell: It was pretty hard to watch FBI, uniformed police officers, standing in line to get a dinner because they're working so hard, so bravely &amp; not getting paid... one leaned into me as I was serving a chicken sandwich &amp; soup &amp; asked for 2 more for her kids. #AMJoy https://t.co/VYzJy8tJJU

.@DrJasonJohnson: Dems are just as dug in on this issue as Republicans. Pelosi's popularity has gone up since this happened. She's more popular than #Trump. She's more popular than Brian Kemp in GA. She's more popular... because she has stood her ground #AMJoy #GovernmentShutdown https://t.co/iOhHyqrIFV
.@AmandiOnAir: I'll give Speaker Pelosi what I think is some free advice... they should take the [reported] deal w/one caveat. Add to the mix that in exchange for 5 billion for the wall &amp; the extension of DACA protections, the president release his tax returns immediately. #AMJoy https://t.co/aWG7HU4k8i

.@mayawiley: This #DonaldTrump-created crisis of a wall, purportedly for the protection of the United States, has led to the greatest vulnerability of the United States to the very drug cartels he suggests we need a wall for because DEA agents cannot pay their informants. #AMJoy https://t.co/T9r9hrYdqY
.@K_JeanPierre: We are the wealthiest nation on earth. And we have people waiting on a pay check. And something that #DonaldTrump created. But Mitch McConnell is allowing this to happen. It is infuriating. #AMJoy https://t.co/HQ4OEBrzgI
.@ElieNYC: People keep truncating the impeachment clause to you can be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. That's not what is says. It says you can be impeached for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. #AMJoy https://t.co/RaQul3qfxC
.@Mimirocah1: Increasingly in my mind it points to some kind of quid pro quo between #Trump &amp; Putin. In exchange for the Moscow tower, going easy on Russia &amp; sanctions... We have to wait until all the facts are out... that's the warning sign the past 24 hours have given us #AMJoy https://t.co/5lbcr2FITi
.@sarahkendzior: #Trump's relationship with Russia goes back 30 years as do his political ambitions. He nearly ran for president in 1988. In 1996. He ran in 2000. He ran in 2012, and he ran again in 2016. That's not a political neophyte. #AMJoy https://t.co/x7fV1MuCAl

.@DavidCayJ: #Trump thinks that because he's used politicians by his own account to shutdown inquiries into himself or get policies changed -- he thinks getting rid of #Comey would stop the FBI. It goes to Donald's complete incompetence. #AMJoy https://t.co/9ESpZPxYpI
.@MattWelch-Lindsey Graham yesterday I think really disgraced himself in a fundamental way... He said please shutdown government to build the wall.

Great job getting us trending #reiders! Can we get our #AMJoy hashtag higher? Let's do it! #AMJoy... #AMJoy... #AMJoy... https://t.co/6Q3YuHe03m
.@DavidCayJ: #Trump has no sense of history. He has no moral core of any kind... In his mind so long as Donald wins no rules apply... it doesn't matter whether it's getting money from someone, being elected president, getting a wall built. That's all that matters. #AMJoy https://t.co/yYSqNgl6IS
.@TheRickWilson: ...#Trump's post-election behavior towards Russia has raised not just a few red flags but a whole sea of red flags. I think their responses are so insufficient politically and certainly legally... it doesn't seem these folks have got their message together #AMJoy https://t.co/302T3bqEXZ

.@SenTaylor: What the Republicans have done is take power from the judicial branch through the attorney general &amp; given it to the legislature. They've also done the same thing in taking power from the governor... This power grab is an imbalance. #AMJoy #Wisconsin https://t.co/jS8ArAjwsz
.@McCreadyForNC: This really is not about me. It's not even about Mark Harris. This is much bigger than one single election. This is about people whose voices were taken from them. People whose voices were silenced. Your vote is your voice in our democracy. #AMJoy #NorthCarolina https://t.co/877fkdYSFo
.@McCreadyForNC: What is amazing here is that my opponent Mark Harris went out and hired this known criminal McCrae Dowless who was under investigation for absentee ballot fraud to run his absentee ballot program amidst all of these allegations. #AMJoy https://t.co/Op6aPvLlFl
.@MichelleBernard: I don't see how you can say #JohnKelly did anything positive while he was the president's chief of staff... I think if anything it's shown us you can go into this administration with a good reputation and leave absolutely destroyed #AMJoy https://t.co/uf2hzMli1G
.@JRubinBlogger: #JohnKelly quite frankly has been very helpful at all. He hasn't restrained the president in any meaningful way... I don't think it's going to make that much difference in the overall functioning of the White House because #Trump remains #AMJoy https://t.co/J1M8vyYnZd
.@NatashaBertrand: #WilliamBarr actually interviewed to be the president's defense lawyer last year as part of this Russia investigation. That is a huge piece of this. #Trump obviously knows where he stands on certain issues. #AMJoy https://t.co/ZJZeC2xjQm
.@NatashaBertrand: #Mueller is laying the groundwork to investigate #Trump's businesses as a potential linchpin between his relationship with Russia during the campaign and whether he had any involvement in Russia's election interference. #AMJoy https://t.co/I7og34P9Lb
.@TimOBrien: There's a very substantial fact pattern through the raft of sentencing memos... #Trump wasn't an innocent bystander here. At minimum he could wind up an unindicted co-conspirator. The fact you see laid out in these documents is he's orchestrating a lot of this #AMJoy https://t.co/3yaEzu4fl7
.@nickakerman: First of all #Trump admits he didn't read the #Mueller filing which absolutely puts him right into the middle of the conspiracy between the Russian government and the campaign. The same one 13 Russian intelligence operatives have already been charged with. #AMJoy https://t.co/JABxuvcUiS

.@DavidCornDC: I used to work with #HeatherNauert and do TV spots with her. She's very pleasant, very nice. But I don't see her as having the foundation that you usually want in a U.N. ambassador... these are people who know foreign policy, they know history. #AMJoy https://t.co/AVfEB1cbOr

.@BarbMcQuade: The promise of a business deal that could profit hundreds of millions is classic espionage dangle... from sophisticated espionage agents like Russians, to reach out &amp; find what someone wants most.

.@LawProfButler: Why would #Manafort want to violate his cooperation agreement? He had the deal of the century. This is a man who's 70-years-old. He was looking at 10 years in prison. #Mueller says all you've got to do is come clean and I'm going to give you a break. #AMJoy https://t.co/UzCS5NVFDq
Special Counsel: #Manafort's Lies #AMJoy https://t.co/uQA1szR3QV
.@CynthiaAlksne-[On Manafort's double-dealing,] when did #Mueller people find out? If they found out in time did they do anything about it? Since they knew he was feeding information to other people did they feed information that affected #Trump's answers to his questions? #AMJoy https://t.co/XaQVFpm7LQ
.@mayawiley: Trump fired #Comey and publicly stated it was because he had the #Mueller investigation on his mind... In addition to high crimes and misdemeanors abuse of authority is a ground for impeachment. And #Trump has clearly abused his authority. #AMJoy https://t.co/Iy2qxY02hE
.@LawProfButler: ...the U.S. Dept. of Justice said yesterday in filings the president #DonaldTrump is a criminal. If he were not president of the U.S. he would be under federal criminal indictment today. The constitutional remedy is impeachment... #AMJoy https://t.co/CXdXpBZTJS

.@JEWDYGOLD: You have to have a sense of self-awareness in order to get a joke. You have to have some sort of intelligence to understand the intent of a joke, which #Trump does not have. #AMJoy https://t.co/OaFD9jMCQu
.@DEANOBEIDALLAH: Freedom of expression is so important to our democracy. You know how freedom of expression first gets eroded? Not by laws or executive orders. It's self-censorship. That's what the White House Correspondents' Association looks like it is doing. #AMJoy https://t.co/UXsNyB2haS
.@K_JEANPIERRE: On election night #Mississippi was supposed to be in the bag for Republicans... We were not supposed to be in a run-off. What's happening because there is a run-off with #MikeEspy is Cindy Hyde-Smith is [apparently] doubling down on being Trumpian #AMJoy https://t.co/P4YAZlsGtI

.@REVDRBARBER: 52% of Mississippians are poor. That's 1.5 million people. Hyde-Smith jokes about hangings... but she simply wants to give more tax cuts to the wealthy. That's not going to help poor Mississippians...  #AMJoy https://t.co/r3rFmSGDnV

.@DAVIDCAYJ: #DonaldTrump is also, let's remember, highly gullible. Oh, Putin says he didn't interfere? Then he didn't interfere. [#Saudi Crown Prince] MBS and his staff say, "we didn't do it"? Then they didn't do it. His gullibility is extraordinary. #AMJoy https://t.co/c3iKiZumOX

.@willpowerpacker: When you talk about jobs &amp; impacting real people why would you spurn an industry that brings that kind of work?

.@GovHowardDean: Republicans... fail to stand up to a man who is clearly unfit to be president of the United States, because of the fears for their own political careers. They have sold America out. The Republican party has become a drag on the greatness of America. #AMJoy https://t.co/sdoos1CMHt
.@JohnJHarwood: The ecosystem #Trump leads as a Republican president and leader of the Republican party is out of touch with reality. That's why you see a political campaign where most of the arguments they are making about immigration, taxes, and healthcare are false. #AMJoy https://t.co/TVr5TvPrJa
.@JillWineBanks: #Trump has no comprehension of the danger his words have caused... It's time for us to hold him accountable for what he is saying... He is completely narcissistic &amp; makes everything about himself instead of having empathy for those who've been threatened. #AMJoy https://t.co/LfIbboHzzh
.@MalcolmNance: He has no interest in being president. He's not worthy of the title... This nation sustained a terrorist mail bombing campaign...

.@K_JeanPierre: I said that this is #Trump's America. It doesn't have to be #Trump's America. I think in 17 days we can really clap back &amp; say no to all of this. We do have the power. We just have to exercise it &amp; vote. We have to make sure we as Democrats stay on message #AMJoy https://t.co/jHdOEXX4yA

.@MARIA_HINOJOSA: When women are saying "I remember now" there's an element of distrust. For me it's a horrible moment in our country and a historic moment because we're not being quiet. This is not partisan, this is women, actually allowing ourselves to name it what it is #AMJoy https://t.co/y8nBV3tNwu
.@EJDIONNE: #DrFord is someone who voluntarily came forward knowing the kind of grief she would take for doing so... Republicans are trying to say to their moderates... this isn't about ideology... But there is #MikePence right there saying no this *is* about ideology. #AMJoy https://t.co/bneNUBgx2c
.@VANITAGUPTACR: #Kavanaugh has no basis for resisting these questions. It would be utterly hypocritical of him given his role in pushing for some of the most sexually explicit questions back the Ken Starr investigation... Where his history is in question--it is fair game. #AMJoy https://t.co/TzYsmd02Os
.@EJDIONNE: It's absurd that #MarkJudge is not called to testify under oath. Right now he's put out a statement supporting Judge #Kavanaugh, but there's no way he's being asked to defend that statement under oath. I think they're entitled to that testimony. #AMJoy https://t.co/rjPJEJ1Vxi

#Kavanaugh accuser conditionally accepts GOP offer to testify this week https://t.co/wSml5Kvymf via @nbcnews
.@TARANABURKE: Last year you had millions of people who hashtagged #MeToo. If you compare the number of people who said #MeToo to the number of people who report sexual violence every year you can see the deep disparity. There are so many reasons people don't report #AMJoy https://t.co/iDWwoJvHxo
.@MAYAWILEY: What happens if #Mueller is gone I think is that Republicans get to drive the end of the investigation. That will create a significant public outcry and rightfully so given the number of indictments #Mueller has gotten. #AMJoy https://t.co/yOisC3HtT2
.@MALCOLMNANCE: It doesn't matter how it was written. This is going to be the anvil on which the hammer of #Trump's base is going to destroy the Justice Department... This is just going to damage us. I don't know how badly things are going to turn out here. #AMJoy #RodRosenstein https://t.co/6KRLRAX9fw
.@DRJASONJOHNSON: This notion... that we have to wait for some sort of public performance in order to believe this woman could all be solved if there was actually an FBI investigation, which this president and the Republicans on the committee refuse to do. #AMJoy https://t.co/Qoblq5HC2c
.@SYKESCHARLIE: This is not collective guilt. This is #BrettKavanaugh. Either he did this or he did not do this. This is a factual situation. Which is why it is a good idea to reopen the FBI background check. #AMJoy https://t.co/DN2ypcuwA1
.@DAVIDBROCKDC-I'm not talking all conservatives. We're talking elite GOP circles in DC. There's a mindset that you can lie to outsiders… What happened to #AnitaHill was horrible. What is going to happen to Dr. Ford  I think will be horrible. But the real issue is perjury #AMJoy https://t.co/CCt5b6BWGY
.@SYKESCHARLIE: The real variable here is not necessarily gender it's stupidity and it's insensitivity. And those comments have a high potential for backlash. But both parties have to be aware of the optics here and the way they handle the questioning. #AMJoy #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/rKcP89lQRT

.@DAVIDBROCKDC: They didn't say that #AnitaHill was just flat out lying because there you need a motive... There was a theory floated about Anita Hill called erotomania, that she had some kind of mad crush on Clarence Thomas. You're going to start hearing all these things. #AMJoy https://t.co/Fq1typhR8e
.@DAVIDBROCKDC: There are a number of things that Dr. Ford is going to face that are more challenging. One, there is no FBI investigation. There was with #AnitaHill. There were witnesses we did not hear from on the record to the FBI who were substantiating her allegations #AMJoy https://t.co/mZ2z89JYaW
.@LAWPROFBUTLER-I've known #Rosenstein for 20 years. He has a wry sense of humor. Maybe this was a joke. The 25th amendment stuff on the other hand... When Times asked #Rosenstein did you say we have to invoke the 25th to get rid of #Trump he gave a weird nondenial, denial #AMJoy https://t.co/WGPYEAxN6v
.@ELIENYC-Why was #RodRosenstein joking? He should be wearing a wire. They all should be wearing a wire... Every single thing #Trump says should be recorded by people who want to protect themselves.

.@DEGGANS-It reminds me of a bit of what happened to #TrayvonMartin... when you have a deadly event like this where there are only 2 witnesses, the person killed &amp; the one who killed them there's a media rush to get any detail people think may have bearing on what happened #AMJoy https://t.co/wbRVjCoglY

.@AnandWrites and @JoyAnnReid just discussed his new book → https://t.co/TQz57Cchuc #AMJoy
.@kurtbardella: I think it's important that we find out who this author is, because if they are part of what would be the line of succession you could make the case that something more nefarious is going on here. And the American people frankly have a right to know. #AMJoy https://t.co/1h6WUKCZ7r
.@ZerlinaMaxwell: I do think that George Papadopoulos is right in saying that his testimony was a part of the building blocks that the prosecutors are putting together to make the case... The idea that there's no collusion is B.S. There is ample evidence of collusion... #AMJoy https://t.co/xifWMnYfE3
.@EricBoehlert: I think the crack in the wall in their base may be if some of them start to believe he is senile. #Trump can be as racist as he wants, as misinformed as he wants. I think if some of them think he's not all there mentally, then they start to crumble... #AMJoy https://t.co/LuPnkxxyJ1
.@sarahkendzior: The most dangerous thing we face right now is the emergence of a one-party state that feels that it's above the law. #AMJoy https://t.co/7IeRLOEpBA
.@gabrielsherman: When #Trump hired him Bill Shine had no communications experience... He was Roger Ailes' lackey... It's not surprising he doesn't have a strategic plan to improve the way #Trump looks other than improving the back lighting on some of his TV hits #AMJoy https://t.co/SuDAlj8Wei
.@kurtbardella: Williams stood there poised... &amp; tried to do everything she could for Osaka &amp; for the sport that she belongs to... She knew she would be the subject of unfair, sexist comparisons &amp; she kept it together &amp; embodied exactly what you would want from a champion #AMJoy https://t.co/lAhwtLgg9c
.@JamilSmith: I'm just trying to imagine Tom Brady being penalized for yelling at a ref and having the ref put three points on the board for the other team. That's essentially what happened here. #AMJoy https://t.co/2z3vczfqWV
.@ZerlinaMaxwell: I've been watching tennis my entire life. I have never, ever seen what happened yesterday to Serena Williams in tennis... I would say there were 3 violations this umpire decided &amp; chose to call against Williams. Two of them were arbitrary &amp; I think wrong. #AMJoy https://t.co/S08zpLK3OO

.@rossacrosswi: The question is, is Scott Walker is running this scorched earth campaign because the voters are finally done with Scott Walker? For a guy who ran twice for state office before he could legally rent a car, has the political road come to an end? #AMJoy https://t.co/zWHSosru0K
.@NatashaBertrand: I think that one of the biggest takeaways from this book ["Fear: #Trump in the White House"] ... is that people are really out to save themselves when this is all over. The leaks coming out of this White House are not an accident. #AMJoy https://t.co/F0rX9BaGYk
.@TimOBrien: The whole notion that his team has come out with, that it is horrendous to use anonymous sources, grotesque to put things on the record anonymously--#Trump is a 72-year-old-man who has spent the last five decades anonymously leaking gossip and negative info... #AMJoy https://t.co/vgXrXEgaiQ
Rep. @tedlieu: ...The way our Constitution is set up it is not for a staff member to be a check &amp; balance on president. It is for Congress. Unfortunately the GOP in Congress has been complicit for too long. Voters this Nov. can make a choice on if they want to change that. #AMJoy https://t.co/8iQy9jQmOI
Read the opinion by @davidbrockdc → The #BrettKavanaugh I knew shouldn't sit on the Supreme Court https://t.co/f9drkOu06b via @NBCNewsTHINK #AMJoy #SCOTUS
.@davidbrockdc-My piece is about #BrettKavanaugh's behavior... behaving as a political partisan while a prosecutor while he's supposed to be a dispassionate arbiter of facts... I think it shows really poor behavior for what you would want in a Supreme Court Justice #AMJoy #SCOTUS https://t.co/cZR1Qcqwi1
.@davidbrockdc-I knew #BrettKavanaugh as a partisan warrior. His representation of himself now in black robes is just now who he is. I know who he was... just like we were, he was engaged in partisan politics, partisan war. He is in his bones a Republican operative #AMJoy #SCOTUS https://t.co/FY5Bx2YrTy
.@davidbrockdc: When I saw that #BrettKavanaugh described himself as a neutral arbiter, stressing his independence, and saying he's an umpire--I know he's no umpire. He's straight out of right field. #SCOTUS #AMJoy https://t.co/vX09VLvVKx

.@DeanObeidallah: My greatest push back on this article is the idea that "they're the resistance." No, no, no. WE are the resistance. We oppose everything this man has done. #AMJoy #NYTimesOpEd https://t.co/teukWZ6DGI
.@MsTaraDowdell: #Trump has been watching these autocrats. He admires them. He is emulating their behavior. So it is more damaging for this person to behave the way they're behaving by being anonymous because it gives him something to latch onto to start to do these things #AMJoy https://t.co/SOUIQtDbOu
.@matthewamiller: I think that the much more responsible course of action would be for people to come forward in high-profile resignations and say what they've seen on the inside. If one person does it, you might see more people come forward. #AMJoy #NYTimesOpEd https://t.co/f3L4HZjfRY
.@JillWineBanks-There are many indicators there was a conspiracy going on. This is one piece of it where you have someone who had knowledge, was willing to share it &amp; willing to set up a meeting. It doesn't take actually carrying out that meeting for it to be conspiracy... #AMJoy https://t.co/Eu5Ot0N8ka

.@JillWineBanks: As a lawyer I would like to see the evidence that @KamalaHarris has and confront him with it and make him answer it in light of the evidence. That way you really have a provable case against him. #AMJoy #BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/KoDCUJF32R
.@MsTaraDowdell: #Obama is the hero Gotham needs right now. And #DonaldTrump... is like Bane in "The Dark Knight Rises"... Dividing people, pitting people against one another. So there is no starker contrast between #Trump and President Barack Obama. #AMJoy https://t.co/Bx9l7SEM0f
.@DeanObeidallah: Congress is mandated by the Constitution to be a check on the president... 59 days from today is judgement day for our nation... If you want a Congress that's going to do their job, be a check on #DonaldTrump... vote Democratic on Nov. 6... #AMJoy https://t.co/oDaQXf8F3W

.@BPSHOW: If there's any civil war it's in the Republican party. We saw that on full display at the National Cathedral yesterday... This is no longer the Hillary versus Bernie thing... The party has a resurgence &amp; a life today particularly on the left that is very striking #AMJoy https://t.co/rQqgxfvPXR
.@ERICBOEHLERT: A couple of weeks ago a @nytimes front page story had the basic premise that there's too much passion and energy in the Democratic base and this is going to hurt them in November. If you go back to 2010 the Tea Party was not depicted as a problem. #AMJoy https://t.co/wvO2vMZd9z
.@SIFILL_LDF: I cannot imagine a more volatile and important moment and time for the United States Senate many of whom were present at John McCain's funeral yesterday to stand for what McCain most recently stood for which was a return to regular order. #AMJoy #BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/ZfOi8zyQcv
.@SIFILL_LDF: What do these documents say? What are they trying to hide? The period involved is important period. It's certainly a period in which #BrettKavanaugh was involved in selecting judicial nominees. Maybe very controversial judicial nominees like Charles Pickering #AMJoy https://t.co/w1hVt4ynYw
.@MICHELLEBERNARD: I do believe that yesterday's funeral was a rallying call. I believe it was the beginning of a movement that says to Americans black and white, male and female, Republican and Democrat, follow in the steps of John McCain not of #DonaldTrump. #AMJoy https://t.co/2bX8QksohT
.@ANANDWRITES: I wonder why we wait for a funeral to have some of this speaking truth to power... It's wonderful to talk about the president by subtweet in a eulogy. I'd like some of the people who gave those eulogies to lead movements right now. To be out in the streets. #AMJoy https://t.co/uGBxTlz9nX
.@MICHAELSTEELE: What the Democratic party has done at the state level is gotten out of its own way and allowed candidates to emerge who can speak to a broader population of voters that better reflect who they are, and what they believe, and what they value. #AMJoy https://t.co/gtw2aVuMh3
.@CAPEHARTJ: The way @AndrewGillum speaks is the way a lot of Democrats are speaking around the country and that is to show that healthcare, jobs safety and security, and regular old security from gun violence--those aren't progressive issues. Those aren't far left issues. #AMJoy https://t.co/bizgEG9tHc
.@ANDREWGILLUM: We call on Ron DeSantis to escalate this dialogue to a level where we can have a decent exchange of ideas.

.@JillWineBanks: #Trump has done so many things in plain sight I can only imagine how much more damning information #Mueller's team has.

.@JoeConason: He voted to impeach Bill Clinton and yet he became friends not only with Hillary Clinton but Bill Clinton, came to the Clinton Global Initiative when he was running for president, and praised Clinton's work. John McCain was an extraordinary person. #AMJoy https://t.co/3QnC6puLTH
.@JoyceWhiteVance: It came about a year too late, but I'm glad that those words finally came out of his mouth, because it is now the people in the Justice Department upholding the rule of law. What happens if #Trump gets to replace #Sessions? https://t.co/OjGZx3kQmT
.@EJDionne: #Trump probably figures that he can get away with this for quite a while. I think #Trump's message is keep things rolling, hope something turns up, hope your enemies make a mistake, and try to get away with as much as you can. #AMJoy https://t.co/omeKv5lBIM

.@TIMJACOBWISE: I don't see this tweet as being about South Africa at all. I think it is a way to try to scare white Americans, not of black South Africans... but of black people here in this country. It's all part of a larger political process #AMJoy https://t.co/Gk3vfXyNLD
.@RANDALPINKETT: There is some saving grace for Omarosa having gone out of the matrix. We do have some insights that we otherwise wouldn't have. To the extent that they already have and will continue to try to discredit her it is a good thing that she has evidence... #AMJoy https://t.co/R1lis5uzA1

Thanks for getting us #trending #reiders! Stay tuned to #AMJoy for even more amazing insights into the #Trump White House and @JoyAnnReid’s discussion with @Omarosa. #AMJoy… #AMJoy… #AMJoy… https://t.co/uhOzTSBPis
.@OMAROSA: I could have quit in protest but then there would be a void of a voice, someone to advocate for us. Right now in the White House there is no African-American representation. No African-American senior staffers. No African-American assistants to the president #AMJoy https://t.co/qmIKvFn0yd
.@OMAROSA: Steve Bannon explained very clearly that he was a proud white man... It's actually scary in some ways for Bannon to not see how the alignment with white supremacists and the alt-right is harming this nation and very fabric of who we are and what we're built on #AMJoy https://t.co/FhcDUDw9JS
.@OMAROSA: I am sad to see Cohen going through what he's going through... I am saddened moreover to see #Trump kick Cohen while he's down while praising Paul Manafort. Cohen did everything he was asked to do. He was directed to make those payments. He was completely loyal #AMJoy https://t.co/eoDyMcRcxZ
.@OMAROSA: [In #Trump] I see a person who conned his way into the White House and is trying to use his limited intellect to fool people #AMJoy https://t.co/zjh5qDsKNz
.@OMAROSA joins #AMJoy on #Trump: https://t.co/9pHDTtIRZa
.@CRAIGUNGER: I think it's very deeply disturbing when you have Russian mobsters laundering money through #Trump-branded properties, living in Trump-branded properties, and they are living in the home of the president of the United States #AMJoy https://t.co/WG2ePlc7aS
.@CRAIGUNGER: #Trump always said he had no contacts with Russia. I found  at least 59 over 35 years and many, many of them were tied to the Russian mafia. #AMJoy https://t.co/lPRSNsSORr
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: Those 19 Russians who were indicted -- #Mueller says that they actively conspired not just in some vague way to subvert democracy but to put #DonaldTrump in the White House #AMJoy https://t.co/gB8dqrNU04
.@MichaelAvenatti: I am highly confident that in coming weeks we are going to negotiate a resolution with #MichaelCohen related to the civil litigation that we have with him... cooperat[ing] with me in our attempts to get to the truth and bring #Trump to justice #AMJoy https://t.co/yJzdljteAN
.@MichaelAvenatti: I don't care if you're on the right, or the center, or where you line up politically we cannot have a system in which people that are seeking the highest office in the land are lying to the American public #AMJoy https://t.co/GH7dS5Ri1n
.@DEANOBEIDALLAH: This is a crime [allegedly about] to how the man got elected... I think it's a very powerful argument to say even though the DOJ says as a general principle you cannot indict a sitting president in this case extraordinary circumstances are present #AMJoy https://t.co/rWBO63Akxa
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: The bigger endgame is called #DonJr. It's called #Jared. It's called #Ivanka. That will give the prosecutor leverage over the president. A deal could be made. Resign. Don't run for re-election. And we'll leave the kids alone. #AMJoy https://t.co/BBL6XWyc2z
.@MAYAWILEY: The cloak over the presidency is essentially the Department of Justice memorandum, which legal scholars debate, that the president cannot be indicted while sitting in office. It has not been tested. I would agree with the legal scholars that say, "says who?" #AMJoy https://t.co/e8R73TfW3g
.@ELIENYC: Trump seems to think that he's above the law. But, most mammals will sacrifice themselves to protect their children. What the prosecutors are about to find out is whether or not #Trump is above the laws of nature. #AMJoy https://t.co/ZJMOkL3hmG

.@RWPUSA: It is time for U.S. House &amp; Senate to convene hearings with Judiciary Committee to remove #Trump. He &amp; people working for him are very dangerous... Just look at the speeches given by Hitler in the '30s &amp; compare to their rhetoric. You'll see exactly what I mean. #AMJoy https://t.co/VvdW1oJRgw
.@EJDIONNE: #BrettKavanaugh is the obvious pick for President #Trump who wants to [allegedly] stack the deck at the #SupremeCourt. Why does he want to stack the deck [allegedly] ? Because #RobertMueller might have to go to #SCOTUS to get evidence from the president... #AMJoy https://t.co/RHsNsqdEGE
.@K_JEANPIERRE: Everything is one the line. We cannot take that lightly. Democrats need to do more. They need to talk about this more. We are not hearing about #Kavanaugh at all being #Trump's #SupremeCourt justice pick and how they are moving forward so quickly #AMJoy https://t.co/QsgmVJ4RZj
.@EJDIONNE: The Republicans in the Senate are not being very forthcoming about making all of Judge Kavanaugh's White House record under President Bush available. When Elena Kagan was nominated the Republicans demanded and got just about everything #AMJoy #SCOTUS #SundayMorning https://t.co/h0pnL04z0W
.@ERICBOEHLERT: [Republican leaders] are giving #Trump the green light to engage in this authoritarian action. We've never seen a president go after the press like this. The press has got to do something. We are in radical times. There has to be radical change. #AMJoy https://t.co/IwUzvMdywF
.@GABRIELSHERMAN: I can speak from personal experience having reported on #Trump's rally several weeks ago... being in that fenced-in press area and being surrounded by thousands of his most zealous followers, and the hatred and the vitriol directed at members of the press #AMJoy https://t.co/nGRoGu4JLU
.@RWPUSA: As for @KellyannePolls you need only look at her own husband's Twitter page to find out what he thinks of the man she's working for... these people lie... Congress needs to wake up &amp; do its job as set forth in the #impeachment clause of the Constitution... #AMJoy https://t.co/mHZ5SEww34
.@MADISONSIRIUSXM: This came out because there was a meeting in Mississippi. @Clyburn said he wouldn't challenge @NancyPelosi but in case she didn't have the votes he would put himself in a position. That's 1 of the great things about him. He knows how to count those votes #AMJoy https://t.co/6fDv3AP19w
.@K_JEANPIERRE: We have to win the House in order to have this debate [on @Clyburn vs. @NancyPelosi] ... It's making me really nervous that we're taking our eyes away from the ball ... But I have to say Pelosi was an incredibly successful speaker #AMJoy https://t.co/E38ptrCk8Q
.@MADISONSIRIUSXM: I think most of us in our community think @OMAROSA knew what she was getting into, and she may have in essence sold her soul to the devil. 		The bottom line is... has she not done us a favor in a strange and ironic way in *validating* what we thought? #AMJoy https://t.co/Jw89FYsOes
.@K_JEANPIERRE: We are about one week into @OMAROSA's book tour.		She is literally living rent-free in #Trump's mind.		#AMJoy https://t.co/Za7OCNN7Nb
.@RWPUSA: There is such a thing as objective truth. And those on the extreme left and extreme right have consistently attacked the notion of objective truth. This is the way Hitler talked in his political campaigns... that there is no such thing as objective truth. #AMJoy https://t.co/2Y2YZP9CgX
.@JOYCEWHITEVANCE: If you have to resort to "truth isn't truth," particularly as a lawyer you're in a very dark place. You're in a place where you know your client is in a lot of trouble. #Giuliani #AMJoy https://t.co/yhtMPVKT42
.@NATASHABERTRAND: It's a complete lie that president's son did not know that this was a Russian government effort to provide information about Clinton because the email itself says in black &amp;  white this is part of Russian government's support for #Trump &amp; his campaign. #AMJoy https://t.co/pki2qmGqh2
.@RWPUSA: Russia wanted lifting of the sanctions... When I was in the Bush White House if I had heard of that type of meeting between anyone in the Republican National Committee or any campaign and a Russian national in that situation I would have called the FBI. #AMJoy https://t.co/Rp6tHska4L
.@JOYCEWHITEVANCE: I would have to disagree with #Giuliani... There is a clear federal statute making it illegal to accept a donation intended to influence a U.S. campaign from a foreign citizen. Not a foreign citizen who's part of that government. Simply a foreign citizen #AMJoy https://t.co/uF8dvcKtgS
.@TheRevAl: Is #DonaldTrump in your mind a racist?		@OMAROSA: Yes, Donald Trump is... I think you remember in his campaign he said to [African-Americans], "What do you have to lose?" 		With this White House, we have a lot to lose.		#AMJoy https://t.co/jA4zo5Uemh

.@MATTMACKOWIAK-The president shouldn't be punishing opponents by revoking security clearances... I don't support using the revocation of a security clearance for a political purpose or to change the narrative on cable news which appears to be why he did it, when he did it #AMJoy https://t.co/we7jkmIHwP
.@TOURE: When you talk about, "we are obsessed with race," what we hear is, "I don't want to deal with race. I want to not talk about it. You should not talk about it." That's offensive to us in that you are just not going to deal with it at all. #AMJoy https://t.co/fOeyvnbsID
.@TOURE: This is the king of birtherism. This is the man who is attacking the NFL constantly. This is a man who stands on black people's necks so that he can appear taller to white people. White nationalism and white entitlement were at the basis of #Trump's campaign. #AMJoy https://t.co/9U2mEpnBlb

.@Toure: I have no confusion about why #ColinKaepernick in not in the NFL. They don't like his protests. The core issue is the wrongful killing of blacks by agents of their government. #Kaepernick is morally right with a moral imperative to speak out when he has a platform #AMJoy https://t.co/5seLRJhVdG
.@JRubinBlogger: Sarah Huckabee Sanders... lies. She attacks our free press. No respectable employer should hire her after this term. No university. No news outlet... she has endangered the lives of reporters. That's why she should be shunned. Not harassed. Shunned. #AMJoy https://t.co/SiqU8jDB3H
.@JRubinBlogger: I think it's time that the major news outlets... pen a letter to the president, that we find this abhorrent. That you are physically endangering our reporters. And we will hold you responsible for their safety. I think it's time to put #Trump on notice. #AMJoy https://t.co/OjKZfGVaNB

.@JRubinBlogger: I'd like to remind Mr. #Trump that ruling only says you can't be prosecuted while in office. Before he goes out the door maybe he wants to resign and have Vice President Pence pardon him, because he's going to be prosecutable as soon as he leaves office. #AMJoy https://t.co/uZtmJt8Q5C

.@ConnieSchultz: It is racist. He went after a black athlete again. He attacked a black news man. He went after Maxine Waters again. In each case #Trump refers to their intelligence, calls them stupid, or lower IQ'd. I think it's important that we acknowledge this. #AMJoy https://t.co/1PeT6b1ATE

.@DRJASONJOHNSON: @ScottWalker is in trouble because the president is unpopular. I've always said this. #DonaldTrump can "shoot people on Fifth Avenue," he remains popular, but he is a millstone around the neck of other Republicans in this country. He has no coattails #AMJoy https://t.co/EySB20B6i3

There are a ton of people of color in #Georgia looking for a candidate like herself to inspire them #AMJoy https://t.co/j1XNRKtmHx
.@K_JEANPIERRE: We saw House Republicans vote down funding for states to get more money for election security. They are not going to get any help, so they have to do it themselves... As American people who are going to go and vote we need to know what's going on out there. #AMJoy https://t.co/20kA0Z92Rf
.@MAYAROCKEYMOORE-Integrity of our democracy is increasingly at center of the nation's attention. To not focus on this in terms of how it's undercutting our electoral system... is an egregious oversight. I'm of breed of Democrats who believe we should put it front &amp; center #AMJoy https://t.co/YsVyexWbL4
.@MATTHEWAMILLER: Why did #Trump fire Jim #Comey? Why did he try to push Jeff Sessions out of the way? Why has he tried to push Rod Rosenstein out of the way? You don't have to look closely at his tweets to see why. It's because he wants the investigation to go away #AMJoy https://t.co/G6uaIFEFOp
.@JRUBINBLOGGER: The Republican party used to be the anti-Russia party, in favor of human rights, and opposed to dictators around the world. That has completely flipped &amp; those very same people--I'm not talking about a demographic, I mean the same people--defend #Trump. #AMJoy https://t.co/aVdJ0RsnQz
.@AVIK: What's emerged since [the #TeaParty started] is a lot of concern about demographic change and a support for big government if it supports members of the Tea Party which are generally older white voters but opposition to big government if it helps other people. #AMJoy https://t.co/Y8PbOols0I
.@MALCOLMNANCE on protecting #Midterms2018: Every person needs to understand--their individual vote is securable if they vote early, if they get out there and mobilize other people to vote, and we make it so there is no margin that [#Russian inference] could have an effect #AMJoy https://t.co/t3FLH8ZesI
.@SELECTEDWISDOM: If #Trump is worried about the Democrats winning in November because the #Russians are tipping it towards them, well he is the president of the U.S. He can do something about it if he wants to. I don't know why he has to go on Twitter and cry about it #AMJoy https://t.co/2fEmmmHL61
.@DAVIDCAYJ: Putin's goal is to disrupt &amp; destroy democracy... #Trump knows he is deeply in debt to Russian-speaking interests...

Who is Allen Weisselberg? #AMJoy https://t.co/C69OdI9phH
.@DAVIDCAYJ: Allen Weisselberg's involvement with #Trump family goes back to when Fred was running the Trump organization. Let's not forget that Fred's business partner was Willie Tomasello identified by law enforcement as a front for the Gambino &amp; Genovese mafia families #AMJoy https://t.co/lUIpXfGUNc
.@NAYYEROAR: #Trump is getting down into the weeds of even what a press release says and trying to control his own narrative to the point where it's his ego rather than the facts that are taking over everything. Ultimately that ego is going to be his downfall. #AMJoy https://t.co/aIr3AF19Ck
.@NICKAKERMAN: In a lot of ways #Cohen is corroborated right down the line with what happened. It's not like this is some incident that was taken out of nowhere that suddenly we think #Trump knew about this meeting. I think it was pretty obvious to everybody he had to know #AMJoy https://t.co/eCctJ2nNxy
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: Would #Trump allow his top aides to go to a meeting, his son, son-in-law, campaign chief, and not want to know anything about the meeting especially if it's dirt on Hillary? #AMJoy https://t.co/EcZf0npT1z
.@NAYYEROAR: This overall sense that there is lying and shadiness is starting to affect #Trump in the polls. The Independents who are fundamental to his election are pulling away from him. It's now down to less than 40% support among Independents in Arizona, Ohio and FL. #AMJoy https://t.co/kd8xlFW3Ux

.@LAWPROFBUTLER-Republicans know there's a lot more evidence to support impeachment of #Trump than Rosenstein... We saw the clapback on Friday at that press conference... Rosenstein said when Russians are attacking U.S. there are no Republicans or Dems. We're all Americans #AMJoy https://t.co/PruBM3kVAn
.@NATASHABERTRAND-We're seeing this attack on Strzok which was a 3-ring circus... very personal attacks. Now they are preparing to impeach Rosenstein who just announced the indictments. It seems like they are doing everything they can to put breaks on this investigation... #AMJoy https://t.co/DpROTizpMo
.@ninakhrushcheva: #Trump goes against anything that America has ever stood for... He thinks he's going to get along with #Putin more than his allies... That's what we've seen in Trump in the past 2 years. Whatever we say is wrong, he's going to say it's right. #AMJoy https://t.co/XZ2mYny5sL
.@MCFAUL: The goal of American foreign policy is not to get along with #Putin. Putin is a guy who violated our sovereignty in 2016... Annexed Crimea in 2014... The goal is not to just forget about all those things... #Trump doesn't understand that basic thing of diplomacy. #AMJoy https://t.co/GDfPczYE1z
.@MCFAUL: What is different about #Trump's approach is he just makes the meeting itself and his personal relationship with #Putin the goal. And we have no idea what the substantive agenda is he's trying to achieve. That's what's different about the #Obama era versus now. #AMJoy https://t.co/qDl7oS5PYe

.@GWENDALBLAIR-#Trump can't accept the idea that he's anything except successful. That he's anything except the best... His family was very influenced by Norman Vincent Peale &amp; "The Power of Positive Thinking." He is "The Power of Positive Thinking" squared. Possibly cubed #AMJoy https://t.co/dxjd8lVC2m

.@MILBANK: #Trump long before he was dealing with these 2 leaders had a problem with strong women. The unfortunate thing is this probably doesn't cost him support among his base, undermining our relationship w/Europe in the long-term with intelligence, military cooperation #AMJoy https://t.co/rp4Aakdz2e
.@NAYYEROAR: Theresa May is one of the only female leaders in the world. Rather than propping up women who have faced insurmountable odds... #Trump goes out of his way to do petty things like throwing a Starburst at Merkel &amp; saying, "Don't say I didn't give you anything." #AMJoy https://t.co/rWIjZZ4tal
.@GHOSHWORLD: That clip you showed where #Trump says #Germany is a captive of #Russia. That is especially humiliating for Angela Merkel, a woman who grew up in East Germany. If anyone understands what it is like to be a captive of Russia it's Angela Merkel. #AMJoy https://t.co/A7nHg64jZS

.@SARAHKENDZIOR: I think [the Russians] knew #Trump was very likely to win this election because they've been putting all sorts of things into play to insure that this was possible. This was a multi-year plan. They've been working at this goal for a long time. #AMJoy https://t.co/DvXhfEUXSs
.@NAVEEDAJAMALI: Russians only get into a room with someone for 2 reasons, knowing 2 things about them. 1, that they have something of worth to Russia. 2, the belief that they can fully control that person. I suspect we're going to find people that fit those two bills #AMJoy https://t.co/zji5szQ0YI
.@NICKAKERMAN: There is no way these documents that were so fine-tuned, released at very specific times...

.@GOVHOWARDDEAN: Conviction politics is what the Democrats have lacked other than Obama… the infighting in the Democratic party is inside the Beltway... It’s bupkus… What is going on on the ground is young people taking over the party, running good candidates #AMJoy https://t.co/dLUNvPwsKD
.@MARCUS4AMERICA: Medicare for All is an issue folks are getting galvanized around… In state House races, making sure education is fully funded, and actually saying it instead of assuming that voters will vote for your because they are mad at #DonaldTrump #AMJoy https://t.co/8JAfS7aiHM
#Trump has to do a little more homework to understand what #NATO is and what Nord Stream is. First of all, we're not paying for that Nord Stream 2 pipeline that #Germany is negotiating with Russia... When he says they have never defended us that is just not true #AMJoy https://t.co/nZwUdaHQLk
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: The year I want everyone to think of is 2050. The president is nominating young people in their 40s &amp; 50s who could easily serve to 2050. Joy, you and I could be here in 2050 talking about, “Can you believe what Justice Barrett did today?” #AMJoy https://t.co/p1Td7bpBfg
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: So many crucial issues. #MarriageEquality. Would the Court reverse that? What about the rights of people in the #transgender community? Labor rights. The Court this term dramatically reduced the power of labor unions. It could go further in that direction. #AMJoy https://t.co/sN3jIuSEKs
.@MATTHEWAMILLER: ...I think it would be a break with this principle for #Trump to be able to pick someone to sit on the #SupremeCourt who would weigh in on these very important questions… #AMJoy
.@MATTHEWAMILLER: No one in this country is allowed to pick the people who prosecute them, or investigate them. No one is allowed to pick the judge or jury that sits in judgement of them... #AMJoy https://t.co/bn6wZEV7tE
.@JILLWINEBANKS: ...Ohio has passed a law that says 6 weeks is the limit on when you can get an abortion. Most women do not even know they’re pregnant during that period... to me that is a clear undue burden. To [#SupremeCourt nominee] Amy Coney Barrett that may not be… #AMJoy https://t.co/YH7pD6QWzh
.@MAYAWILEY: Because the Supreme Court has said it’s whether there is an undue burden on your right to access, we’ve essentially created a way for the court to so greatly narrow, to support state laws, that basically make it near-impossible #AMJoy #SupremeCourt https://t.co/gXV5zwHWre

Read the full report by @AURABOGADO and her colleagues --&gt; Defense contractor detained migrant kids in vacant Phoenix office building https://t.co/Z3AlEZjtvP via @reveal
.@AURABOGADO: The video that we’ve seen and the accounts that we’ve heard from neighbors all tell us children including toddlers that weren’t old enough to walk were ushered in there and weren’t seen leaving for as long as three weeks. #AMJoy #ImmigrantChildren https://t.co/nbfD4vPwh7
.@AURABOGADO: Over the course of three weeks they saw dozens of children entering this building, which has just been vacant the month before. It coincides with the exact time that we know children were being separated from their families. #AMJoy #ImmigrantChildren https://t.co/i1agLzNiID
.@ROBERTPJONES: Support for building a wall has dropped 10 percentage points since 2016… we are seeing Republicans becoming more outliers… Democrats &amp; Independents are increasingly closer together &amp; Republicans are increasingly out on their own with #Trump on this issue #AMJoy https://t.co/qkui9GIcT8
.@MARIATERESA1: 60% of Latinos are 33 years old or younger. The mean age of a white voter is 54. The mean age of a Latino voter is 18 years old. The next three years are going to see a tsunami of young Latinos and their potential is untapped #AMJoy https://t.co/4gnBCvu1PV
.@WHITNEYBDOW: #Immigration is not a real issue… we’re at a historic low level of crime. It’s been proven over and over that #immigrants commit crimes at a lower levels… Our drug problem is home grown. It’s an opioid crisis… We need immigrants to power our economy #AMJoy https://t.co/xJiyzvxIK7

.@JRUBINBLOGGER: I am amazed at the ability of #Democrats to screw up a one-car parade. Why in the world would they come out and attack their own? Immediately the conversation has to be this is the most uncivil, racist, misogynistic, president who seeks to divide us #AMJoy https://t.co/GRgQnmDmWV
.@TIFFANYDCROSS: This administration has the courts, the House &amp; Senate. All the American people have is their voice and vote. They need to be using both all the time.

.@DRJASONJOHNSON: And the fact that [@GREGORYKOGER's] idea even if it may not work long term isn’t something that we’ve heard from the mouth of a Democrat in the Senate is indicative of the weakness and fecklessness of the leadership. #AMJoy https://t.co/JCvtn1MtVF
.@DRJASONJOHNSON: Yes, there aren’t a lot of structural ways that Democrats can prevent [#Trump from securing another Supreme Court seat] … But at the end of the day the Democrats have to demonstrate that they are willing to go to the wall to stop this from happening. #AMJoy https://t.co/5RcBn4Ntty

From @DHSgov Fact Sheet: Zero-Tolerance Prosecution and Family Reunification	#AMJoy #Immigration #ImmigrantChildren https://t.co/8LtOUJz7Fl
.@CALNBC: I think it’s a deliberate policy to move children around &amp; to disappear some of these kids &amp; scatter them into the wind. I think this is what the #Trump administration wants. I think they’re watching this right now &amp; they’re pretty pleased about how this has gone #AMJoy https://t.co/4Ls6S7H8E4
.@CALNBC-It’s heartbreaking to be an American &amp; be lied to by the government, to see kids being moved around at night, to hear that a congressman or senator gets into this site &amp; instead of seeing the children they’re shown a CCTV shot &amp; let’s be clear. That’s a black site #AMJoy https://t.co/7WboDbEFdF
.@DoloresHuerta: This surpasses anything we’ve seen before when we see the cruelty behind separation of these families, detention of these families.

.@REPJIMMYGOMEZ: I believe in the phrase you don’t negotiate with legislative terrorists. That’s what he is. That’s what Republicans are.

How far would you go to make sure that you reunited yourself with a child? With your offspring. Your progeny. Your family. #AMJoy https://t.co/ls2GiCEnzH
.@JELANI9-We have been reluctant to take a cold, hard look at what history of U.S. actually is. This is simply the most recent example.

This is a tax-free organization. There are all kinds of rules that simply were not followed #AMJoy https://t.co/ACDATjXnNB
.@TPARSI: This is a guy that's pretty easy to figure out. You can get a much better deal with #Trump just being able to massage his ego and allow him to claim that he had a victory because that's all that matters. It's the image. It's the optics of some form of a victory #AMJoy https://t.co/7XTr6Menso

.@JOHNJHARWOOD: The Republican party has driven itself into a cul-de-sac that does not allow it to keep pace with the way the country is changing...

.@MSTARADOWDELL: #Trump’s strategy is distract, deflect &amp; play the victim. The base feels like they’re victims. Trump reflect that with what he says &amp; does. As you can see the lying is throughout entire administration. It’s not just Trump anymore. This is about messaging #AMJoy https://t.co/baUz05kPmC

They separated Japanese-American citizens calling us infiltrators. We're now animals &amp; therefore can be separated... #AMJoy https://t.co/wYElQ006dR
.@DRJASONJOHNSON: Throwing human beings in cages. This would be wrong to do to POWs. This would be wrong to do to terrorists. And it’s being done to two-year-olds, and three-year-olds, and four-year-olds… This is an abomination that everyone should be ashamed of #AMJoy https://t.co/bbMguJFf7o

I want to say the name of Marco Antonio Muñoz who when his 3-year-old was ripped away from him committed suicide. We have to talk about the trauma being passed down #AMJoy https://t.co/kcvOPydoUL
.@GABRIELSHERMAN: One of #Trump’s earliest influences is Norman Vincent Peale, Power of Positive Thinking. You have #Trump going out &amp; asserting things like our relationship with our allies are great, never been better, they're a 10.... It’s gaslighting on industrial scale #AMJoy https://t.co/6Tb80Iqk6d
.@GABRIELSHERMAN: To dismiss CNN as fake and to delegitimize them on the world stage to me as a journalist and a reporter is incredibly corrosive. To send the message it sends to authoritarian regimes where journalists are imprisoned, sometimes murdered. #AMJoy https://t.co/7vHXX6HJFb
.@LUCYMCBATH: Women are excited. They're mobilizing. Women--we get it done. We're problem-solvers. Women have decided this is the year of the woman. And that we're going to work to have a seat at the table. #AMJoy https://t.co/gTtDZn1v3p
.@DRJASONJOHNSON: The president of the United States simultaneously always sees himself as a victim but seems to perpetuate the kinds of conflicts that make other countries not want to work with us. That's one of the biggest problems we've got leaving the #G7Summit #AMJoy https://t.co/tdE7XvOEbe

.@NATASHABERTRAND: One concern that I've been seeing is that #Trump won't want to blow up two summits in a row. Is that going to give Kim Jong-un more leverage as Trump walks into this summit because he's going to want some kind of victory after being the pariah of the G7? #AMJoy https://t.co/d6nNRbAh3w
.@MILBANK: Think about the surreal situation of our president making nice with North Korea and then having a war of words and then possibly setting off a trade war with of all countries Canada which has done nothing hostile to us in its history except maybe Justin Bieber #AMJoy https://t.co/JdT8U3A88j
.@FRANKFIGLIUZZI1: When you see #Trump ask for Russia to rejoin G7, when you see his confusing relationship with Putin, you must wonder whether our allies are going to tell our intelligence services we're not sharing intel on Russia or China because we no longer trust you #AMJoy https://t.co/qluKNh3vTL
.@MASHAGESSEN-#Trump wants to get the Nobel Peace Prize which is what's motivating him... It is not anything that would normally motivate a president in a situation like this. I can't believe we are even talking about it as if it were diplomacy. It is not #AMJoy #NorthKoreaSummit https://t.co/Zw7zqaeNgN
.@CIRINCIONE: I don't know about you but I don't want to be touched &amp; felt by #Trump in any way. Can we separate out what he did in Quebec from what he might be doing in Singapore? I with Christine share the optimism that we might be able at long last to end this conflict #AMJoy https://t.co/NQBoJBguT7

.@LINDAYUEH: Once you start to disrupt supply chains that is economically hugely damaging... You cannot just reverse that... the U.S. could be cut out of major supply chains around the world. That is why this president’s approach is potentially much more damaging... #AMJoy https://t.co/06ldlLZYt5

.@JOHNJHARWOOD-I’m concerned about the president’s state of mind. He did not look well to me in that press conference. He was not speaking logically or rationally. It sounded as if he was making stuff up… There was something about his affect that was oddly kind of languid #AMJoy https://t.co/Ud2julzYN3
.@DAN_DICKER: I love this idea that his relationship with everyone is a 10.

We're trending #reiders! Thanks for contributing to our amazing conversation every weekend. Can we get our hashtag higher? #AMJoy... #AMJoy... #AMJoy... https://t.co/K2kn6YDy0S
.@ZERLINAMAXWELL: I think we need to be really honest as Americans and confront our racist history because the #Roseanne story is about racism, but not adequately resourcing #PuertoRico and not properly covering the story is also about racism #AMJoy https://t.co/P9TAKRAwmA
.@ERICBOEHLERT: All this chaos, focusing on leaks, focusing on culture wars, #Trump wants us to do that. Then when he comes out with this completely incoherent tariff policy people are kind of exhausted, and say I guess we're going to do this now #AMJoy https://t.co/iySPk3tVEK
.@JESS_MC: The culture war thing matters because it speaks to the fact that we're being run by white supremacists. Every time he does this, it is a specifically racist thing... defending a racist, or denigrating a black journalist, or black athlete, or black celebrity... #AMJoy https://t.co/SEpetTuVTs
.@GABRIELSHERMAN: One the one hand, #Trump's tweets are president statements. The media should cover what the president is talking about. On the other hand they are bright, shiny objects that get people chasing things that aren't necessarily in the interest of the country #AMJoy https://t.co/bLtDzdEATk
.@ANUSHAYHOSSAIN: It is very clear that the U.S. government cannot handle the amount of children coming into their care... There are risks and reports of these kids going off to traffickers. It's a very dangerous situation that is cruel and ineffective #AMJoy https://t.co/CXU5BvCywL

.@MICHAELSTEELE: The parties are a reflection of the people. The candidates are a reflection of the people. As we live in these times #DonaldTrump is a reflection of where we are right now. Americans have to ask themselves a very important question... Is this who we are? #AMJoy https://t.co/MLMp8yAOTS
.@SUEMITERRY: Kim Jong-un wants to be a normal, modern leader of a modern nation. He has met with Xi Jinping twice, it made him look good... He wants international acceptance as a normal country with nuclear weapons... He wants legitimacy more than anything else #AMJoy #Korea https://t.co/mOkXa3A0wa
.@DUYEONKIM: It's apparent that #Trump does not understand the full extent of the complexities of these issues. My concern really is that he might give away too much. He might be inclined to sign a peace treaty even before denuclearization because it might sound good... #AMJoy https://t.co/c2oIxzuUB0
.@JAMILSMITH: The founders anticipated a man like #Trump. That's why we have impeachment. But if you have no political will and you have a corrupt Congress that's not willing to enforce those norms and those bylaws then we're screwed. We have no options... #AMJoy https://t.co/qmBbtdGEjt
.@SELECTEDWISDOM: The strategy is muddy the waters. Have you ever seen #Trump's tax returns? The 2016 strategy was you'll see 'em when we get to them... The idea is kick the can down the road.

.@TIFFANYDCROSS: To hear thoughtful words from a leader who can echo these sentiments at a time like now, who can put the country first. It’s not about him, it beyond him.

.@LAWPROFBUTLER: #Trump wants Sessions to take over the Russia investigation [as] Sessions has taken the loyalty pledge. That’s the kind of person #Trump thinks should be supervising a criminal investigation of him. We talk about norms. Norms don’t work for this president. #AMJoy https://t.co/oGPM31iizd
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: People who have exposure on state levels could always be charged with state crimes which the president has no ability to pardon. If he does pardon people they can’t claim the fifth. They could be forced to testify. So President #Trump, it ain’t gonna work! #AMJoy https://t.co/B0ciyFVqLV
.@DAVIDCORNDC: #Trump doesn’t come to this from a position of justice, righting wrongs, and looking at systematic failures. What he’s doing with these pardons, making them political, sending messages--is he’s undermining the judicial system--he’s undermining prosecutors. #AMJoy https://t.co/sm9hnaeqwJ
.@TIFFANYDCROSS: What is interesting is how people have gotten to this president. You have to be a reality TV star. Kim Kardashian’s in the West Wing. Or you have to be Sylvester Stallone... You have people lobbying this president. #AMJoy https://t.co/cpqHsVnbXF
.@SARAHKENDZIOR: When you have an autocratic system, when you have an alliance of dictators, it is easier to carry off these kinds of kleptocratic practices that Trump and Putin and others have been engaged in... this alliance of politics, business, and crime... #AMJoy https://t.co/KkRHz7v9Bd

.@MALCOLMNANCE: #Trump feels comfortable with dictators, autocrats… He is in complete alignment with Putin... Putin has worked very hard over 20 years to create an axis of autocracies.

.@MARIATERESA1: When we are talking about this idea that #Mueller &amp; Clapper are trying to do the job of Democrats that is absolutely false. If anything they are trying to be true patriots, stick to the letter of the law, and basically make sure we get to the bottom of this #AMJoy https://t.co/jvm3bI8YKl
.@GABRIELSHERMAN: ...whatever #Mueller finds will be entering into this partisan cloud… That’s the problem because #Trump is not bound by rules of probity and silence and #RobertMueller is. The fact is this is a one-sided fight. #Trump is able to use that vacuum. #AMJoy https://t.co/x7gDSHA83m

And it gets more ugly by the day #AMJoy https://t.co/02Rm4vvn86

.@TRIBELAW: #Impeachment is a device designed to use in extreme cases. And this is an extreme case. But you have to use it with a sense of its potential and its upside, its downside and what the alternatives are. Impeachment is neither a magic wand, nor a doomsday device #AMJoy https://t.co/cms2OTRHYX

How their child is gonna do in their future. They’re concerned about healthcare… That’s what’s gonna unite us #AMJoy https://t.co/AHbS47E2jo

But we have not been able to link Black Cube and its client directly to #Trump admin. #AMJoy https://t.co/ffDNpBzE99

.@LAWPROFBUTLER: The conventional wisdom has kind of become collusion is no longer a thing, it’s all about obstruction. Collusion is very much in the picture.

.@NaveedAJamali: When it comes to the #Trump cabal what we're asking is the difference between using diplomacy &amp; pay-to-play.

.@K_JeanPierre: The young people are going to make this change... Since we cannot change the laws, Congress refuses to change the laws, we have to change Congress... I commend them for doing that because the people who are in charge are not going to do anything #AMJoy #guncontrol https://t.co/hlPx9HuAuJ
.@LawProfButler: Even under the view that #Trump can't be indicted while sitting the constitutional remedy is impeachment and then after he's removed from office there's no question that he could be charged with a crime #AMJoy https://t.co/mnfvA7Vr73
.@MalcolmNance-That they found people within or near the campaign who were willing to come to the FBI &amp; act as an informant tells you there is an underlying basis of criminality happening that is real. Pretending it's not is not going to get them out of the hole they're in #AMJoy https://t.co/dvoaaD3iCZ
.@sarahkendzior: #Mueller in 2011 gave a very interesting speech about this network between government, corporate &amp; criminal interests all colliding in a globalized, technologically-bound way.... the kind of people he described sound exactly like #Trump and his network #AMJoy https://t.co/sFqnvPPHPT
.@MichaelAvenatti: It is still our intention to depose the president of the United States Mr. #Trump because now more than ever we need some straight answers under oath, none of this nonsense where the story changes every week, every month... #AMJoy https://t.co/zLnfraNGEu
.@MichaelAvenatti: I am confident that when we get #Trump under oath &amp; he's actually forced to look me in the eye across a table &amp; answer those questions we're going to find out there's been even more lies and deceptive conduct than the American people have learned to date #AMJoy https://t.co/U0zwjeJmno
.@MichaelAvenatti: #Trump promised the American people he was going to surround himself with the best &amp; the brightest... #Giuliani is... an embarrassment. I can't believe this is the best the president of the U.S. can get to represent his interests. It's an absolute joke. #AMJoy https://t.co/0v9h7OIBiY

COL. WILKERSON: This is a regional struggle for the balance of power that we destroyed. Each of the powers in the region contending with Iran wants the U.S. to be their sugar daddy... This administration, especially the president, is not astute enough to figure this out... #AMJoy https://t.co/d7l6x9lViP
.@TPARSI: The United States under #Trump is now signalling, “we don’t care about Europe. The three allies we care about are the prime minister in Israel, the crown prince in Saudi Arabia, and the rulers of the UAE. Not France, Germany and the UK.” #AMJoy #IranNuclearDeal https://t.co/5NAXbaYr1C
.@MALCOLMNANCE on Kelly Sadler’s statement on @SenJohnMcCain: An honorable military veteran if they had heard this story would have said there is a line. That line has now been crossed. But they have this cultish love where the love of #DonaldTrump exceeds the Constitution #AMJoy https://t.co/HxfAax4iSx
.@DRJASONJOHNSON: They are saying certain people from certain parts of the world are incapable of experiencing America the way other people have, even though we know John Kelly’s great-grandfather was illiterate and driving a wagon in the early part of the 20th century... #AMJoy https://t.co/33oBKS4HLe
.@MSTARADOWDELL: #Democrats need to... not allow this debate to be on the terms of Republicans. There needs to be more messaging from Democrats around these issues... I am hearing people who are not aligned with #Trump asking “why wouldn’t we want to secure our border?” #AMJoy https://t.co/g4xU2d70Xj
.@RAULAREYES on U.S. policy of separating children from immigrant parents: 		Last year The New York Times reported they’ve already lost 1,500 children that they placed out with sponsors agencies… they don’t know where they are. That’s 1,500 children that are missing.		#AMJoy https://t.co/85cFEDjr5K
.@SARAHKENDZIOR: The problem is corruption, kleptocracy, and a lack of accountability by the Republican party who itself is funded by these oligarchs, by these mafiosos, by these characters who have entered the picture &amp; are harming American democracy #AMJoy https://t.co/UX4lvUSFeS
.@MALCOLMNANCE: #Putin is playing a strategic game of influence warfare. Of perception management. He found that oligarchs were making all these contacts with conservatives… he realized he could co-opt the entire American conservative movement #AMJoy https://t.co/EOsbcZOoYb
.@MICHAELAVENATTI: If you’re out there and you have stuff related to your relationships with #MichaelCohen that you’re concerned are going to come out you should be concerned because they are going to come out... that’s a stern warning this #SaturdayMorning #AMJoy https://t.co/SIL6ouFiTR

.@TOURE: #Kanye presents himself as a genius &amp; we find out that he is really dumb &amp; really does not know a lot of things about the world. I assumed he was a reader because his mother was a PhD... &amp; now he is sort of bragging that he does not read... #AMJoy https://t.co/GbKU5kskKB
.@JRUBINBLOGGER: There’s one of several explanations. One, #Giuliani is a plant from #Mueller. Two, he’s in a declining mental state. Three, he wants to get fired. Four, he wants #Trump to get fired, or five some combination thereof #AMJoy https://t.co/ZknDfpyZww
.@ERICBOEHLERT: #Trump has clearly hired his mini-me. He’s a buffoon. He’s a liar. The idea that he’s filing legal briefs down in D.C. is a joke. #Giuliani hasn’t been in a courtroom in 30 years. He’s basically like communications director for impeachment #AMJoy https://t.co/0nviGDlMq4
.@SUEMITERRY: Oh absolutely he knows President #Trump. 100% of North Korea’s energy is focused on us. We have a million-and-a-half issues. We are so distracted… Kim Jong-un is all about the United States. They are doing their homework #AMJoy https://t.co/0PIYYIwuee
.@JRUBINBLOGGER: Now the question becomes what do we gain if we pull out [of the #IranNuclearDeal]. It is completely counter-intuitive. #Trump wants to have a longer deal. How do we get a longer deal by pulling out of the current deal? How do we get better inspections?... #AMJoy https://t.co/A08ube4GeC
.@RULAJEBREAL: #Trump’s opposition to the Iran deal is ideological... whatever Obama did he needs to kill. The problem is the international community will not follow him. If Israel will push him into war with Iran… the consequences will be devastating for U.S. &amp; region #AMJoy https://t.co/yPpzM8AsaL
.@MICHELLEBERNARD: As an arm of the law if #Mueller finds evidence of fraud he has to go there. He has a moral obligation to talk to Rosenstein or maybe send it to another prosecutor or U.S. attorneys office but he just can’t ignore it. And where there’s smoke there’s fire #AMJoy https://t.co/xj2oaRLvAb
.@LAWPROFBUTLER:  I have to say… If President #Trump was doing damage control for Rudy Giuliani-- [saying] it’s his first day in the job give him a break -- If President Trump is doing damage control for somebody you’re in a very sunken place #AMJoy https://t.co/pcpB2TORmN
.@LAWPROFBUTLER: Based on Supreme Court precedent it would go to the Supreme Court. At the end of the day, President Trump would have to testify. The only privilege he has is the fifth amendment privilege. #AMJoy https://t.co/IarNa92jcL
.@NATASHABERTRAND: Tom Barrack’s importance in all this is that he serves as a nexus between the president and #Manafort. After the election &amp; Manafort was ousted… Barrack hired Rick Gates Manafort’s deputy... Why did Barrack feel compelled to keep Gates around? #AMJoy https://t.co/Utl4CPyy2o

.@JRUBINBLOGGER: This is why it’s so important we never got his tax returns. Because if #Trump is making gobs of cash &amp; it didn’t seem that way in 2015-remember we got 1 page of a tax return-if those don’t show a massive amount of income then where is this cash coming from #AMJoy https://t.co/53NbeBFXLL

.@JOECONASON: #Trump has lowered bar for GOP candidates so far in terms of the ability to express bigotry… The fact that now #DonBlankenship a convicted criminal who was responsible for those mine deaths thinks he can use an anti-Asian slur &amp; get votes is a very bad thing #AMJoy https://t.co/hODsjXpL23
West Virginia GOP Senate Primary #AMJoy https://t.co/yslslGvPQY
.@MARIATERESA1: 57,000 people who have lived in this country for over 20 years all of a sudden yesterday found out that they are no longer eligible, [so] they are undocumented. #AMJoy https://t.co/cyBZXHsXt3
.@MARIATERESA1: The trajectory of this administration [is that] by 2020 the president’s directives are going to make half-a-million people who were here documented, undocumented overnight #AMJoy https://t.co/FDSyNEq6OA
.@JILLWINEBANKS-#Trump will find it irresistible to want to testify… he’s arrogant. He thinks he can persuade the grand jury he’s innocent... He doesn’t know what documents and testimony #Mueller has that will contradict him... stepping into dangerous territory if he lies #AMJoy https://t.co/k2D4nK3IOi
.@MATTHEWAMILLER: If #Trump wants to take the fifth every American has the right to do that as a private citizen but... if other federal employees did they’re fired… we shouldn’t set a lower standard for the person that sits at the top of the government... #AMJoy https://t.co/QKrFKc8aGv
.@RWPUSA: I just spoke of the core values that are important to me. I don’t think those are core values Democrats disagree with. The right of individuals to make their own decisions including about abortion &amp; the protection of the environment &amp; fiscal responsibility #AMJoy https://t.co/gblE7EtIiD
.@RWPUSA: I’m not going to take any PAC money. No PAC money. That’s what’s corrupting our government, is all the outside money, PACs, and the dark money organizations. I reject all of it #AMJoy #Minnesota https://t.co/YT79enzE66
.@RWPUSA: If Republican party is going to back #Trump &amp; these absurd policies that have nothing to do w/traditional values of party then millions of people are going to jump ship. I’m only one of them. In Minnesota we’re going to focus not just on #Trump but on real issues #AMJoy https://t.co/B3D7U9Bq6v
.@SHANNONRWATTS: The bottom line is it really is up to companies to protect its customers when lawmakers aren’t protecting their constituents. They play a very important role in helping us to make the NRA leaders’ agenda toxic. And it should be. #AMJoy https://t.co/bJSswu4qLh
Amount Spent by the NRA Supporting #DonaldTrump in 2016 #AMJoy https://t.co/rnQRiOlyos
.@REPTEDDEUTCH: People are onto the game, they’re onto the distractions &amp; lies that come from the NRA. The American people now understand. We now need to push back hard against them so that my colleagues in Congress can understand as well or they’re going to lose elections #AMJoy https://t.co/r8MEWAHICz
.@NICKAKERMAN-Most who wound up being convicted in #Watergate weren’t involved in the break in. They were involved in the obstruction… why #Trump fired #Comey, why he asked Comey to stop the investigation… you put it all together &amp; you have a clear obstruction of justice #AMJoy https://t.co/GruNkXzSPV
.@NICKAKERMAN: What you have here is an admission by all of them that they funneled money through a law firm using an LLC that was set up with phony names... with aliases under agreements with president of the United States going under the name of David Denison... #AMJoy https://t.co/XNnFjNDn2U
.@LISABLOOM: Why is #MichaelCohen taking out home equity loans to protect #DonaldTrump? There are only two explanations. They're trying to hide the money because they’re doing something illegal. Or no. 2 #Trump is actually broke just like Michelle Wolf said last week… #AMJoy https://t.co/7pvF0Ah3Vz
.@NICKAKERMAN: What’s going on here is the chief lawyer is Donald J. Trump. #Guiliani is basically just a shill for #DonaldTrump… He actually referred to the FBI agents who executed a valid search warrant on the office of #MichaelCohen as a bunch of storm troopers #AMJoy https://t.co/ToV8eBs2PQ
