@McCartneyWP 2/ Best way to fix is to introduce more private sector competition into the system, for example contracting out more track maintenance work.

Not frequent @GeorgeWill retweeters here, but this pension problem is big deal. Best solution in rail transit world is increased contracting https://t.co/DiVwTjTaTx
Smart responsible move by @MBTA: 	https://t.co/OAJjSIO8tW		Outsourcing works. It works well on track maintenance too.
4/ increasing fares, or asking strapped jurisdictions and Feds for more funding.
3/ judge that it's a good idea. Best way to quickly gain cost savings and productivity increases. Certainly better than reducing service,
2/ like to see him and WMATA in general continue to push on increasing contracting out. Union doesn't like it, which is a pretty good way to

2/ @amaxsmith @MartinDiCaro @martinepowers ..to in-house labor. Incentive becomes to get work done as productively as possible vs incentive
1/ @amaxsmith @MartinDiCaro @martinepowers this is a great example of why business model of contracting out work for set price is superior
Hmmm, maybe consider contracting out this work for a set amount of dollars instead of this model? This is absurd.	https://t.co/j0265WNgBI

World's most beautiful airports https://t.co/O6Zf4VHRpK Only US one = no people @realDonaldTrump let's get infrastructure investment going!
@amaxsmith This seems to be obviously true. Our suggestion is that introducing more competitive bidding contracting to system would help.
At @GOPoversight @wmata hearing, @BarbaraComstock finishes strong pointing out how much less expensive Davis Bacon contractors would be.
Forgive the unprofessionalism, but I love @RepJohnDelaney. Accurately describes needed @WMATA restructuring. That's how to get necessary $
Wow. @BarbaraComstock calls out @WMATA union rep for tweeting that "comstock is the enemy." She's not. She's a leader in calling for fixes.
Strong leader @BarbaraComstock accurately says we need to blow up @wmata compact and fix this agency.
@RepMarkMeadows rightfully baffled by @WMATA union refusal to take responsibility for falsifying records.
.@GerryConnolly making strong point about lack of accountability and performance among @WMATA union and employees. Need competitive bidding.
@Gardner_LM @FTA_DOT @wmata @USDOTFRA: If the Union contract with WMATA allowed for track work to be contracted out more than 10% = save $$$
@amaxsmith @RepMarkMeadows @ATULocal689: #1 solution is to allow competitive bidding of track maintenance work to private companies
.@RepMarkMeadows unfortunately probably mistaken that @wmata union would ever be willing to fire any employees. Need to intro competition.
@RepMarkMeadows looks he will be a strong successor to @RepMica on @GOPoversight @wmata oversight.
RT @OverhaulMetro: Mica: What percentage of maintenance is contracted out? If they can't do it right, they need to go. #WMATA
@WTOP if a contractor did that, contract would be voided, people fired instantly, firm never hired again. #accountability
@RepMica specifically asks @WMATA how much maintenance work being contracted out, strongly suggests more. Smart. Competitive bidding works.
2/ @GOPoversight @wmata ...hear laughing in audience. Literally nobody other than the union believes that.
1/ Union rep at @GOPoversight @wmata hearing improbably claims contractors are doing work in-house workers could  do better. You could hear
3/  @JackEvansWard2 @GOPoversight @wmata subsidy. False. Can get work done better &amp; cheaper by increasing contracting out/competitive bid.
2/  @JackEvansWard2 @GOPoversight @wmata  $2.8b unfunded pension liabilities. True. But says only options are to cut service or increase

@RepMarkMeadows: "WMATA isn't like a fine wine, it doesn't get better with age." Yup. Time to introduce more competitive bidding/contracting
