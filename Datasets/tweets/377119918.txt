@ira I can see how CNN may be making a deliberate decision not to cover it any more than they absolutely need to. 		It’s a lot like how many celebrities don’t talk about the death threats they get because doing so usually increases the number they receive.
@ira Fair, but I’m becoming increasingly conflicted about how much coverage we should be giving to these insane plots against liberals. It’s important to cover the news, but the sensationalism of it might embolden others to come out the crazy closet and take their shot as well.

Sending lots of positive thoughts and well wishes to those that were injured during the stampede.		#guncontrolnow
In the meantime, I’ll be donating to candidates and organizations that I believe in, signing up to knock on doors and learning more about how I can advocate for gun control. Literally anything and everything to remind myself that I’m not completely powerless in this moment.
If everyone sitting in a position to pass laws in this country felt exactly what many of us felt on Saturday, comprehensive gun control would have happened years ago.  This weekend I was terrified and today I’m enraged. You better believe that I’ll be voting in November.
Most of our lawmakers have no idea what the stakes actually are for many of us and it’s obvious in the bills they write and the excuses they give when they continue to fail us.
Fear of not having control over our bodies, fear of being shot while black, fear of being deported, fear that someone who’s taken advantage of your body will never have to face any consequences, fear of not being able to make ends meet, fear of dying in a mass shooting.
It was a reminder that none of us feel truly safe. This past year has made it clear to me that while many of us live in daily fear, the majority of the people who create our laws do not.
How sad that we live in country and time where someone accidentally stepping on and popping a bottle (GCF emailed attendees to update us that it wasn’t a fallen barrier) can set off mass hysteria and panic because it remotely sounded like gun fire.
Las Vegas was almost exactly a year ago and NOTHING has changed. Anyone who sits in a seat where they have the capacity to pass gun control legislation should be ashamed.
Finding a moments relief when you find another friend, see the sheer panic in their eyes, grab onto them and hope that they never let go. I’m beyond grateful that it was a false alarm, but we all know that it’s not a matter of if but rather when there’ll be another mass shooting.
To see hundreds of people rushing at you, screaming with panic and yelling that there’s a shooter is something that I’d hoped to never experience. Grabbing a friends hand then losing them in the midst of the chaos and worrying that you may never see them again.
