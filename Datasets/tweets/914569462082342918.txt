@FisherBurton @KyleKulinski OR you could look it up. You’re not even trying.
@FisherBurton @madamx12369 @KyleKulinski How much does the “average american”? And why does that matter for what was said? Heritage is heritage
@madamx12369 @FisherBurton @KyleKulinski Where and when have I picked and chosen principles?
@madamx12369 @FisherBurton @KyleKulinski But it is what it is. She may have more European blood in her than Native, but Native still remains. I have more African blood in me than Native. But, like her, Native still remains. And it’s not a choice. It just is.
@madamx12369 @FisherBurton @KyleKulinski OK, I AGREE that she has let progressives down. I am disappointed by her in many respects. But a fake Native? She has lineage which was just proven. I also have lineage that dayes back five generations or so. Many Natives have said they don’t want to claim people like me.
@FisherBurton @KyleKulinski You asked if she has. Just Google it. Not my job to do your homework. It’s all right out there. Truly.
@RyanGirdusky @AnnCoulter Who are you talking about? Bush allowed the banks to crash, Obama deported more criminal illegal immigrants than anyone before him, Trump is talking about increasing troops, and Trump’s tax bill overwhelmingly supports the rich. So, again, WHO are youbtalking about?
@AnnCoulter @TuckerCarlson It’s really sad that you backed out of the debate with Kyle. He has substantive commentary and is NOT owned by any major corporation. It would have been good to hear your thoughts on his commentary! MOST Americans don’t have a book on the best seller’s list, but we agree with him
@GreenleafOWN I REALLY don’t like Zora’s character. I would expect to feel bad for her, but she is SOOOO toxic and illogical. She is manipulative and horrible to the people who love her, while SEEING that boy disrespect them and still chasing behind him. I just CANNOT with her. https://t.co/ISkIpGET7R
@InstinctCullen @KyleKulinski THANK YOU for the indication of sarcasm! I SWEAR I was thinking “here they go with this Venezuela crap, as usual! 😂
@FisherBurton @KyleKulinski Although she HAS criticized Obama for his ties to big banks and selling out regular Americans. She has also spoken out about fees he’s received for speaking engagements. She, to me, does not speak out nearly as strongly as she used to. But to say not at all against him is false.
@Neroke_5 @KyleKulinski NO, YOU need to REVISIT his previous segments when he DID call Obama out for that! The mere fact that you’re criticizing HIS ability to “fact check” is pretty freaking ironic. Calling Trump out is NOT “divisive partisanship”. It’s what knowledgeable, responsible citizens do!
@HappyWeasle @KyleKulinski He DID know. He’s spoken on it. He’s not a partisan hack. So what was your point?
@KyleKulinski I deal with this ALL the time when I criticize Trump. Even his most “sensible” supporters do this. When they hear me criticize Obama, they (the “sensible” ones) THEN may even agree with my original criticism! The fact that these are the “sensible” ones is pretty sad.
@EdKrassen And how about those taxes?
@MikeBarre @Idealinfacts @TrumpHotelMatt1 @shannonrwatts What makes you think they were treated like animals??
@insecurehbo Some folks saying it wasn’t her business but when it’s your BFF, it IS your business. Especially with how Issa used her so she could spy on Nanceford. It could have potentially thrown Issa so far off her game that she wouldn’t have been focused enough to connect with ol girl. 🤷🏽‍♀️
@insecurehbo Nope. She didn’t say stay away FOREVER, just for that day. Issa didn’t want drama and that would’ve thrown a monkey wrench in the whole day. Issa SAID she was over him and blocked him. She told Issa that night. I don’t think she was wrong AT ALL.

@ErmagherdTwiter Thank YOU!!!
@WanemacherAdam @LOLARAYNEATL @AP There are women who lost low paying jobs and know no other way to pay the bills. Society has taught women that if you have nothing else, men WILL PAY FOR SEX. IF YOU had a starving child and no skills, you would be surprised by what you’re willing to do.
@WanemacherAdam @LOLARAYNEATL @AP How many men pay for sex then go home and kiss their children? Or worse, kiss and infect their wives with diseases? We demonize the mothers and say next to nothing about the FATHERS who pay to be serviced. Some even travel overseas to do so! Wake up.
@WanemacherAdam @LOLARAYNEATL @AP It’s like the drug game. We live in a capitalistic society. As long as there are customers, there will be vendors. Yet we hardly demonize the men who pay to play. We do so with drug addicts, tho.Drugs are addictive. Paying for sex is a choice. Be mad at the men who supply demand.
@WanemacherAdam @LOLARAYNEATL @AP If the ONLY way she knows how to properly pay for the cost of having children is prostitution, and men are always willing to pay, it will exist.
@WanemacherAdam @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Many women are not taught self worth. They will have sex with the highest bidder because it’s what they were taught. While also being taught that abortion is wrong so here come the children. Condoms are NOT full proof. Nor are they always present when drunk or high.
@texan_beer @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Don’t assume that her children are or were ever in danger. Many women who do that KNOW they want to keep their children away from that life and entrust them with people who will allow that. She kept me in the dark - plausible deniability. And knew her children were taken care of.
@texan_beer @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Furthermore, I had a friend who was a sex worker at one point in her life. Our mothers grew up together. My mom taught me to go to work everyday. Her mother taught her to have sex with men for $. I would often babysit her kids when she went to “work” not knowing what she did.
@texan_beer @LOLARAYNEATL @AP Not really sure what you meant to say when you said “have for the government”, but if you were implying that she works for the government simply because she said she’s a “social worker”, you may want to reevaluate that stance.
@E1Elit @USCG @usairforce What exactly happened with this USCG member? I saw some racism brushed under the rug when I was active. I think it depends more on your chain of command than branch of service. Some people are NOT having it, while others are far more lenient.
@KSmithSpeaking @causalitybrunch @LOLARAYNEATL @AP @CityofAtlanta Well, based on what was ACTUALLY SAID, there is NO WAY to get “sex trafficker” from “escort”. There are TONS of escorts in this country who have NOTHING to do with sex trafficking. Furthermore, MOST social workers DO NOT work for the government, but rather, independent entities.
