@realDonaldTrump Sad!  You could articulate it better  without a need to dramatize it. You had a good point except it sounded like a children‚Äôs scary movies which makes it non believable. We all do not want to see the bad practice of abortion for no good reason. Can you say it again properly now?

@Rberbesiod @realDonaldTrump What‚Äôs the best way to make changes in Venezuela if vote is not a solution?   Foreign interference in any country to pick their leader would have the nationalists and independents take side with the local dictators. But, there got to be a better way to free this beautiful country
@realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt like the Venezuela‚Äôs dictators. But, is it fair to interfere in their elections by just recognizing the opposition leader?  They should vote the dictator out of office. We need to stay disciplined. We don‚Äôt want other countries to recognize Hillary as the US PRESIDENT

If @realDonaldTrump fire anyone involved in this Russian investigation, it would be a victory for those republicans who hates him and almost the dems. People close to him like @seanhannity should advise him to take the high road and let it take its course to the dead end.

@lufthansa @united my return flight back to Frankfurt is on Thursday afternoon.  It's not humane to treat me like this.
@lufthansa @united I can't keep buying clothes for this very important meetings. I feel like no one is trying to give me the right info
@lufthansa @united spent a lot of money for clothes for my exhibition today. I still didn't get my luggage today. Can u please help ?
@lufthansa @united kept calling the number and not getting an adult to talk to. My file reference number is BCNLH51279.
@united how could I resolve this when united is telling me that it's Lufthansa responsibility and Lufthansa is saying that  united lost it?
@united Lufthansa is telling me that united never transferred my luggage. No one seem to tell me the last scanned station.
@united my united flight was UA538 which was changed to Lufthansa.  My luggage was on THIS flight which was too late to pull it out
@united @united united delayed my flight from Los Angeles and were asked to take Lufthansa. Bag # 0016 200840
#united and #Lufthansa need to improve their customer service. Its a real problem.
I can not believe how the @united and @lufthansa are rude.  They lost my luggage and they don't seem to take any responsibility. Dissapoint!

@ICL_Addis I am so proud of your accomplishments.  I just wish I could see the nurse on the picture wear some kind of medical exam glove.
