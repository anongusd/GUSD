@Erica4NY I have been watching your coverage and you said the pink area will have 	- Snow, rain and ice	- Ice damage possible	- Damaging wind gusts		The picture with pink shading shows otherwise. 	Is the above correct, or has it changed?
@Erica4NY Hi Erica,	I know the green area is with the points that start with "Mostly rain" But I'm confused on blue and pink.		Is the area that is pink the one that has the points:	-Mostly or all snow	-Some ice mixes in	-Strong gusty winds		Or is that the blue area.(or both)? Thanks :)
@NatGeoChannel It is really amazing to see that ~20 years ago, people were learning about the internet. Oh how times have changed. Nowadays the only thing people do is use the internet. Go outside to a park, a library, or a museum for a change. Appreciate what we really have.
