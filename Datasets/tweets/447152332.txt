This is a very critical time for the USA right now. We are confronting North Korea &amp; our military has to be funded &amp; strong. I trust president Trump &amp; believe in his vision. Unhappy? Where would we be with Hillary?  We must drain the RINOs
@mike_Zollo I just remind myself where the nation would be had Hillary won. I still believe and trust our President.
