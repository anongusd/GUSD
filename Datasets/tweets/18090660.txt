The odor is believed to have resulted from a previous day’s chemistry project. The 8 midshipmen are being medically evaluated, and no other potential injuries were reported. All of the midn were ambulatory, breathing normally and are being medically evaluated as a precaution.
Around 9:15 a.m. this morning approximately eight midshipmen reported the odor after entering the classroom. As a result, #NavalAcademy Fire and Emergency services were dispatched and both Michelson Hall and the adjacent Chauvenet Hall were evacuated as a precaution...
#USNA is investigating reports of a suspicious odor coming from a classroom in Michelson Hall, the academic building housing the Academy's Chemistry department.  NOTE-Michelson and Chauvenet halls have now re-opened, with the exception of the reported classroom...

All clear at USNA-The academy is returning to normal operations after the suspicious package reported at USNA this morning was evaluated as non-hazardous. #usna #usnavy
USNA Fire and Police Depts are currently responding to reports of a suspicious package in the Bancroft Hall mailroom at USNA. Midshipmen, staff and faculty are advised to stay clear of the area until further notice and to report any suspicious activity.

The Naval Academy appreciates Nike’s announcement to no longer use the UNDEFEATED logo resembling our Naval Academy crest. We are pleased by this decision which is respectful of the Academy, our students and alumni. #usna #USNavy #nike #midshipmen #gonavymids
The similarities of the Nike/UNDEFEATED logo released this week and the USNA Crest are undeniable and we believe their logo is clearly an infringement under trademark law. USNA is working with Navy leadership to order Nike/UNDEFEATED to cease and desist their use of the logo.
... It is difficult to understand why anyone would modify and use our symbol without permission for marketing and profit motives.
We’ve seen a lot of discussion re: our USNA Seal this week...The USNA crest represents honor, integrity and leadership,and is emblematic of our students and more than 80k alumni who serve and have served our country, many of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in its defense.
