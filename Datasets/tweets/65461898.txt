Senatorial clock is ticking, must be considered by 9/30. Need 50 votes for Cassidy-Heller to pass. Still unsure if enough votes to pass.
Cassidy-Heller will: Repeal mandates, Med device tax, strengthen states ability to waive ACA regs, though some fee strings still exist
Next up #Obamacare update from Rob Rieger w/ Adams &amp; Reese. Is anything going to happen? What is the Cassidy-Heller plan?
Solutions: health literacy, understand concerns, address maximums, address access to barriers but most importantly understand the wage diff
Addressing well-being of workers is foundational to bending the cost curve
Employers have options to better align health benefits for better outcomes for worker &amp; employer but employer must rethink how benefits used
Employers must rethink the way incentives are structured; lower wage workers respond to different incentives than lower wage workers
Lower wage workers use more emergency services vs higher wage workers who use more preventative care. Employer must address this.
40% of health status is determined by socioeconomic status; this should be basis of how employers offer benefits to better help workers
Senior mgmt sincerely interested in employee well-being is biggest driver of engaging employees, which in turn impacts overall business
Sherman suggests employers must think differently about how they design their benefit programs; not cost vs health but can have both
Dr Sherman: wellness programs should be holistic to encompass stress and mental health issues  rather than just physical change

La AG joined coalition of 21 states in filing federal court complaint challenging @USDOL new #overtime rule.https://t.co/Proz5HZT80
Lots of ? from biz owners on how to comply &amp; who #overtime rule applies to. Many thanks to Guidry @OgletreeDeakins for answering each.
Scary enough @USDOL had to pay out $7 million recently for not complying w/ FLSA w/ union workers. Yet expect private sector to comply.
#Overtime rule means employees may need to start logging hours where never did before. Employers need to keep close eye on records.
Guidry @OgletreeDeakins tells emp to take several steps. 1st is to eval jobs impacted then must decide if sal increase or reclassify emp.
The #overtime rule for salaries will be increased every 3 years so biz owners need to calculate the increase into their future budgets.
Guidry w/@OgletreeDeakins notes the #overtime rule doubles salary for white collar exemptions. Biz needs to figure out best how to adapt.

@talace @weeklystandard not maternity coverage. Won't ever need it!
@talace @weeklystandard and now the policies are so expensive, that they can't afford them.
@talace @weeklystandard those were the policies they chose. Now we all have to pay for coverage that we will never use.
@talace @weeklystandard  the government decided that those were bad. Those folks were happy with their policy.
@talace @weeklystandard that's anecdotal and obviously not what most are experiencing.
