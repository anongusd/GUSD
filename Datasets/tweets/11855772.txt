RT @adriennemong: Trump: I don’t want to talk about increasing sanctions.
President Trump says he has not committed to holding a 3rd Trump-Kim summit, and declines to answer when asked if he now accepts North Korea as a nuclear power.
JUST IN: Asked about having halted joint US-South Korea military exercises during North Korea negotiations, and if they would now continue, President Trump re-ups complaints about the costs of the exercises and questions whether South Korea should be paying more to support them.
President Trump acknowledges that the dismantling of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex was discussed during the summit, but the potential concession was not enough to lift sanctions, which, President Trump says, was wanted by the North Koreans.
President Trump says that Kim Jong Un agreed to continue to not test with rocket or missile launches.
Asked if it was premature to have a deal-signing ceremony scheduled ahead of a deal being reached, President Trump again says that sometimes you have to be willing to walk away, and he'd much rather "do it right" vs fast.
President Trump says it's "a terrible thing" that the Michael Cohen congressional hearing was held during his summit with North Korea in Vietnam, and should have been held after the summit; focuses on continuing to describe his view that the investigation is "the Russian hoax."
