Wow. The head of the Republican Party sees zero issue with the MASSIVE security failures within the Trump White House walls, only those who take advantage of it.		Wake up, @GOPChairwoman! If it was easy for Omarosa to take advantage, who else has? https://t.co/EA0tPIB81c
Omarosa being able to tape in the Situation Room isn't funny.		We understand the absurdity, but we implore people to not make it into a joke.		These kinds of security breaches in the WH can cost troops' lives, and @POTUS is ultimately responsible. This is on Trump.
If Donald Trump could not stop @OMAROSA from secretly recording within the situation room, there is absolutely zero chance he's able (or willing) to protect us from Putin.		Donald Trump is a SEVERE security risk to the United States. https://t.co/Gwxpi39HKi
