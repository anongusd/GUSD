RT @CAIROregon: 1) We support the Mayor in making sure the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) is held accountable.
I‚Äôll be working with Chief Outlaw and community organizations in the days to come to solidify details.
I have heard from the people of Portland. I agree we must do more to ensure that we adhere to the values affirmed by the resolution recently passed by City Council to condemn white supremacist and alt-right hate groups.
Chief Outlaw agrees this is a necessary next step and is more than ready to work with me on this.
Second: I will order an independent investigation to review the existence of bias in the actions of the PPB leading up to and during demonstrations involving alt-right and anti-fascist protesters.
First and foremost: Chief Outlaw and I going to implement training for the Portland Police Bureau around how to identify white supremacy per the recommendation of the @OJRCenter , @CAIROregon and @WStatesCenter.
My statement on further @PortlandPolice training and an independent investigation: https://t.co/lrdoaJwWNj https://t.co/fTnoIB9UP4
Community members have long expressed concerns about police bias during demonstrations &amp; these texts reinforce those fears. We hear you &amp; want to listen more. @ChiefDOutlaw and I will be holding a public listening session on Thurs. 6-8 pm at Maranatha Church: 4222 NE 12th Avenue.
Until the investigation is complete, Lt. Niiya will cease communication with any event organizers and will not be participating in Rapid Response Team related activities. @PortlandPolice
I have directed Chief Outlaw to do a thorough investigation of this matter and report back to me expeditiously.
These text messages also raise serious questions about whether warrants are being enforced consistently and what information is being shared with individuals who may be subject to arrest.
Joey Gibson, the leader of Patriot Prayer, has led demonstrations that have caused significant disruption and increased fear in our community.
Community members have long expressed concerns about police bias during demonstrations. It is imperative for law enforcement to remain objective and professional, and in my opinion, these text messages appear to cross several boundaries.

‚ÄúSunday night/Monday.  Snow and rain mixed with snow begins late afternoon into early evening. 		Precipitation in the northern valley likely to begin as snow, then turning to rain or rain mixed with snow with less than one inch accumulation.‚Äù
‚ÄúTIMING / STRENGTH:		Saturday night / Sunday:  Snow showers will continue to decrease through Saturday night.  		Temperatures rapidly falling after sunset. Overnight low temperatures in the teens to low 20s.‚Äù
‚ÄúValley rain and snow at higher elevations now expected with Monday night/Tuesday weather system. Snow levels around 1500 feet, except in the Gorge near Hood River where snow levels near the surface. Very heavy snow expected in the Cascades.‚Äù

So far, demonstrators downtown have peacefully exercised their 1st amendment rights. Looks like they‚Äôre moving through Pioneer Courthouse Square now.		So far, traffic (mostly) hasn‚Äôt been impacted. 		Proud of them and our police officers.
It's been a great day here at City Hall! We're all excited to see the results tonight.	The city is expecting peaceful demonstrations to start soon in downtown Portland.		For real time information on how it might impact traffic, please follow @PortlandPolice.		I will post as well.
6/30/18		250+ demonstrated. Fights occurred. Demonstrators used weapons &amp; projectiles. Emergency crews responded to several people &amp; 5 were sent to hospital by ambulance, incl 1 officer. PPB revoked permit &amp; declared a riot. Multiple arrests made.		#ProtestSafetyOrdinance https://t.co/7j93HvEEmX
6/3/18	 	300+ people demonstrated &amp; counter-demonstrated. Members of competing groups used pepper spray &amp; threw fireworks, bottles, rocks. Fights broke out &amp; a person was struck repeatedly w/ a helmet.  Several went to hospital &amp; several were arrested.	 	#ProtestSafetyOrdinance https://t.co/VVHlbhtqf7
We fully expect the demonstrations tonight to be safe, peaceful, and engaging. We hope that everyone has a great time. This is just a reminder, based on our previous demonstrations, to abide by the laws. https://t.co/Vtpp6lu5bd
8/6/2017		300+ people. Some demonstrators engaged in physical altercations including using pepper spray on each other. Several demonstrators were impacted. A few people were arrested.		#ProtestSafetyOrdinance https://t.co/ubxFgAr3uL
6/4/2017		2,000+ demonstrated &amp; counter-demonstrated. Weapons confiscated incl. batons, shields, knives, brass knuckles, etc. Vandalism &amp; multiple fights, incl. fight w/ 50-60 people. 1 person injured. PPB declared unlawful assembly. Multiple arrests. 		#ProtestSafetyOrdinance https://t.co/wDe9GD1Fpd
4/29/17		Demonstrators held a rally at Montavilla Park &amp; marched to Eastport Plaza. More than 100 demonstrators &amp; counter demonstrators participated. Some wore helmets &amp; brought thick wooden sticks, others had a baseball bat &amp; baton. Several arrests.		#ProtestSafetyOrdinance https://t.co/z0xKylciTM
Here‚Äôs what you need to know about the demonstrations tonight. We know of at least 6 groups coming to downtown Portland. @PortlandPolice -  reached out to them to have a conversation. They have not yet responded. None of the groups have applied for a permit.
Portland, we want everyone to have a safe and fun election night. We want everyone to be able to safely exercise their 1st amendment rights. But know the laws: You cannot block streets, freeways or public transportation. 		And most importantly ‚Äî violence will not be tolerated.
Portland! Happy Election Day. #Vote2018
@orions_belch @MatPDX I‚Äôm referring to the protest safety ordinance here, if you look at the thread. Our goal is prevention of violence by setting common sense guidelines for groups with a known history of violence - these guidelines are only for demonstrations.

@gibsopi Read the ordinance. IF you have a prior history of violence, you will be restricted. Joining cities like Vegas and Raleigh in these type of common sense regulations. There are also many limitations on what we can and cannot do.
1st amendment rights honors the freedom of expression and the right for people to PEACEABLY assemble.		But what has Portland seen in the last two years? Chaos. Damaged storefronts. People getting hurt. That, has nothing to do with the 1st A and that is what we are trying to curb. https://t.co/9S3p4oysYm

153 years later, as we observe the end of an economic system that devalued human life and systematically destroyed families through separation, we must recognize that what is unfolding in front of our eyes is not new, has historical precedent, and must unequivocally be condemned.
On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas with the news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were finally and officially free. This became irrevocable with the ratification of the 13th Amendment later that year.
Today commemorates Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. Though the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued in 1863, and even as the Civil War came to a close in 1865, many African-Americans remained enslaved in the deepest parts of the former Confederacy.

Americans need stable housing that strengthens families and improves educational outcomes. Housing allows parents to focus on work and kids to focus on school. Housing reduces crime and drug abuse. Housing connects families to the community.
As we continue to see a reduction in investments on affordable housing on the federal side, it's time for civic-minded businesses and CEOs to step to the plate and follow @BernardJTyson and @KPShare example of investing in the success of everyone in our communities.

Every day, 96 Americans are killed by gun violence, and on average there are nearly 13,000 gun homicides every year. Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed with guns than people in other developed countries.

Cities must lead where the fed. government has failed, including on common sense gun safety. It is unacceptable to place partisan politics above the safety of our children.
It is essential for local leaders to step up and take a stand on the issues affecting our community most. So many of the issues we grapple with here ‚Äì homelessness, community mental health, affordable housing, infrastructure ‚Äì are made worse by federal inaction.

, of lost wealth creation, and created an environment for a lack of trust. This gap in trust can only be addressed if we honestly recognize these actions of the past, are willing to discuss them, and take alternative actions to the best of our abilities to right these wrongs.
Portland has a very storied history of discriminatory practices that eliminated housing opportunity for many of our brothers and sisters of color. We know that the involuntary displacement and discrimination of entire communities resulted in a legacy of lost opportunity
"We have come some of the way, not near all of it. There is much yet to do.‚Äù These were the words shared by President Lyndon B. Johnson 50 years ago today. And these words still ring true, as we celebrate the passing of the Fair Housing Act of 1968.	https://t.co/wsdpHv1bqA

These three outcomes move the ball forward significantly as we work to ensure housing in Portland remains accessible and affordable.
This ordinance covers more renters under the policy by removing the exemption for landlords who only operate a single rental unit. And also lays the groundwork for a Rental Registration System, so that we can collect quality data on the city‚Äôs rental market.
This will make permanent an existing policy requiring landlords to provide relocation assistance to tenants they evict without cause or who cannot afford a double-digit rent increase.
This afternoon the City Council will take up a set of policies designed to protect tenants in an increasingly expensive housing market.
We are in a housing emergency and people are suffering. Rent increases and evictions have families in constant fear of displacement and even homelessness.

This work can‚Äôt be rushed and has to be done right. We have to consider the transportation impacts and avoid unintended consequences. But, we need to move on this idea quickly.
Today, I would like to announce that I am directing my bureaus to bring a proposal to Council by the end of 2018. This could include code amendments to increase FAR in the Central City.
At the same time, City Council is considering an amendment to include direction to City bureaus to find a way to increase the 3:1 cap on bonus FAR (Floor Area Ratio) in the Central City.
We already know that adding density in the Central City is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and Central City 2035 goals and policies and the new multimodal mixed-use areas designation from @oregondot.
We have an opportunity with the update to the Central City plan to potentially help this situation by adding incentives for new development and doing that as soon as we can.
We need to maintain this commitment to #InclusionaryHousing.  However, Inclusionary Housing can only produce affordable units if new development happens.
This is why I support channeling growth to areas where we planned for it, have the infrastructure in place to support it, and can provide the maximum benefit to the City while maintaining our neighborhoods.
Growth and change are happening and we‚Äôve all seen examples from around the country and nearby where these changes have been negative for some.
Our biggest plays are around height and density. That way we can pick off hundreds at a time and with #InclusionaryZoning we‚Äôre ensuring #affordability.
At a time when we have a housing affordability emergency and a commercial affordability problem ‚Äì we need to use every tool available to us to ensure the City grows, and we can maintain our quality of life ‚Äì that our people can afford to live here.
Meanwhile, the average number of people per household is getting smaller and households with children are expected to decline to 25 percent over the next 20 years.
#Portland is growing, and our housing needs are changing, nearly 123,000 new households are projected by 2035. This increased cultural and racial diversity and an aging population will certainly affect housing needs.
Looks good to me! https://t.co/yRO5WEziTe

.@Speakerryan You are asking Oregonians and Portlanders to give up the tools we have to combat a housing crisis and giving us nothing in return while expanding our Federal Deficit. 	https://t.co/XgjjDYWeat
Removing funds for Private Activity Bonds, the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program, The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, the New Market Tax Credits, and the Low Income Housing Tax is an illogical move during a homelessness and housing crisis sweeping our nation.
This is theft plain and simple.  A functional $12,000 tax increase for the average working Oregonian, with nothing in return for us but an expanded deficit and fewer tools to manage our housing and livability issues.	https://t.co/LbeSuTcXlv
Removing the SALT and property tax deductions penalizes hardworking Portlanders with an unnecessary tax increase that doesn‚Äôt benefit them while taking close to $8.5 billion out of Oregon and redistributing our wealth to the already wealthy.

We are looking forward to continuing the discussion of how to best serve our most vulnerable neighbors with all of us doing our part to address this issue as a community.
Many of the same reasons that make Foster-Powell such an attractive neighborhood are also the reasons why we believe this to be a good location: close to transit, job opportunities, SE Works &amp; WorkSource Oregon, PCC, community amenities and multifamily housing.
This site works well regarding Portland‚Äôs current finances and supportive operations.https://t.co/RlwrFop67s
We are addressing this humanitarian crisis with a consistent, comprehensive, balanced approach. The goal is simple -- to provide our neighbors with the help they need to get off and stay off the streets. That means more shelter beds distributed equitably throughout the city.
Homelessness threatens the dignity and safety of our communities‚Äô most vulnerable friends. At the same time, increased housing costs lead to housing insecurity, displacement, and places residents at risk of homelessness and poverty.
According to our Point in Time count of homeless neighbors, 368 people, roughly 22 percent of our unsheltered homeless population were counted in SE Portland between the Willamette River and 82nd Ave.

It‚Äôs irresponsible to conflate homelessness and crime. We can address safety issues with common sense enforcement. We can address homelessness with compassion. That‚Äôs our plan.
Homelessness is not a crime.
Wherever we have this debate, whether on the local news or among friends; we have to ensure our solutions recognize one essential truth:
As a city, we are facing difficult questions about livability. It's crucial that we make a sincere effort to have this conversation without demonizing our neighbors who are experiencing homelessness.

@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA @OCOMPDX @ugmpdx @PortlandMercado @mercycorpsnw I am strongly urging our Congressional Representatives, @RonWyden, @SenJeffMerkley, @RepBonamici, @repblumenauer, @RepSchrader, @RepPeterDeFazio, and @repgregwalden, to vote NO on the current #GOPTaxPlan and protect these important tools as the debate continues.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA The NMTC program has funded projects across the City of Portland that have delivered on neighborhood priorities, including @ocompdx, @ugmpdx, Albina Head Start, Oregon Clinic, @PortlandMercado, and @mercycorpsnw.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA Without New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) funding cut in the #GOPTaxPlan, Portland will lose a proven tool that not provides critical capital investment for projects in low-income, underserved communities that typically would not receive financing.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit helps revitalize buildings for multiple uses, including affordable housing, the #GOPTaxPlan cuts that too. @CCCPortland estimates that the loss of the credit could mean $12.5M over 5 buildings, impacting seismic retrofit projects as well.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA The Mortgage Credit Certificate Program is also removed via the #GOPTaxPlan, meaning close to 100 Portland families would lose the ability to claim a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for a portion of the mortgage interest paid per year, up to $2000.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA The #GOPTaxPlan is a direct threat to the budgets of local governments. The #SALT Deduction normally stabilizes of state and local revenues for providing public services. Removing #SALT disrupts our normal revenue structure harming our ability to fund critical services.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland @GFOA For context, the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office previously stated, Oregonians deduct about $5.9 billion in #SALT from their federal taxes and an additional $2.5 billion in property taxes, with those deductions for the average Oregonian working out to around $12,000.
@OCPPnews @CCCPortland The #GOPTaxPlan also takes away ability to deduct State and Local Taxes (#SALT) from your Federal Taxes. This is a giant step backward for the Portlanders (close to 40% according to the @GFOA) who take SALT deductions, leading directly to their #doubletaxation.
@OCPPnews In turn, losing the Low Income Housing Tax means up to 600 affordable units currently in the pipeline would not move forward and an untold number of future units. @CCCPortland contacted us to say this cut would mean a $4 million dollar loss over four buildings they maintain.
@OCPPnews Eliminating these bonds in the #GOPTaxPlan has an additional impact of doing away with the 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit for projects financed by PABs, making affordable housing construction even harder to pencil out or infeasible altogether.
@OCPPnews The #GOPTaxPlan eliminates Private Activity Bonds which provide special financing benefits for qualified projects affordable housing construction impacting the City‚Äôs plans to support the construction of affordable housing for our communities.
@OCPPnews Beyond outright promoting income inequity, the #GOPTaxPlan decimates important tools that PDX and other cities use to invest in affordable housing, infrastructure, and economic development. My top concerns with its effect on PDX are (fair warning this gets a little wonky) ...
According to the @OCPPnews, the #GOPTaxPlan is skewed to benefit only the wealthiest 1% Oregonians handing them receive a tax cut 40 times larger than the average Portlander. Any measurable benefit will shrink over the next decade for Portlanders while increasing for the 1%.
The #GOPTaxPlan is wrong for Portland and our Country. While we do need tax reform in our country, the current plan is needlessly cruel, heaping a burden on those that can‚Äôt afford it and will adversely impact the average Portlander.

Portland Climate Action Plan: 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and 80% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. We can beat these goals.
Today, Portland led on climate action, setting a goal to move our entire community to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
Dropping out of the Paris Accord is bad for our planet and our economy. After bad decision by @realDonaldTrump cities must lead the way.
