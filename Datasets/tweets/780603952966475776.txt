But some weren't as lucky as my friend. Here's a link to the story. It's odd to pray for people so far away in an armed forces that isn't one of our own country. Since my friend joined up, that still hasn't stopped me. https://t.co/bNaRsRsflJ
I guess what the point of this whole little thread is, please take a moment today to pray for everyone around the world in difficult situations or trying times. I pray every day for my friend to come home safe. He's like a brother to me. Was so relieved to talk to him today.
I reassured myself daily -- oh, that's just protocol. Funerals, whatever. It was. He's okay, thank god. But his 2 friends, weren't. He knew their names. One was 22, about to be married. I'll be withholding their names out of respect for my friend's privacy.
I messaged him on whatever I could, ensuring he's okay, and I was met with no reply. It was unlike him to be gone for that long. The new @Warcraft expansion just came out last week. He had been on basically every day to see the new stuff. After that happened, he wasn't.
A friend of mine who I've known for so long and become so close to from online is in the Brazilian military. Specifically at their military academy as a cadet (think West Point). On the 20th, 13 died in Rio. 2 of them, soldiers. I figured it wasn't him. But who can ever be sure?
It's rare I get too personal on Twitter, let alone tweet altogether, but today's a bit of an exception. Sometimes in the US we neglect what struggles the rest of the world gets into. Everything seems worlds away, but on the 20th, something came a lot closer to home.

@AyyBiggNoodle @wynnprogram Uses ad hominem and a sweeping generalization before closing her ears. Unsurprising.
@AyyBiggNoodle @wynnprogram I respectfully disagree that that's what this debate is over. My stance on abortion has nothing to do with regarding women with less value; it has everything to do with me valuing every life equally, including that of the child. Again, I value your opinion, but disagree with it.
@AyyBiggNoodle @wynnprogram Thanks, female? The argument for either side of the abortion debate is more on who's body it really is. You're entitled to think it's your own, I'm entitled to disagree. That's how debate works.
@AyyBiggNoodle @wynnprogram Fairly certain the ability or lackthereof to be pregnant has no impact on the accuracy of someone's stance on abortion, or, well, anything.
