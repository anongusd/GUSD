@Upson4WV @cvpayne Thank you for sharing that.  It's amazing and ironic how far from its original conception that the Republican Party has departed.  If it were the 1850's I would be Republican.  But Jill, this is not the 1850's anymore.  The Modern GOP is the one that is favored by the Alt-Right
@Jivo55 Jivo, why aren't you realizing that the investigation is ongoing and that even just yesterday another Russian was arrested, as more and more evidence is being uncovered?   Why are you trying to make it necessary for Muller to expose his findings before the investigation is over?

@DariusLowber @ToxicExplodley @Shelzzlove @liberal_resist @RealCandaceO Thank You, Paul Ryan.  So, Darius, so you agree or disagree with Paul Ryan?   Do you approve or disapprove of Trump expressing his loyalty to Russia by saying that he believes the words of Vladimir Putin.
No, Republicans, Vladimir Putin does not REALLY love you !	#TrumpIsATraitor https://t.co/6cGX1ytbK7
@cvpayne @Upson4WV It's not clear why you accuse Democrats of rewriting history while you are trying to make the untrue suggestion that the modern GOP is equivalent to the 1850 Republicans. Your claim is not true, it's not honest, yet you are groaning about others re-writing history while YOU do it
@cvpayne @Upson4WV Those are untrue misconceptions that you list.   Actually, I should say some are correct but some are incorrect.  Do you honestly know that they are incorrect but deliberately claiming them anyway, or do you really carry such gross misconceptions become of whom you've believed?
@ToxicExplodley @Shelzzlove @liberal_resist @DariusLowber @RealCandaceO Trump indeed was attacking Germany &amp; directed his insults to Germany, but NOT RUSSIA!  Just because Trump criticized Germany doesn't mean that Russia is innocent.  It's very strange that you're so worried about Russia's innocence because the investigation is for the USA, not Left
@IykeMbadiwe @RealCandaceO It is wrongful to say that the investigation is dividing the USA, when the mouth of Trump spews hatred and insulting expressions toward women, immigrants, other religions, descendants of African countries.  When Trump attacks people of his own country, it truly causes division.
@IykeMbadiwe @RealCandaceO Are you serious?  Would a Prosecutor expose strategy BEFORE the start of the Trial?  No, Iyke, that's not how it works.  The investigation is on-going.  Even yesterday another Russian was arrested.  There are more arrests and indictments expected in the near future.  Trump lies. https://t.co/w8XJR8Be1x

@IykeMbadiwe @RealCandaceO 4)  The goal of Russia was not to sway 62,984,000 Americans to vote for Trump (Clinton had 65,853,514), but to sway just a "handful" in certain "battleground" states that would result in winning the targeted electorial votes of those particular states.
@IykeMbadiwe @RealCandaceO Since then, Trump has never criticized Putin, Trump has been reluctant in sanctioning Russia, despite laws passed by Congress, has displayed weakness toward Putin, Trump was weirdly mild when Russia punished American Diplomats, and is doing Russia's bidding toward NATO &amp; Allies.
@IykeMbadiwe @RealCandaceO You're saying wrong things, Iyke.  1) The evidence of Russian manipulation is confirmed by MULTIPLE agencies.  2)  The agency preparing the report is not entirely of anti-Trump agents.  3) Even if anti-Trump agents worked, it doesn't change the truth of meddling. 4)  The Goal....
@IykeMbadiwe @proustaloo @RealCandaceO Iyke, you have no idea.  A HUGE population of voters felt so disgusted by misinformation campaigns, false rumors, and hysteria about HRC that led them to not vote.  Russians also concentrated specialized efforts in certain electorial districts.  Thus, Trump won with fewer votes.
@w_terrence @IykeMbadiwe Are you outraged or not ?	Are you a Hypocrite?	If this truly matters to you at all, then you should be extremely upset about what's happening CURRENTLY.

@BrownieKimber @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump You are telling a lie when you say that I am "completely" misguided.  Why are you doing that?   This makes 2 lies now.  In addition, a 3rd lie that you're telling is that you have "perfect ways" to eliminate voter fraud. You could be more truthful in just saying it can be reduced
@hapa_girl33 @MarkJMorris1 @starcrosswolf @NancyPelosi that's a lie.
@Petergo80209607 @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump No, Peter, your suggestion is not practical, or feasible, or useful.   Would you tell your child upon making a D, to look at the others making F's?   Just because other nations have worse dictatorships does not justify our nation creeping in that direction.  Keep standards high.
@Petergo80209607 @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump Peter, your behavior on Tweeter disappoints me.  Please don't consider yourself the only person to know that a Constitution &amp; Bill of Rights exists.  If you do, you are wrong.  Please don't think you are the only person that has studied history.  And don't be hateful or insulting
@cahtx01 @RepTerriSewell Stop hating
@Center_Right @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump Stop hating.
@BrownieKimber @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump No, Kim, it's either a misstatement or a lie that it "eliminates" voter fraud.  It may reduce it, but it's already such a minuscule &amp; negligible level. Everyone must be concerned about efforts of gerrymandering and efforts for restrictions on voting access for real Americans
@Center_Right @RepTerriSewell @realDonaldTrump The most profound question of our time is how we keep our Democracy from falling apart in an era of fake news, misinformation, false-info propaganda campaigns, partisanship, foreign hacking, and voter suppression through gerrymandering &amp; limited poll access &amp; Trump's Tweet-hating

@GayRepublicSwag While the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8 percent, tied for the lowest rate since 1969, the level of those falling out of the workforce has surged. The total of those counted as not in the labor force is now at a record 95.9 million, a 21 percent rise over the past decade.
@GayRepublicSwag It's an error to attribute: "First time in American history we have more open jobs than people looking for work" to Donald Trump. It's due to changes in demographics, an aging workforce &amp; the fact that employers are experiencing a mismatch in skills that employers are looking for
@GayRepublicSwag The person doing the poll probably has the plight of the babies being separated from their parents, in mind.  It is an awful traumatic experience for a child to be lost without their parents.  We cannot ignore what has been happening to them.  To be blind to their plight is evil.
@GayRepublicSwag "It bears pointing out that the jobless rate had already been on a steady decline since 2010. Further, unemployment hit a previous nine-year low of 4.6% in December 2016 when President Obama was still in office. It climbed back up to 4.8 % in January" ..... - Snopes Fact-Check
@eavesdropann @planobaby @DCClothesline But Republicans intend on abandoning the homeless Americans too, as they cut taxes for their wealthy friends and mega-corporations and eliminate programs that help disadvantaged people.  Trump has no use for Social Security, Medicare or even public schools, public parks, etc.
@GayRepublicSwag @planobaby But go ahead &amp; blindly follow your Leader.  He wants you to blame the media for the things he does, and you do exactly what he wants.  Trump wants you to continue to pretend that he's honest &amp; holy and he wants you to resent populations that don't look like you, perhaps even hate
@GayRepublicSwag @planobaby In some cases there are those who would retweet this &amp; do want to vote for Trump because they truly fit your descriptions.  Ever heard that actions speak louder than words?  If you dislike the "portrayal" then change your support for racist, sexist, homophobic policies.  Simple.
@planobaby Because Trump's loud talk of actual physical violence was much worse, or have you forgotten?  On the other hand, Rep Waters was encouraging people to be heard, to raise our voices, to protest against all the inhumane and greedy things that Trump does.  I hope you can understand.
@planobaby @PressGop @RealOmarNavarro Dearest Stefanie, I love you.  I don't hate. We see what's happening.  We're not blindly following policies.  You're mistaken if you think that.  We do object to Trump destroying the lives of children, by caging them, eliminating healthcare &amp; opportunities for post-sec education.
@blaubok @JohnMoralesNBC6 @RepCurbelo @mmfa If you think the Earth is in a static state or can never undergo changes, or that the human population on this earth (well over 7.442 Billion people) can't cause any effect, then you're likely to claim that there's a secret ploy to make rich people less rich &amp; poor people richer.
@RepCurbelo How do you like the way that Trump is traumatizing children.   Oh, wait, I don't know if your Tweet is a sincere one or not.
