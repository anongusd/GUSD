@KrrristinaaS @BrittPettibone That is absolutely correct. I guess that means we all lost in the Civil War.
@BrittPettibone @bakedalaska That's what I've been asking.
@amwellstead Especially since they're the ones who started all this.
@amwellstead Oh and the BLM and ANTIFA showed up too. Why aren't we hearing them about them on the mainstream media?
@amwellstead So did mine and the white supremacist were not invited to that event. They just showed up.
@Bigloser99 It was my understanding that Constitutionists organized the event. Then the George Soros people showed up.
@willthethinker Unite the right wasn't a racist event. Racists just showed up. Get your facts straight.

@GreenleeGazette if anyone were buying a cake for those reasons, Christians would be just as obligated to refuse the sale.
@GreenleeGazette Who buys a cake to celebrate divorce, remarriage, adultery or open marriage?
@GreenleeGazette No. But Gays are the only ones buying the cake with the INTENT on using it to sin.
@GreenleeGazette Most Christians have no problem selling usual wares. Cakes for Gay Weddings condone sin. Cakes for birthdays don't.
@GreenleeGazette yes they do. Most Christians won't sell alcohol.
@GreenleeGazette It isn't a matter of selling to non-believers. It's a matter of whether what is sold condones sin.
@dd83f9df6687420 Thank you!
