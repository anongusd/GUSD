9/ If this summit does result in a verifiable commitment from both sides to take step-by-step actions, on a specified timeline, I‚Äôll be the first applaud it. But if Trump blunders negotiations and gives up the farm for a photo op with Kim, Congress will not stand idly by.
8/ North Korea has a history of pretending to comply in order to get what it wants. It would be a catastrophe for Trump to sign a peace agreement, promise to withdraw troops, and give up all leverage while North Korea retains the capability to annihilate us or our allies.
7/ Trump's own intelligence experts concluded that North Korea's nuclear weapons program continued throughout the last year and that they remain "committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States."
6/ We know that's a possibility because that's exactly what happened at last year's summit. Trump lavished praise on Kim and halted important joint military exercises, without any meaningful commitment to denuclearization in return.
5/ These are tangible steps North Korea could take to roll back its nuclear program that would merit corresponding commitments from the US and our allies. But the danger lies in Trump making big concessions to Kim without anything substantial in return.
4/ Permanent dismantlement of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, with international monitoring. And finally, a verifiable cap on North Korea‚Äôs nuclear warheads and delivery systems.
3/ Next, a freeze on all weapons of mass destruction activities. Not just pausing nuclear tests - halting all enrichment activities, construction of new nuclear facilities, building of new missiles, developmental testing, and chemical and biological weapons programs.
2/ First, a signed joint declaration detailing a roadmap for continued negotiations, w milestones for verifiable progress, including firm dates for completion. The declaration should include a clear definition of the ultimate goal‚Äînot just vague references to ‚Äúdenuclearization.‚Äù
1/ üö®THREAD: the fact that Trump wants a deal so bad and is such a terrible negotiator should scare us all heading into the summit with Kim. So here‚Äôs a rundown of what Trump should be asking for from the North Koreans if we want a good deal.

Forgive me if I cast a tad of doubt on the humanitarian intentions of a President who locked little kids up in cages and tried to cut the State Dept by 40%. I draw issue w the method and bravado, not the aid. You can get food to Venezuela without inciting war. https://t.co/dgAyP8NlTt
In light of tonight's Venezuela thread, re-linking my longer piece with @brhodes. We argue that U.S. had legitimate interests in weakening Maduro. And we believe in democracy promotion in Venezuela. We just worry Trump is doing it very badly. https://t.co/IKtFEeMWKc
6/ And finally - and perhaps most importantly - go look up the 1947 Rio Treaty, It's a western hemisphere mutual defense treaty, and may not require a war declaration if Trump is legitimately coming to the defense of Colombia. Don't think the Venezuela hawks don't know this.
5/ Maduro is evil, and the U.S. should pursue a strategy to undermine him and prompt new elections. No one can defend what he has done to Venezuela. But it's quite a different thing for the U.S. to incite a civil war with no real plan for how it ends (sound familiar?).
4/ Senator Rubio rushed to tweet out reports today of Maduro allies firing into Colombian territory, warning that the "the United States WILL help Columbia confront any aggression against them." Venezuela ordered Colombian diplomats out in 24 hours, ramping up the crisis.
3/ I want aid to get to Venezuelans. But let's be honest - Venezuela didn't just lurch into humanitarian crisis. The aid is being sent there now as part of a regime change strategy. Many are hoping that it will be the match that lights a civil war against Maduro.
2/ First, so secret Trump has been talking up war with Maduro since 2017, when he repeatedly asked McMaster for a plan to overthrow Maduro. New McCabe book confirms Now, Trump says "all options are on the table" and Rubio objects to Senate resolution that forbids war.
1/ Democrats need to be careful about a potential trap being set by Trump et al in Venezuela. Cheering humanitarian convoys sounds like the right thing to do, but what if it's not about the aid? What if the real agenda is laying a pretext for war? Follow my logic for a second.
This NYT piece says plan is to "peacefully import foreign aid".  Not entirely true - some are using the aid to try to pick a fight. Article also says convoys are a "test" of Guaido's credibility. But he doesn't control anything - so what are we testing? https://t.co/ZgfwyV1jEw

Trump will play up negotiations w North Korea.		Yes, talking with North Korea is good. But so far, Kim has PLAYED Trump. We gave away joint military exercises, and Kim kept building his nuclear program. And instead of trying to weaken Kim, Trump declares his "love" for him.
Trump will pat himself on the back re Venezuela.		But nothing has happened in 2 weeks since he recognized Guaido. Military support for Maduro hasn't budged, and if Maduro survives, our feckless play makes us weaker.
Trump will claim he's weakening Iran.		Nope. Iran's economy IS weaker, but Europe is ignoring U.S. sanctions, keeping their economy afloat. Trump's DoD confirms Iran's ability to maneuver in Syria hasn't been compromised at all. And hardliners in Tehran are gaining strength.
Trump will say no one has been tougher on Russia than him.		Bull. He fawns over Putin publicly. He handed Syria diplomacy to the Kremlin. He's loosening sanctions on Putin's top oligarchs. He won't fight Russian propaganda. He pretends they don't manipulate our elections.
Trump will make some claim about ISIS as "defeated".		It isn't. Not by a long shot. They don't control territory (that's good), but there are still 30,000 fighters, and Trump has allowed Iraq to marginalize Sunnis again, setting the scene for an ISIS revival (that's really bad).

Finally, don't get me wrong - I support a U.S. foreign policy that cares deeply about democracy. I think we are better off pressing for political reform everywhere we do business or have interests, not just the place where the guy who controls the oil doesn't like us.
If Trump cared about consistency, he would make the realist case for intervention in Venezuela (getting rid of Maduro is good for the United States) rather than trying to pretend his Administration all of the sudden cares about toppling anti-democratic regimes.
U.S. foreign policy has always been a muddle of values-based and interests-based decisions. But Trump takes it to the extreme. No recent President has so enthusiastically embraced autocrats, making these occasional pro-democracy interventions so hard for the world to parse.
Strong men around the world are befuddled. The full power of American foreign policy came crashing down today on a dictator in Venezuela, two months after the full power of American foreign policy rallied to the defense of a dictator who chopped up a political opponent.

There are a million reasons why $5B for a wall is a ludicrous demand to shut down the government over.		But here‚Äôs maybe the best one: the 2017/2018 budgets gave Trump billions for border upgrades. He‚Äôs spent ALMOST NONE of it. 6%. 		How about spending the money you have first?
Uhhhh...you don‚Äôt know your own coordinator of the anti-ISIS campaign?		Over the past 5 years, no one has done more to put ISIS on its heels than Brett. We all know and rely on him.

So this is right, but the Kurds are such a strong (and therefore vulnerable) position in Syria bc U.S. pushed them to clear out ISIS and hold territory, but never cut a deal w Turkey for the Kurds' long term protection. Once again, lots of tactics, no endgame strategy. https://t.co/kaQZ79CDxC

Both of these can be true:		1. The way Trump is pulling troops out of Syria, with no notice and no new plan, is dangerous and makes America weaker.		2. The neo-cons vastly oversold the impact (and ignored the risks) of 2,000 troops, and pretended it was an actual Syria strategy.

4/ And our movement is now just as strong, if not stronger, than the gun lobby (more volunteers, more donors, more activists). Better to be with us than against us.  		Now, no going back after this turning point election.
3/ Now candidates realize that standing up to the gun lobby translates a value that voters crave - courage, toughness, a refusal to play politics with their kids‚Äô safety. 		Maybe you lose a few NRA members, but you pick up thousands of moms and dads
2/ For 5 years we have trying to make Democrats (and Republicans) become unafriad of the gun lobby, unapologetic in talking policy in the aftermath of mass shootings.
QUICK THREAD: Whatever happens tomorrow, 2018 will be looked upon as a pivot moment in politics of gun violence. 		In Florida, Georgia, Colorado, Texas, etc candidates finally figured out the only mistake you can make is to be too weak in your support of gun safety measures.

6/ Invest in democracy abroad. Don‚Äôt be so afraid to support civil society in autocratic states, and pump up support for fledgling democracies. Don‚Äôt overpromise like we did in Egypt - but don‚Äôt be scared of pushing self determination.
5/ End military sales to corrupt regimes overseas. Its not that we shouldn‚Äôt talk w despots, but we don‚Äôt need to prop them up with arms that often are used to killl civilians or end up in the hands of bad people.
4/ Demand congressional authorization for all overseas military engagements. Pull funding if a President - R or D - insists on making war without congressional consent.
3/ Massively scale up on non-military tools. For instance, new programs to fight Russian and extremist propaganda; robust energy independence fund for our allies; huge anti-corruption partnerships with developing democracies.
2/ End our reliance on our military to solve inherently political problems overseas. We keep sending troops to the Middle East and wonder why thugs getting worse. Military restraint IS a policy.

Even more timely now considering today's certification of the bombing campaign. Tune in everyone! https://t.co/EhSX2TpbwP
8/ Congress reaches a breaking point, says Trump must certify that Saudis are taking steps to protect civilians before continuing support.  Trump basically ignores the statute, and today certified that all is fine.  Ignore what see and read. Bombing campaign continues.
7/ This summer, civilian casualties hit record numbers, including an intentional bombing of a school bus loaded with children.  Saudis announced that they are going to launch assault on the main port for humanitarian supplies. Red alert time.
6/ Yemen becomes, according to UN, "the worst man-made humanitarian disaster of our time".  18 million cannot live without assistance,  7,600 killed, mostly civilians, and 42,000 injured.  World Food Program says Yemen exists "on the brink of famine."
5/ Then, the wheels start coming off.  Without a check from the U.S., Saudis start bombing more and more civilian targets, including water treatment facilities.  This sets off the world's worst recorded cholera epidemic - 1 million cases and counting.
4/ Trump comes in, makes Saudi Arabia his first foreign visit, and goes all in on Yemen.  Restarts targeting help and munitions sales, essentially gives Saudis a blank check to ramp up the military campaign.  Iran responds by going in deeper too.
3/ Iran came to the Houthis aid, and Obama pledged support to Saudis in the growing proxy war. But Obama grew concerned that the Saudis were bombing too many civilian targets, and started to pull U.S. back from the coalition.
2/ When the Houthis overtook the Saudi-backed government in Yemen, Saudis, with the UAE, launched a counter-offensive. A brutal civil war erupted, and Al Qaeda and ISIS took advantage, taking control of huge amounts of Yemeni territory, growing stronger than ever.
1/ The Trump Administration formally endorsed the U.S. backed bombing of civilians inside Yemen today. You need to start raising your voice on this - now.  If you need a quick primer why, read this THREAD

How lucky us chosen few were to count John McCain as a friend or a colleague or a mentor. How lucky America was to have him as as our inspiration, our rock. A masterclass in life, leadership and patriotism. I miss him already. https://t.co/29OLbaN2QH

@DineshDSouza Yes.
Brett Kavanaugh is an anti-consumer zealot, an opponent of preexisting condition protections, a critic of abortion rights and access to contraception, a Second Amendment radical, and a bad choice for the Supreme Court.		Not a close call.  I will vote NO.
The right wants the Supreme Court to strike down protections for people w preexisting conditions. 		Kavanaugh has the anti-ACA, anti-consumer pedigree to lead the charge. That‚Äôs a big reason why Trump picked him.
Brett Kavanaugh is a true Second Amendment radical. He believes assault weapon bans are unconstitutional, a position way out of the judicial mainstream, far to the right of even late Justice Scalia.
His answer is irrelevant. He was required to follow precedent on the Appeals Court. He won‚Äôt be on SCOTUS. Conservative Supreme Court justices have been busting up precedent left and right. He is being chosen to overturn Roe - plain and simple. https://t.co/7hSy3p7KFw

4/ Now U.S. must press Saudis/UAE to agree to UN administration of port, and end to bombing campaign. Trump team shows no signs of pushing Saudis/UAE at the negotiating table, but this is the key moment.
3/ U.S. told Saudis/UAE is would be difficult, they didn't listen.  Now they are bogged down, and seeking a pause/way out. Houthis (who don't have clean hands in this war) are willing to have UN come in an administer the port.
2/ Saudis/UAE launched attack on Hudaydah, the humanitarian port in Yemen. Long siege of this port could make existing famine look like child's play. U.S. is still helping with assault, despite universal opposition from humanitarian groups.

The lack of transparency from the Administration, and the lack of giving a crap from Republicans in Congress, is so deeply disturbing. These are little children - and their lives are being changed forever by this unspeakable trauma.
HHS‚Äôs excuse was that we need to give 14 days notice. What?? 14 days of forced separation from your parent can traumatize a kid for life. And we aren‚Äôt asking to see nuclear codes - we just wanted 10 min to make sure the child is ok.

I'm willing to hear Mike Pompeo out, but if the President is just looking for someone who will more efficiently and enthusiastically gut the State Department, this nomination should be a non-starter for Democrats.
Crazy, out of the box thought I just had - maybe a President with no diplomatic experience should stop picking Secretaries of State with no diplomatic experience.
My day:		First, Trump and Republicans handed over the keys to the school violence debate to the gun industry.		Second, my 6 yr old was locked in a tiny bathroom w his 24 classmates for their active shooter drill. "I didn't like it, Daddy" he said.		Sleep well tonight, colleagues.
Enough talk.  Enough plans. Let's have an open debate on gun violence on the Senate floor - NOW - and see what passes and what doesn't.  Then, let's take it to the voters in November and see what they think of how it all went down.
Sometimes even if a President pushes a bill, it can't pass. But lets be clear - if Trump included expanded background checks - something he says he supports - in his gun violence plan, and pushed it, it would pass.

Trump may not end up leading Congressional Republicans to water on guns, but his willingness to buck the gun lobby in public, rule out the NRA agenda, and talk up background checks, has changed this debate nationally.
Like they do on every other hot button issue, the White House is going to bob and weave on guns. Accept it. But Trump's instinct on this issue is not wrong - if his party doesn't get behind background checks soon, they're cooked in 2018 and 2020.

10/ Finally, double humanitarian aid. Still huge need to relieve suffering in and around Syria. Increase in refugee support to Jordan/Lebanon/Iraq ensures conflict is contained.
9/ Better leverage is a prospective Marshall Plan for Syria ‚Äì spend billions on reconstruction rather than on a military escalation that‚Äôs doomed to fail &amp; kill lots of Americans.
8/ And time to realize our leverage in diplomacy is not our military presence in Syria. Hasn‚Äôt worked so far bc all sides know we have less at stake militarily than other parties.
7/ U.S. must end our absence from peace talks ‚Äì stop outsourcing diplomacy to Turkey and Russia.
6/ This doesn‚Äôt mean disengagement. Tillerson should change his schedule and go to Israel on Middle East trip. Make clear we will support Israel‚Äôs ability to defend its borders, increase funding for Israel‚Äôs protection.
5/ The continued military conflict in Syria is inevitable and it will be years until it ends. But it will last twice as long if U.S. gets more directly involved in the combat. Our presence will raise stakes for others.
4/ U.S. failure to understand local political and tribal dynamics dooms any military mission ‚Äì just like Iraq (and Syria is much more complicated than Iraq)
3/ Now, presence of thousands of U.S. troops is dragging us more directly into the many conflicts playing out in Syria:		SDF v. ISIS	Israel v. Iran	rebels v. Asad/Iran/Russia	Turkey v. Kurds
2/ U.S. military half measures over past 4 years have badly exacerbated the war. Building up Kurds to fight ISIS drew in Turkey, weak support for Syrian rebels gave them enough to continue, not enough to win.
THREAD: 1/ As Syria unravels, time again to make case for why U.S. military involvement there (beyond destroying ISIS) makes things worse, while U.S. diplomatic, humanitarian engagement makes things better.

It's really simple. Republicans run everything and they cannot govern. All we want is for them to do their job - the stuff that was routine before they took over, like disaster funding, kids health insurance, an actual budget.
This continuing resolution was bad for Connecticut. No way I could vote for it. Giant funding cuts for community health centers, inadequate military funding, terrorizes immigrant kids.
Trump and Republicans refused to negotiate w Democrats, wrote a terrible bill, and now own this shutdown. Trump rooted for a shutdown, and now he got what he wanted. Bad night.

6/ Lesson is clear: voters care about gun policy now more than ever. Ds can receive a coequal bump to Rs, but only if they CHOOSE to turn people out on the issue.
5/ Why? Because Northam ran hard on guns (universal background checks, assault weapons ban). He didn't play cute or cozy up to the gun lobby.
4/ Of the 17% of voters for whom "guns" was the top issue in Virginia, 49% were Republicans and 49% were Democrats.  Motivated both sides.
3/ And guns drove Democratic and Republican turnout EQUALLY, contrary to the conventional wisdom that guns are a driver of Republican turnout only.
2/ After health care, guns was the second most important issue to voters who turned out yesterday. Mattered more than immigration, taxes, or abortion.
SHORT THREAD: 1/1 Yesterday's Virginia election shows that gun policy is just as big a driver of Democratic turnout as Republican turnout.  Game changer.

Background checks work. In states with universal checks, 47% fewer women are shot to death by their intimate partner.
ISIS is telling recruits to go to gun shows to buy weapons without a background check. Universal background checks = tough on terrorism.
Around 25% of gun transfers now happen without a background check. That means tens of thousands of criminals are getting guns every year.
