‚ÄúDelaware has experienced remarkable success working with federal agencies to conserve species, and we‚Äôve done so within the framework of the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. @USFWS and Delaware both helped restore habitat for Piping Plovers and Red Knots‚Äù - @SenatorCarper
‚ÄúStates and the federal government cannot solve our wildlife funding problems alone: This has to be an all hands on deck effort. Tribes, private landowners, non-profits and other stakeholders have stepped up, and we need to make sure they can continue to do so.‚Äù -@SenatorCarper
‚ÄúCurrent rates of species extinction are up to 1,000 times the natural rate of extinction. Once species are gone, they are gone forever. We must act sooner rather than later to address this extinction crisis by developing a comprehensive wildlife funding strategy‚Äù -@SenatorCarper

Sometimes disagreements between wildlife managers and stakeholders result in litigation, particularly around beloved predatory species. These disagreements are unfortunate, but judicial review remains a necessary part of the #EndangeredSpeciesAct - @SenatorCarper
