The question obviously is how much Democrats make their 2018 midterm platform about The Russia Thing (which is corruption-related but only partly) and Trump Being Mean versus the fact that he and his friends appear to actually, straight-up, be using the government to get richer.
Pew data from earlier this year shows that yes, people still really do give a shit about money on politics and‚Äîinsane though it may sound‚Äîthey think new laws could help address it.
That could create a feedback loop where the stuff that normally resonates for about five minutes on politics twitter actually seeps into the broader consciousness, setting up Republicans for more resignations and more scandal in 2020.
Key thing to keep in mind here, as originally teased out by this nifty piece at Slate, is that even if Democrats barely win a House majority, they can start blowing up Trump's spot left and right thanks to committee power: https://t.co/ixukgpGfno
