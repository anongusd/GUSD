@secupp @phelps_nancy @CNNPolitics I will love to know if Trump win, will you vote for him.
Raleigh north Carolina! Police officer shoot and kill a black male! Report said that the suspect were shoot 6 times in the back. #NotGood
@DanaBashCNN @VanJones68 I can't wait for you guys to pin Trump down on the ISSUE that the country and the world are facing. Not just FLUFF
@ezraklein @voxdotcom That guy is a JOKE!
Tom delay said that the RNC can give the nominee to anyone but TRUMP, despite Trump leading with the most delegates! Not that Will be Crazy
@secupp looking nice with the red  however do you think Trump is expanding your party.
@secupp what is going on with the Republican party.
Am not so sure who the  beter candidate for the GOP. Trump is a bigot and Cruz is just straight Radical. # Scarry!!!
Big night for Trump &amp;Hillary. This is going to be a year of bad blood between these two! Can't wait to see the debate.
Trump said that he will get the mojority of black and Hispanic voters. Does he think people stupid or what. #NotAtAll
This guy! JEFFREY LORD! Said that Trump look presidential tonight during  his speech. #Really
Trump married 3 time to 3 foreign women and no one call his kids ancho baby!#justsaying!
Rubio&amp;Cruz parents both came to the United States illegally . Now they talking about sending Hispanic people back where they came from!#Smh
So Bernie Sanders is an independent, I would like to know why does  he want to run as a Democrat. He should run as an independent.
@angela_rye @lafloran @POTUS Totally agree with you! I believe as people we need to take responsibility for our actions and help others.
Ok Mr Trump was live on meet the press and he was asked about David Duke  the kkk. Mr Trump said he doesn't even know who that is. #Really !
@kourtneykardash how are you spending your Saturday. I always thought that you were so real and very caring!
Sanders is a independent! Not a DEMOCRAT! #LetNot4GetThis!!!
Hillary Clinton will be victorious when it's all over!!
@secupp @secupp great point! I do believe hillary win do much better with independent voters if she become the nominee.
@katiecouric It was like Kid&amp;Play! No respect for each others! #GOPDebate
Trump said that he is being audit because he is a Christian!# Really Trump!So Fake!
The lack of experience shows in the GOP debate tonight!
The lack of experience among the 3 top guys are so SAD! #GOPDebate
So much disrespect to nigh in the debate!  #GOPDebate
How can any reasonable person watching this debate understand anything with all the bickering! NotGood4TheGop!
@JoeNBC I totally agree! There is no respect among each other .
Wolf are having a tough time with these KIDS#ChildsPlay!
This debate is a JOKE!  These guys are so not ready to be THE COMANDER &amp;CHIEF #KID&amp;PLAY
@secupp I watch you on CNN a lot and am becoming a fan, because you give your opinion with facts not just one sided.#Respect !KeepItUp!
I hope that the press/media start to get real with Donald Trump and ask him policy questions. # budget # dealing with ISIS! foreign policy!
Lets get real folks, if the president comes down to Hillary vs Trump,there is no doubt that Hillary Clinton will be victorious .
This political cycle is one like no other! Am watching Jeb Bush supended his campaign in South Carolina! # FAILURE!
While I like Bernie, I believe that he needs to talk about more than just one ISSUE! Everyone knows that the president has to multi task!
@soledadobrien @jonkimball if Bernie takes a beating in the SEC he should  get out.
@soledadobrien @jonkimball The rest of the country does not reflect Iowa and New Hampshire,  therefore Bernie will struggle .
@jonkimball @soledadobrien I totally agree with you! @jonkimball!
This speech that hillary is giving is focus on we, as the people and not 'I '!
@davidaxelrod @HillaryClinton Right on message!@davidaxelrod #RealStuff
@soledadobrien @jonkimball A win is a win!Now is time for South Carolina and on to the SEC! !
Congrats on the win! @HillaryClinton #Pushing4Ward!
Am loving Hillary Clinton win right about now!
@DanaBashCNN @DavidChalian @CNN Give Hillary her respect today and stop trying to find something negative to say! @CNNPolitics
The long wait is over! Roy Cooper will not only challenge for the Governor ship of North Carolina, but he will be the next visionary.
@mj_lee @CNNPolitics Trump is good for the GOP debates because he keeps everyone on their P's &amp; Q's.
@mj_lee @CNNPolitics Trump love to fire people!
Oh wow!!The Republican now just realizing how important women are after Trump disrespectful comments about Megan Kelly! #2Late
@vlevy2 you son has good taste!#MissAmerica
@FleurDeLaDay you are so right!
Mis mass will win it all!
