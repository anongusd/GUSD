I continue to follow implementation of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which overwhelmingly passed Congress &amp; became law in August. As our November elections approach, we must bolster our cyber defense capabilities and punish those who violate them.
These actions send a clear message that our electoral system is not to be tampered with, and the United States will respond when we or our allies are attacked.
Russian individuals &amp; entities have engaged in long-running, coordinated &amp; malicious attempts to influence and disrupt our American elections &amp; political system—and they must be punished. I welcome the administration taking steps to implement the congressionally-passed sanctions.

It is time those involved pay the price. I welcome these indictments and the demonstration of the due process provided by our judicial system that is systematically denied to Russian citizens.
Our law enforcement and intelligence services confirm that Russian individuals and entities have engaged in a long-running effort to interfere in our electoral process in a malicious attempt to undermine our democracy and discredit the United States on the world stage.
Our American style of democracy is the envy of the world and must be protected from foreign attack in all its forms. Consumed with their own power, the Russia kleptocracy has made it clear they hate the free and fair choice of the people to choose their leaders.

WATCH my take on the #SOTU: https://t.co/JsYZ8kLkhe
Following speech, giving #SOTU reaction to @BenBradleyABC7 https://t.co/z0ki4Qigwr
President laid out a clear choice: Americans should decide whether they want 4 more years of government intrusion, or a new direction. #SOTU
One thing we agree on: America is a great nation. American is still a country where if you work hard you can earn your success. #SOTU
Glad President mentioned law enforcement. My highlight is hosting Deputy Tyler Johnson who saved a woman who almost drowned in her car.
We want better politics, Mr. President, but instead of working w/people's reps, you've gone around them &amp; trampled our Constitution. #SOTU
I've been to Guantanamo Bay, and I say we need to keep it open: https://t.co/DSWONWrCzp #GITMO #SOTU
What I haven't heard in #SOTU: A plausible plan to bolster our national security and rebuild our depleted military.
I agree we must continue to forge relationships built on trust, common goals and understanding with nations across the globe. #SOTU
I agree: we must go after terrorist networks. We must not underestimate that threat, Mr. President. Americans certainly don't. #SOTU
Mr. President, more government regulations are not the answer to our sluggish economy. #LastSOTU #SOTU
Cut red tape? Just last year, President eclipsed his personal 2010 record by issuing over 82,000 pages of regulations on Americans. #SOTU
Fact: Healthcare premiums for some in Illinois are going up &gt;30%. We need #StateOptions. #SOTU
I agree hardworking American families are being squeezed. But President's solution? Always more government. #LastSOTU
We're working to restore a confident America -- where people are empowered to make their own decisions &amp; pursue their own dreams. #SOTU
Ours is focused on empowering people and opening America up to new futures with solutions that are driven from the bottom-up. #SOTU
One is a future that is driven by the status quo, by top-down, intrusive policies. #SOTU
President is laying out the choice for the American people – a choice between two different futures. #SOTU

@MikePrezioso Agreed, that's why the House has acted several times to fix weaknesses in our security. For example: https://t.co/6ujsz1aCtx
We must refocus our efforts on finding and plugging security gaps, while remaining a refuge for those fleeing persecution. (6/6)
Terrorism must be fought head-on with strong but smart and constitutional methods. (5/6)
Singling out any faith community is a distraction from our efforts to truly increase the security of our nation. (4/6)
Singling out any faith community for the actions of extremists is not conservative &amp; it is hostile to our founding. (3/6)
This foundational freedom protected by our Constitution is the basis of our society and inherent to human dignity. (2/6)
Legitimate national security fears have led into proposals that violate a fundamental constitutional principle: freedom of religion (1/6)
Visa waiver reforms are responsible way to fix security weaknesses while respecting our fundamental principles. https://t.co/6ujsz1aCtx

My thoughts on @SpeakerBoehner: http://t.co/kLN1QprjrF
In an historic address, #PopeFrancis brought the message of ‘hope and healing, of peace and justice’ to America &amp; its representatives.
From his servant’s heart #PopeFrancis called all of us to care for the poor, the sick, and everyone at all stages of life.
I was most struck and encouraged by #PopeFrancis's emphasis on the family, the building block of our society and our great nation.
#PopeFrancis called America a land of opportunity. We need to take up his call to make sure it remains a place for everyone to succeed.

Based on what we’ve seen already, I am concerned this agreement is a setback for American and global security. #IranDeal
I will look closely at the terms of the agreement over the next 60 days to determine how prudent this #IranDeal is.
This #IranDeal seems to rely on short-term rewards for Iran without long-term security assurances reasonable people would expect.
We'll need to review #IranDeal, but so far I have deep reservations about whether it's in best interests of our national security.

As #2016budget process continues, I hope Prez works w/Congress to pursue real solutions, but not on the backs of stretched family budgets.
Every American first should know how every tax dollar is spent before another dollar is added to our nation’s debt. #2016budget
Refusing to consider any budget that doesn’t increase spending (in essence, a veto threat) isn't how legislative process works. #2016budget
President's #2016budget makes no effort to cut programs or rein in entitlement spending.
It's more of the same tired formula: add billions in increased federal spending, &amp; raise taxes to pay for it. #2016budget
I am disappointed w/President’s budget that refuses to accept that the federal govt must stop spending more than it takes in. #2016budget

Something we agree on, Mr. President: Illinois is "a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities" #SOTU
Respecting human dignity means the dignity of everyone, born and unborn. #SOTU
Maintaining a strong defense to fight terrorism requires we aren't burdened by too much debt. #SOTU
