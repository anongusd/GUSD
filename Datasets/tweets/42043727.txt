@BarbaraRedgate @JosephJFlynn1 @GenFlynn He needs to tell the country what the Obama administration was so afraid of. Why did he need to be framed and discredited?
@Can2geterdone @sxdoc Coup-Rod
@RepStevenSmith Sater is FBI. Every Russian in this frameup was sent by Obama. Why won’t you say that?
@MarkDice Remember the year they hated Trump so much he canceled because they were going to make a scene and walk out of his speech? They are not good at spotting talent.
@seanmdav @lukerosiak Why should Lanny be ashamed? He works for Clinton. Duh.
@ScottAdamsSays Got a rejection letter saying GiantRichCompany decided against hiring me and will not give me any feedback as to why I didn’t get the  job. Then I received a survey asking for feedback on GiantRichCompany’s hiring process.
@JosephJFlynn1 @davidbcrumbs @GenFlynn @BarbaraRedgate Did u know that House Democrats threatened House Inspector General Theresa Grafenstine with Logan Act violations? They wanted to discredit her because of what she knew about the Awan scandal. @GenFlynn needs to reveal what they are so scared of.
@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco If you’re talking about Mitt Romney it’s because the FBI successfully entrapped him and he is compromised. Think Obama’s FBI only played dirty with Trump?
@MichaelRCaputo They even brought Mueller in to cover for them. See a pattern here? https://t.co/FMVYKm8rIr
@TheNoahRing Sarah Sanders.
@ScottAdamsSays Interesting that this comes out when Trump's rating are soaring with suburban women.
@MichaelRCaputo @FBI Guess you haven't heard of Whitey Bulger.  Boston FBI was completely corrupt so I don't know who these "rest of them" are.
@catturd2 What trap did Obama's FBI ensnare Romney in? Trump wasn't the first!

RT @GenChuckYeager: You won't believe it. I don't believe it myself - 96 today.  How to live to 120? Live to 119 and then be very very care…
@horowitz39 @kyleraccio You forgot framing an American president for treason.
RT @DennisDMZ: Looks like Northam's career as Governor has been terminated in the 55th week. #DennisMillerOption
@StoneColdRoger Mueller has a history of covering up when the FBI frames somebody.  https://t.co/wfHSkQgQLx
Mueller has experience covering up when FBI gets caught framing people. https://t.co/wfHSkQgQLx

@catturd2 Boston FBI was completely corrupt and let innocent men go to jail and die there.  Stole 30 years of their lives. Mueller was in on it. https://t.co/jF4vdakBlB

@benshapiro How many years did helping "Mrs." Clinton cheat in a debate set you back?

@brithume Did they offer Flake a job? Was that what the democrats gave?
@RepJoeKennedy Somebody doesn’t remember the William Kennedy Smith trial. Every member of your family supported the  rape victim being raked over the coals. Lol
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump Can someone tell the GOP that having a fat, old white man drown out a conservative woman's voice is not a way to attract female votes?
RT @ArthurSchwartz: Thank you to whoever created this. https://t.co/Myxo94t3YW
@AnnCoulter @BreitbartNews I read that Rosenstein is running everything. Sessions confirmed this when he said he recused himself based on what others in the justice department told him.  He couldn't be bothered to read the regulations and got conned  into recusing himself.
@tedcruz @miller_gwen Might be helpful if your endorse DT 2020. There may be no coming back from your televised 2016 RNC suicide.
@tedcruz You both supported Hillary Clinton.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump How about the FBI payments for the dirty dossier?
@KatTimpf Then I’m sure you will support giving your job to an immigrant just like the people in my industry did involuntarily!  Or, is being replaced by cheaper labor just for the forgotten people?
@BreitbartVideo Why would anyone listen to a Never Trumper?
@CNNPolitics Does CNN pay you as a frequent contributor?
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Ryan's wife was a democrat staffer and lobbyist.
@RepLeeZeldin Why do all you elected officials act like you're not part of the problem?  Why are you not ordering the handcuffs? Don't give me excuses.
@JacobAWohl Selling his vote for a contract? He needs to be investigated.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Was the Russian lawyer at the Trump Tower meeting working for the FBI? She was let into US by DOJ under “extraordinary circumstances” .
@TGowdySC So, the leaks that seem to happen whenever Trump has a good day don't bother you? You didn't say "it’s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law.”?
@stateFarm  won't help me get a rental car or pay my deductible.  I was hit by debris and the moron was cited. Kicking myself

@HowieCarrShow @CarlyFiorina You called it Howie!  Watching Luntz now.  How does this guy keep a job?
@StateFarm My parked car got hit and now I have to call the other insurance company and beg for a rental car.  Thanks.
