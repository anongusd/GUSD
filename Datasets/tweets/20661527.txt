Still love movies in spite of some moviemakers who sometimes seem determined to cure that.
HOW has there never been a movie simply titled KAIJU?! IMDb doesn't list one.
Abby! RT @Superherologist: Hey, there's @AbbyDarkStar in a @HeroesOfCosplay commercial during a @Warehouse13 rerun. Very cool.
Well, I greatly disliked Amazing Spider-Man 2, so I would say that pretty much anything is more worth seeing than it :P @BobT854
Well put! I agree completely. @Furbysbadday
YES. The payoff in act 3 is spectactular. @RevEnFuego @OverlordOf_Evil
Same. I get that they were building drama, but after a certain point I started to resent humans for taking Big G's screen time @Jahilianaire
Very much so. @rvgenaille
Waiting for the Big G full reveal gives incredible drama to him, but I think #Godzilla could have been 15-25 mins shorter. @OverlordOf_Evil
#Godzilla sure is light on his feet for such a big fella. Sure knows how to kick some ass, too :D
Better TITLE (different issue from better movie) "Let the Right One In" or "Let Me In"? Which sounds better? Which suits the story better?
They're your fingers. Sure thing. RT @nailbiter111: @ActionChick @AgentsofSHIELD can i give a high four?

People keep saying to use Kickstarter's embed code. Kickstarter embed code IS iframe. We're trying to embed WITHOUT iframe. Thanks, though.
We're still looking for simple, non-iframe, non-plugin way folks can embed Kickstarter (whose embed code is iframe) videos in WordPress.
I keep reading that WordPress has a problem with iframes when you still need to keep editing the idea. The iframes often vanish.
RT @khkshimabukuro: Personal reactions to impact of comics http://t.co/qcG0VbAS @ActionChick @feliciaday @JimLee
If code like "[youtube http://t.co/H3BPPej8¬†‚Ä¶]" lets us embed video in WordPress, seems like non-YouTube videos should have equivalent code.
A lot of plugins will play video, but every additional plugin slows a site &amp; creates additional risk of plugins screwing each other up.
Trying Add Media with the video's url just created a link but didn't embed, @DoubleSixx. Yes, latest version of WordPress.
Kickstarter embed code is iframe, @bloggista. WordPress is buggy about iframe. That's why we need alternate method. Thanks, though.

#twittertip Make your public tweets worthwhile not only for the 1 to whom you tweet, but to others who happen to see them.
Actually, @BranVanChemist, a person could copy &amp; paste part of someone else's protected tweets while replying. Paster's followers can see.
#twittertip Each tweet has the potential to be seen by thousands, even if your account is protected.
#twittertip Deleted tweets still exist online, not just in email notices. Deleting to clean unpleasantness from timeline is still good.

With WordPress, what's the difference between .org and .com? Looks like people get very testy toward those who ask questions to the wrong 1.
Hello, newcomers! #twittertip Add profile &amp; pic, and tweet a bit before following strangers so we can see what you're like.
#twittertip See who your own followers tweet with. You might enjoy following &amp; interacting with those people too.

No, TweetDeck can't keep up with me. RT @mrbhill: @ActionChick Do you use any 3rd party apps like tweet deck for example?
#twittertip Instead of #FF lists, retweet the stuff that makes people worth following. Include original tweets so we might RT YOU.
Most #FF is background noise people ignore. I'm interested in who you interact with.
Among reasons I rarely #FF any more. RT @mrbhill your recommendations on who to follow must be skewed from your interests
When 150+ RT'd &amp; almost as many fav'd "How do you like your possum?" I followed them as people who share an interest (Walking Dead) &amp; humor.
I follow people friends are interacting with &amp; people tweeting about topics on my mind. They may or may not take an interest in me.
Yeah, I don't just passively follow those who follow me, @Shadow__Creeper. I want a more interesting timeline than that.

*shrug* I get asked that a lot. No simple answer. RT @autocratik		@ActionChick but how did you get so many followers? ...
1 reason I like late night tweeting RT @foczyzie		@DK745 often miss tweets. Not so much at 12:00 am when few people are up, but still...
Been weeding bots to keep my name off their follower lists. I don't want to set a bad example for those who would click bots' links. AUGH!
Weeding out bots is another matter, @frankjonen. I actually find them interesting &amp; didn't mind them too much until around 100K followers.
Weeding out hasn't been as hard as I expected it would be, @frankjonen. A big part is unfollowing those who quit tweeting months ago.
3. I use private lists when I want to look only at the tweets of people who have interacted with me. Lists take maintenance, though.
2. I like looking at the big, crazy timeline. Until I followed over 30-40K, I couldn't see as much about what Twitter looked like overall.
Before I reached 100K followers last year http://t.co/jdISqzWD I followed at about 90% but started weeding out. Didn't want to follow 100K+
1. @EdwardJOlmos takes the view that people who take an interest in you deserve to feel appreciated themselves. So he follows most.
Can't keep up with 150K followers or the 60% I follow. So why follow that many? Several reasons.
"Keep up"? No. RT @JezebelSpike: Well there is no way you could keep up to date with us all unless...you're not a bot yourself are you?
I'm good, you're good. Bot-free and probably human. RT @emmacaulfield: @ActionChick I'm here, so you're good. x
Wave of bots making it hard for me to check out all the new followers. I hate failing to follow interested &amp; interesting humans.

How do you like your possum?
I would fail SO many "litmus tests" for "true" geeks &amp; nerds. So would most people. "You've never seen (blah blah blah)?!"
I've known those who say, "That's too geeky," while trying to corner a geek market. RT @shinyswoots $$$ - that's what that is all about.
RT @TiredFairy: And assumptions about women in nerdspaces, full stop. And we have plenty of real world examples of its poisonous effect.
That said, though, some disdain nerds while trying to take the market for nerdy things. Did the "cool kids" table run out of seats for them?
That crap figures into stupid attacks on those who dare to blend geeky + sexy, @TiredFairy, &amp; weird double standards for any geekgirls.
The growth of "They'd reject us, so we need to reject them" is disturbing in many ways, @TiredFairy.

Boba Fett should be 1 of the 1st characters seen in Ep. 7, @Daniel_Logan, maybe finding something &amp; then contacting mystery employer @ it.
Star Wars Ep. 1-6 storyline is not, first and foremost, about the rise &amp; fall of the Empire. It's about rise, fall, &amp; rise of Skywalkers.
Without Original Trilogy characters, it wouldn't be episode 7, @thenoahdorsey. It would be a completely different Star Wars Universe story.
