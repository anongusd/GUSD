@therrienv @loverofsnark @shannon_last @MollyJongFast Congress created this problem by incentivizing illegal immigration.  If an adult could enter with a teddy bear, there would suddenly be a proliferation of stuffed animals coming.  Children are used and discarded.  The real problems of the countries are overshadowed by human graft

@richshillitoe @_Caulaincourt_ @_peterprinciple @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I support open borders or enforcement of laws.  I say you are racist because the  unchecked trafficking of those seeking asylum are caused by unenforced policies.
@richshillitoe @_Caulaincourt_ @_peterprinciple @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Most illegal immigrants that we know about.  You can't count what you don't find.  Cartels use coyotes and victims to carrubdrugs over unsecure areas.  They leave some behind to hold up border patrol.  You support that? How many of those are Ok?
@richshillitoe @_Caulaincourt_ @_peterprinciple @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I say deport anyone here illegally, don't allow any benefits and open the borders to assign numbers.
@richshillitoe @_Caulaincourt_ @_peterprinciple @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I am racist for wanting to stop human trafficking across unsecured borders?

@Americandialog Yet, we have job growth that many thought would never happen.   Daughter was put out of business with Steel tariffs, yet now domestic steel making  comeback and she is back at work. I don't have answers, just open to alternative solutions
@Americandialog I am sure many see him as personal gain.  I would encourage you to identify good as well as bad happening in the administration.   No president is all one or the other, except maybe (Reagan üòâ). Thanks for your comments
@Americandialog I have concerns with HC.  private email server,  Benghazi,  DNC server. Iran deal, Uranium 1.  I don't support blind allegiance,  and I try( often fail) to engage dialogue.
@Americandialog The continued targeting of businesses and associates.
@Americandialog The investigation and the wall have been distractions in my opinion.   Chinese intellectual property rights and the war in Yemen?  40 years of trafficking across our border, and Congress has laws they refuse to enforce?
@Americandialog The number of accusations make me suspicious.   I have witnessed good people undergo these tactics and been labeled social pirahiahs with no evidence.   I support due process. We are not perfect, yet we can educate ourselves.
@Americandialog Congress gave national emergency powers to executive branch and they can remove it just like ear powers act.  Judicial branch will make a decision.   That is the way it works and why we still have a free country. We made it through when Jackson ignored Scotus ruling as well.
@Americandialog I support the office of the president. (All of them)  I read and watch views from all perspectives to gain insight. I interact with people who have alternate views.  The constitution is strong.  The founding fathers knew we would face different challenges.

@lionqueen1952 @Conortwalsh @kurteichenwald I hope that American citizens can come together and stop allowing media and Congress to divide us. It's an old tactic to keep us divided allows them to deflect the blame on to the other party. This is a nonpartisan issue of National Security and Humane treatment of migrants.
@lionqueen1952 @Conortwalsh @kurteichenwald I work with these who are trying to stay in the shadows until an amnesty is provided. I agree with more judges and humanitarian assistance. The section 227 in the last bill will further the hole that cartels have on amnesty claims using our own laws against us.
