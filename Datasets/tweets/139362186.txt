As I previously reported, cops have used the dead's fingerprints to unlock iPhones https://t.co/esw7IKPTOg		That's one advantage Face ID appears to have over Touch ID...		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
Oh and in case you were wondering, yes police have tried to use dead people's faces to unlock their iPhones.		In New York, narcotics cops have tried to do so on iPhone X devices belonging to heroin overdose victims. It hasn't worked.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
Yet there remain questions around Fifth Amendment protections and whether this technique should even be allowed.		If the law allows you to say no when cops ask you to cough up a passcode, why is it different when they demand your face unlock the device?		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
But feds are now using boiler plate language in search warrants permitting them to force suspects to open iPhones with Face ID.		Just like forcing people to use their fingerprints to unlock devices, this will become normalized.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
The suspect's lawyer says the cops wanted to use Cellebrite but hadn't been successful in getting data.		Ultimately, it's unclear if the forced facial recognition unlock was in any way useful.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
The agent, writing in the affidavit, says local cops have access to tools that can unlock locked iPhones.		So it looks like Ohio feds and local cops either have GrayKeys, or Cellebrite tech that can do that. Or both.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
Whilst the suspect's iPhone X is opened via Face ID, for whatever reason the FBI agent doesn't keep the device open so it can be properly searched by forensics technologies.		He may've blown his chances of getting a whole load of valuable info. But...		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
They find Michalski, get his iPhone and have a warrant that requires him to hold his face up to the iPhone X to unlock it. 		So that's what happens, but it doesn't go as smoothly as you might think for the cops...		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
An investigation into that suspect's online activity leads the cops to a contact, determined by the feds to be Columbus, Ohio resident Grant Michalski.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
Per a search warrant:		After they find each other on Craigslist, the suspect ends up going into some detail with the undercover cop about his interests over Wickr. 		He then starts sending sexually explicit photos of a minor to the undercover cop.		https://t.co/BdXRWLeLpK
There's a lot going on here, and it's a disturbing case, so I'll do a thread.		So, the case starts when an undercover cop posed as a dad interested in "taboo" subjects.		An individual, who later became a suspect, got in touch to say they had similar  interests... https://t.co/Q5vOIYF6DQ

Hi. I write for @forbes on surveillance, cybercrime and privacy.		I want to hear about people and companies doing scary/evil/unconstitutional things.		Tip me via Signal at +447837496820.
Attorney also says if she’d known about the order on Google, and her client had gone to trial, she would’ve been all over it.		“Bottom line, when an investigation violates the Constitution, the evidence can’t be used at trial.”		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
Update here - the lawyer for the guy who was convicted of the crimes said she didn’t know about the FBI demand for Google data until yesterday. 		She told me: “It is mind-blowing that the federal government believes this is not a blatant violation of privacy.” https://t.co/0b49oeh3QY
Can anyone validate this? https://t.co/4BqMJHm6ZL
An unprecendeted spelling of unprecedented has been corrected		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
Oh and I made a little map showing the areas where the FBI asked Google to find users and hand over their personal data: https://t.co/vfeGmF4Nrq
More here on similar things happening in North Carolina: https://t.co/Apq1nLuome		And here's that AP report on Google location tracking ICYMI: https://t.co/qtxDSgRGPQ
This kind of surveillance is called a reverse location search. Gov gives a tech company an area in which it wants info on all users, in the hopes of finding suspects. 		It's completely unclear how they prevent innocent people getting caught out.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
Given the AP feature showing how difficult it is to stop Google storing your location data, this kind of government surveillance becomes even more worrisome.		The FBI thinks it has a right to that info, even if innocents' data gets harvested too.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
The main takeaway? 		The FBI is getting judges to sign off on warrants that allow them to get Google user information, including names, addresses and location, without even knowing who they're looking for across wide areas of land.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
Now, most of the locations are far enough apart that it's unlikely any innocents would've been caught up in the data grab -- the FBI wanted info on Google users at 2 of the 9 locations of the robberies.		BUT 2 of the locations were less than 500m apart.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
They also get location data from an unnamed source. 		And they get toll records for the suspect's work van. 		Ultimately, they didn't even need the Google data but put in their request anyway.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
First off, they find some footprints in the snow and match it to an Under Armour sneaker. 		Amazingly, a discarded Under Armour shoe finds its way into the FBI's hands. They match the DNA on the shoe to the DNA of the suspect.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
So the FBI keeps filing motions to extend the warrant, right up until last week.		The feds appear to just give up waiting on Google.		Earlier this month, a suspect pleads guilty and the FBI reveals it used multiple other surveillance methods to catch him.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
The government also slaps a gag order on Google, preventing it from disclosing the data request to anyone.		Over the coming months, Google just doesn't respond with the data. It doesn't appear to file any response at all, in fact.		https://t.co/2kcufRvpNo
This is an insane case, so I'll start a thread. 		Here's what went down:		A spate of armed robberies hit at least nine locations in Portland, Maine, in March.		The government orders Google to find all users who were within 2 of 9 locations, covering a total of 45 hectares... https://t.co/1BzwteeXe1

@BergerofLondon Ah crap, didn't make public. Changing now.
Probably the only interesting thing there is the amount of deleted data Cellebrite can recover. Something that the average user probably doesn't know is possible.
In case you were wondering what Cellebrite returns to the cops, here's an example extraction report from a recent iPhone search, iOS 11.1 https://t.co/0k6pZcnFqw		No unlock required in this case, the suspect unlocked the devices voluntarily. This is just for reference.

@josephfcox Ha yep, my bet is it's more complicated than a guaranteed unlock for every single iPhone. But it's a change in stance from them, given they were saying it was getting really difficult for them, even ahead of iOS 11.
Please keep in mind this is a for-profit company making these claims, so there are probably some caveats to the capability. 		But Cellebrite hasn't been caught lying about what it can do before. And the U.S. is spending millions on millions on its tech.
I also found the first warrant for the search of an iPhone X, carried out by a Cellebrite expert at the DHS.		Currently unclear how the feds got into the device in the first place.		https://t.co/gKKmf2X84r
Cellebrite is keeping this tech in labs, not shipping it in software, meaning Apple can't test and reverse engineer, I'm told.		The company has been critticized for "hoarding" vulnerabilities. 		No official comment from them yet. Nor Apple.		https://t.co/gKKmf2X84r

@k8em0 Correctly :(
Did a stupid tweet in which I said exploits of both Spectre and Meltdown required attacker to be on the machine in the first place. That's only true of Meltdown.		It's possible web-based attacks via Javascript could exploit Spectre, as I'd noted afterwards.		Deleted stupid tweet.

@argvee Pretty bad, right?
But got to worry about long-term potential for Spectre, especially with the possible web-delivered exploits and lack of apparent patches...

Yep this is exactly what I heard. Though company says they're struggling on: https://t.co/ANtdL55YUJ https://t.co/99NdkF11f2
Plus pharmaceutical giant and, apparently, oil firms. It is totally 'nanas. https://t.co/ANtdL55YUJ https://t.co/BVJabquOxI
Victims of today's ransomware include: Chernobyl radiation monitoring systems, banks, an airport, Kiev metro, world's biggest shipping firm.
Merck confirmed - so that's one of the biggest manufacturers of cancer and HIV drugs on the planet hit https://t.co/ANtdL55YUJ #ransomware https://t.co/WmBpFwDjTT
So, yep, Chenobyl radiation monitoring affected by this latest ransomware attack... but not as bad as it sounds https://t.co/aDYxdpSmcf
@seansposito Idea is that you infect with phishing and spread with eternalblue - two sources saying this.
I should clarify, this is what two sources are saying. The latter is in dispute. https://t.co/UcKFiB2Ktm

@iMeluny @josephfcox But honest reports about what was a severe issue affecting millions (WA won't say just how many) should be highlighted.
@iMeluny @josephfcox Yep, that's bad no doubt, and exacerbates the problem I was just talking about.
@iMeluny @josephfcox And I blame this on shoddy reports of non-issues, like Wikileaks and Guardian's "backdoor".
@iMeluny @josephfcox I feel like we're at a place where we'll let encrypted comms apps off when they get things really wrong.
@iMeluny @josephfcox I totally disagree. It was a bad mistake by WhatsApp. Great how quick they fixed but still bad.
@iMeluny @josephfcox If anything this is a really good reminder that browser-based comms aren't as secure.
@iMeluny @josephfcox For more than a year it did. And promised privacy before that.
@iMeluny @josephfcox Hundreds of millions was an exaggeration by CP, but I'd guess millions were using WhatsApp Web.
@iMeluny @josephfcox A vuln that was open for 2 years in an app that promises to keep messages secure isn't worth a story now?
