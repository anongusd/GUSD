@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Avenatti has that big personality, confident, a lil cocky but cool. Same person all day long, interview to Twitter and back. I can see him yelling, but I don't see him pretending. I also know he is too smart to hit a woman especially at this time.
@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti For example Kavanaugh went on the Fox interview behaving like a choir boy. Very sweet and pure. Then at the hearing he was angry and rabid. 2 different persons. Jekyll &amp; Hyde
@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti No it's not. I like or dislike people for different reasons. One of the reasons I don't like Kavanaugh is he seems fake. On the other hand one of the reasons I like Avenatti he seems authentic. I find one credible and the other I don't.

@brentmcmurray @NikiBrooks76 @LesTyrone @MichaelAvenatti It's not giving new information though. The gossip is juicy, but no facts.

@tridder1 @SY313 @jeeezelouise @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti She is the one that passed a polygraph. He is the one that refused to take one. So who seems credible under normal circumstances?
@dedriannes @NYCMAGA @MichaelAvenatti Seeking reputable sources.
@NYCMAGA @julianahillga @Cyndy2014 @KelPort @MichaelAvenatti Most people will be to lazy to read the article. Not me. NOWHERE in that article does it say 'she hit me first' nor does it mention the woman saying he hit her. Posting an article and then lying about what it says with me in the mentions...ain't gonna work. Facts matter!!!
@NYCMAGA @MichaelAvenatti What reputable source gave you that information? Ok then. We aren't going to make stuff up and have me in the mentions. We are going to need facts over here. I don't flirt with fantasies.
@hollyvegas7 @MichaelAvenatti Get back to your corner. You're still in time out. You'll  remain  there until I  call you.
@Macros1 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti In Avenatti's case, this exposes him to legal jeopardy. The allegations are current &amp; serious. I do not believe them to be true, he is too smart. I think this is a setup and it will be revealed. They are trying to impugn his character &amp; distract him.  Look @ who gains from this.
@Macros1 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Kavanaugh ran from an investigation, he knew what it could reveal could tarnish his image. He was not in legal jeopardy, he put himself there by lying to Congress. In closed doors he could have said I had a wild youth. Statute of limitations passed this just about his image &amp; ego
@Macros1 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti YES, I do want an investigation. It's called a trial in this case, evidence will be presented and examined.  I think Avenatti is looking forward to clearing his name and moving on with life.  Innocent want to prove they're innocent. Guilty people hide.
@hollyvegas7 @MichaelAvenatti Go back to the corner, DO NOT come back until I call you. Your plan was dull and unimpressive.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Its 4.37, I usually get up at 5. Lol. I will have to cheat today and get up @ 7 then hurry. It was a fun chat. I will be tired all of today but it was worth it :) Good morning!
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti True on everyone's name having value. It should have unfolded in the private hearings. They both have families, careers, and lives to get back to.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti That's along the lines of what I was saying. They came and I don't run.
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti True
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Do a fact check on that. Not from a conservative news source. From a government  source
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Not if someone else is controlling my country.  That's not who we are.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I am not mad. I just like to debate. I am smiling  the whole time. I do have a lot of love and respect for our military. I think they do so much for us. I want them to be treated well. I confess I don't know much about the tent cities and the train to nowhere..lol
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Well good for you! Did they lose it under Bush? Or Obama? I know under Bush life was rough for me. OBAMA dug the country out and handed 45 a plush economy.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I don't ever worry about Antifa. Never heard of them until 45. I worry about mass shootings. I worry about kids in school. I worry when I am in church, or the store or in the car. I worry about my mail and what could be sent. Antifa nag not worried about them.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I hope so too. From those making false claims of abuse, to those calling the cops on people barbecuing.
@hollyvegas7 @MichaelAvenatti This is the best you could do? Really? You're in time out! Sit in the corner and think about it, get a better plan. When you've completed  that return  and I will review your response.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I don't know that's a good question. She is the only one to answer that.
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Oh goodness, the lower unemployment trend started under Obama. 45 knows it. That's why he ran on immigration instead. Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard, blue waves all around, flips all around. First it was red then purple now its blue :)
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I don't like Kavanaugh. I think he is a liar and a fake. I believe the accusations. I like Avenatti. I think he is real, smart and strategic. Which is why I don't think he did this. I want to know about the victim and details before forming an opinion, that's all.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Ha just between us and everyone else reading. Do you really believe he is innocent?
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti He will be impeached by the House. He just won't be convicted by the Senate. He will most likely complete his 4 years and the GOP will be done with him by then. He will walk away having completed his fleecing of the country. We will slowly get back to normal. Dems will win WH2020
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Most people hide it. Dr. Ford told her husband and her therapist years before this. She passed a polygraph. She only came forward because of the office he was going for and what she knew of his character. I pray you'll never have to deal with that from anyone you know/ love.
@hollyvegas7 @MichaelAvenatti I have been debating all night mostly with people of opposing viewpoints. Unlike you, I have not had the need to be crude with anyone. My intellect allows me to communicate at that level. We can only show what's inside I suppose.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I would hate it. Do you know that during the vetting process he could have handled this in private. Admitting to a wild youth, and it could not be held against him. He had closed hearings. He knows better. He chose to lie. The wrong strategy.
@Sw33tDeee @NSWUfrogman @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I would hate it. It wasn't one allegation though. They were credible. Now let me ask the same question if Dr. Ford was your mom, your sister, aunt best friend, or if it happened to you, would  you like it?
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti Thank you. I love debating. I prefer people who have opposing views in a debate. We are learning from each other and we are also forced to defend our own points. It develops our critical thinking. I will debate the shade of blue in the sky...lol. We just have to do it right ‚ô°
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I will be laughing with you after he is impeached. Make no mistake, he will be impeached.
@drewand1212 @Jules2berries @MichaelAvenatti Haha seems like I touched a nerve on those indictments. Let me touch another, he will be impeached. He knows it and so do you.
@Aaron__Sandoval @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Many people want to see him fall. So they are running with any bit of negativity, without employing critical thinking.
@Aaron__Sandoval @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Michael is looking at running for president, he is not going to do something so stupid. He is too smart for that.
@Aaron__Sandoval @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I am not denying that a human made an allegation. I am waiting to see who made the allegation. I am waiting to hear the details of the allegations. I also believe it to be a set up and I believe it will be proven.
@MarcLaw76052942 @DandBrooklynn @MichaelAvenatti That is your right in this wonderful  country! I am just wondering why so many people were aroused because I want to wait on the victim and details. I think he was set up. My right in this wonderful country.
@hollyvegas7 @MichaelAvenatti Which woman? What's her name? What do you know about her? What are the details of the case?
@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti What they were trying to catch him on was lying to Congress. Most of those rape / alleged rape cases statute of limitations ran out. This was about his suitability for office. All men are created equal but all types of cases are not the same.
@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti There are 2 sides of law. Civil and criminal. Criminal cases have the standard beyond a reasonable doubt because a person's freedom is at risk. Civil cases have a different standard, the guilty party usually loses something / pays money. Kavanaugh's guilt clearly didn't matter.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti Lastly this is the 2nd time you called me an idiot. Let this be a warning. Don't pass your place with me. Stay in your LANE. We can debate, disagree &amp; have fun. But, I don't play that disrespect mess over here. Trust you don't want none, I ain't the one...ok? Got it? Good!!
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti I simply stated that until I have a victim and details then it's a set up. People are arrested all the time on false claims. That is why we have courts. I repeat to ask for the victim and details is common sense only an idiot wouldn't want that before a rush to judgement.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti You all had Dr. Ford come forward and testify. We knew who his accuser was and what where the alleged details. Then some folks like me believe her and some folk like you disbelieve her, but we all had something to go on.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti In a DV case in the jurisdiction he was arrested it can just be a complaint. It was a suspicion of DV. They have yet to name his accuser, we are yet to hear the details of the case. It is not defending him to want more information. It's common sense.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti Let's just get this straight Kavanaugh is unfit for the bench. 45 is unfit for office. I don't like them and I like Avenatti. I don't  have to like who you like or support  who you support. This is America and we still have some freedoms left. Next reply Avenatti.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti Project much?
@cindi_abbott @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Except he has enough time to recover and the otherside lowered the bar...so he is still in the race.
@MichaelAvenatti Ladies &amp; gentlemen, friends and trolls! It has been fun, but sleep beckons. Keep your eyes on this case. I guarantee it is not what it seems. He may not have been set up by who you think, but he was set up. This will be interesting.
@scott_easler @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I love debating :)
@FrankLo37366831 @MichaelAvenatti If you believe 'innocent until proven guilty', are you saying you agree with my original point. I want a credible witness/victim and the details before considering the plausibility of this case. That's the idea that got everyone's knickers twisted.
@persnificte I am applying some #BotBeBlocked to you.
@drewand1212 @Jules2berries @MichaelAvenatti 37 indictments with many plea deals and some people think other things aren't real. This issue was already discussed, I won't do it again just because you're late for school.
@coopersopinion @MichaelAvenatti Absolutely! If he is guilty he should. At which point, we will all know who the victim is, and the details into what happened. Then the legal process will ensue. He is not above the law. He hasn't even been arraigned yet and folks already assume his guilt.
@joejackson0102 @MichaelAvenatti Clearly beat whom?
@Jules2berries @MichaelAvenatti No attempt is being made! They are just hoping they can have something against him.
@Belkys73017746 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti No, I am saying  that until a credible victim is named, and provable details are given, then it is not a credible case.
@Macros1 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I did not defend Kavanaugh. I wanted an investigation. I knew his accusers' names, and the details they alleged. Why can't I want the same thing from this case?
@KAG4US @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti To my understanding there is a bail schedule that determined his bail amount. NO his arrest does NOT mean there was evidence. It means there was reasonable suspicion. We have to wait until 12/5.
@NSWUfrogman @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Kavanaugh's case was not a criminal case. Michael's case is. Guilt in Kavanaugh's case has very different meaning because the consequences are different.  That also means the standard proving guilt or innocence is different.
@DeniseCunniff1 @Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Michael being arrested is is not in dispute and therefore requires no proof. It's not a gotcha moment. Water is wet, that's not in dispute either. The dispute is whether or not the case is valid.
@Aaron__Sandoval @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti I am being very specific for a reason. Who is the victim? What are the details? Without those 2 there is no case. Until we have that info it's not going anywhere.
@OfficalCupOfJoe @MichaelAvenatti You're correct. The victim simply becomes a witness. However that person has to exist. We don't know who that person is. They thought it was one of his ex wives, both denied  it and defended him. So who is the complainant? Who was abused? I think the case will be dropped for this
@FLMel69 @MichaelAvenatti Exactly! When a credible witness comes forward we can move on from that point.
@Witter9966 @MichaelAvenatti You're the one melting :) Yes it's better now.
@MichaelAvenatti Should Michael be proven innocent as I suspect he will, my point will be proven. They have these charges to keep him occupied and 2nd to sully his name. We need a name and we need details to decide guilt or innocence. You know like Kavanaugh had.
@MichaelAvenatti Michael was arrested. Clearly there was a complaint, but where is the complainant?  What are the details? Many of you are putting your bias towards Michael before critical thinking. Cases get dropped everyday. Innocent people get arrested everyday. #think
@MichaelAvenatti Clearly many of you are still bitter about Kavanaugh. There were credible accusers, and Democrats called for an INVESTIGATION! The most basic one was done and he was pushed through. All the victims were not heard and it was not thorough.
@tommyboy41161 @MichaelAvenatti Oh so that's why innocent people get arrested all the time?
@Witter9966 @MichaelAvenatti Correction it should be *you're
@PaulyPipes1 @MichaelAvenatti I am not lost. Look at the point I keep hammering. Notice how careful I have been with my word choices. Then remember this within the next couple of months when it plays out.
@brentmcmurray @MichaelAvenatti Up until  this point I have not been rude to anyone. But when a moron calls me an idiot, I object. If you bothered to read you would see where both his ex wives said it was not true and both defended him. Reading is fundamental!!!
@Sw33tDeee @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti So where is the credible complainant? Do you realize charges get dropped everyday?
@JeffBoot @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Oh you have a copy of the report with the name of the victim?
@Aaron__Sandoval @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Oh you have a copy of the report with a victim?
@tridder1 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti 1) They don't know that it happened, different from saying it never happened. 2) There was no thorough investigation. What the FBI was authorized to do was basic at best. 3) Several women came out accusing Kavanaugh. 4) He still sits on the SCOTUS.
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Again under that rock. The lie was what got him. Clinton was liked, but still impeached. All these lies &amp; ties of 45...we'll see.
@Sw33tDeee @engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Clearly you've been under a rock. It's not just about the sex, it's the money trail and the lies that make it impeachable. Clearly the folks who voted for 45 weren't looking for a moral leader.
@FamilyTrumpGolf @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti No one but you mentioned the police being 'in on it'.  The police get a report and they act.
@engr150 @Es330David @MichaelAvenatti You mean creepy porn lawyer exposing creepy president having unprotected sex with a porn star with his wife and infant at home. Said creepy president lies to the American people about it, then creepy porn lawyer exposes the creepy truth!!
@Es330David @MichaelAvenatti As I said, until a victim comes forward it's trumped up. Let me add until a credible victim with provable allegations comes forward this is trumped up. Unless you have proof to the contrary, then we all will be waiting until 12/5.
@Es330David @MichaelAvenatti Please show where the victim is mentioned? Who is she? What's her name? What are the details? CA can arrest him on the suspicion with 48 hrs to charge. One snipet even mentioned they will decide on 12/5/18 when he is arraigned. This was done simply to damage his reputation.
