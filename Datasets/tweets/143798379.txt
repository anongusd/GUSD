But yes, or course, who is to blame?
Right now, Senator Schumer is rallying his members to block a bill to keep the government open ‚Äì all to extort something unrelated.
But that‚Äôs a whole other thread for another time.
Tomes have been written about the shift of the Republican party under 8 yrs of Obama. Yet it has taken less than a year of a new president for Democrat's base to say you‚Äôre a traitor unless you shut down the government‚Ä¶ and for Senators to go right along.
Yet, now they are bragging about it to their base.
As Chuck Schumer described this tactic in 2013, it‚Äôs ‚Äúgovernmental chaos.‚Äù
But no, shut it down, they say.
We are not jamming anything on Democrats they don‚Äôt support. We‚Äôre just saying keep the government open and fund children‚Äôs health insurance while we continue to work out a deal on DACA.
I stress that Democrats are asking for something entirely unrelated. Because, to be clear, Democrats have no underlying objection to the CR or CHIP. They are, quite openly, voting ‚Äòno' in an attempt to force action on something else.
My dear friends at the pod literally have a whip list urging Democrat Senators to shut down the government over DACA. https://t.co/pYzuyLT8hk
This is not a on-one-hand-but-on-the-other situation. They‚Äôre not even hiding it. Democrats are openly saying they are using the filibuster to shut down the government to try to get something entirely unrelated.
What should be pretty obvious at this point is Democrats are TRYING to shut down the government. That, quite clearly, is their stated strategy.
In fact, that is what Democrats suggest they intend to do: require 60 votes to keep the government open and to fund children‚Äôs health insurance.
While it is a *very* smart take to point out Rs have a majority in the House and Senate, it is also purposefully obtuse to ignore that in the Senate a minority can filibuster and block any legislation.
Now that the House has voted to keep the government open, excuse me as I take a minute to set some things straight about a potential shutdown and the whole blame game thing.

I know you were an exec branch guy, but why has the House not passed a bill the Senate hasn‚Äôt sent to the House yet?		I understand it is very difficult to grapple with the fact House Republicans are the only ones who have voted to reauthorize the program. https://t.co/0Atcxs4O9V
@jonfavs did you quickly google that? be honest, did you quickly google some talking points for CHIP? 		I am 100% sure Representative Favreau would be okay with the offsets to fund CHIP.

What‚Äôs amazing is Democrats who only casually pay attention to congress honestly think Republicans have been the hold up on CHIP when its the other way around. As the Washington Post made clear: https://t.co/QgH6KpMki3
House Republicans passed a full reauthorization of CHIP and Democrats voted against it because it was paid for with a small premium increase for millionaires. Now Democrats are going to vote against an extension. Not both sides indeed. https://t.co/1vZyKuJ0qc

Under the plan, the standard deduction goes from $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples.
The plan expands the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 AND provides a credit of $300 for each parent and non-child dependent.
WSJ runs the numbers for an average family of four making 60K: sees their tax bill drop from $1,608 to just $472. https://t.co/yKVBEnX0S7
