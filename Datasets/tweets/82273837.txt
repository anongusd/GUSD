@tubbleson Think about it. We don‚Äôt need more enemies. We need minds to see facts. That‚Äôs what they are lacking. They need to be convinced to do their own research. That is where hope is. They did not decide to become brainwashed but are. Truth makes us stronger. Powerful if we use rightly.
@tubbleson It‚Äôs obvious they hate truth. Share facts on any topic to be discussed not to make them cry but so they have a chance to come out of dark. They are not necessarily an enemy because they are blinded to truth. It is hard I know. Compassion is necessary. Prepareation is needed.
