RT @jonfavs: Win or lose is the only prism for political analysis on television, and it's why our President acts accordingly. https://t.co/…
Does any #Republican really think this is going to end well? @realDonaldTrump just rides off quietly into sunset after 8 wonderful years?
Thank you to all of my fellow citizens who marched last Saturday #WomensMarch
@dougducey how many of your #education initiatives matter if DeVos is confirmed?
But what about after the child is born? Right to birth and right to life aren't necessarily the same thing... #MarchForLife #ACA
@RepSinema What are you doing today to stop @realDonaldTrump from enacting his harmful agenda?
@MayorStanton Do not back down from @realDonaldTrump Phoenix is behind you!

Having @realDonaldTrump and @seanhannity on at the same time is redundant. #fakenews #Resist
@JeffFlake Yes. Stand up to Trump and his ridiculous ideas on trade.
Thank you @SenWarren for standing up to @BetsyDeVos and helping to lead the charge against her confirmation.
@SenWarren Well, when in Rome...
@dougducey ignore Saturday's #WomensMarch at your own peril. Support @realDonaldTrump at your own peril. Arizonans have long memories.
@RepSinema Fight for the #ACA. Don't let Trump destroy the healthcare system.
@JeffFlake do not vote for @BetsyDeVos confirmation. She is incredibly unqualified for the position.
@MayorStanton do not back down from the President. Stand up for all of the citizens of the great city of Phoenix.
