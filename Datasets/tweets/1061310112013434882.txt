#FridayFollowUp (on Monday), episode 7: It was a historic week in Congress as we passed two, common-sense gun violence prevention measures, #HR8 and #HR1112. This week we'll consider #HR1, the most important reform bill of our generation. Stay tuned... #ForThePeople https://t.co/RKhR3E3CKx
@BlueInMinn @BurnsieMN @Ilhan That‚Äôs correct. The top image is from a display in the WV Capitol and bottom image is from a gas station in Rogers.
A core promise of America is the vigilant protection of free speech and the security of those who engage in it. While I strongly object to some of Rep. @ilhan Omar‚Äôs recent comments, the disgusting display in the WV Capitol and threats on her life are antithetical to our values. https://t.co/R8qE6UbpDE
Thoughts and tweets don‚Äôt save lives, ACTION saves lives. Today the 116th Congress took action and passed #HR8 to ensure sensible and reasonable background checks on firearms purchases.

I just joined my Democratic and Republican colleagues in voting 300-128 for the compromise border security bill to ensure our government remains funded and open. Is it perfect? No. But now we move forward and start tackling the issues we were sent here to address. #ForThePeople
Today marks one year since the tragic day in Parkland, FL on which 17 lives were cut short by gun violence. Last night, after many arduous hours, the House Judiciary Committee voted for universal background checks. The transition from thoughts to action is underway. #MSDstrong

Salient words of advice from an icon of the US House, Rep. John Dingell, who has passed away at age 92.

Proud to join @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenSherrodBrown, @RepLloydDoggett,  @PeterWelch and others today as an original co-sponsor of The Medicare Negotiation &amp; Competitive Licensing Act. 90% of Americans agree it‚Äôs time for Medicare to reduce the burden on patients &amp; taxpayers.#action https://t.co/iJoRNwtAI6

I applaud @POTUS‚Äôs call for bipartisanship, reducing the cost of healthcare &amp; prescriptions, fighting childhood cancer, investing in infrastructure &amp; paid family leave. But we can‚Äôt forget about draining the swamp: ethics reform, voter protection, &amp; campaign finance reform. #HR1

This wasn‚Äôt high school. This wasn‚Äôt college. This was during medical school in the 1980‚Äôs. The people of Virginia will dictate Gov.

Isn‚Äôt that our job?@House_DRTF https://t.co/Ulyf9i5EDu
Sen. McConnell opposes making Election Day a holiday because he believes federal employees already have enough days off. So let‚Äôs make a deal, and trade Columbus Day for Election Day. The day we vote is worthy of such reverence. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/ypOejyOsLe

It‚Äôs time for Friday Follow-Up II. The shutdown is over! Negotiations will begin immediately, and I hope to inspire bold and permanent solutions for border security and immigration reform - including DACA, TPS and DED, which I‚Äôve implored be included in any deal. https://t.co/WooU8odKl1
The President just announced he‚Äôll sign the 3-week, continuing resolution to RE-OPEN government for which I and fellow D and R members of the Problem Solvers Caucus advocated during our meeting with him last week.

While I welcome many elements of The President‚Äôs proposal, negotiations cannot begin during a shutdown. I believe a bipartisan deal can be reached that satisfies our need for enhanced border security AND immigration reform, but government must be re-opened for that to occur.
At the @WhiteHouse this week, we asked The President to re-open government, pay those who protect us in the skies, on the ground, on the seas, and at our borders - and demand a bipartisan border security &amp; immigration reform package from Congress. I hope he does so today. #enough https://t.co/YvPcRoWtU7

I never imagined the best endorsement for #HR1 would come from ‚Å¶‚Å¶Sen. McConnell, who opposes: transparency, cleaning-up corruption, voter protection and empowerment, ethics reform, campaign law enforcement enhancement, and campaign finance reform.  https://t.co/GjAucgrLqB
Pleased to announce my assignments to the House Financial Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee. Eager to work with my colleagues on both sides to promote truth, justice, opportunity for all, a strong economy, consumer protection &amp; improved relations around the globe.
From mtg w/The President at the @WhiteHouse, to voting on bills to open govt, to convening R &amp; D colleagues, I‚Äôve spent my first two weeks in Congress working to inspire a cessation of animosity in favor of action. One thing is clear:  it won‚Äôt happen w/o Americans demanding it.
Thanks, Tennessee, for showing us what can be achieved when possibility transcends partisanship. https://t.co/2zcMBETuG0
We absolutely must secure our borders and enforce our laws. That‚Äôs why the Senate must immediately appropriate money to pay our border officers and agents,@realDonaldTrump should sign it into law and Congress should draft a bipartisan border security &amp; immigration reform package. https://t.co/NjqlXLvXQY
Actually, Mr. President, many of us are here - reasonable Ds and Rs who want our government open, border and port security enhanced, and immigration system reformed.

The longest shutdown in our history is hurting millions and represents yet another stain on our nation. My message to @POTUS &amp; Congress is clear: immediately end the shutdown and let‚Äôs begin negotiating a comprehensive, bipartisan border security + immigration reform package.
Thoughts and tweets don't save lives; action saves lives. That‚Äôs why I cosponsored my second bill yesterday, #HR8, requiring universal background checks on all gun sales. And this morning, we dedicated our cloakroom in honor of @GabbyGiffords and the late Rep. Leo Ryan. #courage https://t.co/oOnLPiIgc6
In solidarity with hard-working federal employees who are working without pay or on furlough, I have officially requested that my salary be withheld until the shutdown ends. I‚Äôll divide my #shutdownpay equally, and contribute it to @2harvest, @CornerstoneMN and @VVAmerica. https://t.co/JDHhV4FYPO
Americans expect and deserve common sense solutions from effective leaders in both parties. First, the President must end the shutdown immediately. Second, fact-based border security enhancement and humane immigration reform bills must be swiftly debated, passed &amp; implemented.
