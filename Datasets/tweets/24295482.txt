@rickungar @Indpsychologist @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @GOP @BarackObama @DHSgov At times it isn't about what we prefer. Choices are made by leaders. Americans voted for Obama to push their policy beliefs. He had his chance. In some cases the SCOTUS spoke. Americans can and did make the choice for Trump. It's his turn. The SCOTUS can speak if asked.
@rickungar @Indpsychologist @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @GOP @BarackObama @DHSgov If the SCOTUS makes a decision I don't like that's the way our system works. There's still a remedy for that. The brilliance of our system is the difficulty to correct but still the possibility of doing so at the highest level. The three branches checks and balances matter.
