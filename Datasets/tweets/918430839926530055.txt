@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe Follow the law?!  That’s hilarious coming from a lib.  Good gawd.  Your vitriol for Trump has you advocating for a terrorist.  That’s how pathetic your little hurt feelings are. You don’t give as 🐀’s azz about “laws”.  The Kavanaugh hearing is still fresh. So is Covington.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe Didn’t say that. But I’m certainly not going to advocate for a terrorist to be brought back here after what she’s done. I stand with Pompeo. Period. Thank God for this administration.
@parscale @Nike @realDonaldTrump I haven’t bought @nike since the whole disgusting disgraceful Kap ordeal.  I have no intentions on going back.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe Bottom line she’s a terrorist who called for the slaughter of fellow Americans. She deserves to be exactly where she is. Pompeo did the right thing. She’s not an American. #ThankGodTrumpWon  bHussein would be having a dinner in her honor. Easy to spot the traitors.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe Do you always defend terrorists?  Or just when it fits your narrative bc Trump hurt your little feelings?
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe No it’s not. If she were a US Citizen at birth, it would say US Citizen.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe Nowhere on the bc does it say US Citizen.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor Mistakes happen. Errors get made. Do you not realize this?
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor The gov made their decision. Pretty sure they checked it out. If they didn’t we’ll hear about. Perhaps she should cry to Yemen. Maybe she’ll have better luck.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor Not if the pp was issued in error.  Then it can and should be revoked.
@AmericaNewsroom @HassanShibly @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox Priceless that’s her attorney.  Even more reason to keep her out Pompeo absolutely without question did the right thing.  Thank God Trump Won. 🇺🇸👍🏻
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Yes, Geneva conventions. That’s the rule she’d be under if there wasn’t a cos. Laugh all you want. It’s a fact. Clearly you struggle with those. Especially when they don’t fit your vitriol for Trump. And really that’s what this is about for you. You look ridiculous and pathetic
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor And no, the burden is not on us. The burden is her. She’s the one trying to get back into a country she most likely isn’t entitled to.  She should try Yemen, her dads country of origin. Maybe they’ll let her in. Doubtful, but maybe.
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor You mean the Islamist who’s head of CAIRS Florida chapter, their national spokesperson &amp; working pro bono for the traitor? Is that the attorney you’re referring to?
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor That’d be protocol/sop, but we all know things happen, balls get dropped and mistakes are made. If she was issued one in error then it further supports it being stripped.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY She’s Yemen’s issue.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Bless your heart. She’s not a us citizen. She never was. Her dads visa most likely had no cos att of her birth, hence Geneva Conventions, hence she’s not a US citizen.  Keep struggling. It’s comical
@GaelenSchumann @ABCDEFGHIJoe @loreauel @syalo46989922 @gabrielmalor If her dads visa didn’t show a cos at the time of her birth then she’s not a US Citizen. She’d be under the Geneva Conventions rule of law. And the Geneva Conventions doesn’t protect terrorists. IF she had a pp, it was in error, hence revoked. She’s not entitled to anything here.
@gabrielmalor Disturbing you want this pos back in this country.  Good gawd.  Speaks volumes.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Again, it seems, her dad didn’t provide a cos hence she was never a US citizen. IF she had a passport it was an error. In essence she was stripped of something she never should have had in the first place. #Justice  She should try her luck w/Yemen, her official home country.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY While children born in America are granted citizenship under the 14th Amendment, children of foreign diplomats are not because they are not under the "jurisdiction of" the U.S., according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Yes you can. And they did. Regardless whether she was a citizen or was mistaken for one, the issue has been cleared up now and she’s not coming back. #ThankGodTrumpWon🇺🇸 BHussein would have invited her to the WH. 🙄
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Hence, they investigated and found these things and stripped her of what she thinks she’s entitled to. In actuality she’s not entitled to 💩 bc she was never a citizen.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY If the cos on his visa hadn’t been updated att of her birth, then she was under Geneva conventions rule, not our constitution. IF she had a pp, someone made a mistake in issuing her one, bc she shouldn’t have had one. She wasn’t a citizen based on her dads diplomatic position.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Pompeo knows more than you do. I know you struggle with that. Considering she was stripped, the visa prob wasn’t changed at the time of her birth which put her under the Geneva conventions.  Geneva conventions doesn’t protect terrorists...hence, she’s not coming back.
@CharlieDaniels Amen.   Thanks for always being the “calm”. I sincerely look forward to your tweets each day. 🇺🇸👍🏻🙏
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Again, i don’t know if she had one or not. I don’t know if it was even her in the pic. My point is it doesn’t matter. The only thing for certain is she doesn’t have one now, nor will she ever again.

@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY I don’t “know” that she does/did.It’s simply a pic posted on social media of unidentifiable people holding pass ports.  If she did have one and she was under Geneva conventions then it was in error she received one. Regardless, she doesn’t have one now, nor will she. Thank God.
@crosswrdpuzzlr1 @polishpigthief @RS_IceisCold So. If the diplomatic visa her dad was here on had no cos, she’s under the rule of the Geneva conventions, not our constitution.  And the Geneva conventions doesn’t protect terrorists. Hence, she’s not coming back. #Sympathizers are just traitors too, btw.
@jsolomonReports A shame it won’t amount to anything.
@RepSwalwell No, it’s you straight up lying, looking like the azz you are and that greasy hair is N A S T Y.  #TrumpKickedYourAzzAGAIN
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Her dad entered this country as a diplomate. They are not under the jurisdiction of the USA. You know that, right?
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY No, she burned it.  Denounced her citizenship on social media.  She hated this country. Went to fight for a terrorist organization.  Only traitors like her would defend that.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Awww, triggered again?
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY two classes of cases children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation &amp; children of diplomatic reps of a foreign State--as has already been shown/English colonies in America, had been recognized exceptions to the fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the country.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY *aren’t
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Depends on her dads diplomatic visa. If there wasn’t a cos she  falls under Geneva conventions. And terrorists are protected by Geneva conventions. Your girl isn’t coming back.
@Reblawrence12 @AnnLittlemouse @NATSEC09 @SecPompeo Dumb azz, her dads visa was a Diplomatic visa. There wasn’t a cos, which means she’s not covered by our constitution, but rather the Geneva conventions.  And terrorist aren’t protected under Geneva conventions...hence she’s not a citizen and she’s not coming back. Deal with it.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Terrorists aren’t protected under the Geneva conventions, hence no need for her to have citizenship here bc she’s not coming back.  Understand?  Good.  Delete your account. You look pathetic.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Terrorists aren’t protected under the Geneva convention.  You understand that, right? No need for her to have citizenship. She’s not coming back.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY You can’t back up anything, except with 37 indictments....which is completely irrelevant and there’s STILL no Trump Russia collusion.  Keep calling names, deflecting and making a complete 🤡 of yourself.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY One thing is for sure.  She’s not a citizen anymore.  She’s not coming back.  Cry some more.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Not if it was fraudulent.  Wise up.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY So.  She was in a foreign country, joined isis which is a fto. Called for death of American citizens. Keep defending her.  You look absolutely disgusting. Amazing you hate Trump more than you love this country. You prove you don’t have to join isis to be a traitor.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Completely irrelevant. Your inferiority complex is showing again.

@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY And still no Trump Russia collusion. But keep bawling about it. You look desperate.
@JoffreyRasul @J_KnightNY Her dad was here as a diplomat. The question is w/her parents visas...I’m sure it was a Diplomatic visa issued by the US.Were they still here under that visa or did they apply for a cos? If the former, she has no entitlement &amp; falls under Geneva conventions, not the Constitution.

@CillizzaCNN You mean what will the infested msm do when Mueller finds zero collusion on Trump? That’s called exoneration. Any “journalists” with any decency at all would apologize to the general public and to Trump and then step away from their job. That’s what SHOULD happen.
@MagniFieri @AnnCoulter So Q is JUST NOW signaling that Coulter is a loser?! What took so long? Has he clued you all in on Sessions yet? Surely everyone has figured that one out on their own by now, right?!  That was so annoying when so many people were convinced Sessions was a great guy.

@J_R_Reiff Way to expose your hypocrisy.  And the telling part is you can’t even back up your position whatsoever. All you have is your vitriol for Trump &amp; his supporters and your little tiny hurt feelings.
@J_R_Reiff Ohhh deflecting now.  Clinton and Obama used cages too. Where was your outrage and disgust? Hmmm? Oh wait, you sat silent when THEY did it. But it fits your pathetic narrative to cry when Trump does it?! Bless your heart. Find some integrity, clearly you have absolutely none.
@ellievhall Not that bf is msm, mind you, but it’s sewage nonetheless.
@ellievhall Msm hate Trump so much they’ll literally side with a terrorist.  Let that sink in, folks.  That’s how infested our msm in this country is. Pretty disgusting.  #PureSewage
@lisac0814 @ellievhall @JackPosobiec Bc they hate Trump.  They hate Trump MORE than they care about keeping this country safe.  Let that sink in.  Pathetic, isn’t it. That’s our msm in this country. It’s pure sewage.
@ellievhall Her twit handle was umm ji had, she posts a pic of unidentifiable people holding US Passports claiming there’s going to be a bonfire soon, she left here to join a terrorist organization and you sympathize with this pos??  Good gawd. Nauseating how pathetic dumbed down 🤡’s are
@ellievhall She joined a terrorist organization. You get that, right?
@J_R_Reiff That’s cute coming from someone with such a delusional inflated ego he thinks he looks like Christopher Reeves; so much so he wears a Superman tee...AS A GROWN MAN, and actually uses it as his.  Bwhahahahahahaha! You’re pretty much the LAST person to comment on aviators. Js.
@evans5179 They’re on the side of justice. What do i need to rethink?

@vickibazter @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Oh my gosh. I’m so sick of the indictment talk that NEVER COMES. All this Q stuff....UUGGHH. There was a time they were all so convinced Sessions was a good guy. Please tell me people still aren’t believing he’s a good guy, right? Surely at this point they understand he’s DS?
@vickibazter @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Lol. What?
@evans5179 I guess I am missing your point bc I have to think the same people who are saying hold her accountable are the same people who sided with Ferguson PD, not M Brown.
@J_R_Reiff She joined a terrorist organization.  You get that, right? https://t.co/9WPA2liAtG
@Reblawrence12 @AnnLittlemouse @NATSEC09 @SecPompeo To suggest American tax payers should foot the bill for that pos is asinine. Disgusting you’re sympathetic to someone who commits treason against this country.
@Reblawrence12 @NATSEC09 @SecPompeo She’s not an American Citizen. Things to consider before joining a terrorist organization.
@J_KnightNY So it costs American tax payers millions?  Wow, that’s genius🙄.  Good gawd.
@evans5179 She joined a terrorist organization. You understand that, right?
@GoodmanComedian @realDonaldTrump You’re pathetic
@TheRoadCop So us American tax payers can pay for her??  NO.  good grief.
@bullriders1 @tmshrout @WldRvrFshr Are you even slightly aware what isis does to gays??  Just curious.
@coolrunning2009 So American tax payers can pay for her for the next 50 years??  Good gawd.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Thank GOD Trump Won. Pompeo absolutely made the right choice. Hell no don’t bring her back her so we have to pay for her.
@pravdy_net__ @DeevineDestiny @fox5dc @SecPompeo But she’s as absolutely clueless about that as she is everything else. All she knows is what bitter Joy Reid spoon feeds her.  Bless her heart 🙄
@pravdy_net__ @DeevineDestiny @fox5dc @SecPompeo I think you intended to direct this to destiny. I’m well aware of all the things Trump has done that prove to any logical person, at least anyone above 2nd grade intelligence, that Trump isn’t colluding w/Russia.Including closing the Russian consulate &amp; kicking out Russian spies.
@MaryCarnahan2 @fox5dc I’m pretty confident our intel agencies got all that info years ago, clearly they are too.  Isis is nearly eliminated at this point. And again, she’s not an American citizen.  A little logic and common sense go a long way.  Lib, am I right?

@DeevineDestiny @fox5dc @SecPompeo Trump has been working with Russia? Really? You have proof to back up your mouth? And your hurt feelings don’t count.Also, can you explain why, if Trump is working w/Russia, did he sign a HUGE arms deal with Poland? Because that makes ZERO sense and makes you look like a msm 🤡.
@MaryCarnahan2 @fox5dc Gee Mary, she joined a foreign terrorist group. Do you really struggle with why one does such a thing? She’s not an American. But you feel she should be brought here and “debriefed”?? Good gawd.
@Newsweek @MaryCarnahan2 Fueled by msm dumbing down bottom feeders who slurp up their propaganda, ridiculous vitriol and fake news.
@Azure_Island @AgeCosmos @POTUS This isn’t proof for me. They’ve been saying for awhile it’d be about this time frame.  I want to see some charges, and some convictions. THEN I will believe the Justice Dept has turned the corner. Until then, not so much. The corruption is just so deep.  It’s gut wrenching.
Doesn’t get any more clear than that.  Own it dems. https://t.co/PfqgeYeFXx

@Memelct5 @FreshPiffle @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump @TheJusticeDept @AdamSchiff Corruption by Hillary was started long before 2016. Her corruption goes back 30+yrs. Those tentacles are long/far reaching at this point. She’s poisoned every level every branch so much so there’s not a set of Gonads in DC who’ll charge let alone prosecute her &amp; her DS dirtbags

@ladyberry18 @fabmar2018 @2centsannandale @NorahODonnell @aravosis @ScottPelley There are a lot of traitors, on both sides. Attempting to stage a coup against a legally dully elected US President is not only treason, it’s an absolute outrage regardless who the President is. This can not, should not EVER be allowed or tolerated.
@RiordanJohn @ByronYork And btw the press won’t investigate doj/fbi, they SHOULD but they won’t. Listen to them even in this clip, their propaganda spin is clear. FBI/DOJ did nothing wrong. It was against Trump, after all. Msm sold their souls to discredit him at all cost. So treason/coup ehh it’s ok.😡

@jackdoranjr @christianllamar And yet there’s not a set of gonads in all of DC who’ll go after Hillary or anyone in DS.

@GeraldCraig2 @kinportss @slacker_ga01 Right. And Islam is not, it’s the polar opposite. If is lam is indeed the reason, then they’ve already lost the battle, most likely.  Which is most likely the case based on what the elected officials have done to that country.  Their agenda is clear.

@CatholicLady10 She was born here, so she’s eligible to run i “think”.  My point is more how or why her parents wouldn’t have become citizens and chose to live here after their green cards expired etc. Ya know? Why not become citizens? Especially when they had two girls. Weird.

@E_Turbo @RealJamesWoods @POTUS The really sick part is if we’re being lied to &amp; she has indeed passed, it’s absolutely criminal what they’re doing. People need to be convicted, but they won’t be. Because democrats don’t get charged with their sick crimes in this country. That has to change. @POTUS

@Lowcountry1Girl @SpeakerPelosi Pelosi, imo, &amp;7D’s (new cab) w/85 fam members trying to leave the country during a gov shutdown on taxpayers dime. Getting to safety while plot played out, hence D Brazile’s tweet. Plan was Pelosi to fly back from that trip on AF1...as potus. They’re that desperate, folks.
@Lowcountry1Girl @SpeakerPelosi Of course not. Their plan was foiled. RBG Is way more sick, or worse, than D’s are telling us. Can’t allow SOTU in Chamber bc they know RBG/no show. They can’t allow that info out bc they refuse Trump another Justice pick. It’s also why Pelosi tried to leave the country last wk.

@calloutlm1 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Look how Dems treated Kavanaugh &amp;were so desperate to stop him. They didn’t care, they’d destroy him if need be. That’s how filthy slimy these dbags are.They DONT want Trump to pick another Justice. Hence, no SOTU in Chamber. Bc Ginsburg won’t show. How do they explain that?
@calloutlm1 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS It also explains why Pelosi was trying to get out of the country 2 weeks ago w/7D’s (new cab)&amp; 85 family members. Get to safety while the plot played out. Then fly back on AF1...as potus.  It’s just imo, but based on Brazile’s tweet there’s no doubt the 🐀 bas*tards are desperate
@calloutlm1 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Sadly that’s not the only way.  Read D Brazile’s tweet. It was very ominous &amp; didn’t take much to comprehend her meaning.Based on that tweet, there was to be a plot to 187 Trump/Pence, which would make Pelosi potus hence they’re hiding how sick Ginsburg really is/or if even alive
@real_vt16 @Lowcountry1Girl @POTUS He appointed Sessions too, look how crooked he was. DS gets to these people, makes their threats and it’s over.  It’s gut wrenching and sick. The corruption is far deeper than anyone imagined.
@Bud_Doggin @Truthseeker126 She’s either extremely ill, or worse. It’s why Pelosi won’t allow SOTU in Chamber, Ginsburgs absence would need an explanation. It’s also why her &amp; 7D’s(new cab)tried to leave the country last wk w/85 fam mmbrs.Plan was for her to come back onAF1.Brazile’s tweets spilled 187 plot

It’s also imo why she tried to leave the country with 7 D’s and 85 family members last week. The plan was for her to come back on AF1...as potus.

@DennisRWilliam3 I’m guessing Ginsburg is either extremely extremely ill or has already passed away and deep state is trying to cover it up long enough to 187 Trump/Pence so Trump can’t name yet another Justice. These people are THAT desperate and sick. I put nothing past them.
@DennisRWilliam3 It’s also, imo, why Pelosi was trying to leave the country last week with 7 Dems and 85 members of their families.  There was an assignation attempt on Trump and Pence, remember?  DS planned on her coming back on AF1 as potus. Read d Brazile’s tweets. She spilled the beans.
@DennisRWilliam3 It’s why Pelosi is refusing to allow SOTU.  Hard to produce a very sick, more frail than typical Ginsburg, or worse yet...no Ginsburg at all. They’d have to explain that and they can’t.

@GamerBABE3 @RealMattCouch Logically...which is all i have to go on...she has acute pneumonia, based on her age and her recent procedures. I’m not a doctor, but chances are she’s extremely ill or worse. You could be right, though I’m not sure it’d be enough. I wonder if Trump knows what’s going on with her

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Where’s Ginsburg? Have you seen her lately? It’d certainly explain why Nancy is refusing to allow SOTU. It’d be tough to explain a missing Ginsburg. She’s sicker than they’re telling us, or worse. Explains why nan took 85 fam members w/her last week &amp; expected to come back on AF1
@GamerBABE3 @RealMattCouch Yep, me too. But don’t hold your breath. I think there’s far more too this then what they’re telling us.

Folks, if you haven’t heard or read about this, it’s well worth your time to dig into it. The corruption is nauseating and so much more than any of us could have ever imagined. #ThankGodTrumpWon🇺🇸🙏 https://t.co/yfchJFQHK6
@schitzsky You’re absolutely right.  I read that the other night, too. Nancy fully expected to come back from that trip on AF1.  Is that not a gut wrenching thought? Ugh.  Thank GOD Trump is constantly 15 steps ahead of those corrupt 🐀 bas*ards.

@man_sdk @susangarnett11 Then you must be appalled and absolutely LIVID about the anti American crimes Hillary, Clapper, Brennan, Lynch, McCabe, Holder, Yates...etc have gotten away with, RIGHT? Because their crimes are FAR worse than anything Roger Stone has done. Surely you’re not a hypocrite, RIGHT?
@Thomas1774Paine Bc obviously you’re brainless.
@55true4u @Trippledogdare3 Legit question: When was the last time anyone other than a puppet democrat has seen her?  And on video doesn’t count.  Seriously, when was the last time anyone has seen Ginsburg?  Weird, right?
@susangarnett11 Instead of rambling why don’t you spend your time tweeting your proof?
@susangarnett11 There isn’t any evidence. You’re responding, so why can’t you back up your own mouth? Hmmm?
@Cernovich This, like so many of your other asinine tweets, won’t age well. Stop humiliating yourself.
@susangarnett11 Awww, can’t back up your mouth so you have to call in help?!! That’s hilarious...in a pathetic, desperate kind of way.  Bless your heart. You certainly have no problem slandering him, but when it comes to backing it up you can’t do it.  Typical. Keep humiliating yourself.

But she cares so much abt Americans not getting paid? She was going to rip us off had @POTUS not stopped her. #ThankGod4Trump https://t.co/59sg757F6c
RT @WayneDupreeShow: With Nancy Pelosi calling Trump's new proposal a "non-starter," she has taken ownership of the shutdown		So let it be…
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Amy_Siskind Omg. Who is she??  Well, other than a horrible human being. #SewerRats
@RobChristie11 @I_am_MrRick She needs removed from her position....and when i say removed i mean hauled out in handcuffs.
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer doesn’t care about #Americans.  They ONLY care about their SICK POLITICAL GREED AND AGENDA. Make no mistake, folks. They want open borders for a reason. #Trafficking is HUGE BUSINESS. So is drug running. And Gawd knows they benefit from illegal votes. https://t.co/kfevArYc4X
@ChristianWinn @SpeakerPelosi So.  She’s not the one who needs to be in Washington working with President Trump and Republicans to end the Shutdown. What’s your point? Oh wait, you don’t have one.  Kinda creepy you’re stalking my TL though.
@SebGorka @tara2773 Ha!  That’s hilarious!
@SpeakerPelosi shld have to explain to #WTP why she &amp; 7 D’s had 93 family members w/them at TAX PAYER EXPENSE DURING HER GOV SHUTDOWN NO LESS for their trip abroad that @POTUS, THANKFULLY, put a stop to. #ThankGodTrumpWon. Thank God Trump has sense, Pelosi certainly DOESNT. https://t.co/ZF20B5RxQS
Why did @SpeakerPelosi and 7 Democrats have 93 family members with them ready to travel abroad on TAX PAYER EXPENSE DURING NANCY AND CHUCKS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?  Where’s your outrage?  No really? WHERES. YOUR. OUTRAGE?  #HYPOCRITE https://t.co/NxgqW0BJo1

@amjoyshow @KenDilanianNBC Stutter much
Make @SpeakerPelosi explain why she was taking 93 family members on that trip at THE TAX PAYERS EXPENSE DURING HER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. Make her explain that to #WTP and where was her manufactured “security” concern? DO NOT let her off on this. Expose her on this. https://t.co/dksz3YmU0j
Hey, here’s some REAL NEWS the infested msm won’t dare show you. @mitchellreports is too concerned about the cost of jet prep for Nancy, 7 Dems &amp; 93 family members that #Trump (Thank God) cancelled.🙄🤢🤮 https://t.co/h3sLjuaEO3
@buzzman888 @DianeMDeath Omg!!  I had no idea it was that enormous!  That’s incredible!  How sad msm won’t show that. What a pity.
@DoxieMama007 @GregRubini Wasn’t that long ago she said publicly she was afraid to walk in front of her window.  Weird she went from that, to her recent tweet in just a relatively short amount of time, considering the stakes.
Seth Rich, now this. The disregard for human life is grotesque. https://t.co/KtrHZF8F5R
@donnabrazile Seth Rich, now this. The disregard for human life is grotesque.
@trynkeepswimmin @4AllSoulKind @SConfinement @POTUS @USMC @SecretService Oh good.  I went back and saw that a lot had reported it. Sadly i doubt too much is done. But holy cow what else could that mean? Add that to Seth Rich, she needs to be in prison.  Amazing these dirt bags walk free. 😡
@GregRubini Curious how you came up with these names? Donna Brazile just tweeted a very ominous tweet within the last day.  She’s not at any military tribunals nor does it seem like she’s concerned about one.

@JuneMSanders That can only mean one thing. Dirty ba*tards are desperate to remove Trump.  Pretty clear that tweet is a dog whistle of sorts and a sick one.
@JuneMSanders Oh i see what you’re saying.   I’m not referring to the TIME tweet. Tap on it and open it up to read Donna Braziles ominous tweet.
@JuneMSanders He didn’t what?
@SebGorka @dbongino video clip of Pelosi, can’t put together a coherent sentence. Rattled to core. Has referred to “security”sev x’s now yet had 93 fam mmbrs on trip, shows no scrty concern for border. All very odd. Add in Braziles dog whistle. Attempt? #Ginsburg https://t.co/KtrHZF8F5R
@SebGorka Read Donna Brazile’s tweet.  Seems there was to be an assassination plot.  Nancy sure is rattled and note she keeps referring to security yet when it come to the border shes unfazed with security. Odd. Who are the 7 Dems that were scheduled to go on that junket with her?
@SebGorka She’s shook for a reason. Why did she &amp; 7 D’s have 93 Fam members w/them on tax payers dime? Yet Security is such an issue @SpeakerPelosi? Tell us what @donnabrazile tweet could mean? Seems you wanted/needed out of town. Puzzle pieces here. Hope SS is looking at ALL of this. https://t.co/ealSDt3Nb9
@realDonaldTrump Please have your @SecretService visit @donnabrazile. Note ominous tweet that can only mean one thing. https://t.co/d0nOfLZoTd
@donnabrazile Feel stupid yet?
@donnabrazile I’m so glad you’re completely oblivious to the secret service.  Keep tweeting your dog whistles.
🎯🚨So that explains Donna Braziles weird tweet. I knew it had to be a dog whistle. My personal opinion is that #Ginsburg 📨 is getting ready to pass away &amp; Dems are in complete panic mode to stop Trump from another SC nomination. Pray for protection for Trump. Now more than ever https://t.co/dT9vJeLIQK
@PrisonPlanet So that explains Donna Braziles weird tweet. I knew it had to be a dog whistle of some sort. I reported it to @SecretService. Hope others do the same.  These dirtbags have to stop this nonsense.  Pray for our @POTUS https://t.co/9XN4Tx51oE
So that explains @donnabrazile weird tweet. All the more reason @SecretService needs to look in to her. https://t.co/dT9vJeLIQK
@trynkeepswimmin @4AllSoulKind @SConfinement @POTUS @USMC @SecretService I reported her to @SecretService.  Something dark and ominous about that tweet. Be it a dog whistle or whatever, it’s odd and needs looked into.  This nonsense HAS TO STOP by these dirt bags. Trump is our President regardless of their pathetic hurt little feelings.
Tell us again @SpeakerPelosi how much you care about the government shut down and whether people are paid or not when you waste tax payer money like an entitled arrogant pos elitist you are. https://t.co/Ed8xDKaPse

@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Andreas vitriol gets in her way, smacks her in the face AGAIN.
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Not nearly as much as @SpeakerPelosi &amp; 7 dems taking 💥93 family members💥ON THE TAX PAYERS DIME That’s a FACT. During her Gov Shutdown no less. Where’s your outrage about THAT, Andrea? Do you have ANY integrity AT ALL? Find some. Seriously.
I’m sure @jsolomonReports @SaraCarterDC @TomFitton can tell us how much the cost differential between prepping the plane and smuggling 93 family members on that trip at TAX PAYERS EXPENSE would have been, since you’re so concerned, @mitchellreports https://t.co/u0l0JJmxIi
Again, @mitchellreports is too intellectually dishonest to tell you how many family mmbrs @SpeakerPelosi was smuggling on Tax Payers Dime. It’s over 80, btw. And during a gov shut down. Keep in mind Pelosi is worried abt SECURITY &amp; Mitchell abt cost of prepping plane. 0 Integrity https://t.co/u0l0JJmxIi
@mitchellreports isn’t going to tell you how many family members Pelosi had w/ her for this trip...ON OUR DIME, DURING A GOV SHUT DOWN.

@thehill Play the whole clip. She’s a babbling incoherent mess. She needs removed from office. And how many extended family members did she have on that trip w/her? Rumor is over 80.  On our dime. During Gov Shutdown. @SpeakerPelosi you owe #WTP an explanation. We’re waiting to hear it.

@RealMattCouch @Christi48550057 Matt, in the omnibus bill there’s also 240 Mill for the Witness Protection Program. Seems like a rather LARGE amount of $ for such cause, especially when pep like NCain aren’t protected. Do you know anything about this, or if it can be use for anything other than the WPP?  Thanks

It took Trump putting him in his place for him to realize he’s not, now he’s in complete panic mode and scared shi*less, hence his desperation to discredit Trump by any means necessary.

@JBurnetti @warriordaisy @DeplorableChoir @FBI But you slurp up msm propaganda and run with their nonsense simply bc you’ve been so manipulated and dumbed down. Bless your heart.  Anything bad has to be Trump. It’s ridiculous. The man fights for this country every single day. It’s a shame you’re too stupid to understand that
@JBurnetti @warriordaisy @DeplorableChoir @FBI This sense of permanence in where the funding comes from is a more secure reality for military men/women who serve for it is not served up on the whim of things like whether or not Congress will choose to shut down, as opposed to funding the voter’s priorities of border security.
@JBurnetti @warriordaisy @DeplorableChoir @FBI He conflated the “not getting a raise” to the bill he signed in September of this year, which for the first time in a decade, did not tie raises &amp; spending for the military to a “continuing resolution” but rather became a hardened budgetary item.
@JBurnetti @warriordaisy @DeplorableChoir @FBI You’re wrong again.

@sharrell86 That’d be the Obama’s and Clinton’s. Where’s your outrage?
@sharrell86 To be clear you sit silent on nearly 16 MILLION spent on 2 trips JUST ON IN FLIGHT SERVICES, And you sit silent on Obama’s Ireland trip, but Mrs Trumps trip to Africa is gifting.  You don’t look pathetic or desperate at all.  Really. 🙄🤣
@sharrell86 Where’s your outrage??  Hmmm?  Surely you’re not a hypocrite, RIGHT??   Where’s your disgust?  Go ahead and pull up the tweets you posted about it. I’ll wait. #SitDown🤡 You’re nothing but a manipulated puppet hyped up on msm bs. And you slurp up every ridiculous morsel.
@sharrell86 The single largest prior known expense was for Michsels side-trip to Ireland during the 2013 G-8 conference, when she &amp; her entourage booked 30 rooms at the five-star Shelbourne Hotel, &amp; where she stayed in the 1500 square-foot Princess Grace suite at a cost of $3,500 a night.
@sharrell86 trips by the Obamas to Africa and Honolulu, which cost taxpayers $15,885,585.30 in flight expenses alone. 	Keep bawling.
@sharrell86 Hilarious his tweets trigger you.  Keep bawling!
@sharrell86 Trump doesn’t take a pay check nor are we paying for michaels extra staff or Michaels mom. Add in the fact Trump has done more than Obama ever dreamt of doing for this country and us Americans. He can golf. It’s ok.
@sharrell86 You haven’t a clue what time he gets anywhere. Good gawd. And if he only half azz works, yet has accomplished everything he has in just 2 years...holy sh*t that’s even more amazing.  Your theory is doing you absolutely zero justice. You’re too inept to understand that though.
@sharrell86 So?  What’s your point?  Other than you have none.   No where in the article does it say SS is bankrupt, as you claimed.  Nor does it state any of the other lies you stated.  Stop humiliating yourself. You look ridiculous
@JBurnetti @warriordaisy @DeplorableChoir @FBI You’re wrong AGAIN. For 6 of the 8 yrs under BO they received a paltry 1-1.7% raise per year. Even when you factor in the first 2 years' raises under BO of 3%+, Obama’s average raise for the military was 1.9% per year. In President Trump’s first 3 years he has averaged 2.4%.
@sharrell86 Not one thing you stated is factual. Clearly you’ll slurp up any propaganda msm spoon feeds you. Find some integrity, and dignity. You’re grossly lacking both.
@bhawkman @BillKristol Facts and stuff? You mean like the FACT our military will see a nearly 10% raise? By the end of Trumps 1st term they will have had a 9.6% pay increase. Fact. Trumps right.  He didn’t say 10% in one year. Clearly you struggle with comprehension.

At 2.4% per year times 4 years he will have overseen a raise of 9.6% for the troops in his first term. Your vitriol for Trump is clear, so is your ignorance. Keep it up. I love putting idiots in their place.
@imillerand1 @AngrierWHStaff I’m not sure why you’re struggling comprehending the facts of the situation, other than your hate for Trump &amp; predetermined mind set that he is wrong about everything. Which by the way, makes you look inept &amp; childish. Of course BO has a security wall. Why are you hung up on it?
@imillerand1 @AngrierWHStaff In 2017, TMZ reported that the Obamas were building a wall for their D.C. rental property for additional security. Early construction photos showed the red brick fence being built.  Brick pillars were added to the existing brick retaining wall and wrought iron was installed.

And you’re right, it is a shame there’s so many fakes/frauds etc out there.  I’ve fallen for stuff too, we all have.  Don’t worry about it. It happens.
@tokenflyby @stanley59217007 @JoanofAmerica @POTUS @seanhannity That’s not what a legal indictment looks like. And too, We The People can not be a plaintiff. No way this is a legal document. Here’s some real legal indictments, you can easily spot the difference. Sorry. https://t.co/w9btUddOkr
@tokenflyby @stanley59217007 @JoanofAmerica @POTUS @seanhannity Wish it were real, but it’s not. That’s a fake indictment.  Hopefully one day soon she’ll be charged and prosecuted.  But this isn’t it, sadly.

@JakeMc945 @rodsandguitars Here’s the thing. If Trump was so “pro Russia” or controlled by Russia, there’s absolutely NO WAY he would have signed that huge arms deal with Poland. I don’t think they realize how ignorant they sound claiming Trump is pro Russia. They’re either ignorant or totally manipulated
@BlueStateSOS @tenaciousT0286 The sewage is deep. They’re all in it together, sadly. Trump fights an evil most of us can’t imagine and he does it mostly by himself. R’s are just as dirty/corrupt as D’s.

@vickibazter Ohhhhh!  Got ya!  That makes sense.     Yeah, it’s always been my understanding he’s in Rome, but i don’t know “why” or how i came to that conclusion to be perfectly honest.  I guess i just assumed?  Seemed like the logical place.  Now I’m curious. I’m going to dig into it a bit.
@vickibazter In other words, you made the poll, how did you know to include the black pope if you didn’t know about it?!!  That was my only question, really!!  Lol!    Holy cow this is way more complicated than it should have been!!!  My apologies!  🤣
@vickibazter Ok....earlier you asked me about the black pope....you asked where he was.  It confused me, i figured you knew about the blk pope since you made the poll....hence that’s the reason i asked you if you made the poll.  Some people know/some don’t about blk pope and it’s meaning.
@vickibazter Omg! My stomach hurts from laughing!   I feel like we’re Lucy and Ethel!!  Lol
@vickibazter You had asked me about the black pope.  Were you being serious or kidding?!

@GoTrumpFL @55true4u *aggravating ☺️
@GoTrumpFL @55true4u Trump fights an evil most Americans can’t even begin to imagine, and he fights them every single day and almost nearly by himself. It’s aggregating as hell, but true. He can’t do it alone. God knows he’s trying. But the corruption is far too deep and widespread.
@GoTrumpFL @55true4u There’s nothing happening. Horowitz’s IG report was basically a dud. Huber’s will be an even bigger dud; he’s a BO guy. There’s no Grand Jury’s convened. Hillary and her corrupt cohorts still walk free. In fact, DS is very much in control, as gut wrenching as that is it’s a fact.
@GoTrumpFL @55true4u Only if you’re rooting for the deep state.
@GoTrumpFL @55true4u Those two facts alone should be more than enough for anyone to realize the dude was extremely compromised, if not a full blown deep state dirty rat b*stard.  There are several instances i can give, but those two should be enough to rest my case.

@WomenForTrump4 @dogusainc 🙄 no.  Either you have a source confirming this is what Lynch is saying or you don’t.  Not hypothesis.  A FACTUAL SOURCE.  Do you have one or not?
@WomenForTrump4 @dogusainc I get that, but C Heritage is still of impeccable integrity. She’d report.  Do you have a source? Or not?
@WomenForTrump4 @dogusainc If she was ratting all that out, yes, Cathrine Heritage would definitely report it. Absolutely.  Do you have a source?
@dogusainc @WomenForTrump4 There’s reporters there, right?!  I highly doubt she’s ratting it all out. That’s just simply too good to be true.  Sorry, I’m pessimistic about this one!

@BroMark13 @ChadPergram Awww poor @BroMark13 doesn’t like truth/facts &amp; blocked me🙄😂	Just for good measure: 2017, the Fed gov spent $4 trillion, or 10.95 billion per day. The entirety of the nation’s taxpaying illegals don’t even pay enough in taxes to cover what the fed gov spends in ONE day💥
@BroMark13 @ChadPergram Here, let me help you since you clearly haven’t a clue what the difference between legal &amp; illegal means🙄	Of an estimated illegal immigrant workforce of 8 million, 3.4 million, or less than half, are registered with ITINs &amp; are paying taxes. So the majority of illegals are not.
@BroMark13 @ChadPergram And what did illegals pay?
@BroMark13 @ChadPergram IF they work.  And that’s not the point. The point is we’re spending 150 BILLION A YEAR ON ILLEGALS.  Why would you even attempt to justify the atrocity of that unless you’re hell bent on our destruction?

@EliEstherVizio @ChadPergram Oh look. A photoshopped picture.  Find some dignity. You’re grossly lacking
@BroMark13 @ChadPergram We’re spending 150 BILLION on illegals.  Good gawd.   That alone is reason to build it. But more importantly is the safety of our families and grandchildren. Wise up.

@ATX_Cat4 @AAC0519 @thehill Roll your eyes all you want it’s the absolute truth. Most 9/11 hijackers got their visas stamped at his station in Jeddah. Roll your eyes. Brennan changed the wording in training books so not to offend jihadist little feelings. Roll your eyes.  He’s a traitor to this country.
@thehill Brennan is the LAST person who should say anything about our Nat Sec. Clearly he doesn’t want you to remember where most of the 9/11 hi-jackers got their visas approved and stamped and who was in charge of that station. He’s a traitorous bag of sh*t. He should #RotInGitmo
