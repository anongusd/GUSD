@realDonaldTrump NATO doesn't have to pay the USA for security. Two years into the POTUS job and you're still saying the say lie. The 2% of GDP is what the NATO members should try to spend on they military.
@realDonaldTrump You &amp; your entire entourage deserve to be in prison.

@realDonaldTrump Some may complain the USA is a republic &amp; you are a Republican, yet the word you chose to describe the White House is "majesty." You are truly a royal one King POTUS. Comments like that makes one wonder how you relate to the average American living from paycheck to paycheck

@realDonaldTrump The most unscrupulous lying sleaze in POTUS history actually has 33% of Americans voters believe those garbages that he spews https://t.co/FGxMrrqslS
@realDonaldTrump This political ploy to build a wall to protect the nation will receive the necessary funding because enough gullible Americans with the power to vote showed up in November 2018 to elect a Trump backed US Senate. Voter suppression &amp; gerrymandering should be outlawed once &amp; for all
@realDonaldTrump The douchebag POTUS45 had everybody in his circle meeting Kremlin officials; had Jared Kuschner looking for secret communication line inside the Russian embassy; had his lawyer Michael Cohen &amp; Russian gangster Sater conspire to build a Moscow Trump Tower now lies about the FBI?
@realDonaldTrump A sleazebag with six bankruptcies, history of robbing investors, a history of hiring and not paying illegal migrant workers, a history of doing business with shady Russian mobs should not use words like sleaze and failing too often. U&amp;your family should be in prison already.

@LavelleGerald @FranceElaine @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the intelligence community working hard to keep the US safe from all enemies. Now why did Jared need to circumvent that again? The president works for the American people &amp; all works that's done during a presidency must be recorded. POTUS is not a mafia post.

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump Jr is going to get indicted within the next 90 days.
@realDonaldTrump You're not running a banana republic, so give up this enemy of the people rubbish. The poll says the American people believe you're more likely the enemy that has sold the POTUS office to the Russian &amp; Saudi governments. You can't blame the news for telling the truth.
@realDonaldTrump Someone needs to tell this presidential genius he doesn't have an actual emergency to declare, but after all, this would not be any different from all of the other TRUMP LIES!
@realDonaldTrump I guess Trump forgets that there are videos of him ordering immediately withdrawal from Syria. Wow! Trumps LIES again! Furthermore, DJT keeps saying the NY Times is failing? When exactly is the NYT supposed to go bust &amp; will it be anything like Trump's 6 historic bankruptcies?
@realDonaldTrump Bush!t - There's no security crisis.  You're lying &amp; the world knows it. We don't need a wall &amp; Mexico is suppose to be paying for this fiasco as you had promised. Why hold the nation hostage? Deliver on your promise. Go extort Mexico for the $70B to build your wall. Good luck!
@realDonaldTrump What you do to the English language is obscene. Your language skill barely surpasses that of your Slovenian wife at this point. Why don't you let someone write or proofread these senseless messages? For the sake of the nation, stop writing. You're making the US look bad.
@realDonaldTrump Yet the entire Trump mob family members are still at large?
@realDonaldTrump You do know that those Democrats that are not getting paid that you refer to are taxpayers? This should be ground for impeachment alone.
@realDonaldTrump Trump never cared about workers getting paid. Don't forget that Trump still has not paid those who built your Trump Towers,  Atlantic City Casinoes and the list goes on...
@realDonaldTrump It is not surprising that you would say such lie. Statistic would say those working for the government should represent the general population.  Therefore the Dems should equal the Republicans. You never care about the welfare  of working class.
@realDonaldTrump Why don't you pay for the wall yourself? Why force the taxpayers to do what you promised that Mexico would do? Liar...
@realDonaldTrump Someone has got to build the next Trump tower. It's just like you did previously Mr President. Don't you remember? You still have not paid those Polish illegals that built the Trump Tower. How much of a filthy lying thieving dirt bag can you be?

@realDonaldTrump A Senate majority cannot get blocked by a Senate minority, Einstein.  Learn how your government works, Mr President.
@realDonaldTrump Go tell it to Mexico and perhaps they will pay for your wall. We didn't elect the Democrats into the US Congress to pay for your stupid wall while the education system, the infrastructure, healthcare system need money.
@realDonaldTrump Why did we send the military into Syria to do again? Was that mission accomplished? The job is not done. Where are you going?
@realDonaldTrump If you're still in office, how could it be?
@realDonaldTrump Don't you mean Mexico? Allocating money for your stupid wall wasn't what we voted the Democrats into office to do. Get your story together.  The Democrats never promised to pay billions of taxpayers money for building your racist wall.

@LauraLoomer @agensb When do you suppose democratic socialist societies such Norway, Finland &amp; Denmark will include canines in their culinary books?
@agensb @freedom_moates From the partial family lineage you described, one should expect such of dialogue from you. Your father's absenteeism failed to provide inspiration &amp; character building, so now you vent your frustration on Twitter?
@LaecheltNatalie @freedom_moates Which part of the Bill of Rights is that from or should one assume you got that from Trump University!
@agensb @freedom_moates Your father transitioned from "surgeon" (unknownn specialty) to family practice because he was "brilliant?" You're a special type of idiot? Perhaps, you should look up the difference between the two professions. Go ask a med student! Bugger off!
@LaecheltNatalie @freedom_moates If you so treasure shutting the voice of others so much, you should consider migrating to Russia, China, North Korea for a while.

@freedom_moates Patriots such Trump who did everything to avoid military service; denigrate POWs &amp; gold star families; don't pay taxes that the country desperately needs to cover for military expenses &amp; etcetera would be amusing if we weren't in one never-ending war/conflict after another.
@freedom_moates Yet those cowardly so called patriots wrap themselves in Old Glory &amp; boast of how magnificently they would be in defending the Stars &amp; Stripes. Until the thunders &amp; lighting of the battlefield comes forth, we will never know.
@freedom_moates True patriots such Trump who did everything possible to avoid military service; denigrate POWs and gold star families; don't pay the taxes that the country at so desperately needs to cover for the military expenses &amp; etc.;

@sjpshannonland @edwardrodri_ce @feingold32 Military service or an act of equal standard are the only true proofs that one can present in order to call one's self a patriot.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Not a hockey fan or any sports fan actually.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Harley Street in London cost £360 &amp; there is no wait usually or it's free at the NHS or local GP
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann What can they do, make your non-USA spouse pay?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann That's my motto worldwide!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann @StateDept To avoid hearing about it probably. Many USA guys like to go to Phillippines for example &amp; end up in silly local extortions by cops &amp; hoods
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann A smart move is if one owns a business, is to take payment under non-USA spouse's name!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann No... check your accountant on that. And getting the other country to abide by the deduction is often difficult.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Primary care is the first doctor you see on regular basis.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann That is the one problem every ex-pat always complain about. It is taxation without representation.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Get a job in Monaco where it is tax-free and you must pay the USA 15% tax. Get a job anywhere in the world, you will pay regardless. Only US
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann It is a problem that occurs actually. Always check with @StateDept
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann I forgot Americans do not travel much. It's the @SarahPalinUSA syndrome
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann That is 15% tax without the benefit of even getting healthcare. If you did get kidnap in that country, good luck on the US doing much 4U!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann The USA passport will take 15% on every dollar in any country, regardless if you never set foot again on a USA soil again. It is slavery!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann With a CH, NO, DE passport, you can walk into a hospital in the UK, Ireland, and say, I want to work or open a clinic. &amp; it's WelcomeDoctor!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Get a CH, NO, or even UK passport and see how you are different when that accident takes place in a foreign ski slope or scuba dive.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann No taxes or low taxes, health care, security. The USA is the worst for that. Visiting a high number of countries for 90 days is NOT MUCH.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann which country are you going to take your guns to during your visit? A passport is judged by ability to provide one with easy market acce$$
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Not True! DE, CH, NO, UK, Monaco, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein are better and less chances of getting kidnapped in some places. Think $afety!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Great tax rate in Republic of Ireland. Dublin is very cosmopolitan. An Irish passport provides you residency access to EU, NO or CH easily
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton LOL... True ...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton education, infrastructure, healthcare &amp; military should all be of equal priority. USA has a parasitic military industrial complex problem.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton There you go assuming again! Wrong! By the way, European right think USA right wings are stupid and crazy.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @SenateFloor LOL
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @NicolasSarkozy That's funny. I still think that you are probably a Russian FSB ploy, but perhaps I am paranoid! You sure sounds like one.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton LOL... good luck on that...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Are you sure you are? My Irish American friend also assumed she was, but it didn't work out that well. You need to check on that first!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann Do the USA sends out passport b/c of marriage or do you have to apply and satisfy a requirement? https://t.co/KZZxvzkm6Y
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @MicheleBachmann This is so stupid that I am not surprise to hear you repeat her lie. Do you think, the CH government sends out passports because of marriage
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Stop buying into your propaganda. I know more Americans who reside in all of those places &amp; their stories are always the same. USA sucks!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Dow? It's a casino/brothel without a pulse to reality. Jobs, housing of 2017 are result of BHO. Let me know when USA living wage = NO or CH

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Which Bush, W? Perhaps! G H W Bush &amp; Reagan are mixed. But why should the world love your leader. Do you love Merkel, Tito, @NicolasSarkozy?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Not True. I know that fact personally regarding both places. You assume too much...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton @SenateFloor U R paranoid
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Many Americans have many guns, while many do not own guns. I don't know anyone in NY, NJ, CT, MA, MS, FL or CA who owned guns in 27 yrs
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Israel &amp; Switzerland have mandatory military conscription and citizens are required to keep their military guns at home. Not AR15 but autos
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton precious metals would be safer...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton yes
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton The worst got elected! The world is shocked! America is suffering for it!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Many Americans are living in Switzerland, Norway, Denmark, UK and are baffled by their fellow Americans who have no healthcare yet pay taxes
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton That's why Congresswoman @MicheleBachmann had the audacity to run 4president 2012 as a GOP &amp; yet applied &amp; received a Swiss citizenship
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Heard mentality is always detrimental to innovation. Stop joining gangs and become an independent rather that just another team supporter.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Bitcoin outcome should have been expected, although  the concept was brilliant.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Russia/Putin spearheaded a worldwide populist concept which failed in France and will be probably fail in USA 2018. Forget Deutschland 2017!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Americans are too immature for the 2nd Amendment. Switzerland and Israel per capita have more guns, yet will never match the US in murders.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton By citizens following parties blindly, America ends up with Americans who think that act if they were just cheering for a football team.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton By misunderstanding a constitution, comes forth unconstitutional applications of laws and abuse of rights.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton The USA is not a dictatorship ran by Executive Orders. The Executive Office is not the place to make or interpret laws.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Did you notice how fast @SenTedCruz ran out of there after Yates humiliated him.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton approved by who?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Misinterpretation of the Constitution comes often by many.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Obama is a constitutional lawyer and how many times have he broken the constitution?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Constitutional law is a class all law student must pass and understand. You do not have to be a constitutional lawyer to read and u/d it!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton https://t.co/FU0mpRSVvo
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton It's legality is based on the constitution.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton It is not standard practice to fire someone who is investigating your office! This is a sign of corruption. Even Lincoln had investigation
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton And it was investigated and nothing came of it!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton That is not the same. Trump has asked Bharara to stay and then fired him the next month for investigating his business.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Yate only said the truth. The EO was not constitutional. Comey-- in Clinton 2016, but otherwise I'm not aware of any
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton The one time in US history a president tried to fire someone who was investigating him was Nixon. It was the only time.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton They did no such thing. They appointees were replaced in orderly fashions. Trump had a fire alarm emergency exit routine.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Such acts are acceptable for a banana republic. You seem to like the idea of a tyrant that cannot be control by any law. Why is that?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton ...And Trump has not broken the law? You are so special!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Trump had asked Bharara to stay &amp; upon discovering about the investigations into his NY matters, he quickly fired him and all US Attorneys.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton And why did he need the extra day? Perhaps it was to clear some things?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Trump is playing fast with the laws &amp; there are those who are already tired of his games and expect similar maneuvers.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Have you any evidence of it? Why do you think he needed the weekend? Are you saying he did not know that he would be fired? It's obvious man
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton You said it yourself. Look up your previous statement from the previous day.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton In any law environment (school, court, etc) a legal opinion comes with references.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton He did that to make time to remove documents from his office and supplied. This guy is also a brilliant legal scholar. Trump is in trouble!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton If &amp; when you're ask to provide a legal/scientific/medical opinion, always use references unless it's something that you conjured personally
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton This is something in laws we always tell individuals to do. It creates a paper trail of proof that can be followed. Especially on computers
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS The native Americans told the Europeans that the earth belongs to no man. We are only passing on it for a very short time and then return2it
You seem to have a picture of USSR for Norway https://t.co/alV5VFr1cn
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton In such legal documents, legal quotations and references are the norms...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Germany, USA, Canada, UK, Qatar, Bahama, Switzerland, Sweden. Don't assume. I belong to no gang. I am world wide. The earth belongs 2no man
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Not Republican! Few Democrats wanted his head, but BHO should have done that, but didn't for it would have looked bad for Dems in 2016.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Comey had a history of always writing memos to his staffs regarding any meeting he had with higher ups. That is why Bush had trouble with'em
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Democrats were upset b/c of the election fiasco. Comey was investigating Trump &amp; made entry of their meeting just as he did with Bush.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Even the memo from Deputy AG was not formal for it had no legal quotations or referral for legal grounds &amp; only news quotes. VERY WEAK
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS @HillaryClinton Trump was praising Comey 4Hillary. See the video of him trying to hug Comey in the WH while Comey was trying to keep his distance.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS The same way, Trump was so happy with Comey b4 &amp; suddenly now he is so upset about how @HillaryClinton was treated. LOL it is too funny...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Bingo! That is why there is always another crazy happening, when something else is happening! It is a deflection from the real problem.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Sure you  do! Americans cannot speak foreign languages. They spend too much time being the greatest at doing not much.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS You live in fairy tale world that suddenly seem to think that Russia is a US pal. Intelligence must be actively applied at all times.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS I gave you Men With Hill a while back. Go &amp; read on it! If your dream BS really existed, than you would be speaking Russian or Arabic by now
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Jan 23 Yates told the WH about Flynn and @POTUS was trying to get rid of her to avoid any further investigation on Flynn b4 the press knew
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Nobody shared any info. It is a lie Trump pass around to deflect from the real investigation, which is Russia and Trump.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS You spend so much time lying that you think, the rest of the world needs to join you. Instead, rather just read more often. Open your mind
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Not correct. Intelligence must not be destroyed. It place the nation under great danger. TRY TO THINK WHY IS THAT!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS That's if SCOTUS take the case first of all. Secondly, if you notice the WH hasn't pushed for another attempt. @realDonaldTrump knows better
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS NOTICE THE DATE SEQUENCES &amp; SEE IT WAS A PLOY IF YOU CAN THINK THAT HARD. JAN 23, 2017 https://t.co/MlwzoqXO81
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS It did not need to go to SCOTUS to be deemed as unconstitutional. A lower court can also decides as it was done already twice.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Intelligence are never destroyed first of all. AG unmasked all the times. That is how they catch bad guys. Nobody shared info. Trump lied!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS It was right after she told the White House about General Flynn during the same week. The Muslim ban failed 2x for it wasn't Constitutional
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS How many Americans were arrested for spying because of such process? Look up your history and understand how stupid it would be otherwise.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS The AG can unmasked anyone he/she thinks is suspicious. It is similar to telling a cop that he cannot pull over suspicious cars.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS which explains why the Muslim Ban failed twice so far?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS Yates was fired after telling Trump about Flynn. The Muslim Ban was just a ploy that he and his lawyers knew would not be Constitutional.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You do not need books or videos and it shows by your lack of understanding of basic civic rules and laws which I knew as a child.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @POTUS https://t.co/HgRUUAy4j7
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You had not much civic lessons in high school I guess. You  can get some free ones on YouTube. G luck!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort If you are not going to read, at least use youtube. I gave you a video. Try to understand what is impeachment! It's not that difficult 2 u/d
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort GOP will have to decide between losing or following. That is the soft political ground Trump is expected to face. Russia can't help now
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort That is exactly what Preet Bharara was working on regarding when @POTUS  quickly fired him and all US Federal Attorneys.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You would never get out of a law school. Read mate! I provided you enough already. Look up Trump Azerbaijan Iran connection.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The US does not pay for the world's defence either. It pays for its own defence. If it would mind its business, it would be better for all
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort No, he did not manage to do anything like that. The payment remains the same. It was all a ploy. Wake up!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort LOL... that is very funny since the economy of EU is better than the USA. I rather live in EU than the USA. Better health benefits.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The US Senate and House is up for the Democrats to lose in 2018. Trump is vile and the GOP is in trouble.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The concept of NATO was created by the US to keep the US from losing a war by keeping more partners on the ready for defence.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are rehashing the Trump rubbish I see... He is an idiot and is making the country more stupid in the process.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort This is not how NATO works! It is not on an investment as you put it. Each country is supposed to spend 2-3% of their GDP on arms.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort No, Le Pen during the election goes to kiss Putin's ring in Moscow and got her money for the election from Russia. Just like Farage did.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort BS. California would become the 6th largest economy in the world if it broke away. Every year CA provides more money for red states' welfare
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Do you know how NATO work. Please look it up! Gosh, I cannot believe you were in the military too? Paying who? What is this, the mafia? LOL
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Please do not say stupid things like that. Those countries do not pay the US for NATO membership. This Trump is such an idiot.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort actually is it from Russia this plan was spearheaded. It has lost much of it wind power after the Trump fiasco.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort They have yet to do that, but now, they will and this will open without much force like a soft moist crevice
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Divide and conquer!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Is the USA an experiment?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort How about Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage? They are all Putin's dogs
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Putin also wants NATO to break up. Where did you hear that before? Trump?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort would you like the USA to break up? That is how stupid it is for the EU to break up!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Brits do not want to lose out on their ability to have EU privilege of working and travelling in the EU.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort that is not what the UK are saying now... They want the EU to stay and unemployment is the lowest it has been in a long time. Look it up
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort @MLP_officiel They blame it on immigration which is rubbish. It's funny, where small town idiots with no outside interactions complain about foreigners.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Norway is not in the EU. UK wants to have what Norway has, but Norway pays for the deal. UK does not want to pay which is funny.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Putin was even trying to get California to break away. This plan just got dumped last week.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort ...and it is going down further as the inflation increase and the earning price decline. Yes, the getting out of the EU was a great idea
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Have you been to UK lately? I also have a clinic there. The place pound is of concern to all. The pound is 130 to the dollar.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort In medicine, we say, if you hear galloping hooves, think horses and not zebra and more often than none you would be correct.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort LOL... Faulty? You were the one that showed that Trump's money came from DB which is already known internationally for washing Russian $$$
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort How many Russian gangsters owns flats in Trump Tower? Buying his property at higher prices seem to be a way to pay him off too.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort France was smart enough not to bite the election like the USA did. Trump is also Putin's pet!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Bulgaria, Latvia, Rumania, Poland, all saw an increase of right wings supported by the Kremlin. France @MLP_officiel  is owned by Putin
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Putin needed to break up the EU. He got Nigel Farage to deliver that. He needed to own Ukraine, he got his man in there, and also in Hungary

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort That is how Putin becomes the richest man on earth today according to the CIA.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort still money from unknown sources which needs to become legal through some transactions regardless of loss or profits.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort came to the rescue. You understand how DB was lending money out from the article. The loans were undersigned by Russians dirty funds
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Trump was not able to get any money for his projects and then in 2008 after the crash and everybody else was in trouble with banks, Russia
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Trump was supposed to make this problem go away, but now it is all up in the air.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort B4 the Crimea invasion, Putin had a $500,000,000,000 oil deal with your current Secretary of State which got blocked by Obama.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort It is not just a DB problem or a Russian problem or a Putin problem. It is much larger than that. Putin needs this Trump deal to make $$$
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Your president is done! Preet Bharara knew of this and that is how they will hit him... That is why he fired Preet.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Is that why he is so quiet on Twitter today? I would say that was the sound of a nervous man!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You talk like a poor man who has no idea of what anything is really worth or how something acquires a price worth.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The investors were Russians dirty money

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort why spend so much time with an ignorant man, when you can read these things yourself? Why are you trying to prove 2me that Trump is a saint
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Trump golf courses, Trump Palace, and Soho are all paid for by Russian money via Cyprus banks...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Good old fashion RICO I would say they will try for... Trump is nervous for a good reason now...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort $85,000,000,000 net worth is what the CIA estimate Putin is worth. The money is not from his good deeds. His daughter is worth$2,000,000,000
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Money laundering... Where do you think Putin gets his money when his job pays $120,000/year...

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Ever heard of Men With Hill RAF? Do you know how it works? It still does. Same as it was in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, 10s, etc...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Remember, I don't know anything... right?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Flynn is the only fish that is totally cooked on this BBQ. Page and Manafort are the others, but not as well as Flynn. Manafort will be next
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You do not follow much of this I see. But you do have heart for your team.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort That would be the easy target, but the better one would be to follow the money in NYC. The Soho building Trump owns there is bad news.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort That's why Trump is whining so much about wiretap. Besides, he was recorded by more than one international intel agency...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Making up that manure again? The last FISA on Flynn was last July and by then they had him on record saying far too much to return.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are welcomed!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You must be the last to know. The reason there is no talking about Flynn or a deal made by the prosecution with Flynn, is because he is done
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are making up sh!ts again! Flynn wrote and requested clarification which he received and went against the better advice.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Putin paid and Flynn swallowed!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are making up sh!ts again!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Why should that? I am not getting paid for this service! And even if I was, do you know how many people actually take good advice?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You mean no president, Flynn is not one.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You can visit Flynn upon his conviction and express your interpretation of the law to him.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort It is called general consensus for in my profession, personal opinion is not as important as a general consensus. Professional consensus!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort ever heard of google? Try to do some research for once in your life and not be spoon fed like some lazy lizard baking in the sun.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort LOL... You need to change country. They have you so suppressed that you think the rest of the world is suffering like you.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are a true diehard. Flynn is in more trouble than any other at the moment. But Trump will be in more trouble by years' end.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort I also went to Nottingham for law
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort LOL...Why would I need to pretend such a thing? I guess it is because education is so hard to come by for you in the USA. It cost so much.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Look up the long form of the rules and avoid the short ones for it does not clarify it enough for you.

@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort What rules?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Well stop making them up
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Many ex US military who goes to Israel, French Foreign Legion or UK military do that secretly. It's illegal.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort He can never work for a foreign governments unless the military says it's ok and they never do give such permission.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Israel is probably the only one you could get away but I wouldn't go telling the world about that.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort No foreign governments money without speaking to the military first.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort LOL! Who are you talking about?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You are so special...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort How about reading up on these things rather than believing all the lies. Look them up.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort RT money comes directly from the Kremlin. Why are you so stupid?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort That's not legal under military regulations...sorry
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort I see you are not a military man. That's common knowledge. Look it up. Don't waste my time.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Kidnapping a person in the USA to be sent to Turkey for execution is big and will be problematic when court time comes.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Flynn also plotted to kidnap a Turkish green card holder to be executed to Turkey. He's in deep, deep sh!t
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Both Flynn and Manaford were never registered as a foreign agents. Flynn cannot legally be a foreign agent as a retired US army general.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Flynn had asked the military to confirm and they did. that letter is public now.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The military clearly said one cannot accept foreign governments' money on retirement. Flynn even received a letter confirming that.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Not so
@age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Look up the Nixon's Saturday night massacre and perhaps it would help you understand why Trump is in trouble.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Who graduated from FSB Academy...how much more do you need.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort RT is the propaganda office for Putin
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The military does the telling. He also got a letter dictating that fact.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Wow! You actually know a name...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort What job is that? Who are you talking about? Does it even matter?
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Manaford is a big Putin guy with a long history....
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort It's​ record... Evidence...
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Why are Trump followers so dumb? They refuse to accept the facts.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You don't know who is Preet Bharara? Look it up.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Mansfield spent most of the $12,000,000 he got from Ukraine which actually came via a Russian/Putin man.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You don't read fast enough to keep up with all the facts. Flynn is in deep. Page had been under investigation since 2013.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Flynn as a retired US General who gets paid monthly by the army had no business getting paid by Russia or plot to kidnap a Turkish in USA.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort No it was not their jobs. Furthermore, intel from several agencies confirm that. On tape they have Page for sure.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Preet Bharara was investigating Trump for money laundering, Russian mob, Putin association and that's why Trump is nervous. Russian money!
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Preet Barrat was fired because he was investigating Trump's business in New York.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The investigation on Trump was always there! Trump lies so much he has you believing that those guys were contacting Putin without him.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Be real now. Why would you go to Russia if your boss was not in on it? Without Trump they could not promise Putin anything.
@Micky_Finn @txsweettar225 @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Notice the Clown is suddenly so quiet. He knows he went too far now.
@Micky_Finn @txsweettar225 @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort Conclusion is when charges will be handed out. Flynn, Tate, Page, will get time. Trump is obstructing and will go 4at least that.
@Micky_Finn @txsweettar225 @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort The investigation is not finished. This may take months or years. There are so many characters to go after. It's​ all the president's men 2
@KestrelArts @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort In a dictatorship you're idea would work but in a democracy, we would end up with someone Trump.
@KestrelArts @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort It's like a cop pulling you over for a red light and you decide to tell him he's fired because you're a taxpayer.  Remember Nixon?
@KestrelArts @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort You and Trump miss the point that once the POTUS is under investigation by the FBI,  he cannot dictate his terms to the investigators.
@age_akkerman @PoliticalShort It's all about Trump.
@Micky_Finn @age_akkerman @PoliticalShort There was already an ongoing investigation on Trump by the FBI. As you said, the incidence was rightfully noted on record &amp; now we all know.

@SpeakerRyan it's simple. If a politician is owned by big money, don't vote for them. If they lose next election, the voters will  win!
@SpeakerRyan Politicians like Ryan listen only to the big money donors and lie to their constituents. What would happen if we vote them out?
@SpeakerRyan you're the one that is too stupid to realized that fooling the voters with disinformation can get you out of a job real fast.
@SpeakerRyan taxation without representation is what started the USA. Today, clowns like Ryan thinks we're too dumb to know our history!
@SpeakerRyan it's a simple process. If you don't look out for the voters, get the hell out of that public office! Get a job from your donors
@SpeakerRyan Americans will get universal heath insurance the day they get rid of all those crooked politicians like Speaker Ryan!

@Impeach_D_Trump The whole administration should be in a nice shade of orange garb to match @POTUS.
@SouthLoneStar @POTUS Poor Bubba! Do you want to cry now?
@NatureGuy101 @TheJusticeDept Resign? He should be taken to Guantanamo for enhanced interrogation. According2 @POTUS it works so let's do it
@ACLU Lock them UP!
@RT_com Sessions looks guilty as hell &amp; the investigation hasn't even started! Who will be next? All the Trump presidential staff are dirty!
@colinjones @thedailybeast Sure you do! Liar is written all over his face.
@RT_America @RT_com Russia owns all of them in the Trump administration
@RawStory That fat Jersey guy should go to prison!
@thedailybeast @jaymichaelson Orange jumpsuit would do all of them fine.
@TIME Microalgae for biofuel is the solution.
@CBSNews those crooked Trump presidential staff should go to prison for treason and the process would be cheaper by the dozens.
@colinjones there goes another one! How many days until this guy resigns?
@colinjones @thedailybeast whenever a politician, a lawyer or a criminal says he doesn't recall a recent event you should assume he's lying.
@Cham_Bowers @NBCNews which Congress was not?
@leigh_deise @ABC How long after Session and Flynn  go to prison do you think Trump will get impeached for treason?

@NBCNews It sounds like AG Session did not inhale or perhaps he only blew while at the Russian meeting!
@DailyCaller perhaps the number is true, but wait to what @POTUS will say about that! It's always more fun to hear it from the Donald
@NBCNews Trailor trash bringing @WhiteHouse down to her level! Who cares who paid for the sofa? Not her!
@HuffingtonPost @realDonaldTrump is taking advantage of a grieving widow. How low will the bum go?
@MSNBC Pass the handcuffs, please. This one must go!
@mattmfm Let's see how far this goes! It will be the difference between justice and a new era of @realDonaldTrump politics!
@NBCNews AG Session would look good in prison garbs! But then again, I'm 2easily satisfied! What's the likelihood of this Congress abiding?
@ABC Yes, AG Session should resign but he's not a democrat &amp; therefore, will not have to. Welcome to a new USA political era! Get comfy!
@RawStory this bum Ted Cruz has no credibility left anymore.
@NBCNews Like any dictator, one must control the media or else they tend to lose control of the tyranny very quickly! @POTUS is no different
@MSNBC But will you get the prosecutor? It probably will not happen this year. This greased pig is very slippery &amp; @POTUS is feeling lucky!
@SpeakerRyan 2008 is right around the corner! Build that bonfire boy!
@realDonaldTrump F what the gamblers in @WSJ think! They are the ones that will cause the next economic disaster which is due any days now!
@realDonaldTrump It's the bottom 98% who are buying&amp;keeping the economy up! Give them the tax breaks &amp; the not the top 2%! Know who backed U
@realDonaldTrump Make the middle/lower class great again &amp; stop pretending 2b 4the people. It is the bottom 98% buyers who build the economy
@realDonaldTrump That means nothing. It just a few millionaires gambling in casinos! Close the income gap! Increase the buying power of USA!
@SamsungNorge Recover from that little exploding battery embarrassment from last year. I use to love Samsung!

@realDonaldTrump impeachment is real
@SpeakerRyan liar! Ryan wants more tax breaks for his rich sponsors.
@HuffingtonPost It's hard to speak up about something that his supporters enjoy. Remember, election 2018 is not far from today!
@AnnCoulter Get a mirror!
@tedcruz You are such a clown!
@NBCNews Lock him up! @POTUS conspired with @PutinRF_Eng and corrupted the election 2016!
@realDonaldTrump Investigate Trump and the Russians conspiracy!
@POTUS One term president is the goal. Tyrants must go back to the golf course and stay there!
@HuffingtonPost 2018 is sooner than you think. Take down this tyrant by voting his congress out of office!
@MSNBC The media built this monster &amp; now he has returned to bite them. Continue to push for truth &amp; do your job! @POTUS will cower down!
@ABC @realDonaldTrump is the loser in the end. The press must continue to do their jobs and never cave in. Who got him in the @WhiteHouse ??
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @CNN There is nothing about @realDonaldTrump that is real!
@nytimes Don't trust any politician who wants to shut down the news. @POTUS is a tyrant that on must confront early or else it will be hell
@nytimes Keep reporting the truth about that liar @realDonaldTrump and @foxnewspolitics will continue to dispense @POTUS propaganda!
@MSNBC Stupid is as stupid does, but nefarious is a whole different matter. @realDonaldTrump is a special Russian puppet!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @CNN @POTUS lies about everything and calls the news fake? It is a farce to accept any story that comes this man.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @CNN the credibility of any news media DJT feels comfortable with should be questioned for @realDonaldTrump lies
@nytimes The validity of any news outlet that DJT feels comfortable enough to talk to should be questioned. The man is a chronic liar!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Yo Trump! How is Putin doing back there?
@ABC Trump is the master slinger of fake! Faux News is the only real news for DJT. Lying got the Donald in the Whitehouse. He lies 4anything

@MSNBC Orange jumpsuit for the Clown to match his face?
@MSNBC Why blame @realDonaldTrump's campaign officials when you know U want to say @POTUS got busted conspiring with the Russians.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls forget the leak spin and get your lawyer. Orange is soon to be your color of the day and your boss love that shade!
@CNN Tell me something that I didn't know last year. When do we get the Clown out of here is the question? Trump is morally bankrupted again
@ABC And he lied again? Where is the news here?
@NBCNews Keep your eyes on those hands May! That dear lady would endure anything for the Union Jack, but there should be a limit!
@FoxNews Divided over what, the stench?
@HuffingtonPost I am still having a hard time spitting out "President Trump" and now I must live with "President Pence?" Please wake me up
@HuffingtonPost Could? It is going to make Watergate look like an exageration of justice. The scary part is getting use to saying Pres Pence
@HuffingtonPost and many other lies to come! Tell me something new!
@ABC ROTFLMAO... Please stop! That's the best joke this clown has given this year!
@DailyCaller There should be a warrant on the Clown already. If this was @POTUS44 they would be lynching him by now.
@FoxNews The look on that face says that poor women is proof that money does not buy happiness.
@nytimes @POTUS is so obvious with his defending any and everything the press said about @PutinRF_Eng that one would think they are lovers.
@nytimes Where is the surprise there? I could've told you that since last year. @POTUS is the best defense attorney @PutinRF_Eng could have
@FoxNews @seanhannity 45 is the swamp! You mean this is a political suicide attempt of which I would have to concur on that possibility.
@NBCNews @POTUS' tie and tie to Russia are both bleeding a deep annoying red and that orange paint job is not helping!
@FoxNews @seanhannity @POTUS I believe @POTUS is doing very well by himself on that matter! The Clown needs to help with self destruction!
@MSNBC The @WhiteHouse is not a religion where we must go on blind faith and believe. Trusting a politician to tell the truth is foolish!
@DailyCaller Say anything to draw the press away from the fiasco about Russia, @realDonaldTrump and General Flynn.
@AllenWest @AllenWest has no pride or respect for the Constitution or the nation!
@NBCNews Go get em and make sure you put that foul-mouthed orange clown in prison!
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Forget the leaks, I want to hear what did @realDonaldTrump knew and when?
@TerryMoran Flynn could not promise anything to Russia without TRUMP's knowledge so go figures! Arrest that orange clown &amp; call up the squad
@FoxNews @petehoekstra The American people became Russians suddenly? We use to have firing squads for such acts!
@FoxNews @julieroginsky Only Democrats? Where are the rest of the patriots or have the GOP joined the Russians?
@HuffingtonPost If we had a real press corp there would now be a Pres. @HillaryClinton , or @BernieSanders or some more acceptable GOP.
@HuffingtonPost If there was a real press corp there would be no President @realDonaldTrump today or any of the other clowns in this circus
@HuffingtonPost because DJT was hoping the problem would blow away like all the others did since the press are not doing their jobs anymore!
@RawStory You don't say! What is it about this TRUMP administration that keeps giving the GOP the hope that they are still in Kansas?
@abrown735 @BBCWorld You have been asleep last year? There is a golden shower loving Russian intelligence asset sleeping the White House.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews Why do you think it is so common for many black Americans to not want return to the US after living in Europe?
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews Police shootings of civilians are not even reported or recorded nationally in the USA.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews https://t.co/j78SalTWH6
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews To a UK cop, it would have been murder. To a Scandinavian cop too. Forget Germany as that cop would be in jail.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews watching videos of cops wearing T-shirts mocking the last words of a dead man begging "I can't breath" is hard.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews perhaps, but when one sees the reactions by LEOs regarding death of unarmed citizens, it gives concerns.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews is 26 years of residence enough in the US enough?
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews I took the NYPD exam in mid 80s and then in early 90s and did very well both times.
@thedailybeast He was only following orders. Arrest Trump!
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews I love cops! Took the NYPD test 2x &amp; decided on meds instead. Then came YouTube &amp; killed all my hopes 4mankind.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews why do you think that would be?
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews if I saw a cop hurt, my reaction would be to run to his rescue unless in the US, than I'm a call 911&amp; stay safe.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews I do until the trust is burnt on regular basis.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews actually I know cops in US and EU. I'm relaxed in Europe and very attentive around US cops.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews if there was as many dead unarmed citizens from simple interactions with any group, I would say yes.

RT @DoughNutJaine: Okay. Fine. Let's investigate Trump instead. @Mediaite
@Mediaite I used to respect this guy. Go figures!
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews I never see those cops behave like US cops.
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews Solution=justice for all. Have you ever been in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, or Denmark?
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews so why do you want cops? Let anyone be sympathetic to the victims and move on!
@tuc9 @homosassian @FoxNews Apply the same rules in healthcare. Would you trust your nurse if there were you videos of her killing patients?
