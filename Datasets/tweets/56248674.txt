@NPeters It disappointing because I your ‘intelligent’ friend don’t agree with the method adopted by yr side. So I don’t have the bonafides to think for myself? I must join your side? Nope! I believe separating kids is bad but it’s the Law &amp; Politics stupid!

@NPeters 2). Give ICE powers to detain those who cross the border illegally with ‘their’ children and expedite their deportation back to their country.if its asylum let them apply for asylum at port of entry or country of residence? Is that difficult or it’s about something else?
@NPeters 1).If we actually calm down and filter ulterior partisan-gaming to win political space for November elections we can actually solve this problem. Do you know that this policy is legal? Backed by law &amp; guided by court decisions? Why can’t we change the law
@NPeters ‘All lives matter’&amp; ‘Black lives matter’ all have one thing in common at least? Obeying due process in a fair &amp; just manner without discrimination based on status in life for All Americans?

@CapehartJ Talibans are accessors to murdering US citizen and joined in the hip with AQ...distinction btw them not fundamental !
@sybilt41 @CapehartJ hi let's stop name calling, just bring out your points intelligently
@CapehartJ Taliban hosted AQ and gave them support to hit us at home,even if Tal didn't . That's assessors to killing us &amp; same as AQ
@CapehartJ that distinction is butter &amp; margarine,Taliban &amp; Al Qaeda may be different in nomenclature but same in war &amp; hatred for USA .
@CapehartJ Really?next time they come kill us here, let's just raise the flag &amp; ask for negotiation.

@azizauko what values guide n influence you as a liberal? Is it not your moral and faith beliefs? So is the founding values of USA
@azizauko So what value do you think influenced the founding fathers if America? Secular ? Christian? Islam? Atheist?
@tmks44 am just amazed at your source of data! Evolution??? Hope u know that majority of Christians believe in the Bible and Creation?
@tmks44 And if I disagree with #Obama policies I am a bigot or hater or sell out?? Interesting thesis , my moderate republican???
@tmks44 u still don't accept the fact that majority of American r smarter than u think, they watch FOX not bcos its popular but the best
@tmks44 you guys r so fox hyped! But millions of Americans can't be wrong, ask CNN,msnbc how is the ratings
@NewsNinja2012 Meghan? Who? She has no value nor adds no value to conservatism or GOP. Don't waste tweet time on her
@azizauko am sure your bishop is homophobic and racist , your grand parents or ancestors from your concepts!
@azizauko racism &amp; gay are not synonymous, liberal r just setting up abstract to argue.
@azizauko wrong!
@azizauko so is America constitution , traditions , culture, founding ethos agreeable to changing the definition of marriage?
@azizauko so the right of Muslims to marry 4 wives too, the right of traditional American natives/ immigrants to marry more than 1 wife too?
@azizauko really ? Good spin? And also RFK I'd brother too for the same reason! Liberals nothing is beyond your abstract n inventions

@tmks44 sorry u r 	Wrong statistics check IRS date, has proved that most small biz make	 More than $1m.Question, wht is yr small biz?
@azizauko liberals like setting up false arguments n make their case on it. This is not about rights of gays ,it's about what marriage means
@azizauko u can't just change what the institution of marriage is? Never , it won't happen .
@azizauko ,comparing gay rights to black rights insults  blacks, gays in america r still doing their thing nobody is stoping them
@azizauko still dodging! The issue is marriage is btw man n woman period! Gays can have their rights not change marriage
@azizauko see you r dodging the issue I was born black n it does not wash, proof to me that gays were born gay n these r same issues
@azizauko ,so u believe the lie that it is a human right issue? How	 About polygamy,HR issue too
@azizauko ,still a liberal won't accept the truth when he/she see it
@tmks44 Ok ,see ya !am off for now..conservatives must go enjoy the beauty of America...
@tmks44 Dont you think you r agreeing with me and making my point Bro!
@tmks44 So why is Apple,Goggle and Microsoft even IBM still doing well?
@tmks44 ,You really think he produces nothing? really?  your concept of productivity?until you mold or build tangibles personally
@azizauko ,even the liberal press n your friend Al r all gone mute
@azizauko now r u seeing the emerging facts that racial  issues r not involved
@tmks44 , Is this youreconomic thesis? because of Demand? Ask CEO of HP?It has to do with New Biz model?Hp must innovate
@tmks44  you think $1m is such a big sum in global biz market? that is what takes you off middle class. Whose benchmark,liberals?
@tmks44 ,Capital  redundant is caused by bad policies of present govt,investors need confident to invest capital,simple!
@azizauko ,Whats Up? lady are u still in bed sleeping? So how do u see the evolving??? Zimmerman?Martin case N Obama Gay evolving
@tmks44 No insults please!  i assume you can make your arguments w/o adopting default liberal tactics :personal insults and abstracts.
@tmks44,15% is too little how about making the evil rich people who create jobs and make more than $1m pay 90% tax from their evil wealth,
@tmks44 the rich do not create job? I have created jobs employed people , paid them wages, I am talking from experience not theories!

# This lie by liberals that under 30s evangelical Christian support gay marriage is delusion! Just heard @Eliot Sptizer ,what is he smokin?
If Gay marriage is civil rights,what about polygamy that some of us where born into! Our great great great grand fathers lived it
#Gay marriage alright.So let's also not discriminate against some of us who are polygamist. It also our civil rights! #Obama what say u?

Seriously now I am thinking about being a #Muslim. At least I don't hear all this politicking about Bishops of "churches" &amp; gay marriage
@NewsNinja2012 which black community is he referring to? Delusions of a liberal.
@NewsNinja2012 let us see what these so called church leaders will tell us? That "god" spoke to them that #Obama  is the messiah?
@tmks44 do u know the difference btw income tax n capital gain tax? N how many Americans really pay fed income tax? N do u ?

@tmks44 really! Last time I saw this type of statement was from Karl Max writings. Seriously you really believe in all what u hv written?
@tmks44 talking point? Ok so am so dumb I can't use my God given brains except I praise #Obama. Sorry most of us see beyond 1%\99%
@carrollcnn, it is obvious that CNN &amp; the other liberal main stream media is in tank for #Obama  but must u be so obvious as an anchor?

@azizauko wrong again! No law in Florida has done that.it is whether human did what they ought to have done by the law that is what we wait
@azizauko it is a crime that has been committed we r saying give the boy n his family justice not hang over racial wars and politics
@azizauko #u get it wrong why he was not arrested is both legal n policy so let us wait n see who was right or wrong.why must race come in
@azizauko #azizauko it was the premise of a racist white society that made us point out that this man is Hispanic not white
@azizauko #azizauko that is not the issue?the issue was that it was a white man who shot a black kid
@azizauko the truth? Blacks  and whites .r all guilty
@azizauko good! Ask it the other way too? Are some blacks not racist?
@azizauko #azizauko  have u ask yourself why blacks in America hate and antagonize non native black Americans.want to see racism come ask
@azizauko so many cases of black on black killing in Chicago is cold dead..where is Al Sharpton
@azizauko #am sure u guys would be singing Xmas if Zimmerman turned out to be white
@azizauko #azizauko so why would n Hispanic man conclude that a boy is a criminal because the boy is black
@azizauko Al Sharpton uses race as a biz venture the real warriors for equality are all dead.we now have race venturist
@azizauko you may not realize it that black on black discrimination n racist act are on the high.Al never did anything to stop racism
#azizauko we don't have all the facts why conclude that this was a race related crime
What ploy u people brought race into it w/o knowing the ethnic make of the suspect,see it is not all clear
@azizauko in Chicago kids black n white r being killed like rats where is Al Sharpton in his race baiters?
@azizauko Zimmerman is not white .he is Hispanic
@azizauko see Zimmerman is Hispanic a minority like Martin so what is all this race none sense when facts r not all out yet
@azizauko there must be justice for the boy other issues are silly-race etc
@azizauko all of them except Obama.at the end we will line behind GOP nominee

@WandaSmithV103 yes! Love to all my liberal brothers and sisters.
@azizauko that is the issue u can't force it even in employers health plan bcos its may be against their conscience just like abortion.
@azizauko the Sct will tell us if the US govt can abridge the 1st Amendmt ,wait then we talk ideology.
@azizauko am really surprised that u can't even look at issues without blind adherence to liberal ideology.this issue will end on the US SCr

@azizauko in America today contraceptives is available to everyone sold in every corner.that WH lie is about ideology.USA will fight back.
@azizauko just goggle 1st Amendment of USA const.  And the US Supreme Court. All that your WH gist is bull. You can't change 200yr history
@azizauko as a matter of fact I use them but must you force those whose faith n conscience is against it? See 1st Amendment to US Const.
@azizauko ok but you guy quoted bible recently as basis of his taxing the rich
@azizauko at least as a Christian let us know where your Obama is coming from.we hate his policies not his person
