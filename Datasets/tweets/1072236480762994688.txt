@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED You forgot two extra bullet points:	-Freeze the interest rates on these loans with one of Skeletor's freeze-rays.	-Force the unaccredited institution staff to endure 1000 hours in the Spider pit.
@SenTomCotton @SenJohnKennedy If you sweeten the deal by allowing exemptions for Supervillains to this victim notification process, then you shall have Skeletor's vote. He needs the element of surprise to better vanquish the forces of good.
@nytimes Love is merely a biochemical reaction that prevents Senators from achieving world domination. It shall be cast aside into the lava pits with Skeletor's enemies.
@nytimes First they came for Facebook, and Skeletor said nothing. Then they came for Instagram, and he said nothing. Then, when there were no apps but the Calculator left on his computer, he had no means of vanquishing those filthy Russian with the power of square roots.
@nytimes Skeletor's grand healthcare bill shall include Coliseum battles to rid the population of the weak. Those astronomical deductibles shall be replaced with free medical care in the clinics that treat the stab wounds of the victors! May the odds be forever their favor!
@ChrisMurphyCT Maybe we could strike a bipartisan compromise by teaching mathematics with AK-47's?  First grade exams shall include a practical portion, where students are expected to fire a number of shots equal to the solution (2+2=4 gun shots). #SkeletorInTheSchools
@ShnydaOne @CNN Great question, but Skeletor was specifically appealing to promising new henchmen by using their vulnerability to his advantage.

@SenWhitehouse @exxonmobil Skeletor shall destroy these nefarious fossil fuels with his incinerator gun, igniting them with a fiery inferno of the sun's mantle! Once we vanquish them, our problems shall be solved, and we shall never speak of them again.
@CNN The solution to existential loneliness is to join the hardworking staff at Skeletor's many fortresses of doom. In addition to employment with a rising star senator, they will be find camaraderie with muscular, obedient henchmen who are committed to a vision of world domination.
@politico This force will allow humanity to be victorious in their endless intergalactic war against the Cylons, and is definitely an appropriate use of taxpayer money. Senator Skeletor's vote will be a screaming, piercing "yes." https://t.co/skbuHxkiRE
Skeletor's focus for his 2020 re-election is an extensive GOTV operation using the modern technology of email. Are you interested in signing up for Skeletor's mailing list? He promises to limit his emails to a minimum of 300/day.
@politicalwire Skeletor is excited to unearth the political skeletons in the closet of this memoir. Dare we find the bone puns in his name to be...humerus?

@SenSanders Skeletor proposes that we siphon the brains of these judges and replace them with a viscous mind-control goo. Subsequently, their juidical decisions will reflect the unerring will of Skeletor. Of course, this will qualify as a pre-existing condition when they apply for insurance https://t.co/FSGQIXc3Mf
@nytimes Skeletor was able to win re-election despite his lack of charisma and documented 14 genocides. Thank you to 41% of constituents who voted for me; your obedience shall be rewarded with beet rations and Subway coupons @SUBWAY
Your Senator would like to remind his invaluable voters that his approval ratings are declining only because of filthy lies that have been spread about him. They are certainly not because of his remarks at the League of Women Voters.
@CNN Senator Skeletor shall work tirelessly to save these children by making bombastic speeches denouncing His enemies and refusing to compromise with the opposite political party. The children's love for him shall be profound and lasting for decades.
@SenatorCantwell These warnings shall include a shrieking, blood-curdling scream that both terrifies people into shelters and harrows the enemies of Senators Skeletor and Cantwell. The shelters shall include snacks such as Keebler fudge cookies. https://t.co/oVT2GrQrnG

@ballotpedia This is the location of Skeletor's Fortress of Doom in Boise, Idaho. Not seen are the debilitating force fields that prevent our constituent swine from entering to contact their busy, god-like senators.
@LindseyGrahamSC @TeamCavuto @FoxNews Senator Graham, please remind the nation of our Senatorial effort to inflict darkness upon the American people for generations. They shall neither question the motives of their Senators nor their absolute authority in promoting malevolence. Regards, Sen. Skeletor.
@SenatorTimScott @stevenmnuchin1 @senrobportman @JohnCornyn @SenToddYoung @RoyBlunt @SenCapito These opportunity zones shall permit greater power consolidation for Senators! Skeletor shall ensure that all senators rule their constituents with a punishing, iron fist!
@TheEllenShow @driverminnie If she was not willing to carpool with undead voters, then Skeletor is not interested. Too long have ghouls, wraiths, and skeletons been disenfranchised at the graveyard polling places!
@SenJeffMerkley These families shall flee further to Skeletor's Fortress of Doom in Laredo, TX. I will ensure that they will not only have hearty meals in their bellys, but martial arts training to inflict unrelenting punishments on their former jailers (as well as movie nights on Fridays).
@SenJohnThune Senator Skeletor was very excited to learn that this bill allocates 40% of South Dakota crop yields to bulking up henchmen in His Washington DC fortress of doom. The henchmen shall be both muscular and menacing, which incorporates South Dakota values.

@KamalaHarris Skeletor's fiscal plans include full funding for constructing a Fortress of Doom in International Falls, MN. Those filthy Canadians shall experience the wrath of 100 angry henchmen armed with plasma lasers and black-belt karate fists.
@CNN Skeletor's plan for increasing the availability of freeze-rays to the American consumer is both bipartisan and constitutional. All potential prepetrators of gun violence shall be encased in iceblocks and shipped to Baffin Island.
@CNN Skeletor applauds this bipartisan resolution opposing genocide, which is sure to distract the voting population from the 14 genocides in which he has partook this year as a Senator.
@KamalaHarris Unacceptable!  Your Esteemed Senator Skeletor shall unleash his ravenous hellhounds to dispatch of those who would harm children, leaving only fire and brimstone remaining of those responsible!
@NewYorker @untitledproject Skeletor has still not yet recovered from the cancellation of "Bones." He demands a full re-boot of the show, along with a personal luncheon with David Boreanaz @David_Boreanaz

@CNN I shall command them to make new products with the fortified bones of their enemies, per Skeletor's preference. The tampons shall be both durable of frame and spirit, and the consumers shall lavish Him with praises.
I met with Suzie Smithers today, who is studying at the University of Phoenix @UOPX to obtain her Bachelor's in Caligraphy. Student debt has reached crisis proportions in America! Skeletor cares deeply about this, because his approval ratings are drastically falling. https://t.co/McpTLuDCzJ
@nytimes Senator Skeletor supports and encourages heated exchanges in the US congress! Let your hatred cupeth overflow through your veins!

@TheEllenShow @Realeugenelevy Skeletor does not tolerate obscenities! As a senator, he will use his FCC leverage to inundate 1000 curses upon those who profane!

@SenAlexander Healthcare costs have long skyrocketed because pesky superheroes inflict injuries on our henchmen and ravage our plans for global domination! Currently, supervillains need to complete 300 pages of paperwork to register with the US Department of Labor. Let's cut the red tape!
