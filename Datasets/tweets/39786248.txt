Longer dive here from Harvey aftermath for @bbcworldservice @pritheworld and w/ @rbnicholson. Also how @fema did not have basic information in Spanish (or many Spanish speakers; none when I visited its table) at the massive shelter at height of capacity. https://t.co/RzLIRAnQjf
I asked Silvia how surviving these disasters has changed her life. “A lot,” she says. “What we have today could be gone tomorrow. “ For now, she appreciates some stability, and hopes it stays that way.
Silvia has decorated their new apartment with art — prints of sunflowers, orchids, a Yosemite landscape — in old frames that she has rescued from the trash. It's quite beautiful. Her kids have made new friends. https://t.co/xUpFdHhnWA
I saw Silvia again recently in Houston. Finances were week by week before Harvey. More so since her husband was deported to Honduras. So recovery has been very slow, helped by friends, the church and the Dollar Store. No wiggle room. https://t.co/YPzKzMjIZQ
Instead, she and her kids slept those first nights in their wet, molding apartment, and then w/ friends. This is what one of their rooms looked like. Credit: @jakeprice https://t.co/z0a1NzdjZ6
Despite more than 15 years in the US, she wouldn't go to the city's big shelter. Undocumented, she worried about the police/official presence, getting asked for papers.
