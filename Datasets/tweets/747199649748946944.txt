@Sam4219RBX What 'bout me for POTUS?
@VP29NUSA @HeIIoOffice @QinoxxRBX @JaneLHarrison2 @SecPatCoyne @realJordWalker This is why I am against the 17th Amendment, which provided for the direct election of Senators. The former upper House's responsibility was to guard against the idiocy of the general population, as they were deemed by the Framers to not be well educated enough. Still true today!
@VP29NUSA @HeIIoOffice @QinoxxRBX @JaneLHarrison2 @SecPatCoyne @realJordWalker So is democracy in and of itself. The People as a whole are like impressionable children; easily fooled into making the wrong decision. Decisions have consequences and it is far harder to reverse a decision than to undertake one.
@VP29NUSA @JaneLHarrison2 @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker I doubt all of them will be. However, the IQ of Society and the average IQ of good paying jobs is increasing, so at some point there will be no room for stupid people in the economy. No other way to put it.
@VP29NUSA @JaneLHarrison2 @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker Mhm.
@VP29NUSA @JaneLHarrison2 @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker Particularly with the eventuality that the BS/BA is the norm, and that now you need an MS, MA, MBA, , etc. Even for attorneys, LLB has not been good enough since the 60s. It was made into JD.
@VP29NUSA @JaneLHarrison2 @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker "Can" - that's another issue: a lot of jobs that require degrees, ie debt be taken on, don't make a salary worth it. 1/2
@VP29NUSA @JaneLHarrison2 @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker Be careful saying that. It is a correlation, not a causation.
@VP29NUSA Krazy* ;)
@JaneLHarrison2 @VP29NUSA @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker That pace is too slow. And I don't care how much schools change. It is the attitudes of the People and of Society that needs to change; stop forcing kids to go to college and fall into debt when there are a quarter of a million skilled positions in the trades which are vacant.
@JaneLHarrison2 @VP29NUSA @HeIIoOffice @SecPatCoyne @QinoxxRBX @realJordWalker Speaking of, McDonalds and other min. wage jobs were never meant to support families. It has been corrupted!

Five month hiatus from Roblox? (Meaning I say bye-bye until mid-to-late June)

No, I am not off to HUSA. But I might be off to another 5 month hiatus from Roblox, just as I did last year from January to June.

@Kavanaugh_RBX @TravisKabob Speeches are PART of the session; its why Morning Session exists. This is the Senate, for God's sake. And shooting Senators suppresses their voices, and their votes as they have to respawn and could miss an electronic or voice vote.
@TravisKabob @Kavanaugh_RBX The atmosphere in the GOP Caucus slows down progress. I cannot fix that atmosphere, so I joined a less caustic one instead.
@TravisKabob @Kavanaugh_RBX I have never switched Conferences because of who has the Majority. I switched over who I feel works better with me, for I cannot serve the American People alone. And in this case, the Constitutionalists will assist me more.
@Kavanaugh_RBX @TravisKabob You, Senator, were shooting your fellow Senators on the Floor. Don't talk about holding up sessions.

We, the Congress, should consider Bills that weren't passed dead when a new Congress begins, and allow for Recess Appointments and Pocket Vetoes to be a thing in addition to Floor Leaders choosing not to put some Bills on the Agenda. AKA: We should strive for realism!

@RblxPattyCode @MiaWallacen @MrAdamStratton @SECHLSNUSA While Ms. Wallace is incorrect, so are you. He is under immense pressure and thus any apologies and/or realizations are forced, and therefore not valid. He'll be back.
@FounderIsner It is disgusting that you would imply that I am corrupt. For one thing, I would not accept a bribe. And for another thing, I have been a Judge before and so I would not accept that job either. You, sir, are no longer my friend.

Firstly, everytime the Vice President DMs me, I assume it is about something political and tell him to shut up because I do not listen to lobbyists, including my own Party's Whips. From the evidence seen by myself, I will vote nay on the impeachment of the VP.
I motioned to remove the Majority Leader of the Senate (@Kavanaugh_RBX) from the Floor tonight for repeatedly assaulting with a deadly weapon (firearms) and even going so far to murder multiple Senators, including myself. This behavior will not be tolerated.

@NUSA_Fitz Screw that fancy shit. Just "We The People" will do.
@Sam4219RBX It is tradition that he is the longest-serving (not oldest!) member of the Majority, as the Majority has the votes to elect the PPT. And to kick the PPT from office. Resign in peace or I will be forced to introduce a resolution of no-confidence.
@JtportRBLX On some issues they do. It doesn't matter here, though as each and every party opposes all others. In-fact, one could say that the Libertarian Party of NUSA (the most recent one) is a splinter from the GOP, making it inherently in opposition.
As @Sam4219RBX is no longer a Member of the Majority in the Senate, I have requested that he tender his resignation as PPT immediately.
@JtportRBLX I'll bet you're 20 lol.
@JtportRBLX 20 seems old.

@Risen_Orbs I have told you twice now, and will not repeat myself again.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX disproved* and we'll see if I can procure the official results.
@Risen_Orbs That is not how the term is used.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Yes, and that has been disproven as it was based on arbitrary information. So quit quoting it.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX @Sam4219RBX https://t.co/oI0vUaViCB
@Risen_Orbs Senior does not mean old. It means that you've been in the Senate longer. Seniority does not equal Age.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX What, no I didn't? I said I rose and you fell. Once again I must repeat, it is true that I rose b/c I won. Did you fall? Likely but not for certain.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX @Sam4219RBX https://t.co/IGRTNupEXL
@Risen_Orbs Appointed? What? And not oldest. Most senior. It is not the equivalent.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Yes, I asked him before you. https://t.co/IBExVLuPUb
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX I didn't say I gained more of the vote than you, just that you fell and I rose. We know that I rose because I was elected. We do not know conclusively that you fell, but it is likely.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX @Sam4219RBX Jody won't release the numbers.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Evidently not. I was under the impression that it did. At this point, both of our arguments are moot as neither of us can establish a baseline of where we ended up at the finish line by the number of votes. What a pity.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX I didn't see your part, I apologize.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX A) rose*; B) And then you fell.
@Risen_Orbs The PPT is the most Senior Senator of the Majority. The Chairman is the Senator of the Majority that has sat on that committee uninterrupted for the longest time. The Ranking Member (or Vice Chairman of certain Standing Committees) is the same, but of the Minority.
@Kavanaugh_RBX @mrconjman @lavendersights @TravisKabob @MrCaldwellRBX I did, on purpose. Decided it was the best way to twist his intentions.. can't troll me bro!

@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX You have showed me no such thing.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Show me the evidence that I have or would ever ignore citizens. What a bogus charge!
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX This is obvious because you didn't remain #1 in the final results.
@Risen_Orbs Not as chair. Learn the traditions of the Senate that we attempt to model.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Votes of yours were filtered out.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX From 1 to 4, I would call that a fall.
@Risen_Orbs Stop insulting and argue!
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX So you fell 3 and I gained 5, which means that I had no bots/alts and you have a few.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX We both watched the preliminary results live, as you indicated when you said that I was 8th or 9th.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Not at all. A) Quit ending your paragraphs with insults; doing so does nothing to advance your argument. B) You were unsure of who he was, so I told you. C) Pepe is a loser because he tries to but fails to get Penelope throughout the series, as you should know.
@Risen_Orbs Stop spitting vitriol and produce substance as I am.
@Risen_Orbs Yes, I can see that. What of it?
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX After filtering I was 5th and you were 4th. The funny thing is that I rose and you fell, meaning you had more alts and/or bots vote for you than I did.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Odd that you criticize my pfp (Sam Walton, Founder of Wal-Mart and Richest Man in the World until his Death), and yet turn around and tell me to not show off? How contradictory and confusing.
@Risen_Orbs I actually like to know what I'm talking about, and do more so than you, contrary to your misguided opinion.
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Pepe Le Pew*
@Risen_Orbs @chewdog10RBLX Says the person with Chester the Skunk as your profile pic. He is a sad loser, my friend.
@Risen_Orbs What? That makes no sense at all. Former means you had been a Senator and Committee Member, but are not now. I advise you to go read two things: (a) A Dictionary, and (b) https://t.co/NGCSarqPCk or wikipedia (check for reliable sources), or even ask your senator's office.

@Risen_Orbs I. I didn't ask for your fucking resume. II. We shall follow tradition, and you are not senior b/c you left the committee.

@ItsTacusRBLX @EpicnessKing @ghostbleed_USA @RaVenQ_Real @B282_ @sunsides And me to be Sheriff, ofc.
@Risen_Orbs You don't run for chairman/ranking member. Just as better committee spots and office space opens up to more senior Senators first, so does the chairman/ranking member position. The most senior Senator on that committee (not of the Senate) is Chair/Ranking Member.

@Jolly_SirRBX Indeed, and I thank God that they were caught. Now if only they could be prosecuted? We need to cut down on this, as it occurs every single election.
@Jolly_SirRBX What did I say? I went from 10th to 5th after filtering.

@FrankieNUSA @Sam4219RBX @AesciaRBLX @MrCaldwellRBX Bernard tried to Nixon Aescia. I wouldn't be surprised if it were true that Aescia is, subconsciously even, trying to get rid of Bernard now.

@TravisKabob @MrCaldwellRBX Presidents Andrew Johnson, Millard Fillmore, John Tyler, and Chester Arthur all served a full term without a VP. All 4 assumed the office of POTUS after the death of the President (lame duck presidents), did not choose to nominate a VP, and were/did not run for re-election.
I was not elected to the top 7, but I will not concede the election yet as I am hoping that after filtering, I will have won. Anything is possible.

@NUSA_Fitz If we want to go back even further that unfortunate week, FDR declined to see Japanese diplomats and barred them from the white house as it is speculated that he needed it to appear as a surprise attack, and didn't want them to give them a declaration of war.

@NUSA_Fitz I'd like to define virtually. Radar, the then new British system, was unreliable and distrusted by most. Early on the morning of 7 Dec, 1941, a US military radar technician in Hawaii detected a blip and reported it to his supervisor, who dismissed it as a flock of birds, 1/2

@Gunlow3 @WiIIMcAvoy They will only continue to become more partisan. I am not for this show of force, preferring instead John Bercow's style in Westminster.
@Gunlow3 @WiIIMcAvoy And by doing so, they are partisan. They steer the Majority Party of the House in that way. They set the agenda. https://t.co/fO8xk6HreV
@Gunlow3 @WiIIMcAvoy Incorrect. It is partisan, unlike the Speaker of the House of Commons and most unlike the Senate PPT.

As a Realist, the PPT of the Senate should be elected by custom, i.e. he/she is always the most senior Senator. The Majority Leader, therefore, would handle the scheduling of bills on the floor agenda. This is how it is done in RL and should be conducted here. Make the change!

@NUSA_Fitz As a Student of AP Psychology, I understand that if I were to say I feel sorry for your loss, or even say that she didn't deserve you, and that she's worse off, not you: studies show that my saying either of those things actually CONFIRMS your sorrow and feelings of loss. 1/2

@PatriotServant @Lordsights That is no excuse for corruption. As long as voters had the option to write-in someone, then it would've still been competition. Even without that option, Halos still deserved to win by running unopposed as Sights CHOSE to withdraw/forfeit.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights The fact remains that the RNC extended the Primary Season to accommodate a TARDY candidate. The only question is whether favoritism was a factor, and since the RNC would not likely have granted the same extension to someone less notable, favoritism IS, indeed, a factor.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights You've got the proof. So be an American, and disperse it for public scrutiny. Or are you ashamed of your actions as a Party, let alone as the Republican National Committee?
@PatriotServant @Lordsights At this point you're disorganized idiots, or just liars. I can no longer tell which, if not both.
@PatriotServant /=Or Therefore, you should check your trello. Or anything else, (i.e. etc), including your mind. But you are too partisan to accurately look at your own motives/mind, of course. So ignore that last source of evidence in your search.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights That doesn't mean that proof doesn't exist. It merely means that a coverup is possible, or simply that the proof has not yet came out. But it will. It will.
@PatriotServant You want proof? Go have a look at your own RNC Discord Servers/Trellos, etc. Then, put your bias to the side and you will see the proof. Or just think about your own motives. You'll see immediately the proof.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights "then" If you understand politics so well, then you should understand what a pivot is. The question is now yours.
@PatriotServant There is motive. You all like Frosty, and are biased/partial towards her. I guarantee you that if a largely unknown Republican had asked for a primary extension, the RNC would not have even considered said request.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights Parties come from Parties just as Babies come from Sex. You cannot stop this first fact just as Abortion cannot stop this second fact.
@PatriotServant @Lordsights Where'd it spawn from then, Mr. Politician?

@devToolsRBLX @Kavanaugh_RBX In real life, yes. In NUSA, they are there to determine what they agree with, and what they don't. What is "well written" and what is not. How trivial.
@LacrymaNUSA @devToolsRBLX @realTimGeithner However, it is worth noting that we are both arguing similar points, but from different angles: I, that the Supreme Court is already political in nature, and he that even if it has become so, it doesn't matter. He trusts them to not be abusive and I don't.
@LacrymaNUSA @devToolsRBLX @realTimGeithner Bullcrap. Suppressing fire isn't meant to hit you. It just looks good, meaning to scare the enemy, or keep them pinned down. I.E. 100 tweets not hitting their mark is worth 1 tweet that hits true. I haven't yet seen a hit from any of those comments.
We are failing to represent portions of the US Military. For example, I'd like to see Warrant Officers represented, at least insofar as the US Army's Aviation Warrant Officers. Creating a specialized niche should increase the marketability of such a program.
@realTimGeithner @devToolsRBLX Not necessarily. It may take a while to change the tide of the Court by changing its composition, and that takes time, as we aren't dealing with 85 year old retiring Anthony Kennedys on Roblox. Instead, they choose when to retire, as they do not die.
@GeorgeM_RBX Since it affects the Senate, it NEEDS to be either an Act or a Joint Resolution. You have merely labeled it as a House Resolution, but also as an Act. Very confusing. Don't sit in conference committees if you can help it!
@GeorgeM_RBX Decent. But is it an Act or a House Resolution? Imo, it should be a House Joint Resolution, to encompass the Senate. Doesn't need to be signed by POTUS as it only affects Congress. I normally wouldn't like proxies at all, but it seems to be the easiest way to reach quorum.
Agreed completely. #FixTheConstitution https://t.co/3dlnY1F2ky
"What you call pain, I call the body's 'check engine light'."
Why is the Supreme Court exercising a legislative role by choosing to adopt Amendments to the Constitution or not? Are we blind to what is plain: that the Court would have a serious liability to its impartiality if an Amendment were to involve itself or the Courts in general.
Should I still be elected to the U.S. Senate, I plan to _truly_ represent the interests of the Armed Forces.

@MrCaldwellRBX Congress used to have a few holding cells in the basement of the Capitol where those detainees would be held. Supreme Court upheld the matter in the early 1800s, without right to trial, actually. The power was given to Committee Chairmen, as well as the Presiding Officers. 3/2
@MrCaldwellRBX to the Department of Justice for prosecution. 2/2
@MrCaldwellRBX Congress does not throw people in prison anymore. They used to hold people in contempt until the end of the legislative term or Congress (2 years at most, although usually until the end of the current one). However, due to this problem, they now refer all contempt of congress 1/2

@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX How ominious. I sense political motivation here.
@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX Nor is making a false statement my good friend.
@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX And so is Mr. Monty a Judge? Wondering where his authority comes from and if he himself should be disclosing such a sentence without a trial. Now that, my good sir, could very well be a violation of Mr. Clark's privacy.
@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX Sure, but I shouldn't get drunk and go stumbling around my house. Doesn't make it illegal.
@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX @cookie_bunz Even though it is likely you have no idea who I am.
@SanguisFarron @LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX @cookie_bunz Okay but it still isn't provable lol. I hope you agree with my logic. I'm hear for you @JackClarkRX
@LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX @SanguisFarron And the only person that can confirm or deny such an accusation is Mr. Farron himself. If he does, then he himself has revealed the facts, not Mr. Clark, as Mr. Farron could easily deny such an accusation.
@LawMonty_ @JackClarkRX @SanguisFarron Additionally, You'd need to prove that that account is, in-fact, Mr. Farron's. And even if it is, No one has invaded anyone's privacy because that account doesn't mention anything not found on troll accounts or bots, other then the fact that he has a dad. Oh wow, shocker!

@BenjaminOakmont It is not equal to a PhD as an SJD is.
@BenjaminOakmont It does not require a dissertation, just as an M.D. does not.
@BenjaminOakmont Just a Highschool Diploma.
@BenjaminOakmont JD is graduate. A bachelors is not required in all states or all law schools. In-fact, in some states if you take and pass the Bar, you can practice. No law school necessary.
@realTimGeithner @largeTitanic2  https://t.co/I4f3aNZ94H
@BenjaminOakmont In america, LLD is honorary, whereas the equivalent JSD or SJD is the PhD-version. Only legal professors normally take it.
@BenjaminOakmont A dissertation (thesis) is not required. Please be aware that not all graduate level degrees are doctorates. You've got JD  (LLB), LLM, and LLD.
@BenjaminOakmont A JD used to be considered a bachelor's degree, and still is internationally as an LLB. The doctoral form is an LLD, which we also recognize and administer  in the US for those wanting to do legal research or to teach law.
@BenjaminOakmont Agreed wholeheartedly. But those doctors are PhDs, Not JDs. Why? Because one does what's similar to a master's degree and the other does a master's degree and then the doctoral studies, finalized by a thesis. Law students don't do thesis'.
@BenjaminOakmont  https://t.co/kiFHk8Ooe0
@BenjaminOakmont I believe Dr. King was a reverend, so his doctorate stemmed from a religious degree, Not a JD. Hence why we call him the Reverend Dr. King.
@BenjaminOakmont JDs don't call themselves doctor. Law school is similar to a master's program, and is not nearly as rigorous as med school.
