Trump was briefed about Putin‚Äôs election meddling two weeks before the election? That‚Äôs surprising, because I‚Äôm guessing he knew way before that.
So, Trump is inviting Putin to the White House in the Fall. Is that the Fall of 2018 or the Fall of Democracy?
I can't believe they‚Äôre just inviting Putin into the White House. At least the Trojans made the Greeks use a horse.
We can expect Putin to be shown the same hospitality in Washington D.C. that Trump was shown when he visited Moscow. So we might want to Scotchguard the Lincoln Bedroom.

Quick, does anyone have a phone charger I can borrow? My battery is almost dea
I've never been a fan of maps. If they're at 1/10,000th scale, then why am I supposed to pay "full" price? http://t.co/G7HYmLF0ZC
The only time I opposed fracking was when I thought Marcellus Shale was a jazz musician.

Last night's show, my best yet. http://t.co/7Bp02CtN6L
People are worried that the McCutcheon ruling will bring change to politics. But it will mostly bring large bills and checks.
I'm so glad the SCOTUS overturned campaign donation limits. Now if they can just take up Twitter character limits. I have so much more to sa
The Supreme Court's ruling in McCutcheon vs. FEC is a huge victory for free speech, motherfuckers!
Bonus: My holy grail came with a holy danish. Never knew Jesus spent time in Denmark.
Tonight @emilybazelon, explains the newly uncapped limits on campaign donations, but my attention is still capped at three minutes.
My guest tonight, @MarkMazzettiNYT profiles the CIA in his new book, "The Way of the Knife" - he'll teach me how to julienne a terrorist.
Researchers say daylight savings time is linked to heart attacks. But the good news is, you get to die one hour later!
A study found that popular kids are more likely to be bullied. Makes sense. Even bullies don't want to be caught hanging around losers.
College athletes want to get paid? Who do they think they are, the coach/staff/concessions guy/janitor?
More than 7.1 million people signed up for Obamacare. So embarrassing. Obama missed his goal of 7 million people by over 100,000.
I trended for 36 hours straight. Top that, #MuffinsThatLookLikeHamburgers!

P. Diddy is changing his name back to Puff Daddy! Kids, ask your parents who Puff Daddy was. Parents, ask your kids who P. Diddy is.
If you're watching a rerun, my guest tonight is former President Jimmy Carter!
Of all the former Presidents who have been on my show, Jimmy Carter is by far the most former.
Fun Fact: Before his long career as "ex-president", Jimmy Carter once served as the president! Look it up!
The Colbert Report tonight = ALL Jimmy Carter, ALL the time. Until 12:01am.
Tonight was the 75th installment of my "Better Know a District" Series. Only 25 more and I get a free 6" sub!

You can't escape your SAT scores. Even after you die, there's no way a 1420 will get you into an Ivy League Heaven.
Kids, don't sweat the SATs. Stress makes you choke and fail and then your life will be over forever. SO DON'T SWEAT IT.
To eagle-eyed viewers who spotted guest Randy Farrar's fake beard, he informed me he had to wear a disguise for "legal reasons, my man!"
Forget Bill Nye the Science Guy. I much prefer "Neil deGrasse Tyson the Astrophysics Guy, Son!"
I love my church because they offer Casual Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays thru Thursdays.
Daylight Savings Time started this weekend. Which means I finally won the 4-month standoff I've been having with my oven clock.
I consider my tweets the "fifth act" of my show. So watch commercials before and after reading this.
Happy Birthday to you, devoted @StephenAtHome follower! Note: if today's not your birthday, read this tweet when it is.
Are woman held to unrealistic standards?  I telepathically asked my wife, but for some reason she hasn't answered.
Hey, has anybody thought of just tweeting Putin out of Ukraine? #ANGERTWEET! Done. How hard was that, Obama?
The FDA wants to put new labels on our food - just when I'd grown accustomed to the taste of our current labels!
Yes, there are downsides to having a woman president. What if she has to try and open a jar of pickles in front of a foreign dignitary!?
The creator of House of Cards, Beau Willimon, is on my show tonight. SPOILER ALERT: We do an interview.
If my guest was such an expert on the future, then why did our interview take place in the past? #Checkmate
March is National Kidney Month! Fun Fact: There are actually two kidney months, but you only need one.

Nation, you may have disagreed with some aspects of ‚ÄúLaser Klan,‚Äù but you have to respect the choice to not make the dog talk.
Reagan at 69 is completely different than Hillary at 69 and I‚Äôm sorry I just put Reagan, Hillary, and 69 in your head right now.
A Chicago man in a Breaking Bad t-shirt was arrested for cooking meth. Memo to self: stop wearing Dexter t-shirt.
Rush Limbaugh can criticize Hillary Clinton's age. After all, he's opted out of aging and gone straight to melting.
Conservatives are trying to make Hillary Clinton's age a campaign issue. It's the ultimate October 1947 Surprise!
Not to brag, but I was into @St_Vincent before she was canonized.
Green update: The Colbert Report went paperless today thanks to a nasty paper jam.
The "Got Milk" ad campaign is ending after 20 years. Oh no. Now how will people hear about milk?

Congratulations to Team USA for all the gold medals! Remember: You represent all Americans, so 1/315 millionth of that gold is mine. Pay up!
I hope Buddy Cole finds gay propaganda in Russia. Or at least figures out why those hammers &amp; sickles are rubbing up against each other.
You can bid on my Bill O'Reilly's microwave! http://t.co/cabkJsSfBl Free shipping if you live within however far I can throw a microwave!
Been searching for that six-to-ten year old microwave taste in your re-heated bagel bites? Look no further! http://t.co/cabkJsSfBl!
I never use gendered pronouns because I only ever talk about myself.
Congrats to @jimmyfallon - Today, the Tonight Show; Tomorrow, the Today Show!  #watchtcolbert #tivofallon http://t.co/JpKNweMd8w
A study says that teens are more stressed than adults. Relax, kids, it's not important unless it affects the ENTIRE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
A new study revealed that crocodiles can climb trees. Great, another animal I have to worry about pooping on me.
I love the Olympics! It's like the World Cup of all the sports I care about more than soccer.
Prediction: America will take home the gold in tonight's Opening Ceremonies!#GoTeamUSA
Let the games begin! SPOILER ALERT: Team USA wins every medal. Twice. #GoTeamUSA
Journalists in Sochi are tweeting about horrible hotel conditions. Specifically, they're all full of whiney journalists.
My guest tonight is NYT columnist Paul Krugman. But if he's here, who's taking care of his high horse?
Facebook has a great new feature that lets you relive the last ten years of procrastination and wasted time in one efficient minute!
Why couldn't Pussy Riot call themselves something a little more polite, like "Vagina Scuffle"?
I understand JK Rowling's writer's remorse. There are episodes of the Report that I think don't have nearly enough me in them.
Just came down with Super Bowl fever. Makes sense, everybody around me yesterday seemed to have it.
No spoilers for Superbowl XLVIII. I'm only halfway through Superbowl XXII.
I've already painted my chest for the big game this Sunday. However, I'm thinking about adding an accent leg.
My State Of The Union live tweeting begins now. For next year. Wow. Obama sure is taking his sweet time showing up
Mistakenly bet the Seahawks would win last night's State Of The Union. Obviously the winner was Joe Biden's teeth.
I finally finished my training to become an NFL quarterback. It took ages to spell my name with that Xbox controller.

Tune in all week for all my exciting Superb Owl XLVIII! It's just like Rocky V, but with more XLIII!
Pope Francis said the internet is "a gift from God." Sounds like somebody hasn't scrolled down to the comments section yet.
China stole my show, so I'm now claiming credit for papermaking, gunpowder, the Great Wall, and one of the two chopsticks.
Now that Net Neutrality's ended, some people will pay more for the Internet. So if you're reading this tweet, please send me $1.50.
Good Luck @USOlympic Team as you head to Russia ‚Äì tweet at me if you have a Snowden spotting! #GoTeamUSA
In my humble opinion, my opinions are the best.
Ernest Hemingway's terse sentences would've made him great for Twitter. He also had advanced mastery of shirtless pics.
Did you hear Hemingway had a secretary named Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald had a secretary named Hemingway? Because that is not true.
ces.
Tonight we'll discuss Ernest Hemingway, an author who, like me, has the unique ability to fit complex thoughts into short and simple senten
Don't miss cOlbert's Book Club tonight! And if you do miss it, at least read the episode's Sparknotes.
Tomorrow night is my 3rd cOlbert Book Club! Soon, I'll have read 3 books!
Be sure to read "A Farewell To Arms" for the cOlbert Book Club tomorrow. Or at least watch the movie version, "127 Hours."
Tuesday's book club selection is "A Farewell to Arms." I haven't started it yet, but I assume it's like a conservative "Goodnight Moon."
Can‚Äôt believe I wasn‚Äôt nominated for #BestActor for my role in ‚ÄúThe Colbert Report‚Äù. Did I really gain all that weight for nothing?
So @BillieJeanKing and I clearly have a lot of chemistry. Does that mean I'm a lesbian?
Nobody's talking about the real MLB drug scandal: That the Philly Phanatic is really the Philly Meth Addict.
Hey #Yankees, now that @Arod's out I'd officially like to throw my hat in the ring as‚Äì OW! Scratch that, I tore my rotator cuff.

If you don't win Logo Party, you need to watch more TV. If you do win Logo Party, you need to watch more TV.
Logo Party is my favorite game. If only I could remember which company made it.

Happy New Year, Nation! Exciting news - this year's the "Year of the Stephen Colbert"! Very lucky for all the Stephen Colberts out there.
