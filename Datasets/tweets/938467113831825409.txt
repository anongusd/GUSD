If you call yourself progressive or libertarian and still support the death penalty, don‚Äôt.
@wolfeprowler1 @4aPeoplesParty Thanks! Anything to end the political duopoly!
@DawgMother @truthglow I work for a dispensary &amp; we just started doing adult-use sales this month. Hopefully other areas are also seeing more stores &amp; delivery services open up!
Less than 10% of gun deaths in the US are caused by rifles. An assault weapons ban will lessen the damage a single shooter will do, but comprehensive background checks for all firearms, especially handguns, is the most important step.
RT @q_aurelius: @KillerMartinis In my experience, most racist people aren't "hateful" in any kind of active way. They're passively racist.‚Ä¶

The new spending bill changes existing law to allow the president &amp; CIA to conduct covert operations with little-to-no congressional oversight. 		This is another big step in the creeping expansion of presidential power &amp; US empire.		https://t.co/0MuE8ZVe0B @AlexEmmons @ryangrim
@RoKhanna If we let congressional republicans get away with using DACA &amp; CHIP as bargaining tools, they‚Äôll continue to hold kids hostage every time they want something passed. 		We can‚Äôt allow this strategy to become a normal part of legislative negotiations! #CleanDreamAct #CHIP
Congressional republicans want to use CHIP and DACA as bargaining tools to force their other priorities through.		If we let them get away with holding kids hostage this time, they‚Äôll do it again and again to pass the most odious bills imaginable.		#CleanDreamAct #CHIP
@citynightcap @Kris_Sacrebleu @KillerMartinis @C_Stroop @sarahkendzior @SkeddyRuxypin Thanks, I appreciate the shout out!
@empatheticjong Thanks!

@Fem_Atheist I definitely agree with both those points!
@Fem_Atheist Many large print outlets still have good investigative reporting‚Äîin fact this is a main source for independent media outlets to find the stories they cover. But the big TV news companies are mostly an awful mix of mindless drivel and policy-devoid partisan tribalist cheerleading.
America cannot flourish as a 21st century economy unless we open our doors to scientists and innovators, especially those from poorer nations.		Every day the #TravelBan stays in effect we lose talent to other modern &amp; emerging economies like the UK, Russia, China, India, etc. https://t.co/dpQvTQXuFx
@PoliticallyLib No problem, thanks for following back!
@ChiCityPam You too Pam! üôÇ
Adult #cannabis sales are now legal in California. This will result in $2+ billion in state revenue annually from taxes &amp; licensing fees, most of which is earmarked for education &amp; research.		It‚Äôs time to #LegalizeCannabis nationwide!
@RoKhanna Many other countries like France do this and it works great! Just like Ro says, it would strengthen the Post Office while providing services to millions of low-income Americans who currently are forced to pay crazy prices for basic things like cashing their hard-earned paychecks.
@justicedems It‚Äôs time to make the corporate &amp; estate taxes progressive, just like the income tax is.
Just a friendly reminder that the United States is currently engaged in 8 ‚Äúinterventions‚Äù abroad (that we know of) while we‚Äôre the only modern country where medical bankruptcy exists, we have hundreds of thousands of homeless people, and our infrastructure gets a grade of D+
@Cannasense2168 Thanks, you too!
The US is supporting #SaudiArabia in their slaughter of innocents. Call your representatives today and demand the US immediately cease all aid to Saudi Arabia and sanction the #SaudiRoyals until this manmade tragedy ends. https://t.co/LxGGSHXX9K
Tying minimum wage to inflation is a great idea, but really we should tie it to congressional pay. #2birds1stone
