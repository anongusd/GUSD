Instead of working towards a compromise to open the government and secure our border, the Speaker is canceling session and barring @POTUS from delivering the State of the Union address at the Capitol. This is nothing short of political theater. Our constituents deserve better!

It’s past time for Democrats to come to the table with a plan
I support @POTUS call for border security. The President is only asking for support of policies that Democrats have supported and voted for just a few short years ago. We must do whatever it takes to prioritize national security and secure our borders.
I look forward to working with the new Speaker to ensure the 116th Congress focuses on important issues – Veterans’ care, stronger border security, rising healthcare costs, continuing our momentum on the Soo Locks, and ensuring broadband access for rural Michiganders.
I’m honored the constituents of the First District have entrusted me to serve as their Representative in the 116th Congress. It’s imperative that Congress continues the momentum of the past two years, and we work to pass constituent-centric policies.

This audit by DOD is a critical step in changing the federal government’s culture of spending and ensuring the Pentagon’s resources are allocated to warfighters in the most efficient and effective way possible.
Our men and women in uniform work each and every day to safeguard the freedoms we hold dear. It’s our responsibility to ensure they’ve got the training, resources, and support necessary to carry out their mission.
As a fiscal conservative, I’ve said many times that the United States government must be held accountable for every penny of taxpayer money received and spent – especially when committing resources to the defense of our nation.
This top to bottom audit is the largest ever conducted and continues the process of applying accountability at all levels of government.
Having served alongside General Mattis, I know he is the right man, at the right time, to lead the Department of Defense. Marines are trained to lead by example—and under General Mattis’ leadership, DOD can lead the way in responsible federal spending.

I'm a Federalist. We must return power to the states. That is where government works best.
The Soo Locks is not only a economic issue, it is a national security issue. We must build the Lock.
This Congress has already rolled back $3.7 billion of unnecessary regulations. I'm proud of that.
One of the biggest tasks the federal government has ahead of it is to quit wasting taxpayer money. This has to stop!
We need tax reform. It needs to be simple, fair and small business friendly.
One of the next best steps to address our healthcare issues and costs, we must focus on primary and preventative care.

Bottom line: U.S. acted decisively and appropriately in the face of the Assad regime's cowardice. Bottom line: this nation leads.
Forces took extraordinary measures to avoid casualties to civilians and casualties to airfield personnel.
Russia was notified before the strikes, and precautions were taken to protect U.S. forces against any retaliatory attacks.
The strike was intended to keep the Assad regime from EVER using chemical weapons again.
Strike last night was proportional, given Assad's heinous acts against innocent civilians early this week.
