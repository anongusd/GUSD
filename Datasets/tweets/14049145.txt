Neither does it frighten me.		After the rain, I went back into the field of sunflowers.	It was cool, and I was anything but drowsy.	I walked slowly, and listened		to the crazy roots, in the drenched earth, laughing and growing.		‚Äîsometimes, Mary Oliver
Let the cathead appear again-	the smallest of your mysteries,	some wild cousin of my own blood probably-	some cousin of my own wild blood probably,	in the black dinner-bowl of the pond.		7.	Death waits for me, I know it, around	one corner or another.	This doesn‚Äôt amuse me.
6.	God, rest in my heart	and fortify me,	take away my hunger for answers,	let the hours play upon my body		like the hands of my beloved.
5.	Two or three times in my life I discovered love.	Each time it seemed to solve everything.	Each time it solved a great many things	but not everything.	Yet left me as grateful as if it had indeed, and	thoroughly, solved everything.
4.		Instructions for living a life:	Pay attention.	Be astonished.	Tell about it.
3.		Water from the heavens! Electricity from the source!	Both of them mad to create something!		The lighting brighter than any flower.	The thunder without a drowsy bone in its body.
But I believe they have between them	some fervent and necessary arrangement.		2.		Sometime	melancholy leaves me breathless‚Ä¶
1.		Something came up	out of the dark.	It wasn‚Äôt anything I had ever seen before.	It wasn‚Äôt an animal	or a flower,	unless it was both.		Something came up out of the water,	a head the size of a cat	but muddy and without ears.	I don‚Äôt know what God is.	I don‚Äôt know what death is.
Sad to see the passing of one of my favorite poets, Mary Oliver. So I give you in the next tweets one of her poems that often speaks to me, sometimes:

RIP John McCain. This is the end of an era in the Senate. McCain reached across the aisle to form amigos, gangs and legislation. He was always willing to talk &amp; listen to colleagues, to journalists, to people. 1/2

I‚Äôm not even a fellow! Never have been. And I‚Äôm not discrediting your work simply wondering at your moral authority here to judge when they is an area where more coverage is needed, not less. https://t.co/yP9ESY9vB7
The GSA is one voice on a panel of selectees led by...a journalist in aging! I‚Äôve been to 2 GSA conferences on my own dime.

That‚Äôs wonderful. I did my Columbia j-School masters on witches in the military. It didn‚Äôt make me an expert on either witches or the military. One long story doth not an expert make. https://t.co/1DsObtK5Fs
And, again. No requirement write about a particular topic. The grant allows you to write shot literally anything in aging. So... where‚Äôs the paid-for biased journalism? https://t.co/8JwtvtzChu
The GSA is an academic non partisan non profit gathering of geriatricians and gerontologists. Hardly Exxon funding global warming research. https://t.co/3xwruzygZM
(6)Who made you the news God-to judge what is important?To discount entire academic fields of gerontology and geriatrics as not worthy because they‚Äôre less prominent or click baity?In 2020 when care,or lack thereof,is an electoral issue we‚Äôll wish we‚Äôd invested more in such edu https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN
(5) If Trump has taught us anything it‚Äôs clicks win over substance. And yet you advocate shutting down some of the only coverage of an academic convention on aging? It‚Äôs not marketing when you can write anything you want on any subject in the field-it‚Äôs an attempt at education https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN
(4) Financial news used to be unimportant before people got bankrupted by the stock market and back runs. Women were unimportant until #metoo- I should know I wrote the book on it. And you should know better than anyone the poor state of media coverage https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN
(3) US is short 1.5m caregivers and will be short 4m by 2030, the year the last of the boomers turn 70. Medicare&amp; Medicaid are going bankrupt and care will bankrupt millions of middle class families. But, sure, pay no attention to aging. https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN
(2) In a day of shrinking newsrooms when the only thing anyone covers is trump, you deny resources to journalists to cover aging? Because, yeah, there‚Äôs nothing important going on there. https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN
It‚Äôs not preselected by the GSA but an outside group. And the knight etc started as ‚Äúglorified marketing campaigns‚Äù (1) https://t.co/tiurCH7HkN

Some people are clearly anti-trump. But are you saying that the anti-trump movement is only female? Women's rights is a much older tradition https://t.co/uhNfgFCfL3
Indeed. https://t.co/YDF6Spj0Xd
To clarify for my male colleagues: women's rights r universal&amp;nonpartisan. Tea Partism is a relatively small largely GOP movement. #notequal
