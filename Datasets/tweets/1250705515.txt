@getcoachlee Think about it... When was the last suicide where the person actually told somebody they were suicidal... Excluding folks who do it literally as their talking about doing it. I remember as a kid, well teenager I used to tell my mom all the time I would kill myself.. For attention
@getcoachlee Yea. But the world we live in is not as simple as that. Nobody even knew that people like Williams and bourdain etc were suicidal... They never talked about it. What I find when seeing people on soc media claiming to be suicidal is that it is just for attention.
@getcoachlee You will never change other peoples attitudes toward you. So you strengthen your own resolve and learn to cope with nay sayers.
@getcoachlee You will not change society to be able to bend at will. You either fit in or you sink in... Don't make excuses for him. Suicide is cowardice. You make excuses for him and what about the young folks? They gonna think suicide is ok, long as someone feels sorry for you.
@getcoachlee Shad is a public figure right? He should be able to handle it. If he ain't offed himself in all these years of being in public life then he won't. He is strong enough to handle it.

Why, when it comes to holding the line and standing your ground on things that mean something, is it that Republicans ALWAYS fold?! 		And they wonder why we lose elections. Last major election we won. WhY was that? Because @realDonaldTrump held the line, stood his ground.

@Chelle880 He didn't shut the government down. Congress did. It'd do you well to understand how your government works. Because if you did, you'd know that spending originates in the house then passed to the senate where they agree and send it to the president to sign. Nothing has reached

@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX While he basks in his own damn glory trying to make himself look good. Calling everything racist if they disagree with you politically while ignoring real racism like the Clinton's etc.
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX You need help. You the black person that wants to keep niggas under oppression while fighting against those that want to see us do better. You the exact type of nigga that Malcolm x warned us about. The traitorous nigga. The nigga that don't want the rest of us to have shit
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX They were ALL denied. NOTHING RACIST ABOUT THAT.
@politicalseason @LatanneRene Smh. You people are the worst. His leasing practices? Really? The FACT that he didn't lease/rent to people on welfare is racist??? No matter who came through jews, single white women, Puerto ricans (cuz as you know those were the people listed as being discriminated against)
@jonny_boye @HuffPost @MSignorile I'm sorry.  But, did you watch that video? Not 1 time did he say Mexico would 'write a check' to us for that wall...

@MrWonderfulPop @HuffPost @MSignorile Only time will tell. üòâ

I don't know what possessed me to sit up here and start watching 'pet sematary'üôàüôà		This movie used to give me nightmares as a kid... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It is now 'stoking fear' to tell the truth of what's going on at the southern border. Or to even point out that people are dying from illegal aliens... 		Since when did telling the truth become 'stoking fears'?
Its divisive to want to secure the borders of your own nation now?... Since when did this happen? This is literally retardation at the highest levels of democrat politicians.		Why is it divisive?
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX Why? Because it fit the narrative of trump being racist.
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX To be a judge. He did not rent his nicer buildings to people on welfare. Nothing wrong with that. He did however have them directed to other properties that belonged to him. And by explaining all this to you I'm sure you didn't know much about this case. You just went with it.
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX Hadnt discriminated based on race but based on if you were on government assistance. He was also able to bring 3 black witnesses in his favor to prove that he did in fact rent to blacks as 3 of his tenants at that particular building were in fact black. One of which happened 2/2
@politicalseason @LatanneRene @GregAbbott_TX Nothing fake about me but the hair that be in my head sometimes. But, on to this other issue you laid at my feet... He was sued by the justice department for discrimination of course. But when the case was laid out and the testimonies began etc it became clear that no, he (1/2)
@PeterSweden7 The fact that it hasn't taken the democrats to places where its been fulfilled. That saddens me lol they like to talk about it... But don't really wanna live it

@Cshanahan150 @mitchellvii We bring up Clinton for context on a 2 tiered justice system. That's why Clinton always comes up. The Clinton's ties to Russia are much more clear and far reaching than Trump could ever get close to and the fact that people like you refuse to look at that.
Equally, no American citizen should be forced to live in sorrow from having their loved ones snatched from them at the hands of illegal aliens etc - because democrats refuse to secure our borders in a meaningful way. https://t.co/gpi1ZFdX7l

@Cshanahan150 @mitchellvii Either way he did what he did. That would have had nothing to do with Trump. But if this is collusion than imagine what we'd call what Ted Kennedy did today. Now that's not to excuse the goings on of today. We don't know why he did what he did. But what did it matter?

@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris How many mothers you see in these caravans? Cuz I'm seeing mainly men. .
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris Funny you say that. That's not what they were seeking.

Had they known about it before they wouldn't have tried to get in the way they were.
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris And when he does try you guys block him...
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris You understand that don't you?
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris In sorry I don't see thousands in these numbers. Second, these issues are being handled by local governments. What's going on at the border is a national security issue. What happened inside the borders such as mass shootings is internal. The president can't do much about it.
@politicalseason @GregAbbott_TX Whether you'd like to admit it or not. The truth doesn't bend at your beckoning. This has nothing to do with him wanting to hold and keep political office. This is about our security. Get ya head out ya ass and understand that this does affect us.
@politicalseason @GregAbbott_TX Minorities are more affected by illegal immigration than any other sect of society. You'd know this if you were on the ground. Where do they go when they get here? Minority communities. Using our resources our public education etc. So yes it does affect us the most.
Fear of black and brown people? üòÇüòÇüòÇ so you're telling me when illegal aliens are planted in our cities that they are planted on the 'white' or wealthy sides of town? Uptown? Etc? When they are entered into public ed what side of town is it on? You forgot where u come from? https://t.co/nTwOnjxNiY

@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris Lies. Trump ain't never called immigrants rapists. He said that rapists etc were coming across the border ILLEGALLY lets not for get that one word you seem so apt to leave out every time you speak on this. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE RAPISTS. HOW MANY CASES ARE WE SEEING IN THESE...
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris What thousands are killed by angry white men and boys? Wanna talk about thousands being killed? Talk about the thousands of black folks being killed by each other every year... Most of the time where gun control is in place which is what I assume you were leading to.
@politicalseason Bigotry signalling? Where? Dude. My governor which is @GregAbbott_TX does support the border wall. Tf are you talking about? The GOP did give money to the border wall... Not enough apparently but they did. Yes they could have and should have given more. But leadership refused.
Y'all notice all those federal workers that were standing behind Chancy were minority workers... And if we are to believe the media no minorities like trump anyway. So... There's that. Lol
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris If illegal immigrants are desperate for help they should petition their governments. Petittion the neighboring states government don't try and force yourself on someone else
@cherishthewild @KamalaHarris I don't 'need a manufactured crisis to feel alive' this is not manufactured. It actually is a crisis. Just ask the families of those who are murdered of those whose neighborhoods drugs from across the border is devastating. These aren't manufactured these are real to them.

@robbfritz @uurrrraaaa @AndrewCMcCarthy @thehill Why? Cuz taking the meeting wasn't illegal. So what's the freaking issue here?
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy I don't lick boots boo. And nobody said he said that. Im telling you that the house passed the bill and the senate didn't take it up because they didn't have enough votes.
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy The house did in fact pass a 5+ billion dollar bill for the wall...
RT @JoshBlackStPete: What's the word for current levels? https://t.co/v7gpBPaUS6
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy He took responsibility... When it was his fault. But when the republicans in the house decided to pass a 5+ billion dollar spending bill after Nancy said he couldn't pull it off and the senate wouldn't take it up because of democrats then it became the democrats fault.
@robbfritz Journalists give straight news... Not opinions. Shep is an opinion guy.
Dear... It was a LEGITIMATE joke poking fun at our media who didn't seem to want to cover it the way that it happened. YOU FOLKS ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING IN THE HEAD LOL https://t.co/E6yBf1TAk9
@Divisionisweak They weren't hacked. Which is why the wouldn't allow the FBI to investigate their servers...
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy Yes, I do. By Comey to show him just why he needed to get his briefings everyday so that he would know what was out there. Not as Intel info. Was a kind of 'see this stupid shit? People making up stuff everyday, this why you need to see us everyday' briefing.
Then there's this... They always turn to the uber republican hating leftists at fox to try and get us to give credibility to their baseless ass arguments... Ugh. https://t.co/onC6VNAuQD

@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy Of course many indictments and guilty pleas that had nothing at all to do with Russia getting trump into office... Know the difference.
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy Strengthening our military is also good for Russia i guess huh? Wanting to end a nuclear deal with Russia where we lose and they gain is also helping Russia Huh? Restoring missile defense systems in Baltic states good 4 Russia? How about supplying arms to Ukraine good for russia?
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy He doesn't have to talk tough to putin know why? actions speak louder than words. Him chastising Angela Merkel in public for spending billions with Russia for natural gas when they have allies that could give it to them and urging her to nix the deal is good for russia i guess?
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy What businessman with a global business empire doesn't want/have ties with Russia? Huh? If they don't that's quite a bit of money to miss out on. The trump tower meeting means nothing. That wasnt even illegal in any stretch of the imagination.
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy Especially where it ain't due. Us Intel agencies also told us Iraq had weapons of mass destruction didn't they... Us along with other world Intel agencies yet y'all blamed them for the war in Iraq claiming they lied. Pick and choose what you wanna believe huh?
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy He didn't need Russia to win a damn election. I helped him win that election. Me and millions of other people that made up the least populated states helped him win that election. People who wanted America to be great again. Not Russia. Y'all give Russia too much damn credit.
@Divisionisweak @AndrewCMcCarthy What do you call paying a lawfirm, to pay a British ex spy, to pay Russians for false made up information to influence an election? Had trump did that it would have been a slam dunk case for Mueller right??? So why is it not for Hillary?
@dadadadiox @AndrewCMcCarthy No no. What scares republicans is the HISTORY of Mueller and those that works for him. How they've secured convictions before only to have been wrong and overturned 9-0 by the supreme court, charges tossed and dropped even to the government having to pay people millions cuz of it
@robbfritz @Theyarecrooked @AndrewCMcCarthy Yep. Takes a lot of illegals, lots of ballot harvesting, lots of poll closings delayed, lots of people voting more than once, I mean. Yea.. Y'all sure got the voter fraud part locked down don't ya?

Likewise if you were a patriot which by every stretch of the imagination you are not, you'd be calling for the investigation into the Clinton campaign and their ties to russia

Had I known that he paid a hoe off b4 the election I'd have still voted 4 him. Most of us voted 4 him not cuz he was morally sound. Or cuz he sounded like our pastors but precisely the opposite. He told America what we NEEDED to hear. Not what we WANTED to hear as politicians do.

Of course they introduce a bill to eliminate the electoral college... 		The will of the many out weighs the rights of the few. 		Yes, we have enough takers in the nation to outnumber the makers. 		Middle of America be damned. Look to New York and California for your hope now.
@WhyAsk65 @RepCummings We will get that wall. And you ought be ashamed of yourself for not supporting it. Shame.
@SharylAttkisson So what does this mean? They got the goods???
@jamesfox718 @WhyAsk65 @RepCummings There is urgency. Else government wouldn't be shut down. But even still why don't you support having a barrier at the border? You want women and children dying trying to get here illegally just to be sent back home??? How empathetic of you...
@ChrisSalcedoTX @JohnBrennan @Comey Uh oh. 	#LockThemUp
@toddstarnes Me next!!! Lol
@WBAP247NEWS They don't want border security. Simple as that.
@WhyAsk65 @RepCummings And they will. I've explained many times just how they will.
@WhyAsk65 @RepCummings For the border patrol to take hours to get there only to be out run and potentially out gunned by the illegal alien??? What else would 'work' in your view? Plus drones are expensive and need maintenance all the time.
@WhyAsk65 @RepCummings There are are not much better ways to secure the border. And you should just admit that. You don't want a secure border. Because drones won't do it. What you expecting? Them to shoot leaflets down warning them not to come over? Relaying what they find to the border patrol?
@jamesfox718 @WhyAsk65 @RepCummings And Mexico will pay for the wall. Eventually through certain taxes on the millions that goes over there every year and reworked trade deals as well as the money we give them in aide every year. U understand that right?
@jamesfox718 @WhyAsk65 @RepCummings It could be higher. Even still it would slow down the illegal alien and that would then give the border patrol time enough to get there. It would also deter parents from wanting to send their children on such a heinous journey only to realize there's a barrier there.
@WayneDupreeShow Heyyyy wayne!!!
@realBenjiIrby @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump Check out my last tweet
@ClarkMstracey @RepCummings You do understand that the wall goes deep down into the ground right? And the tunnels we have found have been destroyed. But because there are tunnels is it your position that we still don't need a wall?
@WSJ Why don't y'all ever put in there why? Like Trump won't accept it because it has no teeth to border security. Strong security like @ border barrier? Huh?
@WhyAsk65 @RepCummings Was a barrier ridiculous when the democrats voted for it back in 2006??? And, if we fund this border barrier we won't have to worry about border agents being stretched tight, having to hastily move from section to section to arrest border jumpers. The wall will stop all that.

Hey @hank
@RepCummings Why won't you vote to build a border barrier to prevent illegals from getti g here and dodging border patrol???
The breaking news should be: dems passed legislation that prevents meaningful security at the border. https://t.co/Cipdv4UIu5

@thehill They knew it was coming. And he better follow through.
@politicalseason Mexican Citizens wiring money back home, millions in trade imbalances.   Etc. Now argue those points. Argue what would stop him from redirecting those funds back into the treasury for the wall...
@politicalseason They will. And we clearly aren't going to come to an agreement on that. Why? Cuz you're such an ass that you wanna parse words. Instead of realizing the simple facts that we give billions of dollars in aide every year to mexico, billions of dollars flow across the border via
@CNNPolitics She is gone get herself into so much shit. Instead of doing the business of giving representation to new York she wants to go federal? Girl sit yo ass down somewhere.
@thehill Now y'all had all of 2 years of a unified government to try and get that done lol. Y'all couldn't get it done under a democrat administration what makes y'all think y'all can get it done now?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

@SharylAttkisson Wow. The media really is scum. Smmfh.
@politicalseason Why is that such a hard thing to understand?
@politicalseason No. I don't agree that Mexico will never pay for it. Mexico will never write a check but from certain taxes, rerouting of aide, monetary assistance trade deals and negotiations the money we will have coming from Mexico will more than double what is needed to pay for the damn wall
@TheWendyMcKay @SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorSinema I will submit that it was a close race. But, when you take in overall numbers of the Arizona voting population and look at the disparities from her vote count with the governors maybe you can understand where I'm coming from...
folks like him just don't want to understand. As if logic escapes them never to be seen again üòÇ. Who educates these folks?

@TheWendyMcKay @SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorSinema State
@TheWendyMcKay @SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorSinema 55k votes is a lot.... That's not a small number. I've seen elections decided on far fewer. I detest that Synema won. She's a socialist. Equally McSally made it clear where she was headed. She tried to distance herself from Trump thus alienating a lot of people in her stage
Y'all know what this means? Means democrats can't get mad at Pelosi and try to force her out before the next election lol but more serious is that they wish to balloon the debt. https://t.co/jiOY9cKeeR
if he knew much about which he spoke, he'd understand that any appropriations to anything has to come from the purse... That is the house first. So, of course WE were going to pay for the wall. BUT, through trade deals, etc, the money would have been refunded through Mexico. https://t.co/51g6O89Zmy
@politicalseason What is 'not' a good idea???
@politicalseason You understand that don't you?

@politicalseason For all your 'brilliant' posts... Are you not very bright? Do you not understand how things work? Who in their right minds even him thought that we would just walk to the Mexican embassy and they'd offer the money for the wall? Nobody except the likes of you....
@SenMcSallyAZ @SenatorSinema McSally I hope you give the people of Arizona a reason to keep you after this term... It was clear that they didn't want you. But you were forced upon them anyway. So do what needs to be done to help make America great again.
@SaraCarterDC @LisaMarieBoothe Its not border security they want. Its illegal immigration prolonged that they want. And really we can't fault them. We knew this all along. We need to fault republicans and refused to do what was necessary to fix this issue.

@politicalseason Lies. He can do as he said he would do and veto whatever they send him that doesn't have what he asked for And we will understand perfectly what has happened. Doesn't matter that a few republicans decide to go spineless and give in. As long as he stands by what he said its ok.
Us losing the house had nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump and EVERYTHING to do with congressional Republican leadership. Such cowards they were.

@Arightside Losing my mama was the hardest year of my life. And though they say it gets easier with time, it doesn't.
@thehill " There is no evidence that Mr. Trump or Trump Organization executives knew of their immigration status. But at least two supervisors at the club were aware of it, the women said, and took steps to help workers evade detection and keep their jobs."
@Poeticsportsfan @ACTBrigitte She wasn't American though. And it was her own personal decision to make that she made. She didn't say that everyone should not speak their native tongue in their own home. She did make the argument tho that its best to assimilate which does mean something.
@TeddyJGrahams @RealDLHughley Lies. If they truly seek asylum they do it at a consulate or embassy. Or they accept Mexico's offer, given to them repeatedly. And yes, the democrats have an open border policy. What is it called when you don't support a physical border barrier and other things?...

@CADudeFrank @thehill The American taxpayer was going to pay for the wall regardless, and Mexico was and still is going to reimburse for it. No money can be spent without going through congress first unless the executive shuffles it around in different departments, you understand that?
@UN @bensollee I get you be still uses a gas powered car. And uses electricity. And eats red meat.... Etc etc...
@CADudeFrank @thehill You knew what he meant. You knew damn well we weren't just going to walk to the Mexican embassy and say hey, we need 25 billion to build a wall. Congress would have to approve of it anyway if they were to give it to us. However through trade deals, taxes etc they would reimburse
@CADudeFrank @thehill The 1.6 billion was for border security. And had NOTHING in it about a barrier, fencing, walls or nothing. Words matter.

So... Only white men have guns? This woman is so racist it stinks. Smh. https://t.co/RwzVIwbwTk
@JoshBlackStPete ... A barrier. A wall. Border agents can't be in multiple places at once. A wall will slow down and even stop anybody from wanting to get in illegally. And for those who still try and get in it gives the agents time to catch them. Do you disagree with this simple point?
@JoshBlackStPete Has there never been? Then what was the need when democratic senators like Hillary, and Obama voted for it??? A physical barrier is a wall. They voted for a physical barrier whether it was fencing or what. We wouldn't need to be putting border agents lives on the line if we had..

@CrisTheFist @SenSanders Nobody said he isn't accountable to law. Everyone is. I'm saying that he CANT OBSTRUCT justice The way you make it seem he did. No matter how many 'scholars' try and tell you he did. Just because you stare at the sky yelling marshmallows doesn't make the clouds marshmallows...
@CrisTheFist @SenSanders I'm not the one throwing around the accusations. You said he obstructed justice and if your example was that he used his office to end an investigation that's not obstruction. That's not even to mention that the investigation is still going but he can if he wants to. Next?...
@CrisTheFist @SenSanders No paying taxes? You realize its a federal crime to not pay your taxes? You realize Trump has been under audit with the IRS FOR YEARS and they ain't found nothing yet?
@CrisTheFist @SenSanders No. Don't send me coverage send me your version of the events in which he broke campaign finance laws using his own money... They didn't investigate Hillary. They made it look as if they did.
@CrisTheFist @SenSanders And a bit of a news flash... The president can't obstruct justice. He can hire and fire whomever he wants in the executive branch. He can ask investigations he brought and ask that they be ended. It is his legal authority.
@CrisTheFist @SenSanders Say I don't know... Please, explain it to me so that I may know... And your definition of obstruction is not a real definition it is your own. Not a legal one. Give me the real definition of obstruction and the context in which it affects Trump. Shouldn't be hard. U seem to know.

@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 What the hell does the NRA have to do with waiting lists for people purchasing guns? Do you even know what you're talking about? Because it's beginning to sound like you just rambling. Ppl were murdered in a church because of a crazy racist man who knew where to find easy targets

@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Churches and schools are being shot up because crazy people choose to target places with limited to no security. Notice how we don't hear about police department shootings? Court house shootings? Capital hill shootings? Gun range shootings? Yea me neither.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Have you ever asked yourself how or why college tuition is so much? Why do the costs go up every year? Despite the number of freshmen every year decreasing?
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Lies. The government has been taking in record amounts of money since the passage of the tax cuts why? Because more jobs were created, more money being pumped into the economy and with more jobs came more tax payers. The problem is the spending like on student loans
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Not a millionaire but understand that you can not tax a nation into prosperity. And you'd do well to understand that.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Kids are dying because their unfit parents are forcing them to truck it thousands of miles without food and water. With folks who are already sick and carrying diseases. With criminals, rapists, drug pushers you name it

@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 And again these people are not seeking asylum.. Hell they didn't even know what asylum was until they were told about it by American lawyers. Mexico offered them their asylum for the 5th time. They did not take it. So why do we need to be burdened with them?
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 ...just come one come all. Regardless of how it may affect the make up of our own situations the devastating affects it could have on our own struggling population. Just so you could feel good about yourself. Shameful
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 You are fighting for open borders. And anything you say to the contrary is utterly false. You want for everyone to say that they are going through hardships to just be able to get in. That could be a billion people. No, it doesn't matter who they are, what their background..
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 we already have gun control. we have murder control too. Yet people still murder. There's enough laws on the books already. Problem is criminals and crazy folks just don't follow laws. What you want is to strip law abiding citizens of what's left of their constitutional rights.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 And of course the deficit is going to escalate when you cut taxes and don't cut spending. Before we even cut the taxes trump would send budgets to congress with billions in cuts and guess who blocked em all? Democrats and spineless republicans.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 And who said anything about tapping into SS to fund tax cuts? I ain't heard nobody talking about that. Knowing that SS is going bankrupt it would be stupid of us to even consider that. Now you're just making stuff up.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Eyeyeyey.... Yes, we would like to end pre existing illnesses who wouldn't? You should want to too. Why should I as a tax payer have to foot the cost of paying to forgive student loan debt if I ain't the one that accrued that debt??? Huh? Tell me in what world is that right?
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Not a millionaire by a long shot. Hell I'm not even a thousandaire! üòÇüòÇüòÇ but I am enjoying my 'crumbs' that high and mighty people like you think is nothing.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 And you can't say you care about the direction this country is going if you want endless illegal immigration simply because people want better lives and to escape their situations. If left to you and those like you America would just be another 3rd world country.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 You came to me chick. I ain't know you from a stone in a driveway. You engaged me. So.... Now you gotta deal with the consequences. If loving your country and wanting it to be on the right path is being a sell out that got damnit ill be just that.
@AgapovDominick @RT_com @TVsLeaking I understand that. I don't know of anyone who doesn't understand that. My issue is when they spend so much on social services and won't put more towards their own defenses,its a problem. Nobody minds helping but when we are used and abused it has to stop somewhere.
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 ...think they got a lock on blk folks now. Y'all the reason people think we all vote strictly based on our race. You would want nothing more than for black folks to be totally dependent on democrats and the government. You don't want us to think for ourselves and its a damn shame

Why are we not capable enough of thinking for ourselves and actually believe what we want? Tf man. Yall the fuckin reason dems...

@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Gop is destroying healthcare? Obama care did that coupled with government intervention. If anything Trump and conservative republicans are trying to make it better. It was Trump who made it easier for people knocking on deaths door to be able to try a potential cure...

@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 I don't know what these folks are going through. Nor do I pretend to know, as you seem to do. What I do know is that as I said 3x already, if they really seeked help and a better situation Mexico has offered it to them. They decided not to take that help. Why do you ignore that
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 Wanting a secure border is holding others back? Tell me when was the last time you spoke like this for somebody that was arrested for stealing to feed their kids or themselves? Tell me when the last time you stood up for our criminals that wanted to better themselves. Girl bye!
@MelanieSpell @justanotherhan2 You tried it. If these people wanted to forward and better themselves they'd accept Mexico's offer. Some of them were so 'desperate' that instead of taking Mexico's offer they went home. Why was that? Can we say they really didn't want to forward and better themselves?

@NickTrump80 @JohnCornyn Radical conservative? üòÇüòÇüòÇ now you're trippin'. A radical conservative is me. Trump aint nothing near it. Just like you're no republican. What republican would be against a man implementing the very agenda we have been fighting years 4, simply cuz they don't like him personally
@NickTrump80 @JohnCornyn Well you just hold your breath until that day comes. He is in no trouble. Lol you damn democrats have very strange imaginations.

Please, nobody, ever refer to me as 'coming off the plantation'... I was never on it. I've been voting Republican ever since I've been able to vote. Come to think about it, before I even began following politics, I used to lie in school and say Colin Powell was my uncle üòÇüòÇüòÇ

@c4rmenge @chiliflake1 @HuffPost I wouldn't take anything that man says serious. He hasn't been a judge in years and even then he was a state judge not a federal judge and the man is always wrong.
@c4rmenge @chiliflake1 @HuffPost The judge didn't 'find' nothing. The judge 'accepted' a plea. The case was not tried in court the arguments weren't made. Cohen pleaded to a crime that wasn't a crime.
@c4rmenge @chiliflake1 @HuffPost I'm just seeing that he is saying that is not what he said.
@c4rmenge @Bigger_Brother_ @HuffPost But that is not reality. No judge said Trump broke the law. And if so please tell me which law and what judge.
@DeborahDitkows1 @WSJ I didn't vote for a con man. I voted for the right man for the job. Why? Because since he has been in office I have benefited greatly from his policies. Not so much under black Jesus. And anybody was better than Hillary.
@TammetteH @CNN Likewise. If he wanted the investigation to go away he can order it at anytime and NOTHING can be done legally about it. WHY?  Cuz he is the head of the branch.
@TammetteH @CNN You can yell 'that's a fact' the rest of ya life. That won't make it so. He didn't tell anybody to write up the paperwork. Hell they did it because they thought he should go. If he wanted to fire somebody he can. He is the boss. You'd do well to understand that.
@TammetteH @CNN Smh you don't know how any of this works do you? Such a shame. Young skull full of mush. Your media has failed you. They are your enemy. There is no assistant AG. There's a deputy AG it was Sessions then Rosenstein.
@chiliflake1 @c4rmenge @HuffPost No a judge did not say he broke the law.
@Bigger_Brother_ @c4rmenge @HuffPost I think you're mistaking him for Obama and democrats as a whole.
@chiliflake1 @c4rmenge @HuffPost No, its not if we are thinking that he paid the hoes off to influence the campaign. If that were the case he should have reported it to FEC. He didn't because it wasn't. He used his own money. Not campaign funds. its sad that I have to explain this. Why? You aparntly didn't know.
@TammetteH @CNN You even know what you talkn bout??? Trump fired 1 person. Jim Comey. Same person democrats wanted fired. And that was at the urging of his dep AG. Know ya facts honey. Everybody else was fired, demoted, and shuffled by the department.
@campusreform Waste of money. Smh. I'm guessing its for the trans?
@CNN If him and his cohorts didn't all get fired and demoted there wouldn't be a need for somebody to have to stand up for it. Make no mistake about it this is YALLS oWN DOING!

@Cernovich The promises that have not been kept so far were not his fault. He tried. And is still trying. Just give the man a chance. Geesh.

@txsguy09 @HeathMayo Further, no one is anti legal immigrant we are anti illegal alien and yes there should be caps for some time on legal immigrants as well. Until we can figure ourselves out we shouldn't be hobbling in more. Clearly we have a assimilation problem.
@txsguy09 @HeathMayo These trade wars and tariffs are not for fun. And you'd do well to recognize that. They are to get China in line with the rest of the world.

Seven seconds - cop accidentally kills a black boy riding a bike, the police department covers it up...		Empire - cop accidentally tases a kid after he beats up his ppl...		Cloak and Dagger - cop accidentally shoots a blk guy after a explosion, police department covers it up...

Democrate, and their media ARE in FACT, the enemy of the people. No ifs - ands - or buts about it.
Dems keep talking about the price of the wall... They don't care about costs. They don't care about spending other folks money. The cost of that wall DWARFS the costs of illegal immigration, stemming from local, state and federal entities that have to deal with them.
When democrats talk about 'bold solutions' to tackle 'climate change', you need to know that: that is, taxing you out of everything you hold dear. Your homes, transportation, communications and even your eating habits. In short, stripping you of your livelihood. 		#Getwoke

Men... Apologizing and stepping down from jobs for being men. Shameful. Weak. Men. 	So what you made a comment that you wouldn't want your son to be gay. What MAN would? But, what makes you WEAK is apologizing for saying it! Now, explain that to your child when they get older.

No you are not lady. If that were so Obama wouldn't have needed to bail y'all broke asses out. Trump if anything saved y'all from even more destruction than what you're going thru right now. Dang. Just say thank you. CNN is fake AF... https://t.co/Hysw7o1Qms
@CNN Oh good. Y'all always seem to find that one person who will try and make him out to be the boogeyman. She needs to take her frustration out on Mary Barra not Trump.
I remember when leftists were telling us that 'thoughts and prayers' just weren't going to cut it... 		Well, they're sure sending out alot of thoughts and prayers to the Bush's aren't they?... Not a problem with it. But, it sure is nice to know that maybe they do believe in it üòá
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump These folks hate him so much. They are willing to go to any lengths. And its sad. And somebody needs to be held accountable.

@KevinLinton23 @CNN And Y'ALL is YOU and those who think like you!
@KevinLinton23 @CNN By limiting the fuel standards on cars and trucks, drastically raising fuel taxes, forcing automakers to make cars greener etc. And doing all this while countries are still trying to figure out how to get electricity to villages etc.
@KevinLinton23 @CNN So what about the other 3% i guess the minority doesn't count? Lol. Science is not up for a vote. You don't just get to say 90% of scientists agree that the world is flat whole 3% agree that it is not. And just take the 90% word... Science is not up for a vote. Sorry.

@KevinLinton23 @CNN Ain't that many dinosaurs in the world. The world will be fine. But in the meantime yall wish to destroy our ways of life while preventing the rest of the world from improving their standards of living.
@KevinLinton23 @CNN The climate changes all the time. Humans can't stop that. The earth gets hotter, the earth gets colder. The earth has a funny way of recycling itself. Ever wonder how we keep finding so called 'fossil fuels' when we were told it comes from dinosaur bones lol.
@KevinLinton23 @CNN The world has been spinning for millions of years. The dinosaurs died millions of years ago and they didn't have fossil fuels to live on. If the world gone take the humans out its gonna do it with or without our consent. The world will be hospitable hundreds of years from now.
@JeffJarrett23 @HuffPost How are we avoiding accountability? Lol aint nobody saying he didnt to it. My point in my comment was why does Joy not get whole articles written bout her when she says stuff more inflammatory than this...
@CNN Instead of giving it to their employees. Raising their wages etc. Give it to some wind farm that's just going to pocket lol
@HuffPost Behar has called folks worse... And she still on national t.v.
@Jerusalem_Post Maybe because the protesters were using violence against them? Not peacefully protesting by trying to bust through barricades... You media types are such warmongers lol.
Fancy seeing all the leftist media types fawning over George the 1st... But, while he was alive nobody hated him and his son more... Such fake people. Fake news media.

I just pray that if we ever do get a special counsel for Hillary that they are as rabid as Mueller and his team... Imagine the crimes and please we'd have coming from that! You think this is something? Just wait til we sic our version of Mueller on Hillary and her surrogates. üôä
I'm sure Russia, like the rest of the world believed that Hillary was going to win in 2016. So, this whole Russia colluding with Trump b.s. is just that. B.s., to hide the real crimes of pay to play that was going on with the Clintons and their surrogates...
@MQSullivan In short...No. They're liberal. They don't think in real life. They operate on fairytales. They tax their businesses out of existence and then blame it on the businesses when they have none. The only thing Austin has going for it, is that it is the seat of government of the state

Stop being so hateful of this adm
@TexasTribune @ProPublica It ain't quietly if you know about it...
...was this bailout from the government along with unfair subsidies. Get rid of the subsidies and get rid of GM for good.
Shame that GM waits to restructure now when the economy is doing good. And doing it with gov subsidies. Obama should have allowed them to fall when the economy was screwed already. The only thing that prevented them from going the way of other badly run companies...
@TexasTribune Remember folks long before us didnt have technology yet most of them appeared to be much smarter than us.
@TexasTribune Crime etc. Get your areas up to standard and you too could have good education. Second, your students have to want to be educated. Want to do good and then it doesn't matter what technology they have. They will obtain the knowledge.
@TexasTribune It has nothing to do with race. But everything to do with the funding of the schools right? Meaning that most of the time the poorer schools are in the minority neighborhoods. This is everywhere. Best way to fix this is to bring more money to your neighborhoods by getting rid of.
@RealDLHughley ...First time tear gas had been used on the border. Obama's DHS had used tear gas over 40√ó at the border. And the media said nothing. Do you see how you and your followers are being misled? Or do you not care???
@RealDLHughley At the border patrol while trying to break down border fences. In any other instance these people would have been handled much harsher. But because we wanted to show 'restraint' they opted to use tear gas instead. But you also I guess don't know that this isn't the...
@RealDLHughley Why are you doing this? Why lie? Why give no substance? No history? Why??? Yes women and children were in attendance when this happened. But you should also tell your followers why this has happened. It happened because MEN and women were throwing rocks, sticks, bricks etc...
@swagger_geeky @JeremyTmmy @KWCosby You have 33 people following you. Lol. Just because you have all the democrat, I'm still a slave talking points down doesn't make you intellectually on point. Lol. Just means you're good at being a follower. Thinking the white folk is putting you down and wants to keep u down.
@JeremyTmmy @KWCosby Smh. Every white person didn't benefit from slavery. Nobody who's wealth derived from slaves is still living off that money lol.
The Senate didnt 'wake up' the Senate has gone rogue. The democrats are doing this to spite Trump and Saudi-U.S. relations and the republicans are doing this in a give-a-dog-a-bone manner to show the left that they can be anti Trump. https://t.co/Hm7YCTDdIN
@swagger_geeky @JeremyTmmy @KWCosby Come child. You seem apoplectic. Calm down. I'm quite convinced you are one of the so educated but still so dumb crowd. But, its ok. You will become smart someday.
@JeremyTmmy @KWCosby This won't come about because aint nobody gonna give you shit that they worked for. And the thought that over a hundred years after slavery ended that you are entitled to something somebody else has and you should be given it is the height of stupidity. Nobody owes you anything
@KWCosby I didn't argue a point of institution building and wealth building was a bad thing. In fact I applaud it. I'd prefer it. But when you say you only want to help one group in doing that instead of the population as a whole there's my issue.
@JeremyTmmy @KWCosby Smh. You don't get no damn inheritances, no reparations. Its always the so called educated folks that bring this shit up. This. Will. Never. Happen. So stop saying it. You want something go out there and get it like every damn body else!

@Creepypornlawy1 @TheRealShecky @SheriffClarke Howwwww??? What specifically did he do?
@Creepypornlawy1 @TheRealShecky @SheriffClarke And because she knew she was in a senate race where shit could be misconstrued so she wanted to piss all the black folks in the state off right??? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
