You can complain that he has not been effectively supervised, but not that he does not have formally adequate supervision.
Rob Khuzami (along w/ Pat Fitzgerald) was my partner on Blind Sheikh case. As skillful a lawyer as I‚Äôve been privileged to work with. Always issues when donation violations treated as felonies. But you can be sure the SDNY team is SDNY caliber. Meaning POTUS is in real peril.

@brithume I should add: Concededly, this is not a slam-dunk. I had to put a paragraph (I hated) in the column admitting lack of consistency (see below). My point here is merely to dissent from claim that 'jurisdiction' is clear and just means subj to our laws. I don't think it's clear. https://t.co/nLx2z5lFqN
@RLHeinrichs Thanks Rebeccah. Great respect for your work, so very much appreciated.
@irishspy @NationalAffairs Thanks so much! Discussion on TheEditors podcast (tho I respectfully disagree) was very good, too. @ltthompso made strong argument that amendment would be needed. Reminded me that we got 14th Am precisely b/c of concern that 13th Am couldn't be fixed by legislation.
@brithume Brit, thanks so much. I am a committed textualist. My beef is with notion that 'jurisdiction' has a single, plain meaning. If that were so, Supreme Court would not have had to explain what the word meant in the 14th Am context just 16 yrs later (in Elk v. Wilkins, 1884): https://t.co/uIQoRWjslW

I had no problem with #Kavanaugh temperament when he was being attacked, but even if I had, he was not a judge in that context. He was a witness (and nearly in posture of an accused). If you want to evaluate judicial temperament, you have to look at his 12 years as a judge.

@brithume They were never going to accept the report. Ever. If FBI interviewed Ford, they'd say it's a perjury trap, a set-up in a White House-orchestrated farce. If FBI added more interviews, they'd call it "going thru motions." Nothing done will ever be enough or legit. That's the game.
Looking forward to discussing latest on #Kavanaugh with @LizMacDonaldFOX on @EveningEdit at 5pm.
Not FBI investigation; FBI just facilitating Senate investigation in constitutional exercise of advice &amp; consent authority. Not a criminal investigation; question is does Senate have enough info to assess nominee. It's time to vote ... my @NRO column https://t.co/5MfOMO6bvQ

In light of how compelling Dr Ford was, @LindseyGrahamSC made best point at halftime (not repeated in his riveting hearing speech): She's credible, earnest, and a judge would not issue a probable-cause warrant based on her testimony b/c it's not corroborated.
As Sen. Harris presumably knows, FBI would never going to try "to get to bottom of the allegations"; it would interview witnesses. Committee would decide whether to get to bottom in exercising its advice &amp; consent role. &amp; BK has no control over who FBI interviews.

Kavanaugh opening statement fiery, passionate, and moving.
My column for @FoxNewsOpinion - Kavanaugh, Ford hearing: In an awful process Democrats gain the advantage as Republicans walk on eggshells https://t.co/AMrssjqAi8 #FoxNews
Each Democrat has an excellent plan for a 5-minute round. Ms. Mitchell has no sense of time, and seems to think this is a deposition. Laughing with witness and commiserating with her at the end about how much the format sucks helps Dr. Ford's standing.
@BradMossEsq To cut to the chase, you just don't care about the etiology of PTSD. You probably didn't even know it was multifactorial! What could be more relevant than that?
This is an awful process. If you're going to have an evidentiary hearing, it's not fair to the witness or conducive to the goal of getting to the bottom of things to disjoint hearing with 5-minute rounds rather than let each side have time to develop lines of inquiry.
Another anonymous allegation amid a bungled process - my @NRO column: https://t.co/bZ0c4fSam7
Grassley is maddening. The witness is in the middle of clarifying a document, says she has 3 points, and he interrupts to switch questioners before letting her finish ... so now she will need to go back clarify the clarification ...
They don't corroborate allegation. They indicate that, 30 years after alleged incident, four people who are close to her, including husband, claim that she said something about it. Corroboration is kind of proof that is lost when witness waits 3 or 4 decades to speak. https://t.co/oI02xLnNKu

Where is GOP-Congress? The way to rebut JohnKerry on Iran is not to bleat about abusive SallyYates and silly LoganAct. It is hearings &amp; reports on relationship b/w Iran &amp; al Qaeda, the binLaden documents, &amp; Iran's role in antiAmerican terrorism - which Kerry well knows.

@kausmickey I‚Äôm not arguing in favor of the process. Just saying what it is. I don‚Äôt like the process; e.g.: going to 4 diff judges when it should be assigned to 1, invites problems. But that said, we don‚Äôt know that they didn‚Äôt - or did - ask those questions ... or any questions.

@BradMossEsq It‚Äôs too complicated a debate to have on Twitter, but comes down to which imperfect process would be prone to least likelihood of abuse. I think exec pushes envelope more knowing can say ‚Äòbut judge approved it.‚Äô But you‚Äôre right that we have FISA for a reason.
@IMHO1969 I have given judges what turned out to be inaccurate information, and have had to confess error. Not proud moments but culture of SDNY was our standing with court required fessing up when we got something wrong. It happens.
Should add, fwiw, I do not like FISA, &amp; have always thought judges should not be involved in foreign intel collection. Exec w/ cong‚Äôl oversight would be more accountable, and it‚Äôs not a judicial process so harms judiciary to be seen as rubber stamp. https://t.co/qJzXXRPIQg
The argument should be that DOJ &amp; FISA judges have higher duty to follow rules and scrutinize applications because, unlike criminal proceeding where there‚Äôs eventual discovery and hearings, that‚Äôs all the due process warrant target will ever get.
In nearly 20 yrs as a prosecutor, and hundreds of warrants, I never had a hearing to get a warrant. I had judges tell me ‚Äòno,‚Äô or tell me I needed to beef up this or that allegation with more solid evidence. But never a hearing.
Folks, there generally are no hearings on warrants, and you don‚Äôt want there to be because the four corners of the warrant application must state the probable cause. If they don‚Äôt, the judge should reject the application, not hold a hearing.

Put aside hardcore AlwaysTrumpers. I don't think POTUS grasps the depth of revulsion at the Putin regime felt by many conservatives and Republicans who were never crazy about him but have been supportive of his policies.

ICYMI: my take on 'The President‚Äôs Do-Over' @NRO Corner: https://t.co/8g7QT4jO78
@OrinKerr Even if subject of investigation relatively unimportant, I would say there should be real evidence of crime before a prosecutor is assigned. For POTUS, governance of country is more important than need for investigative secrecy, so I think we are entitled to know probe‚Äôs basis.
@OrinKerr I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs trifling - as calling it a ‚Äòprocess‚Äô objection suggests - to argue that POTUS should not be subjected to a criminal investigation absent strong publicly disclosed evidence of wrongdoing.
@OrinKerr Orin, the bit about the president ‚Äòbrazenly lying‚Äô is where you lose me. Even if it‚Äôs true, he is lying about someone else‚Äôs behavior for reasons that are easily understandable - that‚Äôs not excusable in a POTUS, but it‚Äôs not criminally culpable.
@OrinKerr My view, which is doubtless informed by doing nat-sec cases, is that sometimes there are considerations more important to the country than investigative secrecy - which in most situations is, I agree, paramount.
@realartinro I would never have given them blind faith in the first place. I still have great faith in them. One of my worries for years, tho, has been that they don‚Äôt appreciate how important it is that they make us comfortable trusting them.

@BoSnerdley @WashTimes ‚ÄòSTART‚Äô? https://t.co/aNX1QtWFoA
@BuckSexton @BradMossEsq Brad, I was very relieved Friday to learn that DAG Rosenstein had briefed POTUS. I advised skeptics that POTUS could have directed DOJ not to file indictment if it was thought problematic for summit, &amp; that advisors must have thought it strengthened his hand.
@JonahNRO OUT OF JAMESON‚ÄôS?
@jpodhoretz You mean about whether DAG gave heads up about indictment before POTUS left on trip?
@OrinKerr I don't think it's narrow at all. The CI investigation of Russia's election interference is very important. A criminal investigation of the president is very debilitating for the gov't - if there are grounds, we should all know what they are.
@OrinKerr Orin, I said *special counsel* investigation is 'superfluous' b/c there already was an investigation. I never said there should be no investigation. Usually, tho, evidence of a crime precedes assignment of prosecutor, not prosecutor 'trying to find out' if there was wrongdoing.

Mueller's politicized and foolish indictment - my @NRO column: https://t.co/kWsj6PElut
That said, Mueller's indictment is a political stunt that actually helps Putin's claim that Russians are presumed innocent until they have the trial that will never happen. My @NRO column: https://t.co/kWsj6PElut
Trump's kowtowing to Putin on election meddling was shameful. But the whole idea of meeting with Putin was wrong. He is a thug, an aggressor who annexes other countries' territory and assassinates people in Western cities. We do not need better relations with thugs.
@Bourgy @realDonaldTrump Leaving aside his 2016 election shenanigans, it ratifies his annexation of Crimea, for one thing. Why should we be meeting with a dictator who seizes other countries‚Äô territory? The meeting says we‚Äôre fine with that. Putin should be shunned - regarded as the lowlife he is.
@PaddyCunio @realDonaldTrump No, I don‚Äôt.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, it‚Äôs not about how well *you* do. It‚Äôs about whether America does well by having a meeting you don‚Äôt have to have that inflates the prestige of an anti-American thug regime we should be squeezing rather than burnishing.
ICYMI, my week be @NRO  column: Strzok by a Farce https://t.co/f5iayAqWjx
@MarkSZaidEsq The points are that there has never been evidence Trump was involved in the espionage despite his disturbing Russia rhetoric, and foreign aggression, whether by terrorist orgs or hostile nations, is not a law-enforcement issue fit for indictments.
@MarkSZaidEsq I‚Äôve also never doubted that Russian gov‚Äôt officials were behind the espionage, so I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre emphasis on GOVT is for. And I slammed the Bush admin for regarding Russia as a ‚Äòstrategic partner.‚Äô
@MarkSZaidEsq Mark, I‚Äôve never applauded anyone who thinks a great nation responds to aggression by a foreign power with a pointless indictment. I‚Äôve never been ok with Russia, even when Democrats insisted they were fine and the Cold War was ancient history. I did not need 2016 to know this.

@BradMossEsq Brad, I‚Äôve always been convinced that Mueller will be very thorough, since obligation to write a report is broader than to bring indictment. He will feel obliged to explain even if he can‚Äôt charge. It will be up to DOJ how much becomes public.
@ByronYork I do not see point of indictment that is more political document than charging instrument. I would require him to testify in public. But I wouldn‚Äôt make him disclose info that shouldn‚Äôt be disclosed just so I can make obvious point that there‚Äôs no intent to try these cases.
@BradMossEsq I think the clear references to WikiLeaks, which is actually complicit but has not been charged, tells me more.
There are 144 million more people in Russia who will never see the inside of an American courtroom. If Mueller indicts all of them, his stats will be *really* impressive ... and there‚Äôll still be no Trump espionage conspiracy against the election.
@DonnaDiorio @NRO Yes.

@HoffmanNate @AshaRangappa_ @BradMossEsq If he did that, he‚Äôd be impeached by sundown. Then he‚Äôd be convicted of assault. How is that a problem?
@BradMossEsq @GaelenSchumann I always think of this when I talk about people in good prosecutor‚Äôs office checking their politics at the door. If you assumed people infected legal judgment with politics, you‚Äôd have guessed wrong on where many stood. Everyone tried to get it right.
@BradMossEsq @GaelenSchumann My recollection is thinking there could be no case on POTUS, but some thought could be honest services fraud consp on others if could prove pardon-for-votes quid pro quo. I didn‚Äôt think you could get around const‚Äôl issue - except by impeachment.
@BradMossEsq @GaelenSchumann In fact, as chief AUSA, I had the part of the Clinton pardons investigation involving NewSquare and urged the office to shut it down on constitutional grounds. Finally shut down later, more on lack of quid pro quo evidence than on my theory. I still think I was right.

@joshgerstein You are right that that's the quote, and that he should have thought to clarify whether he was paraphrasing Comey or giving Trump's version. Doesn't mean we can't infer from context that he was doing the former - he was correcting Stephanopoulos' portrayal of Comey's version.
@RandyEBarnett You mean The Fall!?!
@joshgerstein You probably saw it, which is always better than transcript (esp rushed one) that I'm going on. Not sure I'd take your advice, tho. I think Comey's version is more credible and it's a dumb thing for POTUS to deny, so I'd be arguing that even by Jim's version, no obstruction.
I think throughout the interview Rudy hedges in a lot of places about what he knows from POTUS versus what he knows from the public record and other conversations. I doubt anything he said would be admissible in court as an admission by Trump through an agent - not clear enough.
Josh, I don't think so. Appears he was correcting Stephanopoulos, who wrongly said Comey's version was that he had been 'directed'; Giuliani was saying that Comey's own version was a request - 'Can you give a man a break' - not necessarily that Trump now adopts that version. https://t.co/7rVTRX7HIL
@BradMossEsq Brad, they flip from courtroom legal defense to impeachment w/o clarifying. Personally, I don‚Äôt think a POTUS could be indicted for legal act (eg pardon) due to alleged corrupt intent. I have no doubt a POTUS could be impeached for it, tho, if Congress found abuse of power.

@julie_kelly2 @ProfMJCleveland @AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork For us legal types, too ‚Äî it may be educated speculation, but it‚Äôs still speculation!
@julie_kelly2 @ProfMJCleveland @AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork Julie, we still don‚Äôt know what Contreras conflict was, and Strzok may have been good for Flynn. More importantly, Flynn may well not want plea vacated because it may still be better for him than broader Mueller indictment - that‚Äôs why he pled in first place, I think.
@BradMossEsq @AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork Flynn‚Äôs got a lot in his favor in terms of mitigation and should get no time. If Mueller wants delay, I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs in it for Kelner to fight him. He wants Mueller to say Flynn was very cooperative. I doubt there‚Äôs anything more to it.
@ProfMJCleveland @AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork Good points. I think people who speculate Flynn might seek to w/draw plea don‚Äôt factor in 1) very uphill legally, 2) as much personal as legal decision (wants it over), 3) in unlikely event he prevailed, case doesn‚Äôt end ‚Äî Mueller could indict him on whatever.
@BradMossEsq @AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork Yup. Likely one of those cases where lawyers content to roll it over forever (no upside for defense counsel to fight prosecutor who wants sentencing delay), and judge wants to make sure defendant really ok with another adjournment.
@AriFleischer @MZHemingway @ByronYork Ari, I think ‚Äòfume‚Äô overstates it. If Flynn cooperating &amp; expected to testify, sentencing should be ppd indefinitely. If he‚Äôs not, should‚Äôve happened already. Judge prob‚Äôly irked that it‚Äôs in limbo &amp; wants Flynn there to make sure he consents to Mueller delay. More on this tom‚Äôw.

@Susan_Hennessey @steve_vladeck I'm afraid I don't. I'm also influenced by the ripe dead certainty that if Bush had run an informant at 3 peeps (incl co-chair) of 2008 Obama campaign, anyone who tried to parse whether it was really spying would be ostracized from polite company.
@TCleveland4Real @nchaseteeples No, it‚Äôs not necessary. It would have been prudent since we don‚Äôt want incumbent admin snooping on opp party campaign unless there‚Äôs a really good reason. I think debate is over: What‚Äôs a really good reason?
@ArnelGregg I had the Lightning, so there‚Äôs that. I prob‚Äôly go with Vegas on theory that Ovechkin is an agent of a foreign power ...
@nchaseteeples No, they can‚Äôt be unwitting. Page is a US citizen; if he didn‚Äôt act *knowingly* he can‚Äôt be agent of foreign power under FISA, 50 USC 1801(b)(2) - https://t.co/qGdSAaNbi9.
@Susan_Hennessey @steve_vladeck Susan, I sat thru zillion trials where prosecutors called the operatives ‚Äòundercovers‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòinformants,‚Äô while defense lawyers called them ‚Äòspies‚Äô &amp; ‚Äòrats.‚Äô Commonsense people got the point. So no, I‚Äôm not even a little concerned. I want to know why done, I don‚Äôt care what called.
@steve_vladeck Also, you may be offended by the term ‚Äòspy‚Äô; I am not. Put aside that it‚Äôs commonly used interchangeably with ‚Äòinformant‚Äô; If the FBI had solid evidence that Page was a clandestine agent of a foreign power, I would enthusiastically support treating him as a spy.

@BradMossEsq Brad, due respect right back at you, but when Comey wrote his letter before the election, all I heard from you guys was that political campaigns make everything different. Last week we heard Mueller going dark ‚Äòcause, y‚Äôknow, wouldn‚Äôt want to affect midterms.
You know that if a Republican admin had done this to a Dem candidate, NYTimes &amp; WPost wouldn‚Äôt be rationalizing it, they‚Äôd be proposing articles of impeachment.
If ‚Äòexisting CI concern‚Äô was valid reason to spy on campaign, why not own it and be proud of it? Why did they pretend they didn‚Äôt do it?
It‚Äôs not clear Trump was not intercepted (or that Manafort wasn‚Äôt while living in TrumpTower) even if Trump‚Äôs hard lines weren‚Äôt targeted.		Warrant on Page permitted collection of back comms while he was in campaign		‚ÄòExisting CI concern‚Äô is not a basis to spy on campaign.
They said we didn‚Äôt spy on campaign. When we pointed to CarterPage, they said he was out of campaign then (tho warrant allowed seizure of past campaign comms). Now, it‚Äôs undeniable they spied on campaign, so they say it was for campaign‚Äôs own good.

@jadler1969 Pretty much how they felt in 2007-08, when Dems ran an AG out of town, since document demands are what always happens when political branches controlled by diff parties.
@jabeale @seanmdav Jason, no, but the Aug 2 memo does not make it conditional on ‚Äòarising out of‚Äô Russia investigation. It expressly gives SC jurisdiction on Manafort/Ukraine. I don‚Äôt like it b/c I think SC bad institution, but judge has no business telling DOJ what prosecutor to assign case to.
@seanmdav @directorblue True, but it‚Äôs up to POTUS to give a clear, accountable order. Railing on Twitter or grousing thru lawyers is a cop out. If he is ORDERING that this information be disclosed, then ORDER it.
@seanmdav Wish there were vehicle to challenge SC‚Äôs jurisdiction. What happened here (prosecutor given unfettered jurisdiction to find crime) should not happen. But DOJ clearly had auth to assign Manafort case to SC. Whether SC jurisdiction otherwise problematic irrelevant to Manafort case
@seanmdav Sean, I don‚Äôt think so. I am obviously a critic of how this was done, but I believe that if it‚Äôs clear that SC has jurisdiction to do Manafort case(and Aug2 memo makes that clear), the theoretical outer limit of SC‚Äôs jurisdiction is not this judge‚Äôs concern.

@RadioFreeTom 4/ I respect and like you, so I apologize for losing my temper.
@RadioFreeTom 3/ I have said that if SC can show proof of a crime that POTUS is complicit in and that SC needs evidence only POTUS can provide, he should be able to question POTUS.
@RadioFreeTom 2/ my point is that it makes no sense to say we need to grill POTUS, but it‚Äôs not important to grab all potentially relevant evidence of agent misconduct.
@RadioFreeTom Tom, 1/ we apparently disagree about the relevance of Strzok. I don‚Äôt think I did this, but you‚Äôre a smart guy so if you think I did, I‚Äôll clarify: I am not saying Strzok has anything to do with whether Trump colluded/obstructed.
@RadioFreeTom Sheesh. It‚Äôs not that they‚Äôre connected substantively. It‚Äôs that you should take a consistent position about demanding production of evidence. You don‚Äôt get that?
@RadioFreeTom Tom, maybe if you pretend Trump‚Äôs not president your considerable brain will kick in again. Job of POTUS singularly important. If you think he should be subpoenaed, you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs too intrusive to subpoena agents involved in misconduct to determine scope of misconduct.
@RadioFreeTom Even if this weren‚Äôt incoherent, I‚Äôd have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. I don‚Äôt think POTUS obstructed justice or colluded with Russia, but that has nothing to do with Strzok. He‚Äôs relevant on gov‚Äôt conduct, which is important even if you‚Äôd rather not deal.
@RadioFreeTom Where have I said that about Strzok‚Äôs texts? Main thing I‚Äôve said about Strzok is people should reserve judgment b/c I‚Äôm told he‚Äôs a good agent and he did not accuse Flynn of lying. Of course his texts are relevant to whether there was misconduct. But you‚Äôre just making shit up.
@RadioFreeTom You‚Äôre so Trump deranged you‚Äôre lost. I‚Äôve catalogued Trump lies repeatedly. But he‚Äôs still president. He‚Äôs not Trump, he‚Äôs president. That‚Äôs not equivalence. You can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs essential to grill POTUS, but we don‚Äôt need to subpoena other potentially relevant evidence.
@BradMossEsq @RadioFreeTom Fine. Genius was saying that I‚Äôm saying that, and I haven‚Äôt come close to saying that.
@RadioFreeTom Tom, no one is saying investigation of chief executive should be dumped. The point is that if you‚Äôre going to demand POTUS interview, then you shouldn‚Äôt decide other avenues are foreclosed. You‚Äôre too smart not to get that, so I‚Äôm thinking you‚Äôre a waste of time.

@hughhewitt @USAGSessions Ordinarily, a prosecutor would consult his superior before referral in something obviously important. As I read appointment order, Mueller wouldn‚Äôt *have to* consult if not asking for more jurisdiction, but it would be prudent. Nothing is ‚Äòstandard‚Äô in this case.
Last week, I tried to explain that this was likely to be a big problem for Trump. https://t.co/lIxWr0Fhhk
@hughhewitt @USAGSessions Hugh, I imagine it depends on whether Mueller 1- considered asking for expansion of jurisdiction, or 2- decided to just refer. 1 would definitely require consult w/ Rosenstein, 2 probably would. SDNY is proper venue for S/W - it‚Äôs where Cohen‚Äôs office is.

#SchiffMemo highlights Russian effort to recruit Page, as @ByronYork notes in his piece, but effort to recruit an American is not enough for a FISA warrant. My @NRO column: https://t.co/9aYg2yA1ej
@OrinKerr To be clear, I mean I've written a lot of *criminal* warrants (same 'alternative investigative techniques' rule in T-III). I helped agents write some FISA warrants in mid-90s (pre-Wall), but DOJ-NatSecDiv that deals w/ FISA Court (OIPR back in those days) runs show on that.
@OrinKerr It's a very fair point. Not sure I've been consistent about including this in every column, but we clearly don't know everything FBI knows and must draw inferences based on what's been disclosed + common sense. You are right, clearly, that this is not as good as knowing for sure.
@OrinKerr They‚Äôve been amazingly open about fact C-I inv is about Trump-Russia. Once surveillance is up and running, go back to stored communications. Steele dossier allegations they included show Trump-Russia was focus. Inconceivable they would not have looked for comms w/ Trump campaign.
@OrinKerr I‚Äôm saying there is reason to suspect this rule has been violated and, as I observed in column, it would be good to know what DOJ said in warrant. (I‚Äôve written many warrants; this is not always easy standard to satisfy outside org crime context.)
@OrinKerr Inference from 3 memos, incl Grassley-Graham, which says Steele dossier main basis. Plus, no charge against Page tho FBI dealing w/ him since 2013. I am presuming him innocent in absence of evidence to contrary + strong motive to produce if exists.
@OrinKerr Orin, I'm drawing an inference from facts that (a) it has not leaked (cf. Page, Manafort), (b) govt officials say no warrant on person while officially in campaign (GP was, CP &amp; PM out by Sept), (c) no allegation GP an agent of foreign power (he heard things).
@RBrookhiser @lseltzer @OrinKerr Orin was good enough to give me a heads up and I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôd be happy to engage as soon as I get back home from the stuff I‚Äôm out doing.

@joshgerstein @DelWilber @NRO Interesting. I don‚Äôt see why they need both, and I could see some ways it could hurt, but you don‚Äôt have to dismiss until down the road anyway (assuming convictions on new indictment, dismiss old one at sentencing, I think).
@DelWilber @NRO Yeah. That‚Äôs virtually always the way it goes. Plus, if they were gonna keep the first, why repeat FBAR stuff in superseder? This is much tighter, and exposure on bank fraud counts is so much you don‚Äôt need $ laundering (which I think was shaky anyway).

@CBHessick Yes. I was worried about Russia when Obama admin "resetting,"  &amp;  Trump's reprehensible bouquets to Putin was a big reason I opposed him in GOP primaries. Admins of both parties for 20 yrs have deluded themselves about Russia as "strategic partner" -- they're our adversary.
@CBHessick DOJ used to believe distinction b/w crim &amp; C-I was critically important ‚Äì fear of using former as pretext for latter was why ‚Äúwall‚Äù imposed in 90s. That was overreaction, but doesn‚Äôt mean distinction unimportant. /8x
@CBHessick No prob if conduct counterintel, happen to find crime from which DOJ conflicted, then appoint SC. But that‚Äôs not what happened. /7
@CBHessick There is no a basis in regs to appoint special counsel to conduct counterintel inv ‚Äì which makes sense b/c only need SC for prosecution, which is not objective of counterintel. /6
@CBHessick There were not grounds to believe Trump campaign conspired in a crime at time Mueller appointed. /5
@CBHessick But special counsel appointed only if grounds for crim investigation from which DOJ conflicted. /4
@CBHessick I continue, for example, to be baffled by gov‚Äôt failure to seize DNC servers &amp; to farm out forensic analysis to Dem contractor, which would harm prosecution. /3
@CBHessick There is no doubt that DOJ had auth to investigate Russian interference in election, without limitations (except those that always apply), and should do so. /2
@CBHessick A special counsel is triggered by 2 things ‚Äì not just a crime but a conflict. /1
@CBHessick Carissa, interference happened notwithstanding sanctions already imposed due to prior Russian aggression. I'm all for sanctions, but insufficient on their own. Untriable indictment no help. Last round of sanctions was theatrical support for political collusion narrative.

@julie_kelly2 FISA, at 50 USCode Sec 1804(a)(6)(C): in application, gov‚Äôt must certify ‚Äúthat such information cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.‚Äù
@julie_kelly2 @ChuckRossDC 3/ Usual rule w/ electronic surveillance is must satisfy court that alternative investigative techniques have been tried and failed or would fail if tried. Was he such a central player in big plot that talking to him would have tipped everyone off &amp; undermined investigation?
@julie_kelly2 @ChuckRossDC 2/ What I'd like to know is: Since he cooperated w/ FBI/DOJ in prior Russia case (see pp. 12-13 in complaint, link below), why did they feel that needed FISA surveillance on him? Why not go talk to him &amp; take his temperature re Steele allegations? https://t.co/yVdFRkmpo4
@julie_kelly2 Julie, 1/ @ChuckRossDC reported a while back that he'd met agents 4x for combined 10hrs. That's before Mueller appointed, but it's with same investigation Mueller is running. Between that and congressional testimony, seems he's provided lots of info.
@bradheath But we already know it included more than Steele ‚Äî issue is how necessary Steele was to probable cause showing. If essential, the omissions are bad, regardless of how many judges involved.
@MZHemingway Yup. Let‚Äôs see the transcript. Dems &amp; FBI/DOJ had opp‚Äôty to review memo before release. If they now say something‚Äôs wrong, don‚Äôt tell me your recollection, show me the documents.
If the claim is that material info about source credibility was omitted, what‚Äôs the relevance of fact that 4 GOP-appointed FISA judges approved warrants? Question is whether any 1 of them would have ok‚Äôd with full disclosure.  We don‚Äôt know answer to that.
@JamesAGagliano @CoolBreeze1865 I hope so. We really haven‚Äôt had great NYC college hoops since BigEast glory days when Johnnies were relevant.
@JamesAGagliano @CoolBreeze1865 Tough season for good guy Chris Mullin.
@drawandstrike You‚Äôre assuming focus of investigation remained Trump throughout. May not be so. Recall, Trump told during this time he‚Äôs not a suspect. We don‚Äôt know what surveillance yielded and what direction investigation took. Focus should be Russia, not Trump.
@merovee458 @stephenfhayes 2 diff investigations. In first, he‚Äôs target of Russian intel recruitment and cooperates w/ US govt against Russia. In second, he‚Äôs seen by US govt as agent of Russia working against US.
Advocates for addressing FISA abuse are self-defeating if argument is seen as Trojan horse to attack Mueller inv. Mueller champions self-defeat by portraying his inv as synonymous with ‚ÄôTrump colluded with Russia.‚Äô
Yes, see @EliLake on this point. https://t.co/lpggRJYPIx https://t.co/NxFPC2qyyc
I don‚Äôt understand commentary about whether FISA warrant is ‚Äòinvalid.‚Äô That‚Äôs crim law concept. FISA is intel ‚Äî it‚Äôs not like govt has to give back information it learns. This is not prosecution situation where not fruit-of-poisonous-tree doctrine applies.
My working theory: neither side wants full disclosure. For Dems, it would show reliance on dossier. For Reps, govt theory was Putin could have blackmail material on Trump. Flattering to neither, so we‚Äôll not get disclosure and keep arguing over snippets and shadows.

@stephenfhayes My recollection - not sure I buy this, but fwiw - is reporting says FBI/DOJ had eye on Page from July but delayed seeking FISA warrant until Trump campaign &amp; he cut ties.
@CBHessick @LiglyCnsrvatari @RandyEBarnett @ashsoles Carissa, I just mean when prosecutor &amp; agents write, &amp; judge reviews, T-III, everybody expects work will eventually be disclosed &amp; litigated. Powerful incentive to exhibit consciousness of 4th Am &amp; other protections.
@stephenfhayes Steve, there is a big difference between when an investigation is opened, which is an administrative act, and when something real is done on it. Fact they didn‚Äôt seek FISA until Oct doesn‚Äôt mean Page inv wasn‚Äôt open well before. Fact Pap inv open doesn‚Äôt mean they did much on it.
@RandyEBarnett @ashsoles Randy, I think this will be bad. Because no counsel for target, FISA court expects DOJ to conform to high standard of disclosure re any credibility/ bias issues regarding sources in warrant app.

Did FBI/DOJ Use #SteeleDossier To Get FISA Warrant on Trump Campaign? My weekend @NRO column: https://t.co/8t6j2AMuRC
My last thought of Twitter day: You should follow @CBHessick if you want to get smarter, but you better be ready to bring it. And you better be resigned that bringing it may not be good enough!
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO I appreciate our exchange. It‚Äôll make me more careful. I cop to hating spec-counsel investigations. I‚Äôm not Trump apologist, but I don‚Äôt like assignment of prosecutor w/o prob-cause of crime. If they‚Äôve got provable crime, I‚Äôm all ears. But given gravity, should not be debatable.
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO If you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs theoretically possible to conspire in something that didn‚Äôt really happen, that‚Äôs clearly true - impossibility or failure is no defense. But hard to imagine charging collusion case on theory that the thing purportedly colluded in didn‚Äôt happen. /2
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO Carissa, you‚Äôve strained my brain to point I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm analyzing this as academic matter or as someone who‚Äôd have to convince a jury. If you‚Äôre going to charge someone w/ conspiracy to abet Russian hacking scheme, as practical matter, you must prove Russian hacking scheme./1
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO I‚Äôm sorry if I wasn‚Äôt clear. M needs to prove Russia conspiracy to hack if allegation is that Trump peeps colluded in Russia hack. But if allegation is Trump peeps colluded w/ Russia on some other crime, it‚Äôs irrelevant whether Russia hacked ... right?
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO Yup. I agree. But I‚Äôm not following how that bears on facts we‚Äôre dealing with. In abstract, I agree if you and I agreed to abet some hack, no need to prove Russia hacked. But why would we agree unless Russia actually hacked? In reality, isn‚Äôt the hack what prompts our agreement?
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO In abstract, I‚Äôm with you: If A &amp; B agree to help C violate law, you have conspiracy to violate that law. But where does that get us? Are you saying Trump guys agreed to help Russia hack - ie they didn‚Äôt nec know Russia would hack but agreed to help them do so? Sorry to be dense.
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO @RDEliason Doesn‚Äôt mean Mueller doesn‚Äôt have evidence of more serious crimes. Means he doesn‚Äôt have FLYNN ACCOMPLICE evidence of such crimes. If M charges F w/such crimes post-plea, means F didn‚Äôt disclose them pre-plea, despite agreeing to full co-op w/ M. Wld destroy F‚Äôs value as witness.
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO @RDEliason Carissa, I‚Äôm relying on Mueller‚Äôs co-op agreement w/ Flynn. Gives him pass on other crimes related to plea crime. Plea already depicts Flynn as liar. If later indict him on new corruption crimes, means he must have withheld info, meaning he‚Äôs a worse liar &amp; useless as witness. /1
RT @SandsSam: @CBHessick @AndrewCMcCarthy @CNN @NRO @RDEliason @jedshug That‚Äôs not how this works. Not how any of this works! You‚Äôre suppos‚Ä¶
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO If allegation is Trump &amp; Russia in bribery conspiracy (eg, lift sanctions in exchange for $$$) - guilty if can prove it, &amp; hacking irrelevant. But if allegation is Trump collusion in Russia hack conspiracy, gotta proveRussia hack conspiracy.
@CBHessick @CNN @NRO Carissa, this is where I think you divert from what we‚Äôre talking about. If allegation is that you &amp; friend conspired to sell drugs, you‚Äôre right - guilty. If allegation is you and friend conspired to participate in cartel‚Äôs drug dealing, gotta prove cartel‚Äôs drug dealing. /1
@CBHessick @CNN This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Mueller WANTS to impeach Trump. Means he is investigating to determine whether there‚Äôs a legitimate basis for doing so. /End
@CBHessick @CNN B/c no prosecutor would bank on being able to indict a POTUS, but there is precedent for impeaching POTUS based in part on obstruction, I continue to think impeachment is endgame. /19
@CBHessick @CNN Exception is if goal is to nail main suspect on a process crime, like obstruction. Perverting process is theme of obstruction case, not so problematic to have convicted liar witnesses. /18
@CBHessick @CNN It would have made them better cooperating witnesses. You don‚Äôt build good witness by pleading him to lying to the FBI - why wouldn‚Äôt he then lie to jury too? /17
@CBHessick @CNN I know SDNY practices are not nationwide, but they are prudent. Mueller‚Äôs a smart guy. If they‚Äôd have given him that evidence, he‚Äôd have made them plead to it &amp; gotten it into public domain. /16
@CBHessick @CNN My point is that if they‚Äôd given Mueller cyber-esp conspiracy proof, he‚Äôd have had them plead to that. /15
@CBHessick @CNN Puzzled by Prof Hessick‚Äôs assertion that I don‚Äôt think Flynn &amp; Papadoupoulos cooperating. I‚Äôve said they are ‚Äî fact statements accompanying pleas make that obvious. /14
@CBHessick @CNN That, tho, would be diversion from collusion hypothesis that launched investigation. It would not depend on a Russian hack attack - separate conspiracy (tho could say related one). /13
@CBHessick @CNN Of course it‚Äôs theoretically possible that there was some other Russia-Trump conspiracy. Indeed, I believe Mueller (&amp; FBI/DOJ before him) theorize possible quid-pro-quo on sanctions relief. /12
@CBHessick @CNN N.B.: I am not saying cyber-esp is only conceivable conspiracy. Just that cyber-esp is linchpin of collusion narrative (i.e., Russia hacked election &amp; Trump somehow coordinated in that). /11
@CBHessick @CNN If I am right, Mueller‚Äôs prob is not just that he can‚Äôt prove Russia did the hacking; can‚Äôt prove it orchestrated conspiracy to do so. That conspiracy has to provably exist for Trump peeps to join it. /10
@CBHessick @CNN Completely agree w/ Prof. Hessick that we do not know all the facts. B/c so much public dispute, I believe we‚Äôd have heard if there were solid proof. But I could absolutely be wrong about that. /9
@CBHessick @CNN I see this as a PROOF problem, not a legal theory problem. I stipulate there was, in fact, a cyber-esp conspiracy. Q is whether Mueller has sufficient courtroom proof of it. /8
@CBHessick @CNN That‚Äôs why, in collusion context we‚Äôve been discussing for a year, cyber-esp is critical. It is conspiracy crime Russia &amp; its agents carried out, &amp; Trump campaign suspected of colluding in. /7
@CBHessick @CNN Flaw in @CBHessick argument is subtle shift from cyber-esp to ‚Äúhelp Russia‚Äù. It‚Äôs not a crime to help Russia, or agree to do so. Have to help them, or agree to help them, DO SOMETHING CRIMINAL. /6
@CBHessick @CNN Still, agreement on specific criminal objective must be proved beyond reas‚Äôl doubt. Unless prosecutor can prove A &amp; B agreed, there‚Äôs no agreement for C to join. /5
@CBHessick @CNN I‚Äôm well aware that conspiracy is mere agreement, need not succeed, and once shown very little evidence needed to connect someone to it. /4
@CBHessick @CNN I expressly take it as a given that Russia conducted a cyberespionage (cyber-esp) attack. Trump questions this (on occasion) but I don‚Äôt, so I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm contributing to hoax narrative. /3
@CBHessick @CNN I don't question legal principles she lays out, but I am talking about facts as we know them. /2
@CBHessick @CNN B/c I have great respect for the excellent @CBHessick, taking time to respond to criticism I think misplaced. Either I wasn't clear enough or she‚Äôs misunderstood me on the following. /1

@BradMossEsq @allahpundit Yes. And even with inadmissible h‚Äôsay, you have to give judge basis to believe its credible (eg, we‚Äôve relied on this anonymous source 6x &amp; corroborated each time...).
@BradMossEsq @allahpundit Can‚Äôt remember that but not as crazy as sounds. Eg: unlike most states, feds can do GJ presentation wholly by hearsay. You have to call competent witnesses at trial, but not before. So you have the admissible evidence, but you present it as h‚Äôsay pretrial.

@OrinKerr Orin, more on this tom'w. Point is: it damages witness, and thus case, to plead witness out to false-statements if you have serious underlying crime. If Mueller had Flynn complicity in collusion, he'd have made him plead to it. BUT plea makes total sense if it's obstruction case.

#Mueller Investigation: Politics, Not Law Enforcement or Counterintelligence - My weekend @NRO column: https://t.co/wiF1muJa9X
@skwogler It‚Äôs politics not law-enforcement. Subject of tom‚Äôw‚Äôs weekend column ...
3/3 If Mueller had collusion case, he‚Äôd make Flynn plead guilty to big charge and earn sentencing leniency by cooperating. Instead, Flynn pled to small charge - process crime, likely no jail time - on promise of future cooperation. So there is no collusion case.
2/3 Competent prosecutors make cooperator plead guilty to big charge. Coop‚Äôr thus over barrel: if he doesn‚Äôt cooperate, will be sentenced without leniency on big charge he has already pled to. This incents coop‚Äôr to earn leniency.
1/3 Common misconception: Prosecutors entice cooperation with minor charge and threaten to drop hammer w/ big charges later if cooperation not adequate. No: That would front load benefit of deal before cooperator has provided info/testimony.

@NvrRyan @kuhn_josiah I thought about that, but apparently he‚Äôd already been prosecuted for it. In fact, it was upon release from that fed sentence that state took custody for old drug charge that state then released him on - that‚Äôs why he wasn‚Äôt deported. Shameful.
@Mikell_Pine @DavidAFrench He was convicted of being a *felon* in possession. Being an *illegal alien* in possession is a different crime.
@Mikell_Pine @DavidAFrench No, for 2 reasons. 1- not same crime (state did not charge illegal alien in possession of gun); 2- dual sovereignty (state conviction does not bar subsequent Fed prosecution).
It is a federal felony, up to 10 yrs‚Äô imprisonment, to be an illegal alien in possession of firearm (18 USC secs.922(g), 924). DOJ should indict Zarate if haven‚Äôt already. Sentence consecutive to today‚Äôs state gun conviction could keep him in prison 13 yrs or so.

@benjaminwittes Since the guy who is suggesting he is the victim has the unilateral power to do it, if it doesn‚Äôt happen it won‚Äôt be out of deference to precedent.
@benjaminwittes They don‚Äôt have to declassify the whole warrant. They can redact rest. They can do a declassified summary of what was said about dossier that protects sources. But speculation is hurting the country.
@benjaminwittes And no admins have ever been suspected of ties to hostile regime or of manufacturing same as basis for political spying. I think explaining/dispelling those suspicions more important than the precedent.
Generally have to give court basis for why info from source is credible. Let‚Äôs see what they said about any dossier info.
Why doesn‚Äôt admin declassify any FISA warrant in which dossier info was used (redacted as appropriate) so we can see if DOJ properly corroborated it or presented unvarnished oppo research to court?
@Jessicajohn911 Yeah, but AGs have to recuse themselves from cases on occasion (usu due to past work as private atty). There‚Äôs DOJ procedure for that - doesn‚Äôt mean need special counsel. Good US Atty will do.
Best course is to let DOJ do its work in normal course. Political demands for prosecution will only undermine any prosecution to benefit of wrongdoers.
Obviously, there‚Äôs now problem that if investigation leads to charges, defendants will argue it‚Äôs b/c of political pressure from POTUS, not evidence. Special counsel reports to DOJ so doesn‚Äôt solve problem. https://t.co/XGtUHGvXZU

@airbrown79 Are you serious? Do you know anything about what WikiLeaks has published? Do you know how much it has hurt our ability to protect the country?
@NotTooOld1 Yeah, I guess I was AWOL on those.
@ashsoles ‚ÄòNon comittally‚Äô overstates it, but why respond at all?
@salutes987 @airbrown79 Can you tell us about the Russian secrets they‚Äôve exposed?
Most telling phrase in DOJ letter is ‚Äòmatters not currently under investigation..‚Äô We don‚Äôt know - nor should we - whether DOJ is already investigating. No reason to think they‚Äôre not if there‚Äôs something worth criminal probe.
There is no reason to have special counsel on Clinton Foundation, Uranium One, etc. If there are potential crimes that are not time-barred, DOJ &amp; appropriate US Attorney‚Äôs can handle (and probably are for all we know).
@airbrown79 Sorry to disappoint your expectations, but do you doubt that WikiLeaks anti-American? That it‚Äôs doing Putin‚Äôs heavy lifting?
Wikileaks is a propaganda arm of the Putin regime. It‚Äôs done incalculable damage to our country. Why would Donald Trump Jr, or any American, have friendly contact with it? Besides ‚Äòyou‚Äôre an establishment hack‚Äô, what‚Äôs the explanation for this one?
@IrishTea1 Terry, POTUS is in charge of classified info. He can unseal what he chooses to unseal. Presumptively, in some instances, former POTUS can seal, but if current POTUS decides otherwise, that‚Äôs that.
@OrinKerr Orin, I‚Äôm a fan but, if it‚Äôs true (as I believe is true) that Wikileaks is a Russian intel operative, then the technical violation of the computer fraud statute is the least of the problems.

@vepchl In terms of ballot, which is what matters most, that is true.
@McAllisterDen @brithume I don't disagree with that. I've been on the receiving end of the Islamophobe, racism BS. If it's just accusation with no support, you're totally right. If there's corroboration, have to decide if enough given what's at stake (right or privilege).

Doesn‚Äôt mean gov‚Äôt couldn‚Äôt delay for interrogation &amp; status determination, but you‚Äôd lose any statements as evidence.
Whether Saipov enemy combatant depends on AUMF. I don‚Äôt see it. If he‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs domestic act &amp; courts open &amp; functioning so civilian case.
@saltyseathings I‚Äôm talking law not philosophy. We have a death penalty &amp; he appears to be textbook case. Whether we should have DP is a different question.
If he‚Äôs not (as here, I think), charge him &amp; get on with it - statements inadmissible but who cares?/x
If he is, designate &amp; detain him as such while interrogate - can always charge/try him later. /4
Should interrogate him for intel while figure out if he‚Äôs an enemy combatant (I don‚Äôt think he fits under AUMF). /3
Prob is telling him he doesn‚Äôt have to talk to you &amp; giving him lawyer who will tell him not to. /2
