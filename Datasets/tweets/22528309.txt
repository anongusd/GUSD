Sadly, we're now seeing the consequences of this poor policy all over the Middle East, including Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria.
Along with many congressional Democrats, the RSC continually rejected the Obama Administration's mismanagement and appeasement of the Iranian regime, especially its shortsighted and reckless nuclear agreement, which has only served to strengthen Iran's tyrannical government.
The RSC has continually pushed for tougher measures against the Iranian regime to combat its worldwide aggression, its support for terrorism, its backing of a tyrannical and genocidal regime in Syria, and its meddling in the affairs of its neighbors creating instability.

Repealing the individual mandate is the right policy decision. It frees Americans to make their own health care decisions and saves over $300 billion. It appears the Senate is keeping its promises. The House should do the same.
