@audreyalison Today we ran out of propane to heat our house! But, we will still welcome our son and his wife and newborn baby into our house on the  first of next month. They will move in with us because they are struggling. That's what parents do! Real parents take care of their own kids!
@audreyalison My wife has told me that the things I have posted here sound a little mysogonistic. I apologise for that. My true feeling is that it takes 2 people to raise a child(s). Weather it is two women, two men, or a man and a woman.
@audreyalison Also, I have lived in a forest, off the grid, for 22 years. When a person has to worry about providing electricity, water supply, heating, a sewer system, everything in life changes! The person stops blaming anyone else for their problems.
@audreyalison I left Los Angeles in 1993. I lived there for 33 years. Childcare has always been expensive. The dollar amounts have changed with inflation. Still, when you say that you have $53k to spend on having someone else take care of your kids, it sounds a lot like bragging to me.
@audreyalison You know, what you are saying, sounds a lot like, "I pawn my kids off on someone else to take care of them because I am too busy being successful". I've had very good jobs in my life, that's how I was able to support my family.
