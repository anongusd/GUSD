You can tell Paul Ryan is a cool laid back retired dad because he has a cool beard now while he still tries to do dumb shit like build the wall.

@MontyBoa99 @rich_noah @foxxtrot @MrkyMarc290 @moralinjuryblog @Imama14th @mala13slp @ktumulty @HillaryClinton @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight the difference between those terms is, at best, insignificant by definition. it seems less likely that there was vote tampering than exit polls being wrong.
@MontyBoa99 @foxxtrot @rich_noah @MrkyMarc290 @moralinjuryblog @Imama14th @mala13slp @ktumulty @HillaryClinton @NateSilver538 @FiveThirtyEight 'Statistically impossible' would imply a 0% chance of it happening, which is categorically and mathematically untrue.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenSchumer a) 5 years passed. b) you people wrote this shit bill. Stop tweeting and start taking action to understand the legislation you're writing, instead of destroying the economy with your ignorance.
@SenGillibrand 2020?
@Oaf8675309 @putemailhere31 @SteveScalise Fair enough. Regardless, I don't believe the second amendment supercedes the right of a community to govern itself. And it's certainly not a 'human right,' although it may be a constitutional right.
@putemailhere31 @Oaf8675309 @SteveScalise a) you are certainly not a well-regulated militia. b) at least one of you is some worthless bot
