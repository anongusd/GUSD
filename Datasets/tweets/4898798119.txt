@bluejaybeep @momma_sig @blaireinfeldt @RepMarkMeadows Illegal votes may in part explain why Hillary had a nearly two-million-vote lead in the popular vote, even though she lost convincingly in the Electoral College.  53% of the Democratic Party supports letting illegals vote, even though it's against the law. It's pretty clear why.
@bluejaybeep @momma_sig @blaireinfeldt @RepMarkMeadows The voting registration process in CA is notoriously loose. To suggest there is no illegal voting at all is absurd.  What's appalling, is the media's denial that illegals are voting. But why? Illegal votes shouldn't be allowed to sway U.S. elections.  So why tolerate them?

If Russian interference did happen it was on Obamas watch, and he should be held accountable but since Hillary was a lock to win he didn't care.

@john_sipher @jade_cabochon7 @OhNoSheTwitnt Gun laws had nothing to do with it because it was a stabbing. People were reacting to (D) Senator Warren bringing up family separation at the border instead of staying on topic of how this could have been avoided. Our Country needs to come together and heal.
@jade_cabochon7 @john_sipher @sean_prevost @OhNoSheTwitnt The Feds are in Chicago as we speak trying to fix this situation. The NRA cannot always be the sole fault for gun violence.

The mass murderers often obtain their guns from a registered owner. We have strict background checks.There are very strict gun laws in Chicago, &amp; there's a terrible problem with shootings there
@jade_cabochon7 @john_sipher @sean_prevost @OhNoSheTwitnt No neither are fine.  Race has nothing to do with it. Conservatives never take that position. The left have this preconceived notion that we single out Hispanics. Murder would have simply been prevented if the Immigration system wasn't flawed. The other we're still trying 2 fix.
@sirDukeDevin @makingmoves17 Trump knew he wasn't invited to the Funeral and not given an opportunity to give a eulogy. A no vote to fail a repeal attempt on the (un)affordable care act proved McCain's distain for Trump who also was responsible for passing the fake dossier. Their feud was never ending.
@MichaelSkolnik @makingmoves17 How are strict gun laws working in Chicago? Good thing Trump has sent the Feds in to help out with the issue. What are you saying let's take all the guns away from the law abiding citizens who will be left without a way to defend themselves? 😳 Entire US will be just like Chicago

@Supermom1242 Your "trigger" Atheist Apologist response makes it clear that we cannot have a civil discussion. I am making valid political points and trying to discuss the issues today. I am a free thinker, it takes courage to speak out common sense thoughts about todays immigration issues.
@SenWarren My heart breaks for the parents of Mollie Tibbits who are permanently separated from their daughter who had her whole life and her dreams ahead taken away by the act of a coward. Why now mention this separated children policies issue that has nothing to do with this?

We The People are not buying this leftist agenda anymore. Breaks my heart that everytime there's a human tragedy the left have to rush to the political football!
@Supermom1242 Kate Steinle has also been permanently separated from her parents. My heart breaks for both of the lives lost.  It is sad that the priorities of the left agenda are so out of whack that We The People are left alone to defend ourselves with no new legislation to prevent this.
@PalmerReport Or the Mueller team is targeting all of the above. Too bad the investigation didn't pan out. Now, threatened to lose their grip on power forever, they pathetically suggested Impeachment. No chance of that. All distractions, lies, and unwarranted hatred towards Trump is appalling.
@PalmerReport @makingmoves17 Don't pass out holding your breath on that one. Typical criticism from the left. So predictable. When the tables are turned and the real criminals are brought to justice you will be wishing you walked away from the panicked and (D) esperate party today.
@EdKrassen @makingmoves17 Everything you said except insert Hillary in place of Trump and you are more convincing.

@john_sipher @sean_prevost @OhNoSheTwitnt Guns don't kill people. Illegal aliens that shouldn't have been here in the first place PERMANENTLY separated a beautiful daughter from her parents. Senator Warren's remarks reveal that the Government is definitely not looking out for the American people. Very sick left agenda.

@NumbersMean @DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump Before you spike the football, look carefully at the chart again.  Barrack Hussein Obama never had 5 straight quarters with GDP at 2.2 or higher. 2/3 of his high marks were preceded with negative growth.  Look @realDonaldTrump has had in the past 5 quarters 3, 2.8, 2.3, 2.2, 4.1.
@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump Once again you are wrong https://t.co/F0bMgAmeEi If your going to swear at least have a reason.  You sound like a 5 year old.
@NumbersMean @DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump One thing I do know is the Policies of the Republican Administrations have worked well for the U.S. since the Reagan era. Low taxes work. Both sides cannot agree to that.  Clinton was fortunate to be in the Tech. Boom era. Higher taxes have a tendency to hurt jobs and slow growth
@DavidWongNYC @NumbersMean @realDonaldTrump Refering to the 90% negative news on MSM of Trump.  Obama got a free pass. Here's a bar of soap for your potty mouth. You are such a hater and a poor sport. You know we would have not had this success under Hillary don't you.
@DavidWongNYC @NumbersMean @realDonaldTrump Don't you feel safer with a strong built up military or do you want it to be weak like pre WWII levels under Obama? Give the economy a chance, if we cut spending, the extra revenue from added jobs will make up for the tax cuts.  Voodoo economics worked for Ronald Reagan.

@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump Border wall is going up as we speak. All of Trump's family is legal. Not sure we're you got that. Democrats are the biggest liars, leakers, hypocrites, flip flops and double standard creators of All time. Trump has stayed true to his campaign promises.
@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump Will see about that, 4.1+ GDP without help from Congress is quite remarkable and will help pay down the debt. All of Obummer's stimulus packages were a waste. Cash for clunkers, bailout of GM, Solyndra yes really not good. The failure ofObama care was his so called legacy.
@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump Too bad McCain voted no on the repeal. RIP and prayers to his family but still that hurt.
@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump You cannot answer the question. Don't complain about the situation we're in if you can't offer any suggestions or ideas to make things better. I see your hate for Trump is greater than your love for America. Trump is in the clear from the probe and never stopped working to #MAGA.
@DavidWongNYC @realDonaldTrump DemocRats have yet to offer any support or solutions of their own. All they do is vote no, obstruct, and are for everything the Trump Administration is against and against everything the Trump Administration is for. What do the Democrats run on?  No ICE, higher taxes, Keep AHA

@USBCMatt @JeffRichgels Back then, I was only 6 weeks old! #younggun I still feel young and motivated to succeed at #RenoNBS this year! :)
@ObanAleyna Thanks for sharing, enjoy reading the quotes, feeling more and more positive.
@ObanAleyna Personal experience, my 5 previous bosses who mistreated me, yeah all of them are no longer employed. #vindication, #knockonwood
@DaveRamsey You are absolutely right Dave! That is why I am following you. I am on a quest to continually better myself everyday! #Champion
@AaronHeffner @DaveRamsey @Patriots It was also a great interception by Butler.
@nytimes Sounds like another jab at Conservatives by the Liberals.  However the year 2000 did end the Clinton era. A Bush victory over Gore!
@seanhannity U R a very sincere news broadcaster. Thanks for caring so much about our Country and Citizens well being, by vetting the POTUS!
@FoxNews Would Be More intriguing if all battle it out alone or Kasich drops out. The GOP Needs to select ONE ASAP &amp; focus on the Clinton's!
