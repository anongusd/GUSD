@sarahpmb @GOPChairwoman Yeah? The Dems know that if they get money flowing from taxpayers thru the gov to colleges and universities, and then funnel it exclusively to liberal free speech-hating schools then they will arrive at their ultimate goal - absolute power!

@MJADetBos @burkinator20xx @GOPChairwoman There you go again. Won‚Äôt you get a grip? What a slippery slope you‚Äôre on! Proverbs 16:32 KJV	[32] He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
@MJADetBos @burkinator20xx @GOPChairwoman There you go again. Please stop with your hateful spirit. Proverbs 25:28 KJV	[28] He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
@MJADetBos @burkinator20xx @GOPChairwoman There you go again. Hateful.
@MJADetBos @burkinator20xx @GOPChairwoman Why does your statement come across as selfish and mean spirited? Why is it that you believe you are so right that everyone else must bow down to you and submit to your demands? Who established truth before you arrived and who will carry on after you‚Äôre gone? Myopic!
@MJADetBos @burkinator20xx @GOPChairwoman You speak heresy. Nobody wants a political bureaucracy to confiscate private monies and sacrifice them to this false god. Exodus 20:2-3 KJV	[2] I am the Lord thy God,	[3] Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman ‚ÄúFor by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.‚Äù
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman John 1:1-3 KJV	[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] The same was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman No. Satan is a liar and he‚Äôs the father of all lies. ‚ÄúThe thief cometh but for to steal, to kill, and to destroy...‚Äù Just look at the damage and destruction that he‚Äôs caused in our lives. Mine was no different than yours, before I was born again. See John 3:1-21
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Not so. Again, God is a trinity and he designed everything that He created to lead us back to him. Satan has lied and perverted knowledge so that those who do not know the Scriptures cannot possibly find Him. Kindest regards, my friend. It‚Äôs been fun.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Proverbs 23:9 KJV	[9] Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.	Proverbs 10:8 KJV	[8] The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall. Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman He‚Äôs the only entity whose reason for being is found in himself. All others find their reason for being outside of themselves. He‚Äôs so perfect that He necessarily exists. He has no beginning or end. He is alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman And further, it‚Äôs a trinity of trinities. In time there is past, present, and future. In space there is height, width, and depth. In matter there‚Äôs solid, liquid, and gas. Only an all wise, omniscient God could conceive of this from eternity. He‚Äôs outside it and unaffected by it.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Just stop and think about the folly of a statement that begins with, ‚ÄúOver 15 million years ago...‚Äù I mean, says WHO? Name him. What a cruel joke! In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. A continuum of time, space, and matter. It‚Äôs a trinity. Imagine that.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Proverbs 24:3-5 KJV	[3] Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: [4] And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. [5] A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Proverbs 24:6-8 KJV	[6] For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war (debate): and in multitude of counsellors (verses) there is safety. [7] Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate. [8] He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Who among your mentors can make such a claim as this? Proverbs 19:20-21 KJV	[20] Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. [21] There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord , that shall stand.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Yep. It‚Äôs sure alright. Psalm 33:10-11 KJV	[10] The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect. [11] The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman So you believe in the newfangled term, ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù. Daniel Webster wouldn‚Äôt permit such a ludicrous word to be included in the dictionary because he knew a counterfeit when he saw it. Came straight from Satan so men would begin to disbelieve the Bible and believe anything.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Learned it where I used to work pertaining to confined spaces. Do you believe in millions of years?
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Psalm 24:1-2 KJV	[1] The earth is the Lord's , and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. [2] For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. His plans cannot and will not be thwarted. He has not relinquished that authority.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman God‚Äôs jurisdiction, from juris meaning law and diction meaning to speak, knows no bounds. He is sovereign. Nothing is left to random chance. He commanded the oceans where to stop: the area, the depth, and the bounds. No worries! Praise Him! üëèüòä
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Sounds like man can no more affect the climate than he can affect the distance between the sun and the earth. I‚Äôm glad to know God knows the end from the beginning and that He holds it firmly in His grasp. A man is immortal until God is finished working with and through him.
@IncredCanemian @b6sgt @GOPChairwoman Makes one want to burst into the Doxology, doesn‚Äôt it? Praise God from whom all blessings flow! Praise Him all creatures here below. Praise Him above, ye Heavenly host. Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost! Amen.

For the one who‚Äôs lost sorrow is central and joy is peripheral. May God the Father draw you unto himself through the eternal Son, Jesus Christ, and give you the HS.
@GothicChessKing @mitchellvii Daniel Webster would not include ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù in his dictionary because he knew from God‚Äôs Word that nothing happened prior to recorded history. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Genesis 1:1 (which answers the question about the 3 things). Do you know now?
@GothicChessKing @mitchellvii It‚Äôs a hoax because everything that has been ‚Äúcarbon dated‚Äù is less than 10,000 years old. Read their own confessions and misnomers. They started with a false assumption that can‚Äôt be proven: millions of years. Daniel Webster would not include ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù in his dictionary.

@GothicChessKing @mitchellvii There‚Äôs one flawed statement here. There‚Äôs no such thing as billions of years. Death resulted from sin within a perfect environment created by God in the beginning about 6000 years ago. Begin with Genesis 4 and add up the years. It‚Äôs flawless - perfect, in fact.

@SHP1972 @JW_Branding @SteveScalise @GodsGrace57 Romans 5:7-8 KJV	[7] For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. [8] But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. What love! What grace! What perfect character!
@SHP1972 @JW_Branding @SteveScalise @GodsGrace57 He restored to us all that was lost by original sin in the garden of Eden, in Genesis 3. Man rebelled against God through disobedience, yet God gave His only begotten (not created) Son to redeem us from the fall. We will never outgrow Him or the wondrous works He hath done.
@SHP1972 @JW_Branding @SteveScalise @GodsGrace57 We, on the other hand, desperately need Him. He has given us life and all that is necessary to sustain it. Further, Jesus Christ is the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world, Who, at a point in time, became a man and suffered and died for man the creature‚Äôs sin.
@SHP1972 @JW_Branding @SteveScalise @GodsGrace57 He is the only entity whose reason for being is found within Himself. All others, by contrast, find their reason for being outside of themselves. He is so perfect that He necessarily exists. Conclusion? We were created by Him and for Him. He is self-sufficient, without need.

@kathygriffin 1 John 2:16-17	[16] For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. [17] And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority Not imposing anything on anybody. That was a personal invitation. It comes with irresistible grace by the Holy Spirit. Only Satan could convince you otherwise or provoke you to scoff at it.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority I have placed my faith in the completed work of Jesus Christ upon the cross and received forgiveness for my sin and eternal life. Won‚Äôt you accept His redeeming love for yourself? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather be leading people into the Way of Life instead of what you‚Äôre doing now?
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority How can you have peace, perpetuating such a lie? Is it not because you have no conscience toward God or His Holy Word, or His Pure Heart? He is utterly perfect and we have fallen into total depravity. Yet He sent His Son to die in our place so we might have forgiveness of sin.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority Yes. Have you not read, ‚ÄúThou shalt not commit adultery.‚Äù from Exodus 20:14, or ‚ÄúFlee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.‚Äù from 1 Corinthians 6:18? God has graciously blessed us with truth.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh LOVE America! And they intend to uphold the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, denying evil doers the chance to STEAL them, or even pervert them in ANY way. America - love her or leave her. But, DON‚ÄôT KILL HER!!
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority And may goodness, holiness, and righteousness win! God bless America! May she win again- and again. Remember how empty those words sounded when Hillary and Barry said them? That‚Äôs because THEY WERE! But Donald Trump means them.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority The GOP is on the side of right. Please consider and vote right. Proverbs 14:34-35	[34] Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people. [35] The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority Stop perpetuating LIES! That‚Äôs the work of the devil. John 10:10 	[10] The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority Take personal responsibility for your body and keep your hands off your child‚Äôs body, and every American will have the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. The GOP stands firmly against you TAKING that from anyone, even your own posterity.
@RevolutionNurse @HoldTheMajority What lunacy!! Just say no to illicit sex, which comes through the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. Then the vaginas will be BACK under personal control, where they belong. It‚Äôs never right to murder your own child - what perverted evil corruption!

@Skepacabra @LiveAction @michellemalkin The devil never wants us to engage in cognitive, rational, critical thinking during which time the Spirit of God works in the heart and mind, revealing all of the consequences of ignoring the Word of God, bringing the sinner to repentance and everlasting life. Think about it.
@Skepacabra @LiveAction @michellemalkin Murder is never by ‚Äúchoice‚Äù.  It‚Äôs the result of an emotional, irrational decision that‚Äôs driven by fear and coerced to be done in haste without thought by evil doers. The choice from the beginning has been to shun evil and turn to righteousness, to turn from darkness to light.
@Roahso @LiveAction @michellemalkin But there is no time or circumstance where God accepts murder as an option. There‚Äôs never a time where murder is not rooted in covetousness, which is idolatry. It‚Äôs as unchangeable as God Himself. Think about it.

@justrockythings @Melissa89431446 @AP Won‚Äôt you prayerfully read the Gospel of John and listen carefully for that ‚Äústill small voice‚Äù that will guide you into all truth and confirm in your spirit that you‚Äôre hearing truth? It‚Äôs life changing - no; more like life exchanging, a new birth. See John 3: 3-21; 16:13.
@justrockythings @Melissa89431446 @AP The anthrocentric sect is not Christianity at all, but rather what Christianity looks like after an idolatrous spirit carves on it, leaving nothing but a mutilation that is hardly recognizable to a believer - kind of like what man did to Christ during His last 3 days on Earth.
@justrockythings @Melissa89431446 @AP Mr Trump, while either not a Christian or a baby Christian, speaks out more strongly about the Christian faith, its tenets, freedom of religion, and our dependence on God than any president since Reagan - even if he has to solicit someone else to write his speech but he wants it.

@tonnabonnona @TJforTrump70461 Had no thoughts of myself.

@justrockythings @Melissa89431446 @AP There r 2 types of Christianity: christocentric &amp; anthrocentric. It seems that you presume me to be of the latter so will need to ask someone else in order to get the answer you‚Äôre seeking to provoke.

@ndavidovics @WilbertMatt35 @JamesHasson20 @CNN The antics of a SCOTUS run amuck back in Jan, 1973 took America down, not the road less travelled, but the forbidden road. Why can‚Äôt we turn back? Because the self-serving among us won‚Äôt allow it. Can you say, Brats? Who can live with them?
@ndavidovics @WilbertMatt35 @JamesHasson20 @CNN Seems the problem is that the unprincipled &amp; lawless (fornicators, adulterers, abusers) can now lawfully murder (to get rid of the evidence).

@BuckinghamLilia You must end this emotionally charged discussion or you and your simpletons willl end America as we know it. We love freedom and we must be able to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government. Go read up on history, talk with some wise men, and give yourself time to grow up.
@BuckinghamLilia Either move or unite with we Americans who LOVE the USA, LOVE the US Constitution with its 2nd Amendment, and LOVE FREEDOM. Read the #2A...the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. NO TRESPASSING or ENCROACHMENT can be tolerated. End of discussion.

@RosenforNevada @SenDeanHeller It‚Äôs a matter of outstanding principle that he‚Äôs siding with us and our fellow countrymen, though. Huh? God bless the legal, legitimate citizens of the good ole USA!! #MAGA
@Adaripp That‚Äôs a lie. Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. Colossians 2:8 KJV	Note: philosophy = false ideas; vain deceit = empty unprofitable lies.
@cwpick21 @Buzz0710 @DonaldJTrumpJr That‚Äôs right, because it‚Äôs the way of love. Read Psalm 1. Then memorize it and meditate upon it until the Holy Spirit helps you understand it to the point it‚Äôs message becomes an urgent matter. Then you‚Äôll understand the mind of VP Mike Pence. Gotta love a man like him. I do.
@cwpick21 @Buzz0710 @DonaldJTrumpJr Mike Pence is a man of principle who holds to the 2 highest commandments: to love God with all the heart, soul, mind, &amp; strength and to love his neighbor as himself. Why aren‚Äôt you asking why this is so out of reach for the LGBTUVWXYZ bunch?
