@BlakMachiavelli GOP supports white MALE privilege, particularly, &amp; does not want non-whites, women, LBGT ppl 2 have equal access to power.
The Right is terrified of even the thought of sharing power w/people of color. Equality means sharing power &amp; they fear being the minority.
The irony is that the right is so crazed over one black man in the White House. They can't imagine being a minority in a white-ruled world.
It saddens &amp; angers me that so many white, conservative Americans can't put themselves in anyone else shoes &amp; consider a new point of view.
