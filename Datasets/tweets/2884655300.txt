Illinois Democrats creating a shit hole, and people were worried about Cortez in New York?
Illinois Democrats just signed a new $15 dollar an hour bill for workers. Now there are no new businesses coming to Illinois, highest workman's comp rates, small businesses closing its doors but they will find the money for their pension funds.
Illinois Democrats just created a new tax on gun shops that will drive most small businesses under. They want any comments on social media to be forfeiture of your Gun License. Each gun will be taxed, but they will let diseased illegals spread infectious diseases to kids.
So the Governor of Illinois is creating a new tax on Seniors that want to sell their home and move to another State. Democratic Chicago wants to make sure the Politicians Pension Plans are fully funded at any cost.
