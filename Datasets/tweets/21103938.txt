@DisekoMogale @FrugalLocal Always strive to live below your means while you build economic stability &amp; wealth in prioritized areas; for me it’s real estate and my children’s education. Both will slowly bring to life a powerful future if I’m dedicated to hard work, sacrifice &amp; save for worst case scenarios.
@DisekoMogale @FrugalLocal So my advice underscores both of your guidance; be money wise &amp; unafraid to tell the world that you are working toward a goal. Ultimately, your goal will materialize because of purposeful efforts. You don’t need anyone’s permission to desire to carve out a better life or live it.
@DisekoMogale @FrugalLocal I’m now setting up academic trajectory. The investment into her brainpower is my top priority; definitely my parent’s daughter. If they could provide how they did as newly arrived immigrants, I have no excuse. Today at math enrichment, she was gleeful. I owe her brain so much.
@DisekoMogale @FrugalLocal I also made my babies partners in real estate investments as they were born to allow their contribution to grow exponentially during their youth. I deliberately calculated their partnership stake to their time on earth. Sounds crazy, but it helped me be strict with my savings.
@DisekoMogale @FrugalLocal The best example I learned from, my parents selflessness &amp; laser focus on living below your means while providing for elite educations for their children. I’m doing the same for my children. Sacrifices are made to accomplish real estate opportunities &amp; provide brighter future.
@stephonee @charlotteNwhite I’m proud of the entrepreneur and leader you are becoming. Being frugal and determined to lead a principled life isn’t easy. Sacrifices have to be made that are challenging but the rewards are worthwhile.
@stephonee Her little piggy bank in the last 3 years has collected more than I ever imagined but the real lesson lies in the self-reliance and character to grow wise financially. She’s setting up goals for charity this summer and we’ve begun discussing micro-loans for noteworthy causes.
@stephonee She realizes the responsibility to not always consume but obtain what’s needed. And if it’s a luxury or “want” then she works for it. She started working for my parents by helping through hard work but also earns a salary. She even tells her sister when she’s headed to her job.
@stephonee She loves collecting spare change she finds, even a penny in the street is a golden moment to save. I’ve also taught her about real estate and what it costs to repair when emergencies hit; we had a big one last month so our rainy day fund helped those we provide a roof for.
@stephonee I’ve loved teaching my toddler to save when I realized family members needed to learn money wise lessons. I showed her how she could economize, save energy so that she would be saving money while conserving natural resources &amp; when she turned 4, made her understand charity gifts.

@davie_mullis It’s a deal.
@davie_mullis Lastly, wishing you safe roads for all your travels as a truck driver. The US economy would be lost without hard working folks like you, those who work the rails like my brother &amp; honest families like my Ecuadorian immigrant parents who just like you, earn an honest living.
@davie_mullis @POTUS illegal border crossings have declined from 2000- 2018. But I’m a nerd who reads the heck out of this for my legal practice &amp; have stood in immigration court where stupidly broken immigration policy is applied as “law” - if you ever want to watch for yourself in LA let me know!
@davie_mullis Just like @potus you get key facts wrong. I’m up with an infant so I’ll tweet one fact check then have to jet off to mommy-land. Since 2007 when immigration peaked, there has been a downturn. In fact, visa overstays make up the larger part of “illegal immigration” since 2007
@davie_mullis https://t.co/9DWxPSmcaR 2013		And McCain in 2018 "anyone can become an American if they embrace our values. Anyone.”		Ps. Im the daughter of illegals. Naturalized citizens now but I’m an anchor baby. Brother is US Vet, all college educated kids &amp; I earned a JD. God bless America!
@davie_mullis I wanted a sincere answer, discourse is civil exchange not circuitous babble. Piecemeal immigration reform is what we’ll have to do to solve this problem long term. Shame McCain &amp; his gang couldnt get this done but he faced folks like you at every turn so it’s not a surprise.

@heatherbarr1 @arminkahelic @AppleSupport @Google Absolutely! The design of the implemented tool is to further the dominance between genders; I just wanted to point out that many women, some highly educated, of all walks of life here in the US are blind to various forms of abuse. And the modern ways of control may escape them.
@davie_mullis Liberals? I unequivocally stated I’m a conservative. So, do you think we are geniuses for exploiting the system? I’m genuinely curious. We can’t booming profits unless we take advantage of non- citizen labor market right? I’ll pay more for food for their legal status, will you?
@davie_mullis Was waiting for your proviso! Perfect example why Republicans like me can’t make sense of the old guard; I don’t get the glee for lack of understanding the Constitution. Instead, the lot of you just yell “socialism!” Or “build the wall” then walk away.
@heatherbarr1 @arminkahelic @AppleSupport @Google I’ve heard,“he loves me” or “isn’t it cute, he wants to know where I am!” “I can see where he is too!” as they rationalize this form of control &amp; say their permission is voluntary but in reality they’ve been groomed to give up autonomy by enabling someone to curtail their freedom
@heatherbarr1 @arminkahelic @AppleSupport @Google I know tons of American born women who allow their significant others to install a location app on their mobiles in exchange for the same location app to be installed on their husband/BFs/partners - seems issue in the US is control over your partner which is a form of abuse.

@davie_mullis https://t.co/v0p12UjBUW		Food prices will go up but I’m sure you are ok with that as long as they are “legal” right? Supply and demand of all your favorite grocery items right? They will supply and you can demand any item you want for the going rate. Bon Apetit!
@davie_mullis Then make sure you support the Agricultural Worker Program Act!  Farmworkers who have worked in ag for at least 100 days in past 2 years may earn “blue card” status allowing them to legally work in the USA &amp; path to green card.
@davie_mullis Every time I hear folks use the loaded words of “communism” &amp; “socialism” so haphazardly, it just makes me want to scream but instead I’ll urge you to learn more about our US Constitution &amp; the political &amp; social theories you claim we are on the brink of, which is patently false.
@davie_mullis A fair living wage for a person working to cover bare necessities is socialism which then morphs into communism? 🤣😂 Each hard working person deserves a life of dignity where housing, transportation, food, childcare, healthcare, &amp; payment of taxes can be handled by their income.

@charlotteNwhite @matilde_a_white How motionless!--not frozen seas	More motionless! and then	What joy awaits you, when the breeze	Hath found you out among the trees,	And calls you forth again!		This plot of orchard-ground is ours;	My trees they are, my Sister's flowers;

@charlotteNwhite @matilde_a_white For you are sunshine on my way.	Other people see you smile so sweet,	All are happier when you they meet.	Eyes are the windows to the soul,	No difficulties for you reaching your goal.	So sweet baby go on life's way,	Those Baby eyes have much to say.
@charlotteNwhite @matilde_a_white Baby Eyes, by George Bernard Shaw		Large Baby eyes smiling joyfully at me,	Baby eyes as brown as can be.	Two deep pools most innocent and bright,	To me are symbols of sheer delight.	May I greet you every single day? https://t.co/LT23tyrSJr

@WalkofFameStar @charlotteNwhite @ElCapitanThtre @DisneyStudios @TheAcademy @DolbyTheatre @PowellCraftLtd glad to share images of my little one’s favorite Cat dress. She’s worn various looks for the best days of her life. Her baby sister @matilde_a_white is also following in her gorgeous footsteps. Thanks for creating sweet clothes to accompany them through childhood.
@WalkofFameStar @charlotteNwhite @ElCapitanThtre @DisneyStudios @TheAcademy my 4yr old walked into El Capitan boldly “They think I’m a movie star, they’re waiting for me!” because we were last folks in for a film.

@RaiDeR53StRoNg @tombrokaw I’m fluent in Spanish so I’ve committed a great deal of time serving my community; which brings me back to the “assimilation” Mr. Brokaw mentioned. We are richer for who we are as a people &amp; if I dare say, more robust Americans because our gratitude to this nation is brand-new.
@RaiDeR53StRoNg @tombrokaw I’m just the lucky kid who was given an opportunity to earn a US law degree because of their selflessness. That privilege has enabled me to help others &amp; protect those less fortunate; something many people think Repubs wouldn’t take time to do, so again, it’s more than a label.
@RaiDeR53StRoNg @tombrokaw Trump GOP is more like a zombie version; all Repubs in my family uphold mantle &amp; devotion to US Constitution. We often staunchly criticize modern GOP. Think Fredrick Douglass, whose politics hardly resembled those of modern Repubs (just as Dems weren’t like today’s Dems).
@RaiDeR53StRoNg @tombrokaw No intrusion; quite difficult to summarize but their lens is more from the perspective of what their home country experience was, for a current example look at Venezuela’s struggles. Those who flee corrupt South American nations with government abuse champion democratic tenets.

@tombrokaw "Well, I don't know whether I want brown grandbabies." I mean, that's also a part of it. It's the intermarriage that is going on and the cultures that are conflicting with each other. - my brown babies @charlotteNwhite @matilde_a_white have blessed my Caucasian husband’s family.

@Gordon15PL @LoneWolfCountry @CNBC And major news which may shock you, I’m a Republican. US constitutional law is the greatest in the world. Instead of being ignorant of how it’s applied, try to protect it by ensuring we apply it as it was intended. #DueProcessForAll
@Gordon15PL @LoneWolfCountry @CNBC My girls are being taught Castilian spanish; a privilege their grandparents give by heritage because they honor their roots. I thank God my family broke immigration law to allow us the opportunity to the American Dream. These folks are asylum seekers, they’ve a right to apply.
@Gordon15PL @LoneWolfCountry @CNBC And for the record, I’m a birthright citizen. Our parents were undocumented and I’m also an anchor baby who helped my mom become a naturalized citizen. And in our family, 3 college grads, 1 JD, 1 Navy veteran and we are all proud Americans.
@Gordon15PL @LoneWolfCountry @CNBC Then change the Constitution and erase the concept of due process for all. Including you.
RT @HuffPost: “Welcome to the white man’s world,” a cop allegedly told a Latino teen as he beat the youth. https://t.co/sR9t6TTX2L
@LoneWolfCountry https://t.co/BXue4lQREZ		So @potus is mistaken by unequivocally stating they’re not allowed to apply/seek redress. You can’t deny people before they’ve even had a chance. It violates their due process. If they apply, then are denied, so be it. But they have a right to attempt.
@LoneWolfCountry @CNBC There is no such umbrella concept of jurisdiction; they have standing (right to access court) for their due process rights issue.
