RT @melrobbins: No one should "wear the pants" in your relationship. Everyone knows relationships work best when no one is wearing pants.
Also: please PLEASE ask before greeting someone else’s dog. Doesn’t matter if it’s a puppy or not. Especially coming from a dog mom whose kiddo is aggressive on leash.
A lot of dogs pick up a food allergy (normally either to chicken or grains). Eating a limited ingredient diet really helps with this (aka just higher quality food). Raw diet is best.
Don’t go to a vet for nutrition advice. 1. They only learn about brands really at vet school. 2. Most are sponsored by Hill’s or Science Diet (which aren’t really brands you want and they are super $$)
A couple of keys things I’ve learned: if you wouldn’t eat the same hamburger from McDonalds every day, don’t shop for dog food from Walmart. If you can find it at the grocery store, don’t feed it to your dog.
If acquiring dog, please learn how to dog. If not sure, consult a professional. Learning to train dogs is taking me over 80 hours to learn the basics and I feel like I’m not even scratching the surface of everything there is to know.
