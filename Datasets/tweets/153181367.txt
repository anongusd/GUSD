Cohen: "I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later."

And the discrediting of Cohen begins: GOP Ranking Member Jordan says the committee's first witness "Is going to prison in two months for...lying to Congress."

Northam has been asked at least twice about “coonman” knicname. He doesn’t explain it. Just says people gave it to him and he doesn’t know why.
Northam says he wants to stay in office to address racism. But in doing so he is dismissing the wishes of black leaders in the party urging him to step down.

Northam refusing to resign over racist photo is also keeping Lt Gov Justin Fairfax,  an African American,  from succeeding him in office.

This Barnes and Noble book event is kind of a town hall for Schultz. Questions submitted from audience by note card. Second question is, what is your position on Syria?

Japanese Prime Minister Abe speaking now here at Davos, saying he wants the G20 submit in Japan later this year to establish "a new track for looking at data governance."
And final question for Pompeo: When will the shutdown be over? He says he hopes soon. “Political fights in the US are a time honored tradition,” he jokes.
Pompeo response: “sometimes leadership, in asking tough questions, makes people concerned...but it’s necessary to take on challenges.”
Question from Davos moderator to Pompeo: “is America isolated?”
Pompeo on Russia: “we are not doomed to a Cold War rivalry...we are not destined to be antagonists.” But says Russia must change its behavior. Cites influence campaigns and aggressive in Ukraine.
No news from Pompeo on where NK meeting will be held. Notes pause in middle and nuke test a positive development but there are “many steps left.” Says end of February will be a good marker of progress.
Pompeo says global pattern of disruption is a positive development. But that our “beautiful coalitions” are paramount.
Pompeo cites Brexit, election of Macron and Trump to argue the question people are asking is, “is economic globalism really good for me?”
Pompeo joins Davos via video, noting it’s colder in DC than in Switzerland https://t.co/lG1Y3A1Dmr
But visions are different: Bolsonaro interested in “better integrating” Brazil into the world.
Bolsonaro sounding like Trump’s address here last year, essentially declaring Brazil open for business. Pushing for lower taxes and streamlining regs, but also eliminating “unfair trade.”

"I really believe in the importance of the press...and I look forward to having a great relationship with all of you," Gillbrand says at her first press conference since announcing her exploratory committee.
"I know a lot of people who love and respect him, and I'm one of them," Gillibrand says of Joe Biden.
Some 2020 candidates have been reluctant to mention Trump by name. Gillibrand not holding back in her first appearance since announcing exploratory, saying Trump "has chosen to tear people apart."

But Warren's economic pitch seemed appealing to many voters I spoke with. "It reminds us of when we were growing up," one Des Moines retiree told me. "It's the Democratic Party getting back to its roots," said his wife. Both were Bernie backers.
Warren's approach to DJT gets varied reviews: "She is not going to take any crap from Trump," one voter told me. "She's being portrayed in the right wing media as this wild-eyed liberal," said another. And the woman in Sioux City who said why give DJT" more fodder to be a bully?"

The shutdown was on the minds of many voters I talked to at Warren events in Iowa. Some brought it up in the larger context of wanting things to calm down in DC. For others it was more personal, including one couple I spoke with who worked for a federal credit union.
Beyoncé’s “Love on top” is part of Warren’s campaign track here tonight. Also, the first song my husband and I danced to at our wedding. So I’m digging it.
Crowd numbers for Warren in Des Moines: 725 inside, and 300 outside, the campaign says.
"Yeah it's hard. But damn. A lot of things are hard," Warren says.
Will you roll back Donald Trump's tax bill? "For the billionaires and the big corporations, you bet!" Warren says.
"I’m not re-litigating 2016," Warren says, asked about Clinton-Sanders and how to make a fairer primary process.
"Here's the deal. Let's really wonk out for a minute here," Warren says to a question about affordable housing.
The next questioner says she is from Kansas and drove three hours to be at the Des Moines event.
Warren joked to the questioner, "Do you have anyone in mind?" But she is continuing to not mention Trump by name.
Warren's response: "We gotta stay focused on what matters to us. And what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance."
Second question from audience: "How do you debate someone who doesn't operate in civility or facts?"
First question at Des Moines event is about protecting the separation of church and state. Warren brings up Hobby Lobby case. "We have to fight back on this."

@ZcohenCNN Right. Falwell's take: "You don’t choose a president based on how good they are; you choose a president based on what their policies are."
But no mention of plans to use legislative tools to hold POTUS to account. Only: " I will act as I would with any president, in or out of my party: I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not."
Romney defines it this way: "I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions."

Per filing, here is how Cohen has helped Mueller	-Gave info about his own contacts w/ Russian interests, and about attempts of Russian nationals to reach the campaign.	-Gave info concerning "discrete Russia-related matters"	-Contact with White House	-Admitting to false statements
Cohen has met with the special counsel 7 times, according to the court filing.
"His motivation to do so was not borne from naiveté, carelessness, misplaced loyalty, or political ideology. Rather, these were knowing and calculated acts – acts Cohen executed in order to profit personally, build his own power, and enhance his level of influence."
"Cohen deceived the voting public by hiding alleged facts that he believed would have had a substantial effect on the election," federal prosecutors say.
Reminder: This is not from the special counsel. It's the southern district of New York. https://t.co/HPVWV7PkWG
Federal prosecutors office "respectfully requests that this Court impose a	substantial term of imprisonment" for Cohen.

ALSO: 73% say healthcare is top issue for them. https://t.co/At11Nh8OM5

RT @kasie: to be clear Cruz also led the push to *shut down the government* over this https://t.co/Mo4OJqfTq5
Cruz, who lead the charge to repeal Obamacare, says in his closing argument he wants to save protections for pre existing conditions.
On question of civility, Cruz says: "If we had impeachment next year, we'd see utter chaos...Washington would be consumed by partisan investigations. That's not civility."
Cruz leaning into Trump's "mob" theme: "There is an anger and there is a rage on the far left...the images of the left wing mob beating on the doors of the Supreme Court "
Cruz is really playing up the tax bill. But denies that it adds to the deficit.
Cruz touts his ability to work with POTUS, particularly on issues like trade. "I'm able to work with President Trump and make the case to President Trump," Cruz says. "Congressman O'Rourke is not able to work with President Trump." https://t.co/Cx9O1DgVSS
Cruz invokes the specter of impeachment as a hit on O'Rourke: "With Congressman O'Rouke leading the way two years of a partisan circus..."
Beto evokes Trump's nickname of Cruz, a week before POTUS comes to Texas: "He's dishonest. It's why the president called him lyin' Ted. And it stuck because it's true."
SCOTUS and TXsen: "I was proud to help lead the effort to confirm Justice Kavanaugh," Cruz says at debate, accusing Beto of wanting to see "left wing judicial activists."

This is part of our new ongoing series called "Stump of Approval," where we'll be looking at the impact of party leaders' support in the midterms. https://t.co/DJOIrZ9HCl
One key question for campaigns is how much Dem opposition is built in v. how much Trump's campaigning further fuels it? Some GOP operatives argue the former, saying in close races, Trump can be the difference maker. But risk is driving away indies. In OH-12 Kasich lent some cred.
But since Trump dominates everything, attempts to deploy him strategically may prove futile. As @jtuckermartin puts it: “It's not like Trump is a precision bomb; he's like an earthquake. The impact extends far beyond the epicenter." https://t.co/6IOW0wNk8n

The executive order directs the AG to request a modification to the Flores settlement, the court order that puts limits on detaining children. There is now the question of whether this provision invites court challenges.
Trump's executive order allows DHS to "maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminal improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members."
@sahilkapur Yeah right, Sahil.

@markknoller Yes, I noted the congresswoman's presence in that tweet.
Look at this table: All White Men. Only one woman lawmaker present, not pictured. https://t.co/mNuu8LWqJl
OK just saw official list, and ONLY ONE WOMAN LAWMAKER WAS IN THE ROOM at the White House meeting with the president. Rep. Liz Cheney. https://t.co/jcM5sjnfND
Here are the dynamics POTUS was facing this morning, before announcing executive order: members of his own party scrambling to find legislative fixes and increasingly fearful of midterm election backlash, with no clear consensus on policy, strategy. https://t.co/NcDtinv56D
"Those images affect everybody," Trump says of images at the border.
Asking honestly, because I can't see everyone: Is there only one woman lawmaker in this room with the president?
"If you're weak...the country is going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you're strong, you don't have any heart....perhaps I'd rather be strong, but that's a tough dilemma," Trump says to GOP lawmakers.
@noonanjo Gosh I was thinking the same exact thing while writing today. Yes please!
White House said they won’t do this. But notable that the chair of the GOP Senate’s campaign arm has signed on: https://t.co/0AyOxi7PEj
Cornyn said he talked to the White House yesterday and found "they don't have a unified position." So "what we're trying to do is demonstrate one possible solution and see if we can get the consensus we need."
White House: Congress needs to fix entire immigration system.	McConnell: in order to fix this problem, you can't fix all the problems....obviously it would need to be a narrow agreement."	Schumer: "Mr President, you alone can fix it."

Recall that at rally for Blackburn in TN, Trump called Pelosi an "MS-13 lover." And at tax reform event in WV, he literally threw out the script and instead riffed on immigration. https://t.co/OAFGq66XKQ https://t.co/OVJrW34u4q
Earlier this month, I wrote about Trump and GOP Senate candidates pushing culture wars more than tax cuts after NFL flap. But it also pertains to immigration: https://t.co/OAFGq66XKQ

Trump admin arguing that its policy is to prevent smugglers bringing kids in. But Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman, who has been a leading advocate against human trafficking, says Trump policy puts kids more at risk.

In a letter to the AG, Yoder writes: "Immediately removing children from their parents is too harsh a penalty, especially given the dangerous circumstances some of these families are fleeing...separating families should not occur." https://t.co/yCFH9aBbZG

How does this square? In Fox interview, Mercedes Schlapp says Democrats need to come aboard to end  "legal loopholes" that "are causing family separations." But then says "what you’re seeing is like an MS-13 gang member walking in with a one year old."
Today’s weather in DC can best be described as the kind that reveals your hair in its natural state is actually curly and frizzy.
“The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” Trump says in the East Room, per pool.

@DavidMDrucker @kkondik @JohnJHarwood Good point. Republicans argue that they met many GOP targets in 2017 but that Dem turnout vastly over performed and indies switched. Which goes point about how culture wars could hurt, by revving up Dems and turning indies.
@kkondik @DavidMDrucker @JohnJHarwood I'm inclined to agree with Kyle here, as I think some of the culture/social stuff has a broader appeal among Republicans, even those in the suburbs, than we often realize.
On that latter point: You have a former Republican FBI director questioning a GOP POTUS's moral fitness for office, but many Democrats don't find him all that compelling. "The way he infused politics in both investigations, [voters] will not see him as the moral authority."

Trump says he didn't want to include ANWR in tax bill, then heard that "No president could get it done..as soon as I heard that I said, put that back in the bill quickly. "
On CNN, Kellyanne Conway says Trump firing Comey was on recommendation from Rosenstein. Recall in interview with NBC after firing, Trump said he was going to fire him anyway, and said the “Russia thing” was on his mind.
“This president does not reflect the values of this country,” Comey says.
“I’m thinking it’s crazy to fire me” while investigating Russian interference and possible connections to Trump campaign, Comey says.

That's not to say, as noted in the story, that Republicans don't think Trump helped in PA-18 by campaigning for Saccone. And the margin is still razor thin. NRCC also notes that turnout was on par with Dems. But point is that Republicans can't rely  on it. https://t.co/R3qV55BUGr

The second sentence might be the distinction between now and last time. In 2013, Republicans were blamed by public for shutting down government. But then they won the Senate the following year. https://t.co/9rcR7iZOtt
Graham says that if the government shuts down, "we should all get kicked out."
"The president I saw on Tuesday is the guy I play golf with," Graham says.
Heyo--"I don't think the president is well-served by his staff," Graham says, arguing they "missed the mark." Asked about COS, says: "General Kelly is a fine man, but he's also part of the staff."
Graham now heaping praise on Dick Durbin, then says "Mr. President...Close this deal."
"I don't know how this movie ends, but you're going to be taken care of," Graham says of DACA recipients.
"If the president is watching" Graham says, facing the camera in the hearing room.
Graham's line of questioning focusing on how the president could have changed course from open to bipartisan plan at 10 am to shitholes by noon.
"He said he was open to it, absolutely," Nielson tells Graham about Trump and comprehensive immigration reform.

"What I want you to know is that even today, even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it's all been worth it," Franken says.
"I may be resigning my seat, but I'm not giving up my voice," Franken says.
"Nothing I have done as a senator--nothing--has brought dishonor on this institution," Franken says.
"I am proud that during my time in the Senate I have used my power to be a champion of women," Franken says. "I know who I really am."
"All women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously," Franken says. But adds: "Some of the allegations are simply not true."
"Then the conversation turned to me," Franken says from the Senate floor.
@daveweigel @JoePerticone Yes and even then he doesn’t always engage in the hallway. I once said, “can I ask you a question about health care” and he said “yeah but not now” and took off.

Thinking a lot about speeches yesterday by formers presidents Bush and Obama. Current administration is personal for both....
It’s worthy to discuss/debate Rep. Wilson’s role in politicization of this issue. But going after her for her outfits? Degrading.
Kelly took pains to explain the context of the call and the intention, and called for the end of mixing gold star families and politics.

This keeps sticking out to me, the fact that Kelly said he advised the president not to make the calls. https://t.co/AReYGXbnwe
Kelly's reluctance to spotlight himself on display. When thanked for service by reporter, he encouraged him to just get to the question.
If the president had described the sittuation the way Kelly did (instead, said he didn't say it), wonder how different the story would be
Kelly says he went to Arlington yesterday for an hour and a half. "Walked among the stones," he said.
"I was stunned and broken-hearted" at Rep. Wilson's comments, Kelly says.
Kelly says he told Trump not all presidents make calls to everyone.
Kelly says he had recommended POTUS not make calls to families of the fallen.

Asked whether POTUS would sign a clean DACA bill, Sanders says Trump wants to include broader immigration reforms
Trump statement continued: "We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans."
Trump did not announce DACA decision in person. Released statement: "legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws."
Per @POTUS statement on DACA: "all existing work permits will be honored until their date of expiration up to two full years from today."

RT @HolmesJosh: The president just erased yesterday's speech and is now back to Saturday's position on Charlottesville. Unbelievable.
There are two sides to the story, Trump says.
Trump is unleashed here in New York...
"Are we going to take down statues of George Washington? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? "
"I think there is blame on both sides," Trump says.
"I've condemned neo nazis...but not all of those people were neo nazis...they wanted to protest taking down of the statue," Trump says
This press conference feels like the last one Trump had here at Trump Tower...
"What about the alt-left?...they came charging with clubs in their hands." Trump says.
!!--&gt; "I like Mr Bannon...but he came on very late. I like him...he's not a racist. But we'll see what happens with Mr Bannon."
"I couldn't have made the statement sooner because I didn't know all of the facts," Trump says.
Trump has been quick to comment on things before without complete facts. https://t.co/Epf1ael6of
Trump says he waited to give more forceful statement because he "wanted to know the facts."
"Not taking their jobs seriously" Trump says of CEOs resigning from council, says their companies are making jobs overseas.
