@CarmichaelDave Right, that's what happens if your candidate is no better than the other to get the majority of the votes and thus win the Electoral votes for that state.  Throughout history there have only been 2 instances where the person with the most votes didn't win so it must be working
@CarmichaelDave Not true, that's why California gets 55 Electoral votes and Montana and the Dakota's get 3 each.  The votes clearly matter....what's not to get?
@CarmichaelDave It's giving ALL the people a say, not just the minority.  If you eliminate the EC you will have Presidential candidates campaign in the 10 largest cities ONLY...states will never see a politician ever come to their state or put forth any legislation to help them.  Why would they?

@Kelsey__Anne__ @SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing @LobsterFromME LOL, touche'  Would just rather see the Senator a bit more focused on real issues
@SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing @LobsterFromME Glad to see you're really focused on the IMPORTANT issues for Americans.
@MaxineWaters No madam, working to ENFORCE THE LAW which the Obama administration refused to do.
@MaxineWaters You are such a racist POS, just go away already.  #Senile #SwampDenizen #AllLivesMatter
@billoreilly @LOYALtoTRUMP Bill they aren't going to cooperate on ANYTHING to do with @POTUS I am stunned to hear so many voices on the right that think they will
@MaxineWaters You are a racist and do not belong in office.
@MaxineWaters You are one of the most disgusting people on this planet and a disgrace to the US Congress. The people of your District need to vote you out
@davidaxelrod @POTUS One of the dumbest comments I've seen all year.  Go back to smashing hard drives with all your crooked DEM friends...
How "chummy" that Schumer and Pelosi now want to "work with Repub's after ramming this crappy bill down their throats.  #VoteThemAllOut
@SenJohnMcCain Please explain all of those votes to repeal the ACA while Obama was president. You and a liar, sham and phony  #Retire #Swamp
@SenatorCollins Just switch over already...been voting with Dem's your whole life.  You voted to repeal ACA under Obama because you knew it was a safe vote
#PrimaryThemOut https://t.co/fj7APi1app

@DLoesch @usedcars1995 Amen @DLoesch the GOP is going to suffer HUGE losses in 2018 and 2020 if they can't remove their heads from their butts... #DrainTheSwamp
@SenFeinstein Senator, stop lying to the American people...it is fear-mongering like this that keeps anything positive from being done to fix healthcare
SOMEONE explain to me how/why the 7 GOP senators who voted to repeal the ACA under Obama can now vote no??  #TermLimits #PrimaryThem
@SteveScalise Glad to hear you're on the mend.  Will keep you in our prayers and hope to see you back raising hell real soon...God Bless!
Just wondering where the MSM, Lib's and Feminists were when that POS Madison slurred Press Sec SHSanders?  No outrage, no boycotts #Phonies
@Hellfire_Helen @SenatorDurbin @SenateGOP @GOP People are in #12step programs BECAUSE of Dem policies.
@Hellfire_Helen @SenatorDurbin @SenateGOP The ACA is failing in almost every state.  Costs are through the roof, jobs have been killed and doctor choices are severely limited.
@SenatorDurbin @SenateGOP Stop lying to the American people...we deserve better.  Obamacare has gutted healthcare in the US and you voted for it #Shame #GoAwayAlready
Anyone else see the total hypocrisy of ALL the politicians on the left (and some on the right) who bitch about Trump tweeting but do more?
@TomiLahren Keep up the great work, we love you out here in nutty California!!
@NancyPelosi So ur saying the generals and leaders in the Defense Department that supported this also lack loyalty? #TroopsNotTrans #MAGA #SwampDrain
@NancyPelosi @POTUS Pretty funny to hear the words honor, decency and national security from the mouth of a woman who offers none of this and supported Hillary
So John McCain says don't listen to the voices on the radio because they don't want to get anything done for us.  So you mean like Congress?
@EyreCleo @RobbTruthe @KeithOlbermann Don't waste your time on Keith, he has been a lost soul (on top of being #BatShitCrazy) for years...

@mjbrezinski @cmd6022 @ReavesCarmen @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @MaxineWaters @alfranken Yes I know but unlike you I like to hear differing opinions..at least when they aren't regurgitating hateful rhetoric and DNC talking points
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @MaxineWaters @alfranken Someone who bashes a person for being a Christian and then quotes Proverbs...you truly are a lunatic.  Enjoy your miserable, angry life
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @MaxineWaters @alfranken Who threatened you??  You are seriously delusional....go away already
@ReavesCarmen @mjbrezinski @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @MaxineWaters @alfranken Don't insult the bulldog...
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain I never said Trump wasn't thin-skinned, he is....so what?
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @BarackObama See, typical you have to go with the racist card....you are a disgusting human
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain @MaxineWaters @alfranken Just used THEIR OWN WORDS...they crucified themselves.  Again, try reading...
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain I don' think the country felt "saved" at all...more like shafted by a slick-talking, thin-skinned community organizer in over his head
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain What about all the people that lost jobs, went on welfare/food stamps, lost their Dr., and healthcare provider during King Obama's terms?
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain LOL, OK....keep holding on to that.  I think you're an angry bitter woman and hope you find some happiness living in Canada or Venezuela
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain You mean Mrs. "For the first time in my life I'm proud of my country..." Yeah, she was classy
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain That's the problems with you lib's, intolerance of others opinions and EVERYTHING is about money, greed and race.  Just a tired argument
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Colluding with Russians...continue with the inane lib-tard talking points
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain LOL, stalk much?  Clearly you can only read scripted lines and don't understand common English...
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain More typical intolerant lib bullshit...continue having a miserable life and enjoy the next 7+ years of Trump as President
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Right...only a laughingstock when our CIF bows to other leaders like Obummer
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain LOL, Trump has been in office 7 months.
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain See, you ask for facts and then can't handle them....
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Innocent people there aren't being bombed like before...the whole region probably won't ever calm down..cut military budget in half?? Lunacy
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Supreme Court upheld prime parts 9-0 which just shows how stupid the circuit rulings were...racist? Vetting of 7 Muslim countries out of 55
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Ending of Obama overregulation, expanded oil drilling,
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Restoring American world standing, bringing jobs back from overseas, Stock Market up, unemployment down, Justice Dept that  enforces law
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Keystone Pipeline, Neil Gorsuch, No Paris Treaty, Enhanced Border Security, Travel Ban, Syria Bombing

@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Again, Lib's have their own set of "facts/talking points" they continuously spew out with no link to reality...I choose to not waste my time
@ReavesCarmen @mjbrezinski @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain She's a liberal, it's in their DNA
@mjbrezinski @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Gives you a hard on...that's YOUR response?  Seriously?
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Impossible to argue "facts" when all liberals do is spew the same BS over and over and claim it as fact.  NOTHING you have stated is fact..
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Just because you regurgitate a bunch of lib talking points do not make them facts...
@mjbrezinski @ReavesCarmen @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain Wow, nice comeback...yes I feel really burned.
@mjbrezinski @cmd6022 @NancyPelosi @SenJohnMcCain When have I EVER said I sold my soul to Trump?  Try paying attention...just happy to have a president who lifts up the country
