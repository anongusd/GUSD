My statement on today‚Äôs Senate vote to send Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court: https://t.co/XkroSl74mS
The American people deserve more information, not less, when we are talking about a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. (4/4)
The Trump Administration purposely limited the scope of the investigation, excluding not just Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford, but several other key witnesses from being interviewed. (3/4)
While I have the upmost respect for the men and women of the FBI, it is clear that the restrictions placed on the FBI by the Trump administration did not allow for a proper or credible investigation. (2/4)
I believe any credible and thorough FBI investigation should include interviews with the two key witnesses ‚Äì Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.  That did not happen. (1/4)

This rushed process shows, yet again, that Senate Republicans will continue to place politics and party over people. We need a Supreme Court that believes survivors and that serves justice to all - not a select, privileged few.
When stories such as Dr. Ford's aren't thoroughly investigated it serves as a chilling message to the next generation: the voices of girls, women, and sexual assault survivors don't matter.
Senate Republicans claimed they believed her, yet by rushing this confirmation process forward, their actions show what we suspected all along: they just don't care.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony was brave and I was inspired by her willingness to come forward and share her story. #BelieveSurvivors

RT @ElderCareTeam: Q6: How has the Older Americans Act impacted you? Share your story #WeAreOAA #OAM15
Congress can reduce barriers to care by passing legislation like Home Health Planning Improvement Act. #WeAreOAA #OAM15
@janschakowsky myself &amp; 31 colleagues sent this letter to LHHS Approps supporting funding http://t.co/9DdGlQMrMZ #OAM15
2nd way Congress can support older adults--increase funding for Older Americans Act programs. #WeAreOAA #OAM15
#1 way Congress can support older adults? Reauthorize the Older Americans Act! #WeAreOAA #OAM15
Without reauthorization, these vital programs are subject to budget cuts ‚Äî we need to invest more, not less! #WeAreOAA
OAA would strengthen landmark legislation originally passed in 1965, overdue for reauthorization since 2011. #WeAreOAA
10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 each and every day. Reauthorizing OAA will ensure that these programs are available. #WeAreOAA
#OAA offers a wide range of programs from home delivered meals to employment training #WeAreOAA #OAM15
This year marks the 50th anniversary of #OAA! This landmark act helps older Americans to remain &amp; thrive in their communities. #WeAreOAA
Ensuring family #caregivers have resources to care for aging loved ones is a centerpiece of #OAA #WeAreOAA #OAM15
In California alone family #caregivers provided more than 3.85 billion hours of unpaid care valued at $47 billion #WeAreOAA #OAM15
We are committed to ensuring Americans are able to enjoy the dignified and secure retirement they have earned and deserve #WeAreOAA
It‚Äôs true! 360,000 older adults stay active in their community by volunteering. #WeAreOAA
Here‚Äôs a video from me &amp; @janschakowsky Seniors Task Force co-chairs on the importance of #OAM15 #WeAreOAA http://t.co/ZkykBDBHIo
