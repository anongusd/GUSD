5. #trains are at least 3 feet wider than the tracks on both sides -- it's never #safe to stop closer than 15 feet from rails. And
4. a #train can't stop for you! It can take more than a mile to stop a train -- 18 football üèà¬†fields -- even after emergency brakes. Also,
3. 95% of all rail-related deaths involve drivers going through a crossing or a person on the tracks üõ§. So, a few tips to remember:
