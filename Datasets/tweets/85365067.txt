.@ArlingtonNatl will be opening up another survey within the next few weeks that will be presented to @SecArmy and then will have further discussions with Congress.
.@RepMikeCoffman, a #military retiree, states he wants @ArlingtonNatl preserved especially for those killed in action.
.@ArlingtonNatl states they can serve our current population of veterans; however, they cannot serve future veterans past the 2040's.
.@ArlingtonNatl states that even with sectioning off a section for #MOH recipients, there still would not be enough room for future veterans.
.@ArlingtonNatl wants to make sure they maintain the look and feel of the cemetery to honor veterans and #milfams
.@RepMikeCoffman questions whether there is room for expansion above ground for #Veterans to be buried.
.@RepMikeCoffman asks if @ArlingtonNatl and @USArmy believe they have done everything in their ability to allow for veterans to be buried at @ArlingtonNatl. @ArlingtonNatl states they look at all considerations in order to serve the nation's #veterans.
.@USArmy states we need more public dialogue and surveys before we limit eligibility at @ArlingtonNatl
.@VFWHQ believes that land expansion to an annex could be maintained to the same level as @ArlingtonNatl
.@RepMikeCoffman questions what a timeline should be for eligibility criteria changes. @VFWHQ and @AirForceAssoc state that we need to know what those changes are and all other options should be exhausted before a decision can be made
RT @ArlingtonNatl: Also speaking are representatives from the @AirForceAssoc, the @AmericanLegion , the @MilitaryOfficer, and @VFWHQ.
RT @JamesNaughton15: Oh, hey Forrest @MilitaryOfficer https://t.co/qmADb6HXPM
.@RepDonBacon believes that we should reserve a specific space for #MedalOfHonor recipients, #PurpleHeart recipients, and those killed in action.

.@RepMikeCoffman asks the testifiers for their opinion of current burial reservations. @AmericanLegion and @VFWHQ have no stance, however @MilitaryOfficer and @usairforce are open to preserving them.
.@MilitaryOfficer survey and numbers represents that of our members. Burial at @ArlingtonNatl should not be limited to just that of retirees.
.@RepMikeCoffman questions why the @MilitaryOfficer survey numbers are different from @USArmy.
.@AirForceAssoc agrees with @AmericanLegion, @VFWHQ, and @MilitaryOfficer in that expansion should be explored before limiting eligibility.
.@VFWHQ proposes expanding to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and utilizing some 80 acres of unused land at the location.
.@VFWHQ originally was opposed to eligibility restrictions, but they are now considering restricting eligibility to those who have served for 24 months, aside from POWs, MOH recipients, and those killed in action.
.@AmericanLegion agrees with the option of expansion of @ArlingtonNatl
"If [eligibility restrictions are desired,] there should at a minimum be a reinstatement of a reservation system for plots and columbarium spaces to allow those who already have made plans to have their wishes honored," states Forrest Allen.
The Advisory Committee on Arlington National Cemetery identified two options for @ArlingtonNatl: expansion or limiting eligibility.
"With finite years of capacity for new burials remaining at Arlington National Cemetery, it is important to maintain the dignity of burial at the cemetery, respect end-of-life plans for the currently eligible veteran population"
The hearing has now started. @RepMikeCoffman gives opening remarks, and stresses the importance of preserving @ArlingtonNatl.
The hearing before House Armed Services Committee has been delayed. We will update our followers when we have more information.

Fun fact: all four Vice Chiefs of the services are aviators.
These sea walls are incredibly expensive, time consuming, and cause many traffic issues.
.@JimInhofe questions how this year's weather issues affect military base #Infrastructure. @USMC is concerned they will have to use funds to build sea walls to prevent degradation of bases.
.@timkaine wants to know if there is new surface warfare training - Admiral Moran says they are currently evaluating and altering training programs in San Diego
Admiral William Moran states @USNavy are analyzing bridge and radar configuration, previous completed investigations of other mishaps, policy, etc. and they are presenting a quarterly report to #congress
.@timkaine addresses the @USNavy ship collisions this past year
.@JimInhofe questions the services operational dwell time and how they can gain readiness during deployment trainings
.@usairforce testing new prototypes for #intelligent airplanes, new gps systems, and advancing technology
For @USMC, #CyberSecurity and new equipment are a part of budget for this year

.@VCSA_PAO states that over 25% of recruits to @USArmy are unfit
.@USNavy Admiral William F. Moran agrees that shipyards need to be updated and invested in
.@timkaine questions @USNavy shipyard optimization plans.
.@USMC General Glenn M. Walters would like possible congressional permission for flexibility to spend 2018 funds into 2019, but states that they do have the ability to spend budget 5 months into fiscal year
@JimInhofe is concerned we are 5 months into FY2018 and the services won't be able to get necessary authorizations to spend funds.
General Stephen W. Wilson, USAF, says @usairforce is 2,000 pilots short
.@usairforce needs 3,300 airmen per year, for the next 5 years
@VCSA_PAO and @USNavy Admiral William Moran thank congress for approving budget that will help combat readiness issues
.@timkaine brings to light how #climatechange causes infrastructure issues to a military bases
Personnel shortages are a common problem for the branches and prevent readiness according to @timkaine
