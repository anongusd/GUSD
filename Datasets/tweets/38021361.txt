We have a prior example of what happens when you move the mound back: 1893.  The short term effects on pitching careers were ugly, &amp; scoring got massively out of control. NL runs per game (ERA):		1891: 5.54 (3.34)	1892: 5.09 (3.28)	1893: 6.57 (4.66)	1894: 7.38 (5.33)

@craigcalcaterra @philipaklein Opposing policies you support just to make a rhetorical point is silly. 		My own view, which I've had to explain ad infinitum to his fans, is that there was no single reason to go Never Trump - it was, as these things always are, an accumulation of a multitude of factors.
@craigcalcaterra @philipaklein Most of the people using the term did not expect him to win, and those who thought it possible did not expect him to govern in a way that a conservative would even consider supporting him later.		It was a hashtag hastily dropped into a primary fight.
@MelissaTweets @philipaklein Well, the people adopting the term were never an organized or cohesive group. I think Phil's is the understanding of most of the people in my circles: the movement conservatives, the Christian social conservatives, the legal conservatives.
@philipaklein Of course, if you were Never Trump in 2016, you should still consider the reasons why to be important after that. But by 2020, if he's still on the field, the decision will factor in 4 years in office of additional information.
@LoganDobson The interesting question is Brown vs Kasich

10. We ought to have stronger parties that control their own message &amp; live &amp; die by how that message sells in November. This is a step in that direction, one I'd be happy to see Republicans imitate.
9. Now, is it irresistibly amusing to poke some fun at Democrats for wanting their primary to be a walled garden free of tough questions from the outside? Sure. It punctures some of their favorite pretensions. But at the end of the day, that's what the general election is for.
@brianros1 Smoke-filled rooms gave us Abe Lincoln, cable TV and open primaries gave us Donald Trump. I'm not sure that's progress.
8. The only fairness issue that matters in picking a primary moderator is having somebody who isn't on the team of one *primary* candidate over another. That was where CNN had problems with Donna Brazile. So the focus should be on honest brokers within the party.
@JohnEkdahl That was a general election debate.
7. If the Democrats want their debates to be moderated entirely by left-wing activists and liberal pundits, go ahead. The whole point is to let the party's voters pick somebody they want to represent them. Fairness to the opposing party is no part of that.
6. A party definitely loses something by shutting out non-friendly moderators (and the Fox moderators the Democrats are booting are hardly Sean Hannity). But primary debates are for the primary voters. If only Republicans were as aggressive in defending that as Democrats.
5. Closer question: do voters want to see candidates, especially later in the process, pressed on vulnerabilities their primary opponents were afraid to raise? Think of Obama squirming at some of Charlie Gibson's questions about taxes &amp; bitter clingers in the last 08 debate.
4. Democrats had something like this happen when Hillary was asked in 2008 about drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants, but at least that was a live intra-party debate triggered by an action by her own state's Democratic governor.
3. Clinton alumnus George Stephanopoulos asking a question about contraception in 2012 that no Republican was talking about, but that the Obama campaign very much wanted to talk about, was the height of letting the opposing team literally dictate the terms of debate.
2. That is especially true early in the process when the stage is crowded &amp; the candidates lack time to push back at the questions. One notorious example is the tendency to ask hand-raising questions ("Who here believes in evolution?")
1. I've long thought that the behavior of liberal media figures moderating GOP primary debates shows it's foolhardy to pick moderators so far out of step with the people doing the actual voting. It tends to elevate issues primary voters don't care about &amp; downplay what they do.

@BlockadeRunnerX They are not. Immigrants to that part of Queens are mostly Asian, mainly Chinese. (In fact, new Asian immigrants have outnumbered Latin American immigrants to the USA every year for the past decade).
@BlockadeRunnerX @RadioFreeTom @TPCarney @KevinWGlass @DavidMastio @bobsalpha1 @elhombrelibre1 Indeed it is not, overall. My point is just that it can be - as it is in my parish - death to particular local Catholic communities.		This discussion is about localities, not the Church writ large.
@SteveKellyZZZ Very.
@CTIronman Zero chance Cuomo runs.
@daveweigel Running against a populist who owns a golden elevator.		I confess I was amazed to discover that Sherrod Brown has been in office since the Ford Administration.
If Bloomberg, Brown, Bullock, Bennet &amp; McAuliffe were all to run, the D field would have:		4 Governors	6 Mayors	2 State AGs	1 State Secretary of State	2 DA/County prosecutors	1 city School Superintendent		Lotta state/local government representation.
Biden, Beto &amp; Brown would all be heavyweight candidates. Bloomberg could spend a ton of cash but I don't see him running or mattering. Swalwell's running so hard, I'll be surprised if he doesn't get in. Bennet, I can't possibly see running against Hickenlooper.
Contrast: of the candidates who appear to be still mulling a run (Biden, Beto, Brown, Bloomberg, Bullock, Bennet, Swalwell &amp; McAuliffe), all are straight white guys.		(YMMV who is "seriously" mulling a run) https://t.co/hVCP6kkDxy
What's amazing is not just that Bernie Sanders is almost 80 and has been in elected office since 1981, but that if Joe Biden &amp; Sherrod Brown run, there will be two candidates in the field who entered public office at least six years before Bernie did.
Pete Buttgieg and Tulsi Gabbard were both born while Bernie Sanders was Mayor of Burlington.

Better historical parallel for how a 21st century California liberal/progressive politician plays in the Midwest: Jerry Brown. In his 3 runs, esp. 1992 when he was in the race from start to finish, Brown did well in New England &amp; the West but got massacred in the Midwest &amp; South.

@RadioFreeTom @BiasedGirl @AmyOtto8 @SykesCharlie All I am saying, ultimately, is - especially as a brand-new magazine with no track record to fall back on - who &amp; what you publish *illustrates* what you stand for.		And if the idea was to stand for something better than "trigger the snowflakes in the opposing tribe?" This fails.
@RadioFreeTom @BiasedGirl @AmyOtto8 @SykesCharlie Now, if your view is that all publications are fungible &amp; none stands for anything, that's your view.		I would not have objected to, say, Mother Jones firing Kevin. I'd have been baffled if they hired him in the first place.
@RadioFreeTom @BiasedGirl @AmyOtto8 @SykesCharlie The idea behind The Atlantic hiring Williamson was to offer their readers a range of views. Firing him retreated from that.		What do you think this hire was supposed to accomplish? It seems at odds the things they're supposed to stand for.
@RadioFreeTom @BiasedGirl @AmyOtto8 I'm reasoning with you, Tom. @SykesCharlie can hire or fire whoever he wants. But who you hire &amp; publish reflects on what you stand for. 		Of course, firing someone you just hired bc they turned out to be exactly what you expected is a shabby thing in any gig.
@SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline @MollyJongFast You're probably aware why this is so different from KW: 1) he had a long record as an interesting, provocative long-form writer &amp; 2) The Atlantic doesn't claim on its masthead to be conserving a particular political movement; in theory, it's not a movement journal at all.

I have a variety of issues with Trump &amp; his  imitators &amp; flacks, but the biggest remains this: I think the Trump style of word &amp; deed is a dead end that will leave conservatism weaker &amp; less popular, its institutions less able to resist the enemies of liberty long term.
The challenge for those of us who want a sustainable conservative movement is, how do you go the next step from criticizing people like Charlie Kirk &amp; Candace Owens to offering their under-age-25 audience a better alternative.

3. In racial-demographics terms, with a few exceptions - NY, WA, UT - the states that have gained since 1930 are ones with a lot of immigrants and/or non-whites; the losers have been those with mainly a homegrown, white population.
2. The Northeast and Rust Belt, of course, have taken a beating: NY, PA,, MA, OH, IN, ME, RI, VT. But look at the Mississippi valley &amp; Great Plains: MO had 16 House seats in 1930. IL, IA, AR, LA, MS, KY, ND, SD, KS, OK, WI.
1. How dramatically has our population shifted in the past century? Compare the House seats in the lower 48 states in 1930 (from the 1920 Census) to today (from the 2010 Census).		In 1930, Iowa had as many House seats as California. The Dakotas had 6, Florida had 4. https://t.co/V2i5QqdZwr

By now, the established party organs &amp; networks work for Trump.
@Brad_Hope @SeanTrende @JonahNRO He went halfway in 1968 in ways that a modern primary candidate couldn't do, basically just making himself available to be drafted.
@SeanTrende @JonahNRO Also one quibble: "The potential Reagans are strategically waiting it out (which is paradoxically a somewhat un-Reaganite thing to do)."		Reagan didn't wait out Ford, but he waited out Nixon when NR was backing Ashbrook in 1972.

7. Artistic rivalries are a real thing, and never let an art or music teacher tell you otherwise. Humans are competitive, even the artsiest. History of painting is full of people trying to show the naysayers.
6. George Harrison is maybe a more vivid illustration than most, but across music, film, literature, painting, sculpture, architecture, the pattern is the same. Beethoven comes from a scene connected to Mozart. Rap has had a more vibrant scene than rock the past 20 years.
5. Then we get to 1987-91, and George is back in a band (the Traveling Wilburys), &amp; he tours with Clapton. And all of them - Petty, Lynne, Dylan, Orbison, even Clapton - have something new to bring to their music in that period.
4. Harrison made some good music between 1972-86, but he was no longer in a scene, &amp; it showed. Not coincidentally, his best song in that period (All Those Years Ago) is a homage to Lennon. He missed the creative collaboration.
3. In 1968-71, George Harrison was part of a 'scene' with Clapton, Duane Allman, the whole Delaney &amp; Bonnie crew. They're almost all one big extended band, with a common sound distinct from what any of them did individually before or after.
2. George Harrison's career is a textbook illustration. What a talent, but he absorbed &amp; grew so much from prolonged exposure to Lennon &amp; McCartney. He learned from Eastern music &amp; Dylan.
1. Artists tend to be portrayed in the popular imagination as solitary muse-chasers, but in reality, most good or great creators emerge from a 'scene' that gives them influences, collaborators, rivals, foils - some of them greater artists, but others matter too.

@scareduck @rkylesmith I just counted how many they ran in calendar 2018. No idea.
@yesnicksearcy @allahpundit Republicans were always unlikely to win in 2008, and Obama in 2012 was an incumbent. That said, McCain &amp; Romney were not good candidates. That doesn't mean we should respond by picking a different kind of bad candidate, instead of a good one.
@JimSatala @yesnicksearcy @allahpundit I'm not the one in this argument saying "no more squishes like Reagan." My point is that we should run candidates who do not carry a lot of self-inflicted baggage that gets in the way of appealing to voters.
@yesnicksearcy @allahpundit So, you concede that your point was wholly irrelevant to the actual question of whether those attacks were effective, correct?
@yesnicksearcy @jtinfo @allahpundit No, I reject the premise that using the same playbook against every candidate will be equally effective with the voters.		The media are not the voters.
@rkylesmith 18 episodes in a year at $65,000 an episode [does math]...[whistles, then remembers TV series stars get enough time off to do other roles].
1. Candidates matter.		2. They matter on both sides - good candidates can lose to good foes, bad ones can beat bad foes.		3. Elections are driven by a lot of other forces that matter more than the candidates. But it's precisely at the margins of close races that you want an edge.
@yesnicksearcy @allahpundit You're the one who - just one tweet ago - claimed that Democrats successfully defeated Reagan &amp; both Bushes.
@yesnicksearcy @allahpundit That's obviously why the Democrats won in 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2004.
@yesnicksearcy @allahpundit We could accuse Bernie Sanders or Mike Bloomberg of being a socialist. Which do you think would be more likely to stick?		The idea that Trump's negatives are wholly a function of criticisms that would be leveled at any R is nonsense.

A great hire, but I will refrain from celebrating this until I see how long they stand behind him. https://t.co/y2cXO0WtOm
@allahpundit Among people who'd actually challenge him? Not much of a list. But would the GOP be in a stronger position if Trump was gone &amp; Pence was the nominee? Absolutely.
Yes, I know beating Trump in a primary is extraordinarily unlikely. Yes, I know he's likely to attract only the lousiest alternatives as opponents.		But we don't have to pretend that renominating him is a good idea. He gives away too much no other R would.
Liberals claimed, in 2016, that Trump was an existential threat, yet never acted as if they believed it - all-in behind the creakiest baggage-loaded, Democrat, no policy compromise.		Conservatives who see the 2020 D field as a similar threat should not stay wedded to Trump.

Record since 1921 for "High Quality Starts" in a season (7+ IP, 2 or fewer runs allowed): 28, by Koufax in 1966; then 27, by Koufax in 1963 &amp; Denny McLain in 1968; then 26, by Seaver in 1973, Feller in 1946.
Ed Walsh had 34 games in 1908 alone (all starts) of 7+ IP, 2 or fewer runs allowed. Went 30-4 in those games, 10-11 in his other 32 appearances (15 of them starts).		Walsh, of course, blew his arm out at 32.
(Walter Johnson also did it five times as a reliever! Plus probably his number goes up a bit when the data covers the 12 starts of his rookie year, 1907.)
My favorite Don Sutton statistic: Sutton threw 7+ innings &amp; allowed 2 or fewer runs in 310 starts. Went 221-32. Back to 1908, only 3 pitchers have done that 300 times (Walter Johnson 323, Roger Clemens 308).		That's a *lot* of times giving your team a very good chance to win.

@BobSikes Boys of Summer was mostly about the 1952 team, so he got short shrift.
Don Newcombe started the Bobby Thomson game for the Dodgers, on 2 days' rest from a relief appearance the day after a complete game, itself on 2 days rest from a CG. Newk held the Giants to 1 run, Dodgers went up 4-1 top 8. Newk, spent, ran outta gas in 9th. Branca faced 1 man.
1946-56, the first decade of integration when black pitchers faced particular race-based skepticism about the mental aspects of their craft, Newcombe was 112-48 with the Dodgers &amp; 52-18 in the minors, including 47-12 in 1955-56.
Newk hit .300/.372/.424 with 14 HR, 80 RBI, 60/88 BB/K age 28-33, when pitching was his day job. Amazing plate discipline for a pitcher. 1959 he threw 222 innings, issued 27 walks, and drew 17.
RIP Don Newcombe: MVP, Cy Young, Rookie of the Year, part of Brooklyn's only World Series winners, Negro League vet, 27-game winner, one of the best hitting pitchers ever, likely cost Dodgers 1 or 2 championships serving in Army 52-53, second act battling substance abuse.
Sunk costs are sunk costs, of course, but Hosmer at least has to be ecstatic to have a higher-paid teammate, both to diffuse the grief he gets &amp; to show the team is trying.
The Padres have undoubtedly overpaid in laying out $73.5 million a year the next three years for Machado, Hosmer, &amp; Myers. Machado looks like the best deal of the 3. Question is whether they use those deals as an excuse to not surround them with a solid roster.

@craigcalcaterra And my reason for thinking the precedent will be abused for larger things in the future is precisely because of the track record of abuse of executive powers in the past.
@craigcalcaterra You insist on pretending executive overreach of congressional delegation began in January 2017 and will vanish when Democrats return. My concern with the separation of powers is precisely because it's a question of precedent.		The wall is a small thing, The precedent isn't.

lol Diamond &amp; Silk. https://t.co/it6edNBfC4

Mars Opportunity rover's last thought: I shoulda brought Matt Damon with me so they'd come get me.
To his credit, Jason Vargas did make a significant contribution to the Royals becoming World Champions in 2015.
@rbrianc I'd wager at least 75% of pitchers who did so were either knucklers or converted to the bullpen. Probably more like 95%.
The "Quality Start" is a pretty low bar: 6+ innings, 3 or fewer earned runs.		Out of 20 starts last season, Jason Vargas threw 4 Quality Starts, vs 7 starts where he allowed at least 1 run per inning.		Obviously the Mets hope Vargas will turn the corner in 2019 at age 36.

7. And that is why I place my faith in modern technology. Because technology isn't just theory, it's tested in the real world. We can see it work, or not.		Vaccines work.
6. Science is a search to match theories to evidence. Some theories are accepted because they can be tested or replicated, others simply because they explain the available evidence. Never blindly accept authority, and never blindly reject it. Follow the evidence.
5. You don't have to believe everything that every doctor or drug company tells you about every vaccine. But when you look at the evidence, the big mainstream vaccines have delivered on their promise to do a huge amount of good at minimal risk. Why I had my kids vaccinated.
4. When the climate-alarm crowd can show the kind of measurable outcomes of, say, the polio or measles vaccine, let's talk. So far, what they've delivered instead is a massive number of predictions that didn't pan out, &amp; their own share of scandals of scientific integrity.
3. Proponents of climate-change alarmism like to compare skeptics to anti-vaxxers. But there is a vast, unbridgeable distinction. Vaccines have proven themselves in practice, delivering huge, measurable declines in many infectious diseases.
2. Likewise, parental autonomy is a valuable thing. Government shouldn't just knee-jerk override parents on vaccines in every case. But individual autonomy, while a crucial value, is never absolute.
1. I have no quarrel with subjecting vaccines to informed skepticism, especially new &amp; exotic ones; that's healthy. No blank checks. But informed skepticism includes a duty to accept evidence &amp; reject frauds that have been decisively debunked like the autism-vaccine link.

@JoeM3120 very true
13. Every American should still learn as much as they can about, and from, Lincoln. And every Republican should go back to his career often to recall where our party came from &amp; how to lead it. His lessons are timeless.
12. Finally, Lincoln was fearless with his own life. He strolled the streets of Richmond just after it was conquered. He disregarded warnings against going to Ford's Theater.
11. Governing in a time of tragedy &amp; vitriol, Lincoln pressed on through his own personal tragedy, the loss of a son in office &amp; the severe mental toll that took on his wife.
10. Lincoln wasn't a churchgoing type, &amp; struggled with faith. But he also understood the deep power &amp; role of faith not just in American life but in moral &amp; political argument. He called Americans both to Christian dignity &amp; Christian mercy.
9. Lincoln was a military amateur, but he became a hands-on leader after seeing how inept his generals were, then backed off when he got Grant &amp; Sherman. He carried a folding campaign map around with him &amp; had a big one on a tripod in his office.
8. Lord Palmerston, the British Prime Minister until 1865, had become British Secretary at War in 1809, the year Lincoln was born. Franz Joseph, the Austrian Emperor for 13 years before Lincoln was elected, reigned until 1916.
7. Lincoln was also an actor on a busy world stage. Bismarck came to power in 1862. China's civil war raged parallel to ours, as did the opening of Japan. Alexander II signed the emancipation of serfs the night before Lincoln's first inauguration.
6. Lincoln shared some of the prejudices of his day, but was willing to learn &amp; change &amp; showed personal respect to all. He was practical about voting coalitions: he incorporated anti-immigrant voters in his anti-slavery fight, pushed for progress where &amp; when voters were ready.
5. Unlike Washington, Lincoln wasn't a distant, marble figure in life. He had an immense store of dirty jokes &amp; toilet humor. He enjoyed the rough &amp; tumble.
4. Lincoln would do fine in today's political environment; he was a man of great talent, flexibility, humane spirit but also willingness to do the dirty work of politics, &amp; he thrived in an age when politics was even uglier.
3. Then, as now, Republicans were the party of small business. Then, as now, there  was a strong Midwestern Christian strain to the party. Then, as now, the party had internal divisions over immigration &amp; trade.
2. The Republican Party has changed in a number of ways since Lincoln. But there remain many common threads in its central ideology. Lincoln's GOP was about freedom of all to keep the fruits of their individual labor, personal responsibility, dignity of every life.
1. Abraham Lincoln was born 210 years ago today. Here's two from my archives, one on Lincoln's ideas &amp; tactics https://t.co/9KTxOZpd4I		and one on how it was rejection of Lincoln's election that triggered secession &amp; Civil War https://t.co/Rg5MXLWhjs

@henryolsenEPPC Yeah, my knowledge of 19th century British soccer is pretty spotty &amp; I gather the origins are somewhat debatable, but neither it nor thoroughbred racing nor prizefighting existed in an organized way very long before Harry Wright invented pro baseball in 1869.
@NathanWurtzel I'm talking about organized leagues for profit.
I may be overlooking something but offhand, I believe only the British soccer leagues really rival the age of Major League Baseball among organized pro sports. Certainly it was not a widespread thing anywhere before the end of the 1860s.
When you consider how new pro sports were in 1889 (MLB had only existed since 1871) and, in fact, how relatively new global steam travel was, Spalding's world baseball tour looks all the more amazing. https://t.co/t9xfvO6QHc

@charlescwcooke @varadmehta Actually, we should abolish it and go back to just celebrating Washington &amp; Lincoln. Or at least call it "Presidents other than Woodrow Wilson Day."
@RadioFreeTom One, either we are having a comparative argument about the 2 parties on this or we are not. Your case for "vote D over R across the board" makes it one.		Two, I am not looking the other way, I am precluded for professional reasons from writing about the topic in public.
@RadioFreeTom I am not saying that. I am saying that judges are a very big factor on one side of this argument, and a particularly big one if your contention is that we should burn all the R checks &amp; balances out of the Senate for the next D POTUS.
@RadioFreeTom @ecmprint I have very serious concerns about the Russia stuff, some of which I am not at liberty to write about publicly. But even there, 1) Trump Admin policy has not been as bad as Trump, &amp; 2) I do not for an instant believe Democrats will keep seeing Putin as a threat once Trump goes.
@RadioFreeTom You're missing the point. When conservatives control the courts, you can fight these things out in the court of public opinion.		When liberals control the courts, public opinion no longer has a seat at the table.
@staceewell We are having a discussion that started on explicitly comparative terms.
@ecmprint @RadioFreeTom This is a defensible position. "Trump is a bigger threat to our Constitutional order than Democrats," in my view, is not.
@RadioFreeTom We won a lot of things between 1980 and 1996, though we failed to undo others, esp on size of govt. But take a serious look at what things we have advanced since then, vs what they have.
@RadioFreeTom @DouthatNYT I agree that he has been terrible on tariffs, but bear in mind that he is there exercising an authority Congress - not foreseeing Trump - explicitly delegated to the president. None of his steps on trade increase the power future presidents can wield.
@RadioFreeTom This is the core of where we disagree. Decades of US history show that when Democrats advance, they entrench. Anything - other than taxes &amp; foreign policy - that we cede to them once is forever gone. Whereas Trump can't even get a fence built,.
@RadioFreeTom @DouthatNYT Or look at executive power. By any reasonable estimation, Trump's Administration has - despite Trump's own instincts - been far more modest about using executive authority to make domestic law than his predecessor.
@RadioFreeTom @DouthatNYT Let's take free press as an example. Trump has said a lot of awful things. But he hasn't tried to change libel laws. He hasn't prosecuted journalists. He hasn't stopped anyone from publishing. And it's the left, not Trump, that has had much more effect in getting people fired.
@RadioFreeTom "A cost I'm willing to bear" is a different answer than "I disagree with (2) and (3)".		And of course, judges are just one of the ways the Democrats aim to permanently unravel our Constitutional structure, not on one man's impulses but as a permanent platform.
@RadioFreeTom But you're skipping over the point @DouthatNYT makes, which is that a lot of the things Trump talks about, wants to do, or fantasizes about doing, do not actually happen. You may not concede that a quiet GOP check is one reason why, but the outcomes are there.
@RadioFreeTom I'm trying to pin down where we disagree, rather than argue that judges are everything. But if you are not even willing to acknowledge the very heavy cost of preferring liberal judges, it's hard to have an argument about weighing costs.
@RadioFreeTom It's an argument that the president's worst instincts are not necessarily the same thing as the outcome of voting for Republican Senators.

@RadioFreeTom I don't expect us to weigh the competing considerations equally. But 1) courts matter to our constitutional structure 2) Trump has appointed people who will protect that structure &amp; 3) Democrats will appoint people who will erode it.		Do you disagree with any of those?

@ThePlumLineGS You're shifting the goalposts here to "Do any Democrats ever get bad press for anything?," when my point is specific: it's extremely common to frame stories as reflective of damaging extremism in R thinking &amp; proposals, w/o "Dems say" qualifiers. Asymmetrical.
Voter ID polls extremely well. So do late-term abortion bans. Lots of Republican candidates have been branded extremists for backing referendums that drew majority or supermajority voter support.
Sure, progressives argue that it's impossible for these kinds of policies to be extreme because some of them, in the abstract, poll well. But conservative proposals routinely get branded "extreme" even if they poll well. https://t.co/2MEqkyufVy
The "Republicans risk alienating voters with their extreme positions" story is so familiar by now it's practically a macro. I can't recall seeing one that diluted this message by framing it as "Democrats say."

@presjpolk I should run some numbers on this, but would be interesting to look at where the Anderson voters went in 1984, and likewise in other 3d party races.		Eyeballing the data, looks like Reagan probably won a majority of them in 1984.
Adding to the degree of difficulty, Jackie Robinson between 1947 &amp; 1955 played regularly at four different positions (1B, 2B, 3B, &amp; LF) &amp; was an excellent defender at all but first.
@vepapa Probably.
Jackie Robinson from 1945-49 was not just excelling at the most difficult skill in pro sports AND doing so while enduring the harsh glare of racial pioneering against vicious resistance; he was also still learning the game at its highest level.
Can you become a Major League-caliber hitter in your mid-20s with little experience in organized ball? 1 season of Negro League ball at age 26 was Jackie Robinson's first as a pro, 1st since college. From there, hit .349/.468/.462 in AAA at 27,  .297/.383/.427 at 28 for Dodgers.
@NathanWurtzel And when you run the chart for pitchers, Eddie Lopat is the highest at #17.
Side note: by WAR, the 12 best MLB position players 1949-53 included 		#1 Jackie Robinson	#4 Duke Snider	#6 Pee Wee Reese	#7 Roy Campanella	#12 Gil Hodges		Dodgers lost 3 World Series (7 game, 6 game, 5 game) &amp; lost 2 pennants on the last day, one in a playoff. Yankees: 5 titles.
Among the many aspects of Jackie Robinson's life &amp; career, from a strictly baseball perspective, he was the best player in the game in 1949-53 - but he was already 30. We may not have seen his best.		https://t.co/yWJxAiLY4H		https://t.co/TA3prrhGYJ https://t.co/TeDVwOvIO2

I for one am shocked to discover that living beyond one's means &amp; running up debts are caused by spending too much money. https://t.co/PNxPBpTaIA
I could cite other examples on both sides. But proponents of player economic interests are taking too easy a shortcut if they ignore ways that the players' interests do collide with what fans want out of the game.
That doesn't mean fans should reflexively side with owners. An obvious example: rules that allow teams to benefit from service time manipulation incentivize teams sacrificing both short-term wins *and* fans getting to watch prime young talent.
This oversimplifies a two-sided situation; fan interests are not always aligned with player interests. One, a free market for players benefits big-market teams, &amp; fans of small-market teams aren't deluded about that. Two, fans prefer less mobility by homegrown stars. https://t.co/r4Cy0YnXOh

@BenjySarlin Also, the income on the wealth is already taxed.
@wrdcsc One of the great crises of our time is that the globalization policies that do the most to help the poorest also create more economic stress for the working class.
@BenjySarlin I'm starting with the principle here - you're taxing a finite asset, not a stream. What is actually the more immediate problem is that you create a colossal incentive for tax avoidance. Add that to the core structural problem &amp; the system is designed to be unsustainable.
@wrdcsc I would say, not the poor exclusively, but the non-rich. The median income person is a proper concern of policymakers.
@BenjySarlin My point is that the taxing authority runs out of wealth above that line, &amp; has thus planned future expenditures financed by an empty revenue bucket.

Politics conducted solely by people who have decided that they can take anything - and thus never fear the consequences of dishing anything out - is the mindset of societies on the verge of anarchy. It is not to be aspired to.
Marriage &amp; parenthood are important experiences that make you more empathetic to, &amp; familiar with, the opposite sex &amp; younger generations. If we drive everyone with those experiences out of opinion journalism, we'll be left with a more narrow-minded, intolerant dialogue.
There are days when I wonder if the mania for doxxing, death threats, job threats, boycotts &amp; harassment mean that opinion journalism should be solely the province of people without families. Which of course would mean a deeply unrepresentative &amp; unbalanced commentariat.

In order to see the GOP strategy as a fight to lose the policy battle but win the war with the voters, you need to believe that the long-term outcome will hurt Ds more than it hurts Rs. Showcasing D extremism on borders *is* a modest win, but at cost of a long shutdown &amp; cave.
In order to see the GOP strategy as a fight to make a good deal, you need to believe that they have the same kind of leverage. Lacking that, the only way out is defeat.
In order to see the GOP strategy as a fight to win, you need to believe that Democrats see a protracted shutdown as a bad thing, rather than a political goldmine. Yet, there is no evidence that more than a handful of Democrats see it that way. So, where is the pressure point?

Are Democrats behaving in exactly the way they called "terrorism" &amp; "hostage taking" just a few years ago? Of course. Nobody should have been surprised at this, least of all Beltway Republicans (including Trump).		Failing to plan for the other side's strategy is a plan to fail.
As a matter of pure politics, Trump needs to claim he got something he can call "the Wall," &amp; Democrats need to say they stopped him.		But it was obvious two years ago that both of these things were true. Neither the White House nor Congressional Rs planned ahead for them.

If you would know who has power in a society, ask whom people are afraid to offend, and who expects their taking of offense to have consequences.

@nubyishere @daveweigel I respect some good Grover Cleveland pedantry.
@paulwaldman1 Ted Cruz begs to differ. 2016 wasn't even that long ago. Have you really never read anything about, say, Ted Cruz being less than well-liked in the Senate?
@OneFineJay Yes. It's the moment he knew we won.

In 1964, the New York Yankees - coming off their 5th straight pennant - had a starting rotation including Whitey Ford, Ralph Terry, Al Downing &amp; Jim Bouton. 		Yogi gave 3 starts in a 7 game World Series to a 22-year-old rookie, Mel Stottlemyre. That's how good Mel was.

Right. If he'd said that, he'd have been on solid ground. 		He said something very different, and after an escalating series of statements &amp; symbols that left him no benefit of the doubt. https://t.co/XRhwv3Q6fN
RT @cjciaramella: People on here acting like they wouldn't pick up the phone one day and say "bring me 300 Big Macs" if they had the power.
@Jake_W Very bad decision. But necessitated, maybe, by the political importance of Virginia.
Arguable point.		The most underrated general of the war was Winfield Scott, who was physically unable to command in battle anymore but designed the Union's original &amp; ultimately successful grand strategy. https://t.co/wpa6kKf8F7

Maybe, if you have legitimate grievances against Donald Trump, frothing at the mouth at him serving fast food to college football players is not the best way to advance the credibility of those grievances.
Out of 45 presidents, we've had some pretty terrible ones, but the Confederacy only had 1, and Jefferson Davis was worse than any of the 45. In so many ways. https://t.co/HIWsT702GY
Jefferson Davis had the credentials to be a chief military strategist. But he was bad at it, whereas Lincoln (with no credentials) turned out to have tremendous instincts. https://t.co/SaqDmrVpjF
@baseballot This sort of thing is cumulative. And then of course in 2015-16 there were bigger fish to fry and King was on the right side of that.
@baseballot You don't think he's made any newsworthy statements in the past decade?		Frankly, King was on nobody's national radar before 2013.
@WenzlerPowers Had Franken been their nominee in 2018, liberals would have defended him as they did Brown, Carper, Ellison, Waters, O'Rourke, Gillum, etc
@joshnhasler Yes.
@jeffm8_bs @avitia_charro They replaced him with an appointed D.

Of course not. But we have standards. https://t.co/3OaDGRbA44
