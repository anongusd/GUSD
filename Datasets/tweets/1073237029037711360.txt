@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline Plus, most small businesses probably pay their CEOs salaries that are fair, and so they'd automatically qualify for the 10% tax rate.
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline If the lowest paid worker got paid more than 1/10 of the CEO pay, I'd be happy to lower taxes on those corporations to 10%.  The more fair companies are to their employees, the less the government has to pay attention.
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline If I were in charge of business taxes, businesses whose CEOs made no more than 10x the salary of the mathematical mean employee would pay reasonable taxes, if they made more than 10x that, tax rates would go up to 90%. That way, CEOs would have a financial incentive to pay fairly
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline Also, re: Healthcare.  Obamacare reduced the "overhead" insurance companies could charge from the 30% it had been to 20%. That was a good start, but socialized medicine has overhead below 15%.  We need THAT.
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline Secondly, If you look at your proxy statements, you will notice a correlation between the amount of corporate welfare and the CEO salary. Corporate welfare is B.S.... the only time it is appropriate is to provide jobs for the disabled. (IMO)
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline For one, the inheritance tax should be higher... that will harm me personally, but it is the right thing to do.

@ConservaGrrl @katyjohnson30 @DavidAFrench https://t.co/U9QGkI1fy7  I do NOT see you advocating for "those in society who are most vulnerable and without a voice to do so for themselves"... you support Trump and his CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

Government figures don't include important stuff, and they do include stupid stuff like the price of a computer. My newest computer is five years old.. so the price of computers is irrelevant to me.
@PhilipCahalin @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline We agree on that.

@HughJassole8860 @SenBlumenthal @IvanTheTroll12 @G00SE_13 @Established1791 No, you want higher maternal mortality and more babies on food stamps or in orphanages,... it is easier for people like Trump to abuse them that way.

@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden @janschakowsky There is no defense of Trump's behavior or the pay-to-play culture that Mr. Trump and his associates are participating in.
@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden @janschakowsky AH... I was referring to the party... not you in particular. The Republican party is currently shrinking because the good people and the intelligent people are becoming independents.
@WelshGoodLife @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @JoeBiden Oh? Trump has called for fixing it?  Really?  Because that's totally not true.
@WelshGoodLife @bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @JoeBiden @janschakowsky I am no fan of non-socialized medicine.	I have no experience with socialized medicine.	However, my daughter has a friend who was bitching that it cost $400 to go to the hospital. In America .. that bill is more like $10,000.
@WelshGoodLife @bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @JoeBiden @janschakowsky What I know is that insurance makes it impossible to get medical care in many cases. Doctors will actually say to you... your insurance doesn't cover that.
@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden @janschakowsky Also, I didn't say you were disingenuous. I said that YES, Democratic politicians have, in my personal experience, gone out of their way to help me and my children -- biological as well as student-children.
@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden @janschakowsky Jan had her staff make a telephone call to BCBS to ask them if they had a habit of not adhering to contracts.... they decided it was less trouble to honor the contract than to admit that it really was a habit.
This is a typical Trumpster defense of Trump's policies.	Your guy did it so it is okay for my guy to do it.  Not.... Oh, yeah, we should fix it.	The second argument.... You hate babies, and I'm gonna call a fetus a baby to prove it. https://t.co/luGhtPgOy5
@WelshGoodLife @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @JoeBiden I love how your defense of Trump's policy is to say... HEY, doing evil was okay with you when it was your guy, so therefore, I'm 100% in favor of evil when it is my guy.... Such moral fortitude. How do you sleep at night?
@WelshGoodLife @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @JoeBiden First of all, that's a strawman argument. There are fetuses and embryos in the womb.  Secondly, when the media reported abuses by the Obama administration the Obama administration FIXED THE PROBLEM. Trump exacerbates it.

@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden Also, the alderman who was in power when I taught at Schurz H.S. got funding for an after-school tutoring to help my students (and all of the other students in the school).  So yes... I believe that Democratic politicians do their best to help their constituents.
@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden I endorse .@janschakowsky because she WENT OUT OF HER WAY to help my son with autism get the insurance coverage that our contract claimed we had, and BCBS of IL refused to honor.  So... yes, I believe in my Democratic representatives.
@bill3133 @Sciencegirl60 @DMcCforYou @kimguilfoyle @WelshGoodLife @JoeBiden Yes, as a matter of fact, I have evidence that they do.

@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader The proposed site was literally the  dump.
@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader @KamalaHarris @MittRomney AH... so if Al Capone were alive,... you'd say..... he's a billionaire, you don't become a billionaire by playing nice.		Seriously dude. Some self-reflection is in order.
@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader Actually, I don't think you read carefully enough.  This isn't the area where military families live... although... I still think the Military hasn't been careful enough about the health and safety of soldiers... https://t.co/5jCwVETUkf

@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader If Trump weren't in complete control of the GOP, I wouldn't be adamantly anti-Republican.  Trump is pure evil.  Republicans should not support him blindly.  Intelligent Republicans, George Will, Krauthammer, Painter, etc. don't.
@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader @KamalaHarris @MittRomney Again... she's a FRESHMAN congresswoman. She has set-the-world-on-fire ideas and ideals. She will eventually have enough experience to be practical.  To say AOC is the Democratic Party is to say that Dylan Roof ( a registered Republican) IS the Republican party. Ridiculous.
@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader The ONLY thing I agree with Trump on... CNN is not a great news source.

@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader @KamalaHarris @MittRomney Trump is never gonna get his stupid wall.... and anyone who still supports the fool.. knows it isn't gonna happen..... Furthermore EVEN Mr. Trump has STOPPED SAYING MEXICO WILL PAY FOR THE WALL.
@gabe92821373 @RepSwalwell @donlemon @GOPLeader The Green Deal, as @KamalaHarris has stated, is aspirational. You and I both know, Americans distrust government enough that it will NEVER exist as Ocasio imagines it.  ACA is modeled after @MittRomney's successful model.

@MeetThePress @chucktodd He certainly couldn't work LESS...	And, I believe Mulvaney... I believe that Mr. Trump is working hard to siphon tax dollars into the Trump Organization and figuring out how to extract bribes during his executive time.

@BokoHarambe @emma_jeffreys3 @waterisntwet @walterolson I'm not sure what the consequences for randomly firing a gun in public are... is that a felony? Whatever it is driving drunk is 100% analogous.
@BokoHarambe @emma_jeffreys3 @waterisntwet @walterolson Except that when you are drunk and driving,... the gun is already being shot... the only question is whether or not the bullets (or the car) hits an innocent victim.

@truthtotweet @RepSpeier @littlemeanj9 Actually, the contrast is F-ing amazing. https://t.co/xPUepuVfEU  January 20, 2017, the GOP led House saw an opportunity to expand pay-to-play opportunities and if Americans hadn't taken the time to call and complain, this would now be law.
