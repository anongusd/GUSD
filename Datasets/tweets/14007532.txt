@juliet_106 @NBCNews This is a different bill.
They also voted to go to conference on border security. The Senate negotiators will be:		GOP:	Shelby	Capito	Hoeven	Blunt		DEM:	Leahy	Durbin	Tester
@StewSays what was the second vote?
BREAKING: Senate PASSES, by voice vote, CR to reopen government until Feb 15
MCCONNELL says "with cooperation" they will send the CR to reopen the government to Pres Trump for his signature TODAY.
Pres Trump says "In a short while I will sign a bill" to re-open the government for three weeks.		FYI: Congress needs to pass it first.
Pres Trump: "We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government"
Soooooo, is the #SOTU back on??
Sources tell @AlexNBCNews, @HallieJackson, @LACaldwellDC. @kwelkernbc and myself: 	There is a tentative deal to reopen the govt until Feb 15th, with the intention of going to conference to debate a DHS bill/border security.		Nothing's final until it's final, though...
Senate is recessed subject to the call of the chair. 		Translation: All senatorial eyes are now on the Rose Garden.
Of note: @SenatorDurbin said not many Sens are in town: "I think most of them have left, but I stuck around, &amp; some did too, on the thought that we may have a vote"		Could mean 2 things:	1)They need to call everyone back (which would take time)	2)They pass something by voice vote

@WCAX_Ike It is real.
Q: Do you think McConnell can negotiate when Pres Trump changes his mind so often?		DURBIN: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø		Q: Can you articulate that?		DURBIN: "McConnell has a tough assignment if he‚Äôs trying to read the President‚Äôs mind.‚Äù

TED CRUZ: "Ok, we get, they hate Donald Trump. If anyone had missed that point, that they really really really don't like this man, their yelling &amp; screaming &amp; bellowing has made that abundantly clear. But just because you hate somebody doesn't mean you should shut the govt down"

@BrianHDarling @realDonaldTrump They would still need a concurrent resolution

To clarify: Listening back to audio of Romney, sounds like he may be open to voting YES on CR to Feb 8th, but a FINAL DEAL must include border barrier $$: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt vote for anything that‚Äôs a final deal that doesn‚Äôt include border security, and that includes a border barrier.‚Äù
ROMNEY says he will support the President‚Äôs proposal, but not the CR to  reopen the govt until Feb 8.		Asked about @SecretaryRoss‚Äô comments, Romney said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think comments like that help.‚Äù

McConnell and Schumer just announced on the Senate floor there will be TWO VOTES on Thursday at 2:30pm:	1) Pres Trump's proposal	2) A CR that re-opens govt until Feb 8		Both need 60 votes to pass.
The Senate has voted by voice vote to proceed to the vehicle for Pres Trump's proposal. 		Setting up key procedural votes on the measure for THURSDAY.
MCCONNELL TODAY: "It's a proposal that the President will support, as I've stated consistently over the past month, that fact will earn it consideration here in the Senate."		MCCONNELL BEFORE: (See screengrab) https://t.co/RCUeTb62i4
McConnell said today they will vote on Pres Trump's proposal on Thursday.		ALSO TODAY:		PELOSI: "We heard what the particulars were and it was a nonstarter."		SCHUMER: "It hardly represents a softening of his position. If anything it's even more radical."
For WEEKS McConnell has said that any bill the Senate considers must check 3 boxes:		1) Trump willing to sign	2) Gets 60 in Senate	3) Will pass Dem House		Anything that didn't get all 3 would not be getting a vote.		"The Senate will not waste time on show-votes," McConnell said.
Sen @timkaine just tried to pass a bill to re-open the government by unanimous consent on the Senate floor.		As expected, @senatemajldr McConnell objected.
Schumer says of Trump's proposal the Senate will vote on this week: "the asylum changes are a poison pill"
MCCONNNELL: "Is their plan truly to throw federal workers, DACA recipients, customs and border patrol, and indeed all Americans, under the bus just to extend this run of political theater so they can look like champions of the so-called resistance?"
MCCONNELL: "We'll vote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week. All that needs to happen is for our democratic friends to agree to put the country ahead of politics, take yes for an answer, and vote to put the stand-off behind us."
It's totally wild that there are over 100 freshmen lawmakers in Congress who have been on the job for almost three weeks and have yet to experience a fully functioning government.

Today‚Äôs motion to proceed vote, which began at 12:31pm and ended at 5:49pm (5 hours and 18 minutes), became the longest vote in modern Senate history, beating out BY ONE MINUTE a vote on the Economic Recovery Act in February 2009 which lasted 5 hours and 17 minutes.

Trump confirms the Pompeo-Kim Jong-un meeting https://t.co/QaoLtTzBgx
News of the Pompeo meeting with Kim Jong-un coming out after his confirmation hearing but before the committee vote makes an already contentious nomination even more interesting.
Sad news out of Texas ‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/MwWUAZ2IfM
And now the WH is telling the pool that Pres Trump misunderstood or misheard the question
In other news:	Trump was just asked at Mar-a-Lago if he has spoken directly with North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un.		"Yes," Trump responded.
@jbillinson agreed.
@SenDuckworth @amyklobuchar Even more importantly, Klobuchar says Duckworth's baby won't have a dress code: "We‚Äôre also not going to require certain outfits like a suit...the baby will be able to wear whatever the baby wants to wear."
@SenDuckworth More importantly, Sen @amyklobuchar says @SenDuckworth's baby will not have to wear a pin or use a floor pass.		"I think we can get that baby on with no identification and trust the mother," Klobuchar said.
Sen Klobuchar says the Senate Rules Cmte has passed the resolution to allow @SenDuckworth to have her newborn child on the Senate floor during votes. Bill could be passed in the full Senate later this week.
Sen GRAHAM: "I think Assad thinks after this strike believes we're all tweet and no action. I think Russian and Iran is pretty convinced that we will not engage them in any fashion..."
Briefing was with Mattis and Coats. GRAHAM: "Seems to me that we're willing to give Syria to Assad, Russia and Iran and we're trying to find some way to leave Syria to keep ISIL destroyed and I just don't see how that works..."
Sen GRAHAM leaves mtg on #Syria strategy not feeling so great about what he heard: "Everything in that briefing made me more worried, not less. This makes no sense to me..."

Bit of a curveball in the Pompeo confirmation vote tally in the Senate Foreign Relations Cmte, as @JeffFlake is UNDECIDED.		‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting to talk to him privately again...I have a couple of concerns I‚Äôm waiting to hear on,‚Äù Flake says.
Sen Shaheen says she‚Äôs ‚Äúgetting closer‚Äù to a decision on Mike Pompeo‚Äôs nomination for Secretary of State. She‚Äôs a key Dem vote in the Foreign Relations Cmte.
On @TeamCavuto, McConnell shuts the door on the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the one who decides what we take to the floor, that‚Äôs my responsibility as majority leader, we‚Äôll not be having this on the floor of the Senate.‚Äù

Q: Is Rear Adm Jackson qualified to run the VA?		TESTER: "By his own admission Admiral Jackson has utilized the VA and at moments in time in in his career has worked in the VA, but certainly is not an expert in the VA."

@burgessev huh?
SASSE ends his speech saying "We ought not in the body find it difficult to say basic truth things...We condemn a Russian despot that aims to make Soviet tyranny great again." (üî•üî•)
Sen @BenSasse says there are "two great symbols of America" in DC:		1) The Capitol dome ("testifies to the strength of our self-government")		2) The WH press room podium ("simply the free world's biggest megaphone")
SASSE: "What happened yesterday at the podium in the White House, the dodge on Putin, broke with the basic American moral tradition..."
SASSE: "Vladimir Putin is not a friend, Vladimir Putin is a despot. The President of the United States was wrong to congratulate him and the White House press secretary was wrong to dump--to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's reelection was free and fair."
Sen Sasse is on the floor now criticizing two things:	1) Pres Trump for calling Putin to congratulate him on his reelection	2) The aide who leaked that it said "DO NOT CONGRATULATE" in his briefing book.
To be clear: There is a 0% chance Rand Paul votes YES on the Omnibus, so any delay that resulted in a shutdown or CR would be to make a point about the awfulness of the process (similar to what he did in February).
@burgessev Is Rand?
FLAKE on the Pres Trump calling to congratulate Putin: "I wouldn't have done it, it'd be like me calling Fidel Castro and saying, 'Good job, you really took 99%,' I mean, those elections don't mean very much and I think we shouldn't lend any credence to them."
Btw, while @SpeakerRyan was at the WH for this meeting with Trump about the Omnibus, @SenateMajLdr McConnell called into the meeting, his office says.

@SenDougJones Pretty wild that a Democratic Senator from Alabama is using his first speech on the Senate floor to encourage Congress to have "a serious discussion about guns and gun safety."
@SenDougJones Sen Doug Jones (D-AL): "It is time, Mr. President, that we have a serious, pragmatic and practical discussion ‚Äì not a debate, not a negotiation ‚Äì but a dialogue on the steps that we can take to reduce the harm caused by gun violence in this country."
Senate Floor Alert: @SenDougJones is giving his maiden floor speech NOW.
MCCONNELL just now: "I'm pleased to report that the appropriations package is currently being finalized."

SPOTTED at #CPAC18 https://t.co/Vo8wXf261x
FCC Chairman @AjitPaiFCC was just suprised at #CPAC18 by being awarded the CPAC Charlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award.
Ending the very Trump-rally-esque #CPAC18 speech, Pres Trump walks off the stage to "You can't always get what you want"
There it is: Sneaking it in at the end of a 75 minute #CPAC18 speech: North Korea sanctions.
@RepSwalwell He read 'The Snake' countless times on the campaign trail.
@KenDilanianNBC dude, this is basically every single 2016 Trump rally.
OMG Pres Trump is about to do 'The Snake' at #CPAC18
Pres Trump at #CPAC18: "I want people coming into this country base on merit."
@andylancaster He says some are talented with weaponry.
Pres Trump: "These teachers love their students, &amp; these teachers are talented with weaponry &amp; guns, &amp; they feel safe. And I'd rather have somebody who loves their students &amp; wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn't know anybody..."
Pres Trump on the Parkland, FL school shooting: "A teacher would have shot the hell outta him before he knew what happened."
Pres Trump on arming teachers at schools to make schools a "hard target": "I don't want to have 100 guards standing with rifles all over the school, you do a conceal-carry permit..."
Pres Trump speaking about the school shooting in Parkland, FL: "We will act, we will do something."
Maybe the biggest applause in the room at #CPAC18 when Pres Trump says "We all proudly stand for the national anthem."		Crowd chants "USA! USA! USA!"
A sole "Lock HIM up!" from a #CPAC18 attendee when Pres Trump mentions Pres Obama as a terrible negotiator.
Pres Trump at #CPAC18: "We've got seven years to go, folks..."

Appears the Russian flag protester just interrupted Trump's speech at #CPAC18, he was escorted out of the room and threw flags in the air.
