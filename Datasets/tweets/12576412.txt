@Chronotope Short term it's perhaps paid via venture funding &amp; longterm w/enough supply I could see possible arbitrage w/power costs from mining that could make $3/user work. My thinking on bullshit number is that it that prob requires ridic assumptions about return frequency and onsite time
@Chronotope letting other aspects of this idea slide for a moment, I'd love to see the $3/user/month converted to a national CPM $ average. this would seem 1000x the average revenue per user compared to advertising. even at a 0.05% conversion rate it could be 50x

Cities by count:	* under 10k citizens: 16,470	* 10k-24,999 citizens: 1,555	* 25k plus citizens: 1,480 		Suggests to me that, on Facebook money alone, at least 92% of cities will not be able to afford journalist to cover them	 	(City counts via https://t.co/BLF3EE64nG)
There are 16,470 towns in America with 9,999 citizens or left. At $4.32 CPM if you get every citizen to read one article a day you're still capping out at $15,766.42/year in revenue before expenses. Up to 24,999 citizens reading 1 article a day and you're making just $39,418.42.

@nichcarlson @Jason You're both right. Local not the same as the majors. Median city population is maybe, 20k?

Either this is a long troll or horribly bad opsec for an organization that is making a living at this brand of undercover investigatory work. Would assume the worst but not sure which is which.

A contributor who convinces a unique audience to read her on Medium will benefit more than a publisher who cannibalizes existing readership
Your readers already on Medium? The baby gets split with everyone. Medium pays relatively more for audience reached from outside its bubble
Medium will set aside a pool of money and pay a contributor based on the tunnel vision of her followers. This seems not *that* bad an idea.

This is my fault - - format issues with our AMP design, surely - - but where do you go with AMP spec being so vanilla and why bother really?
new readers who don't use AMP stay 13% more frequently for another story, stay on page 4x as long and see about half a page more on average
Created custom segments to control for "new users" which filters out our loyal users trained to avoid AMP. Still not a compelling case here. https://t.co/wjmVvN636R
last one is rightfully hard to say/prove/believe. visible new vs. return rate suggests  subscribers are likely non-AMP users and skew data

@mobile_reach @mathewi @robpegoraro I agree, just telling you how this plays out in when your property is a duopoly on digital advertising/publishing

@derekwillis @donohoe I'll look into forming an opinion. Had only gotten to the "that WSJ piece offers an interesting constructive dilemma for our industry" part
@digiphile We know what Sunlight does accept, and know it to be a sign of quality journalism funding free of conflicts; but we don't know its passes
@digiphile When Sunlight doesn't have Google News Fellow, but other groups do, is that a signal of conflict? Disclosing would rule out signaling risks
@digiphile They're amazing, high-bar-setting policies. I think they could perhaps be improved with what funding is rejected on those grounds. Heres why
If anyone's a Google shill it's me - my business is a Google Partner and I make a substantial sum of money selling its advertising
@digiphile Can you ask? "Sunlight, w/ clear no conflict policy, has never had to reject Google funding" would be evidence against potential conflicts
@derekwillis @donohoe If money buys influence, which is what we've always thought in our industry, I'm not sure how we can say that we're above that without proof
@derekwillis @donohoe Thought WSJ story as a line of thought applies equally to our research industry. "How dare you accuse us" is what scientists said to WSJ too
@derekwillis @donohoe Not sure, but as a reporter I'd probably start with following the money and seeing what's being produced as a result
@donohoe @derekwillis WSJ reporting logic has made some uncomfortable when applied to journalism but I didn't mean to suggest any outcomes or impact w/o research
@donohoe @derekwillis For the record, think Google using $ to influence outcomes is fine if not a good thing. Just meant to point out journalistic exceptionalism

@joshsternberg this is great!
@derekwillis Was thinking about comms profs, but was curious if Sunlight ever had to say no to Google funding. Noticed doesn't have a Google News Fellow
@derekwillis Others, perhaps. Sunlight has workflow to vet conflict of interests. My guess it that it would def say "no" where conflict may be perceived
@derekwillis Hip for journos to question role of corp sponsorship of sci research, but we seem unwilling to question if same applies to our profession
@derekwillis Don't have a problem with Google funding medical research either but but I also am willing to explore the role of its influence on outcomes
@derekwillis It's also historically been a good supporter of Sunlight's Transparency Camp, by the look of it. Nothing wrong with supporting journalism!
@digiphile Sunlight might make good example since doesn't accept gifts perceived as conflicts of interest. Has it ever declined Google-related funding?
