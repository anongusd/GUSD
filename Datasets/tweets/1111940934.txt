@AOC showing the House Dem caucus the things she can teach them not limited to social media. All members should be trained at how to ask the most short, incisive questions. Gasbagging of no value. https://t.co/c0fA7rZ8q7
It is fitting that Trump was humiliated in Hanoi.
A player is ostracized for voluntarily kneeling in support of victims while an owner is accused of victimizing trafficked women who were forced to kneel. #NFL.
The remedy for the real emergency we face needs to be seized on November 3, 2020.
Everyone who has a family member or friend who is not hardcore MAGA but supports Trump because of immigration, share this story with the them. And let’s hope some smart work is done by outside groups to bring the hypocrisy fully to life. https://t.co/msaUWPAagI
Want motivation to work hard leading up to ‘20? Could be just three major speeches left to endure - one more SOTU, Convention speech and Concession.

An Administration who is in power in part by falsely convincing those living paycheck to paycheck they would be their champion, demonstrating by the hour they have no clue what that really means.
Sure the State Duma will host on short notice.
Suborning perjury and openly practicing bigotry. https://t.co/GrWO0WigNJ

The day ends with much more likely collusion than construction.
Trump is starting to panic as the walls crash in on him. Imperative for Dems to be strong and frame this properly. There is nothing to negotiate. He’s holding country hostage because Mexico won’t pay for his wall. Stop the tantrum, government reopens.
An unpopular President forcing an unpopular shutdown over an unpopular demand. Saying and tweeting unpopular things. Let him stew Congressional Dems.
It's true, Mexico is not even paying 1/2020th for the steel slats.
With a tremendous  amount of hard work by millions of Americans committed to saving their democracy (and a nominee worthy of their time and talents), we will only have 2 more NYE to survive, and if so 2020 will be one for the ages.
The White House Situation Room is now essentially Trump’s Twitter account and asides with Stephen Miller and Fox chyrons.
11/03/20 is uncomfortably too long from now.
Last week I went to San Quentin purportedly to teach but all I did was learn. Better discussion on politics, advocacy and government behind those walls than most I had in Washington. We are proud at CZI to support The ⁦@PrisonUProject⁩ and the students in the program. https://t.co/mJFZW3eK9a

The magnitude of the problem with our criminal justice system comes into starker focus with this important new data. One of the larger shared experiences in America today is having a family member who has been incarcerated.  https://t.co/coyWlro3og

The President of the United States is openly and repeatedly calling for the legal votes of American citizens to be denied. And will again in 2020. Nothing is safe these next two years. Nothing.
His desire for authoritarian government - state run media, not counting votes, ending oversight - will only grow over the next 24 mos. It’s not a drill. https://t.co/2YmzrUASfx
Out of the ashes of 2016, it has been inspiring to see the large number of talented citizens seeking office not to make a career but a change. Whatever happens tonight, many will be serving in the halls of government for a time, and that’s undeniably a great thing for the US.

If you are interested in what is actually happening in the election, highly recommend Schale's analysis over the next two weeks. More Dem ballots out than Obama's FL margin in '12. Plenty of time but need those in.  https://t.co/vcT7C41Ifr

Supporters desperately want Beto to win - but more than anything they are inspired and want more people like him seeking high office.
After we lost the NH primary in 2008 our fundraising and volunteer activity soared. When grassroots vols and donors believe in a candidate and they know the candidate believes in them, setbacks and bad polls will not deter.

All too often the same is true is politics. Before assuming your competitors and opponents strategies are flawed, spend some time understanding why they think they are smart. https://t.co/LJPGtvZaJf
