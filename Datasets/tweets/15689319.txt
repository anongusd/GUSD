A5 Pt 2. It can be as simple as saying, “I haven’t seen you for a while. Is everything okay?”, “If you ever want to talk about your relationship, I’m here to listen.”, or “I’m worried about how your partner is treating you.” #TDVAM #ThankUNext
A5. When a survivor first shares their experiences of dating abuse, believe, listen, and support them. If there are red flags that a friend is in an abusive relationship, say something - express concern and help them identify the abusive behavior. #TDVAM #ThankUNext https://t.co/xlM4q9VD47

A2. Abuse is about power &amp; control and is cyclical.

If the victim doesn't do what abuser wants, then they're punished. #TDVAM https://t.co/FMnwhB24Qa

A1 Pt 3. Boundaries are your personal comfort limits. They can be digital, emotional, financial, material, sexual, or physical. #TDVAM
A1 Pt 2. On setting boundaries: Something one person may be comfortable with might be uncomfortable for someone else so make sure to check in with each other. Boundaries can change over time — ongoing communication is key. #TDVAM
A1. Healthy relationships should be based in mutual respect, support, compassion, and each other’s needs. Both partners should be able to feel safe and exude honesty, vulnerability, and trust! #TDVAM

D.C. has opportunity to make a difference for children of our city &amp; to stand as a leader nationwide. Only ten states currently mandate school policies around dating violence. By passing the Student Safety and Consent Act of 2018, you join those in the forefront. #Safety4Students
Waiting until a student gets to college is too long. Foundations for love &amp; respect, establishing boundaries, understanding what it means to give &amp; get consent – these are learned in childhood. If we educate them now, we'll create new culture of consent &amp; respect.#Safety4Students
This includes taking to students about the language they use that contributes to a toxic culture that allows abuse to occur and how to not only step up as an active bystander if they see a friend in need, but also how to respond if a friend discloses abuse. #Safety4Students
We can change what is happening now on college campuses if we provide age-appropriate education from K-12 to help young people begin to learn the concepts of establishing personal boundaries, showing respect, and giving and getting consent. #Safety4Students

Using religious freedom to justify discrimination for women and transgender patients goes against the separation of church and state that are the foundations of our country. #SOTU #TheRealSOTU #PutPatientsFirst #RxforDiscrimination
Congress + the Administration should focus on raising the minimum wage, mandating paid sick/safe days, and passing paid family leave legislation to help build long-term economic security. #SOTU #TheRealSOTU
Women today still face economic inequality and are under financial pressure because of rising childcare costs and stagnant wages. #SOTU #TheRealSOTU
With over 400 mass shootings in 2017, it’s unconscionable that gun safety legislation has not been passed. This should be a priority for lawmakers. #SOTU #TheRealSOTU
Around the world 1 in 3 women experience abuse in their lives. #IVAWA makes ending violence against women a top priority of the US, yet it was not mentioned in #SOTU #TheRealSOTU

We would like to thank the panelists and attendees for engaging in the panel on campus empowerment.
The ethos of leadership requires people to have an understanding of gender based violence. -Jess Davidson
Survivor support has to be an ongoing conversation rather than a one night event on campuses. -Erin McCullen #dialogue #care #mentalhealth
As an ambassador that cares about the issue of sexual assault, you have to approach this issue as an educator -Jess Davidson #knowyourIX
Men are survivors of sexual assault as well. We need to deconstruct the harmful gender norms that perpetuate violence. -Ariella Neckritz
We have to figure out what lever we can pull to organize in a way that allows us to reach different influencers. -Jess Davidson
Learn your rights. When it comes to Title IX, find out what your institution is responsible for. -Arielle Neckritz

Our panelists remind us that truly listening rather than waiting to talk is vital to policy making and politics in general.
"Sharing articles on Twitter and FB is not enough. We need to extend ourselves out into real and genuine conversation." -Radha Adhar
RT @nwlc: #DearBetsy: listen to survivors. https://t.co/maqkw7H9ql
"As women we must do want we want to do not what others want us to do." That is #politicalempowerment -Chelsea Wilson
"Don't go mentor shopping" urge our panelists. The relationship has to be organic.

"On the hill Women are far more likely to reach across the aisle and reach solutions." -Chelsea Wilson (@SheShouldRun)
"There is a great deal of common ground between the Senate Ds &amp; Rs. What you see on TV is only a part of the story. " -Radah Adhar
Our @SheShouldRun panelist saw a peak in numbers after the election. A hopeful sign of new members shows women are eager to run for office.
Our panelist, LA to Sen.Duckworth, said she was drawn to her office because she connected to the Senator's values and principles.
Our Advocacy fellow panelist said that discovering her skill set has helped her decide how she wants to engage politically.

"We don't have to engage in dehumanization in order to survive." -Sandra Kim
Often we don't know how to ask for what we want. How can we create a situation that is something we *do* consent to?
Talking about gaslighting with Sandra Kim. All forms of dehumanization are harmful, but power compounds it.
We dehumanize folks by wanting them to agree with us. When we try to coerce people, we don't honor that they can say no to us. -Sandra Kim

"We cut ourselves off from ourselves, our needs, our pain...We lose access to this power we have to choose how we want to behave." -S. Kim
Systemic oppression has taught us that the pain we feel isn't real, so we minimize it or blame ourselves.
"We have to start being vigilant about how we've actually been unconsciously conditioned to oppress and marginalize." -Sandra Kim
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. That's what oppression did, Sandra Kim says.
Oppression is systemic. "We weren't born thinking we weren't allowed to have our feelings...but we learned to do that over time," Kim says.

The #PaycheckFairnessAct would give the fight for #equalpay teeth. Here’s how: https://t.co/6j1S6zHi44 #EqualPayDay
The Equal Pay Act didn’t close the #wagegap. But, the #PaycheckFairnessAct can help—if we pass it. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would also create a negotiation skills training program for women &amp; girls. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct keeps working people from being punished for talking about pay. (Really. That’s a thing.) #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would make it easier for people getting unfair pay to participate in class action lawsuits. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would require employers to be transparent about pay from job to job. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would require courts to treat sex-based pay discrimination more seriously. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would ban questions about salary history during an interview. #EqualPayDay
The #PaycheckFairnessAct would recognize businesses that are pwning the #paygap. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/nkZPXuYfud
If businesses need help creating #equalpay friendly policies, the #PaycheckFairnessAct would provide it. #EqualPayDay
Thank you, @PattyMurray &amp; @rosadelauro for taking action on #EqualPayDay! Let's pay fair. Pass the #paycheckfairnessact.

"On all other nights – including this night – women in abusive relationships will find themselves at risk of being killed by a gun." #DV https://t.co/lU8OLT7CUm
Trans* survivors face barriers including fear, services that are woman-focused, not trans* friendly, or not culturally competent. #TDOV
Hundreds of thousands of transgender survivors have also experienced stalking. #TDOV
About half of transgender individuals experience #IPV/#DV at some point in their lives. #TDOV
It's hard to be sure, but rates of #sexualviolence seem to be somewhat higher for the transgender population (55-60%). #TDOV
Treat people with respect &amp; dignity. Listening skills are critical to serving all survivors, especially your transgender clients. #TDOV
There isn't one list of "right" words &amp; one list of "wrong" words. What's correct is how your client refers to themselves. Listen! #TDOV
Knowing which ?'s to ask is important when serving transgender survivors. The name on legal docs isn't always what you should use! #TDOV
Dividing your services based on a binary gender system is exclusionary to nonbinary survivors &amp; may make them uncomfortable. #TDOV #DV

Encourage victims to keep an incident log. Seeing it all written down can make it clear what's going on &amp; what potential risks are. #NSAM
You don't want to have to take the stand, so work with the victim &amp; let them know what they can do. Example: they should print the evidence.
Our gut reaction is to hit "delete," but we should encourage survivors &amp; victims to preserve evidence and document what's going on. #NSAM
It's not just knowing the tech. We need to do a better job of crafting the statutes that are getting passed, @SRC_NCVC Elaina Roberts says.
Combating technology-facilitated stalking tips: Believe the survivor. Find out what they want to have happen. Make use of existing tools.
Most tech has a digital trail. You may want to document that for law enforcement. But you can also adjust privacy &amp; security settings. #NSAM
There are resources to help you understand what kind of tech may be at play, and what laws may apply. Ask: What does the stalker know? #NSAM
Being "safe" can change rapidly &amp; there are challenges in safety planning. For example, tech is tough to keep up with. Trust survivors.
Stalkers may use social media to harass or defame (including by impersonation) in an effort to isolate the survivor. #NSAM
A stalker can pay attention to what a survivor is posting on social media, but it can also be used to defame or isolate victim. #NSAM

On smiles: Many of us have a natural frown. Even if you open your mouth a little, it's less severe (but not accidentally flirty). #YWLC16 😀🙂
Meryl Frank: Hold a pen. It gives you confidence and your hands will have something to do. #YWLC16
General advice from Meryl Frank: Stand up straight. Watch your hands. You don't want anything to distract us from your message! #YWLC16
"I'll agree with people if they're right," Meryl Frank says. "You have to do the right thing...Sometimes you stick your neck out." #YWLC16
"You always have to know your stuff," Meryl Frank says. "If they get you on the littlest thing, it's over...Do your homework." #YWLC16
How do we combat these issues when fake news can drown out a real story? Meryl Frank says she teaches kids how to spot nonsense. #YWLC16
One attendee asks "How do you get women over the fear of being smeared?" Meryl Frank: It'll happen, but don't react right away. #YWLC16
Public speaking wasn't a skill Frank had. But if you're straight about who you are/what you believe, confidence comes &amp; ppl respond. #YWLC16
The setting is different but issues women face are the same, Meryl Frank says: public speaking, body language, &amp; work-life balance. #YWLC16
"In politics, women get involved because they're angry about something," Meryl Frank says while sharing her story with #YWLC16 attendees. https://t.co/WQ42RCCo1P

Starting a nonprofit is brave &amp; scary. But you can't let that deter you if you truly believe in building a movement. -@ErinSchrode #YWLC16

In social justice, we need 2 stop working in silos. Strength in #s! We have opp now 2 join those strands &amp; fight as 1. -@NickyGoren #YWLC16
An attendee from @TheRAC asks, when you have an idea &amp; know it has legs, what're your next steps? How do you translate into action? #YWLC16

"Don't view capitalism as the enemy," Andrea Brem Wolf says. She couldn't do her work at @bremfoundation without corporate partners! #YWLC16
"I believe in capitalism and I believe in advocacy," Brem Wolf says. "The intersection of them is wildly exciting." #YWLC16
What's the beauty of #YWLC16? Braun Sherl says she's "literally taking notes of things I want to do next, based on ppl I met 2 hours ago."
That story utimately led to a collaboration with @I_Support_Girls. "@DanaMarlowe walks the way she talks!" Brem Wolf says. #YWLC16
Brem Wolf shares story about a breast cancer survivor who gave old bras to her housekeeper, who couldn't afford good ones that fit. #YWLC16
.@DanaMarlowe says her day job has nothing to do w/ bras &amp; periods, but homeless women are a hidden population &amp; need our help. #YWLC16
Imagine what getting caught without a tampon is like for low-income women. Every cycle presents that challenge. #YWLC16 @I_Support_Girls
"How many of you have gotten your period &amp; not had a product in your purse?" -@DanaMarlowe Nearly everyone in room raises their ✋🏼#YWLC16
Also, Brem Wolf says, an initial no might not be a no. Keep pushing when there's an opportunity! Sometimes those become much bigger. #YWLC16
Communicate: "I know that this matters to you, and here is why you should pick us." Human connection is important, Brem Wolf says. #YWLC16
"Have that personal connection...Don't just go into a meeting, esp. w/ another woman, &amp; just talk about what that meeting is about." #YWLC16
I think things go much more smoothly when they're pitched as a partnership rather than a handout," Andrea Brem Wolf says. #YWLC16
