@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Increase the pressure on Russia and China, arguably the only two countries that have any actual influence over NK, to support and push the despot regime to denuclearize. Instead we are easing up on both those countries and we just get played left and right by all three countries.

@GOP @KellyannePolls That’s a loose interpretation of what he actually said.
@seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC Stunt? Let’s not forget that the President brought all this drama on himself with his illicit behaviors and unhinged responses. The evidence is mounting.

@Stop_Trump20 Is he a liar? Yes. But I do agree a person can change and do the right thing. He’s going to prison. He has nothing more to lose.
@GOP @Jim_Jordan Jim Jordan is just disgusting. Vile human being.
@GOP Not one single @GOP members actually defended the President, all they did was attack the witness. I think that’s very telling. I agree Cohen is a liar, he’s plead guilty to that. I hope this means that the @GOP is realizing that the mounting evidence of crimes is indefensible.
@mattgaetz It doesn’t dismiss what you did and defended all day long. You still made what were clearly threats with an intent to intimidate a witness to possible crimes.

@Jim_Jordan I would venture to guess that there was strong feeling Trump was going to commit a crime that the government wanted evidence of. This is what law enforcement does. Law Enforcement is first sworn to protect the constitution, not the potential criminal acts of some idiot.
@RealMuckmaker Definitely not the Holy Spirit.

@DonaldJTrumpJr “Collusion” has become a false flag for this administration. Keep pointing to that when we can clearly see from Muller investigation that there are many crimes likely worse committed by Trump and cronies.

@al_boc @DailyCaller Agreed that collusion is not a crime, it’s a behavior. Sedition is overt, like making speeches and organizing. Did not happen. Treason is a reach considering legal definition is levying war against the US or providing aide and comfort to enemies. I appreciate the discourse.
@al_boc @DailyCaller Investigations are key if there is credible evidence a crime may have been committed. With Russia case, there was credible evidence, thus the indictments and guilty pleas. I’m not convinced there were crimes in DOJ discussing the 25th, but I do concur that it may merit scrutiny.
@al_boc @DailyCaller Also, I think what’s really going on with this “talk” right now is it makes for good book sales because it becomes red meat for the conspiracy theorist.
@al_boc @DailyCaller I do agree that dislike of a president is no grounds for action of that kind. Most of us probably don’t know what actually occurred to spark the conversation initially, but it would have taken the cabinet to actually follow through, which wouldn’t have happened.
@al_boc @DailyCaller The 25th amendment is part of the constitution. Having a conversation about it is one thing, actually invoking the provisions is another, which never happened. In any situation most people consider all their options and obviously they determined the 25th amendment was not one.
@DailyCaller I don’t think a discussion amounts to a coup. If that is the case the majority of Americans would be plotting a coup daily on this administration.

All that was added were the finishing touches over the last few weeks.
@RepMarkMeadows Declaring a national emergency is a HUGE gift to the Democrats. Like Joe Biden once said, “this is a big f**king deal.”
@Newsweek So let’s be clear, the report exonerates the students from spoken words, but not their actions and behavior. How does that saying go, “judge me not by my words but by my actions.”

@SecNielsen @DHSgov The president didn’t want to hear about it either based on the way he spent the whole time trashing generals and senators of his own party.

@DonaldJTrumpJr I think you missed the point of the article.
