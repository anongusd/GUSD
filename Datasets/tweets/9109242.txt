@WentRogue If the article were about a Christian pastor who incorporates social justice themes into their weekly Bible study group, would you be upset the magazine is pushing creationism?
@WentRogue It's a piece on social justice in the "culture and conversation/human rights" section. Does the article say astrology is a science? Or is it about how she brings social justice to this subset of our culture (a subset that Nazis and white supremacists are working hard to coopt)?
