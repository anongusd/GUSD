RT @Gwyneth10000: Gulp! Yep I'm seriously speechless. @wendy_harmer Meeting my hero. *blush* @BlokesLib
Thanks @wendy_harmer I really should update it. I actually work with @Gwyneth10000 nowadays. Head up her company. Note to self. Fix profile.
Love your work @wendy_harmer. Thanks for the hello!
RT @wendy_harmer: .@Gwyneth10000 @BlokesLib Consider yourself speechless... both you ratbags wx  (sorry)
OMG it's my hero @wendy_harmer! I think  @Gwyneth10000 will be speechless! LOL You really should check her out Wendy. Amazing woman.
It's so much easier to not age if you don't change your pic @dmbrown111. Are you managing to keep out of trouble over there?
LOL @Gwyneth10000 let me know if it ever happens. I follow @wendy_harmer she writes some good stuff. She seems sympathetic of men.
RT @Gwyneth10000: LOL @BlokesLib alas it's true. I've been trying to get a hello from @wendy_harmer for months. Think I'd be speechless if ‚Ä¶
Hello to the beautiful @dmbrown111 it has been a while. You havn't changed a bit. LOL  ;-)
That elusive radar eh @Gwyneth10000
Sleep well @ClaireBoyles
So proud of you @Pattycam there is no stopping you. Have a great day!
I don't blame you @Boddingtons we do make a dammed good team. Popping at double time. Lol
Are you up to anything special nowadays @Pattycam ?
RT @Pattycam: @BlokesLib I can only agree. :)  It's what gets me up in the morning.  I don't want to live a boring life, I want to live lif‚Ä¶
RT @Pattycam: @MegfromCT @BlokesLib I film dead people so yeah I totally get Live your life NOW. :)
Thanks @Pattycam I am proud of the achievements. Am honoured to be part of the team. Learning so much.
RT @MegfromCT: @BlokesLib @Pattycam Only got the one life....got to do as much as you can as long as you are able!  Savor all the moments :‚Ä¶
Oh I love that @MegfromCT
Precisely @ClaireBoyles when my son was a baby I was so stressed listening to all of the advice. In the end made my own decisions @Pattycam
RT @MegfromCT: @Pattycam @BlokesLib Don't ask why, ask why not!
From what I know of you @Pattycam you have a loooong history of doing what most wouldn't dream of. ;-)
Oh @Pattycam in recent times I've become a specialist at the impossible. The brand is now in 91 countries &amp; international media continually.
RT @Pattycam: @MegfromCT @BlokesLib Damm right!  My best motivation is someone telling me "It can't be done." Oh?  Watch me. #stubborn
RT @Pattycam: @BlokesLib I gave a speech at International Women's Day lunch saying we can all eat an elephant one mouthful at a time.
Hello my friend @MegfromCT I can't see you ever stopping either. @Pattycam
My advice @ClaireBoyles, ignore the lobby groups &amp; so called experts. As with most things, the truth is usually in the middle. @Pattycam
Oh you know what I am like @Pattycam I bite off more than I can chew. Then chew like hell. Hey, we only have one life!
Oh I've be insanely busy @Pattycam. Nowadays I oversee http://t.co/NkT2Q4WBeg sorting promos and media and marketing etc.
Hello my friend @Pattycam I havn't seen you in ages!
Oh wow @ClaireBoyles that's so very cool to know. Life is indeed good. Rest well.
RT @ClaireBoyles: @BlokesLib wooo hooo!! I have to rest- I have a Tiny Human growing inside me taking my energy these days :) http://t.co/D‚Ä¶
That's the plan @ClaireBoyles! I am at my best of a morning so watch me go! Sleep well my friend. Dream of prosperous times. :-)
Hello over there @ClaireBoyles! I do hope your day is an enjoyable one. Just coming to life here.  @Boddingtons
"@Gabbylicious7: @BlokesLib i hope so, i miss u!!!! My tl is not the same without you."&lt;~Well we'd better do something about that!
I have to admit @Boddingtons I became a bit bored with Facebook. It can get a bit ho hum after a while.
RT @justashley: @BlokesLib I totally believe you lol seriously I really do
RT @Gwyneth10000: Thank you @BlokesLib.
I pop up in the strangest of places don't I @Boddingtons! I've certainly missed twitter. All OK over there?
Thanks @Gabbylicious7 it's nice to be needed! Have a fun filled day over there!
Hope you had a great sleep @sunshinedebbie1. It's funny how difficult it can be to switch off sometimes.
Now that's beautiful @kimindaup!
Be sure to follow @Gwyneth10000. This woman is astonishing. Her life story is currently being talked about in almost every country!
A huge thanks to everyone who caught up for a chat. Love my twitter friends. Off to sleep here. Thanks for the smiles. Thanks to all.
It's been so long hasn't it @Gabbylicious7. I do have to go shortly as it is 2am but I can assure you that I will be back very soon!
The feeling is mutual @kimindaup. Stay well over there!
Not to mention someone's idea of a cruel joke @gemswinc! :-) @lizsavery
Oh yes @sunshinedebbie1 very much a good word. The world could do with a few more subtle people! So glad I could help.
I can't hang around too long @kimindaup as it is after 2am, but I can assure you that I will be here more. Looking forward to a good chat.
Oh Kim my world has been a frantic of late @kimindaup but I am back. Time to give Blokeslib some long overdue attention hey.
Subtle means to be gently done, quietly with no fuss @sunshinedebbie1. I like the word subtle..
Yep you're most certainly weird @junglejanet but hey, keeping the status quo isn't exactly fun though. Well done on your choice to be weird.
Let's face it @gemswinc being human is hard enough. Both sexes have their challenges hey. @lizsavery
Oh @sunshinedebbie1 I had commitments that needed me to stay up late. Trust me the call of my pillow isn't all that subtle at the moment.
It's a challenge @gemswinc! I guess it explains why our brain isn't as active as that of a female hey. LOL @lizsavery
I think us guys need to find more inventive ways to be sexy @junglejanet.
Oh @sunshinedebbie1 in my world. Twitter is a blur of foggy letters though my sleep deprived eyes. Even then you look great! ;-)
I guess with Twitter at 2am one need never be lonely.
Oh God @junglejanet such an image would keep me awake for days. LOL
RT @junglejanet: @BlokesLib not if they're sporting builders bum...
Oh @lizsavery I've learned just enough about women to know that I wouldn't last 5 minutes as one!
Good point @VeryBritishDude! @Liight_ning
Come to think of it. I'm not even sure that women understand women.
RT @Liight_ning: The cyclone derives its powers from a calm center.  So does a person.  -Norman Vincent Peale
Pondering...Is it a good look when guys twerk?
Oh @justashley I've been busily staying out of trouble. You believe me don't you?
Hey my friend @Boddingtons I've been away for so long. How are you?
I used to live in Brisbane quite a few years ago @KarenDFrancis. I still feel at home when I visit. Even though I get lost nowadays. LOL
Oh I remeber Ekka @KarenDFrancis, it's been a loooong time though. Are you going to it?
LOL @KarenDFrancis you know me well. Are you doing ok up there?
Would you believe @KarenDFrancis I'm behaving myself?
G'day my friends.
He sure is! ;-) @mandiebear @Gabbylicious7
Hi my friend @mandiebear. How are you? Am so tired here, can barely think straight. :-)
I haven't seen it @FrantzJeanPierr but I must admit to being curious. Let me know how you go when you do eh.
Awoke today with the Beetles song `Let It Be' running around in my head.
Have you seen Captain America yet @FrantzJeanPierr? Was it any good?
What's my good friend @mandiebear up to today?
Thank you @Myme_shell. On that note I must bow out. It is Tuesday Am here and a day of adventure awaits. Have a good day!
Hey thanks for the retweet @sabrinablogs!
Hey I work with women @Myme_shell I need to get my message across in as few words as I can during the short moments of peace I get. ;-)
I have the absolute best followers in the world. No doubt about it.
Agreed @Trazlersgal No wonder I like you.
Perhaps twitter is Facebook' smoking room @Myme_shell LOL
I use Facebook occasionally @Myme_shell but to be honest I find it restricting. Give me twitter any day.
Thanks @HazelKLarkin!
Thanks @Trazlersgal. I just don't understand negative people.
Yer it's a true story @Myme_shell. A remarkable one. I am looking after media for her. Keeps me busy!
I am certainly a man @HazelKLarkin and like any man, I get a lot of satisfaction out of being called sexy. ;-)
Thanks @HazelKLarkin. Keep an eye on Fearlessfemale.me I will have a Man Cave section on there in around a week. Men supporting women.
I like being a positive person @Trazlersgal, there's no room for negativity in my life.
RT @Trazlersgal: @BlokesLib lol No I think you are just a very positive thinker Peter! I hope you have a fab week! :)
Hey thanks for the retweet @HazelKLarkin it's very much appreciated!
In reality @Myme_shell I am currently assisting with arranging media for a book called 10000 Men and Counting by an associate of mine.
I have learned enough about women to know that I wouldn't last a day as one.
I actually kind of like Mondays. They represent a fresh start full of possibilities. Yer I know, I must be sick.
Oh @Myme_shell I may just eat chips, watch TV and scratch myself.
Why can't my computer be more like the one on the Enterprise?
Gee @Myme_shell if I were to star in an adventure film I am pretty sure it'd end up like a comedy.
I must be getting old @justashley. Nowadays I value sleep as much as dinner.
Oh @justashley my sleep pattern is all over the place. Grabbed a 10 min nap against the wall yesterday.  LOL
"@mlfsnt1: @BlokesLib @Colvinius wow! a car that runs on the force"&lt;~Love it!
Thanks @Myme_shell I must admit I was looking forward to scaling mountains and beating my chest up top. LOL
Phew. I was worried about that @NizaMariaa. Tis a good thing that twitter is 100% private eh.
Yer @fantasyauthor still in Tassie. Love the quiet pace of Tassie.
I am glad someone noticed I was gone @fantasyauthor LOL. I guess I do make an impact.
Oh cool @fantasyauthor I bad a quick peek then. Will follow when I am off my phone a d on my computer lately.
Oh @mandiebear nowadays I am working with @Gwyneth10000. Am looking after the marketing of @10kMenCounting. Lots of time on the phone.
Shh don't tell anyone @NizaMariaa I have a reputation to live down to.
Oh @NizaMariaa I am doing my best to stay out of trouble. Remarkably quite successfully I must say.
I am so chuffed to see that you are doing ok with your books. It is very much your passion. @fantasyauthor
Ah @fantasyauthor the website knows more than I do. Lol. http://t.co/nJyri2Plo3
Hey thanks for the RT @NizaMariaa it's very much appreciated. I do hope you are well.
Are you still in the pizza industry @mandiebear?
@fantasyauthor the book @10kMenCounting is about a lady trying to escape sex industry. Rags to riches story. Became pilot. Amazing person.
Hi @sabrinablogs pleased to meet you. Hey thanks for the RT. It's appreciated!
Hey pleased to meet you @Garnet_Shouse!
Oh @fantasyauthor it's actually a true story. It certainly gets people talking. I spend much of my days coordinating media etc.
LOL @fantasyauthor @Myme_shell I am not quite that rugged. Lol
Oh I can understand that @MNMissy family has to come first. What are you doing nowadays?
Oh wow @fantasyauthor you have been busy! I will be sure to peek. Ever so proud of you. You worked so hard at it.
Ah you are just in time @justashley. Can you sleep for me too? No time here.
Well it's nice to know I am not the only one working my ass off @MNMissy. What happened to the Darla Show?
Sine we last chatted @fantasyauthor I took up branding and marketing responsibilities for @10kMenCounting.
Oh running around like mad @MNMissy. Am heading up branding and marketing for @10kMenCounting. You will like this book. ;-)
Had to put the filming aside for a bit @fantasyauthor @Myme_shell. It was delayed by 2 years.
How's the book going @fantasyauthor? Did you get it done?
Hello my friend Darla. It has been a while. What are you up to nowadays @MNMissy?
I want one... http://t.co/3z6w0g1Qwh
Very good indeed @mandiebear. I hear you have been a little unwell of late. Are you ok now?
"@fantasyauthor: @BlokesLib @Myme_shell hello dolls long time..."&lt;~Certainly has. All good in your world?
I have a habit of always feeling a little warmer inside after your tweets @mandiebear :-)
RT @mandiebear: @BlokesLib *snuggle snuggle snuggle snuggle snuggle snuggle snuggle*
"@elizabethrydan: @BlokesLib Long time,no see!"&lt;~Miss me? :-)
Oh @Myme_shell I have been a bit distracted of late. It is sure good to be back. Twitter is like home to me. :-)
"@Boddingtons: @BlokesLib you are up way to early"&lt;~There's no stopping me! Lol
Thank you @justashley! What is life like in your world?
Tis about 5am here @Boddingtons. Tweeting through blurry eyes!
It's my favourite bubble wrap lady @Boddingtons! Are you keeping out of trouble over there my friend?
Would you believe I am keeping out of trouble @justashley?
Just discretely peeking around the corner into twitter land. :-)
My pillow is gently whispering my name. I am out of here. Will the last one to leave twitter please turn out the lights!
I sent them back @justashley, they were the wrong colors :-)
Enjoy yourself over there @lizloz. Life is a blessing. Make the most of it eh!
In regard to large twitter follower rates @lizloz. As they say... Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups. LOL
There's no pulling the wool over your eyes @justashley!
It's about time @lizloz, why should we have all of the dangerous animals? Perhaps an international trade agreement should be formulated. LOL
It's been great to catch you @justashley. I'll be out of here in a few minutes. No coffee here. My pillow is whispering my name.
Mmmm with that in mind @lizloz, kicking them may prove to be dangerous...for you! Perhaps keep it for stomping spiders.
Ah my friend @TheMoufia it's been a crazy busy day today. I will be really boring &amp; fall into my bed in 10 minutes.I must be getting old!
LOL @TheMoufia I am a Cinematographer by trade so I have the filming covered! What are you up to this evening?
You'd want to be careful not to accidently kick the kids @lizloz. They'd go flying 100 yards.
Sounds good to me @TheMoufia, perhaps The Misfits?
Oh @justashley you officially have me blushing ... that's something to be proud of. It's usually the girls who manage that.
I do hope you are not in too much pain @lizloz. You don't realize how much you use a part of your body until it's imobilized.
Chocolate factories @justashley? Now I'm curious. Ah my friend I have been away for a while. Loving catching up with my family of twits. :-)
Ah @lizloz the more followers, the more pressure to live down to my online reputation. Ahhh the pressure! ;-)
I guess like attracts like @TheMoufia hence you are chatting with me. You poor person!
To be honest @lizloz I've been away from twitter for quite some time. Is you life still maintaining a huge smile on your face?
Look at all of those people outside @TheMoufia. They are mostly ordinary people living ordinary lives. Conforming to normality is over rated
Wow! Do my eyes deceive me? Can it be? Is it really @lizloz?
It's amazing how losing electricity can strike more fear into my heart than almost anything. First thought ... what if my phone dies?
Yes you do sound insane @TheMoufia. Isn't that fantastic! Who'd want to be ordinary anyway? We only live once.
Hello my good friend @justashley, I guess it's safe to assume that you are still causing havoc over there! :)
LOL That may be easier @TheMoufia, on a bad day I look like graffiti anyway! LOL How are you? Are you doing ok?
If it's ok with you @TheMoufia I'd rather not be the corner. The local dog seems to pee on each &amp; every one it finds.
Ah @TheMoufia so I need to learn to look like the corner. To BE the corner! LOL
Just peeking around the corner..... I hope I'm not spotted. :-)
Gotta run all. Breakfast awaits. Loved catching up with friends. C ya.
"@dmbrown111: @BlokesLib well thank you... Cheers to you and all your awesomeness!"&lt;&lt;You forgot modesty too. Lol
"@WebGrrrrl: @BlokesLib *grin* I have every confidence you wouldn‚Äôt!"&lt;&lt;Let's give it a go and see! *chuckle*
You too @FrantzJeanPierr. Keep well and stay in touch. Cheers.
"@mandiebear: @BlokesLib Such a great reputation, too...Lol"&lt;&lt;I worked awful hard to lower it to where it is now. Lol
Proud of you @dmbrown111. Wishing you all the best. Cheers!
Indeed @WebGrrrrl I like to think I wouldn't evolve into an asshole over night. Lol
Don't you stop kicking back @dmbrown111, it's your body &amp; you choose to be disease free. Be strong eh!
Mmm @WebGrrrrl let's face it. We'd all like to try our hand at being filthy rich. Imagine how it'd affect the choices you make daily.
Yup @FrantzJeanPierr it's an honour to be alive. A privilege not to be taken lightly. It is indeed a beautiful world. Stay safe my friend.
Ah @WebGrrrrl I am absolutely raring to go. Well I would be if I could fit in a weeks sleep.
Ah its first up Saturday morning here @dmbrown111. A sluggish start to the day. Body wants to rest I think.
Hey I have a reputation to live down to @mandiebear!
Great to hear @FrantzJeanPierr, I guess we get what we focus on eh. Life is full of blessings.
Hello my friend @dmbrown111. You are a tad far for a hug. Would you settle for a kiss blown across the ocean? Lol.Great to see you my friend
Oh you know me @mandiebear, always on my best behaviour.
Is your world looking up @FrantzJeanPierr?
Gday @WebGrrrrl. Has much changed in your life during my absence from Twitter?
It sounds pretty perfect to me @selahvtoday. Have a fun filled day over there.
My friend @mandiebear! It's always good to see you! You misbehaving over there?
Oh my friend @FrantzJeanPierr I have been so very busy working. Great to be back among friends.
My wish list. A twitter feed along the bottom on my sunglasses.
It is great to be back @goaliemom31 missed the team here. Are you keeping out of trouble?
I do hope you are having a great day @selahvtoday!
I've been away a while. The place hasn't changed much. Love what you've done with the tweets!
All the better for hearing from you @mandiebear ... A warm hug never goes astray.
RT @Gabbylicious7: @BlokesLib I can't belive its u my dear friend! Miss u!&lt;-It is ever so good to be back. You behaving over there?
RT @Partyaficionado: Me too RT @BlokesLib: Call me old fashioned but I still prefer Twitter over Facebook.&lt;-Agreed. Twitter rocks!
Lets face it @RSRigda twitter is way more interactive than facebook. :)
RT @VIPVirtualSols: ‚Äú@BlokesLib: Call me old fashioned but I still prefer Twitter over Facebook.‚Äù - So do I :)&lt;-I'm in good company then. ;)
RT @missingbits: @VIPVirtualSols @BlokesLib smarter, more intelligent people on twitter too&lt;-No doubt! LOL
Oh you know me @justashley it takes a bit to stop me. Been away filming. You ok way over there?
Oh @officiallyaspie what can I say mate. I'm working hard and managing to stay out of trouble. How about you?
Hi @imwebgurl. In regard to @cherluvya are you ok? Thank you for passing on the sad news. She will be very much missed.
RT @imwebgurl: @BlokesLib Sad news to pass on... @cherluvya passed away a few days ago &lt;-I am very sad to hear that. A brave &amp; strong woman.
RT @FrantzJeanPierr: @BlokesLib I lost a good friend of mine that I will never get back. &lt;-What happened my friend?
Happy Bathurst Day. :) #Bathurst
Precisely @twiteryeanot ...anyway I have to run my friend. Dinner to prepare. Keep well over there!
RT @twiteryeanot: @BlokesLib if you refined me, you'd get a lot of rendered fat...&lt;-ROFL.
I have to admit @twiteryeanot I am certainly not 'physically' refined. LOL
LOL @twiteryeanot that is indeed true. It is clever, very clever ... but too darned slow for me. I get bored with it fast.
I have to agree @twiteryeanot, I just find Facebook boring by comparison.
Call me old fashioned but I still prefer Twitter over Facebook.
Hey @officiallyaspie it's been a while eh!
I can't immediately think of anyone @Stargazer49 but I will keep my eye out. We must look out for each other eh.
Oh @FrantzJeanPierr I had a pretty hectic weekend. Thank God for work where I can rest! ;) How are you my friend?
@mandiebear @Ivysunny Hope you two are keeping well over there on the other side of the world.
It is so hard to get out of bed on a cold and rainy morning.
Oh my friend @FrantzJeanPierr I have been filming in isolated regions. Excited to have wifi again! You ok?
Oh @mizzhelena just when I think I have you women worked out, you go &amp; change on me.
Ah @DvinMsM I am filming in the middle of a desert at the moment. Near Alice Springs. Central Australia.
"@DvinMsM: @BlokesLib keep out of trouble. Never. How about u?"&lt;~Trouble is my middle name. Lol

It is so good to hear from you @Boddingtons.Am calling it a night here. Keep well over there! Send me warm thoughts.
Where I live @Boddingtons it rarely snows, but the mountain range is 20 minutes away. They are covered in snow. Looks beautiful!
Am relieved that your operation was a success @Boddingtons .
It's really really cold here at present @Boddingtons no shortage of snow!
Filming is proceeding along nicely @Boddingtons .Am enjoying seeing so much of the country. Are you doing ok over there? Any news?
To be honest @Boddingtons I have been using Windows since Windows was invented. Mac always seemed alien to me.
After years with a Mac @Boddingtons I went back to Windows. Thus far I am liking WIndows 8. Still getting used to it though.
Had a computer melt down @Boddingtons had to transition over to a new machine. That's about the limit of my excitement! LOL
Oh @FrantzJeanPierr it certainly is!
Hi my friend @Boddingtons I do hope you are keeping well over yonder!
AHH @Channel7. Why move @MoleAustralia to 9:30. Later time=less family viewers. Convinced Channel 7 is The Mole! #TheMoleAU #Sabotage

Oh @officiallyaspie I am full of youth, vigor and vitality. Ok &amp; just enough Bull**** to make such a claim.
Back at ya times 10 @mandiebear !!
You may well be correct @drnareshbabbar. Agreed.
At Hobart Airport awaiting my flight.
Hey my fantastic, great, amazing, good looking, intelligent etc. friend @mandiebear how are you this fine day?
A huge G'day to you too my friend @FrantzJeanPierr
RT @alirent: @BlokesLib Life, and Twitter feed, is too fast, I agree!&lt;-There's just no keeping up some days!
I wish #Tweetdeck would let me refresh my main timeline in 1 minute intervals. Live is too fast.
Photographic evidence of me reading instructions @elizabethrydan ? LOL It's not gunna happen! *chuckle*
Oh @Nic1971 it's snowing just a few miles up the road from here. I need more than my socks! ROFL
Thanks mate. It's been a learning curve @justashley but I'm mastering it. :)
RT @AndreaMueller10: @BlokesLib Whoo hoo! The power, the power!&lt;-At the time I couldn't imagine needing more than 128k. How things changed.
Oh @mcdeetheshow1 &amp; @brianjbaby in the end I found a product caled start8 that puts the start button back in Windows 8. Handy!
It seems a lifetime ago @AndreaMueller10 I upgraded to a Commodore 128D. With 128k RAM I felt on top of the world!
RT @BrianJBaby: @BlokesLib google top 30 Window 8 tweeks..it'll save you some energy&lt;-Thanks mate. Will do. Appreciated.
My argument with Apple Stores @BrianJBaby is that they seem to want vast amounts of cash to do almost anything.
Lets see if I have any hair left in a few days @BrianJBaby
Oh yes @I had a commodore 64. Also a Tandy TRX 80 I think. Used to store files on cassette tape. We've come a long way!
Excellent suggestion @mcdeetheshow1 I have a feeling I'll need it as I fumble my way to being a professional. LOL
Precisely @BrianJBaby .Initially it felt like a billboard for Microsoft. LOL
Agreed @khoki I think at the end of the day they all have their advantages if you invest the time learning how to get the most out of them.
I may end up being the first man in history to read instructions @mcdeetheshow1 :)
It sure is cold @Nic1971 I am in Hobart today. Not sure I can feel my toes. :)
RT @BrianJBaby: @BlokesLib @mcdeetheshow1 windows 8 is hella annoying at times &lt;-Sure is. It seems needlessly complicated.
To be honest @mcdeetheshow1 I shouldn't judge Windows 8 until I have invested time into learning how it thinks. A tad confusing though :)
You do indeed have a point there @irocubabe gee when I used my first PC it was DOS 3.1. LOL Now that seems a lifetime ago.
After a lifetime of Windows XP, I am now adjusting to Windows 8. Not sure if I like it better than XP.
My little #Apple #MacBook Pro computer stopped working last night. I am afraid it's terminal.
I am sitting at a hotel @mandiebear awaiting a client.  So far I am managing to resist the alcohol... Just.
That is fantastic @mandiebear you must be so excited.
How is ya @mandiebear!
Thanks for the RT my friend @TheRealCManning

Ok all. Gotta run. Have a big drive ahead of me. Stay well everyone.
LOL @Ivy_Pixie_Girl oh I see the attraction. I see why wifi is simply not needed in that situation.
Oh I have spent a lifetime being the responsible upstanding one @mandiebear perhaps it's time for a change. LOL
Works for me @Ivy_Pixie_Girl just make sure the remote secluded beach has wifi.
Good point @mandiebear I am quiet &amp; cautious by nature &amp; people sit up &amp; take notice when I go wild. :-)
I kind of like online life @Ivy_Pixie_Girl often it's more fun than the real thing.
Sometimes I think it'd be fun to live down to my reputation.
Where's the fun in being mild mannered @mandiebear!  Lol
Oh my friend @mandiebear I am raring to take on the day ahead. I do hope you are causing havoc there.
Up at half past ridiculous preparing for a day of driving. Good thing I enjoy a good drive.
Our little island certainly doesn't have the biggest population in the world @mandiebear I like it peaceful.
Hiya @FrantzJeanPierr I do hope your day is perfect.
There are times in life @Ivy_Pixie_Girl in which invisible is just perfect!
Oh @Boddingtons I do hope you are doing well at the gym. It can be hard work can't it.
G'day my friend @Ivy_Pixie_Girl I do hope you are creating havoc over there!
Australia is rated best place to live and work for third year running http://t.co/1FqIHwOJlP
I need to find a way to work while I am sleeping. Never seem to get everything done.
Mmm @mandiebear where I live traffic jams are rare. Usually ten minutes delay we consider a disaster.
Psst @Boddingtons I hope you are misbehaving over there!
Careful what you think, you are listening.
If this traffic was to go any slower we'd be driving in reverse.
There's few things in life I value more than loyalty. Loyalty is rare &amp; should be recognised &amp; rewarded.
Oh @MegfromCT sounds perfect. I will be flying much of today. In transit.
Ah @zaneology sometimes I reckon my best friends are indeed the ones I communicate with here. Hands across the oceans.
Oh @lttlewys you and I both know that I am pretty darned close to being a saint.
Ah yes @MegfromCT I suffer too from hayfevor. Thankfully it is Autumn here. Beautiful.
"@Boddingtons: @BlokesLib awesome thank you :)))) xx"&lt;~The things I do for you. Sheesh !  ;-)
Oh @lttlewys would you believe I am behaving myself?
Oh @MegfromCT I have been too busy of late to cause too much havoc here. Raring to go. You ok way over there?
"@zaneology: #DITTO! RT @BlokesLib: I have the BEST followers in the world!"&lt;~I insist. It is mine who are best! LOL
Oh @lttlewys you are indeed good for my ego.
While I must admit to a little Facebook on the side, Twitter is where my heart is.
I have the BEST followers in the world!
You look after yourself @FrantzJeanPierr the world needs you at the best you can be.
"@MrAlligator: @BlokesLib I can explicate goalies."&lt;~rather efficiently I'd expect.
You are in for a great tomorrow @Boddingtons I have already been there.
Yer @Boddingtons it is time to drag my lazy ass from bed and attack the day ahead.
"@MrAlligator: Is it true that @BlokesLib altered my behavior"&lt;~I shudder to learn how!
Oh @Boddingtons it is always nice to see you.
Oh my friend @Boddingtons it is Monday morning here. Now to convince my body to get moving.
Hey my good friend @Boddingtons I do hope you are misbehaving over there!
How's life in your world @FrantzJeanPierr?
Oh @Gabbylicious7 I have a feeling that you make a fantastic grandmother.
My life is just one big adventure. So much to learn.  So much to accomplish.
Hey @mandiebear hows life at your end of this chunk of rock?
Hey my friend @Gabbylicious7 I do hope you are keeping those aliens under control.
Do you know how long before you can work again @mandiebear?
In regard to bloodline @Gabbylicious7 it is reassuring to know that part of us live on ager we are gone.
Oh @justashley that's my idea of heaven.
I hate incomplete thoughts. They are so
Hang in there my friend @mandiebear I had no idea of your difficulties. Th	inking of you.
Mmmm pondering. Should I get an Ipad or perhaps an android compatible device? Mmm
@blokeslib got a grade of 100/100 on @grader.  Twitter elite. Check it out:  http://t.co/M4UFsyCIK5
It's scary how dependent we are on money isn't it @mandiebear .
RT @Gabbylicious7: @BlokesLib and its even more impressive when you realize that ur blood line keeps going on.&lt;-Excellent point.
I don't know about you @justashley but I have opted for some Chinese food this evening. Yum!
Wow @mandiebear how have you managed to survive with no work?
Quite comfortable @justashley should be mid 20s. Celsius of course!
Are you up to much @mandiebear?
I am in a remote country town preparing for some filming @justashley.  Lovely river here.
You've certainly been a friend for a long time @mandiebear.
I have to admit @Gabbylicious7 there is nothing like the birth of a child to put everything into perspective.
Yep @justashley I am a little more rested and the world looks rosey! Tis finally the weekend.
Oh @officiallyaspie I am so sad to hear about your grandfather. Such a sad time for all in your family.
Hello my friend @officiallyaspie I do hope you are doing ok over there.
You a Grandmother @Gabbylicious7? How is that possible?
Ah @Gabbylicious7 I must admit the best part of some days is when I finally get to fall into bed.
You have an excellent point @FrantzJeanPierr I could be a great cook if I took the time to learn.
Oh @FrantzJeanPierr the world would be a pretty boring place if everyone cooked as poorly as I do. Lol.
Baseball eh @justashley. I have never been to a game. It is particularly nonexistent here. Looks cool.
Thanks @Gabbylicious7 I must admit I slept like a rock last night myself.
Oh @justashley I am running around like a mad man of late. So much to do. So little time. You ok there?
Hey thanks for the RT @imhoneymae it was very much appreciated.  Cheers!
Have you ever noticed the amount of time self centred people spend complaining about self centred people?
Oh @FrantzJeanPierr I must admit I am a pretty ordinary cook.
Oh @mandiebear I must admit I am working just a wee bit too hard. How did you know?
I had a great Easter @FrantzJeanPierr I got to spend quality time with those who are special to me.
LOL @Gabbylicious7 I do hope I am right too. I really do.
We get what we focus on @Gabbylicious7. Imagine the power behind billions focused on good. We can steer future generations.
So you should be @Boddingtons I am not the normal run of the mill person you know!
For as long as I am breathing I refuse to accept that a race as smart &amp; adaptive as humans is doomed . We can change. @Gabbylicious7
"@Gabbylicious7 u should be a speaker for the cause u have an amazing way to talk to ur followers, why dont u give it a try?",&lt;~Im just me:)
I'd do that @Boddingtons ROFL on Easter Egg wrappers.
Agreed @Gabbylicious7 it will take some time for the world to grow up &amp; accept there's a better way of doing things eh.
The net has for the first time given billions of us a chance to reach out, connect &amp; get to know those we once feared.
Ok @Boddingtons it may be a tad kinky but hey none of us are perfect. LOL
Wouldn't it be nice if in this new 'connected' world if people got together &amp; refused to fight stupid wars. @Gabbylicious7
Oh @mandiebear you are very much speaking my language. No wonder I call you friend. :-)
There's a lot of good in the world too but it rarely grabs the headlines. Spread the word! @Gabbylicious7
Oddly @Gabbylicious7 I believe this new 'connected' world has an opportunity to spread love like never before.
"@Boddingtons: @BlokesLib I have never!  lol ... you sniff them then?"&lt;~It's addictive but still legal LOL
Am doing a lot of travelling of late @mandiebear. More time driving &amp; less time barefoot at the beach.
Oh silly me. Fancy putting 'behave'  &amp; @mandiebear in the same sentence!
Oh @Boddingtons have noticed how good Easter Egg foil wrappers smell?
The world van be a scary place can't it @Gabbylicious7
Oh @Gabbylicious7 I have come to the realisation that as times get more scary we need to access what's really important in our life.
"@DickAmateur: #YouTube Australian Remote Safari Trailer. Found thanks to @BlokesLib  http://t.co/y6y3gryM7n"&lt;~Exciting it's so close.
Hi @papawu1 thanks for the @Kred reference. How are you my good friend?
Have you noticed how much time self centred people spend complaining about self centred people?
Howdie my good friend @mandiebear I do hope you are not behaving too much over there.
When it's all said &amp; done there is little more valuable than family. @Gabbylicious7
My iPhone stops randomly &amp; my S3 reboots on its own. Contemplating 2 cans &amp; string.
I got to spend time with the family @Gabbylicious7 which was about everything I could have hoped for. Enjoyable.
Hey my friend @FrantzJeanPierr I do hope you had an absolutely fantastic Easter.
Did you have a great Easter my friend @Gabbylicious7?
Oh @Gabbylicious7 those aliens really take some understanding sometimes don't they. ;-)
Hello to you too my dear friend @FrantzJeanPierr
Oh @Aimeevacations I must admit I love #Melbourne it has no shortage of variety.
You look after yourself @Boddingtons .. am running to catch a flight so will catch up with you later. Take care my friend.
Oh @JoyRecruitRite I am very much a cheap drunk. I get intoxicated just walking past a pub. :)

Bopping to Blame It On The Boogie.
Let's face it @mizzhelena it's us males who make you females look good.
Oh @JoyRecruitRite right now I am relaxing with a drink. Perhaps a little too relaxed. Lol
I can guarantee you @mizzhelena that I will most likely do at least one stupid thing.  LOL
I am so directionally challenged that I get lost in the shower. Note to self. Don't close eyes!!
Tonight I have discovered something about me. I am such a cheap drunk!
I wish I could sing or play an instrument.  I respect such people.
This visit is all business @mizzhelena no filming. Just seeing clients etc. Yep I reckon it's as pricy as Sydney.
How's this for a ceiling. A great scene to enjoy a drink. http://t.co/Ut2EVAKKbN
Thanks @FrantzJeanPierr we make a good team. Cheers.
You have a way with words @edparnell
Be gentle with me @mizzhelena

You know me so well @mizzhelena it scares me.  LOL Is there any hope for me?
When it's all said &amp; done @lttlewys it's all about angles and perspective. Whether photos or video.
"@edparnell: @BlokesLib thou art not wrong."&lt;~I must agreest with thou.
Is it my imagination or has Facebook become so boring of late?
To be honest @lttlewys I love driving and seeing outback towns. The whole lead up to the expedition is so exciting.
Ah @lttlewys I for one will rejoice when a cure for #cancer is found. Lost too many loved ones.
For the next few months @lttlewys I will be spending lots of my time in regional Australia speaking with officials. Exciting!!
Sitting at Hyatt Regency enjoying a drink. Relaxing after a busy day.
Oh @mizzhelena I think you and I have more in common than different.   Great to see you my friend.
That dammed #cancer is such a curse @lttlewys. We can fly to other planets. Surely we can learn to cure it.
Oh my friend @lttlewys life is good. Working hard. Doing fine. You ok over there?
Currently in lovely #Perth. Such a casual atmosphere here. Love it.
I have the absolute best followers in the whole world!
Plenty of pics to come @lttlewys I promise.

Ah @mandiebear it's the early hours of the morning &amp; I can't sleep. A pretty hot night, an even hotter day to come.
RT @kimindaup: @BlokesLib ...and then head to bed. It was great seeing you tweeting again. :)&lt;-Enjoyed tweeting greatly.
Tweeting at 2am. That's it, I officially need my head read!
RT @Nik_niks666: @BlokesLib certainly doesn't x it's those moments that u cherish x&lt;-Agreed.
Same here @mandiebear I'm not the biggest of drinkers. I can assure you that hangovers kind of discourage me.
RT @Lrex: @BlokesLib  Hope you have a great day Peter..&lt;-I'm getting to tweet with friends like you. How can it be any better? ;)
RT @FrantzJeanPierr: ..No matter what you are going through, and no matter what the circumstance; VICTORY IS YOURS!!!&lt;-Thanks my friend.

Oh @VIPVirtualSols life in the fast lane may well be an apt description.  Overall I can't complain. I'm seeing lots of the country. You ok?
You know what @MegfromCT all any of us can do is our absolute best. Keep it up my friend.
You know what @DickAmateur I'm not so sure I've ever had a totally organised Christmas :)
Come to think of it @LiberalJaxx I have plans for the next few decades..
Come to think of it @LiberalJaxx I have plans for the next few decades.
Life doesn't get much more perfect than that eh! @Nik_niks666
To be honest @mandiebear it's the hangovers that put me off drinking too much. Omg I've had some horror stories.
I'm very much relieved @LiberalJaxx I have plans for next year ;)
RT @Nik_niks666: Lights out chilling with just the Christmas tree lights x lovely x&lt;-Isn't that the nicest of feelings!
I see by your tweets that you've been unwell @FredaMooncotch. Are you ok?
RT @LiberalJaxx: #TerrifyingIfLiteral The Mayan Calendar ends this month.&lt;-Yikes!
Oh I'm such a cheap drunk. 1 drink I'm happy. 2 drinks I'm yours. 3 &amp; the cactus in the corner is looking good.
Ah @mandiebear I can relate. There are times in which a tad bit of well times alcohol can help :)
RT @mandiebear: @BlokesLib *grins*I only speak the truth, you know.&lt;-Are you sure you didn't have your fingers crossed behind your back?

Oh @officiallyben that is ever so frustrating. I do hope the next opportunity isn't too far away. Hang in there my friend.
I am certainly seeing a lot of the country @officiallyben I should post some pics. Are you ok over there?
I've been traveling the country  a lot of late @officiallyben seeing clients. Practically living in motel rooms.

I run a few businesses @FrantzJeanPierr I guess that is kind of like leading a team eh :)
Wish her the best from me @Boddingtons Let's hope the road ahead is less bumpy.
Oh @Boddingtons is she still in hospital?  I do hope she is recovering ok.

I have to admit @BeYourself_TRWF I am blessed to live here. So much to see in Australia.
Hey my friend @Boddingtons I bet you are stirring up trouble over there.  LOL
This week will see me filming along the Great Ocean Road. Should be spectacular.
How are you @BeYourself_TRWF are you doing ok over there?
Exactly @BeYourself_TRWF most people are too busy struggling with their own situations to worry too much about a small stuff up you may make
Oh @mandiebear I am working harder than ever but exciting to see targets being met. How's my favourite pizza maker?
I agree @FrantzJeanPierr when you talk to yourself you can simply be re framing.
Oh I love it @mizzhelena very clever. Talking behind your back could be dangerous. LOL
RT @justashley: Do you guys celebrate birthdays? @BlokesLib I was born today :)&lt;~Congrats my friend.
Most of us worry that people are watching &amp; judging us. In reality they are too busy worrying about the same thing.
Of course I talk to myself. Sometimes I need expert advice.
Stop being afraid of what could go wrong and start thinking about what could GO RIGHT !!
Hey @BrokePimpStyles @atomsmith @mistygirlph thanks for the RT, it's very much appreciated. Cheers!

Yer the touchscreen takes some getting used to @PR1MO I tend to tilt the phone sideways so I get a bigger type-pad.
Fire alarm needs new battery. Every 2 minutes it BEEPS &amp; I shoot through the ceiling. Sleep is JUST NOT HAPPENING !!

For the life of me @LittleFairyCult I don't understand why a network would want to do such a thing. Lacking in compassion I guess.
In Australia @DvinMsM the circumnavigation is being used to raise awareness of #ProstateCancer in tribute to Liz's father.
Agreed @LittleFairyCult
The official trailer for Remote Safari, filming of the series is already underway. http://t.co/kHwjfYr3

In case of emergency break glass and drink the coffee. @VIPVirtualSols
Thanks for the monday morning smiles @Boddingtons
Do you have your photos posted somewhere @DocWends ?
I am sure Monday morning was invented as a marketing concept for some coffee company.
It's Monday morning! Hardly the time to think of something inspirational to tweet! *chuckle*
Gee that'd be an experience @DocWends
I don't mind the cold @DocWends so long as I'm not physically cold myself.
Gee @Boddingtons I'm still mourning the loss of the weekend just past. Not yet moved on to the next! ;)
Mondays are hard to get excited about @Boddingtons
Agreed @DocWends love watching the sun rise at some remote secluded location.
Another busy day ahead but the first task is to get enthusiastic about starting it. *yawn*
I own a few companies too @DocWends which keeps me at a desk sometimes but by far I prefer filming. Love the outdoors. Born to do it.
Yer mate, I am a Cinematographer by trade @DocWends so I spend much of my life with a tv camera in my hands :)
Filming for Remote Safari has kept me from paperwork @DocWends it's a good catch-up day. Sound of the rain is relaxing.
Oh @DocWends it's day's like today that staying inside and working on the computer actually sounds appealing!
RT @thingirlsrus: @BlokesLib Yeah.  Adelaide's the same.  Bloody wet and freezing...&lt;-Good weather to stay indoors eh.

RT @GoldCoastGirl: @BlokesLib it's official ...Unfortunately the world does supposedly need me today&lt;-LOL Have a great one my friend.
Oh @lttlewys I must admit having flash is a huge advantage for me. Good point. Thanks.
Ideally @GoldCoastGirl I'd love to try an android phone for a week before deciding. It's hard not knowing the differences.
Did you have an iphone previously @lttlewys ?
Mmm @Boddingtons we only have 1 carrier who supports 4g here, even then it's very limited. 4g in it's early days here.
I almost got out of bed @GoldCoastGirl ,I stuck my toe out from under the covers &amp; changed my mind.
iPhone or Android. I'm torn. I have an old iPhone but can't decide to upgrade or switch loyalty.
Oh @GoldCoastGirl some Mondays are harder than others eh.
Ah @honeybunch_uk I can see some value in that. *chuckle*
Last time we tweeted @DvinMsM you had a very painful back. Are you ok now?
Good idea @DvinMsM we'll have to schedule. Need a foothold into a TV network over there. You may be able to point me in right direction
I have to admit @DvinMsM this avatar is me. Though I may change it from time to time, this one fits like an old pair of jeans.
It's approaching winter here @honeybunch_uk so I must admit come sunrise, bed is the place to be.
RT @kls89_Kristin: @BlokesLib I always behave, just not appropriately. :-) &lt;-Oh I love that. May have to pinch that line :)
I wake up in the morning with my foot tapping @mandiebear LOL

Do you think if I just hide in bed today the world will not notice that I'm missing?
Oh @Boddingtons it's Monday AM. Am trying to get this body of mine up to speed. Sluggish.
Fortunately for me @mandiebear they are really only noisy on a Friday and Saturday night.
Been ever so busy @DvinMsM arranging to film an entire TV series. Lots of stuff to learn. Are you keeping out of trouble? Miss our chats.

Ah @mandiebear I must be getting old. I'm not a big fan of having a nightclub over the road. LOL
Did somebody say TimTams? @CateP36 @mandiebear
Oh @DrMiaRose what I'd give for some nice warm tropical weather!
Ah it's about 2:30am here @mandiebear ...just peeking in before dozing off again. Noisy neighbors,

Hiya @justashley today is ANZAC day here in Australia hence it's a public holiday. A good Wednesday indeed.
Which way is up?
LOL @katiehog and sharp elbows.
Wow @katiehog you really do live dangerously!
Ah @RedMummy I think it's just a case of trying to fit way too much into a day :)
I am a little hopeful that it won't be standing room only on the tram @katiehog but I don't like my chances! LOL
Oh yes @katiehog I am more than ready to head home to a drink or 2 or 3 or ...
Oh I don't know @RedMummy it's 4:30 pm here and it still doesn't feel like Friday arvo! LOL
Friday afternoon can't come quick enough today.
Oh I'm similar @LunaJune I run a handful of enterprises & each & everyone of them are special to me.
Glad to hear yo got back home mate. Keep in touch @justashley !
Too true @Boddingtons there's few places more relaxing than bed as you awake in the AM.
It's always a pleasure running into you my friend @mizzhelena I do hope you are keeping out of trouble. :)
I appreciate you too my friend @Gabbylicious7
Yer @Boddingtons getting ready for a really busy day. Rather stay in bed though!
Oh @Gabbylicious7 flattery will get you everywhere.
I have the best followers in the world.
I'll do my bit @officiallyben and keep the world turning while you sleep. :)
Oh @justashley I'm not sure 3 of me could keep up with the tasks at hand at the moment. Great to slow down. Are you back home?
My iphone lost 90% of it's charge overnight. I wonder what happened!
My body is quite willing to get out of bed @officiallyben but I think my head's full of concrete.
Me too @Donna_Carrick @melanieminnich I am most content when strolling at the beach. I like it quiet and remote.
Just coming to life here mate. So far I't looking positive @justashley lots to pack into 1 day. Busy.
‚Äú@officiallyben: @BlokesLib LOLOLOL‚Äù &lt;~Ok you can stop laughing now. It's not that unbelievable. LOL
Give me a quiet walk down the beach any day @MelanieMinnich
Oh @LunaJune I could use a few more staff who work as hard as I do. You tend to try that bit harder when it's your company.
Direct TV @justashley now that looks amazing!
LOL @hockey_chick_89 one day I'll have to live down to my online reputation.
My nose grow @hockey_chick_89 ? Never. I'm as pure as the driven snow.
As hard as it is to drag myself away from twitter, it's time to get working. Enjoyed catching up. Play nice everyone!
Wow @Gabbylicious7 you must be beside yourself with anticipation.
I neglected to ask @Gabbylicious7 ,when's it due?
Wanna know the secret to social media? Communicate, care, relate. It's that easy.
Hello my good friend @justashley .It's so exciting to see you! How's life way over yonder?
Make sure you send me some pics when you can @Gabbylicious7
I think all of us have a lot of love to give @Gabbylicious7 .Dam that flow & it's replaced with other emotions.
I think it will shift your perspective a little @Gabbylicious7 you will be so proud & feel blessed.
Mind you @mandiebear with all of the creepy-crawlys out here I still prefer a motel to camping! LOL
Are you excited about becomming a grandmother @Gabbylicious7 ?
Oh @officiallyben @hockey_chick_89 I am just a quiet lad who keeps out of trouble *fingers crossed behind back*
Yer yer @hockey_chick_89 you practice that innocent face in front of the mirror don't you!
I've come to really appreciate the miracle that is nature @mandiebear ,it's a beautiful world if we take the time to look.
Thanks my good friend @Gabbylicious7 I am excited to see you too. Are you causing havoc over there? LOL
Why do I have a sneaky feeling you are corrupting me @hockey_chick_89 ?
Is it a dream or a nightmare @Gabbylicious7 *chuckle*
Hi @officiallyben it's that time of the day when it's time to come to life. Have you started the new job?
A week ago I was in the middle of the desert in a 4wd @mandiebear ,today, the city. Think I am a country lad at heart though.
It's way too early to think of something intelligent to tweet.
I don't know about you @MelanieMinnich but I am sure the pace of life is getting faster.
Oh @LunaJune I agree. Work makes it so much harder to fit in time to misbehave.
It's a goal of mine to see that fountain for myself one day @mandiebear !
You know @hockey_chick_89 given half a chance it'd be fun to find out *chuckle*
Oh @Boddingtons Melbourne is a great city as far as cities go. Fast paced, busy and lots of stuff to see and do.
I will have to get you to teach me @officiallyben I still totally stuff that up! I think I have 2 left thumbs!
I am in Melbourne city in Australia today @Boddingtons .Am working from here at present.
Oh @hockey_chick_89 do you think the world could handle that?
New job @officiallyben ? Spill the beans! What does it involve?
You cause havoc there @hockey_chick_89 & I will do the same here. Kinda like hands across the globe in a weird way!
‚Äú@officiallyben: @BlokesLib watching Friends on the tv‚Äù&lt;~Having trouble containing your excitement eh.
I can hear the trams buzzing by & I can see that it's light. Any more would require getting up! @Boddingtons
I've been so busy @officiallyben am preparing to film a documentary. Lots a ground work to be done but exciting.
Hiya my good friend @mandiebear what's the status of our fountain?
Wouldn't life be boring if everyone behaved @hockey_chick_89 .Good to see you are contributing to misbehavior. LOL
Agreed @Boddingtons some things are best enjoyed with a friend. *chuckle*
Just coming to life here @officiallyben I am not overly enthusiastic about getting into work mode. What's up there?
Oh @LunaJune work isn't exactly fn isn't it. Am keeping out of trouble over here which really must change! LOL
G'day my friend @Boddingtons I do hope you are having a fun filled time over there. Just awaking here.
‚Äú@MelanieMinnich: @BlokesLib how u been?‚Äù&lt;~Been working a lttle too hard. Time to slow down I think. What R U up to over there?

It's a deal @inknots @chocistherapy between us we'll have nothing to fear &lt;grin&gt;
oh yes @inknots I'll be in the credits. I'll be hanging out of helicopters and other exciting stuff.
LOL @chocistherapy @inknots poor snakes get such a raw deal in the popularity stakes.
Oh I've been a corporate beanie of late @VIPVirtualSols it's no where near as much fun.
You know what @Boddingtons it feels likeI never left ;)

Oh @VIPVirtualSols it's just all too hard some days isn't it! Good to see you my friend.
‚Äú@chocistherapy: "@BlokesLib: yes @inknots --- *lifts up feet*‚Äù&lt;~LOL excellent idea!

Sure @inknots the results will be on US, UK, Indian (i believe) and Australian TV later in the year.
Steve Irwin was a friend of mine @inknots I could never relate to his love of snakes :)
yes @inknots and I must admit I've had encounters with way too many snakes.

I have to admit @Boddingtons hanging out of a chopper with a TV camera is one of the more fun aspects of my work :)
I've been hanging out of a helicopter filming @Boddingtons ...that is always a challenge.
Why couldn't the pirates play cards? ... Because the Captain was standing on the Deck.
RT @OspreyRich: @worldbyvideo it was a great piece of kid wisdom!&lt;-Agreed. My daughter comes out with the odd gem sometimes :)
RT @ShaBlair: @WorldByVideo Hope you've mastered those box turns.&lt;-Are you kidding? I avoid them like the plague ;)
I kind of like it too @GailMetzner :)
RT @Gabbylicious7: @WorldByVideo i cant believe ur here hiiiiiiiiiiiii&lt;-It's been a while hasn't it. How's your end of the planet?
My visits here are few & far between of late @Boddingtons .A trend I should work hard at correcting.
Oh @DigitalGodess we make a fine pair don't we. Having said that it's exciting to watch ventures grow.
RT @ShaBlair: @WorldByVideo Great thanks. All good on the mainland!&lt;-Tis a great place to visit *chuckle*. Slower pace 4 me :)
I'm full of youth, vigor & vitality. Oh & just enough bull **** to say that in the 1st place ;)  @samson_gal
Everything is beautiful, but beautiful isn't everything.
I've spent so much time in Melbourne city of late @ShaBlair that I can almost navigate the place without getting lost :)
RT @LifeTerms: Just because you have the right to do something, doesn't mean it's right to do it.
RT @VIPVirtualSols: RT @WorldByVideo: -Is there a higher authority? *chuckle* - Not in your daughter's world ;)&lt;-You got it in one :)

Hey thanks for the RT @OspreyRich @anthonyjohnston @Executive_DIVA it's very much appreciated. Cheers!

All is good @mandiebear ! As a company we are keeping busy.
Oh @mandiebear I invested years into perfecting my video skills. I absolutely love putting the skills to use.
Sometimes the more I try NOT to think of something the more I actually do :) @Janedebond
Was commissioned to oversee the filming of a 12 part TV documentary. Excited about putting my best forward.
Oddly @Janedebond I did one find myself doing that. Come to think of it, it did seem to work. Have to remember at the appropriate time eh.
Oh I am. Huge fan of Autumn @mandiebear i love the amazing colors. There's something special about the season.
it's a relief to know that I am not alone @Janedebond .it'd be handy to have a snooze button for our brain :)
I can relate to that @LemonLimeBlog no matter how late I go to bed I still seem to wake at the same time. So frustrating.
Ever woken up way too early and no matter how hard you try you just can't get back to sleep?
That is very much a relief @mandiebear that was some awfully bad weather. Was wondering if you were safe. Is coming into spring here.
You keep smiling over there @IvySunny it is 8:30 am here and time to start my day. Enjoy!
Wow @IvySunny that is so cool. You are right about Ripley being smart. What a lovely story :)
How old is Ripley now @IvySunny ?
How'd things go with the hurricane in the area @mandiebear ?
gotta love dogs @IvySunny they offer such unconditional love.

Do you find that alcohol helps @IvySunny ?I found that it didn't reduce the pain much but I just didn't care when intoxicated.
I'm not sure I could stretch this body into positions yoga demands @DvinMsM .I can hear tearing just thinking of it!
I found Ibuprofen to be a good short term fix @IvySunny because of it's anti inflammation capabilities.
Shot this footage the other day. Isn't it great to be appreciated ;) http://youtu.be/iUkgFHKpTCA
RT @cmonaussie: @BlokesLib @IvySunny Then ya gotta go for a nice quality Port, it's awsome Peter. Cheers Spud!&lt;-Port! I'd be on the floor!

My friend @thenakedpilot hard at work. Gee she knows her way around a video camera. http://youtu.be/1v_g38jdZvY

RT @jackiewalker: RT @BlokesLib:.. hand at a good bra burning. &gt;&gt; some shorts are overdue burning!&lt;-I think I have some pairs myself :)
RT @starsamaritan: ..Missed you, how did filming go??&lt;-Excellent. One min standing on top of a tower in Sydney, the next floating in harbor
RT @starsamaritan: @BlokesLib re; burning boxers!! Equal rights if willing bras, need to burn boxers also!!&lt;-LOL Agreed :)
It's ben a very busy fortnight @mandiebear with little chances to tweet, but it's good to be back and look'in at ya!
Just when I think I've almost got women worked out...they go
No I can't see us men buring boxer shorts but I'm sure we'll lend a hand at a good bra burning.
I still reckon that given a chance a good father can be as gentle, loving and caring as any woman.
Oh @honeybunch_uk I've just returning from videoing in and around Sydney. Beautiful place to film.

Hi world of twitter!

I guess to be honest a good relationship is not unlike social media. It's all about communication.
Sleep tweeting gets me into so much trouble. I should hide twitter of a night.
Which way is up?
