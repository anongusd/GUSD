"I accept that it sounded like what you said I said," Goggins said, adding that she meant to say "nothing," not "everything."		"I misspoke on that because that's disgraceful," Goggins said. "Who would say that about themselves?"

@KevinlyFather @ScottMStedman @MichaelRCaputo That's completely irrelevant. Of course, they're not going to answer your questions. You do know there are other avenues to obtain information.
@Evanwillfitz @SethAbramson Renting a P.O. box that happens to be next to a Russian's P.O. box is about as uninteresting and meaningless as it gets, IMO.
@Evanwillfitz @SethAbramson If you want to dig down that rabbit hole you are free to do so. But I think it's inappropriate for "investigative reporters" to put out these "ü§îü§îü§î hmmm coincidence?ü§îü§îü§î" tweets before determining the why behind the what.

@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich So if nothing I said was wrong, and nothing appears to be wrong in the police press release, then I'm at a loss as to what the issue is here.
@DeploreHombre @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich He also lied to the police about using the jammer and then tried to destroy the jammer by throwing it into a river after he learned of an open police investigation. And then he finally admitted to fitting the device to his car. Those are the facts, take it or leave it.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich And after digging into this, we now know that using a laser jammer in the manner this man did is illegal in North Yorkshire. And the press release is clear that he was jailed for use of, lying, and attempting to destroy laser jammer. Nothing I said in that tweet is wrong.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Yes, it's literally my job to give you the facts and leave my opinion out of it.

@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich I've stated very clearly that I'm not outraged that this man faces jail time after lying to police about having a laser jammer and attempting to destroy the laser jammer after he learned of an investigation. 		Lying to police = bad.	Tampering with evidence = bad.
@YeeunMin1 @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Repeated rude jester = get police attention		Using laser jammer in illegal manner = end up in prison.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich The Department of Justice has issued 7,209 press releases since 2014. pretty much every government agency at every level -- Federal, State, Local -- are involved in the business of disseminating information to the public about their activities. 		https://t.co/hMQMjJ4hT9
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich I am. You asked if what he did warrants 8 months of imprisonment. If I did what that man did, I'd face up to a year in prison.
@TruthSeekerLO @YeeunMin1 @NYorksPolice @Cernovich I do understand the concept of freedom of speech. I'm a huge supporter.		I'm also a huge supporter of reading comprehension. Utilizing that skill, it's clear that this man was arrested for using the laser jammer, then lying about his use of it and attempting to destroy it.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich If I got caught using an illegal device, then lied to the police to try to cover it up, then tried to destroy the device by throwing it in a river, I wouldn't be surprised to face some sort of punishment here in the states.		That's exactly what this man did.
@YeeunMin1 @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich No, the press release states his middle finger attracted the attention of cops. He was arrested for using the jammer, lying to the police and trying to destroy the jammer.		I'm sorry, I can't be outraged at this after knowing those facts. https://t.co/eZrAvoDxLy
@TruthSeekerLO @TeffersonJeff @NYorksPolice @Cernovich lol, look in the mirror. You're the one arguing with emotions, not facts.
@trollarchjake @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Driving over the speed limit can be a victimless crime, it also can lead to massive, catastrophic loss of life, limb and property.		Police use radar detectors to deter drivers from speeding. Using a radar jammer prohibits the use of that tool.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich If he did not throw the jammer in a river and was still facing 8 months in prison, I'd be just as outraged as you are.
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Again, because he threw the jammer in a river after he KNEW an investigation was ongoing. That's misdemeanor tampering with evidence in states that ban laser jammers. If he did that in the states, he would face up to a year in prison.		https://t.co/JrcRZjtSzV https://t.co/ulKEQotftR
@TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich You don't have a right to use a laser jammer for purpose of interfering with radar or laser speed measurement devices used by law enforcement.
@TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich But there was a crime.		"Using [a laser jammer in Britain] to interfere with a speed detection device being operated by a police officer could well result in an arrest and charge for perverting the course of justice."		https://t.co/cGOQGA2svP
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Laser Jammers are illegal in 12 states, including Texas and Oklahoma. I guarantee you if someone was caught using a jammer in one of these states, then tried to destroy the device after getting caught, he would get slapped with tampering with evidence	https://t.co/P4I30wy0QB
@TeffersonJeff @TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Because he tampered with evidence by throwing the jammer in a river.

@TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Look, I think much of what's going on in England to be absolutely absurd, like the "gun sweeps" where they confiscate car tires.		But the man threw the jammer in a river after he learned of an investigation. That's tampering with evidence.
@TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich Bad argument -- if you're driving drunk don't crash your car or harm someone, there clearly wasn't a victim, but you'll still get arrested.		This man, according to press release, threw his laser jammer in a river after police started investigating this. He knew he did wrong.
@TruthSeekerLO @NYorksPolice @Cernovich He used a laser jammer, which I assume is illegal in North Yorkshire. The press release is pretty clear that was what he got jailed for.

@MadVickie @fawfulfan You said she held "Hitler exterminating Jews is funny! really!" conspiracy-mongering views. 		Is that not an implication that Roseanne is an anti-semite? If not, please help me understand what you meant by that statement.
@Rumple17Gold @fawfulfan I'm not normalizing. I'm merely pointing out that Roseanne posing for off-color pictures for a Jewish-run Satirical magazine is not sufficient evidence to cast her as an anti-semite.		https://t.co/ikiM1ei7zc
@MadVickie @fawfulfan Was it bad satire? Yes, I'd agree with that. But it's satire, nonetheless. These satirical pictures are not sufficient evidence to label Roseanne as an anti-semite.

@cathyob1 @fawfulfan Satire is supposed to be offensive.		https://t.co/U4bwfKYxEz
@MadVickie @fawfulfan The pictures you used to accuse Roseanne of believing that Hitler killing Jews is funny came from a Jewish Satirical Magazine. That's evidence enough to say the pictures were satirical.		https://t.co/ikiM1ei7zc
@TheBlargg @fawfulfan Ban satire, then.		https://t.co/ikiM1ei7zc
@cathyob1 @fawfulfan I don't think the bit was funny, either. But framing Roseanne as a Jew-hating Hitler sycophant for posing for off-color pictures in a *satire* publication is intellectually dishonest.		And @fawfulfan knows this.

To say the North fought the Civil War to end slavery is false. They fought it to preserve the Union.
Secession papers prove the South fought the Civil War over slavery. But the North fought the Civil War to preserve the Union.
"and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men every where could be free.		Yours,	A. Lincoln."
"I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty;"
"What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union"
"and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that."
"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it."
"My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery."	https://t.co/TEyveQRFnN

@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules But we've already established that's not a possibility with @LauraLoomer's threat of legal action.
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules The dots are connecting. Perhaps these "reports" do exist.
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules A confidentiality clause could theoretically explain @Lauren_Southern's "blackmail" claim.
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules But LS didn't make a rape accusation. She cited "reports that you and I both know exist." Loomer responded by naming LS in her lawsuit.
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules It's possible that LS is full of shit, but that wouldn't explain why Loomer became so incensed at the mention of "reports."
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules But there could be a number of explanations. One being respect for the alleged victims.
@gossmology @LauraLoomer @Lauren_Southern @CassandraRules Which would explain why @lauraloomer so fervently and swiftly pulled out the lawyer card.

@LaDonnaRaeMosie @RealityCallsV MMFA has connections to key players in these stories. But I can only speak to fraudulent activities at MMFA

@rscbmr Many thanks!

@CNN https://t.co/plH1u3tVrl
The US Intel Community, the group claiming Russia is responsible for the Wikileaks hacks, is the same group that claimed Saddam had WMDs
@ernesto2727 NEAPAC Fund isn't a Super PAC, so no. 		Part 2 will be finished tonight (hopefully). Will provide a lot more clarification.
@MeggySweets Best way to share my work is via my https://t.co/52YMPTonq7 petition at https://t.co/1YGaKSyS7S
@MeggySweets thank you, I appreciate that! I'm not on Gab yet, one of the many things on my to-do list.
@DawnofBetrayal Exactly - Why am I having to do this in the first place?
@DawnofBetrayal My thoughts exactly. Prime opportunity for anyone who wants to produce meaningful Journalism. I'm going all in!

@Cernovich Thank you for the repost!  Would love the opportunity to discuss this and the rest of my research with you.
@berkon @nickconfessore not focused on the entire fundraising total. Example focused on the 1.06M that was passed from MMFA&gt;FEF&gt;FF
@berkon @nickconfessore the math isn't wrong. The example focused on $1,062,859 of MMFA's 2014 fundraising total.
@berkon @nickconfessore I will not modify. Please refer to schedule R part 5, lines P and Q of FEF's 2014 tax return.
@berkon @nickconfessore I haven't. I'm on the tail end of a 15 hour road trip, believe it or not. will review when I'm off the road.
@berkon I need clarification, then I'll happily modify. @nickconfessore, would love to talk with you in private about my research
@berkon @nickconfessore "it's complicated" won't cut it for me nor my readers.  I will happily make modifications once I get clarification
@berkon unlike @nickconfessore, I've received no clarification, just hate mail
@berkon @nickconfessore the same dollars are being charged a commission multiple times.  That's a problem.
@berkon @nickconfessore what about the 3rd pass to Franklin Forum? Should that just be ignored? FEF exists to funnel money into a 501c4
