Congress is fundamentally restructuring #PartD in new budget provision, cutting vital benefits for #seniors
@MikeCrapo @Raul_Labrador  @SenatorRisch  @CongMikeSimpsonto include the repeal of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (#IPAB)  in upcoming budget negotiations over the continuing resolution package  to fund the government. What is IPAB you say? Here are the toplines: https://t.co/mUrthBOXge
Changes in the proposed budget deal would negatively impact the essential #PartD program and provides virtually no benefits for enrollees. Congress should reject this harmful provision!
@mike crapo Congress should include IPAB in the February 8th package and not wait any longer to get #IPAB repeal over the finish line.
