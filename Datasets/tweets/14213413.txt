immediately after election results is still a conspicuous time to send a reminder email, but original invite sent before Cantor loss
regarding the Cruz invite to House conservatives: original invite was sent May 12 at 9:55am ... email today was just a reminder
Scalise is first RSC chair to rise to whip or higher
Scalise got in the race earlier than Roskam, who was waiting out of deference to Cantor

not fair, either, to completely blame on leadership - there's lots of members on the right who want to fight harder, but won't vote yes
this debt ceiling debacle may be the saddest chapter of all
since 2010, getting 218 Rs on something that's not completely unrealistic has consistently been a huge problem for ldrship
even when Boehner rolled the conservatives on Ryan-Murray, Farm bill etc, it was bc he didn't ever need to put together 218 Rs

if these plans are so much better, you'd think people would migrate to them without being forced to by HHS
? for those touting how great the new plans will be for ppl kicked off plans: if so great, why force ppl off their old plans?
easy 2 see how handling the data could create errors, but if the *amount of rows* in the database is unreliable, way bigger problems
if you don't know how many people have enrolled, the system is total chaos.
honestly, it's a much bigger deal if they really don't know how many people have enrolled.

that's why I asked the question, which would have been better framed: politically, could Obamacare turn into Obama's Iraq War?
but it's not hard to envision it draining Obama's political capital and credibility in a way comparable to what the Iraq War did to Bush
we don't know how bad Obamacare implementation will get yet, because it hasn't fully happened yet
politically, the Iraq War deeply polarized the nation and drained Bush's political capital slowly as its implementation became a disaster
those are obviously very different things in lots of ways, including, as many have noted, that thousands of ppl died in the Iraq War
to those responding to my earlier tweet re: Obamacare / Iraq war - comparison I meant was only political
1 of my least fav moments as a reporter: when I'm transcribing from tape and realize I interrupted some1 saying something really valuable.

@abeaujon @olgakhazan  I code to create tools for my own use to do reporting, but I've never mentioned to newsrooms, not an asset at all
@AlecMacGillis I mean politically, as something that deeply divided the country and grew increasingly unpopular over time.
is Obamacare President Obama's Iraq War?

Camp when a reporter noted similarity to super committee and noted he was on it: "don't remind me!"
@pfeiffer44 so the play is to try to force talks, essentially by any means available
@pfeiffer44 problem for House leadership: they can't calibrate their offer: no talks to asses whether big, medium or tiny deal at hand
what does AFGE do in this situation, for example
Strongest reason this could force Ds to the table: fed govt workers are their constituency, will want paycheck certainty
Camp cited the offer of a short-term debt ceiling from Sperling as a positive sign, but couldn't say whether House wld pass w/out talks
... but new signs of cracks on the D side offering some hope
There is considerable unease about whether Obama is truly serious, willing to push this over the edge...

@jonathanchait Boehner != Ryan. But my pt was not so much that it's GOING to happen, but that the very phrase will produce intrigue/distrust
@jonathanchait to skeptical conservatives (look on Twitter, they're already pouncing), "grand bargain" is code for tax increases
@jonathanchait @RyanLizza @robertcostaNRO if it were on the table, don't think Boehner would be saying so now. Just a thought.
@RyanLizza LONG mtg btwn party leaders but supposedly no progress
@RyanLizza Boehner resurrecting talk of "grand bargain" - means GOP members are going to be scared that means tax increases.
still, it is hard to imagine a meeting that long with NO progress at ALL.

besides the Graves bill, Reps. Steve Southerland and Tom Reed have teamed up on a similar, but more moderate, proposal

if the fight had occurred on schedule, exp for the summer, there would not have been vacuum for Cruz, Lee to fill

my opinion: 19 votes for Cruz is a pretty good showing for Cruz, under the circumstances
Rep. Schweikert, fwiw, completely unperturbed about the apparent chaos. "This is always how it works."
sign of the chaos: there is now disc among GOP reps over whether CR at $988 b is illegal under BCA
whatever they do on CR will come IMMEDIATELY before that
can't overstate how big the Oct. 1 start of Obamacare is looming in the minds of House conservatives.
after the vote this morning, a bunch of hardliners huddled off the floor to compare notes on what they were hearing

sense among several trusted GOP sources is we really are headed towards a shutdown
House GOP to huddle today or tomorrow to chart course on CR http://t.co/5hV9zgX1xU
@sdjacksondc it's a very fluid situation, not sure. But less important to Rs than debt ceiling

Why is Reid asking Cruz for time for McCain?
Reid's office says Cruz has till 1. I have a feeling exhaustion is impeding communication. Just a hunch.

RT @StevenTDennis: @j_strong All guys who don't talk to POTUS ever trying to get inside his brain.
different views in GOP whether Obama is ready to make a concession like delaying indiv mandate or just dead-set against giving up anything
in reality, fight will come down to 1 yr Obamacare delay. That's the initial ask. One fall-back concession pt discussed is indiv mandate.
probably wouldn't have worked anyway -- too complicated. New idea is to demand x,y,z etc. for one year delay.
notably, I'm told the old idea of offering Obama a "menu" of debt ceiling options is OUT
most senior Rs, even conservatives, feel that is more favorable ground for a variety of reasons, but it's a trust problem
the question for tomorrow's special con mtg is whether the hardliners walk out ready to transfer the fight to debt ceiling

in steps Mike Lee and boom, we're off to the races. But there was never any groundwork with the House Republicans
House agreed to punt on debt ceiling until Summer, except that fight never came yet, so there's a vacuum.
Lee and Cruz have been able to get so much oxygen for their push because there's a pent-up demand to fight the president
even the author of the defund Obamacare letter, Mark Meadows, made an effort to distance himself from the Lee/Cruz push
then the outside groups joined on, but the House Republicans are not. Not just Boehner, but top conservatives think this plan is dumb.

Rubio had worked hard to address process concerns and keep perception this was an studied, open process. Corker-Hoeven is fatal to that.
not for Senate passage, but enactment -- and Rubio's image heading out of this
sense that bill is being rushed and the kickbacks in there may be more dangerous to the bill than even the border security weaknesses
Corker-Hoeven brought in R votes on border security, but it also opened up brand new avenues for attack on process

most importantly, members of congress are TERRIBLE at asking questions that elicit new information. plus they don't have much time.
last night on Special Report, Brit Hume did the best explanation I've seen for why congressional oversight hearings pretty much suck.
The broad reach of Feinstein's gun bill probably means they won't even pass a gun bill through the Senate.

Jones described a kind of spoke-and-wheel conspiracy in which participants only communicated with Amash. http://t.co/8GL7quuo
Amash also said that people "independently came together" to oppose Boehner, wouldn't describe how, or who organized. (Jones said Amash did)
Amash: "They do this little dance every time some deadline comes up....and nothing happens."
Amash: "The reason I'm upset with our leadership is because...they're not working with Democrats. They're not."
Amash: "Let's cut the partisan crap out. Republicans and Democrats can work together to balance our budget."
Among the oddest moments today was Amash slamming Boehner for insufficient bipartisanship.
But Rep. Scott Garrett, who didn't vote 1st round, was waiting to see how the votes panned out, presumably. He wouldn't comment.
Rep. Blackburn did not vote the 1st round because she got a bloody nose and had to leave the chamber, she said.

important note about the Hastert rule: Hastert had a GOP prez and Senate
but maybe everyone is just ready to go home, doesn't care. One Mbr told me: "I'm not commenting, I just want to get out of here."
question is: does Boehner passing a bill with mostly Dems (and Cantor opposed) cause him damage? there's got to be some anger from that.
if even the right wingers aren't on board, then the amendment path fails. Fleming, Labrador, others say they are against it.
there's no way this amendment thing is gonna have the 218. the House will end up passing Senate deal with a minority of the majority.
Radically different tone coming out of this meeting. Seems doubtful the amendment path will get 218.
