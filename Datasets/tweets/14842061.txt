@dktatlow Done.
@dktatlow Interesting. What would you advocate?
@jedmark888 @paulmidler Fascinating exchange. Agree 100% that Taiwan deserves more news coverage.
@littlebloke68 Correction noted and appreciated. Still charming!
There's something so charming &amp; unassuming about Australian English vernacular. The new PM isn't 'Mr. Prime Minister' or the 'Right Honorable PM'; he's immediately dubbed 'ScoMo.'
I’ll just leave this here. https://t.co/dVQIADGfMN
Encouraging development. https://t.co/rzhcmcr2Nw
China pulls these anti-American stunts because they can. The Trump Administration should eject a U.S.-based Xinhua reporter, or two, in response. Exact consequences. https://t.co/mYwt0bmVdV

A presidential campaign fed oppo research to DOJ/FBI, who then misled a federal judge, who then approved surveillance on a U.S. citizen / presidential campaign. I'd say that's rather more disturbing, Mr. Rust, based on the facts we have at present. https://t.co/DUOJda6WBZ

There will be no sustainable Kurdish solution without Ankara's help. That's why forging a pragmatic working relationship with Erdogan is important, if possible. https://t.co/ZkdAeRHuix
True. Trump seems to want dialogue with leaders of all stripes, but that doesn't prevent his  Administration from punishing bad behavior (see: China, Iran, Russia, Turkey). https://t.co/ZBm4C5OoeR

Trump could’ve recognized Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea (de facto or formally) or struck a terrible deal on Syria. My two greatest fears for this summit. https://t.co/ixH1hNS5wh
#Putin wins the award for the biggest whopper of the press conference: “I believe Russia is a democratic state.”
Trump seems to believe in engagement for engagement’s sake. The Kims, Xis &amp; Putins of the world interpret that belief as weakness. Always have, always will.
Putin gives shout-out to the U.S. Senators (aka useful idiots) who traveled to Russia to posture in advance of #TrumpPutinSummit. Good job, guys!
#TrumpPutinSummit press conference off to a predictable start. Putin promising to solve all the problems he’s instigated, from Syria to INF Treaty violations. And flattering Trump.
Also: #Putin never cooperates abroad. He starts foreign conflicts to distract from his failures at home &amp; abroad. Invades Ukraine to distract from Maidan pro-democracy protests; enters Syria to distract Russians from body bags coming home.
Remarkable to hear media suggest Russia can help eject Iran from Syria; totally divorced from reality. Iran deeply entrenched &amp; #Putin has no appetite to sustain major casualties in Syria.

@dioforce Think of it this way: The Norks promise 'complete denuclearization' to Clinton, then Bush. Then Obama ignores them. Then they promise 'complete denuclearization' to Trump.
@MarkHertling How best to contact you?
@pig_pile The Trump team could've bankrupted a small Chinese lender doing illegal biz with North Korea, as we did with #BancoDeltaAsia. Would've sent a strong msg before #SingaporeSummit. See our editorials.
@dioforce It's not progress to get the Norks to say the same things they've said for years. I'll believe it's progress when we start carting nuclear material out of the country. Could happen. We'll see.
Wrong. Same language as in the 1994 Agreed Framework, where U.S. made security guarantees in exchange for the North's denuke promises. https://t.co/XpUiSiMLYn

@SohrabAhmari Very kind of you Sohrab, thank you! Just trying to call balls &amp; strikes.
I'm joining @MorningsMaria 8-9am ET to talk #TrumpKimSummit (the good, bad &amp; ugly). Join us on @FoxBusiness.
Kim’s goal: Stay in power. China’s goal: Dominate North Asia. Easy to imagine a deal where NK denukes, US troops leave, Beijing Finlandizes the Korean Peninsula. Would be disaster for US deterrence &amp; Japan/SK/Taiwan.
Trump can’t let talks drag on. @SecPompeo (then CIA chief) said in Jan. (that Pyongyang was ‘a handful of months’ away from ‘being able to hold America at risk’ with a nuke-tipped ICBM.
Everything Kim conceded, in contrast, was a soft concession. Sending back remains, committing to a ‘process’ that gives him time to keep developing WMD, cooperate with Beijing.
Good that Trump will keep ‘maximum pressure’ sanctions, but leverage will be reduced if South Korea’s Moon pours in $$$, as does China, Russia. And this agreement will embolden dovish Moon.
Trump halts military exercises with #SouthKorea, calls them ‘provocative.’ Huh? Only provocative to China. Xi will be lifting the baijiu glass to celebrate.
Trump says Pyongyang commits to ‘complete denuclearization.’ We’ve heard this before. 1994 Agreed Framework promised ‘peace and security on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.’
Watching @realDonaldTrump’s #TrumpKimSummit press conference. Lots of talk of feeling, not a lot of concrete commitments.
@EthanYWu Great suggestion, noted. (Challenge is to find the time amid all the breaking news.)

@free_democrat @newyorkpost Fantastic to be back in Blighty! Even managed a trip to Brighton. (Someday, I'll get to Wales.)
@Ironmantra Trump set a red line: No nuke-tipped ICBMs. Kim may try to hold summits until he achieves that goal; Trump doesn't have infinite time for talks.
Bad sign for #TrumpKimSummit . #KimJongUn has driven the process so far; pushed for summit, tested Trump by insulting his staff, now setting time limit on talks. https://t.co/B8L8wkdqPc
More fundamentally, #KimJongUn would also have to disavow the #juche ('self-reliance') ideology upon which the Kim family rule has been premised since the 1950s.
Then there's end to slave labor abroad, dismantling of political prison camps at home, release of Japanese, South Korea hostages, end to drug &amp; superdollar criminal enterprises. It's such a long list.
What would make the #TrumpKimSummit a success? Complete list of WMD sites; proliferation, terror ties accounting; recognition of #SouthKorea as separate; 'anytime, anywhere' U.S. inspections. That's just a start.
A distinct #TrumpKimSummit danger: Glamorizing a monstrous man who oppresses his own people &amp; proliferates WMD to places like #Syria. Et voila. https://t.co/XFlymCq4kB

Trump campaigned on all of those pledges, won a mandate from the American people &amp; followed through. That's acting in exceptionally good faith, whatever one thinks of the policy merits. https://t.co/JWU2RLHUGb

'Iranian behavior should be consistent with global norms.' Set by whom? How about talking about why liberal Western norms are superior to Islamic Republic norms?
Did @SecPompeo just say 'world citizens'? No such thing.

WSJ editorial: Trump is right to reject Iran's nuclear blackmail. https://t.co/fPPTvg7IA5
So it's important for Europe's 'shared security' to back a deal based on fiction, that greenlights an Iranian nuke? https://t.co/ZEOOW0AXgX
As for the European complaints, they had months to tighten the #IranDeal &amp; base it on an honest accounting of Tehran’s nukes. They didn’t.
Trump’s withdrawal from the #IranDeal is being painted as Armageddon now. But if Tehran rushes to a bomb, that’s Tehran’s choice, not America’s.
Tehran refuses @iaeaorg access to military sites, where they developed nuke know-how before. So for all the folks claiming 'Tehran complies' with the deal, how do they know they're complying?
Israel's intel haul revealed that #Iran misled @iaeaorg repeatedly &amp; hibernated their nuke program. Pact was based on lies.
Trump’s Oct. 2017 speech promised to strengthen #IranDeal so that it really would prevent Tehran from getting a bomb--what @BarackObama promised but didn't deliver.
A few thoughts before @realDonaldTrump announces U.S. withdrawal from #IranDeal, since the U.S. media is so biased in favor of the pact.

@Timclem80787297 @AmbJohnBolton Thanks. Don't miss today's #ForeignEdition podcast with @DAlexBlumenthal. Even more info there on Bolton's diplomatic record, views.
More on @AmbJohnBolton record, aka inconvenient facts the media would like you to ignore. https://t.co/lbqXU4gOFg
In sum, the media wants you to think @AmbJohnBolton is a crazed pundit who’s eager to egg Trump on to WWIII. Instead he’s an experienced diplomat who’s no one’s fool. Great pick.
Bolton is an experienced Asia hand, knows China, recognizes Xi’s authoritarian bent. I met him first when I was based in HK. He has friends, contacts in the region.
Bolton also never believed UN talks for Syria would work; called Obama’s approach “doomed to failure,” which it was. Another correct prediction, contrary to media’s received wisdom.
Bolton understands essential nature of Iranian regime, never bought into media / leftist propaganda for Obama’s nuclear deal. See his many WSJ op-eds on the subject.
Bolton was a major critic of Bush junior’s Six Party Talks and North Korea appeasement (which put him at odds with Condi). He was right; Pyongyang kept developing WMD.
Bolton, as assistant SecState in Bush 1, singlehandedly got UN Resolution 3379 overturned, which equated Zionism with racism. Major, rare UN victory.
The collective freak-out over the @AmbJohnBolton appointment is really something to behold. And so devoid of fact, and reason.

@kirk_bridgers No. Trade deficits mean U.S. buying power strong, economy healthy, tax receipts up. We ran trade deficits in '80s, '90s; ran surplus in Great Depression.
No, a trade deficit doesn't 'cost' anything; it's not a budget deficit. It's the obverse of a capital surplus.

I'm joining @MariaBartiromo's @SundayFutures at 10:45am ET. No hyperbole or half-baked analysis, just serious debate. Join us on @FoxNews.
@MelyssaHarmon Thanks!
@Bhess Thanks for listening to #ForeignEdition!
@HKMarkSimon *listening. And they should, they'd learn what principle sounds like.
6 senior FBI/DOJ leaders fired / reassigned because of Nunes's work. And media just shrugs? Devastating @Mark_Penn op-ed: https://t.co/WyMhZK2dfb
Our editorial cuts through the spin on Nunes, #HouseMemo, Democrats's red herrings. Read the whole thing. https://t.co/YjJeVQGU64 via @WSJOpinion
Classic misdirection &amp; @washingtonpost bites. The key fact is that the FISC wasn't told DNC / Clinton campaign funded #SteeleDossier. https://t.co/cIZFnkynuI
Don’t miss this special #ForeignEdition  podcast with Anson Chan, on how to think about Xi’s China. Extraordinary insights. Subscribe! https://t.co/jDBhJtwl9Y
@maple1023 Who, me?
Look who stopped by @WSJopinion today: The Hon. Anson Chan, aka ‘Hong Kong’s Conscience.’ A special #ForeignEdition podcast out shortly. https://t.co/X165UNpnja
Translation: Former FBI Director happy to see powerful government surveillance programs abused &amp; politicized. Bring back J. Edgar! https://t.co/HFW0BnOF5d
'Whatever you think of President Trump, Carter Page... it’s bad when the FBI withholds information while applying for FISA warrants.' Exactly.  https://t.co/5iXS9Bnt5s
Those pooh-poohing memo as a 'nothing-burger' should ask: What if an unverified Trump campaign doc were used to misled FISC court, spy on Clinton campaign?
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court also not told DOJ official Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, which produced #SteeleDossier. https://t.co/EaJPKqYln4
DOJ/FBI officials further misled FISA court by citing info leaked by Steele himself (a Clinton supporter) to Yahoo! News. https://t.co/TL8NnLXcmj
Holy cow. DOJ/FBI didn't disclose to FISA court that Clinton campaign / DNC funded unverified #SteeleDossier. https://t.co/0ZfsWRlo2i

I think you missed the class on the 'lump of labor fallacy.' https://t.co/uoOAtcQy4i
Such backward economic thinking. Immigrants aren't unproductive lumps of coal; they contribute to growth. https://t.co/T2Pl97BNgf
Intel scandal of year, Southern Hemisphere version? https://t.co/O8mlWCfPyE
There it is. Nunes confirms top DOJ/FBI officials made 'material omissions' to Congress &amp; courts, committed surveillance abuses. https://t.co/eABhtgr3fj
How did I miss this? A sensible environmental chief in Brussels, of all places. https://t.co/izArqsLWB9
It's all political. If generic Congressional poll #s keep improving for Rs, I think Ds will deal. If not, buena suerte. https://t.co/yT6VTiQUvZ
Still a more generous offer than what Obama proposed. Bigger q: Do Dems want a deal, or a campaign issue? https://t.co/SToOroqwBA
The big question, post-#SOTU: 'Will Democrats be willing to deal?' https://t.co/BvU2vJQ3bf via @WSJOpinion
And in Syria and China, too. Not a perfect #SOTU, but not bad, either. https://t.co/WfxvzhIkVS
Tweet of the night. https://t.co/i1EitToUlV
This #SOTU exactly the opposite of the Obama-era speeches. Centered on growth, welfare / reg reform, govt accountability, a strong defense. What a relief.
Cannot emphasize enough how important it is for @POTUS to voice support for the oppressed. Dissidents hear these #SOTU speeches. It matters.
Hate to be the spoiler here, but Trump’s feckless Syria &amp; Iraq policy almost certainly ensures terror threat will be with us for years. #SOTU
Amen. https://t.co/psGhoM3S7r
Trump believes government shouldn’t dictate economic decisions but thinks bureaucrats should choose our immigrants? #SOTU
It would be nice for @POTUS to focus on vast contributions of immigrants, in contrast to puny minority who commit heinous crimes. Worst section of this #SOTU so far.
Good @POTUS wants to streamline infrastructure permitting. More important than shoveling in more taxpayer $.
A niggle: Trade is by its nature ‘fair &amp; reciprocal’ if parties freely engage in it. That’s the meaning of ‘trade.’
A+ @NFL trolling there from @POTUS.
Remarkable to see Dems protest rising wages, lowest-ever jobless rates for blacks /Hispanics &amp; rising markets. Must #resist a stronger economy!
Trump’s set speeches to date (Warsaw, UN, Iran) have been surprisingly good, even uplifting. MSM consistently underestimates him at these events.
Tuning into #SOTUniom.
Best explanation of FBI / DOJ mess to date: Career bureaucrats were jockeying to get into President @HillaryClinton's good graces. https://t.co/pDNsHS3CfR
No, I don't think so. @DevinNunes presided over an above-board investigation, ticked all boxes. Let's see the memo, then the underlying docs. https://t.co/tANuZjMmT2
Far more dangerous to cover up malfeasance at FBI / DOJ. Release all the documents &amp; let Americans judge for themselves. https://t.co/3LUTjtENHB

The sad thing about #Syria is that our policy track isn't predestined; it's a choice, just as it was under Obama. https://t.co/k8LT7Ta1KB
@Stony1Curtis @WSJopinion Yes, there are good guys. But they're worried we'll abandon them to the Syria/Iran/Russia condominium.

Dems claim they want to help Dreamers, but note they’re the ones who put them in legal jeopardy in the 1st place. Shutdown prolongs the legal limbo.
GOP errs by framing the shutdown as a military v. immigrant debate, pitting groups against one another. No. It's a debate about the rule of law, writ large.
I’m joining @SundayFutures this morning with @MariaBartiromo, 10:45am ET. Debating #governmentshutdown2018 (a rather unwieldy hashtag, yes).

I’m joining @MariaBartiromo’s panel for the full 3 hours, 6-9am ET on @MorningsMaria, @FoxNews. Good morning!

Any comment, @tim_cook? https://t.co/t9KxhoODo0
Whoa, if true. https://t.co/K5TBOZAzGZ
It never occurs to @nytopinion that Iran sanctions were working, &amp; that's why Tehran was begging to negotiate with Obama &amp; co.
Classic NYT twisted logic: Iran nuke deal gifted billions to corrupt mullahs; ordinary Iranians are mad, protesting &amp; getting shot; ergo the deal has 'value.' https://t.co/kQxckmFIcz
On #Syria, sources tell me Assad's grip isn't as rock-solid as commonly portrayed. And check out this story. https://t.co/4Lqu7WW9b3
RT @StrickerNonpro: It would be nice to see a House resolution condemning the current carnage in Syria. A set of sanctions. Really anything…
Excellent news. U.S. support buoys the oppressed &amp; gives cover for other nations to voice support, too. https://t.co/KpGnpuVSEy
This seems newsworthy. #HumaAbedin https://t.co/EOVx9oywsB
@ohbrianohbrian I'd argue we've been far more nuanced than you describe. As for Trump's Russia policy, suggest reading #NSS, it's his plan &amp; very hawkish. https://t.co/bCQKWI0Apt
@ohbrianohbrian Trump's Russia policy uneven. Armed Ukraine (good), but tolerating Putin's Syria intervention (bad). I'd like Snowden extradited home for trial.
Iran's regime takes a page from Assad. Horrifying. One has to wonder what's happening to other detained protesters. https://t.co/Sc8jvN6gZ7

Look at what happens when an American President leads. #Jerusalem https://t.co/zTcRBfg6hi
By recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital @realDonaldTrump a) tells truth b) follows U.S. law c) exposes Palestinian objections to Israel's existence. Bravo.

Unbelievable story. The Afghans get too little credit for their courage and immense personal sacrifices. https://t.co/LNw4U3UM9t
The Trump Administration hits on an essential truth: Only the U.S. adheres to arms-control treaties. Everyone else cheats. https://t.co/QLQvQk6s9c
@MarcBodnick @Twitter A good thing to know. I'm more interested in ideas, solid arguments than one-upmanship.
Hah. https://t.co/7g44ANomQ1
@MarcBodnick Not a @Twitter expert, sorry. Didn't realize that was a faux pas. Can hit 'reply' from now on.
Because I just made a factual argument about what's already been accomplished, not based on feelings or telepathy. https://t.co/hP446VWQFw
What Trump may or may not feel/believe is unknowable, &amp; beside the point. Undeniable Asia policy headed in better direction. https://t.co/uvCc5zbGP0
That has nothing to do with how the Administration is prosecuting Asia policy. Intellectually lazy. https://t.co/vF1oFaKm9D
Have to admit, you've never once offered an intelligent counterargument. https://t.co/p34MyqhwNp
Obama kowtowed to China, did nothing to stop SCS incursions, killed quad dialogue, did nothing on NK threat. A rather horrid record. https://t.co/NefjpiL845
Uh, reviving quadrilateral security dialogue, restoring freedom of navigation ops, closer India ties, cooperation with other allies. https://t.co/LjDjAac1Ex
You miss my point. About 1/3 of global trade passes through #SouthChinaSea. We can't let Beijing control those flows. https://t.co/ZFUjZUBEVY
As predicted, witness the incisive analysis--err, click bait for millennials, from a purportedly serious news network. https://t.co/gzgcrngZFC
Amazing what short shrift the press corps gives to @POTUS's efforts to re-build Asian alliances. Essential to free trade, U.S. security.

New #ForeignEdition podcast just posted, on Trump's terrific U.N. speech &amp; an intriguing turn in the Iran nuclear deal debate. https://t.co/F6gU5jaHJv
Not really. Our independent courts forced Trump to revise an illegal immigration order. Hong Kong's courts imprison pro-democracy teenagers. https://t.co/KW2MH7ykLL
Hong Kong's chief executive is more concerned about PR than her citizens' freedoms. https://t.co/V2FtxmhrLg

'We allowed Iran to terrorize neighbors, brutalize her own people, thus we must allow this to happen in an ever-expanding geography.' https://t.co/IRUDPez1TY
Tell that to the mullahs, who continue to call for the annihilation of Israel. https://t.co/EchuUV2zOc https://t.co/qT5Q0yBqBs
A classic red herring. No acknowledgement of decades of Iranian terrorism, then, Sankrant? https://t.co/qTYphH9as9

Meanwhile, @DevinNunes just released more damning info about the Obama administration's unmasking practices. https://t.co/kJzGwBYCNp
You've got to be kidding me. https://t.co/3Zq6VKp87S
New #ForeignEdition podcast, just posted. On China's managed economy mess vs. Taiwan's free-market success. https://t.co/LgqponRhFl
Trump's condominium with Putin in Syria is entrenching the Russian presence there. Very damaging for U.S. interests in the Mideast. https://t.co/ZMbiG9FKbA
Worth reading in full. Too little MSM attention on provenance of the #SteeleDossier, the source of the Russia collusion craze. https://t.co/CeqFKI1ker
The @WSJopinion page wasn't part of the 'Never Trump' crowd. We praise him when we think he has good policies; critique him when he doesn't. https://t.co/O6b9KWU1QY
I do? And I'm a Democrat? These are amazing revelations! https://t.co/IRiGUiuc6J
@dbsdey681 That's too bad, because that's a gross misinterpretation of our views. We're trying to give him advice to help him succeed. No 'hate' here.
@gradingpro Of course he doesn't. But Trump has given the Senators no political cover, nor persuasive ammunition. That's my point.
Huzzah! So glad to read this. https://t.co/SJmH6u2Wz1

I'm co-hosting @batchelorshow tonight, 9-10pm EDT, @77WABCradio. Talking intel leaks, lousy NJ fisc &amp; loutish politicians.
New #ForeignEdition podcast, on why Trump &amp; Co. need a comprehensive strategy to counter Iran. Like, yesterday. https://t.co/L0T5qHPHCZ
In twisted @nytopinion world, the U.S. threatens Mideast peace more than terror sponsor Iran. Who writes this stuff? https://t.co/e18gLmPUzH
This is an excellent question, still unanswered by @SamanthaJPower. https://t.co/L2wqP2IykS
Shorter WSJ editorial: 'this self-inflicted fiasco is one of the great political failures in recent U.S. history' https://t.co/fNw2irj6ug
I think that's right (pun intended). In the meantime, we might get Speaker Pelosi, then President Harris, then single-payer healthcare. https://t.co/2tGN5q7mC0
Welcome to the new Republican Party, the party of permanent opposition. That's all they can do. Oppose. Not govern. https://t.co/lz4aRhzY0U
So Republicans ran for 4 election cycles to repeal &amp; replace ObamaCare, whiffed, and some think that's ok? On which planet, exactly?
The political scandal both parties prefer to ignore. Remarkable, really. https://t.co/huVXHc4R5a

Cool. Thanks for listening. https://t.co/FBcvZXAWC9
And the lamest statement of them all, from @realDonaldTrump. No call for Liu Xia's release, no shaming of CCP, no advocacy for a free China. https://t.co/qNMrFO6iF8
New #ForeignEdition podcast, on #LiuXiaobo's life and death, and why the Commies feared him. https://t.co/rtDxkZJJ5o
Tip of the day: #FF @MaryAnastasiaOG. Biting, often hilarious, perceptive wisdom on all things Latin American. https://t.co/0sfxS3KlcC
More lameness from team Trump; this time, from @nikkihaley. Xi Jinping not named, no linkage between one-party state and Liu's death. https://t.co/H7N7SpYVkU
Lame. Where's the linkage of China's one-party state to Liu's death? Call for human rights lawyers to be released? Hope for a free China? https://t.co/tb4w5WtdXt
Orwellian. https://t.co/Sk3chn2jkt
Taiwan's democratically elected President pays tribute to #LiuXiaobo. Love it. https://t.co/frxxNaW2zO
China's propaganda organ pretends Liu's death wasn't due to his illegal imprisonment, lack of medical care, lack of freedom to leave China. https://t.co/ogP4UBa2TY
Hong Kong, still the only place in China where citizens are free to openly mourn democracy hero #LiuXiaobo. https://t.co/Ekh8b9ivmT
.@realDonaldTrump should do everything in his power to get Liu Xia out of China. Pronto. https://t.co/zVxLeecPxw
Important to remember, for the next time someone claims China's authoritarian model is superior to liberal democracies. https://t.co/v21PRvuhSS
Liu's greatest achievement was Charter 08, an elegant appeal for freedom for the Chinese people. https://t.co/QxQ6CFaZUg
RIP Liu Xiaobo (1955-2017), who was jailed and died for the 'crime' of advocating for basic human rights and a free China. https://t.co/f6EM0sEwY7

@freekorea_us @ForeignAffairs Denuclearization is a fantasy. Even Obama's DNI agrees. Key to regime survival, leverage to extract concessions. https://t.co/hxasbUrxCB
@freekorea_us The Norks use peace 'deals' to buy time, then violate the terms. See @ForeignAffairs for a list of broken promises: https://t.co/8cDzO61QCs

Hugely disingenuous tweet. @UNPeacekeeping has operations running since the 1940s, 1970s. Way past time to cut budgets, refocus priorities. https://t.co/AIKXt276Ny
So it turns out 17 intelligence agencies didn't agree on #Russia hacking analysis, and the analysts were 'hand-picked.' https://t.co/3DMDhmUtwX
Cool! https://t.co/NJdAxJXbdn
Perhaps you aren't aware: North Korea, like China, doesn't award visas to journalists who won't propagandize on their behalf. https://t.co/4S4j4g1PJL
The regime uses useful idiots to generate positive press coverage / propaganda and $$$ to prop up their criminal enterprises. Case in point. https://t.co/wcNqRiwJAo
You're glamorizing travel to a regime that's tortured &amp; routinely taken hostage Japanese, South Korean and American citizens. https://t.co/YIl0jOwwDD

Salient insight from @vdhanson: Democrats obsess over Trump to divert attention from their politically toxic agenda. https://t.co/kivEJtzdEP
In #Russia news, note @washingtonpost omits who paid for the dossier that's being used to smear Carter Page. https://t.co/1UUviUFSWq
@DDion8206 Noted.
@DennisPOwens1 What happened?
And at the end of all of that, #CBO estimates Medicaid spending STILL increases, from $393bn in 2017 to $624bn in 2026. End thread.
I'm just quoting the CBO report; i.e. reading original source material. https://t.co/6lqq0vWT8y
Federal deficits would decrease by '$321 billion over the 2017-2026 period' as states refocus Medicaid on original intent: poor &amp; disabled.
And: 'In 2020, average premiums for benchmark plans for single individuals would be about 30 percent lower than under current law' #CBO
CBO reports the GOP reform would achieve 'market stability in most states before 2020.' A rather important point.
CBO says 15m uninsured in '18 'primarily because the penalty for not having insurance would be eliminated.' So they're CHOOSING that option.
Reading the coverage of the Senate healthcare bill, you'd think journalists are illiterate and can't do math. For instance. . .
@realjbullock Simple take. Policy wisdom questionable, executive power undeniable. Court was right to issue a stay, will likely rule in Trump's favor.

Or this, which ignores the millions who LOST coverage because of ObamaCare. Republicans trying to repair markets. Oh, the horror. https://t.co/ZuJCR6zyjx
Or this, a variation on the 'throw granny off a cliff' scare tactic. An attempt to distract voters from arguments, data, facts. https://t.co/3Jw0VOGQBO
Or this. The classic Democratic formulation of more money always = better care. If that were true, Britain would have amazing healthcare. https://t.co/JvkQt1XzU0
Like this. So Republicans are killers for wanting to lower premiums, increase competition &amp; focus Medicaid on the truly needy? https://t.co/MgLl5V5CLG

Joining @TeamCavuto at 4:20pm EDT to talk North Korea options.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia The big takeaway: The Trump administration has a lot of leverage over North Korea. Just need political will. RIP, #OttoWarmbier. End thread.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Get serious about sanctions on Kim and his cronies. U.S. pressures regimes like Zimbabwe more than we do North Korea. Enlist EU, UN help.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Marshall U.S. intel resources to catalogue which countries do biz with Pyongyang, and publicize to greatest extent possible. Shame China.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Deny the children of North Korean elites the opportunity to get a foreign education. (Kim Jong Un spent time in Switzerland.)
@JVP409 They're not. Bush admin cut off a Macau bank that was financing North Korean transactions, and Chinese banks took the hint. Good precedent.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Link together U.S., Japanese &amp; South Korean missile defense systems to harden our defenses and deny Pyongyang offensive capability.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Reinvigorate and promote the Bush-era Proliferation Security Initiative to focus our allies on fighting North Korean WMD proliferation.
@nikkihaley @UN @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia Then let's cut off North Korea's slave labor income, leaning on allies in Europe, Africa, Asia to deny visas, work permits, etc.
@nikkihaley @UN Next, let's start flooding the place with @VOANews @RadioFreeAsia broadcasts, leaflets and radios. Empower ordinary North Koreans with info.
Then @nikkihaley should start agitating to get North Korea kicked out of the @UN. No good reason to afford them that imprimateur.
Start with banks that do business with the regime. Kick 'em out of the SWIFT network. China will howl, but they choose to prop him up.
Otto Warmbier's tragic death is making me mull all the ways we should be exerting pressure on North Korea &amp; the Kim family crime syndicate.

The #ComeyHearing didn't go very well for Comey, Lynch or the anonymously sourced media.
RT @alimhaider: Comey couldn't determine HRC's intent, but he can read Trump's mind.
This is rather important, too. We're supposed to believe Comey couldn't go public with his concerns but could leak to a law prof? https://t.co/FAHq1I1YTv
A rather important @marcorubio insight: The only thing that wasn't leaked was the fact that @realDonaldTrump wasn't under investigation!
And: Comey wants us to believe he was so intimidated by Trump that he couldn't voice opposition to his request or notify his DOJ superiors.
Also: Comey won't answer bipartisan Judiciary Committee letter, or explain why he withheld info from AG and waited to go public w/concerns.
What we know: Trump not under FBI investigation. No evidence of Trump/Russia collusion. Trump didn't order Comey to do anything illegal.

I'm joining @batchelorshow and @larry_kudlow now on @77WABCradio, on Trump's #JointAddress.
Maybe. But I'll give 'em the benefit of the doubt. https://t.co/2cV7V60kVM
Fascinating that Dems chose Steve Beshear for #JointAddress response. Polar opposite of Obama, Warren, etc. Rethinking their strategy?
This speech will flummox Dems. Calls for unity, progressive policies (childcare handouts, infrastructure), focus on poor, jobless, kids.
America is a great nation because of men like Ryan Owens, and his wife. What enormous sacrifice. What a fitting, powerful tribute.
This is amazing. Trump is exposing how progressive policies stunt healthcare advances, degrade educational outcomes and foster crime.
Note Trump's explicit outreach to Democrats, a big switch from campaign trail. And very necessary if he wants a successful presidency.
I'm not surprised by Trump's call for immigration bargain. He satisfied the base with 'the wall.' Opens political space for a bigly deal.
If Trump really supports 'fair trade,' why didn't he announce a goal for a deal with Britain? Japan?
You mean "you're." https://t.co/wLQiyBQCAU
Trump's election night speech called for unifying the country; also in inaugural. Unsurprising that he'd reiterate that pledge tonight.

The obvious takeaway from #ObamaFarewell: This @POTUS didn't learn from his mistakes, doesn't acknowledge them. Same lines, same laments.
Obama's tribute to @FLOTUS and his kids: so genuine, loving. Best part of #ObamaFarewell, by a mile.
Naked partisanship, persistent racism, plight of minorities... I wonder what a President Obama could do about this parade of horribles.
It never occurs to this @POTUS that the inequality and economic stagnation he laments are the result of his policy choices.
If Obama were a successful president &amp; his policies had worked, Hillary would've won the election -- she ran on his ideas. Just saying.
Tuning into @POTUS farewell address. I predict anodyne assertions about America's greatness, hope &amp; change, and lots of references to "I."

Just tuning into Obama's national security speech; blah blah Gitmo blah blah waterboarding blah blah. George W. Bush is still enemy #1.

In 3, 2, 1. . the left will smear @BetsyDeVos as rich, Koch donor &amp; totally ignore how choice would improve ed, help all kids, esp. poorest.
Never thought I'd see the day when an Education Secretary announcement vows to 'break the bureaucracy,' provide 'school choice.' YES!
@TimTbw1000 IQ isn't destiny. Carter was a smart man &amp; horrible president. I'm saying bureaucrats will push hard to keep status quo.

If Trump wins, will Dems reassess Obama's record? Ask how his arrogance, rank partisanship, racially divisive politics affected their party?
We're witnessing a referendum on ObamaCare, which Dems rammed through Congress. @EvanBayh, @russfeingold voted for it, and lost tonight.
Remarkable results so far. Trump seems to be realigning the electorate. Strong GOP showing in Senate races; @RonJohnsonWI a big win.

Exactly. https://t.co/7OTNurPfCd
So Trump has no entitlement reform plan, and Hillary claims taxing the rich and emphasizing 'wellness' will solve the problem. God help us.
Trump is making the Obama argument; can't do anything about Assad because the alternative might be worse. Can it get worse for Syrians?
@ADRIAN_KAL_EL Your guess is as good as mine.
HAH. https://t.co/SOjqrTnw7o
Is anyone suggesting America 'occupy' Iraq? No. Straw man argument from Hillary.
Hillary won that exchange. It IS appalling for Trump to imply he might not respect the election result. Emails are a separate issue.
I think Trump came out even there. Turned tables on her, raised important qs about Clinton campaign tactics, email lies, double standards.
@TimSimpson Let's try.
Can Chris Wallace moderate every debate from now until forever, please?
CHI-nah. #TrumpTalk
When Hillary says 'investments,' she means 'wasting your taxpayer money on cronies.' Think Solyndra.
Trump whiffing on this economic growth question. Bigly. Hillary threw him a softball and he whiffed.
Hillary's economic growth plan: government, government, and more government. Never works, never will.
Pretty rich for the woman who bragged about crafting the 'Russian reset' to lecture anyone about being a Putin puppet.
An immigration debate for idiots. How about USCIS security review? Guest worker program? Upping skilled immigration? Ag visas? Hello?
'Bigly.' #TrumpTalk
'Bad hombres.'
Roe v Wade remarkably divisive because it was imposed by an unelected court. Devolving decision to states would go far to defuse the issue.
Trump notes gun control didn't stop gun violence in Chicago. Yep. Gun control takes guns away from law abiding citizens, not criminals.
Solid answer from Trump on the Supreme Court. Wants the court to uphold the LAW. Clear distinction between the candidates.
Hillary wants Supreme Court Justices to stand for 'rights,' and 'the people,' not for the Constitution; i.e. make up law to suit leftists.
The third, and mercifully, last #debate. Here we go, America.

Assad and Putin are murderous dictators who don't share American interests. Trump is delusional on foreign policy. Frightening ignorance.
Trump having a good run here. Won the email, ObamaCare, tax exchanges. Because Hillary just has terrible arguments. #debate
The real $ is in the middle class. When Hillary says 'investment' and talks about raising taxes, she's coming for you, middle America.
'Bigly.'
Trump's 'extreme vetting' about as idiotic as Hillary's 'intelligence surge.' Both nonsense. We vet immigrants and have intel agencies.
Remember, America had a government-triggered housing crisis, and Obama... created a vast, new healthcare entitlement. That is failing.
Donald landed some punches there on Hillary's private server, mishandling of classified info.
'When they go low, you go high.' Hillary is crushing Trump. Cool, collected, prepared. Not taking Trump's bait. Impressive.
LOCKER ROOM TALK? Is he serious? No apology? An excuse? Oh wait, he's being advised by Christie, Bannon. This is how they roll. Appalling.

Will this debate matter? Unsure. What's sure: Pence has burnished his political brand, perhaps for a future presidential run.
Clinton Foundation 'highly rated,' Democratic State Dept said its activities fine, and Dem AG attacked Trump. That's the Dem defense?
Ok guys, it's 'Ukraine,' not 'THE Ukraine.' Ukraine is a separate and distinct nation, not a region of Russia.
Key point here from Pence: When Iran nuke deal expires, Iran gets. . . nukes. That's why Obama's deal was so feckless.
@ADRIAN_KAL_EL I vote for @jamestaranto.
Exactly. Ridiculous. https://t.co/lvYbuFwyWR
Is @Elaine_Quijano still there? Anyone moderating this free for all? No control of the discussion, or follow-up questions. Ugh.
Pence is winning. Calm, collected, eviscerating Obama / Clinton record. This isn't even close.
'The terrorist threat has decreased... because bin Laden is dead.' ISIS? HELLO DEMOCRATS? #VPDebate
Finally! Pence mentions 'basket of deplorables.' Trump missed that attack. Effective. Pence came to play. #VPDebate
There it is. Kaine dings Trump for not releasing his taxes. He's right. Should've done that months ago. #VPDebate
'They're advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases." Pence hammering Clinton's big government, ObamaCare, regulation. Effective attack.
Heroic attempt here by Kaine to spin Clinton's SecState record. She misread Putin, backed Iran nuke deal, mishandled Libya. Utter failure.
Pence opening statement an 'aw shucks, I'm a small town guy, who's also not a political naif.' Ok.
Kaine delivers poll tested key words in opening statement: historic, woman, terrorism, climate change, community, respect, historic, trust.
Watching #VPDebate so you don't have to.

Our editorial board's take, 'An Underwhelming Trump-Clinton Debate': https://t.co/SxZkiGB0To via @WSJopinion
.@McFaul The horrendous choice: a candidate who knows very little vs. a candidate who supposedly knows much but makes terrible decisions.
Debate tonight probably just reinforced perceptions of candidates. Trump emotional, light on facts, Clinton wooden, rehearsed. Tie.
Joining @batchelorshow now.
Does anyone believe that Hillary's run for president isn't all about her and her political ambition? That line fell flat. #DebateNight
'She's got experience, but it's bad experience.' Trump can't explain why, but he's right. A better candidate would beat her by a mile.
'We have to knock the hell out of ISIS' is a great line, because it's 100% correct and Trump sounds like he means it.
We're almost an hour into this and not a SINGLE mention of Hillary's 'deplorables' comment? Political malpractice. #Debates2016
Question about 'implicit bias'???Goodbye, America. It's been fun.
Trump is right about stop and frisk, perfectly constitutional, and helps protect poor minority communities most. Was extremely effective.
Hillary talks about crime with no mention of personal responsibility. #Debates2016
Pretty rich for @HillaryClinton to question conflicts of interest while in the White House, after Clinton Foundation pay for play!
.@LesterHoltNBC is doing a terrific job. Adopting the Jim Lehrer model of moderating. Letting the candidates duke it out.

Taxes on 'Wall Street, corporations and the super rich' will be evaded or passed down to middle class. Flat, low, simple tax system better.
