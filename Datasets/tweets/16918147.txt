@IngrahamAngle the voting polls have observers of Dems and repubs parties. Shouldnt there be observers of all parties watching the counting of these ballots
@marcorubio Should be observers from every party. Doesnt FL have observers at voting polls? Why is counting ballots different?

@adamhousley Prayers for you and Tamara and her family. May she rest in peace.
@ItsKrissy I think it is Fairfax County VA
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump @VP NO!!! Not Christie!!!
@marcorubio @realDonaldTrump @VP  We have this problem in Faifax VA. Always last in. Illegal votes in past close races. When are you guys going to fix the voting system?
@LouDobbs Scalise campaigned in VA for Ringgleman &amp; Cline. Both won. Sure it helped. We need to come together as party even if there are personality differences.
@PollackHunter @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump  I agree. Pam Bondi for AG.
@standbyme1972 @chicksonright I had same thought. The dead vote.
@chicksonright I love this. Dead people being elected to office. We needed a good laugh.

@seanspicer @MariaBartiromo @ByronYork @dagenmcdowell @jasoninthehouse @varepall  @SteveScalise  VA Ringgleman &amp; Cline won. Scalise campaigned for them. Brat, Comstock lost. GOP needs put party above personality differences, support. Take lesson from Dems.

@FoxNews @BretBaier @marthamaccallum disappointed that Fox called house and senate before all polls closed and results were in. What happened to integrity and respect for all voters and candidates.
