@Willasdff @TheMarkPantano I understand the way that the MSM makes our "position" seem.		The truth is: We have the Presidency. We have the Senate.

@Willasdff @TheMarkPantano I think you mistook acting irrationally with not fighting back.		You can fight back and keep a level head.		Get involved locally. Sit in during city council meetings. Volunteer to work when voting comes.		Be the eyes and ears of your community. Speak when the need arises.
@TheMarkPantano They aren't trying to start a civil war. That would be a death sentence for them for many reasons.	They are trying to get conservatives to act irrationally so they can play victim status going in to 2020.	A consistent level head will secure victory for the right.
