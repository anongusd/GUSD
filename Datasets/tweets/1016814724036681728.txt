The free press deserves justice. The disenfranchised deserve justice. @realDonaldTrump praises Vladimir Putin on the regular, while the real people that deserve praise and justice (as Ronald Reagan knew) are the Russian people. #TreasonSummit
People connect justice to concepts like revenge, punishment, imprisonment, etc. Justice at its root is defensive, not offensive. It provides equal protection under the law. It counters abuse of power. Too many want to wield justice as a weapon when it‚Äôs supposed to be a shield. https://t.co/DTUDaKWbKH
Everyone heard exactly what they wanted to hear in the #StrzokHearing on both sides of the aisle. Plenty of sound bites to show a witch hunt by the FBI against Trump, or by Republicans against the FBI/investigation. Did anyone in the room care more about justice than politics?
If justice were truly blind, it would not favor the affluent or discriminate based on race. I don‚Äôt think we can call justice blind in America. Deeply rooted biases permeate our entire judicial system.
Justice in America is a reflection of American values, since judges should reflect the will of the American voter through their appointments by elected officials. If you are American and sense injustice, then make sure you vote against injustice. #SCOTUS
