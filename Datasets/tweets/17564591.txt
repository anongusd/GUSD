"Where's the media on this? We haven't seen them. The media's been absent. Why? Folks sadly, because celebrating a hero and a good guy with a gun defeats the far left #MSM narrative that the gun is to blame and the gun is always a tool of evil intent." —@dbongino https://t.co/ImPO3O3q6x

"Remember when we called you out @NewDay’s Alisyn Camerota, for you and CNN’s love of mass shootings…you and @CNN just can't bring yourself to report on a story that proves that all of us here at NRATV are right. That our members are right." —@stinchfield1776 #NRA https://t.co/PLexeEvYsV

When a hero armed school resource officer stopped a mass shooting at Dixon High School, @CNN, @MSNBC and the rest of the anti-gun #MSM were nowhere to be found. It was @MrColionNoir who was at the scene, reporting the truth the media wants to bury. #NRA https://t.co/6UrnJ6cg6d

A message for @CNN's @andersoncooper, @ChrisCuomo, @donlemon, @Acosta, @NewDay's Alisyn Camerota, @wolfblitzer, @jaketapper: When you give mass shooters non-stop coverage but ignore an armed resource officer who stopped a mass shooting, you are not journalists. #ThursdayThoughts https://t.co/gHJX2Ings3
"#Firearms are used for hunting, for sports, for self-defense and to save lives like happened yesterday.

.@stinchfield1776 tells @dbongino "If they're going to use Parkland as evidence as to why we need gun control, then they certainly need to use the story out of Dixon as to why we don't need gun control and as to why we need more armed good guys in schools." #ThursdayThoughts #NRA https://t.co/ysqGaYx0zz
In February @washingtonpost "reporter" @ErikWemple attacked @DLoesch for noting "Many in legacy media love mass shootings." 3 months later, a Dixon High School armed resource officer stops a mass shooting with his firearm.

“@MSNBC ignores lives saved and the actions of a brave officer. MSNBC focused instead on its assault of the Trump administration…and @CNN, same deal. Continued attacks on our president are more important than thwarted attacks on our children.” –@stinchfield1776 #NRA #MSM https://t.co/TJYvyUUHTe
.@voxdotcom "reporter" @germanrlopez called this video by @MrColionNoir 	"ridiculous." But if the #MSM doesn't love mass shootings, then why aren't they or German Lopez at Dixon High School covering the armed resource officer who stopped one? #NRA https://t.co/sKxxIIlurY

Feb. 23: @NewDay's Alisyn Camerota tells @DLoesch “It’s just malicious, actually, that you would say that. I don’t know anybody in the media who likes mass shootings.”	May 16: an armed school resource officer stops a mass shooting. @CNN is no where to be found. #NRA #MSM https://t.co/KKgmvskbC7
"I look around here today, and I don't see @CNN. I don't see @MSNBC. I don't see any major #MSM…With respect to my video, 'The Media Love Mass Shootings,' they do, but only when there’s a ton of blood. And when they can push a gun control narrative." –@MrColionNoir #NRA https://t.co/SE7bdTqXps
“#MSM love mass shootings...If it bleeds, it leads, right. But only if it’s the right amount of blood, from the right people, at the right time…armed citizen uses a gun to stop a violent crime?

"Collecting over $8,000 per month in pension payments, Scot Peterson, the guy who stood 200 feet from the massacre, he did nothing despite it being his job and despite that he was armed himself, and he started collecting his pension in April." —@DLoesch #NRA https://t.co/oNxZXgoNqV
"Let me say it again in front of the whole country. Your reporter faked that story." In 2003, NRA's Wayne LaPierre took on @CNN – America's original #FakeNews network – for lying about our #2A. They lied then and they lie now. #NRA https://t.co/i6cnXM3elL

"Because #MSM has been telling us that we need to have a conversation about these topics—that we need to talk about school safety that we need to talk about school security—then the media can't just cover these stories when, unfortunately, there's a huge body count." —@CamEdwards https://t.co/s7xKFOGJQI
"Explain to me how having this armed resource officer on campus made this situation more dangerous. Because in the wake of Parkland that's all I heard from individuals. No one wanted to have any kind armed security at all, whatsoever." — @DLoesch #NRATV https://t.co/AlHEoJOvC6
"An hour ago, we checked out @CNN and we don't see anything on their homepage about this hero...He accomplishes his mission and you see almost nothing in #MSM about that story, yet when these situations get tragically worse, you see non-stop coverage of an event." —@dbongino #NRA https://t.co/TcN70WLtBY
"A story that should be a lot bigger news than it is today, what’s going on at Dixon High School…I don't think that this has a high enough body count for the national media to be interested in, quite frankly— this isn't a tragic enough story for the #MSM." –@CamEdwards #NRA https://t.co/NfbBu4BAhh
