@TheTrussel @MarisaTacoma @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt That's because of CA's idiotic top-two system, under which all candidates run on one ballot and then the top 2 advance to the general, regardless of party. The Republican vote fractured, so two Democrats advanced. The Republican nominee for Governor (John Cox) got 38.1%.
@TheTrussel @Alyssa3467 @TrooperGalactus @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 47.45% of people live in coastal states, 46.80% without Alaska and Hawaii. Those people will not all vote monolithically, so a candidate will have to campaign in non-coastal states.
@jerbergmann @TheTrussel @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 Right now all states are winner-take-all except for Nebraska and Maine, which are by congressional district. Proportional allocation would mean that if a candidate wins 60% of the vote in a state, they get 60% of the Electoral Votes, not 100%.
@TheTrussel @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 States can choose how to assign electoral votes, not how to count votes.
@TheTrussel @TrooperGalactus @Alyssa3467 @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 In Florida in 2016, Clinton campaigned primarily in the big cities, and did really well for a Democrat in most of them, but she lost the state because she got blown out in the panhandle and central Florida. You can win while getting blown out in the rurals, but it's not easy.
@TheTrussel @TrooperGalactus @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 Those states make up a third of the US. Even if someone carried all the votes from those states, they wouldn't have anywhere near enough votes to win. And no one is winning all the votes from those states.

@TheTrussel @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 I brought up slavery to prove that just because the Founding Fathers thought something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the correct viewpoint. Maybe it is, but in this case I believe it isn‚Äôt.
@TheTrussel @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 But California is part of the USA, their votes should count as much as anyone else. If an Electoral College has to exist, then make the EVs allocated proportionally and make it so the states are properly weighted by population.

@TheTrussel @pinktastic615 @JoanHolker @fanofwalt @kylegriffin1 Many of the Founding Fathers also owned slaves. They were great people, but weren‚Äôt always correct, and their wisdom was not infinite.

@Gabriel77477994 @kylegriffin1 It takes the focus away from a half-dozen states and forces candidates to campaign elsewhere in order to win.

@TossupReport @ActorAaronBooth @mcimaps Another cycle of the state trending Democratic plus presidential year turnout.
@Aintropy @Taniel There are lots of other great candidates who can win the presidency, and we need the Senate to get anything done. We have no room for error in the Senate, and there‚Äôs a good chance that the Senate ends up tied 50-50, broken by the VP‚Äôs tie.
@RussRay1 @Taniel We definitely don‚Äôt need Ohio. There are many paths to victory that don‚Äôt involve carrying Ohio. At this point, carrying Texas might be as easy as carrying Ohio.
@MattyK617 @Taniel Midterms are always bad for the president‚Äôs party except in special circumstances, there‚Äôs no guarantee that we would gain Senate seats.
@tonyheyl @Taniel Vermont is super Democratic, we would win the special election. Ohio is not super Democratic, so a special election there would be expensive and we would have a good chance at losing it, especially if DeWine appoints a good candidate.

@stevescott13 @Generic_Figure @paulajean2018 Not sure what you're talking about since Nader got 80,000 more votes than Buchanan in Florida and 20,000 more in New Hampshire. Bush's margin in both states was lower than those numbers. If every Nader voter voted for Gore, and every Buchanan voter for Bush, Gore would have won.
@JonathanPtrck @BurkeElliot @paulajean2018 Our candidates need to fit their district, and Manchin fits WV pretty good. FYI, the Democratic Party is actually moving left, as more and more people call for single payer and laxer immigration policies.
@BurkeElliot @TerenceWeiller @paulajean2018 This type of purity politics is exactly why Clinton lost. Conservatives will vote for their candidate if there's even one thing they like about them. Liberals will vote against their candidate if there's even one thing they dislike about them.
@TerenceWeiller @BurkeElliot @paulajean2018 Durbin's pretty good, I don't think he should be primaried.
@BurkeElliot @TerenceWeiller @paulajean2018 We need to vote for the most liberal Congress possible, and right now that includes Manchin in it. I will vote for the Democrat in November, because the worst Democrat is better than the best Republicans. I would advise you to remember that. That's all I have to say.

@Statistar30 @oufenix @paulajean2018 He votes with Democrats if there‚Äôs a chance of stopping a bad bill from passing. With the abortion ban, it was never going to pass. With the Dodd-Frank rollback, it was always going to pass.
@BurkeElliot @paulajean2018 You‚Äôre mistaking being a progressive with being a Democrat. You can be a Democrat without supporting any of those things. Regarding SCOTUS, Manchin needs Republican votes to get elected.
@Statistar30 @NathanFox155125 @paulajean2018 Anyone running in WV needs Republicans to win.
@Statistar30 @oufenix @paulajean2018 Manchin voted against the tax bill and the ACA repeal. He votes with us when it counts, but he has to appeal to the center to have a chance at winning re-election.
@paulajean2018 If you want to cost Democrats the Senate, then proceed. I enjoy having a Democratic majority though, and would prefer Manchhin to Morrissey.

@SalenaZito She‚Äôs not just a Republican, she‚Äôs a Republican Party official who was voting based on the SCOTUS vacancy. Clinton could have only gotten her vote by being a conservative Republican.
Comstock is probably toast regardless, her underperformance last night, the Democratic turnout advantage in her district, Wexton winning the D primary, and the fundamentals make the race at least Lean D.
Really bad night for the Virginia GOP last night, with Stewart winning the Senate nomination and Comstock doing relatively bad in her renomination. Stewart will be a drag on the rest of the ticket, and up to 4 House seats could be lost because of this (2, 5, 7, and 10).

If you want a Governor like McAuliffe, who's termed out as Governor, then support @RalphNortham's campaign to replace him. 2/2
Think Terry McAuliffe had a good response to Charlottesville? Think how it would be if Ken Cuccinelli were Governor. 1/2

@SenatorDurbin He's not going to actually take any steps over this because he actually supports what the alt-right is doing.

Governor McAuliffe's response, meanwhile, has been extremely admirable.
Trump has yet to condemn white nationalism. What's wrong Mr. President, afraid of offending your white nationalist supporters?

RT @Izengabe_: @propatriots @JMilesColeman I think a yellow dog could win the general if he was running on the GOP line in Alabama.
@OriginalBad @Izengabe_ @RRHElections Brooks is probably the strongest out of the three, just because he has no baggage, and everything he supports is popular in Alabama.
@Izengabe_ @RRHElections Lol, true. It'd take a perfect storm for a Democrat to win in Alabama.
@RRHElections Also, no Senator has been defeated in a primary since Lugar in 2012, so interesting bit of trivia. /3
@RRHElections If Moore wins, then it'll be a blow to McConnell, who's spent a lot of money helping Strange. /2
@RRHElections poll of AL-SEN shows Moore and Strange in a runoff. They're the only two people Democrats could defeat in the general.
Really shocked by @WVGovernor switching parties, he lied to the voters of WV when he pretended to be a Democrat, just so he could be elected

@realDonaldTrump So far, has Trump even had any wins? I challenge you to name one thing he's done that hasn't been unpopular, not passed, or been blocked.
Approval of @realDonaldTrump is at all time lows. Shows that the American people won't accept the madness that's the current administration.
