Last Omnibus: 1665 pages.  Time to read 1 page: ~2 min.  Time before expected vote on Omnibus (adding over 1 Trillion of debt): Less than 48 Hours.  Estimated reading without food or rest:. Over 53 hours.  And we STILL don't have the bill. #omnibust

Seriously @timkaine and @MarkWarner , why not vote to fund Children's Health Insurance thru 2023 and keep Govt open?  Why do you oppose healthcare for 67k Va kids and 1.1k pregnant VA women?  You've said you support #CHIP so why support #SchumerShutdown .  Serious question.
@MarkWarner  and @timkaine if you're wondering, Virginia Dem Senators (that's you) just killed Children's Health Insurance and acted to shut down Govt.  This directly impacts 67,000 Virginia children and over a thousand pregnant women in Virginia. #SchumerShutdown  just sayin.

Dem's press conference is RICH.  If they could say things that were true,  there would have been no presser. #SchumerShutdown  happened with 93% of votes in both Chambers coming from DEMOCRATS.  @NancyPelosi voted to shutdown.  @realDonaldTrump  opposed it.  Look at the votes!
Morning Math...  Over 93 percent of House and Senate votes in FAVOR of the #SchumerShutdown AND for denying funding 9 million poor American children Health Insurance #CHIP were...  DEMOCRATS.  Don't believe me?  You're a math denier.
House and Senate Democrat votes for shutdown and denying CHIP funding outnumber Republican votes to do the same by a ratio of 231 to 15.  If you don't know that this is a #SchumerShutdown then you either cannot do math or are a math denier.

Number of House Dems who voted NOT to fund CHIP and FOR #SchumerShutdown 186.  Number of House Republicans who did the same 11.  @SenSchumer owns this.  To deny this makes him anti-math, a.k.a. a math denier.
The temerity of Chuck #SchumerShutdown Schumer is unprecedented.  This guy tells Democrats to vote to shut down the government and they do...  Then he blames Republicans.  Count the votes.  Schumer shut it down and denied #CHIP to 9 million children.  Shame.

@JesseBWatters @DanaPerino If you think Congress should give decisions on marijuana policy to states as you said tonight, then check out HR 1227.  Bipartisan.  About to be a year old.  If we can get it to the floor, we can pass it.  Constitutional common sense.
I've got no problem with enforcing the law.  I do have a problem with laws that have disparate impact and aren't uniformly enforced, and that supercede Constitutional authority.  Let's be consistent and understand the proper role of government at each level.  #Federalism
Congratulations @KirkCoxVA and @yancey4delegate !
