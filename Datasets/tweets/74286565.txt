Together we will continue to advance GitHub as a platform loved by developers and trusted by enterprises.
Our commitment is to be stewards of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-first ethos, operate independently, and remain an open platform.
Building technology so that others can build technology is core to our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
Microsoft has been a developer-focused company from the very first product we created to the platforms and tools we offer today.
It‚Äôs a destination for Microsoft too. We are currently the most active organization on GitHub, with more than two million ‚Äúcommits,‚Äù or updates, made to projects.
From the largest corporations to the smallest startups, GitHub is the destination for developers to learn, share and work together to create software.
Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world‚Äôs code. GitHub is their home. It has 28 million members.
The era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge is upon us. Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work. Every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology.
