I wonder how many seniors, disabled, veterans, deplorables, and minorities in every state that is Red, have $50 to $300 issues with Amazon's business model. Does Amazon publish the Registered Agent in each state for handling shipping, returns, and refund issues for small claims?
I tried to Google..research.. how many Corporations have moved at least 10,000 jobs overseas, after Clinton signed NAFTA in 1998. I, personally would like to know, to be able to discern whether or not..they are moving back! Which to boycott?I put " Buy American" billboards 1991.
RT @larryelder: Just WHAT more does @TheRevAl have to do and say for media to FINALLY call Sharpton what he is--a racist, anti-Semitic race…
I just would like someone to look up the registered agent for filing a small claims lawsuit against Amazon! It took me 3 months, and 4 counties I contacted,first, and then after contacting our State Gop, one guy worked, uncovered, and gave the agent so I could have served Seattle https://t.co/G3IcsSVZnb

I leave for interviews( 16 from 149 applied.  4 chairs, are advisers for each! They conceded the value to tge communities businesses! It is overwhelming, so they follow me. I told you! We got this!
Are you interested? Direct message me, time is short, and we lease vans in 7 days, so be on road for 60 days. We voted you will always be on back of 200 vans in 2 years across the country. We have applied for patents pending. Do we have a deal, and win! I begged, eloquently! Yes!
We will be putting 9 leds frabrucaued at our aluminum plant, who owes me favor, with moneys donated to us from DeSabtis Campaign on every van for 12 (  8 sec) static commercials on each side, alternating 12 hotels we serve, and https://t.co/hqCvBxKGD3, https://t.co/IddK4wSvtx n u
We ask one thing, DeSantis support for legislating 4th amendment, and gain votes of families if our African-American Brothers, and students parents. We need adwrap paid for by judicial watch, student members if each chapter drive 3 hours each a day for tips! We want $15 hr/donate
We would expect first 4 adwraps to be psud by..judicial watch and Desantis for governor! Because of Governor DeSantis ties to pinellas, I have a one-time political pass, saying that if we were interchanged politically, he is a John Doe, and we support John Does! We put u on 1side
Choice, between back of 4 adwrspped Vans,  message choice, to be voted. Do we support voters rights for felons who are nonviolent offenders who osudvtgeir debt to society. Inhumane treatment, has to be overturned in florida, I can bring Desantis and judicial watch as featured on4
The $700 monthly if each chapter, leases, insures, a 12 passenger Nissan Van, to adwrap to forward three messages to one million a year..!! Each! Simple, Right! We have patented concept, secured best hotels, city and community us, because, it makes money for everyone. Now I ask u
This foundation is self-crowdfunding to market crowdfunding. We have finished two chapters of 4. They meet once a month. In order to succeed as entrepreneurs,  in order to be member a $100 monthly financial stake in it,  and ensures mire motivation. $700 monthly makes you bizman!

Always remember, Mr. Trump used forum for his narrative for his own content. If you have a narrative embrace it and lead!
Please retweet, as I will now direct message him, as he did me without my following him. Heck, my professors said to accept his help! I say Gid helps those who help themselves! We will build it, so grab it, Do it, own it and protect Americans' Children! Goodbye Twitter,His blood
Do, I have 120 hour weeks ahead, and no more time for debate, as the media, the politically correct, talk, and talk, while you and I let our actions do our talking. Never did we have to lock our doors. Now We Do! #BuildTheWall, and go down in history as the man who gave back USA!
I got this here, I am much older and much wiser than I was in my thirty, and as a high school graduate who finished 95 out of 295 in high school! Now I am wise enough to say no to your offers of funding our #u.STEP, a foundation of students for pure drinking water, and we own it!
So Mr.Ellison, few humans can have a chance to change history. You are the Maverick in Silicone, needing nothing but wanting to make other people's dreams come true! Giving 95% of your fortune to help them. Let them help themselves! Altruistic unutterable Bliss! Walk as Jesus did
Ihe declared, and I declared that a businessman will win. The students booed and hissed, that as when I told the professor to teach, don't preach, and hated my discourse, and he hated that A, 7 courses in political science, no more left. 98%. For your kids, mine too#buildTheWall!
If I had 54 billion, by making my dream real, my way as you did. I went back to college to see the caliber of education my grandsons will get, and in my first sociology class teach the students that Mr.Obama was a God to him. I told him that I bet $100, that day of trump declare!
I say, and will keep saying, follow your procedures and your God-given talent at 74, be the name on every Americans lips, and be judged at the gates, as the one elitist, who thumbed his nose at the 90s. You made your fortune at 33, that was the 80's. Stop the gouging of America!!
I tell you I do not want or need your funding. If I can not give Florida to the citizens of Florida, on my own, then It is failure on my part. You day you want to help this country with 95% of your 54 billion. Be remembered as greatest American and take half your fortune Build it
Mr. Lawrence Ellison, you asked three times how you can help? I dud not know who or what you did, and that when you told me that you were co- founder of oracle.I asked you to come speak to my 35,000 fellow students that will not have the chance, you and I had in the Reagan years!
Now some dembots are blowing up my direct messages.
I have DeSantis, and by Trump 2020, I will have all canvas bag is northeast mayworths, too. Publix, target, all gotta a seer call by 35000 student that now think for themselves after learning discourse from 8 political science courses at 98%.

@Danny30798186 Google CountrySide Manor, if you pass by on way south to Milwaukee! Please for me, because 350,000 children need me here..as my mom would want me..demand me to!
@Danny30798186 WISCONSIN, you voted common sense at last. It took my whole life to be proud of you! Now bring those property taxes down, and visit my mom! She is who all strive to be! She was the woman of the 90's, doing in the 1950's for conservative mothers of four/ workingHARD
@Danny30798186 So, this is how I have to change the narratives! A reminder if who we are, who we ultimately answer to, the one that sees all misdeeds, and closes or opens hearts, souls, and doors( that swing shut or closed). What side of the door are you! If you read, look mirror
@Danny30798186 These people are your America, not the one born of Greed, corruption only leads to Ultimate Corruption, and Walter, a co founder of St.Vincent De Paul I would put signs in every restaurant with my "special" bulletin of AdSignz, Inc. I built in 6 months, then let go
@Danny30798186 Is thus America to selfish to remember it's own! To remember what, who and why we are exceptional. I know the Dami's are! Walter Brandt" God Bless the Sheboygan StockBroker" Born in 1898, and lived to 100, and dove into Elkhart lake, Wi. Til 96! Told of bad Clinton

@Danny30798186 These are your stories, of Americans, of immigrants who stood their ground, Mr Dami was that 12 year old who did not run. Mr Ford, said " Son,Come see me in 2 years. Mr. Dami, was a Father to be proud of, and his 3 sons, my friends, 2 attys,Fl, and ill., Dearborne?
@Danny30798186 He told that young Mr Dami, father of 6. who I promised to take care of youngest daughter/ my word was golden, as he was longest working Ford employee, with two daughters as executives, and children too. They took care of him through 8 yrs of Akzheimers! Real Love!
@Danny30798186 my girl's family is 3 generations of Ford, lived in Dearborne, Michigan. Her dad mischievously, and several friends at 12, crawled over fence, to play on Henry Ford's Property. The security, and A model T drove up, they all rsn, but one!. Her Dad, stood..at 14/60yr
@Danny30798186 I call her, and she says "Danny, How are you doing," in her excited voice. In 3 years they kept her from me, the son that cleaned her tub, bought the carpet cleaner to weekly clean, my mother became my child. Many families take care of loved ones, doing her wishes!
@Danny30798186 Wisconsin, who supported Governor Walker, who finally realise how similar two cities, Milwaukee and Chicago have become since the Clinton Era. I put those 50 billboards, and the Barn..Up For You! My mom! If you visit will sing Danny Boy, as her voice, still callsme
@Danny30798186 Before God, and Missionary changed me..and let $15,000 turn into $65,000 in 30 days. Missionary evangelical Pastor took that extra $50k, and bought extra 50,000 Bibles for Russia! That Dan as only Danny to mom! That mom would have been Greatest President! Born1930
@Danny30798186 I miss them both, and If any Republicans, that were young, during the 90's of Clinton Manchurian Presidency. They made me conservative,  but Jesus saved me from bitterness, giving me forgiveness! That brother( sued by youngest sister and Dad, Mom) for stealing mine
@Danny30798186 My Mother hated Hillary Clinton, and my Dad, and her didn't every evening in their 80's at their Winter Residence in my Pinellas County, Fla. They watched O Reilly, then a younger Hannity, if you came in door during Fox News?  Sash! From ma,  The Hand Up from Dad!
@Danny30798186 Marilyn Sterbenz...Mother of four, an Irish beauty, wife of Joseph W., and newspaperwoman, actress, village clerk for 30 years. She was a Staunch Conservative Catholic Irish Lass, that made sure her kids went to Church, studied before play, and was electorate in 76
@Danny30798186 Her oldest son had to go to Sheboygan Court, was accosted by street thugs, threatened by a Sheboygan officer, that let a tourist, in city, for two nights to make sure my mother did not die, too, in the care of Sister. She was Stopped, by me in court, yet my dad die
@Danny30798186 I cannot, I am busy fighting against opposition forces that want this country to return to days, that made highest property taxes in country during the time, Our State Wisconsin Democrats had to look at her/my 1,200 sq ft BARN Billboard(91to 2000) One Billion Views
@Danny30798186 My Dad died while suing my brother for thief. My sister took her from winter retreat, with my father, took them to their Lakefront Elkhart Lake, home. They ware/were residents. My father died during lawsuit. He was cremated, and I found out after it was done. Look!
@Danny30798186 Mr. Walker, She, and not I, her oldest son is responsible for the one billion views by the 225,000 cars per day for 3,520 days on border of Il/WI and Chuck from Peterbuilt of Wisconsin, and Jones Signs, Inc. in Green Bay would to. She paid taxes on 2 mil home 50yrs

Smart Career Politicians, Southern Democrats, including All Political Establishments, that break every promise these past 66 years! Media who donate worse than Prada does to Putins party! Washington DC who  vote Left of Center towards Socialism/Marxism worse than Moscow votes!
The whole government of attorneys who become millionaires playing a game on the American people, and their ignorance of what Christian Value, Moral Character, truth, Unity, to serve own interests instead of American's interests. 3 Men I trust..Jim Jordan, Mr.Nunez, and OUR PREZ!!
Also known as Danny(STEP), who is forgetting GOP, Democrats, Feminist Movement (that gave rise to 72% African American children raised by Single Woman), Judicial System( started 66 years ago to help facilitate Men losing their kids! 66 years(15% to 72%) Proud of Men who gave up?
