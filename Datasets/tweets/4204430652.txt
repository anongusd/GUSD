@RepHultgren But the demographic in the individual market is forgotten and does not have subsidies or access to affordable care even though we pay for fed employees to get reduced premiums etc. using our tax dollars we pay.
@RepHultgren Will not support Randy Hultgren because he is nof for health care for small business small business employees independent contractors and sole proprietors. Our taxes subsidize federal employee health care Our taxes reduce federal employee costs by 60-70% using these subsidies.
@SenatorCantwell and out of pocket maximums due to our tax dollars. How is this equitable? We give federal government employees a cadillac from our tax dollars and the small business employee gets nothing
@SenatorCantwell We must help small business employees get subsidized health care because small business generally will not subsidize their employees health care. Meanwhile these employees pay tax so that federal employees get 60-70% subsidies to reduce their premiums deductibles

@CoreyStewartVA will not admit the truth and want to deny deny deny. The lack of affordability is going to get worse for all . We need enlightened representatives that have a brain  know what is right do what is right or everyone in America will suffer. as the Republicans slander a remedy.
@CoreyStewartVA problem which is destroying the well being of many working Americans. A Medicare for all optoion is a solution. People pay a premium and they could make available Medicare Advantage plans like there is for the Elderly and the Disabled. The problem is the pig headed Repiblicans
@CoreyStewartVA If many working Americans cannot afford health care a basic need because their employers will not sponsor and subsidize health plans like the Mega Corps then it is the job of our government to take control of that very essential need and address and provide a solution to the
@CoreyStewartVA Same old Republican lies on health care. Our preamble says its our Govenments responsibility to promote the general welfare. That does not mean everyone should be on welfare it means the government needs to put in place programs that improve the quality of life for all.

@VoteMarsha So it seems to be okay with Marsha to neglect children after they are born. So Marsha you prey on peoples emotions but I for one will not fall for your manipulation. I want a candidate that cares about life from the cradle to the grave.not one that uses propaganda.
@VoteMarsha Some people cringe when canddates zssert abortion as horrific. Well in a perfect world abortion might not be an issue. In this world Marsha is against health care programs for those that work but can't get employer sponsored insurancethat would take care of children and families

@AnnKeenan3434 @Scottyc11 @Christo32593903 @Bstewart2 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I'll say. If you do't know by now what is what you ar absent of any common sense. Where is Mueller? Is Mueller one of these Godless people? When is enough enough?

@GovMikeHuckabee Certainly the Holy Spirit does not flow through you Mike. If h.e did you would never behave as you do.  Putin is a killer. People know them by their fruits In Jesus name Amen.   .
@GovMikeHuckabee Here is the problem Mike, Putin is a ruthless killer and has committed crimes against humanity. Nerve gas etc. So whether it is Trump, Schumer, or you Putin is not a welcomed guest. He is a criminal and should be brought before the International Criminal Court.
@HouseGOP So it is okay to welcome humans to our soil who use nerve gas on people as long as Americans have a job. Makes perfect sense. God help the homo sapien that they  become civilized. In Jesus name Amen.
@NBCNews When the World court should bring Putin up on charges against humanity as well as Trump for kidnapping children at the Mexican border.Oh but wait who cares the stock market is up and some have a little more jingle in their pockets so who cares about humanity?
@NBCNews We love humans that use nerve gas on people on our soil. Thank you. You know what the people want. Maybe they will rub noses and say all is great with the world.

@SenatorCantwell Premium is charged by age and income unlike the group plans..This goes against civil rights laws for equal treatment. We need a national health care plan with equal acess for all. Nothing else will be Constitutional.
@SenatorCantwell by their employer paid for by our taxes. Same goes for Corporate subsidized health plans those employees get 60% subsidizes too paid by the consumer in their prices for goods and services. People who can't get subsidize employer sponsored plans are being treated unequally.
@SenatorCantwell I am not against the ACA It has done some good. The problem is you pay according to age and income. That is not true with employee subsidized plans If you work for the government government employees are getting their premiums negotiated and subsidize by atleast 60%

@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS If I pray for the diabolical my prayer is for eternal separation from the tyrannical oppressors. Sorry if you disagree. It is easy to be brought into their snare. Many ears ar tickled and  cant see reality. Like I mentioned I am working hard to no longer be a victim of naivety
@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS are tyrants. If you can't see it or feel it  then you are not looking beyond your own backyard or  your own cocoon. I have been involved in human right issues for a long time. I pray for the victims not  the autocratic perpretators.
@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS Sorry I disagree. He is a tyrant.  He is not alone. Trump is in the process of destroying the health care system for anyone who cannot get employer subsidized health care. His treatment of refugees. He is a racisist . He uses wealth for dominance. He and his party most certainly

@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS Sorry. I try to know people by their deeds. My prayer is for God to separate the wheat from the chaff.Iwill not pray for tyrants that have and will cause irreversible destruction to others. My prayer is to be protected from tyrants and autrocities flowing from the diabolical
@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS I have been discarding  naivet√© for some time now  Trump gave up on decency long ago.He knows it and many know it too.Wishful thinking makes one  forlorn. Truth sets you free Amen. We all realize  this in our own time Good luck though.
@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS Prayer is good. Unfortunately the diabolical reject the redeemer till the end. Their rejection of a godly demeanor goes against their soul.  They are who they are especially for those that made their choice to sell their souls long ago. Just calling a spade a spade
@DesireeSeattle @Scaramucci @POTUS God does not put his hands on anyone who rejects his image his path his word. God tells these diabolical people to depart from him forever. Unfortunately many suffer because of these types until their demise. Wishful thinking for civility for these types is impossibleüá∫üá∏Amen.

@wtmarxjr1 @WSJ Pre existing conditions have always been covered in employer sponsored group plans both private mega corp employees and government employees get health insursance regardless of health age and income. These large groups harbor the bulk of the people with pre existing conditions.
@WSJ Small business and independence  will be gone. The 666 mark will be born our freedom gone as America becomes a Goolag.
@WSJ Our democracy will be destroyed because of our unjust unequal health system. The inability to afford health care will destroy this country's economy and its social stability which is already unsound. We need a national health care program or we will fall into decay.
@SpeakerRyan Republicans are against small business Look at how they are handling insurance for small business owners and emoployees of small businesses that won't subsidize health care for their employees.Soon small business will be extinct. Don't say you weren't warned.

@SenatorCantwell Democrats must be bold on this to do right by the people who are protected by our Constitution.
@SenatorCantwell Your job is to uphold the Constitution and as the Preamble states we are to promote the general welfare. We need a national health care program not based on income age health or wealth. We all need equal access to sustain life. Health care is a right and should be treated as such

@SenatorLankford Joe Biden gave in the summer of 1992, but the situation that he was speaking about‚Äîa Supreme Court justice all of a sudden deciding to retire only months before a presidential election‚Äînever came to pass. Biden never spoke about what should happen if, instead, a justice passed
@SenatorLankford FACT: The ‚ÄúBiden Rule‚Äù had never existed until Republicans in the Senate decided to obstruct President Obama and abort their own constitutional duties to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia‚Äôs death. The rule is based on a floor speech then-Senator
@SenatorLankford MYTH: The ‚ÄúBiden Rule‚Äù stands for the principle that the Senate should never confirm a president‚Äôs nominee to the Supreme Court during a presidential election year.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Don't forget his white mother who was a maid[ no offense to maids] Of course she was white and not brown etc so he might have let her in.
@CoreyStewartVA You are a menace. Sure wish you were not back at it because you are threatening civilized citizens with your savage ways of the beast.
@realDonaldTrump Your mother was a maid [No offense to maids] she your mother would have been rejected by your merrit system unless of course your system would admit white maids and keep out the brown ones.

@AriFleischer You want a merrit system. Trump's mother who was a maid [no offense to maids]would not have been allowed to immigrate to America under your merrit system. Sounds like the restauraunt has standards too that a known offender Sarah] did not meet. What goes around comes around Amen.

@JohnCornyn if these hostages die the republicans will dump them in the desert in secret and claim they died during their pilgrimage. Watch out.
@JohnCornyn You cannot use humans as a demand unless ofcourse you want to be kidnapping terorist.  The Republicans should be considered domestic enemies and the Amrican people need to protected from them There is no law on the books requiring the separation of families
@JohnCornyn Who are the Republicans to offer anything to anyone . You take hostages inluding minors  then you use this as blackmail to coerce a different party into voting your way or you will continue to hold humans hostages. Is this not domestic terrorism?

@NBCNews Is this how Trump strongarms people to get the wall so he personally make billions off the wall through his personal connections with the cartels of the construction industry.Trump's motivation and intent appears to be money and how much he can personnaly can profit off the wall
@NBCNews Does the Trump administration and the DOJ and AG Sessions really believe they can detain all illegal people crossing the border and house the parents and the children separately? Do they really think they can detain the numbers of peoplre they arrest for any length of time.

Our taxes allow federal employees to get subsidzed health care so get off your soap box and learn priorities. Better yet just leave office.
@NewDay @KellyannePolls It is not a simple request when Trump screams to get the SOBS off the field  and says Your fired. Your fired. Many as a matter of fact want you and Trump to vacate the WH now rather than later but unfortunately its another day and you are still there. Pathetic. Yuk.
@Scaramucci know kneeling when the Anthem is played has nothing to do with disrespecting the military or this country. Hey Jet Setter don't you have a jet to catch to take you somewhere, anywhere?
@Scaramucci Hey Bud, All government employees are on the payroll of the American people. Do you think Trump and Congress listen to us the people who pay them ? Just because you have a microphone doesn't mean you carry any weight on any public issue. If you had any brains you would		'	'

@SenateMajLdr Congress gets away from their jobs.  This manuver of yours demonstrates your predjudice and lack of upholding all citizens rights to their personal beliefs and their liberty to express their beliefs within the legislative procedures. One more reason stacking up to vote you out.
@SenateMajLdr You folks get to much vacation as it is but canceling the recess because you don't like opposition to what you want shows bias and an attempt to strong arm people who disagree. The responible thing to do would be to restructure your recess time permanently so to reduce the time

@robertjeffress Those that have many of them are against a univesal medicare program for all that would be fair. So why don't you tell us just how Christian America is, but wait you will sweep that value under the carpet and pretend it is not a monumental problem
@robertjeffress Christian as long as I have mine and don't care if you have yours. Example many get their health insurance through their employers yet many who work have  employers that don't sponsor health insurance for their employers.

@WhiteHouse @FLOTUS One problem Who is paying for this?  Maybe with the funds they were suppose to use to bring health insurance premiums and out of pocket maximums down. Yep that makes this just perfect. https://t.co/qHQl5sQzYq

@GOP @GOPChairwoman and then you say wham bam thank you ma'am. Just like this tweet it will mean nothing to you  Our Country has lost any progression toward justice and civility. Well one thing is for sure you won't have my vote but since there is no higher power to make you do right losing my vote
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Yep uoi have done stuff alright. You have taken hardworking Americans that work for small business and made health insurance for them and their families unaffordable, To you they are a small part of the population to you they don't count To you you take their tax dollars they pay
@SpeakerRyan Small buisness is not optomistic because they can't keep employees due to the completely dysfunctional health care system Congress has created What planet are you living on Planet Elite 1 percent.

@KamalaHarris Stop burying the health care disaster. We need a remedy so that Americans are not suffering from disparity if they work for small business  We pay taxes we want to be treated equally and need protection against unequal treatment. This issue will not go away you can't bury it Amen

@amyklobuchar @brianschatz Why do you pretend this is not a problem Why are you burying this life threatening circumstance. There is no excuse for burying this issue. We pay government we are not second class citizens. Perhaps God will smite all on both sides of the aisle for this abhorrent injustice Amen
@amyklobuchar @brianschatz Why is no one fighting for responsible health care. Do you think this problem will just go away. People working for small business cannot get employer sponsored health care. We pay the same tax as everyone else. Small business employees need affordable health care
@ChrisMurphyCT @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris @SenBlumenthal @SenGillibrand @brianschatz @tammybaldwin @SenatorTomUdall @MartinHeinrich @SenatorShaheen This act should not be based on poverty level it should operate like Medicare and the Medicare Advantage plans at the very least. From what i have read about this the plan still looks at income. Employer sponsored plans are not based on income Medicare choice should not be either
@SenatorHeitkamp @USTradeRep @inforum This disparity will not go away until this inequality is corrected. Congress needs to address this until it is solved and not divert attention to everything else.
@SenatorHeitkamp @USTradeRep @inforum Small business employees need affordable health care they need to be protected against discrimination There should be a health program that is not based on age wealth or health like federal employees get since we the taax payers employ the federal government.
@tinygovern @ScubaForDogs @AStableJeenyus @SenSanders Health care is a right it is not only for the citizens working for large corporations or large governments. People that work for small business accross America do not get employer sponsored health care Does everyone have to work for Mega Corps to survive
@tinygovern @ScubaForDogs @AStableJeenyus @SenSanders If you are a consumer you are being extorted. We are all paying for everyones health care when you get employer sponsored health care they pass that cost to the goods or services they sell with inflated prices.
@WaysandMeansGOP @SusanWBrooks Removed the personal exemption for each member of the household and is leaving people in the middle class who are  without employer sponsored health care with completely unaffordable health care. Great job to bad these middle class tax payers and voters don't count. Snake oil.

@cathymcmorris My tax advisor provided a side by side for this year's tax and next year's tax and under the new law if we have the same income we would pay over 2000.00 more in taxes. So much for keeping more in your pocket. ask your tax advisor for a comparison and find out for yourself
@RoyBlunt @GOPSenFinance @dailyjournalmo My tax advisor said if my income stays the same next year under the new law we would pay over 2000.00 more in tax.  Someone is fabricating th results of this new tax bill  The question is who.

@GOP Don't be fooled by them doubling the standard deduction. This tax bill was for corporations so you then can work harder and pay more because the corporations won't.  Snake oil.
@GOP My tax preparer said with the same income next year my taxes will go up atleast 2000.00. SO you should check with your accountant before you vote in November so you don't find out when it is to late that you could pay more and the GOP is lying..
@SenateGOP i just had my taxes prepared and was told with te new tax law we would be paying atleast 2000.00 more with the same income. Wha tis the GOP talking about sounds like lies and misrepresentation

@iamcricket @washingtonpost I hate to say but this time it is the Democrats selfish stance that did this. The Democrats have voted for bills with the Hyde Amendment many times before this was nothing new. This is the Dems fault and i am not a Republican. Disgraceful narcissim at its finest.

@SethHanlon @GovHowardDean not fly. God damn them. The Democrats should be damned for this unconscionable act. This will destroy the Democrats if they don't fix this mighty quick. Their souls are at stake. Amen. Nancy Pelosi needs to go. Again I am not a Republican.
@SethHanlon @GovHowardDean arrogance. The Democrats own this  lock stock and barrel. The Democrts have approvd bills with the HYde amendment since 1976.  But not this time so now millions will be helpless and cannot afford proper care. I am not a Republican but  this time Democratic propaganda just does
@SethHanlon @GovHowardDean This statement is an abonination . There was finally a chance to reduce insurance premiums by 40% and bring back CSRS The DEmocrats for selfish extremist views would not do what was best for millions of Americans. Now millions of Americans must suffer because of Democratic
@amyklobuchar @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenKamalaHarris I wouldnt be flying high.  Democrats wouldn't agree to abortion-restriction language in the proposal  so now there is no vote on it and millions in obamacare health market will not get a reduction in premiums or get CSRS Abominable.üåéüôè
@amyklobuchar @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenKamalaHarris I wouldn't be flying high Also left out of the bill is a health care market stabilization measure authored by GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine, which aimed to lower premiums.
@amyklobuchar @SenatorLankford @LindseyGrahamSC @SenKamalaHarris What about the 40% decrease in health premiums and CSR'S you could have voted for in  the omnibus stabilizing the marketplace you were offered. Dems said no now millions still can't afford health insurance in America. Bad Move. It was a start.  This is unconscionable.
@PattyMurray When you think a blue wave is coming you might find yourself in a desert instead if you vote stupidly.   https://t.co/RimDbuJKbc
@PattyMurray Aren't you concerned about reducing health care premiums by 40% and bringing cost sharing back. This is on the table now. Do your due diligence Millions of people need their health care premiums and out of pocket expenses down now.
@SenBennetCO @POTUS chew the fat about Facebook after you agree to reduce are health care costs please.üåéüôè
@TopherSpiro Who cares about Red Blue Democrat Reoublican What counts now is bringing back cost sharing and reducing premiums hopefully by atleast 40% for millions that work for e,ployers that won't subsidize their employees health care.  Wake up insults do not pay bills.üåéüôè
@SenBennetCO @POTUS The problem at hand right now is health care . Would like medicare for all but We are concerned with decreaseing health care preniums by 40% and cost sharing We dont want to bicker about Facebook health care costs for millions is vital.Wake up and smell the coffee
@amyklobuchar We are concerned with decreaseing health care preniums by 40% and cost sharing We dont want to bicker about Facebook health care costs for millions is vital.Wake up and smell the coffee please.üåéüôè
@rollcall The Democrats are being irrational and unreasonable this bill is a start. Premiums and cost sharing is dire. Grow up Democrats. This is a start. It is better than nothing. Medicare for all is probably best but slashing expenses by 40% with this bill will help millions.  üåéüôè
@rollcall The democrats have been approving bills with the Hyde act since 1976 why not now. Why punish many hardworking americans who can't get health care from their employers.  Comprehensive heath care is vital. The individual states can help with abortion.
@rollcall It appears the Democrats are at fault on this bill that could help those without employer sponsored health care. The bill would reinstate CSR and would reduce premiums up to 40% which is better than nothing. Democrats are saying no to the bill because of abortion and the Hyde act
@PattyMurray Don't hold Americans hostage for one small area of care which Democrats have been voting on for years.
@PattyMurray Amercans who cannot get employer sponsored health care their  premiums and deductibles and out of pocket costs are unaffordabler  for millions. If those vital expenses can be reduced by 40 percent why block it. Especially when the Hyde amendment has been in place since 1976.

@RepSwalwell The problem with making more is everything will keep costing more food housing transportation utilities clothing and of course health care. The problem is we live within  a cuture where greed and narcissim rule. Therefore people will never have enough and the society will crash.
@SenateMajLdr @WSJ The Republican party constant noise about tax reform is obnoxious.
@SenateMajLdr @WSJ The idea behind it is that, by exposing you to your fear, you will eventually see it as less fear-producing. For example, a therapist may take a person who is afraid of dogs into a kennel to expose them to a large number of dogs in a controlled situation.
@SenateMajLdr @WSJ Flooding	Flooding is a form of behavior therapy used to treat people with fears or phobias. In flooding, the person with the fears is exposed to the thing that frightens them for a sustained period of time.
@realDonaldTrump That does not matter to the Republicans . Republicans beleve only the privleged American citizens should be able to get health care.  Everyday you believe this ideology people die because of Republican neglect of their Constitutional duty.
@realDonaldTrump Problem is the farmer's employees will probably not get employer sponsored health care so therefore they will work for farmers but won't be able to afford health care for themselves or their families.
@SenSanders Universal affordable health care is a foundational start.
@VoteMarsha @lipscomb there is more to securing prosperity for generations than being only for the privledged to afford health care.

@MSNBC . They are addicts and a danger to themelves nd others. They lie and try to make peope believe you have to arm yourself shoul martial law be declared. These wapons they are obessed with will not save anyone from martial law. They are addicts and should be treated as such.
@MSNBC The NRA is an organization of addicts. Thy say they are not addicted . They say they are rational They twist the 2nd amendment to legalize their fiixThey are addicts. They blame others for what they promote as normal hey have gotten their way desguised in the name of self defense
@SenBobCasey They are not sane  they are addicts just like any other addict and should be treated as a menace to society
@SenBobCasey The millions in love with their weapons are addicts. They should be treated as addicts by responsible mmbers of our society and our lawmakers should know these people are addicts with an obessive conpulsive disorder coupled with paranoia and a need for control and superiority.
@marcorubio Rationalizing mental illness in the name of the 2nd amendment is not acceptable. It is not alright. They have an adiction like any other addict. They should be treated like any other addict a danger to themselves and to others.They don't have the right to twist the 2nd amendment
@marcorubio Owning an arsenial of assault weapons should be considered as threatining others and considered attempting to cause durress and death to law abiding members of society. Someone needs to stand up to these maniacs.
@marcorubio The millions of people that hang on to their weapons for dear life are mentally ill. They have a sick syndrone for power and  an obsessive compulsive disorder ccoupled with a paranoia of loosing their superiority. They do not have the right to distort what civil liberty is.
@NBCNews @nbc6 The court should impose mandatory psych evaluations for the Reps that  voted down a motion to consider a bill to ban assault weapons. Why because they have demonstrated they are  danger to themselves and others.
@NBCNews Why are these people so obsessed with weapons. Owning and promotig weapons is seriously insane.    Psych mentality. Somehing is seriously wrong with these types.
@MSNBC @PressSec A society of ravenous wolves.
@MSNBC @PressSec People in general that have a need to own  many dangerous firearms are all psychologically damaged. There is no rational reason to own a houseful of guns There  is no sane reason for this. The need for firearms in  itself is  a mental illness. So many depraved minds in society.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar demented ideology brought on by underdeveloped minds that are prehistoric uncivilized and these minds unfortunately are leadig our country away from civility and toward greed and glutton . Pence is a hypocrite.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Health care in this country should have nothing to do with ones pocket book status in life health age or condition. It is the ignorance of our leadership to mislead Americans. The foundation of the political premise that it is based on ability to pay or other circumstances is a
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar He wants to claim he is driven by Jesus great but his ideology and deeds do not correlate with that claim. Any honest observer knows the results of his actions.Citizens are impacted by his wheeling of power. People are not fooled by his claims. Know them by their deeds. Simple.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Not talking about wealth. I am talking about what rules your motivations. Your intent. Money is a tool that can be used for good or evil.  Our Constitution is a frame work for our society. Pence says he is motivated by Jesus his deeds say the opposite.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar addressing. Matthew 6:24 New International Version (NIV)	24 ‚ÄúNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.  Perhaps this sums it up
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar If you don't know by now where he stands on health care there is nothing i can point out to you that will cause you to see the truth. I have done my homework I know his position on the the disparityon halth care  and other issues of disparity our representatives should be
@Scaramucci Guess Congress is waiting for a massacure on 5th ave Someone might think they can let loose on 5th ave because Trump said he could shoot people on 5th ave and he would still win the election. Demented minds create demented laws that turns a civilized society into cannibals
@MeetThePress @SenatorLankford Lankford is demented enough to be a cannibal.
@MeetThePress @SenatorLankford Senator Lankford is irrational and demonstrate no ability to implement civilized law. No civilian needs an assault weapon.   These blood thirsty maniacs do not belong in a law making position. They are incapable of making sound rsponsible laws. They are nuts. God help us. Amen
@MeetThePress @RickSantelli Well at least you would not be putting th weapons in their hands with a pretty bow on it and a gift card saying this is for you.
@realWinstonMN @realDonaldTrump Yes there is something Ican do about it. Not vote forTrump and his vulgarity.
@realDonaldTrump Can't vote Republican. Republicans lack civility. America is not a land only for the fittest prowling the jungle for conquest and prey. Everyone is not a ravenous wolf like you inside. Your character is depraved Your money just multiplies your vulgarity.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar This belief is uncivilized and lacks intelligeence and enlightenment This belief shows he serves mammon and not God. Quality of life does not end at birth.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar One major vote is his belief on health care. For someone who claimes to be prolife he feels health care is a privledge and not a right . So he believes babies should be born but should only get health care if the baby is privledged and grows up to be a priveledge person.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Sorry but i believe him to be a deceiver and the opposite of a follower of Jesus. I don't believe he is a decent man. Not being alone in a room with a woman does not mean he is faithful to God. He uses his proclamation of faith as a political tool. His votes say he is a hypocrite
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar He uses his faith as a political tool. He is the one that brings his so called faith into governing. He talks about it all the time. His voting record and his statements on how he thinks th country should function are that of an Anti Christ doctrine
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Graham runs that organization rom what i read not Pence. I believe Joy Beher was referring to Mike Pence and Graham is defending Pence
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Don't confuse the right and left hand hand of God with the right and left political political wings.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Then He will answer them, saying, ‚ÄòAssuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.   Hopefully you can see the difference between Pence and what the Holy Spirit and Jesus instruct.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.‚Äô		44 ‚ÄúThen they also will answer Him,[b] saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?‚Äô 45
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar ‚ÄúThen He will also say to those on the left hand, ‚ÄòDepart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: 42 for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in,
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar I was in prison and  you came to visit me.'.  The word of God is the opposite of Pence's ideology. I believe Pence is an operator who proclaims faith for political gain by deceiving the unknowing.
@myown4859 @Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Matthew 25:35-40 New International Version (NIV). 35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, 36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me,
@MSNBC @HardballChris Enough time has gone by for these people to have smelled the smelling saltz and come around. You don't have to be a Clinton Democrat to know at this point Russia is and has been interferring.
@renato_mariotti Will we ever kow the truth. The Trump campaign was not made up of babes in the woods. Hope this investigation is not corrupted but unfortunately it could be.
@Franklin_Graham @JoyVBehar Hearing from the Holy Spirit is not mental illness but what VP Pence hears is not coming from the Holy Spirit There is a differece. Pence and his ideology is not through Jesus Christ  Anyone who hears know the difference.
@Franklin_Graham The lord's guidance iss essential to living a civilized life. I have to say your promotion of Trump makes no sense. If you spare the rod the child is spoiled. The holy spirit cannot be telling you to promote Trump. He is not telling me that and there is only one Holy Spirit.

@NBCNews Why are people like chuck grassley re elected over and over. There are enough voters from different demographics that know better and are capable of voting congress people out like grassley IA cruz TX  and enzi of WY. Nothing will change with those types in control.
@SenBlumenthal The uncivilized create a less civilized society. Until America stops thinking wolves are sheep it will only get worse. America needs to think about whay each member of Congress is for and what they vote for and then separate the wheat from the chaff. Incivility breeds incivility
@CoryBooker Enough is probably enough when family members of Congress or the Executive branch ane affected unfortunately.  Best to vote the uncivilized ones  out of Congress and the Executive branch so  to implement more humane laws.

@JTMann05 @SenSanders Seriously. Koch Industries =  ifrastructure products. They make money Republicans make money. and you know Trump loves infrastructure. Republicans and Koch industries an American racket. Pay to play.
@SenSanders Pay to play,
@SenSanders Mick Mulvaney and his kind have pigeoned holed the poor the sick and the elderly. The Koch brothers and their privately held corporation which is well diversified with segments selling infrastructure products will benefit from infrastructure appropriations.
@RoyBlunt @SenateGOP @TysonFoods Will Tyson customers get a bonus from Tyson lowering their prices on their products significatly from thei hugh tax break that will be permnent.  Seems like hugh tax breaks should give the consumr reduced prrices forever.
@WhiteHouse Will Koch industries  a privately owned conglomerete be the sole company supplying pipe gypsym fuel etc for rebuilding the infrastructure. We are under Koch control. They are hugh donor to Republican agenda. They make money Republicans make money.

@thehill Cruz is an ungody creature. Know him by his deeds. When wiill Texas realize the truth about what kind of man Cruz really is. An ungodly menace against anything said in God's word. Idon't understand why God has not sent a plague to cleanse Washington DC.
@SenSanders We live i an uncivilized world. It isgetting more uncivilized everyday. Personally i don't undrstand why there is no divine intervention  If there is a God he is letting planet earth go to the abyss.There is no hope for emlightenment anymore.
@cathymcmorris Someday peoples lives will be better without you. Stop telling everyone how things wil be . Stop implying and imposing your point of view on everyone. Many don't agree with you. Just stop.
@cathymcmorris NOW can all these wonderful corporations lower their prices for all consumer since many hard working Americans live in small towns accross America and wont be getting raises or bonuses or even healthcare from their employers.  Republican racket never ends.  You are so ignorant.
@GOPLeader https://t.co/XbvJDjsZvw
@cathymcmorris @POTUS We hate you. You are a witch that will someday meet your maker who will judge you by the destructive policies you voted into law.  Jesus and his word is true.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @dcexaminer What you don't get Jr. Is your daddy is president. So what someone else did or didn't do is a separate issue. What someone else did or did not do has nothing to do with what the Trump family has done. You keep pointing fingers. Look in the mirror and say Oh it is what I did

@SpeakerRyan GEEE Now that all these health care companys are paying so much less tax there should be no reason all health care prices to consumers can't be slashed  right.
@NicolleDWallace When people lack civility all that mattrs to them is pleasure which includes money and the pleasure they get from it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @dcexaminer Yes siree. They sure could.  You are for affordable health care aren't you Jr.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @dcexaminer Geeee now that they are making so much money with their huge tax breaks you would think they would lower health insurance premiums rather significantly. They could get the ball rollig so all companies could do the same thing.The whole health care industry could slash their prices

@SRuhle WAay to extreme and banks and corporations could borrow money at our expense for almost free. Not right. Many demographics have been hurt. Not everyone wants to take on risk but with no interest paid by banks people have had to.
@SRuhle He is right that the Fed kept the interests rate ridiculously low for way to long. This did not start with Obama it started with Bush as we all know. Rates never should have gone to zero.  I think Sean is wacky but rates never should have stayed down through Obama[s presidency.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Trump and Fox live in a constant state of psychosis.  Hope concrete evidence if the Mueller ivestigation is legitimate will teach the Trumps and Fox that money will not buy them freedom nor allow them to blabber this psychosis scheme endlessly
@RepMarkMeadows Your resume tells us you are not right for the job.  There needs to be better qualification rule so just anybody cant be allowed to vote on laws. You are clearly wrong for the job. Opening Aunt D's resturaunt and being a college drop out does not qualify you  for the job.
@RepMarkMeadows maek meadows you have been a resturaunt owner and a real estate developer. Everyday you demonstrate you do not have the ability to be a lawmaker. What is someone like you doing in government anyway. Why is your state electing someone as incompetent you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hey Jr. Do you truly believe you are an epert on all things.   You are sounding stupid.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you think all your talking around the issue is going to get you and your family out of the legal mess you so willingly got yourselves into. You see Jr. there comes a time where money just wont buy you out of the trouble you are in.üí∞  Amen  In God we trust.
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz @YahooNews Who do these crazy people think they are fooling. Mr pretty frat boy is a loser.

@thehill When because this country is falling apart from the silence from the mueller investigation. The silence and time this is taking is allowing political operative to cause havoc upon Americans. We need evidence from Mueller now.
@politico @JakeSherman @apalmerdc Is anyon after all this willig to fall for his dribble.
@thehill Trump has sawdust between his ears. Yet this is no excuse for his criminal activity.
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Why is crazy Jim Jordan protecting Trump and the Trump organization when it is likely The Trump organization has committed crimes against America. This is truly sick. For God sakes Carter Page was under suspicion. Why does Jordan want to obstruct.
@politico In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
@politico Trump needs to be arrested for crimes against America. The longer it takes to bring him down the more divided America will become . Don't be bribed by bonuses. He is scum. The truth will be revealed hopefully before it is way to late.  Our justice system must prevail.
@KondianRick @kimalyceosteen @RepMattGaetz Like it or not we need to know th truth and we need to know now.  To much brainwashing and propafanda happening. We need evidence from the investigation we are paying for. Mueller needs to show evidence or this division will destroy Amrica.
@KondianRick @kimalyceosteen @RepMattGaetz i use to believe the Dems were evil. I am sure some are. Now the Repubs have proven they are evil and what is going on in  this country is very serious. We need to know from Mueller if the Trump organization has committed crimes against America without Repub  obstrution.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Here's the bottom line Jr.    Mueller needs to give us an update on the Trump organization. We need to know if thee Trum organization committed crimes against America. All the rest of this is spin and partisan distortion. This frenzy will end with an update from Mueller.
@thehill Mueller must give the people an update We are paying for the Mueller investigation. I want to knowwhat we are spending our money on. We want to know if the Trump organization committed crimes against Americaand we want to know now.
@thehill Does this agriculture specialist think all political beliefs are the same. Does Nunes realize the people at the DOJ FBI and the State department have a right to vote for the candidate of their choice. Here is the bottom line is there evidence of the Trump organizations guilt
@HouseDemocrats @RepHanabusa @realDonaldTrump Trump is dividing us folks. We are well divided. Mueller needs to give us something . Real evidence. The rest of this is destructive spin
@thehill This guy is a dentist not a top crime specialist.  When will these people get out of our government.
@politico Plenty of time to have gotten a money trail. Be the peacemaker set us straight,  There is  crime wiyj The Trump organizatio or there isn't enough i enough.   Time to put up or shut up.
@politico Out with it Mueller Give us something because giving us nothing is perpetuating a destructive Anerican crime.  We don't need it all just the evidence you have. No excuse at this time to show us nothing. It makes us feel you are a fraud.
@politico There has been enough time to have evidence one way or the other. The people need to know from Mueller where his investigation stands. OUR government is divided nd destroying itself.
@politico Mueller needs to step into this mess before America is destroyed Either he is going to show evidence of guilt with the Trump organization or he he will show evidence The Trump organiztion is not guilty. Doing nothing at this point is endangering America.
@Jim_Jordan @RepGosar @realDonaldTrump If the FBI would not survail potential domestic enemies who are know to be suspicious what should they do flip a coin or draw a straw. Go ahead destroy America. It will be on you.
@Jim_Jordan @RepGosar @realDonaldTrump You have no idea if the dossier is fake You have no idea if Trump is a domestic enemy. Youare a dentist you are not NCIS You may be guilty of obstruction of justice. You are a dentist not a trained crime specialist. You are disgusting.

@RepMarkMeadows You are a dope and i hope you are run out of town with your tail between your legs. In Jesus name I  pray. Amen In God we trust. In justice for all.
@RepMarkMeadows they were incompetent like you did when Comey did not reccommend prosecution of Hillary. I think there should be a fisa warrant attained for you since you dont want to protect us against foreign and domestic enemies.
@RepMarkMeadows Carter Page's activities were suspicious. Th court approved the warrant. How else would the FBI investigate  toss a coin and say heads or tails.. They need evidence. Also if the FBI did nothing and a Democrat was involved you would have been the first person in Congress to say
@RepMarkMeadows Hey Meadows. The FBI receives information on a character that was doing business for years with Russia. Because the information raised suspicion a Fisa Warrant was requested through the court
@DonaldJTrumpJr That means it was suspicious and needed further investigation no matter the source. Keep talking dope. What you say or type or tweet may be held against you.

@HuffPostPol Nunes is not an intelligence expert or scholar. He is a farmer educated in agriculture. He is not qualified to be on intelligence commttee let alone be the chairman.   Why on earth is Nunes involved with this with his expertise in agriculture.
@SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr No thanks. Your doctrine is not my doctrine. Amen.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerRyan P. Ryan's rule of law and the true rule of law are not the same. He follows a false doctrine and has for years if you follow his ideology and what he is for and what he is against.
@desiderioDC Pence is a racist. His doctrine is that of the anti christ.  He is not a follower of Christ. He believes in the anti christ doctrine. Know them by their deeds. Don't be deceived.
@thehill Nunes is an agriculture specialist. not an intelligence specialist. How did he ever get to be chairman of the intelligence committee   Sorry but he was an illogical choice. He is not an expert.
@thehill Nunes is a farmer with an MA in agriculture. Why would anyone appoint a person with an agriculture background chairman of a government intelligence committee.  Illogical.

@tedlieu Time to fill Guant√°namo  with our deomestic enemies the Republicans.   The MUELLER investigation needs to step it up or America is not going to believe anyone wants the truth. Screw the memo we want the juicy details on money laundering and deals made by Trump with Russia.
@matthewjdowd @NicolleDWallace The Memo sounds like a bad play that closes before th third act. What a stupid stratagy put together by the phony Republicans.  Lets see Trump deals with Russia and the money laundering.   That non fiction novel might be the best seller.
@matthewjdowd @NicolleDWallace The lunatic Republicans wrote the memo. The memo is absurd. The evidence of money laundering by Trump now that is something the American people want to see.
@RandPaul You are a hypocrite. Amen.
@RandPaul Life is from the cradle to the grave and beyond as well  Your concern for life ends with birth. From there you deprive that life from having life saving medical care and other essential needs with your beliefs and votes.. You are right about one thing Rand Paul you will be judged
@RepMarkMeadows Great lets see the memo.  written by Republicans who are intent on destroying  American democracy. You will never shove your ideology down Americans throats even if you use waterboarding to force us. Republicans are criminal conspirators.
@SenTomCotton @hughhewitt No you are a criminal with your intent to conspire and destroy American Democracy Dn't want to hear your spin to HELL AMEN You are disgusting to say the least.
@TGowdySC @foxandfriends @FoxNews Won't watch. The Republicans have proven they want to destroy American Democracy and Fox is just part of the conspiracy. Your spinning your way into HELL AMEN.
@rollcall @MrWalterShapiro Trump is the comedy and the tragedy. https://t.co/zKU7wqkKHG
@SenJeffMerkley @ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr I don't think I would believe what is happening to America if it was not happening. Someone or something has to make this domestic enemy stop. Amen.
@Rkaycue @RepAdamSchiff @SenFeinstein The Republcans wrote the memo. Is anyone suppose to believe anythin they wrote.  Why the suspense when the Repubs wrote the memo. This is insane.
@RepAdamSchiff I sure hope there are enough commanding officers in the military that will disobey the President and Congress when the the Republican party along with Trump are charged with treason and conspiracy to overthrow our Democracy.  Amen.
@RepAdamSchiff The Republicans write a memo and it is suppose to criminalize the Justice Department that is investigating the Trump organization for obstruction collusion and money laundering and Americans are suppos to turn on the Justice Department because the Republicans wrote the memo
@politico @POLITICOMag @MikeGrunwald cant help seeing the resemblance https://t.co/qBLMOE5OVQ
@MSNBC The ignorant Reublicans wrote the memo. Why is this even news.  They wrote the damn thing. Who cares what they concocted
@SenatorLankford @ProLifeDem At birth only because once they grow up you have gone out of your way to deprive them of helth care. Sick people would do that but out creator is watching the hypocrisy.
@thehill Who the Hell cares about Lara Trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hell the God awful Republicans wrote the memo. How does the memo mean anything at all if it is written by the uncivilized Republican.  How stupid is this set up.
@HuffPostPol Nikki Haley is dumb. If she was not dumb she would not have interjected this stupid opinion.   Mindless babble demonstrating pure ignorance by the  U.S. Ambassador to the UN.  Ridiculous if she thinks people will shut up at her command.
@CNN Nkki Haley needs to realize politics has been part of the entertainment industry for a very long time.   https://t.co/d6U7cLDs6t  If war isn't politics what is.  Dopey Nikki
@UN @UNPeacekeeping Wish it could do both.
@politico TwentyFirst Century Fox is eing broken up with that Ihope the Fox news hosts will become irrelevant with less power backing them.
@thetalltexan @tedcruz They probably don't want him.
@tedcruz Mr. Cruz you are truly an abomination. Your words and deeds tell me our righteous God will disgrace you. Amen
@DAQUEENBEE1 @PressSec @SenSchumer She is not being used. She volunteered for the front line position .She is crass and spoiled by her daddy  Mike Huckabee who is one of  Trump's right wing men. They claim to be faith driven instead they behave contrary to a doctrine of faith.  Pathetic.
@KaranKaluzynski @thehill He was born in Canada. His father received political asylum here from Cuba. His mother was born in the USA. Cruz is the lowest of the low.
@thehill Cruz should be banished from the human race What a sleeze.  Does he use a tube of Brylcreem a day.
@BillCassidy You are right a Medicare for All plan with Medicare Advantage plans with rational out of pocket maximums seems like the way to go Ifonly Republicans would see the light and attempt to save their souls. The longer this takes the more blame will be placed upon you by your creator.
@SenateMajLdr Small business owners generally will not subsdize health care that is why a public health option like medicare would be an appropriate option for many hard working  Americans working for small businesses accross America. If you would only admit the truth it might save your soul.
@JeffFlake Of course he is. Trump is in the deal if the Trump Organization can make billions from the wall. The money will be made through illegal deals.  He needs to build his assets by building the wall. Another lying crime.

@WhiteHouse The wall- When people built the Tower of Babel. He scattered them and caused them to speak in different languages.

@HuffPostPol Sarah Sanders is a crass autrocity that only Donld Trump would hire as press secretary so to blatantly prove the abhorrent personality of the Republican party.
@politico And hope they do since the Trump administration and the Republicans do not have a spot of respect for people of other nations. All should walk out and then some.
@GOP I have voted GOP in the past. However due to the GOP view on health care and your rigidity and inability to do what is right for Americans as a whole and to only promote the denographics you agree with I will never vote GOP again. Amen
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are ridiculous.
@PRyan Wisconsin and accross American there are many small towns for them no raises no bonuses and no health insurance.  Employees of small businesses get nothing. but you don't care to you this demographic isnt there.
@PRyan Hey Paul Ryan can you hear us now   What about all the hard working tax paying Americans accross Wisconsin working for small businesses that wont subsidize their employees health insurance. To Republicans that demographic does not count.
@politico @louisjnelson Trump wants the Trump orgnization to make billions off the wall construction. This is most likely why he wants the wall all he sees is billions coming his way.
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump https://t.co/IbaUUkSaHG
@PressSec Sarah Sanders you are a crass autrocity that only Donld Trump would hire as press secretary so to blatantly prove the abhorrent personality of the Republican party.
@politico I suppose Schumer realized that the only reason Trump wants to build the wall is so the Trump organization can make billions through the contracts to build it .We the people are not dumb enough to believe Trump pushing for the wall would be for any other reason.
@jaketapper @PressSec The Trump organization builds  buildings etc.. Trump wants the wall so the Trump organization can make billions probably in secret deals from the construction of the wall.. Trump just wants the billions thats all.  He wants the Trump organization to make billions from the deal.
@SenCoryGardner What about all the hard working tax paying Americans accross Colorado working for small businesses that wont subsidize their employees health insurance. To Republicans that demographic does not count. Colorado has many small towns.
@BillCassidy I suppose Schumer realized that the only reason Trump wants to build the wall is so the Trump organization can make billions through the contracts to build it .We the people are not dumb enough to believe Trump pushing for the wall would be for any other reason.

@thehill No they are tired of his distortions and his inability to  walk a straight line.   Trump lies and he is a predator and yet you want to deny the truth.
@GovMikeHuckabee No the REAL truth is it is your fault. America needs to shut down your idiotic public ridicule.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your dad  had his chance and now employees working for small businesses  accross America cannot afford health insurance for their families because their employers wont subsidize health care for their employees In your opinion they dont count. Screw you.

Small business accrossAmerica don't offer health care . STUPID. You all have a blind eye.

@WhiteHouse @SecondLady Believe in Art Therspy. Believe in affordable health care for all not just the privledged. Unfortunately this is not the belief or the goal or the intent of the Trump Pence Afministration. Abominable.

@WhiteHouse Ludicrous rual America needs affordable health care because small business does not offer or subsidize health insurance for their employees. All of rural America are not farmer. How can you be so ignorant.
@PattyMurray @realDonaldTrump There is nothing wrong with working if able what is wrong is health care that is unaffordable for non employer insurance Health care should not be based on income. Mega Corps and fed employees dont pay premiums acording to health wealth  income. or age. Medicare for all needed.
@NRSC @JoeManchinWV Americans hard working ones accross America in rural areas wher employers do not offer or subsidize health insurance for their employees will not forget Republican promises for better more affordable health care for them. .
@SpeakerRyan Republicans are gluttonous behemoths.
@SpeakerRyan Strange how these Americans accross America still have to pay tax to subsidize Congress and all Government employees  health insurance. It seems with the Republicans these Americans don't deserve protection from gouging. These hard working Americans don't count.
@SpeakerRyan Yay for Mega Corps but what if you live in rual areas across America where employers do not offer or subsidize health insurance for employees and their families Republicans pretend this demographic does not exist and  If they do realize they exist their response is screw them.

@Ocean_River @IvankaTrump Ivanka doesn't hear anything accept what the Crime syndicate tell her. Then she obeys them.
@IvankaTrump Its just the Repubs obstructing preventing the program fron doing what it was suppose to do. People that cant get employer sponsored insurance count.  Its just the uncivilived Repubs acting like they don't. This will cause America to stumble.
@IvankaTrump The economy has been recovering since Obama took over and GW left. So has the stock market just less volitility this year.  Trump didn't just wave a magic wand. The Repubs have just made their bull horn voice louder. Health care improved greatly with Obama care.

@senrobportman The people in Small Town OH don't have extra money to put in the stock market because small business will not subsidise health insurance. Must all Ohians live in Cleveland and Cincinnati  Leaving Small Town America behind will not reap you a positive reward for these people exist
@IvankaTrump Your lack of enlightenment is overwhelming. Small Towns exist and so do the people. God will not reward you for your ignorance of governing. He will not forget these people. You will not reap a positive reward. Pathetic the ignorance. Your ignorance will not be bliss.
@IvankaTrump These people don't have spare money to put in the stock market.Must all these hard working Americans abandon all these small towns and small businesses so wveryone lives in NYC or Dalls or Los angeles. You people are inept . You are too stupid to understand America.
@IvankaTrump You only think of BIG BUSINESS. MANY MANY HARDWORKING AMERICANS  WORK FOR small business where health care is not subsidized. These people are spending their hard earned money on health insurance and out of pocket expenses.

@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO actually be moving backwards and loose its status in the world. A strong militatary &amp; a robust stock market is not enough to to make the society function constitutionally.  The general welfare must be priomoted as well or again we move backward.
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO of this system. Government works for us we don't work and pay tax to fulfill the needs of government employees We work and pay tax to fulfil the people with a properconstitutional stuctures or America will become  a backward nation When America thinks it is progressing it will
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO The health system structure here is broken. Different motivvations and intent are woven into its structure. People need to look at other developed nations and not be treating health care as a for profit behemoth We need a modernized system. Archie Bunker should not be in charge
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO Mine too I was a social worker for a number of years. If One has  high IQ and is enlighted as well then 2+2will = 4.   So you might have a good IQ but many must have a high IQ and be enlightend as well to make America what it was intended to be. basic needs must be met
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO Not depraved minds creating dysfunction.   Unfortunately are government is made up of minds that are braun instead of minds with extraordinary IQs  Sad but America has developmentally challenge people  in Congress. It is what it is.
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO America is not enlighened bu it could be. I Many suffer from the Archie Bunker syndrome kinda. Americans often are hedonists and narcissist. America needs the most intelligent minds that know how to follow the constitution and formulate funtionn.
@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO Our goverenment always tries to patch the weak foundation we have instead of building a strong foundation and structure to begin with.

@DSchwertfege @Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO I  dont believe a medicare for all plan would fail if structured properly. The problem we have here is that many of the minds working in government are not intelligent enough to know how to create a functional society that will work instead of always breaking down.
@Beth21524394 @DSchwertfege @SenBennetCO Medicare for all could be tweaked to be improved
@Beth21524394 @DSchwertfege @SenBennetCO G is  medicare supplement. Straight medicare A is free and mdicare B is 134.00 per person on average G is a supplement to regular medicare . There are medicare advantage plans for zero maximums premiun with D included just haave to shop out of pocket
@MSNBC Hope not.
@Beth21524394 @SenBennetCO Health care doesn't have to be 100% free. We need an evenly distributed healthcare program for all. Medicaid today keeps people poor We need a program where all can access without making you live in poverty as other developed nations have.
@SpeakerRyan Also Promotes the General welfare  which can be different than straight up prosperity. Do you know how to do that. The answer to that is no. You are not enlightned nor do you have any common sense. We need  enlightened representatives that understand life which is not you.

@Brian18000 @charliekirk11 @IvankaTrump From Smart Asset A personal exemption is a specific amount of money that you can deduct for yourself and for each of your dependents. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your filing status is. Everyone gets the same exemption and for 2017, the personal exemption is $4,050 per person.
@TrulyMikeWalsh @Id22Diane @charliekirk11 Not really the personal exemption has been eliminated. It is possible however with the standard deduction now they may come out slightly ahead in the deduction arena. Won't make much difference though.
@charliekirk11 @IvankaTrump Did you know that the new tax law takes away the personal exemption for each family member so that a family of four deductions are less under the new law than the previous law.

@FaithBased92 @thehill Not ideal but by chance did you see Trumps tweet with CNN typed with a splatter of blood on the sole of his shoe. Oh andhe said he is leading the charge against the assault of Christmas. Guess that is okay though.
@JohnCornyn @BaltBizOnline Good going just forget about people working for small business or are self employed that cannot afford healthcare for themselves and their families because of the Republican ideology on healthcare.they dont count in fact you don't beleve they exist. I mean how many could there be
@FaithBased92 @thehill of some of our public servants. Protester used to throw human poop when protesting the Democratic convention in 1968 in Chicago. They threw human poop directly at the police. This was horse poop in a tidy package with a card.
@FaithBased92 @thehill He did not smear poop on his doors and windows or  put it on his lawn to step in or build a wall of it across his driveway it just was not a thank you card with roses. It was a wrapped box of poop No harm but an expression of disdain of what he thinks of the job performance of
@FaithBased92 @thehill His intent was to turn over the tables on the money changers. He sent a card His intent was to tell him exactly what he thought of the current administration Instead of sending him a thank you card with roses he sent him poop telling Mnuchin what he thought.
@FaithBased92 @thehill He did not break a law and it is not for you to judge that his actions were wrong biblically. God will judge each of us we will be known by our deeds. He did not threaten anyone and delivering horse poop in a box is not a crime. You can believe what you want and so can I.
@ChuckGrassley Are they discussing  the Untouchables. and Eliot Ness
@FaithBased92 @thehill 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, I was naked and you did not clothe Me, I was sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.‚ÄôWht you iterpret as anger many believe is justice. a bleeding heart is not always the way especially when the intent is diabolical..
@FaithBased92 @thehill Matthew 25:42 What I believe is not anger. Then He will say to those on His left, ‚ÄòDepart from Me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42For I was hungry and you gave Me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink,
@FaithBased92 @thehill Some people don't play nice and are destroying good peoples lives. The violin represents sympathy which I do not have for these officials. As a citizen of the USA. they are evil and they are liars. They have no decency. No bleeding heart for them. Sorry
@FaithBased92 @thehill etomology ... Flowers on violin was used as an accompaniment to a multitude of silent films and began to represent melodramatics and mock-tragedies. This was a contributing factor in the origin of the phrase "Break out the violins" as a sarcastic expression of sympathy.

@FNC_Ladies_Rule @Scaramucci @WattersWorld @JesseBWatters Whether it is their ideology or lack of education they have failed.

So bully for the small business owner already making 300,000.00  This tax bill will surely solve the disparity in America
@SenatorLankford @CBSThisMorning The couple with the Small business that will supposedly get 13000.00 off their taxes and will pay more for healthcare. Also if they have employees in their Small Business their will most likely not offer healthcare and if they do they wont subsidize.

@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr @FoxNews Tax bill told corporation you heard them and then you gave them more power to abuse.
@IvankaTrump Increasing the child tax credit does nothing. when you drop the personal exemption of over 4000.00 per family member another lie another fraud. You come out ahead the way it is now with deductions for example with a family of 4.  Do the math and include current child tax credit

@dsamuelsohn @politico The Republicans dont care about what happened or illegal activity. They just care about intimidation power and control.

@HouseGOP Ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America: This last phrase of the Preamble is a powerful statement saying that the people made this document, and the people give the country its power.
@HouseGOP Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity: The point of this phrase in the Preamble, and the constitution as a whole was to help protect the country‚Äôs hard-earned rights for liberty, unjust laws, and freedom from a tyrannical government.
@HouseGOP Promote the general welfare: This phrase meant that the well-being of the citizens would be taken care of as well as possible by the Federal government.
@HouseGOP Provide for the common defense: There was still a chance of being attacked by other countries. No individual state had the power to defend itself against attacks. Because of this, the Framers knew that it was important for the states to defend the nation together.
@HouseGOP This was an uprising of farmers in Massachusetts against the state for having to repay war debts. Citizens were worried with the keeping peace within the country‚Äôs borders.
@HouseGOP and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.‚Äù Insure domestic tranquility: One of the main reasons why the Constitutional Convention was held was because of Shays‚Äô Rebellion.
@HouseGOP The preamble of the United States Constitution is the following:	‚ÄúWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare,
@HouseGOP The Preamble along with the rest of the Constitution was written over a period of about 6 weeks. The Preamble helped explain why the Constitution was written.
@HouseGOP The Preamble is the opening statement to the United States Constitution. The preamble explains the reasons why the Framers of the Constitution made our government a republic. By doing this, the founding fathers replaced the Articles of Confederation.
@HouseGOP Preamble the introductory part of a statute or deed, stating its purpose, aims, and justification.

@JohnCornyn @SenateGOP Constitutionaly our taxes should be going to promote the general welfare.The taxes we must pay are not meant to benefit the rich who own private planes and go to private schools. Vote the lechers out.
@sarah_elphick @JohnCornyn @SenateGOP üíØ They are just hoping they can get re elected before people complete  their taxes in 2019 for 2018 and the American people see the forest from the trees or the dollars from them the cents.
@AEKouri @JohnCornyn @SenateGOP Do your homework.
@JohnCornyn @SenateGOP And the sick well you mine as well dig a mass grave you creep. You aren't a bankruptcy attorney are you.
@JohnCornyn @SenateGOP Of course then the 18 year old child goes to college and needs a student loan and all that student loan interest is no longer deductible. You say that deduction must go along with the personal exemptions. Yet the AMT should disappear  and private jet owners get tax breaks
@tedcruz Starting the plan in 2018 and not 2017 is so you can continue to sell this lie and hope tht your constiuents won't realize the scam until they do their taxes after the 2018 elections. Man your hair tonic is making you slippier and slippier
@tedcruz Could it be you are only thinking of higher income earners where the personal  exemption gets phased out and your sale of this tax plan to the middle income earners is a fraudulent lie. To much hair tonic slick.
@tedcruz Republican plan for same family New standard deduction 24,000.00 and 2,000.00 tax credit for each child. So 24,000.00 plus 2,000.00 for each child equals a total deducton of 28,000.00. Why are you misleading the public with a misrepresentation of how much higher deductions wll be
@tedcruz example Current standard deduction for a coouple is 12,700.00 This couple has 2 children so they can tke a personal exemption for 4 equals a total of 16,200.00 plus a child tax credit of 1,000.00 for each child. This family's deductions equals  30,900.00
@tedcruz So in your view doubling the standard deduction and increasing the child tax credit by 1000.00 makes up for and is saving families more than they are with where the standard deduction is currently  and eliminating the 4050.00 personal exemption for each person in the family.

@SpeakerRyan My my like you care about an unexpected expense. That was certainly demonstrated with house healthcare bill you developed. 1182.00 for the year when health premiums are that much for a month while we the taxpayers pay for your healthcare. Just stop.
@DustM_D @SenBennetCO @timkaine Small employers wont  offer or subsidize their employees insurance they are treated as scab labor. There is not going to be large corporations in every town in America so is every American going to move to a big city and work for a large corporation to get healthcare. .
@DustM_D @SenBennetCO @timkaine Medicare is not a handout. You pay a premium 134.00 to 187.00 per person.  If you work for a corporation your insurance is subsidized by your employer. Your employer is paying 60 to 70 percent of your private insurance premium same for government employees. premiums
@DustM_D @SenBennetCO @timkaine Generally prescriptions are free or small co pay . Out of pocket maximums have come down with these plans but there is still room for improvement with that. No one will be able to afford healthcare if it continues to stoke hugh profits.
@DustM_D @SenBennetCO @timkaine Medicare is not a joke. It works with Advantage plans where there can be a zero premium and you only pay medicare premium Gov and private insurance companies work together with this arrangement. Do your homework.
@tedlieu I have one better for you. Why don't Americans have equal access to healthcare.
@SenBennetCO @timkaine God damn the idiocy in this country. I hope God destroys the wickedness of the American system that treats people as expendable. To hell with America if they cannot get this right. Amen üí∞üôè‚öñÔ∏è
@SenBennetCO @timkaine Why isn't healthcare the very first appropriation of any government budget Why is this country so barbaric. Your Medicare X Choice plan should be available to everyone or I pray to God that employer sponored healthcare becomes illegal and all will buy through individual market
@SenBennetCO @timkaine Medicare premiums are same currently regardless of age or health and you only pay a higher medicare premium if your income is over 85000.00 which is much higher than The ACA subsidy cap and then the increase is less than what is on the exchanges
@SenBennetCO @timkaine Healthcare should have nothing to do with where you work or what your income age or health condition is.If you work for federal government or Apple employees insurance premiums are the same regardless of income health condition and age.

@SpeakerRyan Does Wisconsin really want this guy to represent them. I have lived and worked in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is not Paul Ryan. Wisconsin is not about destroying the lives of their neighbors. Paul Ryan is bringing Wisconsin and the entire country down with a lack of civility.
@thehill He would have you court martialed You would have to have back up like the entire military saying NO.
@TheRickWilson Not even a brand he is a fraud.
@JohnCornyn No words for you except hope Texas shows how great they are and toss you out of Senate and your attempt to pass this shows how depraved you are.

@jjwilson23 @realpestilence @CorinneMCH @untiedmethodist @thehill They would declare Martial law and freeze every ones assets and pay.
@realpestilence @CorinneMCH @untiedmethodist @thehill I have neer traveled to see hat you are speaking of but i have been told the same thing by others. Heard this is going on in China for one.
@thehill These people are predators. Definition 1.an animal that naturally preys on others. 2.   a person or group that ruthlessly exploits others.  Yep that sums it up. Impeach NOW.
@thehill Psycho Trump and he is not alone Paul Ryan was on twitter yesterday dressed in hunting clothes with his young daughter with a small dear kneeling between them saying he couldnt wait to go hunting with his children. Despicable
@politico Absolutely investigate Trump is a  liar.I don't think he even knows what is truth or fiction anymore.
@whec65 @politico Try reading a couple of pages of the published Dossier. It is out there.
@SpeakerRyan With the Repub plan they are doubling standard deduction to 24000.00 for a married couple which is less of a deduction they currently get which is 24700.00 Ryan is lying with a pout. Master of deception.
@SpeakerRyan While eliminating the personal exemption that for a couple is 12700.00 . Ryan is misleading Americans because the personal exemption of 12700.00 and the standard deduction which is currently 12000.00 for 2 =24700.00
@TMad35242 @Morning_Joe @morningmika You are assuming she is innocent. Wait for the investigation.Whatever I am done . We all have our own path to follow.
@SpeakerRyan The Repub party is made up of uncivilized power brokers that hopefully will be gone in 2018. You had your chance and proven you are low life ravenous wolves. Bye bye.
@MadelineOnMars @JBWolfsthal @SpeakerRyan Exactly.
@SpeakerRyan The majority of Americans have told you this is a bill that lacks equality and civility. You refuse to listen to the majority. You and your conscience are on your own with this no matter how much selling you do. Hopefully in 2018 they will show you what No means
@TMad35242 @Morning_Joe @morningmika No it is not okay just saying she is a paid pro .provocateur. She goes around selling unwanted aggression. Have to wait for the facts.
@thehill McConnell best do the same for Trump but he wont. Why because he abuses his office everyday he is in office. Our lawmakers are pathetic. The good news is McConnell has his own destiny.
@thehill https://t.co/4AfxgcDi7S No offense to the goat.
@TMad35242 @Morning_Joe @morningmika No means No. She was paid by playboy to allure. She is a professional and she is with Fox. Just saying. Franken said he didnt recall the incident the same way and is calling for an investigation. Big money involved in the whole deal.
@JohnCornyn We stand up against subsidizing Federal employee health benefits. Let Federal employees pay for their full premiums.  Repeal their 60-70 percent subsidizes we the people pay for. Why should we pay to make it affordable for them.
@JohnCornyn Why the heck are we the taxpayer mandated to pay taxes to subsidize federal employee insurance benefits. Heck why should we subsidize them. We do not consent to that program Let Federal employees pay for their own insurance.
@Morning_Joe @morningmika Tweeden worked for playboy and Fox and is cozy with Hannity. Being cozy with playboy means she pranced around selling her body. She is not innocent in this I dont think. Like it or not she was a pro operator of allurement.
@Morning_Joe Tweeden worked for playboy and Fox and is cozy with Hannity. Being cozy with playboy means she pranced around selling her body. She is not innocent in this I dont think.
@Belairviv @BeebeaV @DearAuntCrabby She is Cozy with Hannity she worked for Fox right there you have reasonable doubt.
@Belairviv @CaptJaneway2017 and she worked for Fox and was cozy with Hannity. Hannity is the worse ideologue.  with a microphone it would be great to find out this was a setup. Stupid Trump Fox Hannity trash plot. If Disney buys 21st Century Fox maybe Hannity would be fired.
@Belairviv @CaptJaneway2017 Don't really know but what immediately came to mind was she got paid. That plane scene looks staged and also there just happened to be a man sitting next to her who was sleeping too.. Who knows. Trump would pay anyone off.

@RepKevinBrady If you remove the personal exemption for a family of 4 which is 25,400.00 for 2017 and then double the standard deduction to 24000.00  how is that 24000.00 the new standard deduction more than the 25,400.00 personal exemption you are removing. How would this be a tax cut I ask.
@SenatorRounds Healthier. I dont think so many will not be able to afford healthcare for their families. But of course our taxes we will pay to subsidize your healthcare and all the rest of the government employees healthcare too. Fake hair and lies.

@RepDaveJoyce But our citizens working the farms roofers roofing houses etc across America and barbers cutting your hair will not have healthcare for their families or themselves. You were never in the military.why are why subsidizing your healthcare or any government employees health benefits
@thehill As long as they are removing mandates I don't want my taxes to pay for federal employee subsidies of 60-70% of federal employee health insurance premiums. Why should my tax dollars make it less expensive for fed employees.Double standard. Hell no this is not all for them parsites
@TopherSpiro If the Repubs are removing mandates I would like them to remove the mandate that takes a part of our tax dollars to subsidize federal employee insurance  premiums by 60-70%  away. Why are we mandated to contribute to federal employees insurance with our tax dollars. No.

@SenatorCollins Lots of pure evil going around without guns.  Just look at the actions of the Congress .Unfortunately evil manifests in many different forms
@tosa_tina_ I believe you are correct there are books out about systematically getting rid of independent biz and independent contractors.
@thehill cant afford insurance at all and are treated as scab labor. But people like Brady will not admit the truth.  To dumb and evil.
@thehill Really small business and independent contractors are being gauged paying for their family's insurance and their employees
@IvankaTrump @stevenmnuchin1 @USTreasury @realDonaldTrump We need a National Healthcare program for all  first to allow any functional tax plan to work. You of course will deny this fact.
@thehill If they truly cared about people dying and hurting America would have a sound National healthcare program available to all. Uncivilized.

@PRyan Is  Ryan talking about all Americans or just the ones that have affordable healthcare sponsored &amp; subsidized by their employers. Go to Hell.
@SusanWBrooks And exactly what will the cost of insurance and out of pocket maximums for Americans be for healthcare . Hmmmm.  Seriously get real.

@SusanWBrooks Your dumb enough to think your dumb tax plan will stop Americans from going bankrupt for your negligence in regards to healthcare. Grow up
@HouseGOP Pro family bankruptcy with your anti healthcare stance. So much for promoting the General Welfare. Bots.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You are not serious. Like you give a hoot about addiction. You think people shouldn't even have affordable adequate healthcare. Get lost.
@cathymcmorris There are so many faces going bankrupt from a disparaging unaffordable healthcare system in the USA. You are a robot.
@SpeakerRyan Thank God someday you will no longer be part of the American Government. Amen.
@SenatorBaldwin We need MedicareX sponsored by Kaine-Bennet.  Americans need that now.
@SpeakerRyan God gave us his word. You will not deny the truth. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
@SpeakerRyan You will fail You will see the error of your ways. You will be defeated. For God is good. God is righteous. God is Almighty.
@SpeakerRyan Also your plan will fail because all Americans need and are entitled to affordable healthcare which you deny. But you will see.

@SenJeffMerkley How about MedicareX sponsored by  Kaine-Bennet  Truly that is what Americans need first.

@EricTrump @realDonaldTrump I don't think students that were for Bernie are going to support your daddy since students can no longer deduct student  loan interest off
@SenateGOP @SenJohnThune Therefore the doubling of standard deduction will be moot.

@SenJeffMerkley And Repubs actually say they feel bad when someone dies or gets killed . Is not refunding CHIPS a civilized way to say its okay to kill.
@SenateGOP @SenJohnThune Right so pass MedicareX Choice sponsored by Kaine-Bennet and maybe we would believe something you spew out of your mouth.

@DonaldJTrumpJr You have to much gel in your hair and your necktie must be to tight.  Your caps on your teeth are clicking together.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Also I do not give consent for my tax dollars to subsidize Federal employee health ins. Our tax dollars r paying 60-70 % of their premiums.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump No because the greed of small biz owners will not foster them to provide health insurance to their employees. That's why there are mandates.

@sugaree71 @GaryCohn45 @AliVelshi @SRuhle They don't care. As Ryan said Repubs are about big biz . The healthcare structure is pitifully unequal &amp; should be challenge in court.

@thehill Seems you can say what ever you want. You might be experiencing a brain chemical imbalance and need medication. You need a doctor.
@thehill If Trump says this as private citizen so be it. If he says this officially as POTUS he is out of bounds and needs to be thrown out of game.
