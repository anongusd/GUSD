@bopinion Trains won't shorten the "distance" as the headline implies.  What trains will do, is shorten the "travel time."
@emilyjashinsky @TPCarney @FDRLST A complete break down in a sense of unity.  Everyone is doing their "own thing."  This is what individualism brings without a shared sense of ethics, mores and civics. Where has diversity flourished without sacrificing unity?  Where is the tipping point?

@NileGardiner You are absolutely correct! Time to put on the Big Boy pants and stand up. It won't be easy and maybe Briton's have become too soft. In the big picture, I hope we are never lulled into surrendering our independence again, accepting table scraps thrown to us. Let's get on with it!

Only about 3 percent of foster youths who ‚Äúage out‚Äù of the foster care system earn a college degree at any point in their lives, reports the National Foster Youth Institute.  The measure of a country is how it treats its weakest.  America!  We are abandoning our neediest YOUTH!!!
This is heartbreaking and outrageous!  "Each year, more than 200 foster kids in Colorado exit the system without a home, turned loose to begin life on their own at age 18." 77% DO NOT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL!  In America!  Unacceptable!  These children deserve to be made whole!
Only 6.7% of world's population has a college degree, yet nearly half of world's population is under 30 years of age. With each passing year it is becoming more crucial that we educate the workforce &amp; leaders of tomorrow if we want lasting global peace, stability and prosperity https://t.co/mVtJJEeBIY

A great joy in life is extending a helping hand up to young adults desiring a college education.  To them, know this:  "YOU are in control both of the LIFE YOU WANT and the person you WANT TO BE."  Don't give up and keep listening for an opportunity that's knocking.
