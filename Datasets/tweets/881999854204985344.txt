Ineffectiveness of the wall is a baseless objection. Dems don't want anything to work. Dems have voiced their intent to not stop illegal crossings. Americans want illegal crossings stopped. The wall is the first line of defense to fulfill that objective. Americans First! https://t.co/PqRiHBfXCC
You should be asking if the Democrats are worried about President Trumps continuing success which will make Americans safer and stronger.  Dems aren't for the safety/success of Americans. Their only constituents are south of the border and foreigners.  Trump Train 2020!. https://t.co/ZKXB1F8uJu

Democrats have given no viable alternatives. Democrats are obstructionists because they want illegal aliens and criminals pouring into the U.S. from the south. Democrats disregard their real constituents. Americans. https://t.co/JBpPcClMVb
Just another leftist political action to try to slow the Trump Train down. Won't happen! 2020 next stop for the Trump Train. All aboard because we are going forward with or without you. https://t.co/ZKXB1F8uJu

@RepTedLieu @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump You're right! President Trump's STOU will steer away from a National Socialist platform and will be promoting ideas that Make America a stronger and safer place to live in such as a healthy economy and protecting Americans from criminal and terrorist elements.
