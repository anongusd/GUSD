Oh, and worked in politics as a volunteer since 1994 and paid work for elections &amp; advocacy campaigns since 2008.
@GarrettWojcik @Jackalish @AOC Our current reality? Do you support anyone? Yourself?	Your reality is making sure you remember to turn in your homework and eat sometimes.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC What, 4 whole years? 6? You have zero responsibilities. 	Your hubris is that of a child. You think  you know more about policy and politics and policy than someone who has lived, paid for, and worked in politics ?	You are so cute.

@GarrettWojcik @Jackalish @AOC Kid, there are plenty of bigger threats. 	For instance, the incredibly sub-par education system in this country, of which you are most certainly a victim.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC Her cow farts crap will appear in the media and not on the house floor. 	She's ... dumb.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC you're the socialist cheerleader responding to me, cupcake.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC A debate, by definition has 2 sides. She isn't in charge of a damn thing except the arrogance she vomits on twitter and instagram.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC She was elected to represent a small district in NY. That's it. 	She doesn't get to make laws that impact me and spend my money and not hear about it.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC Do you want some pom poms and a miniskirt? 	She's an ass who uses social media to divide the country and rile up children like you. 	She is Socialist Trump.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC My 12 year old makes bold proposals, too. 	That line about her being in charge is an outright lie. 	Check out the Constitution she swore to uphold.
@GarrettWojcik @AOC Who do you think those other members of Congress represent? 		She is a servant. A freshman child with zero actual work or policy experience and, until she moved into her secured, swank, overpriced apartment, an outsider. 	Now, she's just Socialist Trump
I have never been more pissed off about automatic tax withholding as I am right now. 	What we gave up when we allowed them to take down the barrier between our labor and their pockets...
@macmomma123 The longer her party lets her say crap like that the more likely they pay for it later.

@LDoren @bdomenech Because after agreeing to not killing  babies near birth, politicians are going to realize that they shouldn't kill the other ones, either?	Why would they? Their reason now has nothing to do with life and everything to do with pretending it isn't a factor.
@LDoren @bdomenech Im not a politician. I don't feel qualified to negotiate with lives.
@LDoren @bdomenech I WANT abortion outlawed. 		What I DO is support OTC birth control, family planning, education, and the insane notion that all life is precious.
@LDoren @bdomenech So if I line up 10 babies and ask you which one we won't be killing today, you'd be able to choose?		The problem is that proponents talk about numbers, not humans.

@TheJudoJoker You mean J is your echo chamber. 	J doesn't live in this country and I couldn't care less what J has to say about how this country should run. 	We are very VERY intentionally not governed like Canada.

@TheJudoJoker I muted them long, long ago.
@TheJudoJoker Reducing the cost of doing business reduces the cost to consumers. 	Do you know what a pain it is for physicians to get paid by medicare and medicaid?	For patients to be seen?
@TheJudoJoker Are you purposely ignoring that when the state took on this problem THIS was their solution and THIS was the result??
@TheJudoJoker You have to realize how absurd it is to  argue a literal direct causation for a dramatic personal cost increase due to a government mandate doesn't mean that the government mandates won't cost more.

I asked: how much more should I let the government take from me and my 4 kids to support such inefficiencies?
@TheJudoJoker @Bobacheck @alwaysbeLEAF You missed the point. 	That cost was created by a government mandate. 	Single payer is not cheaper, nor freer than market-driven health care. 	Not insurance... health care.

I didn't even meet my deductible this year... and there are 5 ppl on my insurance. How much more should be taken from me?
@TheJudoJoker @Bobacheck @alwaysbeLEAF Look, you clearly have decided that your resume makes you the expert.	You're clearly wasting your valuable time discussing it with a lowly comms director and mom.

@Jackalish I need to be a little close to the mountains.
@TheJudoJoker @Bobacheck @alwaysbeLEAF Try Google.
@TheJudoJoker @Bobacheck @alwaysbeLEAF No, you need to make medical care more affordable. 	That means removing bureaucracy, getting out of the way of competition, and some serious tort reform.
@TheJudoJoker @Bobacheck @alwaysbeLEAF It's not "semantics."	It's math. 	Government run health insurance is horribly inefficient and expensive. Why would I spend my retirement, kids' college fund, emergency savings... on that?

@Saysyeswecan @ahal79 @JoaquinCastrotx I did. Did you?
@ahal79 So, then, an indictment isn't evidence of a crime.
@torrymeade An arrest is also not a conviction. 		Unless you seriously suggest we should just throw him (and anyone indicted ever for anything) in prison.
@ahal79 @Saysyeswecan That doesn't change the fact that all an indictment means is that a (grand) jury said a case can be made.
@ahal79 Then let's abandon that whole convince a jury thing and the courts thing and save taxpayers a ton of money!
@torrymeade Your use of the word "criminal" pre-conviction is equally lacking in credibility.		Opinions are no more convictions than indictments.
@AndrezE No, I am defending intellectual honesty and due process. 		Hard for some people to grasp, I know. Keep trying. You might get the hang of it.

@pearsonified Different discussion. 	Google, Amazon, Facebook... yeah, it would be enforced. 	You? Not yet.
@dmataconis @nooil4pacifists @UnrealAllan @Neoavatara Missing the point... these are the things you are supporting.  We've known for years that this thing was a failure of epic proportions. Yet... it went on.

@nooil4pacifists @ThatElJefe @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @Neoavatara No. I suppose what is relevant is my OT. 	These conversations aren't about cutting. They are in support of more bloat, more debt, more spending, and more intrusion... without any concern for effectiveness or necessity.
@ThatElJefe @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @nooil4pacifists @Neoavatara Is your life currently in chaos?
@ThatElJefe @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @nooil4pacifists @Neoavatara Because I don't like paying for ineffective, overpriced bureaucratic cesspools.
@nooil4pacifists @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @Neoavatara You've followed me for awhile. I haven't been silent on where to cut. 	Start with the DoD and a serious overhaul of welfare means testing. Move on to the Dept of Ed and CFPB and large basket of archaic funds and subsidies.
@nooil4pacifists @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @Neoavatara I am not completely without sympathy, but my disdain for bloat isn't going to change enough to support paying for it.
@dmataconis @UnrealAllan @nooil4pacifists @Neoavatara Wait... these people are so incompetent they cannot perform a job search?		HOLY CRAP! WTF are we paying them for then???
@nooil4pacifists @dmataconis @UnrealAllan @Neoavatara ... 	I've been there. 	I hear Amazon is hiring.
@glasshalfdrankk She is. And we all know that a YUGE twitter following it what makes for a thoughtful, effective leader.
@RogerGreeson How nice of you to not see a moral problem with employing someone else to take money from other people!
@dmataconis @UnrealAllan @nooil4pacifists @Neoavatara There are more available jobs than there are workers to fill them right now. 	Like the rest of us who face employment issues from time to time, I am sure these highly skilled people can start getting a paycheck again.

@dmataconis @Neoavatara @UnrealAllan "see things change" doesn't happen when you cheer for the status quo
@dmataconis @Neoavatara @UnrealAllan That is what I just said, Doug. 	When there is something wrong with reality, some people do something about it.	Other's don't.
@dmataconis @Neoavatara @UnrealAllan So, what you're saying is that you fall in that "not willing to do the work" category and so advocate for no one ever calling for a halt to things that are out of hand.
@dmataconis @Neoavatara @UnrealAllan I don't think you can still call yourself a libertarian while breaking out the pom poms for more spending, more govenment, and mob rule. 	Kinda flies in the face of that whole individual liberty thing.
@Neoavatara @UnrealAllan @dmataconis This conversation just affirms that my decision to escape politics was the correct one. 		Because I just cannot with arguments about the will of the majority. Who gives a crap what the majority wants? That isn't how this works. Or, it's not supposed to be how it works.

@RealJamesWoods Investors are but one part of the bitcoin economy. 	The USD valuation is no more the value of bitcoin than the stock price of Amazon was when it launched.
@michnic70 Remember what I said about thinking bitcoin's value is rooted in the USD valuation?	You use cash but are you a currency trader? You use Google, but do you hold shares? 	Investors are one part of the bitcoin economy.

@Plaidypus07 Everyone one of those kids has parents with skin in the game. THERE is your representation. 	Pay increases have nothing to do with caring. 	Being pissed that charter schools are coming is also not about caring.
