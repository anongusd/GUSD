@innismir The Brewers will probably give me A-Fip next season.
Because as this could play out, MKE will have two major league stadiums with not-so-hot names: American Family Insurance Park and Fiserv Forum.
I understand the need to get a good naming rights deal, given MKE is a small market.		I hope some creative marketers for both American Family and the Brewers have come up with a decent name.
"American Family Park" (AmFam Park) might work, but it's hard to have something roll off the tongue when the sponsor has such a long name.

I wouldn’t mind if both teams had a chance on offense, but more “fair” overtime rules ends up being more complicated in the lawyer-like NFL.		Unpopular opinion: The old sudden death overtime was just fine.
People complaining about the “coin flip decided the game” should ask: Did the coin make those great 3rd down throws?
Burkhead did nothing early on this season. I should know, I drafted him in my fantasy league.		He ends up having a huge playoff game.
