The bill expands the VA Caregiver Support program, supporting veterans of all eras.
By consolidating the VA's seven community care programs into one, the bill will provide veterans with access to efficient, timely, quality health care and services in their own communities.
Thanks to the new Veterans Community Care Program, the bill will ensure all veterans will have the option of seeking care when and where it makes sense for their needs.
A new Veterans Community Care Program will streamline the delivery of health care to veterans and replace the Veterans Choice Program.
The #VAMissionAct is a bicameral, bipartisan bill that will improve health care for our veterans.
