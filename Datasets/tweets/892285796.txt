He spent his 8yrs blaming the economy on President Bush. He only takes credit for the good. It was Obama who doubled our debt not anyone else. President Trump has turned our country around and we can’t let the Dems take that away. We must continue to build for our children.#KAG!
In the last 2yrs what have the Dems done to improve your daily life? What did Obama do in 8yrs to improve our lives? Not a damn thing Obama killed jobs. He said they were gone forever. President Trump has brought them back. Obama trying to take credit for today’s economy.
If you like being able to pay your mortgage and keeping your home this is your America. If you prefer to struggle to pay your bills and want a low paying job then vote for your Dem. President Trump made us promises if we supported him and he has kept them. We must keep ours.
Reminder Dems remember your day to vote is Thursday Nov 8th don’t forget to mark you calendars. Polls open 5AM-7PM no ID needed.

It’s time we have a Govt all can trust and be proud of as an American. We elected President Trump to be the person to turn us around in the right direction. He has shown himself to be a honorable man. He made promises and have kept them. He scares the left.
If you don’t mind corruption within our Govt vote Dem. If you prefer a clean Govt for the people then you must vote GOP. Don’t let the investigation end we need to give us a clean Govt to serve us. It’s here for us not just those with the money to buy favors.
Let them know they are anti American, demand the wall be built. Do not give them one minute of peace to eat in a public restaurant. Gather at their homes disturb their sleep. We need to give them a healthy taste of risistance.  Senate should table any bill they send.. #VoteRed
We must keep congress but in the slim chance we may not we react not go away with our tails tucked. Remember how we were treated by the left and return the favor. Resist and in public places harass them like they did us. Gather crowds to where they are call them baby killers.

We never attacked like the Dems have President Trump. He’s not your average politician that’s why I voted for him. I wanted someone who could bring change to America for the people not the politicians. After all this is mine along with many mores country. He gave us a voice.
Hillary how can anyone be civil with you when your the uncivil one? During Obama’s turn as POTUS how many from his administration were chased out of a restaurant and not able to eat without harassment? I can tell you it’s easy 0. If we didn’t vote Obama we dealt with it.
The dogs of hatred was released by Hillary Clinton the day she lost her race to be the most powerful person on earth. The Dems have done nothing but encourage violence between our two political parties. Maxine Waters is their ring master to all Dems. Modona likes using bombs.
@cis_gracchus @LuckOfTheDraw45 The left is extremely desperate. They can actually feel the power slipping away and unable to get a good grasp on it. They’ve used way too much vasoline trying to screw too many of us with their lies and mob actions.#VoteRed2018🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

Who else likes to destroy people? Sounds like a Clinton move. If this is what Dems say deserve to get them elected into power I’d be scratching my head. Is destroying lives a good move? Is this what our fore fathers had in mind? It’s all about power with the Dems.
I agree with Pam Bondi people charged with murder would get better treated then Brett Kavanaugh was by our senators. Now they’ve got their delay tactic going let’s see how many more stories come out of nowhere. The Dems have one motive destroy this nomination and his family.
How can Dems wouldn’t be good justice? They refused to get involved until Sen Feinstein showed letter she had been setting on. That’s a dirty play for a senator. This was a unfair dirty play out of desperation by Dems to stop this nomination. A disgrace to America!#KAG!🇺🇸
It’s a good thing your on your way out this move wouldn’t get you voted back for another 6yrs. Judge Kavanaugh has cooperated with senate unlike the Dems. This FBI report will tell you no more then you know today. It’s a delay tactic and you feel for it hook line and sinker.
@JeffFlake Why not have the FBI check and see how many times has Dr Ford flew. For someone who fears flying she sure has made many trips by plane. What other way did she have to get to Hawaii and back? The lady isn’t telling the truth. Shame on you for falling for Dems game.
How can Americans trust Dems who have represented themselves as such despicable public servants. They held info for reason we don’t know. They only used it when all else looked liked a failure.#Kavanaugh4Justice🇺🇸
Dr Ford’s legal team doesn’t control our senate and dictate what they do to finish off this off. It’s only allowing more time for false charges. Next week a woman will come out claiming to have aborted his baby in high school. Dems know no level to stop their charades.
The Dems have brought hell upon themselves. This game they’ve been playing with SC nomination will long be remember and they will face the same if they ever get the chance. Dems will stop at nothing to end this nomination. Pay backs are a bitch but their day will come.
For those dems who think ralphing is a code word your right. It means to throw up or vomit.  So now should we handle the word for farting or passing gas or do you think you got it now? Maybe FBI should check these words out for you.#KAG!🇺🇸
You held on to this info far longer then it should’ve been. Why didn’t Dr Ford want this to made public? For being afraid of flying she sure seem to fly a lot. You made us believe she was in a location where she wasn’t. Yet Dems are being the honest party. Don’t think so.#KAG🇺🇸
You’ve had no respect on how your actions would effect his family his life after hearings. Let’s face it Dems would never be happy with a not guilty result, Your that desperate for power. Your on your way out and trying to save yourself at Judge Kavanaugh’s expense.
@SenFeinstein Once again you talk out both sides. You say we believed the accused over the accuser. Isn’t that what the Dems did without any hearing? The Dems are desperate and will do whatever it takes. Today I’d be ashamed to be a Dem. You have played this dirty.
It’s time for Dems to stop playing there games. A vote is going to happen and Brett Kavanaugh will be approved as a justice on the Supreme Court. Your game is coming to an end. Now let’s expose the corruption done by the left.#justice4All🇺🇸

@JackPosobiec @Flyover_county They have some Dem buddies back here. Can’t think of any other reason can you?
It’s up to AG Sessions to clean up DOJ. Fire lower subordinates then do the honorable thing and resign yourself as the United State’s Attorney General. A silent coup was attempted by deep state members but failed.
If you go back to last presidential debate the closing of candidate Clinton statement would fit her to the letter not President Trump. Hillary Clinton is a danger to America.#LockHerUp
They’ve used false testimony to obtain warrants from our FISSAC. Members of DOJ and FBI provided courts with false information and lacked giving full disclosure of where documents were obtained and by who obtained them.
President Trump was elected by the people to governed the United States Of America. Those who were not chosen now attempt to remove our elected President need to be brought forth and respond to the people of America. They need to held accountable for their actions.
It’s time for the people to take a stand. We demand to know who has taken steps to over throw the people’s choice for a duly elected President. It’s time to expose the facts to the American people. We want to know who has given false testimony to remove our President.

They remember him as being respectful and a good guy not a partier. Females didn’t fear him or felt pressured by him sexually. Why no criminal record of a person who disrespected women in that way? Surely she wouldn’t be his only victim? Where’s the other complainants?#UsToo
Dr Ford can’t remember where it happened, what day it happened and who was there. People she has claimed were there don’t remember it happening. Would you forget a woman or girl being raped in front of you? Other women from same time period remember a different Brent Kavanaugh.
WTF? GOP is willing to let Dr Ford testify but she shouldn’t be able to make the rules. She didn’t want her name out there to start. Why? She didn’t want it public why? Why all the secrecy around her accusations? If a woman was sure an attack happened she’d have all the facts.

It doesn’t make sense too many say they don’t remember Judge Kavanaugh being a person to sexually harass a female. He appears to be respectable to women. He adores his wife and daughters it shows. Any skeletons in your closet?#Ustoo
Why should the accused go first in hearing? It should be the accuser go first then offer rebuttal for the accused. Allegations should come before anything. This is all a power play and the Dems will lose in the end. Brent Kavanaugh will be approved he deserves it.
@SenSchumer The FBI has done all it can in the Judge Kavanaugh investigation. If Ford’s accusation are fact then why let him hold other Federal positions? Why did Diane Feinstein hold on to letter for over 6wks? Too many questions of how and why to find truth.

If you’re proud of your actions then take credit for your action. You’re one of the reason we have to retain congress and continue to investigate the corruption from previous administration in their attempt to reverse the will of the people. Hillary couldn’t accept the results.

It was Obama who sent message to Putin he could do more after his final election. What more could he do for Vadlimir Putin? Once President Trump declassifies all FISA application against Carter Page all 💩 will hit the fan. Many people will be taken down off fake dossier.

They want Russian collusion investigation to continue why not not let corruption investigation to continue? The only Russian collusion is between Hillary and Daniel Steele’s paid for by her fake dossier. There’s no national security reason not to release FISAC applications.

Hillary Clinton and her band of merry men have made a mockery of our justice system in America. Are we going to let them take over our congress and continue this mockery? We must show them we have the courage of our fore fathers and stop them. To do so keep congress under GOP.

If we are afraid to face this corruption and bring justice for us the American people doesn’t that make us cowards? I’m not a coward are you? What did blacks and Latinos have to lose voting for President Trump? Not a damn thing they came out winners.
James Comey the so called man of honor was director of FBI at this time. Many hands in this corruption soup and if Dems take over Congress in Nov we will never know the truth. Doesn’t Americans deserve to know the truth? Who does it hurt?
DOJ had perfect connection with GPS. Bruce Ohr of DOJ wife Nellie Ohr worked for GPS which wasn’t told to FISAC judges. The FISSAC judges were kept in the dark by Sally Yates another DOJ employee of who bought the Russian dossier and that it was not verified by FBI.
The Dems were aided by members of the DOJ and FBI to frame President Trump. This corruption is the brain child of Hillary’s campaign along with DNC. They bought and paid for fake dossier created by foreign agent Daniel Steele through GPS.
We must release the corruption in our Govt. The left have spent last 2 yrs trying to frame our President for a crime that if congress finishes its investigation into these crimes will expose the truth to America. Truth is the left is the guilty party for Russian collusion.
There is only 1 reason to stop you from voting and its death. You have a habit of not getting to polling station then get off your ass and request absentee ballot to vote. Fill it out vote and return on time to be counted. It’s urgent that GOP retain congress.

Obama knew what Russia was doing during election why didn’t he step in? Instead he told security to step down. Yeah go ahead and run your mouth we know you were a puppet for Soros not a president for the people. He’s why we must keep house to expose all his dirty secrets to all.
Thank you President Trump for working around the clock to save America. Obama was a lazy president unless it was to service his needs not America’s. President Trump doesn’t accept his paycheck he donates back, did Obama? President Trump got captives released from NoKo did Obama?
Both Hillary and Obama are guilty of high treason against the people of America. Obama tried his hardest to destroy Americans will but we were stronger then him. Obama our 1st Black president and our 1st racist president. His time in office couldn’t have ended quick enough.
Hillary Clinton was to win and keep his criminal activity buried. He knew about the dossier and all the connections to it. He emailed to a unsecure server being used by Hillary then lied about it. Hillary and him should be sharing same cell for same crimes.
Goes to show Obama ain’t no class act using a hero’s funeral to attack our President. Obama knows his dirty little secrets are about to be exposed for the world to see. If a president ever deserved impeachment it was Obama. He’s committed severeral high crimes.

Dems platform- Impeach 45- raise taxes- open all boarders- close ICE- kill jobs by returning to previous regulations. If you want to live off food stamps and depend on Govt while illegals live great lives then by all means vote Dem. if you prefer living the good life vote GOP.
President Trump gave us our voices back in 2016 so now in 2018 we need to use those voices for the good of our country. Don’t listen to the polls only one matters. If you love your country vote GOP.#KeepAmericaGreat🇺🇸
The Mueller investigation should immediately be stopped its tainted on all sides from Ohr keeping members in the loop with Daniel Steele. It’s time for President Trump to declassify all documents requested by congress no national security issue just Dems way of covering up crimes
The only collusion committed was between her, DNC and Daniel Steele with a phony dossier from the Russians. It was Hillary who paid millions for it from a foreign agent illegal by election laws. All involved need to be brought to justice and only then can we trust again.
It’s time to clean up the Democratic Party. President Trump was duly elected President at the choice of the American people. We chose him over Hillary. Hillary’s feelings got hurt and she treated President Trump like the women her husband screwed she’s out to destroy him.
It’s a must that GOP retain House in midterms. We must expose the corruption within our Govt. The corruption falls on the lap of the Dems and if they take House the corruption remains covered up. I don’t care if your a Dem if your against corruption in Govt then vote GOP.
@algore Thanks! I needed a good laugh and you gave it to me. So hard I peed myself a little. Telling President Trump to resign was so damn funny. Unlike you he wouldn’t tuck his tail and run he’s fighting for us. So just get in your private jet and fight climate control.#KAG!🇺🇸

James Comey has committed criminal acts yet he walks free. Peter Stryzok committed criminal acts yet he walks free. Your Asst AG committed crimes he walks free. Sally Yates committed crimes she walks free. Yet they want to charge our President with a crime he didn’t commit.
The proof of criminal acts being committed by FBI and DOJ are slapping you in the face but yet you do nothing. FISAC was lied to in order to obtain warrant 4 different times yet you do nothing. Hillary Clinton has committed criminal acts yet she walks free.
@USAGSessions What will it take for you to do your job for the American people? Crimes have been committed by left strong evidence but yet you do nothing. If you don’t take action by midterms can’t blame President Trump if he fires you. Enough is enough.
@CNN Do you know how we can tell your reporters are telling Americans lies? Very simple their lips are moving.#KeepOutFakeNewsKeepAmericaGreat
Many crimes have been committed by those in the left and if we let the Dems take our house those crimes will once again be buried. Get out and vote in person or absentee just vote for our children’s futures.#KeepAmericaGreat🇺🇸🇺🇸👍
It is vital for America that GOP retains power in both houses after midterms. We must keep our economy growing by leap and bounds. The investigations into the criminal acts within our Govt must continue and expose the guilty to their treasonous acts against our President.
She made no inquiring of how I got to UH or for what. I can’t walk for long distances without assistance due to my back condition. Due to high risk they chose not to do surgery at the present time. I will not use Pat for any advocacy don’t want to be her problem.
If it weren’t for Veterans she wouldn’thave her job. To referred to me as a problem hit me the wrong way. It wasn’t a problem for me to serve my country but an honor. If the people Pat helps are problems maybe she should consider a different job.
Called her to set up ride was told by her I was UH’s problem not the VA’s problem then she abruptly hung up on me.I was taken to UH by ambulance under doctors request not mine. Needed further evaluation of herniated discs. When did Vets become a problem?
@ClevelandVAMC Used to brag how good this Hospital was. Patient advocate Pat has changed my opinion when she referred to as a “problem” yesterday then hung up on me. Needed to get back to VA from UH was told it would happen when transferred there.
@EdWilli84362500 According to VA advocate Veterans are a problem to VA. I was put in UH via ambulance from Wade park when time to return was told I was UH’s problem not Wade Park. Is this how a patient advocate named Pat should treat a Vet?
I was assured before going to UH they would get me back to VA to go home. Fortunately our county VA driver had a heart and came picked me up. It just hits me wrong being called a problem. Serving my time wasn’t a problem it was an honor.#KeepAmericanGreat🇺🇸
@POTUS Today the VA disappointed me in Cleveland. I was admitted on the 21st transferred to UH for back surgery. Called today for ride back to VA was told I was UH’s problem not the VA’s by patient advocate. Are Vets a problem to VA? It’s a wrong way to treat a Veteran.
@SenSchumer Did you forget the Mark Rich pardon by Bill Clinton? Same charges as Manafort so why the threats from you if President Trump pardons him? Goes to show your bias to us.#KeepAmericaGreat🇺🇸🇺🇸

@LannyDavis How does it feel being a mouth peace for the Clinton cartel? Did you need to take courses to understand the justice system for the Clintons? They don’t have to follow the same laws as the average Americans. They receive special treatment under the upper tier.
Asst AG Rosenstein wrote the letter recommending Jim Comey being fired. Too many lies remained buried. Both will have conflicts of interest once all comes to surface. We must all stand by our President and not allow him to be impeached.#KeepHouseRed🇺🇸🇺🇸
The illegal that killed the college girl will be protected by the Dems. If Dems get house majority we will be in a world of hurt. Make sure you’re registered to vote. AG Sessions and his asst AG should both be fired for doing lousy jobs. They’re are keeping the truth his.
See MSM would rather cover Russian collusion then the college girl killed by illegal. Had it been an American with a gun they’d be on the roof shouting about it. I hope people wake up by Nov and see the left is not good for Americans. They don’t stand for us.
Been away for a day or so in hospital with bone fragments on back nerve. Things have been happening I see but I still stand strong with President Trump. Still no collusion being proved. Lanny Davis still kissing Clinton’s ass I see.
Hillary used a Gold Star family for her shameless use. They didn’t come cheap she paid them I believe $750,000 to attack President Trump which they failed at. You can not sway his supporters unlike the left’s we are real.#KeepAmericaGreat🇺🇸🇺🇸
Obama tried to destroy our integrity around the world with his divisive actions. Obama lacked the love for our country. He never once said I love America, President Trump proudly shouts it out, do you? Many gave their blood for America Obama was an embarrassment to their families

@JoshBosma @PreetBharara @billmaher First he has to find his balls, seems Mueller has neutered him.
Obama knew what and still does know what’s happening. He’s the ring leader of the Deep State. Their secrets were suppose to stay buried but Hillary lost. It’s time to put honesty back in our Govt. Let’s help President Trump do it.#FireSessions🇺🇸🇺🇸
Hillary Clinton’s case should be reopened after all it was a sham investigation by her friends at the FBI. Loretta Lynch should be charged for her part in this cover up by the Dems. Obama should be held accountable for his actions in it. If Sessions ever gets a set maybe.
Why isn’t Sessions stopping it? The FBI has lied, his asst AG has lied yet he sits with his thumb up his ass doing nothing. There’s people who deserve to put away but it’s not anyone on the Trump campaign team. Those who are doing this frame up should be brought to justice.
Is Sessions a Dem? He’s allowing them to use his office to run a witch hunt on our President. We’re not blind it’s the Dems who colluded with Russia not President Trump. It was Hillary who bought dossier on President Trump and tried to use it and frame him.
Can anyone tell me where AG Sessions is? Hope he’s getting a pair of balls installed. He’s seems to be lacking them. He’s allowing criminals to walk free and do as they please. He’s allowing them to make our country look like fools. He’s allowing our President to be attacked.

These idiots must not have ever read our constitution. It’s the President’s constitutional right to revoke and security clearances for any reason. They can not legally impede him from doing so. It’s not a right to have a security clearance but a privilege.

I’d love to see them put her away to where we never have to hear or see her again. America would be a better place without her. Who knew the devil was a female? Sorry for long tweet but as a Vet who has lost friends in conflicts Hillary just really pisses me off.#Vets4America🇺🇸
Now I can see how she was able to go home and sleep after allowing 4 dedicated Americans be murdered by terrorist in Benghazi.This person has no soul. Hillary was too busy getting her cover up for her failure ready. I pray they reopen investigation to her email server.
Had Bill served instead of dodging she’d think differently. If she barks like a dog and she does she must be a dog and we all know what a female dog is called. If anyone deserves to live a sad miserable life it has to be her. Hillary is a ungreatful bitch who was given so much.
We’ve all or most us know someone who gave their last drop of blood for this great country. If Hillary doesn’t respect our flag and the history behind then I always look at her like a pile of useless 💩💩. Hillary does not deserve to sit in our highest office ever.
It’s the day after I read about Hillary praising a 6 yr old for taking a knee in saying the pledge to our flag. Just as angry if not more. It was teachable moment Hillary failed out. She should have talked about what that flag stood for and those brave Americans who died for it.

They wanted to keep in campaign for president and didn’t want to be at her wrath if she did win. Even they knew how she seeks revenge for those who cross her. Now that he’s been fired his investigations should be reviewed.#Justice4All
Before even questioning Hillary Clinton he knew what end result was going to be, he had already decided to clear her. The facts though didn’t play out that way. Proof was plentiful she  handled classified docs carelessly and our national security in danger. A chargeable offense.

Peter Stryzok deserves to be fired for pulling off the biggest fraud on America with accusing President Trump of Russian collusion that doesn’t and has never existed. It’s was all done because Hillary lost and facts would be found to deeply hurt the left.

Let the truth surface. Watch the Dems drop like flies. Keep house in GOP control so we can see the truth about what the left has done. If they take House the truth stays buried and dishonesty wins, that’s not my America is it yours?#RedWave2018#KAG!🇺🇸🇺🇸
We will retain houses and bring the truth to the masses about the dirty tricks the left has pulled on us the American people. It’s not going to be a pretty picture so be prepared for the ugliness that exist on the left.#KeepingAmericanGreat🇺🇸RunAwayTurnRight
@MMFlint Back at it again I see. You think through one of your sucky movies you can change our feelings about our President. You can’t be more wrong what your trash movie does is make our support for him even stronger. We will protect him and our country from nut jobs like you.
We know the Dem’s playbook it’s to open our boarders to all who want to come. It’s their insurance policy for a voting base. Yes they’ve become that desperate they’ll let in a rapist for a vote. Dems have taken the low road.#KeepAmericaGreat#RedWave2018#Run2TheRight🇺🇸🇺🇸
To try to impeach President Trump will be like the 2016 elections in the end they will lose and have wasted countless tax $ in their failed attempt. We must not give them opportunity. We must stand strong and protect our President and our country. It’s no secret as Dems think.
Dems think talking about bread and butter issues at dinner table will give them the house at midterms. It will if you don’t mind having your taxes raised back up and jobs being killed. They will spend 1st wasting their time trying to impeach our President.
@benshapiro You’ve been accused of catcalling. Could you tell me how you call for a cat? I have many thoughts on how to call for my cat but my cat just doesn’t respond. Here kitty kitty doesn’t work. Good luck on your cat calling.#LMAO😂😂😂

@maddow Guess what I agree GOP has to retain congress to protect our President and our constitution. We need to bring all left’s lies to the sunlight. If Dems win house all their dirty secrets gets buried. It’s time to expose their secrets to America it’s the honest thing to do.

Dems take same oath as GOP to protect our constitution. Dems have failed Americans. They changed our justice system to a two tier system for those who have and have not. Hillary committed several felonies that can be proven, Dems let her walk away no charges.
We’ve had so many crimes committed by our FBI upper management and Obama’s DOJ. It needs to be brought out into the daylight. Dems don’t want that to happen why? So yes we need to work our asses off and keep houses in GOP hands.#KeepOurAmericaGreat🇺🇸Vets4America🇺🇸

Why would we want to relive the Obama yrs? He took away our tools to success. The only success you see under Dems is themselves. Look at Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Chuck Schumer all millionaires on a Govt salary are you? They have walls around their homes does America?#KAG!🇺🇸
If our country is doing good so are its citizens. Why don’t the Dems want us doing well? They want us under their thumb dependent on them for our daily lives. With President Trump were dependent on ourselves. He has given us the tools we need to succeed as an American.
The Dems want to reverse tax cuts that President Trump has given us. They want to impeach President Trump for being a successful President. Hard to believe but true ask Maxine Waters. President Trump has put on a path back to greatness why are Dems upset at it?
GOP voters can’t be complacent and sit at home on Election Day unless you voted absentee ballot. We can’t assume your vote not needed. Every vote is needed in this midterm. We must keep control of both houses to continue President Trump’s agenda. The Dems want to stop him.

You have called the supporters of President Trump some nasty names and have encouraged others to do the same. You’ve gone too far and no longer have the integrity the media used to have. Americans have tuned you out check your ratings. Flinstones reruns higher rating then CNN.
He’s a man of many words and has no problem speaking his mind. Media gave Obama a 8yr honeymoon President Trump was not even given 1 minute. Media started attacking on Nov 8, 2016 and haven’t stopped. So yes you’ve made yourselves the enemies of the people.
We can see what our President is doing for us in our paycheck. We see a President who is working for us not special interests, maybe that’s what pissing them off. He’s our President not theirs. He’s not for sale to anyone or any country. Media can’t handle his honesty.
Doesn’t the MSM realize how boorish they are. They keep attacking our President but people are confused on why. They see we have a vibrant economy and have good jobs available for 1st time in 8yrs. We know President Trump ending Obama era sancations made that possible.

Regardless of how well our economy is doing we still need to get to our polls and vote. We must get out and give our President a super majority to help get his agenda over the line. He has shown us we can be winners let’s keep winning with him.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018#RunTurnRight
You’ve forgot to mention how people receiving food stamps has gone down a million Americans. Instead all the media reports is false stories making our President look bad. You should stop it’s not working and we do consider you the people’s enemy you did it to yourselves.#KAG!🇺🇸
You don’t talk about how the tax cuts are helping the average American. You don’t mention how our unemployment is at its lowest level or that black and Hispanic unemployment is at its lowest levels ever. Not to mention unemployed women at its lowest on record.
@Acosta If the media is not America’s enemy then why aren’t they honest with us. The media fails to tell the good stuff happening in America due to President Trump’s actions. You don’t mention return of American soldiers from North Korea. You don’t report any positive stories.
Guess what left will be stunned again in midterms and then in 2020. President Trump made promises and has kept them. He’s not lied to America Hillary started off lying to us. We support our President and we will keep on winning.#KAG!🇺🇸#RunAwayTurnRightAndBeWinners🇺🇸
President Trump had every constitutional right as president to fire Comey no reason was needed. The left have done nothing but hinder our President doing the job we the people elected him to do. We knew who we were electing and chose him over Hillary and left is stunned.
The actions he took on immigration went against our constitution. The president doesn’t make new laws they come from our legislators. All President Trump has done is correct Obama’s mistakes. It was Hillary who instructed justice not President Trump. It was Comey that obstructed.
@TomSteyer Dems are doing the right thing not trying to impeach our President. He’s done nothing wrong to be impeached for. Obama should have been impeached for his crimes. He took an oath to protect our constitution he didn’t follow through with oath of office.

@HillaryClinton Any clue when that recession is going to hit? Maybe it was your math didn’t add up. From where I sit President Trump has done what Obama couldn’t do in 8yrs, give us a GDP of 4.1%. It barely had a heartbeat under Obama. Our economy didn’t take as we were told.

Your intentions were to destroy the America we call our country. You intended on Hillary to continue the destruction of America. You wanted us to be part of a Global society. We stopped you with the election of President Trump. He has worked his ass off rebuilding what you did.
These companies provided hundreds of jobs taking unemployment rates for Black and Hispanics to their lowest levels, something you couldn’t accomplish. He did it all without redistribution. He got millions off food stamps and on a payroll you couldn’t or wouldn’t.

With Dems they’ll shut down all investigations so the criminals deep within our country can continue their crimes against our country. When we get close to outing one ever notice how the Dems do what it takes to stop it?
If Dems win house what they will give us is higher taxes, impeachment hearings for President Trump. We will have open boarders allowing anyone to enter our country without being challenged to be the kind of person we want in our society. They’ll give us the same false promises.
We want the super majority so the Dems can’t interfere with the rebuilding process. It will give us the opportunity to fill the rest of President Trump’s cabinet and justices without any resistance from Dems that could stop it. President Trump has been held back by Dems.
On Nov 6th we need a “super red wave” at the end of the day. Regardless if it’s a rhino or a establishment candidate just hold your nose and vote red. We must keep houses to allow President Trump the opportunity to finish rebuilding America. We need a super majority.

If you can’t get to the polls to cast your vote then request absentee ballot to cast your vote and make sure to mail it back in time or drop off. Just be sure to vote. It’s a must that we keep both houses to finish President Trump’s agenda for America. A super majority would help

Your support of sanctuary cities have cost you votes. We don’t want criminals protected from our laws illegal or not. If you killed someone would you be protected from prosecution? Illegals are. Judges send them out side doors to avoid ICE.#KAG!🇺🇸#TurnRight
The Dems want open boarders inviting evil in. Dems are more concerned with illegals then American citizens. Don’t say we’re wrong it’s a fact. Maybe if you worked for us and not illegals you’d still have support of Americans. Your support of illegals cost you support.
@NancyPelosi 9/11 just an incident? It was an attack on America. It’s no wonder Dems are not in control with people like you leading them. You say stupid things and your way out of touch with Americans. We love our country and want it protected from evil.

They are so desperate to regain the power to once again destroy our America. Hillary was their chance to finish what Obama started. We stopped her and now the left has lost all morals. They didn’t take the high road they claimed they went lower then a snake crawls.
The left can’t handle Americans not being beholding to them for survival. They need new voters for them so open our boarders and let them in. The Dems don’t care about our children it’s all about power kind of like Hitler. Without power they feel empty inside.
Libs want Mueller’s investigation to go until finished. The only way this can happen is to keep house under GOP control. Dems will stop all hearings and start impeachment hearings. President Trump has done nothing to be impeached. Only if improving Americans lives is a reason.

Hillary was to win our White House and continue the destruction of America that Obama had started. It’s time to expose them and the person who they took their instructions from in disrupting our election. Wasn’t any Russian collusion it was an Obama collusion.
Obama should be included in those to have clearances revoked. It was under his administration and more then likely his instructions not to let candidate Trump win. These people are dangerous to our political system. They tried to rig our election to favor Hillary Clinton.
Anyone involved with unverified Russia dossier being used to obtain FISAC warrant on Carter Page should have their security clearances revoked. They’ve lost the trust of Americans. They tried to steal an election from us in the dirtiest way. Their lies failed them.
@USAGSessions Where are you AG Sessions? Why haven’t you filed charges yet? The proof is out false statements were made to obtain a FISAC warrant. Their about five people who should be facing perjury charges including your asst AG.#JusticeNow🇺🇸

@RepAdamSchiff Are you brain dead? They used a unverified document to get warrant to spy on Carter Page plain and simple. It’s time for the FISAC to charge those applied for it with perjury using false information to obtain warrant. No way around it they lied to judges.

America is very fortunate to have President Trump and could you imagine how much more he could do for us if everyone got over TDS and accepted him. He’s not going anywhere and the more the libs act out like you the stronger his support gets. You make him look like the grownup.
You can’t win an election from your bed. You can’t win an election calling Americans names. You can’t win elections by lying to Americans. We didn’t owe Hillary the job nor did she exhibit the qualities we want for President, President Trump was our choice.
If Obama was president when Russia started to meddle in 2014 why didn’t he take any steps to stop them? Why did Obama tell everyone to step down and do nothing about Russia meddling? Those are facts Whoopi and answers? President Trump won and the libs thought Hillary would.
People are taking home more of their paycheck. What he’s done on the boarder isn’t anything that Obama didn’t do, so why do you attack Trump but not a word when Obama took the same actions? Obama was president when Russia started to meddle.

We must let our voices be heard on Nov 6th.  To keep America our country you need to vote Red, if you’re willing to give up our American Dream then vote Blue. Once our constitution is ripped up we’re in chaos. We’ve shed too much blood to let our America go without a fight.
The Dems aren’t going to happy until they’ve taken away our constitution. They want open boarders and want to take away our rights to be a sovereign country. We are in the fight to be America. We must not allow the Dems to take our country from us. Time is now to take a stand.

@WhoopiGoldberg If Judge Jeanine said you suffer Trump Sydrome she’s right on the $! Obama did same thing to kids on the boarder not word from libs. Russia interfered under Obama not word from libs. Now under President Trump it’s treason but it wasn’t under Obama?
@greggutfeld Ray Liotta build it the will come.
Did President Trump receive millions from Russians for his elected? It was reported by President Putin that Hillary received $400mil during her campaign from Russians why isn’t she being investigated? Obama knew of Russia meddling he did nothing why isn’t he being investigated?
President Trump has done was Dems have said couldn’t be done. He’s flustered the Dems, they’ve tried to frame him for a crime that Hillary and Obama committed. If any Russian collusion it was between 2 Dems and Russia.
The Dems actions have shown their priorities are getting illegals the rights to vote over improving the lives of Americans. The Dems have forgot who they were elected to serve. President Trump was elected to serve the people and he has done just that served the American people.
Before and resolution by the Dems they need to turn over any proof they have. The Dems are all talk but refuse to prove their facts. What the Dems are doing is hurting themselves and making a Red Wave a probability on Nov 6th. The Dems work for illegals over Americans.
Before we blame Russia for interfering with our elections don’t we need proof? So far they’ve shown me none. How do we know it’s not China? DNC refused to turn over computers to prove it why? Dems want election security very simple require picture ID, very inexpensive for us.
We need to protect our children and open boarders does not protect them. It’s time to stop the flow of drugs into America through Mexico.#KAG!🇺🇸
Dems want ICE abolished which goes to prove their desire to have open boarders and allow every Tom, Dick, and Harry in regardless if they desire to harm us or not. That’s not my America is it yours? Too much blood has been shed to just give our country away.

Hillary didn’t send any classified docs through her unprotected private server. Her private server alone was not permitted to be used for any Govt business. Obama emailed her on it and had FBI cover it up. They text in unfriendly areas not permitted by Govt rules.
Obama wants to insinuate that President Trump tells lies and double downs on them. Talk about the perfect example of a hypocrite. Obama’s spent 8yrs of lying to us. Hillary lied through her teeth and then lied to cover up her lies. Remember Obama said you could keep your doctor.
They should never attack our President while he’s on foreign soil that’s just not right. I guess us hillbillies just have more class the those who resist on the left. I’ll take being a Trump hillbilly any day over being a Schumer 🤡 clown.
Just the fact Obama would step on foreign soil and condemn the actions of America was treason. You allowed him to apologize to our enemies for our American greatness. We should be proud of our country on foreign soil not ashamed.
They won’t let us know what was said between Clinton and Loretta Lynch on her airplane. You can’t have it both ways. It’s a shame all these people are publicly attacking our President. Had we reacted to Obama’s actions this way they’d be throwing a hissy fit.
They want to know what was said in meeting between Putin and President Trump well we want to know what was in FISA application for warrant to spy on Carter Page. There is this thing called executive privilege. Obama didn’t share his Iran deal with us did he?
Obama was president at time the Russians are accused of meddling in election. Why didn’t he do anything to stop Russia? Was he counting on Russian dossier on candidate Trump to win the election for Hillary? Is that the FBI’s insurance policy to stop him from winning?
Can anyone tell me why no one is questioning why the Dems wouldn’t turn servers over to prove that Russia has hacked them. Everyone so sure Russia meddle in election but yet offer no proof. Anyone care to step in and prove Russia interfered? Why isn’t Obama actions questioned?

They didn’t count on us hillbillies to be smart enough to know the difference between B💩 and honesty, after all they thought we fell for Hillary’s. They thought wrong and the best person won. Hence we now have the Russian collusion 💩 happening. Thank you Obama!
They bought and paid for a insurance policy that would be delivered by a Republican. It’s the Russian dossier that they made sure John MCCain would get they knew he run to the FBI like a screaming bitch and we’d all believe him on what was in it about candidate Trump.
Obama knew Russia was meddling in our election in 2014 he told the intelligent agencies to stand down and do nothing. That’s not treason to allow Russia free reign to interfere! I guess it could be they were so sure Hillary was going to win they had a sure proof way.

The MSM has used its tools to degrade our President but they’ve only hurt themselves. Yesterday’s big question to Putin, “Do you have any dirt on President Trump?” What a dumb ass question and goes to show the level of the MSM is on.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018#WalkawayturnRight🇺🇸🇺🇸
President Trump has met roadblocks thrown at him from the resisters#Dems head on without blinking. The Dems have attempted to frame President Trump for a made up crime. Where is the proof Russia interfered as claimed? A lot of chatter but not too many facts to back it up.
We have to remember we elected a man who is not a politician so no he’s not going to act like one. We got what we elected a man who loves his country and wants the best for Americans. He made promises and unlike a politician he kept them to his supporters.
When did Russian collusion complaint begin? The day after Hillary lost the election. If Dems were so sure Russia was involved during the election then why didn’t they speak up until after election? Obama apparently didn’t think so he told FBI and CIA to stand down. Any clues why?
Then when President Trump won all of a sudden it becomes Russia’s fault and President Trump planned it with them for him to win. I voted for him and was not influenced or instructed by any Russian to do so. Dems creates this crisis!#Fakecharges
Was that the insurance policy in case lost to frame President Trump for a crime that Obama committed? If Obama did nothing on purpose then he’s the criminal not President Trump. After all didn’t Obama say Russia couldn’t interfere with election and Trump needs to crying about it?
@SenSchumer In 2012 during Obama’s debate with Romney Russia wasn’t a enemy to America. Hillary referred to them as allies. What happened in 2016 that they became enemies?  Can you explain? Why did Obama tell FBI to stand down when it was thought Russia was interfering?

If Stryzok could smell a Trump supporter I wonder what a Clinton supporter smelled like? If I know Hillary they’d smell like money or a Russian. I’ll proudly be a Trump hillbilly from the Midwest. I can imagine people who could smell Stryzok were smelling 💩💩.
They let this agent lie about the facts and covered for him. There was bias in his investigations. If not Hillary would have been charged and any honest person knows that. Had anyone else did what she had we’d be locked up by now. Hillary received special treatment by FBI.
The FBI has not done itself any favors in getting the trust of America back. They’ve refused to answer questions during testimony by former agent Stryzok that would have gone far in regaining that trust. Instead they’ve done the opposite. They should have done more.
@DNC You claim your servers were hacked by Russia. Prove it! For some odd reason you wouldn’t turn them over to FBI to be checked. Was the $400mil that Hillary received from Russians for her campaign on those servers? Until you turn over servers to prove your claim#STFU!

Hillary thought wrong. Along came Donald Trump who campaigned circles around her. While she slept off a drunk he was out campaigning for our votes. He was honest she had to play all her cards but failed. She become desperate and started name calling like we would take it.
They have many secrets they want to keep buried. They wanted us to become globalist no longer our own country. Obama started it Hillary was to finish it. It didn’t work out that way for them. Hillary was weak candidate who thought we would hand her the Oval Office.
Being disgraceful was when Obama went to other countries and apologized for America greatness. How quickly we forget. The way the intelligence community worked against President Trump why would he trust them? They were in the bag for Hillary winning. She would keep their secrets.

@HillaryClinton Funny you didn’t mind children being separated from parents at the boarder when Obama was president. What’s up with change? You say with President Trump’s SC pick we’d be going back to the time of slavery. That’s something you should be familiar with.
The left has become a group of scum bag liars and you can’t get much lower. You’ve become a group that spews hate for Americans. If we don’t agree with your ways we’re racist homophobes. Actually we’re here for Dems who choose to #walk away.#walkawayturnright🇺🇸🇺🇸
The left has been pulling a fast one since Hillary had her ass handed to her by President Trump. The left has went off its moral compass and has yet to find their way back. Until you do you’ll continue to lose. Americans respect honesty over deceit every day.
@NancyPelosi What has you all worked about releasing the Carter Page FISA Warrant? Are you afraid the American people will learn the truth and discover the left’s been lying to them? Just pull the band aid off and get it over. We are going to find out sooner or later.
@mitchellreports Please goddess of fake news tell us on what charges will President Trump be arrested on? You seem to know it all. Would you know honest news if it were right in front of you? Don’t you think you need all your facts before reporting?#fakenewswhore
@POTUS Declassify Carter Page FISA Warrant application and order it to be released to Congressional Over Sight Committee. No national security would be at risk only the truth. What are investigators hiding from us?#KAG!🇺🇸releaseapplication
Russia’s interference started under Obama so why aren’t they questioning Obama on what he knew about it and what steps did he take to stop Russia. Why did he tell FBI and CIA to stand down?#Keepingithonest
@chucktodd Why do all you left wingers spewing false news forget Obama’s hot mic moment. The one where he sent message to Putin he could assist him more after he’s re-elected. Why are those moments forgot? What was that message about? What help was Obama offering to Putin?
@CrazyCatRescuer She’s a treat to watch her run from one window to the next looking out. She seems content being inside doesn’t show any desire to go outside. Loves having her belly rubs rolls over for it in my lap. When I go to bed she climbs in beside me and curls up.

Hillary or her aides sent classified docs from this server once again a illegal act. Not one was done by accident all on purpose. With all this evidence against her she was not charged. If that ain’t bias what is?#unfairjustice
How can the IG said there isn’t any proof Peter Strzok didn’t show any bias in his investigations of Hillary. She did use a unprotected private server which was not permitted. Classified docs were sent to it which is illegal. Obama emailed her at this unprotected server illegal.

If the did investigate Obama for Russia collusion where would it take them? By Obama’s hot mic moment we know he wanted to give a helping hand to Putin after he was re-elected. Just goes to show they’d frame a ham sandwich if they needed to!#Justice4America🇺🇸🇺🇸
Since President Trump has been elected they’ve tried to blame him for the Russian interference yet Obama was the president that allowed it to happen. If anyone should be investigated for Russian collusion it should be Obama. Makes more sense to me. Wonder how quick it’d end?
Why didn’t Obama take any action during this time period? Was he so sure Hillary would win and didn’t want to upset the Apple cart? If he had stepped in would he have exposed things he didn’t want Americans to know about his dealings with Putin? So many questions left unanswered.
Who was president when Russia started to interfere with 2016 election? It was Obama why didn’t he step in and take action against Russia? Why does he get a free pass? He told his administration to stand down and do nothing. It becomes President Trump’s fault?
Today he’s earned the award of being a man with many faces. Today he could have been nominated for a Emmy but not a Purple Heart. The man cheats on his wife and you want to honor him? Would your wife honor you for banging a coworker?#Resign2Day#Vets4Justice🇺🇸🇺🇸

I wouldn’t trust a word out of his mouth. To say we took his texts wrong is far fetched. They could only be taken one way he doesn’t like President Trump without a doubt. Can’t believe the Dems acted like he was a wounded animal. To say he do it out of anger of gold star family.
Don’t know how anyone else felt but I wanted to reach through my tv and wipe that smirk of Strzok’s face. That smirk told Americans all they needed to know about that lying weasel. He may have thought he was pulling a fast one on us but far from it.
Now MSNBC and CNN worked hard to get Hillary elected but just didn’t go their way did it and now the Dems blame the Russians.
Instead Obama ordered everyone to step down and do nothing. Can you tell us why? President Trump got President Trump elected. He worked circles around Hillary who needed to rest for some reason. Fox News covered what was really going on during the election.
@RepGutierrez When did you start working for MSNBC and CNN? Today you definitely sounded like a talking piece for them. Peter Stryzok made a ass of the FBI. Maybe Obama should have stepped in as president and stop the Russian interference.

The Russian collusion charges should be even more clear to everyone today that they were false. You said you’d stop Trump from being President and this was carrying out your promise to FBI lover Lisa Page. The way you talked so nasty about Trump you were a dirty player.
He could smell a Trump supporter just how did we smell? I would assume like either a Big Mac or KFC. How did a Clinton supporter smell? I assume like 💩💩 since they were nasty. You were impeaching President Trump even before your investigation for your made up charges began.
Peter Stryzok said his actions showed no bias against President Trump? What fairytale does he live in? There’s not one text he sent to his FBI lover Lisa Page that was bias free about candidate Trump. He said he would stop him from becoming president. Big talk for a short man.
Things getting hot in hearing! Peter Stryzok between rock and hard place! Dems trying to pull fast one and it’s getting really warm!
The Dems lost the 2016 election and with their current actions they’ll lose the 2020 presidential election too. Who will you blame for that loss? Will it be Russia again? It can’t be the fact the Dems have no message could it?#KeepAmericaGreat🇺🇸
Elijah Cummings met with Russian citizens must be colluding. That’s the basis they are using. One of those arrested was for a 2005 tax case not anything connected to Russian collusion. The Dems don’t find that to be a problem? It’s our tax $ at work. I could better spend it.
Mueller has gotten 5 guilty pleas but how many were for Russian collusion? Not one. It was a ploy by Mueller to get people to roll over on President Trump which they’ve failed to do. Can’t be done when the crime hasn’t been committed. What if they tried to frame you?
@RepCummings The FISA warrants involved statements from Peter Stryzok didn’t they. They were investigating his bias against President Trump so no that was not interference with Mueller. The FISA warrant proves how dishonest Stryzok was.

President Trump has improved the lives of Americans in ways Obama could only dream of. President Trump is not a puppet having his strings pulled like Obama. Now Maxine Waters puppeteer is George Soros Incase you didn’t know. George pulls many strings in the swamp.
The funny thing is had President Trump been working with Putin before election would it be smart to attack the Russian’s action now? Instead of criticizing our President while he’s out of country you should show support. My bad your a resister of good things he’s done.
America pays above it’s fair share to NATO. He was right to point out Germany’s dependence on Russian energy sources. If they piss Putin off he closes the tap and where does that leave them? They are under his thumb and must back him up or be cut off. It’s happened to others.
@NancyPelosi President Trump said all the right things at NATO today. Unlike Obama would have done he put Americans first. He’s right to point out others countries are not paying their fair share of the bill. Why should America be the ones to pay to protect the world.

That seems to be what the left is running on now a days. Hate will not win any elections. Resistance will not win you any elections. You have no message that shows how you can make our lives better. President Trump did and he’s kept his word to make life better in America.
Yes he talked others to get their input but would we expect He wouldn’t? The groups he talked to in the legal field were respectable and not on the extreme right. The left’s true colors are showing and their quite ugly to Americans. Such ugly words spouting hate.
@SenBillNelson How can you say such a blatant lie about President Trump’s SCOTUS nominee. Only someone on the extreme left would utter such baseless charges. President Trump was not influenced by outside sources of his choice of justice nominee.

The left wants it’s opponents treated with violent outbursts. Maxine Waters has publicly encouraged the left to demoralize Trump supporters in public by drawing crowds to intimidate them. Maxine Waters is their leader.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018🇺🇸
Unlike Maxine Waters the right encourages debates in the proper place. Unlike the left the rght will let you pump your gas in peace or eat your meal without interference. There is a time and place for civil disturbance. The left encourages violence the right doesn’t.
Why is it people on the left can go out and eat in peace, sleep through the night not being woken up by protesters outside their home. It’s because the right doesn’t operate like the left and disrespect your right to enjoy a peaceful meal in public. The right respects your home.
The left has tried to silence people who think differently then them. If you don’t think like a Dem your a racist or bigot. They’ve turned to name calling if you disagree with them. I’m an American and allowed to have my own thoughts!#KAG!#RedWave2018#Trump2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
Where has their resistance got them? They’ve done themselves no favors in the eyes of Americans. They come through as being the party of violence not tolerance. They’ve encouraged disrespect not respect, they’ve encouraged people to be rude not use common sense.
The Dems will use every scare tactic they can just like they did during campaign. Not one scare tactic Schumer and his colleagues said has come true. Our economy didn’t collapse nor our stock market crash. President Trump has improved our economy. The Dems have resisted him.
Why does crying Schumer keep lying to us? Give it up Chuckles we’re not going to be convinced. President Trump never promised to end Roe vs Wade when he campaigned. Just because he said he’s now pro life doesn’t Schumer wants to put words in his mouth that weren’t said.
Once you’ve lost our trust it’s all downhill and that’s what it’s been for this investigation. They’ve wasted millions of our tax $ on what? They’ve had over a yr and still have not even come close to proving any Russian collusion with President Trump.#endwitchhunt🇺🇸
Peter Stryzok one of Mueller’s team member told his FBI lover Page Trump wouldn’t be President. Just how did he know that. They had an insurance policy just what was it? They removed Strzok from team but too late damage has been done to Americans trust.
How can they say there’s no bias in the Russian collusion case with a straight face? All the investigators involved are Democratic donors not 1 GOP donor. There’s nothing fishy about that is there? Some worked for Hillary one way or another nothing strange there.
Obama had a 1% GDP President Trump is set to a 4% GDP so where are the Dems telling Americans the true facts. Dems are walking away from their party why? Maybe their tired of dishonesty.#KAG!🇺🇸#WalkawayturnRedthepsrtyofhonesty🇺🇸
I just urge all to remember what the left claimed would happen if President Trump was elected. Our country would suffer for it, our stock market would crash, our economy would die. Which of these has happened? Just the opposite has happened to America. Records set!

They have cost millions to investigate a fake crime. No charges handed out connected to Russian collusion. It’s time to hand over all docs requested and let the chips fall where they may. Regardless of Party the guilty ones should be exposed.#Justice4America🇺🇸

Dems continue to throw roadblocks in the path of GOP but Americans are seeing through the misdeeds of the Dems. If justice prevails Dems will pay in the end. Dems created Russian collusion but Americans are paying the cost of a false story told by Dems.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018🇺🇸
He did nothing because he thought the election was going to have a different ending. They assumed Hillary would win and their secrets would remain hidden from us. It didn’t happen and all 💩💩 hit the fan for the Dems. Too many lies have been told by Dems.
Once election is over and the Dem’s candidate lost it became President Trump’s fault the Russians interfered. No blame belongs to the president who allowed it to happen? Obama sat by and did nothing. Why did he tell FBI to stand down and do nothing? Sound right to you?
They want President Trump to confront Putin about election interference. That’s all fine and good. When will they confront Obama about allowing it to happen? He was the president at the time and knew it was going on. What did he do he turned a blind eye on it and remained silent.

Our constitution covers Americans and those who come to America legally. To come illegally you’re committing a crime. Commit a crime in Mexico they lock you up why shouldn’t we? Don’t want to be separated from kids then stay where you are.
People are leaving California to live out their American Dream it can’t be found in California any longer. If you want to live in filth and waste California is where you go. The illegals will drain your wallets and then what? How can think what your doing is right?
Why don’t Americans come 1st to you? If you look around the majority of America is thriving why isn’t California? Maybe if they chose Americans over illegals to spend their tax $ on. Instead they want to be a sanctuary state and we see how well that’s working out.
@NancyPelosi Looks like tourism is way down in the city you represent. Couldn’t be the human waste on your sidewalks could it? Maybe it’s the tents blocking the sidewalks. Then again it could that the homeless kids and Vets are a turn off. Yet your more concerned with illegals.
If we were electing a President this election I would want them to wait until new President elected. As Obama told Sen MCCain elections have consequences and President Trump won. Dems don’t like it when tables are turned.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018
@Richardafowler Obama also separated parents and children at boarder. Where were all the concerns then? Funny it’s ok when a Dem does it but completely cruel when done by GOP. Harry Reid came up with nuclear option when in Senate. Again fair for Dems but not GOP?

Russian collusion is a crime trumped up by the Dems to frame our President. Benghazi was real 4 Americans were killed. So yes Jessica there is a big difference between Benghazi and the Russian collusion investigation.#KAG!🇺🇸GOP2018
Obama and Clinton went home and to bed the night these 4 Americans gave their lives. They carried on the next day as if nothing happened not accepting any blame. Yes this deserved to be investigated for the time it took Benghazi was real Russian collusion is a false tale.
@JessicaTarlov How many Americans killed in Russian collusion? How many Americans killed in Benghazi? 4. Who gave stand down order when investing Russia election interference? Obama. Who gave stand down order in Benghazi where 4 Americans were killed? No one accepts blame.

We must not let them tie this up on the senate floor. All GOP Senators should accept President Trump’s nomination if he or she fits the criteria of a fit justice. We do want a fair justice on our court.#KAG!🇺🇸#GOP2018🇺🇸
We need our voter rosters cleaned up and only legal living Americans on them. Having voter ID requirement would assure everyone our elections are fair for all. The Dems will try any stop any selection President Trump gives to senate for nomination to Supreme Court.
Maybe with new justice on SC they can revisit voter ID laws and unloading dead people from voting rosters. The Dems want to spread the fear of Roe vs Wade going away but just don’t see that’s the biggest case to worry about. I’d rather see Voter ID the law of all 50 states.
We had to see too many of our youth die from over doses. It’s morally wrong not to do what ever it takes to stop another one from happening. It starts where the drugs come in our boarders. Still want ICE abolished?#KAG!🇺🇸supportICE
Now that the drug lords have free reign in Mexico our eyes on the boarder need to be even stronger to keep the dangerous drugs out. All parent no matter your political party should want this for your’s or other kids safety. Do you want to attend the funeral of a child?
Don’t we already lose too many young people to drug over doses? If you’re a parent is that what you want for your child? With Mexico electing a far left liberal president that puts us in even more danger. He has stated he will not use military against drug lords.
The libs want open boarders which would put us all in danger. We need ICE to protect our boarders. Don’t want ICE then build a wall no one can get over or under. We want our boarders protected from unwanted characters whose intent on harming us or providing drugs to our kids.
To abolish ICE would put our country in danger. They help keeping drugs from coming across our boarders. ICE keeps terrorist from entering our country at the boarder. ICE keeps illegals from entering America which is what is really pissing the left off.

Do these protesters want to be responsible for allowing a child be brought here and sold for someone sexual gratification? That’s what’s happening with some of these kids males and females. It’s not always as it looks. Do they want MS-13 in America? It’s time to protect boarders.
Parents who are sending their young daughters on their own to try and get to America send them with birth control pills out of fear they’ll be raped along the way. Traffickers are trying to bring kids across boarder by claiming to be their parents.
0 tolerance at the boarder didn’t start with President Trump’s administration. Where were these protesters when Obama caged the kids up? They’ve used pics from the Obama administration and blamed them on President Trump. These protesters don’t have a clue to the problems.
It’s time for the right to take a stand and let them know we’re not sitting back and taking it anymore. The employees of these places received a tax cut like all of us and not by the left. The left had nothing to do with tax cut not even by 1 vote.#MAGA🇺🇸#KAG!🇺🇸GOP2018
Anyone who has benefited from the tax cuts that President Trump and the GOP has given you should avoid any establishment not willing to serve MAGA supporters. It’s time to teach them a lesson of tolerance. Once their profits  hit low marks they’ll realize and change their way.
You can vote for the party who wants to impeach the best leader we’ve had in decades. You can elect the party that supports our leader and trust him. It’s up to Americans we can keep winning or turn the clock back to the Obama era it’s up to all of us.#KAG!🇺🇸#RedWave2018🇺🇸
You can vote for a party that wants your tax break to continue and keep jobs coming to America. You can elect a party that believes civil disobedience is the answer to all. You can elect the party that teaches tolerance even toward the Dems.
In Nov we have a choice who to elect. We can choose a party that treats illegal immigrants better then the citizens of America. We can also vote for a party that puts Americans above all others 1st. We can elect a party that wants your taxes raised to support the illegals.

Your entire staff is made up of partial investigators. Everyone has a Clinton connection and you think we’re stupid? This was all a attempt to take out the man Americans chose over Hillary Clinton not for any real crime. What Hillary did was a crime against our country.
How many more millions does he plan to drain from the American people to investigate this non existent  crime. This frame up is proving to be costly for us and frankly Mr. Mueller we’re tired of it. You’ve had long enough time to shut down shop and quit playing us.
Why is it Mueller has ignored the request of Russians mentioned in Russian Dossier to be put under oath and questioned? Doesn’t he want to find the truth as quickly as possible or does he have a dollar figure he needs to reach before closing investigation?

People are discovering they can make a good life without your freebies. President Trump has created jobs Obama only wished he could have. Had Hillary been elected we wouldn’t be where we are today, we’d still be hurting for jobs and good economy.#KAG!🇺🇸GOP2018
It’s like the claim when President Trump was elected our stock market would crash but just the opposite happened. Our economy was going to bottom out but just the opposite happened. President Trump has been successful and that’s a threat to the Dems future.
@SenSchumer Keep on resisting. Not putting a good look on the Dems. GOP only needs simple majority to approve new justice. You use false threats to scare Americans. What will you do when none of your claims come true and you’re shown to have lied? It’s a Clinton trait right?
Whoopi Goldberg worried about not being able to get a abortion if conservative justice selected. What’s she worried about? First you have to be able to conceive and I just don’t see that in her future without a miracle happening to her.#LMAO😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone needs to tell clown Schumer the only reason a new justice wasn’t appointed was because we were electing a new president. This election will not change who our president is. That was the only reason selection was held off.#KAG!🇺🇸#GOP2018RedWave🇺🇸🇺🇸🙏🏽

Maxine Waters has used her job in congress to create wealth for her and her family. Why her district elects her confuses me, it’s a district she doesn’t even live in. Just what has she done for this district but embarrass it? It’s time to retire her for better.#KAG!#GOP2018🇺🇸
It seems she is now the face of the Dems and what a ugly face it is! There’s a place hell for her we know God won’t let that hate in. God will judge her for her evil thoughts and deeds she’s projects. The wind bag is the definition of a full fledge racist.
Anyone who sees Maxine Waters out in public that disagrees with her stand against President Trump gather your friends and confront her right there demanding she resign from congress. It’s time we fight back and take a stand. If it’s ok for her then it should be for us.
What’s wrong with ICE being the President’s personal police service? After all the United States Marines are the President personal military branch. Check your history. ICE should not be abolished or defunded. ICE protects all Americans just like the Marines do also.#KAG!🇺🇸

@TheJuanWilliams Just for your info I didn’t sell my soul to Trump it’s not for sale. I voted for him because he wouldn’t sell his soul to be President Hillary would. He made promises to America not outside interest like Hillary. So now you know my soul can’t be bought.#KAG!🇺🇸

Why can you have a wall and we can’t? Isn’t America precious enough to protect from unwanted intruders? Would you like MS-13 members on your property? We don’t either. So if that makes us scumbags so be it.#KAG!#RedWave2018#Trump/Pence2020🇺🇸#❤️ourPOTUS🇺🇸🇺🇸👍
You’ve gotten wealthy off of Americans you could support yourself without another paycheck. You have a nice home to go to you remember it’s the one with the nice wall built around it to protect it from unwanted intruders. Just like the one Americans want around our country.
Is there any way of getting Maxine committed for a few days for mental help? Maybe she’s wearing her wig too tight. Maxine has such anger in her and do we want that person making decisions for our country? Maxine do the right thing for America resign.
We never called Obama supporters scumbags like Maxine has called us. When they refer to her as gentle lady of California I bet there’s a lot of snickering happening. She ain’t no lady for sure and not a damn thing gentle about her mouth. It’s like fingernails on a chalkboard.
Maxine Waters complains WH staff is too white. Wasn’t Obama’s WH staff mainly black people? Did we say WH was too black? I don’t remember ever hearing that. We would have know she’d be screaming we’re all racist. His advisors were black.

It’s time the left gets the tables turned on them. The right has quietly sat back but maybe it’s time to repay the left’s kind acts. They dish it out now let’s see if they can take it as well. The right never acted out like the left has during Obama’s term.
Maybe it’s time to give Maxine Waters a dose of her own medicine. Any GOP supporter see her in a public place call out your friends and confront her. Tell her she’s not welcomed in the area. Enough is enough from this crazy person, can’t call her a woman I’m not sure.

The right didn’t agree with a lot that Obama did but we never reacted the way the left is. Don’t recall anyone being asked to leave any restaurant or any of his cabinet attacked in public. We didn’t threaten his kids. That’s the difference between left and right.
@TomArnold You’re going to like a fool when it comes out you don’t have 💩💩 on President Trump. Then again you’ve looked like a fool your entire life so we won’t know the difference!

Hope you all realize your hypocrisy is turning off Americans. Your resistance is only making President Trump and his supporters even stronger for midterms. People are seeing how the Dems are unwilling to compromise on any immigration deal. Your the bullies in our eyes.
@WhipHoyer Where were the Dems when Obama was separating children from parents on the boarder in 2014? He was keeping them in steel cages. The proof is in the pictures they tried to pin on President Trump but were caught. Why didn’t Dems speak up then? Kids sleeping on floors.
The Dems have had the chance to work with the right to write fair legislation but walked away they prefer amnesty over coming to America the right way. That would be unfair to those who have come to our country by legal means. Time to shut down Dem’s game before more are killed.
If your response to above questions is yes then in Nov we must give President Trump a GOP super majority. Dems do not want to close our boarders they prefer letting anyone in America. They will put Americans in danger and not give a damn about us. They don’t stand for Americans.
Do you want a fair immigration bill? Do you want security at our boarders? Do you want to stop the drugs from flowing across the boarder and killing our kids? Do you want to keep MS-13 out of America? Do you want to keep low wages from hurting American workers?
Your bashing President Trump for doing the same exact thing Obama did when he was in the same position. Maybe instead of being hypocrites the left should get with the right and iron out a fair immigration bill. Sounds good to me how about you?#KAG!GOP2018🇺🇸
@SenatorBaldwin Why didn’t those on the left utter one word when Obama separating children from parents at the boarder? What is the  difference now other then the President? Do you think we don’t see the difference in how this situation is being treated by the left?
@JohnCooper0610 @aseeger3 We take better care of illegals then our own thanks to the Dems. It’s time for us to change that. Put Americans 1st it’s not being greedy it’s doing what’s right.#KAG!🇺🇸🇺🇸

Let’s face the facts Dems don’t want a solution to immigration problem. They want to exploit the children to gain votes at midterms. The Dems have nothing positive in their party to run on. Everything they said couldn’t be done President Trump has proved it could be.
When has Obama’s family been threatened like they have President Trump’s? Madonna wants to burn down WH with them in it, Peter Fonda wants Barron put in a cage of pedophiles. That’s acceptable to the left? What the left suffers from is Trump Syndrome. It’ll last for about 8yrs.
When did the Tea Party heckle someone out of a restaurant? I can tell you never. The left has become so desperate they’ve turned to hate. President Trump was elected and the left has not moved on. They don’t want to see America succeed. They’re are going way over the line.

This all could have been done through legislation but Dems have refused to come to table and compromise. Dems want open boarders which if that happens we don’t have a country. Dems want wages higher bring in illegal immigrants and wages will be lower.
The President has done a executive order to keep parents and children together while parents are being processed. The left said the President needed to use his pen, he did and guess what the left still not satisfied! The Dems are not without blame in this matter.
@RepSwalwell We are the United States Of America not United States Of Mexico. We accept immigrants but you must enter our country the way our laws say you need to. We don’t have open boarders to allow anyone in. Americans deserve to be protected and boarders do that.

That’s the fact of today’s world children are sold and then groomed. How about American parents who have been permanently separated from their child due to child being killed by an illegal. Where’s the libs concern for them?#KAG!🇺🇸#GOPwave2018
Children who have been separated from parents at boarder crossings are being treated better then we treat our own kids. Libs say we have no hearts, that can’t be further from the truth. The main objective is to make sure that child is safe and not brought here to sell.
Those problems have been fixed by President Trump his 1st yr in office. Obama had 8yrs and he fixed nothing. The Dems have reached a desperate time and will be as dirty as they need to be to undermine Americans. They worry about illegals not the well being of Americans.
They hammered out a fix today but do you think the Dems really want to fix it? Sen Schumer won’t support this bill that keeps family together. What would they run on for midterms they have nothing else going for them. They can’t run on a bad economy or unemployment.
Where was all the outrage when Obama’s administration did the exact same thing that President Trump is doing today on the boarder? They weren’t calling him evil and he even put them in cages remember pics that they tried to blame President Trump for but were old pics from Obama.

Had the FBI done it’s job correctly without outside influence which I believe they had Hillary would have been charged with punishable felonies. Loretta Lynch obstructed Justice by meeting with Hillary’s husband days before her FBI interview.
It’s so wrong Hillary was allowed to walk away from her crimes and she took our trust of the FBI with her. How can we trust an agency that has such rapid bias running through it. Hillary should never have been allowed to campaign for POTUS. She’s a felon or would’ve been.

Hillary lied to the American people we know she did. The facts are there and those protecting her should be embarrassed. All those in FBI who lied for her should be charged for it.  No justice for the guilty no trust in justice system.
The only way that can happen is for the truth to be finally told and those who broke our laws be brought to justice regardless of your name. Hillary’s private server investigation should be reopened and let the chips fall where they may. It’s time for truth and justice.
It’s time for all of you Dems to wake up and smell the coffee. Americans are learning how the game was played and we don’t like it. We demand honesty from our highest law enforcers and FBI has let us down. The trust is gone until honesty restored to FBI.
Peter Stryzok had sent text messages showing his bias against then candidate Trump. Stryzok in one text said he would stop Trump from being our President. How was he going to do that? FBI agents used vulgar language to describe Trump supporters. Yet theirs no bias?
What’s happen to equal justice for all. Justice is suppose to blind except when it’s a Clinton. The FBI treated her differently then they would the average American. The FBI showed bias in favor of Hillary. Comey exonerated her months before Stryzok even interviewed her.
It wasn’t a accident she destroyed emails that were under subpoena by our congress. The last time I looked they called that obstruction of justice. My bad it was a Clinton so that’s makes it ok. Now had that been me I’d be locked up and key thrown away. Yet you can call it fair?
@RepCummings The only verdict acceptable for Hillary is guilty. The reason for that is she is guilty of committing the crimes she has been accused of. It was her choice to use a private unprotected server to send classified docs to. It wasn’t by accident she did this.
How can anyone with common sense set there and say no bias was shown? How many GOP attorneys are on Mueller’s Russian collusion team? How many Dems are on his team. How many also investigated Hillary’s private server? Enough said!
These same FBI agents said discouraging words showing their bias against then candidate Trump. Stryzok assured Page that Trump would not win the presidency it would be stopped. How were they planning on stopping Trump from being elected? Were they attempting to interfere?
Nothing odd about a exoneration letter being wrote months before interviewing her. To top it off Stryzok change exoneration letter to appear no crime committed. If this is what we have running our FBI were in trouble. The FBI agents had Hillary winning election.
We have established policies to follow by law. Hillary ignored them all and did it the way she wanted. All her acts were criminal yet somehow they found nothing to charge her with? Hell you can drive a truck through that mess! She was exonerated months before being questioned.
A sailor took pics on his sub to show his son what his job was he received a yr in prison. Hillary’s server was hacked and secret docs taken how much time was she given. Classified docs found on Anthony Weiner’s pc from her. Was she charged for begging careless?
Hillary was just tired and needed to sleep. While Americans were being killed they slept well that night. Hillary was treated like no other person would have been after using unprotected private server to seen classified docs to. It wasn’t by accident it was on purpose.
Hillary and Obama poorly handled the situation in Benghazi. They both lied to the American people on the attack cause. They both acted careless that faithful night. While Americans were being killed these two leaders were in bed asleep. Obama had to go to Vegas to collect checks.
@RepJerryNadler What planet are you on? To say no bias found in IG report is quite the tale. The texts from Stryzok and Page alone show serious bias. The choice not to charge Hillary Clinton is 100% political bias. She committed serious crimes against our legal code.

Had Hillary won our economy would have continued to struggle. Our stock market wouldn’t be hitting record highs, our unemployment rates wouldn’t be at record lows. Hillary wouldn’t have brought jobs back as President Trump has. She wouldn’t put us back on the world stage.
They wanted President Trump out. After all they worked hard to get Hillary elected so they could keep crimes committed by Obama’s administration covered up. Let’s face Obama’s goal was to destroy America and Hillary was to finish the job Obama  started.
Read the text from Page and Stryzok and tell me they weren’t out to get President Trump no matter what they had to do. Hence the Russian collusion investigation. It was their attempt to frame the President for a crime he didn’t commit. They wanted to fix election results.
President Trump fires Comey which is his right and Dems are ready to impeach him on obstruction of justice charges. The IG tries to tell us there wasn’t any political bias? If the IG brought in a outside prosecutor Hillary wouldn’t be walking free. FBI was bias as hell!
Hillary Clinton destroyed emails that were under subpoena by congress using a bleach bit, she destroyed devices under subpoena by congress using hammers and removing SIM cards. Where in the world of justice is that not obstruction of justice? How could Comey clear her?

All our President is doing is preventing a innocent child from being molested. We must face the facts we have sexual deviants who desire young children to fill their sexual perversions. Some parents are willing to sale their children some for cash some for drugs.
@SenSchumer Do the Dems prefer children being brought across our boarder and being sold to the highest bidder? That’s what happening children are being sold to highest bidders and used to fulfill their sick sexual desires to rape a child.
The DOJ and FBI are delaying in turning over requested docs to oversight committee in hopes Dems win back house and end oversite hearings. We can’t let this happen we deserve to know the truth. Dems don’t wasn’t truth they want to impeach the President we elected.#KAG!GOP2018
@SenWhitehouse Did you have a Martini lunch today before hearings? Your questions sounded slurred and made absolutely no sense.
In the IG report so much bias from the FBI was put on display. Leaks came from the Dem side of the political isle. There were no texts to prove any bias against Hillary but many against our President. Maybe you need to study report more or is it your age that’s distorted it.
@SenBlumenthal #enough is quite appropriate for you! To use today’s hearings to disrespect our President in such a manner! The only lies being told are through Hillary’s claims of Russian collusion. There never should have been a special counsel. It was done for political reasons
Yet President Trump exercised his right and fired Comey. They want to charged President Trump with obstruction for what was his constitutional right. He didn’t need a reason to fire Comey.  If he fires AG Sessions it’s his right to do so and maybe should along with Rosenstein.
He worked with Comey in writing her exoneration letter months before talking to her. Comey lied to Congress saying the hadn’t predetermined her guilt or innocence. Hillary’s emails were under subpoena when she ordered them to be destroyed. That’s not obstruction?
It wasn’t the rank and file saying President Trump wouldn’t be President. It wasn’t the rank and file making bias comments about our President but it was Peter Stryzok. He’s the one who protected Hillary Clinton from being charged as she should’ve been.
How can Wray say There wasn’t any political bias? Has he read the texts wrote by Peter Stryzok? That not bias? Do they think we’re that stupid not to see the bias? The upper management needs work not the rank and file agents in the FBI.

Had a Trump supporter made them about Hillary it’d be front page news. That person would have been ran through the coals with no mercy. It’s time we have equal justice for all no matter who you are or what political party you belong to. No one above our laws, my bad Hillary is.
When will the tables be turned and the real criminals be charged. The evidence is slapping us in the face why can’t they see it? I can tell you bias is in the way blocking their view. Look at text messages from Peter Stryzok they don’t prove bias? His statements don’t show bias?
Had they looked at the Hillary server case as hard as they’ve looked at the Russian collusion hoax she’d be locked up today. She started the Russian collusion story to take the eyes off of her. It was a farce to frame our President for a crime not committed by him.
It’s time to take out those who don’t want the truth known. They don’t want the truth out to save their asses from prison. It’s time we have fair justice for all not just the poor. No one is above the laws of America.#KAG!🇺🇸
Everyone needs to encourage their congressional rep to do the right thing with DOJ and FBI. Let them know you have their backs if they choose to impeach those who are obstructing their investigation. It’s ok they can grow a set for America.

It’s time for congress to grow a pair and take action. If AG Sessions refuses to charge these people then congress should immediately take the steps to impeach him. No more playing chicken we the people will have your backs, always will for equal justice for all.
It was his insurance policy to keep President Trump from serving as our President. He tried to interfere with a national election and should be charged with it. Instead of getting a tax payer funded paycheck he should be wearing a orange jumpsuit provided by the tax payers.

They have all committed crimes that can be proven in a court of law. It’s time to hold people accountable for their crimes. The Russian collusion story needs to end it was to frame our President for a crime that didn’t exist.#KAG!🇺🇸
You want to gain the trust of Americans in the FBI then you need to earn it. To earn it you need to do the right things. It’s time to give out honest justice. No one not even Hillary should be above the law. Hillary along with Comey, McCabe, Lynch and Obama should be charged.
Did members of FBI upper level try to fix election for Hillary to win? Not to hand over the texts that IG found to Congress is obstruction. It’s time for congress to start charging people for it. It’s time to put fresh eyes to investigate Hillary’s server case.
Why are any these people walking free? Texts from Peter Stryzok reveal bias against President Trump. Another says Viva la resistance against President Trump. These were Govt employees why are they still employed?
It wasn’t by accident classified docs ended up on Anthony Weiner’s laptop it was a deliberate act. People have gone to jail for less. Obama sent emails to her private server Comey and Stryzok covered it up not by accident. All acts were deliberate and on purpose.
@FBI If FBI thinks IG report has made us more encouraged with the FBI wrong. The IG has tried to dance around what actually happened. There was bias when it came to Hillary Clinton. She didn’t accidentally send classified docs to her private unprotected server it was on purpose.
She lost because of her dishonesty not the Russian BS the left is putting out. Your BS story has cost Americans millions in tax dollars that could have been better spent. In the end we will remember how you’ve wasted our money and treated our President.#KAG!GOP2018🇺🇸🇺🇸
Her crimes were more serious then the Navy guy who took pics to show his son what he did in Navy. He served a year in prison she walked free and ran for president but lost. One reason she lost was the failure to charge her so the American people did.
Hillary’s server investigation needs to be reopened and look at by a fresh set of eyes. Many people should be charged with felony crimes and if justice is fair for all they will be. Their is no special justice system for Hillary is there? If there is please tell us about it.
We now have a President who is rebuilding America after Obama nearly destroyed us. The Viva Resistance text also is quite questionable and needs further explanation from FBI agent who sent it. So many things need further investigation after IG report.
Where did they get their info she would win? Were they attempting to rig the election for her to win? That 1 text has opened a can of worms they will regret. It’s time for deep state to walk away and accept that they’ve been outsmarted by Americans. Obama’s cult can leave commune
@SenSchumer To say IG report is nothing is a falsehood. It’s loaded with info that shows so much Bias from FBI. To say President Trump would never be President needs to be fully investigated and determined how they were going to stop it. FBI mgnt thought Hillary would win.

He has no one pulling his strings. He’s a builder and so far he’s done a great job rebuilding America after Obama tried to dismantle us. We’re hitting record economy growth that we were told couldn’t be done. President Trump has done it.
If voting for President Trump makes me a POS then so be it. I’ll proudly be whatever they want to call me for supporting President Trump. We elected a man who does things the way he wants to do them. He has no one telling him how to act. He’s just what we ordered.
If supporting my President makes me part of a cult then so be it. Of course we know just because they worshipped the ground Obama walked on didn’t make them a cult. They just haven’t left the commune yet. It’s time to kick them out.
