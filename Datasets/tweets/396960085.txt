@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC That is correct
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC It’s like you don’t want to know there are hospitals out there that offer financial assistance?
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC I live in a small town in Oklahoma. I travel to different hospitals located in Dallas, Missouri, Oklahoma and others. St. John’s, Mercy are just two located in thes states. A person needs to research prior to receiving care.
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC Nope! They can NOT refuse treatment.
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC There are hospitals that right off 100% of medical expenses if a patient does not have the ability to pay. They cannot refuse treatment at sister of mercy hospitals.
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC Of course not. Sometimes patients actually have to take matters into their own hands, even through the most difficult times of their lives.
@DamianImperius @TonyAtamanuik @AOC I would say educate yourself prior to receiving treatment. Sister of Mercy Hospitial’s determine financial responsibility based on charity guidelines. They also have cancer centers https://t.co/wrekwkSfmA

@anastasia_b87 @vnbateman All!
@anastasia_b87 @vnbateman But it does. Just because you refuse to recognize the reality of my body my choice, doesn’t change the fact that’s in exchange for a women’s choice of convenience a child is murdered.
@anastasia_b87 @vnbateman If it’s her body her choice then why is prostitution illegal in every state other then Nevada? It’s only her body her choice during pregnancy no other time so tell me again how this is not for convenience only?

@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse When we are interfering with the countries ability to survive on its own how are we helping?
@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse You stated it’s non existent, explain where I’m wrong?
@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse In Haiti, U.S food aid flooding the market has provided cheap food but driven many Haitian farmers off the land. Haiti has a reputation for corrupt government, but waste, mismanagement, fraud and corruption also plague charities, non-governmental organizations and aid agencies.
@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse 1) Baidoa, Somalia (CNN) The murderous al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab is making millions of dollars each year by exploiting foreign aid money sent to Somalia by the very western nations who are trying to eliminate the terror group. I’ll wait!
@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse How many times have we seen government aid not make it to organizations that help those in need? It falls into the hands of corrupt government officials while the horrific conditions still remain for the people who need it the most.
@jade_cabochon7 @WhiteHouse Your ignorance already prove that

@ChrisCJackson @SinfulBehaviors Republicans do not be fooled. Democrats embraced KKK Grand Cyclops Robert Byrd. Do not support the removal of Gov. Ralph Northam.

@Beijo11 @SinfulBehaviors @bradlander @AOC Cruel by no means. Intolerant to people making matters worse by inciting inmates to rage. Temperatures within the center have hardly been low enough to cause hypothermia. This is a unfortunate situation that is being addressed as quickly as possible.
@SinfulBehaviors @bradlander @AOC Naive, no. Common sense, absolutely. If the people outside aren’t freezing then obviously neither are those inside

@mrm2u You refuse to except the truth. CNN and other media sources posted a picture of Ralph Northam from his high school yearbook. They falsely claimed he’s a Republican and demand he resign as gov.
