@realDonaldTrump Just because you're bankrupt doesn't mean the rest of us can't afford gas.
@thehill Her face is literally the lightest part of this photograph.
@realDonaldTrump That's okay, collusion isn't really a crime anyway. Just a reminder - you are being investigated for many things that are.
@realDonaldTrump You truly are a child.
@skolanach Fuuuuuck
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should go halfway there
@realDonaldTrump Oh Jesus, it learned how to rhyme.
@LindseyGrahamSC Don't you mean FAAAbulous!?
@anylaurie16 Go nuts on their school, they were originally there protesting reproductive rights: https://t.co/kFDEGBu3G8
@peltzmadeline Somebody please take his passport from him while he's there
@realDonaldTrump How is it that the real you is so much worse than Family Guy's version of you?
@CRMusicWriter @subpop If you play them backwards at 3x speed, you will hear the download codes spoken
@DannyC1234567 @staceydash Also you're a fake account.
@DannyC1234567 @staceydash That was our president.
@realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, I just can't think of any more ways to call you a dumb shit.
@kaichoyce That's a lot of negatives, I'm gonna need a pencil and paper.
@realDonaldTrump It's sad that we have to read the words of a true idiot.
@jazzbonist @Sid_Madden A logistical nightmare but worth a try
@realDonaldTrump This is code for "I haven't done shit all morning."
@Sid_Madden Marcus Lewis Brass &amp; Boujee! @jazzbonist
@realDonaldTrump He lied. Guess where he learned that?!
@realDonaldTrump We know you're not serious about border security until you start advocating for a wall between the US &amp; Canada.
@AG_Conservative Not a math major, were you? The facts that the bottom 25% had an average score of 1460 and that his was 1270 don't conflict at all. You could even throw a 200 in there (or whatever our president would get for writing his name correctly on the test form) and still have a 1460 avg.
@FewerMiles Sandra Bernhard
@RyanABlack Is he announcing retroactively for last year?
@bonniemcfarlane Do you think she has a brother named Stu?
@realDonaldTrump See if you can get your cellmate to believe that, nobody else does.
@anylaurie16 No, but drinking out of a measuring cup is a cry for help.
@ColeEscola I could use a new tux.
@realDonaldTrump Russia's been actively fucking you for years and you still haven't told anyone about it.
@realDonaldTrump I hope that gives you comfort after you’ve lost everything else.

@RepSwalwell Other than putting it in print, the best way to make sure Donald doesn't read something is to put it between two covers.
@HallieJackson I would've given you even odds that they couldn't spell both Council and Advisers correctly.
@realjonlovitz “I’m champagne and YOU’RE shit!!”
@realDonaldTrump You are the clump of hair keeping the drain plugged.
There’s speculation that the NYT Op-Ed was written by Pence due to the use of ‘lodestone’ and ‘cold comfort’ but I suspect the words ‘impulsive’ and ‘reckless’ suggest it was actually penned by Wilson Phillips
@TexasGOP There’s not enough time in the day to play a gig, crush some puss AND debate Ted Cruz.
@chuckwoolery Don’t bother, we don’t need your help.
@realDonaldTrump The only thing you smile at is somebody jingling their keys in front of your face.
@nbcsnl Norm MacDonald!
@nbcsnl Michelle Buteau!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump If he has a hand in it it’s bound to turn to complete shit soon enough.
@nbcsnl Marc Maron!
@nbcsnl The 2 Dope Queens
@nbcsnl Greg Proops!

@realDonaldTrump @PARISDENNARD @seanhannity I had you pegged as more of a Gilligan’s Island kinda guy.
@GregProops I just heard this in an old SNL skit in which Mary-Gross-as-fairy recites it to Joe-Piscopo-as-clown, who then eats her spine. Still... https://t.co/mO38ljf9By

@realDonaldTrump I’m going to take a nap. Wake me up when anybody gives a shit what this guy is talking about.
@realDonaldTrump I think you meant “speaking at”
@realDonaldTrump As usual, substitute ‘Trump’ for any name in Trump’s tweet and it’s still true.
RT @sadmonsters: If Trump wants a big parade in his honor all he has to do is resign
@realDonaldTrump Who wrote this? Because there’s no way you know how to use quotation marks properly.
@realDonaldTrump I’m going to have a party after the last time I ever have to hear your name.
If Carole King isn’t a billionaire, she will be after today.
@theprojecth Have you checked @westerliesmusic? Whole different kind of brass band, but maybe they qualify.
