This is an interesting way to look at CO2.  		https://t.co/KSC8b2PqES
Here are a bunch of articles against the CO2 is evil theory.  		https://t.co/cBEGljkkiv
@EcoSenseNow @AOC With my technology there will be no mass deaths.  If you don't address the insane CO2 globalists they will use CO2 to kill.  This is why getting my engine (or similar) to the public is critical to all of our survival.  Happy to discuss it.  Let's unplug the death squads by tech.
@EcoSenseNow @AOC Pat, if I could triple CO2 I would.  Greenhouses use 1200 ppm.  The technical fact is electro-chemicals are enabled when electricity is cheap.  Air craft carriers are going to make the Jet fuel via the nuclear reactor.  EVs are the problem (toxic) and less efficient than my tech.
@EcoSenseNow @AOC Banning fossil fuels is also stupid in the extreme.  By going to NH3 for transit, backup for grid, and heating homes, OIL can be used for the millions of products needed.  Why burn the good stuff.  Fuels can be used in engine and NH3 substituted when cheaper.  All doable.
@EcoSenseNow @AOC Patrick, electro NH3 via nuclear/wind/solar is possible at $0.50-2/gal e.  NH3 can run our cars, boats, trains, airplanes, and more.  My engine is the key engine type needed.  Existing cannot.  NH3 is what keeps 1/2 the population alive.  Just make it with electricity, not CH4.
@FredKrupp Fred, do you want an ASAP path to zero carbon?  Happy to discuss it.  Electric cars can't get you there ASAP, if ever.  If not, then please stop the nonsense.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu Elon did not even invent his car.  Alan Cacconi did. Look it up. The guy is a CO2 crazy and thinks toxic waste fire hazards called batteries can power the world.  I am not interested in his stuff and he can't see past what he is doing and what is needed to get to zero carbon....
@luisbaram @An3Barascu Welcome to reality.  They (VW and most car companies) will be making only electric cars.  You will be stuck to the tit of the grid at inflated prices (up to 49 c/kwh= $16.5/gal e).  You will not have a choice unless I (or similar) can get this engine to market.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu It will be 4-32 times less than an EV.  Roadable airplanes is the future and batteries don't work in aircraft.  Go ahead and enjoy the EV car.  Keep me posted on your range issues.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu Yes, I am patient.  Enjoy your EV.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu I don't estimate.  I am looking for the right people.  One auto company can do it.  I have not marketed to them for several reasons.  What is your point?  One rich guy and it is over for EVs.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu You don't understand.  My engine can run on gasoline, Diesel, Propane, Jet A, 100 LL, Ethanol and NH3.  By installing in car you cut 75% of fuel needs instantly.  I am not producing fuels.  NH3 will be turned on slowly from 2030-2050 as Nuclear power or renewables go full NH3.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu If I had 1% of the investment money as electric gets i would put EVs out of business and I would own the engine market from large to small.  This is not an old Otto/Diesel engine or turbine.  Don't judge before you know....
@luisbaram @An3Barascu Never if I get no help, just like we would not have any energy system if nobody invested.  It could be 100% by 2030 if I gave it away.  Why?  because people would buy it for a 4x fuel economy increase.  Old engines would not be wanted at all.  EVs would be rejected too.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu Once you are freed from the oil you are at a price for NH3 that allows cheap transit on ground and air.  Flying will be cheaper than driving due to the "grid" called a road.  No grid (road) fees when you fly.  Flying and batteries don't work well at all.  Hence my engine.
@luisbaram @An3Barascu To bring the world up to some level of energy use close to western countries without my engine (or similar) and NH3 (or similar) would make OIL go to $200/barrel.  But NH3 can be made for less than $1/gal e with non grid solar and cost effective nuclear. Save oil for other things
@luisbaram @An3Barascu The reason I propose NH3 and other electro-chemicals is so that ALL people can access to the benefits of oil and gas.  Using NH3 from wind/solar/nuclear for vehicles allows all to travel as much as they want and still allow oil for other things needed for life.

Amazing grace....how sweet this is....  You need a merit badge or something.  BTW, Q+ =Trump....
@An3Barascu @luisbaram CO2 is at starvation levels and I would triple it if I could and nothing but benefits would occur.  The planet (deserts) would "blossom as a rose" and life would be much better with 1200 PPM.  Read my tweets if you think CO2 is a problem.  I have solution.  Want to help?

OK.  CO2 does not contribute to warming at any level.  More just lowers the height to extinction.  The IR spectrum is not 100% attenuated and thus more CO2 cannot do anything.  Triple CO2 and nothing would happen.

Is there one AGW believer that wants to zero out the Carbon?  		So far I have not found ONE, including Bill Gates, who will discuss real solutions.  CO2 is just a way to make money...a scam.

Get the oil out, you get the CO2 out.  No more CO2 to argue about.  If I could I would triple the CO2, but CO2 only has a 10 month to 10 year residence, depending on data and analysis.  I think it is gone in 10 months (Murry Salby's calculations).

The question is how to unplug this cult?  My engine and NH3 can get the CO2 out and get everybody independent of oil and green.  When I need to use oil, great, but not dependent on it.  No grid.

@JudyOsburn8 Let them all kill themselves and be done with it....
@leannerva @elfidaceren @itsbluntmanbruh Why did you tweet my name?
@SteveSGoddard @NickCaumanns @NikolovScience @FakeLeftSucks @ScottAdamsSays Also, all the air, not just GHGs radiate.  This is why in infrared glasses you can see the air glow and bodies are black.  The SB equations does NOT apply to 3 D air and thus gives crazy answers that confuse most.  Without SB, the entire GHG theory is not enabled.
@SteveSGoddard @NickCaumanns @NikolovScience @FakeLeftSucks @ScottAdamsSays Radiation occur along the entire column of air, not just from the ground.  SB equation is for a 2 dimensional opaque body that does not allow radiation along the column but only on the surface.  Thus actual SB numbers at 300 K are 40 times overstated and radiation is over column.
@SteveSGoddard @NickCaumanns @NikolovScience @FakeLeftSucks @ScottAdamsSays Air COOLS the planet, it does NOT heat it.  Stephan Boltzmann give the wrong 33 degrees (Masons???) of heat trapping, which is bogus.  An airless planet would be 250 F as a black body, not -18 C as claimed.  Radiation is 1-3%, not 79% as NASA claims.  SB off by 40 times actual.
@SteveSGoddard @NickCaumanns @NikolovScience @FakeLeftSucks @ScottAdamsSays The reason clouds make it warm is because they indicated a low level of vertical convection.  Also the heat capacity of the water in the air acts as a battery, just like it does on the ground in plants.  Again, the "greenhouse" does NOT occur and is NOT the cause, as Fourier said
@SteveSGoddard @NickCaumanns @NikolovScience @FakeLeftSucks @ScottAdamsSays Tony, the greenhouse effect does not occur, as Fourier stated in 1820, until the entire IR spectrum is attenuated.  A gate half open can't trap half the sheep and neither can 1/2 the spectrum be open (unattenuated) and a greenhouse occur, just as Fourier predicted.
@OffGridMedia @slashdot Unplug them all with new engine and NH3.
@presleyjohn99 @100PercFEDUP She would need my seaplane running on renewable made NH3 to not be a hypocrite.  In fact all of these people need it go not be hypocrites.  I have tweeted them all about it....NO response.  hmmm.
@Condor_Law @DNC Dems are barking up the wrong tree...ah, where is the tree... their dogs can't even recognize a tree from a star on a walk.  Must be "rough...rough" to be a Dem.

@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Correct, but between overhauls the cost is zero.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Diesel plane cannot begin to do what I want to do with my seaplane.  Besides my engine is 7 times lighter than a semi truck engine.  Soybean oil would be an option, but, again, the goal is independence, and buying fuel from someone just costs a lot of money.  Free is better....
@FK49899820 Yes, I am very cautious.  It will meet the needs of my seaplane whereas nothing out there can do what is needed to make seaplane work as it needs to.
@LauraBl42334579 Can we just start with NO AOC and drop the rest?
@FK49899820 What a ghastly question.  No cow fart.  Only fairy dust and unicorns.  Seriously, a new engine is needed to solve our energy problems.
@FuctupMike There is a way to get zero carbon.  Read my tweets to find out.  Too lazy?  I guess you can pay 30-50 c/kwh.  Enjoy.  As for me, I see free fuel on the horizon.
@FuctupMike The entire movement is full of idiots who can't think further than their nose.  PV panel owner says...the grid is my battery...I say, shut up idiot...nobody wants your stupid power when everybody has solar on their roof....  This is the level of stupid we are talking about.
@FuctupMike If you actually follow the problem of INTERMITTENT power you realize that the "greens" did not have a plan that could work going back 30 years.  This requires some sort of storage like NH3 (Ammonia) that can be made by electricity and used to bridge times when wind/solar quit.
@HeyJuvat @stripedbanana3 @tammy_maga There must be a brain virus going around Hollyweird.

Another 10 years to install many.  People could then use NH3 as Nuke plants make it to dump excess power.  Maybe with my engine they will see how the system can work to get to zero carbon...
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Yes, NH3 is not new.  I am looking for low cost electro-fuel options and NH3 is the lowest, but there are issues with it.  Many "green" people are looking towards NH3 so my effort can piggy back on their efforts as long as my engine can use NH3.  That is my focus now.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt My tweets crunch the number in front of everybody so they can see how the read numbers actually work out.  I am an open book when it comes to real numbers.  They must work out or it won't work.  So far this appears to be something I will invest in.  Just making sure publicly.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt There is a transition to NH3 and solar via house which allows all to use oil if needed until they can have a house with NH3 maker and solar.  This takes money and poor people don't have it.  Make them rich and they will use NH3 95% of the times.  Oil then cheap for 100 years.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt If we can cut 75% of the oil out of American's car use, that oil saved can be used by someone in India or China to run their car. All people can have fuel and get out of poverty.  Then we can slowly lower use by using solar and NH3 so prices can be LOW for all.  Understand?
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt This engine can go in house, car, truck, boat, airplane, and can be scaled up.

NH3 is.  10,000 vs 250 psi.  40:1.  Propane tanks are cheap. My tank could take crash...long discussion.  Yes, it all costs insane money.  That is why I am at my engine design.  CHEAP and can be massive volume across many product lines due to modular...&gt;

I tweets a lot on NH3 makers...Stanford.  I am NOT making the NH3 makers.  Other people will due to the need for storage on grid.  That is my bet.  Could be wrong.  Conversion factor could be 1.1-1.5 x for NH3
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt The claim of AOC is no airplanes.  My engine makes airliners unneeded.  Door to door taxi for less than airliners per passenger MPG.  The future is flying will be cheaper than driving.  My engine is needed to make it happen.  It just so happens to solves energy too.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Want to unplug the EV and anti oil?  you need my engine (or similar) and the motive to go electric is gone due to the advantages this new engine offers.  It is needed for my roadable seaplane.  A Diesel or Otto engine will 100% not work. Lots of blown wing power....future.

This engine can UNPLUG the EV mafia and the "ban combustion" gang via equal to 2x better energy use in vehicles, and NH3 (zero C), which the grid needs to deal with wind/solar up and down.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Remember, my engine can run an gasoline and Diesel.  The average Joe does not need solar or wind.  They just need my engine in his car.  25 mpg to 100 mpg.  That is an easy sell.  They are immediately IPCC 2050 compliant....Understand?

An independent guy has one.  NH3org.  This has to be made mainstream and I don't claim to have a model that is very good, just that other people have them.  Yes, PV panels are still more....  Yes, wind is emotion.  Solar on my house with NH3 storage will work.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt The key to future is this ability to use many fuels and FLY.  Without it you can't get your roadable airplane from house (NH3 or Propane), Station (gasoline, Diesel), or airport (Jet A or 100 LL).  Electric power also enabled with heat via electricity in new motor, if needed.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt The fact that Otto/Diesel engine can't do solar thermal will be the end of them.  My IC engine can run on solar, 5 fuels and NH3.  This will be key to survival of IC engines.  Meets all the crazy demands of Alarmists at much less than anything they have.  Game over....
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Assume 20% for Diesel at my house vs 75%.  Diesel is $2.5/gal.  NH3 can be 50 c/gal e.  75/20 x 2.5/.5= 18.75 times MORE for fuel.  Then add in 80% of the time running on solar, and storing it.  Add in that 80% of time no fuel used...solar.  18.75/.20 = 93.75 x cost ratio ~ 100:1
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Moreover, my engine should be 60% at high power and 75% when low power on combined cycle.  Diesel can't do combined and would be low efficiency at low power setting...maybe 18-20%.  A Dodge Diesel pickup is 18% efficient.  Great for large grid, but not house and spike loads.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt I agree, but a Diesel is NOISY and harsh.  Won't work in houses, or run on NH3 or Diesel.  It won't get me independent either.  I only need 1-3 Kw for house.  Small Diesels can't respond as a micro grid or 1/2 sine wave uninterrupted power well without lots of costs in spin...&gt;
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt I can see $2000 overhaul on 40,000 hrs and 20 Kw.  40k x 20= 800,000 kwh.  2000/800,000= .0025.  About 1/2 to 1/4 the cost of Diesel/ kwh.  At $0.0025 x 1.5 conversion to NH3 x 33.7gal e/kwh = 12.6 c/ gal e.   4 overhauls and 20k engine.  28k/3.200,000 kwh=$0.00875/kwh &lt; Diesel.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Diesel semi 1 mil miles at 50 mph = 20,000 hrs at around 248 hp ave and 185 KW.  20,000 x 185 =3,700,000 kwh.  $20,000/3,700,000 = 0.005.  Warranty cuts out in 500k miles (1/2 above), so the reliable range is 1 c/kwh.  Ten times better than Lycoming.  About right...
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt For example, a Lycoming engine.  $20,000 overhaul.  2000 hrs.  180 hp peak, 134 KW at 75% = 100 KW over 2000 hrs = 200,000 kwh.  $20,000/200,000 kwh = 10 cents/kwh just for the engine.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt A new engine is needed. Otto/Diesel engine design will NOT work, nor can they use solar thermal to make renewable energy like mine can.  It must run on 5 fuels and NH3 or other electro-fuel.  This way you can run 24/7 anywhere.  The overhaul costs alone are much too high for old.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Dio, If I could I would triple CO2....  My point is there is a way to unplug both big oil and big green and allow people to be independent without grid(s).  That is my goal.  CO2 is "entirely beneficial" as some say.  Diesels are much to inefficient.  My engine is KEY.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt People who have PV panels then will buy batteries to bridge 1 day.  What happens when solar does not work for say...a MONTH!???  Pull out that Honda generator and pray?  Good luck.  My system is 24/7 and 100% can be solar via NH3 storage.  NH3 is the battery....for months....
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt If nuclear is not an option then wind and solar can make NH3.  Eventually the grid will go belly up just like land lines have.  PV panels will not make money when excess is made by millions of other houses during peak days.  What then to do with PV?  NH3.  Need engine in cars...
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt The #1 problem with Nuclear is government involvement due to the bomb connection.  If it did not have toxic waste (300-millions of years) and potential for making bombs, it would be great.  This is why I did not go into nuclear engineering.  I want independence, not gov control.
@redforged42 @EcoSenseNow @HowardWorf Attract tourists?  New new wind mills won't be attracting many tourists, but I might be wrong.
@wattsupwiththat According to Murry Salby and his Mauna Loa frequency analysis, the time constant is 10 months, not 10 years, and clearly not 100 years.  At ten year as shown in your graph, CO2 is not an issue.
@EcoSenseNow The cost of electricity will have to be less than 2-3 c/kwh to make NH3 competitive to gasoline.  The grid is over if costs are cheaper without it.
@EcoSenseNow If Nuclear is too expensive then house solar will be enough.  Oversize it by 2x and make extra for winter and no solar days.  This technology will eliminate the NEED for a grid.  The question is if we will have one in the future and costs.  Low cost nuclear can save grid, but...&gt;
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt May be true.  My engine with solar and NH3 maker is good enough for me and my needs.  Store up solar via NH3 and use it in cars, airplane and house.  Use NH3 during no solar times.  Engine runs 24/7.
@alcpjr @drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Yes, the nuclear designs need to come down in costs by a lot and compete.  Nuclear plant on a semi truck...not some massive nonsense that needs permits and years of nonsense regs.  The Nuclear engineers are their own worse enemy.  New thinking is needed....
@drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Once the technology is ready, such as my engine (or similar...I have no lock on efficient engines, btw), the hurdles can be removed by both sides because both sides will want this IF CO2 is the issue.  If CO2 is a means to get their technology sold, then all will know.  Game over
@EcoSenseNow Yes, so do I.  $3 trillion for Nuclear vs $49 trillion AOC.  I read "roadmap to nowhere" and I agree, nuclear key.  No need for anything but nuclear and NH3 in cars, plus new engine (or similar).  NO toxic battery needed.  NH3 IS the battery.  See tweets.  Want to unplug them?
@EcoSenseNow New engine can get 100 mpg vs 25 mpg old.  This meets the IPCC 2050 goal just by installing engine.  New car + engine is 200 mpge.  No battery needed.  Runs on fossil fuels and NH3.  Plug to NH3 to car is LESS energy than plug to EV car due to battery weight of 2x.  see tweets.
@EcoSenseNow If I could triple CO2 I would.  The reason to go to NH3 is to unplug both factions that use energy for crazy politics.  NH3 will keep oil low, and will keep wind off grid.  Nuclear will be cheap with no peakers and excess is made into NH3 for vehicles.  Competition from many...&gt;
@EcoSenseNow Patrick, Yes I totally agree.  My point (here me please) is we can UNPLUG this debate via what I propose.  Engine can run 5 fossil fuels and NH3.  Get all with new engine and then switch to NH3 when cheaper than gasoline.  This will require low cost Nuclear (MSR).  Vehicles NH3.
@drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt My engine can get us via solar NH3 for less than $1/gal e and perhaps 50 c/gal e for NH3 over 20 year life cycle for engine.  Read my recent tweets.  Between overhauls, no costs...free fuel.  Key is storing up NH3 in tanks for winter use...3-4 months at least.
@drwaheeduddin @oldfosil66 @dbirch214 @serveBC @GillesnFio @Karajavuori @LpdlcRamirez @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @Barbarajdurkin @JaggerMickOZ @RonCrunt Dr. it is clear that wind/solar (intermittent sources) should be OFF grid and only used to make NH3 or similar (DC application).  Use NH3 in cars, trucks, airplane and more.  Nuclear should be above peak evening load (no peakers needed) and excess made to NH3.  Doable....
@JayInslee Jay, If you want to "solve" climate (reduce CO2) there are valid ways and not valid ways.  My engine technology along with others can do it.  No AOC plan can do it.  Stop using fear and government to sell junk technology that can't work.  Happy to discuss REAL solutions....
@EcoSenseNow The problem is I can turn something on and off, but I can't turn renewables on and off.  Thus, NH3 makes soak up excess power from base load suppliers (nuclear) and allow all power to be made via nuclear (or coal until nuclear is on line).  Wind/solar only make NH3 when able.
@EcoSenseNow By simplifying grid to ONLY nuclear with no peakers, the cost of electricity would be very low.  NH3 then is made from excess during low grid demands and from existing wind/solar.  Zero CO2 is doable, but not with AOC plan of no nuclear and wind/solar on grid.
@EcoSenseNow Wind should be off grid and used to make NH3.  Nuclear (MSR) should be the single source for grid to above peak evening loads.  Difference is used to make NH3.  NH3 makers control frequency and voltage by being turned on and off, not nuclear.  No peakers.  NH3 then runs vehicles.

My engine systems can do what you want.  Working on them now.  read my tweets....
By having NH3 you can have "free" fuel between overhauls.  This allows one to operate where competitors cannot if you wanted to play hard ball.  In semi truck fuel is 50 c/mile on a $2/mile load.  During recessions you keep driving rigs while others park it.
Old airplane and 3 old cars spend $26422 in fuel		Vs		New seaplane and 3 new cars spend $1335 in NH3....		which is actually "FREE" between 5 year overhauls
Buick at 25 mpg 15000 miles and $2.5/ gal fuel.  2.5/25 x 15000 = $1500.  Three cars = $4500.		My car 200 mpg 15k miles $1/gal e NH3.  1/200 x15k =$75.... 3x= $225		4500-225=$4275		Three cars + airplane save 4275 + 20812 = $25087/year in fuel costs.  Sweet!
Savings in fuel costs with my seaplane vs Cessna 210 at 12k ft and 200 mph for 200hrs per year. 		 5.55/200=$0.02775. .... X 40k =$1110. For seaplane		C-210 cost ratio 19.75 x $1110 =21922... -1110= $20812  saved in fuel cost flying 200 hrs at 200 mph.
A 1/2 scale seaplane able to carry 5 in tandem would be ideal for an air taxi door to door service.  5.55 gal/hr, 12k feet, 200 mph. C-210 would be 19.7 gal/hr at 200 mph.  $5/gal vs $1 gal e NH3.  200 hrs = 40k miles.  19.7/5.55 x 5 =17.75 x more/mile

@Bouncer1110 @luisbaram Electro chemicals have potential but clearly electricity would need to be 1 to 2 c/kwh to compete.  More CO2 is a good thing but if you want to unplug the co2 debate then my engine with NH3 or similar os path.  Green new deal is a scam.
@luisbaram USA grid is now 547 gCO2/kwh.  Denmark is 360.  France is 70 due to nuclear.  Some say the co2 scam was started by nuclear power supporters.  But cheap power became the enemy.  Can't have poor people living well now can we...
@luisbaram Take number of kwh made and use 800 g co2/ kwh and you would be close.  Coal is 900 to 1000.  Assume little less for average grid.
@luisbaram Since co2 is beneficial to planet does it really matter?
@luisbaram Nuclear grid AND NH3 making.  All intermittent renewable wind or solar off grid making NH3 no grid.  Best value for wind and solar is making NH3 and other electro fuels.
@luisbaram Correct.  Zero carbon would require electro fuels which require very cheap electricity and the processes.  Nuclear power MSR might be able but oil is needed for long time...
Many lakes have contamination from foreign marine life via boats.  Some states require inspection and decontamination before use.  NH3 + hot water can detox seaplane in air between lakes.  Carbon fuels can't.  NH3 key to seaplane use anywhere!
If i plugged my car into NH3 maker instead of car like EV does the fuel economy worst case would be 200/1.5=133 mpge vs EV at 100 mpge. Again no advantage to EV.  No water harvest/distill either in EV...  Can't drink or wash with electrons!
The weight of battery dooms the EV car for at least 1/2 the fuel economy compared to my car.  This makes an EV always more cost plug to wheel even with NH3 made from electricity.   1.1 to 1.5 factor between plug and wheel for NH3 is less than battery weight.
The 100 kwh battery can only be 60% used for long life.  True range is 180 miles (300 x.6=180).  To be 300 mile range the car  would be 2268 / .6 =3780 of unneeded weight in my car or 3 to 4x gross.  My car easily 2x economy over battery EV.
Weight of battery.  Assume 3 gal e for 300 mile max range.  100 kwh.  60 x 6.3 lbs/gal gasoline = 378...x3= 1134 lbs.  50% load fraction =  2268 lbs. 3 gal gas = 18.9 lbs.  50% = 37.8 lbs.  2268-38=2230 lbs my car does not need.  Battery doubles weight.
@ShaferCatrina Cat, thanks.  Water harvest and distilaation are part of the engine. 	 In house and camper apps i wont need sewer or water main for total grid free ops. 	  I want some in small vehicles for drinking and washing too.
@ShellenbergerMD @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Remember to mention NH3 and my engine.  2030 is doable to get 80% but not without my engine.
If you knew what I know, you would find it very funny how people go on and on about CO2.  Folks, this is NOT that hard to solve.  Just takes a few competent engineers willing to do some work.  All doable, big time.  And when you see it, you will say, "why didn't I think of that."
In fact, the moment you can buy my engine for a car, and the house system is ready to installed ready to make NH3, YOU can be mostly zero carbon just by installing it.  Imagine that.  Like taking a vaccine against climate change insanity and fraud.  SWEEEET!
So, if you really want to get the CO2 out, this engine is likely your best option by far, and is the fastest path to a true zero carbon future.  Electric cars won't get you there until well past 2050 (2070?) if ever.  My engine can get us all there by 2030-2040.
Think of the engine like an Obama Death-care killer, but instead of medical services, it is energy.  It neutralizes major idiots and control freaks in their quest to run our lives via this CO2 scam.  It gives me "standing" to sue to stop most "energy" research fraud from gov too.
Oh, another side benefit of this engine is it can unplug any CO2 tax and bankrupt people who promote theft of money via grid.  Oh the lawsuits! The claimed reason for some "green new deal" gets nuked, big time, and "the debate is over" as it were.  Problem solved.  Fun fun...
One of the cool side benefit of engine and down the list of reasons and motives is to solve the CO2 debate.  With this engine, we can stop talking about CO2 being evil or some stupid nonsense.  Energy is solar/wind/nuclear and NH3 based.  Notice NH3 has no C in it.  Peace.....
With this engine, a house can be built anywhere OFF GRID and it costs less than grid based systems and hook ups.  If NH3 is in short supply, just get some gasoline, Diesel, propane, Ethanol, Methanol, Bio, Jet A or 100 LL.  Whatever is available for the least cost per energy.
Another reason for my engine is independence for people in energy.  By having solar+engine+NH3, you make it possible to be oil free and thus energy independent via house or building.  Solar can be stored in NH3 for a years supply if wanted, and is just part of being prepared.
At the bottom of my list, #1000, of reasons and motives to do my engine  you find CO2.  Getting rid of CO2 is actually harmful to the planet  because CO2 is at starvation levels for plants.  But no CO2 also means no oil, which means no oil dollar, or oil wars.  Win-win
Notice CO2 is 1000 on a LONG list of Motives or Reasons.  If CO2 is #1 on YOUR list of things and it gets me my engine, then I can put CO2 at the top of my list because it requires my engine to get the CO2 out.  Read tweets.  You help me, I help you.  Quid pro quo.... https://t.co/ULPCmA0soU
My motives to get new engine type:		1) roadable seaplane needs new type for full performance	2) power house	3) solar power	4) "Free fuel" between 5 year overhauls via NH3	5) Fly instead of drive - safe, fun, quick (400 mph possible)	6) business	...	1000) unplug CO2 issue.
@TheRexeg The strategy now is to avoid installations in building due to UL listing issues and codes that can vary from location to location.  It might be wise for me to consult with a MEP firm.  I will look into it.  Thanks.
@TheRexeg They will be very important after I get the engine first article done.  Packaging for buildings will likely be in a shed to start with and lines to building. Remember this is a power system that goes in a car, airplane, truck, boat, and building codes are not the only issue.
Look folks, to get CO2 out only takes me and a couple competent mechanical engineers.  It does not take $trillion of tax dollars or politicians.  It takes ENGINEERING.  Want to solve the problem, then help me find the right people.  Save $49 trillion... and maybe a war or two. https://t.co/IY3Ntb47Tf
@KamalaHarris Kamala, you are not eligible, just like I am not.  Stop wasting people's time.  Yes we want to read the entire report.  Then move on.
Nice talk.  Puts some perspective to things.  Again, I think CO2 is good for planet.  More the better, but if you want to get the CO2 out, then my engine (or similar...no lock on efficiency) is the best option.  Screw the politics.  Do Engineer for once!	https://t.co/5YsOtB4rRy
@NickTrebla @simonahac Several NH3 makers show 1.35-1.55 times more energy in than out to convert.  This is still workable if the electricity is cheap and gasoline is high.  My solar electricity is driving by the maintenance costs.  I can see lower than 50 c/gal equiv or about 16 c/gal NH3!
@NickTrebla @simonahac Yes, I tweets most of the notable things.  Just go down to around Dec 18 and start reading and watching videos.  Make comments.  I will answer them.  The Stanford guy Jan from Norway thinks he can get a catalyst that can do the conversion for only 10% loss, like charging battery.
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp All the engine can be recycled.  Just metal and some other stuff.  Nothing toxic at all.  No complex electronic controls.  Simple $20 controllers.  Once people actually read my tweets they ask...who are you...way out of the box....advanced....  I have put a lot of time into this.
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp The battery is 60:1 to gasoline.  20:1 to NH3 in weight/energy.  They also cost 12 c/kwh to use, which is $4/gal e, which is about what 100LL costs.  With my engine par to electrics (60-75%) the fuel cost ratio and battery make it a $8/gal electric and $0-2/gal NH3-gasoline.
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp Yes, FREE fuel between overhauls.  In the pilot's world, they all complain about 100LL being $5/gal.  How about zero between overhauls of $500 every five year, not $$65/hr!  The idea of no fuel costs and flying every day...I will sell 10,000 airplane/year EASY!
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp What I want is to find people I can work with.  I don't do well with idiots.  I can sit down an size the person up and see if we can make a deal.  I get my engine so I can do my seaplane in volume and the rest negotiable. This can help so many companies....
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp As for backing, I am self funded.  My pinned tweets states what I am looking for, namely two more Mechanical engineers at my level (Masters or better) to help me do the work.  GM would have 100 people on this engine at least.  It can self fund once the prototype can go in trucks.
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp No, this is concept stage.  I am only into NH3 less than 2 months.  I was going to use Natural Gas, but found NH3 to be better for two reasons.  1) can be made via solar and 2) can be lower costs than Natural Gas via my engine.  I could have "free fuel" between overhauls! ...&gt;
Again, it is possible to meet the IPCC 80% reduction by using GASOLINE and my engine, but NOT with Electric cars and the grid.  My tweets clearly calculate this.  Not even close.  NH3 and other electro-fuels is the best way to get to zero carbon.  My engine is the key to use NH3.
@NickTrebla @billshortenmp Nick, NH3 is the key to storage for the grid.  Wind/solar should be off line and make NH3.  Molten Salt Reactors power grid constantly and as demand decreases at night, make NH3.  But first we need a NEW ENGINE that can run 5 fuels and NH3.  That is what I am trying to do....
Sweden was the first country to talk about "climate change" see 10:00 on.  Nasty country!  Frauds!  Acid rain scandal.  They wanted Nuclear.  Huge foundation in on fraud.  This is a good video to watch. https://t.co/ecyfO3GaAM

This guy makes the common mistakes people make in cost analysis of electric cars vs gasoline cars.  I comment below and correct him and then show what is possible.  I conclude my engine can be around 7 times less than EV with no battery included.  		https://t.co/rua5pubLvQ
The phase in of MSR nuclear plants in 2030 would allow the phase in of NH3 into new cars.  Since new engine makes new cars meet IPCC goals while still using gasoline, the switch to NH3 could come naturally by low priced NH3 via wind/solar/nuclear electricity and NH3 makers.
It will take Bill Gates until 2028 to get his new Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) done.  2030 online.  10 years to build out enough plants, 2040.  All cars with new engine by 2030. IPCC 80% reduction goal met in 2030, 20 year ahead via gasoline.  From 2030-2040, switch to NH3 via grid.
If my new car, that can add wings, were the standard, the world could drive around and only use 1/3 the current flow due to cars.  Add in trucks at 1/2 to 1/3 flow, and you have less than half the OIL needed and ALL the world is mobile like USA.  Then switch to NH3...zero carbon.
For the same fuel flow as 1 old car at 25 mpg, my new roadable airplane (without wings) can enable 10 such cars to drive with the same fuel flow as 1 old car. This allows 9 times more cars. 1.2 billion cars on road now.  3.6 billion needed? 3x?  3/10=0 .33  1/3 current fuel flows
Every old car that gets my engine allows 3 other "old" cars to drive for the same fuel flow.  		With my new car (roadable airplane without wings), 9 other "new" cars can drive where only 1 old car could before with the same fuel.  		250 mpg average new vs 25 mpg for old car.....&gt;
My engine also enables roadable airplanes that cost less than the tires, brakes, and road tax.  		In Africa, people can be mobile with this technology, whereas now they cannot due to the many costs.  This then  allows OIL companies to sell to Africa where now they cannot....&gt;
By increasing the fuel economy by 4x (25 mpg to 100 mpg, for example) each gallon of fuel does 4x the distance and therefore becomes 4x more valuable with my engine in terms of miles.  It also becomes 1/4 the cost which allows poor people to buy a gallon who before could not...&gt;
I find it interesting when I talk with oil people about what I am doing.  They think my technology will destroy their business.  No, my engine will allow oil to exist much longer due to many factors they fail to see.  These factors can extend their business out 30-60 years!
Much better than electrics in cost and many other ways.  It allows NH3 for the grid and solves the storage problem for the grid.  The grid then becomes a fuel source (NH3) for vehicles, as well as other electro-chemicals.  Wind/solar can have true value and not be a scam on grid.
Basically, these tweets since Dec 18th or so, show how to get to zero carbon.  Nh3 is the means and the engine systems are key.  I also show the real costs of Electric cars/trucks and how they compare to old cars/trucks and my new engine systems.  This engine is much better...&gt;
Just as Tesla does not have a "lock" on electric vehicles, I don't have a lock on 60-75% efficient engine systems.  You can figure it out too!  Go for it!  		Happy to discuss YOUR ideas and sign non disclosure and non-compete docs.  I might be able to save you a lot of money.
Please note that the numbers I am using can be achieved by anybody who wants to design an engine system.  I cannot prevent you from having the SAME performance as my engine system via some patent or proprietary trade secret.  The numbers are just showing what is possible.  Clear?
The people don't use gensets at home because:	1) noisy	2) poor Voltage + frequency control	3) low best case inefficiency	4) inefficient over range	5) poor maintenance duty cycle	6) Much higher costs than grid	7) Low night loads 	8) No other purpose	9) fuel access.
When solar thermal power is used, the low end efficiency below 1 KW is not important.  In most cases with NH3 storage, excess power from solar is used to make NH3, and the power is well above 1 KW.
By having several, at least three, motors + electric generators, all working together, a "micro" grid is formed that allows a wide range of efficient power generation.  Below 1 KW, it becomes difficult and a small battery/inverter can be used for critical electronic devices.
Both the old engine and electric generator have a range that they are efficient at.  Total efficiency is the multiplication of both.  The grid takes care of this my adding and subtracting engines, and so does my technology, in part.  A 20 kw genset is made up of several, not one.
The problem of efficiency in old Diesel/Otto engine generators is partly due to the constant RPM nature of the grid.  You can't shift gears easily to allow the engine to speed up and slow down to vary power.  The electric generator is also part of the problem. Range of efficiency
An old design genset can run you over $1.1/kwh, even $2 at low power settings. This is around 10 times more than grid.  But my motor can run on NH3 for 4 c/kwh fuel.  No worries about black outs.  This means fuels supplies will last too.  Why be on grid?  Good question....
My motor is at 60-75% and not 3-6% or less with the 16 hp genset.  		If fuel (gasoline) costs $2.3/gal at 6% efficiency it costs $1.13/kwh for fuel.  		At 20%, 2.3/33.7/.2= 34 c/kwh.  		At 75%?  2.3/33.7/.75=9 c/kwh.  		At $1 NH3 /33.7/.75=4 c/kwh....&gt;
But a small Honda generator can't start refrigerators and compressor motors.  Too much peak spike power.  The grid provides an infinite inertia to overcome the spike loads.  A small Honda generator does not.  To run your house you get a 16 hp genset that runs at 1-3 hp.  ineff
You have two things.  Power pulse and lowest idle and power speed.  In six cylinder motor, idle is 800 and min run is around 1000-1200.  1000/5000 x 200 hp x .5 throttle = 20 hp.  But you only need 1-5 hp, say.  Big engine being strangled for small power.  Hence a Honda generator
You ask, why can't I run my Buick engine and generate power?  Because a Buick engine is designed WRONG and is very inefficient at low power (2-5%?).  If peak power at 5000 rpm is 200 hp at 1500 rpm 60 hp.  1/2 throttle is 30 hp.  You only need 1-6 hp, not 30.  BSFC goes up 3-4 x.
By having some spare fuel (propane, gasoline, Diesel, 100 LL, Jet A) on hand, you can keep the electrical power on via the car running for as long as the fuel flows. You can then move to different areas and help people with emergency power if needed, for example.
With the car generator (various sizes....) you could also run any building that needs power via the power in the car.  Use the car fuel to run car engine + generator in car to  power building at less than grid rates.  No grid black out risks.  No spoiled food.  No hassles.
Moreover, if NH3 runs out, you can get propane, gasoline, Diesel, Ethanol, Jet A or even 100 LL if the stuff is really "hitting the fan."  All your neighbors are without power and you are running for less than grid rates.  Be grid connected or independent from grid.  Your choice.
This engine system allows uninterrupted power without the need for battery systems that have only short term power (minutes?)  With this system, the grid power can be out indefinitely (months?) and still function 100% normally without a 1/2 sine drop.  No black out risks at all.
For example, a Best Buy locally had issues with power dropping at the builidng they were leasing where power was cheaper.  They had to move to a new location due to the need to restart all their computers when 1/2 sine wave dropped. This cost more money to have secure power....&gt;
If you research or look into "back up" generators you soon realize they are very expensive and complex due to the characteristics of the Diesel engine used to drive the generator.  This ability to not "drop a half sine wave" is key to continuous uninterrupted power.
The key to this solution is the characteristic of the motor of no delay in response, not found in any IC engine.  This allows instant response to a torque demand, and no hesitation starting like you have with Diesel/Otto engines.  This allows for "electric" like torque response.
It takes a little power to run all three generators (not motor!) at synchronous speeds, ready to produce power.  The motor to torque a generator can be off/on instantly while the generators keeps spinning.  If the loads are low, just limit to none or just one generator in spin.
If you want to constantly make 3x power instead of only a spike load, you then run the other two generators for a total of 27 hp or 20 KW or max to grid for house installation.  It can spike to 60KW for short duration only.  To vary from 1-20 KW have all gens synchronized...&gt;
If you want to vary the power from 1-6 KW, only have one motor and generator on.  If you want to be able to take a spike load, the generator can produce short term power of 3x without spin needs.  The motor can vary by 3x (6-18 KW) of efficient torque x for a short duration.
Spin allows for large variations in power instantly.  The generator is alreay synchronized to the master and ready to produce power instantly.  The motors can be shut off, but can still respond instantly to torque the spin generator due to the design, unlike a Diesel/Otto engine. https://t.co/tPCC9QKWRa
By dividing up the electrical generators, which give a pure sine wave and not junk inverter waves, into three smaller generators, the efficiency can be maintained across the entire range of the additive generators.  During low power, "spin" is still required, just like grid does.
With 44,000 hrs on each motor and three motors, you would get 15 years   if you only ran 1 of three motors for house power at grid speed.  900 RPM would be 9 HP or 6.7 kw, enough to run house.  Other motors off and second generator ran as "spin" reserve ready for spike loads.
If you used engine in house at 900 RPM, you would get around 44,000 hrs or 5 years between "overhauls" if ran constantly.  If you make solar NH3 then the 900 rpm can go up much higher to get more power if not connected to grid.  Remember, three motors work, one grid, two NH3. https://t.co/twW95oCZiv
@RealCandaceO @MichaelCohen212 How can i help you go thermal?
@SenGillibrand Kirsten, my technology is the fastest way to zero carbon.  You can't get there without certain key elements that DON'T exist NOW.  Making more wind mills/solar will NOT work.  My tech is LESS than current.  No government action needed.  Happy to discuss.  PM me....
@wealthissimple @kwilli1046 @NLTCNY He barely go out of that alive.
Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming: there is no consensus.	Either way, my engine will improve your life.	https://t.co/hwhTHa24s5
Sweden started the global warming to promote nuclear?  I thought it was Margret Thatcher.  		https://t.co/V8TcTHb0Sc
@NickTrebla Not Icon.  Not rotax.  Not nh3 conversion.
@NickTrebla It flew again, but crash again when a wave caught the wing tip and spun him around.  It broke the window and other things.  Repairable.  I am to tall to fit into it.  He has other designs if interested.  He loves talking airplanes and designing.  Still alert.  93 years old.
@NickTrebla No, that airplane was a twice patented airplane called "Sea-Era" designed by Paul Weston, who is in a rest home now.  I did wind tunnel tests and designed the "high wing" (shown) it with him.  His "low wing" version crashed.  See   https://t.co/97Q2SrfLiH
Think of the NH3 maker like a very cheap battery.  You don't have a cost for 200,000 miles and then instead of $8000 for a battery (12 c/kwh), you have $500 (16:1 cost ratio).  This makes driving "free" if you don't pay road tax. The only costs are tires, brakes and road tax.
Again, with NH3 being made from house, the fuel costs are deferred to overhauls.  You therefore have 5 years of "free" fuel and then a maintenance cost.  Depending on who does the work, it can be very cheap to give engines another 5 years.  Buy kit, put on table, replace parts...
@NitroMidgets WIGs aircraft are not useful in my view, but the concept of triming the airplane to height is actually important for seaplanes.  I almost got killed in Malibu CA in a C-150 when I almost hit the water....  This could all be done with AI too, so choose your medicine.
@NitroMidgets WIG?  My airplane is designed to "trim to height" like a WIG, but fly normally.  I studied it and I think I  can get it to trim to height so I can skim above water without hitting water with hands free.  A Cessna/cub/Piper type will pitch nose down (-CM) as it gets closer.
@NickTrebla Engine has heaters to maintain temps at 1200k during shut down or to run on electricity via thermal cycle.  This allows cold winter starts where one motor is kept above 32 F and then wakes up other motors with electric heat, then combustion is possible.  Small area only heated.
@NickTrebla Auto ignition for NH3 is 930k but the reactions will delay it by 5 times until it gets to 1200K or hotter.  This is why old engines won't work well without mixing.  To get 100 % zero carbon, it has to work on only NH3 and no NOx.  Hence the 1500k top limit and 1200k bottom....
@NickTrebla No, whatever fuel mix is in the tank is the fuel.  Mixing fuels is key.  The hard thing is NH3 by itself.  The ignition needs to be 1200K for NH3, not 480k for Diesel and in between for other fuels.  The worst case is NH3.  Has to be isothermal burn between 1200k and 1500k...
The key with low weight is HIGH crash protection.  I was the first guy to do passenger side airbags at the largest airbags company in the world.  Airbags WON'T work!  Must be able to hit wall at 70 mph barrier, not 35 mph due to weight differences.  My car/seaplane has this....
The SHAPE of cars MUST change to get mega high fuel economy like 400 mpg H, 800 city, perhaps twice...folks, these are real numbers with this technology, especially when you add in ACTIVE DRAG REDUCTION not enabled by electrics.  At $1/gal and 400 mpg, that is 1/4 c/mile fuel.
If I make a car like my tandem 5 place without wings (take wings off), it will be 33 inches wide in cabin and can park two cars in one parking spot.  Wheels retract to allow this....  Shape has about .25-.16 of the aero drag.  Weight 1500 lbs vs 6000.  400 mpg highway, 800 city?
The reason this technology will ALWAYS be MORE efficient is the lower weight, active drag reduction, and 100% braking recovery.  Electric cars are heavy, only have 25-50% brake recovery, and no active drag reductions.  		I estimate 200 mpg for these factors vs Electric 100 mpg e. https://t.co/3BwcJVBGdO
If both cars were charged by the same electrical supply at rate X, with no road tax and no battery costs considered, the cost ratio would be:		Cost to make NH3 = 1.1-1.5 depending on efficiency of NH3 maker.		X * 1.1/2= .55X  &gt;&gt; X * 1.5/2 = .75  &gt;&gt; .55-.75 X		X for electric car
@NitroMidgets Concept stage.  No patents yet.  Looking to get team to get it done faster.  I am only stating what is possible.  Not in TX.  I did do wind tunnel tests once at T A&amp;M (see avatar).  		Do you have questions?  		This is NOT an old Diesel/Otto/rotary/Duke/Junkers/Scuderi type engine
If you paid no road tax in either car (case now with current laws with tax on fuel), my car would be $1/gal e on NH3 and 200 mpg, and electric car would be $4/gal  electricity (no battery costs included) and 100 mpg.  2 x 4 = 8:1.   8 times more for electric car w no road tax.
My engine in new car would be 200 mpg on $1/gal e NH3.   Road tax at 2 c/mile would be $4/gal.  $5/gal total....  5/200= .025 = 2.5 c/mile.  		Compare: electric car vs old gas car at 10 c/mile?  10/2.5 = 4.  		With gasoline at pump.  $2.3/200=0.0115 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10/1.15=8.7
Right now electric cars are $8/gal electricity plus battery and get 100 mpg e, plus $2/gal e for road tax (2 c/mile).  $10/ gal e/100 mpg e= 10 c/mile.		Gasoline is 2.3/gallon (with road tax).  $2.3/gal/ 23 mpg = 10 c/mile.		They are the same cost in fuel.  Each has hassles....
So, a 5 times cost premium for Electric cars, plus 2x in city during cold/hot days makes 10:1.  If I made a new car the economy would be twice due to lower drag and weight.  2x. 		5 x 2 x 2 = 20:1 more for Electric car in city.  This is the potential of this technology.  20 to 1.
People will think they can buy an electric car and save money, but will  receive a massive rude awakening when electricity goes way up to 30  c/kwh and road taxes kick in.  $14/gal e (10 electricity, 2 road tax, 4 battery).   With my engine, costs will go down ($1+2/gal). 16/3=5.
What will happen is more cars will be driven by electric and coal.  With my engine, the CO2 will be 1/6th to 1/3.  By enabling my engine, oil companies can maintain cash flows for many years and the disruptions will be smooth and transition easy.  This engine could last 50+ years
Note to oil company people.  If I can figure out how to zero out oil, then other people will soon after.  The key is a smooth transition and getting all people able to have power.  Oil will play part if my engine is enabled.  If not, you are bankrupt and costs are massive.
I made a comment on this video.  If people want to get the CO2 out, then this engine is the best way.  If you just want to be independent, this engine is the only way I know of.  Either way, energy is cheaper with this engine.  No fears...just help out...		https://t.co/pj2Wn3I4hA
Why not just use a fuel cell?  It only provides current and is not able to use many fuel, poor in varies loads, needs inverter (poor quality AC) and more.  My engine can run your house while parked, or torque a wheel in drive. 100% brake recovery.  Not so with Electrics.
So, why then no cost effective stand alone?  Because they all need back up generators.  What is wrong with a back up generator you ask?  Cost, noise/sound, longevity, high fuel consumption, poor frequency and voltage control, etc.  In contrast, my engine solves these, and more.
@Barracuda_Bella Bernie is unsafe at any speed.
@NickTrebla No, I prefer to start a conversation.  The point is to find people I can work with.  I don't have patents and therefore prefer to avoid stuff on the internet. The tweets are a log of my progress.  Do you have a question?
@SylviaD32911201 The underlying premise is that inverter based low quality intermittent power has value to it?  It does if you can make NH3 fuel from it.  Maybe 1.5 c/kwh?  All "renewables" should be off grid.  Not fair competition apples to apples.  Or they come with 24.7/365 ability.
If power can be made for 2 c/kwh with frequency and voltage control and 24/7,how is it that the cost of electricity is 30 cent/kwh in Germany and EU?  Scam!  All that money is theft above about 9 c/kwh.  7 transmission and 2 production = 9.  Grid is like government....scam.
Most of the solar PV panels are sold on the basis of saving you on electric bill and having the means to generate your own electricity.  Total fraud!  If it were true you would not need the grid.  At some point the grid will go belly up when people don't pay for the real value.&gt;
Renewable energy technology is like a 30 year old in his parents basement who can't live on his/her own.  These "renewable" energy systems rely on the grid to even work, let alone be of any value at all.  None are stand alone like an adult is.  All just children in old bodies.
If humans were designed like a Tesla or typical electric car they would have long ago been extinct.  No viable animal lives on one type of "food" to maintain energy.  Tesla is a single fuel system, just like socialism is a single ideology system.  Comply or you are "turned off."
Unless you are being bated and the game switched.  Going to electric cars does not allow you to "get out of town" when the "stuff hits the fan" as it were.  Your dream boat just became a boat anchor when it matters.  Independence minded people know the grid is big brother....&gt;
Why would getting to zero carbon be a 49 trillion dollar cost?  Is the nation full of idiots, incompetents, fake engineers?  Real solutions COST LESS and don't require slave labor like solar panels do.  Nor do they require insane complexity that nobody can work on....UNLESS....&gt;
I show the numbers that my engine in a Tesla (tear out the electric stuff) would be 2-16 times less costs.  Notice that nothing Tesla offers can get us to less than grid for real world stand alone apps.  Why is that?  They have the money to hire the people.  Why can't they?
Notice that my motivation is to get a system that can be stand alone, yet be connected to grid if wanted at lower than grid prices.  After 30 years nobody has figured out how to make off grid cheaper than on grid?  Serious?  How can that be?  Fake engineering?  What gives?  Why?
Notice now they are claiming that solar is now below grid prices, and in the same breath state that transmission fees are 7 cent/kwh.  If your solar is 5 c and transmission is 7c, then that make 12 cents/kwh.  An independent solar system does not exist for 3-4 times more.  Why?
I find it interesting that even after investing trillions of $$$ not one system is stand alone, 24/7, 365 day in year for less than grid?  How could that be if they had the CUSTOMER in mind?  Maybe they have grid owners in mind and NOT you.  Maybe you should wake up?
Yes, we need to know who is backing AOC.  Follow the money.  Either way, my engine can get us free from this scam of CO2. https://t.co/rgKc8YYJr5
@ThomasPaine5 It is handled like propane.  The pump connection does not allow any to escape, just like with Natural Gas or propane.
This is good.  Why is it so hard to figure out what the truth is?  CO2 is not an issue.  Getting independent from crazy "green" plan is the key.		https://t.co/zgzVRXRsWp
I have noticed that NOT ONE "green new deal" person will even discuss what I propose, let alone help out in any way.  I do the math for you all to see, but not one will ask a question or discuss intelligently how to get to zero carbon.  Telling. https://t.co/URzEM5Ca0l
Do you notice that the "green" plan has to have us all go along with their plan to make it work?  This is a characteristic of socialism.  Change the world!  How about changing yourself and getting to zero carbon in your house, car, airplane, and then we can suggest it to others.
@Ch4rlieT4ngo Talmud is in Surrah 5:32.  How did that nonsense get into the Koran.  Maybe a rabbi wrote it?  Just saying....
Folks, if you want to get to zero carbon, this is the only place I know of that has a valid concept to do it other than pure nuclear, which would be grid based.  The problem with nuclear is I can't get independent, but it can at least provide a stable grid for others, and NH3.
I don't understand why they can't see that people will be off grid long before their wet dream of a zero fuel 100% renewable grid is put in place.  It ain't going to happen.  The grid will collapse long before, all the while using much more CO2 than what I propose by up to 6x...&gt;
Whether the WWS plan is done or not, my engine can save you 75% on fuel and potentially give you 200 mpg highway economy and 400 mpg city, or about 300 mpg on average, or in other words, over 12 times better than that old Buick.  Any when you go NH3 at 1/2 fuel cost...24:1
@ThomasPaine5 No leaks?
@moosemuffinn This explains why it won't work.  		https://t.co/5wb1cLaqEj
In road map to nowhere, I quote: "Relying on a fuel-free, weather-dependent grid, with virtually no  overbuild, backup or storage, is a recipe for national disaster. And the price tag for a WWS grid with adequate overbuild, backup and storage is a recipe for national bankruptcy."
If WWS (wind, water, solar) only is what people are after, all I can say is forget it.  Won't work.  Not needed.  Not wanted.  Go away with such stupid ideas.  Learn to engineer.  Grow up.  Lock them up.  What else should one say to someone so insane as to want to do this. https://t.co/DwRI5QfvbA
An oil company could transition from oil to NH3 production with my engine in a seamless transition of complementary core competencies.  If not, then they can just be blown out of business by the new wave of electric cars that actually will increase CO2.
If I were a CEO of an airplane company, I would want to know about my engine as it offers many advantages over electric motor systems for distributed power applications, such as drones.  A new generation of airplanes can be  possible with this engine, but not with electrics...
If I were an oil company owner, I would want to know about this engine and invest in it.  Why?  Because it can allow you to transition and reposition assets to avoid having "stranded" assets that eventually bankrupt your company.  The low carbon path is NOT electric cars!
Notice that using fossil fuels (OIL) can actually be the LOWEST CO2 path to zero carbon.  NH3 can even make sense via Natural Gas and making NH3 by electricity.  The key is a smooth and low cost transition to zero carbon.  An electric car is just MORE carbon now, and toxic. https://t.co/kMl6bt5kNC
@ShaferCatrina My engine package can be hidden in a wing for "distributed" power done correctly.  Most of the examples have many flaws I can explain if you like.  The Stanford Blended wing body is a Mirage and is not something I would spend money on.  Door to door with no runway or no go....
@ShaferCatrina The key they are missing is you have to eliminate the runway.  Blown wing and Power on lift is key and none of the examples have it.  See x-57 from NASA.  They made a LOT of mistakes, but they at least understand blown wing.  My avatar is a "blended wing" lifting body of sorts.
@ShaferCatrina @Blackstone_BSX @A_Milewski @ConversationUS NH3 IS the battery for much cheaper and months (years?) of storage.  		One engine handles it all for non interrupted power for servers that need to not drop 1/2 sine wave.  The engine is by nature a micro grid to itself with spin and redundancy.  I can save people A LOT of money.
@ShaferCatrina Yes, the push is to EV.  My point is that there is a better way with more advantages, and a better path to zero carbon via NH3 and renewable sources, yet still allow Jet A, gasoline, Diesel, bio, 100 LL propane, Ethanol, etc. during the transition to 100% zero Carbon, if desired.
@ShaferCatrina Yes, I can see AI will be needed in new vehicles.  Same in roadable airplanes.  Flying semi trucks.  My view is also in context of grid and how to get to zero carbon and/or independent energy for the private person. My system will be able to run for many months without sun/wind
@ShaferCatrina I don't do LinkedIn.  seaplaneguy@msn.com  or seaplaneguy@protonmail.com
@ShaferCatrina Flying requires range and low weight.  My engine is better than electric motors in many ways, and without it, certain types of low cost vehicles are not possible.  Remember, this engine is born out of the needs of a roadable airplane that allows door to door at up to 400 mph.
@ShaferCatrina This S curve for cars is already over.  Flying can be cheaper than driving.  In fact, the tires, brakes, and road tax cost more than the fuel at 200 mph, which mean if you fly, the fuel is "free" as it were.  Roads are NOT safe, not fun, mostly congested, slow, and very risky.
@ShaferCatrina There is an easy way to make a zero traffic system, but not with what is proposed.  It can be door to door, owned, rented out, and needs minimal AI.  There are much better options, but only a few well connected people with Agenda's get to control it all.  Not a market system.
@ShaferCatrina Cat, I understand you only see what "IC" engines are NOW.  You don't know what I am working on.  My motors don't have 200 moving parts.  This is not your granddad's Buick or Peterbuilt.  Again, it is 4-32 times less cost than Tesla....
Clearly, the proposed nightmare "grid" will not work until 2050 and well over 15 trillion, all the while needing carbon fuels like training wheels to get up to speed.  You actually need to predict weather to make this silly plan work.  Who are these idiots?  All not needed!!! https://t.co/DwRI5QfvbA
@ShaferCatrina There are millions of parts moving (vibrating) constantly all needed to be connected by a huge central planning AI robot that makes you a "passenger" who makes no decisions, has no responsibility, controls nothing and experiences no joy or pain.  Sounds like hell....
@ShaferCatrina Yes, I understand that.  They become the landlords and you own nothing, paying rent for everything, having to ask permission to go anywhere, do anything, haul anything and on and on.  We all become slaves to their profits.  Sounds great....NOT.  18 moving parts?  ...&gt;
Here is another view point.  They think nuclear is required to go zero carbon.  Why?  NH3 is the key....		https://t.co/5wb1cLaqEj
Notice that he still has natural gas at 2050.  Why?  Because he does not have the right stuff...  He does make some good points, but misses the mark....		https://t.co/f79xQloe3Z
The ENTIRE auto industry and Tesla are assuming that combustion requires carbon fuels and that nobody can figure out how to make a 60-75% efficient engine, let alone run it on NH3 and old fuels.  Otherwise they would be doing as I suggest. Electro-fuels are key...
Notice in the PDF link that China has 974 g CO2/kwh for grid.  Run electric car at 75% and you have 974/.75=1299.  		1299/203 = 6.39 MORE for electric car vs new on gasoline .	1299/268 = 4.84 MORE for electric car vs new on NH3 		Maybe they really want to INCREASE CO2!  Insane...
The "grid electric car" was based on 454, not 547 actual.  So the figure is 729, NOT 605		That makes the ratio 729/203=3.6 times MORE CO2 running grid electric vs new car on gasoline.		On NH3 vis Nat Gas?  729/268=2.72 x.		Summary:  Electric car is 2.72-3.6 x MORE CO2 than new. https://t.co/pcnw37LXS2
According to this USA is 547 g CO2/kwh, not 454 which another study say.  547/.75=729.  I stated 605 below.  Much better than I thought.		https://t.co/QZyXNIruJa
If you ran your electric car on Nat Gas:  181.5/.62=292 /.75 = 390.  		My new car with new engine would be 268 via NH3 made by Nat Gas electricity.  		This is a fair apples to apples comparison of new car to new electric car. 		New car ALWAYS less than electric in CO2 and energy.
Notice below that my new car on gasoline is ~ 1/3 the CO2 of an electric car on USA grid...best case.  It is 605/268 = 2.25 x less running on NH3 made by Nat Gas via combined cycle and electricity.  Bottom line is my engine less CO2 than an electric car by 2.25-3x vs grid.
Below I show that making NH3 via Nat Gas combined cycle (62%) and using in my engine in old or new car is less than electric cars from grid as follows:  		Grid electric car=605	Old car new engine on NH3 = 536	New car new engine on NH3 = 268	New car new engine on gasoline =203
Compare gasoline vs grid NG:		old car 13.5%=243.5/.135=1803	new engine, old car, 60%=243.5/.6=405.8;  	New car 2x economy: 405.8/2=202.9		Make NH3 w NG (62%).  Use NH3 cars.  	181.5/.62 x 1.1=322 for NH3.	Old car=322/06=536  	New car (2x mpg)=536/2=268 	Electric grid: 454/.75=605 https://t.co/43r9z1f354
If I put my engine in a glider pod the power would be around 3 hp at 80 mph.  It would take about 3-4 gallon of gasoline to do the 2400 miles to Hawaii.  At $1/gal e NH3 that would be $3-4 and 12 gallons NH3.  		About 120 kwh.  = $28 with battery and electricity. 7 times more....
What would an electric airplane costs?  Hmmm.  Range?  200 miles, maybe.  It would have to be a glider pod thing.  Useful?  NO!  Can't land on roads or park in garage.  Zero carbon?  If PV, yes, but if grid, about like Nat Gas.  Charge time?  Very long.  Speed?  80 mph?
So, if you wanted to be "green" and fuel up with 133 gallons of NH3, the cruise speed of 145 mph would get you from San Francisco to Hawaii in 16.5-17 hrs.  Will need to be able to stand up for sure and use toilet in back.  Doable....  Less than $100 round trip, zero carbon.
NH3 is 75% of the weight of gasoline/gallon.  A 133 gallon tank of NH3 would give the same weight at 100 gallons of gasoline, and 44.33 gal equiv to gasoline.  2400 miles at 145 mph would get 2400 miles range on NH3 with 133 gal NH3.  Cost would be $45 in fuel at $1/gal e one way
At 12k feet and 200 mph, range on gasoline is 2800 mile or basically anywhere in the USA and San Fran to Hawaii with 400 to spare.  With gasoline at $2.5/gal, fuel cost would be 8.3 c/mile or $16.6/hr x 12 hrs.  = $200 in fuel each way, $400 round trip.
Full power at 12,000 feet is 300 mph.  Fuel cost 7.5 c/mile on $1/gal e NH3.  Range 200 miles with 100 gallons NH3.  With gasoline 600 miles.  Go to 25k feet and 300 mph and range is 1800 miles.  Slow to 265 mph and range is 2400 miles on gasoline. Hawaii. 200 mph, 25k ft? 4400m.
How much can you make in ground taxi?  $2/mile at 25 mph = $50/hr.  If airplane charged $2/mile that would be $400/hr.  If I can get you there at 8 times faster and 1/2 cost, why would you drive?  This can be AI just like a car can, btw.  And with NH3 it can be ZERO carbon flying
If the air taxi could take 5 people, two couples and pilot, and each per  person were 25 cent/mile, the airplane would make $560,000/year gross.   I can see $500,000 /year with two pilots after airplane costs of $60k.   Clearly taxi rates could be 1/2 and still be good money.
If you flew an air taxi airplane with two pilots, it would fly 2800 hrs/year.  At 200 mph average = 560,000 miles/year, or 280,000 miles each pilot.  At 50 c/mile, minus 5 c/mile fuel and 5 for airplane, that would be $112,000/year each.  More  than any taxi driver would make!
Why tandem seating in air taxi?  Side by side is too intimate for strangers.  Tandem gives you 33 wide x 36 L x 48+ high space you can isolate yourself from other ride share persons you don't know.  Buy a space on airplane.  Have window on each side, and air temp and Ipad =Chill.
Tony Seba talks about taking over an industry from above.  My seaplane can do just that...literally and figuratively.  Seaplane = car + wings.  As car, 300 mpg e highway and 600 mpg e city.  4 place tandem for 2x side by side parking and air taxi.  Car perfect for inner city.
If Tony Seba is correct about electric cars and the S curve, won't flying cars be the future also?  My seaplane with new engine will allow flying to be cheaper than driving at well over 200 mph, even 400 mph if you wanted to be fair.  Why be on ground?  Battery too heavy/costly.
As I have shows here many times, flying is the future.  Just as making your own electricity without the grid is cheaper than grid power, flying will be cheaper than driving on roads, but NOT with BATTERY due to range and weight.  Why make a car when you can fly door to door?
If you add in tires at 2 c/mile to the 4.5 c/mile you get 6.5 c/mile.  At 280 mph you get the same costs.  		If you assume real worst case Tesla Roadster costs of 10 cent/mile, plus 2 for tires, you get 12 c/mile.  Fly 380 mph... at 12,000 feet.  469 mph at 25k feet.
My seaplane at 234 mph would use 4.5 c/mile in fuel at $1/gal e of NH3 from house.  A Tesla roadster would be around 45 mph.  234/45=5.2.  Fly 5.2 times faster for same fuel costs.  Reality is city driving is 25 mph.  234/25=9.36 x faster.  Save 15% in distance by flying. 10.76 x
Worst case: 		The real cost of solar PV is 15 c/kwh.  	Road tax on Tesla Roaster would be 17.  	Battery use 12.  	Total = 15+17+12=$44c/kwh.  = $14.83/gal e if you are fair.  /144 mpge = 10 cent/mile.  		Best case: 15/3 + 17/2 + 12/2= 19.5 c/kwh...= $6.57/gal e/144 = 4.5 c/mile.
If the road tax should be 17 c/kwh for a Tesla roadster and PV panel is 5 cents (actually 15 c/kwh, but lets follow the claims) that make tax and fuel 22 c/kwh.  Add in 12 cent/kwh for battery use and you have 34 c/kwh.  Notice 17 (road tax) is 1/2 of 34.  34x33.7 = $11.46/gal e.
Road tax is about 1/2 the rate it should be.  Real rate is about 4 c/mile. 100 mpg e =$4/gal e tax=12 cent/kwh.  If the electric car gets 200 mpg in city, then tax should be $8/gal e while in city.  Tesla Roadster gets 144 mpg e?  4x1.44=$5.76/gal e =17 c/kwh.  Solar 5? =22 c/kwh
If you go from 25 mpg to 100 mpg, the fuel tax has to go up by 4 x to cover the cost of roads.  If the car gets 100 mpge, it requires an electricity tax cost of 6 c/kwh.  At 2 cents/mile, fuel tax is $2/gal e.  $2/33.7=$0.06/kwh.  Real tax to cover road costs should be twice that
The same thing happens with the grid "tax" or costs as it does the road tax or use tax.  Once the cost of fuel gets low enough and the efficiency high enough, the "road tax" of grid or road becomes a large fraction of costs, whereas before fuel/electricity is a small fraction.
If the grid is 6 c/kwh and the value of intermittent electricity is 2 c/kwh, total would be 8 c/kwh....x 37=$2.96/gal e.  If the cost of wind or PV is 5 c/kwh and grid = 6 that makes $11 c/kwh.  x 37= $4/gal e.  At 5 without grid?  $1.85/gal e.  Remove grid, make at home, good...
The problem with any grid based NH3 transfer or credit is, again, the cost of transmission, which some say is 6-7 c/kwh, which destroys the market for remote made NH3 and credits.  1.1 x 33.7 = 37.  times this by electricity cost and you get gal e cost.  $0.02 x 37=$0.74 c/gal e.
Here is an idea.  If everybody has PV panels, the value of electricity during the day would go to zero.  That electricity could go to making NH3 instead of being turned off.  The credit would go to a company and PV owner would get back a certain credit for NH3 they buy locally.
@rob_omgwtf Ask Elon?  		1) I don't know him	2) Already tweeted him many times	3) He does not want a combustion engine even if it can run on a battery via thermal heating or use NH3 made from electricity	4) He is not interested in roadable seaplanes, and therefore does not care about weight
So, after watching all these different points of view, I am convinced my engine will work, but the problem is political.  The CO2 is ideological and distorts any real solutions that are cost effective.  The question is whether I have to do this all alone or can get help.

The cost of conserving is 3 c/kwh.  Building solar then becomes cheaper than upgrading house.  This is what I have been saying. https://t.co/vnK4Xj71oB
Wow, the cost for four proposed nuclear plants is 12, 14, 15 18 c/kwh, whereas new solar is 2.5 c/kwh.  4.8-7.2 times more.  If you use NH3, the power would be constant in engines/cars on demand.  Solar seems to be the end game, just like I have been thinking for years. https://t.co/4dC5rhAHPd

How do you charge your car without a grid?  Think about it...  Where is the electricity going to come from when there is no grid?  Just curious....  Wind and solar farms require grids, but if grid is 7 c/kwh and wind/solar 5 to make, then that is 12 c/kwh = $4/gal.  Explain???
Why do people focus on only electrical bills?  Perhaps because the costs have tripled via "renewable" theft and driven costs to 30-40 c/kwh.  What about water and sewer?  Why not that?  Why not focus on getting rid of all grids?  Not in their expertise?  How to fund R&amp;D?  Rip off
So, according to talks below, the world is going to go EV and we are all going to make our own electricity and run our cars from it.  No grid.  Where do we charge up with no grid?  How can a place have enough power via solar if no grid exists?  Grid costs will be 30-50 c/kwh, no?
Green?  China needs a green revolution.  Burning fuels on road looking last century.  Diesel trucks?  Batteries are the future according to him.  100 EU tax to run truck 100 KM on Swiss roads!  Tax them to rail!  Sea transit cheap.  He forgot flying! https://t.co/Drt9keARmq

The actual cost of transmission is 1 c/kwh, not 7.  That 7 is part of the corruption within the monopoly company.  Add in batteries and generators guys, and then you have reality. https://t.co/72aL2XMTPC
According to this guy, central power is over when transmission costs more than the solar.  This is classic misunderstanding of what stand alone solar offers.  The value is 1.5 c/kwh, not 7 or 10 it gets now with subsidies.  More to it than this.		https://t.co/EUWPvU0b0Z
My engine can unplug this shift if given some support. How?  Flying.  Batteries cannot compete in costs and weight.  My airplane could replace the car with a S curve that eliminates road taxi service as he thinks will occur.  Flying cheaper than driving!		https://t.co/YiUtUvd569
@rob_omgwtf The higher efficiency also make it par to electric cars and therefore removes the incentive to go electric in cars with all the toxic battery nonsense.  NH3 IS the battery.  This then allows airplanes to run on NH3 with long range whereas with batteries airplanes are a joke.
@rob_omgwtf New engine is really required to be 100% NH3.  Yes you can use old and mix fuels, but the key is the 60-75% efficiency vs 10-20% in current Otto engines.  The higher efficiency cuts the fuel volume demand by 1/3 and therefore allows nearly the same range with the same volume.
Bill points out the intermittency of solar and wind.  That is solved by NH3.  You take them off the grid and only have them make NH3.		https://t.co/ofCeaasxFj

If you ban combustion, you ban NH3, the key to low cost zero carbon.  You also make all current engines, processes and means also void of value.  This slows progress towards zero carbon.  Combustion is the KEY to zero carbon, not the enemy of zero carbon.
Electro-chemicals allow devices or processes that need certain chemicals to function without using oil.  Volume production is key.  		If you BAN COMBUSTION, you also ban the market for many electro-chemicals that can be enabled by nuclear and/or wind/solar.  Jet  A, for example. https://t.co/8oP8aBvwfU
To get to zero carbon you need to be able to MAKE all the needed fuels used by industry and do it via electro-chemicals, thus being zero carbon/or neutral.  		Nuclear or wind/solar can provide the needed electricity to make the electricity to make the needed chemicals.
Some of the many benefits of NH3:		1) only 1.1 extra over electricity.  ~like charging battery.	2) low weight	3) low fire hazard	4) charge/make elsewhere	5) flow of fuel, not solid	6) works with other fuels	7) No toxic mining	8) fertilizer and feed stock to plastics	9) storage https://t.co/B4rUzwaOdH
Some of the many problems with electric cars:		1) retail electricity is expensive.  (Retail solar is too.)	2) bat expensive	3) bat heavy	4) bat Fire hazard (fuel and oxidizer in one container)	5) slow to charge	6) hard to charge away from car	7) poor thermal	8) many failure modes

With a carbon fuel, it does not make sense to make NH3, a non carbon fuel.  You just make more CO2.  The only ways to make NH3 zero carbon is wind/solar/geo or nuclear.  Mobile apps need fuels to be high energy, low weight and low volume.  NH3 is not ideal, but easy to make...&gt; https://t.co/0rk265rcXa
Bill hits them hard.  My engine system will do it.  Read tweets below and see...		https://t.co/nIcVCuumfJ
You will not find this vision anywhere on the internet except here.  Read the tweets and see the future of energy.  No need to panic.  Plenty of time to get the CO2 out if that is your goal (not mine).  Energy will be very cheap, and allow many options.  Old equipment will be ok.
So, to get to zero carbon ASAP, please read the tweets below.  This is all doable.  Banning combustion will just be insanely stupid and slow progress.  Electric cars are more CO2 and energy and will be so ALWAYS, as I tweet here.  Stop being ignorant and read my sweet tweets....
If you ban combustion, an old airplane orcar becomes junk.  With my engine, I can replace the old engine and the person can get 2.4-3 x better fuel economy.  He then can use electro-fuels or old fuels where available and save fuel (3x) and costs ($5/gal 100 LL vs $2 electro-fuel)
Politically, banning combustion will cause a massive hate for carbon zero technologies and void the value of assets.  This cannot be forced.  It must be lower cost.  Electro-fuels can be lower costs than oil based fuels when electricity is low cost, as I show below.
Building new cars and tractors uses a lot of energy.  By using electro-fuels you save the energy (CO2) needed to make a piece of equipment that seldom gets used but is needed.  Banning combustion forces the old to be junk and thus raises CO2 by needing new equipment.
A carbon tax would also decrease incentives for electro fuels and make it very confusing from a use stand point.  It would distort the market against old equipment, thus raising costs and delaying purchase of other equipment that could lower CO2.  Why build a seldom used tractor?
By banning combustion it kills the incentive to make electro fuels in volume that are carbon neutral.  These fuels are NEEDED in certain manufacturing processes and equipment that electricity cannot enable.  Thus, banning combustion, INCREASES Carbon and delays time to zero C.
The idea of banning combustion kills investment in real solutions to zero carbon.  It bans electro-fuels that are helpful in airplanes for long range.  It reduces the incentive to buy my new engine to get 4x economy and forces people to use the grid that is full of carbon.
As you can see below, there would be NO reason to ban any combustion vehicles and still get to zero carbon via electro fuels.  Old airplanes could use electro-fuels and be 100% zero carbon if desired.  Again, let the markets develop.  Don't ban fossil fuels.  Let them compete.
By innovations in electro-fuels, old vehicles can still be used.  The cost of the fuel would likely be higher than other NH3 or fossil fuels, but it will give people a zero carbon option.  At some point NH3, electro-fuels and electricity would dominate over oil based fuels.
The future of energy might have many types of fuels		1) fossil fuels, gasoline, Diesel, propane, Jet A, 100 LL, 	2) NH3 	3) Carbon electro-fuels made by electricity.	4) electricity		My engine could use all.  Old vehicles will still work on electro-fules, and be able to be zero C
Fossil fuels will take many years to be competed out by lower cost NH3.  Old cars and trucks will still need to use the gasoline/Diesel fuels.  Soon, electro-chemical Carbon fuels can also be part of the mix, thus allowing higher energy density for jet fuels, and use of old, etc.
How then does my engine fit into this new grid with NH3?  It is central to it because it can use NH3 and 5 other fuels, thus allowing owners to use lower cost fuel when NH3 supplies are low.   It will take time to develop NH3 markets and fossil fuels will compete against NH3...&gt;
Constant devices can store large amounts of NH3 and sell it when wind/solar fails to produce the needed supply of NH3 required to run vehicles during long winters..  This provides a revenue source outside of the grid and time shifting of grid loads to high demand times/seasons.
All variable machines are then not needed on the grid.  Only constant devices and NH3 as the variable.  Many large plants can be used and temporary excess supply from constant devices absorbed in the storage of NH3, which can be sold later at higher prices when demand spikes.
Intermittent sources like wind and solar should be independent from the grid and make NH3 for use in vehicles where oil is now used.  Thus, they compete with oil as well as the grid via the NH3 made by excess power on the grid.  Simplify the grid with only constant and NH3....&gt;
Constant power devices compete against constant power devices.		Intermediate devices like wind and solar compete with constant grid devices like Nuclear, Coal and Nat Gas combined cycle via NH3 and not via the grid.  The true value of intermediate is in NH3, not grid.
The problem is that each of the suppliers have large fixed costs and  long investment periods.  They will not be willing to be up and down on  price, nor risk shut-down due to clean up end costs.  This then forces long term contracts and voids potential innovation in lower costs.
Whether you use Nuclear, Coal, or Natural Gas (combined cycle), NH3 should be the the throttle to take up demand between supply and grid instantaneous demand.  Each should be able to provide power at a constant power and compete, with NH3 taking up the load variance.
Fuel/power go up as power gets less, and cost of capital (interest) is still the same regardless of power output.  A device making no power costs the same payments as one that is full power.  How then to run the grid and get competition and zero carbon?  Nuclear in excess + NH3.
A variable device can run at partial power.  If it runs at 1/2 power, do you give it a premium for the unused capacity?  Costs for fuel to run a device at low power go up per unit power.  A PW 6A turbo, for example, uses 2x fuel/power at 1/3 power and wear is close to full power.
I can have competition between two devices that are both constant or both variable, but not one that is constant and one that is variable.  This is the central problem of the grid now.  Who gets to make money and at what price?  Cheapest is always at full power, not partial.
....Unless a variable demand were enabled that was in the control of the grid operator or some price signalling.  		By dividing up the grid in constant and variable modes you can compete with common values.  A constant device next to a variable device is not apples to apples.
Back to the four issues below.  		Each has a value.  The grid does not price the value or lack thereof and thus a true market cannot be had on the grid.  A variable device with reserve capacity is valuable in a variable demand world.  Without it, the grid would stop, unless..&gt; https://t.co/vJQTCZkS50
Think of NH3 as a liquid battery you can pump into your car quickly.  		Think of Li-ion as a solid battery that has to be part of the car to charge, or that must be exchanged with another battery to use the car while charging.  		Both take time to "charge" before use.
The entire concept of electric cars is silly at best and will fail the company that does it.  Why?  Flow.  Liquids flow.  Batteries do not.  Time = money.  The storage means has to "charge" out of sight, out of mind.  Removing a battery is not valid.  Removing/filling a fuel is.
A battery has a massive (pun intended) disadvantage versus NH3 due to the solid vs liquid nature of the storage means.  Battery is solid.  NH3 is liquid.  One is heavy to move.  One can be pumped and no loading is needed.  Liquid is much better than solid for energy due to flow.
The charger and battery or fuel maker and fuel  needs to be separate from the car so that the slow process of "charging" can be done while the car is being used.  Making NH3 takes time and is like charging a battery.  It is limited by current and size, just like a battery.
Why were some thinking about exchanging out a battery?  Because it takes time to charge a battery.  Time = money.  Charge the battery on a simple stand and let the rest of the car do something valuable.  NH3 does this inherently.  The fuel maker is a charger.  The NH3 = battery.
What is the true cost of an electric cars?  That depends on how much your time is worth and how much the sitting car's time is worth.  If you have an AI car that can make money while driving around, it can't while charging.  Silly concept!  Time = money.  This is why NH3 is KEY!
If you have two professional people at $50/hr sitting in Tesla car waiting to charge a car for 1 hour, it costs $100 in time.  80 kwh x $0.12 /kwh = $9.6 in fuel, but $100 in time.  Actual cost of electricity is 109.6/80= $1.37/kwh.  1.37/.12=11.4 = stupid silly nonsense ....&gt;
An electric car takes too long to charge and as such has an opportunity cost of time for the driver which vastly exceeds the cost of the "fuel" or electricity being absorbed.  NH3 is just like gasoline, quick and simple, in and out, with minimal time costs, unlike electric cars.
The nice thing about NH3 as a demand device is that it does not have tires, brakes, seats, insurance costs, that are not of note to grid services.  It is only a demand device and as such cheap to buy and use per demand use, unlike a car or smart appliance.  Key point!
By introducing NH3 as the variable demand, NO SMART GRID is needed and neither is expanded transmission capacity or variable devices.  Using cars as demand devices is absurd due to their nature as useless while unused as vehicle.  All the tires, brakes, motor etc are held captive
Current grids have many machines to deal with the variable demand.  Smart grid is a way to unload demand when supply is short.  Turning on and off power generation devices affects their efficiency and controlling customer's demand makes silly the concept of a on demand grid.
A constant power device (coal and nuclear) is not as flexible as a device that can vary in power from low to high.  When the variable device is running at low power, is it paid MORE per kwh?  It should due to fixed capital costs and reserve it has available as stand-by.
Below, I restricted grid to 100% nuclear, which is NOT needed.  		Two key issues		1) CONSTANT (base load) vs VARIABLE (any power setting) power	2) Intermittent vs on demand.  		Grid now has little to no price or value signals to these issues, therefore no market can exist.
With nuclear made NH3, nuclear can have electric cars as well as NH3 fuel driven cars.  This includes airplanes, trucks, boats, stand alone houses, factories and more.  The grid no longer is restrained by an extension cord like it is now.  Understand?
Nuclear then can compete against BIG OIL in a way it could not do via the grid.  NH3 and other electro-chemical fuels are the key to freeing Nuclear to do what it does best, namely, make cheap electricity.  This further competes with oil in feed-stocks of oil  and NG....&gt;
Once nuclear can be used for NH3 production as well as a grid source, they can expand into all the markets that oil now has via NH3.  This is HUUUUUGE for nuclear and would allow large volume manufacture of nuclear power plants and thus competition in nuclear power systems.
Depending on the price of fossil fuels, the price of NH3 would be ideally be supply and demand driven.  Wind/solar/and other renewables would MAKE NH3 and sell it as fuel.  The grid would do the same.  This would allow many times more nuclear power than just the grid!  Volume N.
If the entire grid were 100% nuclear and constant in power, the rate for retail would have to be set fixed as there is no competition, basically as it now is.  		The grid then can compete with all other NH3 makers and systems by making NH3 for general use.  Unlimited expansion!
At 9 c/kwh retail house rates, NH3 would cost $0.09 x 1.1 x 33.7 = $3.33/gal e.  A person could cut costs by using my engine + solar thermal + Thermal store + Nh3 maker to perhaps 55.5 cent/gal e or 6.66 times less.  That would be beastly indeed! (little humor here...)
The price of NH3 would then float from $0.75/gal e to $1.5/gal e for fuel without road tax. This would be LESS than industrial grid rates (5 c/kwh) and less than what a person can make NH3 from retail grid at 8-9 c/kwh.  This "spread" would allow house solar to work also.
With a fixed nuclear grid price set low at 8-9 c/kwh, the competition then becomes Nuclear to NH3 vs independent wind/solar to NH3.  This NH3 can be used in houses, cars, trucks, boats, airplane, factories and more.  At $1.68 /gal, that is ~ 5 c/kwh, which is industrial rates.
Wind from the Aleutian islands and eastern sea costs could make all the NH3 needed to supplement what nuclear power and private NH3 makers cannot provide as fuel to vehicles.  		Nuclear excess power to NH3 competes with Wind/solar to NH3.		Electrical grid price set at 8-9 c/kwh.
Cost of wind, for example, is driven by the cost of the transmission.  By uncoupling from grid and making NH3 only, the wind can be at least 1/2 cost of current.  No inverters would be needed also.  No grids either.  Make remotely, store in tanks, ship to markets.
Any variable and intermittent renewable sourcet needs to be "processed" or disciplined by going to NH3 as storage fuel for vehicles, which are intermittent.  This offline use of renewables allows them to be built for much less costs due to no need to conform to grid frequency.
Future grid:		1) 100% nuclear in excess	2) NH3 maker = throttle of variable loads	3) NO intermittent renewables on grid.	4) renewables offline for NH3 production only.	5) no turbine/Diesel/ or spin needed.	6) NH3 fuel for vehicles	7) no electric cars needed, but still able.
Either way, by shipping trucks at 2 c/kwh or via grid at 3 c/kwh, NH3 can be made for LESS than gasoline, thus allowing 100% replacement via LOWER priced zero carbon fuel NH3.  No need for carbon tax.  Just real price signals and value added given to NH3 production...&gt;
With electricity at plant at 2 cent/kwh for NH3 making, and 3 at local station for added "shipping" costs via grid, NH3 can be delivered at $0.03 x 1.1 x 33.7 = $1.11/gal e to fuel station.  Add fuel tax of$0 .45/gale and price is $1.56/gal e.  CO2 problem SOLVED for vehicles.
NH3 will add massive value to grid by making grid a single device nuclear power source that can run at constant power and thus lower costs.  NH3 then should be much lower in electricity costs than 5 cents/kwh.  Perhaps 2 c/kwh.  NH3 = 0.02 x 1.1 x 33.7 = $75/gal e.
Since NH3 will SAVE massive costs by eliminating turbines/Diesels/spin and more, the cost of electricity to make NH3 should be at special rates, thus allowing flexibility to compete with gasoline/Diesel fuels and be cheaper.  NH3 needs a price signal due to the large value...&gt;
When PV and wind are for NH3 making ONLY, the grid then becomes a single power source system of nuclear at excess levels.  NH3 absorbs excess and makes fuel at cheaper than gasoline ($1.5/gal e).  No turbines or Diesels are needed.  This saves massive amounts....&gt;
Again, this is how to ideally get to zero carbon.		Renewables make NH3 only.  This takes the junk power off line.  NO inverters.		Nuclear power is ABOVE peak evening load over base of x (base) at 1.5-2x of power.  		NH3 making is deals with x to 1.5x power variable in daily cycle
So, once again, the traditional people in anti-CO2 DON"T have a clue how to get to zero carbon.  NOT one video, of many, even mentions using 1.5-2X of base load power for a constant nuclear input with NH3 for variable.  Without this you still need turbines and Nat Gas.  WAKE UP!
In essence, with NH3, nuclear can have 2-3 times MORE power than as a traditional base load, and with NH3 NO turbines, Diesels, or Nat Gas are needed to maintain Voltage and frequency.  Just set at 1.5-2+ (depending on NH3 demand in vehicles) and let NH3 be the variable....&gt;
NH3 can be made and stored for weeks or months, whereas an electric car has to be charged on demand.  This then forces some fractional level of traditional base load, with turbines taking up base to peak loads.  This uses up NH3 for grid support and not car/truck/airplanes.
The nice thing about NH3 over electric cars is the storage nature of fuel and how NH3 then can allow a constant excess level of nuclear power that exceeds the peak load of grid.  If base load is X, peak load might be 1.5 x, and 0.5 difference can be in NH3 making.  Scheduling...&gt;
@Neonomide @ShellenbergerMD Ultimately, my original motive for the new engine is to make a blown wing and boundary layer control airplane that can land on roads and drive down road.  No need for car...  The engine can go into most anything and is modular, so track hoes, farm equipment, cars, trucks, all...
@Neonomide @ShellenbergerMD Don't get me wrong, nuclear would be ideal if CO2 is your thing.  I say CO2 is entirely beneficial, so my motive is NOT reduction of CO2, but in new engine that can get me "free fuel" via solar and NH3.  Fly for free...between engine overhauls.  Also has water harvest and distill
@Neonomide @ShellenbergerMD You make NH3 during spring, summer and fall, and use stored NH3 during long winters.  Cold climate is ok, including Alaska.  Make lots of NH3 during summer and have larger tanks for 6 months of NH3.  Engine goes in cars, truck, boats and my new roadable seaplane.  All doable.
@Neonomide @ShellenbergerMD New engine + NH3 and solar thermal.  NH3 made by large wind and solar too, and house/factory solar + NH3 and thermal store to bridge short term.  Engine can use 5 fossil fuels or bio fuels too if needed.  Engine gets 4x 200 mpg e vs electric at 100 mpge...2x.  End, zero carbon.
Nuclear a failed technology?  		https://t.co/FQLSwV6sL4
My engine with NH3 will work with BOTH nuclear and wind/solar. https://t.co/sRdGqiZ49e
pro or con nuclear?  		https://t.co/iItKWTVusB
Would you buy $2.4/gal e NH3 fuel (plus .45 tax) =$2.85/gal e NH3 that can run in car that gets 3-5 x better fuel economy.  Maybe, but not likely if you can buy gasoline for $2.35/gal.  		Solar thermal can make electricity for 1.5 c/kwh at plant.  Why not nuclear?  Coal now 1.8.
New nuclear ventures claim they can deliver electricity for 5 cents/kwh.  (time 13:00 on video)		0.05 x 1.1 x 33.7 = $1.85/gal e.  Plus marketing and such...1.3x =~$2.4 /gal e at pump, 80 c/gal NH3?  Might work.  My engine give 3-5 x economy boost...&gt;		https://t.co/QUijPZaTik
@ShellenbergerMD Should make excess nuclear and make NH3 to run in cars.  They don't understand this yet....
@ShellenbergerMD They need the NH3 energy path to cars to use all wind.
@ShellenbergerMD @telegraaf Excess nuclear + NH3 maker eliminates need for turbines and saves big money on idle turbines and Diesels.  Cars then use NH3 and can also use old fuels until NH3 can fully be made by Nuclear.
Yes, this is why NH3 maker needs to be the "throttle" to the grid with nuclear constant and much higher than peak loads.  Excess nuclear is made into NH3 that consumes the power when grid demands drops.  Not old base load, but above peak load (8pm).  NH3 is then sold to vehicles. https://t.co/DnGa0ppy7o
This video was good about history of nuclear fear.  Thanks @ShellenbergerMD  	Yes, fears of mothers.  3 mile. Melt down. Plant tied to bombs.  Imaginary fears.	https://t.co/310DEyhtaq
@ShellenbergerMD @Forbes Margret Thatcher worked for nuclear.  Coal was labor.  She  used CO2 as a way to get at coal.  Old hatred....
@ShellenbergerMD @Forbes Yes, 100% nuclear on grid with nuclear made NH3 would give zero carbon housing and transit, including airplanes.  With my engine you can get farms, heavy equipment, boats, trains, buses, fertilizer, some plastics and more...  Cement is not one though....
@ShellenbergerMD @FRANCE24 If you want zero carbon you can do it with Nuclear, but you need NH3 for all the rest of things.  Batteries and electric cars are not the solution.  My engine technology is with NH3 and 5 fuels.
@ShellenbergerMD Nuclear is fine, but not needed to get to zero carbon.  I tweet about it.  Happy to discuss.
@ShellenbergerMD I watched this video.  Sounds like Mike needs to have a conversation with me, if he is serious about CO2.  80% gone quick is possible after I am ready to produce engines.  90% with solar added, and then NH3 for 100%.  No worries.  		https://t.co/kBjyF4UJpC
$1 billion to invest?  My engine is the only one that will go big.  But after I get it going I won't need his money.  It will self fund from savings and trucks.  		Paths:  1) reduce grid of solar and wind with storage	2) Nat gas peakers and sequestration		https://t.co/eF6W13bgnP
Poor people pay more for electricity than rich due to grid...but not with my technology.  Diesel yes, but not mine.
Pricing of reliability.  Intermittent sources will look terrible.  Price value of storage properly.  We subsidize intermittent sources.  The subsidized price effect of wind and solar.  Paid to much for real value...just like I have been saying.  Solar/wind = 1.5 c/kwh, not 5.
Gates loves a carbon tax.  Grrrr.  Just slows my engine going into cars, which then slows NH3.  He does not like Nat gas due to high GHG factor.  50% reduction does nothing long term.  Computer innovation much easier than energy.  Rigged system.  Price of storage?  .....&gt;
..... 75 year?  Silly.  5 miracles?  Capture?  waste...  Nuke?  OK  		Energy factory (carbon and nuke) which is dense vs farming energy that is spread out.  He stated that renewable in market can go low in price at  generation time.  Yes!  Storage and transmission.  Fund R&amp;D?
@ThomasPaine5 The nice thing with roadable is you can move to where there is no fog and then take off.  At an airport you can get stuck there and can't takeoff due to lower than minimums.  Class G is zero zero, not so at airport.  Also by driving you make progress in direction of travel.
More Gates.  80% daunting.  No, it is not!  Need right solution, like mine.  Would NOT be hard to change due to my engine.  It could all go zero C in 1-10 years after I am ready to produce.  You buy engine or go out of business due to savings.  75 years?		https://t.co/lUpV2vfB5z?
@ThomasPaine5 This is all dependent on the aircraft.  I will need to have real world experience with landing on roads, low visibility over roads to see how practical, so I don't want to say too much.  The "grey" area of driving vs flying is where key factors of this design make it useful daily
@ThomasPaine5 You have to be 1000 feet over cities, 500 feet over spare areas.  1200 feet is above ground is top of class G uncontrolled.  If it is foggy or low visibility you can follow road without having to file IFR.  Gets worse, just land.  Getting an IFR clearance from my house...hard.
More Gates.  At 9:10, Tokyo three days...what battery solution will do that?  11:48 what is needed?  Nukes or large grid battery for grid.  Lot of difficult things.  My engine and NH3 cover most!  Nuke in china cheaper than coal, but 5x in USA.		https://t.co/Qr4jegaa2K
Bill states that the 2 week storage is 100 times more difficult than a car battery.  Sorry, no it is not.  Actually rather easy.  Machine exists.  NH3 and my engine provides the bridge.  Start with the right solution and energy is easy.
Wow, Gates actually gets it on battery and storage problem at time starting at 35 minutes.  Hard battery problem is the grid battery...36.13...two week periods in desert that you get no solar at all.  How to store?  He said it is a "mind blowing problem."  No it is not!  NH3! https://t.co/b1bDV6ZCtQ
Notice that Gates is all about large scale and not micro generation in house.  The ultimate monopoly is nuclear power due to regs and danger, which is why I am not a big fan of it.  I want independent power that can be anywhere without grid.
More Bill Gates videos.  Notice he does not have a real solution like I have.  He at least admits some truth about renewable stuff.  I am so tired of people with money not knowing what to do.  What a waste.		https://t.co/SHC7fk690w
@gatewaypundit @AOC Read my tweets.  New grid.		1) underground nuclear	2) NH3 fuel makers		Run N at well above peak grid and make NH3 for vehicles with excess power.  NH3 becomes the variable consumption to balance demand.  N Power constant. No turbines, Diesels or spin needed.  All zero carbon!
So, a grid could be run with two devices. 		1) in ground nuclear power	2) NH3 fuel maker and fuel tanks.		No turbines, diesel engines, spin power or other costly elements would be needed.  The power would be pure sine wave and not inverter based.  This might be way grid survives.
@colum_osullivan This "exercise" in tweeting here is helping me see how my engine can or will play out depending on different factors.  With the need for grid storage and cars/truck/airplanes on NH3, my engine becomes a key enabler of zero carbon, as well as the bridge to get there with 5 fuels.
@colum_osullivan Don't misunderstand, I LOVE carbon fuels and want to triple CO2 if I could.  I am tweeting to see how to get to zero carbon to unplug the insanity around carbon.  Solve the problem and we can all give it a rest.  I can see "free fuel" via my tech....  read tweets....
@colum_osullivan Great points.  I don't like PV panels.  Elon Mush has some new solar tiles that look great, so ugly does not need to be part of solar.  My solar thermal will look very cool and be 100% of roof space, 100+ year roofs...  Batteries are not the answer to zero carbon (not my issue).
A coal plant could not be put under ground as easily as a nuclear plant could, as I understand it.  This disadvantage is not massive, but a consideration.  Out of sight, out of mind may be a key element to get nuclear as the single grid power source, eliminating wind/solar.
@colum_osullivan Yes, and NH3 could be made for cars, trucks, airplanes and it could all be zero carbon, ASAP.
If Nuclear power could be made like what Bill Gates envisions, namely a thing under the ground out of sight, the "foot print" of energy would be ZERO except for current power lines.  This would be MUCH better than wind/solar/etc.  It depends on the price.  3 cent/kwh maybe?
@ThomasPaine5 The road could become the dividing line.  You stay right going north and I stay to my right going south.  Keep the road on left side.  See and avoid.  This will take time, but first we need the right airplanes.  Cessna won't work.
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, they will want to tax us, but do they now?  Nobody sits on a bridge overpass and tells you to get in this or that lane.   With new tech, the FAA roll will dramatically change.  People will avoid controlled airports...use roads.  Fly above roads on on right side of road....&gt;
@ThomasPaine5 I would fly in "class G" airspace 1200 feet above road where they don't control.  If I want to go IFR (instruments) then I would pay a small fee for vectoring, but mostly it could be self guided with new technology.  The FAA would have to become sane and real.
Which would you like?		Nuclear power underground, NH3 in all vehicles and airplanes with $1/gal fuel in 200 mpg car, no debt.  		Or		Wind/solar all over the planet, electric cars with batteries and trains, no airplanes and $49 trillion in debt
Remember, a car with my engine on NH3 would cost less than an electric car on battery.  It would be 200 mpg e vs an electric car at 100 mpg e.  The energy to make NH3 &lt;1.5 times input, no battery costs, 2x economy.		X*1.5/2 = X + 12c/kwh bat.  Solve X=-48 c/kwh.  Always cheaper.
With Nuclear at some level well over peak grid loads, the making of NH3 can be distributed to stations via grid to NH3 makers local if desired.  No need for trucking in the fuel.  Instead, send it over the electrical lines to the stations.  Home fuel units could be sold too.
@ThomasPaine5 Roads in sky is a 10-20+ year old concept and already enabled.  In high traffic, yes, an air "road" would be in the air that defines your "road" in the sky, just like the road does with dotted lines.  All doable for separations.  ADSB tells you where other airplanes are.
@ThomasPaine5 New = costly.  I use roads because I don't have costs other than cents/mile via State regulations.  One permit pays for use, and fuel tax pays for road.  I use gasoline on the road to be legal and NH3/heating fuel/propane in the air to not pay taxes.   Look up "virtual VFR" ....
With CONSTANT nuclear and/or coal power and VARIABLE NH3 production and large storage, the frequency and voltage is controlled by NH3 production, some of which can be in houses, factories or stations.  No turbines needed!
To go zero carbon, NH3 is the key.  This then puts nuclear/coal well ABOVE the peak 8PM load by perhaps 1.5-3 times.   Nuclear and coal become nearly CONSTANT power sources that only slowly changed power according  to NH3 demand and storage levels, NOT grid demand.  Key!
Notice on the duck curve the load variation.  In figure 2 you would set Nuclear/coal at a constant 28,000 Megawatts, just above the 8 PM peak. As demand drops, NH3 production increases and balances loads. To cover all vehicles, much more power needed.		https://t.co/r8K0N1vVgT
Nuclear and/or coal can ELIMINATE the need for oil for transit by being a constant power source above peak evening power and making NH3 during low load times.  No turbines would be needed, and NH3 would be made for all vehicles and sold at stations.   Understand?
By going with nuclear at above peak load (evening power load) and making NH3 for vehicles with the "spread" between power and demand, the need for turbines is eliminated, resulting in MAJOR cost savings and lower rates.  Same can be done with Coal if CO2 were not an issue.
Which would be cheaper?  Wind/solar or Nuclear?  		If peak power is 1.5 time base load,  nuclear can go to 1.6-2 x to make NH3 for vehicles, and allow NH3 makers to "throttle" the grid.  Constant power is cheap.  NO turbines needed.		Wind needs 3-4 times base plus NH3 + turbines.
The wind/solar needs storage and combustion to make power when both wind/solar fail to make power.  		Nuclear needs storage and combustion to allow a high base load above peak and to have zero carbon fuel for vehicles via NH3.  		NH3 becomes the throttle, not Nuke or wind/solar.
So, the "green" industry and the IPCC want to ban combustion and kill nuclear power in favor of wind and solar.  		I say all three should be allowed to find solutions and stop the bias and political nonsense.  My engine is needed either way to do NH3 via combustion.
To make airplanes work, a new engine "type" is needed.  Turbines and old Otto engines won't do the job for many reasons.  But what will?  That depends on what is needed.  Understand?  Ask the "7 whys" of airplanes and you can see the future of aviation.  Takes effort....
@gatewaypundit @AOC Just imagine the damage her green new deal would do to us all.  $49 trillion down the toilet.
@phillyeaglesfa1 @BreitbartNews To trap sheep, the gate must be fully closed.  To "trap" heat from ground radiation, the ENTIRE spectrum MUST be "closed" or attenuated, otherwise the heat finds another frequency and gets out.  More CO2 does nothing, like adding taller poles and no slats to fence.
@phillyeaglesfa1 @BreitbartNews A gate half open cannot trap half the sheep.  Fourier said that about the IR spectrum in 1820.  The attenuation of IR is 1/2 open to space and hence cannot trap heat via GHGs.  Same applies to illegals.  Funny how alarmists and illegalists can't understand how to trap sheep.
Has small innovations in small airplanes brought about low costs and high volume?  NO!  Why not?  		What are the elements needed to be successful in small airplane?  What about nuclear?  What elements are needed?  What needs to change to make either a dominate player?  Discuss?
Why are the Nuclear and small airplane industries "dead" as it were?  		Both have small volumes and higher costs with innovations.  Innovation is not  successful in either.  Both have huge regulations.  		Mike's perspective is an interesting view, but does it say why? https://t.co/1n9xAZoQT0
@ThomasPaine5 Won't work...  Airplane MUST be able to LAND/TAKEOFF from ROADS where there are no cars in the moment, and clear of trees and power line hazards.  Land, fold while driving, pull to lane and continue on.  NO STOPPING to block traffic.  This takes a new type of engine....
@marklutchman She is not eligible, so why bother?  An anchor baby can in no way be President.  Silly nonsense.
@ShellenbergerMD Are you a nuclear engineer?  I am a Mechanical engineer...
@ShellenbergerMD NONE of the designs I see will be cost effective and I have only looked at this for a few days.  I don't do Nuclear because of the heavy government regulations and weapons issue, and I am not against it.  Just as airplanes are dead, so too will nuclear until new occurs.
@ShellenbergerMD I also use 8 motors and a way to never run out of fuel before landing.  It can land on roads, drive down road and crash at 70 mph (4 feet of absorption via landing gear).  In short, it won't kill.  It is much safer than airliners (potentially).  Same must be so with nuclear.
@ShellenbergerMD Airplanes (Cessna to Lear) are next to useless and very costly.  You can't get to high volume until you change the purpose and get to volume.  My engine can go in cars, trucks, boats, houses, track hoes, etc, AND airplanes.  I get volume in airplane engines via other products...&gt;
@ShellenbergerMD The article missed the 800 lbs gorilla in the room.  In aviation we see similar cost increases.  When the product kills, costs go up with innovations and it never becomes viable.  Rule #1.  Don't kill the customer.  #2 Innovate and then slide down the cost curve.  Volume is key.
@ShellenbergerMD Mike, since you (likely) know more about nuclear than I do, what is the best cost of gen IV systems at the plant (not retail)?  Coal is 1.8 c/kwh near where I live.  What is the new Terrapower and other systems projecting?  I want to know what cost it can be to make NH3 via N.
@ShellenbergerMD By going to Nh3 and my engine, total efficiency will be better than electric cars and batteries.  Engine will be par in drive eff to electric.  1/2 weight of car and active drag reduction for 2x fuel economy.  200 mpg new car with my engine vs 100 mpg in electric car.
@Noahpinion Or you stage this:  You get my engine systems and switch to $1/gal e NH3 and run house, cars, trucks, boats, airplane and factory power on NH3 via solar.  Store 3+ months of fuel for winter.  Make it during spring, summer, fall.  Independent from debate...Live life well.
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, regulations are an issue, but with the experimental aircraft exemption clause, I can get flying without any hassle.  Using it for taxi service however would require heavy costs of certifications.   I have spoken with the FAA and they like what I am doing.   All new to them.
@ShellenbergerMD Wind/solar are up/down, intermittent	Nuclear is base load.		Grid requires demand=supply.		Solution: NH3 storage and combustion.  Both wind/solar and nuclear then have a place.		Run Nuclear at 100-150% of peak grid and use excess to make NH3.  Wind/solar makes NH3.  Use in vehicle
@ThomasPaine5 The old engines can be modified but then they only can run NH3, not the old fuels, unless you do the mixing, which is not zero carbon.  Two fuels is a problem....customer don't like it.  More to this than some see....  My engine can do all fuels due to unique design factor.
@ThomasPaine5 If you mean an old Otto or Diesel, yes, they can with a mix of NH3 (70-90%) and gasoline/Diesel (10-30%) depending on compression ratios. 100% NH3 is difficult. NH3 wants to burn at 1200K, vs 480k for Diesel.  The compression ratio needs to be 50:1, much to high for Diesel.
@ThomasPaine5 Normally I will have three 9 HP generators in a house system.  This will cover the range of power from 1-25 KW allowed on grid.  More power can easily be added if solar is maxed out for NH3 production via house.  More power can also be added in cars, airplanes, etc.  Modular....
@ThomasPaine5 The point of my tweets is to get help in getting this needed engine.  It just so happens to also solves energy, which was not my focus.  This engine is needed to make flying cheaper than driving and useful daily.  Electric drones can't work well.  This can be air taxi and more..&gt;
@ThomasPaine5 The engine system was design for aircraft.  Can do "boundary layer" blown wing and sucking that allows 10 CL on wings vs standard 2 for a C-172.  This allows safe post stall control and very short (50 feet) landings at 30 mph, but an airplane that is smooth.  Engine is key.
@ThomasPaine5 The engine is a "distributed" engine system, unlike turbines or Otto/Diesel engine.  Many small motor working together.  Conventional generator torqued by motor can be used off the shelf.  The engine can use solar thermal as well as 5 fuels and NH3.  Nothing like it exists.
@themotleyfool My new technology?
@PrimeUnicornIDX @INRIX @ajc My technology can solve traffic.  Serious.  No, not a train from the 1800's.  New technology, door to door you own and can rent out to make money.  It can also have a wing added and fly.  Flying cheaper than road tax, tires and brakes.
@carleigh1985 Just like facebook was life log, a CIA operation to record your life...
The red head is what I feel trying to explain how to solve energy via my engine, solar and NH3 maker and why combustion of 5 fuels is needed to get to zero carbon ASAP.  The 5 fuels are the bridge.  Once enough people have engine, switch to NH3 via nuclear, wind, solar, etc. https://t.co/dOBXFb68Hu
@OpenSecretsDC I can do the R&amp;D to solve energy problem for much less than that, and get us to near "free" fuel via my engine, solar and NH3 maker.  What can Bernie do with that money?  Waste your time and buy more houses and fancy cars.  Amazing....
This should be good.  I want the truth.  CO2 is not an issue for me.  Independence from big green and big oil is my goal.  Being able to make my own fuel via NH3 and solar, as well as use 5 fuels now used anywhere will allow world travel, and free local travel.  Free flying...fun https://t.co/XsB1SpNuVD
@JE1849 Trains are SOOOOO outdated.   1800's junk.  Sorry, flying will be cheaper than driving.  Fuel less than road tax, tires and brakes at 200 mph with my roadable door to door seaplane.
Looks like it will be difficult to get wind and solar going by 2050 due to material demands.  Nuclear has better chance.  		https://t.co/1O6yxTOwkc
Another point of view.  Don't agree, but this is what they believe. https://t.co/OiwwhqsuEs
To get to zero carbon you need combustion engine that can use 5 fuels  and NH3.  Nh3 is the future storage fuel for grid.  Use in cars, trucks  and airplanes.  No batteries needed.  zero carbon...but banned?   Seriously stupid.  Let innovation rule, not idiots.
Banning fossil fuel cars.  Ban the solution to zero carbon. https://t.co/8VjD12lnNI
Some more Gates view on energy.  I comment....		https://t.co/rk2EmJbamB
Older Gates vid on Terrapower		https://t.co/El5Pg7ygAQ
More on Gates nuclear power stuff.  Interesting.		https://t.co/bB3uCO55XO
More on Gates investing in nuclear.  		https://t.co/b7YAHlLdBW
The problem still remains that cars need the right engine and NH3 is a classic chicken and egg problem.  My engine solves this issue.  First get engines in cars that can run all 5 fuel and NH3, then switch to NH3 made by electricity, either by nuclear, solar or wind.  Engine KEY! https://t.co/HL8z9SItuv
Sounds like lots of CO2 people are going nuclear, finally.  Nuclear with NH3 is a good way to go for the grid.  My engine makes it 4x better for cars with NH3 and 2-3 x for trucks and boats.  Need all three.		https://t.co/LCISWnLNg7
@RepDMP Promoting lawless endangerment of children should get any Rep removed from office.  You are not protecting the American people.  Just get out!
There has to be 1000's of way CO2 can be emitted in so many processes that are just outside what I am focused on, namely the engine.  The 8000 lbs gorilla is my engine, and the rest of the mouses and rabbits out there will have to be considered one by one by some who cares.
@1776Stonewall Where have climate models worked either?  NOwhere.  Seems to be a theme for these people.  Believe the theory, but not the facts and fruits of the tree.  The taste of socialsim's tree is nasty poison.
@ThomasPaine5 The saving on fuel and maintenance for a semi truck could fund all my R&amp;D from first engine to $100's of billions...much bigger than Microsoft and Google...  Just need to get over that hump....
The last 10% is outside what I am willing to use my time on.  I see CO2 as entirely beneficial, but I am willing to get to zero engine CO2 to get to NH3 and "free" fuel for my seaplane.  If Gates want's his goal, my engine can get him 90% there cheaply, but without...good luck.
My engine could do 90% of the CO2 and the last 10% will take 90% of the costs.  Again, zero carbon is NOT my goal.  It is Gate's goal.  I am just trying to see how close.  The last 10% could be taken care of by proper management of forests and such.  90% is better than nothing.
I would say that my engine can knock out over 80% for sure, and likely 90% total.  All transit, all Ag, all electricity, all buildings, most manufacturing power, not paper waste, and other...don't know.  Cement...no. https://t.co/zmJcOatz4L
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, once I get all the work done.  I am looking to speed up the R&amp;D with Mech engineers.  Hence twitter....
@ThomasPaine5 One company claims 30 cents/liter NH3= $3.4 /gal equiv to gasoline, which is MORE than gasoline now.  PV panels at 15 c/kwh x 1.55 x 33.7 = $7.84/gal e. A Stanford Prof. thinks 1.1 as factor, just like charging a battery -10% loss.  I can see 1 cent x 1.1 x 33.7 = 37c/gal equiv.
@ThomasPaine5 No.  The factors are:	1) electricity cost (1.5?)	2) conversion yield electricity to NH3 (1.35-1.55?)	3) capital and maintenance costs (???)		1.5 x 1.55 x 33.7 =  78 c/gal equiv to gas.  /3= 26/gal NH3.  I can see $0.50-1.4/gal e depending on factors...less than gasoline possible.
@ThomasPaine5 Cost of what?  Tesla? or NH3.  I think NH3 can be made for less than $1/gal e (33 cents/gal NH3).  Electricity is $4/gal.  My engine is par to electric so cost ration for fuel is 4:1 plus battery which is $4/gal e for 8:1 ratio...then add in other factors...up to 32:1
@ThomasPaine5 No, size to desired range.  Engine takes care of volume issue.  18 gal tank would be ok too.  18/3=6 x 100 mpg = 600 mile range.  400 miles would be about the lowest range, or what a Buick now gets.
@ThomasPaine5 The tanks would have to be 250 PSI tanks like propane needs, not 3600 PSI Nat Gas tanks.  4 inches diameter, 5 feet long, 10 across on floor where Tesla puts battery.  25-30 gallons, or less ok too.  Just my target.
@ThomasPaine5 Fill it up and goes 1/3 distance.  Hence the problem.  My engine can get 3-5 times better economy due to 60-75% vs 10-20% in Otto engines on average.  The volume problem is solved by engine efficiency.  Size for 30 gallons and 100 mpg e.  Range 1k miles NH3, and 3k on gasoline.
Gates figures on CO2 emissions:		14% transit	24% Ag	25% electricity	21% manufacturing	6% buildings	10% other.		Interesting how he divides it up.  I would not do it that way.
@ThomasPaine5 No, air, water and electricity is how I would make it.  CH4 (methane) is how most is made now, but that is NOT what I am suggesting.
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, 9500 kw/L for gasoline vs 3194.  9500/3194=2.97  ~ 3:1.  So, there is a weight penalty to using NH3 over gasoline.  Gasoline 6.3lb/gal energy vs 14.35 lbs/gal equiv energy to gasoline.  Full tank weights 75% of fuel tank of gasoline, but only has only 1/3 the energy.
@ThomasPaine5 Already tweeted about that.  NH3 is the only viable electro chemical.  I think it can be made cheaper than gasoline.  My engine will be able to use propane, NH3, gasoline, Diesel, Jet A and 100 LL...  https://t.co/1AZqBchUbg
Here Lewis says Nuclear is not the answer either due to the need.  He thinks solar is key, and so do I.  Solar to NH3 with 5 other fuels will allow 20 year transition from fossil fuels to cheap NH3 made by solar.		https://t.co/pNV2l5l8Uy
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, made from solar thermal on house plus engine and NH3 maker.  Use NH3 as the fuel in vehicles of all types, as well as 5 other fuels until NH3 is cheaper.  Wind and solar farms can also make NH3 for the general market.
Lewis and Gates think the only goal is zero or less.  My goal is a cool seaplane with my engine type.  CO2 is beneficial, but if they want zero carbon, then I can do that too if NH3 is cheaper, as long as I can get 5 fuels if needed.
Lewis:  120,000 TW in 1 hour from sun...  His technology is a way to turn CO2 into fuel.  Artificial photo synthesis.  I say NH3 is MUCH better.  Yes, gasoline is 3:1 more dense, but NH3 is easy.  My engine is key....again!  Look, I have to KNOW I am on the right path....&gt;
Nate Lewis is totally wrong about CO2.  Sad, but true.  No way to store?  Wrong.  NH3.  Use NH3 in airplanes.  Carbon fuels too.j  He is totally outdated.  Battery 200wh/kg vs 12,000 gasoline.  Yes, chemical fuels.  No Carbon tax will give us...&gt;		https://t.co/RVu4u31xFI
Let's see if he will respond.  In a way, I hope he does not.  I can do this without his or any help from such people.  Would be better that way. Common folk who can think and work, who also have a degree in Mechanical engineering... https://t.co/j6pJdVdtEa
@BillGates I have your CO2 solution.  Comprehensive.  All except concrete.  Happy to discuss it.  seaplaneguy@msn.com
@Jali_Cat @TheDemocrats @RepJerryNadler Be all that you can be in the Army...		Be all that you can be in your own country.		Get it?  Be a soldier for good where you stand.  Lift where you stand....
Yes, Nathan Lewis got me going in this direction.  Solar fuel is the future.  My engine is the other side of the equation.  Old engines/turbines will NOT work.  Need new engine type as different as Otto is to turbine.  The gap is my engine.  Wonder if Bill will add it up?
Wow, Bill finally found the guy who knows.  A Caltech guy...I worked with a bunch of those guys. Inventor of the airbag was a Caltech guy...my boss.  Solar to fuel is key.  Bill knows....now the engine to run it and the system to integrate it all.  		https://t.co/NMcWStgOat
Bill likes fertilizer.  Our fuel will be fertilizer....NH3.  Again, my technology solves, energy, water, sanitation, power, airplane, track hoes, boats, factories and more.  This is NOT some useless Tesla with hiding handles.  Only REAL solutions.  		https://t.co/dQ2ck9pEfT
Notice in the video that we spend more on gasoline in a week than the entire research budget of the USA government.  5. x 52 weeks/year= $260 billion/year.  My engine can get 75% of that gone immediately, followed by NH3 and $1/gal e fuel.  .75 x 260 = $195 billion/year saving.
Gates: "us government spends about 5 billion/year on energy research."	My engine solves his problem.  Wonder when he will actually want a real solution.		https://t.co/A17M6EuEoL
Here is another Gates video.  Again, my solution gets most all except concrete.  		https://t.co/UqaURUSgnk

Here is a 15 year oil price per barrel.   Seems to be a floor at $30 and support in the $54/b.  Must be a cost of production that takes out high cost producers.  $110 looks like a high resistance.  2:1 ratio range 55-110		https://t.co/bog294ADuB
If the system can make 1300 gal e/year and 56 c/kwh maintenance, then in 5 years the overhaul would be $3640.  That seems high....  Half?  1820?  Say 25-30 cents/kwh plus $1 for interest.  Total of $1.25-1.3/gal e?  Hmmm.  Somewhere around there.  In the ball park at least..&gt;
If I say it can be built for $25k and make 1300 gallon e of NH3, and interest on loan is 5%, then the interest comes to $1250 ~ 1300 = $1/gal.  So, cost of capital makes the fuel cost around $1/gal plus maintenance. 1.5 c/kwh x 1.1 x 33.7 = 56 c...Fuel cost is then $1.56/gal
Where would you fly to if fuel were free for 200 hour/year?  40,000 miles/year.  		5.3 hours/day solar average in my area x 365 x 25 KW= 48362 kw-h ... /33.7 = 1435 gallons. /1.1 to make =1304 gal e x 30 mpg =39k miles... say 40,000 miles.  Interest on $25k ~ $1250.  $1/gal!
My engine can unplug Bill Gates and his quest for zero carbon, as well as unplug oil and price swings.  My engine systems has the cool potential to making "free" fuel betweetn 5 years overhaul intervals.  Like putting 1/5th the cost fuel on a credit card without interest 5 years.
Wow, the insane nonsense I am willing to put up with to get my engine.  Maybe I should just do the engine and forget about you all and let you fend for yourselves.  Yes?  Clearly you all think these CO2 cultists will go away.  Sorry, new flash, they aren't and they love eugenics.
Gates said: “Do you guys on Wall Street have something in your desks that makes  steel? Where is fertilizer, cement, plastic going to come from? Do  planes fly through the sky because of some number you put in a  spreadsheet?”  My engine solves all, except cement.
Bill is on a roll! “The idea that we have the current tools and it’s just because these  utility people are evil people and if we could just beat on them and put  (solar panels) on our rooftop—that is more of a block than climate  denial,” Gates said. 	https://t.co/4SHYtzqg9x
Watch Bill Gates go off on renewables, NOT due to costs but reliability.  My solution solves ALL aspects of energy, not just some portion of the grid which is only 25%, according to Gates.  We need to have a chat....		https://t.co/CaPJKxrwYp
The NH3 is then used in vehicles and NOT electricity, thus having the benefits of my engine (or similar) with low weight + boundary layer.  Airplanes would use NH3 too and all buildings and vehicles/equipment would be zero carbon.  So, yes, Nuclear CAN work coupled to NH3....&gt;
Typical Peak evening load vs 3AM grid load is about 1.5 x.  NH3 then would be 1/3 of the power at night and 2/3 would be to grid.  House solar and existing wind would be tasked to making NH3, NOT grid power, except for local loads to house.  NH3 becomes the "throttle" to grid.
"Solar power’s greatest challenge was discovered 10 years ago. It looks like a duck."		Solar/wind needs to be for NH3 and not grid.  		Set Nuclear/coal at constant base load above peak evening loads, and make NH3 with excess.  NH3 balances grid.  		https://t.co/r8K0N1vVgT

Like I said, oil prices are all about cartels and people are sick of being scammed when some "leader" wants to make more money for his empire or mansion expansion.  		Maintenance is a per unit basis. A person can always just use gasoline if cheaper to avoid maintenance. https://t.co/jJEgRowqS7
Then you add in the 4x fuel economy and you get 25 c/gal e relative to old gasoline cars.  The engine insures that the it remains in demand over any electrical car and battery improvements due to the inherent grid costs and PV costs with battery store and transfer costs.
The question is what is the floor of fossil fuel costs and can my system remain below that floor.  Some say floor is at $32/b which is around $0.90-1/gal, no tax.  I think that is doable, especially if the fuel is "free" between overhauls, where an average is taken over 5 years
We see this trick in Natural Gas cars.  Gasoline at $4.5/gal.  Nat Gas at $0.65-1/gal e.  Makes sense to convert.  Now Nat Gas is $1.87/gal and gasoline $2.3/gal.  Not enough savings to pay for the hassle and time to fill up at a remote fill station.  Hence, no more NG interest.
There is retail and industrial.  Industrial is now 5 c/kwh or less in some places.  That is 1.68/gal e, or about what gasoline is now.  If "they" (oil people) want to drop prices, they can and will to keep the oil flowing.  The trick is to not get upside down in the renewables.
Fuel cost (no tax) has ranged from 1.6 to 4.44 in my memory.  Grid is $4/gal e at 12 c/kwh.  When my engine is par to electric cars, I get a 2.77 x discount by using gasoline, and 4.44 discount via NH3 (potentially).  To compete, the grid will need to be cheaper.  3-4 c/kwh?
The problem I am seeing here is that costs are not market.  They are manipulated by large factions with agendas.  We saw Oil at $150/b and now $54/b.  150/54=2.77  Retail is now as low as $1.6/gal for gasoline without road tax.  2.77 x 1.6/gal = 4.44/gal reg.  Close....&gt;
If a person invests in my solar and engine with NH3, they could make fuel for car, airplane, camper, boat for less than $1/gal e.  Battery + grid is $8-9/gal in USA and 2x in EU.  If the grid cannot close that gap, then what will happen?  Customers will be gone.
If you use 10800 kwh or 320 gal e/year in electricity, how much in two cars?		15,000 x 2 / 25 mpg = 1200 gal.  		1200/320=3.75.  		1200/4=300 x 1.1 = 330 gal e.  		By using my engine, car fuel ~= house electrical, on average.   		Power both for 1-3 c/kwh and save.
The reality is that with my technology and others, the cost of electricity could fall to 2 c/kwh marginally and around 6 retail.  Can Nuclear power get down that low?  If not, then who will be their customer?  With more on/off again renewables, how can Nuclear survive?
If the grid pays 6 to put power on it, and 12 to take it off (2:1 ratio), it can make sense to make NH3 instead of sending excess power to grid, but not without my engine to give 4x fuel economy.  Any way you slice it, the PV panel is a loss due to the high costs.
The $2/gal fuel at 25 mpg is 8 c/mile.	The $4/gal fuel from PV and NH3 at 100 mpg is 4 c/mile.  		The problem is the duck curve.  Nuclear power plants would have to make NH3 to allow your PV to supply to grid via inverters.  DC vs AC.  PV panels can make NH3 without inverters.
By having my engine in car, the true $4/gal e cost of electricity (at 12 cent/kwh) from PV panels, has the ability to give you 4x in fuel economy over gasoline.  Since gasoline is now $2/gal that is like having 50% of the cost to drive.  $2/gal at 25 mpg vs $4/gal at 100 mpge.
If you solar PV or solar thermal were sized to make the 10800 kwh, you could make NH3 instead for "free" and drive your NH3 car for free during the year.  320 gal/year x $2/gal (market) is worth $640/y.  20 year?  $12800.  Most PV Solar costs more than twice that, hence $4/gal e.
Some numbers...  If you pay $100/month for electricity at 11 c/kwh you use around 900 kw-h/month.  x 12 = 10800 kwh/y = 320 gal e.  If you drive 15,000 miles/year at 100 mpg e you use 150 gal/car/year.  That amount of electricity would make NH3 for two cars with my engine in it.
Make the nuclear power plants in small underground units that are local.  Excess power is turned into NH3 next to the plant to avoid lines.  Cars, trucks, boats, airplanes are all run on NH3.  Use in my engine for 3-5x fuel economy.  Solar PV on house and wind makes NH3, not grid
I read this article and see the solution, but most do not.  Let me spell it out.  Wind and solar should go to making NH3 and not to the grid due to their DC nature.  The grid costs are much too high and it needs to be AC.  NH3 makers use DC.      		https://t.co/Nu02pIQ4D6
@Redus5678 @trishshirlaw By all the invading hordes....
This is an option too.  The nuclear power plant makes NH3 for cheap and it is used in cars, trucks and airplanes.  The NH3 act as offset demand to allow constant Nuclear power as needed.  No turbines, wind or grid solar.  All make NH3.  Grid nuclear. https://t.co/ES0MYOvImK
@JWSpry Use Nuclear power at near peak needs (evening) at constant high power.  Use NH3 makers to absorb excess and control for actual when power needs drops.  Use NH3 in car/truck/boats.  No need for oil, batteries, turbines.  No duck curve.  Make NH3 for $2/gal e retail.  Case closed.
@trendsNewsday China needs my technology. Electric cars won't work.  Happy to discuss it, but sitting in traffic is NOT needed folks.  There is a better way.  All private, door to door, owner, not rented....  Question is:  Will people I me get investor help or do you all want to rot in traffic?
80 c/hr would be at 12,000 feet.  Down low would be about $1-1.18/hr.  On gasoline it would cost $5.9/hr with $2.5/gal gasoline.  Set up solar fuel at ICE stations and their costs are zero between overhauls.  I would do it for free....if they bought my airplanes....
What could a border patrol agent patrol the border at 125 mph on 50 c/gal e NH3?  Around 80 cents/hr.  You can't idle an old car for that....  Put ALL agents in roadable seaplanes (land in river if need be) and fly the border.  Best solution for ICE.  Cheaper than cheap.
So, $16 in fuel from San Francisco to Hawaii in 19 hours.  How much would a solar powered airplane costs?  MORE!  Remember, engines are par in efficiency so, fuel used would be 32 gal e x 33.7 x .12 = $129 in battery use.   129/16=8  8 times MORE!  Wow, I can be them all!
How much would it cost to fly 2400 miles to Hawaii on 50 c/gal fuel?  Say I fly slow (125 mph) instead 200 mph.  Cost would be a meager $0.0065/mile fuel.  $16.  It would take 32 gal e or 96 gallon NH3.  Doable.  19.2 hrs of flying.  Ten x = around world.  $160?  ...&gt;
If I can get to 50 cents/gal e, with 60-75% vs 25% in Lycoming, that would be up to 2.4-3x for efficiency.  With 100 LL at at $5/gal, that is a 10:1 fuel cost ratio (0.50 vs 5.0)  Around 24-30 x less than with this engine in old Cessna vs old Lycoming.  And Free between overhauls
The key thing is now I have NH3 as a means to "free fuel" that some many have in their minds as possible.  Buy the equipment and, yes, the fuel is "free" plus the maintenance.  Between overhauls, I pay ZERO for fuel with NH3.  The costs could be as low as 50 cents/gal equivalent.
I am glad I found NH3 instead of Natural Gas.  I saved around 1 year of work not having to deal with high pressures and made the system much lower costs and House code able.  All around I saved myself a LOT of money these two months.  Haste makes waste.  Slowly getting it right.
NH3 becomes the compressed Natural Gas or low cost fuel.  Natural Gas is around $1/gal e and no will NH3 be.  3.8 gal/gal e vs 3 gal/gal e by volume.  Close.  The lower strength tanks allow more tanks and more fuel.  800 mile range with NH3, 2400 with gasoline for Hawaii trip.
I am about two months into looking into NH3 and changing the design to allow 5 fuels and NH3.  I have dropped Natural Gas as a fuel due to 3600 PSI compression difficulties and injecting gas vs liquid.  All fuels are liquid during injection, which allows one injector.  Savings...
@TheBadDadder Depends on the value of the frame only.
Now that is some soccer handling skill/talent. https://t.co/rRhYRt4HSR
Looking for Mechanical Engineers to work on new engine that solves the energy problem.  Can use NH3 (zero carbon) or any of 5 fuels.  It enables lots of new crafts (airplanes, cars, boats, house power, etc) not able with jets, turbos or piston cranks.  Grid able.  Solar power.
@Jali_Cat @TheDemocrats @RepJerryNadler They should stay and fix their own countries.  They don't want to be anything besides what they are.  So they should go back and be all they can be in their own country.
@POETbiofuels Biofuels are ok, but NH3 is the future.  see my tweets.  We can get to zero carbon, yet still use carbon fuels if needed.  New engine can run NH3 and 5 fuels.  When NH3 is cheaper, switch to NH3.  zero carbon.  Bio fuels good for greenhouses.

@CharlesVanCott I want the engine to make a seaplane that is roadable and door to door.  It is much more advanced than an x-57 or any "drone" and can totally transform transportation making flying cheaper than driving...all potentially zero carbon.  Read the tweets to understand or ask.
@CharlesVanCott Nh3 could be made for around $1/gal equivalent to gasoline.  33 c/gal NH3.  This is cheaper than gasoline.  People will switch to NH3 if cheaper, but there is no engine that can run NH3.  My engine is the key to lower costs and NH3, which is zero carbon.  Old fuels still ok.
@tariqnasheed Penalty for treason is hanging....
@CharlesVanCott Right here.  Read tweets.  Ask.  New type of engine that runs on 5 fuels AND NH3.  Get into cars/trucks/airplane/boats, then switch to NH3 via wind/solar which make NH3.  Grid needs storage to get to 0 C.  NH3 is that fuel.  My engine can run NH3.  Old cannot.  Zero carbon ASAP.
@ISSUESinST @Climeworks Why waste your time and money.  This is NOT needed.  My engine systems can get you to zero carbon ASAP.
@HondaInclusion @hondajet @AngelFlightEast Honda, this is soooooo outdated.  Want to talk about the future of aviation and not the past?

@CharlesVanCott Flying private airplanes on NH3 (zero carbon) will soon be a reality at less cost than the road tax, tires and brakes...about 4 cents/mile fuel at 200 mph for a 4-5 place tandem airplane perfect for air taxi service.  Can fit in garage, drive down road, door to door.  Trains? NOT

@jcchristianson Want to talk about getting 90% of the cost of energy gone?  Read my tweets.  This technology will set the world free....
@FlipItRed_2020 @realDonaldTrump Well said!  "Nothing less democratic than socialism."  Remember, Hitler was a socialist.  It robs people of their creativity and only allows the inside group to make choices, which leads to death and destruction.
@trishshirlaw They better wake up or they will be driven out of their own country.
Into investments, or into real estate or travel.  With my seaplane, traveling the world would be affordable for most middle class people.  With flying cheaper than driving, even people on minimum wage could afford to fly, provided it were designed right as my seaplane is.
What would happen to our economy when 90% of the energy costs are GONE?  Energy now is 20-30% of the average person's wages.   They save 18-27% of their income.  This would massively help economy like nothing else.
When energy then becomes 2-3% of costs instead of current 20-30% it becomes insignificant.  If that same energy is nearly constant due to maintenance factors and not politics, it cannot be used to manipulate markets.  The current dead loss in fuels then goes into investments.
How to get 90% of the fuel costs gone?  $1/gal e for NH3.  1/2.25= .44.  1/4 fuel in car and house via solar and you gets you to 0 .11 or about 90%.  That means energy would be 2-3% of cost of goods sold, or about the current credit card fees (insane, btw).  Understand?
Depending on how you want to calculate it and assumptions, the fuel costs are around 20-30% of the average person's life now.  More for older people and people who travel a lot.  If 2.25 is the average energy/gal e cost, then by going to NH3 and my engine you can get 90% gone.
They say 25 tons CO2/person. How many gal e is that?  Assume 2000 lbs/ton.  157 lbs/MMBTU for gasoline. 8.7 gal/MMbtu.  2000/157 x 8.7  x25=2770 gal e to gasoline.  Assume $2.25/gal on average (fuel and  electricity).  2770 x 2.25=$6233.  $100k 2 workers, 4/family, 25% of  wages
The right help to get it going.  If not, we all will waste $trillions on nonsense technology.  Each year we waste nearly $1 trillion in the USA alone where we would not with my engine technology.  The economy would BOOOOOM with my engine.  Travel?  Hotels....dining.  All up.
Can you see how I am going to "pull the rug" out from under the electric car industry?  Flying cars is the future and batteries are much to heavy.  Crash protection is key, and I have the needed experience to make it work at 70 mph frontal crash...  Just need the right help to..&gt;
With 4x economy, it would be like buy fuel for $38 cents/gal until the tax rules changed.  Taxes would have to be by the distance and weight.  Suddenly people would want to fly to avoid road tax costs.  Electric cars will be stuck on the road in traffic and cost 8+ x more.
Interesting note. https://t.co/zKtI960iFv
What would happen to the price of fuel if my engine were installed?  1/4 demand in cars and 1/2 in semi trucks.  Trucks could use gasoline or diesel, whichever is cheaper per energy.  $1/gal fuel + 45-48 road tax = less than $1.5/gal.
If you subtract out the fuel tax of 45 c/gal, fuel costs 2.4-.45 = 1.95.  I have seen it at 2.05...  205-.45=1.6/gal gasoline.  I think it would be around $1/gal (fuel only) if NH3 were enabled and cars had my engine at 4x economy.  NH3 will force low fossil fuel prices + demand.
By going with NH3 at $1/gal e and getting 4x economy,  you save 4 x 2.4= 9.6 x.  1/9.6=.1  or about 90% of the costs.  Like buying fuel at Costco at 24 c/gal e vs $2.4/gal e now.  How long would the line be?
By putting engine in old car you get 4x economy.  If fuel is now $2.4/gal it would be like buying fuel for 60 cent/gal in terms of miles.  Just go to a Costco and see how many people are there to save 5 c/gal.  Imagine if they saved $1.8/gal from a $2.4/gal price.  Long line!
At 100 mpg vs 25 mpg (4x) and $1/gal e NH3, the fuel at 2 cents/mile road tax would be $3/gal, with road tax $2 and fuel 1.  Road tax is 2/3rd the cost.  At 200 mpg e road tax would be $4/gal and $1 fuel.  4/5th road tax.  Flying will have no road tax. Flying will be the future.
@LadyRedWave @POTUS Most of congress needs to be 25th.  They are mostly crazy, corrupt, insane or all three.  The problem is the judges are worse.
@Itches657 Is this what "carbon footprint" means?  Crazy stuff.  First off, the residence time of CO2 is only 10 months when you frequency analyzed Mauna Loa CO2 data.  Also, CO2 is in saturation at 400 ppm.  Adding more just lower the height to extinction.  https://t.co/L9PbghbEo9

@dr_tonyiton @HumanImpact_HIP @BMSG No need for 95% of anything California is doing.  My engine systems can get people to zero carbon ASAP.  CA's plan will prolong it and cost massive waste fraud and abuse of the environment.  Just give it a rest.  Nobody buys it....
My solar panels are mostly glass and metal, all of which can be recycled and is not toxic.  Not so with PV panels and their complex processes. https://t.co/q52onAK1Ge
With my engine this would not be needed or happen. https://t.co/f4uB9eap4A
@Itches657 I would guess like most things, my engine can get 90% of the carbon out with 10% of the effort, and 90% of the effort will be the last 10% of the carbon.  Energy will be distributed via solar and NH3, and cost a function of maintenance.  Clearly a market for NH3 would be made.
@Itches657 I will need to study this out more to get a better look at this.   Anything that uses carbon fuels now, including airplanes, could be zero carbon.  Rockets too.  Bio fuels could be substituted that are neutral.  Electro-chemicals could be made.  The last 5% will be hardest.
@Itches657 Yes, I need to think about this a little more.  No house, car, truck, boat, airplane, heavy equipment, farmer's tractor/combine or factory would use "carbon" fuels if they wanted to.  Plastics would be "captured" unless burned, and human food would be neutral.  Great question....
In Germany the road tax is 8 c/mile.  If you can get 100 mpg on NH3, your costs would be $1/gal fuel and 8 road tax, total $9/gal e.  If you ran on electricity at 30 c/kwh cost would be $10/gal + $4/gal battery, + 8 road tax = $22/gal.  22c/mile.  Fly for 4 c/mile.  0.22/.04=5.5
Imagine if every house or apartment in the Europe were to get my engine system.  They would not use the grid and would bypass it.  They would make their own fuel and run cars with NH3.  The EU would outlaw it for some reason.  Yes, only solution to zero carbon would be outlawed.
The cost of electricity in Denmark where the most wind energy is is now around 42 cents/kwh.  42/3=14.  That is MORE than 3x what USA pays.  Solar can be made for 1.5 c/kwh at the plant.  Coal 1.8.  You are just paying scam fees to well connected thieves.  Make it yourself.
Energy is 25% of your pay.  Cut out 80% of energy costs and you get at least a 20% pay increase.  My engine systems can do that and more.  The grid will just cost you more, and electric cars will make you dependent on grid.  Remember what Obama said....necessarily triple costs.
How fast do you think people would switch to zero carbon energy when it was free between overhauls and less than $1/gal with economy 4 x current cars, for an 8 times advantage over gasoline and Otto engine cars?  A day?  2 hours to read the info?  Unplug CO2, unplug a lot of bad.
@Greenpeace If there is no more time, then you need my engine systems and solar make NH3.  Fastest way to get to zero carbon.  Read tweets.  No need for wind.  Just solar on houses and building and my engine in cars, airplanes, boats, trucks, trains etc.  Happy to discuss.  If not, stop it.
@magastorybook How to solve the CO2 issue and oil?  My engine running on NH3 (Ammonia).  The grid needs energy storage and NH3 is the fuel.  Cheaper than gasoline to make.  Needs new engine.  Make NH3 via solar on house.  Use 5 fuels and NH3 in car.  Read tweets. Don't need any "deal" from AOC
With 8 motors, and the ability to run on just 2, the airplane can have a motor failure and continue to fly with the motor on the opposite side shut off.  This will be a "normal" operation if desired.  This allows a flight to continue where it would otherwise have to stop.
Since the system is made up of many motors and parts that are the same, they can be taken out one by one and exchanged.  This allows the airplane to be used while each part is zero timed/overhauled.    This avoids costly down time during scheduled maintenance.
With an extra motor, the airplane can be overhauled one motor at a time and still remain in use.  Take one out, put in spare, keep flying.  Do the overhaul and swap out next motor until all have been done.  Swap takes 30 minutes or less.  No down time for airplane.  Swap = key.
If you don't have fuel costs now nor engine costs, you can fly for "free" until the maintenance comes due.  The question then is the maintenance costs and intervals.  Due to the nature of the engine, it can be overhauled in piece wise.  Buy an extra motor and swap it out.....&gt;
What is nice is you don't have to pay ANYTHING NOW.  Fill up for 4-5 years, pay nothing and then take a weekend and a few hundred dollars and overhaul the motors.  Skip a few hotels and it covers fuels costs!  Sleep in airplane instead.  Travel will become very cheap.
You can't get to "free energy" via grid or with a battery due to the high costs.  Battery is $4/gal e and grid is $4/gale, or $8/gale total.  NH3 in terms of maintenance costs can cost $1/gal e or less for NH3.  With 4x fuel economy that is like 8x better than gasoline cars now.
If you have "free" energy, your equipment will take a maintenance cost.   Making NH3 at home via Solar thermal that can last 100 years (not PV)  can be very cheap.  This is basically the "free energy" that people have been  wanting.  Are you awake?
If you look at page11 the cost/kg for production is 22 cents/kg.  	NH3=5.166 kw-hr/kg.  $0.22 x kg/5.166  x 33.7 = $1.43/gal e to gasoline or 48 c/gal NH3.  If you make it at home, it is "free" until you pay for maintenance in several years, which might cost you $0.50-1.0/gal e.
@PaulEDawson Paul, getting to zero carbon requires steps.  My tweets list them.  Cheaper than current technology.  I have a valid solution to get to zero carbon ASAP.  Happy to discuss....
Went to a soccer tournament.  400 miles away.  That would have been 2 hrs at 200 mph in airplane each way, one day.  Fly there, do games, fly home.  Fuel (NH3) would have costs me $30, $60 gasoline.  No hotel.  But it took three days, 15 hrs driving, hotel,  $600.  Understand?
Notice below that it only takes 10.85 HP at 70 mph and 60% to get 200 mpg.  At 35 mph, 0nly 2.7 HP.  The key here is to be able to use very little power and maintain efficiency.  Big engine and little power = poor fuel economy.  My engine solves this problem.  Get mega economy.
To drive down the road at 70 mph at 100 mpg takes 21.7 hp at 60%.  At 35  mph it takes 5.42 hp.  2x mpg takes 1/2.  2.7 hp for 35 mph is less  than the heat on cold day.  Idle car burn 1/2 gal/ hr.  Like 15.5 hp at  60%.  Drive 62 mph and get 140 for that much fuel!
Compare electric car, to old gasoline car.		Electric.  522/.75=696		Old Otto car: 243.8/.2=1219		1219/696=1.75 x more for Otto car.  		New engine in old car (100 mpg)?  1219/325=3.75 ... Double is 7.5		1/3.75=26.6%	1/7.5=13.3%		1-.266=73%	1-.133=86%	Meets IPCC goal of 80% in 2050
The key is you can be zero carbon personally with house power and NH3, whereas the grid will take 30-50 years to be zero carbon.  If time is key, my engine is the best solution by far (10-100x?) over what electric cars can provide.  Quick to zero carbon grid and cars both.
To be fair to me, I would have to have a completely new car design just like Tesla and other electric cars have.   200 mpg my new car vs electric at 100 mpge.  With the advantages expressed as they are in electric, the result is over 8 times more CO2 for Electric cars vs my tech.
During cold and hot city driving, the numbers can double.  		1.71x2=3.42	2.14x2=4.28		In city driving on cold/hot days, electric car will be 3.42-4.28 x my engine in old car.		Double again with new engine and new car:		6.84-8.56 x CO2 for electric car in USA.  Understand?
Example:  		Electric car in USA is 75% eff.  Grid 522.  522/.75=696	My car on gasoline at 60%.  243.8/.6=406.  at 75%?  325		Electric car will use 696/406=1.71 x MORE than my car at lowest efficiency, and 696/325=2.14.  From 1.71 and 2.14 times MORE CO2 for electric car in USA.
Once you have the g CO2/kw-h for each machine + fuel at efficiency you know what it costs in CO2 to get the electricity.  Then divide that by the car efficiency and compare that to actual power for speed and distance.  Got that?
To figure what each fuel would make in g CO2/kw-h all you do is take the 100% efficiency value below (Diesel 250.2) and divide it by the actual efficiency.  Diesels worked well are around 42% at best.  250.2/.42= 595.7 g CO2/kw-h.  Coal 353/.38=930 and so on.
EIA data for CO2lbs/million BTU.  Gasoline = 115000 BTU=33.7 kw-h	Conversion factor to g/kw-h is 1.5511 ,100%	Coal 205-228 = 318-354 g/kw-h	Diesel 161.3 = 250.2  g/kw-h	Gasoline 157.2 = 243.8  g/kw-h	Propane 139 =215.6  g/kw-h	Nat Gas 117 = 181.5  g/kw-h		https://t.co/gZnE0Y3BTw
Put another way with respects to Denmark, by having my engine instead of electric cars, we get to lower CO2 output than electric cars without all the high electrical costs that Denmark has.  I say sue the heck out of Denmark grid!!!
Notice that Denmark which has electrical rates at 42 c/kwh ($14.15/gal e) has only been able to get to 360 gCO2/kw-h.  At 100 mpg (drop in new engine to old car, par to electric car in efficiency) my car is 264 vs and electric grid car at 360.  264/360 = 73%.  At 200 mpg, 36.5%
g CO2/kw-hr for various grids:	Poland 781	USA 522	Germany 460	Mexico 454	Japan 416	Denmark 360	Canada 180	France 49	Norway 16		Europe 290		My car at 264/2 =132.		Only Norway and France less.  Hydro and Nuclear.  Denmark, with all the wind mills - 360.  		https://t.co/WX0vLCliie
So, with either gasoline or Diesel in my new car with new engine at 200 mpg vs electric car (Tesla) at 100 mpg e, the CO2 would be 29% or 3.44 times LESS CO2 than an electric car on the grid.   Houston, the green movement is more like a bowl movement...full of crap.
Note, the EPA's figures are	Gasoline : 8887g /gallon gasoline = 8887 g/ 33.7 kw-h/gal = 263.7 g/ kw-h	Diesel: 10180 g / gallon Diesel = 10180 g / 38 kw-h/gal = 267.9 g/ kw-h		Looks close from a CO2/energy basis. Hmmm.		https://t.co/TE0jR30ZeG
So, my engine in new car would be 29% of the CO2 of an electric car running on the grid.  That is 3.44 times LESS CO2 for my car running on gasoline than an electric car running on the grid.  At par, 1/.58=1.72 times more.  Between 1.72 and 3.44 times LESS CO2.  Understand?
If you buy an electric car, you suck off the grid at 454 g/kw-hr.  		263 gCo2/kwh for gasoline.  My engine is par to electric, so my engine would be 263/454 = 58% of electric car.  		If I had new car w 200 mpg, it would be 1/2 58%=29% of the CO2 of electric car, all on gasoline. https://t.co/0zSTNvYFG6
Once my engine R&amp;D is done and production line set up, you can get to zero carbon by buying products.  But if you wait for the grid, it will take "decades" as the EU said recently.  That means 20-30 years.  2050?  No airplanes, no track hoes, boats, ships etc.  What a JOKE!
This scam of CO2, for which I have possibly the only viable solution at this point, was started in Kyoto with the 80% carbon reduction goal.  By putting my engine in a car, we can meet that goal IMMEDIATELY with gasoline.  No waiting needed, except for my engine to be installed.
If someone were honest and serious about getting carbon out of the system, would they not realize that a renewable energy source (sun, wind) is intermediate and needs some way to store it?  Would they not realize that NH3 is the easiest way?  Clearly they would, if honest....&gt;
You can get to zero carbon immediately with my systems, but you cannot with PV and batteries because you cannot bridge the gaps of renewables not working, such as in winter in MOST of the USA.  Back up gensets run carbon fuels, not NH3.  Battery won't last long enough by 100 x.
Once my engine system for house is done and your vehicle has my engine in it. you can be zero carbon immediately by just buying the vehicle and house system.  You don't need $49 trillion in grid nonsense for zero carbon.  YOU can start with YOU and not worry what government says.
The current content of carbon on the grid is 454 g/kwh.  You can make  NH3 from CH4 for 416 g/kwh!  Understand?  The EU claims they will be  using Natural Gas for many decades.  Why?  Because they don't care about  zero carbon, as they claim. CO2 is a scam.  All about control + $
@PSEGNews Want to get to zero carbon ASAP?  Can't do it via grid and batteries.  NO WAY. 30 years+.  You can with my engine systems in house, cars, trucks, airplane, boats, ships and more.  Works anywhere.  Independent.  When NH3 cheaper than 5 old fossil fuels...switch.  Zero Carbon!
@FredKrupp All of the renewable energy can come from factories, houses, commercial building, which make NH3 and sell it at $1/gal, less than gasoline/Diesel.  No need for carbon tax which will SLOW path to zero carbon. This is obvious folks.  Don't need wind/solar farms, but can use via NH3
@FredKrupp You can go to zero carbon in short order.  How?  My engine (or similar) with NH3 made from renewables.  The grid needs energy storage and NH3 will be the fuel.  That fuel then runs in cars or grid turbines.  But first we need new engine that can run 5 fuels and NH3.  Simple....
Car companies have bought into the cult of CO2 and are going electric even though it will SLOW the move to zero CO2 and raise costs dramatically for customers and strand them to the grid.  The grid needs NH3.  Batteries won't work for storing massive energy.  Combustion key.
@secretstranger9 @NeonNettle A Bishop should be the husband of one wife, not a 1000 gay men....
Gamble?  Yes.  It shows VW is not clued into what is needed to go zero carbon.  The future is flying and batteries are much too heavy and electrics don't have boundary layer control.  Much more expensive.  My engine could put them out of business quick if I can get some backing. https://t.co/LEiKbiHaHY
@EcoInternetDrGB That is not a smart move.  NH3 is what the grid needs to store renewable energy.  NH3 via my engine can also use all existing fuels and NH3.  When NH3 is less than gasoline, zero carbon.  Grid will not be zero carbon for a LONG time.  Ask EU folk.  My engine 1/8th fuel cost of E.
@SenSanders @sunrisemvmt Bernie, I already tweeted you that you can be zero carbon ASAP by new engine and NH3.  Stop and learn before  you speak and make a fool of yourself.  Read my tweets.
@kimi_collins @GretaThunberg My engine can get you all to zero carbon ASAP.  Stop the worry.
@JeffreyGuterman @AOC Why would you do that?  Weak in your views?
My engine in truck can have large and small motors.  Large for high power and at least one small motor to give micro power in the 1-10 hp range where a truck does poor.  My engine has no fuel loss during stop or slow down where a Diesel still has to idle to provide instant power.
My engine would get 3x city over old Diesel because it maintains efficiency down to very low power use.  A truck only needs 75 HP at 35, vs 248 hp at highway speeds.  BSFC drops to about 2x below 50% power for Diesel.  My engine does not.  Economy goes UP w city driving, not down
My truck would have 1500 HP to climb at 80 MPH and to accelerate close to regular cars acceleration rates.  This way the truck does not block or slow traffic.  Braking recovery would be 100%, and City driving would be MUCH better than Nikola with 3x over old Diesel.
Climb at 65 MPH at 1000 HP, cruise at 200 HP and charge batteries with 200 HP after climb.  Climb power 600 HP from battery.  3:1 ratio.  Every minute of climb takes takes 3 minutes of charging.  Brake recover is less than 50% on Electrics, mine 100%. My system is so much better!
Notice that the Nikola has a 300 kw fuel cell.  300/.746= 402 HP.  Claimed 1000 HP drives.  The battery has to produce 600 HP or 60% of the power during full climb up grade.  It might take  ~  200 HP (250 HP old Diesel) at 65 mph on flat, or about 50% of fuel cell power.
Basically, If I were to take the same envelope as a Nikola I would have 900 gallons of volume for fuel.  		12 mpg on Diesel x 900 = 10800 mile range vs Nikola at 1200 miles.  9:1 more range with my engine system.  1 magnitude of order different!  OUCH.
I would guess that a NIkola has to have around ~ 900 gallons of volume to contain the LH2 and batteries.  Hard to tell.  No wonder it looks "pregnant" or bloated.  It needs over 3x volume to contain systems.  My engine is par to electric motors systems or less in drive volume...&gt;
Notice that Nikola has to have 400 gallon LH2 tanks, and batteries worth 9.5 gallons, which take up 34 gallon to 1 of Diesel.  9.5 x 34 = 323 gallon volume for batteries.  Grand total in volume is 400 + 323 = 723 gallons volume for batteries and LH2, not counting cryo stuff.  ???
If I cleaned up truck and offer a new truck fully tricked out, I think I could get 18 mpg.  That is 3x over current Diesel trucks at 80,000 lbs and 65 mph.  That would make the tanks size THE SAME volume for NH3 as an old Diesel with Diesel fuel.  This is the end game, on ground
During the first few years of my engine in truck, NH3 will NOT be available at lots of station.  		Diesel 1/2 economy of new engine.  Fuel volume D to NH3 3.3.  	To match Diesel with NH3 I need ~ 1.5 time more volume of NH3 fuel.  		240 x 1.5 =360	300 x 1.5 =450		Tanks 360-450 OK
My engine in truck would be around 2x fuel economy on average due to braking recovery and 3x city.  		Range in miles?	300 gal in old D=1800.  New engine x 2 =3600 w D = 1200 w NH3.  	Nikola LH2 is 3/4 energy/volume = 400 gallons of L H2 = 300 NH3.  		400 gal=4800 w D; 1600 w NH3
Fuel capacity of Diesel truck is 100 city, 240-280 gallons, sometimes over 300 gallons over the road.		100 x 6 mpg = 600 	240 x 6 mpg = 1440	280 x 6 mpg = 1680	300 x 6 mpg = 1800		1440-1800 mile range with plentiful Diesel stations.  		Nikola 1200 miles on scarce H2.
NH3 vs Diesel.		10722/3194 = 3.35.  		NH3 vs gasoline		9500/3194 = 2.97 ~3.		NH3 vs Liquid H2		2359/3194 = .74		3 to 3.3 more volume for NH3 vs liquid fossil fuels.  ~1/3 range on NH3.		1200 miles NH3 = 3600 miles gasoline = 4000 miles Diesel.  		New engine 60-75% vs 42% Diesel.
The best way to store HUGE amounts of grid energy is NH3, NOT H2.  This is clear and obvious to anybody.  The grid will need NH3 and NH3 will become the fuel that runs cars, trucks, and airplanes...when it is cheaper/energy than diesel or gasoline.  Already is cheaper than Jet A
Notice Nikola uses Liquid H2.  Why not NH3?  Compare WH/L...		NH3 = 3194  No cryogenic cooling.  Lighter tanks	L H2 = 2359 requires cryogenic cooling. Heavier tanks. 		3194/2359 = 1.35		Tanks vs fuel weight would be close. 		I predict they go NH3 in future as grid makes NH3. https://t.co/CMcxvIYTS2
@rancherman61 Click on the side for the fuel comparison ratios.  Nikola uses LIQUID H2, not Compressed H2.  Liquid H2 is 2359 wh/l vs 10722 for Diesel.  10722/2359 = 4.55 more volume for H2 than Diesel.  Hence the large tanks.  Compressed (3600 PSI) H2 is 532... 10722/532 = 20  Won't work.
Doing a little "competitive" assessment here with my engine in truck vs a Nikola.  Summary.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Much cheaper, 1/2 the empty weight (20k vs 10k), 50% more power (1500 hp vs 1000 for Nikola) and fuel (NH3 or Diesel) that can fit in tanks that weigh much less.
The Nikola battery weighs 4000 lbs and can only drive truck 62 miles from 80-20% charge, or from 100% to 0% (damage?) 104 miles.  		4000/8.25 gal eD = 448 lbs/gal e to Diesel.  Diesel is 7 lbs/gal.  448/7=64:1.		The Battery simply replaces the Diesel engine in weight.
Nikola:  Notice 320 Kwh battery pack.  How much energy?  320/33.7= 9.5 gal e to gasoline.  About 8.25 gal e to Diesel.  		Diesel truck can go 7 mpg x 8.25 = 58 miles on that.		Electric?  	Assume 75% vs 42% Diesel.  75/42 x 58 =104 mile.		But battery only 20-80%.&gt; .6 x 104=62 mile
Nikola truck is a fuel cell truck using H2.  They claim 1000 HP and 2x acceleration.  No weight advantage over old Diesel trucks.  Lots of problems here, big times.  Should I point out the obvious?  		https://t.co/OnnadDXVnU
@DbroncoDave David, great comment.  You can't "fill up" a battery with a plastic 5 gallon can and a ride to the fuel station and back.  The battery concept is the problem, not just the weight, cost, and risks of fire.  It requires towing when you run out of "fuel" somewhere.  NOT good.
There are then two paths to using NH3.  		1) my engine via combustion which is Inexpensive and high performance,		or		2) PV panels + fuel cells, which are very expensive, low performance, requiring batteries for surge loads, and electric motors and controllers.  		Cost ratio 1:8+
So, from these tweets, it is clear that zero carbon is possible via my new combustion engine and NH3 made by it and solar on house.  		PV panels can also make NH3 and use it via fuel cells in house or car.  They are much more expensive than my engine and require batteries too.
@josephofyahuah @drifterceptor I want the engine to enable my roadable seaplane. The fuel economy is 3x better than a turboprop (60-75% vs 21% for turboprop like P&amp;W 6A).  NH3 made from house is "like" free energy.  Already need NH3 system and made NH3 from house is free between maintenance.  See tweets below.
@josephofyahuah @drifterceptor By having an engine like mine, everybody who wants to be zero carbon can, and those who want MORE CO2 can.  In fact we all could go zero carbon for a year and see what happens.  Run everything with NH3, see effect.  If none, then we will know a fraud occurred and Gore pays.
@josephofyahuah @drifterceptor Joe, YES!  I agree.  If I could TRIPLE CO2, I would.  You can use fossil fuels with my engine and will until NH3 is CHEAPER than the lowest cost fossil fuel (likely Propane or gasoline).   But why pay more, UNLESS you want the CO2 for a greenhouse or something useful?
Both sides don't realize that with NH3 and my systems, most people can supply all the fuel they need from  their house or factory.  They don't need Neither coal, oil or NG on the one side, nor Wind and PV farms on the other.  Both side's products are OBSOLETE.  Both are wrong.
Both sides of the debate are misinformed and don't understand reality.    		The PRO CO2 side thinks we need fossil fuels to run stuff and has not discovered NH3 and electro-chemicals.  		The CON CO2 side wants to ban combustion, which is the best way to get to zero carbon ASAP.

On the side against more CO2, AOC wants combustion banned.  But combustion via my engine (or similar) is the only known/viable means to allow all fossil fuels and NH3 to be used in ONE engine system.  Get engine in all vehicles/buildings, then switch to NH3.  100% zero C.
Both sides of the CO2 debate don't understand what is possible or where the technology needs to go.  		Conservative side: Notice in A Jones article that they don't realize that NH3 can be made from wind/solar used in farm tractors, trucks, ships and more.  https://t.co/A58BBaXsbc
@Tech01Audio @BrentBozell I need the engine to do my seaplane.  Won't be allowed.

So, the problem of "climate change" and CO2 can be distilled down to something 10 inches long and 5 inches in diameter, about 25-30 lbs...my motor, that you can hold in your hand.   The rest is already done for the most part.  Wow, I can save us all $48.99999 trillion dollars.
All jesting aside, this talk of CO2 is like Dems vs Repubs.  It is designed to waste our time and give the illusion of choice.  		If NH3 can be made for less than gasoline and an engine can run NH3 along with other fuels, as well as do solar thermal, then the problem is solved.

Wow, it will be snowing for 4-5 days.  Solar and battery would not work.  Would need some of that NH3 to bridge this thermal reality of snow, which is at RECORD levels.  Which would be more fun?  Shut up Al Gore and gang, or flying around the world in my seaplane for a year?  Hmm

Read the pinned tweet.  Nobody sane discloses "top secret" tech on a twatter feed.  Do you have something to offer quid pro quo other than your opinion?  Yes or no?
It just so happens that I can solve the CO2 problem.  You help me, I help you.  That saying Quid pro quo as the Bush folk liked to say.  Maybe I should shut up myself, solve it and then sue the daylights out of all these people top to bottom.  Maybe a good old spanking is needed!
Look folks, I don't care about lowering CO2.  That is not my motive, other than to stop the nonsense talk about CO2.  My goal is a cool high performance seaplane I can travel the world in at costs unheard of.  It is a lifestyle thing for me, not some "save the planet" crusade...&gt;
One would think that if someone said I will solve your problem to shut your mouth, that they would be jumping to help out.  It is like a mother saying she will clean the child's diaper if child agrees to stop crying! https://t.co/92999nBXGG
Is there anybody out there in twitter land that has the courage of their convictions, either pro CO2 or against CO2?  		Either way we win with my engine.  My goal is to get the engine done to use it in my seaplane.  If NH3 is cheaper, I use it.  If not I use gasoline or propane.
Sorry, but enough is enough.  If you want to get to zero carbon, then either help me get there, or do it yourself.  Don't tax me to pay for your scam "research" projects that enrich you at my expense.  Deal? https://t.co/92999nBXGG
Literally the claim of the AGW CO2 alarmists who say the world is doomed in 12 years is that we are screwed forever if we don't get off CO2 ASAP.  		I have had enough of this CO2 fraud.  I say we go to zero carbon to shut their stupid mouths up.  Who will help me out?
My solution does not need government other than for them to get out of the way.  I don't build products that kill, so get off my back, OK?  Amazing arrogance....		The other solutions enslave you and drive costs up.  With me, costs go to "free energy" as it were.  		Free or slave?
So, what we lack is a vision of how to get to zero carbon.  		AOC and the Dems have socialism, $49 trillion in spending for junk technology, and lots of control on how cows fart.  Don't human and all animals fart too?  I digress...		My solution sets us all free....Interested?
So, what is stopping us from getting to a zero carbon?  		My engine technology and systems, OR SIMILAR (read so you don't think I think I know it all, ok?).  I don't have a lock on inventing!  I just have some really cool concepts that should solve the problem and a vision.

Why not go directly there and stop arguing about CO2?  NH3  can be cheaper than oil or coal, systems wise.  I love coal and some family lives in coal town.  Not needed anymore with my tech.  Read tweets.
@Shilohv1955 The grid will NEED to make NH3 to STORE wind/solar energy when the getting is good, and then use NH3 when not so good.  Turbines will then burn the NH3 to provide power when renewable sources are on vacation.  Cars then can use the NH3 too if they have proper engine.
@BorgmanKelly @TAGOS22 Current Otto engines are 10% city and 20% highway efficiency...  If my engine can be 60-75% then on highway you can get over 3x and in city 5-6 x.  This allows NH3 to be used without larger fuel volume due to NH3 needing 3x volume to gasoline / energy.
@BorgmanKelly @TAGOS22 To get to NH3 you need engines that can use old fuels and NH3.  None exist.  NH3 is difficult to burn with old engine designs.  50:1 compression ratios lead to high NOx and no other fuel use.  My engine solves this problem, thus allowing both carbon and no carbon fuels.
@BorgmanKelly @TAGOS22 Yes, electricity must come from somewhere.  This issue is dealing with crazy people who want to use CO2 to control us.  I say get the CO2 out via NH3.  In the mean time, my engine would get 75% of the fuel gone in car by getting 100 mpg (just like electric cars do) instead of 25.
@TrailBum2 @TAGOS22 Current costs are 12 cents/kwh.  I calculated it here somewhere.
@Shilohv1955 If you think CO2 is good, like I do (greens the plant...triple it if I could...) then you benefit the planet by buying one of 5 fossil fuels.  If you think CO2 is the bane/doom of the world, then you go solar, make NH3, and run NH3.  Soon, NH3 is available at station....
@Shilohv1955 Yes, great question.  You bring a long extension cord maybe?  Kidding here.   Fuel is needed to get to 100% renewable for a person.  NH3 is that fuel.  An engine that can run any fuel plus NH3 would allow all people to believe what they want about CO2 and feel good about it.
@TAGOS22 Wow, I guessed originally pretty close at $42k.  Hmmm.   The question is whether you would invest $6k into 10 year old car or not.  My car you just keep driving until you crash it....
@TAGOS22 Current costs of LI-ion batteries are 12 cents/kw-h to use them.  		150,000 miles/100 mpg e=1500 gal equiv to gasoline.  		33.7 kwhr/gal e 	1500x33.7=50,550 kwh used.  		Cost: 50,550 kwh x $0.12 c/kwh = $6066.  	Electricity at 12 is also $6066	Total $12,132		$30k + $12 = $42k
@rancherman61 My car engine fuel tanks remain at near constant pressure, +-,  and therefore have an "infinite" life cycle due to no cyclic loading.  That allows the car to be driving for 40,000 hours x 25 mph= 1 million miles.  1 million miles/15,000 miles/year = 66.6 years...beastly!
Again, which would you buy?		My engine run on solar made NH3 (zero carbon, no smog) or an electric car run on various carbon fuels, wind and solar via grid and a battery?  Same costs.		Clearly most people would select my car and engine due to the many advantages of my engine.
@Tech01Audio @BrentBozell Why?  If GM does not want it and Ford does, GM goes out of business, assuming they are not colluding cartels owned by the same entity.  If big oil tries to crush Ford, then Ford gets into making NH3 and voids the need for oil.  Several other ways to "unplug" this extortion stuff.
Which would you rather do?		Buy a car for $30,000 and pay $15,000 for fuel over 150,000 miles 		or		Buy an electric car at $42,000 (less than $45,000 to cover interest on the $15,000 over time...same present value!) and I let you charge your car for "free" anywhere?  		Same costs
The question then is how you like to pay and how much for a performance....  Electric cars trick people into buying them due to the battery being actually part of the operating costs and not the purchase price.  If it costs $4/gal e to use the battery.  It is prepaid fuel costs.&gt;
A free energy machine only cuts out the fuel costs of operating the machine, but does not cut out the operating  and maintenance costs.  Any "free energy" machine will, of course, cost you MORE money to BUY than a non free energy machine in a "free" market.  You pay either way.
Two kinds of costs to use a machine.  Operating costs and maintenance costs.  		Operating costs are known costs, like fuel, oil, tires, brakes, etc.		Maintenance costs are uncertain or unexpected, such as overhauls, failed part, damaged panel, etc.  Stuff happens, fix it....&gt;
So, the cost of a "free energy" machine is the life cycle costs, X price/Y years, plus the average yearly maintenance costs Z.  		So, X/Y + Z is the cost of "free energy" as it were, whether from my system or Nikola Tesla's mythical machine suppressed by "them" or whomever....&gt;
The question is, what would Tesla's "free energy" machine cost you to maintain it?  Clearly something, as everything breaks down and needs repairs.  My system, once paid for, also has a cost of maintenance.  Add in the life cycle costs.  Buy for X, lasts for Y years, X/Y= cost..&gt;
One of the nice things about this is that it is about as close to the mythical notion of "FREE ENERGY" that people claim Tesla was going to give us.  		To access this energy (NH3 or Tesla's) you need a device that costs money.  Once you pay for the machine, it costs to maintain.&gt;
How about My engine with solar thermal making NH3 for $1/gal and get the same economy as an electric car.  		That make an 8:1 ratio for costs of Electric/Otto cars vs my engine in old car.  		Why pay 8 times MORE per mile for less performance?  		You like giving your money away?
@AOC AOC, why do I need to read more?  I have the solution to CO2.  Once the technology is available for sale, it will take 1 month to get you zero carbon.  For car, 5 minutes to sign papers.  Easy as lemon pie.  Interest?  BTW, it goes in airplanes too.  No trains needed.
@AOC AOC, you want to get us all to zero carbon ASAP, all you need is my engine system and NH3 maker.  Done.  1 month and we can all be zero carbon.  Just that simple.  Interested?
@EdwinLo31339753 @realDonaldTrump It was a Witch (Hillary) hunt, not a Warlock (Trump) hunt.
@RyanMaue Ryan, why are you wasting your time?  Why not focus on SOLVING the CO2 problem like I am?  My engine + Solar + NH3 maker can get you to zero carbon for houses, cars, airplanes, boats, factories, heavy equipment, farm tractors and more.  Anything that needs power...zero Carbon.
@philritz1 Less than current Otto/Diesel/Turbine/hybrid or electric +battery by a lot.  Happy to discuss.
@seanhannity Hannity, want to know how to unplug the CO2 debate?  This is the hottest topic and I have the only real solution that both sides can agree on.  My engine systems and NH3 gets us to 100-200 mpg e on $1/gal e fuel that is zero Carbon, but still can use 5 fuels.  Interested?
@BrentBozell They are going to cry even harder when they find out how easy it is so get to zero carbon with my engine, that can also you 5 fossil fuels.  No more CO2 debate needed!  Wow, No oil mafia or CO2 mafia.  Just 100-200 mpg on $1/gal e NH3 fuel.  Like driving for free....
@GenChuckYeager Want to work on the coolest new airplane on the planet?  Discuss?

My engine is how you unplug this theft of freedom by taking CO2 off the table.  If someone thinks CO2 is good, then use fossil fuels.  If not, then use NH3.  Choice.  Not force.
@philritz1 Phil, All good and well, but not important.  Why so?  My engine + solar + NH3 maker gets you to ZERO CARBON for your house, car, airplane, boat, ATV and factory.  No worries about CO2.  Just need the right technology.  Can't get there with wind and PV panels and grid.

@IncarnatedET What if a Moslem KKK member were to endorse her...  Would her head explode like some green Martian.
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 My engine could clean up China very quickly.  Funny how no Chinese people ask me any questions?  Not that I would want to work with people who killed 80 million of their own people, but so did abortionist kill 50 million Americans.  Crazy world we live in.
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 I also don't car what any "regulator" says as this will not violate any known rules as far as I know.  The pols will adapt to the new reality this system presents them.  No more bribes to get the CO2 out or maintain oil kickbacks or whatever they get.  Don't care.  Independent...
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 I want the CO2 issue OFF THE TABLE.  How?  SOLVE the problem.  How?  My engine + solar thermal + thermal storage + NH3 maker + tanks.  I can make ME be zero carbon.  If so, then you can, then your neighbor, sister, brother and so on.... Don't care what electric company says....
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 That is a lot of views to keep track of.  Funny, if all that effort were directed to my engine, the entire discussion would be....MUTE.  All I want is three smart Mechanical engineers to help me get it done.  Problem solved.  If you solve CO2 and we can all stop fighting.  No?
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Thanks.  First person to say that.  Lots of effort (10,000+ hours) has gone into coming up with this engine.  I have to make sure I am "grounded" in "reality" and not my bias, otherwise I can go bankrupt...my wife won't like that! LOL.
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 I will read it and comment....stay tuned.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom And you too in what you are doing...  Thanks for the chat.  Your questions help when people read what we talk about and perhaps I can find the right people....  Take care...
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Me too.  But that is not the motive of a lot of people like AOC and Al Gore and "green" movements.   CO2 means the world is doomed and so on.  Other people like more CO2 and want oil to continue.  Costs are key to me.  NH3 gets me zero costs for long periods between overhauls.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Good question.  Do you?  Does it matter?  NO  That is the point.  It does not matter.  You can benefit with either belief or view about CO2.  We both end up with a cleaner environment pushed by different motives, whatever they are.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom No, not at all.  First users of cell phone do the same.  They love the tech so they are willing to pay much more than others.  People who want CO2 out will likely be first buyers, etc.  This happens in every market.  I will too just to be "independent" of oil and grid...
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Exactly.  I meet you CO2 goals (I assume to think CO2 is a problem...) and I meet my independence, cost and seaplane goals with the SAME engine.  Remember, the engine will be 60-75% vs old cars at 10-20%, so you get many more miles per NH3 gallon over old cars.
@Tokyo_Tom @justinr10519174 Yes, and when everybody has one on their house, the "duck curve" will bottom out and you will get zero for the electricity.  Thus, you then switch to NH3.  But how to use NH3?  My engine allows you to use the solar power via NH3.  8 times better than electric car....
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Exactly, if you think CO2 is an issue (not me), or oil is causing terrorist (me) or crazy cartels (me), or smog (me), then by all means, pay more and feel good about yourself and your care for the environment as YOU see fit.  But now neither of us has this option.  My engine key.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Yes, engine in trucks will fund this to 100's of billions if I can be smart about it.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom His seaplane was not viable and he knew it.  He "flew" it to finish the contract and get paid.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom My motive has zero to do with CO2 reduction.  More CO2 is better in my view.  But not being dependent on oil or subject to Carbon taxes has made me look at NH3.  Now my motive is to get to $1/gal fuel (NH3) that does not require compression to 3600 psi like Natural Gas ($1/gal).
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Yes, a goal, namely my roadable seaplane.  Without that goal this engine would NOT have been invented.  To make my roadable seaplane I needed a new engine TYPE as different as a jet is to a piston engine.  Long discussion...but the motive drives the direction of R&amp;D.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom My costs of flying my airplane after I have the solar and NH3 paid off it the cost of maintenance intervals.  Every 5 years I spend a few hundred $ and zero time the system.  Fuel is "free" between intervals.  I have then "free flying" in MY mind.  Like driving and never paying.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom I think that in the end, NH3 will become CHEAPER than gasoline/Diesel/Jet A/propane and thus will replace those fuels.  N2 is 78% of air.  Solar can be cheaper than Nat Gas.  Independence tells me to use NH3.  Why buy when you can have it "free" between maintenance intervals.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Yes I do care about politics.  Don't force someone to do what you want....  Simple.  If you want to go zero carbon because you thing CO2 is bad or hurting us, then I offer you a way to do that.  You duty is done.  If someone loves CO2, then let them use fuels and don't force it.
@justinr10519174 Yes, fuel is the best store because it can be "refilled" by a truck.  A battery cannot.  I can store a year's fuel in a tank in my backyard.  No way in battery and if I need more, you can't fill up the batter without a battery truck....very very heavy.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Don't follow, sorry.  You lost me...
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Flying is the motive for me.  Flying at 12-25k feet does not cause issues with my super quiet props, which are key to roadable airplanes.  Make it quiet or don't make it...
@justinr10519174 Goal was to take my wife with me to Hawaii in the airplane you see on twitter avatar picture.  Too much fuel weight.  How to cut load?  Then I slowly worked and worked and after many many hours and concepts, I came onto something that can solve our energy problems.
@justinr10519174 Crown Jewel?  Is the eye more important than the ear, or the leg?  It is part of a SYSTEM.  Your body has storage.  You can fast for weeks if you had to.  Energy storage is universal in all creatures and valid systems.  Having too much, like me, is sometimes not health...LOL.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Once you give people the option of zero carbon in house, cars, and airplane, the crazy people's arguments are toast.  Saying we need trains and no airplanes is total silly nonsense.  Flying is MUCH better than driving, and way better than some 100 year old train nonsense.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Yes, long term because there a base of engines that can use it is needed.  Again, you can use any of 5 fuels C fuels.  You don't need to use NH3 at any times with this engine.  Use fossil fuels all the time as far as I care.  I just want to allow people the option of zero Carbon.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Once the NH3 from old CH4 production means takes off, then start up new electro-NH3 makers by investing.  Understand?  First from old carbon sources, then to zero carbon via wind/solar or house.  Stepped introduction.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Chicken and egg.  If you don't have engines or fuel cells that can use NH3 then who is going to buy it.  If you have a car/house/fuel cell that can use it, but nobody can make it, then what.  First get engine.  Then when enough are running, offer NH3 via old Haber bosch via Ch4.
@justinr10519174 The "costs" are local to my house.  Yes there is a cost of putting a house somewhere.  But once you have a house, adding solar like mine only adds to the look and value.  It does not look like some science project like most PV panels.  Looks cool.  The costs vs using oil are 5%
@justinr10519174 Yes, my engine is 1/8th the cost of electric car, perhaps up to 50:1.  This engine is very cost effective.  It is what I want for my house, cars, and airplane.  If nobody else gets it, ok too.
@justinr10519174 Yes!  Massive costs.  Count the ways!  Bad designs.  I don't like them, but what can I do until I can offer an alternative at less costs?  This is what I am doing, trying to "unplug" all their junk by offering viable stuff.  CO2 is not an issue for me.  Unplugging bad policy it.
@justinr10519174 @Tokyo_Tom Three parts are needed.		1) immediate use of power, thermal or electric	2) short thermal storage with "no" losses.  Hot water for overnight electricity and bridging thermal night/day	3) long term storage - fuel tanks, for MONTHS of energy store.  Has process big losses in and out
@justinr10519174 Remember, the thermal loads of building are 50% of energy use.  Solar thermal is 60-70% capture, whereas PV is only 10-15% and when used with battery 8-12%.  Big difference.  Solar thermal store (hot water tanks) can work with water distillation as synergy, thus cutting more fuel
@justinr10519174 Ask some questions....  I am curious what you have in mind.  There are many "other ways" to do things.  I am open to suggestions and brainstorming it you want to indulge me.
@justinr10519174 My solar on roof is all that is needed, in my view.  What other way do you have in mind?  Wind and solar farms (burns up birds) are not needed.
@justinr10519174 Yes, I want to "unplug" them.  The thing is the Aleutian Islands in AK may be a good place for wind.  Make NH3, tanker it into markets and run the entire USA off it.  Good wind is "Islanded" not connected to grid in most cases.  NH3 voids need for expensive connections. Cheap
@justinr10519174 Going to NH3 looks OK from what I read.  My solution is house/factory/shopping center based, not farms.  Make as much as the roof can make, store excess for winter or sell as fuel.  More than enough with only solar on roofs.  Thermal can gather a lot more energy. 5-6 x
@justinr10519174 Yes!  They KILL birds, take up land, make it look terrible, ruin land around it, and make ultra sound that bugs people.  Not needed, but how can I stop it from where I am now?  If I have a viable solution and can sell it, then maybe I can sue, but that takes serious cash.
Who do you think owns the "grid" and who owns the oil?  Could it be the same cartels?  By going to electric cars you go from $2/gal gasoline to $8/gal electricity and battery.  Same difference.  Electric cars are 4x gasoline cars.  2 x 4 = 8.  No savings, just different scam.
Ever notice that oil companies are on for carbon taxes and such, just like the CO2 crazies?  They both work for the same people.  		Clinton/Gore/Obama = CO2 puppets	Bush/Cheney/Neocons = Oil puppets.		All want war and control		Most people want neither.  		My engine unplugs both.
People don't want the control of the CO2 mafia or the oil mafia.  		The CO2 control freak only want to impose socialism and micro manage every aspect of your life.		The oil mafia wants to jerk you around with oil and all the wars.		Both need to go.  How?  GET RID OF CO2 via NH3
@tedcruz Ted, my engine can take the CO2 off the table.  Want to find out how?  Any politician who does not realize how to unplug the crazy CO2 agenda will not be in office long.  How about you?  BTW, I love CO2, but CO2 is a weapon that needs to be removed from Dems.  How?  Discuss....
@PeterDGardner @thinkprogress No, we need my engine + solar + NH3 maker to get zero carbon.  We then unplug CO2 as an issue, and all the nonsense socialism that is claimed by the CO2 scam.  We "trump" them for good with NH3.
@marlene676 No going to happen.  They will implode do to one child policy.
@eatkinson48 Think 14th Amendment to understand why....  Subject to jurisdiction...  An Alien is subject to the Alien's country jurisdiction via treaty while in the USA.  They therefore CANNOT have their children made citizen at birth!
@ThomasPaine5 When wind and solar max out, Nuclear power plants have to pay to get rid of it.  They want to make NH3 instead, then sell, but no car engine can work with it for many reasons.  My engine can, and with solar thermal+ engine+ NH3 maker I think $1/gal e is doable.
@ThomasPaine5 Yes, Nat Gas now, but NH3 can be made by electricity.  New technology that the CO2 people are using.  The grid NEEDS fuel store to get to 100% renewables.  They will have to burn NH3 due to the power needed and control.  Fuel cells are not powerful enough.  Turbines are....&gt;
@Leo_Trumpster How about we unplug CO2 and unplug their agenda...  My engine on NH3 can do just that.  Get 100 mpg vs old Otto cycle engine at 25 mpg.  NH3 made via solar on house.  Take the CO2 out and take that "booger" out.
@bud_cann @AmericanLaoch @marsone2 @IcyQueenBee @bethtcoast @TheWatchers84 @Jack00482816 @AirborneRules @MMchiara @Satchalistic1 How to unplug the socialist green CO2 agenda?  Remove CO2 as an issue via my engine and NH3 made via solar.  Fastest way to zero carbon, yet can still use 5 fuels if needed where no NH3 is.  Once NH3 is cheaper, use it.  Simple.  No more CO2 debate.  No more crazy socialism.
@FionaGiselle1 They are so unaware of what they are doing and how sane people view them.  Only idiots follow these people.
@ThomasPaine5 Great Q.  LNG needs to be held cold and compressed.  I avoid this hassle and costs by going Propane ($2/gal e) and NH3 as the low cost fuel.  LNG could work, but would require special tanks.  I HEAT the fuel before injection...Cold is not what I want.  I loooove CO2, btw.
@ADeplorableBeam As for 60 years, I make the money on a per mile fee basis that covers overhauls plus some profit.  I take the risk of engine failure, but since it is like having 4-6 engines in car, you can fail 5 and still get home.  No tows.  No "engine won't start" nonsense (no starter needed)
@ADeplorableBeam It takes ~ 3 gallons of NH3 by volume to make 1 gallon equivalent to gasoline.  The problem is you can't retro old cars due to volume of tanks and the need for pressure tanks.  The tanks need to go under the floor just like Tesla does it....like a raft of tubes.
@ADeplorableBeam Gallons of gasoline Equivalent....115000 BTU.  1 gal e = 33.7 kwh per EPA standard you see on electric vehicles.  Considered equal in energy value.  Conversion number is 3412 BTU/kw-h.  115,000/3412=33.7  Read the tweets and then ask questions.  NH3 can be $1/gal e....cheap.
@SandiWiener Yes, I agree.  CO2 is being used for a lot of insane control freak nonsense.  I say we get to NH3 to shut them down.  That also unplug the OIL DOLLAR and Bush cartels.  Two cartels gone with one cool engine that allows me to have roadable seaplane with nearly free fuel.
The notion that cow farts need to be controlled is "utterly" insane in the extreme.  CO2 as a pollutant is also insane, but I digress.  		The reason to go to NH3 is to unplug the CO2 and OIL mafias who use CO2 to promote socialism and taxes to enrich themselves via bribes.
@ThomasPaine5 I agree!!!!  I want NH3 to save money, be independent from oil, and fly for "free" between maintenance intervals.   The NH3 cost is maintenance and that occurs every 5 years.  In between fuel is "free" to me!   Happy to use 5 fuels if they are LESS money than the NH3 to make.
Yes, my fart, my choice.  This is funny, I must admit.  		If I can get 100% of the CO2 gone via NH3 and engine from cars, houses, airplanes, trucks, heavy equipment...everything that now has power,		can we just leave the cows alone?  Deal? https://t.co/Bh3n0ubwH4
@ADeplorableBeam And yes, the batteries are a toxic waste dump waiting to happen, and there is not enough Li to do the world on it.  My engine...no material problems.  All recycled.  1 million miles plus.  Own car for 60 years...  Read tweets.  You will be surprised what the future holds.
@ADeplorableBeam My engine gets you out of the battery nightmare nonsense.  Try 200 mpg on $1/gal e NH3 fuel, or $2/gal gasoline Plus road tax.  Better yes, roadable seaplane at 200 mph at 30 mpg or 3.3 c/mile, which is less than road tax, tires and brakes (4-6 c/mile) if driving. Like free fuel!
@capt_doop That is funny.  My engine does not want to cork your cows butt.  Methane is NOT important.  My engine can unplug AOC and the crazies with NH3 as fuel, along with 5 fossil fuels to bridge the gap until NH3 becomes the main fuel.  NH3 is fertilizer...liquid cow stuff, sort of....
@MoleculeTechLLC How about my engine that can solve CO2 issues?  10x bigger than computers and internet.  Energy!  500-1000 billion/y could be saved with this technology.  Discuss?
@wernerlogistics Want to save 40-50 cents/mile on a truck?  Happy to discuss it.
@rtoinsider Want to get the CO2 out ASAP?  My engine can run on 5 fuels and NH3 (no C...see) .  Want to help solve the CO2 issue?  Discuss?  read tweets and see the future of energy....or go bankrupt!
@ClimateMuseum My engine can solve the CO2 problem ASAP.  You buy engine in car, buy house solar with NH3 maker and you are 100% carbon FREE!  Once the grid wakes up (clueless) and MAKES NH3, you buy NH3 at station.  No solar needed if not wanted.  Want to get the CO2 out and help, or not?
How to fill up pressure tank with gasoline?  		The fuel is at pressure whether it is NH3, Propane, Diesel, gasoline, Jet A or 100 LL.  		A small transfer tank with a pump transfers liquid fuels to pressure tank.  Fill is just like old cars.  Pump is automatic.  Fill, turns on/off https://t.co/WE6z27bjac
A battery in car costs you $4/gal e.  Maintenance at 2 c/kwh is 67 c/gal.  Add in fuel maker and you get $1/gal e for NH3 or about ~ 1/4 the cost of battery use.  The battery still needs electricity.  $4 for battery and $4 for electricity via grid...total $8/gal via grid.  8:1
The cost of NH3 I use is $1/gal based on 2 c/kwh.  Remember, that is MAINTENANCE and it only comes in intervals (every 5 years or so), so while you make NH3, the cost at the pump is ZERO.  It is like the battery in car.  It costs up front, and a bill comes when worn out.
A farmer would start out by getting new engines.  This would save 1/2 the Diesel fuel.  They could run Propane too and save some over Diesel.  Once tractors are switched out, next comes solar and engine system to make NH3.  That cuts fuel costs and zeros out heating/cooling.
Clearly the value of farm equipment is not all in the engine.  You can run old Diesels and use Diesel fuel.  It would cost 4x over my engine in terms of fuel.  $1/gal e NH3 vs $2/gal Diesel at 1/2 efficiency makes 4x costs.  Farmer saves 75% of fuel cost approximately by engine.
Hopefully I could make a deal with CAT, John Deere and other equipment makers and they could help with their networks to get farmers installed with new engine. If they don't, then I guess they will be in for bankruptcy I would guess.  No?  Who would buy something without engine?
To convert over a farm (provided I have engines made and ready, and NH3 makers) would take about 1 month to remove old Diesel engines, install and then add solar and engine system with tanks to barns.  Existing Hydraulics can work, just add motors to torque.  CAT and John Deere?
Ah, how will this affect FARMERS???		They have large barns, usually.  		Run entire farm off of NH3 via barns and solar.  		Use NH3 in all tractors with my engine.  		Old Diesel can be removed and new engine installed IN OLD EQUIPMENT, thus saving HUUUGE money.  Would take 1 month
My engine system can be the LOWEST of ALL systems.  	Some Wikipedia numbers g(CO2-eq)/KW-he.		Coal 863-941	Oil 893	Nat Gas 557	Nuke 60	Hydro 15	Con solar 40	PV 106	Wind 21		My engine?  Maybe 2-5
@bryanwedde No, I am thinking how to unplug the CO2 nonsense via my engine and house solar that makes NH3.  Once we all run on NH3, there is no carbon to talk about.  No socialism via CO2 either.  No oil dollar.  Peace and nearly free energy for all.  RBG is likely dead...RIP....next....
Actually, no need to distinguish between "developing" nations and old western nations.  Both just buy my engine, install in house/buildings and NH3 is the fuel.  This can take 1-2 years if I can supply engines fast enough.  Again, want to get to zero carbon ASAP?  READ MY TWEETS!
This is an excellent comment.  No need for CO2 capture with my engine.  Go almost directly to zero carbon for "developing" nations.  		First, get engines and use existing carbon fuels.  		Second, install house/building systems to run on NH3.  This could take 1-2 years to go 0% C. https://t.co/7VfbQnFMRa
@0Sundance No, WASTE of time.  Developing countries NEED my engine.  They can quickly go to zero carbon.  Read my tweets.  No capture needed or wanted.
Since each engine NEEDS the pressure (250 PSI min) tanks to correctly operate, there is no option that allows no NH3 as a fuel.  There is no way to cut out NH3/Propane use to reduce costs like you can in Otto/Diesel engines.  This ensures ALL cars can use NH3, the end game.
Note, EVERY car with my engine will need the fuel tanks that allow NH3 or Propane.  It is not an "option" or add-on.  It is REQUIRED for the engine to operate correctly and fully.  Tanks are needed even if the fuel (Gasoline) does not need a pressure tank like NH3 and Propane do.
This engine can be "dropped" into existing car production lines.  Option 1 would be old engine and 25 mpg.  Option 2 new engine with 100 mpg and tons of cool features, totally clean and option for zero carbon via NH3.  Car companies would sell 100's of millions the first year.
Also, by buying car and house system, they will have no "range anxiety" when they travel anywhere fossil fuels or NH3 now exist.  No grid charging station needed.  No waiting to charge.  No trip range planning nonsense.  Freedom to travel with 75-90% of costs gone.
If the clock starts when My Engine is available (5-7 years?), a person who buys my engine in a car and who buys house engine+solar+NH3 maker will go from 80-100% carbon to 0% carbon local to house in the time it takes to buy car and install system on house. Less than 1 month?
Clearly it will take "decades" according to EU to get to zero carbon on the grid.  When you buy an electric car you run it on carbon.	When you buy my engine in car you reduce carbon by 75% immediately.	When you buy house solar+engine+NH3 maker you are 0% carbon NOW!
Notice the EU reaction to the #GreenNewDeal with respects to Methane reduction (sec2).  The grid still has not figured out how to zero out carbon, like I have, and MUST use CH4 (Natural Gas) due to the "duck curve" effect of renewables.  EU stated "many decades" before no CH4.
If you support any form of the #GreenNewDeal you are actually supporting prolonging the use of carbon fuels.  Understand why?  Notice that they even mention Methane.  My engine does not use CH4 and will eliminate it for NH3.  CH4 to NH3.  The EU even condemned deal for CH4 bash.
In contrast to the quick path of my engine to zero carbon, when you buy an electric car, the grid still is mostly (50-80%) carbon based.  You cannot get to zero carbon, nor can you meet IPCC 2050 goal by buying a new car.  You must wait 20-30 years when using grid.
When you buy a car with my engine in it you instantly go from 25 mpg to 100 mpg.  This saves you money and saves 75% of the fuel you were using. IPCC 2050 goal met. To get the remaining 25% of the carbon fuel gone, you switch to NH3.  Carbon tax takes natural incentive away.
@Franktmcveety Carbon tax will SLOW the path to zero Carbon.  Why?  It removes the savings of my new engine that can run on 5 fuels and NH3.  The trick is to get everybody using engine that can use NH3.  When NH3 is cheaper than all 5 fuels, then people switch to NH3....100% carbon free.
@hrtablaze Yes, and when they get my engine that cuts their costs of living, they will sureley not want anything to do with Dems.  We can unplug Dems by getting CO2 out and still allow people to use old fuels.  see tweets.
@AmyMek Want to unplug the Democrat party and Rinos?  My engine can do it by getting the CO2 out via NH3, while sill allowing people to use old fuels if need be.  Want to discuss how YOU can help?
@Thongch34759935 @WeiZhangAtmos @PatrickTBrown31 @FraserMacLeod5 Chai, want CO2 gone?  I have the solution.  Want to help or just waste time arguing the issue?  see tweets.  This will get us to zero carbon ASAP like nothing else.  Lets' discuss how YOU can help, OK?
@PatrickTBrown31 Patrick, want to get to zero carbon ASAP?  My engine via NH3 is the ticket. read tweets.  Stop arguing and help get the carbon out for those who think CO2 is a problem.  Happy to discuss how you can help....
@cali_curmudgeon @Lobo11G @CauserJenny @raducom @luvnewinfo @LadyNY4Ever @2018MAGAMidTrmT @Margsbelle1958 @Donnie0725 @_The_Super_ @GampyK @WTexasDanielle @chucklourieT @JohnnyMacHill @LarryJimKapp @jorland4281 @luluHru AND solving the CO2 scam with a combustion engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3.   Get engine in all vehicles, and buildings and then switch to NH3 when cheaper than 5 fuels.  No more CO2 scam or carbon tax nonsense. No socialism or green NAZI deals.
@jobeeswing @RepAOC @SpeakerPelosi @SenKamalaHarris Want to unplug the "green new deal" ?  Read my tweets.  My engine can get us to zero carbon and still allow 5 common fuels.  When NH3 is cheaper, then people can go zero carbon if wanted, or not.  No socialism needed.
@ElsevierEnergy No need for auto batteries.  My engine can get use to zero carbon ASAP.  Read tweets.  Nothing is faster to zero carbon, with no smog, nice clean air and fresh water via engine.  Read tweets.  Can also use fossil fuels until NH3 becomes cheaper than gasoline, thus bridging...
@arthurpearl @SidneyPowell1 My engine could unplug this UN nonsense by solving CO2 and making fuel (NH3) for $1/gal e.  No carbon tax.  No pollution.  No smog.  Engine harvests water and cleans the air...serious.
This engine is what is needed to unplug the CO2 controversy, if you will.  Whatever your belief about CO2, getting 75% of the fuel gone (cars) and then switching to NH3 is doable.  Want zero carbon? Buy NH3.  Don't care about CO2? Buy any of 5 fuels.  Your choice.  Freedom baby! https://t.co/w1GE6OZdQ0
A word about maintenance....  Due to the design and distributed nature, each motor can be held in a hand, removed easily and worked on at a common table.  No stand or special hoist is needed.  This allows easy overhaul.  Redundant motors allow partial engine failure with power.
Most of the advantages are NOT found on electric motor systems.  This is not an old stinky gasoline/Diesel engine that is noisy.  The engine is as quiet as an electric motor, or can be made loud if wanted during high power.  This allows the "feel" of power found in old engines.
One last advantage I forgot to mention.  It has internal electrical heating which allows the engine to run on battery power at a reduced power should such be needed.  The battery size can vary as needed, but energy is not via electric motors, but can be if one is needed.
Below I mention some of the advantages new engine offers not found in other new or old engines.  These features and more are what is needed to make a "flying car" as it were.  We don't have "flying cars" due to the lack of needed engine technology and vehicle designs.
Weight advantage of engine:		1/7th weight of Diesel/HP	1/3rd weight of Otto car engine	1/2 weight of aircraft engine	40% fuel load needed	33% fuel load over turbine	Distributed weight of motors, not central, if needed.	Engine pivot with shaft for power vectoring.
Active drag reduction advantages via engine:		Redundant vacuum/pressure source for boundary sucking and blowing	Lift addition by flow control	Exhaust heat use for thrust enhancement with waste heat.	Potential 30-50% drag reduction by control of flow around vehicle	Deicing of skin
Thermal advantages of engine:		60-75% efficient, on many fuels and NH3.	Variable expansion ratios 3 to 81	No cooling needed of engine at point of torque.	Energy recycling,.	High heating value use of fuel (not just low heat to steam exhaust)	Heating/cooling free.	Cool to touch...
Smooth torque advantages of engine:		Torque like a 16-20 piston engine or 4 pole electric motor.  	No negative torques	Zero RPM no combustion torque out	720 degree burns for slow NH3 fuel.	High RPM	Fully balanced	NO inertia feedback in torque	Can add motors to common shaft.
Packaging advantage of engine:		Small - 10 inch x 5 round, scaled up to 3 x this	Distributed - lots of motors over vehicle, not one central power source	Support systems anywhere - no weight an balance issues	No cooling - self cooling	Any temperature exhaust -  32 F to 2000 F.
My engine can go in anything that now has engines in it, and allows many new vehicles not possible. 		Advantages:		Packaging, 	smooth torque, 	zero RPM torque, 	no cooling at point of torque, 	boundary layer suck and blow, 	1/3 weight, 	free heating/cooling, 	any fuel and NH3,..&gt;
How to "UNPLUG" the Climate Change scam with real technology and private capital?   Interested?  If we don't, the CO2 nonsense will be used to enslave us all top to bottom.    This engine can unplug the CO2 question once and for all.  Want freedom?  This might interest you..&gt;
Pay for itself if driving like a truck.  A truck engine would cost around $30k and save $50k, but a car only does 15k miles/year or about 6.6 times less.  The engine would be part of the car and the 100 mpg vs old 25 mpg would make it attractive.... https://t.co/ys6dEGhx8D
To get my engine into as many vehicles as possible, I would need a business model of "at cost" with maintenance per mile.  All the majors would have access and a "stake" in the engine with some caveat.  This would get us to zero carbon ASAP like nothing else could.  Discuss?
Each person who bought my technology could pay for it in the first year with the fuel savings if I gave it to them "at cost" with no profit.  This is approximate, OK....  If I charged a small maintenance fee over 20 years, everybody could afford it now via the cash flow savings.
If we all used my engine on NH3, the USA would save well over 600-1000  billion/year.  The savings for 1 year could pay for the system for 20  years.  Same applies in trucks, airplanes, cars, when you are  honest with the numbers.		"MY"  "green deal" would pay out in 1 year!
The key to getting zero carbon is clearly my engine (or similar) and low costs.  This requires that SCAMS like the "green new deal" be stopped.  If you consider 7.5 as the scam factor of solar, you can see it is very doable.  $49 trillion/7.5 = 653 billion/year = saving in fuel.
It is now obvious that the cost of solar can be less than 2 cents/kwh, making NH3 less than Natural Gas at home.  At this point it no longer makes sense to use Natural Gas in the engine due to the advantages of low pressure liquid of NH3 (like Propane) and volume (3 vs 3.8)
If you install panels and have a cost of 2 cent/kwh, you can make NH3 from the electricity.  		Min to Max costs: $0.02 x 33.7 x (1.11 to 1.55)  = $0.75 to 1.04 /gal e		3:1 for NH3 is 25-35 c/gal NH3.  		NH3 = par to Natural Gas compressed from house with compression costs!
One person who commented to me said that typically a given price of PV panels wholesale are $4k, installed $30k.  30/4=7.5 factor.  If we assume they sell them for equal the cost of electricity, then 15 cent/kwh / 7.5 = 2 c/kwh is the true cost of PV panels if you do the work.

The green new deal # does not put my tweets there so I will stop.  This is all just a waste of time.  Do you want zero carbon or not?  My guess is the last thing they want is a fast and effective zero CO2 solution.  They want the control and money and can care less about CO2.
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Waste - AI will mine waste and it will be valuable with robots.  No an issue.  		Methane - not relevant. They clearly are clued out about CH4's effects as GHG.  Amazing ignorance.  Any carbon from a cow is neutral...duh....
#GreenNewDeal Sec 2	Urban sustainability... - My engine solves by saving money to self invest in renewal.  No gov funds needed.		Urban transit - 100 year old failed ideas.  My engine in "pod" system would give door to door zero traffic.  Their junk totally fails now and future.
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Cleanup Brownfields - more ways to scam people and rip off tax payers.   More welfare make work nonsense for well connected thugs who want to rip off tax payers.  Silly nonsense.  		This is all more clap trap nonsense.  Who are these idiots?
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Restore Landscape - To what?  This is a total land grab.  Not needed with my engine.  	Wetlands - More land grab.  Sick puppies...  Total control of everything by snot nosed rats who know nothing...basically.  	Sustainable farming - more control freak idiots.
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Protect 2 mil miles of waterways - This is a water grab, that is all.  Again, my engine cleans before you use or drink regardless of condition.  Easy.  No taking people's land away to enrich friends.  Sorry, not needed.
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Clean water - My engine harvest water and recycles shower water if wanted.  No grid water needed, if wanted.  Stand alone clean water anywhere.  Old water cleaned by engine.  No replacement needed.  Distill all water via engine before use.  Simple.  No new.
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Cut CH4 leakage 50% by 2025 - My engine does not need any CH4 if wanted.  Therefore 0% leaks ASAP.  Their junk relies on CH4, that is why they say 50%.  Biased!  No fracking needed with my engine when fully implemented.  Wake up.  Their junk is bad junk.
#GreenNewDeal  sec 2		Clean air and water a right - My engine gets you both ASAP.  Your junk?  Never.  A right is an act that does no harm, not a reason to rip people off which harms them.  Their junk is future land fill toxic waste.  My engine CLEANS the air as it runs...
#GreenNewDeal Sec 2		100% fossil free transportation by 2050 -  Why so long?  Idiots!  Combustion gets you there via NH3 short order via my engine at lowest cost, including airplane, trucks, boats, ships and everything that needs power.  Silly nonsense is what they have.  LOL
#GreenNewDeal sec 2		Energy eff - Net 0 C building by 2030.  My engine zeros CO2 out without any need for new codes.  More junk ideas that won't work.  They keep admitting their junk won't work.  LOL.		Transit - incentives?  Junk needs it. NO combustion?  It is KEY to zero C !
#Greennewdeal sec 2		Transform - 100% not needed or wanted.  Sorry idiots, no need for 100 year old junk trains, crazy building codes or regs.  Just need my engine system to zero C out.  	100% net by 2035 for grid - Why so long?  Need my engine.  	zero C by 2050 - why wait?  LOL
#GreenNewDeal What is in it?		More FDR wrecking ball to economy.  Make work.  Top down junk.	Unsustainable and existential -  Yes, green nonsense is junk.  My engine solves.	Shift - to junk that can't work, wasting more resources.  Not needed.  	Stability - unstable grid, LOL.
#Greennewdeal intro.		Scale and urgency - my engine is only solution to both.	Jobs - make work nonsense destroys wealth.	Popular - Not so.  My engine is what people want, not junk.	Just and equitable - we get zero, they control your life.	$$$ feasible - $49 trillion?  LOL.
I will try to comment on the #Greennewdeal as possible.  Clearly none of it is needed and most will slow any progress to zero carbon which they claim is the goal.  No, the goal is socialism so they can live in massive palaces, fly in gas guzzling jets....  Oldest scam there is.
@JKman003 The make money by promoting the bad technology that their friends bribe them to force on rate payers of the grid.  Just a way to launder bribes.  Nothing new here.  They have no idea how to get to zero carbon and don't want to.
Found the link to the #GreenNewDeal  		https://t.co/UgCwZAV8mR
@aaron4AD22 My engine or similar is needed to get to zero carbon.  Use all existing fuels and NH3.  Once NH3 become cheaper, the switch is made and 100% is carbon free.  This is the cheapest and FASTEST way to zero carbon by far.
@aaron4AD22 To get 100% they need a bridging fuel such as NH3.  This is finally becoming understood by people in the know.  Combustion is the best way to get to zero carbon via NH3 made by excess wind and solar.  That NH3 can then run cars, trucks, buses, airplanes and more....
@joe_kardon @miamore__1 @LNW4Trump What is loony toon thing is that people don't know history and think that what they see as authority is actually just a fraud imposter.  You might want to learn before you attack the messenger.  Believe what you will....
@joe_kardon @miamore__1 @LNW4Trump Constantine was in Constantinople, NOT Rome.  Rome was vacant for 300 years from 450 to 750 AD.  Charles Martel, grandfather of Charlemagne, was excommunicated from the Roman Constantine church and got pissed and went down to Rome and founded the Catholic church.
@UN_Women If you believe CO2 is causing bad things, then you need my engine technology.  Read my tweets.  No excuse to not be zero carbon with my technology.  So why continue?
@miamore__1 @LNW4Trump Think of layers of beliefs.  Look up esoteric beliefs of Catholics. See the Jesuit logo of sun and 32 knives of rays.  Initiated and uninitiated.  The wafer is the sun, the crescent is the moon.  They are joined.  This is ancient Babylon religion remade with Christ overlay.
My question to the #GreenNewDeal socialists is if my engine in car can get costs in city driving winter/summer to 50 times less than what you offer, how can you help people get out of poverty with such high costs?  You can't.  $100 fuel vs $2, save $98.  That pays for healthcare!
To charge your electric car at night will cost you $13/gal equivalent to gasoline.  You can make NH3 for $1/gal e.  Why pay 13 times MORE.  Then add in the 2x economy of my car + engine (200 mpge vs 100 mpge in electric) plus thermal in city of 2x and you have 2x2x13= 52:1 costs.
But, you say, why not just use PV panels to charge car?  Great if you work at home, but most don't.  What happens when the sun is on vacation?  Out of luck!  Charge via battery in house?  $4/gal in/out + PV panel @ 15 cents/kwh or $5/gal e, + car.  4+5+4 =$13/gal e, vs $1-2.
If NH3 is less than gasoline in costs (required for people to adopt it), that makes fuel $1-2/gal e.  Electricity from the grid is RETAIL at 12 c/kwh which is $4/gal e or 2-4 times more.  Battery is $4/gal e.  Total is 6-8 times more than my engine, at least.  Why spend more?
In order to unload the carbon from the grid to make electric cars actually carbon free, NH3 will be needed to bridge the gaps of power.  New turbines will be needed to burn the NH3 as fuel cell are too low in power to make work, and are costly.  So, combustion will be needed...
Funny how the #GreenNewDeal  wants a massive government funded thing, and they don't realize that individual solutions are available via PV, NH3 maker and fuel cells to get zero carbon NOW.  They are extremely expensive, but hey, likely less than $49 trillion, is my guess.
The central reason or crying (like children who can't wipe their rear ends) of the #GreenNewDeal is that the grid has carbon in it and when you use electric cars you are using carbon fuels.  Using NH3 with PV panels and fuel cells and electric cars can get you zero carbon NOW.
@justinr10519174 Great.  Neither did I before Dec 15th or so.  See tweets.  I ran into it via a video on you tube.  My focus is NOT lower CO2 but independence of fuels.  NH3 looks like the future to me more and more, just from a cost stand point, not CO2.  Both "sides" can agree then.
@justinr10519174 The key is to have lots of engines/cars/trucks/airplanes that can use all fuels AND NH3.  As the grid gets more renewables, it will start to produce NH3 to dump excess power during "duck curve" times.  The price of NH3 will go to below gasoline and bingo...zero carbon via NH3.
@justinr10519174 If you assume PV panels at 15 c/kwh, then $5.6/gal e, which is much more than gasoline.  Key issue is that it will take time and markets to get NH3 down to below gasoline.  Farmers pay $1/gal NH3 or $3/gal e to gasoline., which is more than current gasoline prices.
@justinr10519174 Great question.  Costs?  Depends on electricity costs.   Assume AZ solar plant electricity costs of 1.5 c/kwh and 90% recovery (Stanford professor's claim)		Numbers:  1.5  x 33.7 kwh/gal e /.9 = 56.16 c/gal equiv to gasoline.  3 gallons NH3 to 1 gal gasoline = 18.7 c/gal NH3.
@BigArmedBear The future is flying at less than the road tax, tires and brakes.  This engine allows airplanes with range, whereas electrics cannot.  Weight is key in mobile applications and this engine is ~ 1/3 the weight of old piston cranks, and key to aviation...the future.  NOT electrics.
@BigArmedBear The engine can run 5 fuels and NH3 and fuel up anywhere:		House: NH3/propane.  	Station: gasoline/Diesel	Airport: Jet A/100LL		In the future, NH3 is at Station and airport when enough demand exists.  Then the choice if cost and volume of fuel.  Make NH3 cheap, then zero carbon..&gt;
@BigArmedBear Basically the engine can go into any vehicle due to the "distributed" nature of the design.  Lots of "motors" can work together as a system, like a drone would, or ganged up to a common shaft, thus allow multi engine power.  Around 60-75% efficient, par to electrics.
@BigArmedBear What is your specific question?  I have 9 thousand tweets that cover most aspects of energy, cars, trucks, airplanes, grid issues and more. Yes, I need a web page! This is my log book as I design the system.  The new engine is two years old in concept and NH3 is only 1 month...&gt;
Notice that I design my system to allow you freedom of choice and to maintain value of your misguided investment in PV panels.  The PV electricity is worth 1.5 c/kwh, but it costed you 15 c/kwh, or about 10x more than it should have.  Better to buy my system and save big time...&gt;
Many will opt for grid power and electric cars.  This will cost them around 16 times more than my system.  They won't be carbon zero for many many years due to grid issues, whereas with NH3 and PV they are zero carbon immediately.
With PV panels and NH3 maker you could use the NH3 with a fuel cell.  This is likely what many people will opt for short term depending on whether they own an electric car or a car with my engine in it.  They will charge their electric car via PV or fuel cell and NH3.  One option
@LNW4Trump The Eucharist is the union of the sun god and moon god, better known as Ba al and Ba allah.  Islam is moon goddesss, Catholics are sun god.  Union of both is a sex ritual of sorts.  Lovely...
To get the value out of your PV solar, you will be making day time electricity and NH3.  But what can you use the NH3 for?  Run your cars and house during night.  With my system you can still use old PV just fine until they wear out.  You don't need to tare them off the roof....&gt;
Prediction!  		Your PV power will make NH3....		When lots of people have solar, there will be over supply.  The grid will not want it.  		Notice that AZ Power has a 20 year contract for 2.5 c/kwh, which means electricity is worth 1.5 c/kwh, and grid charge 1 c/kwh  		Make NH3!
@justinr10519174 NH3 should be made via electricity and a fuel maker.  I tweeted many times about it.
@justinr10519174 ????
STOP wasting time on electric cars and batteries.  Why?  The grid needs NH3 to get to 100% renewable.  How to use NH3?  Combustion!  My engine makes up the volume problem with NH3 (3 times more volume/energy) by making engine that is 3-5 x more efficient in car.  Problem solved.
NEWS FLASH:  If you want to get to zero carbon ASAP...guess what?  		COMBUSTION is key!  Read that 1000 times.  		The switch to NH3 is a simple choice at the pump.  Not much changes over using all the old fuels.  NH3 is like propane.  A new nozzle.  Takes 5 minutes to learn.
There are two ways to use NH3.  		1) fuel cell:  requires clean fuel and only one, NH3		2) combustion: allows dirty fuels, and many fuels, such as gasoline, Diesel, Propane, Jet A and 100 LL, that are ALREADY in use, as well as Mixing fuels.  		Combustion is KEY to zero carbon!
Hint:  If NH3 can be made for only a 10% loss, just like charging a battery has a 10% loss going into the battery, this would make converting renewable energy into NH3 very cost effective.  What to do with the NH3?  How to bridge to NH3?  MY ENGINE!!!!  Hello, are you there????
Here is an article I was sent.  Notice people are starting to realize that energy storage is needed for the grid and that NH3 may be the key to 100% renewable energy.  How can this be?  20-30 years late?		https://t.co/CNmwqRnPvm
The appeal of AI and electric cars is the appeal of staying in your parents basement and never getting a wife and life.  You think you are a stud muffin hot dude living in your parents basement.  No, you are a LOOOOOSER.  Growing up requires FUEL STORE (money in bank).  Wake up.
And if you happen to run low on NH3, you can use any of 5 fuels or NH3 from a retail store.  Can you do that with an @elonmusk  system?  NOOOOOO!  So why do you want to belong to his CULT of battery electric cars?  Because you ain't got a clue?  You are a basement dweller?  Hmm?
My engine is a stand alone system, with full fuel making option via solar thermal and engine.  No need for a grid because it can FUNCTION AS A GRID in your house, unlike PV/wind.  Understand?  It can go for months without any renewable energy available, yet work 365 days/y.
The reason we even have a #greennewdeal is that we have basement dwellers, like @AOC who think socialism via government is the means to their power.  They want their parents to become their slaves so they don't have to get a life and get real.  No?  Pure insanity....&gt;
In a similar note, government employees are like children in their parents basement.  They can't make it on their own, yet they want huge salaries, pensions, time off, guaranteed pay (shut down?) and all the respect of private entrepreneurs.  Sorry, life is not like that...&gt;
Wind and solar are like a 35 year old "child" in their parents basement making minimum wage thinking they are cool/hot, all the while thinking they are independent using their parents food, cars, water and shelter.  Delusional and lazy butt idiots is what they are....&gt;
Now that the renewables are a large part of the grid, this obvious nonsense of wind and PV starts to become obvious.  Like single people not having children expecting society to continue.  WAKE UP and do your duty (have family) and stop scamming off your parents for once.
PV solar and wind REQUIRE the use of the "neighbor's" power, namely a device that can use energy storage called coal, nuclear, oil, gas, etc.  to allow their system to even function, yet they want to be paid MORE for junk (inverter) power.  Grow up for once, will you?  Wake up!
If I were to start out designing a stand alone energy system to sell you, would I not need a store of energy?  If I told you that you could borrow your neighbor's power during the night, you would think I was a mental case.  But that is exactly what has happened in PV solar/wind.
This cult of renewable energy was so stupid, so ignorant, so oblivious to what they are doing as to not even consider the need of energy storage 20 YEARS AGO, yet they want to rule your life.  Serious?  Why would we trust anything they say when they can't get to first base?
Why then are we here with a #GreenNewDeal socialist pile of nonsense being promoted by idiots who can't wipe their own rear ends?  Because the cult of socialism and central planing dominates our thoughts.  This cult did not understand that fuel storage would be needed on grid.
This "smart grid" AI world is a world where all we get to do is watch a few elites do things and we all become "fans" to these cult members.  The individual has no say and the cult leader has dominance over everybody else's ideas.  The nail that sticks up gets hammered down.
Artificial intelligence is nothing more than imposing values onto people by another means.  It says individual values and choices are dangerous and must be eliminated.  People become "passengers" in life and not drivers.  Driving is for the elite, not the common man...&gt;
The world is run by crazy control idiots who want to rule and reign over people and not allow them to add to the mix of values.  They want their values forced on people via some cult or group (gov) to enslave others.  They kill innovation from individuals on their cult alters.
A socialist thinks they know the price of something, yet they can't know that due to the massive amount of information and deals made on each part that makes up a product.  Hence they make junk people don't want, and shortages for real stuff.  .....&gt;
Socialism at the heart says some smart person knows how to run your life and you are their slave to control.  They know the price of something, which is impossible to know from their point of view. This is what electric cars with batteries and smart grids do...socialism.
When crazy and stupid people run things who are disconnected from reality, you get concepts like electric cars (ice cooled car/hot water bottles) and "smart grids" that are rooted in wasting your time to make the controller money and power, all the while selling you junk tech.
Vehicles and the grid need a fuel store to run well.  Demand is on and off.  You can't have a "smart car" that schedules when you accelerate any more than having a "smart grid" that schedules when you need electricity.  Both are NOT smart concepts for either car or grid.
To run a car or to run a grid, you need a store of energy.  Using blocks of ice (batteries) would not be a rational choice to run a car cooling on,  and neither would using batteries on the grid to run the grid.  Why is this so hard to see?  A fuel store is needed for both.
A battery is like a block of ice.  It is heavy and limited in the cooling and takes a long time to re-freeze.  Nobody would use ice to cool a car, and neither should they use a battery to run a car for the same reason.  Heavy, low in energy, and  takes a long time to charge.
Alarmists act like they live in the tropics and all you need to do is plant more banana trees to feed from and all will be well.  Deniers  don't like bananas and prefer pork or beef...  What both don't see is that storage is key.  Refrigeration allows storage.  Fuel is storage.
Both "alarmists" and "deniers" don't get what life itself tells you every year, that you MUST store up energy to make it through the winter.  It is as though both are arguing about CO2 in a 72 degree building and have forgotten about seasons.  They think like they live in tropics
Lovers of CO2 often state we would freeze without fossil fuels because renewable energy does not work during winter.  They fail to also realize that energy storage is the key to renewable energy year around and it's viability.  So both pro CO2 and con CO2 people don't get it!
The world knows that if you want to eat during the winter, you have to store up food.  Why is it so hard to understand when it comes to "energy" and the grid?  Is food not energy?  Food needs to be stored, but not grid power?  Really?  Serious?  Shocking lack of awareness!
Look, in a short period of time looking into how to get to zero carbon, you can see that bridging the intermittent nature of renewable sources is key, yet this has not occurred to an ENTIRE INDUSTRY until just recently!  How can that be?  Life itself says this.  Any farmer knows.
Getting to zero carbon, and getting off oil for independence sake, just so happen to solve similar problems.  So my motive is to UNPLUG the AGW agenda.  To do that and be independent from the control freaks and OIL, I go to NH3 and modify my engine to use NH3 (NOT EASY, BTW).
Look, I have no motive to lower CO2 from current STARVATION levels at 400 ppm.  If I could push a button, I would TRIPLE CO2 as CO2 does NOT control "climate" or temperature.  How is it I can figure out how to get to zero carbon and still not ONE AGW believer can?
How is it that a guy (seaplaneguy no doubt) who LOOOOOVES carbon because more carbon brings more LIFE to earth, can SEE A WAY TO ZERO CARBON but the entire AGW crowd cannot?  It is like a Moslem who ain't got a clue where Mecca is!  You need a Christian/Athiest/Jew to tell you!
How can a thinking and creative person accept a zero carbon goal yet have no way to get there at a reasonable and timely manner?  What is needed to make it to zero carbon?  		Look, folks, CO2 is a good thing, more is better, in my view.  Why can't you see the path to zero carbon?
So many people CLAIM they want to have "action" for "climate change" yet not one will start with a valid concept to solve the CO2 problem.  All you have to do is start asking a few question and you can see that people like @elonmusk and All Gore don't have valid solutions.....&gt;
@goonerniki In the end, no grids (water, sewer, electricity, gas)  for house is needed.  Energy made and used in cars or airplane (seaplane).  Engine designed for airplane, blown wing, that allows 1/2 landing speed.  Roadable seaplane is ultimate and original goal.  Door to door.
@goonerniki gooner, no, been looking at doing a web page, but don't have patents yet.  I prefer to interview people and go from there.  Read tweets.  This is R&amp;D for engineers.  Energy is 10 x computer/info.
@DocRock1007 She has some serious mental disorders and is totally lacking in self awareness.  What a waste of time and money....
@KingBaeksu Maybe you should rethink this...
@dodiewill2 @elonmusk Ironically, if you want cartel power you want AC from central plants.  Edison wanted local power via DC.  PV panels and batteries are DC.  Full circle....
@ElectBetterUSA @ASlavitt Not a chance.
@AndrewScheer @RachaelHarderMP With my engine you can run 5 carbon fuels and NH3.  When NH3 is cheaper than other fuels (no carbon tax) then the switch is made.  BTW, I won't allow this in countries that charge carbon taxes.  Ask me why....
@AndrewScheer @RachaelHarderMP Why not unplug "Falsedeau" by solving the CO2 problem?  Carbon taxes prolong the path to zero carbon via my engine and NH3 via solar thermal.  100% zero carbon is possible, but not with current technology.  New is needed...my engine.  Happy to discuss or you can be slaves....
Reminder, I am not here to educate you.  I am here to find honest and smart people to help me get the work done on this new technology.  Only an idiot would void patent rights via twitter.  If you are interested, then we talk off line.  Understand?  Boeing/Grumman/Lockheed/ same.
@SenSanders Bernie, your policies make the rigging worse.  They are the CAUSE of the wealth inequality.  Want to get the world out of poverty?  You need my engine and technology.  You can't get zero carbon via current wind and solar and government has no clue how to.  I do.  Discuss?
@SenSanders Bernie, you want to help people?  Happy to discuss how the savings of my engine can pay ALL the healthcare a person needs.  How about it?  Give everybody a 20% raise, and more.  Interested?  If not, then please stop wasting out time....
@Ken_Silverstein If the technology were right, then people would not need government.  My engine can get us to zero carbon and needs NO government support.  Only private money and maybe car/truck companies.  Stop distorting the markets with junk tech.  Simple concept.
@Ken_Silverstein All the socialism is a total waste and will slow the move to zero carbon.  The end game is my engine (or similar) and gasoline or NH3.  When NH3 is cheaper, you have zero carbon.  Simple.  Don't need ANY government anything except getting NH3 as a transit fuel.  Discuss?
@Ken_Silverstein Getting to zero carbon IS doable and I love CO2!  NH3 allows   independence from oil at $1/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  How?  Via  new engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3, and solar thermal + NH3 maker.   This engine works in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings,  anywhere.
@Ken_Silverstein if you want zero carbon there are needed technologies.  My engine can get us there and without it you can't get there if ever.  Batteries won't work.  NH3 is the key.  My engine will run on NH3 and 5 fuels.  It also gets 4x mileage and can use solar thermal...
Why do people have to force their views onto others via government or other means?  If you believe CO2 is the big bad wolf, then I expect you to discuss my engine and then invest.  Stop forcing people to invest in your crap.  My crap will get your non problem solved via NH3.
@RPMcMurhpy @SteveSGoddard @NOAA Regardless what you believe about CO2, my engine can run on carbon fuels (5) or NH3 made via solar.  Make your choice.  Stop bothering people who know CO2 is good for planet, like Steve.  He is right and loves CO2.  I want NH3 to have lower costs.  Either way is fine....
@RPMcMurhpy @SteveSGoddard @NOAA There are several technologies that are still needed to get to zero carbon.  First task is to know what they are.  I tweet them for free for you since you can't seem to figure out how to engineer yourself a solution to CO2.  Amazing.  Stupid is in endless supply.  Wake up.
@RPMcMurhpy @SteveSGoddard @NOAA Yuri, why do you argue?  Getting to zero carbon is doable.  You just have to be a good enough engineer, like me, to figure it out.  Learn some engineering and get off your lazy rear end and figure it out.  OK?  Wow, such arrogance.  Enough already.....&gt;

@sydnets @simonahac Batteries CANNOT supply the long term power needed during winter when solar and wind stop working or are well below normal output.  The NH3 is made during oversupply during day (solar) and stored in large tanks to be used later.  No way to do this with batteries.
@sydnets @simonahac Yes, that is why grid NEEDS NH3 to bridge the times when wind and solar don't work.  They are just now discovering this simple to understand concept that fuel is NEEDED, whether fossil or electro-chemical called NH3 (Ammonia).  Funny how they did not think of this 20 years ago.
@emfvet78 The #GreenNewDeal  is a way to use CO2 as a means to force socialism onto us.  The technology DOES NOT NOW exist to make the grid work 100% zero carbon.  My engine is the shortest path, but can also use 5 carbon fuels, which fuel cells cannot.  This is KEY to solve co2 issue.
@emfvet78 Getting to zero carbon IS doable and I love CO2!  NH3 allows    independence from oil at $1/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  How?  Via   new engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3, and solar thermal + NH3  maker.   This engine works in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings,   anywhere.
@SocialismStench You can pay for the health care on the fuel saving from my engine in ONE car each month per person.  Solve CO2, water, health care, traffic deaths, airplane issues and more.  Socialist are uncreative control freaks who can't think of real solution other than ripping people off.

@ArcticBasecamp @GretaThunberg No, actually you can't get to zero carbon with known technology.  But with my technology you can.  Happy to discuss if you are serious about CO2 or just want to be independent from oil.

@Bradhig03249424 NH3 is what excess wind and solar will be turned into.  NH3  is Ammonia, what farmers put on crops to fertilize them.   Difficult to burn in old engines without using carbon fuels.  My engine solves this and allows 5 fuels.  Fastest way to zero carbon...
@Schwartz_SLCs Also, it can harvest water from air.  No worries.  Just need the right technology.  BTW, CO2 is good for the planet, but either belief, you can use NH3 or fossil fuels.  No more hypocrisy.

@RealSaavedra Sounds like they are all racists to me....
@gatewaypundit @Petersweden Women or the "men" ?
@lloyd4man Any religion that has such nonsense is not valid.
@NEMOntario @EWBWater4World My engine can solve this via the system.  How?  Discuss.  Also it can get us to zero carbon ASAP.  No need for all these groups.  Just my technology.  Give it a rest.
@MAGA2ARIGHTS @gatewaypundit Running for President must be a way to scam money from people.  Amy sounds a little gamy on money fronts.
@ColumbiaBugle Yes, she gets it.  The 14th Amendment did not allow children of Aliens to be citizens.  This must be stopped and retroactive.
@ClaryHarry Or the dentures....
@my3monkees @BreitbartNews Kamala in Finnish language means:  Horrible, terrible, awful, aghast, etc.  What is in a name?  I say she is "finished" politically....
@EvonS777 @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats She is the mob boss.
@ZNEWSNET Kamala in Finnish means:  Horrible, terrible, awful, aghast, etc.  What is in a name?
@karli_bonne Who would want such junk in their house?  Sick dogs.
@SenSanders Something is not "popular" if you are forced to use it.  Wake up.
@MilspecP What link do you get that graphics from?
@Robbin_Young @fox5live @AOC I think her socialism and desire to force junk technology costing $49 trillion is unattractive.  My engine can get us to zero carbon via NH3, but still use carbon fuels.  When NH3 becomes cheaper, then people will get off oil.  Not before.
@deeg25 @AOC Getting to zero carbon IS doable, and I love CO2!  NH3 allows   independence from oil at $1/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  How?  Via new engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3, and solar thermal + NH3 maker.   This engine works in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings,  anywhere.
@Profitigation Maybe because they participate.  Just a guess....LOL
@GaCareers You need a new engine for that.  Uses 1/3 the fuel as a turbine.  Happy to discuss.  Can run NH3 for zero carbon running, or 5 fuels (gasoline, Diesel, propane, Jet A or 100 LL).  Also, single prop, multi-engine (4).
@PeterDGardner Do you REALLY want to get to zero carbon, or are you just another talker who has no idea?  Happy to discuss how to get to zero carbon ASAP, nearly 20-30 years faster than other options.
@StopLiveExport If you want zero CO2, my solution is the fastest to zero carbon for cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, houses and more.  There are step needed to get to zero carbon at a fraction of electric cars and such.  No wind mills, not solar farms...all house/building based.
@PeterGleick If you want action, my technology will get you to zero carbon faster than any solution by 20-30 years.  Happy to discuss it.  Actually it will cost much LESS than current technology and be truly zero.  In cars, Trucks, boats, ships, buildings, and airplanes.  Much lower costs!
@MakeTheNxtStep If you want to actually get to zero carbon, there is really only one way.  Happy to discuss my solution to zero carbon.  It leads to no grid, btw.
@MassGovernor If you want a real solution to zero carbon, happy to discuss it.  No need for any government action except to clear NH3 as a transit fuel.  There are steps to zero carbon and current technology will NOT gets us there.
@PaulEDawson If you want zero carbon, I have the solution to get there ASAP.  Happy to discuss it.
@CanadianGreens This is 100 year old junk.  Happy to discuss a zero carbon real solution....
@COClimateFuture Yes, bold action.  MY ENGINE is your solution via solar thermal and NH3.  Zero carbon ASAP.  Happy to discuss it.  Best way to get the CO2 out...and make cool seaplanes that run on NH3...
@citizensclimate @Zhirji28 @Jamie_Margolin @ThisIsZeroHour If you want to get to zero carbon ASAP I am happy to talk to you about a real solution.  Otherwise, please stop the fraud.
@MoCCaEUAE How to zero out oil....My engine making NH3 via solar thermal.  Cost of fuel?  $1/gal.  So much for Arab oil....
@UNFCCC @WMO If you think CO2 is a problem then my engine system with NH3 is your solution to get zero carbon ASAP.  Happy to discuss it.  If not, then stop the fraud...
@NikolovScience You can't make this nonsense up.  While in a snow storm she is worrying about burning up the planet.  Amazing to behold.  She (IT?) would not know science if it hit her with a Mack truck at Mach 2....
My motive to make engine was to lower fuel needs in seaplane so I could go to Hawaii with my wife with me.  Now it is about going to NH3 to eliminate the threat of crazy people who want energy control.   CO2 is irrelevant.  Getting independent of oil and grid is key to NH3 motive
@marklutchman Just as POTUS had to put assets in blind trusts, so to should all of Congress be required to put assets in blind trusts.  An accounting made of assets before and after up to 5 years later.  Audited each one.
@ph_terry Basis for arresting those who voted for it.
@Jane_the_Deplor @BlueStateSOS Folk, my roadable seaplane will some day run on NH3...no carbon...on $1/gal e NH3 and get 30 mpg at 200 mph.   That is 3 c/mile. That is less than the road tax, brakes and tires driving on road (7 c/mile).  Like flying for free fuel.  Yes, flying will be cheaper than driving.
@findering @LizIndependent1 @lloyd4man No phobia....just realist.
@SpaceWeather101 @wattsupwiththat My engine will unplug the scam.  Read tweets to find out how.
My engine "unplugs" this "save the world" fraud by eliminating CO2 via engine and NH3, which can be cheaper than oil.  At $1/gal equivalent to gasoline, NH3 would be use over fossil fuels.  The NH3 can be MADE FROM HOME, and thus unplug energy control as a means of control. https://t.co/KSIUiYB72N
@m_recluse @stephphilip8 Ok, stay on the ground for 100-200 more years.  Have fun while I fly around the world....
@SpeakerPelosi There are steps to get to zero carbon.  Several key elements are needed.  I have those solutions in the works.  Without them you will delay zero carbon by 20-30 years.  Is that what you want?  With this technology I can take this entire issue away from Dems.  Understand?
@SpeakerPelosi Nancy, I have a valid solution to getting zero carbon.  There is no need for subsidies, or government intervention.  	Do you want to get to zero carbon ASAP?  	Happy to discuss it with you, but ignoring real solutions is inaction on climate.  Both Dem and Repub can agree with it.
Until ALL subsidies are REMOVED, we won't have true price signals and therefore will not know when NH3 is cheaper than gasoline.  People are making junk technology to get subsidies instead of doing their homework and getting real solutions like I have.  This robs real solutions.&gt;
If solar farms can be built without subsidy and make electricity for 1.5 cent/kwh without grid costs, then the cost of NH3 would be $0.015 x 1.55 x 33.7 = $0.78/gallon equiv to gasoline, or 26 c/gal NH3 by volume.  Run cars, trucks and airplane from this NH3.  NEED NEW ENGINE!
Solar farms in places like AZ might work as I tweet.  They should forget the transmission line because the energy will NOT be needed during the day.  They should make NH3 instead.  This would cut costs from 2.5 to 1.5 cents/kwh by ELIMINATING grid costs of 1 cent/kwh.....&gt;
Renewable energy should be on individual houses and buildings via solar.  No wind or solar farms are needed.  You size it to get through the year and store enough to get through long periods of time when renewables don't work.  Not that hard to understand folk!  Easy concept.
One of the reasons "fossil fuels"  (NOT from fossils, btw) work is because they are liquids that can be stored a long time and used quickly and restored from many areas.  A "renewable" needs these characteristics to be functional.  Batteries won't even come close by 20-50 times.
Did they not realize that people don't like to live in windy areas and that places where wind is nearly constant are generally remote and would require long and expensive power lines, if at all possible, like the Aleutian islands?  Why such shocking lack of insight?
When all this "renewable energy" stuff started, did they not understand you needed to store energy for night use and winter use?  Did they not understand that cold and still go together at times, as well as overcast/cloudy weather?  That they can persists for week or months? https://t.co/GaJuDJtNnv
Could "they" not realize the "duck curve" would result when enough houses had PV panels along with solar farms and wind?  Not hard to see, yet they don't have a solution to energy storage such as NH3.  How can that be?  Insane incompetence at the least, I would say.  What gives? https://t.co/0COxZipENt
@TrumpsDC Getting to zero carbon IS doable folks.  I love CO2!  NH3 allows   independence from oil at $1/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  How?  Via  new engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3, and solar thermal + NH3 maker.   This engine works in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings,  anywhere.
@Jamespatriot1 James, My engine is designed for AIRPLANES first, and then for cars, Trucks, boats, houses etc.  No need for a tunnel.  Flying will be cheaper than driving.  When NH3 is lower cost, then use it.  Otherwise use gasoline/Diesel/Jet A/100LL as available.  CO2 is a good thing.
@Seasunned1 @stephphilip8 Where is this Tesla free energy?  Does a prop turn with free energy?  No!  Does a wheel torque with free energy?  No.  You need the device(s) for free energy.  Where are they?  What are they?
@FatherLeoFeeds You can get to zero carbon via my new engine, solar thermal on house and NH3 maker via engine electricity.  Make fuel, use in car, airplane, trucks, etc.  No need for socialism to get to lower costs with NH3 as the fuel.  NH3 is need to make renewable energy work, btw.
@EricMBledsoe It is just a socialist takeover by a want to be control freaks who want to micro manage your life.  CO2 is irrelevant.  Lower costs can be had via NH3.  Until then, use fossil fuel.
@EricMBledsoe Getting to zero carbon IS doable folks.  I love CO2!  NH3 allows   independence from oil at $1/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  How?  Via  new engine that can use 5 fuels and NH3, and solar thermal + NH3 maker.   This engine works in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings,  anywhere.
@tomselliott @AOC Her take over is not needed to get to zero carbon.  We will use NH3 when/if NH3 is CHEAPER than gasoline/Diesel/propane/JetA/100LL or Nat Gas.  Key is new engine that can run all 6 fuels and NH3.  Install new engine and get 100 mpg, not 25 with old.  CO2 irrelevant.  Costs are.

@RealTT2020 @jimbcbs4 @spbucher CO2 is NOT relevant. Getting to NH3 to cut costs is.  My engine can run 5 fuels and NH3.  Quickest path to lower costs and zero carbon.  We use NH3 when/if it is LOWER cost than gasoline/Diesel/propane/JetA/100LL/Nat Gas, else we use lowest cost fuel.  Win win.

@FionaGiselle1 @thebestcloser Nice list of Dems that need to go...to jail.
@voteoutnow @HenryK_B_ @MikeHudema You misunderstand.  I love CO2 and would triple it if I could.  Zero carbon is not important to me.  Getting lower fuel costs is.  NH3 could be made for $1/gal from house.  Store it.  Use it during winter when renewable energy does not work, or night.  Use in airplane, cars too.
@jimsand1718 @lacerci65 @FairyQ15 @BreitbartNews Was not kind to her father either....
@MAGA2ARIGHTS @WashTimes Along with half the other species....
@ScottCallaway @SarahBanasMills The engine would go in a small tool shed outside or a utility room.  As quiet as an electric motor...
@ScottCallaway @SarahBanasMills No, the air is expanded to below twice ambient pressure, which results in no shock wave like most engines.  Just quiet air coming out.  The motor is actually totally insulated too to keep it warm.
@WarwickWatchRI Yes, the socialism is insane and the technology they want us to buy is junk, but the reality is we can get cheaply to zero carbon.  My tweets show this, and I love CO2.  Why go to NH3?  Cheaper than fossil fuels....

@JackChristman Look, this does not take a moon shot.  It takes a few million in R&amp;D which I am doing now.  We can get to zero carbon via new engine type, solar thermal, and NH3 maker all from houses, no wind or farms needed.  We go to NH3 if and when it is cheaper than fossil fuels.  $1/gal e.
@mattdizwhitlock The #GreenNewDeal is total nonsense and will actually SLOW the move to NH3 which can be cheaper than gasoline.  Either way, NH3 or gasoline/Diesel/Jet A/Propane, it does not matter as CO2 is not an issue.

@charliekirk11 An "X" is an unknown quantity, and a "spurt" is a drip under pressure.  Sound like they are all "x-spurts" and not Experts.
@Sema4Texas If they used NH3, there would be zero mess to clean up and no impact to the environment....  My engine can have airplanes flying on NH3 at $1/gal e, which is 1/4-1/3rd the cost of Jet A.
@JacksThorns @AOC @JStein_WaPo In a semi truck, using $1/gal e fuel vs $2.5/gal Diesel (no tax) plus engine gives me a 4x advantage over the competition in fuel costs.  Lots of money to be made/saved!
@JacksThorns @AOC @JStein_WaPo CO2 has zero to do with climate or how it changes, usually in cycles.  The theory was wrong in 1820 when Fourier said it, and it wrong today.  Read my tweets if you don't believe me.  The fraud of AGW is massive, systemic and criminal, all to rip off people.
@JacksThorns @AOC @JStein_WaPo You misunderstand, I LOOOOOVE carbon.  If I could, I would TRIPLE CO2.  I want NH3 to be independent from oil and to cut costs.  NH3 can be $1/gal equivalent to gasoline.  Cheap flying!  I have zero problem using carbon fuels.

@nowthisnews @JosephNSanberg The #GreenNewDeal will actually slow the move to zero carbon.  No carbon tax or you slow move to NH3 via engine.  Read my tweets.  The quickest path to no Carbon is my engine and NH3.  Deal is bad deal and silly at the core.

@howiedubz @DiamondandSilk Lock them all up!
@AllenWest No need for any #GreenNewDeal  especially the crazy socialism control freak part.  Silly nonsense.  If they want to get to zero carbon, my tech is the fastest way.  I want NH3 for independence, not zero CO2.  More CO2 is better for earth's plants.  Either way, NH3 will be cheaper

@AmyMek How about arresting them, fining them millions (send bill to country of origin) and then deporting them at old countries costs.  Also, ban any Islamic immigration.
@WUTOUR We are waiting for key elements such as my engine and NH3 as part of the system.  Energy storage is the missing link and NH3 is the fuel via renewable energy electricity.  NH3 in cars, trucks, airplane and more.  Electric cars and airplanes are a JOKE.  16 times more cost than...

@SteveSGoddard @ewarren How to cut the cost of driving.  1) install my engine in car.  	2) get 4x fuel economy (100 mpg)	3) solar and NH3 maker	4) Use NH3 at $1/gal e		Better yet, fly and avoid road tax, tires and brakes = fuel at 200 mph....Like free fuel!

@VikingWilli I also worked in Motorenbau (engine manufacturing) at Porsche in Suffenhausen, near Stuttgart in 1986.  I worked with a lot of companies doing airbags and Porsche engineers were some of the best.  I did their inflators and sensors too.

@VikingWilli Nice.  I did the airbag sensors for BMW back in the late 1980's, and then inflators in 1990's.  What software did you use?  Catia?
@jjauthor Why is most of this stuff hidden?  What are they hiding it for?  Crimes?  Of course.  Declas or go to jail.
@SarahBanasMills No need for any wind mills or solar farms.  All can be done on house solar thermal, which is cheaper than PV panels.  Add engine to make electricity and distill water, plus NH3 maker and you have zero carbon for house, cars, truck, farm equipment...  Can also run on 5 fuels...
@GasBuddyDan A carbon tax will make buying new engine MORE expensive, thus delaying the quickest path to NH3 via engine.  A CARBON TAX will DELAY path to zero carbon, not quicken it!!!  Fuels are KEY to bridge intermediate power from renewable energy.  NH3 is the fuel.  Engine+NH3 key to 0 C.

@riley_momma NH3 will become the fuel for airplanes.  My new engine will run on gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, propane and NH3.  To get to zero carbon requires the ability to use NH3.  First get engine in cars, trucks, airplanes, buildings using 5 fuels, then switch to NH3 when cheaper
@AdamParkhomenko Why is this important?
@natureslover_s Bush's SS name?
@SenMarkey Sen.  There is a way to get to zero Carbon MUCH faster than what your plan has by 20-30 years.  No need for any of the socialism.  The energy savings will pay for healthcare and it will bring all out of poverty.  The #GreenNewDeal will bankrupts us.  Happy to discuss it.
@SebGorka @KurtSchlichter @stinchfield1776 @RecoilMag Seb, my engine can run on 5 fuels and NH3 (no C).  NH3 is made by solar and engine.  100% zero carbon.  I want independence from crazy AOC types more than I want to fertilize plants via carbon fuels.  No grid needed.  Key security thing too.  Airplanes, cars, trucks, buildings.
@sunrisemvmt @SpeakerPelosi No need for any "deal"...  Just need my engine systems and NH3 made by solar on houses.  No wind or solar plants, but can use existing.  This "plan" will SLOW "progress" to zero carbon by 20-30 years.  My tech is fastest to zero C.  No socialism needed.
@scrowder Steve, My engine systems and NH3 via solar thermal can get  us to 100% zero carbon for house, car(s), boat, airplane etc.  This is doable.  Happy to come on program and explain.  I love CO2, but independence from crazy people like AOC is more important than making CO2 for plants.
@CFACT Look, there is a way to get to zero carbon.  My engine systems can do it for less than current.  Stop it.  People want to be independent from crazy CO2 nonsense fraud and NH3 is the way out.  New engines are needed, like mine.  All private, no government needed.
@JunkScience @AOC Yes it is a fail, but there IS a way to do it via NH3.  Stop being ignorant and read my tweets.  Either we get ahead of this CO2 scam by going zero carbon with optional carbon fuels (5) or we all become a socialist insanity state.  My engine pulls the rug out from under them....
@ArthurSchwartz @CoryBooker @AOC Look, zero carbon is possible.  I calculate it on my tweets.  Wake up.  NH3 will be cheaper than gasoline.  Go to NH3 to stop the CO2 NAZI socialists.  People want independent energy.  My engine can give it... or we all become Venezuelan
@SenateGOP You want to win elections?  You need to get out ahead of this.  Fact is zero carbon via NH3 is possible.  No grid will be needed.  Look past your nose. No new deal nonsense. No socialism either.  Independence from OIL.  People don't want carbon taxes or oil.  independence!
@SenateGOP Look, zero carbon is very doable.  Read my tweets.  Pull you head out.  Either you listen to the facts or we all will be sucked into this crazy socialism insanity.  Happy to discuss it with you, or just read my tweets.  NH3 is the fuel.  My engine is key.  15-20 years....&gt;
@MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau @theJagmeetSingh No need for political will, just great technology, like my engine.  Stop trying to rip off tax payers with expensive nonsense.   Not needed.  Can run airplanes, cars, trucks, houses, farms, businesses, everything with it.  No waves needed or wind.
@Cernovich Mike, my engine can get us to zero carbon.  NH3 is the fuel.  Can run on 5 fuels and NH3. Airplane, cars, trucks...all. New engine needed due to NH3 issues and making other fuels also able to run.  All doable.  BTW, If I could I would triple the CO2, but independence better.
@dbongino My engine can get us to zero carbon airplanes, roadable seplanes to be exact.   AOC has no clue.  I am going zero carbon to not be jerked around by carbon NAZIs like AOC and Wacky Mackey.  CO2 is a good thing, but independence is better.  NH3 can be cheaper than gasoline and NG.
@AOC No need for any of this "deal" at all.  My engine can get us to zero carbon much faster than anything AOC is proposing.  All this "deal" does is slow down progress in energy with bad ideas that don't work.  Happy to discuss it.
@Mr2020LA Snake, yes, correct.  My engine can get us to zero carbon via NH3.  I calculate it on tweets if you don't believe me.  Pull this "green" rug out from under them via my engine.  Can use 5 fuels and NH3.  Flying cheaper than driving or train.  Step by step.
@Surabees Yes, it has zero to do with getting to zero carbon.  My engine can get us there ASAP.  How? read tweets.  Cheaper than current Otto/Diesel and 16 times less than electric cars.  Saves money.
@NYGovCuomo Andrew, zero carbon is possible, but not via your nonsense.  All will go bankrupt...heads up!  My engine system needs no grid.  100% carbon free, year around.  Run airplane, cars, boats, buildings, everything.  Stop ripping off tax payers.  You are SLOWING progress to Zero Carbon
@republicanvsion Hey GOP, why don't you take some time and listen to me...  Zero carbon is very possible with my engine and a few more pieces to the puzzle.  Can be in cars, trucks, boats, airplane, houses, everything....100% zero carbon.  Happy to discuss.  AOC has NO clue how.
@jtLOL There is a way to get to zero carbon, but not by some crazy "deal" that will actually slow progress.  read my tweets.  I spell it out.   Happy to discuss it.
@AmazonWatch @AOC The "deal" is 100% NOT needed and will SLOW progress to 100% zero carbon.  I spell it out.  This deal is about corruption and sending money to stupid ideas that don't work.  My engine can get us there ASAP.  AOC has no clue what is needed.  There are missing links to no carbon.
@HenryK_B_ Actually, read my tweets, zero carbon is very doable.  I spell it out.  NH3 is the new fuel.  My engine can run 5 carbon fuels and NH3.  New engine needed to make work.  House solar is all that is needed.  No wind, but can use it.
@GrrrGraphics @AOC @SpeakerPelosi Zero carbon is very doable with my engine tech.  read my tweets.  Happy to explain how to pull the rug out from the carbon nonsense via engine and NH3 that is cheaper than gasoline, etc.  Run cars, airplanes, boats, houses...all with this.  I calculate it on the tweets.
@RealBPhil Brian, yes it is nonsense, but getting to zero carbon is very doable and can be done rather fast.  Read my tweets.  I spell it out.  NH3 will be cheaper than gasoline.  No grid needed.  Independent from oil.  Win both sides.  Happy to discuss.  BTW, more CO2 is a good thing...
@Dlashof Dan, My engine technology can get us to zero carbon much faster (20-30 years?) than anything this so called "deal" has.  Read my tweets if you want zero carbon.  There are steps and technology needed to get there...  Discuss?
@mitchellvii Yes the CO2 nonsense is a fraud, but who cares if NH3 can be cheaper than gasoline???  Wake up Bill.  I calculate it in my tweets.  My engine will allow 5 fuels and NH3, thus allowing carbon lovers to make more, and the CO2 haters to feel good about no CO2.  In end...no grid.
@DineshDSouza This can all be done with PRIVATE money.  Fossil fuels are needed to bridge to NH3.  Can run cars, trucks, airplanes (small and large), boats, houses, ...anything that now uses F fuels.  Can still use F fuels.  Choice.  No force needed.  No grid needed.  Want to discuss?  PM.
@DineshDSouza Dinesh, there is a way to get to zero carbon with NH3.  Read my tweets.   New type of IC engine.  Run 5 fuels and NH3.  100 mpg vs 25 mpg in old.  Get engine in lots of cars...switch to NH3 when cheaper.  $1/gal e for NH3.  Very doable.  Run all with it.  Fuel to bridge.  Discuss
A proper renewable energy system must have liquid fuel storage to bridge the gap when renewable sources don't work.  It is cheaper to do a pipeline of NH3 than it is to build an electrical power line system to transport energy.  Without NH3, we can't get to zero carbon.
@trumptrain1111 @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller I have a solution to getting ZERO CARBON ASAP.  the #GreenNewDeal is a #GreenNewDisaster that won't work.  There are step needed.  Fossil fuels are needed to bridge to NH3.  New engine needed.  Happy to discuss.
@cenkuygur Happy to explain to you how to get to zero carbon and what is needed. PM me
Why is it that only last month has a NH3 system be tried?  Wind - electricity - NH3 made - burned in turbine.  Batteries cannot supply anywhere near the characteristics needed to bridge the gap of grid power during nights, and long cold winters.  Wake up.  All just a scam.
I find it telling that the so called "smart" people started out on the "renewable" energy path and did not realize what would happen as variable power mixes with fix power (coal and Nuclear).  Are they that dumb?  Amazing that they still can't see that NH3 (a fuel) is NEEDED....&gt;
To get to zero carbon you need my engine and technology systems.  You can't get there with electric cars, batteries and other nonsense.  My technology will be CHEAPER than current and allows NH3 and 5 carbon fuels.  Year around zero grid system.  Wake up people.  Very doable.
@mitchellvii Bill, I have a viable solution to get to zero CO2.  AOC nonsense will just prolong.  NH3 will be the fuel, yet we can still use old fossil fuels if cheaper.  If GOP does not understand this, they will be gone.  Solve energy, win elections.  Don't, toast.  BTW, I LOVE CO2. win-win
@WeForgetTo @POTUS If they truly wanted to get to zero carbon, they would follow the steps I listed in my tweets.  Fossil fuels are required to get there due to chicken and eff problem.  Once there, energy will be very cheap.  We can't get there with the insane #GreenNewDeal . It won't work.
@thehill Whitaker was awesome....
@armani_salado All it takes to zero out fossil fuel is my engine technology.  Stop wasting time on protesting.  UNPLUG oil via NH3 and my technology.  Happy to discuss, but please stop being ignorant slaves....
@ananavarro Just like Santa Claus, I am making my list (of all pols who are energy hypocrites), checking it twice (giving you many chances), going to find out who really wants to solve energy, natty or nice.  Yes, this technology is coming to every town, car, truck, boat, house, airplane....
@ananavarro Have way to get to zero carbon via my engine systems.  Happy to discuss it.  Will cost less than current engine technology.  #GreenNewDeal clearly WON'T work.  New technology needed to get 100% zero carbon.  I spell it out in tweets.  Solve energy....win any election.
@CGTNOfficial What a waste.  Outdated totally.... wake up.
@jjauthor Could it be?  My engine will SOLVE their so called Climate Change.  Not one will even discuss it, let alone support.  They want power and money ($49 trillion) and that is it.  CO2 is a means to rip us all off.  I list the steps to get to ZERO CARBON.  #GreenNewDeal won't work.
@JoinAtomic My new engine solves CO2 and energy problem.  Nothing bigger.  Happy to discuss.
@PatriotInnovat1 @realDonaldTrump Already have.  He has his views.  My engine will BANKRUPT Tesla and his battery nonsense.  16 times less costs...but he won't listen because he believes what he believes.  Like a religion to him...
@PatriotInnovat1 @realDonaldTrump By having engine that runs on fossil fuels (5) AND NH3 both sides can claim victory.  Dems solve "climate change" and Repubs have low cost energy to power economy.  No carbon taxes.  No NWO.  No forcing to use NH3.  No electric car nonsense.  Roadable seaplanes, door to door!
@PatriotInnovat1 @realDonaldTrump The way Trump can help is to put the word out (tweet) after he has meeting with me.  If he likes it, then he finds me 10 people I interview.  We do deal.  Trump then can claim he helped solve energy.  Solve CO2 and you unplug the globalists and zero out Petrol dollar.  HUUGE!
@PatriotInnovat1 @realDonaldTrump Already have.  This is the problem with central government.  		Also, I don't want government investment...immoral.  Private is the goal.  Trump might know a few smart people who would LISTEN to what I have to say and find some willing to help.  Solving energy would be a big win!
You can add power to car, dolly or trailer.  Up to you.  Each has advantages.  Can change out if needed.  Plug and play.  Yes, a combustion engine that is plug and play....  Read that 1000 times.  This ain't your Daddy's Diesel engine....
Power can be added to the trailer too.  Instead of a power dolly, put the power in the trailer too.  The trailer engine system stays with the trailer and runs the power needs when camping.  Trailer wheels provide power to move added weight.
By adding 4 more engine in car (200 HP more, 50 each), and 2-4 in dolly (100-200 HP), the car goes from 200 HP to 500-600 HP to tow trailer.  Plenty of power.  Done towing, remove dolly and 4 motors.  Back to 200 HP.  Could leave 4 extra in car too.   Same economy.  How?  Discuss
The engine can also allow "power dollies" to pull large trailers.  The car can have a simple hitch and the dolly does the work of tongue load and added power for trailer.  You could also add motors to car plus power dolly.  From 4 motors in car, to 8 in car, and 2-4 dolly....&gt;
Say you want balanced power front and back.  Put two front and two rear.  No problem.  Want more power?  Add two front and two back.  Now have twice the power, but SAME economy.  Understand?
Say someone likes rear drive better than front drive.  OK, move motors from the front to the back.  Put 4 in back to burn rubber, and 1 up front for snow driving.  Now you can "drag race" with smoking tires, yet drive with front wheel drive in snow.  Easy to customize.
Why have "power slots" in car engine.  Let's say someone wants an economy car with all wheel drive.  Ok.  Front has 3 motors, back has 1.    		You install a 4 slot drive front and back.  You leave out 1 motor in front and three in back.  3 front, 1 back.  Upgrade is simple.  Add.
Understand that old engines are custom to the product, whereas my engine system can be added to like memory in a computer.  Want 1000 HP in Corvette, just add more.  Not a big deal.  Have "memory slots" (Power slots) to add or take away power just like computers have....&gt;
@wdcollinsworth Yes, they are scammers and frauds.  They would be low level clerks or shady used car sales people if it were not for the gov tit.  Would you hire AOC?  How about Bernie?  Angry at customers, no idea what to do, all confidence on failed business model (socialism).
The same motor elements could run the entire fleet of Cessna prop engine airplanes.  Just add more motors.  From small to large.  Unlike Lycoming that requires new engine for each size.  All engines are "multi-engined" with fewer motors for low power and more for high power.
My engine can have one size and run the entire track hoe line of CAT, for example from 25 hp to the largest.  How?  Modular power.  Want more power, add more.  NOT a big deal like it is in old single engine system.  This is HUUUUUGE to CAT.  Make or break CAT....Understand?
Again, my engine can go in all vehicles, track hoes, boats, houses, campers, and more.  This is not like a Tesla where all the work only applies to one car model.  Work of engine R&amp;D goes to 1000's of products.  Comprehensive.  From 25 hp to 6000 hp.  Modular power!  Understand?
Note, even if we could change out engines in old cars with new engine, trucks are a big problem, and so are airplanes.  My engine allows all Cessna prop airplanes to be fitted with new engine and run on NH3.  Same with trucks.  The economy in truck would be over 2-3x current.
Since NH3 is like propane in liquid/gas pressues, you need a "propane" type tanks in car already.  My engine already has special tanks that allow propane, and adding more is no big deal.  Current cars/trucks don't have propane due to high costs of fuel and duel fuel issues.
Here is why my engine and "fossil" fuels are NEEDED to go from current CO2 to zero carbon.  		1) you need to decrease the fuel used.  New engine is 4x mileage over old.  25 mpg to 100 mpg, just like Tesla.	2) You need engines that can burn NH3 and other fuels.  Fuel cells can't.
Oh, I forgot to factor in new engine weight at 1 lbs/hp vs 3 lbs/hp for a  Buick engine with transmission.  200 hp x 3 = 600 lbs.  2/3 x 600 = 400 lbs, plus 25 = 425 lbs LIGHTER.  Put more tanks in and get 1000 mile range on NH3...option. https://t.co/GHFRdiXZbY …
You can't take old engine out and put in new without crash tests for airbags.  Old engines cannot be retrofitted like you can with propane due to the HIGH temperatures needed for NH3.  Having duel fuel (NH4 + carbon fuel) defeats the purpose.  NObody will want this....
@PatriotInnovat1 Needs NH3 to bridge.  Use panels to make NH3.  Ship NH3 to cold climates as fuel.  My engine will run on NH3, gasoline, Diesel, jet A, 100 LL, propane and Nat Gas.  Once enough people have a way to use NH3, switch is made to NH3 when NH3 is cheaper than oil...
@SarahPalinUSA And yes, my seaplane will run on NH3, gasoline, Diesel, 100 LL, Jet A and propane, door to door, landing on streets and driving to garage for parking.  Flying will be cheaper than driving.  Massive boom for Alaska, btw.
@SarahPalinUSA Getting to zero carbon is doable with my engine technology, but not with what AOC advocates.  NH3 is the fuel.  Fossil fuels are REQUIRED to bridge until enough engines can run NH3 made from renewables.  Switch to NH3 is only when NH3 is cheaper than fossil fuel (gasoline/Diesel)
@Truth2019UK Is she talking about the Green New Deal corruption she is promoting?
@USACICI When China steals technology, all they are saying is that they are weak and have no face.  Understand?  Invent it yourself or admit failure and loss of face, in the true Chinese meaning of "face" ...
@Liz_Wheeler Clearly she lied.  		Zero carbon is possible with my engine system.  It REQUIRES fossil fuels to bridge to NH3 until enough cars can use it.  NH3 will be made by house solar thermal as well as wind and solar farms.  Switch to NH3 is when NH3 is CHEAPER than 5 major fuels.
@johnnileupdegra @Liz_Wheeler what/who is oak foundation?  What are they about?
@KimStrassel My engine could run Jet A, 100 LL, gasoline, Diesel, Propane AND NH3.  Range with gasoline 2400 miles.  With NH3 800 miles.  Door to door airplane taxis, cheaper than airliners in time and fuel costs / passenger.  Happy to discuss it.  AOC has no clue how to do this.  I do....
@KimStrassel Kimberley, there is a way to get to zero carbon via my engine technology.  I tweet about it.  What AOC advocates won't work due to technology issues.  Only need solar thermal panels on house, no wind mills or large solar farms.  Happy to discuss it with you.  BTW, CO2 is good...
This is a total scam.  Waste of electrons and paper, as well as breath and brain cells.  Who are these idiots.  If they want zero carbon, there are things that need to be invented.  Happy to discuss it.  Just stop the insanity already....		https://t.co/ZwTjZPRjzZ
@thewoman62 The aerodynamic center of a delta is at the center of area.  From sub sonic to super sonic the point of balance remains at the center of area, whereas in a glider/Boeing airliner wing shape the balance point moves back, causing pitch trim issues.  Hence the shape.
@thewoman62 I meant aerodynamically....
@RepJeffries You just destroyed any assumption of your credibility.   Get out....
@RepJeffries What a waste of time.  Silly nonsense questions....  Get a clue or get out...
@phil4gop @RepJeffries The Dems are indeed very confused.  We all want to know how such ignorant people got elected?
Yes, the Green New Deal is lots of socialism wrapped in bad technology that will delay zero carbon point by 20-30 years.  My engine is the fastest way to zero carbon, and can use 5 carbon fuels in the mean time.  Install engine in car and meet IPCC 80% CO2 reduction instantly! https://t.co/u7rkUUrkr3
@thewoman62 Notice the shape....  Understand why?
Again, NH3 does not behave like carbon fuels.  The combustion has several steps that slow it down by around 5 times.  This requires higher temperature well above auto-ignition to make work.  NOx then issue.  How to solve?  My engine! https://t.co/9OoMkfH9jH
@StanSoFunny Graph on page 5 is a key to NH3 combustion.  Notice the slope  of the ignition curve for NH3 (bowl shaped) vs N-hetane.  Notice that  NH3 is 1300K vs 900k for N-heptane.   https://t.co/eyR2YXEYU0 …
@StanSoFunny @elonmusk Only tweets so far.  Yes, I need to make a web page, but I don't have patents yet, so I am not sure how to make one without loss of rights....
@StanSoFunny several recent tweets.
@StanSoFunny @elonmusk By buying car with new engine, you get 4 times better economy.  25 mpg to 100 mpg e.  You can use gasoline/Diesel/propane/Jet A/100LL and get 75% less fuel and 75% less CO2.  When lots of cars can do this, NH3 can then be introduced.  Switch made...zero carbon.  Understand?
@StanSoFunny @elonmusk Fuel cells can use NH3, but they can't use other fuels.  Who would buy a fuel cell car without NH3 stations?  Nobody.  Who would sell NH3 without cars that can use it?  Nobody.  Chicken and egg problem.  My engine solves this by being able to use 5 fuels and NH3.
@StanSoFunny @elonmusk There is no engine that burns or uses NH3 well.  I explain this in part in my tweets.  My engine will be able to burn it, as well as 5 other fuels.  No engine I know of can do that due to the layout of Otto/Diesel/turbo engines.  NH3 is key to zero carbon.  Need new engines.
@StanSoFunny Drawbacks compared to what?  Gasoline?  Electrics?		Big one is that it is hard to burn.  New engines will be needed to do 100% NH3 combustion.  Fuel cells have lots of negatives too.  		Ammonia can be made via electricity relatively easily.  Have you viewed the PDFs I tweeted?
Interesting view of CO2 and climate change. https://t.co/iUFWSBm4aW
Nice graph of CO2 and impact.  Clearly CO2 is not an issue and could triple without any issues. https://t.co/bisQMUUxNW
@ArchKennedy Most Dems are not much smarter tha @AOC.  Her #GreenNewDeal will SLOW the move to NH3 (fuel of the future) which only now people realize is needed to fill the gaps in renewable energy.
@KiayannaLove @AOC Love, there is a way to get to zero carbon via my engine, solar thermal, store and NH3 maker.  It also can use 5 carbon fuels.... Grid needs NH3 to accept more renewables.  Fuel store critical to fill gaps.  Cars now can't run on NH3, but mine will be able.  New tech needed to do
@LaylaAlisha11 They AGW people are slowly realizing that a fuel is needed to bridge the long periods of cold winters found in America.  NH3 is the fuel, but it can't be used well in old cars.  Need carbon fuels (gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, propane) plus NH3 to bridge.  Fuel store key.
@LaylaAlisha11 Layla, there is a way to get to zero carbon via my engine systems.  read tweets.  AOC's plan will prolong and bankrupt us all.  End game is NH3 with engine that can run on all (5) fuels.   When NH3 is cheapest, we all switch to NH3 save $$$.  Not before.  Step by step.
The #GreenNewDeal is actually a #GreenNewDisaster for getting the carbon out.  It appears that CO2 is just a means to get to full blown crazy control of every aspect of our lives, from forcing trains (100 year old junk) to electric cars (16 times more costly than my tech) on us.
The #GreenNewDeal  will actually hinder progress to zero carbon.   I spell it out in my tweets.  There are many things needed to go zero carbon.  My technology is a path, perhaps the shortest and least cost path to zero carbon.  Electrification will SLOW path, not speed it.
@dmills3710 @POTUS @freedomcaucus @GenFlynn @gatewaypundit Men wear suits,  does that make them cult members?  All of their white outfits are different.  Let them wear what they want, OK?  Chill.  Their politics is what the issue is.
@AOC Listen and learn what is needed before you present a plan that will DELAY zero carbon by 20-40 years.  OK?  I am happy to discuss it with you and give you a clear path to zero carbon.  My tweets go into it.  Ignorance is not bliss...it is very very costly.
@AOC My engine system is the only way to truly approach the goal of zero carbon.  Look up the "duck curve" and realize what is going to happen.  Smart grid is NOT needed either.  In essence you are wasting trillions and SLOWING (!!!) progress to zero carbon.  Listen and learn....&gt;
@AOC @AOC  If you want to get to zero carbon, there are steps and technologies that are needed.  You CANNOT get there with just wind and solar.  Won't work.  You need NH3 or other fuel to bridge.  That requires combustion or fuel cells that can handle the loads.  My engine system....&gt;
@Stucashx @A_Milewski @TheAssay Here are two reports on safety of NH3.  		https://t.co/kzZSTDAdKK
@RealSaavedra Let's start with AOC....
@dmills3710 @POTUS Born in USA and have both parents citizens at time of birth.  All three....
@twilight19521 @CAS5050 @graceligon @AOC Nor what is in her head.
@twilight19521 @CAS5050 @graceligon @AOC Getting to zero carbon is possible with MY ENGINE technology, but not with current stuff.  Why NH3?  I can be CHEAPER than gasoline via my engine and solar thermal.  $1/gal equiv to gasoline.  Cheap flying for me.  BTW, I would TRIPLE CO2 if I could....
@JKCorden Exchange bad guy with stupid gal and then replay.
@Maximus_4EVR @realhalseynews I wonder what they have on him?  Must be very bad...
@twilight19521 @CAS5050 @graceligon @AOC Cheaper than gasoline, Diesel, Propane and other fuels.  It is a classic chicken and egg problem.  My engine in lots of cars will allow NH3 to become a transit fuel and zero carbon.  He does not understand how to do this....  Her plan is silly at best, insane in reality.
@twilight19521 @CAS5050 @graceligon @AOC Bill, AOC has no idea how to get to zero carbon. I do. The fuel will be NH3 made from solar thermal and wind.  My engine will allow 5 fuels and NH3.  Your car can't do that for sure.  There are steps.  AOC has no clue what they are.  NH3 will be the fuel when it is CHEAPER....
@JKCorden Is she talking about Hillary and Obama?
@EcoSenseNow @NASA There is a way to get to zero carbon for cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, buildings and more, but not via some "green new deal" nonsense.  Real engineering will lead to cheaper energy via NH3.  BTW, more carbon is better...
@bbusa617 She has NO idea how to get to zero carbon.  I do.  read my tweets.  There are many pieces to this puzzle.  Several are still missing.  I am working on them daily.  Her plan will fail, just like Stalin's green new deal failed.  Engineering is what is needed, not ignorant politics.
@CAS5050 @AOC There is a way to get to zero carbon.  I tweet about it.  Working on it daily.  But what AOC proposes will actually prolong the move to zero carbon. She has no idea what is needed.  I do.  Several key elements are still needed.  I am working on them.  BTW, flying will be cheaper.
@josrzn I try to weed out the fools who don't have a clue.  Happy to debate it if you are serious.  I don't bargain with physics, I obey it and it makes my engine do the needed work.  Simple concept.
@justicedems @RepMaxineWaters @ChrisMurphyCT @amyklobuchar @AOC @sunrisemvmt If you want to get to zero carbon, read my tweets.  I spell it out what is needed.  AOC's plan can't work.  My technology will work and cost less than current Otto/Diesel engines.  Happy to discuss.  Both Dems and Repubs can agree on this, but not AOC's plan.  Discuss?
@RashidaTlaib Rashida, there is a way to get to zero carbon.  My technology.  I know of no other way.  AOC's plan will fail.  Why?  Needed steps are missing.  Energy will become very cheap.  Arab states bankrupt. No need for oil in cars, trucks, airplane, boats, houses/buildings and more.
@JunkScience @AOC Steve, there is a way to get to zero carbon via NH3 and my new engine type.  I do the math in my tweets.  Must run 5 fuels, NH3, and solar thermal, as well as solar thermal panels and store.  No grids needed via this tech.  AOC's plan will fail like Stalin's...
@JesseKellyDC She has no idea how to get to zero carbon.  I do.  Her "plan" will not work and actually slow progress to zero carbon.  read my tweets to understand future of energy.  AOC will just slow things....sad.
@AlanaKStewart @RepAOC Yes the deal is insanity, but there is a way to get to zero carbon for LESS than current Otto/Diesel engine tech.  My engine is key.  Read tweets.  This AOC has no idea what it takes to get zero carbon.  I do, and for less than gasoline/Diesel fuel at our current low prices.
@JunkScience There is a way to get to zero carbon.  My engine system can run on 5 fuels and NH3.  NH3 made by solar thermal via engine.  No wind mills or PV needed.  All doable for less than current engine costs.  Happy to discuss.  This deal is total nonsense fraud.
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress It needs to be lead by at least ONE person (me) who knows how to get us there.  Your friends have no clue how to get zero carbon.  Your vision will not work.  Mine will.  Your politics won't work.  NO government is needed.  All private.  Happy to discuss.
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress Getting to zero carbon takes steps.  There are several technologies that are needed. They do NOT exist now.  You need to understand the problem before you go around proposing nonsense.  100% zero carbon for cars, trucks, boats, AIRPLANE, house/building is 100% possible.  But how?
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress Look, AOC you need to get educated about what is needed to get to zero carbon.  Lots to this.  My engine is key. I have a valid solution.  You don't.  Al Gore does not.  Jim Hansen does not.  NASA does not.  I do.  Want to get to zero carbon?  seaplaneguy@msn.com   Discuss?
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress @AOC if you actually want to get to zero carbon, there are steps.  Being ignorant of what it takes does NOT help.  Mixing social justice nonsense will only take longer.  Want to get there in 10 years?  My engine is the only known way.  Happy to discuss it when you wake up....
@AOC @chucktodd @MeetThePress None of this will work.  My engine will.  Happy to debate it.  She has no idea what is really coming, and has no vision for a real world.  My engine is the fastest way to zero carbon.  Ignorance of real engineering needed will not get us to zero carbon.  She has NO clue.
@thecjpearson They are all low energy.  They force real people to do the work.  BTW, my engine can get us to zero carbon ASAP.  How?  Read tweets.  HINT: NH3 has no carbon....  AOC has no clue how to zero out carbon.  I do....
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don Jr, with my engine, flying will be cheaper than trains, car, or airliner.  Door to door.  Your Dad needs this technology.  Border patrol needs it.  Everybody needs it.  Solve energy....  That chopper is not very safe....  BTW, Trump is the best....wish him well.
@TomFitton Yes, Tom, and it is totally not needed.  If you personally want to be zero carbon in house, car, airplane, boat, etc., my engine is the fastest path and less than current engine tech.  This "deal" will SLOW the path to zero carbon by many many years....  Happy to discuss it....
@danielaoertli Don't worry, my engine can get us to zero carbon for those who want it, and all regular people to use 5 other fuels or NH3, whichever is cheapest.  My technology is the fastest and lowest cost way to zero carbon with the least disruption.
@digcinema @jjyeackle @RepAdamSchiff David, no, it will slow the path to zero carbon.  Why?  read my tweets.  I spell it out.  All this plan will do is make well connected people very rich and the rest of us poor.  My engine is the fastest way to zero carbon.  Not even close....
@D5Gazette @KimStrassel Kim, yes, they are crazy, but that said, I have a way to get to zero carbon for LESS than current cost of things.  read tweets.  New type of engine system with solar thermal and NH3, that can also use 6 carbon fuels.  Solves chicken and egg problem and gets us to low fuel costs.
@mzb93 This will not do anything but enslave you.  If you want independence from oil, my engine can get you there.  This "deal" is a way to make friends rich and enslave humanity.
@elliemcohen1 If you want to understand what is needed to get to zero carbon ASAP, read my tweets.  I spell it out and calculated it for you.  This proposal would set us all back 20-30 years and slow the path to zero carbon.  Why?  Read tweets.  They have NO idea what is needed to do zero C!
@Calibamawife @PSDesertDolphin @charliekirk11 Yes, it is insane and ignorant of what is needed to get to zero carbon.  I spell it out in my tweets.  Both pro and con sides to CO2 can agree with my engine and systems when they honestly understand them.  Green New deal will SLOW path to zero....  Read tweets.
@KickCorridor It will SLOW the path to zero carbon.  Why?  read my tweets.  I spell it out....
@josrzn The green new deal is NOT needed and would slow progress to zero carbon.  I spell it out in my tweets how to get to zero carbon ASAP.  Read tweets.  Happy to discuss.
@techreview No need for it.  My engine systems can get us ASAP to zero carbon.  Read my tweets.  This New deal nonsense proposal would SLOW progress to zero carbon.  Why?  Read tweets.  Happy to discuss....
@StanSoFunny @FeliniTommy @RepRutherfordFL @AOC PM me when you have read the tweets.  Have a list of questions.  Keep notes as you read tweets.  Mark the date so I can go to tweet.  OK?  I am going to help you see the future of energy.  Interested?  It will take some time and thought.  Are you up to it?  You will enjoy this...
@StanSoFunny @FeliniTommy @RepRutherfordFL @AOC @USNavy Well, we will see if Tommy is smarter than Stan.  Get to reading the tweets....
@FeliniTommy @StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Tommy boy, read my tweets.  We are going to see who is smarter.  You are Stan?  Quiz coming....
@StanSoFunny @FeliniTommy @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Stan, let's see if you are smarter than Tommy boy junior.  		Have you read my tweets?  Yes or no?  		If no, then start reading.  I will quiz you.  		Same with Tommy boy.  		Let's see who can answer my questions best.  		Stan vs Tommy boy....
@FeliniTommy @StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Tommy, you are literally too dumb to insult....I don't give up.  Understand?
@FeliniTommy @StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Tommy boy, back off and leave the guy alone.  Understand?
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC No, be like Thomas Sowell or Justice Thomas.  They know what is up.  Barack is CIA front guy, empty suit, fake, and a fraud.   He hates you deep down.  He uses you for his power and gain.  He wants you dependent.  I want you INDEPENDENT....  My engine can do that....
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Agreed.  My engine is the fastest way to low energy costs.  NH3 is will be the lowest costs and so happens to be zero carbon.  I care about making fuel independent of oil companies.  If zero carbon, Ok, but it does not matter.  NH3 is the easiest to make from electricity.
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC No, the planet is cleaner than ever and more CO2 is better than less.  Happy to discuss CO2 and set you straight.  My engine is not about saving the planet.  It is about freedom from idiots like AOC.  Want freedom or slavery?  Make your choice....
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Envy politics is for thieves.  Are you a thief?  Or are you an engineer who can think and create?  AOC wants you dependent.  I want people independent.  Big difference.  She has no power of creation.  She can only steal stuff via the government.  Weak.  You want weakness?
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Who cares about equality?  Only slave owners.  Be yourself, which means you have value.  AOC wants power at your expense.  Her ideas are theft and she has not idea how to cut CO2.  I do.
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Stan, that 10 mil person could help me solve energy and save every person 20% of the income in fuel.  If you want to get people out of poverty they need 40 HP like my engine, not 40 acres and a mule.
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Why do you believe in @AOC?
@patricia6227 @jonz970 @my3monkees @raducom @BundyGP @sappermartin @ImabitcSumtimes @Briteeye777 @ChrisBragdon @Serremmy @briantopping66 @jemckinney76 @Tremac8 @mixxmann65 @marc_lori @allenjarzombek1 @JonnyBG05528336 @UhadMeAtCovfefe @peggie_horton @NvrHilaryClnton @JohnDoe49508744 Read my tweets...explains how to unplug the CO2 issue by going to NH3 via my engine at lower cost than gasoline.  Also, fuel for roadable seaplane at 200 mph for less than road-tax, tires and brakes.  (not used while in the air...)  Like flying for free.
@FitzSel @NewfMafia @DLoesch @KamalaHarris No, not free.  About the same cost of current cars, but 4x the fuel economy.  NOT electric.  Use any of 6 fuels and NH3 when available.
@StanSoFunny @RepRutherfordFL @AOC Alread have.  She has no idea what will work or won't.  She also does not have resources....
@RepRutherfordFL Rep, want jobs in neighborhood?  Let's discuss energy.  seaplaneguy@msn.com
@RepRutherfordFL We can get to zero carbon but not via this #GreenNewDeal nonsense.  My engine can get us there in steps.  Flying will be cheaper than driving.  Fuel (NH3) will be less than road tax, tires and brakes. (no used in air)  Read that 1000 times....  Also, 5 other fuels enabled....
#GreenNewDeal   is NOT needed.  My engine can get you to get to zero carbon faster than any other way, and still allow carbon fuels for those who thing CO2 is a good thing.  Yes, a zero carbon seaplane is very doable via NH3 and my engine.  Flying will be CHEAPER than driving....
@LaineFranz @BreitbartNews @AOC With my engine technology we can all be flying roadable seaplanes...in every garage...  Serious.  Flying will be the future.  Why?  Fuel costs less than road tax, tires and brakes.  AOC is clueless!  NH3 will be the zero Carbon fuel, and 5 other fuels will work too.
@NewfMafia @DLoesch @KamalaHarris Folks, there is a way to get to zero carbon and very cool seaplanes to boot in every garage.  How?  My engine systems.  Read tweets if you want to see the future of energy.  10 x computers in value.  Can run all cars, trucks, boats, AIRPLANES, track hoes, ATVs campers, buildings.
@DLoesch Her plan will bankrupt everybody.  My engine will give you a 20% raise.  Read tweets.  No government needed.  Just a few smart rich guys to help me get it done faster.  Happy to discuss it.  $500-1000 billion/y in USA cut in costs....by the numbers.  Yes, I am an engineer....
@DLoesch Actually, with my engine on NH3 we will all be FLYING door to door.  Why?  Cheaper, less harm to nature.  She is sooooo clueless. BTW, zero carbon is doable in steps that are less money than current Otto/Diesel engine tech.  My engine is key.  read tweets if you want to see...
@JanetTxBlessed She is a daughter of a mob thug.   She needs to be put in jail...treason actually.  What a waste of tax money.
@SenMarkey If you want to get to zero carbon, I have your solution.  Your new deal will not work and will actually delay zero carbon by 20-30 years.  Happy to discuss it, or you can just read my tweets.  The solution is comprehensive...everything included that now runs on c fuels
@BrianQuinn36 @AOC @Marie4Congress Flying will be where people go due to LOWER costs and will do it via house made NH3.  AOC has NO idea what she is selling.  Ignorance is not happiness, nor will it work.  She needs to either shut up or get educated by me.  Her "plan" is a joke.  Won't work.
@BrianQuinn36 @AOC @Marie4Congress There is a way to get to zero carbon, but not with what AOC is selling.  Read my tweets if you want to know the future of energy.  Yes, Carbon fuels are needed to bridge to NH3.  Step by step at LOWER costs than current technology and much better performance.  Roadable seaplane!
@jonz970 @my3monkees @raducom @BundyGP @sappermartin @ImabitcSumtimes @Briteeye777 @ChrisBragdon @Serremmy @briantopping66 @jemckinney76 @Tremac8 @mixxmann65 @marc_lori @allenjarzombek1 @JonnyBG05528336 @UhadMeAtCovfefe @peggie_horton @NvrHilaryClnton @JohnDoe49508744 Bernie is a selfish, greedy, hate filled little man who thinks only about himself.  He would be unemployed if government did not exist.
@JoanofAmerica @JanetTxBlessed Socialists are at heart greedy control freaks who cannot create things themselves, so they want government to take it from you so they can be rich.  Just another scam.  Most would be at low wage jobs, like Hitler would have been.
@JanetTxBlessed Yes, she ain't that bright...
And seaplanes are about FREEDOM.  This engine can get me to a very very cool seaplane that I can fly anywhere on 6 different fuels.  It also can make me independent of fuels and grids.  Stand alone houses...no grids.  Understand?  Freedom vs slavery.  Make your choice....
Notice that NOT ONE person who is a CO2 alarmist will comment on what I tweet.  Telling.  I have a solution to their CO2, yet not one will even engage me, or lift a finger to help.  Folks, CO2 is about money and power, not CO2.  Wake up.  My engine to me is about seaplanes....
A comment about @AOC  new deal nonsense.  There is 100% no need for what she is selling, and yes we can get to 100% carbon free in cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, houses, farm equipment, and more.  No need for government except to remove crazy regulations that stop NH3 and me.
@JannaWilkinso69 No, my engine in roadable seaplane will run on NH3, as well as 6 other fuels.  Sorry, flying will be given to all who can and the rest will be door to door taxi service, as it should be.  Airliners will be long distances and eventually be obsolete.  read tweets.  No deal needed.
@rem3276 @JannaWilkinso69 @tea0704 There is a way to get to zero carbon ASAP, but what she suggests will never get us there.  Read my tweets if you want to know...  NH3 is the future, and carbon fuels will get us there faster.  Why?  Chicken and egg.  My engine is key to getting us there.  cars, trucks, airplane.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam, there is a way to get to zero carbon.  My technology is it.  Your new deal is not wanted or needed and will SLOW the move to zero carbon.  see my tweets. Your have been given notice via this tweet.
@WatchnDaWorld My new engine will destroy their nonsense by removing the issue via NH3 and new engine.  No carbon tax will work.  It will actually SLOW move to zero carbon.  We will go to zero carbon because it will be cheaper, not by force.  My technology is key.
@LazyMeatball She needs to go.  She is totally corrupt.  Trump must be using her for some reason....
@townhallcom There is a way to get to zero carbon, but not via the New  Deal crazy stuff.  No buildings need to be upgraded.  My technology will be CHEAPER and NH3 will become the fuel because it costs LESS than oil fuels.  See tweets.  There are steps to zero carbon.  BTW, I LOVE CO2...
@Doodisgirl No need, We can unplug their agenda.  How?  My technology.  Read tweets if you want to get grid free.
@Harrytheshadow Folks, I LOVE CO2.  Would triple it if I could. 	That said, there is a way to get to zero carbon, but not via government nonsense. No buildings need to be upgraded.  My technology will  be CHEAPER and NH3 will become the fuel because it costs LESS than oil  fuels.  See tweets.
@RyanMaue Folks, I LOVE CO2.  Would triple it if I could.	That said, there is a way to get to zero carbon, but not via the New Deal crazy stuff.  No buildings need to be upgraded.  My technology will be CHEAPER and NH3 will become the fuel because it costs LESS than oil fuels.  See tweets.
@zerodoubtzone Folks, I LOOOOVE CO2.  Would triple it if I could.	That said, there is a way to get to zero carbon, but not via the New Deal nonsense.  No buildings need to be upgraded.  My technology will be CHEAPER and NH3 will become the fuel because it costs LESS than oil fuels.  See tweets.
@ChuckCallesto Folks, I LOOOOVE CO2.  Would triple it if I could...	That said, there is a way to get to zero carbon, but not via the New Deal garbage.  No buildings need to be upgraded.  My technology will be CHEAPER and NH3 will become the fuel because it costs LESS than oil fuels.  See tweets
@LesProctor @realDonaldTrump Notice the wall being built....
@marlene676 @ClimateDepot There is a way to get to zero carbon...and I LOVE CO2.  Engine+ solar thermal + NH3 maker = zero carbon.  My engine (or similar) is key.  NH3 will be the fuel in 20-40 years due to LOWER costs, not force.  Must be able to use carbon fuels to solve chicken and egg.  see tweets.
@RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump The best part was about no socialism...
@AFResearchLab My engine systems is what is needed, not more worthless R&amp;D on stuff that is not needed.  You guys need to get a clue.  Just stop wasting money on junk that won't work, OK?  Trillions and zero to show for it.
@wunderbar2gethr Why don't you Germans fix your country, and then we mal Sprechen, gel.
@RealJamesWoods Want to unplug this?  It starts by unplugging you from their "grids" of control.  When you don't need an electrical grid, water grid, sewer grid, gas grid, and road grid, then you set yourself free.  My technology can do just that...in all cases...including roads...see tweets.
@Truthseeker126 All of this will COST LESS and SAVE about $1 trillion/year.  All can be 100% private funded and NO need for any government help except to deal with nonsense regulations....  Folks, this is real.  I love CO2.  It is NOT any threat. When NH3 is cheaper, then people will switch.
@Truthseeker126 Engine can run in cars, trucks, airplanes (where this engine started), boats, houses, factories, commercial, and ships of all types.  No need for anything AOC suggests, but we can salvage the wind and PV to make NH3 and let go to scrap when they fail life cycle....&gt;
@Truthseeker126 A roadable seaplane that will run on 6 fuels and NH3 (zero carbon).  The NH3 can be made for $0.75-1.3/gallon equiv to gasoline.  (see tweets).   There are steps to get to zero carbon....  I spell it out.  There is zero need to upgrade buildings except with my technology....&gt;
@Truthseeker126 There IS a way to get 100% zero carbon, and I LOVE CO2...triple it!  That said, my engine systems can get us all to zero carbon over about 15-20 years. Read my tweets.... Nothing AOC suggest will even make a dent.  And yes, you will have a roadable seaplane in your garage....&gt;
@Jali_Cat @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor If government officials can't balance the budget, the difference starts with their estates and then the people who voted for them.  Just that simple.  If they want to spend it and can't collect it, then they pay for it.  Simple concept.
@RonnieStewart17 Reject Dems and Rinos...both.
@AOC I have the solution to get us 100% carbon free.  Read my tweets and stop threatening people with your lack of basic understanding.  OK?  You can't force people to buy junk, especially when my technology will actually work.		There is NO need to "upgrade" any houses at all !!!
@BreitbartNews Best of all, people need ZERO government involved except to clear out regulations that are clearly stopping it.  See tweets.  People "upgrade" to SAVE money, not to cost more.  USA will have ~ 20% more money in pocket with the savings from fuels.
@BreitbartNews Carbon fuels are needed and used in engine until enough market exists and costs of NH3 are lower than gasoline/Diesel per energy.  Engine must run on gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, Propane, and Natural Gas until NH3 can be introduced to market.  People can make NH3 at home....&gt;
@BreitbartNews The engine in cars, trucks, boat, airplanes and campers, track hoes, farm equipment...any place an Otto/Diesel engine now runs.  That engine gets 3-5 in cars, 2-3 in truck and 10 x in track hoes.  ALL fuel can be NH3.  Wind/PV/solar thermal also make NH3.  100% carbon GONE.
@BreitbartNews Five things are needed to get to zero carbon.  No building upgrade needed.	1) my engine (see tweets)	2) solar thermal panels (new type)	3) thermal storage (water tanks basically)	3) NH3 maker (one exist now)	5) storage tanks (propane tanks)		Replaces you heating/cooling system..&gt;
@BreitbartNews Housing upgrades are not needed with my engine.  Can someone get this woman to read my tweets?  I have her solution to energy that will actually cost less....  She needs some education, big time....
I noticed in all the presentations on NH3 that most assume NH3 can be burned in old IC engines.  NOT true.  The costs to get past all the regulations cannot be afforded in old cars.  Just forget it.  Can't be more costs.  Has to be LESS costs, and old retros won't be viable.
Without a large potential market that is available via lots of my engines in cars all ready to use NH3 without modifications or adding tanks, NH3 is going NOWHERE folks.  The regulations will kill is dead so fast.  Again, there has to be MASSIVE advantages my engine can provide.
Some more issue on presentation....	Having NH3 has safety issues and perceptions.  It is new and will have a lot of resistance without the many benefits my engine has.  Using old engines is just not going to work due to the negatives NH3 gives to customer.  Hassle factor...
This engine will allow car layouts and designs that are not possible with old Otto/Diesel engines, nor with electric cars.  		The list is long of the "forces" that will drive a person to this new engine technology.  It will not just be a boring thing like zero carbon.....&gt;
Lots of new values via engine:		Lower maintenance, 	Redundant system (no towing car?)	Lots of fuel options	Thermal control while parking	water harvest (if wanted)	towing large trailers with power dolly	1000 hp in small car if wanted	all wheel drive if wanted	1 million miles.....&gt;
Having MORE range with NH3 would be important, but not critical due to the ability to use gasoline if needed.   		Other costs, as the presentation on economic forces stated (page 5), will have to be better, which they are.  Lots and lots of value via new engine....&gt;
With old engine and 40 more gallons of fuel at 5.1/gal NH3 plus tanks, say 100 lbs, you are looking at 300 lbs more weight to regain the range of old car.  With new engine at 3-5, average 4 x efficiency, the weight of fuel could be 3/4 of old, or 5 gallons, for a 25 lbs saving.
The weight issue is a small factor (compared to electric batteries) but still there.  NH3 is 3194 wh/L x 3.78L/gal = 12073/gal.  High heat.  36000/12073 =2.98  33700/36000=.93  kg/5.1666 x 2.2 lbs/kg x 36000 kwh/gal e =15.33/gal/2.98 5.1/gal NH3 x 40 gal =204 lbs, plus tanks.
If gasoline tanks are 18-20 gallon now for 400-500 mile range (Buick), going to NH3 will cut range down to 1/3 old range, or require 3 x more fuel.  NO room for 36-40 gallons more in fuel.  Without new engine at 3-5x better use of energy, it won't work due to volume issue.
Introducing a new fuel to commerce - not so easy.... presentation... 		Economic forces of NH3.  		Won't happen without new engine and the 4x increase in miles/energy.  Takes 3 x in gallons for same energy, but engine gets 3-5x better energy use.  4/3 range per tank from NH3.
The reportable quantity of NH3 is 100 lbs.  How many gal e?		5.166 kwh/kg x kg/2.2lb x 100 lb x gal e/33.7 = 6.98 gal e to gasoline  ...  3:1 = 20.9 gallon volume or about what a car fuel tank is for a car now.		100 mpg = 698 mile range.  		Car tank size ok.  Not reportable.
Going to NH3 will be a massive hassle or nearly impossible without an engine that can use it.  Chicken and egg.  Fuels are highly regulated, folks....  Engine MUST be able to use old fuels until NH3 is available.  Just that simple.		https://t.co/hz93m0SOZ8
This shows what NH3 market was like in 2012.  When NH3 made by wind/solar comes on line it will totally change the numbers.  None of these costs will be right when uncoupled from  Natural Gas.    https://t.co/CvrvAcwahW …
Imagine if you could buy or make a fuel for 30 cent/gal that was 1/3 the energy/volume of gasoline that could:		1) be a fuel for house, car, airplane and camper	2) be a fertilizer	3) be a refrigerant for cooling	4) be a cleaner and antifreeze when mixed with water		Gasoline?  NOT
Once there are enough cars that run on all 5 fuels, and enough demand for permits for NH3, then they will look at it, and not before.  Too many vested interests and alternatives.
If you think the government will approve something before it is enables, good luck with that.  I asked my State head attorney to approve me landing on a road.  No, but they will give permit.  That is how it will run.  Get engine, run on 5 fuels, and get permit to use NH3....
The article on Obstacles to NH3 is all solved by my engine.  Multi-fuel with tanks ready for propane or NH3.  Simple.  No government support.  Few test show it works.
What’s Stopping Us? Recognizing and Removing Obstacles to the Launch of Ammonia Fuel.  Interesting points.  Can't do NH3 until MY ENGINE is ready.  Old won't do.  Nothing new either.  Must do multi-fuel...  Wake up folks...NH3 needs my engine!		https://t.co/9VYqJwvXEv
Low flame temperature too.  Low flame speed.  40 for CH4 and 14 for NH3.  40/14=2.85.  		Ah, localized rich combustion seems to minimize NOx.  NH3 slip may be the compromise...but not with my engine...
Notice the fuel to air ratio on page 3.	Methane 0.058	JP-4 0.068	Ethanol 0.111	NH3 0.164		2.82 times more for NH3 over Methane.  		https://t.co/gWssxRjGVv
The need for NH3 is being demonstrated to me daily...clouds so bad I can't go skiing (white out).  Solar would not work well if at all.  Winter in the north needs to be able to store at least 3 months of fuel.  Good luck with batteries...joke.
NH3, as stated on Page 52 of favorite fuel article, can be:		1) fertilizer	2) locally produced	3) refrigerant	4) long term energy store for renewables	5) shipped easily		On fuel that can due it all....with my engine!		Want to be independent?  Then you want my engine + NH3 maker.
Note on page 50,  "Hydrogen and EV's have their own significant (insurmountable) set of problems."  YES, both H2 and EV won't work, like I have been saying.  My engine + solar + NH3, with the 5 fuel options, will work.
Notice on page 26 that they claim a &gt;50% IC engine efficiency potential.  This is due to the 50:1 compression ration possible...NOx is issue though.  Page 108, melting point of -108F...won't be doing that cold in seaplane...LOL.
Notice on page 22 over the favorite fuel slides that historical cost of NH3 and NG diverge in 2009.  Demand is strong for NH3.  Historically it tracked price of NG.  Need to make more of it!
Notice on page 21 with Nat Gas at $4/ MMbtu, the cost /gal e is around $1.4.  With capital costs added still below gasoline....		https://t.co/9Tce7OhqBu
Another slide show of the benefits of NH3.  Some repeats, but...some new stuff...each detail makes a difference in solving puzzle of how to make NH3 run with all other fuels.  		https://t.co/9Tce7OhqBu
To make NH3 work you need:		1) 3-5 times more range / energy due to the 1/3 energy/volume of NH3  and the need for round tanks that take space.  My engine solves this.  	2) You need to use many other fuels, not just NH3, especially at start.  		Engine comes FIRST, then NH3.
Another attempt that does not help.  Chicken and egg.  Must be able to use other fuels too, not just NH3.  But they can't make it work.  Why? (I know...) Discuss?		https://t.co/iox4le9zGD
Here is an example of people not wanting to face reality.  Notice that the engine is limited to 2800 rpm.  Why?  Flame speed.  It also has to use two fuels.  Range is only 111 miles...joke.  My engine (or similar) is needed to make NH3 a reality...		https://t.co/KboaPxneuZ
Read my comment on this video.  Why do people do this.  They destroy their credibility when the data does not back them up.  NH3 will be the future IF AND ONLY IF it is cheaper.  Best possible fuel to be cheaper...  Crazy stuff.		https://t.co/LR7evDzT0o
Clearly, the military is killing a LOT of our soldiers that don't need to be anywhere near the ground.  My engine in roadable seaplane is what they need in various sizes.  Page 32 does not need to happen.  Amazing waste.  Will they listen?  Fat chance....		https://t.co/KMQ1WoBWuI
Wrap up note.  NH3 future of fuel.  		https://t.co/qdmxqayygT
An attempt at making NH3 makers.  Government funded.....		https://t.co/dxTdqGfmWm
Nice point on page 9 and 10.  Battery 1000 times more cost/storage.  No Nat Gas line needed with NH3.  Stand alone apps.  Also, note start up time of 3 minutes for genset.  My engine...zero...runs with spin reserve, from zero power 1 second or less. 		https://t.co/MlrSTLXNkK
Another summary of NH3.  I am liking NH3 for the independence in energy.  No more blackouts and risk of house freezing during winter.  NH3 as fuel for electricity, cool/heat, and fertilizer.  Three main things people need, plus water harvest via engine.	https://t.co/V36AlcRl3P

@AMike4761 Yes, it is a scam to force people to buy products that are much too expensive, just like national health care is a scam to force people to buy junk "care" they don't want.  Always a scam going on.  Government is now the largest scammer....
@AMike4761 My engine + solar thermal on house + NH3 maker + storage tank could make fuel/energy for 100% carbon free for house, car, and airplane.  Doable.  It can also use gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, propane and NG.  Use NH3 when cheapest!  Problem solved.
Note on page 33 that the theoretical efficiency of NH3 making is 95%...  Also on page 36 the cost of storage with NH3 lowest. 		https://t.co/WgMeS5VoZw
The loss factors of 1.1 is best case.  1.35-1.55 is claimed by others.  1.1-1.55 with 1.5 c/kwh maintenance costs on engine (assume) would give NH3 at 55.6-78.4 c/gal e.  Electric car. 100 mpge, 12 c/kwh x2 vs 200 mpg at 55 c/gal e.  	200/100 x 24/(1.5x1.55) = 20.6:1
@PrisonPlanet Socialism is the creed of greed and envy, promoted by people who can't create for themselves to steal what other have.
If transmission is 1 cent/kwh and power delivered at AZ solar plant is 2.5 c/kwh, that means the real value of the electricity is 1.5 c/kwh (2.5-1=1.5).  At 1.5 c/kwh, NH3 could be made for: 0.015 x 1.1 x 33.7 = 55.6 c/kwh, which is ~ industrial Nat G is at $4/MBTU.  Understand?
The problem of storage is not only the losses, but the transmission.  The spread has to be large to make money, and with my engine, there is NO need for these devices, especially without a smart grid that can turn off demand.  NO SMART grid is needed!  Don't waste the money!
Look at all the technologies for storage.  Why?  Because the time response of the main suppliers is much too slow.  Even a Diesel takes a  few seconds to minutes to power up.  My engine?  Instant.  Spin reserve included!  No drop of 1/2 sine. How? Discuss?	https://t.co/VMAxJAjWXp
Is "storage" actually an unneeded element to the grid?  With my engine it is.  Waste of time and money.  All you need is engine + solar thermal + NH3 maker and NH3 tanks.  Batteries cannot be refilled externally.  https://t.co/TJfSaH5wcU
@RandPaul And to disclose who did the 911 nonsense.  Without admitting the deep state connections, it will not end.  FULL DISCLOSURE!  Stop hiding the truth!
There are lots of ways to make this all computer controlled any variable, but that is not what I want.  Looking for much simpler way to make all fuels work from high to low power, cold to hot starts.  Hmmmm.  My gut says there is a very simple solution....key to success...simple.
How then to make this all simple for gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, propane, Nat Gas and NH3?  Can leave Nat Gas out if need be for mobile apps due to tank weight.  Has to be able to mix all fuels together too.  Key criteria that will work for all.  My engine has it, but simple
These graphs are saying that Isothermal expansion in the range of 1600 is ideal....my guess.  This is why nobody uses NH3 in vehicles with old crank.  Difficult to make work.  Note that compression ratio is 35:1 in tests.  Flame speed key too, hence H2 doping of 10% usually best.
Ah, this graph on page 5 is a key to NH3 combustion.  Notice the slope of the ignition curve for NH3 (bowl shaped) vs N-hetane.  Notice that NH3 is 1300K vs 900k for N-heptane.  Very hot to combust or large delays.  More fuel = NH3 delay. https://t.co/9jFIJAjXGU

Here is a good overview of NH3.  "NH3 the optimal alternative fuel."  I am liking NH3 more and more as I read this.  Folks, this is doable at less than today's price of gasoline.  Make fuel from house!  Use in airplane too....		https://t.co/hfi4fqLKHI
more combustion in IC stuff.  Notice that more NH3 delays auto ignition...cooling.		https://t.co/eyR2YXEYU0
This compares fuels.  Notice that electricifacation of cars will slow path to zero carbon.  Engine + Nh3 and there.  		https://t.co/su0Bju3ubO
Another nice presentation.  		https://t.co/00M5V0xzdP
This was the slide show on the video I tweeted several days ago.  NH3 can be cheaper than fossil fuel, but is no where near that now.  My engine and solar will be key.  		https://t.co/GNtHXCwvHA
@KimMarieCoxCoo1 There is NO where near enough gold in the world.  About 200,000 tons.  At the production cost it is around $1 trillion.  World economy is $100 trillion.  NOT going to work unless fractional....fraud.  Gold won't work.  Same with silver.
@KimMarieCoxCoo1 When you take out a loan, you rob from everybody by increasing the money supply and therefore the value.  Who should get the interest?  We the people, not bankers.  That interest should offsets gov costs.  Interest is how they rob via made up money.  Must stop fractional banking.
@KimMarieCoxCoo1 Yes, I agree.  I am just saying that gold and silver is what the cabal controls.  The problem is in the fractionalization of money by a private cartel.  That right is the right to literally own the world.  Nobody has that right.  Interest should pay taxes, not bankers.
From some of the articles it appears that 2.5 cents/kwh is where NH3 would be made.  I think 2 cent/kwh is the long term cost of solar thermal farms, which are now 2.5, such as AZ solar project.  At 2 c/kwh and 10% loss to NH3, that makes 75 cents/gal e for NH3 or 25 c/gal NH3.
The question they ask is "can power-ammonia-to-power become economically competitive?" .....		Ans:  With my engine, solar thermal, and system...YES!!!  With wind, PV panels?  NO.  		There is a way to zero carbon (not my goal, btw) and it includes carbon to solve the chicken + egg
Page 5 "Electrification is an important tool, but it would solve &lt; half of the global transportation decarb challenge."  		My engine would solve 100%!!!		No electrification needed or wanted!  Wale up folks...  Electric cars SLOW path to zero Carbon!		https://t.co/pamabyx8b7
@KimMarieCoxCoo1 @KarenHudes 3/4th of the gold of the world is Vatican controlled.  Go to gold, you go to Vatican control...  Sure you want that?  I don't.  No need for gold or silver.
@harrysmallwood1 Originally, Diesel (inventor of Diesel engine) wanted to make a constant temperature device to limit burn problems.  He settled for constant pressure, and all the emissions we have not.  NH3 brings out this problem of NOx even more due to the abundance of N in the process.
@harrysmallwood1 No, NH3 can treat the exhaust of itself and give N2 and no NOx.  I want to avoid such non power use of the fuel, however.  I believe there is a way to make no NOx, which it is difficult with old engine tech and they need treatment.  The key is Isothermal combustion... great Q
@HenryK_B_ To zero out carbon you need new engine that can run major carbon fuels and NH3, and solar thermal.  Put on houses, make NH3 with excess, run in car and house.  zero carbon.  It is possible, but not with the current technology and strategy.  BTW, more carbon is better!
@LadyRedWave I would guess over 90% are evil....
"Studies show that ammonia can be blended with hydrogen at levels as low as 5% H2[202], still providing good power response. Higher doping ratios have also been deployed [203], showing, for example, that 10% hydrogen addition provided optimum efficiency and effective power"
Korean Institute for Energy Research (KIER), converted existing vehicle fleets into 70% NH3-30% gasoline vehicles.  Other systems use 20% gasoline or Diesel.  Bi-fuel seems to be the way to use NH3, which defeats the reason for me...independence.  New engine should be OK.
Basically, you need another fuel to get NH3 to burn due to the high temperatures of ignition.  50:1 is what I read, but not sure yet.  All use some Diesel or gasoline at low concentrations to get the burn going.  This makes zero carbon not enabled with old engines.  20% ?
"Although the tests at 30:1 compression ratio using the spark ignition engine  were unsuccessful, the results using ammonia vapour and diesel (for  ignition purposes) generated optimism for the success of using ammonia  as fuel in IC engines."  I hear 50:1 compression needed....
Below is a quote from the below reference about old engines using NH3 which is hard to burn.  see 	3.4. Combustion based technologies	3.4.1. Reciprocating engines  		So, old engine need modes for NH3 that make them unable to use other fuels....		https://t.co/PfcQlSovIh
Old engines need increased spark energy, compression ratio, supercharging the engine and adding hydrogen into the fuel through dissociation of NH3.  These developments showed that ammonia needed to be vaporised with at least 4–5% (by weight) H2 for good performance.  see 3.4.1.
@damnclown I am working at the computer.  Responding is part of finding the right people.  People can learn from both valid and invalid inquiries.  Why don't you try to make some valid comments and stop wasting our collective time.  OK?
https://t.co/8Gezs0eGbG
@damnclown Not secret to team members, just like any sane company.  Wake up.  No, not Trump.  Get a life.
Auto ignition temperatures in Kelvin.  		Diesel = 483 K	gasoline = 520-553 K	H2 = 809 K	CH4 = 859 K	NH3 = 930 K		Notice almost twice as hot as Diesel.
@damnclown Is 16 times less cost, 20 times range, much lower weight somehow nonsense?  Electrics can't get the range due to the battery....nonsense.  They can't due active drag reductions making them up to 2x more fuel in airplane.  My fuel $1/gal.  Electricity and battery $8-12/gal.
Auto ignition temp for NH3 = 930 K  Stoichiometric Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) of 6.06 by weight.  Solvent.  5.22 kwh/kg (LHV), not 5.166 I was using.  33.7 x 2.2/5.22 =14.2 lbs/gal e.  14.2/6.3=2.25 NH3/gasoline weight ratio, not 2.28 below.	How it stacks up.	https://t.co/0r4uJLHhCE
Compare storage.  Notice that NH3 is weeks, Thermal is days.  Li-ion is not even days....  To get through long winters (month) NH3 is need if independent from grid or other sources.  Simple tank can do it, just like Propane can.  		https://t.co/o2BHiyLuE5 …
Lots of R&amp;D into NH3 from different sources.    Four barriers to NH3.		https://t.co/PfcQlSovIh …
The future will have a lot of negative power prices, which is where we will get the NH3 from the grid.  House NH3 will be main source via engine, and stations via grid NH3.
Notice on page 5 "need for additional grid flexibility" where 6% PV is ok for nuclear, but at 10% it does not work, leading to paying to get rid of power or stand down during day.  Here is where NH3 will be the solution.		https://t.co/FJqc2Zpk3p
More evidence that NH3 can potentially be made for less than gasoline.  Notice on page two wind is 2 cent/kwh.  $0.02 x 1.55 x 33.7 = $1.04/gal equiv to gasoline.  at 1.35 factor = 0.02 x 1.35 x 33.7 = $0.91/gal e.  If Stanford can get to 1.1 factor =0.74		https://t.co/FJqc2Zpk3p
@insideclimate @neelaeast If that is the "intelligence" of the US, then we are doomed.  CO2 is NOT an issue at all.  Has nothing to do with any "climate" or weather changing in any way.  All these people need to find a job in reality and stop ripping off tax payers.  BTW, my engine solves CO2 issue...
@damnclown I don't have patents so I can't show details.  Tough to get people to think and not just respond to nonsense junk like you suggest.  Pretty pictures of nonsense is still nonsense....
@damnclown Behind?  No, I have not wasted time with such a craft/toy.  Not even close to viable....		Do you know why?  Can you see the many flaws in their system?   		If not, invest in it.  Put your money where your mouth is....  Enjoy your total loss of capital.
@JonesAuthor Not sure what you mean here with your comment....  explain...
According to this video, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is the leader in NH3 from electricity.  They say it is 10 years out.  Their focus is fertilizer, but fuel is the key.  My engine can use 5 fuels until NH3 can be made in volume.		https://t.co/oaAFWsIv41
@STACEYDUBOIS4 This would never happen with my technology...
@1980reagan Yes, no pension for any....
@ACCIONA_EN My engine can get us to zero carbon ASAP.  Install in car and cut fuel by 75%.  Then make NH3 from solar thermal electricity from house...100% no oil.  No more oil needed.  Just a friendly notice....
@damnclown In fact, the grid now is 454 g CO2/kwh.    That includes nuclear, dams, geo, wind, PV and solar thermal.  NH3 via CH4 is 416.  NH3 is the key to going more renewable to bridge times when not renewables are not available.  People in the "know" realize this.
@damnclown If I could go to NH3 directly I would if it was LESS money, as would most people.  By going electric you prolong use of carbon because current technology is very heavy, expensive and not able to get to zero carbon for a long long time.  Instantly via the engine, cut 75% fuel.
@PureMichGirl My new engine can get par to electrics and use any of 6 fuels AND NH3 which is zero carbon.  The fastest way to zero carbon is COMBUSTION via my engine.  NH3 is the means to store excess renewable energy when the wind blows too much.  The "green new deal" can't work.  Discuss?

@nickraaum Thanks for the questions.
@nickraaum OK  Great.  		Combined cycles are 45% for the core turbine and 15% for the secondary cycle, total 60%.  Newer turbines (like on 787 jets) are 55% with ~15% second or around 62-70%.  Large Diesels are 55%.  World record Otto is 60% using gasoline + spark and Diesel mist.
@RichardTBurnett The central problem with Islam is the notion of "Infidel."  We find this also in "heretic" from Catholics and "Goyim" from Talmud.   Combined with State power, it leads to mass murder.  Inquisition.  100 million Christians by the Bolsheviks (mostly Jewish).
@nickraaum I can appreciate the interest, but my purpose here is to find qualified help to do the engineering work...lots to do.  I don't have patents and I am already saying way to much to spark interest.  I disclose more and more as contracts are signed, not before.  Sure you understand.
@nickraaum Do you have Mechanical Engineering background?  Study the cycles.  Make device that can be close to 60-75%.  I hear the best grid machines are up to 80% now.  Key is to make power at 1 kw and not 10 megawatts.  Small is hard.  Large is doable already.  Turbines = large.
@nickraaum They can.  Already have.  Last month was the FIRST run, from what I read.  Yes, first time solar-NH3-turbine test.  Grid will use NH3 made from excess grid power.  That is the obvious solution with renewables. My engine can work with grid, but existing engines can't well.
@nickraaum An Otto cycle is considered a constant heat addition cycle.  HCCI is the best case of this.  All the heat is done at TDC.  In Diesel, fuel is added as the piston goes down keeping pressures constant.  NH3 needs an "constant temperature" expansion to remain 700-1500K in burn.
@nickraaum I am suggesting that thermodynamics is a path function.  How you get there makes a massive difference.  My engine attempts to run the path to gather the most and allow different fuels and solar thermal injection (hot water).  The device is key to path(s).  Lots of cycles....

All there for anybody to see.
@nickraaum The problem is high temperatures that make NH3 come out NOx, which is a  no-no.  The temperatures must be dropped and the ratios increased.  My  engine does both.  Brayton is NOT ideal as a constant Pres heat  add.   Constant vol heat add ideal,. at less than 1500K always.
@damnclown If you want to get to zero carbon ASAP (20-30 years faster) you will need to use combustion to bridge from existing to NH3.
@nickraaum My compression ratios/expansion ratios can be whatever I want them to be up to around 81:1.  Natural gas is 3.8:1 volume ratio to gasoline at 3600 PSI.  NH3 = 3.:1.  Close.  The advantage is a tank at 150 psi vs 3600 psi, a 24:1 ratio.  Tanks in car floor like Tesla does w bat.

Either way, win-win.
So, NH3 has a 3:1 volume and 2.28:1 weight disadvantage to gasoline.  Basically you have 1/3 the range with the a little less 76% of the weight of a full tank of gasoline (2.28/3=.76).  A 2400 mile ranges becomes a 800 mile range https://t.co/G35v4wVZtr

Health care, grid, and climate change all are about ripping people off.  Hide the costs in the system, and charge 2-5 times more than needed.
@nickraaum The advantages of electricity via buildings is the same for NH3, whereas not so with gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL or other fuels.  Propane is the only carbon fuel that would be building local, which this engine could use.  Time to fill is a few minutes, whereas electric...hrs.
@nickraaum NH3 would be ideal for shorter range air taxi service below 500-800 miles.  Quick fills.  zero carbon.  Low cost fuel.  NO battery cycle costs ($4/gal e for battery).  Great crash/fire safety (hard to burn).  Cheap ($0.75 to $1.3/gal e).  Locally (building) made fuel.....&gt;
@nickraaum NH3/Li-ion ratios:	Vol: 29/3=9.66  	Weight : 63/2.28=27.6		NH3 still has volume advantage of nearly 10:1 over LI-ion, and a weight advantage of nearly 28 times.  No exact, but close enough to see that NH3 is viable for airplanes, but LI-ion is not.  Perfect for air taxi flying.
@nickraaum A Li-ion battery by comparison takes 29 gallons volume/gal e to gasoline, and is abour 400-525 lbs depending on structure needed to make safe.  400/6.3=63.5: Add in fuel tank, say +2 lbs/gal for tank plus fuel =8.3 lbs/gal.  525/8.3=63.  29 vol; 63 weight disadvantage to Li-ion.
@nickraaum NH3 is 5.166 kwh/kg = 14.35 lbs/gal e to gasoline.  Gasoline is 6.3 lbs/gal.  2.28 times more weight than gasoline per energy.  3:1 more volume/energy too.  So, there is a weight and volume disadvantage to NH3 over gasoline, plus a pressure tank like Propane is needed.
@damnclown Nope, not even close.  The key to low CO2 IS combustion.  read the tweets.
@nickraaum Yes, we need NH3 for Fertilizer, and CO2 for greenhouse.  The engine can use both types of fuels to allow no grid living.  No water, sewer, fuel (gas) or electricity.  Cooling while parked without cost of fuel...  Electrics can't do all this without lots of extra equipement.
@nickraaum Yes, that is my goal, along with fueling a really cool 400 mph seaplane that I can go anywhere in and camp.  Make the "system" small, light weight so I can land on Island and have water, heat/cooling, and light for as long as I want to stay there...rent free.
@AStrongerOZ @Minister_Harwin My new engine technology can get us to zero carbon, yet it can use carbon fuels (6), via NH3.  I can see $1.3/gal e for fuel.

Read my tweets.  NH3 is the key.  Make NH3 during year and during hard times of winter use NH3 like any carbon fuel to bridge.... all doable.  I explain how.  Note, my engine can use carbon fuels too...

My engine will be able to burn all fuels without the need of spark or added fuel mix to NH3 to get NH3 to burn.  This is key as if you have to use 10-20% gasoline to use 80-90% NH3 you can't get this to work well at home because you will need carbon fuels and not NH3 alone.
To make NH3 work, the ignition temps are higher than Diesel and it is hard to spark.  Gasoline is used to spark in Otto engine to get NH3 to burn and Diesel is used to get NH3 to burn in Diesel engine.  Both need added injection and alteration to make work.  Not simple....
How to use NH3?  3 Options		1) fuel cell: needs battery, inverter, costly, ONE fuel.	2) New engine: Pure sign wave, cheap, many fuels.	3) Old engine: Needs other fuels to use NH3.		Key is to be able to use many fuels.  Single fuel systems won't work due to chicken and egg problem
@Lady_Vi_2U Kamala in the Finnish language means:  Horrible (as in Whore-able), Terrible (as in terrorist), awful (as in full of it), ghastly (as in gas lighting), etc.  What is in a name?  Kamala is FINISHED.
@LuciusOpimius @RippleZoo The reason any of this "renewable energy" stuff even exists is because all the R&amp;D is stolen from tax money.  My R&amp;D is from MY spec of money, not a mountain full like they have.  Again, ALL of the cost would have to be recovered by product to be fair.  Not even close 1:1,000,000
@LuciusOpimius @RippleZoo Why?  I don't need them.  That is the point of this.  I for one am tired of nonsense from government thugs who rip us all off and make our lives more difficult and costly.  Nothing is free.  The cost of any product would have to recover that spent $21 trillion... Good luck!
If you store your PV panel power in NH3, how then to use it?  Fuel cell?  OK, but that requires a battery system, controller, inverters, etc.  Very complex.  Fuel cells don't do well in changing power situations and therefore need battery nonsense to make it all work.  Costly!
You could make NH3 from PV panels, but at what costs?  They cost at least 12 cent/kwh.  $0.12 x 1.55 x33.7= $6.2/gal e.  Not viable, but if the grid charges you $50 to hook up and does not want your power during the day, then making NH3 is an option.  How to then use NH3?  Engine
@realTylerZed @tedcruz @RepRooney NO WAY to any Amendments at this time.  Only an idiot would suggest such a thing.
@rob_omgwtf And that is what is important to me.  The engine can as a side note solve the CO2 issue if that is important.  NH3 will become the fuel because it will be cheaper than gasoline.  Easy.  My engine can run all fuels.  I doubt anything they have can at 1/10,000th the cost.
@rob_omgwtf Sure, lets give poor people in Africa a electromagnetic propulsion system and see what happens.  My guess it will be a water bucket.  If they have solutions, which they should, then where are they?  Hiding?  Breakaway civilization?  My engine can make my roadable seaplane....&gt;
@LuciusOpimius @RippleZoo No, the government should have the solution if it has spent $21 trillion in black programs.  Where is it? Hiding it?  Government is about ripping people off.  Not much else.  If you want zero CO2, my tech is the only low cost solution viable.
There will be two means to making NH3:		1) House:  Solar thermal - generator - NH3 via combustion/solar engine.  		 2) Excess grid power:  Make NH3 from renewable energy sources when excess power not needed.  Store and sell.
To solve the CO2 and the energy problem you have to solve the "chicken and egg" problem of NH3.  NH3 is the fuel of the future, NOT electricity.  Why?  We can't now store electricity easily over long periods of time at low costs.  Batteries are NOT the answer.  NH3 is.  But how?&gt;
When you buy into the CO2 haters club (Climate Change) you are told that oil and combustion are EVIL and Sinful.  Those who like combustion are also the enemy and evil too.		News flash!  Combustion IS the only solution to zero Carbon that won't  bankrupt us all.  Listen up.....&gt;
To get to zero carbon you need the following:		1) efficient engine (60%+) that can run on several fuels, NH3 and solar thermal, as well as generate electricity.	2) Distributed power system, like my engine.	3) solar thermal store and panels	4) NH3 maker and storage tanks.
I have the lowest cost solution to getting oil out and hence CO2 gone via NH3.  It can also run on Carbon fuels and give you 4x fuel economy increase on 6 fuels.  Either way you win-win.  You can be the most crazy CO2 hater, or lover, either way you win.  Not so with other tech.
@nickraaum Remember, the engine takes in air.  Air has water.  Depending on the power to water consumption ratio, a building could be zero water from external sources, or grid free in water.  Wastes can be distilled also via vacuum compression distillation.  The point being is synergies....
@nickraaum I want to run my house, cars, and seaplane all from my house solar via NH3.  When I fly around, and need fuel, I can get gasoline/Diesel from Station, and Jet A or 100LL from airport.  If I run short on NH3 (cloudy) then I can use propane as backup.  Bad winters happen....
@nickraaum Yes, local greenhouses.  Grow your own food at 3 times rate with 1200 PPM in well designed greenhouse.  Engine can do both carbon and NH3 to then control CO2 without wasting fuels as done now.
@nickraaum Yes, NH3 from house solar ONLY, not from CH4 via Haber Bosch...  The wind mills and PV panels will life cycle out over 25 years and we are left with house solar thermal via engine, which is all that is needed.  The wind will help bridge for now, but is not needed long term.
@nickraaum Remember that heat can make cooling....via cycles.  NH3 is a great refrigerant.
@nickraaum With NH3 AND bio carbon fuel, you then can CONTROL temperatures INDEPENDENT of the CO2 level in the greenhouse.  Cold outside?  Use more NH3.  Need more CO2?  Run lights from bio fuel.  You need BOTH, not just zero carbon to make crops work.
@nickraaum See, I take it you believe CO2 is an issue.  I know for a fact it is not.  But with this approach ....  IT DOES NOT MATTER....  All that matters is the end result...zero oil = zero carbon.  Agreed?
@JonesAuthor Not really.  That is like saying why didn't the Romans during 0 AD have cell phones...  It had to be invented.  I will say had Frank Whittle (jet engine inventor) been funded 8 years earlier, WWII would not have happened.  My engine can be as important to people.  Read tweets.
@LuciusOpimius @RippleZoo No, lots of discussions, but no real solutions.  Higher costs = more CO2.  Current stuff is high cost.  It is designed to make a few rich, not make us all better off.  CO2 is not a factor in temperature or weather.  Believe in AGW or not, this engine tech can cut CO2 and oil.
@nickraaum CO2 is NOT an issue.  More is better.  Believe what you want.  I clearly have tweeted how absurd the theory is.  That said, this technology can lead to zero oil.  THAT is my motive, not lower CO2, which follows with no oil.  Both sides of the debate can agree with this tech.
@nickraaum Nick, me too.  Read the tweets as I discover what is needed too.  These twitter are a log as I realize it....  		Key elements:		Engine that is 60-75% = par to electric	Solar thermal via engine.  Engine must be able to do 6 fuels AND solar thermal....None exists now.	NH3 maker.

@justinr10519174 25k is top of safe altitude.  40 k is ultimate max at 100% oxygen...unsafe.
@justinr10519174 Lancair flys 25k....mooney...lots do it...
@justinr10519174 Oxygen.  Engine maintains power somewhat like multi tubos but efficient.  My personal alt will be 12 k to avoid oxygen.  Engine makes oxygen via sub system btw.  Ok to fly SL too...just more drag.
@MLBinWA New engine with NH3 SOLVES your Climate Change problem.  No worry.  Quickest way to zero carbon is my engine technology.  Current wind and pv and electric cars cant solve problem.  Read tweets.
@justinr10519174 25 to 400 mph is design speed range.  25k feet no pressurization.  Ultra quiet mode.
@justinr10519174 Not a jet.  Distributed power. 8 motors. Not electric.  Use 5 fuels and NH3.  Airport jetA or 100LL; station gasoline, diesel; house propane.  NH3 future fuel....no carbon tax and $1.3/gal e possible.  Engine key to many new craft....
@justinr10519174 Concept.  The avitar pic was of an airplane called Sea-Era.  Low wing version flew.  This new one is many iterations beyond.  Roadable.  New engine.  Am engineer...master degree.
@justinr10519174 New engine should be 60-75% vs turbine (P&amp;W 6A, for example) is 21%.  Use $2/gal fuel vs $4/gal Jet A, at ~ 3:1 fuel burn.... 3x2=6 times less fuel, add in boundary layer for 1/2 drag...up to 12:1 less fuel per power.
@justinr10519174 No, new engine that allows me to embed the engine IN THE WING in front of main spar, dropping a prop shaft with prop out front in "blown wing" somewhat like the x-57 but without all the mistakes.  CL = 10, not 2 for a Cessna on landing.  Power on lift....land 1/2 speed. 30 vs 60.
@justinr10519174 Yes, a 400 mph seaplane that can go anywhere in the world, which you can camp in, drive on the road and park in garage, with a 6000 FPM climb rate that lands at 30 mph, frontal crash of 4 feet, standing option (long flights), rough field, snow, and a nice tundra tire nose wheel.

@SavingAmerica4U Most abortions are done on black.  Yes, Planned Parent....hood....kkk.  What is in a name?
@Lucy2300090 @JunkScience The reason is to make money selling junk technology that won't work.  My  engine can run on 6 fuels AND NH3, which ever is cheaper.  My reason for NH3 is because it could be made for $1.3/gal equiv of gasoline, which makes me independent from idiots who want to jerk me around.
Below I explain to you why the "Green New Deal" will fail and cost us all $49 trillion and why.  Simple to understand.		The world is on notice!  		NO carbon tax or "Green New Deal" is needed to get to zero carbon and why combustion is needed to get to zero carbon fast and low $.
The reason airplanes can go long distances is because they don't have to carry with them liquid Oxygen.  Think about it.  A battery has to carry BOTH elements and keep them close but separated.  In the event of a crash they can come in contact and short out... NOT good!
If you want to store energy, do it in a liquid form.  You separate the two driving elements of fuel + oxygen.  The fuel goes in a liquid tank that can change shape during a crash and the air does NOT need to be hauled around as liquid Oxygen,  Battery must carry BOTH elements...&gt;
What is a battery other than a store of chemical potential?  Why not store that potential in a liquid and transform it to electricity when needed?  Because they can't figure out how to do it...that is why.  Their cult of electricity has banned any research into engines....&gt;
When brain dead Pols say they want to ban combustion, they are saying they want to ban zero carbon and delay the switch to zero carbon for 30-40 years if not longer.  Why?  Many fuels.  The Pols think that electricity will be the "fuel" of the future, while using batteries...&gt;
The reason we are NOT solving carbon is because of the bigotry, bias, ignorance, stupidity, arrogance, and hostility to COMBUSTION.  To get to NH3 you must use combustion, especially in the first 20-40 years.  Why?  Many fuels.  Just that simple.  One fuel cannot get us there.
You cannot use fuel cells because they use membranes or other means that are selective in nature and therefore sensitive to impurities and cannot use many fuels.  		COMBUSTION can be made INSENSITIVE to many fuel types.  Garbage in, energy out.  Does not matter the fuel type.
Here I will try to distill down the 800 lbs Gorilla in the room.  		In order to get to zero carbon you have to allow many carbon fuels, not just zero carbon fuels or electricity.  READ 1000 times.  This is what the "experts" and purists don't see.  They shun combustion...but key.
Then there are risks.  If NH3 does not come into use for say 10 years or more, what person would invest in engine technology that works with NH3 now?  NONE!  What if some other fuel is discovered?  What then?   Bankrupt!  		The ability to use many fuels is key to getting zero C.
With NH3, we have a classic chicken and egg problem.  We need engines that can run it and get same or better range, as well as fuel stations.  Without both, it will not happen.  My engine enables nh3 because it can use other fuels now, and we then switch later to NH3 slowly.
Until NH3 is common everywhere, low in price, and easy to handle, it will not work as a fuel for cars, trucks, boats, campers, houses, and more.  The same for electricity, but more so.  Storing electricity is the problem.  Storing NH3 is much less of a problem....&gt;
NH3 has a problem of not being used currently as a fuel and availability, as well as volume and pressure tanks requirements.  A plastic tank won't work.  If the engine system can also use 6 other fuels instead of only NH3, a common plastic tank could be used to fill up tank.
Running out of fuel in an electric car is very costly.  It requires a tow and could cause battery damage if the person pushes it too hard.  This problem is at the heart of the problem of batteries.  You can't fill them up externally due to the weight of battery technology.
The key to customer acceptance is availability of fuel to run the car.  If you run out of Electricity you can' just grab a 5 gallon tank a few miles away and put some electricity into it.  It takes a charging station, and time, all which can't happen on the side of a freeway.
Electricity and NH3 have the similar problem.  Both cause range anxiety.  Although electricity can be had at home, the charge time is limited by the grid house feed, making charging much too long.   Both are special "fuels" not used commonly.  Both have costs to implement.
Current engines are 4x less efficient compared to electric cars plug to  wheel.  My new engine will be par to electrics pump to wheel.  With this  new engine, NH3 can have more range (4/3) with same volume, whereas old  engines will have 3x LESS range, causing range anxiety.
@JunkScience Current engines are 4x less efficient compared to electric cars plug to wheel.  My new engine will be par to electrics pump to wheel.  With this new engine, NH3 can have more range (4/3) with same volume, whereas old engines will have 3x LESS range, causing range anxiety.
This women is clueless and what she proposes is exactly what is NOT needed.  She has no idea what she is talking about.  So stupid, arrogant, ignorant as to be shocking.  My engine solves CO2.  Yahoo...shame on you...		https://t.co/eu1DQ0WXMP
@JunkScience With AZ solar at 2.49 c/kwh, you can make NH3 for $1.3/gal equiv to gasoline.  NH3 is the best means to absorb excess wing/solar when grid cannot use it.  Once NH3 costs are below gasoline and needed engines enable it, then most people will use NH3.  NO Carbon tax needed!
@JunkScience My engine can get us to NO carbon faster WITH carbon fuels.  How?  By allowing people to save 70-80% up front using fossil fuels withnew engine, and then allow NH3 to become the main fuel over time side by side to 6 fuels.  When NH3 is cheaper, all people will use it.
@naenae61_grp @1979Sidm @usacsmret @SpeakerPelosi She is the ultimate in greed, graft and corruption.  She lusts after money and power.  Sick pig.
Anybody who proposes the "Green New Deal" is either a complete criminal, misinformed, or plain stupid.  There is 100% no need for any such nonsense.  My engine solves the CO2 problem and allows current systems to GET US THERE FASTER (!).  Any carbon tax SLOWS progress to zero C.
A person can only take around 33 G's to the chest before internal organs collapse on top of each other and death occurs.  Large accelerations (100 G's) found in crash pulses need to be limited to &lt;33 G's by some means, such as the belt or airbag.  Current tech can't do this well.
A "crash pulse" is an acceleration plot of the cabin during a crash.  As each part is stressed during a crash it imparts an accelerations that go up and down as each beam or part snaps.  The acceleration might go from 0 to 100 G's and back again to 50 many times.  NOT good!
One of the high costs of making a car is designing how the car crashes.  With my new car engine and crash technology (former airbag guy here), the cost is mostly eliminated and the crash "pulse" made to be a "square" and smooth pulse, not some 100 G jerking/breaking nonsense now.
The reason engines are in the front of the car is a belief that it gives more protection.  NOT so.  The front of the car is where the highest energy impacts are possible and requires at least 4 feet of "regulated" stroke, not a "crumple zone" with an engine in the middle....&gt;
With typical car engines in the front of a car, when it crashes, it usually destroys the engine.  This is why the engine should not be in the front, side, or rear, but protected, as the value of the car is in the engine.  Each section in car should be a zone that can be replaced.
If a crash only costs you 5-10% to repair, you can save the rest of car.  If the value of the engine as a power unit exceeds the original cost of car, when you crash such that all the panels are junk, you just use the engine in house or cabin.  You don't toss it in garbage pile.
My daughter crashed a car recently.  The engine is now junk, along with  the rest of the car.  With my new car concept, the engine is protected, and the car could have been repaired, and 80-90% of the value would remain.  100% loss with old Buick, and such a waste of resources.
There is no need to run a separate air conditioner cycle or furnace if well sized.  The use of water thermal store also lowers NH3 use to control thermal loads which is where 50% of all energy now goes.  Staying cool/warm in a car can use NO fuel when done right while parked.
About 1/2 the year a house either needs heating or cooling.  Since my engine is a thermal engine with unique characteristics, it can can provide heating and cooling as part of the cycle, thus allowing electrical power generation and a cooling action from "waste" effects of cycle.
In contrast, my technology is to make each person independent in energy, water, sanitation, and transit.  One engine system that runs house, factory, car, truck, airplane, boat and even a greenhouse.  It can use 6 fuels and make and use NH3 from solar thermal, all for a fraction.
In essence, the "Green New Deal" is a way to set up a "pay to play" scam  that makes Congress rich and the "technology" companies that sell their junk mega rich.  We all pay for it every month in our electrical bill.   Carbon does not go down much, and they all get Jet airplanes.
In essence, the "Green New Deal" is a way for bad technology companies to bribe Congress and Congress to pay them back by forcing us all to buy $49 trillion in JUNK that is not needed.  No need for a "Smart Grid" with my engine.  Simple is better.  No need for spying appliances.
@JpiersM @ewarren Jon, think of if as a public notice that carbon taxes will fail due to NH3, and they actually SLOW or low the incentives of adopting my engine technology which enables NH3.  The grid will NEED NH3 and machines that can use it, and so will mobile apps.  Getting my engine key.
@DeplorableChoir @RealJamesWoods Kamela in Finnish means HORRIBLE, Terrible, awful, etc.  Look it up on Google translate.  What is in a name.  Whore...able....   Terrible, as in terrorist...  What is in a name?  She is "finnished" for sure.
@wendydcoe @realDonaldTrump The only question is can we abort traitorous Congressman?  The Constitution says yes.
@ewarren You don't need to pass anything.  My engine that can run on NH3 and 6 carbon fuels can get you to zero carbon faster than anything know.  Read my tweets.  No need for smart grid or $49 trillion of junk.
@antischool_ftw I call for $50 trillion reparations from Liberal to conservatives....
@tomselliott @AOC My engine technology solves the non problem of CO2 with NH3 (no carbon) maker via solar and electricity from house.  Engine can also use 6 other fuel for those who think CO2 is a good thing, like me.
@tomselliott @AOC Mental case....
@tomselliott @AOC I just experienced insanity.  She is a lunatic.
@alpipkin @lunchmeat98 I doubt Bill can do a "free body diagram" like any Mechanical engineer can.
@Brought_to_You They do this because they don't have the needed innovations like my engine.  They are not creative and they think bigger will protect them.  Nope.  All three would go bankrupt if my engine were an option now.
Think of the grid like it were "national health care" with all the hidden costs you can't do anything about.  It costs over 5 times more than it should.  You are given what is offered at a very high price and costly mistakes are passed onto you without your say.  Understand?
When you go with electric cars you are locked into high costs and political nonsense of the grid due to the nature of the grid and who owns it.  The grid is the new slave camp, where you get the task of paying for their stupid choices.  Yeah!  We all all slaves now to the grid!
The main reason for doing NH3 is independence form cartels and governments.  This is becoming more apparent to me and is a major incite and criteria for long term success of the engine.  Gasoline prices can be $2/gal today, and $4/gal tomorrow, due to some political nonsense.
With the price of gasoline being so low, and even lower than Propane, you can't rely on one fuel type or source.  The engine has to be able to use the lowest cost fuels so that it is not beholden to some cartel that indirectly controls the value of the engine via the fuel costs.

@mo808_ I want to be able to fly my seaplane to Hawaii.  My engine designing started with me wanting to take my wife and I in the same airplane to Hawaii, but due to fuel loads needed for old airplane engines, I had to let her take the airliner...no fun.  Solved energy problem from this.
Can bio fuels be made in enough quantity to allow 1200 ppm greenhouse CO2, yet run everything from NH3?  Need to see how much CO2 it takes to run greenhouse.  This would encircle the AGW alarmists with a solution they cannot refute.  Greenhouses with no fossil fuels.
LOL.  Trump fixes glowball warming. https://t.co/nfRDDMMXKu
@smalltownandrew Can we just deport her?
NH3 is the cheapest fuel and is a zero carbon fuel.  Propane is the carbon fuel and costs around twice.  To operate a greenhouse at my house I can use a small portion of Propane to make CO2 in greenhouse at 1200 ppm. Bio fuel would also work. The rest of the house can use NH3.
My original motive to use Nat Gas was the low costs at ~ $1/gal.  If I can MAKE NH3 for the same costs and NH3 takes 3:1 vs 3.8 for NG relative to gasoline in volume, it does not pay to bother with NG.  Again, my motive is NOT CO2.  If I want CO2 for a greenhouse, I buy propane.
Natural Gas cannot be stored without 3600 psi tanks, which are outside of house codes of 700 psi.  Propane tanks are common now, and NH3 acts like propane in storage.  But Nat Gas in tank does not.  Compressing NG is also difficult and costs energy.  Lots to NOT like about NG.
By eliminating Natural Gas as a mobile option, my engine only needs LIQUID injectors, not gaseous fuel injectors.  This dramatically lowers costs and space to make engine work.  A Nat Gas unit can have an optional Nat Gas injector, but I am not sure I even want that due to NH3.
This little question and answer session with myself (nobody asks any questions on the key question of our time....funny how that is...) has shown me where I need to focus the design and what to get rid of.  I was BIG (HUGE) on Natural Gas for cost reasons, but now don't want it.
What happens when my costs are over 10 times LESS than grid based "renewable energy" offerings?  What happens to the grid when 80% of costs are the grid?  If the grid "goes away" like land lines have, who will pay for the "smart grid" that turned out to be very dumb?
With renewable electricity driving costs up, and my engine driving them down by a 10-14:1 ratio, there will be a many people willing to invest in house generation to save costs in house and cars.  When many people have it, some will just buy NH3 + power from neighbor to avoid.
When renewable electricity costs 30 cents/kwh ($10.11/gal e) in Germany/Hawaii and battery use costs 12, you have a "fuel" cost of 42 c/kwh ($14.15/gal e) to run an electric car.  With NH3 @ $1/gal via engine system in house, a large incentive to make power/fuel exist....&gt;
Any city needs a road to get around.  Any area might want to share electricity locally to allow many people to not have to own an engine if they don't want to.  Not everybody will want to be independent.  Some will to take advantage of cost savings.  Others don't want the hassle.
The fight against "poverty" was done in the past by connecting the grid to people. When power/transit/info can come to the people WITHOUT the grid or roads, the costs of the road is eliminated and costs go down by 80%.  This enables more poor people to get out of poverty....&gt;
The two main control means of the grid and roads become yesterday's news.  If you don't need a grid, where can you live?  If you don't need a road, where can you live?  Grids and road corral people into cities.  My engine frees them to live ANYWHERE.  Poverty can then be solved.
Again, why is our economy structured as it is?  Economies of scale.  But what if the costs of transport becomes 80% of costs as I show below?  You go LOCAL.  This allows all to have a JOB and LIVE even with AI.  Full circle where your house becomes a farm where you grown own food
This "local" use will also extend into food production, with greenhouses  to some extent.  Massive plantations with slave labor will not be  preferred due to GMO, e- coli, and freshness.  Needing to ship food long distances could be reduced or eliminated by engine + greenhouse..&gt;
The cost of "roads" goes from 20% to 80% with new engine.  By getting rid of the "road" or better yet, the "main highways" you can save a massive 80% of costs!  This is what people are not seeing...  The large main "roads" will NOT be needed.  Only "local traffic" will be...&gt;
cost of "roads"		Highway cost = 2 c/mile for cars.  Fuel cost at $2.3/gal and 23 mpg = 10 c/m.  Ratio = 2/10= 20%		Grid cost 1 c/kwh.  Industrial electricity 5 c/kwh.  1/5= 20%.  		Both "roads" cost ~ 20% of total now.		200 mpg @ $1/gal = 0.5 c/m.  0.5+2=2.5.  2/2.5 = 80%!
Grid is an electrical road for electricity.  Highways are a road for cars/trucks.  If the cost of the "road" is ~ equal to the power to use it, getting off the road becomes a large source of savings.   Both "roads" now are a small cost fraction (10-20%), but not with New Engine.
Open the cost link below.  Notice industrial electricity costs nationwide at 6.88 c/kwh.  Several States are BELOW 5 c/kwh.  The AZ contract at 2.49 is about 1/2 industrial rates.  This means the grid has value and costs = to power generated.  If you don't need grid, save money! https://t.co/oPTaXVg2GZ
It has been proposed to charge $50/month just to hook up to the grid with solar PV panels.  If you used $100/m before and $50 is the charge for grid, that tells you the power you give to grid is worth 1/2 the cost.  We see this in the AZ solar contract for 2.49 c/kwh....&gt;
There are several reasons to have a grid.  Once those reasons are gone, can the grid survive?  Can land lines survive when all is cellular?  At what costs.  The grid will face the same diminishing customer base/use as more people don't use power and are still required to hook up.
Why have a grid?  What will happen as more and more people/houses produce their own electricity and store it in NH3 and/or batteries?  They become "stand alone" houses where a grid is not wanted or needed.  The house then powers their cars too.  That is what my tech will do...&gt;
If the "green new deal" were implemented at $49 trillion, most would be made OBSOLETE by my engine!  Read that 1000 times!  The future of the grid, from where I stand, is the question that needs to be answered.  Why have a grid?  When the reasons for a grid are gone, why have..&gt;
The "smart grid" is where much of the high costs of renewable energy comes from.   The need to control things on the demands side make it so that each washing  machine, dryer, refrigerator and so on needs to have an external  control from the power company.  Not needed with NH3. https://t.co/2XvkIO1P9n
@mitchellvii Murder for hire....
@Acts17 Any religion or ideology that thinks it is OK to limit speak like Islam does is not valid.  They are showing weakness and the lack of truth in their dogma.  Islam, Catholicism and Talmud have long histories of being invalid to other groups by promoting violence to non believers.
@DrIbram @tombrokaw Group orientation is discriminatory to those outside the group and it at the core of racism.  You are a racist.  You want me to conform to YOUR values, which I cannot do because they are based in some cult of race unique to you.  If you don't like USA find someplace else.
@ChisToole @GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @tedcruz @RandPaul @GOPLeader @Jim_Jordan This new engine technology can be 21-64 times less cost for "fuel" compared to electric car....

Diesel engine was 3 times more efficient than steam engine.  Petrol was 12%.  He committed suicide some say.... Petal vs Diesel.  Nice video.  95% of cargo via Diesel.  My engine can replace Diesel engine, and allow NH3 in all craft, including airplanes.	https://t.co/Lpr3Z3VCRi
@RightWingLawMan She is NOT eligible.  Both parents MUST be citizens at the time of birth.  Both could not have been.  She is an anchor baby.  14th does not allow anchor babies according to the writer of the 14th Jacob Howell.  DEPORT HER!
@GovMikeHuckabee Better ask Willie Brown about specific "positions" she takes....
@TEDTalks @KHayhoe Getting to zero carbon takes steps.  My engine on NH3 can get us there, but you also need to use carbon fuels for many years to make the bridge.  The fastest way to zero carbon is my technology.  read my tweets if you actually care about energy future.  Discuss?
@charliekirk11 imansion that....who would have thought.
@Pamben01 @SpeakerPelosi @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Is there any pol that is NOT corrupt?  Hand full?  Time to take them all out.
To make 100% renewable as a reasonable cost you need to have NH3 and power generation in the house or building where the solar is created.  Finally, power generation for grid should be by house power, not central power to get lowest costs.
There is NO need for "smart grid" when you use NH3.  Smart grid turns off power when demand spikes.  It is invasive and not what people want.  The problem with turbines is the waste heat of NH3 combustion is not used in house for 100% use.  CHP (Combined heat and power) is key.
@BlazeTV @MillerStream My engine that can run 6 fuels at 60-75% can also run NH3 and make it via electricity at ~ $0.75-1.3 cents/gal equiv to gasoline.  100% renewables IS possible, but not with Harris' junk.
@LaylaAlisha11 She is NOT eligible to be POTUS.  Both parents MUST be citizens at the time of birth.  Her parents were in USA only 4 years when she was born and 5 was the minimum to apply....  NOT Natural born....

Wind claims to be 3-6 cents/kwh.  This all needs to go to NH3 to use in cars, trucks, airplanes.   		https://t.co/RZgV8SlLQE
At 2.49 cent/kwh and 1.55 x to make NH3, the cost of NH3 would be:  		$0.0249 /kwh x 1.55 x 33.7 kwh/gal =$1.3/gal equivalent to gasoline.  3:1 ratio 43 cents/gal NH3.  		Gasoline is now about $1.3/gal.  I am actually very close here with my calculations.  NH3 is the future....

@Jessicalessin Uber is worth ZERO when my engine and seaplane come out.  Their air taxi nonsense won't work.  Mine will.  Door to door air taxi via my seaplane at less than airliner costs and faster.
@GaetaSusan @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @tedcruz @RandPaul @GOPLeader @Jim_Jordan This is why wind and solar PV will NOT work.  There has to be a fuel store to cover times when no renewable source works.  NH3 is that fuel.  My engine will be able to do 24/7, 365 in any weather...and use 6 carbon fuels too.  CO2 is good for plants. Future of energy&gt;read tweets.
With my engine system in house power and with roadable seaplanes, we have all the freeways and power lines we need.  No more needs to be built.  Fly instead of drive.  Use local solar and NH3 instead of grid.  Grid may not survive this....
If you try to make all cars electrical without my engine system, the grid costs will be enormous, very obnoxious visually, and they will require lots of right of way with high voltage lines that nobody wants.  Distributed power is the future, not centralized.  This is key....&gt;
If you back up and ask the question of how the grid should be made, with my engine system in mind, which is NOT now possible on the grid, you come to a much SMALLER grid even though electrical power goes UP dramatically, either by NH3 making or electric car use.
Ideally speaking, a neighborhood could drop to a market based price for electricity during a loss of grid connection.  Each provider would get paid according to the minute by minute price.  Those with lots of fuel to "share" will get paid for it fair price.  Not an emergency....&gt;
When grid goes down, the engines within island network switch to island mode and predetermined controls. The power to each engine is then controlled via the  connections within the electrical grid.  This is what I want to get to as an Island system, as opposed to stand alone.
My engine, by design, will be able to work with other engines at different locations in a neighborhood.  One will be the "master" engine that sets voltage and frequency and the rest will be the slaves that follow the tempo.  This can be communicated via the Island electric wires.
To Island a grid is to make it a small grid for a neighborhood or town independent of the High voltage transformers and grid lines.  By being able to switch to my engine system, the grid can be offline and repairs made quickly.  Nobody gets hurt for lack of power.
The problem of EMP (electromagnetic pulse from nuclear bomb overhead) attack is it takes down the grid and without the grid, things don't work and repairs can't be made quickly.  Transformers are the key elements affected and they take months to make.  Solution?  Island all....&gt;
With NH3 makers and tanks in house yards, each house would have an indefinite fuel supply, thus preventing total collapse. Neighbors could share and keep their food in refrigerators from going bad should the grid be hit by EMP attack.  One house could sustain 3-5 house if need be
With my system, there is NO NEED to build out the grid at all.  Each house or neighborhood can be made to run separate (Islanded) from the grid should some emergency occur.  This would dramatically help national security, whereas more grid just make us vulnerable to EMP attack.
A reason to go to NH3 is if it can be made for LESS than gasoline and it allows you the ability to be independent in energy supply.  You can store up fuel like you store up food.  With the engine, solar and NH3 maker you can replenish supplies.  Go years without buying fuel...&gt;
According to some estimates the "green new deal" will cost $49 trillion dollars in the first 10 years or 4.9 trillion/year.  My engine systems will SAVE MONEY.  Wow, technology that can save 49 trillion over 10 years.		Want to help me save your wallet?		https://t.co/1mnJD7Cgmc
@Zero___Hour traitor.
@stripedbanana3 5 million???  Need that wall...two layers deep.
Then there is the fuel economy issue added to the many fuel types.  Once car could be low drag and another car high drag.  For example, a Jeep C5 at 18 sft of drag vs a Corrvette at 5.5 sft of drag, but around the same weight.  The main factors are distance and weight, not drag.
Clearly, the only valid means to tax road use is by weight and miles.  This is what fuel taxes now do.  Heavy cars get less fuel economy and hence pay more tax/mile.  With many fuels enabled, both from stations and houses, the tax must be at registration with weight x distance.
@JackPosobiec If the program started and you attempt to stop it, then you abort it.  Conception is the point of choice, not after.
@JohnBrennan All I can say is get ready for GITMO....Traitor.
@Ptofimpact @mikebwonder She clearly is NOT eligible to be POTUS.  Both parents MUST be citizens at time of birth and both were not in the country long enough (5 years) for that to occur.  She may not even be a citizen under correct 14th Amendment reading.  No Alien can confer citizenship to child.
@KamalaHarris Kamala, were your parents citizens at the time of your birth?  Yes or No?  I don't see how they could have been since it took 5 years from first residence to become citizens and you were born before that.  You are clearly NOT eligible girl...  Stop the fraud.
@wildwohl @JulioAc68136033 @DGPurser @KamalaHarris David, in 1868 when writing the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howell specially stated that Alien parents can't confer citizenship to child via 14th as they are not subject to the jurisdiction.  Kamala is NOT natural born because both parents are not citizens as required.
@TeaBoots Every Illegal cost a certain amount.  That amount must be paid by Mexico, not USA.  Once Mexico realizes they have to pay for the high costs in the USA, they will fix the problem.  Cheaper to live in Mexico than USA.  Fix birth right nonsense and incentives gone.
Right now with current road tax connected to the fuel, you would not pay any road tax by using NH3, just like electric cars do not pay road tax.  At 200 mpg a 45 cent road tax/gal would cost 0.225 cents/mile.  Cars now pay around 2 cents/mile at 22.5 mpg.  2/0.225 = 8.88.
@cosmictruthguru @Solmemes1 Looks like Macron's days are numbered.  Just a matter of time.
NH3 Cons:		Capital costs up front vs none via station.	Space for fuel maker	Need for solar or low cost electricity	Opportunity cost of electricity to grid	Tank space (small)	Volume 3x more than gasoline	Weight 2.4 times more/energy	Permitting for house	Safety issues	Maintenance
@seanhannity She will do or screw anything to get elected...
NH3 pros:  		No dependence on oil companies or oil, funding terrorists 	No loss of power in zombie Apocalypse	No future CO2 taxes	Fuel made anywhere	Make solar 100% of energy via NH3 storage	Fuel cars via solar	Fixed price of energy via capital, not manipulated oil markets.
After much refinement and cost reductions, NH3 could get down to ~ 75 cent/gal equivalent to gasoline (25 cent/gal NH3). 		My question is:  Since CO2 is a good thing, not bad, and AGW theory is bogus and will collapse soon, investing in NH3 has risks and benefits.  List them out.
The cost of a barrel of oil is around $42 now.  There are 42 gallons/barrel.  So, each gallon should cost $1 plus refining, transportation and marketing.  In CO the cost is $1.75.  Road tax is 45 which make the fuel cost ~$1.3.  This is about where NH3 will be with my engine.
@adjunctprofessr @POTUS To qualify for Natural born, you cannot have any other option.  Put another way, if you are the captain of the ship, you must go down with the ship if it sinks.  You have no option to jump ship to another State which is possible under all other citizen forms, except Natural born.
@HenryK_B_ @Greenpeace This shows that even crazy CO2 NAZIs (Merkel) don't understand the end game, which is NH3 via wind/solar renewable energy.  My tweets explain the future....you might want to read them....  I am all for MORE CO2, but if NH3 is cheaper....no more gas or oil needed.
@mikandynothem @DineshDSouza @KatTheHammer1 @codeofvets @chuckwoolery @DonnaWR8 @RealKyleMorris @daGrizzman @LeahR77 @ArizonaKayte Gore was frozen to the Gore....
@adjunctprofessr @POTUS She is also another person who is NOT eligible to run, just like Obama and Ted Cruz, G Romney.  Both parents MUST be citizen as well as born on the land to be natural born.  No other option of citizenship can be possible to quality.  She could become Jamaican or India via parents
@lthomas2689 Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens...  An alien is NOT a subject of USA.  It would be like saying I am a British "subject" and when I travel I become a USA subject.  Can only be subject to one.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane Notice that FDR, Prescott Bush, Hoover and all the political class LOVED Hitler as they loaned him money and bankrupted Americans (flow of gold to Germany...).  When Hitler figured out he did not need the banks, he became their enemy, just like Lincoln and JFK did.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane The right to a person's name allows a government to tax you for the protection provided.  This includes taking out loans, and allows money to be printed.  Lincoln, JFK and Hitler knew this, and thus were killed when they tried to exercise this money printing power.
Again, a greenhouse is a "convection and conduction limiting device" and as such cannot be in effect until the convection and conduction is indeed limited.  Air is NOT a greenhouse, nor is the spectrum of IR radiation closed as to "trap" anything, just as Fourier said in 1820.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane When Harris's parents came to USA they still had protection via their Jamaican and Indian governments, NOT USA.  Their child (Kamala) fell under their parents jurisdiction as Aliens, not USA.  Jacob Howell stated that NO Alien can confer citizenship to child via 14th Amendment.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane A citizen is "one who give up the right to his name for protection by an Estate (State)."  If I am a USA citizen I can't give up the right to my name to Mexico too.  Only one state can claim and tax at a time.  My passport is a protection via treaties when I travel.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane My cousin (rich guy) has property in Mexico.  He got a Mexican driver's license.  He speeds and cops don't give him a ticket.  Why?  Because as a Mexican (actually USA guy) they are not "subject to the jurisdiction" due to treaties.  This is why criminals are DEPORTED.
The effect of CO2, like closing a window, occurs in the first 20-80 ppm.  It finds a new equilibrium and temperature and adding MORE insulation (CO2) to the wall section/segment does little to "trap" heat in the building.  Heat just goes around it via other paths still open.
@BethanyB_AdamG @ChatByCC @Pudingtane This would also unplug Obama when people understand it, as well as the proper understanding of the 14th Amendment which does not allow anchor babies.  Trump team already has stated no anchor babies.  Population needs to be correctly educated on Jacob Howell and 14th Amendment.
The atmosphere is like a house with half the walls in place.  The attenuation of any GHG is like a wall.  More = insulation.  Re-radiation to ground causes the heat to find another path via frequencies not attenuated, and the heat escapes.  Adding insulation to a wall does zero.
Why does heating occur only when the last window and door is closed?  Because convection currents become stronger through the remaining openings to balance heat, canceling out most of the the effect of closing an incremental door.  When the last opening is closed, heating occurs.
Try this experiment.  Open ALL windows and doors of house 100% and turn heater on.  Then close one at a time.  Does the house get warmer by an equal percentage of the window or door area?  No!  Why?  Convection!  Not until the last window is closed will heating occur. Understand?
When you open a window in house, the heating effect goes away and does not occur unless the convection currents are blocked by windows and doors.  Even one window kills the effect, let alone half the house.  Closing each window does not heat more and more due to convection....&gt;
In 1820 Fourier basically stated that for a greenhouse effect to occur ALL of the spectrum had to be attenuated, not just part.  There cannot be any holes for the heat to get out.  Clearly, IR attenuation graphs show that heat is not fully attenuated, therefore AGW = false.
When heat re-radiates down to the ground, which is like a pool of energy, the heat is transferred to colder areas due to the natural flow of heat.  The cold areas are cold because radiation went to space.  The heat is supplied by the re-radiated heat to the ground....out it goes.
On a cold day, open all the windows.  Is the house warm?  NO!  Close more and more windows.  Even if one window remains open, the house remains cold.  The same applies to Infrared radiation (IR).  Unless ALL (!) the spectrum is absorbing fully (100%) you don't have a greenhouse.
This cartoon ironically proves AGW false.  Follow me here...  		A gate half open cannot trap half the sheep.  If the IR spectrum is only half attenuated, you cannot trap half the radiation.  Can you see?  No greenhouse without walls.  No AGW without ALL the spectrum attenuated. https://t.co/uAAnW96VJS
@ChatByCC They think they are sports cars sometimes.  Imagine what will happen when they have 1500 HP with my new engine instead of the 450 hp they now have....  They will be able to keep up with the flow of traffic for sure, but some will become more aggressive.
@brithume @tombrokaw It also show they don't want to assimilate.
Since a wall is already legal, why then all this fight?  Must be some kind of bate or pre-run trial on a shutdown to do a RIF.  An EO was made in March 17 for a restructure, so all the pieces are in place to do a massive RIF.  Should be interesting... https://t.co/3ihCsPZ1wY
@ChatByCC Harris also pretended to be eligible....both parents must be citizens at time of birth, plus born on the land.  3 elements.  She only has one, making her an anchor baby, which is absurd notion for POTUS.

@lthomas2689 I don't care about your gender or race.  I do care if you have ideas that will work.  Her press conferences and interview with Cooper shows she is a hack and devoid of original ideas that are not just old junk that makes her well connected friends rich.  Unsafe at any speed....
@lthomas2689 No problem with women running.  I don't want another racist like Obama.  Their policies hurt people.  Both have no idea how to fix health care.  They want to force me to buy junk products I don't want.  They want to rule and reign like some god over us.  Not interested.
@lthomas2689 Look, if her parents were NOT citizens at the time of birth, Harris is not eligible.  Running when not eligible is committing a fraud.  The liability to the party should be in the $100's of billions.  If they can't figure out she is not eligible then they should not be a party.
@lthomas2689 So says the racist...  Harris is a racist at the core.  People who support racists are most likely racists.  Group politics is about in group preference and racism at the core is group politics.

@KamalaHarris Ok, then start training people to use firearms safely and eliminate all bans.  Then people will be able to defend themselves and the crime rates will plummet.
@atimlet Ydounvme, have you read my tweets?  Want to help people get out of poverty?  Start by reading my tweets.
The cost of driving a Tesla vs driving my new car with new engine on NH3 at 75 c/gal e is between 21-64 times MORE for the Tesla.  This depends on several factors.  Anyway you slice it, it will cost a lot more to go electric.  And then there is the weight and flying.  Understand?
@KamalaHarris You are NOT eligible.  Save your money.  Running when not eligible can be considered fraud....
Some hard numbers.  Assume:		12 cent/kwh for electricity = $4.04/gal e.	Battery $4/gal e use	Supercharger $4/gal	Total 8-12/gal e		NH3 $0.75/gal e.		200 mpg my car vs 100 mpg Tesla.  2x city with heat.		8 to 12/.75 = 10.66-16 :1  	x 2 = 21.32-32 :1	x 4 = 42.64-64 :1		Understand?
So, below I show a clear path to zero carbon, that allows carbon fuels also, thus allowing all to use engine regardless of beliefs about CO2.  This step by step path will lead to much lower energy costs and much a faster move to zero carbon, all the while allowing Carbon fuels.
By making your own fuel at home, you cut out the middle man.  Electricity at the coal plant is 2 cent/kwh, but by the time it gets to your house they charge 12-15 cents/kwh or about 6-7 times more.  You save this markup in price by making your own NH3 fuel.  Lowest cost to zero C
If my engine can get 200 mpge on NH3 from house at 75 c/gal e instead of 100 mpge on electricity like a Tesla, the 13.33 times advantage doubles again to 26.66 times less.  City driving?  Double again... 53.33 times more to run Tesla.  Understand?  GAME OVER for Electric cars.
The grid will take many many years to become zero carbon and at massive costs which in essence double cost.  Current electricity is 15 cent/kwh = $5/gal.  Double that...$10/gal.  My engine system could make NH3 at $0.75/gal e or 13.33 times less.  Key.  Why pay more?
When the grid goes zero carbon, there will be massive amounts of NH3 at  cheap prices for people to use in cars, truck, airplanes, boats, and  houses.  Now the grid is heavy carbon.  My system can be zero carbon 10-20  years or more ahead of grid. Electric cars = heavy carbon.
@atimlet If you treat me different because my skin is brown, yellow, orange (Trump), black or white, then you are not looking at the content of my character as MLK stated.  Are you principal based or group based?  Harris is a racist, and Dems are KKK racists and NAZIs at the core.
@atimlet Then that makes her a racist, right?  Racism at the core is group identity.  If you identify with a racial group and not as an individual, then you likely are to some degree a racist.  We all have in group racial preferences and nothing wrong with it.  Using race is the problem.
By not having a carbon tax, the massive fuel savings with the new car can be had with a new car purchase.  The key to getting to zero carbon ASAP is quick adoption of new engine.  This mean new cars.  A tax raises the price and slows adoption of best path to zero carbon.
Most people don't live in an ideal house for solar and will need to rely on NH3 from other sources.  By having a carbon tax, it takes the savings away from the new engine making a new purchase more difficult.  Getting people to buy new engine is key and Carbon tax kills incentive
By not having a carbon tax, a person can buy a car with new engine and they will get 70-80% of the fuel gone.  They will also be ABLE to use NH3 from stations when it becomes available in the future.  The savings then pays for house system and that person then is 100% zero carbon
At 75 cent/gal equivalent to gasoline for NH3, there is NO need for carbon fuel tax.   In fact it will hurt people in saving for engine, solar and NH3 maker. Those who cannot afford house units will be forced to pay higher prices for carbon fuel with new engine in car.
A rough guess is that heating/cooling costs can be cut by 90% over current electric bills and Natural Gas heating.  NH3 fuel for cars then will be mostly with NH3 from solar thermal and NH3 maker at 75 cent/gal e.  This will lock in low costs for any carbon fuels permanently.
With the engine making electricity in the house and solar thermal, small pumps can move the hot water into the storage tanks for very little costs, thus nearly zeroing out heating/cooling bills 80-90% of the time, depending on thermal storage.  Rest from NH3 via solar.
If the real number is 10% to make NH3, then we have 2 cent/kwh x 1.1 x 33.7 = $0.74/gal e, or 25 cents/gal NH3.  It this is possible, OIL/gas is history for transportation, grid, and more.  This is  tremendously HUGE as Trump likes to say.  Does not get any bigger.  Engine key..&gt;
@lthomas2689 This says that she is NOT qualified due to the 5 years residency needed to even apply for citizenship from the time they arrived in USA.  If true, then she is not eligible...100%.  I am not eligible because my mother became citizen 1.5 years after my b.		https://t.co/DPBCe8rqBC
@lthomas2689 Which is it?  Yes or no?  If both were citizens AT THE TIME OF BIRTH then she is eligible.  If not, then no.  Facts only matter.  No speculation is needed.  No Obama seal docs will be allowed.
@lthomas2689 Ok, she is 100% NOT eligible.  Game over...next candidate....Bernie maybe?
The process of NH3 making has N2 separation from air.  This takes air pressure.  My engine can provide a synergy in the process, thus allowing a smaller device and less energy.  The Stanford professor says 10% is the real number, not 1.35-1.55 when done right.
@lthomas2689 Howell was the person who wrote the 14th Amendment in 1868...  I suggest you humble yourself and comply with actual law, not opinion. The burden of proof of her eligibility is on Harris, not me.  He parents were NOT citizens from what I read.  Were they citizens at b?  Yes or no?
Notice that a battery takes X to charge and returns 80% of X in electricity.  		The NH3 maker takes X and returns 65-75% of X in the form of NH3.  		Both are basically chemical reactions and should be similar in energy use.  The higher use in NH3 is likely from process pressures.
@lthomas2689 Ok, born on the land is 1 of three elements.  Both parents MUST be citizens AT THE TIME OF BIRSTH.  Were they?  Yes or No?  I only see they were not.  Jacob Howell specifically stated Alien parents can't confer citizenship to child via the 14th.   If both not, deport her.
@SylviaD32911201 A gate half open (IR spectrum) cannot trap half the sheep.  A fence around 1/2 of your yard will not trap half the dogs.  Upon reradiation to ground, the heat moves to frequencies that go out to space by passing CO@, water, etc...past the gate...  No effect.  AGW is false.
@SylviaD32911201 A greenhouse requires all the panels to be closed to have an effect.  Try this in your house.  Open just one window and see what happens...cold.  The ENTIRE IR spectrum must be attenuated for a greenhouse to be in effect.  only 50% is.  More CO2 is like closing a window on patio.
@SylviaD32911201 CO2 has no effect on climate.  Look at an attenuation graph of Infrared Radiation.  Water is 100% attenuated.  Notice there is a large area that is NOT.  It is like saying half my house wall can be gone and I will "trap" heat.  Not until you seal up the house will it "trap" any.
@lthomas2689 Were both parents citizens at the time of her birth?  Yes or no?  From what I see, no is the answer.  If no, with either parent, she is NOT natural born.
@lthomas2689 Jamaican and Indian parents.
My estimate below of NH3 is higher than what I believe I can do.  I see 1 cent/kwh for engine + 1 for solar and maker.  Total 2 cents/kwh for electricity without capital costs.  That makes NH3 fuel = $0.91-1.04/ gal equivalent to  gasoline.  3:1 volume/Kwh ratio 30-34 c/gal NH3.
So, possible costs of NH3 from solar thermal via my engine could be around $1.27-1.46/gallon equivalent to gasoline.  3:1 ratio in energy/volume of gasoline to NH3 makes each gallon of NH3 cost around 42-48 cents/gallon of NH3.  Per Liter?  11.1-12.7 cents/Liter.   Understand?
@lthomas2689 @go4itbas No, an anchor baby is 100% not eligible.  Absurd interpretation of the clause.
My estimates in previous tweets was 2:1 for NH3 makes.  Actual is much better. 1.35-1.55 or 65-75% recover vs 50% as estimated.  		If Solar is 2.8 cent/kwh then, NH3 Cost= 	$0.028 x 1.55 x 33.7 =$1.46/gal 	$0.028 x 1.35 x 33.7 =$1.27/gal		NH3= $1.27-1.46/ gal equiv gasoline. OK!
If you put in X amount of energy in NH3 maker you can get back 65-75% of the energy in the form of NH3.  		If my engine combustion is 75%, that makes 48-56% round trip.   	At 60% combustion then 39-45%. 		An electric car can only recover 36-50% during braking.	A battery alone=80%
@2Hearts @Slate Not true.  If you have to select from a pool of Mechanical engineers and few are women or of a certain ethnic background because they did not apply or qualified to be Mech engineers, he can actually be biased FOR the ethnic group/women yet few are included due to the pool.
@atimlet If she was born in the USA, then she was native born.  To be eligible she has to be NATURAL BORN which required second generation citizen (both parents citizen at time of birth) and born on land.  Indians were "native born" but did not have citizenship...   Don't care about color
@martinjcowling @Sophiemcneill Surrah 4:11, 2:282, 5:6, 2:223, 4:3, 53:27, 4:24, 33:50.  		Bible says lots.  Where should I start?  		Kafir....
@Brought_to_You CO2 has no effect on climate, and neither is there any data showing it does.  It absorbs in less than ten months and is entirely beneficial to earth.  If I could I would triple the CO2....
@USALoyalty1776 @KamalaHarris She is totally not eligible to be POTUS.  NOT natural born as anchor baby.  The notion that an anchor baby can become POTUS is silly on its face.  Alien parents cannot give citizen to child under 14th per the original intent as Jacob Howell (author) stated.  This must be fixed..
@JohnDou01995952 @fobsurfer @RodStryker Both must be citizen, not one, otherwise the child has the option at 18 or anytime, depending on case, to choose.  POTUS can't jump ship and must not have any option to.   Quite simple.  Second generation or later.  NO first gens.
@LindaForAmerica She is NOT eligible as an anchor baby.
@KamalaHarris You are NOT eligible.  You are actually not even a citizen under the 14th per Jacob Howells original intent.  Resign....deport.
@FredDoucetteNH @tombrokaw @BarackObama A melting pot requires assimilation.  Tom was correct.
@fobsurfer Three things are needed to be eligible.  Two parents that are citizens at the time of birth and born on the land.  No duel citizenship is allows by the definition of a citizen, btw.
@NevadaJack2 @fobsurfer Yes it does.  The 14th Amendment did not allow alien's children to become citizens.  Both parents MUST be citizens at the time of birth otherwise the child has claim to another State.  They cannot have an option to "jump ship" to another State should they become traitors.
@JohnDou01995952 @fobsurfer @RodStryker Yes he is.  His parents were citizens at the time of his birth.  The parents do NOT need to be born in the USA.  They just have to be citizens at the time of birth and not a dual citizen.  Also, must be born on the land.  Second generation, not first generation.
@AIIAmericanGirI @FoxNews An anchor baby is NOT eligible.  Also, the 14th Amendment per the author Jacob Howell did not allow aliens make there children citizens.  Deport her.
@KamalaHarris Sorry, but an anchor baby is NOT eligible.  Save your money....
The guy in video admits that going ALL renewable will basically double costs.  That means 15 to 30 cent/kwh.  My system will cut costs  down to 20-25% or maybe 10% depending on what you consider baseline (3 c/kwh).  Key problem is the wind and PV panel costs and grid issues.
Storage of NH3 is $0.1-0.2/kwh.  33.7 kwh/gal x 300 gal = $1011-2022.  Cheap.  		Note, he says 		Must think: 	Beyond electricity	Complete energy systems		My engine system is total stand alone. 		He admit costs twice as much for all renewable.		Mine 1/4th costs!
The video "running the world on renewables" states at 19:40 time that we "CANNOT with only electricity transmission" which I agree with.  Actually we only need house solar and my engine system, solar thermal and store, and NH3 maker and tanks.  "Beyond 'Smart Grid'"  Electrofuels
Here is another video similar to last one on NH3.  		Note at 18.28 times, it takes 7000-8000 kwh/1000kg.  NH3 = 5.166 kw-hr/kg.  		7000/5166 =1.35.  8000/5166=1.54  		Takes 1.35-1.55 (74-65%) times more to store x amount from electricity to NH3.  Great! 	 	https://t.co/b5fzqcES6U
@TulsiGabbard My engine solves your CO2 problem and terrorist funding via oil.  No need to worry.  No battery needed.  Engine can run on NH3 and 6 other fuel.  Save 70-80% of the fuel of car just by replacing engine in old car.  100-200 mpg....  NH3 for $2-3/gal e.  Electrics won't work.
Yes.... https://t.co/kFqdfg6pQ2
@VanidaPeters @POTUS Anchor babies are NOT natural born citizens and therefore NOT eligible.  Also, Jacob Howell who wrote the 14th Amendment stated a child from alien parents would not be considered a citizen under 14th.  Deport her!
@LyxProOfficial I C sharply what you say.
All the blame??? Why?  Because they don't have solutions like what I have.  The system needs to be changed to what I have in mind to allow MARKET prices and entrants from many sources.  NO MORE monopolies.  No more blackouts.  Anybody interested in this important topic? Crickets?
Funny thing, just ONE black out could fund the development and capitalization of my engine that would free us all from this crazy nonsense.  Modifications to the grid would be needed, but at the core, my engine is key.  24/7, 365 days.  Anybody willing to discuss?  This is key.
The grid design is about making a few people very rich and to overcome flaws in the design of engine systems.  My engine can solve ALL of this nonsense and lead to viable renewable power that will NOT go down like this video/article shows.  Interested?		https://t.co/x05WMjcZSB
I bring up the "natural born citizen" issue and eligibility to illustrate how so called "experts" can be so wrong on such a simple topic.  The same applies to engines.  Entire industries fail to make correct engines due to false dogmas and bad precedence.  They are stuck in box.
If Obama's real parent was Marshall Davis, who was a citizen, he may be eligible if born in the USA.  Hence the birth certificate controversy.  If Obama's dad was the Kenyan, as is claimed, then Obama is NOT eligible.  If Kenyan was married to Ann and Davis was the donor, then no
In the Case of Ted Cruz and Barrack Obama (Barry Sortoro or whatever his real name is) have ONE parent who is citizen then they are citizens, but NOT eligible to be POTUS.  The MUST be SECOND generation Citizen, NOT first.
If @KamalaHarris has a Jamacian parent and a Indian parent at the time of her birth she is an anchor baby which is NOT valid under the 14th Amendment according to Jacob Howell who drafted it.  She should be deported.  100% not eligible.
To be eligible therefore to be president you have have NO other option of citizenship, either by parents or where you are born.  If the ship of State sinks, you go down with it.  No jumping ship.  		Three elements:  Place (USA) and two parent both citizens AT THE TIME of birth.
If one parent is USA citizen and one is Alien, you get an option to be one or the other at the time a majority (18).  That is when you decide.  This option precludes you from being "natural born" because you have to decided and there is an option to be a foreigner and move there.
Two aliens cannot confer legal status of their child in a foreign estate (USA) by virtue of them being born here.  Jacob Howell who drafter the 14th Amendment specifically stated this.  Anchor babies are citizens of parent's country, NOT USA.
If you are an alien and have a passport you are the Chattlel of the Estate you came from.  They have legal obligations to protect you as their citizen.  When you visit you are under the original countries jurisdiction NOT USA, and neither is your child who has no legal status.
You CANNOT give up your right to your name to two Estates.   Abe Lincoln, JFK and Hitler all understood that the right to tax citizens gave them the right to have sovereign money...green backs...Marks.  This is what our government does...take loans out against future taxes.
The issue of being eligible to be POTUS has come up again with @KamalaHarris  running.  		Citizen = one who has given up the right to his name for protection by an Estate.	Denizen = one who RETAINS the right to his name that is living in an Estate.		Read that .....&gt;
@KamalaHarris You are not eligible to be POTUS.  Anchor baby should not have citizenship per 14th Amendment.  You should be deported.
@fundingmonster My engine system can solve this problem....  interested in discussion?
@ouchinagirl @SenKamalaHarris @nypost @FreeBeacon @POTUS She is NOT eligible to to be POTUS, nor citizen.  The 14th Amendment did not allow anchor babies.  This is a total joke.  Deport her.
@MAGA2ARIGHTS Now that was funny!
@Sweet_PeaBelle She should not even be a citizen as an anchor baby.  The 14th Amendment does NOT confer citizenship to alien born people.  This false understanding must change.  She is not eligible to be President OR citizen.  Deport her.

I spell it out.  I calculate the costs.  Several things are needed, but all doable.  The world can get out of poverty with this technology but will not with expensive wind and PV panels.
How do you control for CO2 in the greenhouse?  1200 ppm is ideal.  What if you need heat due to night or clouds (no solar), but do not need more CO2?  You run NH3.  BOTH fuels are NEEDED, NOT ONE.  My engine can handle both and maintain temperature and CO2 levels in greenhouse.
Here is the problem.  You have a large greenhouse.  You have solar making NH3.  How do you get the CO2?  You have to use a CO2 fuel maker.  Difficult now.  What do you need?  CARBON fuels!  You run house and operation via engine with carbon fuel as part of mix with NH3.
My gut tells me that when people read my tweets and understand what I am saying (few have or seem to be able to), they realize that zero carbon is very doable.  They also realize that CO2 is valuable.  Both carbon fuels and NH3 will be part of the mix, both made via solar.
@SteveForbesCEO Know anybody who actually want to solve energy and not just tax people about carbon?  My engine can use 6 carbon fuels and NH3.  No need for carbon taxes.  People who think CO2 is good or those that hate it can use this technology.  Save $500 billion/y in fuel.
@GaetaSusan @KamalaHarris She is not eligible to be POTUS.
Wow, someone is thinking.  Change we can believe in.... https://t.co/0rg8i5mK8F
Notice that NOT ONE AGW alarmist has asked me ONE question on how to get to zero carbon.  NOT one, so far.  How can that be?  Clearly CO2 is not the issue then.  That is why my engine MUST be able to use 6 carbon fuels and NH3.  The fraud of AGW is coming out and investments ???
@KAG4All Maybe they should charge an indulgence for each abortion.  Could be a big money maker for them, just like the good old days before Martin Luther (1517) ruined the party.

@jojoh888 @KamalaHarris Would?  You mean has done....
@Mediaite RACIST!!!!!!!!  Destroy him NOW!!!!!
@WayneDupreeShow She is an anchor baby....like having Putin screw a USA women, let them live to 14 year old, then train them in the Kremlin...then fund them to run for president.  Anchor baby is NOT natural born...not eligible.  Both parents must be citizens at time of birth, not one, or none.
@TrumpsWolf10 @KamalaHarris You should sell it in "mattress back" to better summarize her "journey" in poly-dicks.
@AllyValentino @whcampbell67 @Slate Yes, race is not an issue or should not be in a judge.  Then why did you mention it?  Because you want biased judges with certain bent values that bias toward a political view expected by "minority" groups.  What did I miss?
Here officer, you don't think I am using NH3?  Put your nose right there and breath deep....  Careful, might smell nasty.  Should I call 911?  That should solve that problem.
@AllyValentino @whcampbell67 @Slate A judge does not "represent" anybody.  That is what the Attorney does.  The very core of your thought process IS racist 100%.
@tom_peters @bobjessup @LeahAhuva @matttreacy Me too...
@thebradfordfile Hold Hillary to account....
@tom_peters @bobjessup @LeahAhuva @matttreacy Says who?  Most think they are queen bees and entitled to everything for no work.
@AllyValentino @whcampbell67 @Slate If race matters then the judge is biased and should be removed.  A Person of HONOR must have 1) clean hands, 2) be unbiased, 3) and be of good faith (moral character).  Race or color cannot be part of the measure.  If it is, like you want, then that judge is dishonorable. removed
@2Hearts @Slate It should not matter what the race or color is if the judge is unbiased.  What you are saying is you want biased judges.  That is not valid.
@AllyValentino @whcampbell67 @Slate Are you a racist toward whites?

@trustrestored The reason they can't is because they are globalists who hate people.  Chinese are their slaves, and they love slavery.
@FredKrupp Fred, my engine solves the CO2 problem to zero carbon.  You need to consult with me before you make more mistakes.  read my tweets.  NH3 is the future, but there is a better way to get there than what you know of...by 16 times less cost.
When crazy people ban carbon fuels on the ground, I can use NH3 in one tank for road operations, and then switch to gasoline for long range in the airplane.  By having 1 small tank with NH3, I can get past the carbon NAZIs.  If they don't think it is NH3, I have them smell it...
The reason GA (general aviation) is dead is because the products KILL PEOPLE.  Why would someone want to kill their customers?  I go to Oshkosh, Sun N Fun, Arlington and other EAA airshows and all I see are death machines, and they wonder why GA is dead....  Twilight zone....
From what I state below, that an airplane needs multiple tanks, multiple engines and be able to use multiple fuels, is there one airplane that qualifies?  Not that I know of.  Clearly 99+% of the GA airplanes can't meet the test or standard.  I wonder why GA is dead?  Conspiracy?
@AJCGlobal Is this a joke?  Got nothing better to do than make up fake news?  Get a life.
@ClimateDepot CO2 cannot control climate.  Can we just grow up and realize CO2 is a good thing?  BTW, my engine with NH3 solves the CO2 issue, so give it a rest.  The world will run by NH3 in the future, all by solar, not because some cult belief but because it is cheaper.  Understand?
One of the reasons airplanes are expensive is the fuel costs and liability. The key to low cost flying is cheap fuel, which may not always be perfect or even usable.  You have to design the airplane for this unknown fuel quality and have a means to test it without risks to craft.
@Lumberist 42 US gallons/barrel.  3.78 liters/gal.  $42.69/42/3.78= $0.26/liter.  Lots of taxes and mark up in fuel...
If you have six 10 gallon tanks, one tank can be known fuel quality.  Ground test new fuel for performance.  OK?  Then takeoff.  The known fuel is used for initial takeoff.  Test out new fuel in each tank in air to see if all goes well as second check to ground tests.  No crashes
The FAA requires 30 minutes for VFR and 45 minutes for IFR flight.  If the airplane burns 10 gal/hr, that means you must have 5 gallons (VFR) or 7.5 gallons (IFR) left at landing.  If tanks are 60 gallons (like C-172) that means about 16% of the fuel needs to be known.  6 tanks.
With many motors, the new fuel is put into empty tanks.  The full tank with known good fuel could be a 1 hour tank, for example, that meets FAA rules.  Takeoff, switch to tanks with new fuel and run on a few motors to see if fuel works normally.  If bad, return and land. No crash
Another issue is the engine system MUST have multiple engines and fuel paths so that one fuel type or fill up won't take the airplane out.  Fuel quality control is not always certain at some car fuel stations. Fuel system design must account for issues including water for safety.
Two things need to happen for GA to survive the "natural selection" process.  		1) needs to be able to use lots of fuels (gasoline), not just 100 LL or Jet A.  	2) needs to be roadable.		Using 100LL/JetA makes little sense when fuel stations have gasoline/Diesel in town.
We see this multi-fuel issue in aviation all the time.  Avgas (100LL) is around $5/gal.  Car gasoline is less than $2.5 with road tax.  About 1/2 the cost.  An airplane is stuck at airport and must buy expensive 100 LL.  GA is being "naturally selected" out of the "transit pool."
Does any higher order creature in nature run on one fuel?  To the degree that it can only eat one "fuel" or food, that creature is beholden to the supply and more likely to be "naturally selected" out of the gene pool.  One fuel can, however, give an advantage in some cases.
The problem with any type of fuel cell is the membrane and sensitivity to fuel contamination.  Pure fuel is costly to make.  My engine can run many fuels and mix them in one tank, by design.  Propane available...ok.  Diesel?  Ok.  NH3?  Ok...  No need to flush tanks.  Buy and go.
Any aware person knows that CO2, NH3, water and a greenhouse are the main keys to great crop yields.  My engine can HARVEST water, distill water (clean it to zero point), as well as use both carbon and NH3 fuels.  This is what aware people want, but don't have now. Think about it
Right now the AGW alarmists are screaming that the sky is falling and "climate change" will doom us all to certain destruction.  People are waking up and realizing CO2 has nothing to do with climate, but that it is the key to CLEAN FOODS you can grow at home.  Greenhouses+CO2!
If you can make NH3 for less than gasoline, what price would it be for a carbon fuel made via electricity?  The future is greenhouses at home, growing your own NON-GMO clean food.  CO2 AND NH3 are both the key to great crop growth. Both fuels will be wanted.  CO2 is scarce...gold
@audiF1 In a drag race version (which may be what you are after), the power ratio will be around 4-8 times more without a blow up.  ~ .125lbs/hp or 8 hp/lb, perhaps more...not my focus here.
@audiF1 Lycoming (Direct drive) 2 lbs/hp	Turbo prop P&amp;W 6A  ~ 0.5 lbs/hp.	Auto engine with transmission 3-4 lbs/hp	Diesel semi truck with transmission 7 lbs/hp		My engine with tanks and gears in semi 1 lbs/hp.  	My engine in seaplane (direct to props) 0.66 lbs/hp	Motor alone 0.33
The sane and valid solution INCLUDES carbon fuels and NH3.  If we can make NH3 and carbon fuels via electricity, why would we not use carbon fuels to aid in crop growth?  Silly nonsense to tax carbon fuels when you can make both from electricity.  The CO2 in the air becomes $$$!
In the future, perhaps 50 years from now, we can all use only NH3, but why would you limit yourself to only NH3 when carbon fuels from air can be made and used to power buildings AND run greenhouses for crops?  Pull CO2 out of air, burn for heat/electricity, use on crops
The reason you don't go to fuel cells and NH3 is because the ability to combust with my engine is the ability to use 6 fuels and NH3.  This allows airplanes to go anywhere with current fuel systems and not be range limited by NH3 supply or volume (3:1 to gasoline) issues.
@TAGOS22 In an Otto gasoline car (no road tax) 		Fuel $2/gal.  Efficiency 20% highway	Electricity $4/gal, Battery $4/gal.  75% highway		(4+4)/2  x 20/75 = 1.06 &gt; Electric more than Otto.		Without battery cost: 4/2  x 20/75 = 0.533 &gt; Electric LESS than Otto.		My engine 8/2 x 75/75= 4  Less
@TAGOS22 My calculation is on an equal basis.  		My engine will be 60-75%.  	Tesla is 60-75%		This means with 100% energy, 60-75% will hit road.  I put everything in terms of "gallon equiv to gasoline" because people in USA buy fuel by the gallon.  33.7 kw-hr/gallon equivalent per EPA.
Once you realize that liquid fuel is cheaper, less volume and less weight than batteries, and that the amount of storage needed to bridge long winter nights is much too high for a battery to work, you come back to combustion.   		My engine is the best option to solve zero carbon.
If you want to get to ZERO CARBON you need EXCESS renewable capacity to capture all the energy when the harvest is good, and then store it for when unavailable (night, clouds, no wind, etc).  NH3 is the easiest fuel to make.  CO2 to fuel also.  Either way, liquid is the means.
Below I calculated the volume and weight ratio of electric engine system vs my engine system and fuels (NH3) in zero carbon operation, along with costs.		Electric : My engine		Volume ratio = 10:1	Fuel weight ratio = 20:1	Cost ratio = 8-16:1		Need I say more people?  Check....mate
Battery volume/energy vs gasoline is 30:1, approximately.  NH3 to gasoline is 3:1.  		Battery to NH3 volume ratio =10:1.  		My engine motors  = to approximately electric motors in weight. 		Battery = 400 lbs/gal	NH3 fuel = 14.35 lbs/gal+5.65 tank= 20 lbs/gal		400/20 =20 :1
At 16:1 cost ratio of Electric car to my engine in a new car (fair comparison), it makes little sense or cents to do electric cars for any vehicles.  The future is in the air and my engine with NH3 is viable for airplane, but heavy battery based electric airplanes are not.
When you factor in 200 mpg with my engine in new car vs 100 mpg in electric car, and 2x in (slow) city driving due to heating/cooling, (2x2=4), along with 4:1 "fuel ratio," you get a city winter ratio of 16:1  Both run by solar/wind/hydro....  NH3 vs Electricity+battery =16:1
Either CO2 or NH3, the best way to store energy is via liquid fuels.  My engine will be par in efficiency to electric (like Tesla) cars, so the cost of battery and fuel is the issue.  		My engine = $2/gal e on NH3 or gasoline	Electrics = $4/gal e and $4/gal battery = $8/gal		4:1 https://t.co/3ySzAjUNQW
Someone thinks they can pull CO2 out of the air and make fuels.  Sounds good to me!  Just make it cheaper than oil.  Just as garbage dumps will be minded with Artificial Intelligence robots and become the "gold mines" of the future, the air with CO2 will become "gold mines" too. https://t.co/3ySzAjUNQW
@Tonycuz @KimboMycountry2 @charliekirk11 The reason for the numbers is corrupt connections in both places.  You have to study how corruption plays a role, which this video does not cover.

Assume 20 liters/day.  How much power needed?  20/3.78=5.3 gal.  at 33.7/3 = 59.4 kw-hr...over 24 hrs = 59.4/24=2.48 kw.  ...  double that....4.96 kw.  Assume 5.3 solar hrs in day.  59.4/5.3= 11.2 kw.  double... 22.4 kw.  Within range of house solar system.  Doable.
Wow, I feel his pain.  Can't get a reply because "THEY" are not in control.  		Little refrigerator sized box makes 20-24 liters/day.  More than enough with my engine to run cars, house and airplane for year if stored in tank and solar thermal store.		https://t.co/Up9IhKs5Zg
Again this video shows another view of NH3.  It would appear that people are starting to realize NH3 is the end game.  It will take a while to get this on the market and lower costs than fossil fuels.  In the mean time my engine can cut 80% of fuel needs.  https://t.co/AlWiV4fnNc
This company claims 30 cents/liter NH3.  3.78 L/gal x 3gal Nh3/gal  gasoline =  $3.4/ gal equiv to gasoline.  Gasoline is now &lt; $2/gal no tax.   Within last years gasoline price variation.  These costs  can all come  down to below $2/gal, but not at first https://t.co/bnZhVT4TYN
Assume from video data, 20% capital cost and 80% electricity at 5 c/kw-hr.  With my engine costs could be about 54% of $600/Mton = .54 x 12.5 = 0.0675/kw-hr....x 33.7= $2.28/gal equiv to gasoline.  This is well within doable range with lower cost of NH3 maker.  $2/gal e doable.
Notice in video at 23:40 with bought wind at 5 cent/kwhr they can make it for $600-700/ 1000 kg.   5.166 kw-hr/kg in NH3 x $600/1000kg = $0.125/kw-hr or about what grid electricity now costs.  Wind to NH3 = $500/Mton = 9.6 c/kw-hr (at 23:00 time).  Less than grid!
As you can see in the video, NH3 maker is not developed and there are many ways to make NH3.  With my engine, 70-80% of the is fuel gone.  Then later NH3 is added once the process is developed / discovered to finish off the rest.   Use Carbon fuel until. 		https://t.co/hWbQRxisAS
The biggest issue is that the current grid is a large monopoly run by well connected people.  It is NOT market based at the core.  It is managed.  But what happens when it is forced to become market based?  Lawsuits, technology, etc., can change it all, which will change the ROI.
If you invest in capital that has a high maintenance and low life cycle like wind and PV, you will end up making nothing come time to replace the parts.  You basically eat your seed capital. This is where my technology focuses in on, the cost of maintenance and longevity.
People make the mistake of using TODAY's price of energy and not understanding what the future supply from many people will do to the price.  If suddenly everybody can produce excess fuel, what would be the price of fuel?  Answer: based on labor input and capital costs.
When the technology goes to allowing everybody to produce energy, the value of energy in a market will be very very low due to supply.  Some will invest and provide fuel to neighbors and some will just buy fuel.  The competition will drive prices down to low wages and ROI.
Buyer beware. This video shows just how behind people are when you  understand what I  tweet.  Notice no mention of NH3! The value of solar will be nearly zero when all houses have solar during day.  Cost during night will be high.  Batteries no valid now. https://t.co/sFGAqqmb1i
The belief that "without oil nothing happens" will be shown to be wrong with my engine system and NH3 maker and storage.  All the "energy" investments such as wind and PV will not pan out and will be of little value due to high costs of maintenance.  No need for large batteries.
After 1 month of considering NH3 as a fuel and how to make it work, the new goal is to enable NH3 so that a house system can provide fuel back up to solar year round for house, and fuel to drive vehicles during the year. This fuel is stored in a propane type tank.  No oil needed
The reason to go with NH3 is mostly to be able to make fuel without the need of buying it from some central source.   In the event of some disaster or emergency, having independent fuel source is key.  If the grid goes down this system can still provide fuel for house + seaplane.

@rob_omgwtf @elonmusk As for black projects, we would hope they have something better than what I have after spending $21 trillion.  I don't have access, so all I can do is what I can do.  My engine and seaplane will do me fine....
@rob_omgwtf @elonmusk Musk has his views and they are strictly electric motors and batteries.  My engine should be 2-8 times less expensive in "fuel" but that does not matter to him.  He believes what he believes and will not look at combustion or NH3.

@Imamofpeace I wish we could do just that with certain religions (plural).  They want access to my space via their "laws" and they want to chant stuff in public and force me to be a member or I die.  Three religions do this and have done this.  All are invalid.
The reason "hybrids" were even considered is that IC engines can consume  2 times MORE fuel when ran at none optimum ranges.  Peak efficiency is  usually at around 3/4th throttle for an Otto engine, with a best range  in the 2000-2200 rpm. It varies. https://t.co/pEN5kIzqNZ
Most people don't realize that an any motor/engine, IC, electric or hydraulic, varies depending on load.  Each has a BSFC curve that maps how efficient it is at different torque and RPM settings.  They are NOT constant in the efficiencies.   Peak efficiency is only one setting...

In city driving during cold/hot times, the thermal load can be equal to the drive loads.  In my engine it is basically free and in Tesla it costs you $8/gal, 4 for electricity and 4 for battery use.

This helps keep the efficiency much high in real world city driving.  Also, the battery costs you $4/gal to use it.  Mine...zero.

You see this clearly in a Corvette that gets 25 mpg highway, but 12 city.  It should get at least 50 mpg city if it maintained highway efficiency, not 12.  This is what most people don't see.  The BSFC maps it to see.

It is all about the mapping of the BSFC.

Peak efficiency and average are NOT the same.  This is why there are Hybrid electrics, to take advantage of this shifting BSFC.  The motor/genset is run at best efficiency.  This is the reason for a Prius...or Volt...or any hybrid.

@rff @GibMetcalf NO!!!!!  I have the solution and path to get to ZERO CARBON.  By putting a carbon tax on fuels you will INCREASE the time it takes to get to zero carbon.  NO tax is needed to get house, factories, cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, ATVs to zero carbon.  read my tweets.  Wake up.
@KamalaHarris We should do it twice per year.  Like going on a three day fast.  Cleans the system out.

@leftsidestoryUS You solve that by a graduated SALES tax, not income tax.  If part of a cartel, the tax rate goes up.  Part of China's communist corp, taxes go sky high.  You must allow small people a spread between the well connected and the individual.  Socialism and Communism is cartel based.

Somewhat like a Lycoming, the engine can have each motor or "jug" removed, then overhauled without taking the entire engine apart.  But unlike a Lycoming, it is not a piston ring fit issue with oil, pistons and rods...mess.  Pull it out, plug in new.
The maintenance of the engine should also be much less in cost and time due to the part nature of the engine.  Each motor can be removed, worked on, and replaced without having to deal with a heavy engine, hoist and work stand.  Just work on any regular table, replace.

It can torque out from zero rpm too...

One shot and it is over.  The constant volume heat addition also limits the engine in other ways.  My engine has none of this problem.

It allows for good efficiency down to around 40-50% when not boosted, and when "torque" is needed boost kicks in hard and fuel is injected late in the stroke.  Not eff. though.

People want at least 150 hp. Power= torque x RPM  Whether you develop it at 1500 rpm or 5000 rpm, it does not matter.  The reason Diesel have "torque" is because of the turbo and fuel inject late in stroke.

If you drove your car around on 28 hp (450/80,000) your car would be considered JUNK.  The aero drag/lb is much higher for a car than a truck, so 50 hp would be more fair.
The distributed nature of the engine means it is like have many engines running the vehicle.  In the event one part fails, it can be isolated and the other engines continue to work.  No stopping at the side of the road or crash landing due to an engine malfunction.....&gt;
So much more than just torque.  It is the heart of the vehicle, keeping us warm/cool, and allowing clean water and showers as needed.  All this at a power to weight of about 1/2 to 1/3 that of a lycoming and much more compared to a GM engine.  Maintenance is another thing....&gt;
Adds in the ability to stay on islands without any services, thus allowing travel to places that would otherwise be very costly in terms of dwell time and clean water and sanitation.  The thermal issues then allow cold/hot climates and more.  The engine allows so much more ....&gt;
With the NH3 I can go where carbon fuels are banned and make my own fuel on any island without the need of fuel supplies.  This then gives more value to the solar parts of the system in remote applications and man camps, as well as disaster relief.  Water distillation then adds.&gt;
This then takes me full circle back to the original quest of taking my wife to Hawaii.  Being able to use all these fuels, and NH3 opens up the engine to a true world travel machine.  With the low fuel consumption and constant efficiency, I can get very long ranges and low costs.
This then lead to the awareness that energy could be solved and eventually to the understanding that NH3 could be used as the fuel and made from the house.  By using NH3 and 6 fuels found in house, station and airport, the engine could get me anywhere in the world safely.

Telsa discovered this and now has 2-3 motors and turns them off at lower power.  The electric "BSFC" remains more constant.  Why?  Motor is being worked. Key

@_Proud_American Each Senator is a crook....  Lock them all up.
@RealAmericaPat Said a person who did not invent anything in his life....
@docdhj @zerohedge @Lrihendry @kksheld The guy is a complete waste of grey hair....  He should just go retire to somewhere he can't do more damage to.  Even his finger that he points at us is limp.  Jeb was low energy.  Bernie is no energy.
This understanding of the need to land on a road completely changed my seaplane design and allowed me to get out of the box I was in.  It lead me to a new type of engine that is unlike jets or old piston crank engines, thus leading to solving energy, water, and so many things...&gt;
I debated people on Homebuilt-airplanes web page for almost a year about landing on roads.  It was an idea I had and all debaters were against it, which told me I was right.  Being able to land on road drives ALL of the design, especially the engine and characteristics needed.
The entire problem is analogous to climbing the corporate latter.  Climbing to the top of something you don't want to be at is a waste of time.  Knowing where to put the latter is very time consuming and difficult.  For Ex, knowing you have to land on the road is key to all.....&gt;
I started out just wanting to cut the fuel load to allow me to take my wife to Hawaii.  Step by step I realize there is a better way IF I change this or that.  This goes on for YEARS as I learn more and more what the real problem is.  Know what the real problem is is 80% of work.
Once of the biggest time consumers is realizing that something won't quite work.  You compromise, thinking that you can buy something off the shelf, to find out that it won't work or will be gone long before production starts.  No off the shelf part can be certified either....&gt;
And when it comes to airplanes, any existing engine company does NOT want their engine in an airplane unless they can charge you 10 times more.   With existing engine, the packaging is all wrong and the weight is much too high.  It all just does NOT work.  Sorry to say it.....&gt;
To build something new in engines, it has to have a major advantage over existing offerings.  There are thousands of engine companies with some small benefit here and there.  Any small thing would require me to scab of of existing firms which don't want me around.....&gt;
Most have some narrow agenda or desire to see something built well before they have a concept that is worth building.  Time after time this happens, where somebody gets an idea and they believe that "if you build it, they will come."  No, that only happens it makes lots of sense.
What I am realizing is that I might have to do this all alone, which is fine.  It may take longer, but in the end I will have a major breakthrough that I would not be able to achieve with help due to politics and diverse interests.  Most just want to bang something out.....&gt;
I am not saying that I have all the bugs worked out.  I am saying that I have a concept that is very promising and worth my own money to invest in.  All the previous concepts fell short of my willingness to invest.  Funny how one thinks when personal money is on the line...&gt;
That 9 years is really only part time and amounts to many concepts that were scrapped as I learned how to better solve the problem of energy.  Nine (9) years is far less compared to the billions of hours spent by other people and companies over the years in solving energy....&gt;
After being on twitter since 2009, only a few people have wanted to know anything about what I am doing.  I started out with a much different engine system and have moved from baseline engines to something that is very very cool.  Yes, it has taken around 9 years part time....&gt;
No matter how good the business opportunity is (10 times Apple....) most don't want to even ask or know. They just want to buy and sell stuff and jack up the price. They don't care about new and enabling technology.  They care about making money by scamming people with marketing.
I have realized that climate change people don't want to solve CO2.   They want power and control.  Many want population control and use CO2 as an excuse, but don't really believe the propaganda.  They are quite  ignorant in how things actually work in climate and don't care....&gt;
Summary of Twitter experience:		Only a hand full off people actually are interested in discussing my engine system and energy.  They want it all handed to them on a gold platter.  They don't want to be part of the journey to solve energy.  The only value so far is as a journal.

What is your need to know?
@karoolatas @Aqualyra @RippleZoo My engine systems eliminates the need to chop down trees for fuel.
@dreas7777 @Aqualyra @RippleZoo Whatever your belief, my engine can allow you to go zero carbon or use carbon fuels at about 1/4 of the amount.  Either way you meet or exceed the IPCC goals of 80% CO2 reduction.
@Aqualyra @RippleZoo Run all cars, airplanes, boats, houses/fatories/office space on engine with NH3.  Can use any 6 fuels and when NH3 comes on line switch over from carbon fuels when NH3 is cheaper.  Wind/PV to grid makes NH3 when excess exists.  Stations carry NH3 when engine is had.  see tweets.
@Aqualyra @RippleZoo Solution is new type of engine (see tweets), that can run on 6 fuels, NH3 and CH4 and solar thermal panels.  Solar thermal storage (hot water) links with water system for distillation.  Thermal bridges over night.  Solar-electricity-NH3, store NH3 in tanks, use when no solar .
@Aqualyra @karoolatas @RippleZoo No data shows any connection to CO2 and weather.  More just lowers the "height to extinction" and thus nothing more is done.  ALL of the effect is in the first 40 ppm, and at 400 ppm the height to extinction is 40 feet.  Twice CO2...20 feet, and so on.  CO2 is irrelevant.
@Aqualyra @karoolatas @RippleZoo Nonsense.  Either way, my engine with NH3 solves the CO2 from oil problem.  No more propaganda needed, just my engine system and NH3 fuel maker.  game over.
@Aqualyra @karoolatas @RippleZoo Aqualyra, that is nonsense.  Not what is going on....
@cjoshem @KamalaHarris Josh, that is the Dem way.  Maybe there should be a Democrat tax rate that covers all this "bridge loaning" via government so you can collect your "pay check" every two weeks.  The rest of us then can save for a rainy day.
@regrock29 @DisneyKid1955 @KamalaHarris BTW, a farmer does not get a true pay check until the crops are in and delivered, and in the between time he/she has to pay for all kinds of expenses and fees.  These government employees need to cry us all a river....amazing.
@regrock29 @DisneyKid1955 @KamalaHarris Maybe all these "government employees," ie middle class welfare recipients, should be required to work on a farm for a few months to see how real life works.  Any farmer knows what I am talking about, but not the Dems....
@karoolatas @RippleZoo Yes, CO2 is a massive benefit to planet.  The reason to use NH3 is it could be made from house solar cheaper than oil.  My engine can use 6 fuels (gasoline, Diesel, E85, Jet A, 100LL, Propane) and NH3.  Also with add on for house it can use Nat Gas (CH4) or with 3600 psi tanks.
@loribaas10 @EcoSenseNow Or maybe they all be arrested and charged with treason....  My engine solves CO2.  Use NH3...zero carbon.  Engine can run on 6 other fuels.  Make NH3 via grid or house solar.  100% zero carbon is quickly possible at LOWER cost than oil is now.

This would allow 30 gallons volume, which would be like 10 gal gasoline in NH3 equivalent.  At 100 mpge that =1000 mile range on NH3.

My engine MUST have a "propane" tank as part of the system anyways, and gasoline/Diesel are stored in tank via car transfer pump.

NH3=416grams/kw-hr vs grid = 454 g/kw-hr.  Making NH3 from house solar THERMAL via my engine should be &lt;$2/gal equivalent to gasoline.  At this point, NH3 looks like the future.  My engine can use any 6 fuels+NH3.

The problem is old cars are 20% highway, 10% city efficient, whereas my new engine will be 60-75%.  The increased economy makes range not an issue.  Also converting old cars would be expensive, but new engine could drop in.
@johncardillo Just having such a conflict should void out anything Mueller does.  Insanity.
@AnnCoulter Ann, knock it off.  You don't help Trump or yourself.  Wake up.
@StopTheseThings @elonmusk BTW, since that comment, I have discovered how to get to zero carbon much faster than anything @elonmusk has.  NH3 in my engine will be 2-8 times less than in costs than anything Musk can offer.  Airplane able, unlike electrics.
@DisneyKid1955 @KamalaHarris I am not doing government welfare contracts, or large corporate work for fee nonsense.  Private funded (me) and I get paid when it works and not before.  Welcome to the real world.
@A_Milewski @TheAssay All of this is obsolete.  Read my tweets to find out why.  My technology is 2-8 times less than an electric car with battery.  Happy to discuss it.  The future is not battery based but NH3 and engines like mine that can power vehicles not possible today.  Buyer beware!
@nelsguvi @KamalaHarris I meant ALL of Congress, House and Senate, Repub and Dem, not just Harris, plus all their staff.  Also, executive branch, cabinet, employees and staff.  Can't do the work, don't get paid.

@kerryb214 @RepMattGaetz The only Russian nonsense was with Hillary, Obama, Mueller and the gang.  Did you just arrive back to Earth from Pluto?
@DisneyKid1955 @KamalaHarris I have the solution to energy and getting to zero carbon.  I am an engineer and do R&amp;D on engine technology.  When I make the product I get paid, and not before.  BTW, my engine voids any carbon tax nonsense Harris wants to impose.  Read my tweets.  Fastest way to zero carbon.
@nelsguvi @KamalaHarris Sure it does.  BTW, Harris should not be paid too since she and her Dem friends caused this by not coming to a deal.  Can't produce a deal, no pay.  Why should she get paid?  She should not.
@DisneyKid1955 @KamalaHarris I have to work and not get paid until the job is done.  What is the big deal?
@nelsguvi @KamalaHarris The lives of private sector people are irrelevant?  Really?
@KamalaHarris People in the private sector go without a pay check for months sometimes.  Welcome to life.
@pbb119 @USCCB @CardinalDolan Why not Orthodox?  Constantine went to Istanbul (Constantinople), not Rome.  When did the Catholic church start?  751?  Charles Martel, who was excommunication by Pope Leo?  Rome was vacant for 300 years from 450 to 750...  Just curious.
@irshroz Is she some high level Masonic Madam or something?  Who is backing her?  She is a wreck and must resign.
@JoePolish And what was it?  Stuff happens?

@LoomerFanClub @POTUS Laura, BOTH parents MUST be citizens at time of birth otherwise that person has a way to jump ship to another country after they screw the USA over.  Obama could jump to Kenya if his dad was Kenyan.  NOT valid.  Second generation ONLY, NOT first gen.  Also born on land.
@SenSanders If you want to get to zero carbon, my engine system is the only real way to do it cost effectively.  Read my tweets and get informed.  Your information is very outdated and just wrong.  Wind and PV will NOT work.  My technology will.  Happy to discuss it....&gt;
@Brought_to_You Does not matter, my engine system can get us to zero carbon (NH3) in cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, houses, factories and more.  100% carbon out, not because of CO2 but because it will be CHEAPER and independent from oil.  No government work needed except to GET OUT OF WAY!
This step by step process starts with people who have money and eventually works down to lower cost apartments where the landlord supplies fuel to tenants and all cars have new engine and low cost energy.  No scam is needed like with wind/PV solar nonsense.  Just lower costs.
As the savings become real, customers then can look to MORE savings by  purchasing solar panels, and then a NH3 fuel maker.  They see they can use NH3  in car, airplane, boat or house and thus become 100% independent from grid or station fuels.  NH3 then becomes a standard fuel.
The engine allows carbon fuels that now exist and NH3 that could exist in the future.  A NH3 maker COSTS MONEY and therefore requires MORE investment  This investment is enabled by the immediate savings via the engine and can be paid for from those savings.....&gt;
When a building needs heat, it produces electricity, and the waste heat is used or stored for use in the building.  This makes electricity 100% efficient to generate where as now it is 45-60% due to lost waste heat.  Over time we move to NH3 from made NH3 used in house engines.
The reason power is made away from a building is that old piston engines were not efficient enough and turbines were much to big (2000 HP+).  With my engine, this all changes, making combined heat and power viable via Natural Gas which is totally clean.  It is also quiet.
All power to a building should be made at the building to use the waste heat.  By adding in solar, fuel would be used less during sunny days.  By adding in solar thermal store, most of the fuel would be eliminated.  Fuel as back up. 24/7-360 power.  Then NH3 to replace CH4.
If you put the engine in houses/factories/office buildings and only run it off of Natural Gas, for example, you would save the 40-55% by having "combined heat and power.  Short term turbines are 45%.  Combined cycle (slow base load) are 60%.  You would save the waste heat.
@pbb119 @USCCB @CardinalDolan How many hints does one need before you jump ship from the Titanic called the Catholic church?  A Bishop should be the husband of one wife...so he does not become a pedo or crazy sex freak....
@FrankLuntz Frank, why don't you look at other types of health care.  family of 8 for $400/m, 5% med costs, and doc visit included, as well as minor surgeries.  Surgery center of Oklahoma is one such place.  Individual...$50/m.  This junk Bernie sells is insane.
@FiveRights @realDonaldTrump May?  No, certain he needs to scrap it.
@AnnCoulter No, deport 22 million and put a cork in Kushner's mouth.
Houses and factories is where 50% of CO2 is made.  By having engine in house and factory, the grid will cut CO2 via grid contracts.  Add in solar, solar thermal storage, and then NH3 maker and you get to 100% carbon ASAP.  Not so with wind and PV via electric cars.
With lots of people switching to my engine, you get an immediate 70-80% reduction in CO2 by virtue of the engine alone.  If an entire new car were made that got 200 mpg (possible) then 80-90% of the fuel would be gone.  In semi trucks 50-65% gone.  This then moves to house....&gt;
By NOT having carbon taxes, the path to zero carbon is downhill all the way.  Start with my engine.  The person gets 75% off fuel costs to drive places via extra efficiency.  He then invests in house fuel maker, solar and engine for house to become independent.  Then station....&gt;
Simple math.  Guy uses gasoline car.  25 mpg.  New engine in car.  100 mpg.  4:1.  He uses gasoline and cuts his bill by 75%.  Car can also use Propane or NH3, but both are more expensive now and rare to find.  Over time NH3 become available from house, station, then airport.
To get to NH3 you need a way to use it.  My engine is that way.  But until NH3 is available, the engine MUST use other fuels from the three sources of fueling: 1) house, 2) station, 3) airport.  Until enough engines can use NH3, nobody will supply NH3.  Chicken and egg problem.
Remember, if you jack the cost of carbon fuels up via taxes, you will LENGTHEN the time it takes to get to zero carbon, NOT shorten the time.  Why?  Because it takes away the savings of new engine (4x less costs) which then slows the market for NH3 as option.  Understand?
Not sure why this is SOOOOO hard for people to understand.  NH3 will be the fuel of the future IF (and only if) it is cheaper than carbon fuels.  Can it be?  100% yes.  Will it?  Not unless you get something like what I am proposing.  Real cost of wind and PV is not valid for NH3 https://t.co/sJOrExmnAN

My engine can get us ALL to zero CO2 via NH3 (no carbon in N...H3...get it?)  This requires several things, all of which is much cheaper than current wind and PV panels.  Happy to discuss it, but CO2 is irrelevant
@RealBoomBoomPow @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Ok, deport all DACAs now....
@lenaparon @GretaThunberg Stop the insane nonsense.  Want to get to zero carbon?  READ MY TWEETs.  Wind and Solar PV will NOT work.  My engine system will.  Stop being useful idiots.
@sheriran95 No, it has problem because they are crazy socialists who murder and steal property.
As for gears, my engine only needs a high/low/reverse gears, and this is a simple planetary gear set (single).  On the wing, no gear is needed unless the prop speed needs to be changed to another speed.  All saves weight!   Nikoloas H2 truck uses two speeds too, btw.
Started went out on my van yesterday.  My new engine system does not need a starter.  Serious.  Starter means you don't have a correct design.  Why?  All the weight of starter is gone.  Electric cars don't need a starter and neither does my IC engine system.  Discuss?
@RippleZoo I have a solution to get to zero carbon in house, cars, airplane, boats, factories and more.  Why keep up this fraud?  If you want zero carbon, then you have a discussion and we go from there.  Understand?  No carbon tax will work.  My technology unplugs it.
@HenryMakow Jesuits control freemasons at the top.
@FreightWaves My engine can cut fuel use by 50% and use lower cost fuels....about 40-50 cents/mile less costs.  This will allow wages to come up by a lot.
@SPIEGELONLINE Ich habe es. Kein Carbon.   Lesen Sie mein tweets.
@NEI_media @NEI @USEnergyAssn Nuclear to NH3 during high wind and solar days.  NH3 will run cars, trucks and airplanes.  100% carbon free, or still use 6 fuels via my engine.  Carbon or no carbon, my engine solves the problem of energy.
@drwaheeduddin @thegwpfcom @GuidoFawkes Dr Uddin, NH3 is what the AGW will move to.  The excess wind and PV will make NH3 instead of paying to get rid of excess power during day or high wind.  My engine will allow NH3 and thus give zero carbon path, yet still use 6 fossil fuel.
@HLAurora63 Most hated?  No, the most evil.....
@powerthefuture No matter, I have a path to zero carbon for all the cultist who think CO2 is evil.  Those who don't can use any of 6 fossil fuels or NH3, which ever is cheaper.  Her scam is about taxes and control, not CO2.
@Otter_17 @keklumpp @jakethoml @tan123 Ryan, no they did not.  Did you even read it?  All just nonsense.  About 3% agree, and those are bought and paid for.  All just a scam.  That said, I have the solution to get us to zero carbon.  No need for carbon taxes....game over.
@jakethoml @tan123 Jake, this 97% has long ago been debunked.  Wake up and start "educating yourself" as you like to say.  Ignorance is bliss, huh?
@DjLots3 @lilbulli1031 They don't WANT to get it through their heads...
@leftsidestoryUS I have the solution to getting to zero carbon energy.  Read my tweets.  Nothing the Dems have will work.  Happy to discuss it.
@leftsidestoryUS Fake news...
@superyayadize Identifying with any gender says there is one.  They have to be an it, not a she or he.  German has a neutral it "gender" and maybe this "German" influence (read NAZI) is where they get this notion from.
@newsbusters Rick the Dick with a little stick.
@RealJamesWoods If they can kill you INSIDE the womb, what is there to stop them from killing you OUTSIDE the womb?
Why would a H2 or NH3 fuel cell not be the best investment?  If you read my tweets you will get a good idea why they all will fail.  In short, you need lots of things that a fuel cell cannot give you.  My engine will be 2-3 times better than NH3 fuel cell in efficiency, 10 costs.
Funny how the world is going all electric, yet NH3 is the needed element for renewable energy and zero carbon.  Fuel cells?  Sure, make a NH3 fuel cell electric car and try to make it work.  Go ahead, waste billions of $$$.  Wish you luck...you will need it and billions of $$$.
Aw, but you say there are many "new" IC engine on the market.  Really?  Bill Gates spent $200 mil on ecomotors.  Is it new?  NO!  How about Duke engines?  Scuderi group ($75 mil so far)?  List is long.   Why have all failed?  In 5 minutes I could show why all are waste of time.
Since nobody has a new type of IC engine, the focus is now on electric systems.  Why?  They say it is due to efficiency, but my engine will be twice (if not many times more due to weight) as efficient in an airplane when all is fully done.  So, why use electrics?  Discuss?
One would think that with all of these car, truck and airplane companies, someone would come up with a new engine that would meet the needs of the future without having to use electric motors and heavy batteries.  NOPE.  NOT one.  Tried?  Yes.  Failed?  100%. &gt;&gt;&gt;
I started with what I needed in an engine, the characteristics needed, package size, weights and so forth.  Most engineers just apply what is to an application and never do the needed work in discovering the "whys" of the engine.  This is what sets me apart from all others.
If you want to make an advancement in whatever you do, start with the "7 whys" of what you are doing.  The how is the LAST thing to discuss.  Knowing why you do what you do is key to making breakthrough changes that lead to solving energy.  This is where people fail in quest.
People have lost hope in IC engines from a lack of ability to think outside of the box and to understand what is needed.  The most valuable part of this engine development process is the understanding of what is needed, not just the actual engine concept.  Few see this....&gt;
Just as the Jet engine and the Piston engine are different in the structure and processes, my engine is different than both engines.  Why?  Because you can't get to the needed power characteristics with either the old piston engines or the old jet engines.  Won't work.  Key.
You cannot take a piston crank engine and make real advances due to the nature of the system.  You have to create a NEW system that allows the needed elements to be express in the device without all of the negative restrictions found in today's Diesel and Gasoline engines.
As you can see with my few comments here about Diesel and Gasoline engines, there is a LOT of room to advance the internal combustion engine.  In fact I would say we are only 10-20% of the way, whereas my engine is 90%.  Last month it was only 80% of the way (no NH3) back then..&gt;
People don't realize just how much "drag" a gasoline engine has.  Go down a steep hill in low gear and turn around and drive the SAME speed up the hill.  Your engine will struggle to go up as fast as it does go down with only engine drag.  On flat roads that drag is still there.
Perhaps the biggest advantage a Diesel has is in the ability to heavily boost intake pressures with turbos.  This allows a wide range of power, yet a good low power efficiency not found in gasoline engines.  This High boost is where most of the "torque" comes from.
In contrast, a gasoline engine uses a throttle to cut power, which in turn lowers the effective expansion ratio and increases pumping losses, and thus the efficiency.  In part load, this throttle effect can double the fuel consumption.  Hence, 20% highway, 10% city efficiency...&gt;
One of the reasons semi trucks use diesel engine is the part load efficiency of a Diesel is better than that of a gasoline engine.  For ex, a 450 hp semi needs about 250 hp to drive at 65 mph.  At 250 hp the engine is still efficient, but at 75 hp around town the BSFC is 2x....&gt;
Adding fuel as the expansion occurs is NOT as efficient as adding heat in a fixed volume as a gasoline engine theoretically is supposed to do, but it does add an option that allows for efficient running and hard running when needed for short duration.  Duty cycle is key.
One of the reasons a Diesel has "torque" over a gasoline engine is that fuel can be added after the initial combustion, whereas gasoline engine traditionally have one preset mix of air and fuel.  This adding of fuel allows the pressure to be maintained as the expansion occurs.
Moreover, the engine has to be able to have the fuels MIXED and it must be able to adapt to changing fuel types dynamically when fuel separates in the tank and the pick up draws on one type over another.  Fill with one fuel, then later another.  Should not matter.  Key.
Ask why can't current engines use gasoline or Diesel?  There are many reasons, too long for twitter, but until you have an engine that can use any of the common fuels, including propane and NH3, you have an engine that is not adaptive to fuel needs, and therefore NOT VALID....&gt;
@JackPosobiec There is a missing fourth plea that allows you to come before the court in honor and therefore retain the presumption of innocence.  A judge gets pissed if you try it.  I have.  They threaten you.  No lawyer I know of has a clue what is going on in court....
@JackPosobiec Jack, a "defendant" is one who makes a counter claim.  All claims must be proven.  Guilty, not guilty and no contest are pleas of culpability.  Not guilty does NOT mean you are innocent.  By making a plea you say you are culpable and therefore NOT innocent.  Corrupt process....
The path to zero carbon is clear as shown below, and for those who love carbon or use it in greenhouses, this engine can use any of 6 common fossil fuels. This is NOT like a gasoline/Diesel thing where you can only use one fuel.  This engine is able to do fossil fuels and NH3.
@batalysta @bigleaguepol She is NOT eligible at all.  She is an anchor baby.  Both parent need to be citizens at the time of birth and born on the land.  In other words second generation.  There cannot be any other option of citizenship which is offered when on parent is not USA citizen.
Notice the spot price is 20/MW-hr = 2 cents/kw-hr.  This price would make NH3 for $1.35/gal equiv.  Add in some profit and you have fuel for much less than gasoline. https://t.co/aVcnR7QGj6

@GretaThunberg My engine + NH3 maker can get you to 100% zero carbon for house, car, airplane, factory, and more.  Stop complaining.  I have your solution to CO2.  Those that want to use fossil fuel can use them too.  All can agree.
@SonniGilley Maybe he can arrest NP during the speech and make a real show of it.
@lcplcobb @Tesla @elonmusk Electricity is $4/gal equivalent.  (.12 c/kw-hr x 33.7 kw-hr/gal e = $4/gal).  The battery costs $4/gal to use (differed costs).  Super charge is another $4/gal.  Total $8-12/gal.  My new engine will be par to electric in efficiency with $2/gal fuel...  4-6 times MORE for Tesla.
@Newsweek More fake news.  Keep it shut down.  In fact, shut more and more down and find out what is actually needed.  I say 90% can be ejected.

@ABC The comments below are very full of hate.  Ya'all need your meds updated.
@jihadwatchRS The are offended because you use toilet paper...Moslems use water and hand....
@highnoontide @luisbaram No need for wind or PV panels.  My engine plus solar thermal plus NH3 maker can get to 100% zero carbon.  Engine can also use 6 other fuels.  Carbon or no carbon, works with both.  You decide.  see tweets.
Looking for Mechanical Engineers to work on new engine that solves the energy problem.  Can use NH3 or any of 6 fuels.  It enables lots of new crafts (airplanes, cars, boats, house power, etc) not able with jets, turbos or piston cranks.  Can power grid.  Solar power. zero carbon
My engine in car vs electric car with battery will be 2-4 times less, at least.  		Gasoline = $2/gal (no tax) 		Electricity = $4/gal (12 c/kw-hr), 	Battery use = $4/gal	Total $8/gal		Engine efficiencies = electrics system. 		Cost of driving an electric car will be 2-4 times more.
As more and more vehicles get the new engine, the demand for oil will drop by up to 70-80% due only from the efficiency boost via the engine.  A car that got 25 mpg will get 100 mpg and thus 75% of the fuel demand gone.  The price of oil will stay low for many many years....&gt;
@mainvolume Don't understand what you are saying.  What is small.  Put a sock in what?  Please explain.
To get the needed funds to do the R&amp;D for NH3 in airplanes (flying semi trucks), ground semi trucks with new engine will be used.  With a fleet of thousands of trucks with new engine, all the R&amp;D for new roadable seaplanes, small to large, can be funded by ground truck.
The main reason for using gasoline/Diesel/JetA will be longer range and/or availability, which will be mostly an issue for airplanes stuck at the airport (not roadable) where no NH3 exists. FAA Certification for NH3 in airplanes will be a major blocker in the adoption of NH3.
Once volume demand for NH3 exists and enough engines can use it, then the price drops below gasoline or Diesel per energy and most people use NH3 due to LOWER COSTS.  As NH3 become available everywhere, fewer and fewer people will want gasoline/Diesel/E85/Propane/JetA/100LL.
Once NH3 from CH4 is made available for general use, and many applications use engine, solar making of NH3 can start both from the house/factory and from existing grid wind/PV panels.  NH3 from renewables then replaces NH3 from CH4 (Natural Gas).  People then switch to NH3...&gt;
NH3 via CH4 has &lt; Carbon/kw-hr than grid (416 vs 454 g/kw-hr).  If used with new engine that is = to electric cars in energy efficiency, it is less carbon/mile than a battery-electric car.  The cost/kw-hr is 3/4th what electricity from grid is.  Lower carbon and lower costs!
Once the engine is out and used in many applications (cars, trucks, airplanes, boats, houses, factories) then NH3 as a fuel via Haber-Bosch process using Nat Gas is made available.  Cost &lt; $3/gal e.  Carbon/kw-hr is LESS than grid to battery electric car...Checkmate.
At the start of the journey to NH3 (zero carbon), many fuels are needed to allow the engine to fuel from house, station, or airport.  This gets the engine into the market which then allows a demand for NH3 to exist.  NH3 from CH4 is then used as fuel to quickly allow NH3 use.
To get to zero carbon with NH3 the engine must be able to use many fuels when NH3 is not available.  Without this ability, the engine will be very limited in use and NH3 will not take hold.  		The three fuel areas are:  1) house/factory, 2) fuel station, and 3) airport.  All key.
Notice below that wind and PV panels and NOT needed, but can help in making NH3 if they have already been bought (at high price!).  No need to buy more and waste money....  		The investment going forward is on houses, factories, barns, and anywhere solar thermal is easy.
How to get to 100% zero carbon!		1) New engine + generator able to combust NH3 at 60-75% + use solar thermal 	2) Solar thermal panels + storage (hot water) large enough for needs	3) NH3 maker + storage tanks for NH3	4) New engine in cars, airplane, trucks, houses, factories, etc.

A bet by Dr. Moore.  Will CO2 be higher in 2025 or not.  https://t.co/S4mAqHfFzX
@Alyssa_Milano The only hood is the one pulled over your eyes.  Wake up.
@yota_berlin The solution is to make NH3.  My engine is designed to use NH3 at 60-75% efficiency making it better than an electric car in CO2.  Grid (USA) is 454 g/kw-hr.  Making NH3 from CH4 is 416.  Making it from wind mill is around 20 or so.  My engine can allow 100% zero carbon.
They are paying to turn off the wind mills.  Instead of paying, make NH3.  Soon people will realize that making NH3 is the future.  Batteries cannot hold the needed energy, but NH3 can.  No need to turn off wind mills other than to save birds... https://t.co/Uie0FI9Qm9
@Aspiration My engine can get you to 100% zero carbon for power.  Interesting in discussion?
@leftsidestoryUS Then they all need my engine technology that can get 100% of the carbon out of their house, cars and airplane fuel needs via solar power made NH3.  Wind mills and PV panels will not work.
@Devonrocks1 My engine using carbon fuels as back up and solar thermal to use green house space would make a nice combination.
@GizaDog They all need to go to jail.
@OpenSociety Soros, your carbon tax nonsense won't work.  Have solution to energy.  game over.

My engine can use NH3...no carbon.  Nh3 is made via solar thermal, engine and fuel maker.  100% carbon free.  Engine can run also with 6 carbon fuels for those who know CO2 is a benefit to the planet.  Both sides can use engine....win win
@TheGreatFeather @Doodisgirl An women to be women....
@HenryK_B_ @INL Yes, wind and PV panel won't work.  My engine technology will, 24/7, and allows NH3 for 100% carbon free, as well as 6 carbon fuels for those who think CO2 is a benefit to the planet.  Win-Win.  Grid able.
@KokeReport Islam is a totalitarian tool.
@cosmotechweb Wind and PVs will NOT work.  My engine systems will.  The future of energy is not what you think....  Happy to discuss it.
@leftsidestoryUS Left side, my engine (or similar) is really your only option.  Wind and PV can't get you to 100% zero carbon.  My technology can.  You can complain, or you can work with me.  Your choice.  No carbon taxes will work.  NH3 has no carbon....
@jpr1706 Jon,  there is no need for government funding of any "green" energy nonsense.  My technology is the best way to zero carbon, bar none.  Read my tweets.  Stop complaining.  Wind and PV panels can't get you to zero carbon.  My technology can.  Want to discuss?  Or just complain?
@Rosko311 I think trucks is where this can all be funded without venture capital and loss of control/ownership.  Access to the technology is the right to make money via trucks or other....  Trucks then fund airplane development...Billions....  Want to get to flying semi.  Read tweets....
@Rosko311 Lots of ways to compensate them AFTER the engine is working.  I tweeted about it many times.  For example, 1 semi truck with old Diesel out and new engine in could make around $100k/year net on $70k investment (glider+new engine).  10 years...930k.  Overhaul...950k more.
@Rosko311 I am looking for a team.  I am a mechanical engineer and use Solidworks (1 seat).  2 more Mech engineers would be nice.  Cad would also help.  Need to be able to work with them closely...difficult to find right people who can think out of box and create.
To do my roadable airplane "correctly" I need my new engine.  This is my primary and initial motive for this engine.  It just so happens this engine can "solve" energy problems too.  Funny how that works.  Guy wants to make cool seaplane...solves energy...who would have thought?
@stephen_taylor Tell Trudeau I have the solution to his "climate Change" problem and both sides can agree.  Happy to discuss the future of energy, which will not include a carbon tax because there won't be any carbon....NH3.  Stop the fear porn.  Energy will be cheap for all....
Look folks, with my engine technology and similar (I ain't the only guy with a brain bigger than a pea), the world will change for the better in a very dramatic way, as profound as the Wright brothers, jet engine, light bulb and computer.  This engine enables what cannot be now.
I also find it fascinating that people can't see that energy and my engine technology is many times bigger in a potential business model than anything in computers or internet by at least 10 times, yet they are not interested.  They won't even ask serious questions.  Why? Asleep?
I find it fascinating that people complain about "global warming" or "climate change" and when I offer them a clear path to solve their problem at lower cost than current technology, they don't even bother to discuss it or even ask a question or two.  NOT INTERESTED!  What gives?
@Rosko311 Yes, and if you figure out a better way to do it during the R&amp;D, that patent can be made obsolete.  Total waste.  The airplane in my avitar picture on twitter had a patent that cost a lot of $$$.  I figured out how to make it obsolete.  I patent when ready, not before.
Is there a lobby group who goes around demanding people use cell phones instead of land lines?  Why not?  Because cell phones offer more for less.  If my engine offers more for less then would I need a lobby?  NO!  Why then do "renewable" energy companies lobby?  Bad technology.
If NH3 can be made for $2/gal e and my engine in car gives 2x to an electric car (200 mpge vs 100 mpge), the electric car will be 4 times more expensive with $4/gal electricity.  Add in cold/hot weather factor of 2x city and you have 8x more for an electric vs my engine in city.
The central problem now is that NH3 burned in a Otto/Diesel engine would be a waste.  The efficiencies are not high enough.  My engine is.  60-75% vs 10-20%.  My engine makes NH3 valid for range and costs compared to electric cars by 2-4 times better.  Key.
Some people think that batteries will be enough to store excess energy for night and cloudy/calm days.  This is not even remotely possible considering the world population and reality of weather.  My engine can be stand alone (island) and still work, yet still be grid valid.
@Rosko311 I am looking for people to help me get it all done faster.  Lots of engineering work for one guy.  I don't have patents, so a video showing it may void patent rights and thus investors.  Grey area....  I use twitter as a log to remember how things progress, and to find people.
To truly make renewable energy work you must have excess capacity to gather all the energy possible and store excess to sustain the grid/house during times when renewables are not available. NH3 will be the future of energy store.  Vehicles will then use NH3 for 100% zero carbon
With an electric battery based car, you have one choice of "fuel" ... Electricity.  They can't use the many types of fuels available (Gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, E85, Propane) nor can an electric car use NH3 which is how renewable energy will be stored in the future.
@Rosko311 New type...very different...  Old Otto/Diesel engines can't burn NH3 well due to NOx issues.  Peak temps are much too high.  My engine solves this and many other problems with old engines.  It is "distributed" in nature, allow lots of motor to act as one...drone, for example.
What is lacking in the anti CO2 global warming movement is a technology that allows both sides to use one type of technology.  My engine is this key.  If you want zero carbon, then use NH3.  If you love carbon, use 6 different fuels.  Both people can buy the engine and win...
If you want to get to zero carbon (NH3) you need a bridge via fossil fuels until NH3 is at most fuel stations, houses, factories and airports.  Until NH3 is widely available, the chicken and egg problem exists.  My engine solves this, allowing 6 fuels and NH3.  Key to zero carbon
@WYeates They need my engine, which actually CLEANS the air....
@EcoSenseNow They could fly in my seaplane using NH3 and make zero carbon footprint, or use Jet A, Diesel, gasoline, propane, E85, Ethanol, bio diesel and burn about 1/50th the fuel per mile.  Either way, they don't need to be hypocrites.  Besides, my seaplane is roadable door to door.
@DanDorey3 @joegooding @PatriotJenn @jewel_patriot @LolaFor_Trump @Jamierodr10 @Movanhook @ChristieC733 @DonnaWR8 @jjauthor @IamMonicaRae @Lady_Vi_2U Now, that was funny!
@GretaThunberg Greta, my engine solves the CO2 issue via NH3 (Ammonia).  No need to worry.  Energy will be cheap and CO2 is not an issue.  Read my tweets if you want to understand what will actually happen in energy.  Wind and PV panels won't get you to zero carbon, but my engine will.
@Greenpeace My engine technology can get the air cleaner than what came in....  It can also allow NH3, cutting all carbon out and do it for around $2/gal e.  It can run airplanes, cars, trucks, houses, boats, factories and more.  Interested in discussing the future of energy and clean air?
@SasjaBeslik Sasja, my engine is your best hope.  Read my tweets.  Energy is key and with my engine it will get cheaper, eventually leading to NH3 as the fuel where no oil is needed and fuel is made at home.  The engine is key....  Happy to discuss.  This can cut fuel costs by $500 billion/y
@PorscheRaces Fahren in seiner schoensten Form.
@JosephNSanberg @thenation My engine, or similar, is the only way to "save the planet" in reality.  Wind and PV panels just drive the cost of energy up by 2x or more.  My engine will drive costs down and allow independent fuel making (NH3) that is home based.  NO GRID needed, the ultimate independence.
@Newsweek And nobody reads newsweek....
@barmore27 My engine technology will be cheaper than current Otto/Diesel engines and can get to 100% NH3 economy via fuel maker and solar thermal for about $2/gal equiv to gasoline.  Can run airplanes, trucks, cars, boats, houses, factories, and more.  Can use 6 carbon fuels too.
@VoiceOverPerson ICE NEEDS my roadable airplane technology.  Land on road in 50 feet.  fly 300 mph if need be.  Point to point for 1/50th the cost of helicopter.  Catch them and fly them south, drop off.
@powerthefuture My engine system is the solution.  Can use NH3, and 6 other fuels.  Add in NH3 fuel maker (exists now) and you can have fuel for around $2-3.4/gal equivalent to gasoline.  Solar thermal to engine...to make electricity to make NH3.  100% zero carbon.  Car, airplane, trucks, houses
@spoilsportsmcm @JacobAWohl Both Dems and Repubs work for the same bosses, just different roles.
@RealMattCouch It is just a scam.
@GT_Initiative I have a 100% solution to your carbon fears.  New engine and NH3.  NH3 made by engine and solar thermal.  100% zero carbon for cars, airplanes, trucks, factories and more.  Very doable, but not with the current junk called "renewable" energy.  Won't work.  btw 100% capitalist.
@AOCpress Press release:  Have solution to CARBON.  My engine + NH3.  NH3 made via my engine and solar.  Less cost than wind and PV panels.  Can run in all vehicles, houses, factories and more.  No need for government action at all.  Just free market funding to get it done faster.
@JacobAWohl Both parents MUST be cititzens at time of birth and born on the land.  She may be born in CA, but NOT from citizen parents as Jacob Howell clearly stated in the drafting of the 14th.  NO alien birth right....
@Reconda41 @JacobAWohl Ted Cruz is 100% NOT eligible, and he should know as a lawyer.
@JacobAWohl She is 100% not eligible to run.  It should be a criminal act of fraud to knowingly run when not eligible.
@ouchinagirl @FoxNews @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Nobody with her mental issues should be anywhere near government let alone Speaker of the House.  There has to be a ton of NSA dirt on her to lock her up forever....
@superyayadize @SenSanders Bernie is the racist.  There, I said it.  Group politics is likely racist, not always, but usually.  Individual politics can't be racist because it is not part of a group.
Fuel cells are also full of problems and require buffering via batteries to allow peak power to motors.  You see this in the Nikolos semi truck that uses H2 fuel cells.  The fuel cell becomes a low power battery charger with all the negative issues found in battery systems.
The reason we use "hybrids" is because an electric motor needs one type of "fuel" (electricity) and in a narrow spec.  It cannot use the 6 types of fuel now used in transportation, nor NH3.  To get to NH3 a bridge is needed allowing any fuel, thus eliminating range anxiety.
The big problem with using electrics and fuel cells with NH3 is the purity of the fuel needed and singularity.  A NH3 fuel cell cannot use all types of fuels found in house (propane, Nat Gas, NH3), fuel station (gasoline, Diesel, propane, E85), or airport (Jet fuel, 100 LL).
@ALIATISFUND Instead of turning off the renewables to maintain grid voltage and frequency, the NH3 makers absorb excess, thus becoming the "throttle" of the grid.  This NH3 then can be used in mobile apps.  My engine enables NH3 much better than old Otto engines due to 3x range and features.
@ALIATISFUND Yes, correct, it does NOW, but there is a way to make NH3 via electricity.  The idea is to make NH3 with excess wind and solar during times of over production by renewables and store it in NH3 to be used when batteries run out (short time) and renewables are lacking during night.
What is the cost of a battery driven car over my technology?  Around  8-16 times. In an airplane?  50-100 times more....  Weight is key in the air.  Useful load fraction is terrible for battery driven vehicles, and NO active drag reduction or deice for free.  Future is flying!
@signup55765001 @RealSaavedra Speaking of sheep, CO2 cannot effect temperature because the attenuation of IR is not complete....  In other words, a gate half open cannot trap half the sheep.  The theory was said by Fourier in 1820 to be wrong and is still wrong becuase "the gate of IR is half open to space."
Sure, you can run a car on a battery, but at what costs?  The main cost is the battery and the extra weight.  Also, electrics don't work on air like my engine will/does, nor does it do thermal as by product (free).  This is key to 2-4 times better economy over battery few see.
An accumulator does NOT supply continuous power, just like a battery does not.  It is a spring that allows time for the engine to start up and supply the large power needed.  It allows instant response for small amounts, but not continuous supply.  Understand? Key concept.
A battery is like having an "accumulator" in a hydraulic circuit.  It allows a small amount of energy to be ready without having to run the engine/pump with all the overhead.  The accumulator gives the instant response ability while waiting and allows the engine to be turned off.
Although a battery will cost you $4/gal to use it, it makes sense if you only need a small and constant amount to run efficient electronics that use very little energy.  The mistake is in assuming ALL energy should travel via the battery because electronics use it.  Not wise.
There is a place for batteries, so don't misunderstand.  They are best when the power is below 1 kw or where the engine becomes inefficient.  Charging a cell phone via larger battery is better than running engine due to the small amount needed.  This is where people get lost....
Again, what is the cost of electricity at noon on a clear sky day?  ZERO? You have to PAY to get rid of it if you don't have a way to store it.  NH3 is the "battery" of the future, not LI-ion.  Current LI-ion is twice the cost per unit energy store.  So why bother?
In any truly market based economy, when the supply is large, the price drops.  When wind, PV panels and Nuclear all conspire together, they will need to make NH3 to be cost effective.  When houses makes NH3, this then will drive the cost of NH3 to less than $1-2/gal e or less.
The key to getting off oil is to use the renewables ALL the time.  This will be done via NH3, which will then be used in my engine (or similar).  My engine will allow 2-4 times BETTER fuel economy than an electric car and thus best use of renewables by far.  Energy cost &gt; 0.
Since NH3 will be the fuel of the future to bridge when renewable don't work, it will require the use of fuel cells, combustion turbines or engines of some kind.  My engine eliminates the need for multiple systems.  Understand?  This is key to lower costs.  One system, not 2-4.
In order for the grid to function in the future it will need to make NH3 to bridge when renewables are not available.  Batteries will NOT be enough.  The excess power during high renewable production periods will be converted into NH3 and used in combustion.  Understand?  KEY.
When someone advocates wind and PV panel renewable energy, they are screaming that it does not work.   $Trillions have been spent on wind and PV panels and they are still MORE expensive with volume.  This tells you they are NOT the correct solution.  My technology will be less $.
You know the path to zero carbon is correct when it costs LESS than current technologies, NOT MORE.  Wind and PV panels COST MORE and thus need government FORCE to exist.  My engine technology will cost LESS, and thus the move to zero carbon will be easy, fast and without force.
Even just a month ago, I did not realize fully how to get to zero carbon or zero oil.  Now I see a clear path.  The reason I have to get to zero oil for cars, airplanes, and house is to save money and be independent, NOT to lower Human  produced CO2.  More CO2 is a good thing.
@4TimesAYear @wattsupwiththat I am working on her solution to CO2, but she does not really want a solution.  She wants to tax us all at 70% to fund her grand lifestyle.  When people realize just how simple it is to get off oil, they will laugh at our arrogance and ignorance.  Less cost than current....
@ALIATISFUND My engine technology is the best way to lower energy costs and if zero CO2 is your thing, it is the best way to zero carbon.  Electric cars can't do it.  NH3 is the future....
@nticomuna My engine is combustion and solar thermal, and can work on NH3 (no carbon...).  It is also 1/10th the cost of electric cars and 2-4 times better "fuel" economy.  Works in airplanes, car, trucks, houses and more.  VW will go bankrupt....
@JKSteinberger My engine technology can get us all to 100% carbon free at less than current technology, which wind and PV panels cannot.  Works in airplanes, cars, trucks, houses, building and more.  No worries.  Interested in helping?  read tweets....
@VisitAbuDhabi I start by making an engine that eliminates the need for oil, thus unplugging Dubai and the crazy people who rule it.  CO2 is a good thing, but using oil that funds terrorist is not a good thing.  My engine technology solves terrorist funding.  Now you know....
Paul, I have new technology that will solve her problem of CO2.  New engine that can run on many fuels including NH3 (NO CARBON!) and solar thermal.  If you think CO2 is evil, then use NH3 via renewables.  If not, use gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, Propane, etc  No worries... https://t.co/yBiNewS9Ot
Ladies and gentlemen, whether you want low cost travel or to save the world from CO2, MY ENGINE solves the problem.  The world is wasting  $trillions on fuel it does not need to spend.  Why continue when someone  has the solution?  Interested in helping solve a LOT of problems?
Could it be this easy to stave of WWIII?  Build my engine, solve energy and no third (fourth) World War?  No carbon tax needed (no french revolution), no oil backed dollar, no funding of terrorists via OIL....  Low cost energy for all. https://t.co/jb64Hoz2AJ
@RealMattCouch Wow, I did not know designing a new engine and some solar stuff is like fighting WWII....  Some say that had Britain funded Frank Whittle in developing the first jet engine 8 years before they did, WWII would not have happened.  Maybe if I get funding WWIII won't happen....
@JWSpry Got deleted.  What was the motive?  UN taxes?
Real solutions for Cancer are NEW and therefore experimental and full of R&amp;D.  The same applies to solving energy.  Lots of things have been tried, but not what I propose.  One would think Alarmists would want to look at new solutions, but they don't.  Sad but true.
In cancer treatments there are the "standard" methods such as Kemo therapy, surgery and so forth.  Then there are "alternative" methods that are not sanctioned by the FDA or approved by the AMA, as well as "experimental" drugs.  My engine is not "FDA" approved for zero carbon...
@Cheekie368 My dad had brain cancer.  Discovered in June, dead in December.  (1994)  One would think that if Climate change Alarmists were serious, they would want to know of "alternative" solutions, especially if cost effective, just like cancer patients do.  Sadly, not one is interested.
If you had cancer and would die in x number of years, would you not want to know how to cure your cancer?  Would you not want to know as much about it as possible?  Or would you just give up and die?  What gives?
If someone said that they have the solution to your most pressing problem, would you not want to know about it?  Would you not want to at least ask some questions?  NOPE, not with Climate Alarmists.  They don't want solutions.  They want taxes and control.
I find it interesting that NOT ONE Climate Alarmist has ever asked serious questions about my technology.  NOT ONE.  Telling.  When someone says they have your life's fondest dreams, you might want to at least ask some quality questions if you are honest in what you say.  Right?
If @RepAOC  (Alexandria OCASIO-CORTEZ) thinks that we are done in 12 years if we don't address climate change, then she and her friends need to fund my engine.  I know of no other way to get to 100% carbon free living for house, cars and airplanes.  https://t.co/PfvEsLGgce
@AOC If you think the world will end in 12 years due to climate change, then you need to read my tweets.  I have the way to get 100% of the carbon out of the average person's life.  If this does not interest you, then you are not serious....

@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS This is why they can bankrupt @GenFlynn and so many others and use the courts as weapons.

@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS The entire process of a court is a sorry joke of dishonor.  		Dishonor (left hand) - Honor (right hand).  Each MUST have two pleas.  	Guilty/not guilty -defendant , must prove claim as counter claimant.	no contest/ accept claim on condition they prove it.  Honor is retained.
@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS Take the pleas in a court, for example.  In a system of opposites, only an even number of pleas are possible, but there are 3 pleas.  Should be 4.  Why?  Guilty, not guilty and no contest are ALL pleas of culpability.  Where is a plea of innocents?  Fourth pleas?  Missing.....
@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS Lawyers are taught useless opinions of judges, not actual Canon of law which trumps any case law.  90% of law school is a waste of time.  There are about 2500 canons that apply.  Easy to learn, but not case law.  Few lawyers know much law at all.
@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS Yes, it must be first principals and original intent, not precedents of a corrupted and extorted opinion of a judge.  This is why we had slavery.  A Judge in 1640 ruled that John Punch would get life time servitude (slavery) instead of 7 more years of service like the white guys.
@VileGoat @KAFosterSowell @RationalPlank @GIJoeOPS Locnar, yes, perfect example of wrong interpretation that then destroys the USA.  How is it that since 1868 only fools have reigned in law who can't read what the original intent was.  Why?  Because the BAR is a criminal enterprise to destroy the USA.
@RationalPlank @KAFosterSowell @GIJoeOPS No, wrong again.  This is the problem with the "legal" system.  Corruption is at the core.  Opinion is a control grid, not law.  There is no "stare decisi" and until this changes, no justice will be afforded..
@RationalPlank @KAFosterSowell @GIJoeOPS Case law is not law.  If you state case in court, a smart lawyer can toss out any reference of a case as another case does not apply in the case at hand.  Case is the ruling of judges, which is NOT law.  It is the opinion of law, big difference.  Only the fact in case matter.
@RationalPlank @KAFosterSowell @GIJoeOPS What type or area of law?

As you can clearly see below, there is a clear path to zero carbon via my engine.  Along that path, my engine will be lower carbon than an electric car if the person wants to. With solar thermal + engine to house + NH3 maker, a person can get to 100% zero carbon for cars + house.

New design compared to old car on NH3:		Old car 4 x fuel over old car with new engine.	Old car 8x fuel over new design with new engine.	City economy is 2x for new due to constant efficiency, same for old	8x2=16	Old car 16x to new car in city driving.  		It adds up!
During hot summers and cold winters, the new design with new engine would be four times as efficient as an electric car.		2x due to lower weight and active drag	2x due to free heating/cooling		2x2=4.  		New design with new engine = 1/4 CO2 of electric car in hot/cold weather.
With a new car design and new engine, the fuel economy could be twice what an electric car gets.  This is from active drag reduction and much lower weight without battery.		Therefore, my solution is 1/2 the CO2 of an electric car.		200 mpg e on NH3 = 1/2 CO2 of grid electric car.
NH3 from CH4 (Natural Gas) takes 416 g CO2/kw-hr equivalent in NH3.  	Grid at 2017 ratios is 454 g CO2/Kw-hr.  		My car at 100 mpge = electric car at 100 mpg e.	My car on NH3 &lt; CO2 than Electric car on grid electricity.	My car on my solar &lt; CO2 than Electric car on PV solar

@marsialynn86 @LadyRedWave My tweets are about solving energy....$500 billion/year.  10 x Apple, Google, MS, etc combined.  There is nothing greater.
@LadyRedWave What do you do to get 75k followers?
If you add in taxes.... 	gasoline $2.45	NH3 $3.45		2.45/3.45 x 4 =2.84		Remember, electricity is $4/gal, which is MORE than $3 and $3.45, and they don't have a $4/gal battery bill that comes due in 5-10 years.  Less Carbon than grid, less money by less than 1/2 in reality... hmm.
So by buying a car with my engine in it (switch out old, put in new, not totally new), you get 4x better mileage, 25 mpg to 100 mpg.  If NH3 is $3/gal and gasoline $2, the numbers are 2/3 x 4 = 2.66 times better than old car on gasoline.  A true believer would go for it, right?

One caveat....it makes less CO2 if my engine is par or better to an electric car, which my engine will be around 2-4 times better in reality.  Old piston engines would make ~ 4 times MORE CO2 than an electric car.  This won't work with old engines, but will with my engine by 8:1.
So, it currently makes LESS CO2 to use NH3 than to use grid electricity.  		Who would have thought???  Hmmm.  		Since NH3 is $3/gal e ($1/gal NH3) via Nat Gas, this could be an alternate in the minds of some AGWs since it is less than grid.  It seems the numbers are lining up....
Which produces more CO2?  		Grid electricity 		or 		NH3 made from Natural Gas?  		Grid = 454 g/kw-h	NH3 = 416 g/kw-h		(USA is 2.129 tons CO2/ton NH3 x 2.2 lbs/kg x 459g/lbs x kg NH3/5.166 kw-hr =416 g/kw-h)	https://t.co/6oWZmauFYL
On the margin, electricity for electric car is $3-5/gal e when you don't count battery....  This sets the floor at $3/gal for electric cars and NH3/gal equiv to gasoline, or $1/gal NH3, which so happens to be the farmer's price!  Hmmm.
With electricity at $4/gal (12 c/kwh) and battery use at $4/gal, the electric car price signal is at $4-8/gal depending on whether the owner counts the battery or not.  Usually they don't, so the margin is $4/gal.  Actually 9-15 c/kwh is the zone.....$3-5/gal.  NH3 &lt; $3 then....&gt;

Correct?
If my engine and solar can make NH3 for $2/gal, would there not be some who go into business MAKING NH3 and selling it to neighbors or the local fuel station?  A coop for local NH3 makers?  The exact floor is hard to know without hard costs, but a floor around $2-3/gal is clear.
The real question is:  If a AGW believer buys my car and has a choice of NH3 at $4/gal or gasoline at $2/gal (current price), which will that person buy?  The AGW Hypocrite would buy the gasoline, and purist the NH3 (certified renewable, of course).  What do you think?
Say grid wind, solar and nuclear NH3 sources have a cost of 5 c/kwh.  2x is 10 = $3.37/gal e plus 15% marketing = $4/gal.  If a person can buy home based system and do it for $2/gal, then what will happen?  More and more people will be independent of the grid and use NH3.
If the cost of making NH3 stays high due to high wind and solar maintenance costs, and Carbon fuels stay low (to not be phased out), then there has to be other factors that drive people to want to use NH3.  Home based units will then come on line and the grid will collapse.
What will happen in a market system is wind will be able to make more at night when solar is not running and will then make NH3 when both solar and wind are producing too much.  But if costs to run wind are higher than price of NH3 plus fees, this will not work long term.
The real question is: what is the true cost of keeping a wind mills  running indefinitely.  If the blades have a life cycle, they will all go  belly up soon enough. The ramp up of house solar with my engine and NH3  will take some time, and will keep NH3 and Oil prices low.

@verum_regnat @SteveSGoddard Potholes is trying to say he is an idiot....
Without the ability to use other fuels, the price of NH3 will be all over the place and making a car dependent on NH3 alone would make costs very unstable.  The same would apply to electric cars if we had market electricity prices every minute changing.  My engine is key to this.
Just as the price of Propane goes up in the winter and down the lowest in August, the price of NH3 will go up and down depending on the supply from renewable sources.  This will take time to develop a stable markets for NH3.  My engine's ability to use other fuels will be key.
The cost of NH3 production will drive the price of the floor of electricity costs.  If a catalyst is found that allows 10% energy to make NH3 instead of 100%, this will change the floor price of electricity.  This will change during seasons, just like the price of corn does.
In essence, the real throttle to the grid will be NH3 production that turns on when the price of electricity drops below some cost determined by the supplier.  Excess wind and solar then makes NH3 when prices drop below around 3 cent/kw-hr, or some price as a function of NH3 cost
What if wind and solar are at the max during the day, what does the nuclear power plant do?  Who takes priority?  Wind?  Solar?  Nuclear?  and at what price?  Positive or negative?  Who decides?  Have to be fair, right?  How?  How do you get your investment back?  Hence, NH3.
In a market based grid, during the day with lots of solar, the price of electricity will drop.  At some point solar will have to be shut off, but who gets turned off and what is the price of electricity during the day with excess capacity?  Welcome to the future grid reality.
With demand during the day being met in excess by PV panels, the electricity during the night will have to rely on turbines, wind and other sources.  Price of night electricity could go way up, exactly when cars  are being charged.  Going to get expensive!
@Neumie77 @FMGhost09 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Putin has pregnant daughter married to Russian.  She flies over to USA, drops kid.  Kid USA citizen.  Both parents Russian.  Kid is elected USA president.  Kid is also Russian citizen. A Russian controls USA.  Any idiot can see such an interpretation is brain dead.
The underlying problem is who is allowed to produce and make money?  In a market the lowest cost provider supplies the product, but the grid is NOT done this way now, but soon will have to be.  With so many houses using their PV panels for electricity during the day, demand zero.
When you have more supply than demand, the price goes to zero, but how to shut off supply when it is not wanted?  You go to negative pricing!  Those machines (nuclear) who can't shut off will be charged more negative rates as PV panels start to feel the pain and turn off.
What will happen to solar when there is a 5 minute bid and ask pricing for electricity during the day, or even a 1 minute or 10 second price?  The bid and ask becomes the throttle of the grid, turning on and off machines according to set points a suppler is willing to produce at.
One of the reasons we have such a mess on the grid now is that there are no price signals that reflect the true cost of electricity during the day relative to supply.  Supply and demand is NOT market based, but contract based, which forces distortions of use.  This will change.
One of the problems with electrical cars is the variability of the TRUE cost of electricity in the moment.  During a sunny day, electricity  could be zero price but high costs, and during the night 40  c/kw-hr in cost but less in price.  With bid and ask pricing costs will vary.
@Neumie77 @FMGhost09 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Dude, the point of natural born means you have no other option of citizenship.  You can't jump ship and betray your countrymen.  That is why they had it in there you idiot.  I don't give a flying crap what some case says.  Turn your ignorant brain on.  Learn to think, not parrot
@Neumie77 @FMGhost09 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Stinking hogwash.  Learn some law.  Wake up.  Turn your brain on....
When the price of electricity goes negative during the day, it pays to make NH3 instead of paying to take the power away.  This may be the reality of the grid as more and more wind and PV solar come on line.  Pay to get rid or make NH3?  Choice is obvious.
A coal plant on the margin costs &lt; 2 cent/kw-hr locally.  At twice input, that means the electricity input would be $1.38 /gal e.  This would allow a coal plant to make money making NH3 if they sold it at around $2/gal retail.  Not saying this is smart, but only viable cost wise.
When a battery costs you 12 cents/kw-hr to use it, and it takes twice the energy to make NH3, you need to be less than 6 cents/kw-hr to compete on a fuel basis.  Round trip with 60% engine, you need to be 3.6 cents/kw-hr (0.036 x 2/.6=.12) on solar.  Doable?  Yes!  Maybe 2 c/kwh?
Reason would stand that a fuel made from N2 (78% of air) would be easier to make than a fuel made from CO2, which is 0.04% of air, a trace gas.  That amounts to ~ 2000 times more N2 as CO2.  NH3 also has a life of 1 day or so before it breaks down.  Why is this not obvious?
This video shows how a CO2 cultist (Potholer) can get crazy ideas and not realize just how silly his ideas are.   @SteveSGoddard did a good job in "setting the record straight" as usual.	https://t.co/bF2KPMRwvD
@FMGhost09 @Neumie77 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Again, BOTH parents MUST be USA citizen at the time of birth to cut off any option for you to be get out of town when you as president try to be a traitor.  This is about loyalties.   Eligible person can't have a way to jump ship via either parent, which means BOTH must be USA.
@FMGhost09 @Neumie77 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Hey stupid.  If your mama was a Canadian, like mine was, you can become a Citizen of Canada, but if she was USA then you came out, you could not.  If you have any claim to ANY other country besides USA then you are NOT eligible.  This is not hard to understand.  Wake up.
@Neumie77 @FMGhost09 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Law of Nations 1760's written by Jesuits....  Turn your brain on.
Even if this engine technology were the same efficiency as old Diesel or Otto engines, the packaging, weight, torque characteristics, distributed nature, and more would make it massively better than the old stuff.  Not even close.  It enables vehicles that are NOT enabled now.
There are three levels of advancements enabled by this engine system.  	1) remove old engine and use old basic design for 4x fuel economy boost. 	2) design new car with many new features, abilities and much safer. 	3) roadable airplane.  Fly up to 400 mph.  Drive W/without wing.
My concept car would allow a 5th wheel trailer to be towed, allowing 5 passengers during tow, and up to 8 when not  towing.  It would ride like a car, but have the stiffness needed for high load ability of a heavy truck when towing.  No need for 8000 lbs SUVs.  200 mpg.
There are several other ways to tow that this engine technology enable, but that is subject to patents....  Clearly, towing will change with this technology.  The need for a pickup truck or SUV would be gone for the most part, allowing regular cars to pull large trailers or boats
@FMGhost09 @dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Nope, not correct.  Silly notion.  Your criteria is the LEAST stringent.  Why would a less stringent criteria be mentioned?  It would not.  The only way to be eligible is to have NO OTHER OPTION of loyalty to a country via parents.  Requires BOTH parents to be citizens at birth.
This technology allows for "powered dollies" that allow you to pull massive trailers with a low weight car.  Trailer weight is on dolly, not car.  The extra power needed to overcome the massive weight is in the dolly, not the car, thus changing towing dramatically.
With this engine, weight and aero drag affect fuel economy, NOT how much power you have installed.  An oversized engine is NOT a penalty like it is on semi trucks and cars/SUVs with Otto or Diesel engines.  This engine has a different design criteria than old engines. Much better
@dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump To be eligible BOTH parents have to be citizens at the time of birth.  My mother was Canadian , married to my USA citizen dad, and naturalized 2 years after my birth, so I am NOT eligible.
The nice thing about this engine is you can have a 1000 hp and still get THE SAME fuel economy as 100 hp, minus a small amount for the added weight of more motors.  In fact, more motors can INCREASE fuel efficiency in a "combined cycle" with "extra" motors.  Pulling power ok.
The reason an "upgrade" motor (extra) would need to be in the rear is that another motor in the front might change the crash pulse and thus the sensor detection of a crash.  If it did not affect sensing then front and back could have "upgrade" "slots" to add power.
@dadropovahat @Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump No, Cruz was NOT!
@JpiersM Ok, I misunderstood you.  Good point.
@Corp125Vet @RealErinCruz @RealTT2020 @realDonaldTrump Not eligible to run.
@JpiersM "Ticks" a box?  What are you talking about???  This engine is fundamentally a different type of engine that will impact power more than the jet engine did to aviation.  Why is this so stinking hard to grasp?  Turn your brain on please.
@JpiersM What kind of a comment is that?		My engine is the first that can get zero carbon.	First to increase economy by 4x, which is equal to electrics without all the battery costs and weight.	Crash protection....already made a presentation to the largest airbag company in the world...
@shp4x4 @Dougs1978 @BreitbartNews walk on into the country....and vote.  Basically the Dems want to take your vote by a flood of illegal welfare takers....to basically enslave you.  Dems are the party of slavery....always have been....
The "upgrade" should be in the rear and not in the front where the crash zone is.  Perhaps 3 motors front, and 2 in back, standard.  Add in 1 more motor for the rear for "burn out" rear torque with the motor geared down low, making it like adding 3-4 more motors for 0-60 mph.
One of the cool features of the engine is that it can be designed to enable "upgrade" power from a standard base model engine.  For example, three "motors" would be for a typical car.  Adding in another motor into a "slot" could allow a fourth motor or 33% more power.  Upgrade!
If a SUV were chosen, the same 4x jump would occur.  If the old Suburban got 18 mpg highway and 14 city, it might get 54 mpg Highway and 70 mpg city, and around 60 mpg average combined.  Note, the city mpg would be HIGHER than highway as it should be when efficiency is constant.
Each car company could choose a high volume car at the end of the production run (5th year) and update the car with new engine that got 4x mileage.  The demand would have people lined up down the block to buy an old design with new engine.  Car sales would be amazing.  $$$!!
With a 4x average fuel economy increase (3x highway and 5-6 city), the old car designs could take on an immediate demand increase.  No new tooling for anything except new engine.  This can be done with all car companies quickly once the engine is proven out.
All antique cars without airbags could get a new engine.  It really comes down to the airbags and the "crash pulse" and sensor response.  This would take a lot of engineering.  It would be better to just design new or use existing production cars that can be tested and validated.
Take for example a Camry.  The old engine could be removed and the car have a new engine installed.  The engine would allow 1 million miles.  The body would be of low value, but the engine would make the retrofitted version worth more than a new car with old engine.
The car company could have an old design (4th or 5th years) and add in the option of a new engine, thus extending the life of the design out another 5 years, and allowing previous cars to have a new engine dropped in as an option.  This would make the old model HIGH demand!
Retrofitting old cars would be a great option IF there were no airbag sensor issues.  If a solution could be made that uses the SAME sensors, it would work, but that would be difficult, at bests.  The quickest way would be current production with a drop in that met sensors needs.
A series of crash tests would have to be made to validate sensors for airbags.  Airbags are the fly in the ointment for an optional engine.  Since I have airbag design experience already, I could work out a solution that would allow one sensor for both engine types...perhaps....
With new engine and 12 gallon volume of pressure tanks (400 mile NH3 range), plus 18 gallons of gasoline in old tank, the car would have 3000 mile range if all fuel were gasoline.  This would allow IMMEDIATE installation of the new engine as an OPTION to existing production cars.
The engine can be used with existing car designs and gasoline fuel tanks.  A small set of pressure tanks will be needed that can be placed in the car on the firewall (4 inches thick) and the old gasoline tank used.  It can then use liquid fuels mentioned, propane or NH3.
Because they can use gasoline found anywhere, they can go anywhere and use mostly NH3 at $2/gal from house, and Gasoline (Diesel, Propane, 100 LL, Jet A, or propane) as the alternate fuel.  More and more stations then sell NH3 at low prices and people switch over to NH3.  Simple.
The demand for NH3 cannot start from the gas station because there are too few people with my engine in car that can use NH3. The demand for NH3 starts IN THE HOME.  A person buys my house power unit with NH3 store and fuels cars with NH3 from home.  Range is 600 miles on NH3.
Since most thinking people don't think CO2 is an issue, they will opt for my engine due to much lower costs (up to 16:1) over electric cars. They will not want a battery due to the cost of using one ($4/gal).  Once enough cars have my engine, there will be a demand for NH3.
By taxing people you rob them of potential investment benefits.  My engine can get 4 x fuel economy, AND run on NH3, which is NOT available now for car use.  First things first.  First get people to my engine with needed fuel handling tanks, then move them to NH3 by lower costs.
Before my engine + NH3, there could be a case made that carbon taxes raise the cost of carbon fuels and thus lower their use in hopes of driving people to electric vehicles.  But that leads to an electric solution that is higher CO2 and 2-4 times more costly to get zero carbon.
It may be that if the carbon tax promoters keep ratcheting up carbon taxes to get lower carbon use, there will be a "yellow jacket" movement where people  will use carbon fuels even though NH3 becomes available at lower costs.  Why?  Banning something increases demand-Psychology.

@taylor_marche @JeffWhitson17 @charliekirk11 Yes, government employees need to wake up to the reality of life.  No guaranteed pay check.  Deal with it.
Any way you slice it, with my engine, there will be little revenue from  carbon taxes.  This engine pulls the rug out from the UN funding scam called carbon taxes.  Are they that dumb?  Yes.  They are.  They think nobody will find a solution other than their labs they control.

In essence, carbon taxes will SLOW the move to NH3.  With my engine getting 4 times better fuel, people will NOT go to electrics, and they will resist NH3 as politically correct nonsense.  Be smart...NO CARBON taxes.
By adding in carbon taxes, it raises the cost of my engine when NH3 is still not available.  Not until my engine is widely available will NH3 be practical, let alone lower costs.  Chicken and egg.  Carbon taxes kill the solution to the chicken and egg problem of NH3.  Understand?
The reason I want NH3 is to be independent in energy for my house, cars, and airplane, NOT to be ZERO CARBON.  With more and more people waking up to the CO2 fraud, the motive of zero carbon will become less over time, but lower costs of NH3 will remain, resulting in zero carbon.
Literally in less than one month I have gone from having several ways to get 80-95% of the fuel gone to getting 100% of the Carbon gone at a lower cost  than carbon fuels.  This is a key insight.  NH3 will be the fuel due to lower costs, not due to zero carbon.  Understand?
I have looked at this from many many angles.  Why?  Because I have to know that what I am doing is real and will result in what I expect.  My money is on the line, not some government grant or corporate welfare.  This forces me to be right or go bankrupt.   Understand?

When the real cost of "fuel" (electricity + battery) to run a heavy (2x) electric car is compared to my engine in new car and that number is 14:1, who would opt for an electric car over my technology?  Only those who are insane and those who are forced to buy the junk product.
You cannot add a carbon tax to NH3 made from solar.  That cost of NH3 will be $2/gal.  Electricity will be $10/gal at 30 c/kwh, now found in Europe.  Battery is $4/gal.  That is $14/gal "fuel" to run electric car.   My car will be twice as efficiency.  14/2 x 2=~14 times better!
When a viable option or path to zero carbon exist with my engine, any distortion of the market will have to be REMOVED.  One lawsuit and it is over.  This tweet is public notice:  Your electric car nonsense will go bankrupt.  You have been warned.  Any carbon tax is fraud.
Why should there be NO carbon tax?		It distorts the market.  It leads people now to electric cars when they should be investing in my technology which will get them to lower costs and zero carbon the faster than any other way.  All can support my engine, but not electrics.
If you add a tax on carbon fuels now when NH3 is not an option, you will drive people to electric cars which will be 2-4 times MORE costs over my engine + NH3.  People will then switch back to my engine having wasted $trillion on electric car nonsense.  Beware.  Bankruptcy ahead.
Reality is CO2 is NOT relevant to climate.  People don't want to make CO2 to have power.  They want carbon fuels because they are the cheapest means to end NOW.  With my engine, NH3 will become the cheapest means to travel.  At that point few will use carbon fuels.  Wake up.
@ArchKennedy The reason this continues is because of Western welfare, either direct via social programs or by oil.  My engine unplugs the oil money and therefore one source of money.  Enforcing Polygamy laws can stop the social source.
By far the fastest way to get to zero carbon is MY ENGINE.  By going to electrical cars with batteries, the carbon footprint goes UP in the  short term and $trillion of dollars are WASTED on PV and wind that are  NOT needed.  		$$$= Carbon.  		More $$$ means MORE CARBON.
My engine in new car is 2-4 x better than electric car.  		My engine in old car without heating or cooling is = to electrics or 100 mpge.		By using electric grid car you are par to 4 times worse in terms of CO2.  Also 4-16 times worse in costs.  		Fastest to zero C is my engine.
g CO2/kw-hr :  % grid		Coal = 1001:  30%	Nat Gas Combined cycle (60%) 443:  32%	Nuclear 20: 20%	Renewables 20: 18%		1000 x.30 + 443 x .32 x 20 x .38= 449 (close)		Average grid is 454 g CO2/kw-hr from other source, or about like a 60% efficient engine on Nat gas.
Most every person that buys an electric car gets their electricity from the grid.  	Below is the current USA % by energy type. 		https://t.co/9s2FsM4aYI
I did an analysis of the grid carbon content vs my engine.  AT NO TIME is an electrical car system lower CARBON than my engine in the car.  Again, the best way to get carbon out is MY ENGINE.  Taxing Carbon will INCREASE carbon to the air.  Understand?
My engine turns the entire equation upside down for lower carbon power generation by 10-20 times over electrics.  At no point are electrics LESS carbon or less costs than my engine with NH3.  Never!  READ 1000 times!
The motive to switch to electricity is the 4.44 x fuel economy over Otto engines.  Otto engine is 13.5% eff VS electric 60+%.  60/13.5= 4.44.  This advantage is GONE with my engine compared to electrics.  Making NH3 from natural Gas does little to lower carbon, a prime motive.
Why not use NH3 now?  		1)  NH3 via Haber-Bosch process = lots of carbon. 		2) Fuel cost = to electricity = $3-4/gal e, no advantage in $.		2) Poor old engine efficiency.  Fuel use VS electricity: Otto 4.44 x, Diesel 3.33 x that of electric cars/energy.   		3) range anxiety 3x
@RAMSEYHOUSE Wow, someone actually understands this issue.  All who don't defend border should be tried for treason.  Don't lock them up.  Hang them up.
My tweets below show that electric cars will NOT be viable when my engine system and NH3 come out.  Game over.  The fastest way to zero carbon is my technology by 10-20 times costs.  The world is on notice!  You are liable for all costs of PV and wind....  what a train wreck!
Note, my technology can use Gasoline, Diesel, E85, 100 LL, Jet A, as well as propane and NH3.  7 fuels.  Electric battery also able if needed with battery added.  This means NO range anxiety anywhere in the world.  Make your choice.  Anyway you slice, best possible technology.
Getting to ZERO CARBON via wind/PV panels and the grid is 10-20 times more cost/mile in fuel than with my engine in car,  house solar, and NH3 fuel maker.  Why pay 10-20 times MORE to do it Al Gore's way?  Silly boys.....Think 1929 for "green energy" stocks....holly molly....
Everywhere wind and PVs are installed in high volume the cost of electricity goes up by 2x from 12-15 to about 30 c/kwh.  		30 c/kwh x 33.7 kwh/gal =10/gal		NH3 from my engine and solar = $2/gal		My car with engine = 2-4 x economy over electric.		2-4 x 10/2 = 10-20:1   Game over
In city driving in hot and cold, my engine in new car will be 16 times lower in costs/mile.   2x economy X 2x due to heating/cooling X $8/gal vs $2/gal = 16:1 = 2 x 2 x 4 = 16. 		Choice: 		Independent from grid or oil  VS  electrical single source grid power.  	= Free vs slave.
As stated before, my engine in car = 2x economy over electric.  But that is not where it stops.  My new engine allows free heating and cooling, which can be half the "load" during cold/hot city driving where electric cars go from 100 mpge to 50 mpge.   Electric cars can't win....
My engine allow three main things over old.		1) lower weight by 1/2 over electric	2) boundary layer drag reduction by 1/2	3) motor efficiency par to electrics		This allows a car to be made that is 2 x economy over electrics.  200 mpg e for new car vs 100 mpg e for electric car.
With current Otto/Diesel engines for small vehicles, the cost of running NH3 would be MORE than electric vehicles due to the low efficiency of the engines.  But with my new engine, the game all changes and NH3 becomes the better and lowest cost solution to ZERO CARBON.  Game over
It will be CHEAPER to make NH3 from solar during the day than to run your electric car from the solar panels or the grid PLUS battery.  The killer for electric cars is the battery costs at $4/gal (12 cents/kw-hr).  		If honest, you can see that my engine is much less $$$.
When the "duck curve" kicks in, the grid will not want the PV power.  		Now they pay 5.5 cent/kw-hr ($1.85/gal) and charge you over 2x to take it off the grid at night.  		By making NH3 from 5.5 c/kwh electricity you can have $3.7/gal NH3.		$1.85 + $4 (bat) = $5.85/gal.  NH3 less
My engine with solar thermal from house should be able to make NH3 for $2/gal equivalent to gasoline and get 200 mpge.		Electric car uses $4/gal electricity (12 c/kwh) with battery at $4/gal e, and gets 100 mpg e.  		$2/gal / 200 mpge = 1 cent/mile		$8/gal / 100 mpge = 8 c/mile.
A new car with my engine in it = 200 mpg e	Electric car = 100 mpg e.		Both ran from electricity...		2 x electricity to make NH3, but 2x economy from NH3 new car.		This makes them EQUAL from electricity in cost without considering cost of battery use.  		Game over....
It would be CHEAPER to make NH3 at $6/gal at night in CA from electricity than to drive an electric car at $7/gal from $3/gal electricity and $4/gal battery.  		My engine in NEW car = 200 mpge.  2x electric.  		If electricity = $3/gal	NH3 $6/gal, 		New car = electric in cost
NH3 is $1/gal NH3 for farmer.  Takes three gallons of NH3 to make 1 gallon of gasoline = $3/gal e.		$3/gal = 9 cents/kw-hr, which is what CA charges to charge an electric car at night.  $3/gal elec + $4/gal battery = $7/gal.		Make NH3,  2x electricity = $6/gal fuel. 		$6 &lt; $7
If you put my engine in old car (engine swap), you would get around 100 mpg, which is the same as an electric car.  Same efficiencies.		Fuel cost for Electric car is 4 times MORE than gasoline.  		Therefore, my engine would be 1/4th the cost to drive as electric car.
Currently, electric cars are about 4 times better than gasoline car in energy consumption from plug to wheel vs pump to wheel.  4:1		Gasoline = $2/gal (no tax).  	Electric "fuel" = $8/gal		They are EQUAL in costs. 		My engine in old car economy = electric car economy		4x cheaper.
To be equal to electric cars in cost, all that is needed is $8/gal e NH3 and Par fuel economy.  		My engine in old car economy = 100 mpg e = electric car economy.		"Fuel" for electric car = electricity + battery use = $8/gal		NH3 fuel made from 12 c/kwh electricity = $8/gal.
How to get to zero carbon in cars quickly?  Burn NH3 in car with my engine.  		Done.		Electricity = 12 c/kwh.  Takes twice to make NH3.   24c/kwh = $8/gal.  	Electric car = $4/gal electricity, plus battery at $4/gal = $8/gal		My engine in car = to electric car economy = $8/gal..
When my engine comes out, a car fuel economy will go up by 4.44 times on average.  1/4.44= 22% of the fuel remaining.  If you make a car like I suggest around 90% of the fuel would be gone.  The price of gasoline will be low even if demand for driving goes way up due to China.
@luisbaram Actually much longer than that, but not for house and cars.  Chemical feed stocks, yes.  More CO2 is better, but when NH3 becomes cheaper than gasoline, people will use it to save money and to be grid independent.  Either way it does not matter.  CO2 is good for the planet.
@ElsevierEnergy No need for anything but my engine and systems.  No PV or wind needed.  Wake up and read my tweets.  Totally disruptive.  Bankruptcy complete across the board....
@novapbs My engine is the answer, along with the NH3 maker.  No grid needed.  Zero carbon, but can use 6 fuels.  Costs 1/5 electrics.
How much does it cost to refine oil and deliver to station?		74% – Cost of the crude oil	11% – Taxes	10% – Refining costs	5% – Distribution and marketing		1 barrel costs $61.7 = 42 gal.  61/42=1.47  /.85 =1.73 plus 0.45=2.18 or about current prices.  Ok
@KilgoresFoundry @BreitbartNews Wow, even Cher can see through the nonsense of Chunky Cheeser and Fancy Rancy Nancy?  The new awakening...
Here is a little "predictive program" about energy.  Oil for house, car, factory, and many product can go to zero if wanted, but will not have to.  Oil prices will be held to a small premium to NH3, which will be around $2/gal e for gasoline fuel (no road tax), declining to $1.
Wow, I had no idea. https://t.co/rYwHu8v883
@DiversitynSTEAM @HessCorporation Just need my engine....energy problem solved.
@realDonaldTrump Why did the wall funding not pass when dems voted for it?  Junk inside the bill?
@OfficialJimRohn And if you will to solve energy, you need my engine and solar system.
@RepStevenSmith Until ALL Mexicans are armed, this horror will continue.  Funny how no pols insist that Mexico have a 2nd Amendment.  Why is that?
The reason I would want to get to NH3 (zero carbon) is to unplug the many problems oil causes, including middle east issues and FED oil backing, as well as the independence factor.  Getting carbon out to me is a negative thing to do. More CO2 is better, not worse.  Understand?
A guy, a seaplaneguy, who wants MORE Carbon in the air by 3x, has a solution path to zero carbon in 10 years.  Understand?  News flash...if you want zero carbon ASAP you might want to have a discussion with me.  Give me a reason to truly solve carbon and deliver other than costs.
Funny thing here is my motive for zero carbon is actually negative.  I WANT MORE CARBON in the air, NOT less.  Why?  1200 ppm is ideal for plants, not 400 ppm.  Carbon does not control temperatures.  Can't.  More just lowers the height to extinction...See attenuation graphs!
My engine with tanks included IS the path to zero carbon.  I can see 10 years and zero carbon common....  But it won't happen with current engine technology, fuel cells, or electric cars.  Sorry, they are a waste of money to invest in...just a hint....  My engine is key....&gt;
Once most cars have my engine that allows all 6 fuels, NH3 can be an option at gas stations locally.  If it can be made for less than gasoline/energy (less than 1/3 the price/gallon), then people would naturally use it.  As volume increases, costs come down more and all go to NH3
By having my engine as the standard, the tanks needed for NH3 are included as part of the engine system (required).  The tanks also allow Propane, gasoline, Diesel, E85, 100 LL, Jet A, bio-Diesel, and more to be used when NH3 is not available.  No range issues. ....&gt;
NH3 is a classic chicken and egg problem that my engine can easily solve.  How do you get people to use it if the costs are high, no place to fuel up, lower range, and conversion costs with existing engines.  My engine allows the bridge needed at lower cost than current tech.
So, now 23 days into NH3 and my engine as a zero carbon means is looking like a great way to do it.  The more I look at this the more I can see Ammonia (NH3) being the main fuel of the world.  It can be used in my airplanes for moderate ranges, and gasoline could be used long R.
This was my first comment on making NH3 as a fuel.  I was searching for ways to short term store energy other than H2 due to high pressure tanks.  I came across this Stanford guy who is working on NH3.  Key turning point for NH3 for me.... Dec 18th, 2018.  NH3 looking very good. https://t.co/Ok4WgvVuGN
@GOPLeader @WhiteHouse Trump needs to say he won't work with either Nancy or Chuck.  They need new leadership.  Just that simple.  Get new leaders or no talks.
Here are the safety issues of NH3.  It is between gasoline and propane.  		https://t.co/DxVQXSZvqO
Some more on NH3.  With my engine and solar thermal, NH3 would be less than gasoline.  By being able to use all fuels, my engine enables NH3 with no range anxiety.  This is key.		https://t.co/lrtz6SfIjZ
Wow, the "first" time Ammonia (NH3) was made by electricity and then used for electricity production was late 2018.  This is new stuff....		https://t.co/XGIHI6crex
Certifying a fuel cell based EV airplane would not only be very difficult and expensive, it would give a poor airplane due to weight and lack of fuel options.  My engine can use Jet A, 100 LL, Gasoline or Diesel, and NH3 or electricity if needed.  Check mate.  Game over.
Fuel cells can't take surge loads and must use batteries, which cost $4/gal just to use them.  The complexity of such a system would be 100's of time more in terms of control development and controls, all stuff that would be insane to FAA certify.  With future in the air....&gt;
It then comes down to costs and performance, which my engine will be much better in in so many ways.  It could offer active drag reduction, not possible in EVs, as well as free heat/cooling.  I would guess it would cost 1/5th to 1/10th the amount of a fuel cell EV+battery car.
Fuel cells could use NH3, but none that I know of can use all the needed fuels.  This would complicate an EV and the weight would go up.  Fuel cell would mean less battery and only NH3 and electricity as fuel for the car.  My engine can run on 6 fuels and electricity if need be.
My engine is the missing link to zero carbon future.  All the work of NH3 maker development then can be leveraged via my engine as prime user of NH3 over other engine technologies, with optional 5 other fuels.  At some point I would have a NH3 maker as part of house system.
From what Proton Ventures claims (11,000 kw-hr/Mton NH3) you can get 50% of the input electricity in NH3 form.  NH3 is quick fill, so it is analogous to Tesla's Super Charger 2x cost of electricity.  Many companies are working on NH3 generators, so that is not my point here....&gt;
The marginal maintenance for the engine and solar is key.  If the grid cannot buy power due to the "duck curve" in daytime then your solar investment just went up in smoke relative to the grid, but NOT to NH3.  At $2/gal, to give back electricity from NH3 =$3.33/gal = 10 c/kw-hr.
This says that if you buy enough solar for the house and store excess electricity you can make it for less than $2/gal e to gasoline, or about 66 cents/gal NH3.  This is par to gasoline today.  This sets a floor for gasoline.  Grid will give 5.5 c/kw-hr or $1.85/gal e.
So, the NFUEL technology from Proton Ventures (Dutch company) yields about 50% NH3.  See, I am close...to within a few % points....  So, with my engine on solar thermal power, it can make fuel for about $2/gal in electricity.  This is doable with my engine, but not with EU grid.
Proton ventures claims they can make 1 Metric ton (2200lbs) of NH3 from 11,000 kw-hr.	5.166 kw-hr/kg NH3		11,000 Kw-hr/1000 kg x kg/5.1666 kw-hr x 33.7 kw-hr/gal e x $0.12 cent/kw-hr grid electricity = $8.6/gal equiv to gasoline.  		My engine at $0.0279/kw-hr gives $2/gal e.
@glennwells13 @HuffPost What is the Huff post?  Some bed wetting rag?
Why do you think food is so cheap?  Because we can eat just about any type of food and make it cheaply.  We don't need to buy processed foods to live, but current Otto/Diesel/turbines require one type of processed "food" for the engine.  That means high prices.
To truly be independent you have to be able to make the fuel.  Solar, wind, or some other renewable source can be used to make fuel with this engine.  That fuel can be stored and used for transit.  No oil is needed, but oil can be used if that is what is available out and about.
I guess it all comes down to whether you want a solution more than you want to complain about not having a solution.  I think people like to complain.  I do.  Easy way out.  Blame others.  I get it.  But the heavy lifting is done.  The path out of this OIL slick trap is clear...&gt;
Welcome to planet earth.  I did not have a clue until I started asking questions and working toward reality.  Yes it takes time.  Yes it takes work.  Yes it is fun.  Yes, the journey is worth it.  Yes zero carbon is possible for house and cars.  Yes it can be cheaper.  Yes^1000
I have gone from wanting to lower fuel consumption so that I can take my wife with me on the Sea-Era airplane to Hawaii to solving the energy problem.  90% of the battle is dealing with stupid people who claim they know what they are doing but actually are just techno cultist.
Do I want to use NH3?  No, but if it is cheaper to make than gasoline, sure, why not?  In the long run it will be.  Get used to it.  But CO2 is VALUABLE to the planet, and is NOT harmful at all.  With my technology we have more than enough for all and plenty to spare.  Wake up.
Do you all realize that a carbon free economy can be realized with much less than $2 million in R&amp;D, and if the engineering is free up front (compensated later), the problem could be solved for much less than the cost of a 1 acre lot I have to sell....$250,000?  Understand?

Here is an article on NH3 as transportation fuel.  		https://t.co/9rgnqhse4o
The point is that when true costs of road travel is considered, including tires, brakes, insurance risks, delays, hotels and more, the real and only solution becomes to fly the cargo, not drive it.  Somewhere around 200 mph seems about right, or 4x current average truck speed.
If the 40 c/mile savings were added to current ground fuel costs of 47 cent/mile for a truck ($3.3/gal/7 mpg= .47c/m) for a total of 87 cent/mile, then the speed would be 298 mph at 25,000 feet or 6x ground speeds.
If true costs were had for trucks, the road tax would be around 24 cent/mile.  Add in tires at 8 cents/mile, brakes at 2 and road stuff at 6...total ~ 40 cent/mile just because you are on the road.  If Fuel = $2/gal, then flying semi speed at 40 c/m = 202 mph.  Like FREE FUEL !
Road tax is a clear example of how distorting market prices leads to wrong solutions.  Tax rates have not gone up since 1993 and inflation has doubled costs.  Real costs are partially carried by the income tax instead of actual costs, thus hiding costs of road travel.
IFTA tax PA=$0.0172/kw-hr.  $0.74/gal D	Gal of Diesel =1.15 x 33.7 =38.76 kw-hr/gal 	tax is=0.0172 x 38.76 = 66.6 cent/gal e	Current trucks 7 mpg.  .74/7= .106/mile	Tesla claims 15.8 mpge at 55 mph.  15.8 x 0.106=$1.67/gal e	1.67/0.666=2.5	Tax should be 2.5 x 0.0172= $0.043/kw-hr
Pennsylvania is the only State that shows up applying IFTA tax. https://t.co/SxV4mv3x8e  		The rate is 0.0172/kw-hr ... x 33.7 = 57.3 cents/gal e.   Clearly this is about 1/4th what it should be for a 100 mpge car or $2/gal.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada IFTA would require road tax to be paid.  Drive a certain distance and weight, you pay in the State or Province.   In 2018 electricity is now taxed. https://t.co/NM9fV14Rvf
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Why would I want it changed from a selfish stand point?  I can use fuel (Diesel, gasoline) or NH3 with zero tax just like electric cars have.  If a truck does not pay road tax, they are sent a bill now.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Neither were electric cars just a few years ago.  If I had 1% of the funding I could make the EV market die quickly.  This would get the fuel out much faster for many reasons I have tweeted about.  The fastest way to zero carbon is my engine.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Actually, the system is ok if all trucks are about the same efficiency.  More weight = more fuel = more tax/mile, as it should be.  The problem comes in with different efficiencies.  Weight and distance is the measure, not efficiency in fuel use.  Hence this will change.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Electricity at 12 cent/kw-hr = $4/gal.  Battery $4/gal to use.  Total $8/gal.  Supercharge add $4/gal.  Total $12/gal		Gasoline now $2/gal (no road tax).		My car 2x economy over EV.  		Ratio 8-12:1  (8-12/2 x 2= 8-12).  		Note:  NH3 = $2/gal equiv home made.  No externals.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Battery weight increases total weight by about 2x over my car same seats, etc.  		My engine can do active drag reduction, which can get 1/2 drag gone.  1/2 weight and 1/2 drag means 2x fuel economy over EV car.  		Fuel at $2.45/gal includes road tax.  2.45-.45= $2/gal gasoline.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Plug to wheel, a Tesla is 75% highway and 60% city, according to Tesla figures (twitter took them down....).   Braking recovery is 25-50%.  Thermal loads city are 50% in cold/hot.		Fuel to wheel, my engine will be 60-75% with 100% braking.  Thermal loads free (part of cycle).
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada The key is to divide out the road tax costs as they will be distance and weight determined in the future.  No fuel tax means will work with lots of fuels.  Only distance and weight (damage/mile).  In not case will an EV beat my technology...never.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada The fuel (NH3) used could be made from solar thermal from house (see tweets) at about $2/gal or about 6 cent/kw-hr, or less than what you pay.  No other costs of factories or grid losses.  The end game is my costs will be around 8 times less than your EV if not twice that.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Remember, My engine can use 6 different fuels and electricity from a battery and would be par in economy without active drag reduction.  Without the weight and active drag, I should be twice as good as EV in absolute energy terms.  Cold weather 2x again.  Up to 4x over EV.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Sure, happy to !!!
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada In USA 30 kw-hr = $3.6-4.5 (.12-.15 x 30 =3.6-4.5).  		At $2.3/30 kw-hr = 7.6 cents/kw-hr.   Your costs are about 1/2 USA average.  		$4.3/gal is just electricity and road tax, no battery costs, which is $4/gal.  		Your real cost is $8.3/gal.  		Gasoline $2/gal. 		8.3/2=4.15	~=
So, a trucker makes 45 c/mile on the ground.  At an average speed of 50 mph, that makes $22.5/hr.  If the fuel costs were equal (50 c/m), and flew at 184 mph, the trucker/pilot would make $82.8/hr. (184/50 x 22.5=82.8).  Fly 1400 hrs/year....$115,000 vs $45,000 for 100k ground.
At 15% of power, 184 mph, the power would be 907 HP and 50 c/m on $3/gal fuel.  If you could get fuel at $1/gal vs 3, Cruise would be 319 mph for 50 c/m costs.  319/50 mph for ground = 6.4 x for same fuel cost/mile.  Trucker would make 6.4 times more/hr. $22.5/hr ground x 6.4=144
At 200 mph and 25,000 feet, the semi would need about 20% of power.  RPM would be around 1/2 peak speed for quiet cruise.  Mpg would be ~5.  Slow to 185 mph and get 6 mpg just like road truck at 55 mph.  No traffic.  No worry.  Just watch the autopilot and enjoy the ride.
The largest motor likely made would be for a flying semi truck and would be 12 inches diameter, 30 inches long with output in middle.  If will produce 756 hp at 2800 RPM and weigh around 250 lbs.  8 would run Semi for 6048 hp peak.  Cruise at 1400 rpm at 200 mph....
My smallest motor in one embodiment will be around 4 inches in diameter by 10 inches long with a output shaft in the middle perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and weigh around 25 lbs.  84 hp.  It is like it is 16-20 piston engine, no noise, emissions, and cool gas.
@barmore27 @gatewaypundit Chucky Cheeser and Rancy Nancy blew rotten chunks....
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada What you really can see is that as the fuel consumption goes DOWN, it pays to get off the road and into the air to avoid road tax.  This is why I say that it will become cheaper to fly than drive when the engine is right and the vehicle is of course right or correctly designed.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada the cost of driving on the road then is 50% of the total cost in city driving, which is NOT being paid by electric cars now.  This is theft.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Notice that if an EV gets 200 mpg, the tax should be 12 cents/kw-hr or what the lowest residential rate is in the USA after the first 400 kw-hr usage.  		So, city driving in EV, HALF the cost should be tax.  12+ 12 = 24 cent/kw-hr = $8/gal, plus battery of $4/gal = $12/gal city.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada 1 gallon equiv of electricity is 33.7 kw-hr according to USA EPA.  $2/33.7= 0.0593 or 6 cents/kw-hr.  If the car gets 200 mpge city (Like a Tesla does) then $4/gal tax or 12 cent/kw-hr tax.  Clearly tax should be by weight and distance, and NOT in the "fuel" as it is now done.
@CanadaInDecline @levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada Because it is Cents/mile based.  If a gasoline car gets 22.5 miles/gallon and tax is 45 cents/gallon, it makes 2 cents/mile (45/22.5=2).  		An electric car should also pay 2 c/mile.  If it gets 100 mpge then it should also pay $2/gal e.  0.02c/mile x 100 mile/gal = $2/gal tax.
@MaryKayBarton @pwrhungry These wind mills kill birds and ruin any scenic value the land may possess.  They are NOT needed.  My engine system with solar thermal on house with, along with NH3 maker and tanks can get each house 100% carbon free year round with two cars (with my engine in them, of course).
Notice in the video below about mini engines, that each was noisy, rough and had to idle some speed.  My engine does not have the noise due to full expansion, and can torque out from zero RPM without a starter.  My engine is perfectly balanced also.  It does not need spark plugs.
@GrabienMedia Then Bernie need to get his buddies together and fund my engine development so I can give him zero carbon energy.  Read tweets.  He can use NH3 in my engine and we can all use whatever fuel is cheapest.

Figures....
@levinepmc @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna @AutoNewsCanada At 12 cent/kw-hr, electricity is $4/gal.  Battery is $4/gal to use it.  Supercharge (like shown) is another 4....total $8-12/gal.  This does not include road tax which should be $2-4/gal.  Total $14-16/gal to drive electric car.  My engine is par to electric.  Gas $2/gal...
@MaximeBernier He is a traitor to Canada....duh.
@mbrenewables @grau_pause @WindEnergyHH My engine plus solar thermal makes these obsolete.  Stop killing bird....
My motor is somewhat like having a 16-20 piston engine in torque, or a 4 pole electric motor.  It is NOT (!) like these little engines, if you are wondering....		https://t.co/TsyjJOrDQt
@BardLackey The problem is cars now can't use NH3 due to range and no tank.  This requires Propane type tanks, not the CNG heavy tanks. But because of the 3:1 volume needed, the gas tanks need to be 3x what gasoline needs.  My engine solves this by 3-4x efficiency (60-75% new vs 10-20% old).
@BardLackey As the theory goes, the "duck curve" comes into play where solar/wind is 100% during day and nuclear power has to pay to give electricity away.  Excess power then is used to make NH3.  This may be where the Anti-CO2 people will take it.  Make fuel...sell for cars.
@BardLackey End game is to make it in house, but maker is only lab project at Stanford...so I hear.  I discuss this in tweets around dec18.  Now the source is factories which make it from CH4 (Natural Gas), which is worse than just burning carbon fuels.  But the idea is to make it....&gt;
@EmilyMiller Chucky Cheese blew chunks, and Fancy Nancy ate them.
@BardLackey They would NOT NEED a battery, but could use one for short term low Power needs (charging cell phone...).  This would also allow distillation and harvest (from air) of water, and thus lead to 100% zero grid applications.  No water, sewer, gas, or electricity.  Garbage...not part.
@BardLackey If a person has my engine in cars, solar thermal panels (not PVs), solar thermal storage for 1 day bridging, NH3 fuel maker and 400-600 gallon storage, they could over the year use NO carbon fuel.  But if they fall short, they can still use any of the carbon fuels.
@BardLackey It should be possible to make NH3 from house solar via house engine, and thus allow a person to make excess NH3 over the summer, store NH3 and use it during cold times to be 100% carbon free for house and cars.  It might be &lt;$2/gal equiv for NH3 from house fuel maker.  Goal.
@BardLackey Remember, the engine is designed to run on gasoline, Diesel, Propane, E85, 100 LL, Jet A, bio diesel, Butanol and NH3.  NH3 is the zero carbon option for those who want to save the planet from CO2.  All others can use whatever fuel that is available or cheapest.
@KansasCity1980 Who takes pictures like that?  Mental cases?
@BardLackey LOL, You would know if you had a combustion issue long before it became a problem.
@BardLackey Farmers now pay around $1/gal NH3.  It takes about 3 gallons to make the equivalent to 1 gallon of gasoline in energy, so the equivalent cost would be $3.  Gasoline now sells for $2/gal without road tax as of today, or about 2/3 the cost of NH3.
@BardLackey Could, but my engine has to run all fuels, not just NH3.
@BardLackey Basically you can buy NH3 as a Farmer at around $3/gal equiv to gasoline or about $1/gallon NH3.  I calculated it below.
@BardLackey Farmer pays $404/2000 lbs x 2.2lbs/1 kg x 1000kg/Mton = $444/Mton  		If 2.78 c/kw-hr gives $1/gal gasoline equiv, then 1 gallon of NH3 would cost:  12.094 kw-hr/gal x 2.79 = 33.7 cents/gallon NH3   		Mton cost? 5.166 kw-hr/kg x 1000 kg/Mton x 2.79 c/kw-hr = $144.13/Mton 444/144=3
@NBCNews I hope they all don't cover it.  Their ratings will just go down even further.  Lots of places to watch, the worst of which is NBC (nothing but crap)
@StephenBakeplus Geraldo is a racist.  His strong hispanic in group preference is at the core of his hate for all that is not "hispanic" whatever that means.
@ROCKONOHIO @seanhannity No, Journalism was always dead because it was corporatism propaganda.  With the advent of the internet real journalism was born.  The MSM was fake journalism from the beginning..
@lrpwolf @RealJamesWoods It is a type of mental disorder.  Maybe she thinks she is a goddess to rule over all of low life subjects to her whim.
@realDonaldTrump Imagine if you had my engine that cut the fuel needs of average Joe by 80-95% allowing people to save over 20% of their income (energy is 25% of goods sold).  The economy would be at 5-10% growth rates.  This would last for 10-20 years as my engine is installed throughout.
@sunrisemvmt My engine is the ONLY known way to get lower carbon.  Stop promoting solutions that are literally 10 times more costly than what I propose.  Let the market decided, not socialist pigs.
The auto industry seems to not be interested in allowing people to use the fuel they want to use. They force the car to use one type of fuel, locking the owner into the price whim of the "fuel" supplier, whether that is the grid or an oil company.  My engine = ALL fuels = Freedom
What people don't see is that using NH3 makes the range go down by 3-4 times  and without an increase in fuel efficiency over old, the tank size has to go up.  The actual volume is much larger due to shape (long cylinder) vs a molded tank that fits where nothing else will.
By installing my engine in a vehicle with a gasoline Otto cycle engine, the  range can be increased by 4.44 times with gasoline and 1.5  times with NH3 over current. 		If my engine were installed in vehicle with Diesel engine, the range  would be 3.33 times and with NH3 ~ same.
@SarahPalinUSA Oh my Deer....Bernie looks like road kill (Deer in headlights) just before being hit on an road.  He wonders around with no idea where he is going or is, hungry for voters and looking like he just got spooked out of bed.  Feel the burn of getting run over by the Trump truck.....
Average Efficiency	Otto engine =13.5%.  	Diesel (RAM PIck-up) =18%.  	My engine = 60%+ (60-75%)		Average efficiency ratio:	Gasoline 60/13.5= 4.44	Diesel 60/18 = 3.33		Volume ratio/energy to NH3	Gasoline 3:1	Diesel 3.42		Range with NH3		4.44/3.1=1.48 Increase	3.33/3.42 =.97 same.
Another way to use NH3 would be to strip off the H from NH3 and inject it, but this would require an entirely new engine and added equipment and level of complexity.  		Again, my engine is ideal for NH3 combustion due to low temperatures and efficiency unlike Otto/Diesel engines.
@LDesopo @RealJamesWoods I hear Fancy Nancy has foundation issues, but not as bad as Clinton.
To make a Diesel engine work with NH3, the peak temperatures must be lowered by a lot or lots of NOX treatment must be used.  To compression ignite NH3 requires ratios to well over 24:1 from the usual 18-23:1.  This makes NOX a big issue and cost.  NH3 avoidance requires cool T
My engine can get aviation to zero carbon via NH3 or cut CO2 with carbon fuels by 3-4 times directly over existing.  NH3 in turbines and Diesel engines is not really possible without massive NOX controls, not valid in Jets.  My engine does NOT need NOx controls due to the design.
The cost of energy as a percent of the economy is not only a function of the cost of fuels, but the efficiency of the application of the energy.  		Most loads in economy are THERMAL LOADS.  My engine is thermal.....		My engine is = to Electrical in torque at 60-75% at wheel.
Gasoline costs have gone from $3.5/gal to $2.5/gal recently.  Road tax/gal in my State is 45 cents/gal.  That means gasoline (retail) has gone from $3/gal to $2/gal.  With my engine, gasoline prices would stay at below $2/gal indefinitely with NH3 from house ~$1.-1.5/gal equiv.
Electrical way via wind, PV solar, solar farms, and Nuclear will double electricity costs in USA, as they have in Germany, from 12-15 to 30-42 cents/kw-hr.  It forces battery use at $4/gal equiv.		My engine will drive electricity to &lt;3 cents/kw-hr.  Fuel costs to &lt;$2/gal, no bat.
Today I will compare my engine to Wind and PV solar.		The LOWEST COST and FASTEST way to get to a ZERO carbon economy is with MY ENGINE.  		Energy now is 25% of economy.  Their way could double costs or be 50% of the economy.		My Engine systems will cut costs to &lt;3-5% of economy.

@justdeplorible But this time we have research that proves Islam is a lie and that Mecca was started in 683 AD, and is not ancient at all.  We know where surrah 5:32 came from...Talmud.  Islam will implode due to history itself.
@kabamur_taygeta @StormIsUponUs And who does the CIA work for?  Where to all roads lead?
@LevineJonathan Becca (Petra in Jordan) was where the Koran took place, NOT Mecca.  Becca (place of mourning) was where the Nabatean tribe (1st of 12 sons of ancient Ishmael) met twice a year to bury dead.  See Dan Gibson's work.  Islam is a lie.  Game over.
@JLPtalk @worldnetdaily Islam is the reason for the treason.
@lilbulli1031 And when this boy finds out Becca (Petra) is the real Mecca of the Koran narrative, he will realize he was lied to all his life.  The boy will destroy Islam.

@StefanMolyneux Would you like to do a program on energy and how to get 80-95% of the fuel gone out of the average person's life?  We can talk about transportation also....  thanks.
@realDonaldTrump Start by exposing the fraud of Islam.  The real "Mecca" is "Becca" (place of weeping) better known as Petra.  Look up Dan Gibson's work.  All Quiblas (wall pointing direction of prayer) were facing Becca/Petra until 732 AD, NOT Mecca.  Koran story is in Becca, NOT Mecca.

@JoeFreedomLove A religious State?  Why is that always a problem?  Simple.  They don't allow other religions.  Islam is a political system that makes Islam dominate over other religions and eventually kills those who don't belong to or follow Islam.  Only a weak (false) religion does this.

@SenatorRomney Mitt, if you actually want to have a name, why not help me solve the energy problem?  Start by reading my tweets.  In there you will get a view of how to solve the energy problem.  Happy to consider Utah as a place to manufacture all the engines for the world.  Interested?  PM

@OFFICIAL_ERRT My engine then will unplug the need to be in the middle east because oil is all that the middle east has to offer.  Unplug Iran's cash flow...down goes the crazies.  Same in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and so forth.  Dubai?  Toast burgers....  Another one bites the dust....
@OFFICIAL_ERRT When is the operative word.  Islam has the on button in the on position, the rest are mostly turned off.
@OFFICIAL_ERRT Errt, not here to bash Catholics.  Last I checked they stopped burning people at the stake a long time ago.  Maybe they will start up again.  Don't know, don't care.  My focus is on the cult called Islam that wants me dead now.  My engine unplugs oil and therefore Islam....
@OFFICIAL_ERRT My tweets are about engines, not a religious debate about "true" or false Christians.  Most are apostate, but most are not out to kill me because I don't attend their Sunday service.  Islam is different.
@OFFICIAL_ERRT What specifically are you after?
@OFFICIAL_ERRT I have NEVER been told to kill anybody and if I did I would be a dooooomed soul.  Avoid using "every" and religion because it is NOT true or correct.  Some or many, yes, but NOT every, as MY religion does not.
@OFFICIAL_ERRT That is new to me.
@OFFICIAL_ERRT Eucharist is the sexual union of Ba AL and Ba ALLAH, the moon and sun god.
@OFFICIAL_ERRT Not true.  No protestant Christians believe that, and in fact most religions don't.  Catholics believe that heretics could be killed.  Talmudic Jews believe similar to Islam, where Islam got the hate from.  The three big ones are the problem.
@RobynAnne @realDonaldTrump My engine will unplug Islam via oil.  Remove the funding via oil and down goes Islam.

The future is in the air.  Why?  Cheaper to fly than drive.  Road tax, tires, brakes, road risks and damage, are MORE than fuel (Nat Gas) at 200 mph.  Time is money.  Flying is where the money and low risks will be with my designs, but not with other designs. https://t.co/6pXc49af98
My engine in a truck will beat out electrics for several reasons listed below.  One I missed is boundary layer control, better know as active drag reduction.  This can allow 18 mpg 80,000 lbs semi.  Then flying semi.... Not even close. https://t.co/vwRiOKcDSq
I cannot get to cool seaplanes with electrics due to costs and battery limitations that will not be solves for at least 20-30 more years....after I am dead.  Moreover, can't make money doing it either.  My engine can make all the money I need to make cool seaplanes ASAP. https://t.co/D8Nbwpd3U8
Can't stress this enough, batteries for aircraft is NOT smart.  If the battery goes hot, you have to be able to get rid of the cells that are burning or everybody is dead.

@Thomas1774Paine She can be....  Foundation issues?  This is going to be fun.
The one thing that really attracts me to this is the fact that I won't need "sales" of the engine to make all the money I need to make airplanes.  Apple and MS cannot do this, neither can most of silicon valley.  The business model is very "stealthy" if you may indulge me. https://t.co/ekMxR6ix1r
When renewables (mostly solar, some wind ok that does not kill birds, but who wants to live in a wind tunnel???) are on a house and done right, no extra space is needed due to factors enabled by my engine.  This is what people want, not landscapes destroyed by ugly junk. https://t.co/TAI155dbyJ
A wind mill can be less costly by a variable hydraulic pump in the tower, lines down the pole to a variable motor hooked to electric generator.  This eliminates the inverters and poor electricity quality.  My engine then turns generator and uses NH3 or Nat Gas when low wind. https://t.co/5frHuo86w0

H2 is great, but definitely not practical compared to NH3.  I cannot store a lot of H2 in small places cheaply, but I can NH3.  The pratical side is NH3 becomes the needed "throttle" to the grid and NH3 replaces carbon fuels in my engine and similar.

Look up the "duck" curve.  Nuclear will not work without a way to use the power when solar is on during the day.  NH3 production is the answer.  Nh3 then powers cars.  Nuclear + Nh3 may work, but not alone.  NH3 is the "throttle" of grid.

Make NH3 when excess wind exists.  Use NH3 production as the "throttle" leaving Nuclear constant and wind to do max when it can.  The grid throttle then is NH3 production, not wind or nuclear.

Liquid H2 is 3.4.  NH3 is 3 times.  My engine allows 3-5 times better economy (60-75% vs 10-20% from Otto engine).

Packaging is key to blown wing technology that is key to roadable airplanes that can land on roads and don't need airports.  This Toyota engine is not valid for blown wing.

Our legal system is a joke.  It takes money to get any protection via patents and then how to enforce the claims?  World full of thieves.  No need for investors....
@WalterHorsting @PaulEDawson No wind mills or PV needed.  My engine can get us to zero carbon, as well as use 5 other fuels.  My engine it the solution to energy, the rest is junk.
@JosephNSanberg Joe, if you want to solve poverty you need my engine.  Read Tweets....
@RogerAPielkeSr @richardabetts @DrShepherd2013 @curryja @USWeatherExpert @GlobalEcoGuy @RyanMaue @Revkin Look guys/gals, My engine solves your CO2 problem.  Stop trying to use CO2 as some way to rip off people.  Want to help get it done, then let's discuss it.  Otherwise ya'all are hypocrites.

Well, that does 2018.  Figured out how to get a zero carbon engine, that also works on 5 other fuels.  Sure glad I was patient enough to wait until the right solution was understood.  2019 is time to get it engineered and drawings made.  This will be a fun year....Happy NY

I base them on thermodynamics and what other people achieve relative to my cycle and proposal.  60% is base.  When low power, the system switches to "combined cycle" mode.  Most get 15% recovery, hence the 75% estimate.  BMW did a combined cycle and got that boost.

What ever your argument is, my engine solves it, either against CO2 or for more CO2...my engine solves the problem.  Wake up.  Believe what you will.  Want more CO2 or less, I can give you both as a choice.
Even if I had a car that got 200 mpg on NH3 these lazy butts would still be complaining like spoiled brats about something to change the world with.  What gives?  Are people so devoid of vision and meaning that they have to glom onto some type of cult and follow?  Why?
We have a nation of welfare queens.  Yes, no?  We have thousands of people who know all the points of CO2 AGW nonsense, but not one who actually wants to solve the CO2 problem by working at it.  They just want a job making wind mills or PV junk all of which does zero to solve CO2
What I find is that most people don't want to work and it takes work to understand most things.  Not a lot of work in this case, but it does take some effort.  People all want it handed to them.  They don't want to be part of the team to get it done.  Such people are not valuable

An attenuation graph shows you are clueless about spectrum and what happens in the IR range.  The problem is you have a religious belief, I have logic and facts.  Deal with it.
She even understood it even those she is a "communications" major and not interested in engine, seaplane, grid, CO2 or any of the issues.  That tells me that if you cannot grasp what I am saying, I 100% can't work with you.  You are not qualified to do anything with this tech.
So, I tried to explain this all to my 24 year old daughter who is NOT an engineer and she basically got it.  She understands the need for many fuels, the need for higher engine efficiency to make up for range loss with NH3 per volume and the need for liquid fuels vs batteries.

@greta That may be true, but my engine is certain to get 100% of the CO2 gone using NH3 if you are a member of the CO2 cult.  For those who love CO2, you can cut fuel by 80-95%.  Either way, costs will be lower.  No ifs ands or buts.

@BigArmedBear What happened?
@JasonEndfield No need for any wind with my engine and NH3...zero carbon for those who belong to the Church of CO2 haters.
Once we all get to the remote Island, we hold Friday school classes on seaplane safety, operations, and maintenance.  We then do STOL contests to see who can stop the fastest on the beach.  We have three levels of class to allow all to progress from where they are.  Fun stuff...
@thewoman62 Money honey!  The root of all his evils.
So, the trick is to get the Carbon lovers to meet with the carbon haters via my seaplane cult.  They both fly out on "Free-day" also known as Friday, and nobody is allowed to say what fuel they used.  The CO2 haters use NH3 and the Lovers use the other 5 fuels.

What day would I hold seaplane worship day?  Friday!  Fri means free in German, so the service would be about getting free from work and going to an island and chilling.  Maybe I can tithe the members and cover their fuel costs via NH3 productions from the factory.  Might work.
Even though I can make an engine that can run on NH3 via solar thermal and get the CO2 zeroed out, it just is not very fun running a Church of CO2.  What I really want is to run a seaplane cult.  Much more fun.   We could hold Church on a different Island each worship day.&gt;&gt;&gt;

You lack faith.  Pay me 10% of your income and I will help you have more faith in CO2.  As the High Priest of the Church of CO2 I can solve your CO2 disbelief...with donations of course.
Hmmm.  Setting up a Church of CO2 would be very profitable.  I could be the High priest of CO2 removal, and my spell would be my engine with CO2 fuel maker behind a curtain.  I could dress up with gold scarfs and long robes, hats and staff, and pass around a plate.  What say ye?
Maybe I should set up the church of the carbon free and charge 10%  tithing for CO2 sin absolution.  Caltech has some concept to remove CO2  via an electric process to make fuels.  I could use solar thermal with my engine and make fuel from CO2, and sell indulgences. Good idea?
So, I figured out how to "solve" the CO2 "problem" by using my engine and NH3 generated from house solar.  100% carbon free.  If you don't belong to the cult of CO2 then you can burn other fuels (5) and forget NH3 if you can buy the other fuels for less.  No carbon tax will work.

The IR spectrum is half open and therefore cannot trap anything.  Wake up.  The heat re-radiates to the ground, finds a new frequency that is un-attenuated and bye bye...sheep, dog and IR radiation gets out. Duh...

I could make the engine run off of Natural Gas without using high pressure tanks if need be as low cost option to NH3 and propane .  The problem is storing high pressure gas at a residence could be difficult due to code, but using Nat Gas from 1/2 psi feed would be doable.

@bmet11 @AnnaApp91838450 The folks in the military need to have money for a 401, not a pension, or at least a fractional basis of pension.  Work 1 year, you get 1/20th and so on.  The 20 year thing makes it so people cannot speak out when they see corruption for fear of loosing their pensions.
@cajunchick25 Need a full declas of all of O's records showing him ineligible to be.  Then zero out all EO and signed bills.  Sind O to prison and collecte triple damages....from his supporters.

So, I got into a discussion on wind mills.  The question is what is the maintenance cost/kw-hr?  Some say 1-2 cent/kw-hr.  Some say costs are 10.0 cent/kw-hr actual.  Does anybody have real figures?
The reason my engine system will work and the current  "renewables" won't is that my engine system is in fact a SYSTEM and not just a  part of one.  READ THAT 1000 times.  Wind and PV are NOT a system, let  alone a valid system or part.  They are not valid by themselves.

It can allow drones, and airplanes not possible with either electrics, turbos, jets, or Diesels/Otto cycle engines.  Combined cycle.

Packaging is terrible for airplanes with such engines.  Distributed power (see x-57 from NASA) requires lots of motors, all of which need to hide IN the wing for drag and blown wing issues.  That engine won't fit, but mine will.

This is why the AGW people who think NH3 is the answer to bridge power are going to have issues with Diesel and Otto engine NH3 combustion.

I just added NH3 two weeks ago so that I could get 100% of the CO2 out.  My engine allows NH3 combustion without NOx which is hard with Diesel and Otto engines.

People who don't see it as an issue will buy it to save money on fuel, which, of course, saves fuel.  You will end up wanting all the system and use NH3 to be zero carbon.  Other people will use propane and not NH3.  No argument needed.

The latest tweets are about NH3, but that is only to get the remaining 5-10% of the CO2 out for those who want it out.  NH3 is the go to for AGW people.

@MrWyattEarpLA Correct, free press must not be an agent to a corporation, but an agent to the people in truth.  MSM is NOT free to tell the truth.  They do what they are told or are fired.  A free press cannot be fired for speaking out.
@kay_1773 @ZonePhysics Dude, give it a rest.  Go away.
@kay_1773 @ZonePhysics You are not my target audience.  Go back to sleep....
@kay_1773 @ZonePhysics No thanks to what?  Can run any fuel, including electricity.  Make your own fuel at home.  No grid.  What is not to like about it?  Wind mills just raise costs.
@ZonePhysics They are not needed.  They just kill birds.  Read my tweets if you want a glimpse into a real future with zero carbon and cheap energy.
If you listen to people speak about renewables it is as though they can't see 5 minutes down the road.  They don't see how their junk will affect the grid and they think that generation is all that is needed.  No, PV and wind power is worth very little.  The grid is a system...&gt;
If governments did not distort the market with all the subsidies, then people would be looking at real solutions to energy like what I have.  Real costs would be considered, not this PV panel and wind nonsense that does not work by itself.  None are valid by themselves.  Flawed.
My engine system does not need subsidizes to work.  When solar and wind drive up costs to 30 cent/kw-hr from 12-15 (2x+), who pays for this?  All rate payers do.  When electric cars don't pay road tax, who pays?  Fuel based cars and trucks. Can't we just let price signals work?
Electric cars don't factor in battery costs or road taxes.  Why are not houses that have electric cars charged an extra surcharge for capacity?  Hmmm.  The reason this electric stuff works (does it?) is because it is totally subsidized by other rate payers by 2-3 x electric bills
As I have tweeted before, people think electric cars are cheap, but they are not.  When my engine comes out they are 8-12 times more expensive.  People are paying for prepaid fuel costs via the battery costs.  Would you buy a gas car if I prepaid your fuel costs?  No difference.
Remember when Tesla offered free charges at their chargers if you bought a car?  Now it costs you 12 cents/kw-hr to slow charge and 24 to super charge.  From free to $8/gal (24 c/kwh).  Like buying a $2000 phone with "free service" included.  No, you paid up front, idiot.
If the grid were gone tomorrow, what would you power your electric car and fully electric house with?  Solar?  How?  Get serious.  How?  When the sun don't shine for 1 month, what do you do?  Vacation?  How?  Reality is it does not work, folks....  My engine will.
What happens to your electric car if the grid goes away due to my engine and other technologies?  Think about it.  Why do we have a grid?  Because we can't generate it at home.  Same applies to sewer, water and gas.  Why are they needed?  They won't be with my engine systems.
@wattsupwiththat My engine will unplug any carbon tax.  No need for oil.  NH3 via solar.  Can use any fuel if needed, including electricity if set up that way.  Read tweets.  Future of energy is going to be very very cheap.  No carbon tax will work or help.
@michaelfreeman @Jali_Cat @SenSchumer They are called Dykes....LOL
This ability to use many types of fuel will be important to low costs as fuel types changes over time to perhaps NH3 and electricity, or even some other fuels other than gasoline and Diesel, and even more so with airplanes.
With electric cars, one cannot "fuel" them with many types of fuels and when they go empty, damage can occur,  Not so with engine.  A small bottle of fuel can get it going.  One can use a public bus to go fetch fuel, but not so with batteries. This fuel ability is key to future.
The key is that this engine systems in house and cars can use other fuels other than NH3 should NH3 not be available or the system does not produce enough for family needs.  Propane, gasoline, Diesel, Jet A, 100 LL, or even E85, Methanol, Ethanol could also power the house/cars.
If you can get an engine system that is 24/7, 365 that runs 100% on solar and uses that solar to fuel your cars and bridge cloudy days via NH3, why would you want grid power at current rates, especially at European rates of 30+ cents/kw-hr?
Power must be 24/7 regardless of the weather or climate.  Some years are cloudy, some are not.  It varies.  The problem with batteries is they don't allow charging or filling of fuel when they run out.  Fuel is needed to bridge seasons due to storage size.
Each of the factors of engine, solar panels, solar thermal store, NH3 maker and tank size play a roll in allowing independent energy sourcing.  Every year is not the same temperature wise or solar wise, so tolerance is key.  Tanks can be filled easily, allowing tolerance.
If the car and house could interface and allow fuel transfer, the hassle factor of getting fuel would be eliminated during zero solar periods.  If 5 days =100 gallons, a 400 gallon tank, or four 100 gallon tanks in yard would be enough to bridge a month.  Small space.
One 100 gallon tank would be enough if gasoline.  Nh3 needs 3x.  That means 100 gallons of NH3 would last 3.66 days.  By cutting thermal losses, it might go for 5 days/100 gallons, which includes cars, btw.  If the car has 30 gallons, you could fill up car and bring home in car.
How many Gallon equiv of NH3 are needed per day?  		Heating: Assume 216 gal/m.  /30=7.2  (no solar)	30 kw-hr/day = 30/36 =.8  via engine /.6=1.38  	81 miles/day at 200 mpg =.4		Total 7.2+1.4+.4=9/day = 324 kw-hr/day.  	600 lbs/gal.  5400 lbs/day bat.		100 gallon?  100/9=11 days.
But by using a battery you can't ever get to 100% off grid ability.  Why?  Because a battery, like solar thermal storage, has only a limited time of use after which an entire back up generator system would be needed.  You can't bring in fuel or charge remotely or store enough.
Just as batteries are a deferred cost (buy up front, replace later), engine maintenance is the same.  If people don't like counting battery use costs, then my engine on solar then can be zero cost and therefore zero cost for NH3.  So, by going to NH3 you have "free" fuel.
If my engine in car were to use battery power and not NH3, what would be the cost?  $8/gal for battery use.  8/.6= $13.3 or about the same as electric, which is 4 times more than just making NH3.  Battery costs would have to drop by 4 times to make batteries better than NH3.
If engine + solar thermal maintenance were 2.79 cents/kw-hr, NH3 would cost  $2/gal.  Combustion would be 60%, for a cost of 3.33 at wheel.  Twice through batteries is 66% and $8/gal (2x$4/gal bat use).  8/.66=12.  92% electric motor... $13.2 total cost.  		13.2/3.33=3.96
To make NH3 at $6/gal is 8.3 cent/kw-hr (6/36 kw-hr/gal /2 units of electricity input per= 8.3 cents/kw-hr).  With Natural Gas you can make electricity at 5.5 cents/kw-hr from $1/gal Nat Gas, which translates to $3.96/gal. (0.055x2x36=3.96)  Better to just use Nat Gas.
The problem with using batteries is you have to store it in a battery at home, then use that battery to charge the car when it returns at night.  The energy remaining is 66% which means the battery costs you $6/gal (4/.66=6), not 4.  What electricity price is NH3 at $6/gal? ....&gt;
Notice that if I cut out all the house thermal loads by having lots of solar thermal, I still cannot cut out the fuel needed for the car unless batteries or NH3 are used.  Batteries cost $4/gal plus the loss in and out at 81%, which means $5/gal out of the battery.
@Fake_Ljaschko @OnlineMagazin Stupid ideas have a price to pay.  Either they get them out or live in terror.
Notice that 90% of the carbon fuel is gone without having any wind mills, PV panels or grid connections.  No NH3 technology needed to do 90% of the CO2 reduction.  The LAST 10% requires NH3 technology.  The question is how much will the remaining 360 gallons cost.  $1/gal? Maybe.
As below calculated, 90% fuel gone just by installing new engine, solar, solar thermal in house plus new car with new engine.  		Now comes NH3.  By adding NH3 maker, the remaining gone. 360 gallons is doable to make in 1 year.  		ZERO carbon fuel over year from house and cars.
Old house 1500 gal Nat Gas.	Old electricity 10800 kw-hr=300 gal: to make=900 at 33% grid	2 old cars 30,000 miles/25 mpg = 1200 gal	Total old: 1500+900+1200=3600 gal		New engine in house 150; 	House electricity 60	N engine in cars at 200 mpg 150	Total 150+60+150=360 gal		90% Gone. https://t.co/QhwW0Exj3i
@ChrisRowland9 @realDonaldTrump Where is gasoline $1.69?  Does that include the road tax?  If so, that is amazing.
@j_ankrom They are more concerned about the votes of Illegals than the votes of Americans.  When will Americans wake up?
Moreover, My engine can harvest water, distill water, move air,  move heat to thermal store, and torque a vehicle/trailer wheel group if so designed.  PV panels cannot.  Any excess can be stored via NH3, whereas batteries are very heavy and costly to use.
By going with solar thermal + engine, I can make electricity at about the same rate per area as PV panels, and I get thermal loads added to capture.  That amounts to 4-5 times more energy per panel area that is useful to house/trailer/car/airplane.
My house used 1500 gal/y Nat Gas for heating, and 10800 kw electricity or 300 gal.		300/1800=16.6% (1/6th) of total load is electricity. 		This ratio is close to the amount of electricity and heating able from thermal panels + engine.  PV panel only gets electric part, not heat.
By going with thermal and my engine, you get access to 4 times more energy per unit panel size, and you can use the waste heat from electrical generation to heat/cool building or water.  PV panels use electrical to heat, thus wasting 3 units of 4 potential.  PV panels complex.
The thing that fools people with electricity vs thermal is the focus on electricity.  For example, PV panels are 15%.  A Thermal panel is 60-70% capture of energy.  That is 4+ times more energy.  But to get electricity from thermal you might be 15-20%, just like the PV panel.
So, you say to run it via fuel cells?  Ok, 50%.  2x to make NH3.  2/0.5= 4x  to get electricity from NH3.  You only store 1/4.  		This is poor energy store.  		Hence batteries.  1/0.9 in = 1.11.../0.9 out ...1.23.  or 81% of the energy recovered.  1/0.33= 3.03/.81=3.75 with grid.
If it takes 6.06 units of energy to make 1 unit of NH3, then to get electricity from the NH3 takes 6.06/.33=18.36.  The point here is that running NH3 into inefficient engines is not smart.  My engine is the ONLY valid engine for NH3.  Fuel cells are 50%, hence 2x to make NH3.
What people don't realize is that electricity is not just the energy you get from it, but the energy it took to create it which is wasted at the power plant.  The current grid is about 33%, so it takes 3 units of energy to make one.  If it takes 2 to make NH3 then 2/.33=6.06
With free energy, the cost then is the cost of maintenance to run the engines or wind mills.  Some say wind mills cost 5 cent/kw-hr for maintenance.  .05 x 2 x 36 = $3.6/gal.  Still not even close.
Perspective:  If a 25% efficient engine were used to make NH3 it would take 2/0.25=8.  To make electricity from NH3 would than take 8/0.25=32.  Clearly making NH3 is not smart unless the energy input is nearly free.  In the case of solar thermal, it is "free" from the sun.
If the NH3 maker takes only 10% to convert then 1.1/0.6= 1.833.  1.833/0.6=3.055.  This is the lowest possible energy use of the process.  So, from 3-5 times is used to get one unit of electricity.  Clearly electricity use should be minimized, mostly to LEDs and Computers.
Since it takes 5.55 units of heat energy to make 1 unit of electrical energy from solar thermal to NH3 to electricity, it becomes key to avoid using electrical energy from Nh3 as much as possible to heat or cool buildings, and to use waste heat as much as possible.  Local.
If 2 units of electricity make 1 unit of energy in the form of NH3, and the engine is 60%, then it takes 2/0.6 = 3.33 units of heat energy to get 1 unit of energy in NH3.  To use NH3 in an engine at 60% takes 3.333/0.6 = 5.55 units of heat to get 1 unit of electricity.  5.55:1
If an engine is 60% efficient at generating electricity, like the grid is with a Natural gas combined cycle system, then to get 1 unit of electricity it takes 1/0.6 = 1.66 units of energy.  In other words, 60% is electricity and 40% is waste heat.  Waste heat use is key.

Looks like there are a LOT of regulations related to NH3.  Hmmm.  More learning curve!
Ammonia awareness training.	https://t.co/XTKXbqAwJJ
lots of uses for NH3		https://t.co/cNFWdrc4fz
The thing I notice with NH3 is the number of uses for it, from Refrigerant,  fertilizer, cleaning agent with water, rodent repellent, etc  Just search  for uses of Ammonia.  Gasoline has basically one use...running engines.   It seems to be ideal for getting people out of poverty
Issues in handling NH3.   Liquid at -33C and -28 F.  expands to 855 times volume from liquid.  		https://t.co/O1L8rN6Zbv
Cost of NH3 Par to current Gasoline at $2.25/gal (no road tax), NH3/Mt would be 2.25 x 144 = $324/Mton		1228/324 = 3.8	787/324=2.43		Ammonia take 3x volume per energy, so there has to be a cost LOWER to deal with the range issue.  My engine can meet the need.
Current wind mills are 8.9 times too expensive in making NH3 from electricity.  New proposal is only 5.46 times to much.  It has to be $144-288/Mt ($1-2/gal equvi to gasoline) just to make it preferred to carbon fuels.  My engine can do it, but nothing else can.
Watch this. &lt;$200/mton at terminal from NG.  Wind mills can't make it cheap enough!  see time 18:22  $1228/Mt old, $787/Mt new.  Needs to be $144-288/Mt ; 1228/144=8.9;  787/144=5.46  Much too expensive!		https://t.co/AlWiV4fnNc
Not to ramble on here, but you can see that the price of NH3 now prevents it from being used in mobile transit.  NH3 is currently at the mercy of Natural Gas prices and can go up and down by a lot.  With engine system, the costs will be stable and predictable.  $1-2/gal is doable
If I matched Tesla at 7 cent/kw-hr, the cost would be 7/2.79 = $2.5/gal e.  I would not have battery costs of 12 cents/kw-hr nor other issues, so this is more than fair.  The issue is perception and the margin needed.  If active drag doubled economy, then 14 c/kwhr would be OK..&gt;
Perspective:  Electricity is 12 cent/kw-hr or $4.04/gal e.  If my engine makes the car par to electric (same in economy/energy) then $2/gal e fuel would be ok, thus 2 x 2.79 = 5.58 cent/kw-hr is reasonable to allow 2:1 cost over electric.  Tesla is offering 7 c/kw-hr truck costs.
The cost have to end up actually at 2.79 c/kw-hr maintenance on the margin.  		So many variables..		Now, clearly, this is based on recent drops in gasoline prices.  If gasoline were $3/gal plus tax of 0.45 = $3.45 and NH3 were $2/gal e or 2/2.97 = 67 cents/gal NH3 it would be OK. https://t.co/Jgq5VwSXPs
So, NH3 for farmers is 3-5.5 times more than what it has to be at to make NH3 the fuel of choice.  My engine can do this, so farmers will LOVE my engine just for the NH3 savings.  Since NH3 is the start of so many products, if it can be made at 3 cents/kw-hr energy, this is huge.
Convert from ton (2000 lbs)  to Metric ton in cost, multiply by 1.1.  		The recent high of $719 /ton x 1.1 = $791/Mton.  		$1/gal e gasoline is $144/mton.		790/144= 5.48 times....  $5.5/gal equivalent to gasoline fuel.  OUCH!  		But to make NH3 viable it has to go to $1/gal e !
The cost of Anhydrous NH3 was 	2008: $1,134 per ton,	 2009: $430 per ton,	 2010: $683 per ton,	 2011: $846 per ton,	 2012: $848 per ton,	 2013: $683 per ton,	 2014: $719 per ton,	 2015: $656 per ton,	 2016: $504 per ton,	 2017: $404 per ton.		according to https://t.co/NOFdd6VWxn
If 2.78 c/kw-hr gives $1/gal gasoline, then 1 gallon of NH3 would cost:		12.094 kw-hr/gal x 2.79 = 33.7 cents/gallon NH3 		Metric ton cost?  		5.166 kw-hr/kg x 1000 kg/ton x 2.79 c/kw-hr = $144.13/Mton		Farmer pays $404/2000 lbs x2.2lbs/1 kgx1000kg/Mton = $444/Mton		444/144=3
Gasoline has 9500 WH/L x 3.7854 L/gal = 35.96 KW-hr/gallon.  Note: the EPA uses 33.7 kw-hr/gal, a difference of 6.7%.  3 x 35.96= 1.079/gal		Gasoline / NH3 35.96/12.094 = 2.973  which is ~3:1.  		Relative costs are the issue, not absolute.  2.78 c/kw-hr would give $1/gal e.
To get $1/gal NH3 all the costs must be removed as possible to end up with 3 cents/kw-hr in the fuel.  For every Kw-hr of energy stored in the fuel one can only spend 3 cents.  That is 1/4th grid price in low cost States!  		1 gal NH3 has 3.195 x 3.7854 = 12.094 Kw-hr = 36.2 c
For NH3 to become the preferred fuel WITHOUT carbon tax the cost of NH3 has to be below Gasoline by a significant margin.  		Maintenance for the following parts is the key on the margin: 	1) engine + generator, 	2) solar panel, 	3) Fuel maker	4) fuel Store	5) solar thermal store
@bud_cann Either one is copying the other or both are copying someone else.  Who is the someone else?  Who's orders are they following?  Puppets....
The water thermal store cuts night electrical costs down from 9 c/kwh using NH3 store to 4 cent/kwh on average, and 3 directly.  The hot water store also synergies with water purification and harvest to deal with water use which is a big factor in stand along non grid apps.
With the water store, bridging from day to night occurs 85% of the time with hot water and 15% with NH3 fuel.  The cost then of electricity 85% of the times is 3 cents/kwh and 15% is 9.  (.85 x 3 + .15 x 9) = 3.9 c/kwh average, say 4.  That is 1/3 the cost of grid.  Doable....
If the solar thermal is stored in hot water instead of NH3, the engine is used to make electricity only once, not twice.  Nor is 2x electricity needed.  Solar thermal is then 1 engine, 1 panel and 1 water store or about 3 cent/kwh, not 9-12 via NH3.  Cut costs via water store...
Depending on assumptions and actual costs, the concept of solar to electricity to fuel (NH3) and back to electricity again via engine is competitive when maintenance for engine, solar, and fuel maker are each 1 c/kwh, with fuel maker factor 2:1.  Result is 9 c/kwhr electricity.
If engine maintenance were 1 c/kwh and solar panel was 1, what is the round trip price from solar to electricity to fuel to electricity again?  NH3 factor 2.		((1+1) x2)/.6  + 1 = 7.6 c/kwh.   Add in 1 for fuel maker maintenance and you have 8.6, say 9 c/kwh.  Grid 1st tier.
The round trip price of electricity to fuel to electricity again via engine from solar would be around grid prices at 3 c/kwh for solar and 2 c/kwh maintenance on engine from fuel to electricity with a 2x factor in NH3 maker.  (0.03 x2 / 0.6) +2 = 12.  This is doable.
If your target price for fuel is $2/gal, a little less than gasoline ($2.25/gal no tax), then the cost of electricity would have to be around  3 cent/kw-hr.  (2/33.7/2=0.297). 6 c/kwhr.  /.6=.1.  add in  2 cent maintenance for 12 cent/kwh.
@cajunsoulfire74 Chucky looks cheesy.
A farmer pays $500/Metric ton for NH3.  		$500/1000/5.166 kw-hr/kg x33.7 = $3.26 /gal equiv of gasoline.  		So, commercial NH3 is too expensive to compete with Propane, gasoline etc. 		The price at $1/gal e would be $153/metric ton.  Lowest price is $200 at the factory.
All that is needed is my engine system.  No wind mills at all are needed.  They just kill birds. https://t.co/MT2mZ7xLnQ
@AMike4761 Can you be Moslem and serve this country is the question.  Just read the Koran and you realize that service and Islam are not compatible.
Notice, there are two sides to the cost coin.		1) Fuel efficiency: new engine/old Lycoming = 40%	2) Fuel type: Propane/100 LL = 2/5.35 = 37%		The new engine enables Propane in part due to LOW (40%) fuel burn, otherwise volume would be at issue, especially with tubular tanks.
Notice with Propane at $2/gal vs Jet A at 4.63 or worse 100 LL at 5.35, you have saved around what the new engine saves in fuel burn, or 60%.  		2/5.35 (propane/100LL) =.37 x 40% (engine) = 15% of 100LL costs via Lycoming engine.  6.66 times better!  Beastly number indeed!
If you have enough tanks, you run with Propane from house at $2/gal equiv ($1.5/gallon at 75% energy/volume) with a 1500-2000 mile range or so.  This way you take advantage of volume (600 gallon each time) fuel prices with no road taxes.  4.63/2=2.31 ; 2/4.63=43% costs.
Some prices for airport fuels at Van Nuys CA where I learned to fly.  Key in KVNY  https://t.co/I95RuabJKU		Lowest at KVNY:	100LL  $5.35	Jet A  $4.63		Gasoline station Near KVNY is 3.05 (Costco) to 3.99.  3.59 block away...If you are roadable...		3.05/4.63= 66% = 2/3 costs...
Jet A vs 100 LL?  		WH/L:  Jet A is 9166 ; 100 LL 8775.  8775/9166 =.957		Typically Jet A is 75-88% of the cost of 100 LL.    		.957 x 75-88 = 72-84% of the energy per dollar for 100 LL vs Jet A.  		Main fuels to be used now.		Propane: house	Gasoline (85): Station	Airport: Jet A
Diesel is a dirty fuel, so it is not preferred.  However, trucks use it now.  Ideally propane would be used in trucks.  Added tanks would allow long range, with gasoline as a backup and Diesel as a second backup.  At the start however, Diesel may be the only option for trucks.
Three main fuels for the engine will be NH3, Propane and Gasoline.  All can be handled as liquid in engine due to them all being under pressure while in tanks.  Diesel, 100 LL and Jet A will be considered last.   Diesel is dirty fuel.  100 LL expensive + lead, Jet A expensive.
Depending on how the NH3 maker is made, some of the heat can be captured and used to heat house.  This is unknown as of now to me.  Making a NH3 is a large project and will be AFTER the engine is running on the other 5 fuels (Propane, Gasoline, Diesel, 100 LL, Jet A).
With engine, the waste heat can be used to heat house.  60% goes to electricity and 40% goes to waste heat.  This is where water comes in.  By buffering the heat in water, it can be drawn out later to maintain house temperatures.  That lowers losses to just 1.1 to 2 times.
If x energy is put in, it takess1.1 to 2 x to make Liquid NH3.		To make electricity from NH3 depends on efficiency.  Engine 60%.		1 x 2 /.6 = 3.3 x 	1 x 1.1/.6 =1.8 x		to go from electricity -- fuel -- engine+fuel -- electricity.		The process is 1.8 to 3.3 X round trip.  Say 2-3
It is clear that NH3 (Ammonia) can be made via electricity and a machine with catalysts.  Depending on how well the machine functions, the less energy it will take.  Estimates are 2x like H2 and down to 1.12 x with a conservative process with catalysts.  Worst case 2, best 1.12.

@Daniel_Cagan Daniel, as my tweets show, there is little NEED for Batteries, except for cell phones and low power devices.  My engine is good down to around 1 KW, but below that it pays to use batteries.  NH3 is the "battery" or energy store for the "grid" power or large power used in house..
