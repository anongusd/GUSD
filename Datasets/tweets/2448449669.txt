This is not hard.  Instead of falling prey to the pictures with all the kids, these law makers need to get off their duffs and change the law.  Quit spinning &amp; start acting.  In the meantime don’t fault others for upholding the law you put into place. #NoIllegals
Illegal immigrants are not owed the right to break our laws.  #Democrats can spin the narrative any way they want.  This is not a #Trump policy.  This was on the books before him.  If you want to stop this, these immigrants need to quit coming up with their children illegally.
Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their violation by others. --01/27/1838 - Abraham Lincoln #NoIllegals
Amazing.  Where was the left's and media's outcry when #obama said all this? 		It's exactly what @realDonaldTrump is saying.

I'm calling on @KamalaHarris to resign. If she's too stupid to know our federal laws, she shouldn't be making decisions for our country. Where was your outrage when #Obama was President?  These laws were in place then. #NoAmnesty #NoAsylum https://t.co/ztmtNlnz26
