@ElectionScience Polls say most voters don't want President Schultz. But however you feel about him, our current system is letting you down.		He should matter if his ideas are popular and not if they aren't; it shouldn't be about whether he "steals" an artificially limited pool of votes.
@ElectionScience It's not about Schultz's rights, but about our rights as voters to an unspoiled election, to a system that doesn't break when more candidates (good or bad) run. Approval voting is only fix compatible with NPV compact.

@pochochicano @DavidOBowles @AztecEmpire1520 @tkinias I prefer "Chicana" as the generic in English (because in Spanish gente, persona, cultura, etc. are all feminine, so the cases where you have to apply it to a specific individual man are the exception). But whether or not I like it, "Chicanx" isn't only about transgendered people.
@pochochicano @DavidOBowles @AztecEmpire1520 @tkinias That's like saying that "Ms." is imposing a divorcée identity on people. Sure, the fact that "Miss" and "Mrs." didn't fit divorcées well was one of the reasons "Ms." was invented, but it's a catch-all term.

@rudnicknoah Why 50% in a primary where there are more than 2 candidates? Because I'm assuming that endorsement from org X gives you roughly the same odds factor across races. A given odds factor implies the greatest percentage change around 50%.
@rudnicknoah I know that.		I also realize that endorsing a candidate has a dual purpose — getting them to win, and putting them a little bit in your debt if they do win. I was saying that for ①, target should be ~50%. I realize that for ② target is closer to 95%, but still not 100%.
@rudnicknoah They probably beat Biden, too. Endorsing only safe races guarantees you'll have zero impact, and impact is the right metric for who "beats" whom. Thus target is closer to 50% than 100%.

@massivetotoro Just saying that classing Gabbard with Warren egregiously insults Warren.		If I were seriously looking for someone to compare Gabbard to, I'd say "leftist LaRouche". Leave the serious candidates out of it.
@massivetotoro My point was that Gabbard is no closer to Warren than she is to Biden. Her homophobia and support for Assad aren't "left wing". Being compared to Gabbard is an insult.		And if "left wing" was your only consideration, why not Sanders? 🚺?
@massivetotoro Gabbard is clearly "Barack Obama with tons of weird baggage". Or maybe Dukakis. Don't know why you'd bring Warren into this.
@DavidOBowles (It's both. So, I wish I could just start making all my english adjectives lower-case. But as long as that's not the general rule, it seems disrespectful to eg the Deaf community. So, I mostly just live with spanish envy on this.)
@DavidOBowles (separately: I wish that English were like Spanish in not capitalizing adjectives. The slippery slope from "African" to "White" to "Deaf" to "Gay" has its reductio ad absurdam in "Trans": is it a cultural group that should be capitalized, or an accident of birth that shouldn't?)

@GinaOrtizJones @KamalaHarris Is this partly a subtweet about a man who's not (yet) running?		Either way, I agree wholeheartedly.
@davidshor @jimmybo50 @jacksantucci @drsltaylor @massivetotoro Yes, but the difference is narrower when you get specific.		The US system skews power towards older, more rural, and whiter. Then that gets normalized. Change the voting system, and that could begin to change as well. The goal isn't to "catch up to" Europe; just move the ball.

@hill_charlotte RCV can solve a lot of problems, but not this one; it doesn't work with the electoral college. For the presidential level, we'd need some other reform, such as approval voting.
@daveweigel Proudly voted for Bernie in the 2016 primary, and also on this poll.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal The whole point of "different" is that it encompasses more possibilities than can be specified.		In particular, the Lib Dems might have had something to show for being in government, so not collapsed. Chance of UKIP holding balance of power then is much lower.
Citizens' Assemblies may be the best way to unravel the tightest political knots, such as Brexit. Trouble is, by the time you realize you need one, calendar is tight.

@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor I think you didn't quite get how the thresholds work. Also, "MP" isn't US term, heh.		But I think you mostly get it. Not quite as hard on 3rd parties as you thought, but there will still be two parties clearly on top. Just not guaranteed to be eternally the same two over time.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Write-in option increases voter choice. Eg, vote for black dem where local candidate is white. Chance for minority voter groups to find a candidate they're really excited about, instead of just "holding nose" strategically for generic local option.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Threshold with 3 seats would be 3/4 of an average district. So 80% would win, leftover 5% would go to one of the 45s, other 45 would be eliminated, votes roll over, second 75% wins. Last seat is won by R. Leftover=20%D, 55%R.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor ...especially if it had a racial dimension. (That's another way PLACE does a lot better than your proposal IMO.)
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Yep. Could involve voters cross-registering in order to do this.		Wouldn't be common, but even as a rarity, it would be ugly.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor In the US? I'm pretty confident it would be more or less like NZ, but with US's low levels of party discipline / more candidate-centric.		In Canada or UK, I think it would be about halfway between NZ and Germany. Give or take.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor ...and that 2/3 quasi-threshold would be an incentive for (a new and different kind of) gerrymandering.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Not in districts where &gt;2/3 of voters prefer one party. In practice, might occasionally work with less if the stars aligned. Bad news.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Other than that, not too bad. Not my favorite, but certainly better than current US.		(But IMO weighted-voting proposals are legally a dead end in US. I know that PR reform is a long shot, but worth being serious, not just proposing awesome but unconstitutional ideas.)
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Huge incentive for false flag candidates. Would be hard to pull off, but not hard enough so that it would never happen.
@davidshor @massivetotoro @jacksantucci @drsltaylor ENP=3 means there are 2 big parties and several small ones. Median rep is usually, but not always, from a centrist party. 		And even if they are: in parliamentary system that's "junior partner", not full agenda. And in presidential sys that's better than 2p "divided government".
@massivetotoro @davidshor @jacksantucci @drsltaylor Exactly. And PR has other advantages:		Ends gerrymandering!	Incentives for higher turnout/engagement, not suppression	More flexibility to party system	Less zero-sum mudslinging and intransigence?	Eases "money primary" pressure?	More democratic/representative (including diversity)
@davidshor @jacksantucci @drsltaylor @massivetotoro That's closer to current US than current Israel, though pretty far from either one.		I don't like center squeeze, or &lt;100% turnout, but have no problem giving more agenda-setting power to more-engaged voters, while disengaged voters just choose between established platforms.
@davidshor @jacksantucci @drsltaylor @massivetotoro As y'all know, I advocate for a system that I think would lead to House ENP a bit under 3; that is, two major parties, a couple-three minor but viable ones, and the occasional independent. Also smaller parties winning (delegated) votes (thus a bit of one-off power) but not seats.
@davidshor @drsltaylor @jacksantucci @massivetotoro Do you really think that the median US voter's policy preferences are best represented by Joe Lieberman and/or Jeff Flake???		There is are many voters w/ poorly-formed policy preferences. That doesn't make them "centrist" in Washington insider typology; nor does it mean PR=Flake.
@davidshor @jacksantucci @drsltaylor @massivetotoro I've seen people cherry-picking statistics to make the opposite case ("Americans support progressive outcomes by wide margins despite mostly not identifying as such"). I don't think your side is substantially stronger than theirs. Opinion polls are really soft indicators.
@davidshor @drsltaylor @jacksantucci @massivetotoro I may well have misunderstood your position, because I think you're smarter than the argument I hear you making. But one way or the other I'm pretty sure you're arguing in favor of center squeeze; despite respect for you, I disagree in strongest terms. If I'm wrong, pls clarify.
@davidshor @drsltaylor @jacksantucci @massivetotoro Furthermore, I think that "status quo is the best we can hope for because sometimes it puts the smart minority in charge of the dumb majority" isn't just bad policy, it's bad politics. Vanguardism leads you to a dead end; leave that thinking to the current GOP.
@davidshor @drsltaylor @jacksantucci @massivetotoro Sorry to revive this thread, but...		AFAICT, your argument against center squeeze is that it gives you President McGovern 50% of the time. Empirically, I don't think it works out like that. By my count, 1-2 serious progressive years since Nixon (2009-10).

@davidshor @jacksantucci @MattGrossmann The last major leftist legislation that passed was Obamacare. The hinge Senators were Nelson and Lieberman. They are nowhere close to 90th percentile.		FPTP suppresses turnout, enables gerrymandering, etc. And you're arguing that's all worth it to make the pendulum swing higher?
@davidshor @jacksantucci @MattGrossmann Arguable, but OK.		Still: "national unity government" isn't a thing in a presidential system. President still has agenda-setting power. Which is the only power your "liberals" have when ascendant in the current US/UK system; still have to water down proposals to get median vote.
@davidshor @jacksantucci @MattGrossmann Um... could you be mixing up "PR" with "parliamentary"?		As for "split across 3 parties", you're mixing up "PR" with "Israel". There are PR systems that don't lead to that kind of fragmentation.

@davidshor @khneori @jacksantucci ps. David's point about high and low salience can be made quantifiable with eigenvalues/PCA, and I think that's a productive line of thought. Twitter's not the place for it, though.

@davidshor @mlatner @khneori @jacksantucci If I lived in Israel, I can imagine thinking "PR is bad"–that is, pushing for less proportionality. But here in North America, we clearly need more, not less. And I strongly believe that a happy (but not utopian) medium could exist, and that in broad terms it would count as "PR".
@davidshor @khneori @jacksantucci If you know me, you know I can't help mentioning PLACE here: the threshold eliminating candidates w/ &lt;25% support in their local districts would keep out tiny parties.		Point isn't that PLACE is be-all-end-all, but that mechanism design works.
@davidshor @khneori @jacksantucci Scare quotes because it's a matter of degree. On the one hand it's not good when low-majority-salience issues are shut out entirely; on the other, not good when minorities can dictate on them.
@davidshor @khneori @jacksantucci This is well-put, but not (uniformly) true of all PR methods. True for low-threshold list PR like Israel, and possibly for high-magnitude STV (which is impractical so nobody does it). But well-designed PR methods can mostly avoid this "problem".
@davidshor @jim_savage_ @gloombario Israel is the poster child of bad PR, but that doesn't mean all PR is bad. Key is that ideal ENP (effective number of parties) is around 2.5-3.5. Dialectics. USA too low, Israel too high.		For a given ENP, PR is better than not. But not enough better to make ENP&gt;5 OK.

In retrospect, I think that level of polling error could legitimately have been a &gt;2σ event, and I can't see how point estimate of 51% was wrong. Which means σ=4.5%, not 1.5%.		To be frank, I kinda knew I was lowballing the uncertainty, but I really wanted it. #LitanyOfTarski

cc: @ThePSF @tal_is_learning @WillingCarol (This is a thread of post-hoc geeking out about election methods in PEP 8001, python's governance elections. Geeky interest only, no action needed. But I'd thank if someone showed Tim Peters; I aped his "-ly y'rs" signoffs ~'99-'03)
@Ultrademocracy Depends how you define DH3. In other words, I agree with all of your tweet except the last clause. Certainly, you are arguably correct even there, though I'd disagree.
But this extremely technical point is the ONLY place where I think I could have added anything meaningful to Python's discussion of voting methods. And since 3-2-1 had already mostly been discounted, it would arguably just have been bikeshedding. So overall, VERY impressed.	/end
In the case of a community with a relatively solid foundation of shared values like Python, I think the DH3 pathology is much less likely than in a public election, so if I were designing an election method specifically for them I might tweak the first step of 3-2-1 slightly.
(To prevent one group from running 3 clone candidates to monopolize all 3 of the top slots, there's a rule where they have to come from separate parties, and an optional rule where ballots that support the top one are not considered when choosing the 3rd. But that's a detail.)
I believe that the failure mode of "whoops, we elected somebody that nobody took seriously enough to vet" is worse than "we unjustly ignored a 4th-place candidate who would have been a valid compromise", so 3-2-1 is designed to focus on top 3 by core support.
…the electorate is polarized among 3 options, with each camp saying "ANYONE is better than those other two". In that context, many election methods (especially Borda, but even Condorcet or Approval or others) can end up electing that "ANYONE"; that is, an unknown dark horse.
3-2-1 voting (https://t.co/ekief23tjW) is designed for political elections. In that context, there are rarely more than 3 candidates with a serious chance of winning, and often several with no real chance. It's important to avoid the "DH3" (dark horse +3) pathology, where…
At one point, someone wondered why the first stage of 3-2-1 chooses the 3 candidates with the most "good" votes. What if there are more than 3 strong candidates? As the 3-2-1 designer, I can answer that:
…better to get the rules right even if they only matter 10% of the time.		Understanding of the relative advantages of 3-2-1, STAR, Condorcet was high. Someone even mentioned why ranked pairs is better than Schulze, but then they (wisely) decided not to go down that rabbit hole.
Frankly, there was every chance that this vote would be clear enough that any halfway decent voting method would have worked. And it turned out that way. But a bit of time spent discussing this, in case things were harder, not a bad idea. Bikeshedding coefficient is never 0 but…
As with the discussion of #EPluribusHugo voting at the Hugos, I was very impressed with the level of discussion. Geeks, represent!		Of course I would have been overjoyed to see Python using 3-2-1 or STAR, but ultimately, I can't fault their reasons or conclusion of Condorcet.
Just found out that when Python was choosing a new governance model, the legendary Tim Peters suggested #321voting and knowledgeably discussed my VSE (voter satisfaction) research! They ultimately did it by Condorcet. So here's a quick thread in response:	1/ https://t.co/65ECp5jDeI

@jacksantucci The NDP didn't really want PR to pass. You are right about why.		But it could have passed anyway, if Greens and reformers had had better strategy. Specifically: the platform demand shouldn't be "PR" but "Citizens' assembly on election reform". Top-down referendum easy to scuttle.

No, @CBCNews, this isn't "the third time... British Columbians have voted to keep FPTP". The first time, in 2005, over half of them voted to change it (more than voted to keep it now), but the undemocratic 60% threshold meant #ProRep didn't pass.	https://t.co/iW4UZWNYs8

@2closetocall Looks as if "lit" was a serious misstep.
@2closetocall Difference between 2005 and the other two? Citizens' assembly.		When ordinary citizens have time to analyze the issue, they support #ProRep. And when others see that, they trust them. But when it comes from politicians? Nobody trusts politicians.
@2closetocall My guess: Underestimating the "fuck all politics" vote. Because those people don't answer surveys, but some of them did send in their ballots.
But again: the lesson here is NOT that BC hates PR. There have been more votes for than there ever have been against. The lesson is that if you want PR to pass, you have to build the grassroots into the process at every step, not just throw your hands in the air&amp;act neutral.	/end
Existing voting reform organizations like FairVote and FairVoting did a good job. But they didn't manage to mobilize people at the levels it would have taken.		Oh well.	9/
A citizens' jury would have increased engagement and helped give a clear, neutral voice.		Which brings us to the voices that were there. Liberals were fearmongering, NDP was MIA, much media was in the tank for "no", and the official "yes" campaign was disorganized.	8/
I understand that there wasn't time for a full Citizens' Assembly to design a proposal (though could have been done instead of that useless howwevote online poll, a pointless redo of federal https://t.co/YHG1twPrFs). But: citizens' jury to provide voting recommendations?	7/
The reason we organized the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb was that we saw, over a year ago, that there was no clarity. Eby took many of our suggestions, but ignored two key ones. 1st, there was no clear promise that MMP would be open list. 2nd, there was NO CITIZENS' JURY!	6/

And the don't-answer-polls people, it seems, are very skeptical of change.	3/
And it turns out that 42% means that voters just weren't very engaged. Polls had this as a 50/50 race, but it came out as 61.3% for FPTP. That means over 20% of the actual voters weren't showing up in the polls. Basically, people who don't think politics are fun, don't answer.	2/
OK, quick post-mortem time on #PR4BC.		First point: the highest vote total for either side in all three referendums is still "yes" for #ProRep in 2005. In other words, #BCpoli is not fundamentally hostile territory for PR; it's a matter of turn-out/mobilization.	1/

That's not to say that there should be another referendum in BC next year. But if another province wants to try, or if BC tries again in 10 years, that is entirely legit. Combined, the message of the 3 BC referendums isn't "no, no, no" but "more support than opposition".	4/
But. If this referendum fails, I can guarantee that the "no" side will try to paint it as the final word for all time and all of Canada. "3 failed referendums is enough", etc.		Wrong! Even if this fails, more voters supported #ProRep in 2005 than voted against in 2009 or 2018.	3/
First off: the referendum is legitimate. I think #ProRep is objectively better than FPTP in countless ways, but if people vote on something, you have to abide by the result. The suggestion from @NoBCProRep that they'll undermine this if it doesn't go how they want is shameful.	2/
It's pretty clear that, whichever way the #PR4BC result comes out, it's going to be close. I still think odds are better than even for #ProRep, and of course I'm strongly hoping. But time to lay down some markers in case it doesn't pass.	1/ #BCpoli

@ElectProject @ezraklein I think people who think of themselves as nonpartisan feel nervous when they criticize Republicans more. So when, as now, Rs are objectively worse, such people itch to find Dem misdeeds to criticize. This turns a good-faith debate into exaggerated accusations. Don't do that!
@ElectProject @ezraklein In the NJ proposal, the ratio would probably be over 2:1. In other words, maybe above (more "gerrymandered" than) national average, but below (less "gmed" than) average Republican state. Fair? Debatable. Bad faith? No way.
@ElectProject @ezraklein What's the fairest ratio of extra % seats to extra % votes? Debatable. In proportional systems, which are fairer than US, it's 1:1. According to "efficiency gap", it should be 2:1. In gerrymandered states, can be even higher.
@ElectProject @ezraklein So, fair, right? Well, maybe not. Under the proposed NJ standard, for every additional 1% of voters, a party gets more than 1% extra seats. That's good for the majority party, which in NJ is Dems.
@ElectProject @ezraklein Grr, ac. "Anti" not "antibiotic".		The NJ proposal is that some districts should have same partisan lean as state as a whole. This tends to mean that in a hypothetical election w/50/50 voters, seats would be 50/50.
@ElectProject Here's an example of an antibiotic tweet from @ezraklein:	https://t.co/oRnbiAV9uw		Unfair. As I said, there are valid arguments against, but framing this as an obvious power grab or counterposing w/R shenanigans? Ridiculous.

@mlatner …and writing facially-neutral rules that are then interpreted through a hands-off body will never reach the highest degree.		Also, I didn't say that NJ was fair game, just that fair game is not the same as balanced. Geneva conventions vs Queensberry rules.

@mlatner Two separate questions:		Is Dem proposal in NJ bad? Yes.		When having to choose, which party should a pro-democracy voter support? Still Dems, even in NJ. GOP is still worse.		Rhetoric that blurs Q2 in order to highlight answer to Q1 is counterproductive IMO.
@mlatner The idea is there's room for pressing your advantage where you have one, without being anti-democracy.		I don't support the NJ proposal, but equating it with outright cheating like WI plays into the latter.
@mlatner I'm positing a hypothetical law which forces highly gerrymandered (ie, mostly red) to use PR, while leaving blue states with ungerrymandered FPTP (and thus higher leverage for the majority). This is just one example of something that would not be balanced, but still fair game.

Which is:	a) crazy	b) OK for PR		You could dig into crosstabs and glean some predictive power from this poll. But in the end, that will mostly just move you a hair towards 50/50. No big change.
@2closetocall @VaughnPalmer @BCMikeMcD @davidpball Yes, I agree with Breguet, though I haven't yet looked into today's poll.		I think Breguet's analysis is more principled than McDonald's, though still a little bit ad hoc. With McDonald's, easy for more subconscious bias to creep in.
@mlatner …in my opinion this would still be an ethical response.		All gerrymandering is bad. The worst gerrymanders are utterly unacceptable from either side. But there are gradations, and I don't think unilateral disarmament is any solution.
@mlatner For instance, imagine a Federal law which said "anywhere the map has a projected efficiency gap of over 2%, must use proportional representation." This could result in gerrymandered red states with 1% votes≈1% seats, while blue states had 1% votes=2% seats. Not Queensberry but…
@mlatner I'm not trying to defend this as in any remote sense an actually good idea. It's not! I'm just saying that "NJ Democrats are being as bad as Republicans" is a bad take.
@mlatner Effective gerrymandering means packing a few districts and cracking many to safe margins (say, 8% in an "average" year). This proposal makes at most 12% of districts effectively "cracked", with another 12% in bona fide contention. Still gerrymandering but &lt;&lt;&lt; NC, WI, etc.
@mlatner Bad take.		There are good-faith arguments both for and against the NJ Democratic proposal here, from the perspective of voting rights and representation. There are no good-faith arguments for Republicans cutting polling places and making voting harder. This is not "both sides".

@2closetocall @winstonewert So far, this poll is basically only reducing the SD of my estimate, not really shifting the point estimate. I still estimate just under 51% "yes", with an SD of just under 1.5, and odds just over 2:1 of winning.
@2closetocall @winstonewert You can combine this poll with your previous estimates... it would not be exactly the same as just averaging the outcome of this poll with the numbers you got using turnout and previous polling, but it would be very similar.
@2closetocall @winstonewert Exactly.		Probably some small % aren't accurate about whether they voted. Mostly faulty memory (ie, sealed the envelope but never dropped it off, or voted early then forgot about it). There may be age bias in this accuracy but trying to correct for this would make things worse.
@2closetocall @winstonewert (Further reweighting, I mean.)		There is probably some sampling bias in this poll, but it's very hard to guess which direction it points in. Fiddling with ages is the last thing that's needed.
@2closetocall @winstonewert Disagree. You'll just get fewer "didn't vote" from the 18-34 in this poll than you will from 35-54. You can then use all the "did vote" answers without further weighting.
@2closetocall @winstonewert Certainly, the differential turnout by age should be one of the things that actually is handled almost perfectly correctly by the weighting; should not require further correction. Partisan, regional, income breakdown: not so much. But nearly impossible to correct for that.
@2closetocall @winstonewert Their weighting should work fine as long as, within each age group, responding to the poll and (anything that affects) voting behavior are independent. Which probably isn't true, but I can't see any reason to a priori assume it's wrong in a particular direction.

@jacksantucci Wow, that's a bad article. Aside from misdefining all its terms&amp;not understanding current institutional brakes on fragmentation (!), it ignores the fact that if Dems passed proportional representation (bc GOP surely won't), they [c/sh/w]ould build in new brakes on fragmentation.
@jacksantucci Or one party (Democrats) that saw PR as a way to overcome an institutional disadvantage (gerrymandering) that they'd beaten, perhaps temporarily, at one level (Congress), but which persisted at another (states). As in 1832 UK.
@2closetocall I guess. Seems weak to me.		If you really care about fixing that, you can do a PLACE-style "extra territory" thing, so each district/party combination has a sympathetic representative. Purely cosmetic but makes it clear how it actually makes representation fairer.
@2closetocall My 2 proposed fixes add 0 ballot complexity to Bavarian-style, while (I'd argue) completely fixing tactical issues in practice. So the only remaining downside versus best loser is the bigger ballot. If voters care about that, they choose DMP; if it's MMP, should be Bavarian IMO.
@2closetocall It's about accountability. Best losers has more accountability than NZ-style closed list, but I'd argue it's still closer to that than to Bavarian-style. I can almost guarantee it'd be an anti-#ProRep talking point in the follow-up referendum.		So would complexity—in either case.
@2closetocall Anyway, all parties have committed to "open list" MMP. Baden-style is arguably open, but also arguably closed; borderline. Could be seen as breaking a promise. Bavarian is very clearly open.
@2closetocall Counterpoint: more voter choice brings more voter engagement. If you are from minority group X and are more excited to vote for a candidate from your own group, Bavarian-style lets you; Baden doesn't. Would improve turnout and thus be "stickier".
@2closetocall Bavarian one has complex rules and scary-looking ballots, but is plenty simple for voters. Choose one of the 7 candidates above the line, and/or one of the 50 below the line (with columns by party that extend above &amp; below the line). Much easier than STV here in Cambridge.
@2closetocall I think that if DMP wins, then great; people should get DMP, with first-loser dynamics.		But if they vote for MMP, they shouldn't get a version of MMP that might as well be DMP. The main difference of open-list MMP from DMP is more choice and less simplicity. Don't dilute that.
@2closetocall In your version, voters can in theory still always hold any specific MLA accountable. They just can't do that without also punishing that MLA's party. That means that in practice, personally-unpopular MLAs can still be sure of winning if the district is partisan enough.
@2closetocall @throwahwhay The reason DMP is more proportional than MMP isn't the % of list MLAs; that should only matter in cases of highly-fragmented parties, which hopefully wouldn't happen in BC. It's that DMP has province-wide proportionality, while it's been stated that MMP would be regional.
@2closetocall Safe seats; lacks accountability.
Postscript on improvement 1: this also allows voters who like party X but hate the local X candidate to cast a fully-effective vote by simply leaving the local half blank. That means parties can't guarantee a "safe seat" for unpopular insiders; good accountability. #BCpoli #PR4BC
Here's the math on that. New districts = 60% of 87 seats = 53, leaving 34 top-up seats. That could be 4 regions of 12-13 districts and 8-9 top-ups each. Thus, 11-12 candidates/party besides the local one.

ps. I also think that if MMP is chosen, there should be 4-6 regions, so that the regional candidate lists are at most 8-12 candidates/party (plus 0-1 local candidate/party).
Summary:		If MMP is chosen, anything less than a basic Bavarian-style system is unacceptable. I think most experts would agree.		I think there are 2 improvements, inspired by STV, that would make this system even better for the BC context. Want to hear from other experts.		13/13
In #BCpoli, one can easily foresee the Conservative party splitting from the Liberals under #ProRep. Without this improvement, vote-splitting tactics could then easily give those two parties disproportionate representation. Not as bad as FPTP, but still worth fixing.	12/
Second improvement: if a voter's choice for local candidate wins, then party proportions are calculated as if their regional vote were for same party.		This helps ensure local candidates use up closer to a full Droop quota of voting power; reduce vote-splitting incentives.	11/
This would be popular with BC voters who like independent candidates—a tradition I think Bavaria mostly lacks.		Also helps avoid the Poland/Hungary problem, where thresholds &amp; party fragmentation on one side means many wasted votes and false majorities for the other side.	10/
This is like transferring votes for eliminated candidates in STV. It would have the effect of reducing the incentive to ignore smaller parties, as long as you cast your other vote for a larger party.	9/
First improvement: if 1 of the 2 votes on a ballot goes to a party which gets no seats (or to an independent who isn't seated), the party proportions should be recalculated as if that voter had cast both of their votes for the other party they chose.	8/
I believe that the BC system should be loosely based on the Bavarian, with the ballot format discussed above; I think experts are likely to unanimously agree that's a solid (or best?) option.		I also believe that there should be 2 improvements, inspired by STV. Let's discuss:	7/

So, one task for us experts/wonks is to develop a better mockup of a sample ballot, with an explanation of how it would work.		The other task is to discuss possible improvements over the Bavarian system. This will get more speculative, so I'll tag in experts to discuss.	6/#BCpoli
Such a ballot would look a bit daunting; could easily have over 60 candidates on it, though any voter would probably just be choosing from 7 parties locally and then from 11 regional candidates within a party. Can ignore other 50 names.	5/
The best image I could find of the kind of ballot you'd use is this one, but it's not perfect. There should be around 7 parties (inc. ind); &amp; assuming 7 regions, up to 12 candidates/party. Also, the local party X cand should line up with the regional ones; no dup names.	4/ https://t.co/oi0V5e13am
Experts should speak out, to make sure that if MMP is chosen, such a system is considered an absolute minimum baseline. For instance, we don't want strong ballot-splitting incentives that come from using only the regional vote to calculate party proportions (as in eg Wales.)	3/
Party leaders have unanimously promised an open-list system. As far as I know, voting method experts unanimously agree that such a system should be modeled on Bavaria. Two votes, local and regional; party proportions calculated by weighting both halves equally.	2/#BCpoli
My expected outcome for the #BCreferendum is about 51% yes; my uncertainty has a standard deviation of about 1.5%. That translates to around 75% chance of #ProRep passing, and if it does, I think MMP is the likely (&gt;80%) option. So it's time to set expectations for MMP.	1/#BCpoli

@MalcolmBaalman @benraue @massivetotoro To put it more simply:		For 6 seats, STV has more depth of choice, but PLACE is simpler for voters.		For 18 seats, PLACE is both simpler and more choice (breadth &amp; depth) than STV6*3. Fully dominates.
@MalcolmBaalman @benraue @massivetotoro Second reason: summability. Makes it easier &amp; more secure to count ballots, and eases risk-limiting audits. Not as big a deal as having more&amp;simpler choice, but still a nice bonus.	/4/end
@MalcolmBaalman @benraue @massivetotoro In fact, letting voters choose any of the candidates for (say) 20 seats may give them more effective choice even if their first choice doesn't win. Yes, they don't determine transfers, but wealth of options makes up for it.	/3
@MalcolmBaalman @benraue @massivetotoro Simplifies voting effectively. STV may be OK for 3 or even 9 seats at a time (as here in Cambridge), but unwieldy with more. Thus predeclared transfers enable maximum voter choice at the top of the ballot, where it matters most. 	/2

@Melway_27_J3 @massivetotoro @jacksantucci ②: Gove-like. Allow "bullet BTL" voting, where you choose one candidate, and thus send your vote down that candidate's personal (not party-determined) transfer order. Brings up issues (how to stop parties from too much whipping?) but it's an idea.
@Melway_27_J3 @massivetotoro @jacksantucci OK, I get that. That brings up 2 ways to possibly rescue my idea.	①: Split ATL vote into fractions that transfer to each in a tier. This ends up amounting to almost the same thing as transferring to the strongest candidate in a tier. (Tier=party, or group of parties)
@Melway_27_J3 @massivetotoro @jacksantucci Why doesn't the whole idea of ATL have this same problem?
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard Final idea for AU: hybrid ATL/BTL voting. Could rank each candidate in some parties, while also ranking other entire parties ATL. Idea needs work (might be hard to explain/lead to high informals) but if I were an Australian voter I'd definitely like to have this option. /end
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard As for thresholds, it's not a new idea. In AU, I'd consider higher territory/province thresholds rather than lower national ones. Similar to PLACE 25% district threshold; very high, but local. A party has many chances to pass it; even 10% statewide passes 25% locally sometimes.
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard You could also do tiering for inter-party transfers. For instance, each party gets 2 tiers (+1 bottom), with at least 2 parties in any occupied tier. So party A might put parties B &amp; C in tier 1, D &amp; E in tier 2, and F-Z at bottom. If A is gone, votes go to strongest of B/C, etc.
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard These two basic ideas — thresholds and tiered transfers — could work in the Australian case too. An example of tiered transfers would be if ATL votes went within-party not in some predetermined list order but to whichever party candidate currently held most votes (doing BTL 1st)
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard But minor party wins through snowballing preferences are prevented in 2 ways. ①, any candidate without 25% of local district votes is eliminated up-front. Boom; no more winners without some serious localized support. ②, predeclared preferences are tiers, not strict preferences.
@jacksantucci @massivetotoro @Melway_27_J3 @AntonyGreenABC @Aussie4Q @theblabberdook @AustralianLabor @LiberalAus @Greens @KristinEberhard Here's PLACE: https://t.co/iPTvsc5Zcg		Voters choose just one candidate. If that candidate is eliminated, vote is transferred; first to candidate's strongest "faction ally" within their party, then to strongest remaining in same party, then to strongest "coalition ally" outside.

@laderafrutal (I mean, the article's criticism of IRV is bad, because sometimes a "most-popular first-choice option" shouldn't win. Sorry, just saying "that's bad" was unclear.)
@laderafrutal This is true; it's called center squeeze. STAR voting would be a better solution here; allows center option to be eliminated if it's got weak support from two sides, but also allows two sides to compromise while still voting honestly. 2/end

@2closetocall @davidpball @PrStash @David_Moscrop @kevinmilligan No no no! Controlling for other variables in the regression should help in most cases (though there are important exceptions), but it very rarely solves the problem completely. You'd need to do a sensitivity analysis to see if plausible amounts of confounding could explain this.
@2closetocall @David_Moscrop @PrStash @davidpball @kevinmilligan There's an issue with correlation/causation here. Especially because your "when did they get the ballot" measures by "when did they pass 1%" — selecting on the observed. You should do whatever possible to rule that out. But if you do, and it persists, then yes, big deal.
@ella_mahony I don't think you get the point of the thread. It's not "organizing is hard", it's "people saying that economic issues are the One Weird Trick for winning the WWC don't actually know the WWC". So she's not reporting on where she could get them to, but where they started out.
@2closetocall yeah. Which suggests that the lib riding turnout is mostly actual libs.		I'd still like to see the full regression including %2017 as a predictor (as well as age, region), as before.
@2closetocall Oh, well. That was too much to hope for, I guess.		That would have made me confident of a win; the fact it's not as I hoped simply leaves it, um, too close to call.

@BillTieleman Bavaria is the probable model for BC. Voters there reorder the list enough so that 20-25% of candidates who would win based on list position are replaced by others voters like more. Even top list slot loses sometimes. Seems OK to me; party is right 75% of the time but not always.

@MalcolmBaalman @GeoffreyHPowell @jacksantucci @Master0fNull @MITelectionlab Basically, you can successfully blur the STV/IRV distinction when both are small or far off. But as you come closer to actual big wins, each fights on its own, and tying them together becomes an impediment not an advantage.
@MalcolmBaalman @GeoffreyHPowell @jacksantucci @Master0fNull @MITelectionlab ...for insatance, the recent US media support for the Fair Rep Act is quite impressive! But I fear that this strategy is short-sighted. STV can't ever pass US House of Reps; too disruptive. And IRV does nothing about gerrymandering.
@MalcolmBaalman @GeoffreyHPowell @jacksantucci @Master0fNull @MITelectionlab I find the deliberate shell game between 1-winner RCV (IRV) and multi-winner RCV (STV) to be a rhetorical dead end. Advocates convince themselves that making progress on the former moves us towards the latter. And early on, it looks as if they're right...
@Master0fNull Note that it's debatable whether approval would have fixed the problem in Burlington on the first try, though it's easy for voters to fix it in long term equilibrium. STAR voting almost certainly gets it right 1st time; only way Condorcet winner loses is if they're very meh.
@Master0fNull RCV advocates point to track record in places like the Bay Area or Australia, where center squeeze apparently never happens (I think?) to say this is not a problem. Supporters of alternate systems (approval, STAR, etc) point to Burlington, or BC, to argue their systems are better
@Master0fNull A related phenomenon can happen with 2-round runoffs, where a centrist Condorcet winner doesn't make it to the last round. That's happened several times in modern French elections and arguably in Egypt 2012 (with disastrous consequences). Again, never happens in some places.
@Master0fNull The most common form of this is called "center squeeze". 3 strong candidates, middle is eliminated then left or right wins. Happens in some places (Burlington 2009, BC 1953) almost the first time RCV1 is used, while other places (Bay Area) seem immune; based on party structure?

@Ridgeline33 @BillTieleman @stuartlosaltos @RegretGreeNDP @LizaYuzda @NoBCProRep Turnout threshold of at least 40% of voters would have been good but it looks as if turnout will pass that so this point is moot.
@Ridgeline33 @BillTieleman @stuartlosaltos @RegretGreeNDP @LizaYuzda @NoBCProRep Not taking closed list off the table up front was a stupid mistake, but later statements from all party leaders that open list is better merely acknowledge BC voters' clear preference from multiple polls, commissions, assemblies, etc. There's nothing undemocratic here.
@Ridgeline33 @BillTieleman @stuartlosaltos @RegretGreeNDP @LizaYuzda @NoBCProRep I organized https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb so I have some insight into why the referendum is structured as it is.

@BrianMarlatt @BillTieleman @beachmagoo More voters supported #ProRep in 2005 than voted against it in 2009.

@SuzanneAnton @NoBCProRep Well-designed #ProRep (with thresholds, interparty transfers, and/or incentives to predeclare coalitions) actually minimize this problem. Of the #PR4BC options, DMP has 1 of these mechanisms, RUP has 2, MMP has 1 or 2. But it's a problem in any democratic system, &amp; worse in FPTP.
@SuzanneAnton @NoBCProRep FPTP provides disproportionate influence to single-interest factions within the governing party (eg, anti-abortion in US GOP), and to swing groups that party's chasing (eg, UKIP pre-Brexit-ref). Since they tend to represent fewer voters, problem is worse under FPTP than under PR.

@2closetocall Yes, the lib vote thing. Note that the age thing is relative to past turnout, not relative to population numbers, which would be better.		I should probably shut up and multiply, though.
@benwansell My hierarchical Dirichlet ("crosscat") models suggest Condorcet cycles happen less than 5% of the time with human candidates. But the incentives in this case probably amplify that probability; the May deal is specifically crafted to be preferable to no deal, but not to remain.
RT @benwansell: Ha ha ha ha ha! We are so screwed. Condorcet FTW https://t.co/FgUARfGkhn
@2closetocall These numbers don't make me very optimistic. I haven't multiplied everything out by the crosstabs, but my gut says it comes out worse than the graphs you've been showing.
@2closetocall Yes, see following tweet.
@2closetocall If I'm right, that's probably very slightly good for PR (on the order of 2% delta margin) because turnout is slightly higher than expected among pro-PR groups. Which makes this essentially a 50/50 race from where I'm sitting.		Why does it have to be so close? https://t.co/3cMQ636oat
@2closetocall In other words, if a given age group was 60% yes in polls, then I'd expect them to be &gt;60% yes in practice, because the mushy middle is less likely to turn out. But that goes both directions!
@2closetocall I think this election will not be won at the margins (how undecideds break) but in the base (turnout). To this point, I'd actually expect polls to underestimate crosstab margins in BOTH directions.
@2closetocall What if you replace "won by liberals" indicator with "percent liberal vote"? More fine-grained; more informative.
@DataProgress @A_agadjanian Interesting, and I could think of stories to explain this. But the "district previously won by rep" parameter makes me shudder; does this mean you're not using the previous 2-party vote total as a covariate? If not, I don't trust anything about this model.
@laderafrutal @JamesConran1 I think "irrational" is a bit strong in this case. Clearly R and D were going to be the finalists in ME-2, so for those voters, including lower ranks is about expression, not instrumental rationality.		In the long run, that won't always be clear. But in this case, it was.
@SuzanneAnton @DouglasTodd @NoBCProRep I'll explain with small words.		If more than half of voters want something, they should get it. If they change their mind, fine, that's democracy.		If less than half get power and do a thing, then a different &lt;1/2 undo it, that's policy lurch.		Do you get it now?		#bcpoli #PR4BC
@ordinarytimemag @rudnicknoah Pros: semiproportional is better than FPTP.		Cons: WTH? You're smarter than this. What happens when a superstar candidate soaks up all of one party's votes?

@BillTieleman @PlanetsFuture @fairvotebc @CapStudentUnion @SFSS1 @SFUStudentLife @AMS_UBC So it's possible that the questionnaire could be slightly biased.

They've done the best they can, better than 0.
@BillTieleman @PlanetsFuture @fairvotebc @CapStudentUnion @SFSS1 @SFUStudentLife @AMS_UBC The questionnaire asks you to say how much you value various goals, then tells you which voting method is most likely to best satisfy those values. There is room for bias in which goals they ask you about, and in how well it thinks each voting method is to satisfy those goals.

RT @LesliBoldt: Ballot returns are at 32% - we cracked a million ballots. Keep it up, BC! #pr4bc #bcpoli #ProRep
@MaxwellACameron Just because it's better than standard "no" fearmongering, doesn't = balanced. A comparison of anti-immigrant parties under FPTP vs pro-rep that doesn't include the Republicans is... missing the elephant in the room, shall we say? And read Pilon's essay on underlying scholarship.
The main #NoBCProRep spokesperson: wrong in every regard.		Trump's party holds power in the US through FPTP. You'd thing Bill wouldn't want to draw attention to this fact.		#bcpoli #pr4bc https://t.co/eg4iKGVDuB
@BillTieleman @Scotty_Evil @xGAfletcher "FPTP" is a term used in Westminster countries to refer to a set of separate choose-one elections in each district. Under that system, Trump's party would have won in 2016. You're referring to the national popular vote, which Canada would hate.		Delete your account. 		#BCpoli
@BillTieleman @Scotty_Evil @xGAfletcher Wrong. Republicans currently have a 236 seats, Democrats have 195. Even among the incoming class, though Republicans are a minority, they have about 5% more seats than their share of the popular vote, because of FPTP (gerrymandering).

@BillTieleman In US and UK, the far right peaked in 2016 when they won their issues and delivered body blows to democracy. In most of Europe, they're still frozen out of real power by PR, which is a GOOD thing. In Poland and Hungary, they won throuh false majorities, then changed the rules.

@JohnMartinMLA In FPTP, there would be no regular-season play, because fans would have to strategically pick the two frontrunners based on polling. #GreyCup would be Calgary vs. Toronto, every year, forever.
@BillTieleman @DonovanCavers …even if he's right, it's not an advantage. Bourbon France had just one person to lobby—the king—but an entire court of "lobbyists". In modern case, fewer parties might mean fewer lobbyists, but also more influence for lobbyists vs voters.		And that's if it's true. No evidence!
@BillTieleman @DonovanCavers In FPTP, a single party representing a minority of voters often gets 100% of the power. Lobby them, and you're done.		In #ProRep, governing coalitions would represent over 50% of voters. Sometimes means more parties.		Bill says fewer parties=fewer lobbyists. Could be true, but…
@BillTieleman @Cdnrumpole @WhatAboutJDR @WesternEduc @Jimnelson806 @bcliberals In FPTP, party platforms themselves are a result of back-room negotiations. 		Any system has winners&amp;losers, and it's impossible to put millions of voters into a room to hash out a governing agenda. Difference is, under #ProRep, at least 50% of voters are represented in the room.
@ThomasHall17 @GeoffreyHPowell @the5thColumnist @BillTieleman OK, let's avoid emotional terms like "wasted votes" or "absurd hyperbole".		In BC's FPTP, 50% of votes help elect an MLA.		In NZ's #ProRep, 95% of votes do.		These are facts. I think that "wasted votes" adequately describes these facts. If you disagree, what term would you use?
@BillTieleman In general, the definition of "anti-immigrant parties" she (and Loewen) use is fundamentally biased to ignoring cases like the US Republicans that arise in FPTP. In FPTP, changes in party system are likely to happen by existing parties shifting their platform, which she ignores.
@BillTieleman Elliott falsely claims that "average seat-share of anti-immigrant parties in PR countries is 100 times lower in majoritarian countries like ours." Not counting the US Republican party as explicitly anti-immigrant might have been excusable in 2008, but in 2018 it's ludicrous.
@BillTieleman In other words, Loewen is NOT a neutral voice. Has anti-#ProRep axe to grind. There's nothing unscholarly about writing a contrarian article, but editing a book that purports to be neutral while giving short shrift to one side of the argument is not good scholarship.

@2closetocall Even though you can't actually do logistic regression, it's a fair way to think about this. Basically, I'd guess that new voters are about 1 log odds unit more likely to be "yes" than their precinct's baseline. That would be enough to shift ~50% to ~75% (odds factor of ~3).
@2closetocall I think you should probably go with 75%; 85% is possible but optimistic.		75% seems reasonable given that they're probably relatively young and/or unlikely to be committed Liberal or NDP partisans.
@2closetocall Right, 0.56% total. But you were probably already projecting them as over 50% yes, so if they're more like 85% yes, then that's roughly net 0.2% over your projections.
I'd bet a strong majority of these new voters registered in order to vote for #PR4BC. This could move your projected margin by 0.2% or so. And given how close things are when you project out to end of voting, that could be the winning margin. https://t.co/HYybDc7Ttn

@2closetocall @johnVcorbett @David_Moscrop @davidpball @PrStash @DevonRowcliffe @fairvotebc @FairVoteCanada Since all three party heads have promised no closed lists, none of the 3 options will be list-based.

@banalltaxes (And this has nothing to do with "left" versus "right". Democracy is democracy.)
@banalltaxes Not every party can be a winner; only some will form part of a governing majority.		Almost every voter can be represented, though. That's the ideal of a democratic republic; it's what #ProRep does; and it's what FPTP completely fails to do.

@markkelly62755 @BillTieleman Look at Ontario or the USA. FPTP allows extremism to fester and take over a major party. Pro-rep puts it in the sunlight, at arm's length.		Also, 5-8% threshold is higher than you might think.
@Cdnrumpole @markkelly62755 @BillTieleman Actually, 5% is the low end of the threshold; in practice, probably more like 8% at a regional level. Even harder for a small party to pass. But once you pass, you get more than 1 seat.

Again, that last point is just speculation. It could just be that rich old media executives share the biases of other rich old people. But it's undeniable that, for whatever reason, #PR4BC reformers face a headwind of media bias. Luckily, the arguments are easy to refute.	12/end
Since none of these 5 arguments hold up, why is the #BCpoli media generally biased against #ProRep? This is speculation, but I think it might have to do with $. Pro-rep would reduce $ in politics; can't just buy off a frontrunner. And that $ eventually goes to ad spending.	11/
Summing up their 5 arguments:	①Previous referendums… in which more voted "yes"!	②Fringe parties… just like FPTP in USA, Ontario! 	③Partisan process… politics SHOULD have advocates on both sides.	④Details… trivial now that all parties promise open lists.	⑤Turnout…👍	10/
Last (5th) argument: threshold. "A small percentage of the population could change our voting system."	This is based on the idea that turnout would be low. But so far, it's smashing turnout records for previous 2 vote-by-mail #BCreferendum s, both of which passed 50%.	9/ https://t.co/7xCDke6WpF
For instance, @NoBCProRep likes to fearmonger about how riding boundaries would be worked out after the election; as if that wasn't something that already happens every 10 years under FPTP. Chill out, guys.	8/
Argument 4: "Details aren't worked out."	Finally, something that's not pure BS. I agree, the vagueness doesn't help here. But now that all 3 parties have promised that MMP would have open, not closed, lists, the remaining unresolved details are trivial.	7/
In fact, by bending over backwards to try to avoid the appearance of bias, Eby created a process biased *against* passage. He convinced nobody of his neutrality; muted the NDP's legitimate role as a #ProRep advocate; and opened himself up to attacks like this one.	Be a lawyer!	6/
Argument 3: "How badly the NDP has handled the issue and how partisan the process has become."	Fundamentally misreads the situation by casting Eby as a biased judge. The real judge here is @ElectionsBC; voters=jury; and Eby's *correct* role was as an advocate for "yes".	5/
Argument 2a: "Canada routinely ranks among the world's top countries for quality of life."	That's true! Let's look at such a ranking, shall we? 	4/ https://t.co/GdnIXGJf5t
Second argument: "PR allows the emergence of extremist fringe parties."	It's possible, though the #PR4BC options are all better than average at keeping them out. But FPTP can allow extremist factions to take over major parties &amp; get power with a minority. Look at USA, Ontario.	3/
First argument: "We've done this before, and it didn't pass." But no mention of vote totals. In 2005, 58% yes on 61% turnout (981419 yes votes); in 2009, 61% no on 55% turnout (971353 no votes). In other words, more BCians voted yes than no. Relevant fact! Why leave it out?	2/
The #BCpoli media has been consistently biased against #ProportionalRepresentation/#ProRep. Exceptions exist, but far more coverage of "no" arguments than "yes". So, time for a response thread. I'll take https://t.co/BxMpgEbW8H as an example.	1/

We should all be grateful to @Ocasio2018 for her supposed gaffe about the "3 chambers of government" (Senate, House, and White House). In the modern polarized age this trinity is what it takes to pass federal laws, we need a term for it, and "3 chambers" does nicely.
@2closetocall @winstonewert Green's doing fine. If this fails, it will be on the NDP.		Not over yet. Get out the vote!
@BillTieleman It was bad for parties trying to get an unfair advantage; good for voters. The "cautionary tale" is that FPTP lets parties live on safe seats and past glory, while reformed systems make them more accountable to changing conditions.
@2closetocall Oh no sorry. Didn't see what you were responding to. This screenshot is not logistic, not using special ecological math; just OLS.
@2closetocall Key words are "ecological inference"; "logistic" is a detail, often unsaid.
@2closetocall If this analysis is right, the biggest way for @VotePRBC/@fairvotebc/@fairvotingbc to win this referendum is to activate more NDP voters. Otherwise, my best guess is close loss.		My confidence in this is low, though; based on untestable assumptions.
@2closetocall I suspect it's actually something like 1.0% and 0.1%. Which, coincidentally, would be the numbers that put the referendum at almost exactly 50/50. Add in the small portion of age effect that isn't already caught by partisanship, and you get around 49/51.
@2closetocall In other words: imagine higher sum coefficient for lib than NDP is actually "for every lib in your district you get 0.8% lib votes/day and 0.3% NDP votes/day" then that's a lot more NDP votes than pure model. Or 1.5% and negative 0.4%, a lot fewer.
@2closetocall ANY inference using this data relies on the assumption that a certain voter type behaves the same independently of who their neighbors are. Eg, a lib in a lib district = lib in green district. Almost certainly at least somewhat violated, which is good for prospects of passage.
@2closetocall Don't look at these coefficients solo.	ndays is how many independent voters vote per day.	(ndays + ndays:ndp) is how many NDP voters vote per day.	Etc.	Non-sig ndays:green means that green and independent voters are similar.
@2closetocall 	bc[,ndays:=daysoverone - 1]	m3 = lm(turnout15riding ~ ndays + ndays : (ndp + lib + green), bc) https://t.co/wM4IdLRpNj
@rudnicknoah You missed "anti-'anti'-pelosi". You know, as in "I hate AOC now that I realized she hates Pelosi."		Pro-Pelosi is fine, but the anti-"anti"s are the worst.
I did correct for the different amount of time since people got their ballots. Which, frankly, shouldn't have to matter. Deadline should be extended by 2 weeks to make sure everyone has maximum chance to vote. Time for previous 2 vote-by-mail referendums was longer; match it.
Should have said "estimate", not "find", because this kind of model should be taken with a grain of salt. In particular, it's likely to overfit; to overestimate group differences. Still, it's pretty clear that as of now, this referendum stands or falls on Green turnout; NDP=MIA.
Using a model that assumes that each party's voters are voting at a constant percentage per day after the 2nd, I find that Greens vote at 2.0%/day, Libs at 1.1%/day, and NDPs at 0.3%/day. #BCpoli #PR4BC #BCreferendum 		(caveats to follow...)
Because the lower mainland got their ballots last, younger voters (18-25) have almost half a day less to vote on average than the oldest voters (65+). Almost as if they didn't want you to vote.

Extend the deadline by two weeks, and turnout would level off; the difference would be negligible.		@ElectionsBC, the @NoBCProRep campaign has already asked for an extended deadline. In the name of fairness and legitimacy, I think it's important to do so.		cc:@YesPRBC as well.
So these "small" discrepancies in time between recieving ballots and end of referendum could add up to meaningful bias in the outcome. Given polling crosstabs, I wouldn't be surprised if this shifted final margins by several tenths of a percent—as much as 0.5%.
These differences may not sound like much, but historically in the referendums for HST and Transportation, after 1 month of voting, ballots were still pouring in—averaging between 1% and 2.5% add'l turnout/day. Didn't start to level off until around 35 days.
Thanks to @2closetocall, I'm looking at turnout data for the #BCreferendum. Because ballots were sent out to the lower mainland last, the average NDP voter has had 0.2 fewer days to vote than the average Lib voter. Average young voter .4 fewer days than the average old voter.
@2closetocall OK, so the average NDP voter has had 10.97 days to vote in your data. Average Lib voter, 11.17. Average Green voter, 11.43.		0.2 of a day doesn't sound like much, but it's enough to bias final outcome margin detectably; rough estimate, about 0.3%. This could end up that close.
@2closetocall firstname dot lastname at gmail		(I'll dm it too, but it's not exactly private)
@2closetocall Hmm... easier to just take weighted average of days directly. "The average lib has had X days to vote, average NDP has had Y". Assuming .7% turnout per day and final turnout of around 40%, 1 extra day translates to on the order of 2% more voting power. I'd say &gt;3% dif is too big.
@2closetocall OK to figure out what these numbers mean, you also need the weighted average of the party totals, weighted by each party total. As in "the average lib lives in a district that's x% lib".
@2closetocall yes sure, thanks. Including all your covariates, right?
@2closetocall Just checking: a district with 44% NDP, 33% Lib, 23% Green would have .44, .33, .22 for those variables, right?
@2closetocall (sorry, I don't want to be bossy. Feel free to tell me to shut up if you want)
@2closetocall Hmm. What about those same numbers as regression? That is, treat number of days as outcome, and three party vote portions as predictors.
@2closetocall If one party has systematically been given more days to vote on average, that's a good argument for extending the deadline, to give everyone who wants to every chance to vote.
@2closetocall Not the interaction term in the regression (though that's also interesting). I'm talking about the raw correlation between just those variables. Voting days with NDP%, with Green%, with Lib%.
@2closetocall Also, party vote with voting days? If this correlation is too high, it would be a *strong* argument for extending voting deadline! This could be your most important finding!
@2closetocall Agreed, I think.
@2closetocall Yeah, my worry is that it's just soaking up stuff that properly SHOULD go in the 55-64.		What's the correlation between age groups and voting days? ie, not looking at "outcome" at all.
@2closetocall This makes me worry that your model is tying itself in knots to try to fit this. Concave up is not very consistent with the historical graph from bc elections, so something funny is going on.
@2closetocall Can I see a screenshot?
@2closetocall Hmm... also, I'd try replacing ALL your non-voting-days coefficients with the same things, interacted with voting days.		In other words: not true that 55-64yolds have 40% higher turnout. More like, they have x% higher turnout per day.		Could try including both terms and interacts
@2closetocall Just quadratic. Cubic would be overkill for this data.
@2closetocall Yeah. Ideally, you should be doing ecological logistic regression, but I have no idea how to do that in stata.		I think that it's not super-important to switch to logit given the range of values and coefficients you're seeing. I would add a squared term on voting days, though.
@2closetocall Units on this are log odds (logit)? Why is the constant term only -.129, then? That would imply much higher average turnout than 21%... I'm confused.

@PeejLoewen @sean_gra @Adam_Stirling @VaughnPalmer @robshaw_vansun Yes, ballot is suboptimal in terms of giving maximum flexibility to express nuanced opinions. But it's not invalid. If you don't prefer all 3 options, vote "no" on Q1, then rank on Q2.		They made a tradeoff with simplicity. You can disagree. But the legal challenge is specious.
Due to postal strike chaos, #pr4bc/#nobcprorep deadline should be extended to give at least as much time as HST #bcreferendum had. @NoBCProRep has asked for this and for once I agree with them.

@MaxwellACameron @robshaw_vansun @PeejLoewen @Adam_Stirling @Dave_Eby Though Eby did not explicitly promise that MMP would be Bavarian, it was always my expectation that that was most likely if MMP is chosen.

@MaxwellACameron @robshaw_vansun @PeejLoewen @Adam_Stirling @Dave_Eby Regarding MMP, we recommended basing it on the Bavarian (open-list) system.

@beachmagoo @BernardoVerda @laurelrusswurm Single-winner ("majoritarian") methods never do a good job of representation. It's not what they're for.

@beachmagoo @BernardoVerda @laurelrusswurm In the US, FairVote is promoting "Ranked Choice Voting" (RCV) as an umbrella term for STV (multi-winner RCV) and IRV/AV/PV (single-winner RCV).

@DeathCar72 @jbouie Only 6 possible orderings for the kids. Unless you allow subsets; then there's another 9. The only way the math works is to allow subsets of at least two, and to include one kid with weak legs and one fat kid. The weak-legged kid can still be in the middle under the fat one.

@PoliticsWolf Yeah, but your suggestion (several senators per state per cycle) would mean expanding to as many as 9 senators per state. That would make the EC way more broken.		A winner-take-all EC would be broken even without the extra-votes-per-state. But that's no excuse to make it worse.
@PoliticsWolf In other words, Senate would not be a place for partisan fights (president's party would always win party-line votes), but rather a place for cross-partisan work that protects federalism. More like what the founders intended.
@PoliticsWolf Any change to the Senate requires a constitutional amendment. And expanding it makes the electoral college worse.		I'd keep 2 senators per state, but have them elected simultaneously via #ProRep (Hare quota). Senate would always be effectively 50/50; VP would break tie.
@PoliticsWolf Another reason to expand the house is to reduce the distortion of the electoral college.
@PoliticsWolf "Biproportional" means you can keep existing single-seat districts, but allow votes to cross district lines to get a proportional outcome. For example, PLACE voting: https://t.co/iPTvsc5Zcg		This has same advantages as multi-seat, but doesn't disrupt incumbents' campaigns. https://t.co/NvohYOlcd4
@PoliticsWolf It's great that people are talking about multi-seat (as in the Fair Representation Act). But politically, it's a dead end. To pass it, you'd need &gt;95% of incumbent Democrats to support it. But it's too disruptive to incumbents to ever get that much.		Biproportional methods can.
@PoliticsWolf Huh?		First off, say "multi-seat districts"; otherwise, "mixed member" and "multi-member" are confusing.		Multi-seat has nothing to do with House size. Mixed-member would fit well with a larger house (because you could keep existing districts).
Moderately expanding the House (to around 750-800) is a good idea for its own reasons. But unless it goes hand-in-hand with a switch to mixed member proportional voting (MMP), it does nothing to stop gerrymandering. https://t.co/CO0MwZ2GzV
@WhatAboutJDR @BestStephen @2closetocall @BillTieleman @SemperSitiens @NoBCProRep The biggest sustained economic growth in history was done using rotary phones. Proof of success is the result. Want one? https://t.co/OifEtjNo5H
I just did a thread on this, but to reiterate:		If #NoBCProRep voters just mark q1, while yes-#PR4BC voters all hold onto ballots until they've marked q2, a few key % of the yes voters won't get around to it. As a statistician, I'm worried. Better to vote 1 q than neither.#BCpoli
Summing up, yes-#PR4BC campaigners should not forget to cover two messages:		① 𝐈𝐭'𝐬 𝐎𝐊 𝐭𝐨 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐞 "𝐲𝐞𝐬" 𝐨𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟏 and ignore question 2.		② #ProRep helps all voters, but 𝐫𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭!		/end #BCpoli
So, for the yes-#PR4BC voices: important to speak to rural voters and answer the dogwhistles head-on. #ProRep has advantages for all, but honestly, 𝐫𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭! eg, FPTP's safe seats are bad for accountability; pro-rep fixes that.	/8
And yes, this is diabolical. Not only is it sowing partisan division and resentment. It represents Liberal party insiders convincing their voting base to vote against their own interests.		(Why does @BillTieleman play along? I dunno; ends justify the means, maybe?)	/7
Second diabolically clever tactic: partisan dogwhistles.		At the level of logic, "this referendum is rigged, puts Vancouver in charge" fails utterly. #ProRep is good for all voters, *especially* rural ones.		But as a divisionary, partisan dogwhistle, it does its job.	/6
So for the yes-#PR4BC side, we have to make sure voters know 𝐢𝐭'𝐬 𝐎𝐊 𝐭𝐨 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐯𝐨𝐭𝐞 "𝐲𝐞𝐬" 𝐨𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟏 if you don't care about question 2. All 3 options mean better democracy. Nothing wrong with letting your wonky friends decide for you.	/5
Not voting question 2 means "no" voters don't study how #ProRep works; keep them in the dark, make sure they don't realize they like it after all. It sets up to delegitimize result if #ProRep wins. It means less homework needed for a "no" vote, which helps boost their turnout.	/4
But they are doing two things that are both smart and diabolical. #1, encouraging their supporters to ignore the second question. This is bad for their supporters—denies them any voice if the referendum ends up "yes". But from @NoBCProRep's PoV, it has several sneaky advantages.
What do I mean by "diabolically clever"? I'm certainly not talking about their logical arguments. I've done several threads picking those apart. On the level of facts and logic, #NoBCProRep's dishonest fearmongering doesn't take much brains. https://t.co/5KgpGDEBKP
With polling on the #BCreferendum tight, I'm beginning to worry that the #NoBCProRep tactics may be diabolically clever. So, here's a thread for the #PR4BC side, to encourage fighting fire with fire. /1
@NeilPDow False.		Under FPTP, 50% of one riding is enough to guarantee a seat. Many win with less than that.		Under pro-rep, no seat anywhere would be won with fewer votes than 90% of a current riding (spread over a region). Higher, not lower, threshold.

Important thing is all 3 are better than FPTP, especially for rural areas, at representation.

C6: Word-for-word same as C5. https://t.co/uD8Vu2BCj2
C5: "Accountability diminished"	All three BC parties have promised no closed lists. This entire argument is based on closed lists. Mendacious, or just ignorant?
C4: "Fascist toehold"	Trump. Ford. I'd rather give fascists a toehold, than a throne.		Also: 1930s examples. In that case PR countries=WWI losers; which of those two led to WWII?
C3: "Paralysis in forming governments"	A parade of cherry-picked "bad things under PR". No comparison of how things can break under FPTP. Also, bad NZ "deputy prime minister" example; he was a figurehead, couldn't change ministers.
(Bonus C2 wrongness: compromise="prostitute". If I say it twice, you might believe it!)
C2: "PR nearly always leads to... backroom deals and prostituted power."	Party platforms = negotiation before the election. Coalition programs = after the election. Either way, some voters get what they want, others don't.		But BC options are nothing like Israel. Bad example.
C1: "PR is not about good government"	I honestly can't even make heads or tails of the logic here. Best I can do is "anyone who doesn't win under FPTP is a loser who deserves their fate", but that couldn't really be what they're saying... could it?
(bonus P3 wrongness: sowing division between the lower mainland and the rest of the province. Actually, #ProRep would have *more* benefits for rural BC, who would have more than one party representing them, and thus would never be entirely frozen out of government.)
P3: "6% of voters could choose":	Yes, if you arbitrarily assume 30% turnout (last vote-by-mail referendum in BC had over 50%), then willfully misunderstand how the ranked choice voting in the second question works (hint: it would be at least half of the people who fully ranked.)
P2: "A rigged choice":	"PR is only option offered". So according to Ian MacLeod, this referendum should have had as many options as a write-your-own-constitution book? "If you want a truly representative republic, turn to p71. If you'd rather give full power to a minority, p20."
P1: "A pig in a poke":	Wrong. There was consultation; the howwevote poll. There is plenty of info about how each method would work; not down to the last detail, but enough for voters to evaluate.
Here comes a thread where I pick apart the hilariously bad reasoning in "The compelling arguments against electoral reform in B.C." : https://t.co/tlr2y96uoL		This consists of 2 separate numbered lists, on process and content. Their numbering is unusable, so I'll do eg P1 or C5.

@FLIEReform I'm assuming that a FL anti-gerrymandering initiative is in the cards, and asking whether you think it would work to have one which consisted of #FairMaps &amp; a #ProRep #CitizensAssembly stapled together.		Too complicated to work? Or just right?
@FLIEReform That's what legislatures were invented to do: deliberate on issues when ordinary citizens don't have time to sweat the details. But there's an obvious problem with using a legislature to deliberate on how to elect that legislature. So the Right Answer is a citizens' assembly.	//
@FLIEReform Yes, we need a deliberative answer. Deciding on common values and designing a proportional method that satisfies those values is doable. But no one person can do it. The smartest person in the world still has a limited point of view. You need deliberation &amp; discussion.	/4

That is to say: do you think it's a good idea to have a single referendum which does two things?	① Create a good #FairMaps redistricting process.	② Create a Citizens' Assembly to study electoral reform and, if they see fit, draft a new initiative. https://t.co/o124ymkqOi	/end

@paulkrugman Good point. But who would base a strategy arount "hare"? https://t.co/yffEYQyuUE
@docbrianS @msue1000 @skantrow 50.3% includes one uncontested race. A nominal Democratic candidate there would surely have gotten enough votes to win a majority; by your logic, enough for 13 D's.
@skantrow Judicial redress, or congressional redress (impose proportional representation on badly-gerrymandered states, under Constitution's "guarantee clause"). Latter would be breaking new legal ground and so would require judicial forbearance. But fully justified if courts don't act.
@warren__terra @washingtonpost Johnny Unbeatable would have won 435+33.
@BillTieleman @sean_gra Not wrong. "Priority" means first in line, but who wins still depends on provincial results.		Imagine a line that goes boyX3, girlX3. If you have to let in 2 boys and 2 girls, it's obvious who. Like that.		Oh wait- your question wasn't sincere though, was it?
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal @fredericksolt No, not true. See "Gregor Sansa"s comment on the blog post in question for another way it could work. Mechanism design &gt; police.
@BillTieleman @artfudd You just answered your own question.		Under FPTP, what will next boundaries be like? When will LA increase in size? How many wasted votes? Will there be entire regions out of government? Is that a MONSTER?		I can ask scary questions too.
@BillTieleman @sean_gra Candidates A1 and A2 together get 10000. If A1 wins, that uses up 5000, leaving 5000 for A2. If B1 has 5001 they have priority over A2. Simple.
@ElectionBabe But then if there is an "approved write-in challenger" (what a strange concept), the race gets flagged as an undervote?
@ElectionBabe Thanks for that thread. Can you do one on signature-matching on absentee ballots? Specifically, what happens when they "don't match" — is the ballot kept in the envelope for later challenges, or is something irrevocable done?
@ElectionBabe Hard to keep track of all this. You're saying there's an undervote problem, not just in the collective Broward numbers, but in the non-absentee portion?		What does the DS 200 do for unopposed races? Possible for a malicious election admin to have flagged Senate as unopposed?
What happens to FL ballots where signatures "don't match"? Are they left in the envelopes?

Whoops: @laderafrutal, ^
P.S. I just commented on the blog (under a nym) about the two tweaks that the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb suggested considering for this system.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal @fredericksolt 3/3	Second: If either half of your ballot goes to a party that would win 0 seats even with those votes, and other half is for different party that did get seats, then recalculate party shares with both halves of your vote to other party. Again, STV-like; cross-party transfer.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal @fredericksolt 2/3	First: If your local choice wins, then for calculating party shares, your local vote counts 1 and your regional vote counts 0. Basically, "uses up" your vote on winner, as in STV. Regional vote still counts for list order.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal @fredericksolt 1/3	Bavarian MMP (local &amp; regional vote each count 1/2 when calculating party share) already reduces this incentive substantially. 2 more tweaks can almost eliminate it:

@jacksantucci Parliamentary reform act of 1832. It's not PR, but it is a voting reform by one united party to level a malapportioned playing field. Like gerrymandering today.
@hill_charlotte @DanSpoko @JakeMGrumbach @fairvote @leedrutman Yes, propotional representation (#ProRep) can do better than separate district elections. But while it requires merging the elections, it doesn't require merging the districts. "Biproportional" methods can elect 1 per district in a proportional way.
I think open #ProRep methods are better than closed ones. Nonetheless, worth a read. https://t.co/1qzsLKQNui
@Noahpinion Senate malapporionment is a bigger effect than gerrymandering. It may be "fine and good" if you have a comfy life and no working uterus but this is a really bad take.
@ctcabin Such as proportional representation, maybe? https://t.co/1QiaCba6v7
@PoliticsWolf It appears that stuff continues to happen. "Will get to it later" is hard to guarantee these days...
@NoBCProRep Wrong. All three parties have said that MMP would be open-list. That is, voters, not parties, would choose top-up MLAs.		Even if you don't trust their word, it is a lie to claim that MMP can only be closed-list.		Please post a correction.
@AskThePatrick @MalcolmBaalman Nope. There's a 1967 law (PL 90-196), passed as an amendment to a bill granting citizenship to a FL guy.		Anyway, there are proportional methods that would still fly — allowing votes and transfers across district lines to give proportionality, but guaranteeing 1 winner/district.

@laderafrutal @jacksantucci @mlatner ENP of 2.08 is not "reinforcing" the two party system.

#ProRep should be called "full representation", because unlike choose-one voting, it represents all voters. That means it's better at representing geography, not worse. But also better at representing other groupings of voters—broad ideological groups, genders, ethnicities, etc. https://t.co/yB1MA3sGMP

Calling it "proportional representation" makes it sound as if it's about making things fair between parties. But it's more than that.

Thanks again to @rudnicknoah for the model I used for initial vote totals.		Note: In this article, I walk through every elimination step of the process. I'll post a less-technical version this weekend.

Yet more alluvial NC election diagrams: here's PLACE versus FPTP. Votes over 50% and losing votes separate out.		In BC, the #nobcprorep campaign has been saying that in #ProRep, your vote will "get lost on the way". As these pics clearly show, actually FPTP is what loses votes. https://t.co/B1TX2pBoK0
@OKBJGM Conservatism? Heritage?
@TheoLandsman @rudnicknoah Now I just have to do a corresponding graph of choose-one voting results (lots of votes in the trash!) and then do graphs of both FPTP and PLACE results for @PoliticsWolf's hypothetical NC gerrymanders, and I'll be done! https://t.co/FCQUyPbKEg
@laderafrutal I guess when it comes to adopting common idioms, I could care less if they make objective sense.
(I'm using the hashtag #ProRep for proportional representation because that's what they're using in BC. But frankly, I think that when the #PR4BC vote is over, I'm going to push for a switch back to the original hashtag, #PropRep.)
cc:@RepDonBeyer. This is actually using a different #ProRep method than your #FairRepAct — simpler for voters, no need for redistricting, easier to estimate counterfactuals, less disruptive, and clearer to plot. But the basic idea is the same. Keep up the good work!
@TheoLandsman @rudnicknoah I did the scraping from https://t.co/3aSaTfIlph manually, but had written about 1/3 of a scraping program using casperjs, if I wanted to scale this up to do every state.
@TheoLandsman @rudnicknoah R: ggplot, ggalluvial, magick, and ~400 lines of code to figure out who approves whom, run PLACE algorithm, then plot it.
So, if NC had #ProRep, probable winners would be: 	D1:@GKButterfield	D2:@LindaForNC	D3:@RepWalterJones	D4:@RepDavidEPrice	D5:@virginiafoxx	D6:@RepMarkWalker	D7:@RepDavidRouzer	D8:@Frank4NC	D9:@McCreadyForNC	D10:@PatrickMcHenry	D11:@RepMarkMeadows	D12:@RepAdams	D13:@KathyManningNC https://t.co/1Z4TuZdovM

@davidshor @CShentrup @ElectionScience @PoliticsWolf @dylanmatt The video Clay linked is also good. And I did write an article related to STAR voting specifically, though it's somewhat inside-baseball: https://t.co/1rWXUmzENw
@davidshor @CShentrup @ElectionScience @PoliticsWolf @dylanmatt My own general voting theory primer may be more than you're looking for, and pitched to a specific "rationalist" audience, but it's the best I can suggest here: https://t.co/utaJM3L5KF
@robshaw_vansun @jjhorgan In BC's howwevote survey to set up referendum, there was an *overwhelming* consensus that MLAs should be accountable to voters, not parties. Legislature committee will know they must listen to that consensus, enact open list MMP, or #ProRep would be rejected after 2 elections.
Green candidate drops out in #AZSen to endorse Sinema. This is admirable, given spoiler dynamics of choose-one voting. But it shouldn't be necessary; we need a better voting method.		@kyrstensinema, will you now endorse voting method reform? For instance, #STARvoting &amp; #ProRep?
@sam_sullivan Completely false. All three pro-rep systems give more voters a role in picking MLAs. All three could *reduce* parties' role.		It's technically possible MMP could be closed list, but unlikely; howwevote survey showed BC voters don't want that. Sam pretends that's only possibility.
@mcpli Next up, Juan Gerardi.
@CShentrup @davidshor @ElectionScience @PoliticsWolf @dylanmatt Actually, I think David has a point. I mean, approval is clearly better than choose-one or ranked choice (elimination) voting. But systematic differences in voter preference strength are a valid concern. It's why I think STAR or 321 are even safer in practice.

@UpdatedPriors Clearly, the US should be more like Norway.
@otis_reid @UpdatedPriors ...and put a parametric assumption on the form of the curve that would make Satan himself quail.
@TimRothSES For instance, here's 3 versions, where eliminations per horizontal step are 3, 2, 1 respectively. Is the left graph better than the right? Worse? The same? https://t.co/PF4K59yZfH
@TimRothSES So my question is, does this message come across? At a glance, does the graph suggest "same amount of each color on each side"? Or does it look like a confusing shell game where votes could easily get lost along the way?
@TimRothSES I guess the point of this kind of graph is to show "nothing up my sleeve", almost all votes count. Compare to similar graph of FPTP, where many votes are uncounted or overcounted.
@WillPierceDude @joshtpm Flick is a sympathetic character. Epstein could have been; this thread shows that she wrestles with demons too. But defeating demons doesn't make you sympathetic if you become something worse, enthusiastically enabling the separation of families and the radicalization of maniacs.
@TimRothSES (Grr, just saw a bug in my graphing code. If you look really close, you see a tiny sliver of R votes going from D6 to D5 at step 12 — long after D6 got a full quota. Those votes actually went to D2 at step 3 and then bounced back at step 12, but my graph doesn't show that.)
@TimRothSES What do you think of the alluvial graph idea? Still needs work, I'd appreciate constructive criticism. https://t.co/UCh4PJtUAR
@BillTieleman 3/As for process: frankly, there are things about this process I don't love. I believe Eby has acted in good faith, but not perfectly. I think that for most voters, bottom line is outcome, not perfect process. But I respect Gibson's position.
@BillTieleman 2/"MMP would mean parties pick MLAs" is your only outright lie. Other than that, you say things that are highly deceptive and 180° wrong in practice ("bad for rural voters") but no lies.
@BillTieleman 1/I know that you sincerely believe that you're just spinning, not lying. But saying "A would cause B" when that's only one possibility is actually a lie. Say "might".
@BetoORourke I like Beto. But I hate misleading graphs and meaningless terms like "statistical tie". Do better please.
(What #ProRep method strikes that balance? PLACE voting: https://t.co/iPTvsc5Zcg )
If I @ someone at the beginning of my tweet because I'm quoting them, apparently Twitter decides that's not a "tweet" but just a "reply".		No, Twitter. You're supposed to be a place for public conversation. Citing sources by name makes something more generally relevant, not less.
Is #ProRep "plausible, scalable" in the US? Yes, if you do it right. It takes something that would allow the growth of third parties in the long term, but would not be too too disruptive to the status quo in the shorter term. That's a tricky balance to strike, but not impossible. https://t.co/qWWZoEdN3j
@ezraklein on #TheWeeds podcast: "I have been looking, and if anybody knows of something please email me, but I do not know even one plausible scalable idea for reducing polarization in the aggregate. I do not think we know how to do it."		Two words: proportional representation.
@facts_watch @BillTieleman If a majority votes against the current government in PR, it won't get a majority. If another party gets more votes, that other party will get the first chance to build a government. Easy peasy.
@BillTieleman Glen Clark won a false majority under FPTP. Voters weren't happy; next election, his party lost many votes and most seats. It's easy to see why he likes FPTP, but that's the same reason ordinary voters should hate it.		https://t.co/uyNCb1oxor
5/s this at all worth my time? Does looking at this convey the idea "votes are transferring around within the same party, so that the end result is proportional with one winner per district"? Can you tell that this way votes really count equally, unlike in FPTP?
4/I'd also like to make an FPTP version where non-winning votes are just transferring into the garbage pile, and winning votes are expanding to fill that void.
3/To simulate PLACE, I looked up all candidate endorsements on https://t.co/3aSaTfIlph, added gender and race as "pseudo endorsers", and assumed that candidates would approve the three other same-party candidates with the biggest overlap.
2/In the future, I'd like to add candidate photos, and make a d3 version that's interactive (ie, hover over a transfer and it tells you from whom, to whom, and why).
1/Further work on showing #ProRep elections as alluvial/flow plots. This is NC, districts 1-13 from top to bottom, with cross-district vote transfers. Initial votes from @gelliottmorris's model, adjusted by R+1.3% so that FPTP result is 50/50 nationally. https://t.co/Kgi6iA5Imf
@TheoLandsman @profmusgrave What is this even.		You had this ready, or made it especially? Criterion for extra counties is... manual choice?
7/7	I'm not claiming that it's a magical solution to everything. Politics will always have conflict. But when the legislature represents the people better, the outcomes can be better on average for everybody, not just for one side. https://t.co/lD37Omfh19
6/7	Add all those groups that #ProRep helps up, and you get the overwhelming majority of voters. People are used to thinking that if it helps my enemy, it must be bad for me. But this is the rare case of a true win/win reform. https://t.co/ZPatXIEk90
5/7	On the fourth limb, #ProRep helps groups that are shut out of the process now. Countries with pro-rep have more women in politics, better representation of ethnic diversity. https://t.co/UEwVekCpqK
4/7	On the third limb, #ProRep helps voters unsatisfied with current options, or who want more accountable parties. Conservative voter forced to vote strategically for Liberals? Green voter in a riding where only chance is to vote NDP? #ProRep frees you to vote your conscience. https://t.co/PBnpIAdqg2
3/7	On the other hand, #ProRep helps anyone in a riding whose MLA is in the minority. Instead of ignoring such ridings, governing party would still care about those votes. You'd never have a government made of MLAs from only one part of the province. https://t.co/oj8iOOPPqq
2/7	On one hand, #ProRep helps any voter who ever votes for a losing MLA candidate under FPTP. Instead of ~50% being represented, it would be over 90%. Liberal in Victoria? NDP in north? Pro-rep helps both, even though they disagree. https://t.co/NTNuMMkID0
1/7	One of the hard parts about campaigning for #PR4BC is that there are so many good arguments, it's hard to settle on just one. It's a win/win for various categories of voters. Pitch to one group, alienate another. #humblebrag https://t.co/idAi2qnI6C

5/5 So, overall, the @NoBCProRep side seems to be marginally improving their honesty. From 0% honest arguments in my earlier survey, to 33% in this (less-systematic) one here. Keep it up guys, you may reach 50% truth by the end of the referendum.		Whichever side you're on: vote!
4/5 Third: the stupid ad in favor of #ProRep that showed @BillTieleman with a gun (on a gun range). https://t.co/7quUoNcJGm		Tieleman is deceptive and wrong, but on a personal level he's unfailingly civil. Our side should be better, not worse. No place for attacks in this debate.
3/5 Second: #ProRep is simple for voters, and increases the chance each vote matters. The "so complicated even supporters can't explain" idea is based on a deceptively-edited globalnews story. https://t.co/UFocoGx7Gd		Notice they don't show you the question she was asked?
2/5 First off: the referendum is fair and transparent, not "rigged". Example tweet, https://t.co/JqnL9YdAdn		Turnout in the last 2 vote-by-mail referendums was over 50%, comparable to provincial elections. Future "backsies" referendum means party power grab wouldn't fly.

@150TourCanada @keithbaldrey Huh? Total population about the same. Common history in Commonwealth. Both have large rural areas and dense urban areas. Both have significant film industries. Both have important indigenous populations.		Nope, no basis for comparison here.
@ennis_steve @TerribleTerry23 @keithbaldrey This is not a partisan decision. This is about giving voters more power and parties less of it. Listening to what the parties say here is the worst way to decide.
@DougWhi06444051 @keithbaldrey Vice versa. You vote on the most important things — make and model. Small details settled later — color and extras.
@DaveJaycock @keithbaldrey Based on one out-of-context answer from one MLA, you think that nobody can explain it?		It's simple. There are dozens of 5-minute explainer vids. Watch one, make your own choice.
@PhaneuftTom @keithbaldrey @BCLiberalCaucus That's exactly backwards. All regions would be guaranteed same portion of MLAs as currently. Chances of a government with no rural MLAs is far lower under #ProRep than under current system.
@iceblueaccent @afrogirl7 Sure, partisans always have a "hidden" agenda of partisan advantage; that's true for both pro and anti sides on this referendum. But a voter's job is to look out for the long-term benefits to the province. By that measure, any of the 3 #ProRep options is way better than FPTP.
#ProRep, who would benefit: 	✅Any voter who didn't vote for their MLA now (about 50%)	✅Anyone in a riding whose MLA is now in minority (about 50% of the remaining)		#FPTP, who benefits:	✅~25% of voters not above	✅Insiders in current politics (party hacks, lobbyists)		#PR4BC

3/Note, in this graph, Virginia Foxx (R) has a few extra votes, while Kathy Manning (D) has too few. In the final version, I'd have extra votes turn gray &amp; move down to Kathy Manning's district, so that each district was the same size in final. Thus you could see wasted votes.

@BillTieleman I would argue that you have tested the border between "misleading" and "lying" in the past, for instance on your "MMP=closed list" claims. But this is not testing the border. This is a clear lie, the polar opposite of the truth. Erase it ASAP, and I'll erase these tweets too.
@BillTieleman Please delete this tweet immediately. It is based on the utterly false reading of that US SC finding. "At-large" in this context refers to at-large plurality, not to #ProRep. 		#ProRep has been consistently found to increase minority representation; eg, Banducci et al 2004.
#ProRep helps keep extremists OUT of power: https://t.co/SACYEgTSBN		In #BCpoli, the #NoBCProRep campaign has this exactly backwards; they're using extremism as one of their main arguments against #PR4BC.

@BillTieleman @robshaw_vansun @mdobrinskaya Do you really not know the difference between "list" and "closed list"?		In a closed list system, party decides. Open list, voters decide. Stating that "list"=closed is factually incorrect. Do not do this. 		If you say list "may" mean closed, fine; "will" is a lie.
@BillTieleman @JamesBCGreens @robshaw_vansun @soniatheroux @mdobrinskaya It is factually incorrect to say definitively that MMP means a party picks 40% of MLAs.		I'll bet you $50 to your favorite charity if it does. Against $25 to @electionscience if it doesn't, &amp; $0 if outcome is FPTP or DMP. Deal?
@robshaw_vansun @BillTieleman @mdobrinskaya True. I was clear on that. Tieleman was not. 		Stating definitively that MMP means closed lists, as Tieleman did multiple times, is, in technical terms, a "lie".
@robshaw_vansun @BillTieleman @mdobrinskaya Several dishonest arguments from @BillTieleman here.		Eg: under MMP, not true that party chooses 40%. In Bavarian MMP (the likely model for BC) seats go to candidates with highest vote totals (local+regional) w/in each party. More, not less, voter control. #BCpoli #PR4BC

@1alexhemingway BTW if NPA had won for mayor, they would basically have a lock on city government with a minority of votes. So reform agenda should include STAR voting for mayor as well as pro-rep for councillors.
@1alexhemingway Whoops, rounding mistake. 55% of mayoral vote for YIMBY by my count.
@1alexhemingway The "if I'm wrong" part is mostly on how to classify Green councillors. Not sure where to put them.
@1alexhemingway Correct me if I'm wrong:		The majority of votes for mayor (54% for Stew, Sylv, Brem) were YIMBY. 38% NIMBY (Sim, Young, Hard). Chen 2% PHIMBY, 5% also-rans.		But council is now 60% NIMBY (NPA, COPE), 30% PHIMBYish (Green), 10% YIMBY (OneCity).		Maybe #ProRep would help stability?
@BillTieleman So what you're saying is that every time a there's a scandal with a US or UK politician embracing white supremacist symbols, we should post it with #BCPoli #PR4BC hashtags?		No, thanks. I wouldn't have time for anything else.

@PoliticsWolf @GeoffreyHPowell My point is that proportional representation is not just about partisan balance. Also helps with race and, as Geoff says, gender.
@PoliticsWolf @GeoffreyHPowell At the local level, in places like Lowell, MA or Santa Clara, CA, there are voting rights lawsuits where the legal basis is a racially-biased system that could in theory be fixed with redistricting; but in practice proportional representation would be way cleaner.
@rudnicknoah This tweet seems to be assuming that causality only flows from cash to numbers, but it goes both ways. In other words, maybe the polling explains the cash and not vice versa? Or a bit of both? I'd guess you're mostly right but it's good to be cautious.

I think that @FairVote has had a broken theory of multi-winner change since its inception: start with 1-winner, then add multi-winner on top. In that mindset, "RCV" makes sense. But 1-/multi- solve different problems for different people; goo-goo ideals not enough to bridge gap.
2/2	Theory of single-winner change: grassroots/bottom up, building from 1-party or 3-party cities (2-party=bad fit). IRV works, but STAR is better.		Multi-winner: proof of concept ethnic voting rights in 1-3 cities, then jump to fed level to end gerrymandering. STV doesn't work.
1/2	As an activist, I get why the "RCV" umbrella term for STV and IRV is a good idea.		But as a strategist, it leads to muddy thinking. You can't develop a coherent theory of change if you're using the wrong examples. https://t.co/bhWk0A2UE5

@jacksantucci I'd advocate a system that in the short term remains mostly two-party dominated, and in the longer term evolves towards 2 larger (35-45%) parties, 2-3 small/regional (5-20%) ones. And so that's what I designed PLACE to lead to. Happy medium is closer to the US than Israel, but &gt;2
@MAlvarezRivera @jacksantucci Definitely offering PR statehood means making a serious plan on various issues—debt forgiveness/assumption, taxes, Jones act, etc. But from in the context of electoral reform, those are side issues.
@jacksantucci @TheoLandsman As you know, my theory of change (pass on a partisan basis, as in UK 1832) is different from yours (alliance between neglected factions, with 3rd-party threat salient). In mine, it does not need GOP support.
@jacksantucci @laderafrutal @VerbanckSteven @massivetotoro @MadisonDilemma Yes, pretty awesome. Though I can't say I like the giant numbers up top; I'm sure there was bias towards lower numbers.
"Voting day holiday" is a nice slogan, but IMO the ideal would be a couple hours off, not all day. In other words, my law would say "On voting day, everyone gets 1/20 of their weekly wage (2h pay) for free; and also anything over 6h worked that day gets double pay."

2/2	...Truth is, I'm neither. Not so hard to design a new system to resolve many old problems without creating serious new ones. Especially since it's my ~7th try.		Moral: we can do better than existing practice. PLACE isn't ideal, just an example. But need willingness to change.
1/Sometimes I feel like a broken record (a Vine? A gif?) for bringing up PLACE in every discussion of the pros and cons of other #ProRep voting methods.		Sometimes I feel like a genius for designing a method that addresses all the cons of older ones.		But...
@mcpli Preach it.
@jacksantucci @laderafrutal @massivetotoro @MadisonDilemma @lordsutch What is "free list"? Is this what we'd call open list?		Problem is, if you have thresholds, you need cross-party transfers. Options then are ranking (complex ballots), delegation (a la PLACE), or half-assed/ad hoc (such as Bavarian w/transfers for split ballots).
@mcpli So much yes!		The lawsuit is horrible. But so is the Harvard status quo. A better system would have a lot fewer legacy students. And yes, a good portion of those slots would go to Asians.		Separately, Harvard should be growing 10%/year for 10 years. Spread the wealth!

@laderafrutal @mlatner There's no question in my mind that there is a category of which "STV" and "approval voting" are both members, while "the US presidential system including primaries and electoral college" is not. Also no question that there should be a word for members. Why not "voting method"?
@laderafrutal @mlatner For instance, on Wikipedia, the old "Voting system" article was about the social choice theory objects I'm talking about. Included plenty of discussion of methods not currently in use in any country. That's now deleted; replaced by "Electoral system" which only compares practice.
@laderafrutal @mlatner Amateur community has mostly settled on "methods". Academia still a hodgepodge. Some use "systems", blurring the line between country-specific systems and generalities like "STV" or "limited vote". Some use "formula", which is clear, but to my ear leaves out 1-winner.
@laderafrutal @mlatner I think that "electoral system of country X"—including all the rules—is the right term. Eg, in USA, includes primaries, voter registration rules, etc.		My point: that leaves a terminology gap. What to call theoretical ballot-&gt;winner mappings; what social choice theory studies?
@NoBCProRep has been scaremongering about how PR supposedly leads to far-right takeover. This is not consistent with that story.		Note: purely on the level of electoral methods, Bavaria is actually best model if BC chooses MMP (1 of the 3 #ProRep options).		#BCpoli #PR4BC https://t.co/MrprXoqXTX

(ps. If you've gotten this far, you've probably already figured this out, but... in the thread above, Twitter puts the tweet I'm responding to below my response. Sorry for any confusion that brings.)
14/14	So, I looked at the dozen latest tweets from @NoBCProRep. Every one of them was somewhere on the scale from misleading to outright lies. Despite repetition, over a dozen different misleading ideas.		Ask yourself: who benefits from this kind of fearmongering dishonesty?
13/14	https://t.co/eo6viaMAep	Once again, 180º backwards. #ProRep represents to all voters, including Liberal minority in lower mainland and NDP minority in north. Result: governing majority would be MORE likely to have MLAs from all regions.
12/14	I said I was going to do just 10, but #11 and #12 are the most dishonest yet, so...	https://t.co/Kmxzt9P2PA	Three bold assertions. Three outright lies. British Columbians deserve better. #PR4BC #BCpoli #prorep
11/12	https://t.co/Kmxzt9P2PA	I agree, voting should be simple. More votes, more seats; what could be simpler?		Do you think it's "simple" that the federal NDP consistently gets more votes but fewer seats than the Bloc?		#PR4BC
10/12	https://t.co/lJnuWqOYPL	100% projection. I'll ignore the non-sequitur on extremists.		Key point is that in #ProRep, almost all voters help elect an MLA. In FPTP, only about 50% do. 		So, @NoBCProRep: What’s the point in voting if YOU don’t get to decide your representation?
9/12	https://t.co/rXC38KdyVh	Trifecta of fearmongering: 	Nazis? ✅ 	Guilt by association (Weimar Republic had some proportional aspects!)? ✅	Ignoring problems with status quo system? ✅	 	Again: who benefits when you worry about Nazi Germany not current USA?
8/12	https://t.co/CMv2dVAYSw	Again with the scaremongering about far-right parties. This tweet doesn't even make any factual claims I can debunk, just foments a miasma of fear.		Ask yourself: who benefits from making you afraid like this? I'm pretty sure it's not you.
7/12	https://t.co/aezoFe6R6w	Correctly describes a Fraser Institute study. But not unbiased: right-leaning FI hosted a pro-reform conference in BC back in the 90s, when #ProRep was good for right.	Italy, Norway, Germany= &lt;20 elections since 1945. Canada, NZ, Aus= &gt;22, mostly FPTP
6/12	https://t.co/VJOY5IHNYz	Suprise, voting methods are not a perfect panacea against racism! But in Sweden, the two biggest parties have both pledged not to join a government with right wing—so RW doesn't get power.		Meanwhile, in the US, under FPTP...
5/12	https://t.co/HEN6vacALN	Three lies in one.		①"Algorithm"=process for NOT losing votes. Fearmongering—NoBCProRep thinks you're stupid!		②#ProRep doesn't mean parties decide. All 3 #PR4BC options can keep voters in charge.		③FPTP≠voters decide. Parties assign candidates.
4/12	https://t.co/RBxm01W1Im	FALSE. Current system has seen many changes (and arguably also a few problems?) over 145 years. Votes for women is a big one! Beyond that, see fascinating timeline of Canadian history of election reform at https://t.co/djn65nApxR
3/12	https://t.co/G2Cmm3VGsu	FPTP is far more prone to policy whiplash than PR. Look at 1996 and 2001 elections: first NDP get 52% of seats w/ 39% of votes, then Liberals get 97% of seats w/ 58% of votes.		Successive #ProRep governments would have more overlap; BETTER stability.
2/12	https://t.co/waSBXWn3Nm	Basically true, according to https://t.co/Eq7roa8wP0 . But in same link, aside from the referendum, 57% of those polled in BC support #ProRep. ≥50% in each province polled except Manitoba. That is, 100% have some opinion, albeit unsure on referendum.
1/12	*Every* main argument of the #NoBCProRep campaign is misleading somehow. Pilon's essay https://t.co/tX48l1Wnr6 is devastating in understated academic terms but the public debate is even starker.		Here comes a thread where I respond to each of @NoBCProRep's last 10 tweets.

@mlatner @jacksantucci ...But I've made my point, I should stop pounding it. Good day.
@mlatner @jacksantucci So you'd expect to see this table featured prominently in wikipedia's "elections" article? Can't say I'd agree. Yes, the concepts are closely connected; no, they're not the same. https://t.co/f9hikLlmtF
@jacksantucci @mlatner (But yes, to your larger point, grounding this and other conversations in Cox is a good place to start.)
@jacksantucci @mlatner Cox explicitly uses "electoral systems" to mean something broader than the ballot-to-winner mapping rules I'm talking about; he discusses the latter as one "structure" or "subsystem" of the former.		We need 1 separate word. "Formal algorithmic electoral structures" is silly.
@mlatner There's no infinite thesaurus here. Options are: method, system, algorithm, formula, rule. "Method" isn't perfect, but IMO best of bunch. I could be convinced for some of the others, but I do know "system" is already used for other stuff.		For mail vs in-person, "mode" or etc.
This applies to so many things right now.		And it means that anyone trying to make you feel off balance is your enemy. For one tiny instance, the #NoBCProRep campaign clearly wants people unsure and afraid.		#PR4BC #bcpoli https://t.co/kgsMtNuEEY
@mlatner Agreed.		I'm talking about the thing you just called "electoral formula". Examples include not just multiwinner ones like STV or limited vote but 1 winner ones like approval or IRV/AV.		"System" is confusing. "Formula" sounds nerdy, &amp; leaves out 1winner debate. Why not "method"?

@mlatner (MMP probably wasn't the best example there. Should have said FPTP. "Country specific" is stuff like machines and calendars and candidate eligibility rules, not closed vs open list.)
@mlatner I'd like to understand your point here. Are you saying that "electoral system" is a better term than "voting method" because the latter refers to something else that's less systematic?		I think the former includes too much country-specific stuff to be a good term for (say) MMP.

@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal @VoterChoiceMA @fairvote @CShentrup @Rob_Richie 6/Do #3: have place for activism &amp; for theory		Pass laws! Amherst, Fargo, Lane County, BC, etc… great!	But keep the geeky conversation going. https://t.co/V8tbIEyreD , https://t.co/Q9e5U1JOpU , https://t.co/aD8coxi3zc , etc.		In #PR4BC, the geeky https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb was key.
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal @VoterChoiceMA @fairvote @CShentrup 5/Do #2: stay open.		Yes: "Here's a problem. Here's one solution. There are others. Let's get to work."	No: "Here's a problem. The [only] solution is X."	(I called out Clay by name before, so only fair that I call out eg @Rob_Richie here.)
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal @VoterChoiceMA @fairvote @CShentrup 4/Now, the "do"s.		Do #1: stay practical.		Sure, if you could rewrite the constitution from scratch, you could do better. But you're not gonna. Look for solutions that could get implemented without clearing multiple supermajority hurdles. Luckily, NPV, AVR, ProRep, etc. all fit.
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal @VoterChoiceMA @fairvote 3/Don't #3: "Science proves..."		Citing evidence is great! But if somebody doesn't agree on how to interpret that evidence, don't insult their intelligence. I get it, we're nerds. For physicists like my mom, shouting "you're wrong" is no insult. But we mustn't do that. @CShentrup
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal @VoterChoiceMA 2/Don't #2: My way or highway.		On the other hand, I've seen RCV supporters try to silence other reformers by pretending RCV is the only viable possibility. Looking at #PR4BC, that's just not true. eg, when @FairVote writes https://t.co/aBc6JjUFNj mostly against STAR voting, grr!
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal 1/Don't #1: backseat driver.		Example: @VoterChoiceMA is doing great work building a huge grassroots movement for RCV. RCV is not my favorite reform. But I don't stalk them just to talk about whatever I think is better. Their wins are theirs, not a place for me to disparage.
@MadisonDilemma @jg_environ @laderafrutal You are right. But it's not so easy.		Choosing an election method is not necessarily simple. Making a healthy choice requires healthy dialogue. The dos and don'ts of that can't fit in one tweet, so I guess here comes a thread, starting with the don'ts:
@NoBCProRep An election "caused" 18% of people to vote for a certain party? That's like saying Marie Curie caused radiation to be dangerous. https://t.co/PcLPy4D2qi
(ps. If this isn't the best place to discuss #TheWeeds episodes publicly, what is? Again, @DLind @sarahkliff @mattyglesias @ezraklein. I know there's a FB group and if that's way better I guess I'll join, but all else = I try to avoid FB. Too walled off &amp; monetized/spammy.)
This is AWESOME.		Gotta get my voter satisfaction efficiency (VSE) paper published! https://t.co/6oXCwSZ7Bj
@AngelaSterritt How is it, though?
8/If that referendum passes, as I expect, I think it paves the way for similar creativity in solving the US problem.		My own proposal is PLACE voting ( https://t.co/iPTvsc5Zcg ). I think it's awesome. But larger point is, it's a solvable problem. /end
7/Look at the #PR4BC referendum next month. The problem in BC isn't the same: it's size of rural districts, not avoiding disruption for incumbents. But using well-established base mechanisms, they easily found/designed 3 different #ProRep methods to solve it.
6/But!!		Once you state the problem that clearly, it is 100% possible to design #ProRep systems to solve it.
5/Are there #ProRep methods that are nondisruptive in that way? In current use, not so much. STV, MMP, list systems would all throw existing reps into an entirely new environment (unless you used MMP &amp; expanded House simultaneously, and also had different ratios across states).
4/Three points:		1. #ProRep is a solution for gerrymandering — thus beneficial to the Dem party as a whole.	2. Chances of a Dem trifecta in 2021 are decent.	3. So pro-rep can pass… IF it's not disruptive to individual reps' chances.
3/That's too bad. 		Congress has power over "Times, Places, and Manner" of House elections; that's plenty to institute #ProRep. So the real hurdle is political: why would congresspeople change the system which elected them?		When you put it like that, this hurdle is surmountable.
2/Why don't the Weeds' bunch (@mattyglesias @sarahkliff @ella_nilsen) talk about voting methods in this context? Probably because that kind of reform is outside most pundit's imagination ("Overton window", but not just left/right).
1/Vox's #TheWeeds: "Is there a theory of why US lags on women's representation? Not really, blah blah party structure."		Um, #ProRep anyone? US system (choose 1/FPTP) is consistently worse at electing women. @GraceALore can tell a complex story here, but that's the simple answer.
@jacksantucci @davidshor @CA_120 @PoliticsWolf @KristinEberhard @TimRothSTV 3/But it is possible to design a proportional system which gives maximum breadth of choice with minimum complexity — and which even keeps existing districts, while giving robust great results in spite of any gerrymandering. https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP
@jacksantucci @davidshor @CA_120 @PoliticsWolf @KristinEberhard @TimRothSTV 2/To get that, you need breadth of choice — which means that RCV's depth of choice (ranking) is too much of a hassle. Who wants to rank 40+ candidates?
@jacksantucci @davidshor @CA_120 @PoliticsWolf @KristinEberhard @TimRothSTV 1/Proportional representation should not just be about parties. A good system naturally improves proportionality for gender, race, age too.
@davidshor @ElectProject @gelliottmorris @NateSilver538 But inferior for one simple reason: symmetry. I think it would have to be (max(D,R)/(D+R), letter of leading party, U). Which would be a smart format... in the same useless way that gallons per mile is superior to its reciprocal. I think we're stuck with margins, like qwerty.
@leedrutman Yes! I've long believed voting reformers (eg @ElectionScience,@TheEqualVote,@fairvote,@jimjonas) &amp; voting rights activists (eg @CommonCause,@BrennanCenter,@fairerelections) should work together. eg, 1st group should endorse eg MI prop 2; 2nd, approval in Fargo, STAR in Lane OR.

@mlatner @jacksantucci @MadisonDilemma Dual member is one example of a biproportional method — a district/proportional hybrid.

@WhatAboutJDR @BillTieleman Last two vote-by-mail referendums in BC had over 50% turnout. Not quite 56% like the last provincial election, but within a few percent.		In other words, it will take more votes to win #PR4BC than for the average governing majority.
@newscane @albertocairo The converse is better. "If you bitch, you must vote." Even more than your version, it obviously doesn't apply to youth, residents, felons, and other disenfranchised groups.
@albertocairo Yes, everyone who can vote should. In every election.		But "complaining" can mean either useless kvetching — which you shouldn't do even if you do vote — or useful democratic engagement — which you should do even if you don't vote. It's a ladder, not a moat.

@EasterbrookG 4/US democracy has too many veto points. Making it so the Senate and the White House swung together would not be perfect, but it would be better than the status quo. /end
@EasterbrookG 3/Idea is for each state to do both of its Senate seats simultaneously, through a proportional system that essentially guarantees one winner each D/left and R/right in each state. The VP would always break the tie, so the Senate would swing with the White House.
@EasterbrookG 2/The Senate (point 4) has two undemocratic problems: malapportionment (different-sized states) and winner-take-all. Almost impossible to fix the former except by adding/splitting/merging states (PR, DC, CA, etc.). But fixing the latter would take just 1 constitutional amendment:
@EasterbrookG 1: Great idea, but needs no constitutional amendment. #NPVIC.	2: Same. Create "emeritus justice" status and job; appointments still last a lifetime.	3: PLACE voting gets proportional results with existing districts and no constitutional change.	4: ...complicated, see next tweet.

@progressnerd @SManSpeaks However you do it, summability is a real hurdle. I'd argue that, in combination with all the other hurdles, it makes the problem insurmountable.		Why not just use a summable method? There's plenty of good ones. And after November, STAR will no longer be just theory.
@progressnerd @SManSpeaks Not precinct summability. State-by-state summability, as the basis for an interstate compact; especially one in which some states could still be using plurality. Non-summable raises bad issues of communication/centralization, of laying out compact rules, and of possible recounts.

@rgodfrey @mattyglesias Dupe process.
I'm tweeting this picture yet again because it tells the story of why yesterday went so wrong.		Under 54 million people voted for the Republican Senators (or the governors who appointed them). Over 79 million voted for the Democrats and independents. That's not democracy. https://t.co/SIKLwhGP9i
@djrothkopf You left one form of institutional rot out: the Senate. 51 Republican Senators (or their appointers) got under 54 million votes total; 49 Democrats and independents got 79 million votes. The Senate is neither democratic nor republican (small-d/r); it's an oligarchy. https://t.co/rDhAm06KID
8/...given the scale of the problem, I think it's worth discussing such "crazy" ideas now.
7/Finally, a wildcard idea that would not require constitutional change: requiring states to allow anyone who was born or lived there for over 10 years to register to vote for senate, even if they now live elsewhere. Turn rural-&gt;urban migration back. Again, sounds crazy, but...
6/Next: Splitting larger states into smaller parts. It would take very strong reasons to even contemplate this one, because of all the disruption. But yesterday was a very, very strong reason to me at least.
5/Those are the easy two. After that, there's possibilities, but all are very difficult.		Most obvious: constitutional amendment. Can't directly change senate representation, but still plenty of options if you're changing constitution.
4/Second, defend voting rights and increase turnout. Automatic voter registration, no felon disenfranchisement or onerous hoops for voters, voting day holiday, vote by mail, tax rebate. This would reduce Senate malapportionment only slightly, but it would reduce.
3/First, offer statehood to DC and PR. Even though DC would be a small state, including it would reduce the bias of the senate, as measured by the gap between the countrywide mean and the median state, in many ways. In other words, it would reduce the chance of "minority rules".

@mlatner @laderafrutal @MaxwellACameron Agree: biproportional methods (that is, methods which simultaneously fulfill "n per district" and proportionality) are the least painful step to PR for the US. DMP (n=2) is not bad for that. But I'd argue n=1.5 (DMP, but with only 1 extra/2 districts) or n=1 (PLACE) are better.
@laderafrutal @MaxwellACameron I agree with this picture. To me, DMP is no more and no less than biproportional MMP. That is, MMP with the constraint that there will be exactly 1 list tier winner per district.		It's not my favorite biproportional method, but that's like saying not my favorite chocolate mousse.

@NoBCProRep The water enters your house via a confusing set of pipes, meaning it gets lost along the way. That's why I'm voting #NoIndoorPlumbing.		In reality, it takes about 5 minutes to understand any of the 3 #ProRep methods. If you'd rather trust the experts, fine. But you don't have to.
@1VA2021 Gerrymandering doesn't just mean "drawing lines", it means "drawing funny lines in order to get an unfair advantage". With #ProRep, there are no unfair advantages, so no reason to cook the lines.
@gelliottmorris Inevitable that the Kavanaugh outcome will have an effect, one way or another. Which probably pushes the probability today towards 50%; rolling the dice is good for the underdog.

@BillTieleman @fairvoteKam @fairvotebc @maryforbc @StrategicThghts Wow. No wonder you keep saying that #ProRep is too hard; you can't even understand the system you have now.		In FPTP, the party that gets more votes wins a riding, whether that's 50%+1 or &lt;35%. If they win over 50% of ridings, they have 100% power. At best, 50%*50%=25% matter.

@BillTieleman @sean_gra @SuzanneAnton @NoBCProRep It's simple, Bill. If you put two popular candidates from different parties in the same riding, they will come in 1st and 2nd, with plenty of votes each.

@gelliottmorris I know what "increased odds by 70%" means, but I don't think it's at all obvious reading casually. Wouldn't "1.7 times higher odds" be much clearer?
@leedrutman This is something that RCV is not very good at fixing. In RCV race between Left, Center, and Right, pretty much the only way for center to win is for losing wing to betray favorite candidate, strategically vote Center.		Approval voting probably fixes this. STAR definitely does.
@_waleedshahid @matthewstoller In other words: if GOP had a lock on the Senate, that would be a huge problem. But if they can hold it half the time, while permanently losing in the other two venues, that is tolerable.
@_waleedshahid @matthewstoller If the GOP were a permanent minority in House, WH, and Sen, then they'd be forced to retool. But if the undemocratic nature of the Senate (even after offering statehood to DC&amp;PR) keeps them artificially competitive there, that just extends their time in the wilderness.

Compromise is only worthwhile if the deals you make are enforceable. In choose-one voting, that's not the case. I think in a good #ProRep system, with a non-hollowed-out center, people would be more open to compromise; I know I would. https://t.co/6kRJe3K5gS

@leedrutman 1/Great article. Too many "yes!" to list here.		Where I disagree 1: model for electoral reform being embraced by existing party does NOT require 3rd party threat. Look at Parliamentary Reform, 1832: rotten boroughs favored 1 of 2 parties, other reacted. Like gerrymandering today.

@PoliticsWolf Argh. I meant AR, not AK.
@PoliticsWolf Just ran the numbers. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, the 51 republicans will have won their most recent elections with (or be appointed by someone who got) a total of 54907770 votes, while that number for Democrats is 79171650.		41% of two-way pop vote-&gt;51% seats-&gt;100% power. https://t.co/v1FgQEPOBt
@PoliticsWolf Again, I realize this is not politically feasible right now. But it's not a crazy long-term goal. It would be an improvement from the point of democracy, and even from the point of view of the founders' (small-r) republican vision.
@PoliticsWolf In the long run, you might eventually get a midwestern megastate: (((MT+ID)+((WY+SD)+ND))+(NE+KS)). Doubt it would ever get that far under current population trends but haven't checked. Anyway, no mergers beyond that and the aforementioned VT+NH+ME are even remotely plausible.
@PoliticsWolf In terms of racial bias on representation (ie, https://t.co/IVFyomIjAS), this would lower median-mean bonus for non-Hispanic Whites from 9.9% to 6.8%.		US average=61.3%; current median state=WA/AK=71.2%, median after DC, PR, and this=CT/CO=68.1%.		Not perfect, but notably better.
@PoliticsWolf New amendment: If two states are contiguous, and neither is in the top 38 by population, they must merge. Would result in ((WY+SD)+ND) and (VT+NH) immediately, and add ME to the latter once PR comes in.		Politically infeasible at present, but in theory, could get 3/4 to ratify.

Future chilling effects on staff secretaries are real. But the responsibility of advice and consent on SCOTUS is far, far higher.		If a president doesn't trust a secretary to give good advice because they may be aiming for SCOTUS later, the president should get a new secretary.

@PoliticsWolf You already know what I'm gonna say, right? Let's say it together on 3. 1, 2,...		Redistricting is nice, but proportional representation is better. With biproportional methods you keep existing districts, or clean them up, and either way gerrymandering wouldn't matter. #ProRep
About 4/5 of this problem is deliberate gerrymandering; and feasible redistricting laws could solve at most about 3/5. If you want to solve the whole problem, we need congress to pass a #ProRep law such as the Fair Representation Act. (That act could be tweaked to pass easier.) https://t.co/Z087t2jZnT

@dylanmatt 2/On PR statehood: addressing debt issue should come first. Write down 80% of PR debt unconditionally; Fed assumes remainder (or at least half of it) if statehood goes through. In other words: start with a (large) gesture of good faith, then also offer a (smaller) carrot.
@dylanmatt 1/This covers the right ground. But a few comments:		5 is a stretch constitutionally. Making benefits to citizens conditional on whether their state is in a given interstate compact that end-runs the constitution—several angles to challenge. Unfortunately, NPV is a state issue.

@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma If "it" is the Slovenian system, then agreed, not a good idea.		If "it" is just "proportional with 1 winner per district" in general, then the issues in that blog post don't necessarily apply.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal Note that PLACE delegation is based on pre-declared endorsements, not post-election rankings, so it's easy for voters to know what their vote will or won't support. They can choose accordingly.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal Basic philosophy is: 	① Proportional — use STV-style quotas and transfers.	② Maximum voter choice — Any voter can choose any candidate.	③ Maximum simplicity — voters choose one, transfers are delegated (with partisan guarantee).	④ Big-tent parties, not fringe — 25% threshold.
@MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal I agree with the objections you pose in that blog post—which is why my proposal, PLACE voting, addresses all of them. 		https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP		Voters can write in cross-district votes; 25% min threshold of local votes to win; if candidate eliminated, votes transfer, delegated.
RT @FairVoteCanada: Elections should be decided by more than a few swing ridings. Every region and district should count.		#prorep #bcpoli…
@laderafrutal Agreed.		To get the public on board, focus on selling points—"fair proportions", or "every vote matters"—and not implementation details like multiseat districts. That's my criticism of your original tweet.		YMMV, I'll drop this now.
@laderafrutal Any of us could be wrong—even me!		But my hunch is that right now the best hope of #PR4US is as a way to #endGerrymandering. In that sense, it's gotta be national, to avoid sabotage by gerrymandered state gov. And for Congress, STV is too disruptive—so biproportional best chance.
@laderafrutal My argument is about messaging. We should use whatever term makes the biggest useful tent. "Proportional" is a great battle cry; "multiseat districts" is both wonkier and more divisive/misleading than necessary.
@laderafrutal Sure, that makes sense from a technical point of view.		But on Twitter, does it really make sense to say "that system which elects one winner from each district is really a giant multiseat system in disguise"? If that's implied by saying it's proportional, why not just say that?
@laderafrutal #ProRep ≠ multiseat districts. That's the point of biproportional systems: you can have single-seat districts and still get top-of-the-line proportionality and choice.

The two go hand-in-hand, and voting reform is needed to #endgerrymandering and fix malapportionment. But even though I've devoted much of my life to voting theory, the biggest first step requires no theory at all: just get more people voting.
Just listening to @CGDev podcast episode with @DenisMcDonough. Asked "what 1 US policy would make biggest difference", he says "mandatory voting".		And I agree. I spend most twitter energy on proportional representation/voting reform. Which is big. Tax credit for voting? Bigger.
@vyassaran I'm sure you've seen https://t.co/dAGkRxnsMG. I tried to be neutral about inviting both sides. So I've been team #PropRep.		But I'd be willing to switch sides if you can convince me it would help. What's your argument?
@Climatologist49 Linear scale or area scale? Looks like linear, which is cheating; should take square root.
12/Those are technicalities, and twitter isn't the place to explain the details. But overall lesson is: congressional polarization is a big problem, it's fixable, and #PropRep / #ProRep / #ProportionalRepresentation is the key. /end
11/	1: Intraparty choice (eg, open list). Voters in charge, not party insiders.		2: High thresholds with interparty vote transfers (eg, STV-5, PLACE, or Bavarian MMP with transfers). This encourages small parties to work through big-tent parties, not to be entrenched radicals.
10/Is that vision of proportional representation utopian? Well, PR can fail. Israel, for instance, is a poster child for its flaws. But I believe that well-designed PR can avoid the Israel problems.		What does "well-designed" mean?...
9/…as long as there remains some overlap outside Congress. And we get a government that cares about a full spectrum of Americans, not just counting coup between the two modes of an artificially bimodal distribution.
8/A far better solution is proportional representation. Each group gets a fair amount of power, so every vote matters. In particular, the moderate *voters* in each party gain power at the expense of the extreme *donors*. Complete polarization within congress can't happen…
7/Is this solvable? Well, in theory, even if precincts are mostly polarized, you could try to draw districts to unite equal numbers of precincts from either side, and thus ensure competitive elections, strengthen the MVT. But that's a sisyphean task; always fighting gravity.
6/That kind of zero-sum dynamics within Congress leads to broken, negative-sum dynamics for the country. If each party would rather cut off their own base's noses than cooperate with the other side, we end up with a lot of noseless Americans. Think gov shutdown, etc.
5/Which brings us to the game theory not of elections, but of votes within Congress. When there was overlap, it wasn't entirely zero-sum; it was possible to find win/win solutions, event if only for the few in the middle. But in today's polarized world, when you win I lose.
4/…most importantly, it ignores primaries &amp; fundraising. All of these factors push parties to the extremes, especially the way primaries &amp; fundraising tend to nationalize races. And that polarization is what we in fact see: (ht @gelliottmorris) https://t.co/nlhxyQbJR4

2/The first bit of relevant game theory is the median voter theorem: in a two-party world of 100% turnout and one-dimensional ideology (with single-peaked preferences), both parties run to the middle.		Does that still apply in a world of demographic sorting? Kinda but not really.
1/It's actually time for some game theory here. How do parties react to a world where most seats are safe? 		Spoiler alert: it ain't healthy. And there's a solution: proportional representation. #PropRep (or is it #ProRep? Either way.) https://t.co/QQuj00GcdZ
@BradRubenstein @Nate_Cohn But good ones aren't hard to do, as several in this thread have pointed out.
3/Want higher turnout and a healthier democracy? #PropRep is good for you.		Find politicians boring and unaccountable? It's good for you, too; it makes it so that whoever can inspire *you* can actually win for a change.		"Make Votes Matter" means: power to the voters.
2/In other words, #PropRep would boost turnout not only through push factors (voters care more) but also through pull factors (parties care more about voters). For every voter, there would be somebody working their ass off to get out that vote.		Now? In most places, "meh".
1/Under choose-one voting (FPTP), your vote probably doesn't matter. Whether you like or hate "your" rep, they probably have a safe seat.		Under #PropRep, every vote matters. You'd have more reasons to vote. And just as importantly, politicians'd have more reasons to want you to.

@TimParallelVote 4/After all, almost all of the long-term minor party winners will be people who in the current system are (perhaps uncomfortably) inside one of the major parties.		Can't satisfy everyone, but I trust the voters.
@TimParallelVote 3/I know that this answer is unsatisfying in some ways. Avid reformers will see "just a handful in short term" and be discouraged. Partisan insiders will see "could be 40% in long term" and be scared. But as for me, I trust the voters to make a smooth, nondisruptive transition.
@TimParallelVote 2/In the longer term, as voting patterns and political organizing shift based on the system, it's harder to say. An educated guess based on squinting at international comparisons? Smaller parties might get to 20-30% of seats? Could be 10%, could be 40%; depends what voters want.
@TimParallelVote 1/With current voting patterns, smaller parties would win just a small handful of seats. Most of the power they'd gain in the short term would be helping decide which major-party candidates win seats. (Which is important.)
@TheoLandsman So the plan is, pass good PR voting systems in places like British Columbia, Lowell MA, and Santa Clara CA, to show they work. Offer statehood to PR and DC in 2021. Then pass PLACE through Congress sometime during the 2020s.		Tough? Sure. But path not as body-strewn as 3rd party.
@TheoLandsman In order for this to work, we'd need a reform proposal that could break 2-party duopoly in long term, but isn't too disruptive in the short term to pass. And that proposal exists: PLACE voting.	https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP
@TheoLandsman ...the only path to action. There's also the major parties!		Why would a major party embrace reform that might break duopoly? Because we don't have to create a crisis, we have one: gerrymandering. Proportional representation can pass like UK reform in 1832, on partisan grounds.
@TheoLandsman The "party first" theory is explicitly "break the eggs before lighting the stove". Create a painful crisis in order to fix it later. Pure privilege.		And the rationale is "can't organize a grassroots movement without a crisis". OK, kinda true. But grassroots movements aren't...

@GeoffreyHPowell @JSmytheDuVal Think we know more than he did in 1890? I do.
@GeoffreyHPowell @JSmytheDuVal I think PLACE is the best way for the US, but I'd never say "only way". I support any proportional representation that works. And I think that British Columbia will show us the way forward — if I'm right, who knows which of the 3 it will be, but it will be neither PLACE nor STV.
@GeoffreyHPowell @JSmytheDuVal Lewis Carroll, AFAIK, liked even-simpler asset voting even-more than STV. 		But as to maximizing voter choice, the key words are "for a given district magnitude". Something like PLACE manages bigger magnitude districts from the point of view of voter choice, but still simpler.
@GeoffreyHPowell @JSmytheDuVal You said "only way", not "best way".		I'll say more in the next tweet, but that's head and shoulders above anything else I'd say. We'll never get anywhere if people keep turning "best way" into "only way".

@GeoffreyHPowell @JSmytheDuVal Wait, what?		Proportional representation is the only way to completely kill the gerrymander, with you on that. #FairMaps would hurt but not kill it.

@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter But then, I guess I'm just being pedantic.		(Jumps in -30minute time machine, posts this before your latest standalone tweet).
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter In physics, you'd call it a "theory", which is very high praise. Unfortunately, in common parlance, "theory" refers to mere hypotheses. 😣
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter I'm not trying to disparage or debate your work; SPM is awesome.		I'm arguing about the term *you* used on Twitter. SPM is "analytical", or "a priori", or "reasoned", take your pick; but it's not "deductive".
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter Agree, not everything needs microfoundations. But that is what "deductive" means to me in this context. "Average of the lowest possible exponent and the highest possible one" is very sensible logic, but it ain't deductive.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter I'll grant it's more than observational, but I don't think you quite get to call it "deductive" yet. It's a long way from having microfoundations all the way down to bedrock measure theory. (That gap could be closed somewhat, but I suspect never 100%; strategy is perverse.)
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @SethDKlein @npdrifter Extrapolating such findings to new voting methods (such as DMP in BC, or STAR in OR) is doable, but not trivial or 100% reliable. Even when copying existing methods, going from observational data to causal conclusions takes careful, cautious work.
In all probability, it wouldn't even be up to parties to "opt" for a voter-centric process. Each of the 3 options could be designed to make sure voters were in charge; for instance, MMP could be designed Bavarian-style. That's the best way to win voter trust for 2nd referendum. https://t.co/1HRX72KEUk

That kind of hactic rhetoric is what chokes people about Prop Rep. Murder is not a joke–look at this beautiful flag 🇨🇦. Listen to Bill–voting is overrated. #BCpoli
@j_mcelroy @DevonRowcliffe And IMO Bavarian is serious possibility; @Dave_Eby apparently paid real attention to the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb recommendations when setting up the referendum, and the symposium was unequivocal that MMP should look more like Bavaria than like, eg, the (broken) Welsh version.
@j_mcelroy @DevonRowcliffe I understand that speculating about details that won't be fixed until later is not the point here. But "candidate and party, or just party" is not accurate, it doesn't include possibilities like Bavarian.
@j_mcelroy @DevonRowcliffe The best MMP version is Bavarian, where you vote for a local candidate and a nonlocal candidate, who can be from the same or different parties. If they're different parties, your vote counts 50% for each, unless one gets no seats, in which case it counts 100% for the other.
@mudlock Specifically: approval voting in Fargo, ND; STAR voting in Lane County, OR; STV in Amherst, MA; and #PropRep in British Columbia (for later import/imitation in the US). All of these are I think more promising than single-winner "RCV" (IRV). But the positive buzz around RCV helps!
@mudlock As you know, I'm no fan of "RCV". But as a reform activist, you should be building up the reform proposals you like more, not tearing down those you like less. Choose-one voting (aka FPTP) is the common enemy, don't take your eyes off of it.
@davidshor I think "partisanship of state" is a pretty flawed proxy for the similarity/difference between MA and VT, but your point still stands, even after I water it down a bit over this issue.		Personally, I'd far prefer Warren over Sanders, but I think they're both too old for 2020.
@astro_ricky @USGSVolcanoes @USGS @NASA I do not think this is any volcano in Guatemala. Volcán Atitlan and Volcán San Pedro are dormant and the coastline next to them is not like this.

@MakeVotesMatter Mexico, Japan, and probably others are misclassified.
@mattyglesias 5/And thus, criticizing Harvard (and Stanford, Yale, Princeton, etc.) for admitting too many legacies and over-coached privileged kids, (and for not adding 50% to class size in mid-career transfers, etc.) is important, not to be pooh-poohed.
@mattyglesias 4/So yes, current Harvard, with too many legacies (like me) is bad. But meritocracy per se isn't. Harvard-style meritocracy is, in theory, compatible with pushing today's society towards something far more egalitarian.
@mattyglesias 3/Would that be the best use of a $40bn endowment, in terms of reducing inequality? Of course not. But it would arguably be a good use of money to reduce inequality through undergraduate/graduate education &amp; research, that is, while staying within the mission of a university.
@mattyglesias 2/Why? Because today's inequality is based way more on your race and parents' class than on your innate intelligence. Giving a meritocratic advantage to the smart would reduce Piketty-style wealth accumulation and, at margin, tend to regress families towards the mean.
@mattyglesias 1/Imagine Dravrah, a U which is a true meritocracy based on (an unbiased homoskedastic estimate of) innate intelligence, thus admitting 1% from the top 1%, 80% from the bottom 80%, etc. It would be acting to reduce inequality compared to a world without Dravah.

@rudnicknoah 2/Now, personally, I think that STV is not the best form of proportional representation (#PropRep) — I'd prefer PLACE voting, which is more proportional without giving up simple single-seat districts and simple ballots. But certainly, the original tweet was not wrong about RCV.
@rudnicknoah 1/"Ranked Choice Voting" actually means two things. With single-winner elections, it's also called IRV, which does nothing to gerrymandering. But with multiseat districts, it's called STV, and would be a form of proportional representation — which makes gerrymandering useless.
@CShentrup @beachmagoo @NeolibAlberta @jaglister @Alliance4PR @WendyStephen8 You're simply wrong. For choosing a legislature, a good PR method has higher expected utility than score voting.		And even if that weren't so, Twitter isn't the place for perfect v good fighting. "Choose-one is bad" fits in a tweet, let's argue ?	*after* we fix that.
@rudnicknoah Ah, OK; that makes sense. Thanks.
So if Dems get 3% more votes, they can expect 30 fewer seats. If they get 13% more votes, they can expect just 10 more seats. That gerrymandering disadvantage is even worse than I'd have guessed. 		#EndGerrymandering (ideally with #PropRep, but if not, at least #FairMaps) https://t.co/AkXe9BpUjT
@imillhiser Democrats would do better to increase turnout among Democratic groups, rather than reducing it among republican ones. Mandatory voting, or equivalently, tax rebates for voting: it would help Ds as much as voter ID helps Rs, while actually not being a dirty trick at all.

@laderafrutal Thanks. I knew I was probably doing it a bit wrong. Still, sounds ballpark reasonable.
@laderafrutal Technically "biproportional" means anything that's proportional along two "unrelated" dimensions. Like stratified sampling or latin squares. Could in theory be party/gender or party/ethnicity just as well as party/district. But in practice, latter two are most likely.
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte This has to do with "states rights" issues. Forcing a state to change redistricting and voting machines is hard, if the state doesn't want to. Forcing them to change how they count essentially the same ballots is much much easier.
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte #FairRepAct would be great, but IMO faces several hurdles that PLACE doesn't. First, as you know, I think too many incumbents would be skeptical. Second, even if it did pass, I think it would be tied up in courts for the better part of a decade at least. PLACE is easier/faster.
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte Strongly disagree. This rule is good to avoid hyper-fragmentation. As @laderafrutal was just telling me, the unhealthy fragmentation in Israel is more about mid-sized parties (10-20%) than small ones; that's something PLACE threshold but not 5% threshold would help avoid.
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte I agree that from a philosophical PoV, this rule is mostly superfluous, occasionally even a net negative. But IMO it's worthwhile.	1. Goes hand-in-hand with the 25% threshold (I'll discuss that later re other tweet)	2. Increases accountability—way to vote "against" someone.
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte Not "party-determined". Candidate-determined. Parties too strict on discipline about preferences would be giving up on potential voters; people who will happily vote for faction X of party Y but not for "the party Y machine".
@laderafrutal (Based on table 1, including India; and using 20% top tier which is a total guess.)
@laderafrutal 25% local threshold ⇒ m=3 at first tier? That makes sense to me, and using the SPM numbers from Li&amp;Shugart 2015, gives me an expected ENP of 3.77 — right ballpark, if I'm doing the math correctly.
@gelliottmorris @jack, this is why I NEED APPROVAL VOTING for Twitter polls.
@gelliottmorris OK enough with the "not" ones.
@gelliottmorris Not gonna do it. Wouldn't be Pruitt. https://t.co/2JHccNJBeW
@laderafrutal Is there another term you'd prefer?
@laderafrutal Yes, it's good you made me clarify.
@laderafrutal Agree that nobody advocates high seat product for US. My overall point was that PLACE should not be seen as high seat product, even though it is technically just one at-large election.
@laderafrutal So a 15% party would probably get about 10% seats directly, 5% through larger parties. This would allow mid-sized parties to grow organically, while still reducing Israeli-style fragmentation.
@laderafrutal Roughly speaking, under PLACE, a 10% party would get 0% seats directly, and say in 10% seats of larger parties, because they'd always fail the 25% threshold. A 20% party would get 20% seats directly, because at least 20% would pass the threshold. Roughly linear in between.
@laderafrutal That's a fair response to how I stated the argument. But the fact is, PLACE tends to give 10-20% parties seats via "coalition allies" — that is, to make them work through larger parties.

Pilon is *the* expert on historic election reform. Highly recommended if you're in the area. https://t.co/FlUarW4ynA
@MadisonDilemma I'm assuming that proportional MMP reps are added to current House size, and districts are left the same. I think otherwise it's a non-starter; too disruptive to incumbents.		House should be at least 40% larger anyway.
@MadisonDilemma So in sum: STV, MMP, and PLACE are all on the pareto front as proposals; mix of pros and cons. OLPR is essentially dominated by MMP, and mostly so by STV and PLACE.
@MadisonDilemma ...ie, problems of Poland/Turkey's high thresholds, low proportionality, or those of Israel's low thresholds, party fragmentation/extremism.	* STV is nominally nonpartisan. This is a selling point for some reformers.	* STV has intraparty proportionality. Not a huge deal but nice.
@MadisonDilemma You're right that OLPR is simpler for voters and admins than STV. But it doesn't have all the same advantages.	* STV naturally leads to relatively high thresholds WITH interparty transfers for sub-threshold votes. In OLPR, you'd have to choose one or the other...
@MalcolmBaalman @hill_charlotte I'd be interested to see what you think of my response thread: https://t.co/DM8AKaIZv1
end /thread. I'd be happy to respond to any questions/debate.		@jacksantucci @leedrutman @laderafrutal
And in terms of inherent advantages, I think PLACE hits sweet spot. Every vote matters, simple ballots, maximum voter choice, minimum disruption. Could be imposed by Congress on reluctant states with no change in districts or voting machines. Popular incumbents would still win.
PLACE is, admittedly, a new/untried proposal. That's a hurdle. But that can change before 2021, when #PropRep could pass; cities under section 2 VRA lawsuits, such as Lowell MA or Santa Clara CA, could adopt delegated biproportional methods.
Personally, I think that if the proposal is STV/RCV, the answer is, incumbents wouldn't support it. All Republicans wd oppose: gerrymandering currently helps their party. And at least 10% of Democrats wd oppose: changing to multi-member districts too disruptive, too big a threat.
So we need a #PropRep proposal that Congress can pass.		This passes congressional muster; see, for instance, the Fair Representation Act by @RepDonBeyer. https://t.co/W97FOhT7Pl		But an important question is: why would incumbent reps vote to change a method that elected them?
Thus, proportional representation is best and most complete way to #EndGerrymandering.		State-by-state reform is constitutionally possible, but politically a dead end. Whichever party supports it would just give an advantage to the other party's states.
Nonpartisan redistricting (aka #FairMaps) can help reduce gerrymandering, but can't fix it all the way. There are too many competing requirements (compact districts, competitive elections, partisan fairness, communities of interest, etc.) for any one map to do it all.
Gerrymandering is breaking our democracy. Voters should choose politicians, not the other way around.		The Supreme Court is not gonna help fix gerrymandering. Recent decisions and news have made that clear.
I hope I've succeeded in explaining this clearly while focusing on the simplicity to voters, not the details of the process.		Should you care? Here's why I think you should:
There's one more optional step that doesn't change who won, but helps voters know who their rep is: parties assign winners "extra territory", so that each district is in territory of 1 rep per party.		So if I voted party X but my district winner is party Y, a nearby X is my rep.
That's it for PLACE process. All together:	0. Candidates predeclare allies.	1. Voters choose candidates.	2. Transfer orders are filled in, based on predeclared allies of chosen cand (&amp; other similar ballots for order within those groups)	3. Eliminate &lt;25%, transfer, find winners.
Note that eliminating these candidates with &lt;25% does not mean that the ballots that supported them end up fruitless. They are still transferred, still matter. In fact, because transferred votes go by the predeclared prefs of the candidate, the group has good bargaining power.
So, PLACE avoids excessive party divisions by eliminating any candidate who gets under 25% of the votes from their own local district. In other words, each district has only 2-3 viable candidates; extremist splinter candidates can't win off purely dispersed support.
...You don't want to err in favor of small parties either. Classic example is Israel, whose "closed-list" voting method leads to so many parties that none get even 25% of the Knesset. This leads to extremism, small-minded factionalism, minorities holding the majority hostage.
...The 3rd difference between place and STV has to do with goal ⑤, balancing interests of large &amp; small parties.		US system is too favorable to 2 major parties. This leads to gridlock, polarization, zero-sum politics, etc. PLACE is designed to fix that. But...
There are 3 differences between the transfer process in PLACE and STV:	* In PLACE, transfer order is filled in automatically using delegation; easier for the voter.	* In PLACE, when there's a winner from a district, other cands there are eliminated. Ensures biproportionality.	...
Whenever a candidate has over one quota of votes, they win, and one quota of their votes are removed from the pile.		When a given candidate is clearly unable to win (furthest behind compared to other candidates in their district), they are eliminated, and those ballots transfer.
PLACE's biproportional system is basically delegated STV. Each ballot has a transfer order: first the chosen candidate, then that person's predeclared within-party "faction allies", then the rest of their party, then their other-party "coalition allies".
(Note that British Columbia is having a referendum on proportional representation in November 2018, and, at the suggestion of the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb which I helped organize, they saw fit to include a Canada-designed biproportional method, Dual Member Proportional.)@sean_gra
(This is called "biproportional" representation because it's proportional by party and by geography. It's a relatively new idea; it's been used in Swiss muni elections, eg Geneva, but not exactly as described here. Promising idea, but you don't get it by copying somewhere else.)
For goal ④, "local representation", I have to explain how PLACE chooses winners to ensure both single-seat districts and proportional representation.
Specifically, the ballot looks something like this:		Candidates in the local district are explicitly listed on the ballot. Voters who prefer candidates from elsewhere can write them in, w/ district #. This balances ease of voting for low-engagement voters, max choices for others. https://t.co/YlFL1U0xej
For goals ② and ③, "simple ballots" and "maximum voter choice", PLACE uses *delegation*.		Voters choose one candidate. Then if that choice can't win, the vote is transferred to someone who can, using the original candidate's predeclared preferences to decide who gets the vote.
For goal ①, "every vote matters", almost any #PropRep method is enough; anything that uses quotas as explained above will minimize fruitless votes and maximize equality of fruitful votes.
So, here are the goals of PLACE:	① Every vote matters.	② Simple ballots. Easy to vote.	③ Voters in charge; max possible choices, both within and between parties.	④ Local reps; minimum transitional disruption.	⑤ Balances interests of majority/minority (big/little parties)
PLACE was first proposed about a year ago; it's designed to balance several competing goals. I'm going to explain it the same way, starting from the philosophical goals, and explaining the procedure second. Finally, I'll address some potential objections &amp; compare it to STV/RCV.
So far, everything I've said applies to lots of proportional methods, including the STV/RCV method that @hill_charlotte explained. Now, I'm going to explain the details of the proportional method I favor, PLACE voting. Further info at https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP
How are these quotas used in choosing winners? 		Basically, you find winners one at a time. Every time you find one, you remove one quota of ballots that favored that candidate. Those ballots might have liked someone else even more, but the winner counts as their rep.
So the quota in MA would be just over 10%, 1/10 of the electorate. Generally, this ensures that over 90% of voters get represented, and under 10% of votes are "fruitless". Not perfect, but a heck of a lot better than around 50% of fruitless votes as current choose-one method. https://t.co/noUuqw5NLK
Take the example of my state, MA. We have 9 seats in the US House. So most quota-based #PropRep methods will end up dividing votes into 10 piles — 9 winning piles and 1 losing pile — so that the winning piles are all equal and the losing pile is smaller than them.
Of course, it's usually impossible for literally every voter to be a winner. But if you set that as a goal, you can come awfully close.		How close? This is where the idea of "quotas" comes in. The math can scare people away, but as @hill_charlotte explained it, it's simple.
So at their heart, all proportional voting methods try to ensure that every vote matters equally. 		This is foreign to our usual way of thinking about voting, with winners and losers. In a proportional method, ideally every voter would be a winner.
To me, framing this around equal representation / every vote matters is even more powerful than the standard spiel, which focuses on proportionality.		Yes, disproportional results are unfair. And that's *because* they are "taxation without representation"; unequal voice.
The idea of proportional representation is simple: every vote matters. Every voter deserves equal representation in Congress and state legislatures.		If one group has &gt;48% of the voters but &lt;27% of the seats, as happened in PA 2016, they aren't getting equal representation. https://t.co/IFm1Y3dAil
@Hill_Charlotte has done a good job breaking down the idea of proportional representation for beginners. But she focused on one flavor of #PropRep: single transferable vote, aka ranked choice voting. I'd like to do the same for another flavor, PLACE voting. https://t.co/urT8J8NLQw
@PoliticsWolf The underlying problem is that Florida's periodic constitutional commissions are partisan affairs. If instead they chose a random Citizens' Assembly (sortition), real reforms like approval voting or RCV would have a chance.
This is why drawing #FairMaps is legit hard. The same input–more majority-minority districts–can lead to opposite outcomes in different contexts. Trying for #FairMaps is better than not trying, but to really #EndGerrymandering you need proportional representation. #PropRep https://t.co/fIT7M7Ex8B

@MadisonDilemma In other words: I didn't forget it, I just think it doesn't deserve a place in the debate. Largely that's because I'm comparing it to Bavarian MMP, which is better than average for MMP.
@MadisonDilemma OK, fine.	Open-list	Pros: Simple ballots.	Cons: No local/personal reps. Dominated by MMP and/or PLACE in basically every way.

@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma @leedrutman BTW those numbers come from Louis Masicotte's presentation at the BC PR symposium. Don't think he's on Twitter.
@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma @leedrutman Regional vote is open list, with ballot order chosen by party. In Bavaria, high ballot order is a moderate advantage, but not an overwhelming one; voters override in 66/274 (24%) of cases since 2003. Seems healthy to me.
@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma @leedrutman Big picture:	I think that MMP is probably politically nonviable — requires 2 reforms at once.	I suspect that STV is too — incumbents would fear it was too disruptive. @jacksantucci disagrees.	I think PLACE is best of all worlds, but admit it's new&amp;weird. That's a fixable problem.
@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma @leedrutman This is pretty resistant to decoy lists; probably resistant enough. If you want even more resistance, make it so that winning constituency votes count double, and the regional vote on those ballots are ignored.
@laderafrutal @MadisonDilemma @leedrutman There are. Here's the "bavarian w/transfers" solution I'm talking about:		2 votes, constituency and regional list. Both count equally towards party proportions. If one is for a party that gets 0 seats (sub-threshold?), transfers, so the other party (if any) counts for both parts.
@MadisonDilemma @smith_harvard 2/As for false flag candidates, this is a matter of intraparty vote efficiency. It would be unusual for a group to naturally vote so unstrategically as to have systematically lower efficiency. If it were a problem, you could do intraparty delegation, a la PLACE; but I doubt it.
@MadisonDilemma @smith_harvard 1/I specifically suggested Bavarian-style MMP with inter-party transfers. This is resistant to decoy lists. Depending on the complexity voters will tolerate, it could be made even more resistant by "using up" votes which were successful locally (counting them 100% for that party)
@MadisonDilemma @smith_harvard How do you mean? Are you talking about essentially false-flag candidates?
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 7/Obviously, I spend time tooting the horn of PLACE: https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP		You might discount that; it is my own invention, and I'm well aware that the set "guys with methods they designed themselves" includes plenty of crackpots. I hope I've paid enough dues to escape that.
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 6/Something else?	IMO, no other option rivals the above 4. I guess you could make a case for DMP or something like it. But other than that, I've thought about dozens of methods, and those are the clear frontrunners.
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 5/MMP (Bavarian-style plus interparty transfers):	Pros: Simple ballots, decent intraparty choice.	Cons: Would require simultaneously increasing size of House. Creates two classes of representative. Not proportional w/in parties.
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 4/PLACE/other delegated, biproportional method:	Pros: Simple ballots. High proportionality. Max breadth of voter choice, including intraparty. Local chain of accountability.	Cons: New&amp;weird. Antipartisan reformers dislike partisanness (though it's not as important as they think)
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 3/Mid-magnitude STV (STV-5 or STV-7. This is probably what people mean by "multiseat RCV"):	Pros: Has a track record both in and out of US. Attractive to anti-partisan reformers.	Cons: Weakens parties too much? Complex ballots; might disenfranchise? Centralized vote-counting.
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 2/Low-magnitude STV (ie, STV-3):	Pros: relatively nonthreatening to major parties.	Cons: See "pros". Allows for a nontrivial amount of gerrymandering. (Roughly 1/4 as much?). Somewhat complex ballots.
@leedrutman @MadisonDilemma @laderafrutal 1/There is no consensus. Various options:
@laderafrutal @leedrutman @MadisonDilemma 2/You could of course just throw that all into the lap of general election voters; with better voting methods, nothing would break if you did. But it seems a bit daunting to have double or more the number of names on the ballot. I think primaries could still have a place.
@laderafrutal @leedrutman @MadisonDilemma 1/I'm not so sure. If you had "moderate multipartyism" (that is, rules that lead to a relatively low effective # parties in the 3-4 range), there would still be significant jockeying for position in "big tent" parties.
@emayfarris Must be a Russian troll. No true American could possibly be this ign... I can't say it.		How could Russia possibly have known that ignorance and division were our weak points?
Aaak 50/50 is the worst! Once one option takes the lead, please consider voting to increase that lead, even if you weakly prefer the other.

Let's settle this once and for all:
@leedrutman @laderafrutal Ie, the model for reform is UK 1832, not more modern cases of PR reform elsewhere, even though the goals resemble the latter more.
@leedrutman @laderafrutal Once you get a chicken or egg, it becomes a virtuous cycle. But the dino DNA that lets you build the first egg is disgust at current rigged systems, whether it's gerrymandering nationally or at-large plurality in places like Lowell or Santa Clara.
@laderafrutal @leedrutman "Basic" is doing a lot of work there.		Obviously, "can be" depends on which counterfactuals you allow. Fact is, it's related. I believe that if the US develops into a multiparty system, election reform is likely to come first. YMMV but there is certainly evidence on my side.
@DavidEButler1 @PoliticsWolf No, he doesn't. He's said before that Puerto Ricans should have a say, and that they should get a good deal. 		Past referendums have been more or less theoretical.

We should be having that debate — in Congress, not in the courts.		In the courts, as you say, these cases are (as is proper) NOT about #PropRep. For instance, efficiency gap measure springs from equal protection and 1a thinking; not what you'd derive from proportionality. https://t.co/aByX4mZUte

@jacksantucci 4/...this doesn't mean that reform should pander to those incumbents. But it does mean their concerns are a legit part of mechanism design; it can't all be motivated by anti-party fervor. I think PLACE is a win-win compromise that has something for all sides.		Finally...

@jacksantucci 2/I'm not saying that PLACE "guarantees D majorities", "threatens no incumbents", or "poses no risk of 3rd-party victory". In each case, PLACE is actually far *more* responsive to shifts in voter sentiment than current system, so no guarantees are possible.
@jacksantucci 1/Unfair in every regard. 		I'm not hunting; I'm promoting an actual reform.		As for my goals, they are not hard-and-fast guarantees as you suggest, but rather marginal differences from STV. My honest read of "minimum viable" to pass Congress.

@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts There are two groups of detractors. One is, as you say, motivated by (partisan or intrapartisan) political concerns, and is completely ungettable. You're right that such objections should be ignored or scoffed, not accommodated.		But looking forward, there will be another group:
@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts 7/Note that Ⓐ and Ⓔ both mean that PLACE could be better for turnout than STV. And that, in turn, is good for both small- and large-D democrats.	/end
@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts 6/	ⒺBroader voter choice; this is good especially for clear communities of interest within parties. If I'm generally on board with platform of party X, but especially care about issue Y or demographic subgroup Z, I'm more likely to have a candidate I can love under PLACE.
@laderafrutal NY is pretty unfriendly to primary voters. I'm glad @Ocasio2018 won, but higher turnout would be healthier, and on average may be in the interests of incumbents. Let's see if this result accelerates the push for reform.
@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts 5/	ⒹSimilarly, STV undermines party unity, could lead to an "every candidate for themselves" dynamic. PLACE, though it has room for viable independent candidates, also has room for clearer party (and intraparty-faction) unity/cooperation, which IMO is healthy.
@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts 4/Or, to put Ⓒ in (weakly) anti-STV rather than pro-PLACE terms: STV atomizes/individualizes coalition-building.

@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts Voting method design is not simple; there are tradeoffs. But it should not be a shock that best practices in 2018 can beat what Thomas Hill invented 1819, in multiple simultaneous respects.
@jacksantucci @mlatner @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts I think PLACE has advantages over STV in both tactical and philosophical senses. And that's not just coincidence or (I don't think) motivated reasoning; it's because I designed it with both things in mind.
@mjs_DC En español: Si, se puede. La Corte Suprema ha endosado a politicas racistas que nos pone en desventaja injusta, pero podemos sobrepasarlas.		Ganar en 2018 y 2020, a pesar de lo injusto, y luego cambiar las reglas. Es difícil. Pero es lo que tenemos que hacer.
@mjs_DC Yes, they can. The Supreme Court has ratified racist policies that put them at an unfair disadvantage, but it can and must be overcome. 		Win in 2018 and 2020, despite unfairness, then change the rules and make them fair again. Yes, it's hard. But it's what we have to do.
@mlatner @jacksantucci @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @laderafrutal @BillTieleman @StrategicThghts That's fine. Holding your breath accomplishes nothing. If you want it to happen, use breath for voice.		Gerrymandering (and polarization) are huge problems for voters, D &amp; R alike. There are various possible solutions, w/ advantages and disadvantages. Now is time to speak up.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra A biproportional method could absolutely change this. The losing votes in the rural districts with the biggest margins would transfer to those with narrower margins, meaning there would be various parties winning in rural districts.		(Details depend on specific method, of course)
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra PLACE voting has single-winner ridings, but then each riding is included in the territory of one winner per party. Best of both worlds.		(None of the #PR4BC options have purely single-winner ridings, so this conversation is merely theoretical for now.)
@leedrutman The Supreme Court itself is now the "political problem".
4/Note that "neither" isn't a good answer to this question. It's actually harder, not easier, to explain a voting method if the details are up in the air.
3/So, the question, which is better:		A. Talk about which MMP form is best (Bavarian w/transfers).		B. Talk about post-referendum process for choosing MMP form.		There are contexts where you can (and thus should) do both. But in many cases, you only have room for one. So, which?
2/...then I think the government would respect that when setting the details.		That's putting some faith in the process. But I don't see "LOL who knows, maybe MMP is closed list" as more honest, really. Not saying which MMP form is better is leaving *more* out, not less.
1/A question for the yes-#PR4BC movement: how to talk about MMP. Part of me wants to assume the best, and talk up a Bavarian-style system with transfers, as we recommended at https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb. If MMP passes, and the "yes" campaign was clear that Bavaria is model...
@sean_gra @SirTrevbot @Kelsoh Thanks, Sean.		"Biproportional" means double guarantee: geographic proportionality (districts) and partisan proportionality. MMP can be seen as weakly biproportional, but newer methods like DMP are more strongly/clearly so. I think this is the way forward, for Canada, US, and UK.
As always, I still think #PropRep is a fuller way to #EndGerrymandering than #FairMaps. But we can't be too picky; we should be pushing for both. And Wang is right that we in the data community have an important job for #FairMaps — even more important after Benisek and Gill. https://t.co/jcj1YRzOyv
Another data point that "Proportional Representation" is a better rallying call to #EndGerrymandering than "Ranked Choice Voting". Focus on the end, not the means. cc: @davedaley3 @mcpli @leedrutman @mlatner @laderafrutal @jacksantucci https://t.co/MJDviBCRqH
2/If I were running the official "yes" campaign, I'd be getting people to sign a two-part pledge: vote yes, and canvass/phonebank neighbors in November. Fewer people would sign than just a voting pledge, but a lot more meaningful.	/end
1/Reminder to "yes #PR4BC" folks: owning @BillTieleman on Twitter is fun, but not the way this campaign will be won. He'll save his government money for a last-minute advertising blitz, using freshly-picked cherries; you must build up enough grassroots energy to counter that.
@davedaley3 @ACNewman I think we should be aiming for structural reforms (such as #PropRep) in 2021, not just "longer term".		It's a long shot, but at this point, so is America.

@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra Again, I'm with you on this. The https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb recommended 5 methods: STV, (Bavarian-style) MMP, DMP, RUPR/FDPR, and LPR. Of those, @Dave_Eby chose MMP, DMP, and RUPR. I don't know why.		But any of these options is still far far far better than current choose-one FPTP.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra Great! You have every right to support the system you like the best! And to share your opinions on Twitter!		But please double-check your facts, or at least say "I think", before you try to contradict my factual statements.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra I'm looking at this from the point of view of someone who wants to #EndGerrymandering in the USA, and thinks that biproportional (single-member, but NOT monopolistic) methods are the most viable proposal for accomplishing that. This isn't just abstract math here.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra @MikeSchreiner 2/More generally: I'm saying that it's possible to combine single-winner districts with proportional representation. You're saying it's not possible. Even if I didn't have citations (and I do), your categorical statement has a higher burden of proof than my contingent one.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra @MikeSchreiner 1/Please read up on PLACE (https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP). It guarantees one winner per district, but then assigns extra territory to each winner, so that each district has one representative per party. Thus, single-winner districts without local power monopoly.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra I'm not saying DMP has no flaws. For instance, I don't like the low degree of intraparty choice it gives. But purely for proportionality, it's clearly the best of the 3 options, not at all merely "moderate".
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra We're on the same side on this. I think your advocacy is great, and your analysis of Canadian politics is incisive. Can we stop fighting please?
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra DMP respects province-wide proportionality, with a threshold of 5% (and possibility of overcoming that threshold on a per-district level even if not province-wide).		Please, let's stop arguing. Dm me. I can cite sources for my claims. As far as I can tell, you can't.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra Again, DMP actually has best proportionality, as measured by Gallagher index, of the 3 options on the #PR4BC ballot. The other 2 options would break up province into regions, and be proportional only within each region — that creates an effective natural threshold of &gt;8%.
@laurelrusswurm 2/I helped organize the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb. That included top Canadian experts on PR, respected academics. LPR was one of our recommended *proportional* methods. Claiming that LPR somehow isn't proportional would put you way out of the mainstream. But maybe I misunderstand.
@laurelrusswurm 1/So, just to be clear, you're saying that Michel Balinski, Jean-Pierre Kingsley, Anthony Hodgson, etc. are just making things up?		Biproportional methods (with magnitude&gt;1, but same idea) are used for municipal elections in Switzerland. Theory is solid &amp; there's empirical too.
RT @GovGerry: Once again, the US Supreme Court keeps me (and the nation) waiting for a clear decision on partisan #gerrymandering ... 🙄  ht…
8/And of course, by talking about #PropRep not just multi-member districts, you can take advantage of the international momentum here. That includes #PR4BC, the movement in the UK (@MakeVotesMatter), the successful reform in NZ, etc.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra I organized the BC PR symposium. I designed the E Pluribus Hugo proportional method, used by thousands of voters to nominate the Hugo awards. I'm a board member of the Center for Election Science, and a doctoral candidate at Harvard. I really do know what I'm talking about here.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra 4/ps. I follow you because of your good #PropRep advocacy. I'm very much on your side! Please, double check before you contradict me. In this case, you were mistaken.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra 3/This is not "electoral monopoly" because even if you "lose" in your own district your vote still helps elect a candidate you like in some other district. In fact, PLACE even assigns your district as "extra territory" to a winner from your party. So &gt;90% of voters have a rep!
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra 2/Biproportional methods with single-member districts, such as LPR, PLACE, or FMV (each linked earlier) do the same: combine at-large and district results to assign 1 winner per district.
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra 1/DMP offers excellent proportionality province-wide, not just "moderate" proportionality; would probably have lowest Gallagher (disproportionality) index of any of the #PR4BC options. It can do that because it uses province-wide results to help choose winners in small districts.
@laurelrusswurm @fairvote I'm not suggesting IRV! At all!		I'm saying that #ProportionalRepresentation/#PropRep includes many possible methods: STV, MMP, DMP, PLACE, etc. Each has advantages and disadvantages. Saying "multimember" instead of "proportional" ties you to certain disadvantages—bad strategy.
@laurelrusswurm Wrong. 	Of course you're right that FPTP has single-member districts and is the opposite of #PropRep. But biproportional methods can have both:	https://t.co/o6gmHBnpQt	https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP	https://t.co/9XqQ6ToNFO	... (or others)
@laurelrusswurm @sean_gra You are correct; that was a bit of bait-and-switch. The word for a method that combines at-large proportionality with single-member districts is "biproportional". But that could also describe methods with small-magnitude districts that have more than 1 member, like DMP.
7/Even if you believe that RCV is the best way to fix gerrymandering, you should be talking about "proportional representation" rather than "multi-member districts". May the best reform win — now is the time for as much unity as possible. (I'm looking at you, @leedrutman)
6/"Ranked Choice Voting" is getting a lot of good press recently (good job, @fairvote). This is actually two voting methods: IRV for single-winner races (mayor, governor) and STV for multi-winner (Congress). STV would be great. But we must NOT put all our eggs in that basket.
5/Such methods are pretty new; we can't just copy some &gt;30-year-old model from another country. But the theory is well-established enough that one such method, DMP (invented by @sean_gra), is on the ballot in the #PR4BC referendum in British Columbia.
4/I live deep in the weeds on voting theory, and I'd be happy to lead tours, but the simple version is: minimum disruption means using #PropRep methods that keep single-member districts. The jargon term is "biproportional" methods.
3/The #FairRepAct by @RepDonBeyer is a good beginning for a model here. But as is, it'll never get more than "progressives" on board — optimistically, 70% of Democrats. Not enough. We need maximum effect for fair representation with minimum disruption for incumbents.
2/Remember, this #NewVRA must come from US Congress. Courts won't save us. The relevant state legislatures are more likely to be bad guys than good. State initiatives don't work everywhere &amp; are too easily subverted. So #NewVRA must be something &gt;90% of D incumbents can support.
1/The Supreme Court has refused to fix gerrymandering yet again. No savior is coming. We must save ourselves. Here's how:	1. Vote in 2018 and 2020. The survival of the 🇺🇸 depends on it.	2. Democratic majorities pass #NewVRA, imposing #PropRep on gerrymandered states.
@leedrutman As before, I say: right idea, wrong messaging. Proportional representation is the end, multimember districts are just one possible means, and not the best one. Proportional methods with single-member districts (aka biproportional methods) give simpler ballots, better outcomes.

@leedrutman 2/Fourth and final point:		4. So to pass #PropRep, US will need a custom-designed method, something that hasn't been used elsewhere. PLACE is one option: https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP But whether or not you like that specific option, the mechanism design conversation has to happen NOW.
@leedrutman 1/Yes. 3 points:		1. #PropRep is the only complete way to #EndGerrymandering.	2. To pass it, you need at least 1 major party in support.	3. Biproportional methods that piggyback off of existing districts, or MMP and bigger House, are the only ways to get incumbent support.

@MrWalterShapiro @scottkall @progressnerd @LarryDiamond In other words: you may not like 3rd party advocates, but you shouldn't be afraid to ally with them if it helps Brennan Center goals.
@MrWalterShapiro @scottkall @progressnerd @LarryDiamond Of course those dissatisfied with current system like the idea of reform. But smart voting reform is win-win. Concerns of enfranchisement, of healthier major parties, of healthier (even if still small) 3rd parties, and of avoiding billionaires buying elections can all advance.
@MrWalterShapiro @laderafrutal Ok, that's funny, I admit.		But I'm saying that from my point of view Maskin&amp;Sen are "a tad different" from top-2 backers.
@MrWalterShapiro @scottkall @progressnerd @LarryDiamond I think the problem is you're doing cost-benefit analysis without the benefits, because you've pigeonholed them as "goo-goo" fantasies. Main benefit of smart reform isn't changes to the party system, it's more and fuller enfranchisement for voters. Which goal we aren't doomed on.
@MrWalterShapiro @laderafrutal "Both Mao and Carnegie reflect concern for steel production, even if they have different remedies."
Greg has it exactly right. Majority-based methods are a failsafe against unqualified celebrity candidates, not a way for them to sneak in. https://t.co/yu9Rl38n4j
@MrWalterShapiro @laderafrutal They were fudging a bit. It's clear their preferred reform is Condorcet, where "moderate" slant is stronger. "Ranked choice" describes Condorcet just as much as it does IRV.		But my main point isn't whether IRV favors moderates. It's that guilt by association with top 2 is weak.
@MrWalterShapiro @laderafrutal Again, the NYT editorial was talking about a different reform. But more importantly, Maskin and Sen are both Nobel winners; no comparison to a half-assed LAT editorial.		"You sound like that other guy who was wrong" would be a weak argument even without the Nobels.
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter @ElectionScience  https://t.co/MZvGpwobXI
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter @ElectionScience 3/On the current system: choose-one voting disenfranchises many. Gerrymandering, spoiled elections (remember 2000?), lower turnout, increases power of money and polarized/hijacked partisan primaries... Etc, etc. Fixing this goes hand-in-hand with Brennan Center mission. /end
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter @ElectionScience 2/On reform side, your concerns are not unreasonable, but overblown. Better voting methods are more of a failsafe than an additional failure point. Ie, far more likely to stop a Trump than to elect a Bloomberg/Perot. I have data, but... Twitter.
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter @ElectionScience 1/I really hope we're not doomed to disagree. I see two basic points of disagreement, neither one a dead end: you see dangers in reform that I think are overblown, and I see defects in the status quo that go to heart of Brennan Center mission.
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter @ElectionScience Fear, uncertainty, and doubt. The term comes from a leaked Microsoft strategy memo in the 90s: "you're already using Windows, changing would be dangerous". Choose-one voting is more out-of-date and user-unfriendly than Windows 95.
Note, "FUD" is often dishonest, but not in this case. Shapiro is wrong here but he's sincere. And he does great work otherwise.
I have huge respect for @BrennanCenter's fight to protect voting rights. Voting reform, done right (that is, at least as good as IRV, ideally even better as @ElectionScience suggests; not top two) is part of that same fight. Sad to see @MrWalterShapiro spreading FUD. https://t.co/emsisuKB5Q
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter But Brennan Center should be at the forefront of fighting against current wasted vote system! Gerrymandering is precisely the partisan weaponizing of wasted votes.
@MrWalterShapiro @BrennanCenter We have a horrible voting system in general. It's possible to design a fix that solves wasted votes without killing parties. Top two is a bad example: theorists like me hated it from the start. Nationwide, parties have veto power over reform, so it won't be what you fear.
@MrWalterShapiro @jacksantucci @BrennanCenter In other words, "centrist" bias of Condorcet, not to mention IRV, is overplayed, and parties do fine with either.
@MrWalterShapiro @jacksantucci @BrennanCenter Maskin and Sen were talking about majority voting (aka Condorcet), not IRV, with their point about centrism.		In 2016, Bloomberg would have gotten slaughtered with any voting method. Bernie woulda won: https://t.co/Gj5Nebx77p
@BillTieleman @DevonRowcliffe @SuzanneAnton Austria has a problem: far right voters. #PropRep has nothing to do with it.		Go ahead, offer an Austrian leftist the US voting system; they'll laugh in your face.
@jacksantucci @leedrutman 1/Key is, voting method should be able to give what voters want, whatever that is. Choose-1 (FPTP) doesn't allow parties to shift from major to minor, without huge problems. Israeli closed list doesn't allow insurgents to gain power in an existing party, so they have to split.
@jacksantucci @TimRothIRV @KristinEberhard @ValisJason Tweeting one-handed because today I actually am chopped. Arm surgery.
@jacksantucci @TimRothIRV @KristinEberhard @ValisJason So I'm chopped liver?
@nspector4 3% of the voters should have a decisive say in 3% of the seats. But a candidate who can't agree with other candidates representing more than 3% of the votes shouldn't be one of the options. No "that guy" MLAs.		All 3 #PR4BC systems could do this–transfer sub-threshold votes.

@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight @sean_gra There, I pitched both advantages and process in one tweet.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight @sean_gra Simplest voting, maximum breadth of choice, max chance of casting an effective ballot.		How does it work? You choose a candidate, either locally or at large. If they don't win, they pass your vote to a predeclared ally (within party first). Process guarantees 1winner/district.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight @sean_gra That's an option, but not the canonical DMP, which is that the two candidates in each district have a predefined order. This prevents vote-splitting issues.		It's a trade-off, but even with the version you suggest voters have a lot less intraparty choice than in PLACE.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight @sean_gra Open *between* districts, but closed *within* them. Since you vote within districts, that means no intraparty choice for voters; order within each list of two is set by party.		Again, ask @sean_gra for details.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight That's not the canonical version of DMP. District party lists of 2 are closed, not open, canonically. Otherwise, there's issue when partisan plurality and individual plurality disagree. @sean_gra can explain.

@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight It may be "radical" to a political scientist. But the task for a voter is pretty traditional.		Also, "I'm skeptical because I think others will be" is self-fulfilling, not helpful. I get that it makes sense in some cases but it should imply high burden of proof.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight 2/2	My previous tweet compressed all that into "parties have too much say" which was a bit off-target. But lack of intraparty choice is really my biggest issue with DMP. Not a fatal flaw but a real one.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight 1/In DMP, parties have no say which districts their winners come from. But they do choose which candidate comes first in each district. Also, geographic distribution is pretty predictable. And voters have just 1 option per party, no intraparty choice.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @MalcolmBaalman @FiveThirtyEight DMP is, effectively, a kind of one-vote, biproprortional MMP. The downside, as you say, is that parties, not voters, have too much say in which candidates get which seats.		PLACE is biproportional, delegated STV. Simpler ballots, more voter choice, less disruptive, more viable.

@laderafrutal You're right, it's not a real law. But this particular case happens to be one where it actually does apply. Flake can't achieve his goals by just starting a new party.
@leedrutman @nytopinion I'd say they made a case for voting reform in general. It's clear that "RCV" isn't their preferred reform.
@laderafrutal Well... Duverger's.
@StewartPrest Yes, it's about tradeoffs. Different people find different ideal points. (And theorists like me spend too much time exploring Pareto frontier.) But FPTP pins the dial on one side... I don't think it would get support from more than 10% of people if it weren't for status quo bias.

@jacksantucci @FukuyamaFrancis And what I'm saying is that PLACE, imposed by congress on high-efficiency-gap states only, is even more compatible with "weak 2 party system" than STV is. Long term there would be a couple smaller parties too but still mostly 2 big ones. Short term, minimally disrupive.
@jacksantucci @FukuyamaFrancis I get what you're saying but it seems to be shifting ground. Do you agree that PLACE would leave fewer 3rd party winners &amp; also fewer wasted votes than m=5 STV? If not, why not? If so, don't those facts make PLACE more viable &amp; more proportional, respectively?
@jacksantucci @FukuyamaFrancis Situation with gerrymandering is breaking new ground. As never before, one of the parties in a two-party system would benefit from #PropRep (with high enough threshold / low enough magnitude).
@sean_gra @chadskelton @j_mcelroy I still kinda wish PLACE had been considered. Simplicity and locality of DMP but voters have even more intraparty choice than STV or MMP.		But 3 choices is enough, and the ones they have are all pretty good -- even better than average #PropRep country today.
@jacksantucci @FukuyamaFrancis How does STV assuage fears of multiparty results more than PLACE? Consider M=5 STV in PA: 17% threshold and 16% wasted votes. With PLACE, that's 25% threshold and &lt;5% wasted votes; more representation with less disruption.
Thanks, @FukuyamaFrancis. If you agree with this article, @ElectionScience (https://t.co/x13BFWom8i) is out there doing the work to make it happen -- they can use your support. https://t.co/7js5k8cdtC
@mcpli Textbook evaporative cooling. Which is a form of polarization but as a symptom not a cause of other problems.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote Sure, OK. My point is that 2-tier is still 2-tier. If I were a party leader under DMP I could learn more from 1-vote MMP examples than from small-magnitude closed list ones.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote Getting reformers to agree on just 1 proposal is legit hard. (Ironic that collective action isn't easier for its theorists.)		Citizens' Assembly would be best solution. BC referendum is sloppy seconds. Anything in that form would be attacked for complexity so DMP marginal meh.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote But at tier 1, only candidate 1 can win. So to me tier 1 is like tier 1 of any other MMP version.		Ie, not technically nominal, but nominal enough to be MMP.
@KDWilliams7 @laderafrutal @jacksantucci But in US, false majority followed by wave election (large majority in votes, smaller and more fragile in seats). That is to say, gerrymandering.
@KDWilliams7 @laderafrutal @jacksantucci Best recipe for change seems to be false majority followed by minority. https://t.co/0wCVNmlYDs
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote DMP prioritizes simple guarantees (2 winners per district, proportional) over simple process. While it's not my favorite option, I like that philosophy. (Witness PLACE).
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote Agree that in district sense lists are closed. But order in which candidates get extra seats not up to party.		In https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb we discussed this. We recommended "no methods w/ regional or provincial closed lists." DMP is still more closed than I'd like but not so bad.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote To a certain degree, "nominal" or not is just terminology. If I mark ✔️ next to "Fulano &amp; Mengano, party X" is that a nominal vote for Fulano or a party vote for X?
@SamWangPhD The answer to "would X make things more proportional" is never more than "well, kinda" unless X is "guaranteeing more proportionality". In other words, we need to be talking about #PropRep.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote If party gets seat 2 but not seat 1, it goes to candidate 1. Yes, they could get both; typically that happens when they get &gt;2/3 of district or (above half and in top x percentile for their party) where x&lt;50 is complicated.
@laderafrutal @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @fairvote First seat is effectively a nominal tier. Second seat is effectively list tier.		Closed list or open? Neither. List order is based on # of votes, as in open list, but voters have no intraparty choice, as in closed list. So geography rules &amp; certain areas are safe seats.
@jacksantucci @profmusgrave Wonder if that's secretly what inspired Hairspray.🙃
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @laderafrutal On trivial level, a century ago we didn't have, say, DMP, PAD, or MJ (those are voting methods, only one of which I designed). I realize that none of these would seem suprising/alien to Gove or Thiele in 1900. But Arrow's thm wd. Also, even increnental progress is still progress.
@jacksantucci @profmusgrave Hairspray?
@jacksantucci @MalcolmBaalman @laderafrutal Please explain further?
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @laderafrutal @fairvote ...again, BC is the example here. DMP is biproportional MMP. Even if they settle on MMP, I'll bet they include new design ideas such as interparty transfers for sub-threshold votes (ie, 2 votes, if just half passes threshold that party counts fully).
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @laderafrutal @fairvote The Fair Representation Act is a great first step, but will never get a majority even of Dems. Too disruptive to incumbents. To pass Congress, even under Dem control, we'll need to incorporate newer design ideas like biproportionality and/or delegation.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @laderafrutal Yes, "RCV" is reaching critical mass in ME, MA, etc, due to some kick-ass organizing. But in practice that's the single-winner version. I still think STV won't fly at state or national level. And apparently BC agrees with me: new prop-rep ideas are blooming.
@jacksantucci @MalcolmBaalman @laderafrutal Voting rights act?		But my point was there is no US precedent for where we are today. New problems, new ways to solve.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @laderafrutal The precedent for US reform isn't New Zealand or Progressive era, it's the Reform Act of 1832. In other words, gerrymandering is the story.
@jacksantucci @laderafrutal At even 1:1:1 odds? Sure. But I'd take US if the other two added up to 5 or more. Which means we've got ourselves a horse race.

@abigaildisney Yes. Step 1, Citizens' Assembly. A voice of the people that can't be gerrymandered.
@jacksantucci Very interesting. Wonder if there's good data for "didn't cast a vote for president in 2016 but voted downballot" and if it would show the same pattern. 3rd party alone probably not quite enough to swing election, but add in "didn't vote" and it's another story.
@BillTieleman If I posted every Trump headline with the comment "FPTP at work again" it would make as much sense as this. But I wouldn't have time for anything else.
@PoliticsWolf @ElectProject Bayesian stats 101 would be useful. P values can be used well. But p values 101 is usually a recipe for disaster, and far too prominent in many basic stat courses.
@laderafrutal Google the names. Vote for one of the 3 with the most hits.		(Only kinda joking)
@PoliticsWolf @ElectProject Intro stats is the worst stats. In a way that's not true for, say, calculus. Nobody expects you to be able to steer spaceships after one calc class but there are lots of published p-values based on half-assed memorized formulas from stat 101.
@grillick @Taniel We have to act as if that's true, yes. But hopefully it isn't: Dem control at Congressional level could lead to #PropRep. #FairBallots are better than #FairMaps to #EndGerrymandering.
Great list of refs for history of #PropRep in America. https://t.co/7Il8FooGzM
@jacksantucci Yes. And PLACE would work better to blend votes of two kinds of voters – engage/factional with partisan/non-factional – into one result than STV. What if your district's candidate for your faction is missing or bad? How do you pick if you only care about party?
@laderafrutal @jacksantucci @KristinEberhard
Here's an in-depth comparison of the methods on the #PR4BC referendum. Columns 1, 3, &amp;4 (Bavarian MMP, DMP, &amp; RUPR) are based on the work of https://t.co/1R02JTwsRR; the others are my own. https://t.co/l7pN9QAQGB
@ahenry85 @JessicaVdV @richardzussman @bcndp @bcliberals 5% is guaranteed floor. For MMP the natural threshold would be higher because there would be only around 12 seats per region. 1/12≈8%
RT @chadskelton: PR experts, help me out: All 3 PR systems proposed for B.C.'s referendum retain more seats per capita for rural areas, but…
@chadskelton @j_mcelroy On RUPR, it's unclear; there are ways to do it either way and those choices would be up to the all-party committee.		Note, we shouldn't fixate too much on these 2nd order effects. Most important thing about PR is PR.
@chadskelton @j_mcelroy You're right on DMP. Rural voters would be slightly overrepresented individually but not in terms of partisan balance. On MMP, you're probably partly wrong; party balance is at regional level, though at least that averages out outlier districts a bit.
@jacksantucci Gove meets Bucklin meets STV, with optional single-vote-MMP-ness. And yeah I guess approval and smiley faces.		But it hangs together a lot better than that sounds.
@jacksantucci Also, unlike PLACE, delegation is optional in PAD.
@jacksantucci @MalcolmBaalman My guess is that this will pass; it will be MMP; and hopefully, Bavarian open list, modified to transfer sub-threshold voting power to other party on ballot if any, and possibly with "semi-open" ("party option") list.		MMP top-ups would be region-specific. Regions of 12-15???
@jacksantucci Basically, it's nonpartisan PLACE. Yes, pretty new.
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal You mean top-up seats. MMP not MMM. And it's not a bad idea.		But I'm also down for adding 235 seats and redistricting. Or switching to #PropRep without changing size (PLACE is the most viable option in that case). Or both.		Size of house &amp; election method don't need to be tied.
@PoliticsWolf Of course, #PropRep is an excellent idea (my favorite option is PLACE voting).		But don't tie good ideas together if you don't have to; they hold each other back more than pull each other forward. #PropRep and a larger House are both good, but can be done separately.

Recommendation M: Follow-up referendum. 		✅ Eby's plan contemplates a re-consideration after 2 elections.
Recommendation L: Materials to accompany ballot. 		✅ for details that will be set before referendum, ❌ for those that won't.
Recommendation K: Citizen deliberation. 		❌ No further formal citizen deliberation process. 		I still hope an NGO will find funding for a Citizens' Jury, but ideally this would have been contemplated and funded in Eby's plan.
Recommendation J: Detailed, neutral information available to voters.		✅ through Elections BC.
Recommendation H: Pairwise comparisons on second question.		❌ Eby recommended counting second question using IRV. At least in theory this could result in a Condorcet failure. Hopefully it won't.
Recommendation G: Wording of questions.		✅ Eby's recommended wording avoids language that would prompt bias, either for or against status quo.
Recommendation F: Two-question ballot. 		✅ Eby's plan is structured as we* recommended.		*Not all members of the BC PR symposium signed on to this recommendation.
Recommendation E: Gender, indigenous, and minority considerations. 		✅ for indigenous: although @Dave_Eby finds that this is out of scope for the referendum, he has a clear recommendation for addressing this issue.	❌ for gender: Not explicitly considered in Eby's plan.
Recommendation D: Choice of methods.		✅ All three methods on the referendum are among those we recommended for consideration.
5/Recommendation C: Careful with MMP details		❌ While the MMP option on the referendum may be chosen with the recommended features, that would happen after the referendum. There is no way for voters to know what details will be chosen when voting on the referendum.
4/Recommendation B: 3 additional considerations for choosing methods. 		✅ All 3 methods on the referendum do well on all 3 considerations.
3/Recommendation A: 7 minimum requirements for methods to be considered.		All 3 methods on the referendum will meet 4 of the requirements, and may possibly meet the other 3 requirements. But they may fail to meet those 3 depending on details to be determined after the referendum.
2/Short version: of the 12 https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb recommendations, @Dave_Eby's plan meets 6 fully, 3 partially, and fails 3. Specifically:
1/@Dave_Eby cited our BC PR symposium 3 times in the written #PR4BC recommendations and once in his press conference — more than any other written #HowWeVote submission. So, how do his recommendations align with ours?

@Dave_Eby In your press conference yesterday, of all the written submissions, you specifically mentioned only the https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb . Thanks! Flattered!		But just to note, primary organizer was @ElectionScience. @SFU_polisci, which you mentioned, was a co-sponsor.
5/These mechanisms are an important part of ensuring true proportionality, so that a party with a minority of support (including indirect support) will never get a majority of seats. @davidshor @laderafrutal @jacksantucci
4/...to the party chosen on the other half. So again, you could vote for a sub-threshold party and still get a representative, albeit not from your first-choice party.
3/Same dynamic is possible under MMP, if a modified Bavarian method is used (as recommended by the BC Symposium on PR). Voters would have two votes, "local" and "list", and both would count for party percentages. If one half of your vote was below threshold, it would transfer...
2/For instance, consider RUPR. I can put my 1st preference on a tiny sub-threshold party, but when that candidate is eliminated, my vote goes to my 2nd preference. I still get a representative, even though I voted for a small party.
1/@Dave_Eby Just listening to the #PR4BC press conference yesterday. You made a misstatement. "In essence, the people who voted for that [&lt;5%] party would not be sending a representative to the LA under that recommendation." This is NOT necessarily true:...
@TheOdalisque @WajahatAli @rabiasquared "their #Palestine activism has (perhaps unwittingly) played into settler colonial narratives." Examples?
@dfarrell_ucd @rkcarty 15 years ago, the Citizens' Assembly almost unanimously endorsed PR. Now there's a referendum on PR. Yes, I realize that the particulars are different, but 2 of 3 methods on new ref weren't even looked at by the CA. Willing to see new evidence≠ignoring old evidence.
@TheOdalisque @WajahatAli @rabiasquared Can you explain what you mean here? Or link it directly?
@VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman 3/The moral? When you're busy twisting any facts to fit your narrative, you're not learning. Most experts support #PropRep, while @BillTieleman, despite his poli sci degree, doesn't seem to actually understand it. Or maybe he does but doesn't want you to.
@VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman 2/Why is this complaint false? Because 2 of 3 methods on #PR4BC referendum have or probably have mechanisms for transfering sub-threshold votes. So even with a threshold, every vote still counts.	...
@VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman 1/@BillTieleman spent months tweeting dire predictions about how #PropRep would turn BC into Austria and enable extremist parties. Not once did he acknowledge a threshold was likely. Now it's clear there will be one, he's RTing false complaints about that. No hobgoblins for him.
@BillTieleman @KeithShaw0 @JessicaVdV @bcliberals Online responses were verified with a probability-weighted sample of 1100 BCers; gold standard scientific poll. Obviously there were differences, but same general pattern. If you're afraid of double-voting, just look at the sampled version.		You're welcome. Next objection?

@KeithShaw0 @JessicaVdV @BillTieleman @bcliberals Fair, as in the same threshold for #PropRep as for FPTP? That's what we're getting now.		Losing the advantage you got last time isn't "unfair".		As for "open": did you get turned away from the #HowWeVote consultation? Looked pretty open to me.
@voteprbc @SethDKlein @Bernardo1130 Going by hashtag usage, it's "prop-rep" not "pro-rep".

@SkottyFootball @j_mcelroy So just vote on the first question.		The people voting on the second question will be your fellow British Columbians, not Martians. They have the province's best interest at heart just as you do.
@cbcnewsbc 69%-11%=58%. Which, coincidentally, is what #PR4BC got in the first (2005) referendum. Looks as if this might come out similarly; and this time, the threshold is fairer (50%), so 58% would pass.
@cbcnewsbc Note that of course those responding to this poll are an arbitrary self-selected group... just like those who chose to respond to the #HowWeVote consultation. But on that poll, difference between self-selected and random samples on this question was only about 11%.

@mlatner @davidshor @TheoLandsman @jacksantucci @PatrickRuffini In the US context, that would just be the house speakership changing more often. Not earthshattering, but probably a net good.		Anyway, US is not gonna have 6 parties. 2 would still dominate. Biggest change is ending gerrymandering, not breaking up parties.

@hill_charlotte Remember: this can be fixed. #FairMaps fixes about 2/3 of the problem. #PropRep (especially a nondisruptive 1-winner-per-district "biproportional" method) fixes it 100%.
@WoodfordCHNL @BillTieleman That's simply a lie on point 1, and arguably one on point 2. On the latter it does depend on details a bit but chances new system would be worse in this sense than status quo are very low, and chances it would be much better are substantial.
@davidshor @mlatner @PatrickRuffini So if the US used PR, it would suddenly become parliamentary? That makes no sense at all.		Are we talking about the US here or not?
RT @WoodfordCHNL: For those interested here is the full #PropRep news conference audio as AG @Dave_Eby unveils electoral reform referendum…
@PatrickRuffini @davidshor I read @davidshor's main critique, about false majorities, as being more that PR *can be* horrible, than that it *is*. And that's precisely to the degree that it's not proportional! Good mechanism design can fix that.
@davidshor @mlatner @PatrickRuffini "Bring down a government" is meaningless in US context. If you can wrangle a different 51% for each bill, then more parties (within reason; not like Israel) is more ways to "yes" just as much as it's more ways to "no". Not true for PM, but US has no PM.
Recommendation 18: Regardless of outcome, there should be a committee to look at ways to improve representation of Indigenous people in British Columbia.		Yes!
Recommendation 17: If the result is "yes", chance to rescind after 2 provincial #PropRep elections.		Yes! This isn't irrevocable, and voters shouldn't fear that it is.
Recommendation 16: Chief Electoral Officer should provide neutral and factual information about referendum and voting systems involved.		Seems good to me.
Recommendations 11-15: Designated proponent and opponent groups. As in 2009, with public funding of $500,000 to either side. OK, now I understand why the number earlier was so low; this combined total seems more reasonable to me, though still on the low side.
Recommendations 8-10: Funding limits of $200,000 for either side, with same funding rules as ordinary campaigns. Agree there should be limits but this seems very low to me. Democracy is important, don't try to cheap out on this.
Recommendation 7, campaign should start July 1 and run to end of voting.		Again, seems pretty uncontroversial.
Recommendation 6: referendum voting should happen between October 22 and November 30 of this year. 		I have no strong opinion here, seems OK to me.
Recommendation 4&amp;5: If #PR4BC wins, an "all-party legislative committee" to recommend details. Should report by March 31, 2019.		As I've said, I'd prefer a citizens' assembly, but this is OK.
Recommendations 2 &amp; 3: more detail on IRV. I've already covered that.
There are other methods (Condorcet, 3-2-1, STAR) which would be better than IRV here, but hopefully, the outcome will be clear enough that it doesn't matter.
For another, exhausted ballots. Wording of instructions suggests that "support one" would be "oppose the other two", but in practice your ballot just exhausts if your chosen method is eliminated.
What's strange about IRV there? For one, center squeeze; a well-liked compromise option could be prematurely eliminated.
Recommendation 1: Two-question ballot. First, #PropRep vs FPTP. Second, rank 3 options. Count second question using IRV.		That's pretty good, but using IRV for that does introduce some weirdness.
Ideally, citizens, not politicians, would be in the driver's seat here: a Citizens' Assembly, as in 2004. I realize that the timeline is tight, but I think it's possible. But OK, having MLAs in charge here isn't the end of the world; these are details.
"The best method for providing transparent public input on design and implementation while ensuring a reasonable timeframe for completion would be an all-party committee of the Legislative Assembly." First point I solidly disagree with.
@BillTieleman will call this a blank check, but he'd criticize it just as much if all the details were set. eg, if districts weren't too big, they'd be too little. He's professionally dissatisfied with #PR4BC and so his criticisms carry no Bayesian evidence of anything.
"Beyond these recommendations, there are a number of design and implementation details that should be left to post-referendum work if the result of the referendum is the adoption of a new voting system." Fair enough, in my book.
I agree with all of that, though if you're doing a threshold, you should have means for inter-party vote transfers for sub-threshold votes. Every vote counts.
3 mandatory criteria for all of the above: ① Just 87-95 MLAs, no more. ② No region would have fewer MLAs than now. ③ 5% threshold at least (artificial or natural).
I'll explain what all that means later, for now, onward!
Now, we come to the meat! Referendum should have 3 systems: DMP, MMP (60% local, other details still unclear), and RUPR/ FDPR. Wow. That's 3 good, courageous options (if the details of MMP are good). Very impressed. #PR4BC FTW!
"A voting system need not be in use elsewhere if it is otherwise suitable for B.C." Interesting, and I strongly agree.
4 key principles for any PR method: proportionality, local representation, simplicity, size of legislative assembly. These seem like the right 4; strong consensus exists on all of them, and probably ends there. Good job so far.
Then some "rah rah, the HowWeVote engagement was a success". But it's all raw numbers, no benchmarks of what would constitute good or bad participation. So, not much here.
Preamble: a disclaimer about @Dave_Eby's neutrality. I've already said: Eby should not be neutral here, he should be allowed to be unabashedly in favor. Statute of Westminster doesn't start "Whereas some say it is meet and proper...". Job of neutrality belongs with @ElectionsBC.
#PR4BC report is out!!! https://t.co/OKoR7MVWTa I'll read now and live-tweet.
@Ultrademocracy Ha!
@jacksantucci @ClayShentrup @hill_charlotte That's exactly it. Not that utilitarianism is correct in any larger sense (that hasn't been tenable since Kahneman&amp;Tversky 1979), but that it's the only *defensible* normative standard. In other words, only way to be normative that's not just "I'm right, you're wrong".
@laderafrutal @mlatner @ValisJason I vote in Cambridge. Counting to 26 (or at least to 10) is not confusing. But separately evaluating and distinguishing my 6th from my 7th preference (or 4th from 5th, or 12th from 15th) kinda is.
@ruthgreenwood Well, at least the #PR4BC announcement tomorrow is definitely happening. I know that's no help for the US-centric election peeps but for me the clear(ish) timeline is def a "worthwhile Canadian initiative".
@BillTieleman We've reached the platonic ideal of a @BillTieleman anti-#PR4BC tweet. "Capital letter Z in Latin writing is alphabetically last, closely followed by Y and X! bc shouldn't capitalize our name!"		It's like 🍒 picking, but at the supermarket.
@laderafrutal You have competition. :^)
@laderafrutal Once the Democrats have power to pass laws, there is just 1 way to fix this: #PropRep, proportional representation. Innovative biproportional methods such as PLACE are non-disruptive enough to hope for unanimous Democratic support. The time to start building that support is now.
@TheOdalisque Bertrand Russell says you're hired.
@PoliticsWolf @sfguy1818 @kirkmurphy ...Hopefully, coming to Lowell, MA.
@PoliticsWolf @sfguy1818 @kirkmurphy AKA center squeeze.		If you want a proportional method for choosing the top 2, to make sure they won't be from same party unless that party has &gt;67% of voters, then use "transferable vote" but not "single": something like PAD. https://t.co/sSur3oJwoN
@laderafrutal Center squeeze. He may not have been among the two most popular, but he was among the two most acceptable, which in a good voting method (like 3-2-1) would be the two finalists. Unfortunately, "hugely acceptable" doesn't make good copy.
@chrislhayes 9/I want to wrap this up with some neat moral. I can't. No parent should have their child taken merely because the two of them have crossed a line on a map. Call your congressperson, your senators. Shame. Shame.
@chrislhayes 8/But now, as I hear of thousands of children being literally ripped from their parents' arms by agents of my government, I think of that story, and it's not funny. At all.
@chrislhayes 7/In the moment, it was kinda terrifying, but I couldn't be distracted, I had to keep talking. And then after it was over, I've mostly laughed about it.
@chrislhayes 6/The moral, for me, was always mostly my own privilege. That soldier had a gun and was nominally in a position of authority over me but my white skin and American passport still protected me.
@chrislhayes 5/I've told that story dozens of times. Cute story that's mildly embarrassing for your kid (except that she's heard it dozens of times so not anymore), it's a go-to.
@chrislhayes 4/The soldier looked at her, looked at me, realized he had no idea what to do next if he took her away from me, and just waved us on.
@chrislhayes 3/I was terrified and started babbling. I was always the English-speaking parent but then I spoke Spanish for the soldier's benefit. "Come on, my daughter, tell the man the truth."
@chrislhayes 2/My daughter was sleeping, I was reading. A soldier made me get out of the car, looked at passperts, woke her up, and asked "is this your father?" My daughter, bleary-eyed from sleep, just shook her head.
@chrislhayes 1/When my daughter was 5, we lived in Chiapas but my in-laws were in Guatemala, a 6 hour bus ride south. One time I was returning from a visit. We'd passed the border, switched vans in Comitan, and got stopped at a checkpoint pulling out of town.

@DunedinPedantry @SaraRFerguson One more thing: em dashes—not hyphens—to set off embedded digressions.
@laderafrutal @jacksantucci For my own intuition, I think of it as "how many of the average voter's party would fit". "Average voter's party" does the squaring because it averages over voters not parties, and "how many would fit" does the reciprocal.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel ...after all, fixing America's broken politics could easily mean things get better by 100s of billions of $s a year. If I can improve the chances of that happening by 0.001%, totally worth it.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel 5/So I'm arguing that something like PLACE may be feasible. Definitely an uphill battle, but one that's worth my time fighting.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel 4/Would Republicans? No way. Gerrymandering helps them on net.		Would Democrats? Not if it threatened their own seat, so no multiseat STV, no MMP. But if not? Maybe. Has benefits to Dems beyond independent redistricting: turnout, representation, etc.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel 3/So they could say "if a state draws a partisan gerrymander, they must then use it with a 1-winner-per-district proportional voting method". The question then is, would Congress pass that law? Ie, political viability.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel 2/Legally, it's definitely doable. Constitution gives Congress "time, place, and manner" power over congressional elections, and arguably 14a "equal protection" and even "republican government" anti-gerrymandering power over state elections.
@davidshor @RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel 1/Adding seats to the senate? If you mean more states, then sure. Other than that: amendment, forget it.		As for #PropRep, I'm not sure if your objections are legal or political...
@RasmusPianowski @davidshor @Neuteufel Fair enough. My main point was that weighted seats in Congress would require an amendment. Ain't happening soon; but less-radical forms of #PropRep might.
@ClayShentrup I mostly agree with your arguments. But the whole "isn't established" is in a frame where someday these will be settled scientific questions. I think that's the wrong attitude, both empirically and as an activist.
@ClayShentrup I do not think that the sim I suggested is The Right Way to decide. But it is just as much The Right Way as VSE is in single-winner cases. That is, useful, but only one of many factors.		Which is my point! You say "PR is a faith thing" but that's true of your arguments too.
@ClayShentrup 4/More to the point, though, this whole "isn't established" frame is BS. You want everybody to accept utilitarianism, and think anyone who doesn't is irrational. You're wrong on latter, and even if you weren't, you'll never succeed at former.		PR is established &gt; proportional.
@ClayShentrup 3/Meanwhile, even "perfect utility-maximizing single-winner" elections in each district separately will have an error term governed by variance and skew of distribution of district means. Unlike the former, this doesn't asymptotically disappear. Worse!
@ClayShentrup 2/For simulation purposes, you can do "perfect PR" by stratified sampling. So outcome of second-level election will only differ from doing a one-stage election by an error term which shrinks with sqrt-num-of-seats.
@ClayShentrup 1/If utilitarianism (ie, VSE) is your be-all-and-end-all, then yes, it *is* substantiated that perfect PR is better than the best single-winner reform in single-member-districts. You can just run two-stage elections: first elect a "parliament", then have them elect a "PM".
@_AliciaAudrey @IjeomaOluo @ryanjbell How manyyy?	😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@davidshor @Neuteufel @RasmusPianowski I'd rather 3-2-1 over IRV for that (no center squeeze, https://t.co/XIdFOTPiAx), but overall it's a great idea.		Without changing US constitution, though, you can get most of those benefits from PLACE: https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP
@RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel @davidshor When I say "represented", I mean "your ballot helped elect a winner". In many PR methods, you could in principle trace connect each ballot to a winner, even if usually people don't; so I'd say those voters are "represented, but don't know by whom". #SorrySemantics
@almodozo @davidshor @mlatner @jacksantucci Also note that if 40/20/40 is the norm, there will occasionally be a 51/19/30 or 30/19/51 election as an exception. So "moderate minority always in charge" is nowhere true.
@almodozo @davidshor @mlatner @jacksantucci In other words, the moderates are always riding shotgun, and get to decide who drives each leg, but don't actually take the wheel.
@almodozo @davidshor @mlatner @jacksantucci Ideally (in my book) the 20% moderates would be able to negotiate a deal, playing both sides against each other; but then would have to keep that deal for some period of time, couldn't constantly threaten to break it.
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf @almodozo @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman But gerrymandering and general FPTP-FUBAR can also be a persistent wedge between true center and apparent DW-NOMINATE center.
@jacksantucci As I said downthread, it's technically possible that this is rational one-shot strategy, but far more likely to be rational only as a setup for post-election resentment. Sore loser tell.
RT @jacksantucci: Candidate asking voters to not use any rankings beyond a "1" for her. Not sure how that could be a winning strategy, even…
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf @almodozo @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman DW-NOMINATE is not a good measure of where the center of the electorate is, just the center of the construct (kind of a moving average of congressional center, I guess). Especially events like 1929 (or 2001) can drive a big wedge between those things.
@massivetotoro @jacksantucci Seems to me that the ME case is not about one-shot strategy, but repeated game strategy. Ie, readying a bloody shirt: "I lost, but it was only because THOSE PEOPLE used their ssneaky cheating RCV."		That could work in future campaign, either as a "serious" argument, or as grift.
@massivetotoro @jacksantucci That strategy only "works" (in a one-shot sense) if you convince more people, in absolute numbers, to forego ranking someone else "2" than to forego ranking you "2". That's plausible in your scenario — could be lower relative numbers and still higher absolute ones — but not in ME

@efalchuk Well, almost eliminated. As long as Blankenship finished behind Morrissey, RCV would transfer votes and avoid spoilage. But if not, center squeeze. Takes approval, 321, or STAR to fully fix things.

@RasmusPianowski @Neuteufel @davidshor That sounds right, but isn't. FPTP, no matter how you implement it, means over 1/3 of voters are unrepresented ("wasted votes"). PR, done well, can get that under 5%. Might as well have said "…including hereditary dictatorship"; all systems aren't created equal.
RT @MaxwellACameron: @BillTieleman @SuzanneAnton Yes, exactly like that. You should preach what you practice ;)
@BillTieleman I'm sure @GovGerry can come up with a few more examples that are even more typical of how FPTP works... #PR4MA #MApoli #MANDRP

@TheoLandsman @profmusgrave @mattyglesias Agreed, but Alexander does make good arguments against the "0% unemployment" version of a JG.
@ClayShentrup If I make something, there's no negative externality in letting me decide how to use it.		If I make a fence around something, the negative externality is that other people can't use it.		Land exists before fences. Fences often have positive value that outweighs negatives. But....
@MalcolmBaalman @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @leedrutman 3/...that means that transfers of sub-threshold votes, as we've been discussing, is super-important for the US context.		I, of course, think that all this points to PLACE as the way forward. YMMV. But certainly we have to consider more than just same old systems. /end
@MalcolmBaalman @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @leedrutman 2/...if we want reform to actually happen in US, at federal level (because piecemeal state reform could actually be counterproductive), we may have to settle for high "thresholds" (or low magnitude, or other similar mechanisms). Still worth it! And...
@MalcolmBaalman @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @leedrutman 1/This is an important question. Both dissatisfied reform activists and complacent party insiders are motivated to exaggerate likely impact of election reform in US, to detriment of reform's chances. So...
@davidshor @laderafrutal @massivetotoro @PoliticsWolf @jacksantucci @leedrutman Why not candidate with PR?		(I can imagine reasons — party discipline has up- and down-sides. But I want to understand what yours are. Note that in PLACE, it's "candidate at low res, hi res filled in by other same-party voters", which is a compromise.)
@davidshor @laderafrutal @massivetotoro @PoliticsWolf @jacksantucci @leedrutman Totally agree on up-front predeclaration. I was asking why it's at party level, not individual candidate level.		Parties enforce discipline? Fine, just becomes your system. But if not, voters have more options.

@laderafrutal @davidshor @PoliticsWolf @jacksantucci @leedrutman Well, I hope to start with Lowell, MA. Things there couldn't get much worse...
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman (as @laderafrutal's book points out)
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman But yes, definitely worth considering. Poland 2015 is a particularly egregious example.
@davidshor @PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman Also, not hard to fix at all, as long as you don't restrict to voting methods already in use.
@MadisonDilemma @PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman Have you seen how thresholds would work in PLACE? https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP ... interesting alternative to district magnitude or party thresholds.
@jacksantucci @laderafrutal @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @leedrutman @JThPol Thanks.
@MadisonDilemma @PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal Yes... but joint lists is not the same as cross-list transfer. Inferior from party PoV; but also from that of voters, who should be in drivers' seat as to balance of seats between allied parties.
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman The formulas in Votes from Seats are impressive — combine theoretical basis and empirical fit. But there's a bit of mathematical handwaving in there too. I think that's fixable — could derive those formulas from statistical microfoundations. At least, for the simple methods.
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor @laderafrutal @jacksantucci @leedrutman Yes, that's a problem.		...but also, an opportunity. Dem party is realizing they need solutions to this problem. Voting theorists like me have answers. For now, we're still mostly voices in the wilderness, but that is starting to change.
@davidshor @laderafrutal @PoliticsWolf @jacksantucci @leedrutman "Luckily", actually-existing PR systems are not politically viable in US anyway, for other reasons. So reform activists *have* to embrace untried methods (or just settle for muni-level reform). https://t.co/8OR6VVaTZd
@laderafrutal @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman Still, more venues for peer review of this stuff would be better. I had a paper with Bruce Schneier that had gone all the way through peer review at "Voting Matters", but then that journal folded before that issue came out. :(
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman 4/That's still precinct summable at O(N²). It's a limited way to transfer — for instance, doesn't work if both votes are for same party — but it would at least greatly reduce the chance of Norway problem.
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman (Seems I can't count to 2/)	3/In modified Bavarian MMP, voters have local and list votes. Each counts for half when calculating party percentages. But, if one is for a below-threshold party, then the other vote counts for 100%, not 50% — so that's an implicit transfer.
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman 1/In PLACE, transfers would go to voter's favorite candidate's predeclared "coalition allies" — that is, individual candidates off of other parties' lists — in descending order of direct votes.
@PoliticsWolf @laderafrutal @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman 1/So, obviously, STV already does that, as we've discussed. Aside from that, it's theoretical. Two examples I know of are PLACE and modified Bavarian MMP (not actually used).
@laderafrutal @davidshor @PoliticsWolf @jacksantucci @leedrutman If you're restricting your definition of "Condorcet failure" to cases where you actually have ranked ballots, then of course PR methods don't fail. But cases like Norway, as Stephen has pointed out, are probably examples; they fail precisely because they lack rankings/transfers.
@laderafrutal @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman 2/And "no research, because no such systems [in use]" is actually a big problem. Where to publish research on theoretical voting methods? There's a few places, but not enough. So it becomes chicken &amp; egg: can't publish because not used, can't use because not peer-reviewed.
@laderafrutal @PoliticsWolf @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman 1/Australian senate is definitely in the class, because it's not "party-list with ranked-choice" but just "has implicit or explicit thresholds, and transfers sub-threshold votes". In fact, not just GVTs, but any STV, including Ireland. As for theoretical methods, there are many.
@PoliticsWolf @davidshor @jacksantucci @leedrutman Yes. This is 100% fixable. As I said earlier to @davidshor, any method that transfers votes for sub-threshold parties rather than throwing them away resolves it. That includes STV, PLACE, the modified Bavarian MMP proposed by https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb, etc, etc.
@davidshor @leedrutman If you're talking about cases like Poland 2015— that is, distortions from throwing away votes for sub-threshold parties— then voting methods which transfer such votes avoid that problem. (eg: STV, PLACE, or the modified bavarian MMP proposed by https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb)

Thanks to @PoliticsWolf and @gelliottmorris for the figures I used in this article. If you care about this issue, both of them are must-follow accounts. #FF
@PoliticsWolf Read the article I linked. As you say, it would be very hard to get congressional Dems (and impossible to get Reps) to support existing forms of #PropRep, including STV/RCV. I argue that new forms, like PLACE, might change that.		Still a long, uphill path. But no solid barriers.
@gelliottmorris Here's my article based on that graph: https://t.co/8OR6VVaTZd		Short version: the solution is #PropRep — but unfortunately, STV/RCV is a dead end.
@PoliticsWolf Yes, we need #FairMaps nationally... but the better long-term solution is #PropRep. https://t.co/8OR6VVaTZd
I just published “Gerrymandering is fixable. But not how you think.” https://t.co/SVCYvyklbt
@PoliticsWolf Even if every state had nonpartisan redistricting, the odds of a popular vote/House control split favoring republicans aren't zero. Demographic clustering and random factors together would make it about a 10% chance in current conditions. Takes #PropRep to really solve problem.
I just published “‘Ranked Choice Voting’? I support it, but…” https://t.co/j9hM4e80zg
@FairvoteVan It's reasonable to be a bit miffed at the slow timing. But "Some A Bit Miffed" isn't a viable headline. So the media dresses it up in speculation and guilt-by-association until there's enough there to print.
@DanielMagleby @bshor @mungowitz Most important, in your view. Your tests for bias are encouraging but weak, so just as it would be reasonable to prefer your algo for speed, it would be reasonable to reject it for possible bias.

@chadskelton @jjhorgan 6/But that's precisely why the "no hurry" attitude is most infuriating to me. To run a good citizens' assembly before next election, they need to be laying the groundwork now, not try a cold start after the referendum.

@chadskelton @jjhorgan 4/They also suggest that the question should ensure that any new system would:	-be proportional	-have all seats attached to a riding or region	-allocate seats within-party based on voters (eg, "open list"), not party insiders ("closed list").

@chadskelton @jjhorgan 3/Also, if you actually read the proposal, it suggests that the referendum should specify a clearly-defined mechanism for settling on a #PropRep method. So it's only a "blank check" insofar as that mechanism is subject to manipulation.
@chadskelton 2/This is a caucus proposal dated Feb 28. The only reason it's news again now is @jjhorgan's ridiculous "nobody talks #PropRep at a barbecue" comments. So, probably shouldn't read too much into it.
@chadskelton 1/I totally agree with you here: it's pathetic that here we are in May and the government's attitude is still just "chill out, there's plenty of time". But let me play devil's advocate for a moment.
@fairvoteKam 2/That's still healthy. But of course that doesn't stop anti-#PropRep lobbyists from fearmongering about Israel or whatever. No conceivable proposal would turn BC into Israel.
@fairvoteKam 1/Many #PR4BC proposals (the most-likely ones IMO) are based on regions of around 12 seats. That means a natural threshold of 8%, which is a bit above the international average. So BC would probably end up with a bit fewer parties than, say, Germany: maybe go from 3 to 5.

@TheoLandsman @PoliticsWolf @ElectProject Fair enough.
@TheoLandsman @PoliticsWolf @ElectProject I know I'm beating this drum hard in this thread here, and I risk looking like a crackpot. But this isn't just pie-in-the-sky. I've helped put the #PropRep pie in the oven in #PR4BC (see https://t.co/Y4hbazlQLb), and I'm working on repeating that in Lowell, MA.
@TheoLandsman @PoliticsWolf @ElectProject But redistricting? Should be a trivial detail, if we had proportional representation.
@TheoLandsman @PoliticsWolf @ElectProject Sortition and a supermajority should be the basis of commissions for a lot more things. Citizen juries / deliberative polls / citizens' assemblies are awesome.
@PoliticsWolf @jennifernvictor - Competitive districts	- Partisan fairness	- First past the post		Choose 2 out of 3. 		And if you choose the first 2, but #endFPTP and move to #PropRep, you can get extras:		-Local reps	-gender and ethnic representation	-simple ballots	-better turnout	-less partisan spite	Etc.
@davedaley3 @PoliticsWolf @ElectProject Even taking the (valid) criticisms into account, this finding is a powerful argument for #PropRep rather than independent redistricting.		It's easy to cynically dismiss as too hard. But Dem platform right now is open to lots of "impossible" ideas. Time to discuss!
@repwomen @JohnHolbein1 @The_JOP @hamelpolisci @jahenderson0 Yes! #PropotionalRepresentation solves much more than idependent redistricting does.		But... RCV is not the only way to do #PropRep. Other methods have same advantages, fewer downsides. Better to keep advocacy general for now.
Yes, this has been disappointing. @Dave_Eby's job should not be *appearing* neutral but *being* transparent and quick. Neutrality should be ensured by @ElectionsBC writing ballot language, not by hiding &amp; slowing process of choosing options. https://t.co/QSNXnzbB4z

@fairvotebc That's a great quote.		US-style gerrymandering weaponises lack-of-representation, but FPTP is what allows it in the first place. Even without gerrymandering, it's bad: leads to polarization, destructive zero-sum politics, etc. #EndGerrymandering #EndFPTP #PropRep

@PoliticsWolf Very interesting.		So, do you still support #YesOnIssue1?		(Either way, this is another example where #PropRep is a better way to #EndGerrymandering than #FairMaps. Any map is a tradeoff between valid interests, and most are made by untrustworthy authorities.)
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 11/thread.		PLACE voting links:	https://t.co/QBjFDCe2VP	https://t.co/vfzE8ci82J	https://t.co/WW7fGlDQLx	https://t.co/x7zIEu80Nn
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 10/The final wild-card (independent or minor party) slot would go to whichever candidate got the most signatures. So, always room for some new blood, but not easy to get on ballot as a pure dummy candidate.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 9/So dummy candidates only work for a Y who's already legitimately reasonably popular.		Second, ballot access. I'd advise limiting to 1 of each serious party plus 1 independent or minor party candidate per district, where "serious party"= "finished over 5% &amp; in top 4 last time".
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 8/First, PLACE has a rule that no candidate can have exactly 1 faction ally or exactly 1 coalition ally. So if X was a dummy for Y, they'd have to include some Z as another ally. Then if Z gets more direct votes than Y, the votes pass to Z first.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 7/As to dummy candidates (those who exist only to pass their votes to a specific target): again, it's a valid issue, but I'd argue a relatively minor one. A couple things stop it from being worse:
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 6/And if instead I choose a woman Z, and she loses, my vote might end up counting for a man.		So overall, PLACE is a lot better for women than FPTP or open list, but maybe not quite as good as STV.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 5/So in practice, if I want to elect a woman from party X, there will probably be a Y who's running as the feminist candidate, who endorses the other party X women as faction allies. Maybe I like one of the other women a bit better, but if feminism is my issue, I'll choose Y.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 4/Also, if what I really care about is B-ness, I can if I want to find the candidate whose predeclared allies are the B-est. Since I have the broadest possible choice of candidates ("statewide", not limited by multimember districts), chances are I can find somebody good.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 3/...even if it's imperfect, PLACE is better than nothing. Even if my ABC favorite passes my delegated vote to a mix of As, Bs, and Cs, and I only liked them because of B... I still have a 1/3 chance of my vote retaining its B-ness. That's a lot better than FPTP or party list.&amp;…
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 2/For women, it's kinda the same problem as intersectionality. If my favorite is the person in categories A, B, and C, and they don't win, do I want my vote to go to other A's, other B's, or other C's? Or combinations: other ABs, BCs, or ACs? I acknowledge that's an issue. But...
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 1/So, you are suggesting 2 problems with PLACE: effects on women, and dummy/funnel candidates. I'll respond one at a time.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman (minor point: I know it's sarcastic, but "in their place" is probably best avoided.)
@ClayShentrup @nealmcb @DwightShellman @US_Vote @philipbstark @AmberMcReynolds Did you read the link? I grant that the logic isn't bulletproof, but you seem not to be even engaging with the fact it exists.
@ClayShentrup @nealmcb @DwightShellman @US_Vote @philipbstark @AmberMcReynolds Not faith. Logic: https://t.co/oN29s58Rgk
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 4/So as a voter, I want more choices, so that there's a better chance of getting a better representative... but only as long as the ballot is manageable. PLACE is sweet spot: max choices, min hassle.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 3/But my bigger point is that STV doesn't scale. In practice, choosing a favorite out of 20 is less than twice as hard as out of 10, but ranking (enough out of) 20 is mor than twice as hard as out of 10.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 2/My (first) point is that the idea of ranking is simple but the practice not so much. Was I sure that #7 was better than #8? Of course not.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman 1/I live in Cambridge, MA, which uses STV for a 9-seat election. Last time there were 26 candidates. IIRC, my vote got used up at my 7th pref, after passing 2 candidates who'd been elected before my vote got there. If I'd done just 1-6, woulda been wasted.
@ClayShentrup @nealmcb @DwightShellman @US_Vote @philipbstark @AmberMcReynolds 2/By all means, use a good single-winner voting method within the legislature, when it comes to making decisions.		But separate single-member elections only needlessly shut entire groups out of the room.
@ClayShentrup @nealmcb @DwightShellman @US_Vote @philipbstark @AmberMcReynolds 1/That's true, because the best of both are relatively recent inventions with little empirical data.		But for a legislature, "represent every voter" (#PropRep) is obviously better than "represent some".

@BillTieleman Italian voters are mostly split into 3 roughly equal groups and each one hates the other 2. A voting system that reflects that reality is healthy in that case. Giving 100% of the power to one of those three groups would be an undemocratic disaster.
@ClayShentrup @OccamSaber @AdrienGazouille @wickedcellist @NPR 2/More generally, I'm talking nuance. I wouldn't be so insistent if you hadn't conflated nuance &amp; "ignorance".

@ClayShentrup @OccamSaber @AdrienGazouille @wickedcellist @NPR 1/Imagining 1-sided strategy causes more strategy on both sides.

@ClayShentrup @OccamSaber @AdrienGazouille @wickedcellist @NPR One-sided strategy doesn't have to be realistic to be important. If voters strategize by imagining one-sided strategy, then score voting's poor susceptibility to it affects outcomes. That's why 3-2-1 or STAR are better: encourage more honesty and thus better outcomes.
@GeoffreyHPowell @TimRothIRV @MalcolmBaalman Sweet spot is PLACE: gives voters simpler ballots, broader choice, and more collective bargaining power than STV. Combines advantages of single-member districts (guaranteed geographic representation, single chain of accountability) with those of at-large (broadest choice).
@ClayShentrup @OccamSaber @AdrienGazouille @wickedcellist @NPR Not true. In Warren's sims, with high enough strategic voting, approval and score tie — because they're the same.

@leedrutman Polarization and gerrymandering are two heads of same hydra: unrepresented voters. Keep fighting heads, or stab the heart with #PropRep.		Best option, PLACE voting: some autonomy to factions within big-tent parties, so divorce not needed. Thus, nondisruptive, politically viable.
@PoliticsWolf 1/Yes to all of that.		On "end gerrymandering" from US Congress: feds writing rules for state redistricting process is dicey. Better to impose a #PropRep voting method on gerrymandered states (where partisan process created high efficiency gap). w/ PLACE voting, same districts.
@kfk222 @Dave_Eby @BillTieleman Certainly, no blank checks. But with a clear, non-politician-led process for settling future details, and clear tests any system must pass (proportional, no closed lists, and supported by a supermajority of citizens on the committee), then I think leaving details open is OK.

@Dave_Eby @BillTieleman 12//12 Like:		“Should British Columbia choose and adopt a system of open proportional representation, through a process involving ordinary citizens of all parts of the province and political persuasions? ‘Open’ means the system should not involve closed regional party lists."
@Dave_Eby @BillTieleman 11/OK, enough criticism. Moving forward, what can be done? If a question will be announced with a very short time to campaign, it’s important to keep it simple and clear. So, one question, on a mandate for reform, with some clear goals as to what the resulting reform should be.
@Dave_Eby @BillTieleman 10/it’s not a good process. It shouldn’t be one person’s job both to choose the best option to vote on and also to be neutral about which option is best. That doesn’t work, and it is I think part of what has led to this delay in deciding what the question will be.
@Dave_Eby 9/@BillTieleman and the “No #PR4BC” crowd have been criticizing that double-responsibility for @Dave_Eby as leading to an unfair bias in favor of the referendum. In my view, Eby has been bending over backwards to be neutral, and hurting the chances of passing. Either way…
8/@Dave_Eby has been put in an impossible position in between yes and neutral. He has to design the proposal itself — a job that properly belongs to supporters, and his party officially supports it. But he’s also in charge of designing referendum process, which should be neutral.
7/Basically, a healthy referendum requires leadership on all three sides: yes, neutral, and no. The yes side should propose an idea; the neutral side should design a fair process for debating and voting on that idea; and the no side should be free to campaign against. But in BC…
6/In my mind, that dismissive attitude is an insult to anybody who cares about #PR4BC on either side. Voting isn’t a boring detail for nerds; it’s the way society decides many important questions. Whether you support or oppose reform, the province deserves time to decide.
5/In February, our best guess was that the structure of the referendum would be announced some time this month. But now, premier John Horgan is pooh-poohing the need for that. Summer vacation! Barbecues! No need for boring planning.
@Dave_Eby 4/When I saw that announcement, I of course flashed back to the nationwide ERRE / https://t.co/YHG1twPrFs process, which is where Trudeau sent his voting reform promise to die. So I helped organize the BC PR symposium in February, which submitted public comments on the process.
3/So the governing coalition formed during last summer; then in fall they announced that there would be a referendum before the end of next November, with details to be worked out by attorney general @Dave_Eby, partly through a HowWeVote online consultation that ended in Feb.
2/The quick story so far: the provincial election was about a year ago. That resulted in a coalition of NDP and BC Greens with a narrow majority in seats and a larger one in votes; thus, one of the major points of agreement was #PropRep.
1/Here’s a quick thread on #PR4BC (current status on the BC PR referendum). Inspired by this article: https://t.co/XCZam5lEl0

@jacksantucci "Does ballot complexity matter? Well... it's complicated."
@davidmfaris Replace RCV with #PropRep or "voting reform". RCV is weak tea as a reform.
@jacksantucci Rating isn't quite as bad as ranking. You don't have to make fine distinctions at every level, you can just rate as equal. But yes, it's still a similar problem.
RT @mcpli: Texas redistricting arguments now wrapped up at SCOTUS.  #fairmaps #txlege 1/
11/PS. I know that people like @FairVote, @Rob_Richie, &amp; @RepDonBeyer are getting some traction with #FairRepAct. And good for them! But neither major party will ever allow STV nationally. Not so for PLACE; it's not only better, but also more viable with incumbents.
10/Conclusion: Want to solve gerrymandering, AND clustering, AND safe seats, AND ignored minorities? You need #PropRep; &amp; in the USA, you need it at the federal level (as with VRA: a fed law that only kicks in for gerrymandered states). STV at fed level is dead letter. So, PLACE.
9/So, delegated preferences in PLACE aren't just a necessary compromise for simpler ballots. They're actually a positive good: allowing more breadth of choice, and sharpening the bargaining power of minority voting blocs, all without (Israel-style) 1-issue party splintering.
8/(Here in Cambridge, the most politically-engaged person I know enjoys fully ranking the over 2-dozen candidates in strict order. Does he even realize that all but 1 of those rankings will have no effect on the outcome? I honestly can't tell.)
7/And while most of the extra power you get from a ranked ballot is an illusion (after all, your vote basically ends up helping elect just one candidate), the power you give up for ranking is very real. Can't vote for true out-of-district favorite, dilutes bargaining power.
6/It just isn't reasonable to expect every voter to have ranked preferences over 10s of candidates for multiple offices (fed, state, local). It's not that the idea of ranking is hard, but actually evaluating every candidate actually is.
5/Ranking is appealing to activists, and as @jacksantucci has documented, has been the major reform proposal for over 100 years now. But in a sense, it goes against the ideas of a representative republic, of delegating authority/leadership/bargaining power.
4/#PropRep is a way to make sure almost every voter is represented. To accomplish this, there must be some way to get beyond voters' first preferences. The basic options here are ranking, delegation, pooling, (or some hybrid of those three).
3/(Instead of calling this "wasted votes", we should say "unrepresented voters". Philosophically, fruitless effort isn't wasted. I guess maybe @laderafrutal would suggest "fruitless votes". As a single word, I'm not sure though; "misrepresentation"?)
2/Representative democracy is a two-step process: people elect reps, reps make laws. If you lose at step 1, you are being shut out of "the room where it happens". That is avoidable! A good #PropRep method can mean &gt;&gt;90% of voters are winners at step 1.

@MalcolmBaalman @FairDistrictsPA @fairvote @OhFairDistricts @jacksantucci @gelliottmorris The #FairRepAct is great, yes.

@StewartPrest Agreed with all of your points.		Even better option might be something like PLACE voting, where voters are free to vote at large, and each vote transfers in ways shaped by both the chosen candidate and same-party voters, but there are still some partisan guarantees for clarity.
@SusanBlack @BillTieleman Not so straightforward, because she's leaning on "fear, uncertainty, and doubt". When the actual content of the referendum is announced (probably next month), I expect it will be easy to respond to her concerns.

@mcimaps Needs moar #PropRep.
@jacksantucci @ClayShentrup @MalcolmBaalman Burr dilemma (I'd call it "chicken dilemma", to broaden the scope a bit) is real. Methods like STAR or 3-2-1 minimize it.		But the worst case for approval is still better than FPTP. Burr/chicken can cause 3-cand failures, but candidates 4-99 still don't break things, unlike FPTP.
@progressnerd @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci The "propaganda" is in the rounding error when you reduce it to tweet form (or equivalent).		And as for your theory/practice smear... I value evidence from actual elections as much as you. Eg, final Dartmouth approval election, average 1.8 approvals/ballot.		Let's stop bickering.
@progressnerd @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci I don't want to hit back with critiques of your favored system that would probably be equally invalid in shoehorned tweet form. So can we not do this, at least not here? Malcolm and Greg, you both have my email, first name, period, last name on google's platform.
@progressnerd @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci At-large bloc voting has a free-riding incentive that 1-winner elections don't; in fact, 1-winner has the opposite, a compromise (Condorcet) incentive.		Big picture: your critiques are probably partly valid. But not when you shoehorn them into a tweet ("approval-&gt;FPTP").
@ShaunKing Seems to me the substance is: "Dem party elites aren't listening to voters". Short term solution is, get louder. But you also need a long term solution, because not all of us have Bernie's stamina for yelling. And that means voter-centric election reform. #PropRep #ApprovalVoting
@BrendanNyhan Worst case, we just declare bombruptcy.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @ElectionScience I apologize for thinking I could read minds. Bad form.		To mine, the "approval would devolve to plurality" thing is a clear fallacy, and not one that even seems very attractive. Easier to imagine it started once than always independently reinvented. But I shouldn't assume, sorry.
@MalcolmBaalman @ClayShentrup @jacksantucci Sure, independent centrist winners would be rare (though they'd exist). But partisan or not, all winners would be more accountable, and all voters would have more power.		You want to focus on #PropRep? Great, I'd agree! But don't bad-mouth other synergistic reforms.
@MalcolmBaalman @ClayShentrup @jacksantucci When top-2 status is no longer a self-fulfilling prophecy, but instead based on actual popularity, Ds and Rs would have stronger incentives against extreme polarization.
@MalcolmBaalman @ClayShentrup @jacksantucci I never claimed it would.		In approval voting, there would still be a largest and a 2nd-largest party. That's how finite numbers work. Voters who honestly prefer 1 of those 2 would still bullet vote.		But unlike FPTP, corrupt incumbents would soon find they're not in those top 2.
@MalcolmBaalman @ClayShentrup @jacksantucci There's a huge difference between saying "most voters would strategically bullet vote in most elections" and "all would in all".		If it's just "most", parties are still held accountable; ignore voters, and some 3rd party will soon supplant you as "major". Unlike in FPTP!
@MalcolmBaalman @ClayShentrup @jacksantucci "&gt;90% 🇺🇸 voters vote 2-party now"≠"&gt;90% are honestly satisfied with 2-party voting". Again, see graph below. Some of 61% who want a 3rd party wouldn't be satisfied w/ real options, but that means ~50% 2-party partisans, not ~90%.		That much bullet voting is healthy. https://t.co/0i1WfOmfAA
@LemieuxLGM (I assume you can tell which LGM regular I am, because that's a crucial part of the "joke".)
@LemieuxLGM Ranked? You're just asking for Arrow's Theorem, aren't you. You should give them normalized ratings, so we can see the relative size of the gaps.
@GeoffreyHPowell @MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci Sure... in theory.		But this thread started on approval voting, something I expect to see in practice (Fargo? Olympia?) within the next few years.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci Note that for an alternate universe 2016, I'd count Sanders or Cruz as inside one of two major parties; and people like Bloomberg, Stein, Johnson aren't near the median.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci Huh?		If a "major party" is the honest Condorcet winner — likely to be the case for at least the first few elections under any reformed voting method — then 60-80% bullet votes could well be the healthiest possible approval outcome. How is that "damaged"? (Not a rhetorical ?)
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci @ElectionScience Yes. And you began this thread with a criticism of approval voting which I'm arguing is flatly false. That is counter to those goals.		Again, approval isn't perfect, and shouldn't be shielded from valid critiques. But it makes sense to defend it from invalid ones.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci And yes, each of those inequalities is well-grounded in evidence and game theory.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci So, for single-winner elections, what's the best method? As you say, it should encourage positive support and alliances, while avoiding pernicious equilibria. On those criteria, plurality &lt;&lt;&lt; IRV &lt;&lt; approval &lt;&lt; STAR &lt; 3-2-1.		https://t.co/kHHc7C4ZBZ	https://t.co/qZkmmF7JJl
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci This is something we can agree on: for those elections where it's possible, #PropRep solves problems that no single-winner method can.		But single-winner discussions are still important, because presidents, governors, and mayors exist.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci In fact, if you believe this graph, 3rd parties collectively could be getting ~60% of the vote. I'd discount that substantially, but it's still a lot. Certainly, striking distance to capitalize on any big missteps by a "major" party. Not at all close to "collapsing to plurality". https://t.co/M0BzaADJnb
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci Yes, as long as there are clearly 2 dominant parties (which would certainly be true in "foreseeable future" aka first few elections), rational strategy for partisans of either party is bullet voting. But the natural number there is more like 70%, not &gt;&gt;90%.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci ...let's state our arguments carefully.		It seems to me that you're saying that in approval, major party voters would bullet vote, and since that's &gt;&gt;90% now, that means &gt;&gt;90% bullet voters. You're not actually arguing everyone would, just everyone who matters.		I'd reply:
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci Borda said that in an argument with Condorcet.		As I pointed out, if there's a known Condorcet winner, approval's strong Nash equilibrium has them win easily.		Yes, approval has flaws. Yes, *all* voting methods are subject to strategy (by Gibbard-Satterthwaite). But please...
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 6/Now, I too have a dog in this race. I'm on @ElectionScience board, which supports approval voting. So add any grains of salt appropriate here.		But I'm not arguing that approval is perfect. Just that this "strategy" criticism makes no sense. #TimeForSomeGameTheory, indeed.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 5/AFAICT, the only reason people believe that "approval would collapse to plurality because of strategic bullet voting" is propaganda from ... um... a voting reform nonprofit with a clear dog in the race. 		(Not gonna name names, but I think you know what I mean.)
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 4/And I'd argue yes, there would be irrationality, but *none of the evidence* suggests that it would be in the form of 100% bullet voting.		Approval-style exit polls, actual strategic voting behavior under plurality, prospect theory... it all points to &gt;1 average votes/ballot.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 3/Does it sound implausible that Republican party would encourage approving the Democrat? Sure, that's a fair critique. But now you're no longer talking about rational strategies, but your guess about how human irrationality would play out.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 2/That same strategy applies to smaller of two non-centrist parties in a center-squeeze scenario. For instance, in Burlington 2009, the Republican party would rationally have encouraged (some substantial fraction of) their voters to approve the Democrat.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci 1/That just isn't true.		Small 3rd parties would* encourage voters "vote for me and for lesser evil".		*if short-term rationally strategic, which are silly assumptions but also the implicit ground for any discussion like this, including your assertion.

@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci There are legit criticisms of approval voting. But "easy to game" isn't one of them.		For instance, it is not expressive enough for many voters (eg, those who want to vote favorite&gt;compromise&gt;enemy). So other methods (eg, 321 or STAR) have their place. Approval still 1st step.
@jacksantucci Not that "party-based" is a goal in and of itself. The (limited) formal role of parties in PLACE is just a means to various ends: simple ballots, summability, and broader voter choice.		Still, gif is appropriate. Voting theory has a few real dilemmas, but even more false ones.
@MalcolmBaalman @jacksantucci If a Condorcet winner exists, they're the unique strong Nash equilibrium. That means "impossible to game" if voters are reasonably rational and well-informed. Those assumptions are of course violated, but not by enough to cover the gap from "impossible" to "easy".

@PoliticsWolf It's not symmetric. But "both sides" is still an important point in one regard: there are Republican voters as well as Dem ones being disenfranchised by gerrymandering. Moderates in both parties suffer when districts are drawn ultra-safe, especially if they're in enemy territory.

@laderafrutal @jacksantucci Later-no-harm. Ie, lower ranks on a given ballot never compete with higher ranks there. IRV, STV, and plurality are about the only sane methods that pass this criterion, so in practice it ends up being clever shorthand for "RCV".
@jacksantucci @voterchoiceMA @progressnerd @laderafrutal Technically, it's TBD of some LNH method. In practice, that means STV (two 5-seat districts and 3 at-large seats.)

@progressnerd @voterchoiceMA @ElectionScience @fairvote Sorry for getting into wonky old debates; this probably isn't the time (congratulations!) or place (280 chars, public) for them. But I think that you and I should talk. I promise, it'd be productive and concrete, not just old dead ends.
@progressnerd @voterchoiceMA @ElectionScience @fairvote But to @progressnerd, I've read those old (ca 2006) articles on your website about how you think IRV &gt; approval, and I think those were reasonable arguments at the time but the state of the art has moved on since then.
@progressnerd @voterchoiceMA This is still a big reason to celebrate, for @ElectionScience as well as for @Fairvote and @voterchoiceMA. I do NOT want to minimize that.
@progressnerd @voterchoiceMA Right, I understand that "RCV" is now a term of art meaning "STV or IRV" and not just "any voting method with ranked choices". As you know, I think that IRV is not too much better than plurality, and though STV is much better, other multiwinner methods are even better.
@voterchoiceMA 9/"A voting method shall be considered 'better than plurality' if the voter ranks, rates, or approves of candidates as individuals; the ballot can be cast in such a way that it favors multiple candidates; and each ballot has the same voting power."
@voterchoiceMA 8/How would I have worded it, to ensure a voting method that's at least better than plurality? Ie, I'm looking for a definition that would include IRV, STV, approval, 3-2-1, PLACE, etc., etc., but not plurality.
@voterchoiceMA 7/In the short term, this means a risk of electing more-extreme winners. In the longer term, as voters strategize to avoid that, it can mean a return to unaccountable two-party dominance.
@voterchoiceMA 6/If you're not allowed to look at lower ratings until higher ones have been definitely eliminated, there's no way to find a beats-all winner. Good compromise candidates get prematurely eliminated.
@voterchoiceMA 5/Now I'm not claiming that there's any risk that this definition will be interpreted in practice to mean plurality. But it does go to show that this "later no harm" idea doesn't necessarily mean anything good. I'd argue it means something bad!
@voterchoiceMA 4/Notice that they were so busy making sure their definition didn't include Condorcet that they didn't notice that, technically speaking, it actually includes plurality, as long as you give room on the ballot for meaningless 2nd ranks.
@voterchoiceMA 3/So, props for that. And before I go on and say anything critical, HUGE PROPS for getting this passed; great job! But...
@voterchoiceMA 2/This is a pretty clever way to define "RCV" in few words to include IRV and STV but not things like Condorcet or traditional Bucklin.
@voterchoiceMA 1/"A voting method shall be considered ranked-choice voting if the voter ranks candidates in order of preference and a voter's lower ranked choice does not impact the likelihood of a higher ranked choice being elected." ... interesting.

@SSRCanxieties @smotus @PacificStand Now, ending the two party duopoly doesn't mean that the two major parties won't still be the two major parties. They'll just have to stay accountable to voters to remain that way, rather than coasting on their unfair strategic advantages.
@SSRCanxieties @smotus @PacificStand 2 shorter takes:		1. Voting method reform is the best way to fix the two party duopoly (and gerrymandering).		2. Parties have a legitimate role, but only if they depend on legitimate support, not on strategic voting.		Simple &amp; obvious. Change is "impossible" only until it's not.

@Redistrict That makes the problem more solvable, not less urgent. Federal statute could mandate these states either fix their own gerrymandering problem or use #PropRep. Wouldn't even require mew districts or macines.		Should be a slam dunk as soon as Dems have trifecta of power.
@puckthecat1 @Redistrict (I mean, you're right that having this debate without mentioning #PropRep makes it just pettifoggery, but it doesn't have to be that way.)
@puckthecat1 @Redistrict It's relevant to solutions. If what's different is that sorting is getting worse, even good-faith maps are growing more likely to fail. That's an argument for #PropRep over #FairMaps as the best path to solve the problem.
@BrennanCenter @mcpli We need to #EndGerrymandering. There are 2 ways to do that: #FairMaps is good, and #PropRep is better.
@DemAwakening We need to #EndGerrymandering. There are 2 ways to do that: #FairMaps is good, and #PropRep is better.
@mcpli 2/2: And #PropRep can be done by federal law, using a method like PLACE voting that doesn't change districts or machines. In fact, it's *less* disruptive to incumbents than redistricting, which makes it potentially *more* politically viable.
@mcpli 1/2: If gerrymandering is the art of creating artificial plateaus in those graphs, then #PropRep is guaranteeing a diagonal line. Just as ethnic representation -&gt; partisan responsiveness, it goes vice versa too, so #PropRep is good for representation.
@tomhawthorn You left out the support of an environmental party with 6%. In other words, majority rules. Scary.

@JamesOfsink @FLIEReform @Sightline Yes. And here’s why:		Fair #PropRep voting methods can #MakeEveryVoteMatter. For instance, in PLACE or STV, if your candidate definitely has not enough votes to win/more than enough, your vote transfers. That evens out votes so most winners get 100% of a district, not just 50%.

@PoliticsWolf This is doable in the US! British Columbia will have a #PR4BC referendum later this year which I think will pass. #PropRep methods which fix the unfair effects of gerrymandering without disrupting existing districts also exist, so legitimately popular incumbents could support.
@PoliticsWolf That way, by the time all the transfers are done, most winners would have 100% of a district worth of votes, and the last few winners would have &gt;50%. Ie, &gt;90% of voters nationwide would be truly represented.		Many other benefits: more voter choice, less polarization, etc.
@PoliticsWolf What is #PropRep? Some describe it by its outcome: % of seats should = % of votes, as closely as possible. But I think that it’s better to focus on *how* it gets that result: #MakeEveryVoteCount. Ie: if a ballot wouldn’t be represented in its district, transfer it to another.
@PoliticsWolf There’s no one-size-fits-all #fairmaps bill, and certainly not one that would pass constitutional muster for Congress to impose on state legislatures. But gerrymandering *is* a 14a = protection issue, so Congress does have authority to fix it.		Answer: #PropRep, w/same districts.
@PoliticsWolf We need a national anti-gerrymandering strategy, not just a bunch of detail-heavy state-by-state fights on unfriendly territory.		That means, a plank that the Democratic party can embrace, that would fix gerrymandering for both Congress and state leg, in every state.

@laderafrutal That's not how "en blanco" works. That's not how any of this works.
@Nedfoley (I do thank you for engaging, though. I'm an activist, not a lawyer, and even just seeing which objections you raise is interesting, even if so far I still think they don't apply.)
@Nedfoley (I hope you think my proposal is interesting, but if not, that's fine. The situation here is that I asked a question, you said "that's the wrong question", and now I'm just explaining why I asked it. No offense taken, I get why you did it, but I really just want an answer.)
@Nedfoley That's why the congressional fix I envision would leave existing districts, but impose a proportional representation method. (#PropRep; Actually, biproportional, so that it guaranteed one winner per district as well as partisan and factional proportionality. ie, PLACE voting.)
@GeoffreyHPowell Also, if "simplicity" is measured only by ballot instructions, PLACE is even simpler than STV.		(More advantages: summability; avoids some center squeeze scenarios; etc.)
@GeoffreyHPowell PLACE has much bigger advantages over STV than just non-disruptiveness. It also enables broader choice (not limited to 5-member districts or whatever); stronger voice for sub-quota minorities (channeling their vote through a spokesperson=unity=strength), and more.

@Nedfoley Gerrymandering needs fixing for state legislatures too, and Congress is probably friendlier territory for that than gerremandered states.
10/10	And that's it. I've just explained PLACE voting in under 350 words. And even though it is a fully proportional method (#PropRep), I didn't have to use any technical jargon like "Hare quota" or "D'Hondt divisor".
9/10	How does PLACE define "similar"? Using each candidate's predeclared endorsements. Votes first transfer to same-party cands predesignated as "faction allies", then to other same-party cands, then to other-party cands predesignated as "coalition allies".
8/10	In practice, reasons 2 and 3 will happen a bunch of times before you're done (down to 1 winner per district.) So votes will transfer from weaker candidates to the stronger ones who are most "similar".
7/10	"Eliminated candidates": happens for three reasons. 1: Candidate gets &lt; 25% of local votes, or &lt; half the local votes of some other local candidate. 2: Some other cand in the same district gets a full average district worth of votes. 3: Candidate is farthest from winning.
6/10	"Extra votes" means that one candidate has more than an average district worth of votes. If every winner got this many, that would mean 100% of voters "win". In reality, this won't happen for all seats, but will for most.
5/10	So how does PLACE #MakeEveryVoteMatter (if possible; ③)? By transferring the wasted ones: extra votes beyond what's needed to guarantee a win, or votes for eliminated candidates.
4/10	But most voters just want to choose the local candidate from their party, so PLACE ballot stays simple and keeps that option just as easy as under FPTP. Out-of-district votes are write-ins using party and district #.
3/10	Maximum voter options (②) means letting people vote for any candidate in any district. Letting voters get excited about somebody from far away, whether because of issues, gender, race, or age, will help boost turnout.
2/10	"Don't fix what ain't broke" (①) refers to the idea of single-winner districts. Some argue representation should have no geographic aspect, but keeping districts is sensible. Less disruptive to incumbents, helps simplify ballots, etc.
1/10		I have a new, simpler, pitch for PLACE voting. Based on 3 principles:		① Don't fix what ain't broke.		② Give voters maximum options (but don't overwhelm them).		③ Every vote should matter, if possible.
@laderafrutal I think that's a lot of weight to put on "unfiltered". For instance, an open list system is only "filtered" if parties choose ballot order, and arguably not even then.		Basically, should look for ways a suggestion could possibly make sense before saying "just, no".
@laderafrutal Sounds to me like one idea that's probably good (though details matter) and one that's horrible. And open list PR isn't exactly an "idea from the US".		Are you just assuming that because it's Brookings they mean it in the worst possible way?
@Nedfoley In other words, if the court says "there's no equal protection issue we can address here", will they likely bother to say it in a way that still allows Congress to legislate on 14a grounds?
@Nedfoley Yet another q: if SCOTUS doesn't address gerrymandering in a certain context (say, 14a), does that necessarily close the door to use that context in future legislation (a la Fair Representation Act)?
@PoliticsWolf Instant runoff helps this problem, but other solutions are even better. IRV can still prematurely squeeze out (relative) centrists, as in Burlington 2009; STAR voting or 321 voting avoid this.

@RepDonBeyer @Rob_Richie @fairvote With 30 options, chances are high that one of them has all the best of the 15 nearby candidates as allies. In other words, breadth of options beats depth; same or better effectiveness, with less work for the voter.
@RepDonBeyer @Rob_Richie @fairvote Which choice would you rather face as a voter in a 10-district state:		“Rank these 15 candidates” (and your vote will count for one of them)		“Choose one of these 30 candidates” (and your vote will count for them or somebody similar)
@RepDonBeyer @Rob_Richie @fairvote Also, simplicity for voters is key. I know that ranking isn’t actually too hard for voters, but even so, simpler ballots (and precinct summability) means fewer voters (and election admins) falling for the scaremongering.
@RepDonBeyer @Rob_Richie and @FairVote, I know we don’t agree about single-winner methods, but I hope you’ll take a serious look at this. We need a proposal that can actually pass, and that means something non-disruptive for incumbents.

@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra We’re getting pretty far into the weeds and should probably move to DM if you want to continue.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra The upshot is that you can’t really separate your partisan support from your individual support for a candidate. In other words, if you don’t like your party’s local candidate, you’re out of luck.		No worse than FPTP, but certainly something like PLACE does better in this sense.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra So, why is DMP not great for voter choice? Because you can only vote within your district; essentially, 1 option/party plus maybe an independent or two. That contrasts with STV (~5 options/party), open MMP (~20 options/party on regional ballot), or PLACE (&gt;50 options/party).
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra STV and MMP are both much, much better than FPTP on the whole, but unlike DMP have ways in which they are notably worse.		This “no real downsides” aspect of DMP makes it a strong first-step reform proposal.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra I don’t want to be criticizing it without first talking about its strengths. So let me be clear that “essentially strictly better than FPTP” is a high bar it passes, that things like STV (complex ballots and non-summable counting), closed-list MMP (party-centric) don’t.
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra Why do you ask?
@LibArtsNdCrafts @sean_gra Yes, and I’ve met Sean. I think that DMP has some great features (good proportionality, simple ballot, good locality). 		It’s not the best at voter choice or avoiding safe seats, but it’s certainly better than FPTP in every single way that matters.

@laurelrusswurm @VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan Understood. My original point here is that MMP versions for BC are regional and thus have natural threshold &gt;5%, no need for artificial. So STV doesn't stand out in that sense.

@laurelrusswurm @VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan Personally, I sometimes mention PLACE, a new proposal that I think deserves more attention. 		But for #PR4BC, it's clear top options are: regional MMP, DMP, STV, LPR, and FDPR (aka RUPR). All but DMP have purely natural thresholds (and DMP has individual, not party, thresholds)
@laurelrusswurm @VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan Forms recommended for #CDNpoli/#BCpoli such as by over a dozen top experts here? https://t.co/2lOkuXJ3QF		They recommend, among others, regional forms of MMP and FDPR with natural thresholds.
@laurelrusswurm @VaughnPalmer @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan Many PR methods, not just STV, have natural thresholds. Regional list, FDPR, etc.

@DevonRowcliffe @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan FPTP does not avoid any problems of fringe voters, it just keeps the rot in the dark... until the house collapses.		Any connection to current headlines is purely (in)fortuitous.
@DevonRowcliffe @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @StrategicThghts @markgreenan General point: say there's a fringe party with 5%, and nearest major party needs those votes to win.		Under FPTP, they must pander from the start; subtly twist their core platform to appeal to fringe.		Under #PropRep, they negotiate after the election, with all eyes on them.
@jdouglaslittle @BillTieleman @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan Doug, don't let Bill lead you around by the nose.

Under FPTP, the way to win is to hope to get lucky and face a split opposition.
@ATabarrok Oxygen is a gateway drug!
@BillTieleman @DevonRowcliffe @jdouglaslittle @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan If PR really did cause such problems, there would be movements in PR countries to switch to FPTP. There aren't.		Every FPTP country has a movement to switch to PR. And those movements include a broad political spectrum, but not authoritarians, which means no hard right.
If some energetic 70-year-old is just getting into politics, more power to them.		But if they’ve been warming a chair for 25+ years and are still applying the political instincts they learned in the 80s &amp; 90s to today, bye felicia.

@StrategicThghts @Lotuslander1000 @DevonRowcliffe @BillTieleman @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @jdouglaslittle @VaughnPalmer @markgreenan If you’re doing MMP, this is probably the best answer. If not, no such thing as “constituency” vs. “proportionality” ridings; all are both.
@Autarkh @mattyglesias Even though it’s basically just two ways of saying “democracy is good”.
@FairDistrictsPA So right.		And I like your formulation: "fair districts, fair elections, real representation”. This fight is bigger than just lines on a map. And in fact the best solutions have nothing to do with lines on a map at all (ie, #PropRep to #MakeAllVotesCount.)
@massivetotoro @jacksantucci @gelliottmorris People who’ve used ranked ballots (Australians, Irish) know it’s not too hard to vote. But ranked ballots present a real challenge for vote-counting (non-summable) and give easy way for reform opponents to stop reform (just nerd-snipe reform supporters &amp; ordinary voters tune out)
@massivetotoro @jacksantucci @gelliottmorris If you’re going to do PR with a threshold, it’s important to have a way to transfer sub-threshold votes rather than just throwing them away. So good job for that.		But I think you can do this without ranked ballots. Eg, have MMP with local and regional votes, transfer if ≠.

@Melway_27_J3 @fairvote Anyway, my original plea was "don't assume that prop-rep = multi-member-districts". That's good advice if it's even a debatable point.
@Melway_27_J3 @fairvote Closed party list? Agreed.		Open party list? Agree to disagree.		Methods like PLACE, FMV, or open DMP? Your argument doesn't even apply.		(If you don't recognize those method names, I can give links.)

@Melway_27_J3 @fairvote AFAIK, only constitutional requirement is "The HoR shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states,...". "Direct election" is for Senators.		As for federal laws: not an issue if #PropRep itself is a federal law (for gerrymandered states).

@StrategicThghts @kfk222 @BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @markgreenan @BCGreens Twitter isn't the place where the argument will be won. But it may be the place where the winning argument is crafted.		That doesn't help the "no" side much, because they're relatively few and centralized. Not so for the "yes" side.

@NAACP_LDF @CampaignLegal The struggle to #MakeEveryVoteCount goes beyond just #FairMaps. With #ProportionalRepresentation, maps wouldn't even matter. #PropRep methods count all votes no matter where they came from, and some such methods can still also guarantee 1 winner per existing district.
@fairvote #electoralreform, #ProportionalRepresentation: Yes!!		But please don't say "the only way is multi-member districts". #PropRep methods which use existing districts and voting machines exist, and they too would #EndGerrymandering and #MakeEveryVoteCount. Inclusive language please.
@BrigitYoung @mattyglesias Oh, come on now. He didn't really *assert* that. He was JAQing off. You can&lt;s&gt;'t&lt;/s&gt; blame him for that.
@hels Unfortunately, #NotAllMen.
@FairvoteVan Yes! The simplicity that matters is simplicity for the voter, and the burden of strategic voting is a big part of that.		Simplicity of written rules is only important as a means to an end: a system that you can trust. Citizens' juries are another way to get to that trust.	#PR4BC
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens But take a diehard anti-#PropRep advocate, and odds are very high that it’s for partisan (and thus anti-democratic) reasons.		I prefer to temper my partisan conviction with democratic faith: if my side doesn’t win once the playing field’s been leveled, then maybe we shouldn’t.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens There are some legit skeptics about #PropRep over other things. But 93% of the time, they end up liking it when they learn more. 		(Why “93%”? That’s how many of the people from all over BC in the 2004 Citizens’ Assembly supported #PR4BC over FPTP, after study and debate.)
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens tld̦r: If you support FPTP over #PropRep for partisan reasons, you’re saying that people don’t know what’s good for them. Sometimes that’s actually true, but *always* it’s anti-democratic.		(And btw, it seems to account for the majority of strong opposition to #PR4BC.)
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens So, @BillTieleman, do you still think I'm a #ScaryZealot for #PR4BC? Honest question; I'd really like to know if this thread seems more reasonable and clear than the bit you quoted.		#bcpoli	(Prev tweet # should be #BCliberals not #BCLib, sorry.)
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens So when I say that opposition to #PropRep reveals a lack of faith in democracy, I'm not calling @BillTieleman an autocrat. I'm sure he does believe democracy is better than dictatorship. He just seems to believe even more strongly that #BCNDP is better than #BCLib or #BCGreens.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens Belief in democracy is a meta-belief, a faith in process. Like any faith, it's sometimes hard to keep: for @BillTieleman, for me, or anyone else. Example: when 🇦🇺 had a plebiscite on marriage rights, I thought that was wrong; some rights should be beyond majority rules.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens I fit that into my earlier tweet by saying "“...you can’t think you’re correct, believe in democracy &amp; not support #PropRep”. But of course I don't think @BillTieleman hates democracy. I just think he's sometimes more of a New Democrat than a small-d democrat. That's... normal.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens Hoping for a false majority is priotitizing your partisan beliefs over your belief in democracy. If you trusted democracy to get it right, and you think your party has it right, you would expect your party to be able to win a majority of voters, and thus a #PropRep majority.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens I believe (may be wrong) that part of the reason you, @BillTieleman, oppose #PR4BC is partisan: you think that FPTP is more likely to give the #BCNDP a majority.		I'm pointing out that if a party gets a majority under FPTP but not #PropRep, that's a false, undemocratic, majority.
@BillTieleman @jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens You just called us scary zealots. I could respond in high dudgeon about how that rhetoric is irresponsible. But actually, I think it's just an honest misunderstanding of what i said, and probably partly my fault.		The phrase you quoted wasn't a standalone slogan, it had context:
@gelliottmorris Sure, median is better if you're going to show just one. But then you shouldn't use the word "expectation", which has a technical meaning of "mean". Find a synonym that's not anyone's jargon. Or just say "median", to be clear.
@gelliottmorris "Expectation" should mean "mean", but eyeballing it that looks like the median to me. 		Whichever one it is, it would be good to mark the other one on the graph too.
@jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @BillTieleman @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens My own politics put me in a minority. But of course I believe I'm in the correct minority! Without FPTP twisting &amp; impoverishing the debate, I believe we'd get more &amp; more to join us.		In other words, you can't think you're correct, believe in democracy, and not support #PropRep.
@jdouglaslittle @FairvoteVan @BillTieleman @DevonRowcliffe @DavidChudnovsky @davidwebergreen @VaughnPalmer @StrategicThghts @markgreenan @BCGreens All sides should think they can grow and/or win on a level playing field. And that's all #PropRep is: a level playing field, where voters can vote their honest preferences and results reflect all votes.		Not all sides can be right about that, but all should believe it.
@Dancebennink Heck, maybe it should be a hashtag: #WhyLobbyistsLoveFPTP		#PR4BC #bcpoli #ProportionalRepresentation #electoralreform #endFPTP
@Dancebennink 3. In FPTP, if donors can buy off the two biggest parties, they're home free.		In #PropRep, small parties are like the kid in "Emperor's New Clothes". It's not outsized power they ask for, just enough voice to point out (and not be ignored) when major parties sell out.
@Dancebennink 2. FPTP reduces voter options, so negative campaigning is more effective. They don't call hitting someone's past a "cheap" attack for nothing.		#PropRep means you have more options, so attack ads are useless. Just because I don't like her doesn't mean I'm going to vote for you.
@Dancebennink Important to understand why lobbyi$ts love FPTP:		1. Imposes strong strategic incentives on voters to support one of top two local candidates, so candidates spend to be perceived as viable.		#PropRep means you vote w/your heart, not your fears. Makes you harder to manipulate.	...
Something for me to keep in mind.		Also, I spend a lot of time thinking about making PR even better: thinking about the relative advantages (and disadvantages) of each specific method. But those differences pale as compared to huge advantages of all #PropRep over FPTP. https://t.co/8GzWHEOTXD
@TimCField @mattyglesias Changing voting methods is not actually that hard. 		I mean, politically speaking, it's an uphill fight, but no more so than other civil rights struggles in history. And technically speaking, it's not much more challenging than everyday.
@AndrewTKnudsen @mattyglesias @chrislhayes We're at like 1 hp. "Can't survive too many" is an understatement.
@jamesmdunne @mattyglesias Starry-eyed activist voice (mine): "Sorting, gerrymandering, tomayto, tomahto. It's all FPTP, and #PropRep would fix the whole problem."
@gelliottmorris @mattyglesias Putting red on top is not a neutral choice here. Can we see the same graph with blue on top?
@mattyglesias Easy response: #EndGerrymandering.		But how? #FairMaps reduce the problem (which is a BFD), but they don't eliminate it.		My hope is that #PR4BC shows the way, and starts a wave of new, improved #PropRep across #cdnpolj, #uspoli, and #UKpolitics. ETA in US Congress: 2021.
@elmhirst_jamie @BillTieleman @Bzubyk #PropRep means you win through majority coalitions, not false majorities. The best prop-rep methods (such as PLACE) encourage coalition building both before and after elections (within and between parties).
@elmhirst_jamie @BillTieleman @Bzubyk Yes, in the US and UK, FPTP has been doing a great job preventing a rise of radicalism.		...but seriously. #PropRep or FPTP don't create radical groups, they just change the incentives they face. FPTP, aka winner-take-all, encourages polarization and divisive rhetoric...
@BillTieleman Politics involves tradeoffs. News at 11.		Democracy is as foundational a principle to Greens as environmentalism. And in the long term, healthy democracy supports a healthy environment.
@BillTieleman @avlijass Another perspective: https://t.co/cPIKijhR4F		(Balllot wording and drop in Liberal voter support)
@BillTieleman @avlijass Thanks. I also see your article at https://t.co/dQ7zCiWjFE ... disagree of course with the opinions but interesting insider view on facts of campaign strategies.
@thehill  https://t.co/BNPhkkhiWC
@beachmagoo @warrenksmith @Caneshaker @AaronWherry Explanation on the disproportionality numbers: Greens would win seats basically wherever they had a candidate with &gt;25% locally, but that would not be enough proportionally. So their extra ballots would transfer where they chose; probably to the “greenest" of the NDP candidates.
@beachmagoo @warrenksmith @Caneshaker @AaronWherry explanation on the local/regional MP numbers: in PLACE, you are guaranteed to have a rep from your district, and also to have 1 rep from each party accountable to your district. If you have any preference (even 2nd or 3rd) for any winning party, you will have a rep to go to.
@beachmagoo @warrenksmith @Caneshaker @AaronWherry 1/	Local MPs: 338	Regional MPs: 0	Over-rep by party (approx): Lib: +/-2; Con +/-2; NDP, +3 (from Greens); Bloc, +/-1; Greens, -3% (-5% in BC where they have 17%).	Gallagher index: ~5%	% voters w/local MP: 45%	% voters w/regional MP: 99%		…ERRE didn’t look at it.
@warrenksmith @beachmagoo @Caneshaker @AaronWherry By the way, I had to check if you were Warren Smith the voting theorist who (re)invented score voting. Guess you’re not but it’s still funny.
@albertarabbit @Caneshaker @beachmagoo @warrenksmith @AaronWherry “my choice only or no one” makes proportional representation impossible, which ends up *worse* for small parties. Basically, you end up with no-one.		Better a system that lets small parties get votes and grow even before they get seats.
@warrenksmith @beachmagoo @Caneshaker @AaronWherry Have you seen PLACE voting? https://t.co/o4KyLhVvYL		Checks all your boxes:	✅ Proportional	✅ Local representation	✅ Candidate-based	✅ Fair to independents but still encourages coalition parties	✅ All votes count; even if you vote for tiny party, your ballot still matters.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 9/Constitutional basis? As I said, guaranty clause; but, more importantly, 14A equal protection, which gerrymandering clearly violates.		@RepDonBeyer #USPoli #ProportionalRepresentation #RootStrikers #EndGerrymandering #EndFPTP @RepresentDotUs
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 8/It’s easy to write an objective test for partisan gerrymandering: “a partisan process that results in a high efficiency gap”.		Would a bill that applied only in such places be “less” than the #FairRepAct? No, because it could include state-level elections (by guaranty clause).
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 7/Finally, with something like this, I’d argue it’s more important to get a foot in the door than to change the system everywhere all at once. So, instead of imposing #PropRep country-wide as in the #FairRepAct, I’d suggest just wherever partisan gerrymandering is bad.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 6/And, as compared to the pure STV in the current FRA bill, it actually has more of the aspects which, in the Australian implementation of STV, have been good for gender balance. That is, it doesn’t rely purely on individual voters to carefully fill all their ranks. Can delegate.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 5/Of course, I have a system in mind: PLACE voting. https://t.co/o4KyLhVvYL		Much less disruptive to voters, administrators, and even incumbent officeholders: thus, more likely to pass.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 4/So, what would a good #PropRep system for an improved FRA look like?		1. Simple for voters and administrators, using same voting machines.	2. Requires no redistricting, so states can’t drag their feet at federal mandate.	3. Good for women/minority representation and turnout.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 3/It would still be great! But if you’re pushing a long-shot proposal like this, you want something with as few defects as possible. 		Lobbyists hate #electoralReform, and they know exactly how to go negative. Just ask anybody in the #PR4BC campaign about that sometime…
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 2/The heart of the FRA is the idea of #PropRep: X% of the votes should get X% of the seats. There are many #PropRep voting methods; the one in the FRA is one of the more complicated for voters and election administrators.
@repwomen @RepDonBeyer @Reflect_US @mindyfinn @LMart939 @kimberp_a @erinlooscutraro @erinvilardi @annebmoses @MonicaRamirezDC @KristinHayden 1/Yes, the #FairRepresentationAct would be the biggest improvement in US democracy in 97 years (not 100 because of 19A).		But a few tweaks to that bill could make it more likely to pass, and better if it did.
@jacksantucci @TimRothIRV @GreenPartyUS @KristinEberhard Primary source re: Gove’s 1893 #PropRep proposal:		https://t.co/gzlUviCQw2		TFW your “new” idea is ~125 years old… #IveBeenThere
@jacksantucci @TimRothIRV @GreenPartyUS I think that the risk of “gate-kept party lists” arising in practice would be less with partial delegation, a la PLACE, than with full “above the line”-style delegation, even if the latter is at the candidate rather than the party level.
@jacksantucci @TimRothIRV @GreenPartyUS @KristinEberhard Well, PLACE isn’t ranked at all, but it is “predeclared”. Which is pretty similar to “pre-ranked”.
@TimRothIRV @jacksantucci @GreenPartyUS @KristinEberhard Yes, thank you Jack.		Tim: check out https://t.co/o4KyLhVvYL		This is a #PropRep method for legislatures, while you’re talking about IRV/single-winner offices. But similar ideas. I’d like to have a deeper (non-tweet-length) discussion: OK if I dm you?
@fairvotebc Actually, though, I think I probably got ① and ② backwards, at least for the main #PR4BC opponents.
@fairvotebc @smyoungca @GriffinCOA @Michael_F_Coyle Advantages of FPTP:		① Status quo, so it seems simpler than making a choice to change voting methods.		② Sometimes my party gets a false majority! Woohoo!		③ … there is no ③.
