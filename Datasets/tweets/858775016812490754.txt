@portrayporter @thehill @ladygaga I don't agree with everything he says but he is the President of the United states and deserves as much respect as Obama or Bush.
@thehill Idk about yall but @ladygaga is my go to source for all political information.
But politics isn't tech. It isn't black and white. It isn't binary. Peoples lives are marred in shades of gray.
I think their are so many progressives in tech because the nature of tech is just that, progressive. It needs to be to succeed.
Companies like Tesla and Uber. Go billions of dollars in debt and no one bats an eye. If your local restaurant defaults on a payment uh ohh
It's bothersome. But it's something the tech world deals with everyday. These companies don't operate under the same rules regular people do
The pillar of true conservatism is feasible economic policy. That's something I see our current government straying away from.
True conservatives support diversity of race and gender. They also support equal rights for all.
Twitter is such a crazy medium for discourse.
