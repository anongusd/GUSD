@CNNPR @realDonaldTrump So you think it’s ok for a man strike a women standing at the feet of The President of The United States of America??? Secrete Service should have shot your reporter on the spot. He needs to be in Jail. How can you defend this behavior???
@Acosta You are Slime. Assaulting a Women doing her job at the feet of The President of The United States. Secret Service should have shot you on site. Why you are not in jail is beyond me. Be sure to wear a white tank top tomorrow. #womenbeater

Sadly I've brought home a call from work today. It involves a women who blew off half her head with a .357. I know this because her husband told me over &amp; over. She took her life because they had an argument about dinner. She wanted a Pork Chop and was denied. #loveyourfamily
Good Morning America!!! Welcome Home @POTUS https://t.co/taJfz1x187

I’m staying up ALL NIGHT to watch History being made. So far I’m amazed at what’s happen. I’m behind @potus 100% but I DO NOT LIKE the idea of NoKo leader being invited to the Whitehouse. Take him to @MarALago if you like, but not the Whitehouse. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #nobel #peace #maga

Thought eating lunch outside would be nice today. It’s only 67° and windy out, but still enjoyable. Hoping everyone is having a Great Day. #serenitynow https://t.co/LBrSXlmA85
Soooooooooo i call the wife to share my day and possibly get a nice pick me up. After me spewing the day events so far. Her priceless responce is "Carol. Bed. Sleeping. Eyes closed." That made me laugh. #justwhatthedrordered
My Hanging call has escalated into something much worse then first thought. #prayformantecountytoday
Lots of outdoor activities this weekend in Manatee County. I was hoping for a peaceful day. So far ive had a women who had her tire shot out in a road rage incident. Then i get a homeless man hanging in a tree from a suicide. Its barely 9:00am. #	 canonlygetfromhere
This is what happens when i left unsupervised. #crossoffbucketlist https://t.co/rZoNiVrOq1

@tictoc Sadly this is  sign of the times. Kids don’t play outside with toys these days. It’s ALL internet based now. Kids staying indoors now.
Anyone else watching the #SOTU  with spouse/someone else who is clapping, cheering, standing up, shedding a tear like they are in that room??? I feel my Wife❤️ @potus more then me. She’s a true supporter of President Trump. God Bless America. My Home Sweet Home🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.
@mikememoli @TimRyan Wrongfully??? I disagree 100%. ILLEGAL aliens do not belong in America. Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! Deport! 👟them out
80°. No football. Nothing else to do but go down to the water. Sending warmth up North.😎😎😎🌴🌴🌴 https://t.co/z4s0g5fIkN
Its offical. I have the Flu. Lots of water &amp; plently of rest for me. 😷😷😷
So im offically under the weather. Here to get meds (skittles) to feel better soon. I hope i get a red lollipop for being a good little boy. 🤧🤧🤧😷😷😷🤢🤢🤢
And just like that I’m starting to feel a little congestion in my chest.😷🤢😷. It would appear the Dr might be right. I am NEXT.  I HATE when that happens! Let’s see where this all goes. Wife still has deep congestion coughing going on, but she is medicated. 🤧😷🤧
So it’s official my Wife has the Flu. She is medicated and doing well currently. When the nice Dr was telling my Wife she had the Flu, he pointed directly 👉🏻 to me and said “You’re Next.”  “Thanks Dr” I said to myself quietly. 😷😷😷🤒🤒🤒🤢🤢🤢 #baddr #flu
Just got an elbow in the ribs as my wife whispers to me "Im the sickest person here, no one is coughing like me." #yesdear
Huge sign on door "If you're experiencing flu like symptoms please wear a mask." There must be 9 people in here wearing mask. So im guessing its Flu Season
Typical Monday morning feelings physically, mentally &amp; emotionally after working all weekend. Unfortunately wife is ill. Probably has the Flu. Gonna take her soon to Dr Office to find out. #haveaniceday 😀😀😀 https://t.co/Tb19EmPYPM
In honor of it being over 70° outside for the first time in over a week, I’ve decided to eat lunch outdoors today. 😎😎😎 This warmth feels soooooo good. Didn’t help that my last call was for neighbors throwing dog  💩 at each other. #haveaniceday https://t.co/dEYy8mXzso

Yet another night with NO POWER in this heat. Not as oppressive as past night's. Still, forced to sleep in car again to stay cool. #irma
I find it very hard taking calls today. I keep wanting to ask people "Do you have electricity?" I'm very tired. Batteries are very low.
Heat just unbearable. Had to seek relief even if it's just for one night. Got the LAST room available. Feels good to be cool. Still no power
