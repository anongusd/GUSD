@ExcuzeMiReturn Just because your phone is dry on the outside, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dry on the inside. To take care of that, fill a bowl with uncooked rice and bury your phone in it.		The rice wicks away the moisture trapped inside your phone, ensuring that it is completely dry inside and out.
@ExcuzeMiReturn Now that your phone is off and cleaned, you‚Äôll have to dry it off. If your handset has a removable battery or removable microSD card, take it out. Similarly, if your phone has some kind of port cover or even a removable back panel, open it up to let your handset air out.

Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot resign as PM. By virtue of the court of appeal interim order on the quo warranto case, and the two NCMs passed against him, he does not function as prime minister. He only backs down from staking a claim to the office after a 50 day

NEWS FLASH:  With the CA order confirming the Nov 14 NCM that toppled @PresRajapaksa and his purported cabinet, ministry secretaries too lose their jobs.  If they attempt to exercise powers of the office they held, they are in contempt of court and committing a criminal offence.
#Srilanka: In parliament-  2 NCMs, a motion against  @PresRajapaksa's speech, one on selection committee, 2 on blocking funds to PMO and other ministries respectively. In court - SC stayed dissolution and restrained EC from preparing for snap polls; https://t.co/6xsoH1VYDU
He is completely wrong if he thinks ministry secretaries are in office today. With the PM and cabinet losing Nov 14 NCM and reconfirmed by CA order of Dec 3, ministry secretaries have ceased to hold office under Article 52 (3) and 49 (1) https://t.co/rDtp3WpdKq
It would be a good idea to remain all ministry secretaries of this provision. If they try to exercise the powers of their office, they will be criminally held accountable. Penal Code 114 and 115 waiting for them with a 20 year paid retirement at Welikada.

Court of Appeal restraints @PresRajapaksa  and his purported cabinet exercising the authority of the office they claim until they can prove they are entitled to hold such office. Huge Victory. Here is at least one arm of the state that is functioning. Thank you the judiciary.
