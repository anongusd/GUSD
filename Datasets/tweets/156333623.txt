Michael Cohen did NOT lie about President Trump’s racist comments on “s—-hole” countries, there being nice people among the bigots in Charlottesville, or separating babies of color from their families. President Trump IS a racist. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead

Today at the Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, I will question Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the politicization of the @federalreserve. We cannot allow the Fed to be politicized. It must remain an independent &amp; autonomous body not subject to the whims of a reckless President.

My prayers are with India and all Americans of Indian ancestry as we are saddened by today's massive terrorist attack. I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the many victims senselessly murdered as a result of this tragedy and condemn all acts of terrorism.

.@realDonaldTrump is correct in saying there's a crisis at the southern border. However, his deceitful projection of this crisis is inflamed by his policies rooted in lies and bigotry. The reality is this is a humanitarian crisis that begs a REAL humanitarian response NOT a wall.
On a 60 Minutes segment with Anderson Cooper, @AOC said that President Trump is a racist. SHE IS RIGHT! I would also add that he can and should be impeached for the bigoted policies emanating from his presidency. #CountdownToImpeachment #ImpeachmentIsNotDead

.@realDonaldTrump where is your moral compass? You have separated children from their parents, indeed babies from their mothers, &amp; your solution is “do not come to this country.” We the people demand the court’s deadline become a lifeline to return children to their parents.
.@realDonaldTrump your policy of separating children from parents without a plan for reunification will haunt you for the rest of your days. What you have done to these families pleading for help is shameful &amp; antithetical to the noble American ideal of liberty &amp; justice for all.
Republican #SCOTUS appointees Roberts, Thomas, Alito, &amp; Gorsuch are members of the Federalist Society. So are all 3 candidates on Trump's shortlist. If the majority of the justices are members of this conservative group, will the majority of the decisions be federalist decisions?

Mr. President, a pardon won’t bring back the countless minorities who make up 62% of unarmed persons killed by police. It won’t bring back Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Danny Thomas, &amp; others.

Mr. President, a summit should be a sensible, thoughtful action, not a visceral, thoughtless reaction. Diplomats must set the summit table with substance before presidents sit to dine, otherwise it reduces the opportunity to a photo op. #NorthKoreaTalks
If President Trump meets w/ President Kim Jong Un as a visceral reaction to a calculated invitation at least 2 things will occur, 1) Kim Jong Un will gain legitimacy on the world stage, &amp; 2) N. Korea will gain legitimacy as a nuclear state. A good deal for Kim, a raw deal for us.
