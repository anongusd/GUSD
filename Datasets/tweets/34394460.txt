@fkargoll Keep up - I replied to this on my feed 5 hours ago. Remain civil, please. If you continue being rude you will be blocked.
Not just one poll.  Rasmussen is the only one in the RCP group that shows above 50, much less 55. Gallup, at the other end, is 40.
@fkargoll As definitive as an emoji is, one shouldn't rely on a single poll.
@Thegetawayplan9 You may be right -- we'll see. Still think there are going to be some tough ones ahead.  Thanks for weighing in!
@Thegetawayplan9 Depends on how you measure. Recent admins had a handful of outliers, but not this volume of late confirmations.
@twizzler_21 Ayotte:"he said that he finds ANY(emph mine) criticism of a judge's integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.”
@twizzler_21 Ayotte, Bonjean, and Blumenthal.  It's okay to be polite, by the way.
@JayTowers @FOX2News Thanks, Jay - great to speak with you as always!

Another #Obamacare delay, pushing back possible rate hikes next year from 10/15 to 11/15.  In between?  Midterm elections.
Talking about #filibuster fallout this morning - and whether Dems will ultimately regret the change.
Fetch your Geiger counter and brace for the fallout - @SenatorReid just went nuclear.
Kill-ibuster: @SenatorReid about to change senate filibuster rules.
Circling the wagons: liberal writers and commentators just arriving at White House, expecting to meet with @POTUS.
Just nine days to go. HHS says, "we’ve completed fixes for two-thirds of the high priority bugs" #Obamacare
Hovering just above 40: @POTUS job approval / disapproval rcp avg. 40.3 / 55.3. #obamacare fallout.
How clear were warnings about the #Obamacare site prior to launch? I'll have a newly disclosed email on @foxfriendsfirst at 530am ET.

"It's not on them, it's on us."  POTUS providing cover for vulnerable Dems in congress over broken #Obamacare promise.
The problem: will POTUS #Obamacare fix leave insurance cos. with a risk pool that is too small, too poor and too sick.
POTUS will emerge at 11:35am to talk #Obamacare -- Look for a proposed fix for those who are losing their insurance due to new regs.
Will Dems in Congress defect over #Obamacare enrollment numbers? Join me on @FoxFriendsFirst at 5:30am EST @ainsleyearhardt @HeatherChilders
@CynicalMike Remember, #Obamacare Prime comes with free shipping.
Fewer than 27,000 #Obamacare enrollments came through the federal website.
@GOPfashionista Good question. Our understanding is that it includes only shopping cart entries, not paid policies.
106,185 #Obamacare enrollments.
#Obamacare enrollment numbers coming out any minute now...
The tell: the closer to Friday afternoon the @whitehouse waits to release #Obamacare enrollment numbers, the worse they will be.
Another blown deadline will exacerbate issues for individuals who are losing coverage. #obamacare http://t.co/W2jsTIt0NI
