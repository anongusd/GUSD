@KateOH Speaking of moving parts, note the abject disrespect of @CastleABC by SNL at about the 1 minute mark: http://t.co/ZbuBxdQ2gn
@KateOH @ForeverABC It would be interesting to see how such "second chance/second seasons" have worked out - or not - for shows in the past.
When @Castle_ABC needs a bald (political) corpse --&gt;MT @KateOH McCotter, when are you going to make your Castle cameo? You are a superfan!
@KateOH Understood, but the networks often give a splendid show like @ForeverABC a second season to grow its fan base. Rats....
@KateOH  Relieved ABC renewed @Castle_ABC but saddened at the cancellation of @ForeverABC  Was there a reason given for the latter?
