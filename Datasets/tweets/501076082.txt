@StephanGrootes now the sudden concern for their employees ? The damage caused is self inflicted . Could this be a “technical ploy” to keep the investigations at bay ? The appointment of a liquidator is going to be an interesting one. All delay tactics of the inevitable ? https://t.co/pAYVVSCgaq
Let the tender process begin ! New tenders should only be considered when taking on existing staff , excluding the “fat cats”, believe me there are a few ! https://t.co/Gdx4afDfwJ

How about putting more effort in recovering wasteful expenditure and the monies stolen , it could well amount to the shortfall taking into account all enquiries and commissions as well as the costs of conducting such enquiries and commissions. https://t.co/pai2HcvzVM
@chrisyelland question who has the contract to supply the diesel , could it be Koko’s daughter ? or some other dubious contractor ? https://t.co/VJ7rjY2Qtj
@helenzille thank you for your contributions amidst some challenging times. The ANC have always walked away and out from their responsibilities, not surprising ! Respect not in their vocabulary. https://t.co/aDCCshTIsR
#FreeEducationNow , question ! 1. Do we have enough facilities to accommodate students 2. Do we have enough qualified lecturers 3. Do we have the budget to meet these obligations 3. Assuming all are in place, do we have an economy that can accommodate all in the labour market. https://t.co/YWFjEziG5x
Mr Fikile, we all knew that Mr Koko is a “skelm” of note, why then sir did you and the ANC allow him to steadily “rape” Eskom. If my memory serves my correctly sir, were you not “the sherif” in town ? How come he still roams SA freely ? Eish sir ! https://t.co/DF0V8bPUhI

Mr Lekota, missed a golden opportunity at ANC Conference, had you revealed your “story” then we could still be in the hands Zuma and his cronies and you would have been the “golden boy” for some. I smell a rat could the ANC detractors of Ramaphosa have offered Lekota a deal. https://t.co/UEg23g84lz

#EFF I have to “commend” the EFF leadership on their choice of party name. They have “nailed” their short term goal in garnering support for a “front” for economic freedom. Could their long term goal be “Everything For Free” ? Just a thought.
