@phogasmic BO is a harvard educated attorney. He knows what he's doing. He assumes the American ppl r stupid.
@phogasmic A very big loophole!! Actually!!!
@phogasmic R U an attorney? How much experience do u have interpreting fed  laws? Been doing it 4  ten years myself. Joe Wilson was right.
@phogasmic No verification language nullified the language contained in the bill.
@phogasmic Work with legal documents n my profession. U must state the obvious 2 clearify your meaning.  Leave nothing 2 interpretation.
@phogasmic Why would dems fight verification?? No verification = free hc for illegals. Eventually make them citizens r assured their vote.
Keep the Yale grad student & her family in your prayers. I pray they find her alive.
@phogasmic Dems refused to have verification in the bill before Wilsons shout out. Dems voted down all verification amendments. Curious???
@CongJoeWilson Go Joe. Your shout out wednesday night caused a major change in hc policy. THANKS!!! Don't apologize!!!!
Go Joe!! Wilson will not apologize on the house floor. Good for him. Willing to take his lumps & stand his ground. Love this guy!!
@phogasmic Hope we will tweet again soon. Stew
@phogasmic I have to go but I have enjoyed our tweets very much. U engaged me & tried to change my mind without throwing insults..
@phogasmic BOs agenda is not about hc reform. This is about govnt control of every aspect of our lives. I'm sick of it & all the spending.
@phogasmic We do not need another entitlement program right now. SS, Medicare & medicaid r bankrupt. We need to fix those programs.
@phogasmic In a short while it will be the only choice.
@phogasmic I want officials elected to lower those rates.
@phogasmic I have no direct contact with pharma cos. I do have direct contact with my doctors. Don't want to govnt involved.
@phogasmic Would you rather pay an 8% fine to govnt or pay 11% or 12% per employee for hc coverage. No brainer 4 businesses. Drop hc.
@phogasmic Only during the grace period. Then the govnt steps in.
@phogasmic Their tax rates are sky high.
@phogasmic Bill has incentives for companies to drop ppl off employer sponsored hc plans after the grace period.
@phogasmic Not talking about medications.
@phogasmic one out of 2 million people.
@phogasmic A conserv bill would only have tort reform, state to state competition, & tax incentives. Thats all that's needed IMO.
@phogasmic It will morph into single payer soon enough. Ppl seldom loose all their freedom all at once.
@phogasmic I do not want to govnt part of something so personal & intimate as my hc. This is not about reform but control of our lives.
@phogasmic no offense taken.
@phogasmic None today & none at the 4/15 Richmond tea party I took my 2 kids to.
@phogasmic We do have one. Sadly a radical.  A lot of the non blacks I know voted for him. They now regret it big time.
@phogasmic I saw no signs pertaining 2 race today. U have 2 accept that a lot of people don't like BO's marxist policies. Race not a factor
@phogasmic You want me to judge my conservative friends today by what they may or may not have done 40 yrs ago??? Why??
@phogasmic Appreciate ur civility. I can't stand with BO on politics.  We r complete opposites. I'd rather have my freedom than his handouts
@phogasmic I stand for my own beliefs. Limited govnt intrusion in my life, freedom, low taxes, my constitutional rights preserved.
@phogasmic I'm his worse nightmare. I read, research & think for myself. Also, thank God my mom raised me to hate govnt dependency!!
