@RepClayHiggins You said on CNN you are "a Constitutionalist", yet you voted "No" on the "Vote to Block Emergency Declaration". Since Trump's "Emergency Declaration" seeks to circumvent Article I of the Constitution, I think you must STOP saying you are "a Constitutionalist"!
@kathrynw5 Put him in jail... then he won't be able to violate the gag order.

@essenviews The $0.00 stamp (i.e., "no cents" or "nonsense").
@guygavrielkay @TheRickWilson Ha ha ha ha ha ha. You can't be serious.
@KenDilanianNBC This is PRECISELY why the man is so dangerous. He is not moved by logic... and that's scary. He needs to be removed from office for lying and not thinking.
@MollyJongFast Agreed...
@RadioFreeTom @AshaRangappa_ I'd be happy if Stephen F. Miller never again set foot in U.S.
@mkraju Please, no more billionaire candidates who have NO experience in military or NO experience in governing. We should learn our lesson...
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Wrong, wrong, wrong. If the President declares a national emergency to a "manufactured crisis", you can bet that future presidents will use the same tactic for their pet projects... e.g., gun violence, climate change, etc.
@realDonaldTrump Private Bone Spurs, you are in no position to cast aspersions.
@realDonaldTrump You are clearly ignorant...
@mkraju If T-Rump tries to shut down the government again, on Day One, 100% of air traffic controllers and 100% of TSA workers should call in sick. The shutdown would be very short...
@mkraju Lazy!!!
@MollyJongFast No more people with NO military and/or NO government creds. Period!
@marcorubio Finally a Biblical quote from you with which I agree (BIG exception... despite Trump's desire that we be a kingdom, we are NOT!!!). So what do you propose to do about bringing "the house" together?
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Donald Trump you are a pathetic loser. Go away.

@realDonaldTrump You are a hypocrite... what about all those undocumented workers you hired at your "exclusive" golf clubs all those years? https://t.co/OOhWy4TN2C
⚡️ “Trump's golf course employed undocumented workers. Some of them were fired this month.”		https://t.co/1b5FGhe5sV	Maybe he should build a Wall around his golf courses, to keep the illegal aliens out...

@SenatorTimScott @henrymcmaster @scgovernorpress @SCcommerce DO YOUR DAMN JOB! Re-open the government. You are COMPLICIT in 800,000 Federal workers not getting paid. Disconnect the immigration issue from re-opening the government!
@RandPaul Dude: SOTU address is not necessary. Here's the state:  The President shut down the government. The House is passing bills to re-open it. The Senate is obstructing progress by not voting on them for a month. End of Speech.
@SenJohnKennedy @USCG Dude:  DO YOUR DAMN JOB! Re-open the government and then ALL the Federal workers currently affected will start getting paid. You need to disconnect the immigration issue from re-opening the government. You are COMPLICIT in the Coast Guard not getting paid.
@abbydphillip Baloney!
@SenCapito @POTUS You need to vote on the House-passed bill to RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT!!! Only THEN take the time to negotiate complex immigration issues. You are COMPLICIT in holding 800,000 Federal workers and additionally Federal contractors HOSTAGE.

You are COMPLICIT in holding 800,000 Federal workers HOSTAGE! Open the government, then talk about complex immigration issues.
@tedcruz It would be nice if you re-opened the government &amp; helped out Texas' many Federal workers... you seem like you are campaigning for 2020 Presidency with this... NOT concentrating on TODAY's priority. You could have done that, but apparently didn't vote for the House-passed bills.
@joshtpm @dbindsch @TPM Maybe he should take a job at the Food Bank until the shutdown ends rather than just visit...

@SenJohnKennedy you are absolutely right, they need to be paid... as do ALL the 800,000 Federal workers furloughed or working without pay. SO VOTE FOR THE HOUSE-PASSED BILL AND RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT!!! Then they can ALL get paid. https://t.co/E6qMH5TSrz
@SaltyWorley @SenThomTillis Well, I suspect you don't know my "ilk". I'm neither Republican nor Democrat. I support logic. It was illogical to shut down government. It is logical to re-open it ASAP. It is illogical to expect to resolve a complex issue like immigration as a condition for re-opening the govt.
@SaltyWorley @SenThomTillis How do you know POTUS will veto the House bill (which BTW, the Senate passed weeks ago)? How do you know there aren't the votes to override the veto? I agree that 3 weeks isn't long enough to resolve border issues. But at least the government will be open &amp; some talks can start.
@SenThomTillis If you are truly interested in re-opening the government, then DO IT! Vote for the House-passed bill. THEN you can sit down with a bipartisan group and talk about the complicated matters of additional funding for border security. Your "logic" defies comprehension.
@MSNBC @CNBC What do you expect from an out of touch billionaire?!?!?
Mr. President, 		Your decision to take the low road regarding holding 800,000 Federal workers hostage will serve you ill over time (not only immediately, but in 2020 too). @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/3DwGS2V6CM

@RepGosar @AnnCoulter Yes... given Americans the security they deserve... especially the 800,000 Federal workers Republicans are holding hostage! RE-OPEN THE DAMN GOVERNMENT!!! Only THEN should you discuss a complex topic like border security.
Well, I suppose this is "legal", but it's definitely immoral given that 800,000 Federal employees are out of work AND the Federal court system will soon run out of funding... What a sham!  #ImpeachTheMF #ImpeachMcConnell https://t.co/67HTGbKChd

@SpeakerPelosi “We don’t negotiate with terrorists!”. Stand firm on not negotiating with POTUS, who is holding 800,000+ hostages.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Sorry... YOU Donald Trump are the one playing politics with Border Security by holding 800,000 Federal workers hostage. RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT YOU JERK!
@atrupar @DonaldJTrumpJr Why on Earth would Donald Trump Jr think anyone cares about what he has to say?
@realDonaldTrump What about the 58 people at a music concert in Nevada who were viciously killed by a white American citizen? We need powerful gun laws!
@AnnCoulter You forgot the part about when he said "Mexico will pay for it... mark my words".
I'm surprised it's only 1 in 10... What's the tipping point? Maybe when most of them have walked out and air travel chokes to a halt, the Senate will finally vote to re-open the government... #impeachMcConnell https://t.co/KXciKXkSxy

@golfer1116 @blak3j @mkraju Of course I'm aware that overriding a veto requires 2/3 of both houses, but I didn't think it was necessary to quote the entirety of Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution.
@mkraju McConnell needs to schedule votes on the House-passed spending bills to re-open the government. THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOBS!!! McConnell is the key roadblock here. Maybe he hasn't read the Constitution and doesn't know he can override a veto!
@RudyGiuliani Rudy, Rudy, Rudy... you are completely untrustworthy.
@kaitlancollins @mkraju Since they cancelled the trip so she could stay to negotiate, then maybe they have some incentive to offer to bring Nancy Pelosi to the table!  Doesn't seem likely, but this would be a good time for Pelosi to ask what they have to offer, since they want her at the table.

@AnnCoulter Re-open the government, and then talk about "The Wall".
@marcorubio You should stop with the religious quotes and re-open the government. Do your job!!!
@realDonaldTrump Re-open the government, then talk about border security. Do your job!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi Pass your Senate bill first, and see what happens. But really, the Senate should FIRST pass the spending bills to re-open the government. DO YOUR JOB!!!
@InquisitorFloki @AnnCoulter The new trade deal to which you refer has not been approved by Congress.
@Patrick02673426 @AnnCoulter Of course!  :-)
@AnnCoulter American taxpayers should not have to pay for something that Trump PROMISED ("Mark my words") would be paid for by Mexico. It was a stupid thing for him to promise, and it is now a stupid thing with which to hold Federal workers hostage.
@MSNBC "People" (unnamed of course) are NOT "very impressed". We are ANGRY, and Trump will pay for it.
@AnnCoulter Trump will be crushed in the next election, regardless. He is absolutely, totally unfit to hold the job, and "The Middle" and Independents and Democrats all know it.
@AnnCoulter He already broke it! He promised ("Mark my words") that Mexico would pay for it!  Thus "The Wall" is an invalid promise. He needs to move on and re-open the government.
@marcorubio @RonDeSantisFL Re-Open the government, then you can do other pet projects.
@senatemajldr Since we deserve a functioning government, give it to us!!! Vote on the spending bills passed by the House and send them to the President!!! If he doesn't sign them, OVERRIDE. Do your Constitutional duty, or resign in disgrace!
@AnnCoulter Cherry picked...
@realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter You need to offer an incentive to make a deal, Mr. Deal Maker. You offer no incentive, you get no deal. Duh!
@LeoKapakosNY @MSNBC How about 9 words? The missing word goes right before "disaster" and starts with an "F".
@MollyJongFast They should have a new Brexit referendum. The first one ended with "Leave" narrowly winning. I rather doubt that would happen now...
@marcorubio Good idea, but FIRST WORK TO RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT!!! GET McCONNELL THE SYCOPHANT TO PASS THE FUNDING BILLS! DO YOUR JOB!!!
@TheRickWilson It will likely happen, whether he wants it to or not...
@marcorubio Please stop with these religious quotes and open the government. Do your job!!!
@realDonaldTrump Do your job! Re-open the government! Then talk about border security.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Oh just go to Canada and get your surgery done...
@maggieNYT We are truly becoming a banana republic... Sad.
@senatemajldr Re-open the government. Get your priorities straight.
@maggieNYT Gross incompetence and nepotism at work... unbelievable.
@SykesCharlie @sharcat12 Since Nunes lost his power, someone has to fill the void...
@maggieNYT Maybe if growth dips below 2% he will open his eyes...
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @JohnKasich Chris I like your show, but I'd rather see Mr. Kasich run for President than be a CNN commentator (unless this is a way for him to raise his national presence).
@senatemajldr Re-open the government! Take votes on the spending bills passed by the House! YOU are the block in the process. If the President doesn't sign the bills, OVERRIDE! It's your constitutional duty.
@marcorubio @POTUS Just what is Trump offering for a compromise? I haven't seen anything...
@KatMcKinley @jaketapper Yes, he should know that it's really Donald Trump who is our #1 geopolitical foe.
@waltshaub Lindsey Graham is becoming as bad as both Trump and Guiliani...
@dtcav @essenviews Alternatively, if "The Wall" is so important to him, let HIM pay for it out of his own pocket!
@ZemanLynnZ @essenviews It's his multiple personalities talking among themselves...
@RepAdamSchiff Subpoena the notes!
@realDonaldTrump What is the factual basis for this forecast?
@marcorubio Re-open the government!!! Then talk about border security...
@RepAdamSchiff It's clear that there is a serious problem, but it's most definitely not an emergency for the reasons you state.
@realDonaldTrump That's baloney and you know it. Re-open the government!!! Then talk about border security...
@AdamSchiff How can Americans continue to believe the BS that comes out of the White House?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Re-open the government!!! Then talk about border security...
@realDonaldTrump You are a jerk, Donald Trump.
@marcorubio You are a SERVANT of the AMERICAN PEOPLE. Re-open the government!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC How can this POSSIBLY be a national emergency? You couldn't even get the votes for this "WALL" when you had House and Senate and President!!! You look like fools.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, what it's time for is for Trump to offer something to the Democrats. What is he offering now? The Democrats are at least TRYING to re-open the government! You need to put pressure on McConnell to send legislation to the President to re-open the government.
@senatemajldr @POTUS You should be impeached. You are acting like an Executive Branch toady instead of the leader of the greatest deliberative body in history. You are part of a co-equal branch of the government. Re-open the government!!!
@Acosta He also said "Mexico will pay for The Wall... Mark my words."  Ha! Anyone who believed that was seriously deluded.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump They controlled everything for TWO YEARS and weren't able to get the money for "The Wall"... now ALL OF A SUDDEN it's a National Emergency... NOT!
@GOPLeader @WhiteHouse Re-open the government! THEN talk about "The Wall"...
@marcorubio @TulsiGabbard Re-open the government!
@realDonaldTrump Quit deflecting! Re-open the government!
@ChuckGrassley Re-open the government!
@marcorubio Re-open the government!
@lisamurkowski Re-open the government!
@ChuckGrassley Re-open the government!
@marcorubio Re-open the government!
@senatemajldr @SenThomTillis Re-open the government!
@realDonaldTrump Re-open the government!
@lisamurkowski Re-open the government!
@ChuckGrassley Re-open the government!
@marcorubio Re-open the government!
@senatemajldr Re-open the government!
@realDonaldTrump Re-open the government!
@marcorubio Re-open the government!
@ChuckGrassley Re-open the government!
@realDonaldTrump I beg to differ. I think YOU are the one who has given up on the truth...
@JohnKasich I sincerely hope you are considering a bid for the 2020 Presidential nomination... I think YOU should have been the last Republican candidate standing in 2016, and am hoping you throw your hat in the ring to oppose the current poor excuse for a President. 2 cents, FYI
@realDonaldTrump You're just making this stuff up. Grow up and quit telling fairy tales.
@Card911007 @gatewaypundit @AnnCoulter Americans are free to do that. I would say that Americans who make that choice are misguided, but they are free to do it and accept the consequences.
@TheRickWilson Deplorable?
@TheRickWilson Deplorable?
@TheRickWilson Deplorable?
@Card911007 @gatewaypundit @AnnCoulter Well, after looking at the evidence, I'd say the claim that she's a "Taliban sympathizer" is pretty weak.  If you are saying that the Bible is a greater authority in American politics than the US Constitution, then I think you might be as much in error as the Taliban.
@gatewaypundit @AnnCoulter Good for her! I applaud her placing her hand on the US Constitution and Arizona Constitution! Go Kyrsten!
@realDonaldTrump There is already disruption in the Financial Markets... and you are the cause of that! Wake up!
@SykesCharlie I think that's "The Acting Swamp"...
@ananavarro The VERY first step of many, many, many!!! Frankly, he's not man enough to be a general.
@RudyGiuliani I think YOU should just shut up, and let Mueller do his job...
@NikkiHaley @amandacarpenter I can't wait until this happens to @realDonaldTrump !!!
He seems to have forgotten that he said that... https://t.co/MVfV74CYGB
@ChuckGrassley You KNOW this is a Trump Shutdown, right? The President said he would be proud to bear the mantle of shutting down the government... or maybe you didn't pay attention to the news! Wake up!
@realDonaldTrump Guess who else is known for his "big, dumb mouth"? Any ideas? Look in the mirror.
@marcorubio Thanks for laying off the Bible quotes.
@PreetBharara Call the military, maybe?
@itsjmelend @AalayahEastmond @jaketapper I don't think anyone said you were a bad person.
@itsjmelend @AalayahEastmond @jaketapper You raise some good points. In a Platonic sense, we can imagine that there exists an "ideal list" of things that "just are NOT funny". That's the list I'm talking about. Sort of similar to the "ideal chair". What is a chair?
@realDonaldTrump What a load of BS!
@realDonaldTrump The USMCA has not even been ratified yet! Total BS here, Mr. T-Rump.
@AalayahEastmond @jaketapper Thanks for letting him know that some things just are NOT funny...
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I very much doubt this will be the case. It is not possible to believe anything that Donald Trump says. It's sad, but true...
@RudyGiuliani Go away Rudy. You are a joke. And your legacy is utterly tarnished by being a stooge for Trump.
@realDonaldTrump Liar liar liar liar liar.
@realDonaldTrump Liar liar liar liar liar.
@realDonaldTrump Liar liar liar liar liar.
@ananavarro Happy Birthday!!! Keep speaking truth to power.
@MollyJongFast His paycheck should be delayed until the Govt. re-opens... but maybe there's no one in his House district that works for one of the agencies that is shut down (doubtful!).
@realDonaldTrump Who is Brad Blakeman, and how does he presume to tell me what I "understand"? What I think is that the American people have been played by an AMERICAN pseudo-actor (i.e., you). #FakePresident
@ananavarro @marcorubio @ScottforFlorida Thank you Ana!
RT @ananavarro: I’m probably not being realistic, but I really hope Republican leaders read &amp; deliberate on this important piece. Read it &amp;…
@RowzizRowz @Twitter @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is a Badge of Honor!
@JonLemire @maggieNYT No doubt about it, @realDonaldTrump is a disgrace. Glad to see him finally acknowledge that.
RT @sharcat12: A great article describing Trump perfectly. Petty, vindictive, cruel, impulsive and immature.  https://t.co/HOiTRpqnRm
@w3ph "(Poor me)" all alone at the White House...
@AprilDRyan To you too... Keep up the great work in 2019! The country depends upon you!
@realDenaldTrump @sharcat12 Now I realize I was suckered by the fake "Denald" tag!  LOL! Oh well...
@realDenaldTrump @sharcat12 This sounds like something you just made up!!! The credibility of this entire Tweet is unbelievably suspect. You are NOT doing a tremendous job, at least not a tremendously POSITIVE job. It's more tremendously NEGATIVE in character.
@abbydphillip I don't believe a single word Trump ever says anymore... and no one else should either.
@DafnaLinzer @CharlesMBlow it’s difficult to believe anyone can view this as anything other than totally abnormal.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan i thought U said ISIS has been defeated? make up your mind!!!
@realDonaldTrump wrong wrong wrong. BUT you had 3 opportunities earlier this year that you declined. those offers are no longer on the table. You should have taken them when they were offered. Sad! #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump What a loser you are! You've now lost most of the real talent you had in your Cabinet. Increasingly everyone is "acting"... but your job is NOT "reality TV". It's REALITY!!! History will judge you harshly, I have no doubt.
@waltshaub @realDonaldTrump Don't confuse him with logic...
@AnnCoulter Because Trump said "Mexico will pay for it, believe me". Duh
@Acosta So how much did the taxpayers spend to protect her on the way to Florida, in Florida, and now back to DC? What a WASTE!
@hughhewitt @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump Sorry Dude... it's a "Trump Shutdown". He promised Mexico would pay for it! Many times! American taxpayers are not Mexicans.
@ananavarro ... or both
@AdamSchiff It was NEVER about "the middle class" and everyone with an ounce of brains knew it. It was always about Donald Trump, the 40-Faketh President.
@realDonaldTrump Fake President...
@dickstevenson @maggieNYT @peterbakernyt I think Trump will turn himself into Hoover...
@RudyGiuliani Rudy we used to like you... but now you have drunk the Kool Aid (or Kook Aid). Your legacy will be tarnished forever by associating with such a crook as Trump.
@DanBarkerFFRF Zerotheism. Rah!
@realDonaldTrump The best way for you to make that happen is to leave the White House. Please consider it.
@realDonaldTrump @WashTimes I wonder what YOU would have done if YOU had inherited the economic cesspool Mr. Obama did...
@AC360 @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Chris... you asked for input. This is a general comment. Don't talk over your guests. If you are talking when your guest is talking, neither one of you is listening. Love your show... will like it even better when you wait until your guests are finished speaking. Cheers!
@waltshaub Ethics Shmethics... I wish you had stayed in your job until fired, instead of stepping down. You are clearly needed on the inside...
@realDonaldTrump California doesn't need YOU or John Cox to be great... It's already great!!!
@ananavarro That's because Obama is a classy guy. All you have to do is re-watch his final speech before leaving the Presidency. Watch that, and compare it to what we have today...
@realDonaldTrump I thought you didn't believe in polls? Hypocrite.
@SenKamalaHarris Vote "no".
@stonecold2050 she's a good one to call anyone a blatant liar.
@AnnCoulter The "Bible" is mythology. The "Voice of God" is clearly mental illness.
@MSNBC So we increase the military budget so they can stand around at the border and twiddle their thumbs... yeah, that's a good use of taxpayer dollars.
@SenKamalaHarris Now it's "Housing &amp; Urban Discrimination" (to go along with "Environmental Pollution Agency", "Department of TheFence" (i.e., "The Wall"), etc.
@stonecold2050 It will happen on his watch... check the history of recent recessions.
@realDonaldTrump If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. DJT: You can't cherry pick the polls you like. Sad.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, right. Don't you know that DACA wasn't designed to cover that?
@realDonaldTrump Just because you say it doesn't make it true. What happened to your "Bill of Love"? What a hypocritical liar you are.
@realDonaldTrump You are the fake. You are the total joke. Go away.
@realDonaldTrump @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer I don't believe it. Fake news.
@realDonaldTrump You sir are the principal embarrassment! What a gross mistake! Unbelievably Sad!
@realDonaldTrump Oh quit griping... just go play golf and quit F'ing with my country...
@stonecold2050 Right after "Infrastructure Week", correct?
@realDonaldTrump ... said the witch.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, ... , wrong. You can't make it so by repeating this over and over. You are patently transparent and an embarrassment to the USA.
@realDonaldTrump Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, ... , wrong.
@realDonaldTrump ... and you're pretty mean spirited too.
@realDonaldTrump Speaking of sanctimonious... you Sir are not really in a position to call anyone a liar.
@MagaGrace04 @PressSec @POTUS I think you forgot "UNPRESIDENTIAL" and "UNHINGED"...
@Emma4Change Go Emma!
@CNN Wrong!!! What a colossal waste of money!
@marcorubio What a ridiculous story... sounds to me like the man was mentally ill...
@RepAdamSchiff Maybe you should just leak it...
@AriMelber @WillieGeist @nytmike @maggieNYT Only T-Rump himself, and he cannot be trusted to tell the truth.
@scohenPI @FoxNews T-Rump's tweets should drive EVERYONE insane... because the prospect is sheer insanity. T-Rump needs to visit Hiroshima ASAP (museum and Peace Park).
@RepAdamSchiff How about rescinding President's unilateral power to launch a nuclear strike??? If you don't do that, the other stuff will be irrelevant.
@SenKamalaHarris How about rescinding President's unilateral power to launch a nuclear strike??? If you don't do that, the other stuff will be irrelevant.
@SenFeinstein How about rescinding President's unilateral power to launch a nuclear strike??? If you don't do that, the other stuff will be irrelevant.
@CNN Perhaps his father, maybe?
@SenKamalaHarris And how the heck is the country going to pay for the INFRASTRUCTURE renovations that everyone seems to believe need to be made??? They won't be free, and we shouldn't BORROW to do it!!!
@barry_corindia It's impossible to believe anything the WH says... SAD!!!
@CNN WTF! There should be a ZERO chance of first strike! Go to the negotiating tables!
@TheLeadCNN Only one... guess who?!?!?!
@RepKevinBrady @RepDianeBlack @RepKristiNoem No, it's not. In fact, if you look at the polls, most Americans are NOT in favor of the travesty you are joyfully signing.
@marcorubio @MikeLeeforUtah @votetimscott @IvankaTrump Traitor...
@SpeakerRyan Not "fact"... it's an estimate!
@Acosta How many people?  1?
@CNN You are full of B-S T-Rump.
@SenBobCorker What happened to your concern about the deficit spending??? Congress should be making tax laws that collect the money that the country needs! This Frankenstein bill isn't simpler, doesn't help the middle class, and doesn't generate the income the country needs to run!
@CNN Trump is playing to Trump's narcissistic weakness, of course. Trump is a Putin-puppet...
@TheLeadCNN @CNN Maybe he should leave now...
@CNNTonight @CNN Man up, Roy Moore. You lost. Concede...
@LindseyGrahamSC You need to vote NO on this fraud of a tax plan, so flawed in many ways. How many of your constituents will benefit under the proposed plan?
@SenJohnMcCain You need to vote NO on this fraud of a tax plan, so flawed in many ways. How many of your constituents will benefit under the proposed plan?
@tedcruz You need to vote NO on this fraud of a tax plan, so flawed in many ways. How many of your constituents will benefit under the proposed plan?
@marcorubio You need to vote NO on this fraud of a tax plan, so flawed in many ways. How many of your constituents will benefit under the proposed plan?
@RepAdamSchiff Those who are afraid of upsetting the Commander in Chief by telling him the truth are NOT doing their jobs! They should be replaced by people with the courage to tell the truth.
@realDonaldTrump I don't believe it for a minute!!! You are a fraud.
@SenKamalaHarris This is of course absolutely unconscionable!!! Trump only serves himself... Given the events of today with respect to key personnel in the Trump administration, it's time for Congress to slam on the brakes on "tax reform"! Trump's only agenda is self-service!
@SenFeinstein This is of course absolutely unconscionable!!! Trump only serves himself... Given the events of today with respect to key personnel in the Trump administration, it's time for Congress to slam on the brakes on "tax reform"! Trump's only agenda is self-service!
@SpeakerRyan NO TAX REFORM UNTIL THE PRESIDENT RELEASES HIS TAX RETURNS!!! We all know he only serves himself, not the country.
@donlemon I love your show, HOWEVER, you really need to let your guests speak w/o interrupting them!! Honestly, it diminishes your strength.
@nytimes Go Corker...USA needs more like YOU!!!
@realDonaldTrump Sorry, that sounds like something you just made up...
@GStephanopoulos NO "Tax Reform" until Trump releases his taxes! Otherwise there is huge suspicion of conflict of interest. Trump only serves Trump!
@TeddyDavisCNN @jaketapper Pence has never struck me as a free (or deep) thinker...
@realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. T-Rump. You WILL fail SPECTACULARLY if you start a nuclear war. NO American should die because of your over-swollen ego. NEGOTIATE!
@jemelehill I certainly hope you do NOT consider apologizing to Prez T-Rump... One of his mottoes is to "Never apologize". Turn the table!!!
@waltshaub The only thing "blind" about Trump's blind trust is the American blindness as he lines his pockets. #FakePresident
@realDonaldTrump He's a "hero" when you need him... You are a turncoat, sir.
@realDonaldTrump How many REAL friends do you have? For a man who demands loyalty, you have no credibility in return! BTW, I do NOT like Sessions.
@realDonaldTrump @SenJohnMcCain I don't think you have any intention of delivering "grt healthcare"! FAKE PROMISE! #FakePresident
@realDonaldTrump What great victory? It's only a vote for a DEBATE, sir!  Truly, that shouldn't even require a vote, let alone a tiebreaker from the VP! Sad!
@CharlesMBlow It's unbelievable... #FakePresident !!!
@Scaramucci @jaketapper @POTUS Mr. Scaramucci... you are an unbelievable sycophant. Good luck.
@realDonaldTrump Actually, sir, I believe it is YOU who is distorting democracy in our country. I'm NOT a Democrat, either... an independent.,
@realDonaldTrump @Morning_Joe Totally inappropriate Mr. President. Time to grow up...
@realDonaldTrump I think you should go after Comey!
@realDonaldTrump Comey is not a leaker... you FIRED him, remember? So he just made public the memoirs of a FORMER public servant.
@realDonaldTrump WRONG! Your quest to delegitimize President Obama was considerably worse. You are a cry baby!
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I doubt your sincerity.
@realDonaldTrump You barely squeaked by... hardly a "big win".
@realDonaldTrump You are deluded, Sir.
@realDonaldTrump The plan you endorse (and probably didn't actually read or know anything about) barely squeaked by... not much of a "victory".
@nytimes Drain the Trump!
@SenKamalaHarris Do you really want people to be there? What is "CST"? Isn't your constituency living in "PDT"?
@SenFeinstein sorry to see that U voted for Gorsuch block. while the Garland treatment was bad, Gorsuch is probably better than next Trump nominee.
@SenKamalaHarris sorry to see that U voted for this block. while the Garland treatment was bad, Gorsuch is probably better than next Trump nominee.
@EricLiptonNYT @CharlesMBlow Typical Trump prevarication... it's hard to believe anyone could ever take this blowhard seriously. VERY SAD!!!
@sharcat12 @POTUS Further evidence of the extreme hypocrisy of DJT https://t.co/jdwxeqoWce . VERY SAD!!!
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS ... or if you didn't keep on repeating your FAKE LIE about being wiretapped.  #notMyDictator
@CharlesMBlow You write great columns - how about one on the topic Tillerson's anti-American treatment of the press? He's no longer a CEO!!!
@CharlesMBlow it's becoming embarrassing to be an American. What a clown we have in the White House (or I guess it's now "The "Big Top").
@donlemon Don: love Ur show! I think U would be even more effective if U didn't try to rebut your guests B4 they finish answering questions🙂
@NPR @JimZarroli Of course!!!! Someone needs to get serious about the ethical violations of this so-called "President"!  #notMyDictator
@exjon @jaketapper Hello. You can NOT trust Trump.
@McCainJack @jaketapper @SenJohnMcCain I'm not fond of all his positions, &amp; voted against him (mostly cuz of Ms. Palin), but he is a HERO!!!
@CharlesMBlow Go Charles!!!
@CharlesMBlow Well, they seem to be 12 years old... #notMyDictator
@michaelshermer What?  Who the heck cares about earrings?!?!
@michaelshermer This is not such a revelation...
@AdamSchiffCA Let me guess - Pruitt says "I'm not a scientist, but...". Would he question medical experts in the same way? Anti-vax too?
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like FAKE NEWS to me...
@RepAdamSchiff Of COURSE it's TRUMPCARE!  Duh!  He won't be able to control it...
@LindseyGrahamSC Not sure I believe that...
@CNN @LindseyGrahamSC While you're at it, you should also subpoena Trump's tax returns. Guess what... many Americans DO care! #notMyDictator
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJudyChu It's certainly a bit fishy that all this Trump-love is happening NOW... #notMyDictator
@SenJohnMcCain Why have you not spoken out about @POTUS' baseless claims of being wiretapped by President Obama?
@jaketapper @POTUS It will be interesting to see how DJT deals with THIS one...
@jaketapper There might have been 3-5 illegal votes, but not 3-5 MILLION!
@RepAdamSchiff So when do the "downright fabrications" rise to the level of "high Crimes and Misdemeanors"?
@theKTB Sorry for the delayed response... would love to hear from you.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @CNN DJT... On the contrary, Sir.  YOU are the SAD one here. It's embarrassing to be an American now. Go NYT+CNN!!
@AdamSchiffCA @realDonaldTrump Actually, if you listen to him long enough, NOBODY does ANYTHING more or better than DJT does!
@bylenasun @jaketapper Why should we care about science? (I hope you know I'm being sarcastic...).
@AnnCoulter Don't forget about all those Catholic priests.
@realDonaldTrump U are one SAD excuse for a Pres. U say media lies, but U lie about things EASILY refutable! Like Electoral College count!?!
@realDonaldTrump You are NOT on the campaign trail anymore! All you are seeking is vain adulation! NOT Presidential. Very Sad!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Sorry DJT. U make a very SAD statement. Thank goodness the media is keeping eyes on you!!!
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm. Maybe it's a disgrace that your Cabinet nominees have massive flaws! Sad.
@realDonaldTrump Sir, I have to say I think you are delusional if you really believe the first sentence of your tweet. Don't know about #2.
@GStephanopoulos @VP @ThisWeekABC OK for DJT to "speak his mind", but not to disrespect Fed judge... and VP Pence didn't answer question!
@VP Dear Sir:  U didn't answer Stephanopoulos' question. How can the President call Robart a "so-called judge"? Tell DJT no more disrespect!
@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan Hey wait a minute! The Iraq War violated my conscience! Why do I have to pay for it? In USA, much we pay for we hate.
@RepMcKinley @SpeakerRyan @POTUS You should listen to the voices of miners with Black Lung disease... are these jobs really "good jobs"?
@AnnCoulter I don't think he's a "nut"... he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate! U should tell DJT "No more disrespect for Fed judges!"
@realDonaldTrump You should send the $3T bill to George W. Bush!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Ponder how U treated former Pres Obama's nominee. U &amp; colleagues stonewalled his nomination. Expect different response?
@AnnCoulter Well, if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. He could have declined...
@realDonaldTrump Ditto for former Pres Obama's nominee. Your GOP colleagues stonewalled his nomination. You expect a different response?
@SpeakerRyan You should listen to those who have contracted black lung disease via trying to provide for their families by mining coal. Sad!
@AnnCoulter Dear Ann... who started that war??? and why???
@FFRF @PewReligion So... how does one fix this? At least one "none' has to "run"...
@RichardDawkins @YouTube Why, I wonder, is this appropriate material for the U.S. House of Representatives???
@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS POTUS must also quit talk about reviving torture &amp; secret prisons. You, Sir, are uniquely positioned to challenge him!
@realDonaldTrump Total "alternative facts" aka fiction...
@realDonaldTrump I'm pretty sure you will NEVER have MY back.
@realDonaldTrump  You are making America grate again!
@SenSchumer Events of the past 2 days make it imperative that every Cabinet nominee be asked if they support facts or "alternative facts"!!!
@AnnCoulter You should post a picture of the agenda, so we can make up our own minds...
@JeffreyGoldberg Reminds me of years ago when the TSA seized my explosive yogurt but did not take my explosive peach.
@pink_lady56 @realDonaldTrump Do you honestly believe you have "God" on your side? Isn't that exactly what ISIS thinks too? Sad...
@realDonaldTrump You are delusional if you think your actions and attitudes are unifying. Ordering "change" in all caps just won't work.
@realDonaldTrump Why would Mexico pay for the wall? It's YOUR idea, and YOU should pay for it... Good luck.
@realDonaldTrump As the President elect, you should start trying to show some class... no more name calling!
@realDonaldTrump Always the sore winner...
@wanderer14 Maybe because for some strange reason school now seems to start in AUGUST!!! Crazy.
