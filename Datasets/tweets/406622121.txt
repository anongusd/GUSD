@AmazonHelp Well none of that compensates me for the money I‚Äôm out due to @amazon selling me a defective product. I know how to return things. @bbb_us @NBCNews @CBSNews @abcnews
@AmazonHelp Sold by Amazon.
@AmazonHelp @amazon Oh great so you can sell products that are guaranteed to work and when they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs the responsibility of the consumer not the seller. Seems fair and legit to me.
@AmazonHelp @amazon So exactly what do you feel like you‚Äôve done to rectify my problem? Your unit that you guaranteed would work didn‚Äôt now I‚Äôm paying more money and taking cold showers. Not to mention the level of arid ness I experienced on the phone.
@AmazonHelp Well I‚Äôve taken a cold shower today and will tomorrow. I have to pay for another unit and pay for the plumber and electrician to come back. You sold me a product that didn‚Äôt work and aren‚Äôt compensating me for it in the least. A copy of the Ts &amp; Cs will not pay for these charges
@AmazonHelp I asked for the supervisor and was told I am as high as you can talk to. My CSR was great and tried to help but her supervisor was awful.
@AmazonHelp Absolutely none.
@AmazonHelp Yes I ordered a used water heater sold by Amazon Warehouse that does not work. The only thing I was offered is a refund for it. I had an electrician and a plumber at my house. Amazon did not stand behind this product that I was sold. CSR supervisor was very rude and not helpful.
@amazon Hey, I enjoyed my ice cold shower this morning. Thanks for the terrible customer service. Best part is thanks to Amazon we get to take cold showers AGAIN tomorrow. @AmazonHelp
Buyers be aware! If you buy a used- very good time from and sold by @amazon and it doesn‚Äôt work, all you get is a refund and ‚Äúsir you can order another one. We aren‚Äôt responsible for any other costs‚Äù NEVER buy anything used from Amazon.
@amazon I appreciate you selling me a tankless hot water heater that doesn‚Äôt work the your customer service manager telling me that all I‚Äôm eligible for is a refund and I can pay for another one if I‚Äôd like. I don‚Äôt guess the money I‚Äôm out for my plumber and electrician matter
