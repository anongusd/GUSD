@TravisBrege @LLinWood @rvierlin The white supremacist establishment conspires to deprive non-whites of opportunities.  Democrats push back against this.  It's not hard to tell the difference between your friend and your enemy, particularly as Republicans seek to paint minorities as criminals to scapegoat them.

@TravisBrege @LLinWood @rvierlin I'm confident those are accurate numbers.  Most Republicans I've met love the Confederate flag (traitors) and they hate affirmative action.

@stacie_orsburn @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin You're showing that you have a bias in favor of whites in these conflicts as you jump to agreeing with the white narrative while denying what non-whites say.

@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin That you're talking about other things suggests I'm right about these scumbag racist Republicans needing to apologize.
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin Hey there's this broad spectrum of beliefs and anyone can believe as they choose.  That's the beauty of freedom of religion.  You're not the first to tell me I'm not a Christian, but I'm gonna keep saying I'm a Christian anyway.  I feel that I am one.

@stacie_orsburn @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin You're being fooled.
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I know Republicans hate the Constitution and can't stand freedom of religion and freedom of thought, but every individual's free to make their own decisions.

@stacie_orsburn @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I'm from a Republican family, live in a town that 90% Republican.  I know Republicans and I know what they are--bigots.  They think their special.  They think only minorities commit crimes, despite that most of them are criminals.  I see the truth.  You need to open your eyes.
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin Again, I'm not dogmatic.  I don't automatically believe something because a church does.  I say "I don't know" to most questions.  But I consider God to love humans enough that he wouldn't do anything absurd or unjust to us.
@TravisBrege @LLinWood @rvierlin Again, it hasn't been debunked.  If anything, at each juncture it gets proven more and more, and more racist Republicans jump into the whirlpool saying "we're not racist," but the truth is obvious that they are.
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I'm not a dogmatic Christian.  My core creed is--do unto others as you would have done unto yourself, turn the other cheek, love your enemy, we are all sinners, judge not lest ye be judged.  I don't speculate on the afterworld, but I strongly doubt that your scenario is true.
@zxqvu48 @ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin It's to say the government does not have the right to force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term.  The right to control what's inside your own body is fundamental.  It doesn't get much more private than inside your vagina.
@zxqvu48 @ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin Again, I have a doctorate, so that really doesn't hurt me.  But it does hurt complete strangers, many of whom might live next door to you.
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin The right to abortion is found in the right to privacy, in the penumbra of the 4th amendment.  If you support limited government, then you understand why we need to have a right to privacy, as government could wreck up anyone anywhere if we don't restrain them.
@zxqvu48 @ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin Yeah, words hurt.  Why would you want to pick on a vulnerable person with a handicap?  Why would you lash out against an entire class of people, most of whom have never bothered you at all?
@ashlag_yehuda @zxqvu48 @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin Yes we are pro-choice and we are proud!  I know Republicans hate the Constitution, but Democrats love it, and will defend it to the bitter end!
@Homestead4Honey @RobertB56036678 I disagree with that view.  I think the government system is as open as we claim it is.  Anyone can run, anyone can lobby, anyone can hold office.  Sure, some are satanists, but that just goes to show that the system is open to anyone.  It's a free, democratic nation.
@zxqvu48 @ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin That doesn't hurt me, but it does hurt people with mental handicaps and their families.  I strongly advise you to learn some sensitivity, rather than following the way of scumbags into oblivion.
@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I'm going easy on you.  I don't want to be a bully like a Republican.  I'm better than that.
@ashlag_yehuda @Homestead4Honey @RobertB56036678 Okay fine so Republican women are child molesters, too.  You win.
@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin That proves it.  LOL
@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin "You're intelligence"?  That should be your!
@Homestead4Honey @RobertB56036678 That's not fair.  I'm sure the Republican women get pressured into things by the Republican men, but even at that you're talking maybe 10% of Republican women.  I think most of them are being held against their will.
@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I don't care either but you shouldn't call people "retard" because that's a very hurtful term for people with mental handicaps.  I've made that mistake, too.  We're all equal and deserving of dignity regardless of how smart someone is.

@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I'm smarter than you.
The good thing about long, heavily-publicized trials about racism is that throughout it, racists will be triggered, shoot their mouth off in public, and lose their friends and jobs.  It will purge us from the scourge of racism!
@ashlag_yehuda @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I disagree, but feel you're entitled to your opinion and that your opinion doesn't constitute defamation, even though I can prove my ability to see and my enormous IQ.
@timetalks2 @LLinWood @rvierlin Yeah right like any racist hatemonger Republican can talk to anyone about the Holy Spirit.  Ya'll make Jesus look bad.
@TravisBrege @LLinWood @rvierlin I am, but I don't think the Washington Post has committed libel or defamation.
So this crooked lawyer thinks they can base a lawsuit around the "liberal media" being liberal, which means we can then sue the conservative media for being conservative?  Republicans think they can be racist and get away with it, but that's not gonna happen.  Karma's a bitch. https://t.co/UMNzNAu03V

@matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin There's buckets of blood on your hands!
@InAquaSanitas_ @londonlaine @LLinWood @rvierlin I've read about it and watched the videos.  The kid even doubled down on racism after he was questioned about it.  He needs to apologize, not go off suing everyone.
@matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin If you're moving to a different topic, then that must mean I've won this topic.
@TkJoMo @matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin I haven't promoted any racism on my timeline.  Again, though I have said racist things in the past.  I'm from a Republican family.  I'm very sorry about that, but when you're raised within a white supremacist establishment, you're indoctrinated with that from birth.
@nopeno_nope @matrigga @LLinWood @rvierlin I've never incited any violence.  You're defaming me!
@TkJoMo @matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin I've never promoted violence against anyone, and neither did the Washington Post.  You can't blame them for what some other people did.
@matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin Yes, actually, I have made mistakes there, but I've apologized for them.  Growing up within a white supremacist establishment, we're programmed to be bigots.  We have to break away from that initial programming, bear up our crosses, and be rightfully ashamed of our wrong-doings.
@TkJoMo @matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin Yeah, he did, and he needs to apologize.  Probably 90% of Republicans need to apologize for being racists.
@rebeccajoc @LLinWood @rvierlin I haven't read about the Jussie story.  And yeah those boys were the harassers.  Which is pretty typical behavior for Republicans, thinking they can get in people's faces and throw their weight around.
@matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin Guess what, though?  Not all white people are racist.  Not all whites are going to take the racist's side.  There's been a lot of progress since the Civil Rights movement, and at this point only inbred rural whites are racists, and so you're actually going to get stomped.
@nopeno_nope @matrigga @LLinWood @rvierlin Your take on this is absolutely disgusting!  That kids smirk said, "haha I can whatever I want to non-whites because whites are in charge and the other whites will get my back," and you all agreed with that!
@rebeccajoc @LLinWood @rvierlin Same goes to Republicans who bully everyone around them all the time!  WaPo didn't print any lies.  If you don't want someone to call you on wrongdoing, don't do wrong.  Even though you have an army of racist trolls who will defend you, wrong is wrong and right is right.
@Michael29561596 @BernieSanders We're both entitled to our opinion, but we have to follow the Constitution in enacting those opinions.  Trump couldn't get a Republican or a Democrat congress to fund his wall.  Doesn't mean he's allowed to overthrow the Constitution and impose his will illegally.

@DeplorableMikeX @LLinWood @rvierlin I've read the articles and didn't see any lies.  Not a defamation if nothing false was printed.
@Michael29561596 @BernieSanders Yeah, if you look at the immigration system there's clearly much more impetus against Mexicans than against white immigrants.  It takes 17 years for a Mexican lawfully because racists put barriers in the path.  The US is a nation of immigrants.
@traut_david @_not_atf @LLinWood @rvierlin I despise racism and that's been his main objective.  I actually voted for Trump, but I'll never make the mistake of voting for Republicans again.  They are the worst scumbags on earth!

@matrigga @nopeno_nope @LLinWood @rvierlin No, the Washington Post hasn't done anything wrong.

@InAquaSanitas_ @LLinWood @rvierlin Can you cite precedent for that?  I'm pretty sure a free press can report on whom they like, so they long as they have credible sources.  A video is credible.

Nobody's disputing the underlying facts, merely how it is interpreted.  Most see the kid as racist, it's a valid opinion.
@3rdCoastAnt @LLinWood @rvierlin Yeah the truth that some loser kid was smirking is what they published.  No lie there.
@LLinWood @rvierlin I know Republicans hate the Constitution but we have freedom of the press whether they like it or not.  Accordingly, media outlets are have wide discretion to publish true information and opinions, even though Trump would like to regulate like the media like his hero Putin.

@meatpopscicle @mallon_lorraine I've heard rhetoric from some that are trying to have a Holy War, and that they support invasions of various Middle Eastern countries to this end.  Of course we know the government just wants the oil, but the dupes in the Republican Party have a stupid motivation for supporting.
@meatpopscicle @mallon_lorraine He's not the only one.  White supremacists are often terrorists, and there's the ones who kill abortion doctors, and hate crimes are often forms of terrorism.  All that politically motivated violence.  That's why I say Republicans are the American equivalent of Al Qaeda.
@meatpopscicle @mallon_lorraine Yeah I'm responding to the insinuation that because someone is Muslim they must be in league with terrorists.  There are plenty of white Christian terrorists out there too, aligned with the Republican Party no less, like Tim McVeigh.
@meatpopscicle @mallon_lorraine That's not what I'm saying.  Al Qaeda is a right wing organization, like Republicans.  Republicans have the same domestic agenda as Al Qaeda.  Social issues like abortion and gay marriage.  Merely saying "Allahu Akbar" doesn't make someone a terrorist.  It's a praise to god. https://t.co/3TLTQlftCb

@NRAHillbilly @KAFosterSowell @TashaLotti @BardsOfWar That hillbilly on your banner is clearly only famous for being "involved in a racially charged incident in which he may or may not be a racist."  Yet he's your role model.  So clearly you're a racist.
@purocowboythug @chrislhayes America is the land of the free, meaning the people here have the right to follow whatever religion they choose.  If you think it's weak to stand up for the oppressed, then you're the one who's weak!  If you hate America and you hate freedom, then get out!
@ZERUBBABEL2 @winstonCovfefe @Sekusa1 I'm a Christian, too.  Preaching to the choir there.  My only point is that it's not Christian to hate on Muslims.  It's not Christian to hate on anybody, but particularly in the case of Muslims, they're our brothers, following the same God.  See Genesis 17.
@ste2112197037 @winstonCovfefe @Sekusa1 Trump banged his daughter, like most Republicans.

@ZERUBBABEL2 @winstonCovfefe @Sekusa1 There are hundreds of translations of the Bible that all disagree with each other, just as the Christian church is split into hundreds of denominations.  The difference between say Episcopals and Lutherans is about as vast as the difference between Christianity and Islam.
@ste2112197037 @winstonCovfefe @Sekusa1 It's more like a branch of Christianity.  Good point.  But Constitutionally, we have freedom to believe what we like and there's no doctrine that distinguishes between what is a real religion and what isn't.  Under the law, Scientology is protected as much as Catholicism.

@corinne_locher @NRAHillbilly @carrolka @Alpha6Phinsider Well there are a few people advocating for that.  There's even a few advocating for giving the death penalty to women who get abortions.
@NRAHillbilly @carrolka @Alpha6Phinsider 3rd trimester abortions are rare and usually to save the life of the mother. You want to talk about performing the procedure humanely, I have no objection. Even livestock is given that consideration, but it's fundamental right to be able to control what's inside your body.
@NRAHillbilly @carrolka @Alpha6Phinsider The answer is implied in my rhetorical questions, namely that it would be challenging to produce acceptable guidelines to determine when abortion is allowed and when it's not.  The state is incompetent. My hope is that abortion be safe, legal, and rare.
RT @catoletters: The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress ~ Frederick Douglass
@NRAHillbilly @carrolka @Alpha6Phinsider What  process do you propose to determine whether an abortion be allowed or not?  You want a court order each time?  Why boil it down into trimesters if the pro-life position is that life begins at conception?  That guarantees 1st trimester abortion will always be legal.

We don't know who's going to win that lottery, but every woman has an equal chance.  Whether the reason is rape or to save the life of the mother, legal abortion needs to be legitimate, legal option.
@sweetlilcajun @carrolka @Alpha6Phinsider First off, liberals are better than conservatives in every way.  Everyone knows that.

But it doesn't get much more private that inside your vagina.
@jlowmiller @Green0101010 @Sekusa1 To me the operative question is not whether it's right to get an abortion but whether it's right for the state to force women to carry a pregnancy to term.  It's not about age.  It's about the right to control your own body.

@realQNN It's got a catchy beat, though.  You need to stop scapegoating Hollywood for perversion.  There's as much perversion in Hollywood as anywhere else.  The only reason someone hates on Hollywood like that is that they're in denial about their own mistakes that they've made.

I am still a Christian.  I can hold values without imposing them on others by force.
@YouAreAFartBag @goatlady84 @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP I'm conceding that I spoke too broadly.  That wasn't what I was trying to emphasize, so you are technically correct, but you miss the point.
@YouAreAFartBag @goatlady84 @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP I'll re-phrase.  The sociological context of Bible times is vastly different from those of modern democracies.  Perhaps Democracy existed nascent in human society in a sense, from the very beginning.  As well, the Bible was written over a long time period.
@YouAreAFartBag @goatlady84 @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP That's what I'm saying. All I can do is analyze the issues on their merits and follow my conscience. The Bible doesn't give enough specific guidance to base our public policy decisions. I am a Christian, but I don't live in Christ's time, I live right now in the present, g-funk.

@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Your duty as a citizen is to obey the law and pay taxes.  Your duty as a Christian is to do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.
@KevinJOsborne @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Late term abortions are rare and usually reserved for medical emergencies.  You want to write regulations around this consideration, and have lawyers supervising the process, and so forth...go for it...all those details.  It doesn't seem to be frequent enough to warrant alarm.
@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Well, I'm certain that Jesus doesn't want me to do anything violent and so I'm not going to.  I guess you gotta go on your own opinion, but I would advise you not do anything violent and that I don't think God would approve.

@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Okay, Osama.
@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Understand this: I've spent my life studying public policy, and so I understand why we have privacy rights.  It's not that I like abortions, it's that I recognize there's no way to enforce vice law effectively without putting cameras in everyone's house.
@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP You aren't supposed to judge at all.  Vengeance belongs to God.
@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Maybe just argue the issue on the merits and don't make it about Christianity, as this does a disservice to Christianity.  Yes, a Christian can be pro-choice.  A Christian can be anything anyone can be.  Democrats aren't welcome in Church?  That's not very Christian of you. https://t.co/PqTU9TEzGL
@KevinJOsborne @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Interesting that you qualified it like that, indicating that you are at least partially pro-choice.  Those lines are hard to draw, I'll give you that, but you're on my side.
@imperfectlyposh @GaetaSusan @POTUS @VP Don't tell me what I believe.  I know I'm a Christian.  Jesus would not have been a Republican at all, because he supports peace and love, while Republicans preach hate.  Republicans are the exact opposite of Christians--he said judge not and Republicans never stop judging.

@Kelly_K_9 It's pro-CHOICE...nobody's telling anyone to get abortions.  Who chooses to and who doesn't isn't up to Democrats.  Democrats have done a lot more for minorities than Republicans, and that's why Democrats win their vote.  Trump has rolled back Obama's progress on many fronts.

@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise Or maybe blacks are more likely to be labeled as such because racist white society is projecting their feelings onto blacks.  Scapegoating away their own sexual guilt, while remaining in denial about their feelings of inadequacy.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise People have the same potential to succeed or fail regardless of the color of their skin.  All people are equal.

@rwfg2008 @nondiscriptguy @China_is_here @SteveScalise You brought up a couple cities with large minority populations.  My point is that anyone can be a criminal, and that from what I've seen, it's pretty much just as bad where ever you go.  Yes, rich white people can be criminals too, and plenty of them are.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise When a person in power commits a crime, if they're really powerful, the issue never even reaches public scrutiny.

@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise There's probably more than that.  Just as whites artificially reduce the appearance of their crime rate due to white privilege, males reduce the appearance of their crime rate due to male privilege.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise Whites are the majority population in the country.  You don't think they get any advantage out of that?  You think the system they built, to care for their sixty to eighty percent of the population is going to treat them unfairly?  You've gotta be dreaming.
@rwfg2008 @nondiscriptguy @China_is_here @SteveScalise Well, white supremacist biker gangs selling the meth is the equivalent of the inner city's drug gangs.  Spousal abuse, pickpocketing, public intoxication...people do these things everywhere.  White people are just as bad as everyone else.  I'm certain of at least that.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise Yes, the white supremacist establishment claims those statistics.  Of course, they would published biased statistics to favor their own agenda.  Of course, murder by police would not be counted in that list, nor would hate crimes be recorded where the hate mob was the majority.
@rwfg2008 @nondiscriptguy @China_is_here @SteveScalise A great deal of blame goes to the culture that continuously says it's okay to equate minorities with criminals, to automatically cast suspicion people because of the color of their skin.  It's sickening and ignorant.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise Sadly, most rapes aren't reported.  I imagine reporting would be very rare in cases where the offender is wealthy, well-connected, or politically powerful. Indeed, you see this with celebrity scandals, but also with businessmen, in the military, etc.  It's not just in the city.
@nondiscriptguy @rwfg2008 @China_is_here @SteveScalise The best example of this would be cases of white police shooting unarmed black men.  This is rarely prosecuted.  Hate crimes as well.  There's a lot of crystal meth and motorcycle gangs among rural whites.
@rwfg2008 @nondiscriptguy @China_is_here @SteveScalise Some criminals are rich, some criminals are poor, some criminals are black, some criminals are white.  Some criminals live in big cities, some in small towns and some live out in the countryside.  I see no statistically significant correlations based on race, class, or location.

@SimonScaryStory @scrappythewild1 The most vocal critics of this are liberal democrats, and possibly some libertarian Republicans as well.  There's a lot they aren't telling us that might explain why supporters support, though I imagine most of them support it for that military-industrial complex money.

@freedom_moates In her defense, it was an outrageous topic.  Ridiculing one feminist's weight does not rebut the increasingly validated beliefs of the feminist community.  You can't answer all that scathing criticism of men with childishly teasing an overweight person.
