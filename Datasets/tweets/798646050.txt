@RealJamesWoods I am. I am a real boy.
@MichaelAvenatti You are a true carpetbagger.
@RealJamesWoods Exactly. I want 70%.
.@POTUS We need influential MSM icons to rally and say boldly, "By giving ill, marginalized people 72 hours of international fame after murdering people, we are the problem." Then champion the effort for all MSM to act differently. It happened for teen suicide. #schoolshootings
@SenSanders Ah yes. I long for the good old days of the United Socialist States of America.
@RealJamesWoods But we’re getting some more Chinas.
@CarlosJLacayo @EdKrassen @KamalaHarris Nope.
@KamalaHarris We’re gonna need some more Chinas.
@mailman221 @SebGorka @KamalaHarris That’s a thing?
@LJlohman @SenSanders Somebody’s paying the bills and it’s not us down here.
@KamalaHarris My tax refund was less, sure. But I paid $2000 less in taxes last year.
@SenSanders Well. A free market in the greatest country in history. How is it rigged when the top pays most of the taxes so that we pay nominal or no taxes?
@SenSanders Bernie, you’re living in La La Land. Maybe you should divest, Mr One-percenter!
@SenSanders Marching uniformly lock step in tiny jack boots. Like good citizens.
@SenSanders Billionaires and corporations pay a disproportionate amount of our taxes so that most of us pay nominal or no federal taxes. Divest your millions, One-percenter.
@KamalaHarris For frame of reference can someone name these scientists, please? Sounds like, some people say...
@KamalaHarris @AOC @EdMarkey I like the idea of funneling billions of tax dollars to solve a problem we can’t possibly fathom. Give a hoot. #Looking4MoreChinas

@BetteMidler Nope. He doesn't sing or act as well as you. And, he is a self-centered blowhard. No, everyone doesn't hate him. We do hate 8 million American kids going to bed hungry every night and being in debt $21 Trillion. Has anyone discussed that today?
@SenSanders Divest, One-Percenter!
@UnknownSqwacker @mitchellichtman @KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats @GOP You just did lasers. So you must be right.
@UnknownSqwacker @mitchellichtman @KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats @GOP You’re kinda warped.
@UnknownSqwacker @mitchellichtman @KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats @GOP That’s a lie that is still a lie no matter how many times you say it.
@BernieSanders Which is why you should divest, white man, one-percenter.
@mitchellichtman @KamalaHarris If you want to bring up dark and despicable parts of our nations history, let's talk about the @TheDemocrats position on slavery while @GOP was trying to abolish it.
@mitchellichtman @KamalaHarris And murdering someone (if that wasn't enough) because you don't like the color of their skin is also a crime.
@SenSchumer @maziehirono @SenatorMenendez @SenBooker @realDonaldTrump That's a slippery slope. Isn't recognition that Trump is using it as a political tool legitimize Trump's claim that Liberals are stacking the deck with votes by non-citizens?
@RealJamesWoods We gotta get some more Chinas.
@RealJamesWoods Hey! She says there’s more Chinas out there to pay for our excesses. And I believe her.  Except for the more Chinas part. So... No.
@KamalaHarris Do you think there are more Chinas out there to pay for all of this?
@KamalaHarris Still wondering if you’ve located the new Chinas to pay for your ideas.
Oprah syndrome. Not enough Chinas to do it all. https://t.co/SLAdN5KfSW
@KamalaHarris What would that self-interest be? Learn us.
@el__ginger @SenSanders Talking points? How about principles? Less federal gov. More state &amp; individual responsibility. Stop treating the fed as a charity.  Stop spending money we don’t have. More conservative fiscal responsibility.
@el__ginger @SenSanders You know what will happen over the next 1000 years?The coastlines will erode &amp; some mansions will lose their foundations &amp; tumble. Nothing we did or nothing we will do is going to change that. If you don’t want to get run over by a steamroller then casually step out of the way.
@MichaelAvenatti You like Nostradamus up in here.
@KamalaHarris Ain’t you gubment?
@realDonaldTrump That rhymes. Dang.  I’m on board!
@KamalaHarris Er? Well I stand corrected then
@CoryBooker Weren’t you stumping for settled law recently?
@SenSanders It’s a billion years old planet.  Climate is going to change.
@KamalaHarris Sure. Americans love a good train wreck.
@KamalaHarris Perhaps your caucus should do something about that.
Just finished the last #Daredevil. Pretty awesome. Netflix wanted me to finish #Punisher. Too exhausted.
@KamalaHarris Sure they are.
@KamalaHarris We need more Chinas to borrow money from.
@RealJamesWoods Or ... the best player on our team.
@KamalaHarris This, Senator, is the true definition of the word Racism.
@KamalaHarris Sure if we had two more Chinas to borrow money from.
@KamalaHarris If only there were more Chinas to borrow money from.
@KamalaHarris Advocate changing your caucus’s message that invites foreigners to come in illegally and we wouldn’t need a barrier to help keep them out.
@SenFeinstein It seems like no one here likes Trump.
@SenFeinstein Fix it.
@KamalaHarris How about, no?
@IrisToyer @KamalaHarris Of course.
@KamalaHarris Those words are great and true. Then we passed laws to control immigration. All anyone is saying is, obey our laws.

@Angelas_Balance @IronStache Not an attitude. We’ve borrowed $21 Trillion and still have 8 million kids living in poverty.
@Angelas_Balance @IronStache You’re welcome.
@Angelas_Balance @IronStache There are billions worldwide. There are NGOs and charities to funnel aid through. The US government isn’t a charity.
@realDonaldTrump I’ve noticed Liberals point out that migrants pay into Social Security but never draw from it. They’re genius. That’s $15 Billion annually. More than enough to pay for a gold plated wall.
@SenSanders How could that possibly be a hardship?
@WebbL03 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I didn’t make up the term illegal aliens. That’s what federal law calls them. You’re lumping together migrant workforce that we need with people that sneak across the border. The stats you quote are correct. You neglect to state the net results. We pay more than they contribute.
@miracletbs Seems promising.
@WebbL03 @RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump I’ve been saying this long before that fool ever considered running. If you think Republicans are drones because we had him as our only choice, then you should rethink it. I cast my first vote ever for Reagan.
@IronStache When was the last time any of you cared about the 8 million American kids going to bed hungry every night? I mention it often. I’m a Vet. I don’t feel left out.
@IronStache No, I won’t be.  But the billions saved when illegal immigration is curbed could go a long way towards those ends.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump The billions we save from curbing illegal immigration will go a long way towards accomplishing those ends. So, what bill did you write to do the same?
@BernieSanders What have you done about the 8 million American kids living in poverty?
@KamalaHarris What have you done about the 8 million American kids living in poverty?
@TeamPelosi I don’t have to imagine. I have a child with a laundry list of maladies and I’ve had to pay double the premiums and deductibles since ACA became law.  Fuck you.

@brianbahouth Not sure how involved with Question 6 that you are. I have some insight that people aren't understanding. NV Energy satisfies most of their RPS now by buying RECs from aging wind and hydro plants in Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. Q6 won't make that change.
@garymartindc I noticed that you follow @CleanFutureNV and thought you might be interested in a fact. NV Energy satisfies its Renewable Portfolio Standard mostly by buying RECs (not energy) from aging hydro and wind plants in Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. Q6 won't change that.
@CleanFutureNV NV Energy gets most of their RECs lawfully from Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah hydro and wind plants, now. Updating NRS 704.7821(1) will not change that fact.
@KyleRoerink1 NV Energy has been satisfying the largest portion of their RPS by buying RECs from Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Utah hydro and wind plants averaging 70 years old. https://t.co/SY2vu4CMRb
@KyleRoerink1 this is not true:		In 2016, 21.78 percent of Nevada’s electrical power was derived from renewable resources, including 8.43 percent from geothermal and 7.85 from solar sources—an increase from 10.10 percent in 2007.

@ChrisCoons The most important question, though: Is Kavanaugh qualified for the job?
@KamalaHarris Not if you wrote better laws.

@SenSasse Brilliant.

@peterdaou Shame to interrupt your circle jerk. That was the single most powerful and revealing statement ever spoken in Congress.
@SenSasse I'm crying. Singly the most powerful and revealing statement I've ever heard. Period.
@RodStryker Didn't see that one coming.
@SenSchumer If you guys gang up on it, then that's less than a thousand pages per Democrat Senator. Stop your crying. I thought you were doing God's work.
Only 112 shopping days until Christmas.
@w_terrence This is monsterism.
@EdKrassen Only tears I shed are from hardy laughter from reading your Tweets. Keep ‘em coming. They won’t age well.
@thebradfordfile I'm a life long Republican. Cast my first vote for Reagan. Couldn't bring myself to vote for him. Had faith that Obama would be better than he turned out to be. If McCain had voted Yes to kill ACA, then it would be a different response only reported on Fox. Truth.
@EdKrassen It’s a fine circle jerk you have going here.  You are all doing God’s work.
@MichaelAvenatti You are doing God’s work.
@PATRIOT56801085 @BernieSanders Divest!
@profcarroll @realDonaldTrump Hardly enough activity for a half hour sitcom.
@KamalaHarris Fear monger and a liar.
@chelseahandler That 'splains a lot.
@RealJamesWoods I’m way ahead of you
@ChrisMurphyCT Not canceling pay raises. Canceling across the board automatic pay raises. Increases will be merit based or based in inequity. So disingenuous.
@EdKrassen You ought to ask for a refund.
@SusieLeeNV Hmmm? He said, she said, they said, then she said. 		Read the letter. It stops automatic, across the board raises in 2019. Instead federal employee raises will be merit based, or based on proven inequity.
@RepAdamSchiff Another 1/2 truth. There are real concerns here, because birth certs have been fake &amp; likely still are. Policy started with Bush, then continued with Obama. Certainly a shame that some Americans may get wrapped into this and spend thousands of dollars to prove their citizenship.
@SusieLeeNV @ASASLasVegas Seems like that is the career you should stick with.
@KamalaHarris If anyone bothered to read the statement, you'd see that the raises that are being axed are automatic ones for every Federal employee. It is not a freeze. Workers can receive raises because of performance or any inequity that is revealed.		More accountability is good.
@SusieLeeNV @NCPSSM Sorry to bother. I read through https://t.co/na0Jp3SIKU looking for actions that would lead to cuts of SS and Medicare for seniors. I couldn't find any. I saw calls for accountability in disability and family leave. Can you point me to the actions that effect seniors, please?
@Acosta Imagine a news agency that reports responsibly. That is not @CNN.
@MichaelAvenatti Or. You could admit your policies are a poor fit for Federal government and go home to make your State and County better.
@sarashelton2 @goossencongress @SusieLeeNV @SusieLeeNV is making a more indirect connection between a FOIA request and @DannyTarkanian.

@SusieLeeNV @ANANursingWorld Did you really just post that you would give favor to a PAC because they endorse you?
@KamalaHarris All they care about is the infamy of their act, that the media is more than happy to give them.

@KamalaHarris Sounds pretty black an white to me. You Senator, are doing God’s work. While you’re at it why don’t you do something other than complaining.
@SusieLeeNV You do know that Federal regulations made it possible for college lending to flourish? The cost of college spiked with the ease of getting bigger and bigger loans. Sounds like enabling to me.
@SusieLeeNV My Mom worked hard to pay for my Freshman year. Then I joined the @USArmy to pay for the rest. Maybe a little common sense, good parenting and personal responsibility would be better than a watch dog and more regulations?

@SymoneDSanders Never mind. I figured it out. You’re an idiot.
@SymoneDSanders Um? Where’d that stat come from?
@KamalaHarris Let me be clear: If you thought abortion rights were in jeopardy, you’d stump for a constitutional amendment. And you’d get it, because most Americans believe in choice.
When they throw all the rights of due process and civility out the window in order to discredit a United States President for political purposes, and this is the result. Then I say let's investigate and scrutinize taxes of associates of every politician. Seems OK.

@EdKrassen @nbc 35,000 Americans will be arrested today. Zero of them take their children to jail. Many of their children will cry. Many are taken to foster care. It's a felony if you're arrested more than once illegally crossing the border. 50000 are being arrested a month. Do the math.

@SenFeinstein The 13 million Americans arrested each year should also be able to take their kids to jail with them!
@HillaryClinton Crossing the border after previously being arrested for it is a felony. Only first time arrests are misdemeanors. 50,000 people are being caught crossing the border each month. Everyone has to be arrested to sort it out. No one in America can take their kids to jail with them.

@SenatorDurbin I'm absolutely stymied. Reshape? You mean even the playing field. MSM is piping the same opinionated message continuously into our living rooms 24/7, 365. I don't even recognize @CNN as a news organization anymore. Used to me my go to news source. Now you want to regulate?
@chasbottom @nytimes Lock step!
@nytimes So it's OK for MSM to continuously pipe biased news into our living rooms 24/7 365, but it's not OK for them to be called out on it? Or, for a message that Liberals don't agree with to be uttered at all. Come on!
@nytimes If the shoe fits...
@StealthTweet63 @ailikeramen @6_GPU_Miner @JYSexton Polls? Polls? How can anyone refer to poll results after the 2016 election? I can’t imagine how any poll accurately represents the rural voters who vote GOP and put @realDonaldTrump in the WH.
... https://t.co/2LkHTN6C8R
@TeamPelosi And the US welfare system has been a categorical success.
@JYSexton You believe all Americans who voted for the GOP candidate are wrong. OK. I grew up in a trailer in Valley Mills, IN &amp; voted for Reagan because I saw the way welfare had become a way of life for other families. That's why I still vote GOP. Were you dropped on your head as a boy?

@SaysHummingbird @DLoesch If you want to repeal the 2nd Amendment, might well take away 1st Amendment rights. How long before government greed would turn against the people if they can't protect themselves from tyranny?
@SaysHummingbird @DLoesch If @realDonaldTrump was the fascist dictator that Liberals claim, he'd be totally in favor of taking the guns away.
@SaysHummingbird @DLoesch If @NRA was everything Liberals say there would be total support for taking guns away. To the contrary, we just want the current laws enforced, instead of laziness and inactions that allow marginalized Americans to get guns and kill innocents.

@SenFeinstein Of course it’s not because of who they are. It’s because they (and others) are likely to be incapable of being deployable. Period.
