Susan Collins: "I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court"
Sen. Collins addresses Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations: "I found her testimony to be sincere, painful and compelling. I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life."
Collins: In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. ‚Ä¶ It is when passions are most inflamed, that fairness is most in jeopardy.

@JohnMillerPrntr I already have! The language is being changed, too. Thank you for pointing that out.
@JohnMillerPrntr I am in no way suggesting that you are. I was unaware of the language that was added to the piece. My mistake.
@JohnMillerPrntr Yes, I see now what you were referencing. My mistake. That was an addition made after the NY Times article was published.
@JohnMillerPrntr The article says: "Prior to the publication of the Times‚Äô article, the president dismissed with a tweet the Russia probe as a ‚Äúvery expensive witch hunt hoax.‚Äù The president also suggested the Justice Department leaked the memo to the press.		https://t.co/tOu6IXgPxA
@JohnMillerPrntr Neither my tweet nor the article say that. What I said in my tweet was: ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs clear what ‚Äòletters‚Äô Trump was talking about," with a link to the NY Times piece.
@JohnMillerPrntr Hi John, Of course it‚Äôs clear the Times asked the president for comment and that‚Äôs how he knew. However, his tweet came before the Times article was published, making it unclear at the time what he was referring to. Have a wonderful weekend.
