@weedlewobble Trump treats the American flag like the women in his life.
Bernie is re-litigating 2016 by running in 2020.
@samstein Missouri replaced @clairecmc with this???
@TheView @BernieSanders I do, and that's why I'm not voting for you.
@VABVOX Pelosi knew what she was doing.
@PFTompkins @SpeakerPelosi It's enraging how idiots like you conflate Medicare 4 All with universal health care.		There are many potential ways to get universal coverage, but hey let's skip over those discussions and settle on this one, particular, poorly conceived plan.
Why did you miss the Oleg Deripaska sanctions final vote?		You could've chosen to meet the women who were sexually harassed on your 2016 campaign the next day instead, but chose the day that coincided with this important vote.		#questionsforbernie
@TPVTrevor The crazy thing is, they think it's going to help Bernie somehow.
@Sludgeycourt @jonfavs 2 years late and 27 dollars short.
@tonyposnanski And a partridge in a pear treeeee.
@juliettekayyem @Patriots Patriots fan here, was never confused for a second.
@TimEBrutus @princessmom122 @DanteAtkins @tomwatson I'm just offering my opinion. Feel free to ignore it.
@princessmom122 @DanteAtkins @tomwatson She should be their first choice, but alas...
@HoarseWisperer @tomwatson @mizmaimee If he were capable of taking input of others, Bernie 2020 wouldn't be a thing.
@HoarseWisperer @Patrickesque @ninaturner Hi @ninaturner,	I was wondering if Sen. Sanders was planning to honor his own promise for financial transparency by releasing 10yrs worth of tax returns like Sen. Warren did?
@IndivisibleNet He should have started two years ago, like he'd promised.		Why should I believe him now?
It's not enough to say, "my running mate is a woman, vote for me!"		https://t.co/YaodZ7cQzN

@MattyB0814 @Bakari_Sellers Let me guess... if he loses anyway, it's rigged, right???
@AdamJSmithGA Following you just for this 😂😂😂
@PrestonMitchum 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Tell me why, in a field of diverse candidates, should I vote for the old white guy who already lost a primary. #NeverBernie #Bernie2020
@EricShapiro3 Then pledge to vote for the Dem candidate if it isn't Bernie.
@RoseAnnDeMoro @beaversandbrush @SenSanders @WinonaLaduke @JayInslee @RepRaulGrijalva @janeosanders "It's his turn!"
@worrld_traveler @TheNewThinkerr Makes it easier to dismiss criticism if he thinks they're all white.
@stoneski28 @tomwatson And she's a Democrat.
@2becourageous1 @SDGoBlue @daveweigel Bernie released only 2014 partial taxes. Hillary released full tax returns for 16 years (24 if you include Bill's, which were filed jointly obviously).		https://t.co/jPXn3pVYnl
@cFidd Depends. Where's your high school yearbook?
@queerBengali And if we have to choose an inspiring candidate, why must it be theirs?		If some other candidate inspires me, who should get the nomination?
@sulmn @DarrenHegemann He's getting stupid, though
@FullFrontalSamB Can we build it with Trump supporters?
@mollyerin62 @RepSwalwell @staceyabrams I'm not interested in hearing the same stump speech from him.

@JustAGurLnSwedn I think some of the candidates will drop out by the time the primary starts and polls start coming out. I doubt their supporters will consolidate behind Bernie so I'm not too worried.
@siano2020 Fanciful answer: Trump		Realistic answer: Bernie
@mcbyrne Very classy.
@PasteMagazine Here again is that bullshit take that only support for Bernie is 'real' or 'organic.' No wonder he lost and will lose again.
@Newsweek Something to remind Nevadans of in the 2020 election cycle.
@TechCrunch So is teaching a human.
@sheamlee @acrunksquirrel @ShutUpAndrosky @sophielstrauss @solomongeorgio At the bare minimum, he should've held these sexual harassers responsible for their conduct after the election.		Instead, we're finding out these guys are getting promoted in Bernie's "progressive" offshoot organizations.
@witliftin 🙏🙏🙏
@ShutUpAndrosky @sophielstrauss @solomongeorgio But you're totally okay with someone who considers support for women's reproductive rights optional?
@mjwatts1983 @notcapnamerica "Black votes are only worth 60%"		😱😱😱😂😂😂

@Twitcheeze @TheToadKing @xedgewin And Boston
@cmclymer @KamalaHarris The idea that she could break the glass ceiling for women and Asians at the same time is a wonderful prospect.
@JillFilipovic If people have such strong negative feelings about Bernie, maybe we should pick a more inspiring candidate.
@Anootchka @PR_twit @tomwatson But now we have the benefit of hindsight.
@DeanObeidallah Thanks for being receptive.
@onesarahjones Everyone in this thread: we totally don't indulge in anti-Hillary conspiracy theories though!
@Lauren_Steiner @KamalaHarris You're retweeting a right-wing publication.
@soledadobrien Bernie is trying to neutralize the base's desire for diversity as a threat to his campaign.		His hope is that voters will vote for him, so as to not look like they're voting solely on identity.
@4everNeverTrump It's why he doesn't join the Democratic party. Doing so would help unify the left but would damage his brand as an Independent, and that seems more important to him.
@JillFilipovic OKC Thunder fans
@thistallawkgirl @TomiLahren Pass candidate IQ laws
@markzbarabak @KamalaHarris @evanhalper I don't know who's going to win South Carolina, but it won't be Bernie Sanders.
@ShootingBlanx @HeatherKDLiv @hunterw He didn't show up to vote to keep sanctions imposed on Oleg Deripaska. All Democrats and Angus King showed up to vote.
@TheDoomsdayGap @JTCK17 @T_FisherKing So jam the popular vote loser, Bernie Sanders, down the throat of Hillary voters instead?
@micahuetricht You're just mad she didn't cave in when all of you thought she would.
@thehill Might as well pin this for the next two years.
@HoarseWisperer @soledadobrien And got crushed by Hillary Clinton.
@ReginaA1981 They will always find a guy they'll vote for instead.
@tariqnasheed @terrycrews Goddamn you're toxic.
I don't know which Dem I'll eventually vote for, but damn Kamala Harris just seems so genuine and likable on Maddow right now.
@tariqnasheed @IanSams You don't speak for all black people. Just look at your mentions.
@aseitzwald "Some people say the political revolution missed the black community. Sometimes, I think the black community missed the political revolution," said Roy Tatem.		So when does Bernie ever have to take responsibility for his campaign's failures?
@CBSNews Misuse of the apostrophe seems appropriate here.
@thehill That's roughly $39 per donation.
@StormyDaniels Hilarious how people try to sex-shame a PORN star.
@TheOnion @KamalaHarris Now do an Onion article about Bernie Sanders' mismanagement of sexual harassment claims in his 2016 campaign.
@TeamPelosi And to the conservative government workers, that means Trump will hold YOUR money hostage every time.
@RepMarkMeadows Every previous government spending bill was passed without funding for a stupid wall.		Why start now? Why didn't you pass it the 2 years you had complete control of government?

@thehill Makes sense, why would you punish yourself?
@HillaryWarnedUs Complaining about a "rigged" primary doesn't count as being mad, apparently.

@vatthepinters @isteintraum I would include some of the far left that voted for Clinton, too. Those people were spreading the GOP/Russian propaganda and act like a vote for Clinton absolves them of any responsibility. Fuck that.
@yashar Can the same wave hit you twice?
@damianpaletta Supporting a Trump impeachment would seem like a good approach.
@pita4826 @tja0881 @fxzkz @DougHeye @danpfeiffer The thing to watch this election day was whether the Democratic shift in polls would materialize in an actual race. Now that it has, regardless of the actual result, we can expect many more races to be competitive in the Dems' favor.

@rdheadmami @suzibleu @katie42369 @suenosdeuomi @ShaunKing @CarolForden My mistake, I didn't intend it as a blanket statement. I was just making the point that anti-science stances exist on both sides of the aisle, though they tend to be more a minority on the left.
@ProgressiveDrey @OWS_ellie @bhatnagar76 @jhall251 @IvanOrnelas2 @ShaunKing @SenSanders Please tell me with a straight face this won't be used against him.		https://t.co/JLy0QyugXx
@sensen2011 @regwag2003 @ShaunKing These comments did not age well.
@OWS_ellie @ProgressiveDrey @bhatnagar76 @jhall251 @IvanOrnelas2 @ShaunKing @SenSanders He won't even make it to the general.
@ProgressiveDrey @OWS_ellie @bhatnagar76 @jhall251 @IvanOrnelas2 @ShaunKing @SenSanders You think his numbers could withstand a general election onslaught by the Republican propaganda machine? It's naive to think otherwise.		Just look at what happened to John Kerry, they turned his military service into a liability.
@gpbhr125 @newsthyme @cjyork11 @ShaunKing I personally reject Bernie because he fulfills this description himself.
@rdheadmami @suzibleu @katie42369 @suenosdeuomi @ShaunKing @CarolForden As someone who works in biotech, the whole anti-GMO movement on the left is so damn frustrating due to their lack of understanding.		GMO is basically a shortcut for selective breeding and carries the same amount of risk.
@ProgressiveDrey @OWS_ellie @bhatnagar76 @jhall251 @IvanOrnelas2 @ShaunKing @SenSanders That was not my experience - the more I learned, the more I disliked him.
@OWS_ellie @ProgressiveDrey @bhatnagar76 @jhall251 @IvanOrnelas2 @ShaunKing @SenSanders You're making the assumption that more press = positive press. He would have been subjected to more negative scrutiny. Just look at what happens to any general election candidate.
@leothe_g @thechadrsmith @Melisrite @BubbaAtkinson Trump's attempt: Schoolkkk
@AkilahObviously Wet wipes are your friend.
@ShaunKing I did give him a chance and he let me down. You can disagree with our reasons for disliking him, but he would be a risk in 2020.		Forcing him on us in 2020 would be no different from when Sanders supporters claimed that Hillary was being forced on them. Try being consistent.

@BaileyPittipat @NYMag And with a full bladder.
@politico @gdebenedetti I'll tear my optic nerve if I roll my eyes any harder 🙄
@politico Yeah, that's the point.
@Ellahbie @MarciaBunney @KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper Then you misunderstand why I dislike Bernie. He and Hillary have very similar policy goals (you'll disagree with me on this), I just can't stand his personality and temperament.
@Ellahbie @MarciaBunney @KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper So context matters now? If principles matter so much, he should've turned down the money regardless.		I could tell you that Hillary was against Super PACs, but they're necessary to combat the well-funded GOP campaign machine, but it wouldn't have mattered at all.
@Ellahbie @MarciaBunney @KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper Every politician has their cult-like supporters including Bernie, if you pick and choose. The wisdom is realizing that they're the minority.		For example:	https://t.co/RN0HJi4E6U
@MarciaBunney @Ellahbie @KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper If he runs again, we'll should just give Bernie the media exposure he wanted. They'll learn the hard way that it's not all positive.
@MarciaBunney @Ellahbie @KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper He has a D- rating from the NRA. Most Democrats have an F.		He's accepted $11,129 from the NRA in the past, which means at some point his goals and their goals aligned, perhaps when he vetoed to strip money from research into gun violence.
@MarkBourrie @TorontoStar You gotta fight fire with fire!
@rjoseph7777 Like Trump, I can't wait until this Stormy Daniels thing reaches its climax.
@rd2xs @smartflexin Nope. He has to EARN my vote.
@KeithCorrra @sxsw @SenSanders @jaketapper He can start reforming the political process by removing himself from it.
@Cholok3 @arisetyo @nowthisnews The ignorance of this comment is transcendental.
@VoteAngryNow Either way, he soiled himself.
@nowthisnews So now he's in the negative?
@AriRabinHavt @jaketapper Looks like Bernie finally learned how to use a comb.
@20to1Devotchka @AnnaNotaro22 @AriRabinHavt @jaketapper If he plans on running in 2020, you'll have to get used to the scrutiny. More media exposure won't be all positive.
@eclecticbrotha Silver lining, they can't use it as an excuse when Bernie loses again.
@sherkatillion @TheBeatWithAri @REALStaceyDash But necessary, in my opinion. These awful candidates need to be vetted, hard.
@TheBeatWithAri @REALStaceyDash @AriMelber She's going to embarrass herself somehow, isn't she?

@andylassner @Gabbiedrice78K Don't forget Hillary. He won the election, but without the mandate he needed.
@TheBeatWithAri @AriMelber I don't think Sanders colluded with Russians, but he needs to explicitly address and condemn the support they gave him in his campaign. His last statement was too ambiguous.

I saw "Clinton Foundation" trending and thought maybe the Repubs FINALLY found evidence of wrongdoing...		...but of course, it's just another Trump Jr. attempted collusion story.
@cdashiell Makes sense, they have to get rid of Bernie's critics in left-leaning media to set up for Bernie's 2020 run - they can't win on merit alone.
@cmclymer  https://t.co/KUtxIRCzQ2
@ChelseaClinton Apparently it's easy to find money for tax cuts but not for children's health insurance.
@JamesFallows Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
@ceelle1 @Karoli @JoyAnnReid It's also because the majority of people of color had the temerity not to vote for Bernie. They are trying to damage the credibility of his critics in advance of 2020.

71% of Alabama Republicans haven't personally dealt with sexual molestation toward themselves or a loved one. The other 29% are those who have, their friends/families, and the police protecting them.

@maggieNYT I doubt Trump has the necessary vocabulary to overstate that understatement.
@thehill However, the total amount of money wasted by the committee remains unchanged.
@JoyAnnReid Even worse, their base will vote them back in office even after their taxes get raised.
@IngrahamAngle I wish I could understand as little as you and still have a high-paying job.
@SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenMcCain  Are you okay with voting 'yes' on a bill that has provisions hand-written in the margins? A bill that no Democrat has read or will have time to read? What happened to working with the other side?		Extremely disappointed in all of you.
@HillaryWarnedUs Fuck.	All.	Republicans.	#FAR
I wonder if Mike Flynn's plea deal would've happened or at least been delayed if Trump hadn't refused to pay for Flynn's legal fees.
Why stop at #BoycottSanFrancisco? Boycott every big city and state!		Remember how #BoycottHawaii went? Liberals were soooo sad that conservatives wouldn't come to their state anymore 😂
@PressSec Did you forget you control both houses of Congress and the White House? Stop proposing 💩 bills and maybe you'll get 💩 done.
@BuzzFeed the gays also cause hurricanes and flooding, so at least it's consistent

Project Veritas actually did expose the truth, just not the way they intended.		https://t.co/7DrDIifV8u
Think about it, Project Veritas paid a woman to pretend she was raped to discredit the actual victims and @washingtonpost, but it's US liberals who are the bad guys.
@peterdaou It's not just you - Democrats and Republicans fundamentally disagree on what social and political progress looks like.
"Project Veritas"? More like "Project Mentiras", amirite???		I apologize in advance for the joke.

@fr_lib1 @builditnow The fracking industry is killing coal, ironically. It's cheaper to produce. Fracking uses dangerous chemicals, which leeches into groundwater.		Too much CO2 has a negative impact on the environment, but based on your comment, you don't believe in global warming anyway.

@peterdaou @realDonaldTrump I'm a little more optimistic, since these thing take time.		Also, I think Trump is actually stupid, he just works outside the confines of decorum, which gives him more opportunities for creating distractions.
On this #WorldChildrensDay, let's remind @realDonaldTrump, @SenMajLdr, @speakerryan, and others to reauthorize funding on Children's Health Insurance Program, which expired 2 MONTHS ago.		This isn't a hard one, guys.
