@Sling what is the point of having you if when i want to watch something you dont work.  Ruining El Classico.
@ananavarro Congrats!  Hope he or she is a liberal.
@WhitfordBradley @TheLastWord @Lawrence @WestWingWeekly Nice one...if only!
@ItsJeffHudson Congrats mate...i am keeping pace with you at 212.
@jayrosen_nyu @joncoopertweets @ChrisCuomo Well said. Giving these people broadcast air is repugnant and @ChrisCuomo does it all the time. It is not good journalism or any kind of balance to offer pathological liars the air to lie.
@ProudResister Me too
Precisely, we have the majority let’s use it. https://t.co/9YxrgaAg6y
@joncoopertweets Completely
@sianoresist https://t.co/39tuKlISKW
@realDonaldTrump So glad you are preparing for your summit instead of watching TV.  Peace in our time, I can feel it.
@brycetache @RebeccaSWH Not as bad as it should have been.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Just another event where trump will get played because he has no interest in substance only the feeding of his ego at the photo opp.  Apparently he does not think much of your judgement.
@GOP And all for Donald Trump it should be said. Make no mistake you as a party and individuals are going to be held to account for your complicity in supporting this vile human being who leads your party.
@Bakari_Sellers @9RedSx @MarkMeadows Well, i do think he is a racist...not a word from him over the birther issue and in fact, with this, he was essentially pouring gasoline on an already lit fire.
@ndrew_lawrence Sadly i think they are right.
@dylanmsmitty I would like to.
Wonderfully expressed. https://t.co/b310DsCbWJ
@RepJimmyGomez @bannerite @WaysMeansCmte What are you waiting for!
@maydaymindy9 Just the regular one and i love M&amp;Ms.
@maydaymindy9 With you...just think the Dems could have done more today.
@bohemiagrl @realAliTweets I completely agree with you but I think the Dems could have got more out of today. Hopefully tomorrow will yield more...People like Meadows and Jordan are the vilest of the vile.
Barcelona getting it done!
@PatrickHaggan @thistallawkgirl Fair enough but I have never been as rapt as I was in The Wire.
@realAliTweets Not great really.  I think the Republicans are getting their hits in and doing so very effectively, sadly.
@thistallawkgirl The Wire
@SuetLee4 @delaneytarr Absolutely!  It was a masterpiece
@ananavarro @KarrenKuk I think white supremacist says it all...not sure you needed to add racist but I get your point.
@delaneytarr Agreed...an absolute masterpiece.
@29Sinclair @DearAuntCrabby as long as we can keep his senate seat...
@delaneytarr I wanted ROMA
@brycetache @DearAuntCrabby I am there!
You go Babs!
@girlsreallyrule Magnificent
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Wow that is a great reason...I am really all in now.
@karensgg1967 @ananavarro Pretty good ones then...
@CapehartJ agreed
@ananavarro They look like they are genuinely in love.
@perlmutations I am in for $2
@trinigurl98 That is what I was thinking...they look genuinely in love and for sure the song will win
@Tristanshouts amazing
@Boys7177929395 Is it that obvious.
I really hope ROMA wins best picture!
@DearAuntCrabby Kamala Harris and waiting for Beto.
@sianoresist Yes.
@kirstenstauffe1 @UKLabour Absolue genius...these never fail to amuse.
@WalshFreedom It is what @GOP has become and they will pay for it eventually.
@WalshFreedom so would you apply the same logic to confederate statues which people find very offensive?
@BethKaufman3 @Dax_x98 ROMA is on Netflix, it is actually a Netflix Production.
@realDonaldTrump There is no chance that you have read one word of it and I am sure it is total shit.
@Ordinary1World @Dax_x98 Best movie I have seen in a very long time. I do not speak Spanish at all and that movie was so good that I found myself not needing the sub-titles to understand the intensity of the emotion and pathos of the story.  Extraordinary film.
@BarcaWorldwide Not much unless it lifts the confidence big time in order to win on Wednesday and next Saturday.  Barca has a very important next 2 1/2 weeks. I thought they could win the treble this year and I thought that they would have found their stride by now but they really haven't.
@Dax_x98 I am going to rent Green Book but if you want to see an amazing movie ahead of the Oscars" ROMA" is the best movie I have seen in ages and I hope it wins big tomorrow.
@marklevinshow @pharaohmau So now you defend the FBI...very nice. The man's threats are a direct consequence of Trump's words and only because the FBI does actually care about the rule of law (unlike Trump) did this come to light because left to Trump nothing would have got done.
@perlmutations @73SNAngel I wish someone would ask him about how low tax refunds are this year for average Americans.
@Dax_x98 You Better Sit Down Kids by Glen Campbell about a father telling his kids that their parents are getting divorced. I dare you to give it a listen...heartwrenching.
@KennyWFDLive Best player year GOAT in every way. He is always where he needs to be.

@siano2020 @PoliticalAnt every day
If this is true about Jessie Smollett and in truth I thought it all sounded weird from the get go then he is a horrible narcissist who should be prosecuted to the full extent. Our politics right now do not need or have any room for him. He sets us back terribly.
@MrsRabbitResist John Oliver and Bill Maher
@HoarseWisperer except that that looks like David Spade.
@CillizzaCNN don't really want him.
@resendes75 Thanks.  We are super proud.
Wow, it is with insane pride that i am letting everyone know that Cadence13 a creator of amazing content in the podcasting space has been named to Fast Company’s prestigious annual list of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies for 2019: https://t.co/9OeIZ2ZTPl.
@CNN how do you think that this is good TV.
@PamKeithFL who did they hire?
@JoeBarri He should trying read anything some day.
@williamlegate Agreed. I don't want Bernie as the candidate but he is the candidate I would vote for him.
@realDonaldTrFan No, it’s them doing their jobs.
@Tim_Vickery Might be a bit more than half a yard.
@resendes75 @guardian the editorials are generally not favorable to Israel in any way which is fair enough but the comments section takes it to a pretty scary extreme.
@LynzyLab I was not a fan in any way.
@resendes75 @guardian If you ever read the comments under any story on Israel in the Guardian they are akin to the Trumps base in the US just in reverse.
@resendes75 @guardian The Labour Party have allowed this to fester and take root and this is their own doing. Anti-Semitism in the Uk used to be from the top down it is now very much from the bottom up and lives on the left and the Guardian is somewhere where it lives and breathes.
@resendes75 @guardian No, I am anti-Netuyanhu in a huge way but that is not it. There has always been pretty rampant anti-semitism in the UK (I remember it clearly as a kid) but today it is wrapped up and disguised as being anti-Israeli but it is quite simply anti-Semitism.
@realAliTweets The reasons are so numerous but one of them is that he is a one issue candidate and the issues have change4d since he last ran and we are in a deep crisis.
@HoarseWisperer No
@Patrickesque @WeAretheMedia2 I will
@NBCNews @lome2us @NBCNewsTHINK should be next.
@JolyonMaugham @meNabster It certainly is not and Jeremy Corbyn needs to take full responsibility. I am in full support of the 7 MPs who left the party. If only there were people strong enough in the GOP in the US.
@imaliveoutthere @RonnieSpectorGS @springsteen @StevieVanZandt @EStreetMax @roybittan better than Phil Spector.
I fully support the 7 MPs in the UK who left the Labour Party due to the rampant anti-semitism that has been fermented by publications like the @guardian. Read the comments on any story in the Guardian about Israel and it is like the Trump base in the US just in reverse
@realAliTweets @heartstring1111 @GOP a complete and utter lack of any type of empathy and they are collectively a party of cowards.
@ItsJeffHudson I hit 200 days today...feels amazing. Hiking, yoga, eating right and I have not been this healthy and weighed less since I got out of the army in 1986
@krassenstein @SharonSharonh10 They better do it and they better hurry it up...this is really serious what is going on and it is what he will do (which is anything) for re-election.
After what he did today it is time for the Democratic-led House to file articles of impeachment. This is a sickening abuse of power. There is no crisis &amp; this has to stop. This man is shredding the constitution &amp; nobody is doing anything. This once great nation is great no more.
@krassenstein @lome2us nothing great about this nation anymore.
@AngelaBelcamino Guns
@notcapnamerica He is delusional
@WalshFreedom wish some of your fellow GOPers (traitors) felt the same way as you.
@Barbaradye921 Raise bloody hell at the school.
@TheRickWilson Exactly where he should be
@QuancyClayborne Barack, please get Michelle to run for President.
@WalshFreedom It really is THE question that nobody has got an answer for.
@ShuttleCDRKelly with you all the way.

@Kris_Sacrebleu I think it is getting too crowded already. I am looking for Harris, O'Rourke, Brown, and Booker. That is the final four I would like to see and then the ticket be some version of that.
@SallyAlbright BTW, I love the stuff you post!
@realDonaldTrump @pharaohmau You are a liar, nothing you say is true...this tweet is a perfect example of all of it. Every single world leader has played you for a fool.
@perlmutations @73SNAngel Well said.
@BarcaWorldwide Completely agree. What has happened!
@SocialBarca_10 I really though Barca would be hitting their stride by now but they seem to be doing the opposite. This is a very disappointing result especially after the performance vs. Real Madrid.
@SallyAlbright In matters that are of more recent relevance his work on Medicare for all in VA is the serious reason to stay. Dems try to appease the right too much. The example the GOP have set with trump should be used, they have no moral standing.
@WhitfordBradley This round goes to Josh!
@thistallawkgirl she is wearing the right style sweater.
@ItsJeffHudson Does not bother me one bit.
@realDonaldTrump That’s because PBO never did anything to warrant investigation...you starting to get it now Donnie!

Hearing horror stories about middle-class Americans &amp; their taxes. I'm scared to death to do mine next week. This is what the morons of this country get for voting against their own interests. Perhaps now they'll start to understand the carnage that trump and the GOP have caused.
@siano2020 Yes multiple times and I hope there is a Democrat in the chamber who will yell out "you lie" as was done to a man who did not lie and had an 8 year scandal free presidency.
@realDonaldTrump you gained one seat in a. very GOP friendly cycle for the Senate while losing in Montana, Arizona and Nevada.
@wvjoe911 How exactly
@atDavidHoffman I am going to yoga during the SOTU so I am taking a negative and making it a positive.
@KennyWFDLive It has been raining non-stop here for 4 days but clearing up now.
@Sammy_The_Blade @Ocean__Dreamer @springsteen @NFL and look what we got from it...the book "Born To Run" and then as a consequence Springsteen on Broadway...we really were the big winners.
@BretStephensNYT @DR9214N @AOC Yeah, @AOC I am a huge fan of yours, think you are the future but you are getting this Corbyn thing horribly wrong. He is as much as an anti-semite and Trump is a racist. These are not good folks and you will do yourself harm by warming up to them.
@SherriKuczeryk @girlsreallyrule "Not for Nothing" alone is a Jersey thing. I love that expression but it just does not sound right coming out of my English accented mouth.
@GOPLeader When you take the same approach about the scum in the White House currently maybe we will talk.
@resendes75 @dani_gooner I am in LA and I hope when they both get back we can all get together and obviously keeping Kenny very much in my thoughts with what he is going through. I think Howard said his time in China is coming to an end.
@girlsreallyrule @SherriKuczeryk it actually is very much not a word.
@resendes75 @dani_gooner We are all Twitter friends. Howard is in China and Kenny is in Scotland currently.

@neal_katyal It was one of the highlights of the game. The first Google ad was pretty good as well.
@Tim_Vickery It’s a shocking game
wow - a penalty against the Patriots...stop the presses, the sun will rise from the west tomorrow.
@krassenstein Completely. Next dem president, first mass shooting...dead Americans, national emergency, banning all semi automatic rifles.
@notcapnamerica @VLanghiari34 You have to consider it in 1975 or whenever it came out. It was groundbreaking then and the book had been a bestseller for a long time.

@ItsJeffHudson Well done. 16 days to 6 months.  You should be super proud.

@TheGobbyBrit WTF...0-7 vs.Bournemouth this season.
@RalphPica @ACMilanMichael Barca thumping Sevilla, Chelsea crushed by Bournemouth, City losing and Liverpool drawing. Amazing mid-week action.
@elizacollins1 @Trth2Pwer68 @FoxNews Of course they do.

@mviser @LJR1626 It feels a lot like Obama.
@MattMurph24 I am all in!
@joncoopertweets @Trth2Pwer68 This is a no-brainer: Don Jr. and then listen to Trump say that he doesn't really know him very well...he was a distant son, only came around a couple of times.

@funder from your keyboard to god's ears.
@maydaymindy9 Agreed. I am watching it now.
@maydaymindy9 I really wish he would go away. make him run as an independent because he is not a democrat.
Congratulations to @Naomi_Osaka on winning the @AustralianOpen and getting a proper trophy presentation and ceremony not like the disgrace from the @usopen from last year. A true champion.
@JackiePressley2 This is an incredibly important post and speaks to the heart of everything going on in America at the moment and the utter bullshit of Trump.
@GOPLeader @Scottt2828 well thankfully you are not in the majority any more so nobody cares what the fuck you think or what resolution you signed.
@resendes75 Wow, congrats mate. Very happy for you.
@resendes75 Where in Portugal?  Good for you. I would get out of here if i could. The country disgusts me right now.
@resendes75 @russv71 he is also the reason a lot of folks sat home in 2016...
@resendes75 @netanyahu We are going to have to realize that we are not going to get the 100% perfect candidate. Also let’s see what happens to BiBi in April. You never know. But I want youth and diversity in the White House not this shit we have now.
@jhgurf @Miduswell elections have consequences.
@IndivisibleNet @AlephsMom I hope that San Antonio having an effective border wall although its 150 miles north of the border and does not have a wall is one of them.
@maydaymindy9 @AlephsMom @KamalaHarris YES I AM.
@russv71 They are not progressives in the vein of Sanders but I am sick and tired of Bernie Sanders and I want some folks to energize the Democratic Party, I want to feel what I felt with Obama and I don't want to feel the way I feel about this country anymore. I am all in.
@TheRickyDavila @SallyAlbright she can drop out now.
@KamalaHarris @CCmateo You go Senator and don't you dare stop running. Get it done and don't listen to the4 noises. This is where PBO was when he ran...and that worked out pretty well. I am in.

@Turnip2020 and this guy is a Native American which means his folks have been here longer than the little brats folks.
@uniquetresbyrn @DonaldJTrumpJr @pharaohmau @GeraldoRivera @CNN @MSNBC @BuzzFeed You support Trump you are a bigot anyone who would write how much they love your president is so far gone from the scale of decency you should watch Fox and get the full dose.  You are disgusting, just like the rest of you MAGA morons, bet you are a religious christian as well.
@politvidchannel @1redcupcake the issue why does the media not make that point.
@uniquetresbyrn @DonaldJTrumpJr @pharaohmau @GeraldoRivera @CNN @MSNBC @BuzzFeed But it wasn't their story and they never confirmed it or said they did through their pwn sourcing.. Any other problem you have with it must be because you don't like Fox News having competition...you little snowflake.
One of the million problems with Trump is that fundamentally he cannot be trusted. His word means nothing, he is at his core a compulsive  and habitual liar who will say anything just to appear on TV and say he won. No deal Donnie.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @pharaohmau @GeraldoRivera Get over yourselves...it actually proves the MSM is much fairer than you could ever admit...@CNN and @MSNBC did not run with this story...this is all on @Buzzfeed and it is only a brief reprive.

@bridget_joy_ @KarsinXXX You should get a new hairdresser
@billmaher what about guns after the first mass shooting of a newly elected Democratic President. That should work and get the right and NRA to soil themselves.
@EndDeportations @efero_patricia @tedcruz I care and I am in CA
@GothamSkyrim @HelenResists Never did and never will.
@AdamJamesM60 @HelenResists @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo This is where the Democrats need to really flex their muscles and bring the GOP and Trump and Pompeo to account for these lost American lives. They were only too happy to do it for Benghazi...times up and now it is our turn.
I hope we will see some Benghazi style hearings of all Pompeo and some others very shortly in the wake of 4 dead Americans as a direct consequence of Trump's policy.
@jefoson7 @CillizzaCNN digging deep into history for that one. If you have to go back to pre-civil war to make your point I think your point is lost.
@jefoson7 @CillizzaCNN Well we will see...the current thing in the WH is simply not fit for purpose and the biggest embarrassment in the history of the country.
@Memelct5 @NBCPolitics Really because we can show you the tape where Tump said he would be proud to set the government down  They don't want to fund his wall and they don't have to. There is no crisis on the southern border it is all made up to appeal to people like you who can't tell the difference.
@Dax_x98 absolutely!
Time for Theresa May to call for a 2nd Referendum.
@CillizzaCNN Come on...perhaps he is actually working out a coherent strategy that could make sense rather than the shit-show we are living in now.
@NBCPolitics and I applaud them for this.  Not one inch and not one dollar. Trump has boxed himself into a corner and he can live with this and his stupid campaign promise and anyway I thought Mexico was paying for this.

@MattGertz @MattMurph24 This is also the perfect time for the networks to say that they will be complicit to spreading lies and hate.
@jonlovett This is the time for the networks to stand up and say no we will not air this stream of drivel and lies. They have to stand for something and they should stand for the truth and no element of truth will be spoken about last night. Let Fox have it.

@KennyWFDLive and you like a typical trump supporter do nothing but vote or support against your best interests. In Trumps America, the health care that you are receiving in Scotland would bankrupt you into oblivion...but no build a wall because that makes so much sense. You are a genius.
@KennyWFDLive Nobody is punting her as the next President, they are speaking about her because she is 3rd in line to the Presidency should our luck change and Trump and Pence be impeached and removed from office, she would be by constitutional law be POTUS. Think b4 typing.
@Yes_The_Real_Me and I am hoping that they will have learned from those mistakes because it got us nowhere.
Let me say this in big caps because it is only the future of the country at stake THE DEMOCRATS MUST NOT GIVE ONE INCH OR ONE DOLLAR FOR THIS WALL LET TRUMP KEEP THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN. This is Trump's "No New Taxes" moment, let him stew in it and answer to his moronic base.
@briankoppelman Believe in The Moment
@AOC Don't budge an inch...you are awesome and an inspiration and you scare the shit out of @GOP which is great. Let's remind them that Congresswomen can dance and Muslim Congresswomen can swear if they don't like it they can fuck right off with their racism and misogyny.

@jasoninthehouse Yes, because he is unfit for the office and you are complicit in all that is and has been going on. So complain as much as you like but that train is coming because the man you stand behind is as immoral as anyone to ever hold the office.
@kurteichenwald she is a woman, she is smart, passionate, cares about people, is well spoken and attractive with a beautifully warm and embracing smile and she will out Tweet anyone on the other side...she is a threat to everything the GOP stands for.
@Jim_Jordan Do you remember you and your party and President Obama. You &amp; your party are such dishonest hypocrites. You would still be having hearings on Benghazi if you could. How is the wrestling going? You are a disgrace &amp; should feel nothing but shame &amp; you will need to own that.

@eclecticbrotha Watch @ActMeasuresDoc it lays out the whole story in its entirety, I am just waiting for Mueller to conform. And this non-US company looking for some help from SCOTUS I am pretty sure is Deutsche Bank...and therein lies the story.

@PreetBharara Yippy Kay yay...
@RandyResist @bannerite Could not agree with you more, I said it earlier, I am so sick on Bernie and his supporters who have not helped. They are responsible for where we are as folks like Jill Stein and if you look at Trumps margins in WI, PA &amp; MI it is a fact.
Watched @MMFlint Fahrenheit 11/9 documentary tonight &amp; wow is it essential viewing and not just the trump part but the Democratic Party part which is not exactly flattering. So pleased about this new wave of Dems coming to congress especially @Ocasio2018 and @RashidaTlaib

@BillKristol exactly...you can this nonsense that easily but the @GOP are as gutless a party as I have ever seen or experienced.
@Acosta @tgordonvideo perfectly suits an acting government.
@jaketapper @AlephsMom I bet he could not name a single one of these accomplishments he speaks off.  And is this guy had any integrity he would resign as well.
@Donna_West exactly...he actually has no idea how to control the news cycle which is a key component of any administration but because he needs to hear his name everywhere he does what he does. He picks a punch up in an empty room.
@BillKristol That is the thing about @realDonaldTrump he is at his core a bully but also a coward.

These are the most corrupt people to ever hold office in US history. Try and wake up. Nothing to do with Obama or Clinton.
@JackTilghman @Pr1nceOfDarknes the eye patches on two of the players suggest otherwise and the point is not who is to blame as such, but it is the condition. LFC/City in the CL, River/Boca here, the sectarian nonsense in Glasgow. That you want to assign a blame is patently ridiculous ...it is the bigger issue
@JackTilghman @Pr1nceOfDarknes it's all ridiculous.

@steveblack036 Thanks mate.
@MimiWill @AidenWolfe I could not agree with you more. I am sure he did not (and Reagan would not have) even recognized this Republican Party...they would have seen the ABA as a giveaway...socialism, rather helping people.
@KennyWFDLive blame
@KennyWFDLive I am not but I am wondering how this will be dealt with, Barbara Bush made it clear that he was not welcome at her funeral (as did McCain) there were reasons for it, he is not well liked nor respected and has been viciously callous and rude to that entire family. Fair question.
I am sad to announce that a man who had a massive impact on my life as a young boy: Justin Davis the headmaster of Orley Farm School where I went from the ages of 7-13 passed away today. May he RIP.
So is Trump invited to the funeral for G.H.W Bush?
@OrleyFarmSchool A great loss for OFS today as Justin Davies former headmaster and  (when I was there 1970-1976 and beyond) passed away peacefully at home with. The Davies library is named for him. He left an indelible impression on my life &amp; he will be missed. . may he RIP.

@hollywoodprogre agreed, a man who believed and lived a life of service over self. Did not agree with many of his policies but he was a man of class and dignity.
@thehill 41st President of the United States.
@h8Wankmaggot45 Totally agree...he had class.
RIP to the Bush family at the passing of 41. I genuinely hope that the Bush family will follow Barbara Bush's lead and not invite the current president to the funeral...the class divide is too great.
@IngrahamAngle Maybe, but probably because trump is too much of a coward to do it himself.
@JesseCharlesLee @MattMurph24 it really is
@Leigh442912 @Susan_Hennessey @tgordonvideo "Russians buy..." that is good.
@TheRealCDK1 Kids, people...it’s all over. The kids learn from the adults. I hear you.
@KennyWFDLive Everything she says in that video is true...she knew it &amp; the shame of it is that Obama did not go public with what they knew was going on at the very time it was going on. He is bought and sold by Russia and its not collusion its money-laundering &amp; it has been since the mid-90s
@Leigh442912 @Susan_Hennessey @tgordonvideo It is not going to be about collusion which is actually probably not even a crime but it is going to be about money laundering and influence. So when Donnie says "no collusion" he is probably right while being 100% wrong, it is far worse.

@Ocasio2018 @helenmag That is what I wanted to hear from you. She also knows how to get shit done
@FeinsteinR @eleanor2600 @realDonaldTrump Long may it last.
@StormResist @helenmag And yet Bob you have voted with him every step of the way.
@britin17k @realDonaldTrump And what is Muellet waiting for.
@Evan_McMullin @tigergrrldc It is amazing and i guess we saw it with Roberts over the ACA decision but i have a feeling that is going to wind up being the moderate conservative on this court. Thank goodness.
Yes, yes and more yes https://t.co/9evg2oCEV0
@jaketapper Sounds reasonable to me.
@MargieChaz @tonyschwartz @jennycohn1 100% agree.
@brlowderliveco1 Mate, I came to this US 36 years ago from the UK, I served in the US Army's 101st Airborne Div. and what I am seeing is the dumbest of the dumb of a country. When millions upon millions vote against their own interests because they like a bully then the country is dumb as dirt.
@MoneymakerBetty @tonyschwartz @GOP Could not agree with you more.
@CillizzaCNN It hasn't been for 2 years and @GOP are 100% responsible for it.
@JasonOverstreet @realDonaldTrump we are in deep trouble because nobody in his orbit has the balls to do what they should do which is to en masse resign. The Republican party is responsible for allowing this country to be utterly corrupted in every way imaginable by this vile human being.
@BarcaWorldwide No
@CillizzaCNN I love that stuff
@screwUitsme @h8Wankmaggot45 We could all shit a better human being.
@GOP you really should be ashamed of yourselves. You are now the party of Trump and this past election is just the beginning of what is going to be your complete demise. I cannot wait...you deserve everything that is coming your way.
@krassenstein @WSTEINHART a leader...he is a traitor.
@DemWrite @rieth_damon I am engaged.
@realDonaldTrump @RealDrGina Yeah, like you have read it!
@realDonaldTrump For: Saudi Arabia, Russia, N.Korea &amp; Philipines. Against: Rule of law, the Senate is your weapon, McCain, McRaven, Veterans, US Constitution and any judge who does not agree with you-you are the textbook definition of a TRAITOR. You shame this country very day.
@Mastermind7864 @dadamo6510 100% correct. New blood please.
@johnpavlovitz @Auzzielvr @GOP totally agree. well put.
@bevjfields @robinta89909237 what do we do about his voice.
@MaxBoot and stay with me here Max...Al Queda and later ISIS cannot have ever imagined how successful they would really be. 9/11 was just the start, the knock on effect of that day has destabilized the entire western world with Putin's help &amp; the stupidity of America.
congratulations...so well deserved. https://t.co/TAAWKFqsDa
@tonyschwartz I am not sure if I'm more astounded at trumps cowardice or the GOP's abdication of any sense of a morality. 2018 hopefully the beginning of the end. We thought 2016 would be the end of the GOP but I am sure 2020 will decimate it. The country does not have to feel like this.
@h8Wankmaggot45 to be sure...he will be making lots of "calls" for the country. Not only he is the laziest president ever he is without question the biggest coward. That so many people in this country have been totally fooled by this vile person is simply astounding...America really is dumb!
@Facebook is dead to me. Cannot believe what an immoral company they were and continue to be.
@RonaldKlain @ModaMags @MomsDemand and lets be fair also those wonderful kids from Parkland who deservedly got a world award yesterday from Bishop Desmond Tutu.
@Bornabrit1 Bullies are always cowards
@Bornabrit1 Completely agree
@AnnaVital5 I genuinely don't know.
@tweetmommybop @OleVetUSAF nothing
@h8Wankmaggot45 and sadly would again.
@crystalline_02 @AUMichaelBrown well fucking said...what a joke this country is.
713 days until we can get rid of this POS presidential impersonator...not a moment too soon to marshall the forces of good against evil.	BTW all those who are disgusted at facebook should deactivate their accounts.
If only we could win Mississippi next week...now that would be something.
@h8Wankmaggot45 right back at ya. Love your posts.
@NewsSnakeMD good
@perlmutations @frank754 first and foremost he is a coward. That is where it starts and finishes.
Is that the greatest NFL regular season game ever?
Everett should have stepped out of bounds at the 1.
What an insane game
@keanothedog @realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri No...birtherism should have been the start and end of it.
@Turnip2020 @Bhuddababe I miss him when I am asleep as well.
@BillKristol @tgordonvideo 100% correct - but have to feel that with every one of these diabolical acts, words, betrayals, they are also losing people bit by bit. The most exciting thing to look at these day is Orange County, CA...if that is not a warning sign to the GOP let them continue as they are.
@wvjoe911 He is not wrong there...but that stands wherever he is. Vile human being.
@irisbreeze so that is two in one day.
@GabrielChauncey I wish he would hurry up
@h8Wankmaggot45 I don’t think so
Just finished watching Last Week Tonight w/ John Oliver &amp; 2 things struck me: 1, the close up of Jerry Brown when trump called Paradise, CA, Pleasure, Ca was priceless &amp; 2 with this being the last show of the season, the world feels a little less safe until its return in February
@TheRickWilson And Putin
@Ronny69max @canadayah @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews ...and it's a short week...so you best be right.
@DogginTrump I wish Mueller would hurry up
@jaketapper so it makes perfect sense that trump would go after...trump would not recognize any of these honorable traits. And someone should tell the imbecile that it was the CIA who had to find OBL for McRaven to go and kill.
watching @BarackObama crash the @MichelleObama book tour interview must by so tough for trump to watch. He will never be that smooth, genuine, smart and loving.  These are dark times and it is no joke @BarackObama WE FUCKING MISS YOU!
@DaddyDaddymac I have deactivated my account until they take some serious responsibility for what they have done.
@bryanbehar Yay The Valley...Love the SF Valley
@maydaymindy9 @rieth_damon He does, he is just a total asshole.
@scottseller PRESIDENT BLOOMBERG!  Yes please.
I am thinking this might be Finland...A Trump supporter in Finland. https://t.co/RVX2aCjsF7
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There is nothing enjoyable about you.
@dylanmsmitty I have!
@RachelG51989499 90 days top.
@Superfurryroo @ashleyfeinberg @OverUnderClover and if I am really honest, and you too...states like GA are not really within our grasp. Doug Jones in AL was a miracle, I will be thrilled if we can top the same with Espy in MS but I am not holding my breath.
@Superfurryroo @ashleyfeinberg @OverUnderClover But you can't change anything unless you have power so the White House and the Senate are the first order of business and we certainly can't do anything as the minority party.
@NonnaSJF @AdamParkhomenko @JrgLaw the walls are closing in...and he knows it.
@JasonOverstreet @FoxNews Must be Finland.
@ashleyfeinberg @OverUnderClover But if we focus on winning Wisconsin, Michigan and PA in 2020 we will not have to worry about it and we can stop complaining about and start changing it. Eye of the prize...23 months.
@MrsCMitch @nana4MANY You and me both.
It just happens to be said...if after everything we have seen from this man you still support him in any way you're the scum of the earth. I won't bother with all the "ism's" that you represent, but you need to take a look if you have any humanity &amp; how you became so depraved.
@h8Wankmaggot45 you nailed it in one sentence.
If your profile says #RESIST in it...I will follow you and want you to be part of my gang..#RESIST and never stop #RESISTING
@djrothkopf @grayan12 par for the course.
@KirstenPowers @JayRodge66 I have no idea why you are apologizing, you are 100000% correct, I enjoy your commentary and I love the way you deliver it...with disbelief at times. Do not apologize.
@WinstonFrank10 She is indeed.
@Tennesseine @JuJuPie3 I totally agree with you.
@Holly_ep @ProudResister agreed not the same things at all.
@EdanClay @CitizenWonk @MichaelAvenatti I wanted to see if it was true...if t was true I was done with him...it turns out it was all bullshit.
@DearAuntCrabby @grammaturtleQ @realDonaldTrump its because he doesn't care. It shows in everything he does and says.
@Helenhs @pauleliza by a human being...which he barely qualifies as.
Thank you to @FareedZakaria for discussing Brexit on his show. It is insane in this country that we only seem to be able to discuss trump trump trump...there is more to this world than just him and his vileness.
@kenolin1 @L3Always did we think he would do anything else.
@realDonaldTrump please read the below and try and educate your pea sized brain. You have no solutions, no empathy, no soul and no humanity. You are an empty vapid human being who cares about nothing but himself. https://t.co/BtPA1Oy4pU
@girlsreallyrule @hansonDigby or possibly create some rain...
@glover_ceo I am wondering what Finland's average rainfall might be. This man is so fucking stupid and inappropriate I can simply not believe the state we are in.
@DogginTrump Precisely.
@HoarseWisperer @jdmnd4 it beggars belief.
In 46 days we will be able to say that we are going to elect a new president next year.
@dylanmsmitty Yes, there is no question. He his the worst human being ever.
His stupidity, his inappropriateness knows no bounds. If he's going to waste our time coming here when nobody wants him, try &amp; show empathy for the dead &amp; devastated &amp; not always try &amp; seem smart with solutions because he always comes across the exact opposite. He is vile.
@julie9567457301 @CNNPolitics going to be a brief 2 years.
@AidenWolfe The stupidity of Dems in this case is extraordinary.
@WalshFreedom And look at Southern California...LA and OC Counties.
@Djamery @GaryNorcal @DogginTrump I was just mentally ready to do it and yes I have lost 15 LBS which is always nice.
@LndaRutherford @GaryNorcal @DogginTrump Mine was to do with a divorce. I started drinking too much to numb it all and realized that that was not the answer.
RT @JKCorden: Holy shit. This commercial. https://t.co/aXewAG5C3i
@ida_skibenes @Lexington_99 I posted something like this a couple weeks ago...perhaps we can dispense with the idea that this is the greatest country in the world now...
@GaryNorcal @DogginTrump wow...that is impressive.  Mine has actually been very easy. No meetings or anything, I just decided to stop drinking on August 2nd because I was drinking way too much due to a divorce and I realized it was something I could control, so I did.
@DogginTrump thanks
@PatrickHaggan @DogginTrump It has been super easy. I don't go to meetings or anything, I just decided to stop drinking...and between that and hiking I have lost 15 LBS...so vanity will always win.
@AnneMorrowCoop1 @DogginTrump Thank you
@DogginTrump 106 days sober
@Kris_Sacrebleu I keep wishing but never ever happens
@DogginTrump Amen
@MichaelAvenatti @WHYSYTENA Go get 'em.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes My fear is that this is going to get shut down. Trump is losing the plot...and he is insane and who knows what he will do and there are several ways that a lot this could end up on Whittakers desk or at the Supreme Court and I don't care for either option.
Today would be a good day for Mueller to issue some indictments. Hurry up, FFS. Even i am beginning to believe he needs to wrap it up.
@RepSwalwell Phenomenal
@tribelaw @girlpowervoter they need to get their shit together.
@neeratanden @CatherineHalfm2 we democrats are fucking idiots. if you wanted her out then perhaps the ti e to do was after the 2016 election, NOT NOW
@thomaskaine5 @WHYSYTENA Idiots, complete idiots.
@AynRandPaulRyan @diva_fr_dallas #Omar
What is Mueller waiting for now?
@freak1ngawesome @girlpowervoter congrats
@IngrahamAngle @DailyCaller who cares what he or you think.
@GaryLegum @tammyinlalaland exactly.
@KassandraSeven It strikes me that FOX is starting to distance themselves just ever so slightly from trump. Could it be that they feel the prevailing winds, that this show needs to come to an abrupt conclusion or that at the very least they need to not be quite so complicit to its continuing run
@Dax_x98 she better be. It is insane that nobody challenged her leadership after the disaster of 2016 but is now...what is wrong with us Dems. if we wanted new leadership January 2017 was when we should have looked for it, everyone STFU and let her lead and embarrass trump...please
@NBCPolitics @TracyMeagher @NBCNews its been called..ages ago.
@gerij9 @h8Wankmaggot45 It certainly could be and its disgusting and very disappointing.
@JoeNBC @gerij9 maybe help in California where they are actually needed for real things.
@h8Wankmaggot45 @gerij9 The ridiculous Democratic way...we eat our young for no reason.
@bannerite And someone’s mood just got a lot worse.
@SallyAlbright they will lose those gains from 2018-2020 so it really is a stupid statement.
@Alyssa_Milano @FoxNews I find it joyous.
@MattMurph24 it boggles the mind...he is like youth hitler.
@keksloo @bridget_joy_ Completely agree
@mmfa @MattMurph24 of course they are...by counting all the votes.
@MattMurph24 Yup...he is a bully but most of all he is a coward @realDonaldTrump
@johnvmoore @PragObots completely and indictments are coming.
@MattMurph24 he shows no respect for anyone...he is just a repugnant human being...and a coward because he would never have the guts to say it to their face.
@MattMurph24 and also proves how much @CNN he watches.
@MattMurph24 This is what he is responding to while being POTUS. The manis utterly pathetic in every way.
Come on Mississippi - you can break this cycle. https://t.co/n3iyuIo5tp
@thehill and registered republican...of course.
@mkraju they could still lose Mississippi and Florida if our luck holds.
@mommamia1217 @sunny7422 Ok I hate him but I seem to believe he was at Ft Drum earlier this year unless you mean overseas base.  He is the scum of the earth and a repugnant human being.
@tiniebeany @realDonaldTrump First impressions and all that...and yours are terrible in every way. Wretched human being.
@CillizzaCNN yup...I will take 52-48 because 2020 it breaks better for Dems.
@DogginTrump yes
@CIAnderson3 @Johh06919209 would not waste the words.
The election last week was a huge win for the dems as it turns out it just took a while on the night and tonight &amp; it happened because of the west. Look at NV &amp; AZ senate seats, Rohrbacher and others gone from the house. The West is the key, no wonder Trump is mad.
@4YrsToday @Johh06919209 nor would I ever.
@CillizzaCNN Terrible idea.
@shossy2 @tunnell55 what is going on...they are hardly punishing us so something is coming.
@CapehartJ @GrammaGaz I cannot believe the dems are going to try and fuck this up...Pelosi is the one.
@BillyCorben @aravosis Good
@kyrstensinema @robinta89909237 Take the CANDIDATE off of your profile...Madam Senator. Congratulations. Very proud of you and Arizona.
@aravosis @realDonaldTrump FABULOUS!
@GrassrootsSpeak No I cannot.
@keithboykin @Bennyvessey What has 4 eyes (i) and still can't see?
@areyou0 to be fair...this is not Memorial Day, this is Veterans Day different premise and focus. He is a scumbag and the most repugnant human being ever but he was embarrassing us abroad on the actual day. Visits to Arlington would be for Memorial Day.
This is QUALITY...so EPIC. https://t.co/wUtI31FwOf
@politvidchannel @bming5 YES
@politico @areyou0 I hope this is not true.
@DogginTrump @suprgrl08347556 They're not their. I only saying this because we would do it to MAGAts if they did it.
@trinigurl98 wow that is English as a 7th language.
@PhilipinDC such a patriot
@CillizzaCNN What his daughter delivers eve3ry single day or when she can be bothered to give briefing to coincide when the president has not soiled himself and the US.
@WalshFreedom Because he is an imbecile and does not know the law...or much else for that matter.
@DogginTrump she will fit right in.
@mkraju CA 48 has been called for Harley Rhouda.
@DrWolfeMD @SoTiredOfTrump @NRA I am going to say...I think that the NRA has really picked the wrong fight here going after doctors who see the carnage of the NRAs business every day in ERs and hospitals all over the country #ThisISMyLane
Toddler-In-Chief eerily quiet since his epic disaster weekend in France.
@mwahmyazz Huge resemblance.
We have to get this guy elected. https://t.co/s8lL2bn12l
Please help elect Mike Espy for the aUS senate in Mississippi. https://t.co/qw55T1KqYF
@HowardA_Esq @Sisterwitch16 you are not
@rolandsmartin she best not.
@mkraju They need to get in it and now.
my point exactly. Vote her out. https://t.co/hVBHM5gQJ6
@davidsirota the bar will be low.
@TheUSASingers @senatemajldr @FoxNews someone could be getting indicted.
We have to get behind @espyforsenate just like we got behind Doug Jones last year at this time. His opponent who is a sitting US Senator, today said that if she was invited to a lynching she would be in the front row. Are you fucking kidding!  Come on, lets get behind Mike Espy
@DogginTrump You are right...we need to do for Espy what we did for Doug Jones last year.
@Amy_Siskind they both late to the ceremony today so I assume they were making out somewhere.
@ida_skibenes @FoxNews they are "punishing" us for being mean to Tucker.
@Boys7177929395 Happy birthday
@EdwardTHardy Long may that last
@4YrsToday @DianaMiller5 What heart?
@Islandswamp @DrRJKavanagh @thinkprogress So what, as opposed to the RWNJ who sent bombs and killed 11 in a synagogue. That is our problem, we care too much about what they say and think of us.
@KwikWarren And this why we lose so much...time for unity!
@LynzyLab See...I have been saying the same.
@SassyKadiK As soon as he gets on the plane
@dvorakoelling Because he doesn’t have his base or gang to back him up
@DavidNakamura @CillizzaCNN Can we have him
@Rick_Pescatore @AnnCoulter it does make them experts on the damage those things do to the body and how to fix the damage. This is probably one of the stupidest arguments that I have ever heard.
@1redcupcake @girlsreallyrule Have they called it?
@GenMhayden @NUCKLLEDRAGER I wonder if this had been Obama what you might have said. It wasn't the rain, he is angry about what happened this week as a rebuke of who he is &amp; he suled in his room, + he needs to be the center of attention and he is seeing his boss today when he sees Putin.
@SteveSchmidtSES I listen to Words Matter and your commentary is exceptional. Is there any way to get more of you and more of the podcast.  Your 17 minute show from Friday was as good as it gets but I need more.
@ida_skibenes @cryborg @FoxNews They are"punishing" us for being mean to Tucker
@dylanmsmitty @williamlegate Maxine Waters
@RawStory @JoyMareeKaine1 Long live cool.
@RosenforNevada @grayan12 Thank you Clark County!
@KarsinXXX He has gone to see his boss.
It's a great point...nothing could stop him attending one of his rallies...but our veterans, people who lost their lives for this country. @KellyannePolls @FoxNews this is your guy...you own the traitor. https://t.co/ShDEqHi8EJ
@SenSchumer @taiping2 @realDonaldTrump Maxine Waters
@Pajjr2016 @ddshelby Obama...please.
@1Pepsy @AnnaVital5 Stunning!
@georgelittledc @LCARS_24 One would fucking hope so...yet he continues to work for a man who is nothing short of a traitor.
@kenolin1 @TGIFrani and to see his boss
@DonCheadle Not him.
@soledadobrien @girlpowervoter Exactly, and you can tell because the writing is good, punctuation exists, no random caps and a smidge of empathy is expressed.
@bjaninemorison @realDonaldTrump Agreed, i am just saying that trump is awful enough that i don't want to give him and his cultists any room to yell fake news.  The man is reprehensible as a president and even worse as a human being...we have enough.
@bjaninemorison @realDonaldTrump I have learned that this photo and speech was not from today but from last year. Dieppe was a WW2 location.
@ddale8 Thank you, Trump is awful enough there is no need to embellish or get things wrong
@rolandscahill Maxine Waters asking for his tax returns, and he knows its coming.
@julie9567457301 Now that is the kind of news I am looking for.
@HotRodZone2K @georgemag @soccerdiva Only if our luck changes.
RT @MrScottLads: @TrinityResists @ShuriResists @wesley_jordan @AryaResists @LunaLuvgood2017 @DonnaNoble10th @debbiesideris @BatmanResist @M…
@apollo6204152 @rolandsmartin @GatorRena @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @RepMaxineWaters What a well made argument, you should be proud.
@LynzyLab With mid-terms gone, with the gains we have made (Beto was crushing for sure) your voice is not only important but its really timely. Imagine yourself on stage with the Dem candidate for POTUS night b4 the election in 2020 singing about your hopes for the next day. I can see it.
@LynzyLab You can and should be a voice for this time, for Texans, for women, for Americans. You are gifted beyond belief...
@tiniebeany again...Helsinki, Singapore...
@apollo6204152 @rolandsmartin @GatorRena @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @RepMaxineWaters she was an opportunist in every way...I always have felt that that was one of the more American traits but I would not call her a dog.
@TheLauraAbernat @Vox_Democracy @ParkerMolloy @NikkiMcR @Ocasio2018 Agreed.  She cannot take any type of hand out or donation. She has to wait...now she could get a loan, that would be different I think.
@Khanoisseur @42Lives it is like he was talking to trump
@thehill This is not news, she has been leading since early yesterday.
@BeSeriousUSA @Juliethewarrior but people kneeling for the national anthem is the problem...the man is a national disgrace.
@ForecasterEnten @SherriKuczeryk It is awesome!  My only question is how doe sit take AZ this long to count only 85% of the vote. I think John McCain would be pleased.
@apollo6204152 @rolandsmartin @GatorRena @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @RepMaxineWaters No, I haven't and while I think she made a bad decision going to work for the toddler in chief I think she is an intelligent and attractive woman. To each his own opinion.
@billyeichner @SherriKuczeryk and the time is right...you can see how rattled trump is...we have to keep the pressure on and while I did not think it at first I do believe that one of the first things the Dems need to do in Jan is impeach him. He is so rattled that Maxine Waters is coming for his tax returns.
@billyeichner @SherriKuczeryk I was just thinking all of what you have just said and i want to start now and i want people to tell me how i can start to help for 2020 NOW. Tuesday was good, better than we thought it would be earlier in the evening but there is not a moment to waste.
@JustClaudia3 @SherriKuczeryk @POTUS He likes the company.
@rolandsmartin @GatorRena @realDonaldTrump @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Yamiche @RepMaxineWaters and called Omarosa a dog.
@krassenstein SO on Tuesday night I didn't think that the first thing that the Dems should do in January is impeach trump. But the Whitaker issue makes it without question the most important thing to do. #ImpeachTrump
@GeorgeTakei @SherriKuczeryk To be sure...
@Stonekettle @JimDixon266 Precisely.
@StormyDaniels Interesting you ask that...his last two tweets about the fires have clearly not been written by him. They are well written, display empathy and thank those who are helping. Clearly not written by trump, not kidding.
@LynzyLab Not much more for me to say about you...you are awesome.  You need to put your own stuff out...think Lenny Bruce, Bob Dylan...
@jennifersterger That is the same as Lucy...
Bill Maher refers to Whitacker " as the guy who flipped in Full Metal Jacket."
@joncoopertweets I would not waste a letter from the alphabet on him.
@mariashriver @robinta89909237 Exactly.  Looking forward to your podcast.
anyone actually believe that Trump actually wrote this.
@TranslateRealDT No question...everything about it suggests that Trump had nothing to do with it.
@jennifersterger how big in terms of weight? My Lucy could use a sibling since my divorce.
@jonathanweisman @Manoncamelshump he is right
@HotRodZone2K @georgemag @soccerdiva I know, if we could just tilt the earth a bit we would be fine.
One photo says it all... https://t.co/vOkMCe3awj
@GenMhayden Hope he kept dry...
@TVietor08 Can you imagine if Obama did this...
Makes you wonder if the real purpose for trumps visit to France is actually its performance review time with his boss tonight at a dinner at the Musee D'Orsay where Putin will be in attendance.
@HarleyRouda Congratulations...well deserved
@Alyssa_Milano Hope it all works out.
@Bakari_Sellers Clearly not up for the job
@KarenChestney But at least he is staying dry.
@HoarseWisperer @shar76 What a great photo.
Couple quick ones for peeps on the right:  how is the caravan? Also what do you think you might have said if Obama went to France for Armistice Day and stayed in his hotel due to the rain. I am thinking those bone spurs must be acting up again. What a national embarrassment.
@TheRickWilson What a total pussy trump is.
Trump having dinner at the muse d’orsay...what a waste. Best museum in the world and he would not appreciate any part of it.
@PatrickHaggan @kathygriffin he couldn't tell an armistice from an armament.
@julie9567457301 Rohrbacher free now to go and buy that dacha on the black sea...that is where his allegiances were anyway.
@julie9567457301 This is a great win. I went to a fundraiser in May/June in Brentwood and got to meet him and you could tell he had a purpose about what he was doing.
@trcfwtt Yup.  Right, bed time for me.
I am pleased to let everyone know that President Bartlett has been found on Zuma Beach in Malibu.
@trcfwtt screaming at the ocean
@Motherpriestess @kathygriffin I have no problem with anything that France is doing to celebrate Armistice Day, I do have a problem with POTUS not being on US soil honoring our veterans which I happen to be.
@trcfwtt forget him as a president he is just the most awful human being. He is utterly soulless with zero moral compass.
@trcfwtt I think I will get them both as audiobooks and listen to them as I hike every day with my dog.
@trcfwtt NE Alabama...that has got to be some red country there. Not sure I could do that.
@Motherpriestess @kathygriffin I would bet quite a lot that this time yesterday he would not have associated the term armistice with WW1.
@trcfwtt I genuinely cannot even remember dial-up
@trcfwtt I am so pleased to hear that. he was a great President under extraordinary circumstances and a racist GOP congress from 2010 on. He is honest, full of class, family man and the ACA will go down as one of the greatest acts of our lives and you can tell by how much the GOP hate it.
@kathygriffin I was just going to use that word. Love that word!
@kathygriffin FFS did he just google WW1 and that’s what he came up with.
@trcfwtt Obama... he is one of the two biggest hero’s in my life.
@trcfwtt Correct, they tied it all to the debt ceiling at a time when they pretended to give a shit about deficits, they didn’t then sndcsure as hell don’t now and they blamed it all on Obama.
@chucktownreg @MWave1 @ChrisCuomo I think that is just a given...
@trcfwtt And the reason the military budget decreased during those years was because of the GOP forced and imposed sequester. These folks are disgusting.
@Cfcharv Looks like the apocalypse at the moment...shockingly awful. Desperate for folks up there.
@Cfcharv Thousand Oaks?
@Cfcharv Thanks.  I am OK but it is very serious business a few miles up the road. Entire towns being leveled and destroyed. It is heartbreaking.
@williamlegate this is great.
@kingshockeygirl @1redcupcake @CNN @MSNBC well said and 100% correct. Talk about an east coast bias.
@yourauntemma @Teddyshouse2II well put and obviously since the election he has no0 reason to be holding the sycophantic rallies and that is a lot of it.
so imagine the mood at the WH on Tuesday night. Early numbers showed the GOP having a decent night but from about 9pm PT the numbers across started to shift as more &amp; more ballots were counted &amp; it hasn't stopped. That is why toddler in chief is so incredibly angry.
@mmpadellan and we won more than we think...the dems numbers came in later in the evening
@scissors976 @ChrisCuomo @RepMattGaetz @kayleighmcenany @CNN I think she sided with Nazi's in some article, or interview and they dumped her. Certainly she ran true to form.
@scissors976 @ChrisCuomo @RepMattGaetz it pains me that he keeps having this guy on...
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo pretend it isn't, and that I am not making the cogent argument you deem appropriate due to 60k Twitter followers but I am not with you mate. The hate that is being spewed is real and it doesn't much matter which side its coming from when innocent people are getting killed.
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo Faux News repeated it to reporters outside the Trump rally in WI.  That is the argument and I am not really awfully concerned if you are being condescending...but tome that comes out of this president ands that network is what got 11 people killed in Pittsburgh and you can
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo totally lost is that folks like yourself think that people like me on the left think what is going on outside Carlson house is great as long as it is directed at the right and people we disagree with. You would be wrong. They called it a liberal hoax and then folks who watch
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson So lets approach this from another POV: can you provide with any evidence that the 3 Faux News prime-time hosts conveyed any view that these were anything other than a "liberal hoax." Carlson mocked Soros over it only to cry foul now. My original point that you seem to have
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo But blaming Obama and Clinton seemed the thing to do on the day...oops!
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo of explanation and certainly no apology or admission that they got it wrong because they could never admit that the hate that emanates from the right and specifically this president has consequences that we then saw 2 days later in Pittsburgh.
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo quite to the contrary, it was the primetime lineup at the ultimate fake news network who with scorn and derision thought the bombs sent were a big liberal "hoax" until of course it turned out that some muppet driving around in a white van was the culprit and after that not a word
@daniel_barrett @ItsJeffHudson @wesley_jordan I did...last 3 days have been even tougher but excited to see 100 on my day counter tomorrow.
@MWave1 @chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo Excuse me, he was one of a cadre of Fox hosts who were convinced that these folks had sent themselves the bombs to make trump look bad. Not a word from any of them after it tuned out to be the lunatic in FL. Just saying.
@SallyQYates @jimlu Perhaps you should run for office.  PLEASE
@ItsJeffHudson @wesley_jordan Congrats...I am 99
@Ninopjetri couldn't get the support. He came into office with a wave of red state democrats who would not back it. I will say one thing for Rs they hold the party line, Ds don't.
15 House Republicans with A NRA ratings lost on Tuesday. All 15 were replaced by Democrats with F NRA ratings.
@jonfavs @MattxRed @MomsDemand @Everytown @AMarch4OurLives That is amazing news.
From Fryman Canyon this morning... https://t.co/kgd9a8Mq8F
OK so a couple of weeks ago I went from 60k followers to 90k followers in a. day and in the last 24 hours I have gone back to 60K.  Good evening Moscow, hope all is well.
@Oman187 one might hope.
@KennyWFDLive You completely miss the context of the question...so never mind. There is an irony to the question based on everything else that is going on and it would make for fine theater and some comedy if a WH reporter did follow up with that question, one he would not be anticipating.
@brianefallon Indeed!
A thought...is there a single GOPer out there who just won election or reelection this week who even if Trump were to win re-election  in 2 yrs has the balls to stand up for the constitution. If you won this week you have 6 yrs and would not have to worry about Trump either way.
@ChrisCuomo With zero intent of doing anything about the problem.
True celebrity sitting...just got my haircut at Rudy’s barbershop in Studio City and in the chair next to me was Steve Carrel. Super nice guy.
Question I would love to ask Trump in front of the entire White House press corps and the world “Mr President, if I may a quick follow up- do you still have those bone spurs in your foot?”
You Democrats in AZ, FL and GA do not concede, do not give up, get dirty, get lawyers do whatever you have to do to make sure that every vote is counted. Even if you lose, at least make sure that every vote is counted.
The thing about the mid-terms being over is that I am now stuck and saddened with the realization that this is where we are at for the next 2 years...we know how bad it has been and it looks like it is going to be even worse moving forward...total assault on the free press.
@Bornabrit1 been thinking the same thing. Ask him what the armistice is...I am certain he would not know.
@ava @AlexCHAFD and so perhaps now we can dispense with the myth that this is somehow the greatest country in the world. It is just full of criminals and frauds who claim faux patriotism to get their own way with no regard for justice or rule of law.
@TeaPainUSA @Teddyshouse2II maybe get susan collins to betray the world again.
@TeaPainUSA @Teddyshouse2II Yeah good luck with that...and then yes he will vote against it.

Is anyone else getting the vibe that Don Jr is about to get indicted tomorrow?  I am reading it but not sure where it is actually coming from. Don't get me all excited if this is not happening.
@GregAbbott_TX @benshapiro Turn it blue.
@jaketapper Unless you are Radiohead and then its Weird Fishes.
@chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo I do find that a bit rich from folks who support this president and all he endorses...also I find it interesting that the very person we are discussing here thought it laughable when George Soros was sent a bomb 2 weeks ago...criminal is criminal.
@MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you serious? Is this happening?
@chucktownreg @ChrisCuomo what I found insane about folks on the right is that they think people on the left think this behavior is OK depending on who it's directed at. We do not, and in that thought pattern alone is the problem. Criminal is criminal...what is difficult about that!
@LynzyLab @Pink We need you, your thoughts your wit and your music...we need you so badly the way a guy pulled up to Springsteen on a NJ street after 9/11 and saId 'we need you Bruce" and he gave us The Rising.
@SaysHummingbird @PoliticalDoggy while I hope you are right...you don't get too many leaks out of the Mueller team so not sure where this is coming from, again I hope you are right.
@GeorgeTakei @pghdrew apparently a lot more and probably not until someone i9n the government loses someone to this type of act will anything at all be done. We have no national soul.
@LynzyLab Wow you are so talented...hope you will put an album out...I will buy it. Please don't stop.
@cantchgusername @joncoopertweets says who?
@SaysHummingbird Believe it when I see it
@itsdlevy @MaxBoot This has to happen across the US.
@MaxBoot Right on Max, but you know it will never happen. The rule of law in the US is finished...let that settle over you for a little while because it is true. The difference between Watergate and now is then you had Rs who cared and no FOX News.
@DanRather @amyklobuchar That is if we still have a country by then
so, bars, concerts, clubs, churches, synagogues, schools, universities, theaters, yoga studios...what am I missing in terms of places where Americans cannot go and feel safe from mass-shootings. This country is finished, it has no soul of any kind.
@DanielW8080 Me too.  Our country has gone and its not coming back any time soon.
he has just done some things with the AG that means that the rule of law in this country is no longer important. We are in fact in a worse position right now than we were 2 days ago...the very future of this country hangs in the balance. Grim days ahead.
So we are two days from the mid-terms and the Democrats won the house but i think it is safe to say that we have never been closer to the precipice than we are right now. The President was up to some nefarious stuff b4 his election, he knows it, we know it, Mueller knows it and
@mmfa a misstep?  It is straight up fraud, lies and dishonesty. OMG lets call it what it is.
@PollingAmerica @KikiAdine do both.
@WalshFreedom @mydoggyruss @Acosta actually, he is just a journalist doing his job in an environment where even that in this country makes people martyrs. You should be more outraged.
@WhitfordBradley Yup just like everyone did with North Carolina

@jaketapper @SenDougJones and hew will probably win it back.
@krassenstein @mooshypie I keep reading that but I don't see any evidence of it
This is why the idea of halting an investigation until after an election, any election is such utter folly. The truth is the truth is the truth...what does it matter when it comes out. We play their games for some reason and it always costs us.
@sahilkapur makes me feel good that GOP gave up a senate seat for sessions.

@stalban4u @tiniebeany Not a bad one but I think @AndrewGillum is the better choice.
@DaveO66 @PatrickHaggan @BetoORourke George W Bush had a DUI. In this day and age...you get him o really on the national stage, a 50 state strategy...youth youth youth.
@PatrickHaggan @BetoORourke I think so 2 years on...I think he will represent and look like the future against a 74 years old blow-hard. You put Gillum on the ticket and then you investigate Trump to the ceiling and see what Mueller come sup with. Embroil Trump in sleaze.
@nedprice @CFraase @DevinNunes YES
@Robert_Luna316 @lauvc8 President in 4 years
@tonyposnanski @WinstonFrank10 Beto/Gillum in 2020

@CapitalY1 @AndrewGillum Beto/Gillum 2020
@LouiseMensch @lovcen1900 @realDonaldTrump How about we just investigate and show him for what he is because we will never get a conviction in the senate.
@julie9567457301 why...we want them and they are 2 years overdue
@D_Love We have ourselves a candidate.
2years from now we'll look @BetoORourke losing TX &amp; be grateful  as he gets to 270 electoral votes-mark my words. If he had won TX he had committed to serving all 6 years, now he doesn't have to but at least the next 6+ years of his life are mapped out. 2 to run 4+ as POTUS
OK, Beto can start running for President. BETO 2020

@CillizzaCNN yeah but it has already aired over 10 times so good luck with unseeing that.
@realDonaldTrump what is this a PSA from our beloved President.
@DearAuntCrabby I am, but sadly it is really unlikely.

Don’t boo, VOTE! If you decide to simply not vote because it’s too hard, or you can’t find the time or any other horrible excuse then you don’t get to complain.  This is in our hands and now it’s up to us. 1 day,
Don’t boo, vote!  Two days...it really is in our hands...are we going to take it.
@steveblack036 Its a decent starting point in looking at why we need to make huge changes. We are a soulless, dishonest and bigoted country under this man and any success he gets on Tuesday will only embolden him.
No reason to not be able to get to the polls to vote https://t.co/qsGwPMunOy
@MattMurph24 but as Jeff Tobin just said why does Trump run on lies about a fake invasion rather than tell the truth about the thriving economy...that is how sick he is.

Where is the Democratic leadership up in arms about what is being said...where is there any type of collective leadership from the left.  This is why we lose.

@RonanFarrow @TheRickWilson Unbelievable.

@DodgersNation with good reason.
@synergy05 @chuzalong @FoxNews @POTUS Say what you like but he first instinct was to claim that the synagogue should have had armed guards until someone gave him something to read from a teleprompter. So that is churches, synagogues, concerts, clubs...oh and schools should all be armed.

They are starting to hit Rich Hill a little too hard...warning sign.
@PatrickHaggan I hope so.
@DodgersNation its not even that...a man on 1st nobody out and they cant even get him to 2nd. They just don't manufacture runs which I think is why they will not win this World Series. They are playing a team that does just that and executes with 2 outs.

OK everyone...what are my options tomorrow for el Classico now that there is no longer beIN sports on DirectV?
@DodgersNation wish he could pitch again tonight, Rich Hill does not fill me with confidence.
@aravosis wonderfully stated.
@TheUSASingers None whatsoever.
@JenTusch @KarsinXXX I agree with you wholeheartedly and I am also a Jew who loves Israel but this is beyond anything in that realm. Hate is hate.
@TheRickWilson well said.
@llewcalderon21 @Dodgers and that tweet was written wither 2 hours to go in the game.
12 Pipe bombs, two African Americans shot and killed at a Kroger Market in KY and now 8 dead at a synagogue in Pittsburgh...but lets not call this what it is: domestic terrorism and a political, racial and cultural war from the right.
@DeanObeidallah @MiltShook he would attend...its  not about the tragedy or the numbers it is that he needs to feel adored at all times.  This is why he is SO dangerous. The country does not come first, his family doesn't, he does and only him.
This is all domestic terrorism..this entire week...amazing that trump will not mention the word. Could not criticize Obama more when it suited him then.
@KristenLedlow no but it does continue at 5pm
@briankoppelman and BTW I like your podcast very much (maybe not the time) and I sell it for Cadence13.
@briankoppelman he is complicit it in all of it. This blood is on his hands.
Don't boo, Vote! 10 days...10 important days vital to the survival of this republic. Dont believe, me take a look at this week &amp; the lack of any responsibility taken by a man with the title of president but can't assume the mantle &amp; the GOP who have no shame &amp; are utter cowards.
@MaxBoot You and me too.
@JeffFlake This indignation from you means little at this time. You have voted for him and his agenda...it really is a bit too late to pretend you are not complicit. You are either with him or against him and your voting record suggests you are with him, exhibit A Kavanaugh.
@DodgersNation and got to start manufacturing runs in all fairness. Homers are great but would be nice to have both.
@SaraUnderwood stunning.
@goal going to bed.
@ChrisMurphyCT Go get them @ChrisMurphyCT
@Boys7177929395 Yes he does!
Got to say that this was one of the best and funniest twitter nights ever #WorldSeries18 #WorldSeries
@MattMurph24 Yes but if that is what it takes to win a game at home might not be alive for long. Go Dodgers!
Thank God.
I've taken my ambient so this needs to end soon otherwise I will start cooking food and walking the dog.
Bet you're all loving extra-time and penalties now.
@DR9214N They ran the same two Carls Jr ads in the same break.
The game just hit the 7 hour mark.
@BittrScrptReadr @WhitfordBradley 7 hours.
@DanWoikeSports I have been waiting for this...classic. EPIC!
@Foxhoundx12345 @Fieryreddragon Quality.
@Bakari_Sellers @EEMKing1 Now.
Nunez auditioning to be baseball's Neymar.
@DodgersBeat please for the love of a good nights sleep do it now.
@DodgersNation Nice pitching.
@Nick_NE That is actually a good shout especially if there was an early game this weekend.
@HoarseWisperer @kittyFitz50 @MSNBC The fact that they hired him a fucking disgrace. Nothing but hatred and lies.
@perrysachs @Boys7177929395 Quality!  That is epic!
If you are still watching this game on the east coast I salute you.
@Jessica_Whitney @MorningPint and hours...
Feeling that Bellinger might have something to say about this game...
@TwocanSam4 That is very funny!  Good one.
@DodgersNation He is not our guy.
@deweyd Game now over 6 hours.
@deweyd Good one!
@deweyd yeah. but cricket had the good sense to reinvent itself with ODIs and 20/20 cricket...cant see baseball ever having that kind off imagination. I love test cricket as well BTW
I do love the MLB playoffs but 5 1/2 hour games are ridiculous and not sustainable in the long run to hold on to viewer and bring new viewers to the game.
This is where we are... https://t.co/HJQQA5TzQu
@RandyRainbow excellent
It is tough to deny that this Boston Red Sox team are really good in almost every department especially hitting with 2 outs. Just insanely good! Go Dodgers!
What @TheRickWilson is saying right now.  Correctly ompares Trump and Maga to Islamic clerics radicalizing young islamic men and how we have always been super quick to scream about that. @GOP have you no shame.
always with 2 outs.
@JacksonLeeTX18 @SusanCarver19 @HillaryClinton and Madam President.
@JaimeACardenas @ajrod and the game.
@ChrisCuomo Don't complain..you continually have these people on your show allowing them to spew and limit this narrative of hatred. At some point you also become complicit. I don't care if you have dinner with these folks...don't put them on your air, that is why they have Fox.
@ajrod @JaimeACardenas He is superb tonight...what a job by a rookie, utter masterclass. Now take him out and close this game out.
Dont boo, vote!  11 days...it has never ever been more important...the future of this country literally depends on it.
@JuddLegum @WinstonFrank10 and why is @MSNBC having someone as awful as Hugh Hewitt on. Why does CNN and MSNBC give these people the oxygen to breed their hate. They have Fox, that is enough. I am not interested in what they have to say and this is why we lose because we give them oxygen.
@ndrew_lawrence yeah @Seanhannity it is all the lefts fault, you disgusting POS.
@smoltz_john You are an extraordinary commentator, you teach me so much about baseball but there is no such word as irregardless...regardless means exactly the same thing. Please keep up the great work...you are exceptional in the booth as you were on the mound.
What are these folks so angry about?  They have The White House, Congress, and now SCOTUS...what are they so angry about...for the last 2 years they have won. This is radicalization by Trump and he bears full responsibility for this. This country has got to wake up.
@Bornabrit1 And what blows my mind is what are they so angry about...they have the White House, Congress and the Supreme Court...what else do they want. For now or at least the last 2 years they have won...what are they so angry about
@ellievan65 Too little too late
EXACTLY! https://t.co/n1xon8QItH
BTW, some credit to Sessions for at least having a relationship with the rule of law but remember this is the president is the one who has done nothing but denigrate the FBI who wrapped this up pretty damn quickly.
@Malfazbruce Love that city. Got to get back there.
@LouDobb @seanhannity and @GeraldoRivera, while I would never consider you journalists you spoke to your audiences last night and flat out lied and tried to seem like this, was all a hoax. Will you apologize?
@PatrickHaggan @ActMeasuresDoc @LouDobbs @seanhannity @GeraldoRivera Hopefully, some people will fucking wake up but I doubt it.
Talk about a guy obviously voting and brainwashed against his best interests: 56-year-old loser, kicked out from living with his parents, living in a van...that is MAGA for you. Hope we will hear some apologies from @FoxNews tonight but not holding my breath. Deplorables indeed,
@blackishabc @MarcusScribner @TraceeEllisRoss @anthonyanderson Love this show.
@PatrickHaggan @ActMeasuresDoc @LouDobbs @seanhannity @GeraldoRivera wow we are so screwed
@tiniebeany I agree.
@ActMeasuresDoc @LouDobbs @seanhannity @GeraldoRivera Agreed.
@CNN you have a guest on with Cuomo right now who is equivocating that it is equally the media's fault for what is going on. WTF is wrong with you as a network.
@CNN where are your standards and practices when you let an ad like the Ed Rollins one air. He is promoting pure hatred and bigotry the type of hatred that had you broadcasting from the streets of NYC yesterday...what are you thinking...when is enough going to be enough
@DesignationSix That sounds super realistic.
Epic! https://t.co/xV2eyYVI7P

Anyone getting a wee bit nervous at even taking the house these days. This caravan coming up from Honduras through Mexico is bad news which ever way you look at it especially with trump in Texas tonight.
@SallyAlbright also, this caravan from Honduras up through Mexico is really bad this close to the mid-terms for the Dems.
Don’t boo! VOTE - 15 days
Yay Dodgers!
@PatrickHaggan I was just wondering...the margins were so small and i was just thinking about it.
@nickbilton Additionally, I also sell your podcast for Cadence13.
@nickbilton Thank you for your podcast &amp; the intro to @Hannahgadsby . The interview with her &amp; Monica Lewinsky led me to @Hannahgadsby Netflix special which led me to the great Rilo Kiley at the end of the TV special...so thank you so much. Great content begets great content.
@Hannahgadsby Your Netflix special brought me to tears.  Thank you for being so incredibly brave. Loved the interview with Monica at the Vanity Fair event. Well done and thank you so much.
@miss9afi You cannot be silenced. Your story is inspiring and very much in context after what we are learning about all things Saudi Arabia.

@WhitfordBradley I am watching the West Wing right now- US poet Laureate
@MichaelAvenatti its coming November 6th. sadly as awe saw with Kavanaugh there is nothing we can do until then.
@DonCheadle and I am sure he meant "snot" not "shot"
@mercedeslynz I hope they make you a huge star...you are tremendous!
@PodSaveAmerica That is absolutely right but you have to be in power for it to matter.

@wvjoe911 @BetoORourke That was a very depressing post about Beto being 9 points down.
Don't boo, VOTE - 25 days.
@PatrickHaggan exactly.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes It’s awful
@funder @realDonaldTrump Well he was very busy today meeting with the statesman they call Kanye.
Best quote of the night: “We have the opportunity to make America kind again, make America equal again, make America gracious again, make America AMERICA again.”
OK, call me crazy BOT i think something is fishy when my Twitter followers have jumped from 61k to 90k in a week.  Good evening Moscow.
@KarenChestney Not incensed enough to do anything about it
Interesting that trump admin is ok with kanye soiling himself in front of the nation and they all come to his defense but when Taylor Swift expresses an opinion well not so much.
@funder Let them call is a mob, who cares. This is our problem we care too much, they win because they don’t care. We need to care a lot less and win elections by any means necessary.
@YaraShahidi Great job...great show. Looking forward to it’s return next week.  “Don’t boo, VOTE”. PBO
@RCI_101 That, of course, is the key.  No Bernie. @MichaelAvenatti and Bloomberg and maybe @BetoORourke, not sure at this point who else makes any sense. @BetoORourke is the future though, I am certain of that.
Better still than having a mid-term election in 26 days is the fact that this time in 2 years we will be 20 something days away from getting rid of Trump.  Now that is something to have hope about.
@jewfem It is quite interesting... I think Roberts is going to be better for us than we think. I am not sure he is the straight-up idealogue that we think he is.
@burlivespipe @Amy_Siskind @CNN @MSNBC but it is the same thing every single time...it is just giving him the oxygen that he wants.
@dani_gooner @Amy_Siskind @CNN @MSNBC understood, but what i need is for them to get some fucking principles and just in case they were wondering...show them and I will not tune in.
@politicususa Every time i see this tweet i am going to delete it...what a ridiculous thing to report.
@stonecold2050 @Notgeorgiaokeef Perhaps if you had not married the ultimate bully you wouldn't be...please go and look for sympathy and empathy somewhere else...perhaps your husband has some to give.
There is nothing wrong with being super prepared...genuinely, have a plan for that day or do it by mail. https://t.co/5QGRO2PXrw
@Amy_Siskind Which makes it even more amazing that @CNN and @MSNBC continue to send reporters to these hate-filled rallies that have zero probstive news-worthiness.  It is just hate. Take away his oxygen and he will die.

@MSNBC why do you show these trump rallies? Stop it! These are hate-filled rallies that have ZERO newsworthiness and yet you cover them...WHY?
Don't be distracted by the noise from trump, fox or the aftermath of the kananaugh debacle...in 27 days we get to vote and really make a difference. Don't get down, don't get deleted just fucking VOTE! You will feel so much more empowered, I promise you!
A good day... I spoke my truth...it is all I can do.
@CNN please stop covering these hate-filled rallies. I will not watch you again until you stop it. This is how this guy elected. STOP IT!
@SallyAlbright Could not agree with you more...they are ridiculous in every way.

@SallyAlbright No, but it doesn't help and he is democrat really in name only...look at all the things that are dear to Dems that are now in peril due to what has happened. He only helps if he were to give us the slimmest of majorities if we win the senate.
@BetoORourke This guy has got to win...
@evertonbarks and Real Madrid lost their 4th game in a row...but you know what i mean.
When the only good thing that happened this week is that trump did not win a Nobel peace prize you know it has been a shit week.

@PatrickHaggan @KamalaHarris So do I
@SallyAlbright 100%...hope they are taking a good look around right now.
@Augustus709 There had to a better choice and he does not have our back.
@mikercarpenter @Cambria4DD All 3 branches are gone. The slippery slope just got more slippery.
@KamalaHarris Forget the reasons why right now. 31 days from now is all that matters.  That is where we have to focus our attention.
@bryanbehar Exactly what I asked yesterday.
You have to vote...it is the only thing that matters. Elections matter a lot. If you were a Bernie supporter and stayed home 2 years ago I hope you are taking a good look around. Don’t boo, vote it is literally all that matters and the only thing that will a difference.

@trtx84 @SusanCarver19 exactly. Elections matter.
@DogginTrump @WinstonFrank10 I am.
@Sen_JoeManchin in what way do you consider yourself a democrat.  Do us all a favor and change your party affiliation, at least then we would see your cowardly ass coming...you are useless to us.
@adamcbest @wvjoe911 wish that was even remotely possible or doable.
Got to win elections...if this does not motivate us then nothing will.  31 days for today we can either make a stand or we can surrender. This is important stuff now.
@wvjoe911 Good, I fully support it
@MSNBC @Aquaduct13 So do we.
@ida_skibenes and in 32 days we have the chance to make a change and we then are halfway to making REAL change.
In the end, i will just repeat what I have been saying: if you want to really effect change in this country you have to start winning elections, we have to start being about something and not just against things. Our first opportunity comes in 33 days...will you be part of it!
@IndivisibleNet well it would most likely be him so probably not much.
@MichaelAvenatti This only changes when we elect more women. Simple as that.
@keanothedog @ProudResister @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @SenateGOP well yes because sadly he will be o the supreme court.
@CillizzaCNN UB 40...a little Red Red Wine or is he exclusively a beer guy. Thank goodness it wasn't anything harder than UB 40.
@maydaymindy9 right
@EdKrassen sometimes?
@daniel_barrett @shannonrwatts @BetoORourke Also it’s not so much the numbers that make me think he is the real it’s the message.  Win or not in 37 days, he is going national...he might be the guy the Democrats have been looking for.
@MichaelAvenatti @LindseyGrahamSC He performs on demand for trump
@MichaelAvenatti @LindseyGrahamSC Trump is the one who told him to do it
Yeah, I might try that... https://t.co/Ba7HgF9YWn
@daniel_barrett @shannonrwatts @BetoORourke I understand all that but I think he is the real deal and win it not in  November he is going to go national.
@shannonrwatts @BetoORourke This guy is the real deal!
@ananavarro @AndrewGillum and don't believe any news that says the election is in the bag...just VOTE!
@Bornabrit1 @MSNBC @CNN I could not agree with you more, WTF are they doing. And to be fair why Bill Maher had to have Bannon on blows my mind.
@yashar wow, did she grow up fast!
Happy Birthday to @Pr1nceOfDarknes
@Naomi_Osaka_ As you should be.

@JCTate1215 @ssamcham That is a fact!
@mmpadellan Exactly!
#ChelseaLiverpool Great Game!
@BillKristol @choosysusan I am with you.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Mourinho doesn't make it to Halloween.  Happy birthday for tomorrow.
@ActMeasuresDoc You guys should listen to the Andrew Jenks podcast #WhatReallyHappened about the sonic attacks in Cuba...it leads to Russia and the term Active Measures is heard loud and clear.
2/2 with no ability to be objective in a position that demands he be objective. He is uniquely unqualified for this position and we know it by his own words. Forget the drinking and yes to a degree some of the other things but straight up this guy is not qualified.
1/2 There are so many things that disqualify Kavanaugh beyond just the obvious sexual allegations. Let's not forget this is place on SCOTUS a position that requires some level of impartiality but his opening statement yesterday shows him to be nothing more than a political hack
@Stop_Trump20 Nice double chin.
@AdyBarkan @ChuckGrassley to be fair he will 89 years old so it might not really matter.
@realAliTweets Sadly no chance.
@TimesofIsrael as they should.
This will make you laugh and after this week we need it. https://t.co/JJxwyEKNw7
@wvjoe911 that is very disappointing
@PatrickHaggan Could not have put it better myself.
@lisabe65 @alisha627 @dergrexxie @ZerlinaMaxwell that moment on &amp; they did nothing but praise Kavanaugh &amp; tell him he had nothing to be ashamed of and that it was a sham. That was the moment and they never looked back from there and that is why we are here where we are with this rapist lunatic about to be confirmed to SCOTUS.
@lisabe65 @alisha627 @dergrexxie @ZerlinaMaxwell Prior to that the woman that the GOP had hired to make them look softer and not to make them look like they were going to beat up on Ford had been asking all the questions. I am convinced that Trump texted or communicated in some way with Graham to take over and they did form
@lisabe65 @alisha627 @dergrexxie @ZerlinaMaxwell its a football term meaning you change the play at the line of scrimmage. Right after Durban asked Kavanaugh about turning to McCabe and asking for an FBI investigation the GOP senators started asking their own questions &amp; the first one up was the rant by Graham.
@alisha627 @dergrexxie @ZerlinaMaxwell i am telling you, i am convinced Trump called an audible from the White House.
@WhitfordBradley I watched a bunch of old West Wing episodes last weekend just to try and get my head out of the space of where this country is...
@MollyJongFast and sadly it will not make any difference today, tomorrow, Saturday or November 6th...you just watch. This country is nowhere.
1991, 2018...really where are we as a country? When these old white men are replaced as the lawmakers in this country and only then will things change...you have to win elections to have a say and Democrats do not win enough elections.
@DogginTrump a couple of Dems are going to cross over...you watch.
I think i spoke to soon.
and have no doubt about it Trump called the audible for the GOP senators to get in the game and sideline the lady they brought in to do the questioning...this was sickening, and saying they will pay in Nov means nothing at this moment because they probably won't.
end of the day the Republicans shouted loudest and last and utilized the Trump playbook to a Tee. Deny and deflect and lie, but really if you want to make decisions in this country you have got to win elections, it is as simple as that, 41 days, don't boo vote.
@wvjoe911 @NBCNews at the behest of Trump.
@CillizzaCNN No, Trump called it
@SenKamalaHarris There is one question that no one has asked - why suggest he wasn't really a drinker in high school during the Fox interview?
@maggieNYT That is a great point!
Dick Durban...my man!
Look at Hatch's face...

@MichaelAvenatti when are you going to tell us what you have got?
@MichaelAvenatti You are becoming my hero
@JCrockett623 @bjcreigh @DavidCornDC and just a little bit creepy.
@MichaelAvenatti @GOPChairwoman You go Michael!  That is the point, everything you have predicted in the last 7 months has come true.
@thomaskaine5 @RSuzanne5 Right, but if they are legally here then they have nothing to worry about...if they are not legally here then to be fair they should not be voting.  I see this from a really liberal POV. If they are able they have to vote.
@TheRickWilson Should be exciting.

Worst two words for Kavanaugh regarding this 2nd accusation (and for sure there will be more) is RONAN FARROW...he don't play, just ask Harvey Weinstein and Les Moonese.

@CapitalY1 @tonyposnanski he better be.
This is fantastic..is there any chance that Texas will do the right thing in this race. https://t.co/mmQWJ4sjmg
@freddyatton @MissingLink53 No question
@tonyposnanski and Jason Miller.
@lauferlaw @bbkenn92 If @CNN ever have this guy on again I will puke and stop watching the network.
@Bakari_Sellers You better be right!  I am counting on it!
@politvidchannel NO!!!!!
@TeaPainUSA @Vox_Democracy @jerome_corsi at this point I wish Mueller would just hurry the fuck up and get on with it.
@RepBrendanBoyle @JJohnsonLaw @BetoORourke That is great.
That is quality! https://t.co/YIAT8WF8mA
@SteveSchmidtSES Not for the GOP though...anything to circumvent the truth.
@SocialPowerOne1 Be still my heart...
Season 2 of the fabulous podcast series What Really Happened hosted by @AndrewJenks and brought to you by @Cadence13_ and @SevenBucksProd about Serena and Venus Williams is out today and is extraordinary. If there is anyone better at this than Jenks i am not aware of them.
@YouHadOneJ0B 67
@phyllisj1003 @SagArcher @steve_amp @Quicklitning @TheChickLivesOn @suzystays @KikiAdine @RedHairnBlkLthr @Dolly_Dagger6 Not meant, wanted to be gentle before someone was really nasty.
@phyllisj1003 @SagArcher @steve_amp @Quicklitning @TheChickLivesOn @suzystays @KikiAdine @RedHairnBlkLthr @Dolly_Dagger6 Polls perhaps.
@buddickmanut These are bad people.  I wouldn't serve them either. The issue of principles over money and business are alive. These are bad people: racists, bigots, misogynists, they seem to sympathize with Nazis... I don't have a problem with this at all.
@DogginTrump That is wonderful.
Be well over the fast.
@SenFeinstein You too Senator. Keep up the good work.
@PatrickHaggan @THR @Heather_Kozan It really was.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump Well, you are about to lose your Supreme Court justice...nothing will happen until the mid-terms, the left will really mobilize &amp; maybe the Senate could be in play. Get to Jan 2020 and nobody is getting a hearing let alone confirmed and you can thank MCConnell for that.
@CapitalY1 My company Cadence13 works with all the @crookedmedia shows like @PodSaveAmerica so we are excited to see their HBO show.
Coming soon to HBO - Pod Save America https://t.co/UOcTqNqvEU
@THR @Heather_Kozan I am sure Republicans think these two were crisis actors put by liberals.  This was one of the greatest things I have ever seen on TV...remember he had to win to make it work in such spectacular fashion.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump That is a shame because he is god to me but I am pretty sure your politics would make him sick.
@Kokomothegreat I take it every night and I seem to love all races exactly the same and just as much.
@WalshFreedom It is not the event, it is the denial and politicians don't get lifetime appointments. What else do you have?
@TomiLahren I would say the woman is a victim...bet you wouldn’t feel this way if this was a liberal being nominated by a democratic president.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump and I hope you hate Springsteen because I would hate to think you and I had anything in common.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump I love that you say that, OMG your delusion is overwhelming. Not only will the Dems win the house but some of your real relics are going to go like Rohrbacher and Deven Nunes...the house is a certainty...sadly the Senate is not, its impeachment time of the orange traitor.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump The house is gone for you...i would love to get the senate too but think this is the wrong cycle.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump How very enlightened and of course you make my point..you require others to tell you what to think and https://t.co/Pi653M7vPu hope for you and we will take the country back in November.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump Question: is Fox News fake news to you, or is it all good because that is what you watch, they tell you what to think and it is nice and easy for you? Thinking is difficult to be sure but I think you make it a little more difficult than it needs to be. Asking for a friend.
@realDonaldTrump Another cut and paste job.
@TranslateRealDT He would not know the law and will not know the law until it literally comes to get him.
@schlichtig_mike @realDonaldTrump Money laundering is the crime not collusion...much worse. He has been laundering money for the Russians since the early 90s, this is not left wing nonsense this is absolute fact. I know u will not want to hear it but you will see.
@DogginTrump I am
@WalshFreedom Aren't you one of them?  The entire party are nothing but enormous hypocrites
@realDonaldTrump And this while there is a hurricane hitting the US. If you support this man and can’t see that he cares about nothing but himself then you are a fool.
@gordy_shanks @realDonaldTrump Trump money laundered.
@CillizzaCNN but hey it is a witch hunt.
@DebAdadj71 @LamarWhiteJr This Russia hacking is real.
@KNX1070 firing? she should be prosecuted for 2nd degree murder.
@LamarWhiteJr @DebAdadj71 This no joke and yesterday I got a call from Apple security telling me my Apple account was being hacked by someone in Moscow.
@Heather_Kozan I was there earlier this week and it was a grim
@AnnaVital5 I was refering to Dana DeLoesh
@maggieNYT You think so...if they did they would leave. Woodward’s book alone says it all.
@AnnaVital5 They have Dana dear...and no we might not want him impeached but we want him gone. Please don’t confuse the ideas.
You think this Russia shit isn’t real...take a look. https://t.co/yruh3J5knQ
@CNNPolitics Good for him.nothing will get under trumps skin more.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Just wait until they fit you for that orange jumpsuit.
@aliasvaughn @cmpnwtr Yup
@SocialPowerOne1 Then they are not really fans.
⁦@PodSaveAmerica⁩ at the El Rey in LA tonight. https://t.co/i27J430yuX
@ezralevant @daledamos So?
@chelseahandler @tdillner Precisely.
Enough said! https://t.co/yghGS63C3t
@WalshFreedom Yet 20 million people were provided with health care. Why does the GOP see things through the prism of if someone else is getting something then I must be losing something. 20 million got health care w/out penalty for pre-existing conditions, really awful.
@brianefallon Is she that naive...is not a bribe...it is what people do to provide themselves with choice when their elected officials do the exact opposite of what their constituents want.
@tonyschwartz I got the audiobook from audible, delivered electronically right on time.
@JustChrisByrd Absolutely!
@JustChrisByrd And you have the same birthday as my Mum
@swinging_volley Indeed...enough about Serena already. Hail the Champ @Naomi_Osaka_
@JustChrisByrd Next time. I will be back soon. There is quite a bit of business there and my Mum lives there.
Came back from Phoenix to LA today...the temperature differential from when I left Pheonix to when I arrived in LA (I drove) - 40 degrees. Left Pheonix at 109 degrees, arrived LA 69 degrees.
@HelenHunt @ActMeasuresDoc @jackabryan It is a must see
@ActMeasuresDoc @jackabryan @LauraBDuBois @marleydclements @maddow Best documentary ever!
@atDavidHoffman Totally agree.
@ProudResister He cares about nobody but himself.
@EdKrassen How about when he started a disgusting rumor that the former president was not born in the US.  This man is complete scum not as a president or politician but as a human being. if there is a hell he is surely going there.
@Gedd_at @thedailybeast exactly.
@bernabephoto @Bornabrit1 scum. How can people do this and behave this way.  A beautiful, peaceful animal.
@wvjoe911 lets see how that works out.
@stonecold2050 @j3rfAFC More quality
@SocialPowerOne1 Wow...how do they do this with a straight face.
@Sarcasticsapien @Millennial_Dems That is epic!
@Stop_Trump20 Childish but very funny.
@ActMeasuresDoc Can someone please DM me about this...I work for a podcasting network called Cadence13.
@SenatorCollins @tart_manchester You will not love the state of Maine if you vote for Kavanaugh.
@DonnaNoble10th @MSNBC @KidCasteel @TrinityResists @Rey_Sistance @MrScottLads @LunaLuvgood2017 @dizzle5000 @StormResist @SnowBiAuthor @AryaResists @TrisResists @GOP how about some Benghazi style hearing about this one... what do you say?
@wvjoe911 Don’t buy this, don’t be fooled it is just trying to suppress the vote.
@JoeBarri As long as he is serious about losing.
@MattSmethurst @j3rfAFC Wow!
@StevenBeschloss @tdillner He could not write for coherent sentence, so no danger there.
@Naomi_Osaka_ I am so pleased for @Naomi_Osaka_  Fantastic champions...Novak as well.
@TheRickWilson Yes he is. Between the documentary #ActiveMeasures, Woodward's book and the op-ed from last week...he has much to be nervous about.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends all lies.  Wages are most certainly not up  3% and the the point Fox misses is that all the economic news: good, bad or indifferent does not deflect from the issue of trump being a national and global embarrassment and a criminal.
@ActMeasuresDoc Please watch it...it is so important and is the very crux of what Trump is really scared of...and rightfully so, he has been laundering money for the Russians since the early 90s.
@RVAwonk @moonshadow623 He should stay there.
@willsommer Congrats.
@JudgeJeanine S	N	O	W	F	L	A	K	E
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine what a bunch of snowflakes you are., You sure can dish it but not so good at taking it.  Birtherism...after that you have no where to go so just handle it because he ain't done yet.
@dodo @lovcen1900 Beautiful.
@stonecold2050 'Nuff said... https://t.co/xRmOYESeu1
@Oceanation Your jaw will drop is what I meant
@Oceanation Your draw will drop when you see how obvious the whole thing is when you watch #ActiveMeasures
@Oceanation collusion issue is just a ruse...the issue is money laundering and why he has been so susceptible to their influence. as the NYTimes writer suggests...everyone who is a nuisance to trump gets abused but not Putin there is a genuine reason and its not a pee tape.
@Oceanation https://t.co/tBHwTyf0w7
@cosplaydevil I don't get it...something must be missing...
Read this https://t.co/tBHwTyf0w7 and watch #Activemerasures...it could not be clearer, don't be fooled by the collusion ruse the whole things has its roots in money laundering which inevitable leads to the collusion.
@Oceanation I think it goes back much further than 2008...watch #ActiveMeasures.  They lay it out superbly.
@Oceanation Could not agree with you more...he is as toxic as cancer to every part of our fabric.
@The_UnSilent_ @TGIFrani Stunning, Beautiful...I commend you in every way. Thank you for saving them.
Not my quote but I think it is so apt for these times: America is waking up to what Germany did in 1933 that 1/3rd of the people would kill a 1/3rd of the people while the other 1/3rd watched...or something like that.
@BOB0101RLC @Bornabrit1 Reagan or Regan...there were two of them: Ronald Reagan and Donald Regan. One was prez and one has Chief of staff.  Glad you saw the light mate.
@TopherSpiro I hope she heeds the call...otherwise she needs to go. Also, we need another republican and that is if all dems vote no and that is no certainty.
@Oceanation we are going through it but this is much worse because the GOP are complicit in it all today, at least back then they saw the reality of the situation.
@JoWright59 @Oceanation so am I and so do i.  Fake patriotism is no patriotism at all.
@vanderkamp1978 as you should be...it's all your fault.  Wenger Out!
Let me break this down and please check me if I have got this wrong: a man of color is shot and killed because a white cop walked into the wrong apartment, thought its was hers so felt totally entitled to kill the man. I am speechless.
@DearAuntCrabby I think he is full of shit...but it was nice to read for about a second.
You just cannot make this shit up...Just Do It, indeed. https://t.co/6C5Wgu5BDg
@wvjoe911 That is profound quality!
@SocialPowerOne1 Wow I hope he is right and this is the only time I will ever say that when it comes to him.
@stonecold2050 Obama or Springsteen.
Not my father, someone else father but the sentiment is nailed on. Exactly how they think about everything. https://t.co/tEGxLPYIDd
@EversonPatton @cbfowler @mikeabadir @njc2o @akash_ranu @Naomi_Osaka_ @rogerfederer Well put...time to simply take it on the chin.
Feeling very melancholy that all the majors in golf and tennis are over. Realized today that the US Open and Australian Open essentially bookend the NFL season...just musing here.
@tiniebeany Please make her pay if she votes for him
@debv219 I am not sure about this.
@mikeabadir @njc2o @akash_ranu @cbfowler @Naomi_Osaka_ @rogerfederer I don't believe that is specifically true when you think that she was on her 3rd warning and had already lost a point...so she knew where she was in the spectrum of warnings.  But wow the drama.
@cbfowler @mikeabadir @njc2o @akash_ranu @Naomi_Osaka_ @rogerfederer Thanks for weighing in @cbfowler. Love your work on all the Majors... I am always extraordinarily impressed with your depth of knowledge in both tennis and college football. Who do you like tomorrow?
@ABC Then fucking do it and stop talking about it.
@mikeabadir @njc2o @akash_ranu @cbfowler @Naomi_Osaka_ @rogerfederer I don't think that makes a difference either...if the ump saw the coaching the rest is immaterial...the act of coaching got a violation - no harm done until she smashes the racket and then she knows she is on thin ice...everything then is really on her.
@breenandy141 @briankoppelman I think the point I am making is that I do not believe that Serena thought she had been warned after the coaching discussion and she should have known better. What happened after that was truly on her.
@mbrookerob @Naomi_Osaka_ Yes, lets talk about that because she was amazing today.
@judithdenton4 @Misty4Mueller @andyroddick @serenawilliams @Naomi_Osaka_ It felt like they were trying to be "this is NY and we will boo if we like" until the realized or had to be told how stupid it all was and how ridiculous...sadly does not seem that strange in a Trump America.
@mikeabadir @njc2o @akash_ranu @cbfowler @Naomi_Osaka_ @rogerfederer It makes no difference if Serena saw it it is the fact that as a team they were coaching a player and that is a violation. And she obviously did see it because she immediately started coming into the net.
@Zylermusic I completely agree.
@Naomi_Osaka_ US Open Champion!  Congratulations.
@sdutzeigler @aaronganz Agreed.
@BeastModeGran @SteveSchmidtSES @hulu Watch it tonight...it will explain everything and then everything will make perfect sense.
@ActMeasuresDoc @jackabryan @RealTimers @billmaher It should be #1, people need to understand how brilliantly it lays out the case that it's not so much about collusion but money laundering...the collusion is the obvious road that it takes.  Everyone should watch it.
@ChrisCuomo Why do you have these people on... they are a disgrace.
@JeffEisenband @serenawilliams @Naomi_Osaka_ That was good of her to do that but the only person I feel bad for is Osaka.  The biggest moment of her life and it marred by this BS.
@briankoppelman And in fact just put Amazon in your show.
@briankoppelman I love your show and I love selling it but I disagree.  First off her coach was coaching and it’s for Serena to know the rules.
Totally classless by the NY crowd at @usopen
This is pretty amazing what is going on at the US Open Women's Final.
...and the fact of the matter is that despite her indignation and the bringing up of her daughter Serena was getting coaching from her box @USOpen and with the smashing of the racket she deserved a point deduction.
@georgerose25 @Ocean__Dreamer It used to be...
@karenhunter @serenawilliams @Naomi_Osaka_ Chris Fowler and Chris Evert are insufferably ridiculous with their homerisim in this @USOpen Women's Final.
@georgerose25 @Ocean__Dreamer Land of Hope and Dreams
@BeastModeGran @SteveSchmidtSES Could not agree more. If you have not seen Active Measures I highly recommend it...it lays it out very well.
@fred_guttenberg @1redcupcake And sadly it will have zero effect talking to the people she was talking to.
@MichaelAvenatti That is why I am with you.
@SteveSchmidtSES The collusion is only a part of it. It is about the fact that Trump has been laundering money for the Russians since the 80s...the collusion is just the very natural place that the initial crimes would lead.
I don't need to hear them or to meet them halfway...they are bigots and you are giving them airtime, you should be ashamed of yourselves.
@CNN you don't get points for having these disgusting people on. We know what their position is, we know they believe in bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, they believe in Nazis and you are giving them airtime.
@ChrisCuomo how are you getting beaten to shit by Cory Lewandowski...why do you have these people on...STOP IT...they are fucking EVIL.  What are you not getting about this?
@WalshFreedom No wrong again...Russia gave us Trump and you will need to own that and the fact that your side of the aisle doesn't seem to care at all.
FFS @CNN why on earth do you bother having these people on.  Why do you give them the oxygen...they are evil, they are liars and they are traitors and this should not just be about giving someone like @ChrisCuomo someone to argue with. Stop it...this is how Trump got elected.
@MichaelAvenatti Love the idea...never going to happen but I love the idea. This is the way to fight and this is the way to start thinking about tings...how do we win and in a proactive way rather than always reacting to the GOP.
@emrazz Ain't that the truth.
@davidvons187 @bannerite I am literally in tears.
Why @CNN do you need to do the split scream...can we not just have a serious human being on TV on his own for a few minutes.  Please...is it so much to ask.
@SenKamalaHarris @tdillner @maddow Run for president please.
@RiskyLiberal @KySandy Absolutely!  We just rolled over.
I see even the heavens are supporting @Kaepernick7
@PassTheSalty @DesignationSix How many personal lawyers does Trump have!
@KennyWFDLive Thanks, mate.  Hope you are doing Ok with what you are going through.
@LouiseMensch @aliasvaughn @SenKamalaHarris Lets hope so
Please, @CNN and @MSNBC do not cover this bullshit rally in Montana...there is enough to talk about without giving this wretched human being more oxygen. Let him live only on FOX,
@thomaskaine5 @STLMikeOB I think so
Well said and articulated. https://t.co/5nK0fTpxJs
@RealMuckmaker I cannot see it
@ananavarro Please tell her to fuck off.
whoever wrote that op-Ed piece  is important “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”  While I wish he was not anonymous it’s a good start and it is in effect the start of a type of coup...perhaps we aren’t more than a banana republic
@realDonaldTrump You are unraveling and Mueller hasn’t come knocking yet. Tick tick...is it Coates, is it Mathis...you must have doubled your ambience dose tonight just to get any sleep.
@BryanBeatson Or Coates
@amyewalter @DR9214N No it’s not, it’s absolutely the right thing. This is the problem with us Democrats, we are so scared to make a noise. It’s time to make more than just noise!
@MichaelAvenatti You better run because I am voting for you.
@goingglocal They don’t have books
@SocialPowerOne1 Where to begin..,
@evertonbarks What’s next Lokomotiv St. Louis
Inter Miami CF...are you fucking kidding me!
@Evan_McMullin He is a liar
@ObsoleteDogma @CruzWhobris I actually heard her say that...mindboggling!
@Brasilmagic I think that is where i am leaning
@vanderkamp1978 It's not a bad shout at all and he has previous especially after Helsinki where he most certainly was the only adult in the room/government.
@PiperPerabo Well done, proud of you.
@vanderkamp1978 Agreed.
So who does everyone think the "anonymous white house source" is.  I am hearing Kelly but I am not sure.
@jflem94 Now if you had done any research you would know that I did get dropped by FOX but you are a bit of a plastic journalist who works for realtors so no surprise there.
@jflem94 It is certainly a matter of opinion and one I am pretty sure you don't have the first idea about.  I stand by my argument and again your journalistic skills really play hard...read the headline...i dropped the show not the other way around.
@kurteichenwald They would.
@jflem94 I am just saying if you call yourself a journalist be a journalist don't just work for the realtors, although that said let's hope it sells for the $1.5M. A better story that you should be interested in is where the money actually came from to buy the house.
@AKMMitchell @realDonaldTrump You call it like you see it!
@steveblack036 There is nothing good going on mate.
Genuinely...she has never worked for anything other than scale...calling her an actress is a bit rich. And it is my house, if you did any research you would see that.
@AKMMitchell @realDonaldTrump Love your posts!
This is exactly what @amandacarpenter said yesterday on CNN...there are people in the WH who are serving in this administration only to save the country from POTUS.
It apparently took trump 30 minuets to read the op-ed...30 minutes I say.
so who do we think wrote this? https://t.co/pBRqi0Mr0K
@darrenrovell @ColorMeBougie08 @OBJ_3 @serenawilliams @OTLonESPN And the only reason I will watch any of that game.
@LeftofLondon I am dying to know who this is!
@PatrickHaggan @rolandscahill @JJohnsonLaw Precisely.
Having just read this it is clear that the only appropriate action to this op-ed is to now invoke the 25th Amendment. This person is saying that POTUS cannot be trusted to make the right decisions, what else are we waiting for: https://t.co/pBRqi0Mr0K
@ItsMeCathi Did it using his name and the email address Donnie@hesgoingtoprison.com
@ActMeasuresDoc @amazon It is genuinely that important.
@ActMeasuresDoc @amazon Put it on @CNN and @MSNBC
@rolandscahill @JJohnsonLaw There is nothing discredited about this book at all...only in his simple little mind.
@RealMuckmaker @thomaskaine5 How is he still behind...this should be a slam dunk.
@bjaninemorison actually not just the political landscape but he is a wretched human being in every way.
@bjaninemorison In a classic line when they played golf once and trump was caught cheating he famously said "I cheat on my wives, you think I wouldn't cheat at golf."  It speaks volumes to who he is. The most wretched man to ever enter the political landscape.
@bjaninemorison My former brother in law who is a huge guy in NY real estate and knows trump told me once that anyone who knows trump, played golf with him, done business with him, worked him or mowed his lawn would never ever vote for him.
@bjaninemorison Agreed. It was spellbinding in its simplicity at connecting the dots. The collusion issuer is a red herring its all about money laundering which has led to the biggest espionage story in the history of the world.
@bjaninemorison it is extraordinary...frightening, but extraordinary.
@piersmorgan Stay in your lane regarding Kapeernick  you clearly don't understand the issue at all that is not about the flag and you are just doing Trumps bidding for him. You are an ignorant disgrace and a coward just like your friend.
I find it amazing that with the revelations coming from Woodward’s book that the idea of the 25th amendment has not been a genuine consideration.  This is what his own staff are saying about the President of the United States... this is madness in the extreme.
@christophclarey @bgtennisnation He is all class both in victory and defeat.
@valerieonmaui Or when Russia told him
@trcfwtt Agreed!
@trcfwtt Saw this today: “America you are waking up to the same realization as Germany did in 1933: 1/3rd of you would kill another 1/3rd while the other 1/3rd watched.” We are in deep shit and everyone should watch the documentary #ActiveMeasures to see how completely fucked we are.
@MichaelAvenatti @helenmag You go mate...get it done
@MSNBC Stop...how about we win the house back first and then think about that. Typical democrats starting a fight when there is nothing to fight over...yet.
@dani_gooner @bzref from your lips...we need the Senate which I do not believe we will win...in fact there is a chance we might lose seats there.
@nrarmour Agreed...I still watch the Australian Open finals from '17 and '18 with tears in my eyes as well as Wimbledon last year and Indian Wells and Miami.
@slpng_giants OK @Gladwell but I think these guys have had enough oxygen to spew their hatred. My astonishment lays with the fact that he was invited in the first place...how about they extend the invite to @Kaepernick7
@Amy_Siskind @ainnj2 Epic stuff!
Will be buying some new @Nike hiking shoes this week with some shorts and socks. Thank you Nike for having the stones to do this.
@TPVTrevor @Beaufort_Gage Nice One!
@JohnWDean @Our4thEstate I wish he would make it already...lets get this thing going or at least lets have some indictments like Don Jr and/or Jared.
@nrarmour To be sure...He is still the GOAT to me. Hate when he loses in a major because I always wonder if he will decide to retire...at some point he will have to.
As if watching #ActiveMeasures was not bad enough, now @rogerfederer loses in the round of 16 at the @usopen.  Still #GOAT
@RepSwalwell @debv219 Me too.
@real_farmacist as much as I wish this were true this sounds like totally bullshit and fake news.
@davekovalak @ActiveMeasures I realize that Trump throws out collusion as a red-herring but its the money-laundering that will get him ultimately...far more illegal than collusion or even obstruction of justice. The depths off this documentary is phenomenal if not incredibly frightening.
@bzref I am there...make no question about it.
Could not agree more...everyone should be required to watch it. https://t.co/pXo05QXBS3
@jackabryan Thank you for making this documentary...every fucking American should be required to watch it although most would still not believe a word of it.
@ActMeasuresDoc Thank you for making this...although truth be told I am more frightened than ever before.
@davekovalak @ActiveMeasures Beyond frightening. if 10% of it is true this country is so compromised and we have two branches of government who simply don't care.
What is taking Robert Mueller so long?
@ava @WeActRadio I just have so I am very familiar with this stuff...
I am watching the documentary #ActiveMeasure and 2 things r abundantly clear: 1, it's not collusion, its the Trump organization and its money laundering operations for Russia &amp; 2. If 10% of this is true then we have already lost. they've got us! We are compromised beyond belief.
@stmonkeydoom sadly it has become a banana republic and I don't mean any disrespect to your run of the mill banana republics.
@davidmweissman @BarackObama I am prepared to take this at face value, end of the day this person will need to live with himself, if he’s a fraud then it’s he who is defrauding.
How frightening but correct is this. https://t.co/l9WQWKViEt
@jenjavajunky Hope Israel would have the good sense to not take her in.
@yreme_jensen @Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump In 60 odd days you will have an opportunity to correct that.
@beINSPORTSUSA @KMbappe @ManUtd @kev_egan @PartidoPooper what has happened to you guys on DirecTV in the US?
@triangular_duck @Jordigone @Kaepernick7 @DVNJr Which I am fine with
@MarkCStanley @beINSPORTSUSA That is fucked up, I am not pleased...now that sounds like collusion.
@renato_mariotti @LJR1626 Both charged with serious crimes, what is wrong with this moron.
@Dax_x98 @SallyAlbright 3
@JoeBarri 100% correct. We need someone who is not afraid to go toe to toe with Trump the douchebag.
@princessmom122 @SallyAlbright I actually need Bernie Sanders to fuck off and exit stage left.
@JoyceWhiteVance @bbkenn92 When all is said and done I hope his sacrifice is seen much hoe Ali's was in the late 60's.
@stucam7771 and couldn't they afford scalped tickets in the pit...what is America coming to...
@Kaepernick7 @DVNJr I am all in with Nike.  Well done.  Finally, a corporation with some real balls and not just balls you hit, kick, spike or bounce #Nike
@realDonaldTrump I really don't care, do you.
@MayorOfLA @bbkenn92 @BarackObama @LACity @HerbJWesson @CurrenDPriceJr @mhdcd8 That is Rodeo Road not Rodeo Drive people...not the same thing at all but a good start.
@chuckwoolery Yet you can't pronounce the greasy correctly. Slim ball.
@il0vethe70s @Vox_Democracy Really--- who loves ya baby.
@JamesCranford That is all I needed to hear.
@leeleeb50 No
https://t.co/Bwuj2vM3x8
@ID_Resistance @GOP Nicely done!  Literally we need to make a huge fucking list that spells out the utter hypocrisy of the Republican Party for all to see. They are the scum of the earth.
@joncoopertweets Let’s hope so
@DogginTrump Incredible progress
@atDavidHoffman one step at a time.
@GeeGeeAkili @Chr_Steven_76 agreed
@ID_Resistance @GOP You should go on and on and then lets get the entire list and retweet and retweet and retweet.
@Bornabrit1 Thanks for that. I am going to watch it now.
@_NotFakeNews_ @elid955 That is two funerals he was mocked at in 2 days.
@KTLA Love the burgers but I am done with them.
@Chr_Steven_76 @GeeGeeAkili awe need billboards like this all over Texas.
What has happened to @beINSPORTSUSA sport on DirecTV? WTF. Only real reason I went with DirecTV
@Dax_x98 @realDonaldTrump You don't want to know, I be in twitter jail for a while and the secret service would be heading.  my way, suffice to say I hate the man for who is as a human being not as a president. He is the most awful person to ever enter American politics.

@RanttMedia I am with Mueller but I wish he would hurry up.
Woof! https://t.co/AGmB1ygc4b
@hatttiegladwell @leeleeb50 I do...my dog sleep son the bed every night...whats the point of having a pet if you don't let them live with you. They are family.
@eorlins @TheSWPrincess @innoutburger count me in...love their burgers but @inandoutburger you and are I breaking up. Wont eat @ChickfilA and now will not eat @inandoutburger. You donate or vote for the GOP I cannot give you my business.
@EWErickson @Smilingl8dy Tells you a lot about where the GOP is.
@KevinMKruse He is getting very nervous.
@Bornabrit1 @MSNBC @CNNPolitics Agreed...why don't @MSNBC and @CNN don't do more of that...no idea why.
@CharlesMBlow yes it is.
@BravenakBlog I am pretty sick of him generally.
@CillizzaCNN @ringer Now you are just talking utter nonsense. Come on Chris, you know better than that.
@WalshFreedom How far is down
Is the Champions League draw on TV in the US?
@DaddyDaddymac @Jim_Jordan Yes he is a pedophile.
@JustChrisByrd @ChampionsLeague Considerably
@franklinleonard at last...
@FOXSoccer @MLS @AlexiLalas Cannot believe that I am going to miss your @ChampionsLeague coverage but it looks like I am going to based on what I have seen from Turner so far.
@jenjavajunky really the only good thing to come out of yesterday.
@IBES16 @ChampionsLeague Shocking!
@saabrian @FOXSoccer @TurnerSportsPR It is really going to be awful. Carlos Bocanegra, Steve Nash...ouch!
@hunterlm @ChampionsLeague I know but the TV stuff based on what I have just seen is going to be awful and they are not getting a dime from me.
@Joca9_De_Sousa @ChampionsLeague I think it can...and by some margin.
@dylanmarchetti Totally agree. I have had to unsubscribed to most of them.
@_YourHighness00 Oh My Fucking God...what is wrong with people.
Oh dear, Turner Sports coverage of the @ChampionsLeague is awful, it's going to get worse and this is a shocking step back for football in the US. This is going to be tragic.
@mrdolcethecat @KikiAdine @AndrewGillum Followed
@ECMcLaughlin That’s awesome.  I had to do it!

@WalshFreedom No i cannot.
@djtchwjtch So what...he truely loved guns.
@PatrickHaggan @OllieHolt22 Possibly but he is gone by Halloween. United already 6 points behind the leaders...he will blame the board but what he was doing today was saying goodbye. he is a punk and a coward...just like Trump.
@adamcbest @JoyMareeKaine1 and I was wrong...it was 80.
@OllieHolt22 No question...and what he is doing right now by applauding the crowd is his way off saying goodbye.. Stick a fork in him, he's done.
@StevieVanZandt I guess the question really is does he want the time off...I always get the sense that being in front of people is just what he adores to do, needs to do...I am hoping.
@djtchwjtch @mmpadellan @BarackObama Enjoy your Fox News.  Even the twat Tucker Carlson quasi retracted that load of total and utter rubbish and bullshit but don’t let the truth get in the way.
@Brasilmagic That is 80 dead...how unbelievable is that number...how do these folks sleep at night.
So where in America can you not get shot. https://t.co/X3R53O1wJo
@Kris_Sacrebleu No I am sure they were all just fine with that!
@adamcbest @JoyMareeKaine1 I count 73 deaths in this list...73 dead people...think about that, lives cut short due to political weakness...how do these people live with themselves.
EXACTLY! https://t.co/Cyh1C0zf0S
@emrazz although the list of female serial and mass killers is long and distinguished...I cannot think of a single female who has behaved in this way.
@maggieNYT @Kris_Sacrebleu one of my questions would be where is Melania to try and tell this imbecile that his conduct is disgusting on every level. Where is anyone...who awful a human being is this guy, cares about nothing and nobody but himself.
@debiowens I could not have said it better. The right is the real enemy of this country.
@thehill How is anyone remotely surprised by this...this is who he is...he cares about nobody but himself. The greatest day is going to be when one his children get indicted...you will see him throw them under the proverbial bus...there is nobody he will not betray.
@emrazz @JoyMareeKaine1 well said and articulated.
@MrDavidQuinn @TechMk_RGM @CNN @ChrisCuomo @jaketapper @wolfblitzer @PoppyHarlowCNN @brianstelter It is actually an amazingly good idea...and should not be too much to ask.
@SarahTreem And Aretha last week.
@DogginTrump He is the only republican who put country over party.
@atDavidHoffman You got it one tweet.  Well said. I felt the same when I was in Israel 2 months ago. All this crap and nonsense that we are best country in the world is utter crap and nonsense.  And we could be but for one word: GREED.
@Turnip2020 @Auzzielvr Me too...shame the current occupant of the white house does not have an ounce of the class of this man.
@julie9567457301 @Vox_Democracy @BarackObama Me too.
@BuzzFeedNews @taiping2 That is how a President does it. Thank you @BarackObama
@mmpadellan The last and only republican who put country over party.
@fawfulfan @JimDixon266 Can we bring the full force of Twitter upon this horrible little woman...she is a disgrace to everything there is about human decency.
Sen. John McCain thank you for your service and courage, RIP, you deserve it and have earned and I am so sorry that you and your family have had to endure all manner of insults from this administration. You are the last remnant of class of your party. You will be missed.
@CillizzaCNN He is an awful human being, an awful man and nothing about that is going to change. He cares about nothing but himself.
@CillizzaCNN That is so sad.
@realDonaldTrump Which means there is going to be bigly collisions and I can’t wait.
@karaswisher @TheRickWilson You were both great.
@wordsmithviv In a heart beat
@Weinsteinlaw Not my president
@FoxNews Must be Obama's fault.
@peterdaou @marvswife They would lose the vote...we don't have the numbers.
@Brasilmagic Possibly only Fox because nobody else will have him	...hopefully.
@Dax_x98 @realDonaldTrump That is really good...one can only hope.
@brucepknight It really is...

@wdunlap @realDonaldTrump @TrumpsBelle If you need that answered...
@jkwuc89 @NBC4FFN @ThisWeekSports @sciotofootball Sounds competitive.
@GOP @JimDixon266 so 19 months is the longest ever?  What about the 60 months of Obama or does that not count because he is black. Trump, Cohen, Collins, Hunter, Manafort own them all because you are about to get severely punished in November for the crooks you are.
@JaredSawyerJr @elid955 This child has been beaten.
@u_franken Then why did you resign...democrats are such pussies.
@michaelwild2198 @elid955 @williamlegate oh there is lots more to come...I just wish Mueller would get on with it.
@johncusack Two things on this: Dems are acting like pussies as usual &amp; secondly impeachment is a process. If you can't indict a sitting president then the only way to address criminal wrong-doing is by impeachment which is a trial in congress that said president gets to defend himself in.
@TheRickyDavila @lovcen1900 a real man.
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan possibly a couple of Republicans will toss their hats in the ring (Kasich for one) to see what happens in 2020 while trump will continue to pathologically lie for the rest of his term. And lastly, i don't want him impeached i want him beaten in 2020.
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan as Mueller's investigation nears its conclusion. As for what 'my" party should be doing: they should be trying to have the best performance and turn out for the 2018 mid-terms which is what I believe they are doing. Once the mid-terms are over i am sure several Democrats and
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan McConnell, and Graham come to mind) who seem not to be able to apply the same standard to Trump (who subverted the course of an election behaving like a common mob boss) although his culpability at this point is far worse and is without question going to get exponentially worse
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan So, I have never suggested that Clinton (which was 20 years ago i might add) should be treated any differently at any time and in fact I am pretty sure he was impeached although not convicted by a very zealous special prosecutor (Ken Starr) and several Republicans (Hatch,
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan lost the election so why is she still the issue.
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan on with Trump is that we have someone who behaves like a mob boss, lies in a pathological sense and is so narcissistic as to be fundamentally dangerous for the country. We are in real trouble in this country and your response to me is what about Clinton who last I checked
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan notion but do tell me something: what has she ever been indicted for...investigated I understand, but what has ever been indicted for and the answer is nothing. Her husband got a blow job in the white house that much is true. Beyond that, it is all bullshit whereas what is going
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan and center and the way I know that is that Trump can't stop telling us how there was no collusion...there was and it is going to be proven. Lastly with all that he won the election by 78,000 votes across three states. And this idea that everyone supports the Clintons is a false
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan well to put this in context: we have found out this week that Trump violated campaign finance laws and collided with an American citizen with the express purpose of influencing an election.  Moving on, there is no question when Mueller is done collusion with Russia will be front
@NEEL__1987 @hullboydan Ok, so prosecute him...what’s your point.
That’s why I only use @lyft https://t.co/ytB0tryJ7b
@Amy_Siskind I am with you. Why does @CNN do this, why not just invite Alex Jones on and call it a fucking day.
@DogginTrump Give it a minute
@sahluwal @tunnell55 This is fucking insane... I cannot get my head around where this country is...how is this possible for people to treat other people like this. BTW, not only a hate crime, he obviously had to expose himself to her, it is a sex crime and he can go on the register after prison.
@IamStevenT it's a little about politics...please say so, I am hoping it is.
It is amazing that @GOP cannot see whats coming. Yesterday and what we know can only be perhaps 10% of the whole sad mess, I am quite sure Mueller knows the other 90% and he is not going to be shy. Donnie jr and Jared should be concerned, very concerned. I cannot wait.
@andrew14ad @DogginTrump They don't have media or microphones in Europe?  I could have sworn I saw a couple last time I was there.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @Touchstone328 That is all you've have got today after your traitorous father was seen for who he is yesterday. Remind me what your position was after Vegas, Orlando, Sandy Hook. Concerned then or is this you and your disgusting family trying to use a poor family in Iowa for your polictal gain
@DogginTrump He is strangely quite.
@brycetache People need to be brave!
Only way anything changes is that everyone has to get out &amp; vote on Nov 6th.  Everything else is just conversation. If you want the house, if you want change, if you want this national embarrassment to end you have only to do one thing VOTE! As Obama used to say: don't boo, vote!
@CharlesMBlow @SallyAlbright @BetoORourke Let's all get behind him.
@PoliticalDoggy No he really couldn't be.  He is as pathetic as anyone could reasonably be.
@TrigoAnn @CillizzaCNN Not as such...but he lied and has continually lied and is a pathological liar so he certainly fits a type.
@KarenChestney I hope he runs.
@KarenChestney Her appearance fees must have multiplied by about 100%
"The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing" Edmund Burke.  @GOP you should really take a long hard look at that quote.
@FoxNews @ChrisStirewalt @foxnewsnight a pathological liar...does not say much for West Virginia
@williamlegate @gtconway3d How does he stay married to her.
watching Fox you would think it was. slow news day...they are talking about Hollywood's new trend of Christian movies.  SMH.
@DogginTrump me too...at last evil is being pushed back a little bit and I genuinely believe it is just the beginning. Most importantly Mueller is protected  and can finish his business.
@Turnip2020 @DogginTrump Totally agree, if we rally, he is gone.
@calebcherry On days like today it its always a great laugh. It was like listening to Rush Limbaugh when Obama got elected...just good clean fun.
@maggieNYT @aravosis While I do not doubt you for a minute as you are one of the finest journalists in the country, I think the implications here are a bit greater...people are going too jail, the morale at the white house must be awful and there is moire to come. They can't govern like this.
Prat on Fox just used the word aborrent, think he meant abhorrent. They are all so dumb!
@brycetache ME TOO...Somehow today is a little bit better.
My word @RudyGiuliani is super quiet tonight. I kind off miss him.
@KevinSylliaasen @WalshFreedom @benshapiro such deadly weapons and if we cared about the born life as much as we seem to care about the unborn life we might be able to find our soul as a nation. But that is just me.
@KevinSylliaasen @WalshFreedom @benshapiro I was not specifically referring to murder but moire th value of human life. I am sure Brazil and others are worse per capita but the fact that is 33,000+ people die from guns every year in this country and that is a disgrace and we should make it harder to get
@AshaRangappa_ @aliasvaughn @CNN it is only just the beginning.
@RaulCC Nope.
@KevinSylliaasen @WalshFreedom @benshapiro Your point is ridiculous...people kill and more in the US than anywhere else in the world. Guns play a huge part in those numbers to pretend otherwise is folly. To your point if this guys in Iowa had killed Mollie with a gun that would have been understandable.  Genius!
@DearAuntCrabby @tunnell55 @politicususa @MSNBC same with CNN...finally!
@ndrew_lawrence I was just watching that...they will do anything but cover the real news today.
@KevinSylliaasen @WalshFreedom @benshapiro Yeah...how about we lessen the ability of Americans killing Americans by doing something about guns...totally avoidable.
@AnneBDep @DavidCornDC If I am  honest I have no sympathy for any of them and that includes Melania.
@bzref I just said the exact same thing to some former congressman Joe Walsh...where was his outrage then.
@AnneBDep @DavidCornDC Most likely. I can only imagine the mood on AF1 tonight. he must know that this was not a good day and can you imagine the morale in the White House. Ouch!
@DavidCornDC @AnneBDep I have been thinking the same thing all night.
@WalshFreedom @benshapiro how about the folks in Vegas, Orlando, Columbine, Virgina Tech, Sandy Hook...what about those folks...do you care about them as much as this issue which gives you illegal immigration front and center on a day that was not so good for your team. HYPOCRITE!
@AnneBDep @Amy_Siskind this congress is never going to take this stuff up. High crimes and misdemeanors...we are there already. This is collusion of a sort...crimes to effect the outcome of an election. We are there.
@AnneBDep @Amy_Siskind Agreed, but this congress is 100% complicit. This party over country has to stop. Have we heard from Ryan, McConnell, McCarthy today...I keep hearing people on TV talking about how this is an issue Congress should take up...
Genius... https://t.co/kez14lFmAI
@Amy_Siskind @AnneBDep It is worse because during Watergate there was not a complicit congress.
Fox running hard on the Iowa story and illegal immigration.
@TheGoodGodAbove @Vox_Democracy I do feel better today.
Starting today Trump is going to start regretting that ride down the escalator in 2015. He is finding out that unlike the way he conducted business he can't bully &amp; lie his way through the nations institutions &amp; people will ALWAYS put put their own self preservation above him
Happy that neither @CNN and @MSNBC are covering the Trump rally. Let's keep it that way. he does not deserve the Oxygen.
@AynRandPaulRyan I like her a lot today.
@Lawrence @StormyDaniels I think porn has come out better.
@aravosis Let's not forget this one as well...and with Amorosa coming up soon it could be an appetizer, entree, dessert and after dinner cognac kind of day.

Come on Amorosa give us the trifecta...drop us a tape.
@CillizzaCNN MAGA - My Attorney Got Arrested.
@benshapiro that you feel like that is even a question in this case here is pretty sad. He has no character, shame, conscience or any needed qualities of a human being to have empathy of any sort. Horrible little man.
@GottaLaff If he just landed how does he know what size the crowd is somewhere that he has not arrived at yet. Pathological liar.
@TheRickWilson They will focus tonight on the illegal immigrant in the Iowa case.
@CillizzaCNN and on Air Force one he was in fact, President. He should be impeached.
@PoliticalEbola @atDavidHoffman That is disappointing.
@PoliticalEbola @atDavidHoffman Manafort is a federal court, Cohen is SD NY and so not federal jurisdiction. That is my understanding.
Donie, Rudy, Sarah...anything?
@atDavidHoffman He can not pardon Cohen, Manafort yes.
@lokibeat and i cannot wait...
@Evan_McMullin the chants this November and all the way through 2020 is "we locked them up"
@CillizzaCNN Speaking of which I bumped into Gary Cole (who played Bob Russell) on Sunday at my local supermarket in Studio City and we were talking about this very subject.
Fox talking about Whitewater.
@Amy_Siskind So funny you say that...i am actually watching them now...this is great fun.
Hey @GOP what say you about today's news?
Watch Trump spin this as Manafort was found not guilty on 10 counts.
@TheRickWilson @AnneBDep You should, I already have.,

@tedlieu @Auzzielvr Exactly!  So much for the witch hunt.  Curtain coming down on this shit-show.
@CillizzaCNN There are a lot of counts.  Hoping to hear from Sarah Saunders today...should be very entertaining.
@robdogj Does seem unlikely.
@DogginTrump It is all happening today...Netflix, HBO, Amazon, Showtime or Hulu not going to have anything on the news tonight. I am committed and invested.
@robdogj Not sure that I will ever forget that line...hoping to be able to use that next time i am on a sticky wicket.
@MichaelAvenatti @sirDukeDevin @RudyGiuliani You have been right about EVERYTHING.  Run and I will vote for you.
@brianefallon @Auzzielvr Exactly.  Where is her backbone...take a look outside Susan Collins the curtain is coming down on this Trump shit-show.
@CillizzaCNN I wonder if he still wants that sit down with Mueller.
It does all make perfect sense how and why Trump has been on Twitter hyper-drive the last few days...he obviously knows what is coming.
@wvjoe911 You got to say Avanatti has been pretty spot on about everything that he has predicted.
@andylassner @sirDukeDevin @seanhannity Hopefully, he is next!
@cbpolis Thank you!
@BetteMidler well said.
@DesignationSix Bush was a bad president who made very bad decisions largely for all the wrong reason,  but Trump is a truly evil human being and his narcissism is out of control.
@wvjoe911 I would not count on it.
@DogginTrump @DougJones don't you fucking dare forget who got you where you are.
@myserenity69 @KikiAdine It is so time...we are in real trouble.
Ain’t that the truth...this is not just commentary any more this shit is getting very real.  Imagine what it all looks like if we don’t change it November and what if he got another term in 2020...think about it https://t.co/7ea9l7g08g
@ringlinringlin @AKMMitchell I think if we get caught up in details like that looking for the perfect candidate who probably does not really exist this is going to be our way of life until Jan 20th, 2025 so you tell me what you want to do and what you are prepared to take.
@DogginTrump That is quality!
@mehovic_emir @NurulNorsham That is superb!
@PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive I have finished episode 4 - the difference: while Mourinho is fining Martial for attending his child’s birth Guadiola is rallying City to win a game for the absent David De Silva as he is with his girlfriend Jessica and looking after their premature baby.  Says it all really!
@KennyWFDLive Man Utd are going to do fuck all this year.  Mourinho is a noose around that clubs neck. Watch the Amazon series All or Nothing...now that’s a fucking manager: Pep Guardiola!
@DogginTrump Not so much
@AKMMitchell if you take a walking like we did you change everyone at the top and start again. Thing about 2020 is we need someone who can take the bullying and lying of Trump.  I would not be against Michale Bloomberg either if I am honest.
@AKMMitchell I agree with all that and I love Biden but it is time for a new generation of Democrats. I honestly think that pekoes has to go as well. After 2016 there should have a been a complete and total change in leadership. Not unlike sports,
@AKMMitchell We will know more in January and even more by April. The person(s) I would like is Cory Booker and Kamela Harris.
@AKMMitchell Genuinely I don't know yet. The thing I will say is that 12 years ago Obama had not emerged, 8 years ago Romney had not emerged and this time 4 years ago Trump had not emerged.  I t will happen after the mid-terms, obviously which is where we have to be focused right now.
@PoliceUg @JoyMareeKaine1 Fucking excellent news...what about for hate crimes...there is a laundry list of things they could charge him with. Horrible human being.,..obviously a Trump supporter.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes I think he will be lucky to make to October 1st...clearly Woodward did not want to give him the money in the summer because possibly does not believe that he will be there much longer. It is 3rd season syndrome with him.
@AKMMitchell @essenviews Genuinely just don't feel it. Think he could be much more valuable in the senate...don't think he should ever have resigned in the first place.
@essenviews @AKMMitchell No but he should run again for the senate.
@osgood9 oh that is right...he got rid of Salah as well...sent him to Roma.
I meant Salah not Sarah.
@osgood9 I am watching the City documentary on Amazon and his comments about letting De Bruyne leave Chelsea are just breathtaking in their narcissism.
@osgood9 and he is genuinely running out of places to go from here. I think from here he can only go to international football.  His style of football is really painful to watch, dull as dishwater. .
@osgood9 exactly!
@osgood9 Sorry, I think he is become a toxic, bully and bore.  He is the Trump of football...thoroughly over him. How much money does he really need to play attractive football...and you can see with summer comments he is looking for his way out.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump at least they did actually fire the guy...I am no Trump defender but at least the POS is gone.
I genuinely believe that if Mourinho had Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar, Suarez, and Sarah he would still be the biggest coward in world football as to the way he plays.  He is scared to win and plays only not to lose. It is really sad and I think the game has passed him by.
@OllieHolt22 This is the start of the end.
@sandyhook @TucciKaren https://t.co/S58QIeTPID. @voteforamerica
@ananavarro Great point!  We do need to get out of our US political bubble.
@soccerdiva Toxic...great word to describe him. Just like Trump.
The @ManchesterCity documentary  on Amazon Primie fantastic BTW. What a manager Guadiola is.
For sure, if United lose this game and I honestly hope they do, it will be the game that signifies the end of Mourinho which I will also be very happy about.  Mourinho has become the Trump of football: a whining, dishonest bully, the sooner he goes the better.
@Kris_Sacrebleu Exactly!

@HoarseWisperer @MSNBC Me neither.
@brycetache @AnneBDep No time for grammar in this situation.
@CyrusMMcQueen @ainnj2 Stevie Wonder i would think but I get your point.
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive I think Spector abandoned the GOP and became a Democrat. Somebody moved from D to I...i think it might have been the guy from Maine. The Scott Brown thing certainly was not helpful.
@TrisResists @B52Malmet @AriMelber @MSNBC @ladyhawkerfinds @TheSWPrincess @Trumpet1984 @Lady_Star_Gem @DeadpoolResists @InSpiteOfTrump @Mean_Adam @LunaLuvgood2017 @lfkraus completely agree
@BrunoAmato_1 @Auzzielvr @TheLastWord @AriMelber @MSNBC WHY!  why do you give these people the voice...they have FOX.
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive But then they lost the supermajority because of either Sanders or Young who became an independent and it is always tough for Democrats especially democratic senators in red states.
@shawnwarswick @PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive remembering also that Trump won MI, WI, and PA by a combined total of 78,000...those are not big margins for a man polling at best 45%
@shawnwarswick @PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive Kenny is in Glasgow and he is irrelevant to this and he knows very little but he is in Glasgow getting chemo which should tell you everything about health care in the US!
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive The GOP is about nothing as the deficit is now proving. They are spineless and without a moral compass and this is, without doubt, the most corrupt administration of all time...
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive We are the only industrial country on the planet who does not think health care should be a right. It is appalling. If you had a sick child you might think differently.
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive I think if you ask 20 million Americans who were able to get health care despite pre-existing conditions yes I think it had a measure of success and I have not heard the GOP come up with anything to replace it.
@shawnwarswick @PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive Also, i am pretty sure the left will not be as over-confident or blaze about 2020 and as long as Bernie does not run and splits the party etc...
@shawnwarswick @PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive and they will get one. Like I have said 4, 8 and 12 years ago Obama, Romney and Trump had not emerged at this point of the cycle. Kenny is making a ridiculous point and if the economy starts heading backward look out.
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive which is why the GOP is where it is today which might seem great but there is a chance that they are going to get punished in November.  Additionally, he saved the US auto market and brought the country back from the worst economic landscape since the great depression.
@shawnwarswick @KennyWFDLive well, he got healthcare done and it only took 70+ attempts to repeal it because the GOP doesn't think people should have health care lest it is something they are missing out on...and of course that brought us the Tea Party
@KennyWFDLive know who they are so that sort of ends of that. Alternatively...if I don't love the democrat might vote Republican if John Kasich challenges and beats Trump. If the Dems win the house in November Trump might not even be there by Nov 2020.
@KennyWFDLive So, honestly don't know yet and there is nothing wrong with not knowing that at this point but if i had to mention a few names: Kamela Harris, Steve Bullock, Mitch Landrieu, Eric Holder, Sherrod Brown, Deval Patrick, Cory Booker, and Chris Murphy most of whom you will not even
@NellyMoloney @Showtime @SHO_TheAffair Donna Moss by any other name.
@PatrickHaggan @KennyWFDLive @shawnwarswick He is polling in the high 30s/low 40s not enough.
@KennyWFDLive It is not one year to go...
@aliasvaughn @MSNBC Agreed, i cannot believe that they do this.
@dodo @Auzzielvr awesome.
@RWitherspoon @HBO When is it slated to come out?
@Joca9_De_Sousa well at least they are old enough to vote...
@KennyWFDLive winter and Spring of 2019 is when people will emerge, try and gown up and understand. This time 4 years ago Trump had not emerged this time 8 years ago Romney had not emerged and this time in 2006 Obama had not emerged...get the pattern. Well done.
@KennyWFDLive And if your ability to read and then understand what you are reading has not been impaired I will tell you yet again that it is too early to know that. Once the mid-terms are over and we see the results things will clear up. Iowa and New Hampshire are not until Jan/Feb of 2020...
3/3 Because if it does not go the right way it might well be your last opportunity to actually exercise your right to vote.
2/3 Please avail yourself of this incredible service because as @jonlovett said last night on Colbert last night this is the most important mid-term election in the country's history.
1/3 If you are not registered to vote please visit https://t.co/ebaeIgYMiH. There are no excuses now. This site set up by @PodSaveAmerica will register you to vote and even show you what your sample ballot will look like before you go to vote in November.
@Itsmiketheboxer @benshapiro Rafa Benitez.
@KennyWFDLive to factor in all the people who are beyond embarrassed by him and those numbers are pretty large.
@KennyWFDLive folks out there who are moving from GOP to Dem than in reverse. You are approach is so childlike as to be utterly pathetic. Someone will emerge...it is too early to know who and if the economy in the next 12-18 months does not stay where it is then he is toast because he has
@KennyWFDLive It is not a prize fight...you have to understand the state of the electorate. You are approaching it like a total child as if its a fight at recess. He won WI, MI, and PA by a total of 78,000 votes, possibly some delivered with the help of the Russians. And there are a lot more
This is great! https://t.co/pEEroK0hG9
@tiniebeany @CNN @MSNBC This is the thing...why does CNN and MSNBC do this shit. Stop giving them oxygen, stop covering these people, stop covering this Presidents every move...he is unworthy of the attention.
@KennyWFDLive Great retort...Scotland invented everything, thanks for setting us straight on that one.
@KennyWFDLive Until you play anyone...such is Scottish football.
@KennyWFDLive that there was in 2016. So we will see. But sitting in Glasgow wondering who will emerge from the democratic pool before the mid-terms...very insightful
@KennyWFDLive point to his divisions and his bigotry, thinking he is above the law etc...also you are a fool if you do not think that 78,000 people across WI, PA, OH and MI think they might have made a mistake and I do not believe there will be the apathy or mover confidence from the left
@KennyWFDLive All I will say Kenny is that if you support him then I consider you the bigot that he is. Like I said this time 4 years ago Trump had not emerged, this time 11-12 years ago Obama had not emerge. I have no idea who will come out to challenge him but someone will and they will
@KennyWFDLive like you and claim that that they are reason that you don't have a job or for your lot in life. He has done noting but divide this country more and more. But support him if you must.
@KennyWFDLive and btw nobody questioning that he won, yes he did which shows have depraved this country has become. He is behaving in exactly the same way that Hitler did: divide, call the media the enemy and point your finger at anybody who doesn't look
@KennyWFDLive dividing the country as far and wide as he can. But you are right he is great guy and what a great president.  He believes in nothing and cares about nothing but himself. He is a disgrace not just as a president but as a human being.
@KennyWFDLive with the help of the Russians and he does not seem to care that the country has been compromised.  Housing starts are down, inflation is on its way, the deficit is hurtling its way through $21 trillion due to tax cuts, he doesn't believe in anything but stirring up bigotry and
@DogginTrump You mean convicted...he is been indicted.
@KennyWFDLive clearly collaborated and yet he does not seem to have any problem with it...his ego is so enormous that he will put himself above the country...I can see why you would like him. Clusless, the both of you.
@KennyWFDLive It is 2 1/2 years until the next general. This time 4 years ago Trump was not in the ring and 11 years ago Obama wasn't so what are you babbling about. After the mid-terms someone will emerge. And as for your other crap...he was helped by the Russians to win,
@garyrind @KennyWFDLive I get that.  The Dems in the US would be conservatives in the UK.  The GOP here are the party of Mussolini.
@KennyWFDLive Take a page out of their book then...
@mimmibums @Smilingl8dy I can’t watch that.  Horrible people!
@Emolclause @SenatorCollins Complete chicken, coward and complicit traitor.
@AllensOpEd @dmcrane I agree.
@VABVOX @NannaDem @MaxineWaters fair point.
@DisavowTrump20 @TGIFrani she is not just bad for our democracy...she is a bad and evil human being just like the man she represents and lies for.
@_SJPeace_ WOW fucking WOW!  I'm speechless that there are still people who think this is Ok &amp; that Trump is not responsible for this brazen bigotry openly displayed towards other Americans on the basis of skin color.. This country has lost its core, its soul, it's heart &amp; it's conscience.
@NannaDem @VABVOX @MaxineWaters I mean genuinely...look at Sarah Sanders at 36 and Maxine Waters at 80...
@KennyWFDLive The truth will genuinely set you free.  And not to mention what a fucking bigot he is. Open your eyes.
@KennyWFDLive His acts are treasonous and that you can't see that is not at all my problem....he is a wretched human being and now he is creating an enemies list just like Nixon. Wake up mate, I know you are in Scotland but trying watching something other than Fox News.
@KennyWFDLive even if he genuinely had nothing to do with the Russians/the election...the fact that he does not even care that they were involved with manipulating the election is high treason, not to mention his performance in Helsinki.
@KennyWFDLive Load of crap...it s not that he is a bad president or his policies are it is that he is an awful human being. The most narcissistic human being ever. He cares more about himself than he does about anyone or anything including the country that he is supposed to be protecting.
@VABVOX @NannaDem @MaxineWaters she looks amazing!
@FOXSoccer ugly
@KennyWFDLive Yes, quite right Kenny...we all should watch Fox News. You are clueless.
@kylegriffin1 drip, drip, drip, drip
@RepMaxineWaters Agreed.  It is all bullshit.
@JanzforCongress @dmcrane How is this race tied...insanity.  Jana should be up by 20.
@realDonaldTrump Convince yourself...
@JeffFlake @DawnBranciforte You are a republican why don’t you stand up for something like not voting for Kavanugh.
@Susan_Hennessey I wouldn’t count on it if I am honest. It will be said that he said it before elected and doesn’t count just  like all the affairs
@KennyWFDLive @DFImpressionist Fucking quality!
@KennyWFDLive @YouTube As I was writing that I started to think that I was sure he was already dead and of course and then checked...duh.
@kashanacauley @RepubsRScum Yeah, we are really overachieving at the moment...
@ochocinco Quality
@KennyWFDLive @YouTube Yikes, I worked with him when he was part 213...and then with Warren G when I was at Restless Records. This is sad news.
@PattiKimble @mterr337 That is so sad. May she RIP.
@KennyWFDLive @Pr1nceOfDarknes @GersRafa @RobertWFD Genius!
@briantashman @brianbeutler You can't make this shit up...nobody would believe it.
@slpng_giants Good job.
@adamcbest Ok so I do not believe Biden, Warren or Sanders are viable st all. I would not mind seeing Bloomberg or Eric Holder run.
@realDonaldTrump You hired her.
@NWPinPDX @TrinityResists @ListenToEzra @TheSWPrincess @DearAuntCrabby @Cruellaisdevine @Augustus709 @debbiesideris @MamaRose2017 @MatthewWolfff @B52Malmet way past time.
@brianbeutler Exactly.  The things about him are that he behaves in such a guilty manner. He is always fighting off so many legitimate accusations that he will take validation from anywhere he can get it and how is a reality TV producer able to just get hold of  POTUS. Priorities Donnie
@CillizzaCNN Correct. No chance he would mention McCain...it might have taken some of the spotlight from him and he would never allow that no matter who it was.
@DogginTrump @tunnell55 Sorry and this is not meant to be as mean as it is going to come across but she looks a lot older than 36. She is not doing Trump's bidding without a cost or wearing it well.
@notpeterstrzok It is not promising.
@HuffPost and the guy said that he could fit two of them in his mouth.  SBC is making fools out of people especially the glazed over right-wing nutcases.
@DogginTrump In fucking Century City, California, about 2 miles from where I am writing this right now. I am just astounded at the depravity of this country at the moment. It is truly sickening bad all these people have been emboldened by this sick orange man. VOTE people.
@rsg Wow, that is a bold move.  What will Thanksgiving be like in your house this year. Good for you...I fully support you on this.
@gblanstonku @Amy_Siskind That was quality. I took a screen shot of the guy with his mouth full and it’s hysterical.
@mrdonduck @Amy_Siskind Incredibly dumb. They are having a field day with it in Israel.
@Amy_Siskind @ThugLifeSocial @SachaBaronCohen Me too
@davidfrum @DonCheadle It is in a state that he knows he will never win so he doesn't care. Literally, he doesn't care, it is all part of his narcissism. He doesn't care about anyone but himself and using his base to be adored. He is a really sick human being. BTW, great piece in The Atlantic.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes and the captain's armband and then he can make stupid trips back and forward from the US and Europe to take 3-minute cameo appearances so he can rack up the caps...seem to remember someone else behaving like that.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes apparently.
@geoff9cow @NancyLeeGrahn @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP @TheDemocrats Don't boo, vote. I could have sworn I heard someone say that once.
@RBHamerica @aliasvaughn I mean I am not going anywhere but on Friday night I stayed home and just watched old Obama speeches and town halls and my despair at where we are, has never been more rock bottom or distraught. It was my pleasure to serve the country but I am just astounded at where we are.
@KamalaHarris @frank754 when will you be announcing your candidacy for POTUS. By 2020 you will have been in the senate the exact amount of time that Obama was when he ran and that worked out pretty well.
and equally as dumb.
@wordsmithviv @AnneBDep YES - and more importantly...by the time we get to 2020 she will have been in the senate the exact same amount of time that Barack Obama had been in the senate when he ran and as I recall that worked out pretty well.
@aliasvaughn I came to this country 36 years ago from the UK and the first thing I did was join the US Army and all I can think of now is for what.  I am embarrassed of the US.
@bjcreigh @tunnell55 @TheChickLivesOn @TheUSASingers @Lady_Star_Gem @gordy_shanks @Bornabrit1 @pebbles9010 @3RiC_S74NL3Y_2 It really does...some of the most hideous and unattractive folks I have ever seen.
@aliasvaughn You make 8 incredibly good and credible points. Thanks for spelling it out. What. shit show this country is.
@DavidCornDC @B52Malmet what about the biker who has the SS 'logo' on his arm.
@PeopleTrumped @karenhunter Fucking wow...and that is who the Orange buffoon is entertaining...I am gobsmacked...plus a new CBS poll that says that 83% of Republicans approve of the Orange buffoons handling of racial issues.
@FaceTheNation How sad is that as a statement about the country.
@kathygriffin @karenhunter No he didn't.
@Dcl_60 @tunnell55 Could not agree more.
@KennyWFDLive He is fucked now on 17.
@miss9afi yes...is he going to help?
@jimmy9 @arlowhite Great photo.
@soccerdiva Emery Out!
@totalBarca Very excited but nervous to watch Barca for the first time without Andres Iniesta.
@MenInBlazers They still might
@_PaulHayward Agreed.  It’s pretty ridiculous given there is no major tournament next summer.
@dkmarr64 I have never loved Adam Raised the Cain but everything else is pitch perfect.
@karenhunter @aljackson Me too!
@TheCenteredEgg @tunnell55 No kidding...my Xanax and Ambien along could keep a small country going.
@WendellPierce @Our4thEstate And if they do then you need to own it, but if they don’t then make a stand.
@dkmarr64 If I had to chose...it’s my favorite Bruce album...with Racing in the Streets being the stand out song.
@SarahTreem @SHO_TheAffair Say it ain’t so about Allison!
@dkmarr64 Great song!
@realDonaldTrump Liar
@ms_mims Exactly, I watched the town hall he did with students in London in April 2016, the speech from the night he got elected, the Sandy Hook day, the Selma March and the Charleston speech.  He was magic. BTW EveNewtonJobs is just an ode to Apple, my name is actually Steven.
@NewtownAction @Weinsteinlaw @Twitter @infowars Disgraceful!
@krassenstein @mariaminerd1 @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Literally there is no point in spouting this stuff anyone...the thing to do now ism to do something about it. Don't boo, vote...that is the only message that we have too get out there. 2016 is over, 2018 is ahead as is 2020...that is where the focus needs to be.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes It is actually pretty good.
@NicolleDWallace @Elise_Jordan Listened to it this morning while hiking and it was great. Looking forward to Monday's episode.
is the Spanish Super Cup not on TV tomorrow or is that ESPN+ as well?
@marycmccormack @cmclymer @JasonKander @MomsDemand @Everytown Mine too. His podcast @Majority54 is a must listen.
@melhoop10 @AdamParkhomenko what US government? The US government is the Russian government.
@KennyWFDLive ...and the teeth. Still haunted by the free-kick vs Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the CL in 2005.
@SaraTaksler Would be interested in what else you have done.
@SaraTaksler interesting how I found it: I work in podcasting with Cadence13 and the Crooked Media guys &amp; @TVietor08 had @Byoussef on @PodSavetheWorld. From that I heard that Bassam had a podcast etc...great content begets great content. You did a wonderful job, thanks for telling the story
Quiet night, taking a trip down memory lane with a bunch of PBO's speeches &amp; town hall meetings &amp; just struck by his dignity &amp; intellect in stark contrast of the buffoon in office today who could never hold one of these town hall meetings due to his utter lack of intellect.
@KellysBarNYC @First_Touch Woof!
Spot on! https://t.co/IB9b8E0DQp
Where are the Republicans on this issue...crickets. #countrybeforeparty https://t.co/xCTA43iTHS
@RealMuckmaker Bad
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Mourinho’s days are numbered.
@totalBarca NOT FOR SALE!
@wvjoe911 How sad for them! I really don’t care, do you?
@KennyWFDLive And then play the most boring football on the planet. He is well passed his sell by date and is already engineering his exit from OT. Same old playbook from JM. Boring!
@Delavegalaw @laureldavilacpa Agreed. There is no way he wants this meeting.
@jonlovett @facebook @Ocasio2018 It was a great interview btw. She is spectacular.
@GovHowardDean @debbiesideris why is it taking so long to count them?
@SaraTaksler I loved Tickling Giants.  Wonderfully made and told. Thank you.
@dodo @AnimalAid_India wonderful
@CillizzaCNN YUP!  A religious experience!
RT @naretevduorp: .@SusanSarandon and any "Bernie or Bust" types who STILL think you did the right thing not supporting @HillaryClinton - P…
@StopTrump2020 and sadism!  That is the thing with him and Trump...they enjoy the misery they heap peoples lives...their racism is just a proven fact.
@FOXSoccer @NavasKeylor In recent years i have not been that impressed with Courtois so RM can have him.
@katienolan Did not take you for a soccer fan...but Mo Salah is pretty good although sadly he plays for Liverpool.
@OregonJOBS2 Accept
@shannoncoulter Agreed.
@TVietor08 @Tickling_Giants @Byoussef Watching it right now.
@Byoussef Amazing interview with @TVietor08 on @PodSavetheWorld.
@joncoopertweets Robert Mueller should get it.
@dannyoconnor1 @joncoopertweets Please, if you are in the Ohio 12th go vote for Danny O'Connor. The country does not have to feel like this. Show America that Trump is not what we believe in.
@amazinmikey @realDonaldTrump WINNING!
@Ocasio2018 absolutely agree. She is a superstar and rising fast. She is the change we need.
@sjredmond @nanaguerrax7 Correct and it really shows the deep level of depravity within these people. There are first and foremost sadists...they enjoy the pain that they inflict.
One can only hope.
@BryanDawsonUSA Yes he did and well tough to deny he hasn't won.
@ChrisMurphyCT @bbkenn92 or why so many people do not understand the first amendment. Seems that a lot  folks don't realize that the 1st amendment applies to the government not private or public corporations.
@Lady_Star_Gem @mariaminerd1 @realDonaldTrump Robert Mueller
@ezraklein Well said Ezra.
@BlueWaveCS Well said.  Don't boo, vote...I am sure I heard someone say that once @BarackObama
@TinaMorphis That is progress.
@KennyWFDLive @Malachians @Pr1nceOfDarknes @RobertWFD @GersRafa That is quality!  Seen it before but never gets old.
@benshapiro Perhaps listen to her in totality before passing such ignorant comments. Perhaps try @PodSaveAmerica from yesterday...you know a show that has got a clue.
@44mmvvpp EXCELLENT. It was only a matter of time before someone literally took a shit on it if they have not already.
@CillizzaCNN he is going to sing like a canary.
@shannoncoulter Agreed and that they are genuine media companies who do not have to indulge hate speech.  I am feeling pretty good about this today.
@shannoncoulter @facebook @YouTube @Spotify and @apple who dumped him and started this domino effect.
@StopTrump2020 Class
@KennyWFDLive @YouTube Ok, they are the best club ever my bad.
@BarbraStreisand Well, the wildfires are in CA a state that he knows he will never win and the comments about Lebron are made because he is a bigot and cannot stand anyone else getting any attention other than him. HRC got it right, he and his supports are deplorable...just a fact.
@KennyWFDLive @YouTube Yeah but that domestic club plays in Scotland so...not so much.
@krassenstein @amazinmikey @RealAlexJones I don't but I would now like Facebook to make his ban permanent.
Quality! https://t.co/qAosYOrast
@away Thanks!
@TSearcaigh Let’s target now.
@away Hi @away,thanks for that. I love your stuff but this did happen to me flying from Phili to LA two weeks ago which was a drag. Actually my name is Steven, the twitter handle is just an ode to Apple.
@Bornabrit1 @tart_manchester Two words that aptly describe him.
@thehill Good!
@boston042169 @emmyrossum It is the issue this happened to me two weeks with the same luggage.
@emmyrossum @away I got asked this when I was flying back east recently with my @away carry on...due the charging battery where you can charge your phone they are seeing it as a potential "risk."
@benshapiro He is your guy!
@HamillHimself @MiltShook @BarackObama And it’s his birthday
Happy birthday to @BarackObama, the best President of my lifetime. Who reminds me what class, intellect, and family really mean. We miss you more than you can possibly know and more than words can describe. Have a great day Mr.President,
@barcagonzo Me neither. I will go hiking with my dog.
What channel in the US is the Community Shield on tomorrow morning?  Asking for a friend.
@sidlowe But does he fit?
@soledadobrien Agreed!
@CillizzaCNN So that should tell you everything: we are not a healthy democracy and we are not the "greatest" country in the world...in fact, we are far from it!
@VandelayNdustry @DonCheadle That is a great analogy.
@CillizzaCNN what an imbecile.
@wvjoe911 what a shame.
@BetteMidler To be fair it is not actually him.
@ItsMeCathi Well done.
@DonCheadle No, he doesnt...its all bullshit...he has no interest in talking Mueller or his team because it on loy gets him in deeper because he can't shut his mouth. He is a moron and his lawyers know it.
@BarcaUniversal No
@SallyQYates @Kris_Sacrebleu and it is. People think that fascism is something that is not here one day and here the next. It is a slow process that takes chunks bit by bit by bit until you don't really notice whats being taken. Wake up America before its too late.
@benshapiro @JacobKaplan5 It really isn't by a long way. Boring as watching paint dry until the middle of September.
@EvelynALizette @realDonaldTrump @GOP So good to hear, where are the rest of your people.
@RWitherspoon @SetItUpNetflix I saw that and really enjoyed it.  When does BLLs season 2 come out?  Asking for a friend.
@RaulCC @Pr1nceOfDarknes You are very kind but I am just a spectator these days.
@tizzywoman @Wanderer19 Thank you for this.
The World Cup has been over for 15 days and it was so good i know am counting down the 11 days until the start of the Premier League and the 19 days until the start of La Liga. This ICC stuff going on in the US is utter crap...bring on the real stuff.
@BarcaUniversal That would be interesting.
@TomHall @BMGPM That is just quite simply wonderful, beautifully, extraordinary and any other adjective you can come up with to describe selflessness.
@jfreewright We better hope...
@crymeariver6666 @realDonaldTrump You are not crazy at all.
@mterr337 No.
@wvjoe911 and the love that poured forth towards President Obama based on the color of his skin from the right was far worse and the bottom line is that trump is a shocking human being and the hatred is well deserved.
@keanothedog @oldmillstream @DonaldJTrumpJr quality
Shine some light into your day...this is stunning and beautiful	https://t.co/JGxDxjfYMO
@NellyMoloney It is amazing show. I am loving season 4 at the moment!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes, we don't care for him...not breaking news.
@wvjoe911 Me too.
this was meant to say that it should NOT take 12 hours to get across the country.
@JustChrisByrd @BarcaUniversal He is epic...and he can play a bit of football. I wish he had chosen to play for Spain
@BarcaUniversal Stunning...and to think he is pretty good at football as well.
@TeaLeoni @Donna_West @HillaryClinton @madeleine Nice one!  One of the very few network shows that I watch.
It should take the best part of 12 hours to get across the country. Between the insane heatwave in the west and the rain in the east lets just pretend global warning is fake for a little bit longer. WTF is wrong with this country right now.
Yup! https://t.co/mu6z84wdms
@stonecold2050 @amazinmikey That is brilliant!
@soledadobrien Exactly.
@samstein without any question!
@shannoncoulter 100% correct Shannon.
@jimjefferies Fuck yes!
@DavidGr78574965 @realDonaldTrump To be fair and I am a dem and a huge obamaite but he should have just done it.  The GOP were never going to do the right thing.
@HananyaNaftali Unimaginable grief. May he RIP
@HarleyRouda And that is why I am supporting you, contributing and was at your fundraiser in Brentwood!
@BarcaUniversal Not sure he is worth that.
@benshapiro I always wonder why you can’t focus on the issues at hand. Obama has not been potus for 18 months and it’s a legitimate question to ask whether Trump is compromised. Monday’s debacle suggests he might be.
@bigbarkerusa @steenstra66 Where is this? I am looking for a friend for my dog Lucy. I am in Southern California.
RT @ladiesgun: https://t.co/FIax6jx9vy
@CillizzaCNN Just common courtesy.
@HananyaNaftali very but it does not mean that I agree with everything that the Israeli government does. Not a fan of BiBi.
@ToDropADime2 I genuinely believe it would have no effect.
@CillizzaCNN @ForecasterEnten Only one I am interested in is Harris.
@NeilSpyBarnett @ChelseaFC Sorry to hear this Neil. However, after the club threw me under a bus in 2009 I am not surprised.
@KennyWFDLive @bzref @Pr1nceOfDarknes I am not surprised.
@biannagolodryga @Billbrowder well, i think that was Monday.
@MarkDuplass @benshapiro He is actually a practical conservative.
@SonnyBunch @DR9214N fucking incredible
@britttd Thank you so much.
@Amy_Siskind @taiping2 This is just like Charlottesville. He is as dumb as he can be, then they make him read a script walking it back and as soon as he is near another microphone he will be at it again.  Coward and a traitor...quite the combination is this President.
@MarkWarner He is a coward @realDonaldTrump
@KennyWFDLive which is a serious breech of his oath of office. This is not even up for debate. He is a fool, he is unfit to serve and he is a national and global embarrassment.
@KennyWFDLive Yes I am absolutely saying that he is a traitor. His performance in Helsinki was disgraceful and disgusting and driven only by his ego because he believes that if he admits to what is plainly obvious then his presidency is delegitimized...that is putting himself
Kompromat - a word we are going to hear a lot over the next few days.
@SallyQYates @bbkenn92 Please run for President!
@naretevduorp @joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump subpoena the translators.
@HananyaNaftali boker tov.
@WalshFreedom about fucking time.
@PeggyStuart Brilliant!
@PreetBharara @PizzaGirl78 well said @PreetBharara
@HawaiiDelilah You are so right.
@RepMarinochick Twat!
You can dislike her but she wasn't wrong. https://t.co/bN0ZO0Orct
@HawaiiDelilah and the only credible way to do it but it has to be done. Don't boo, vote...i am sure i heard someone say that once.
@BillyBaldwin if today does not do it then nothing will...the soul of this nation is dead.
@SarahKSilverman @SachaBaronCohen He is a genius.
@KennyWFDLive Maybe one of the most useless arguments ever made trying to defend someone who is nothing short of a traitor.  You should stay where you are mate.
@sidlowe It really does...nothing seems very good or right...something is missing.
@Amy_Siskind @supertaschablue Could not have said it better myself!
This is fabulous! https://t.co/HzQfPifaGR
@KennyWFDLive Settle down
@RWitherspoon Brilliant. Allez Les Blues.
@PrnceOfDrknsUS @hands575 @KennyWFDLive @Spina13Colada Love the Bruce photo.
@CeltlfcDave @KennyWFDLive whats the podcast?
@VandelayNdustry @Pr1nceOfDarknes Thank you.
@yvesrathle Me too. I watched 62 of the 64
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Nonsense.
@English_AS His speed is frightening.
@jimjefferies How awesome is she! And she flew coach to get to Russia.
Best World Cup ever!  Qatar has a lot to live up to. https://t.co/tEANjSOCVd
@KennyWFDLive Indeed!
@OllieHolt22 No question
Congrats France.  I am just so bummed it’s all over. Best World Cup ever!
Great goal!
@Pr1nceOfDarknes It was a dive
@DR9214N Agreed
@CBurleyESPN Yeah but in the end the played 7 and lost 3.  Man management much much better but they still lack the tactical and technical abuse on the pitch.
@soccerdiva That is harsh.
Thank goodness that is over #ENGBEL. What a completely meaningless game.
This is a wonderful read. https://t.co/bKdSZVGq4u
@bill_buford Fabulous piece!
Very hard to argue with this overall. https://t.co/tcbsjQSJS7
@KennyWFDLive @Pr1nceOfDarknes @RobertWFD We were good even if I do say so, and for the US I agree I have not heard anything that was as good.  I do like ESPNFC though...talking of a lot Scots.
@TSearcaigh @GOP well said.
@karaswisher It is a great city. Was there in Dec 2016 and loved it. Best places on earth: Paris, Melbourne and Tel Aviv.
@HananyaNaftali @ynkutner wow I was just there last week. Love that market and ate at a great restaurant in the market called the Shookchaka.  Tel Aviv without question the most progressive city in the western world.
@The_UnSilent_ &amp; we are the greatest country in the world don't you know! Also the only country that allows corporations to lobby the government so that they can put whatever they like in our food creating the worlds most obese country but don't feel that healthcare is a universal right.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes great question
@sidlowe I do take glee from it.  He only has himself to blame.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes You missed little
Too slow by England already #EnglandvsSweden

Come on England!
@KennyWFDLive No chance
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Are you in LA?
@KennyWFDLive Hope you are right.
@KennyWFDLive I agree totally. I was begging for Brazil to go out and I am glad they have.
How is the Civil War going that moron  Alex Jones predicted the Democrats were planning for July 4th...I am out of the country so looking for news on how it’s going and when I can come back.
@SocialBarca_10 It worked to be honest.
Great time in one of my favorite cities in the world - Tel Aviv @ Tel Aviv, Israel https://t.co/iArhTjt0nZ
So now England would want to win vs. Belgium because then it would be Japan and then either Sweden/Switzerland in 1/4 Finals.  Best World Cup EVER.
@kylegriffin1 @frank754 Lets hope he keeps his word.
@fordm You are so unbelievably right. The dems are sanctioning Maxine Waters on a. day who SCOTUS is going to be gone for a couple of generations. The dems are hopeless at this point and I am one of them.
@JoyceWhiteVance That is what is wrong with the Democratic Party: they are wasting their time on this shit on a day that SCOTUS is going to be changed for a couple generation. Outside of not trump I have no idea what the dems actually stand for.
@brianefallon @danpfeiffer How exactly...we are in the minority.
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics Good.
@jztimm And I think France v Argentina should be much better than people think.
Not sure how excited I am for Sweden v Switzerland in the round of 16.
@totalBarca Drop him...he is too slow for this level.
@CillizzaCNN It doesn’t work.
@KennyWFDLive So far the best World Cup I can remember...but I am old.
Argentina have been awful be sure but France have showed me very little. You never know.
@KennyWFDLive I think VAR has been a great revelation. Its about time.
@barcagalaxy Go get 'em.
I would anything for VAR to award a penalty...for anything in #DENFRA.	Come on VAR, sort us out.
So #DENFRA are going to ruin the streak of no nil nil draws.  This is possibly the worst game of the tournament and after yesterday's craziness it is glaring.
@scottpiro I certainly hope so. I was here last summer as well...need me some Tel-Aviv. Cannot wait to get back there. Hope all is well with you. Great photos.
@CillizzaCNN could not agree with you more.
@sidlowe That was a great piece
@michelleinbklyn Wonderful piece you wrote.  Thank you. Spot on I might add.
@ImaGroucho @TwinTurboTeban @KenidraRWoods_ ...and in California, Southern California, from LA.  I am just blown away that this is happening.
@Richard_Fitz Great piece.
@scottpiro Hey how are you doing Scott.  We met 6 years ago getting off a plane from Israel which is actually where I am going back to on Thursday. Hope you are well...I am feeling the same way btw.
@djangostone @Pr1nceOfDarknes Yup
@Pr1nceOfDarknes I genuinely think VAR has been a revelation. I love it. It is adding to the game not subtracting.
@sidlowe Totally agree!  The best of my life so far. At least 8 could win it, I love VAR, and the drama has been amazing.  It has had everything to the point.
@paulfrommonaco all that matters is that the right decision is reached...I think it has created GREAT drama like the Hawkeye does in tennis and Cricket.  Amazing World Cup so far.
So far...this is the best World Cup I can remember and I think VAR has really been an excellent addition to the game.
@totalBarca what a World Cup!
De Gea not having a great World Cup #ESPMAR
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Belgium maybe...I am still not sold on England...not yet.
@Nubia63802943 Exactly, I take no offense nor do I feel responsible for the dispicable behavior of others like Drumpf just because they are white, it’s just unfortunate.
Before that just happened I was just about to write that Poland is really poor #POLCOL
RT @John_C_Catsh: I never beg for retweets, but here I am, begging for retweets. Dan  Savage suggested that we hold #FoxNews accountable fo…
@davidaxelrod @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Oh come on...people standing up for what they see as right &amp; proper and any business owner is allowed to refuse service for whatever reason in this country including sexual orientation. Would you serve Hitler?
@TheScottCharles @Maggyw519 I am boycotting the nfl.
@JimmyHessel @redmond_peter genius.
@poop_weasel @gregstevens I said both.
@barcagalaxy 1/16
Excellent John. https://t.co/xT8MT4MgGb
@arlowhite @JKCorden @vardy7 excellent stuff Arlo.
@ananavarro EXACTLY!
@jelliott62280 @RaeComm clearly.
@jelliott62280 @RaeComm That is really poor. It is a World Cup!
@jelliott62280 @RaeComm genuinely?
Love it when @RaeComm uses the word section rather than group.
@CillizzaCNN which genuinely says more about the US than England.
@RaeComm Such a pleasure hearing you for this World Cup. The best by a country mile. QQ: are you actually in Russia or are you in a studio in the US. Some are suggesting some of the commentators are not actually in country.
@Tim_Vickery exactly Tim.  Just what I have been saying since this game started.
@RealMuckmaker @DearAuntCrabby You are missing Melania.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes it is going to be 7 or 8.
@KennyWFDLive I actually still think England look very poor in midfield...Panama are about as shocking as it gets and ton thinks they are here instead off the US is a sobering thought moving forward.
@BroadcastMoose and to think they are here instead of the US is a bit sobering.
#EnglandvPanama could be a cricket score. Kane tied with Ronaldo and Lukukua for Golden Boot.
@MirrorDarren they are taking liberties just being at this World Cup.
@BroadcastMoose they really are...shockingly bad.
@KennyWFDLive about to be 5-0
@AriFleischer How lame are you that you don't see what a ridiculous tweet this is. Even the POTUS that worked for thinks things this POTUS is a disgrace and btw if a baker can choose who to baker a cake for based on sexual orientation...well do I need to go any further.
@joncoopertweets I really don't care, do you?
@RedHenLex Well done.if people can refuse to make a cake because of people's sexual orientation then people are allowed to refuse service to hate mongering racists. I applaud you and if ever in Lexington, VA save me a place at the bar.
@ananavarro @PressSec I really don't care, do you.
@CNNPolitics I really don't care, do you.
@edub130 @AKMMitchell I really don't care, do you?
@sidlowe They are cool. How far can Spain go Sid?
@SocialBarca_10 I would be better in goal.
@KennyWFDLive Very much so.
@shannoncoulter I am with you.
@dogz005 Understood but where are the rest...there should be a fund of $500m...Zuckerberg at the very least owes us big time.
#GERSWE -the whitest game in history.
@davidaxelrod Good for him.  Where are the other left leaning billionaires doing something about it like Gates, Zuckerberg, Buffet, Cook, Bezos etc... between them they could come up with $500 million.
Sorry @FOXSports the unobjective homerism of the announcers for #MexicoVskorea  is really unnecessary.
@soledadobrien @radum27 If someone can refuse to make a cake based on sexual orientation why can’t someone refuse to serve someone based on where they CHOSE to work.
Why does @FOXSports not put on the screen every players club team when they feature a player in this World Cup in a game. It’s broadcasting 101. If it was an American sport they would mention what school each player went to.
@PressSec @KarsinXXX @POTUS Warms my heart that hear this.  Well done!
@tribelaw you better be right.
@thelittlepakeha @artiep @acharya_dude @TaylorDesloge @MichaelSocolow @tomricks1 That would not work either. I am an immigrant from the UK, been here 36 Years, served in the US Army and I don’t carry my birth certificate.  This is all crazy.
@SocialBarca_10 Argentina are genuinely not good enough to beat Nigeria and I don't think any of them want a 4th game.
@SocialBarca_10 Agreed.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes I can't believe how bad Argentina are.
@MarkCStanley Not these days.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes it was great!
@barcagalaxy I wish he had chosen to play for Spain when he had the chance. I can't believe with the talent they have they are an incredibly average team and wait for Messi to do it all.
@therealroseanne no but what I will do is unfollow your racist ass.
The beautiful game. https://t.co/dSvexSSa0Z
@SIR__BOO so are these commentators.
@goal @petermstaunton No.
@JasonKander @Majority54 When are are you announcing your run for the Presidency? I am not kidding, a lot of people looking to you Mr. Kander.
The beautiful game. https://t.co/r9ehwPka2x
Re: #ARGICE game:  You will win nothing with Caballero as your keeper, Messi penalty was dreadful, Baffles me that a team with Aguerro, Di Maria, Messi etc...cannot play together and score more goals. They sit around waiting for Messi to do it on his own. Should have chose Spain.
@Tim_Vickery Never a penalty. Have no idea what they were looking at.
@sidlowe Indeed.
The @Fox commentators for the #PERDEN are so biased against Denmark and just seem to love Peru to an insane degree.  Great #WorldCup so far.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes It really is/was.
Not a bad World Cup so far. #PORvESP what a game.
@JamesTylerESPN Preview shows on TV and podcasts.
@Mastermind7864 AMEN!
@BlueGhost40_ nice grammar on the "your on camera" sign behind this asshole.
@joncoopertweets But could have said something meaningful.
@SteveSchmidtSES Agreed! Love De Niro but this just plays into Trumps sweet spot.
@wvjoe911 Nay. Love Joe but we have got to find the next generation of democratic leaders.
@CillizzaCNN a renaissance painting.
@NathanHRubin @mahilena That is right...don't boo vote. I am sure I heard someone say that @BarackObama
@SarahKSilverman How right you are. He is just the best ever...wish he had played the whole song though. And BTW @BruceonBroadway is a superb show.
BBRRUUCCEE on the Tonys.
This could not have been said any better.  Great piece. https://t.co/XCOQ4ddQKP
@bill_buford I meant "Amongst The Thugs" of course.
@goldengateblond It really is.  I thought that as well.
@bill_buford I know you from Among The Thugs, you were once a guest on my radio show World Soccer Daily but loved seeing and hearing you with @donlemon on @CNN tonight to talk about Anthony Bourdain. Much love.
@kanewman yeah, bummer for him.
@The1DonnyV do some research...there is plenty of information out there. I have nothing to tell you beyond the fact that I do not believe it was terrorist incident but rather a weather incident. Been to Gander in December? I have , it snows. They needed to deice the wings.
@The1DonnyV what are you looking for?  It was my unit, I was in Sinai with them and got taken off of the flight 3 days before it left because the commander needed me to do him a favor in Israel.
@HarleyRouda @HamillHimself Nice one.
@barcagalaxy Yes please. He is much more the heir to Iniesta than Coutinho I think.  I wanted him to stay at Barca for when Xavi left but I would love him to come back.
@kazweida @KarsinXXX Yup!  Where are my 45s.
@HarleyRouda Good luck tomorrow. Enjoyed meeting you at the fundraiser in Brentwood a couple weeks ago.
@Tougher_TT_Rest 40 years old today.
@AidenWolfe Once
Well said. https://t.co/Q4whBOSGqk
@PodSaveAmerica guys wrapping up today’s episode from @Cadence13_ LA office studios. https://t.co/8mDDM96f8t
@PatCunnane @Maggyw519 @realDonaldTrump BTW more than died on 9/11 just for some perspective.
@4YrsToday @mariaminerd1 for what exactly.
@jimrome agreed.
Do you have
@SInow Cannot believe how bad the Warriors are playing, they look totally uninterested.
The Warriors locker room is going to be an interesting place to be at half-time.
@RealSkipBayless @SIR__BOO unfair...his performance in every game prior to this has been amazing. He is having an awful game tonight.
@Kennymack1971 They really do and I cannot believe how the absence of Igadelo has totally changed this team in the last 4 games.
@creynoldsnc I agree with you...I think people are projecting to 2020 and wondering who on the Dem side will take on this buffoon and his lies.
@christoronyi In a word: Yes.
@JohnJHarwood giving up too many offensive rebounds.  What did Pat Riley say way back when "no rebounds no rings."  GSW going home.
@deweyd You know what is interesting...this has all gone away from me. I think once Gerrard and Carragher left it meant a new type of Liverpool. Yes I am glad they lost but they do play a great brand of football and Klopp is great fun.
@Oliver__Bond @DR9214N This is really incredibly lame.
@Josh_Moon not sure about the best ever but seems like a really good guy.
@jvplive @fqxjv @AdalahNY @jvpliveNY @ChicagoJVP @JVPDCMetro @jvpnewhaven @JVPBayArea @JVPBoston @codepink @JVP_LA @nyujvp complete nonsense.  I saw Radiohead in Tel Aviv last summer the world did not end and Thom Yorke was pretty clear that they must came to play some music.
@SportsJOE_UK I wonder how many of these fans actually have tickets...
@Pr1nceOfDarknes yup, just freed up my Sunday's in the fall in a big way.
@Majority54 @Lin_Manuel @JasonKander @dianakander About time.  When are you running for President?
Charles Barkley is absolutely right: that was an awful half of basketball.
@The_UnSilent_ and I have just watched my last @NFL game
RT @_SJPeace_: 3 of them killed 30 people.   3 of them killed no one.  Look at the differences in the mugshots.  		THIS IS WHY WE KNEEL!…
@Marmel Completly with you. My Sundays are now 100% reserved for my beautiful dog Lucy.
@kristine_kenyon @jonfavs Nice one Kristine.  As I said, I met him at a fundraiser last week and he is incredibly impressive with real depth of thought.  #flipthe48th. #dumpdana
@realDonaldTrump Only in your tiny little mind.
@BetteMidler I thought that they were going to stop doing this.
@jonfavs You guys should have Harley Rouda on from CA 48 on.  I was at a fundraiser in LA last week for him. He is trying to unseat Roherbacher.  Seems to be doing pretty well but he has to beat the 2nd rank republican to get to the general. Please have him on.
@robtuckey28 That is a tough one.
@khanak_08 Really a legend. Class personified.
@savannahnmommy Because some people will hate on everything and anything.
@geowulfmusic  your album is exquisite.  Like the first time I heard the Cocteau Twins,
@YuiMok @PA Stunning
@ColMorrisDavis @bbkenn92 I could not agree with you more. It was so nice to see some joy and happiness for a change.
@adamlea2 @Lola_F_shay I thought this exact same thought all day yesterday. True dignity, class and poise.
@TVRav @Pr1nceOfDarknes Can’t argue you that
@KennyWFDLive Pogba total bust, Sanchez non-existent compared to what he was at Arsenal. Martial, Rushford, lingard all pretty average. Lukaku a total flat track bully-the Jose Altidore of PL.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Tattoos I think.
@KennyWFDLive He is the manager, he has spent a fortune and none of it has worked. It’s on him.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Yeah but Chelsea are really awful.  Their inability to keep possession is pathetic.
@JJohnsonLaw absolutely...she is stunning and so poised.
And to do it in Russia would extra spice on the sauce.
@krassenstein @Maggyw519 I agree. I am a huge fan of Israel and support them, have lived there and in fact will be there in 2 weeks but this is a disaster and all Trumps fault.
@KennyWFDLive what are the odds? Aren't they the favorites anyway?
@tracyealy1 @amazinmikey @realDonaldTrump He must be the most sort after lawyer in the country.
@kellysadler45 You horrible human being. I wonder how you might feel if someone said that about one of your loved one. I bet that would wipe the smile off of your smug face.
@GOP @kellysadler45 @realDonaldTrump But has then spent it all again on playing golf.
@CillizzaCNN Happy anniversary. Mine was yesterday.
@DearAuntCrabby Great Tootsie reference.
@larrylyons1946 @TheDemocrats They bought his narrative, his hatred, his bigotism, his over 3000 lies, his utter disregard that our election was meddled with by Russia (I did not say collusion) and so they now own his brand of What the GOP stands for. The party of family values lol.
@KennyWFDLive @BeardedGenius You think he knows who Bob Eilson is!
@larrylyons1946 @TheDemocrats I think that’s a bit rich. Seems like a lot of hate from the right amongst everything else.  GOP bought Trump and now they own him.
@TheDemocrats But the message ENOUGH is not going to do it. What is the Democratic platform, what is the message, what are we going to do? Anti-Trump is not enough of a message.
@SocialBarca_10 the 5-0 at the Non Camp to be sure because it was Mourinho's first in charge of RM and he got schooled after saying he was there to end the Barcelona dominance. Not on that day he didn't.
@brycetache It does not appear so...they got their bullshit tax cut and they are all happy as can be.
@jack I used to work for that guy.
@cameron_kasky This is the same play that they are doing on the TV show Rise.  We will always remember those that you lost.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Really?  Have you lost your mind!
@CillizzaCNN What is bullying about it.
@IBES16 I agree.

@seanspicer You are a disgrace...you defended a president who did and continues to do nothing but lie.
@miss9afi You are awesome. I read your book and I support your cause 100%.
It's a bummer...I guess that the team in from Canada doesn't help
So Toronto FC, an MLS team are about to win the CCL and it is not available on TV in the US?  Are you kidding!
@TeaPainUSA @debv219 This is great!
@SteveSchmidtSES Yup!  Spot on!
@treasonstickers @TGIFGurl This is so well said!
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Barcelona made for Salah.
@Sarahchadwickk Thank you for pointing that out.
@ananavarro Absolutely no question.  His heart is broken and he wants to be with his wife.  I mean this in the best way, I think he is on his way to be with his wife.
@KennyWFDLive @Spina13Colada That is for sure!
@Spina13Colada @KennyWFDLive The fact that they need to be asked say everything you need to know about that place.
@robreiner Right on!  That is exactly correct. He couldn't attend the funerals because he is a pariah to everyone based on the disrespect that he treats everyone with. He is first and foremost a despicable human being.
@tweetmommybop @DearAuntCrabby so true
@ItsMeCathi Agree.
@SocialBarca_10 Indeed we will, which would make it a pretty good weekend.
@JamieHector Awesome show although you will always be Marlo to me.

@KarenKilgariff It's Willem Dafoe.
@ToDropADime2 @FLOTUS and they got the date wrong just to show how much they give a shit.
@BarackObama That is how Presidents do it. Real Presidents.
@RealMuckmaker @Bornabrit1 I would check and see where Willem Dafoe was on this day.
The times we live in... https://t.co/XcYEXNHRmb
I laughed very out loud at this. https://t.co/7jOd0NTgOo
@joncoopertweets I hope so.
@rolandsmartin @nikkihaley @realDonaldTrump @andersoncooper come on now Anderson, there is no such word as iregardless, regardless means the exact same thing.
So a fake "journalist" defends a fake "president" and his fake "lawyer" on a fake "news" network, without revealing that he is also a fake client of the fake "president's" fake "lawyer." This is the fake reality we now live in.
@ToDropADime2 Absolutely...he has a vested interest in the investigation going away. Fox News so fair and balanced.
@ebfavs you can however watch the review and play by play on CNN right now.
@krassenstein I believe he was getting ready to walk out the moment the Cuban foreign minister started talking.
@ProudResister @Starbucks Me neither.

@MichaelAvenatti You fucking rule mate!!!
@RonaldKlain Makes perfect sense.
@Iromg You genuinely have to be here Mike to know how bad it is.  This is not the America you know or your daughter grew up in. The rule of law is nowhere to be found.

@krassenstein Yay Stormy.  It feels like things are about to unravel just a tad for Trump.
@ezlusztig @LeftsideAnnie and this should be easy...really easy.
@krassenstein @imaliveoutthere the other two fellas don't look that happy either.
@CNN @bannerite People should buy it just to piss Trump off...
I wish she would run for office. https://t.co/FzwA6mMRh3
@JasonKander @HBO @RealTimers @cspan You are a hard working man and we appreciate all you do. Please run for President. Please run for something.
@JohnBrennan Brilliant!  That word will be trending in no time and you sir are a genius. Thank you for your service and your honest and succinct opinions about the worst human being to ever 'lead' this country.
@owillis Well fucking said!
@GOP I think most will disagree with you on that. See you in November.  You have tied yourselves to this nutcase in the White House get ready for it to backfire badly.
@JasonKander @billmaher Awesome. I sold your Majority 54 podcast...most of the ads (that you did a great job with) were from my clients.  Look forward to seeing on Bill Maher tomorrow.
@springsteen @marycjen This time next week I will be at Bruce on Broadway.
@JasonKander @billmaher excellent...are you on the panel?
Pretty much sums it all up. https://t.co/U3XwhyNYBo
@JeremiahMoore10 Well said.
@jonfavs Fine with me
@ananavarro How many is that?  I hope DCCC has a plan to be competitive in all these districts.
@DearAuntCrabby Dislike him? Yes, he is awful human being
@Mohjo09 to their defense, I don't think that Xavi had planned to leave at that point but he was certainly the heir apparent but he wanted to play every week. If there is a mass exodus at Bayern he could be convinced to come back... I would really hope so.
@ericcollins1981 yeah but they knew that when they bought him and I think some of their thinking was they could use him in the league and rest Iniesta for the CL. OK, it has not worked out but I also think the FCB's performances of late. This was coming.
@SocialBarca_10 Perhaps start with getting Thiago back.
@jaketapper @SpeakerRyan He doesn’t want to stay in Congress without being Speaker...all this winning!
@Dax_x98 @Bornabrit1 @realDonaldTrump @VP @mike_pence @seanhannity @DonaldJTrumpJr No fucking question about it.
@barcagalaxy I am rooting for Roma.
@MiltShook Well said. Snowden is a traitor pure and simple living under Russia's protection.
@BarcaWorldwide That is a shame.
@The_UnSilent_ Brilliant.
@barcagalaxy We have relied on Messi way too much this season and with Neymar gone and Suarez not the Suarez of the last couple years, plus an aging Iniesta, Pique and Sergio this result was on the cards.
RT @FullFrontalSamB: “Mr. Zuckerberg, can you explain how I’ve been on Facebook for ten years and yet still do not have one friend request…
@_MohamedAbd @barcagalaxy @FCBarcelona I think the result today has been coming...the Sevilla game and the first leg vs. Roma while they did not get beat they were not good performances and I fear for them this weekend at Valencia.
Not really. He is going to be part of the next wave and could not play of FCB in the CL anyway and in the end he really wanted to go to Barcelona.  Have you been to Liverpool?  Have you been to Barcelona? Case closed.
@krassenstein gleefully I say that that is what he is so pissed off about.
@barcagalaxy @FCBarcelona This result has been coming...going to back Sevilla, and then the first leg vs. Roma.  Have not been playing well for some weeks.
@barcagalaxy @FCBarcelona I wish it was true but I don't think they are at the moment.
@barcagalaxy Hope its a treble.
@AllenCMarshall In Idaho of all places.  That is progress indeed.
@barcagalaxy He was lucky to not give away a penalty in the 10th minute. That was a nailed on penalty.
@pamelarwalker You are so right!
@williamlegate So did i. Felt it in the Mid-Wilshire area. 5.0 of the coast. But I am on the 14th floor so it was uncomfortable.
@ToDropADime2 Right!
@totalBarca with some justification to be fair. Hopefully Barca and Messi will do their part tomorrow.
@krassenstein I am with you.  I would not watch that shit anyway.
@PreetBharara If wishing it made it so.
@TedNugent You irrelevant sad cunt.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes Actually in 19 minutes.
@KennyWFDLive That was amazing.
This is possibly the best MLS game EVER, best I have ever seen. #LAvLAFC
@SocialBarca_10 agreed.
@SocialBarca_10 or maybe not.  Messi is just amazing.
@SocialBarca_10 I agree...being unbeaten is not the issue...bigger issues ahead. Worst case 8 point lead.
Barca not very good today.
@Emma4Change @odawa49 Thank you for letting us know.  #EmmaforPresident
@phoebet23 @ABCNetwork @RosanneBarr I just un-DVRed the show. Don't care for her, her politics and her love of trump.

@RealMuckmaker Done
@LAPressClub @miss9afi @raif_badawi @RBFF_FRBL This is fantastic news, only thing better would be if he was freed which is what I thought this tweet was going to say.

@latricah @AIPChristina @freetospeekout @goettjt @DennisDMZ got you!
@latricah @AIPChristina @freetospeekout @goettjt @DennisDMZ I wasn’t being ambiguous when I used the term racist right. It was so evident and as such the right nominated a man barely a human being after his birther movement. Oh and btw I am not she I am a he, the handle is just an odd to Apple.asam and EVE, Sir Issac NEWTON &amp; Steve JOBS.
@MattJRosen @Donna_West @SteveKingIA Yap away all you like Mr King...you and your ilk are done. 285 days until Election Day.
@espiers Totally agree.
@KasieDC @Donna_West @RepRyanCostello @kasie How many is that?39 or 39. Flip the house and kill trumps agenda.
@DennisDMZ what a sad little short memory you have - perhaps you heard about the racist  right and Obama or did you sleep for that 8 years and he was at least a decent human being. That your ilk stand behind this guy is so sad and pathetic. and to think I once found you funny.
@hybridcupcake @Manoncamelshump well his ilk are on their way out.
#StormyDanielsDay
@krassenstein @TGIFGurl Hell yeah
@williamlegate I am not on ly to watch it, I am going to go back and watch it again.

@SoSofieFatale @Bornabrit1 that is really true.
@IronStache @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan every single one of them.

@ananavarro you deserve it...change is coming
@Josh_Moon exactly
@mattmfm Oh yeah...we are coming for the politicians.
@RyanAFournier @rzimmermanjr so what?

@PodSaveAmerica I love you guys and I love selling @Cadence13_ your podcasts. You are an inspiration. Way to go.
@Emma4Change I simply adore you and everything you stand for. You run and I will vote for you.
@DavidCornDC @Smilingl8dy @MotherJones Absolutely and you could hear a pin drop.
@cameron_kasky @mlowery97 You guys were awesome, eloquent band passionate. I am so proud of all of you. I have so much hope.
Beautiful. https://t.co/7eyqpVcEdi
@Emma4Change You are a rock star. I watch you with tears in my eyes and hope in my heart.
@kenolin1 @kingpinnupe Yes we can.
@PaulBegala @realDonaldTrump Secretly he was for the war. He is Justin afters merchant, after it all went to shit then he was against it. He is a horrible human being in every way.
@PuestoLoco Good Christian folk run amok. It always is.
@CillizzaCNN Agreed.  Absolutely unnecessary from a very dignified man.
@thebrianfallon @springsteen April 19th I am there.
@WatchChad How fucking stupid are you really. Bombs are actually illegal...perhaps you were not aware of that fact.  You really must be a Trumpet with that level of stupidity.
@fawfulfan Brilliant response to a really stupid fucking tweet.
@StormyDaniels Stormy, you go girl. We are behind you in every way.
@JasonKander I won’t tell you again Jason...please run for President...you are everything we need to get away from where we are.

Federer is amazing.  Not sure how he won that to be fair. He really is the GOAT. @rogerfederer.
@thehill Where do we contribute?
Got yo be honest I thought Federer was done in this match. He is amazing!  Come on Roger!
@ChrissieEvert Abdolutely
@DearAuntCrabby I asked the same question myself.
Show me a bracket in all the land where this was predicted?
And btw what is a UMBC? University of Maryland, Baltimore County/City?
Wow!!!!!!
Has this ever happened before?  A 16 beating a1!  Educate me people.
@JasonKander This is happening!  Has it ever happened b4?
@PortSideGuy @marcylauren @eugenegu @TruthSpeaker_00 RIP indeed.  One of the greats.
@adamcbest Nicely stated.
@soccerdiva that was quite the 12 minute rant.
@splinter_news @rolandsmartin Sue them.
Just a whole lot of propaganda...hated it when it was Obama, love not now that it is trump. How does these fools sleep at night or look themselves in the mirror. https://t.co/YymCSpDJwm
@jemelehill @karenhunter You tell 'em Jemele.
@FOXSoccer @ChampionsLeague Barca, Real Madrid, Bayern, City and that is how it should be.
@liza_elizaeliza @dawn_comfort Exactly!  Well put!
@paulfrommonaco @StormyDaniels I could not agree more. I came to the US 36 years ago, served in the US army and this is not what I swerved for.
@williamlegate @Tony_Artza its possible he never had any balls to start with.
@paulfrommonaco @StormyDaniels NICE...she is awesome and clearly has something as she is the one person he has not cum after.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes yeah, we are all a bit dumber right now.
@emmyrossum Very sad indeed.
@MichelleDBeadle Old Law and Order.
@MelissaDipuccio @williamlegate Brilliant!
@mndhanna @StormyDaniels learn how to spell you moron.
@StormyDaniels You go Stormy...there are millions behind you...just don't back down.
@jaketapper only 703 now.
@J15Samm @bbkenn92 Right on Sam. Sometimes we only have ourselves to blame and we better fucking starting learning some of these lessons.
@Bakari_Sellers @jaketapper I bet you are right. Why aren't you running?  Come on we need folks like you.
@krassenstein steady on boys lets not jinx it.
@CBurleyESPN Mourinho really is a good manager but he is a scared manager. He could spend billions and would still play this dire dross style of football.
@J15Samm @bbkenn92 Great point. We cant have the Hillary/Bernie divide...look where it got us.
@DearAuntCrabby hold on Auntie, let's slow down and not jinx this.
@CillizzaCNN not very bipartisan.
@lilyallen in a nutshell.
@BigSte36 @jackamol1 so nothing has really changed in and around Liverpool. Munich chants and Carragher...same old.
@morninggloria @MissySkies sadly I think you are right.
@ToDropADime2 lets keep it quiet and just hope that that is how it plays out.
@budarydachas @StormyDaniels Thanks...i thought it was airing tonight.
Did Trump manage to stop the @StormyDaniels interview on 60 Minutes?
@emmyrossum @realDonaldTrump he is such a cunt...i cannot believe that this is where we are as a country.
@ananavarro Did they stop the interview?
I do find it interesting that the one person trump has not attacked anywhere especially on Twitter is @StormyDaniels.  There is something to that.
@TomSteyer I am with you Tom.
@ItsMeCathi brilliantly articulated.
@MaioccoNBCS @AdamSchefter Hell yeah!
@Pr1nceOfDarknes @krassenstein To be sure!  What a fucking world.
@krassenstein All of them I would imagine.
@RaeComm So good to hear your voice. Now if we could just have you do some CL matches.  Are you now with NBC?
@wokeluisa @KarsinXXX I will take all i can get.  Well put.

@Pr1nceOfDarknes Classic.
RT @OrgPhysics: wow https://t.co/T8vQopsNWP
Trump and Jong Un is a good thing. I am happy to criticize Trump as a horrible president and worse human being all day every day but it is tough to not say that this is a good thing only good thing he had done. Have to give credit where it its due otherwise we just become them.
@bzref @Pr1nceOfDarknes I watched Messi's free kick vs. A. Madrid on Saturday with "of course he does that."  It was beautiful to watch but not a surprise. He is the best I have ever seen.
@BetteMidler Quality
@_niajoi @blkgirlculture I love that show.
@Pr1nceOfDarknes No question.  We are so privileged to have had them for as long as we have.
@thecadencelux What do you think?
@krassenstein @MrsKucera surely this is illegal.
@MeghanMcCain I know...he was off the rails...amusing but insane.
@SteveSchmidtSES a plane I might add that I was supposed to be on but for sheer luck and doing my commander a favor I was taken off of the manifest 3 days prior to it leaving.
Just got out of an elevator with none other than The Fonz
@SteveSchmidtSES And what they did for the 101st Airborne Division Dec12th 1985 also at Gander, Newfoundland after the largest plane crash in US Military history.
@Montel_Williams Me neither.  101st Airborne for 4 years and she can fuck off.
@NellyMoloney @AllisonBJanney She will always be Claudia Jean to me.
@strujillo075 @dekatron_man No I disagree.  It should have started and ended, and he should have been disqualified when he got involved in the birther bullshit.
@JRubinBlogger Oh I don’t forget that. I think first and foremost he is a shocking human being.
@EdKrassen @NRA And why I will be a customer of them and their partners forever.
@ToDropADime2 @MiaFarrow I already do
@TheTweetOfGod @leemeade77 Great one.

@CillizzaCNN Excellent!
@TracyRenee10 @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand @Majority54 @JasonKander It certainly was.
@TracyRenee10 @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand @Majority54 @JasonKander I am proud to work for the company that put it out...
@thehill its happening...slowly but surely.
@TracyRenee10 @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand @Majority54 @JasonKander what a great podcast that was.
@lpetitt50 @MomsDemand where was this in the Valley?
@Alyssa_Milano @amazon @AppleTV @FedEx @NRA I am in!
@robreiner That does about sum it up.  The most poisonous person to ever enter American politics. A complete embarrassment.
@jaketapper @TB_Times Facts matter and the facts are on your side @CNN.
@NathanLerner Exactly.  WTF is their problem.
@tsf_podcast and now they are losing. Even better.
@JoeNBC @HotlineJosh @marcorubio Sorry, disagree here. This is not about showing up. The fact that nobody has showed up before is a disgrace in &amp; of itself but his answers were pathetic &amp; when 17 are dead you don't credit for just showing up. Trump &amp; Scott are even more repugnant for not showing up
@DwyaneWade @jonlovett Beautifully stated!  Thank you.
@BetteMidler @FedEx @NRA Already have...on it.
@CillizzaCNN The effort they are prepared to put forward on this issue is a disgrace.
@CollinRugg You are a total piece of shit mocking kids how have lost friends, classmates and mentors.  You have no soul, no compassion and no empathy...sadly you are just another of those very lost people who think guns are more important than kids.
@JanzforCongress @CA_Dem You go Andrew!
@ananavarro It is as if, if we can't fix all of it we should not fix any of it. Insanity!
@ProudResister @RepubsRScum @FedEx @NYDailyNews This is awesome...tomorrow I am switching all my company's delivery services to @UPS and @DHLUS.  Hope you hear what we are saying here @FedEx.
@crazylary51 They are all racists.  His involvement in the birther movement should have disqualified right there and then. That is did not makes those who voted for him the ultimate racists and they need to own it. sadly some do and quite happily.
@RobertwRuncie Let's hope they all comply.
@imheathergraham Through your interview with @marcmaron I found your new movie and really enjoyed it. Congrats in telling your truth to power.  Great job.
@JuddLegum @RepubsRScum @FedEx That is Ok, tomorrow my business is ending its account  with FedEx and will start to exclusively use UPS and DHL.  That is the only way that I can have my voice heard. I will not use any organization that partners in any way with @NRA.
@maryfaber @shannonrwatts @AppleTV @Google @amazon @RokuPlayer Time to make them go on the record.#ontherecord.
@amazon @Google @Apple where are you all at regarding partnerships with @NRA.  It is time to go on the record.
@psj11psj @guskenworthy I think maybe it is a reflection of how these folks feel about the US since trump became president. Perhaps trump cut funding for the Olympics so he can arm teachers.
@bryancrabtree @guskenworthy what like you... I am pretty sure we are afforded the right to say what the fuck we like in this country or we were until this horrible woman's father became president.  Oh, and how many Olympics have you been to? Prat!
@CortneyMiller22 @guskenworthy well said.
This is disgraceful. It is a lobbying group for the gun manufacturers of this country why on earth should it be tax-exempt. https://t.co/5qd8jcw5MB
@markfonz @BetteMidler Exactly.
@maydaymindy9 @gregstevens @NRA UPS for me.
Let's be honest if every man of color in this country went out and bought an AR-15 this administration would find a way to ban them by Tuesday.  But because its always while folks doing mass shootings it is a mental health issue. This country has lost its morality and its soul.
@mmpadellan @Abq01 well said.
@morningmika @FedEx UPS for me.
@shannonrwatts @united @NRA i believe they have Shannon.
@MiltShook OMG be still my heart.
RT @shannonrwatts: Tell them to #DumpNRATV https://t.co/1Vy9qgHUO3
@CapehartJ @artist4ever agreed
@MichaelSkolnik @NRA @Hertz @Avis @Budget @TrueCar @Life_Line @NortonOnline @alliedvl @northAmericanVL @SimpliSafe @Manageurid @eHealth @Teladoc @FedEx @LifeLock @WildApricot and i will boycott every one of those companies.
@krassenstein @Abq01 @united and MIT just issued this statement in response to a Dallas HS who threatened any students with suspension if they protested: "MIT officials to college applicants: Your acceptance won't be rescinded if you're disciplined for joining high school protests against gun violence."
@TomiLahren Thoughts and Prayers Tomi you are literally as brainwashed as anyone outside of Ann Coulter. You are a disgusting human being.
@BetteMidler and also: "MIT officials to college applicants: Your acceptance won't be rescinded if you're disciplined for joining high school protests against gun violence."
@BetteMidler and all the rest:	Hertz	Chubb 	Met Life	Symantec	Teladoc	Simplisafe	Best Western	Wyndham Hotels	Alamo Rent A Car	National Rent A Car	Enterprise Rent A Car	First National Bank of Omaha	Delta Airlines	United Airlines 		Shit be changing!
@JasonKander @AmericanU @Georgetown This is genuinely great news. Good for MIT and now I want to see all the other major universities in this country make the same statement. When will you be announcing that you are running for President?
@shannonrwatts Yeah, but isn't it great to see how angry they are all getting. You don't get this angry unless you are getting worried. Sticks and stones etc... let them rage, change is afoot.
@robreiner Also companies as well who have all ended ties with the NRA	Hertz	Chubb 	Met Life	Symantec	Teladoc	Simplisafe	Best Western	Wyndham Hotels	Alamo Rent A Car	National Rent A Car	Enterprise Rent A Car	First National Bank of Omaha	Delta Airlines	United Airlines
@BillWeirCNN @kittyFitz50 Thank you Bill. As someone who once lived there I can attest to what you are saying.
@Evan_McMullin @ogreenthumb @CPAC Well stated...they should be ashamed of themselves but they have no shame.
@SRuhle @DearAuntCrabby This is impressive.
@jonlovett Nice one.  Well put.
@BlaDel3 @MapwifeJodi @shannonrwatts a disgrace at every level.
@MapwifeJodi @shannonrwatts Exactly. The madness that this is where we are with the debate in this country is appalling and shocking. And lets be honest the NRA position is not about the right to bear arms but to sell arms.
Brilliantly stated I think can all agree. https://t.co/aRjc9sg2Tx
@kylegriffin1 @TGIFGurl That this is where we are as part of the debate ion what we call a civilized country is so awful and shocking that I am amazed that we are collectively so embarrassed for this country. Who are we? where is our soul?
@shannonrwatts That is exactly the point. Does an armed guard making $15-$20 an hour want to be putting his or her life on the line for anyone...the answer is most likely no and I don't question the motives but it stops the NRA position cold.
@CillizzaCNN sort of kills the the only way for a bad guy/good guy bullshit. Stops it in its tracks.
@realMatMolina @NRA OMG...that is so right and so well presented. You are 100% right. This is all about money and has nothing to do with rights because if it were anyone can see that there is no way that the founding fathers had this in mind.
@SocialInLA yeah it's cold.
@KW14Ultra Me too.
@KW14Ultra 97% of Americans are for meaningful change with background checks...what is the problem.
@KW14Ultra As much as he could without any interest from a country, NRA or Congress that all put guns before children.  Where is our soul, where is our conscience, where is our value for human life.
@EdKrassen we just have to stand up to them. They are flat track bullies but if you stand up to them we will win.
This really does say it all: an hour by hour look of how Obama behaved after Newtown and how trump behaved after Parkland	https://t.co/kUyNuX207d
RT @franklinleonard: I asked for someone to do an hour by hour comparison of Obama’s response to Newtown and Trump’s response to #Parkland.…
@krassenstein @Emma4Change I agree. They are teachers not soldiers or law enforcement.
@starting_eleven Just incredible.
@jaketapper @DavidJUrban @RickSantorum He shouldn't be expected to know that. His job does not really need him to know that he is only the president of the united states no reason he should know such a fact.
@sarahchad_ But it's not surprising in any way.  What we have to do is get them on the record which we have failed to do before and him not showing up tomorrow night is him on the record: putting guns and the NRA before children's lives. Consider it recorded.
@johncusack @TGIFGurl exactly...there is nothing they will criticize him for.
@JasonKander Yes it should and you should be running for President.
Just watched "Icarus" and are we still really doubting the depths of the Russian government's depravity in all walks of life. We need to wake up.
@NateSilver538 Please keep posting this stuff.
@toxchick42 @Maryc1850Sadler @AlecMacGillis Not sure I totally agree with that.  What is so maddening about this issue is that i really feel that most people, gun-owners included can't look at this and think it is OK. It is the institutions &amp; lobbyists &amp; who have bought congress &amp; this president.
Really just common sense but it is good to hear this from a guy who i think is in Texas but justv says it like it is. https://t.co/WVQmaSOEJ5
@SaysHummingbird @dalehansen I think this guy is in Texas and he always has really well-thought positions that are neither one side of the aisle or the other. Well spoken, common sense commentator that i wish i had in my market.
@Mediaite Trump has never been deeply affected by anything in his life unless it centers around him.  More lies from Fox.
@SaysHummingbird @EmersonFan1 Unfuckingbelievable.
So the NRA protection from potential danger but kids in school no dice.  What more do we need to know about these folks and the fact that he going to that a week after this most recent speaks of such tone-deafness...it is so shocking. https://t.co/sFtgVh0Oyc
@deborahbrian @pammy643 @brianklaas Completely agree...i am actually filled with some hope and their passion is unrelenting.  Time is up almost for the NRA.
@Maryc1850Sadler @AlecMacGillis Dems are especially afraid of the gun lobby when elected from essentially red states but possible blue districts but i think this is all coming to an end...maybe not this year but we are getting there. This cannot go on forever.
@Maryc1850Sadler @AlecMacGillis I love that you mention Pod Save America - my company Cadence13 is partners with Crooked Media we sell and market all their podcasts but your point is well made and i feel that when you look at VA the answer is right there.
@sarahchad_ Yes she is and something tells me a future leader.
@Yes_WeThePeople @SycoraxPine @RowPan @JulieFoudy @lindseyvonn Really...she just lost her first Olympic race today in 3 Olympics so she has done some winning.
@romyreiner Yeah...right on point.
@tonyposnanski And if today is anything to go by she will.
@ChuckGrassley @JanzforCongress @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah real tough now aren’t you once your guy gets in.  How you feeling about being the sole sponsor of the mental health/gun bill last year. The blood of 17 from FL are on your hands.
@RedTRaccoon me too.
@VA_Amilyn_Holdo @mahilena wonderfully stated.
@jk_rowling @Pr1nceOfDarknes His last name is about right.
@jk_rowling @Pr1nceOfDarknes Brilliant!
@AlecMacGillis Brilliantly stated.  Thank you. I am one of those liberals who would usually say "nothing all be done."  Thanks for calling me out and giving me another way to look at it.
@markmobility Nice Job. We need to do this for every typically blue state. In CA alone if we could flip those seats we would be half way to taking back the house.
@JasonKander @KingJames @FoxNews Please run for President!
@pacelattin I hope that is real.
@deborahbrian @pammy643 @brianklaas I could not agree with you more...seeing Emma Gonzalez today has made me feel a bit better about the future though. What a heroic young girl.
@Brasilmagic How true!
@PuestoLoco @marcylauren I agree. I wish he would go away.

@miss9afi It is so profoundly satisfying to hear you this.  I feel the same way about the Arab and I hope and think a lot about the day your husband will be free.  I loved your book while weeping at the same time.
@ananavarro You weren't...I didn't watch either.
I thought Trump claimed he never watches CNN yet he is referencing Van Jones Interview with Jay-Z, just another lie in the pantheon of a habitual and pathological liar.
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps you hav heard of a guy called Barack Obama.  To say you have done anything for folks of color is patently laughable you bigot.
Piers Morgan interviewing trump and making such a big deal about it reminds me of The Clash song White Man in the Hammersmith Palau’s when they wrote and sang “ if Adolfo hitler flew in today they’d send a limousine anyway.”
@benwikler Not a chance.
@piersmorgan Just unfollowed you...you are a total disgrace, and now I am blocking you. Horrible human being...the both of you.
@kylegriffin1 Do you think it might be because he is black...me thinks so
@miss9afi @raif_badawi Got your back.
@JasonKander Could not agree more. I love content that educates me and Majority 54 did just that.
@piersmorgan Thankfully I can’t get ITV.  I hope it tanks and you are as exposed as the sycophant you are and as empty. You are disgusting...he is a bigot of the highest order.
@thecadencelux You and AJ...wow
@CherieDeVille Oh and congrats.
@CherieDeVille And yet another lie from 45...he says he never watches @CNN
@JasonKander 2/2 you have brought up. It would be great if you could release a supplemental podcast with all those segments in one single podcast.  I really thought the guns, voting rights &amp; student debt episode were superb and I hope there will be a 2nd season.
@JasonKander  1/2 I love your podcast and just for the record I work for the company that sells your show and I am responsible for the @Soothe, @INDOCHINO and @sleepnumber ads.  I really love the last segment of the show when you answer the opposing party's view on all the topics

@JanzforCongress Let me know how I can help your campaign.
@BetteMidler I think it was a Forbes magazine with Ivanka on the cover.
The upside of this being the one year anniversary of President Shithole being sworn in is that we have at least survived and 3 years from today he will officially be part of a very sad and degrading chapter of this country’s history.
RT @SebastianComedy: .@nytimes said that I use the stage like a dance floor... Should I get more physical on this tour? https://t.co/ieYkRe…
@amandalitman @JonesNCHouse @RossMoRock Just say the word
Using his words President Shithole has said in the past that a government shut down rests solely on the shoulders of the president, plus no party at Mar Lago and the Women's march across the country: happy anniversary you douchebag @realDonaldTrump. How big was your crowd?
@SenateMajLdr You are an awful human being
Classic. https://t.co/1HTqXayzP9
@jonlovett Mixt Greens as well.
@BarackObama Please come back...please, please, please, please.
Enough said! https://t.co/xHMGpYJlIA
@goldengateblond I thought exactly the same.
@Ed_Miliband Precisely and how it would it look for the US President to booed and jeered at everywhere he went. Would not look good on TV.
@karaswisher Not a moment too soon.
@lilswehawk @asomer @RepAdamSchiff @MDarleneI I know, what a pratt.  No surprise that she is Trumper.
@ezraklein Loving your podcast.  Really great content.

@jonlovett #FlipTheHouse
@piersmorgan @realDonaldTrump No, you are wrong.  Trump is an unstable idiot who you suck up to hoping to getthe next interview.  You are a sham. Stick to predicting who will play in goal for Arsenal.
@docrocktex26 @Kennymack1971 @GOP think you got it in one.
@RepAdamSchiff @MDarleneI Mr Schiff, if you have not noticed this administration has declared war on CA: Immigration, Marijuana, drilling, sanctuary cities...we will have our voice in Nov when we turn all the GOP in CA blue and #FlipTheHouse
@VlNCHY @NorthernTone That is brilliant!
Check this out...amazing! https://t.co/0zpA8EtaLm
@BroadcastMoose Putrid
@JordanUhl Certainly enough to #FlipTheHouse.  All that winning...
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump Indeed...Mr Obama might have something to say about that...perhaps PBO could sue for all the lies about the birth certificate.
@DaveWeasel @jomckinney_ @realDonaldTrump well put.  Thak you
@JeffreyGuterman @debv219 are you really surprised?
@piersmorgan No, i think you do. Ospina starting
@cmclymer @JessicaTaylor #FlipTheHouse
@downwithtyranny @Manoncamelshump @SpeakerRyan @IronStache Let's start by flipping every single GOP seat in CA. There is a war being waged by this administration vs. CA: immigration, marijuana, sanctuary cities, you name it. And have you heard one word from Trump about the fires last month? They do not care. Let's respond in kind in Nov.
@TheRealGregX Notice that Trump has yet to mention word one about either the fires from December or the rains/mud right now. The federal govt does not give a shit about CA and we need to respond in kind.
@TheRealGregX and now Issa is going. Dems should focus on all California GOP MOC. It makes the path to flipping the house that much easier There is a war from this administration on CA whether it is marijuana, immigration, sanctuary cities, natural disasters.
@Amy_Siskind @amazinmikey Bring on November.
Another winnable seat for the Dems. They are not all bailing because there is just so much winning going on.  November cannot arrive soon enough. We will stop the Trump agenda in its tracks.
Two things that seem to have been a bit overlooked in all the Bannon &amp; Russia crap from yesterday: Arpaio declared for the Senate in AZ - that should be a winnable seat once we find our AZ Doug Jones and the NC redistricting issue...two steps up...
@JasonKander Yes, you are right but I think this is a totally winnable seat. This guy is a criminal and a crackpot and AZ is not as conservative as AL. We need to find a Doug Jones type guy for AZ. Let Arpaio attach himself to Trump and he will lose.
@CFahy1204 just realized that being a Bruce fan is not enough when it comes to being a Trumper.  You've got to go and go you will.
@atDavidHoffman well said.
@SheenaEBell That is excellent!
@SteveSchmidtSES @MiltShook @AnnCoulter It is tough to believe that you were ever a Republican.  I really enjoy your tweets and it's heartening to hear an opposition from what was once the opposition.  Keep going, Steve.
@amandalitman This is what we need.  Where are the Tim Cook's, Warren Buffet's and Bill Gates to do the same with the kind of money they have got?
@KamalaHarris @karecki1 @Oprah Yeah, Oprah would be great but what about you. By the time 2020 comes around you will have had more time in the Senate than PBO did when he ran.  Why can't it be you?

@fdomenella Really really hard. Th top one of Bruce and Obama in the Oval Office touches who i am. Lovely talking to you but i must go to bed.  Good night/Good morning.
@fdomenella Darkness is overall my favorite album. Something In The Night is another amazing song. And yes you are right about the song it is not just a cruising song its about salvation, redemption, second chances and not having to be what you came from. It is simply PERFECT!
@B52Malmet Sadly i think we are all going to be very disappointed on Tuesday but if Moore wins then the GOP own it and every ad for any and every democrat from now until the end of time should attach him to the GOP and what that party has become.
@fdomenella And not just music...i share his policits completely. For 8 years i had Bruce and Obama and i was in heaven.
@fdomenella what i have loved about Bruce is that when i came to the US 36 years ago his music and his perspective gave great insight into the good, bad and ugly of America and he was spot on about it all. The joy he has given me over the years is immeasurable.
@fdomenella the lyrics themselves reflect how i have felt at times in my life, not now but earlier and Roy's piano at the end is both evocative and sad but classically beautiful. It ha everything including amazing imagery.
@fdomenella wow 96? I am only at 41. My favorite Bruce song if i HAD to name one is Racing the Streets. But there are so many others that i adore: The Price You Pay, Point Blank, Stray Bullet, Brothers Under The Bridge...so many, bit i had to name one "Racing" is it.
@FoxNews @POTUS it is a great shame they are just words and he does not mean any of it. Another stream of pure lies.
@Alyssa_Milano @ceejay410 i love your activism...keep going and never be deterred.
@fdomenella I am going to see it in January when i am there for business. Cannot miss that...it will be my 41st Bruce show. He might be living only 10 miles away but under vastly different circumstances i think. He is just the best!  What is your favorite Bruce song?
@fdomenella No World Cup is in Russia (so maybe they knew better) and i think it is 60 years since Italy was not in a world cup. Going for a wedding and then to the Amalfi coast and Capri.
@ckendall77 @Maggyw519 @natemcdermott I fear they will not but there can be a silver lining to it...they buy it, they own it.
@fdomenella I was there in July for a few days...it is not totally my cup of tea to be honest which is why i left 30 years ago. I am however heading to you country in June, so excited about that. The irony of being in Italy during a World Cup without Italy will be strange.
@fdomenella i am from England but live in LA. left the UK 30+ yard ago but was lovely seeing the weather, the streets, the pubs and the driving on the left side.  That was really nostalgic and of course Bruce: my favorite artist of all time.
@fdomenella awesome, thanks for sharing.
@KissaSins Good morning
@ezraklein Hi Ezra, as i said in another post to you. I sell your podcast and we have just done a deal with 20th Century Fox to advertise "The Post" on your pod i need your e-mail to give to Fox to get you a screener of the movie.  Can you follow me and DM your e-mail address.
@The_UnSilent_ @GOP Do you think the GOP tax bill was designed to specifically hurt the "coastal elites."  Yeah, i am thinking the same.
Don't tell me there is no difference between the two parties. https://t.co/ONxQFDkxpL
@JasonKander Your podcast Majority54 is superb and I know it because I sold all the ads that you and Heidi read. Thank for doing such a great job.
@ezraklein Ezra, I sell both your podcasts for Vox/Cadence13 and I was wondering if you could follow me as so I can DM you I need to ask you something about a movie "The Post" that is going to be advertising with you in Jan. Thanks.
@AJsApplebooty Ignore them...haters gonna hate.
@MichelleDBeadle it makes you sleep better, I always found that to be true when I was a kid.
@CharlesPPierce @billcap Mr. Thomas I believe...how correct you are.
It has to be said that if @alfranken calls its a day tomorrow it is the biggest win for the other side since the general election last year. Let's have the investigation and then see which way is up. It is time to fight back not fucking roll over and play dead.
@EdanClay @taiping2 There can be no argument to what you just said. We do it to ourselves.
@CitizenWonk Totally agree...what a fucking hypocrite.
@ezlusztig exactly &amp; quite correct. When are we going to suit up &amp; get in the fight. It is only the country &amp; the republic at stake. This is why we lose because we do not defend our own thinking we are taking the higher ground. Leave the higher ground to Weinstein, Louis CK and Matt Lauer.
@char_stokely I hear you...in so many ways including the lose of one of your colleagues.
@lisamurkowski Stop right there- apply the same rules to the other side including the imbecile in the White House. This is why we lose because we eat our young &amp; give the other side a pass. Come on stop this nonsense. let them have their ethics investigation &amp; then we will see which way is up.
@CNN @CNN additionally have you learned nothing from last year In the general which is what got us into this madness. Stop covering these fringe lunatics on the right like Moore and start interviewing people like Doug Jones and lets here what he is for and why he is running. Come on!
@CNN where is your coverage of Doug Jones in this Alabama race. You are just showing and giving airtime (as insane as it is) to Moore and his crazy spokeswoman.  When will you learn we are not going to change their minds we have to simply get out &amp; vote. Don't boo, vote.

RT @BillyBaldwin: The Un-President…		unqualified	unhinged	unfit	unacceptable	unaware	unbalanced	unbearable	untrustworthy	unspeakable	unacco…
@Jon_BG Doesn't make it untrue...as much as you would like to believe that, some are not convinced. He is admitted to so much predatory behaviour this is not difficult to believe in any way shape form or fashion.
@CaughtOffBase @pattonoswalt @bridgeteverett watched it last night, loved it
And here it is a detailed list of the Groper-In Chiefs sexual assaults https://t.co/NYQzZNyyka	He is president now, who would dare come out and accuse him, doesn't mean it did not happen.
@Barbara75538363 @chelseahandler Harrys.  Try https://t.co/a9KoefATyS...much cheaper and they come to your door every month.
@faryl @LumenFidei4 @WillMatthewsVA @DineshDSouza @washingtonpost Exactly...these people are so dumb that it is frightening.
@LumenFidei4 @WillMatthewsVA @DineshDSouza @washingtonpost actually, perhaps you have heard of separation of church and state...our legal system is not based on the 10 Commandments which is why Moore was ordered to remove them from the courthouse. You are as dumb as you sound and know nothing about your own countries legal system.
@DineshDSouza @washingtonpost these are real journalists from a real paper who have sourced their story and nobody cares if you like it or not.  They don't just print shit for the sake of it...they got folks to go on the record!
@DineshDSouza @washingtonpost You are fucking disgusting, but never mind because the thing you are not counting on is the fact that the left is TOTALLY mobilized and we are coming for people like you.  Support Moore and discredit the 4 women, there will be more and just to be clear...
@MaioccoNBCS Thinking of you and your wife Marquise.
@joncoopertweets @BerniesHomie ask NC after the bathroom bill.
@joncoopertweets @BerniesHomie well said.
@SiGoBrands @RozRBentley @j3rfAFC Thanks.
@milesjreed @DianaMiller5 and in a way it is Putin's face that tells you everything...he knows he cant play Obama...he knows he has Trump under his thumb.
@SwampyTrump @KarsinXXX @seanhannity well stated.
@Keurig @MDarleneI @dtcav Thank you for seeing sense.
@GDouglasJones Mate, i am.  Two donations in 2 days.
@joncoopertweets @feathersnpaws I will give all i can to Doug Jones...hope everyone else will as well.
@SnowFlkMeltdown @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanhannnity 8 years and not a single scandal...wish we could say about the last very sad 295 days.  And call us snowflakes all you want but Tuesday should have showed we are mobilized snowflakes.

@crazylary51 @SandalsResorts @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity Me too, hear us clearly @SandalsResorts we are not hardly kidding. Stay on Hannity and you will feel our wrath.
@joncoopertweets @feathersnpaws Lets not get too comfortable quite yet...a month to go.
@kylegriffin1 @Kris_Sacrebleu because he is a moron.
@crazylary51 @AHS_Warranty @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity Me too, hear us @AHS_Warranty hear us, i just canceled my agreement with you, we are not hardly kidding about this. Stand with Hannity and you stand with pedophilia.
@crazylary51 @elitesingles @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity me too, hear us @elitesingles we are not hardly kidding. Stay on Hannity and we will Boycott you forever.
@crazylary51 @jitterbugphones @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity me too, hear us @jitterbugphones we are not hardly kidding. If you stay on Hannity we will boycott you.
@crazylary51 @BeachesResorts @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity Me too...hear us @BeachesResorts we are not hardly kidding.
@ezraklein another reason to listen to this man's great podcast.
@jptoner50 @marcylauren Hopefully all of them.
@FireHannity @crazylary51 Brilliant, lets keep the pressure on. There are more to go.
@joncoopertweets @AynRandPaulRyan @Keurig @seanhannity and i will be right there supporting every advertiser who bails on Fox and Hannity.
@KamalaHarris @helenmag me too.  @KamalaHarris remember that @BarackObama had only been in the senate 2 years when he ran for President. Why not you.
@krassenstein as i read yesterday " America it has been a good run"
@coke_usa @crazylary51 @Applebees @TheDemCoalition @FireHannity Me too @Applebees hear what we are saying, we are not hardly kidding!
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Yup...there is a country at stake...by any means necessary as your network supports a man @seanhannnity who thinks pedophilia is ok as long as its by a Republican. You must all be very proud...
@DaShanneStokes @marcylauren Yes we do all we have to do is resist and mobilize.
@DavidCornDC @taiping2 of the worst type.
Great point. https://t.co/JlVkev9Z2e
@Amy_Siskind Then STFU Donna and get on with it, the election was a year ago and we are all moving forward not backwards. There is more at stake here than your ego.
@Amy_Siskind Please do and do so quickly so we can get that out there.
@poitinshake @piersmorgan same paper that mentioned on Friday that Trump has lied 1318 times since taking office. Your bombs dropping every 20 mins means nothing unless you tell me who they dropped the bombs on.
#OrganizeEverywhere, #MeAt14 , #MeToo and we will make a difference. If we mobilize and Tuesday showed we can, we can not be defeated. We will not change their minds but we can mobilize.
@AynRandPaulRyan @NaphiSoc @BrianAbrams please also donate when and where you can. This shit is important. They cannot beat us if we mobilize.
@Richard_Schiff that was a great episode.
@RWPUSA @debv219 i wonder if @WalshFreedom would suggest the same for someone not a Republican. We also have the right to know what he (moore) has been accused of in making our own decisions.
@Kaepernick7 @debv219 Keep it going Colin...there are millions who stand with you and i am one of them.

@chevymo everything Obama did. If Obamacare is not a great law then make it better abut his attempts to kick 20MM  from healthcare is abhorrent. Take a close at this man...he is not just a disgusting POTUS he is a disgusting human being.
@chevymo And that is just off the top of my head. Does not seem that having a bigot as POTUS is a good idea. At the very least he has made no attempt at all to unite the country, in fact, he is out to divide it as much as he can and lastly, his only policy objective is to simply overturn
@chevymo That he has lied 1318 times since taking office.  He sides with Putin over 14 agencies of the US intelligence. He cares only about but himself, thinks Nazis and folks protesting Nazis are the same and he started the birther movement which makes him the ultimate racist &amp; bigot.
@poitinshake @piersmorgan Did you count them or was that something you got from FOX.
@RozRBentley @waltmossberg I want one.
@piersmorgan That you see it like that is sad while not surprising.  he is unfit for office and there are so many reasons to point to as to why he is unfit for office. Your comments are ignorant.
@secupp @mmbbebe @UnfilteredSE You make a great point but it does rather show where we are. They also don't like the fact that folks on the left who do these things do not then get the backing of the left, they are thrown under the proverbial bus.
If you have been wondering what the GOP tax bill could mean to you this is worth reading. https://t.co/BcmXfBNYvC
@Kennymack1971 They are trashing their own property. Let them, they have already been bought, these people are so stupid that it defies any type of logic.
@pamelaadlon @BetterthingsFX I am super stoked as well, i love Better Things BUT how will the Louie CK issue effect the show moving forward and how do you feel about it?
@AoDespair its the same as folks who would crush and break LPs and cassettes of artists...the fools already bought them.

@DollarShaveClub you are dead to me while you advertise on Hannity. Bye bye, hello Harrys.
@HillaryClinton @cmclymer You are welcome, I was proud to do it.
@SenJohnMcCain @billcap My respect for you has never been higher. We honor you and your service on this day of all days and BTW I will always remember what you said to that crazy old woman who called Obama a terrorist in the '08 campaign at one of your town halls.
@ananavarro @bethreinhard @MiamiHerald @WSJ @wapo Ana, this is a fake account and clearly part of the Russia situation.  Notice the $ comes after the 1000...exactly how it would be expressed if it was in rubles.  Not kidding at all.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump He could have actually been one but he was too much of a coward. I am boycotting every advertiser in Hannity over the Moore issue.
@GDouglasJones How do we contribute to your campaign?
@joncoopertweets @debv219 I am with you.

@EdgeofSports Yes.  Thoughts and prayers mean fuck all when you are not prepared to do one thing about the issue.

@robreiner IMHO we want a 3-year impeachment process.  I do not want Pence as President. Let Trump do what he is doing and let's drag it out.
@Alyssa_Milano agreed, Dems don't get off Scott free on this if they are involved.
