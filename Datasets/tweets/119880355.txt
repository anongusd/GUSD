@dachsiemoron #thingsthatmakebidenlaugh Exploding Deficit and admitting the system will be insolvent in 2033
@postpolitics Constantly interrupting is a sign of insecurity
@mattklewis The fact Biden admitted that the system is insolvent in 2033 (not 2133) flew right over the MSM heads.
@freddoso Interrupting is a symptom of insecurity desperate to be heard. Jovial Joe persona was weird, esp during topics on foreign affairs.
@gretawire It does matter bc Jovial Joe's weird laughing and denial of his administrations failures overshadowed Amb Stevens sacrifice.
@daroff @TheFix Biden was weird tonight, not a statesman in the debate
@vivianberryhill @seanhannity I remember Obama putting him in charge of the abyss...lol  Biden appears in a foggy state...
@paulryanvp Your an outstanding statesman Paul Ryan.  So proud to be supporting  Romney-Ryan ticket!  Excellent debate perfomance tonight!
@vivianberryhill @seanhannity Sinister, mumbling, chatting with himself… why is he so weird? Let's vote this guy out of office in a hurry..
@haldonahue @Daggy1 @BiffBurner Obama’s green energy policy is more like green screen technology in the movies, manufactured illusions.
