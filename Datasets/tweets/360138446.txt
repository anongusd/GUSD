2/ I *crowdsourced* my trip based on where YOU thought I should go. 		Seriously, my itinerary was empty until I got flooded with more than 100 suggestions.		Counties I’ll be stopping in include: Monroe, Wood, Doddridge, Ohio &amp; Harrison.

Meeting adjourned. Less than three hours after it started.
This is shaping up to be one of the shortest board meetings I've been at. We may clock in at under three hours. https://t.co/ZfnGM5ljLl
Board member Samuels shared an evaluation for Supt. Graff from the supt eval committee. He's overall been "effective" and is working on good carryout of his plans.
Chair Rebecca Gagnon added that in 2013, MFT called for mediation. This time, the other side has, because the contract has already expired and they haven't reached settlement, she said. Also a factor: budget deficit, and need to make sure costs are understood.
Board member Don Samuels said it's tough that one group like the MFT can make a statement "chiding" the board but the school board can't respond
It's not even 6 p.m. and public comment has concluded. Moving on to rest of board meeting.
Admin filed for mediation in contract negotiation sessions. Michelle Wiese of MFT said it happened after parents/comm members came to bargaining session, and that admin doesn't want open/public discussions.

Spoke too soon -- all precincts are reporting. Meet your St. Paul school board.
With all but one precinct reporting, St. Paul school board's top vote-getters: Marny Xiong, Jeannie Foster and John Brodrick.

And school questions are listed here: https://t.co/hHg1ZiNSRc
Check the metro school board race roundup here: https://t.co/RoruxHQxam
Still have my eyes on this South Washington County race. 11 of 14 precincts reporting there.
Also in Edina (where 19 of 19 precincts are reporting), 4 leaders of the school board pack: Erica Allenburg, Matthew Fox, Ellen Jones and Owen Michaelson.
More schools races: With 19 of 19 precincts reporting, looks like Edina's referendum won approval.
Schools races: Anoka-Hennepin's 2 questions (including $249 million bond) are both headed for yes.

Reply, DM or email me if you have any questions tonight or on Election Day. I'll be here watching these schools races! 👀
OH, and besides the two districts I listed earlier, there are lots of school board elections happening, including in St. Paul!

Similar situation in South Wash. County. 10 candidates going for 4 open seats, plus one 2-year term seat with 5 candidates.
We have 12 candidates going for four seats on the Edina school board. Two are incumbents.

The board just called a five-minute recess. The crowd has been talking to the board members as they've been deliberating.
Dir. KerryJo Felder brought that forward.
What's on the floor right now is different from the resolution online: a one-year contract, reducing the number of SROs to 11

@amybrittjones It's a question of whether the board wants to spend time moving to a Policy Governance model or keep what it already has.

Yup. That's 93% of principals in total agreeing with this statement. Data from MPS https://t.co/v29uqBuTLA https://t.co/dsY0t4s6Lo
Now we're talking about SROs. Chief Eric Moore is going through survey data.
That was a couple hours ago. Then, the board heard about contract alternative programs. Check the agenda for more https://t.co/cbRfQlifYo
Community members questioned the use of resources for SROs and said they think police are intimidating in schools.
Principals turned out and said they're happy the supt. wants to keep a contract with Minneapolis Police Dept.
It's been a busy school board meeting so far. Public comment went a while and included a mixed bag on SROs.

Early interest in board officers. This is before the official officer elections Tuesday and there could be movement among interested members

School board members can't talk about school business over email but scheduling and distributing info this way is OK.
Under the open meeting law in MN, we get at least three days' notice on upcoming meetings
Now talking about conflict of interest and open meeting law. Learning lots about open meetings.
The points that got the most board and staff response -	Improved student outcomes	Stewardship	Family and community partnership
Each board and staff member got three sticky dots to put on each point (these include equity, improved student outcomes, and others)
The prompt, for board members and the appx. 12 staff members: pick three areas you want to learn more about
Interesting activity right now - big sheets of paper have each of the points in the strategic plan written on them.

While we're on the subject of the first day, I must mention I always loved the first day of school. Got to see friends again &amp; all was new!
It's the first day of school in the Minneapolis district. Headed to North High School for the arrival of @SuptGraff soon.
He told inspirational stories from students, like one about a mother who graduated from Longfellow HS; she posed in a pic with her daughter
Graff talked about changing the story at MPS and reinforced that the state of the schools is strong.
In a video, MPS students described what being strong meant to them and flexed their biceps to prove it.
Didn't have much data connection in Orchestra Hall, but here are some late takeaways from Supt. Graff's speech:

On the SRO topic from last night, here's a Mpls nugget from a June story by @StribLonetree https://t.co/EtXg9pjp78 https://t.co/CQrynN5d61
@lisamgs You're right. Perhaps the district has that info. I'll check tomorrow.
@HistoryJack that stood out to me, too.
This SRO convo has a lot of context to it. Don't want to mess up the background of it in tweets. Need to digest. Will tweet recap tomorrow.
Check out the student perception data, starting on slide seven of that link I just tweeted. Interesting.
Board heard a presentation on the annual student resource officers contract review. Link is here: https://t.co/jMNj4YchoU
McFarland, con't: "In the 2016-2017 school year, for instance, this funding accounts for $74 million."
Donald McFarland, Vote YES for Kids campaign spokesperson in a release: Funding is "13 percent of the district's budget."
Referendum language approved for ballot.
Nelson Inz: Somewhat disappointed that the referendum ask isn't for more money.
Board chair Jenny Arneson references this data. https://t.co/6bRPDJ6hof
Josh Reimnitz: Need to push higher education to provide teachers and staff that the district needs.
Carla Bates: The board hasn't communicated well to parents and the community about metrics that are crucial for kids
Ed Graff: He wants results to accurately reflect what a student knows on the day of the test.
Eric Moore, E.D. of Research, Evaluation, Assessment &amp; Accountability said it's pretty much the same data, and it's not fun to present.
The takeaway from that photo is the percent of students of color proficient on MCA math --	in 2014: 28%	2015: 28%	2016: 27%
Not the best photo, so tried to darken it a bit. Talking about MCA proficiency https://t.co/Ms5HGAzJip
Others in public comment talked about staff treatment and complained about the condition of fields at South HS.
Several talked about administrative issues at Clara Barton Open School.

A recap from day two of the Minneapolis supe/school board retreat: https://t.co/S04Aeb7VkI
Back to retreat after lunch. Casserly said that with policy work, gaining buy-in of ppl not in the room when it was written is always hard
People in the room shouldn't be surprised by the draft, Asberry said.
Board members presenting suggestions to draft. Rebecca Gagnon said she's having a hard time with process disconnect &amp; has suggestions
.@TeamTracine asks how the board will be able to make sure there's "follow-through."
In the later part of the morning, @ReimTimes presented the policy manual draft. Now, supt./members are going through and voicing thoughts.
Manual purpose in 1-page update: make "clear expectations and roles," "environment for better governance," "narrow focus for greater impact"
Board members are going around the table, airing their voices on the changes to the policy manual and moving forward.
Carla Bates talked about the board's history. She said members need to recognize the past and figure out where to go from here
Another round of community engagement is coming before Board votes. One piece of comm. engagement on policy draft already happened
.@ReimTimes is kicking off the policy discussion here at the retreat.
Casserly: The partnership and commitment between the administration and school board is important.
Back for day two of the Mpls. school board retreat here at Theodore Wirth Park Chalet.

The party is rolling at National Night Out in S. Mpls. This one features water balloons and football. https://t.co/Chdep1Rree
Nelson Inz: The piece discussed about student metrics "hit home," and he said he sees an absence of that in goals.
Casserly: Be clear to the administration and to yourself about what's acceptable.
.@TeamTracine: What about career readiness in addition to college? Some want college, others want trade.
There's talk about adding students to a goal that engages families and the community to support student success
Rebecca Gagnon: metrics and reporting system is important to her.
Michael Casserly on goals for Mpls schools: Do we agree on them?
Tomorrow: potentially, a conversation around policy.
Update: A few minutes into retreat, board members moved tables from horseshoe-style table setup into one rectangle.
@lisamgs and we may do a piece later.
@lisamgs follow both Ale and me. We are both here!
