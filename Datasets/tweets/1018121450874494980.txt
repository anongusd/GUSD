@SarahJKS77 I couldn't agree more, the boarder needs to change. We should build that Wall! Discourage unaccompanied minors from traveling without parents. My family is made up of Legal Immigrants, it's a long process, the civics test is hard but it's right and just to do things legally!

@SarahJKS77 Unfortunately when a minor comes without a parent the US becomes the Worlds foster care program. What do we do with them? You call it incarcerated, but is it really?
@SarahJKS77 Why would you think I assumed anything?
@SarahJKS77 If she was a US citizen and 17, she would still not be allowed an abortion without parental consent. If my 17 year old minor was incarcerated for an offense they committed I would hire an attorney and have no choice but to go through the judicial process. We Are a Country of Laws
@SarahJKS77 I would have to say it became the Government's decision when the 17 year old unacponied minor decided to come to the United States. If it was rape that's a very sad story and I feel sorry for the minor. We are a Country of Laws and anyone who enters our Country is subject to them
