@MichelleKlapper @POTUS @77WABCradio Thank you, great show on tap today 12-3pmET
@TKovachNashvil @Americas_Party @RadioPatriot @larryelder @johncardillo @WayneDupreeShow very interesting point
#RoyMoore NOT conceding in #AlabamaSenateElection! Tells #Alabama  supporters "It's NOT over." #Moore's hoping results tighten to within half a percentage point for a recount. We'll talk about this longshot and how this election affects @POTUS #Trump Wednesday on @77WABCradio.
Breaking: #DougJones narrowly wins #AlabamaSenateElection over #RoyMoore, becoming first Democrat to win #AlabamaSenate seat in two decades. The margin in the US Senate now tightens, 51 #Republicans and 49 #Democrats.
Love this moment! Great to see @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump at recent #WhiteHouse #Christmas Party! #Trump #TrumpTrain #Maga #DonaldTrump https://t.co/OxzvHKoybF via @radio_ink
Update: Law enforcement tell me they believe #PortAuthority bomber #AkayedUllah acted alone &amp; was inspired by #ISIS. He pledged allegiance to the terror group after the low-tech device went off.  Authorities now checking multiple #Brooklyn locations tied to bomber &amp; his family.
