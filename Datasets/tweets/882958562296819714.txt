I support negotiations. I support border security. I sat down w/ the President &amp; a bipartisan group of lawmakers. We need to have hard conversations &amp; we need to find a path forward, but we must end the shutdown before we do irreparable harm to our country &amp; our institutions.
To hold our economy, our national security, and our public servants hostage is not a negotiation tool. It is irresponsible governance.
People keep saying: “Why would the GOP/Pres/McConnell end the shutdown before negotiating for border security &amp; give up their ‘leverage’?”  		Because the function of our gov’t &amp; the pay of our public servants, law enforcement, &amp; Coast Guard should never be considered “leverage”.
We must reopen the government. The negative impact to our economy and our national security worsens day by day.

#VA07 residents, including Donald Goetz, know I will be an independent voice in Washington that represents ALL residents. He's voted Democratic only 5 percent of the time during his life. This year, he said, "I already voted early for Abigail Spanberger."  https://t.co/oITFAWVzjL

Now more than ever, we need to heal the divides in this country. We are a healthier, stronger, and more vibrant nation when we embrace different ideas and earnest, civil debate.
May we all stand together to reject these violent acts and redouble our efforts to unite as a single America with a common purpose and a shared vision.
I am truly saddened that political ideology has driven some to threaten the lives of others. I am grateful no one has been hurt or killed, and I appreciate the efforts of our nation's first responders who acted so quickly and effectively to keep the targets of these attacks safe.

"Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly.”		https://t.co/7lvBxsirZE
GOP bill "could, by undoing what is perhaps the ACA’s single most popular provision, throw consumers back into insurance markets where their ability to purchase affordable insurance would depend on their health."		https://t.co/7lvBxsirZE
"Despite Ryan’s tweet that people with preexisting conditions are protected, there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law." 		https://t.co/p6MdpmIZXr
“That means if the AHCA passes, it would allow for people with pre-existing conditions to be charged more per year for their insurance coverage – possibly to the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per year"		https://t.co/YfOmSzo6MO

Abigail believes we need to add competition to our healthcare system by adding a public option. It will bring down costs and allow communities--especially in rural areas--to access the care they need. #VA07Debate

.@DaveBratVA7th refuses to listen, ignores facts, and does not care about the truth. As Abigail has stated numerous times, she would not support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker, under any circumstances. #VA07Debate #DaveBratSaidThat
Congressman Brat has voted 9 times to repeal the ACA - an empty gesture which costs the taxpayers money and would have taken away lifesaving healthcare from 400,000 Virginians. #VA07Debate #DaveBratSaidThat @DaveBratVA7th https://t.co/459T1mOQbV
In fact, a public option is assessed to create cost savings for the federal government. A 2013 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that a public option insurance plan would save the federal government $158 billion.
Abigail supports Medicare X, which would provide Virginians with more choices and more affordable care, while still covering pre-existing conditions. #VA07Debate

"'Protected' is an odd word choice here. As we have noted, people with preexisting conditions would not be denied coverage. But if they have a gap in coverage, they still could face higher, unaffordable premiums for a year."  		https://t.co/C1detRDcF9
"their [GOP] bill could, by undoing what is perhaps the Affordable Care Act’s single most popular provision, throw consumers back into insurance markets where their ability to purchase affordable insurance would depend on their health."		https://t.co/7lvBxsirZE
"Over time, it would become more difficult for less healthy people (including people with preexisting medical conditions) in those states to purchase insurance because their premiums would continue to increase rapidly.”		https://t.co/7lvBxsirZE
"Despite Ryan’s tweet that people with preexisting conditions are protected, there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law." 		https://t.co/p6MdpmIZXr
“That means if the AHCA passes, it would allow for people with preexisting conditions to be charged more per year for their insurance coverage – possibly to the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per year, some studies have found.”https://t.co/YfOmSzo6MO
"the latest [AHCA] proposal seems to weaken existing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, not strengthen them."		https://t.co/2niNb28ZDF
"GOP bill would allow insurers to charge more for pre-existing conditions"		https://t.co/k0SseVHuY0
There is absolutely no question that the AHCA gutted protections for those with preexisting conditions, and Rep. Brat’s refusal to own up to his votes is an insult to his constituents, especially those with preexisting conditions who would have faced increased healthcare costs. https://t.co/0F09mYgsNQ

Congressman Brat may not be privy to all the national security assessments related to Russia and President Vladimir Putin, but that’s not an excuse for playing politics while our country’s elections were attacked and our democracy is threatened.
As a former CIA officer, I know firsthand the threat #Russia has and continues to pose to our national security, and elected leaders and presidents from both parties have long known and treated Russia as a hostile adversary - until now.
Congressman Brat has chosen not to call out Russia for their cyber warfare, and he has chosen instead to mislead voters about our nation’s longtime understanding of the threat posed by Russia. #VA07
Yesterday, I was disturbed to watch our President side w/Russia over our own intelligence community. Today, I am truly disappointed that in light of one of the most shocking press conferences in US history, @RepDaveBrat appears to have chosen his party allegiance over our country

Here are a few photos from one year ago when after going on TV to discuss the campaign launch, I went for ice cream with my family!
At a time when it seems to many of us that our political divisions are dividing us &amp; splintering our sense of American values, I’m excited to be working side by side w/volunteers &amp; staff who are as motivated as I am to work to bring new, accountable leadership to Washington.
365 days later, we’ve done just that. We’ve moved this district from a “Strong Republican” to a “Toss Up” and we’ve done it by being accessible, focusing on the issues, and getting people motivated to work for the change we want to see in this district and in our country.
A year ago today, we launched our campaign in #VA07. I started with a few volunteers, a supportive family, and the belief that if we worked hard enough, we could make this district competitive and on track to being winnable. https://t.co/TU8CoeOCIq

(4) I urge the Senate to stand up to these efforts to undermine our checks and balances, and oppose Kavanaugh’s nomination.
(3) In nominating Kavanaugh, the President is fulfilling his 2016 pledge to nominate anti-choice judges, but we cannot accept efforts by the executive branch to effectively direct policy through court nominations.
(2) Based on his prior statements and rulings, Kavanaugh’s confirmation would put choice, consumer protections, labor rights, the ACA, environmental protections, and campaign finance reform efforts all under threat.
(1) The President’s nomination of Judge #BrettKavanaugh is yet another step towards fundamentally changing the #SupremeCourt for an entire generation.

I'm horrified by the sounds of terrified children crying for their parents and the notion that politicians are using children as political pawns. The Administration's decision to separate families is a policy choice, not the law, and could be ended as quickly as it was started.
#Juneteenth2018 is more than just a day of celebration (although it most certainly is that)—it’s also a day to reflect on a part of our nation’s history that we must never forget and to recommit ourselves as Americans to respecting and defending human dignity. #VA07

(4/4) The list goes on, and the verdict is clear — every corner of the 7th District should have fast, reliable internet to provide better access to jobs, education, quality healthcare, and more. #VA07
(3/4) Students who lack high-speed internet have trouble completing homework assignments, workforce training, and degree programs which can help them get ahead. Law enforcement and medical professionals need broadband to do their jobs effectively. #VA07
(2/4) Companies are less likely to invest in areas without broadband, meaning that jobs go elsewhere. It is harder to start and grow a small business without the broadband-enabled resources that make life easier for entrepreneurs. #VA07
(1/4) Digital infrastructure is just as important as roads, water mains, and power lines, but in parts of the 7th District, less than half of residents have access to high-speed broadband internet. In some places, like Louisa, it is closer to 1/3. #VA07 https://t.co/rgwIzRtOBn

(2/3) After watching #Congress rush this bill through in less than 2 months &amp; seeing firsthand how Rep. Brat had no interest in listening to constituent concerns or evaluating this bill's impact on them, I knew we deserved better. It was on that day, I decided to run in #VA07.
(1/3) A year ago today, Rep. Brat &amp; 216 other Republicans passed the #AHCA bill.

RT @nytimes: Why do so many Americans kill one another, and how can the violence be stopped? The CDC quit studying these and other question…
Connecting w/the Community	At town halls &amp; community events, I enjoy listening &amp; learning about what's important to families, neighbors, and friends. From Culpeper to Nottoway, I will be a representative who is accountable, and provides a voice, to all residents of the 7th. #VA07
Climate Change	The science is real &amp; I believe climate change is a threat to our economy &amp; national security. Congress should lead the way fighting climate change by researching &amp; investing in renewable energy; huge opportunity to grow this sector &amp; create well-paying jobs.
Higher Education	All students should have access to education &amp; not leave school with massive debt. I will work to make 2&amp;4 year colleges more affordable, increase access to federal grants &amp; loanrepayment/forgiveness opportunities, &amp; strengthen vocational/apprenticeship programs.
Gun Violence Prevention	As a former law enforcement officer, I am comfortable around guns, but believe we must stop gun violence and save lives. I support universal background checks, Extreme Risk Protective Orders, banning bump stocks, and reenacting the assault weapons ban.
Farm Bill	We absolutely need to fully fund, and ensure that SNAP is funded so that we can support those who are most vulnerable and help lift them out of poverty.
Infrastructure Funding	I believe investing in infrastructure is crucial for public safety and economic development. We need to make across the board infrastructure investments, and adopt a long term vision so that our country continues to grow and prosper.
Jobs in Rural VA	High speed broadband, investment in educational training, affordable childcare, and access to healthcare are crucial to attracting jobs &amp; businesses in rural areas, and as a member of Congress, I will ensure that we support and strengthen our rural workers.
Rising Cost of Healthcare	Health insurance should be affordable &amp; accessible for all families. I support Medicare X: lowers cost of coverage by allowing people to buy into Medicare. Combat rising drug prices: I would work to allow Medicare to negotiate directly w/drug companies.
Enhancing #Healthcare in Rural Areas	I believe all Americans should have accessible &amp; affordable healthcare. I support the Save Our Rural Hospitals Act, &amp; would work to increase funding for ambulances, hospitals, &amp; preventative care in rural areas.
What excites you about south side VA?	I am excited to meet neighbors &amp; learn the different needs of our diverse district. I have a strong desire to know all communities, and work to represent their best interests as a member of Congress.
Forum Moderator Pete Smith is kicking things off by introducing Abigail, and sharing how her background will help the residents of south Virginia.

Commenting on Dave Brat’s “nothing burger” attack:	People often misspell Spanberger, but it’s never ‘nothing burger’
Criminal justice reform	There is a systemic problem from the top down. I will work to end disparities in education, legislate to end discrimination, and ensure we are establishing bridges with communities of color.
Women’s rights	I believe that access to women’s healthcare is a social and economic issue, and will fight to support all efforts in Congress to protect these rights.
Small businesses	Strengthening healthcare is an economic issue that will help small businesses grow and thrive. I believe in a robust and accessible healthcare system. Rep. Brat has negatively impacted small businesses and their workers by working to repeal and kill the ACA.
Support legislation requiring Presidential candidates to release their tax returns:	Yes, it is important to fully understand the financial ties of candidates running to lead this nation.
Gun Violence Prevention	I have fought the NRA for 3 years through Moms Demand Action. In Congress, I will advocate for background checks on all purchases, ban bump stocks and assault rifles, allow the CDC to study gun violence, and support emergency risk protection orders.
Year of the Woman	Virginia had a head start in 2017, but we are going to bring it home in 2018 across the country. Come November, I look forward to helping rectify the gender disparity in Congress.
Protecting the LGBTQ community	I will do everything possible to protect the rights of our LGBTQ neighbors. I would advocate for the Equality Act, which addresses discrimination, and fight to protect the rights of adoptive parents.
Supporting another Democrat after primary	Yes. I have a singular focus – to flip this seat. To do that, we need to ensure every Democrat votes. Our campaign is building up our volunteer base and making inroads in communities across the district. Together, we will defeat Brat.
How has your past experience made you a force for change in gov?	As a former CIA operations officer, I ran multi-million dollar programs to fight terrorist threats. I had to collect tremendous amounts of information for policymaker &amp; will use my skills to make informed decisions.
Medical marijuana	I support the CARES Act and HR 1227. I also support HR 1220 which would reschedule marijuana from Class I to Class III.
Opening:	I get my passion from my mother. She instilled a sense of duty to fight for people in need. We need leaders who show grit to ensure we are strong on education, healthcare, women, LGBTQ, immigrant, &amp; gun violence prevention issues. I will be that leader in Congress.
The crowd is fired up to #flipthe7th https://t.co/wzO0NyG5Qt

Closing statements.	"I believe deeply in this community, I believe in a strong #BlueWave in 2018, and I believe deeply that every elected legislator has a responsibility to make the lives of its constituents better. I will be that representative for all residents of the 7th." https://t.co/VzmPBnC60Z
Audience Question: "Are you willing to get in Dave Brat's Grill?"	"I'm there, and I intend to stay there."
"In this climate of discarding facts, it is important for every member of Congress to have the humility to go to the experts and request information so they can make informed, well-founded, and well-rounded decisions."
Opioid crisis:	"First, we need to emphasize prevention through education. Second, addiction is a disease and we need to ensure access to mental health services, facilities they need, and a strong healthcare system."
District fundraising:	"50% of our contributions are from within the 7th. Our campaign made the choice to prioritize engagement with residents in the district, as they are the ones who will be voting. This seat is winnable, and our campaign is built on the voters in the district."
Rural broadband:	"This is an economic, business, and educational issue. Members of Congress must act, and I see this is a perfect opportunity for a leader from the 7th to work with Reps from across the country to benefit our citizens."
"Members of Congress fail to look at long-term goals, they want immediate results. I will bring a long-term view so we can support all our citizens, from the youngest to the oldest, and make investments now that bring continued opportunities down the road."
"I will fight to ensure the middle-class is lifted up. When they are stable, it will be a positive benefit to society."
Income inequality: "There are a number of things we should be doing: making education a priority for our students, increasing access to apprenticeships &amp; raising the minimum wage. We also have to address healthcare as the middle-class is spending way too much out of their pocket"
Foreign election interference:	"As a former intelligence officer, I know how Russia is working to undermine the stability of our democracy. I urge everyone to seek out facts, read reputable sources, like the @RTDNEWS, and make sure what you are reading is factual."
Education:	"Among the first things I will do, will be to fight to make sure that the government lives up the promises it has made to our children."
Budget deficit:	"It is unacceptable that we are adding billions, upon billions of dollars, to the deficit that our children will have to pay back one day."
Audience question about the recent tragedy in Florida.	"No child should be afraid to be in his or her classroom, no parent should be afraid that their child won't come home, no woman in a relationship should be scared that her partner might kill her if she doesn't listen."
Accessing affordable healthcare is a life and death issue.  Education and a growing economy is crucial to the lives and members of our community.
Candidate introductions.  Abigail: "When I was a CIA officer, I met with assets and the outcome of those meetings wholly depended on my ability to listen. The ability to listen could mean helping thwart a terrorist attack. A matter of life and death."
Moderator Gene Rossi, "If I was a #Republican running in 2018, I would be scared to death." @rossi4va

I agree with my fellow candidate and former CIA officer, @ElissaSlotkin. Our law enforcement agencies and military don’t accept threats against our country and citizens because they are difficult to stop. Instead, they work harder to keep people safe. Congress should do the same. https://t.co/vDkdMUQmbb
Our children shouldn’t be afraid of dying at school, and parents shouldn’t feel pangs of fear when their kids get on the bus. Our elected leaders need to take action to avoid these tragedies. My heart breaks for these families, and I’m so deeply sorry for their unimaginable loss.

Furthermore, the inclusion of washing machines in this act is a blatant giveaway to corporate interests, with no consideration for the middle-class consumers who will be left with higher costs and fewer options on the market.
To take such action under the guise of protecting American workers is wrong, and in fact, the Solar Energy Industries Association estimates it will limit growth by 23,000 possible jobs.
However, with 60% of the world’s solar panels manufactured in China, this tariff will have a massive negative impact on jobs and the solar industry in the United States.
There is no economic sense to this decision. The job of installing solar panels has been estimated to be the fastest growing occupation in the US over the next 10 years.	https://t.co/gDB1GniDRR #Flipthe7th #SpanbergerVA07 #TeamSpanberger
