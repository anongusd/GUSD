My heart breaks again. My thoughts are with the families of this tragedy. Once more, I find myself asking, how many students have to die before we act to stop this epidemic of mass shootings? Tired of hearing it‚Äôs too soon to discuss ‚Äì for these innocent children, it‚Äôs too late.
At a time when we should be investing in our communities, the @GOP is pushing deep cuts. I strongly oppose the #FarmBill2018.
And of course, this all comes on the heels of Republicans‚Äô tax handout that gives 83% of its benefits to the wealthiest 1% of Americans and a $1.3 trillion break to corporations, even those that ship jobs overseas.
In fact, every dollar in SNAP for hungry families returns money to farmers, generates $1.79 in overall economic activity, and supports more than 560,000 jobs across the country.
This bill would cause 670,000 Philadelphians to struggle with more hunger, malnutrition and long-term health problems ‚Äì especially our most vulnerable. In PA, 44% of SNAP recipients are under age 18, and 23% are elderly or disabled.
It cuts $23 billion in SNAP benefits that children, seniors, students, 1.5 million veterans, 23,000 servicemembers, individuals with disabilities and working families rely on to keep from going hungry.
THREAD: For the first time in decades, the @GOP majority is advancing a #FarmBill that is shamefully polarizing; a blatant assault on vulnerable communities across America.

Today marks the 8th year of conflict in Syria. Sadly, the situation has worsened - particularly in Eastern Ghouta where the Assad regime continues to target innocent civilians. The international community is watching. We must hold Assad + Putin accountable. https://t.co/IQgvPjD8ol
I sincerely hope that this is only the start. There‚Äôs a lot more that can and must be done to hold Russia accountable for their ongoing hostility to the US and our allies. (3/3)
Russia attacked our democracy and used chemical weapons on foreign soil. But, today‚Äôs sanctions only target those identified in Special Counsel‚Äôs indictment and many who were already sanctioned by the Obama admin. (2/3)
THREAD: The administration‚Äôs decision to implement long overdue sanctions on Russia is severely inadequate and falls short of the bipartisan legislation passed by Congress. @realDonaldTrump may get the headline he‚Äôs seeking, but Putin is the only one who should be celebrating.
878 days for a preliminary hearing on life-sustaining disability benefits is unacceptable. I recently met with the head of @SocialSecurity to demand answers to this crisis and set benchmarks for progress. Thank you @InqCVargas for pursuing this story relentlessly. https://t.co/HokRDDMv14

Time and time again, studies show #paidleave is good for workers, families, biz and our economy. The country needs the #FAMILYAct! #FMLA24
