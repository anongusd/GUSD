@rrretired2008 @summer_soul1 @brithume Your failure to acknowledge facts doesn‚Äôt prevent facts from existing. You compare my statements to kings and yet you deny the same rights that the very Kings you compare me to denied. Tyrants deny facts and you are so very clearly one of their loyalists. Natural Rights are FACT.

@rrretired2008 @summer_soul1 @brithume Giving government the power to ‚Äòcreate‚Äô rights for certain groups that apply unequally for said group over another under the guise of justice only sets precedent for the opposite and inevitably brings tyranny to the land of the free. Government doesn‚Äôt create rights.
@rrretired2008 @summer_soul1 @brithume Are you saying because a government denies Natural Rights that they don‚Äôt exist? Thats false, just because a government would deny them doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist. Like wise once a government recognizes them it doesn‚Äôt mean the government granted them, hence being natural.
@rrretired2008 @summer_soul1 @brithume Typical extrapolation by someone promoting tyranny. Natural Laws apply to ALL people. You seem confused. Government didn‚Äôt give your mother the right to vote, they denied it until 1920. We don‚Äôt need special laws for them, just that the gov‚Äôt recognizes natural rights equally.
@rrretired2008 @summer_soul1 @brithume Is the existence of such unnatural rights not a fundemental change to the values set forth by Americas founders?

@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Behaves like what? Says the things we‚Äôre all thinking? Oooo, so scary. You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôd rather have a disingenuous king lording over me, demanding royalities be paid rather than giving me a tax break.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump The cause is far from lost; thats why you can‚Äôt get over 2016. I just know that no matter how hard I try, I can lead a horse to water, but can‚Äôt make it drink.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump I am beginning to get it; you are self aware. You are saying you cannot have a rational/civil debate because you are not rational/civil. Sorry. Have a nice day.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Yes, #WeThePeople are the super elite. And yes he skirts Positive laws! And I am sure he has used Positive laws to skirt natural laws, why? Because he can, because the ignorant allow it. Get rid of the positive law and guess what, no more skirting of Natural Laws.

@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Laws created by the elite to ‚Äúempower‚Äù the people, empower not the people but the elites for then they have control over who ‚Äúthe people‚Äù are.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump I am not saying bring back brainlets, I am saying promote the good that was established in 1776; the good that takes power away from despots and gives it to the people. The Rights which are being trampled upon by the very elites we declared independence from. Why help them?
@edbott For somebody to suggest that Trumps Oval Office address was a disaster is Chuck &amp; Nancy hilarious!
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Were there racists brainlets in ‚Äò76? Yes. Could we have won independence without them no. Because we allied with them does that make Natural law wrong? No. Have we slowly been fighting to apply them to all? Yes. Positive law has only hampered that progress; promoting segregation.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre nuts if you think that is what I am advocating for. Read what I‚Äôve said and let your prejudices against me go. We can recognize &amp; promote Natural Laws, which first occurred in 1776, in the modern day &amp; not give up our technical achievements. They‚Äôre not mutally exclusive.
@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @Tea4gunsSC @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Here to promote Americanism and prevent old world despots from subverting the ignorant into undoing 1776. Can you explain what I‚Äôve asked? It‚Äôs a simple question. How are laws that segregate citizens into groups not segregation, but laws applied to all equally are?

@DavMicRot @SecNielsen Its not that compassion is lacking, but rather that compassion is irrelivant to promoting &amp; protecting Natural/Negative laws over that of Positive Laws; especially when showing compassion would be used to justify Positive law, undoing exactly what those coming to America seek.

@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump I don‚Äôt expect you to understand as you refuse to do anything but laugh at the notion of there being a difference in whether a law is founded in Nature or Human ambition.
@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump You are falling for Projections. The establishment who make those accusations about Trump are in fact the predators themselves. This goes back to the despot loyalists in American government seeding antiAmericanism in an attempt to undo Natural Laws, Rights and the #SpiritOf76
@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Keep ad homineming, I‚Äôll fight for the success of Natural Laws over Positive Laws everyday, for you, your children, your childrens children and myself. As Jesus said, ‚ÄúFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."
@raphifix @DavMicRot And as I come to that conclusion of the establishment tactics based on their actions &amp; manipulations in the past, so can many others. I believe Trump is one of those many &amp; is why I voted for him. So far, he‚Äôs proving my thoughts correct. Establishment is having a temper tantrum.
@raphifix @DavMicRot I think we are just not going to agree, I believe its quite clear he reads. If you argue that he doesn‚Äôt read what he is told to, then yes I probably agree because what he is told to read by the establishment is more than likely garbage put together attempting to manipulate him.
@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump You‚Äôre the one clowning around about Poistive and Negative law. Something very detrimental to your own very natural rights! You‚Äôre practically telling me that I am clowning around for being serious and concerned about you laughing for shooting yourself in the foot.
@raphifix @DavMicRot As to whether or not he reads, I can‚Äôt say, I‚Äôm inclined to believe he does based off his actions and statements. I‚Äôm also inclined to believe the #FakeNews is Anti-American &amp; their statements to be taken with a serious grain of salt, as they‚Äôre known to manipulate public opinion
@raphifix @DavMicRot Pretty sure this tweet here includes an inference that Trump is illiterate.
@raphifix @DavMicRot As a side note, see how irrefutable proof was given without sourcing to right or left wing #FakeNews?
@raphifix @DavMicRot You‚Äôve just back yourself into a corner. To literally believe the man is illiterate &amp; can‚Äôt learn IS #FakeNews. Especially when said just because ones opinions differ from his. The man tweets! Irrefutable proof he can read. He also has changed his stance proving learned behavior!
@raphifix @DavMicRot You fail to understand. I ask if you think for yourself or just parrot #FakeNews &amp; to prove to me you think for yourself you parrot #FakeNews. Its not Trump tweeting then because he is illiterate. Which means what he has done wasn‚Äôt him &amp; MSM blames him for it. Even more #Fake!
In 100 years, this is what will be said of Barrack Obama. #Legacy https://t.co/6ISEfaMWYS
@raphifix @DavMicRot According to the British though, the founders were dumb pagans who couldn‚Äôt tell up from down. They knew this because the British newspapers, regulated by their government, told them so. #SoundsFamiliar
@raphifix @DavMicRot Not sure which Trump you are watching; the one that gets edited and manipulated on TV or the Real Life unedited actions and words of our President? I imagine its the former, because if you truly believe what you say, you‚Äôd see Trump falls into those categories the founders do.
@raphifix @DavMicRot The extension of schooling directly correlates with the increase of Positive law &amp; Governments need to indoctrinate youth into believing those laws just; not by explaining negative vs. positve law, but rather by convoluting all laws, confusing people &amp; playing off ignorance.
@raphifix @DavMicRot To clear it up, education is not about memorization of edicate and social norms to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù in life. Education is to teach one how to perpetually learn without guidance of some institution or person. Thats why it was so short. Now schooling is over a decade, nearly from birth.
@raphifix @DavMicRot You doubt because of bias &amp; blinders made by #Despots. 		The *leaders* were experienced. Modern education aligns closer to indoctrination than to Liberal Experience. I assure you, Trump is experienced; I also assure you he is not indoctrinated. Thats why the establishment is mad.
@DavMicRot Guess what, so were a good portion of the people who fought in the Revolution founding this country. Illiteracy is irrelavant to understanding the difference between Negative laws and Positive Laws and how #Tyrants use the latter to stifle #Liberty.
@Darren_Garbutt @DianeAzarian @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump The fact that you laugh at this proves you are lacking the #SpiritOf76. There is nothing funny about Natural Laws being trampled upon. Would you laugh at someone denying gravity exists? Especially if they were trying to implement laws to ban you from saying it does? #Tyrants
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump My belief is not based on feeling, but observation. It‚Äôs because of people like you that the founders had to go to war to fight for Americanism and our Natural Rights to be recognized as fact. I‚Äôll ask again, do you follow positive law or negative law?
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump These are simply observations &amp; I am not ignoring you. I understand your opinions &amp; if you can believe it or not, held them once too, but through questioning realized how nieve they are. There is absolutely no justifying Positive Law in the sense that it is used today. #Division
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Sadly, you‚Äôre right about the laws, but because they exist doesn‚Äôt make them just. I do however get to decide who I believe follows Americanism, just as I can determine if someone follows Communism or Socialism. The division lies between supporters of Positive and Negative law.
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Whats your argument here? Where is the hypocrisy?
@DianeAzarian @Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump You only prove your ignorance of just what Americanism is when you conflate positive and negative law; especially after I‚Äôve point out which one Americanism follows. We‚Äôve a lot of Positive law in place attempting to under mine Americanism. Do you support Positive law?
@Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 @realDonaldTrump Why was Thomas Paine anonymous when he wrote ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô? Its almost as if you‚Äôve never thought about fighting tyrants. Sadly, thats probably because you are one. I will wait for a real rebuttal though.
@Darren_Garbutt @AJDelgado13 Laugh all you want, @realDonaldTrump stands for Natural Laws and Rights (the founding of America) &amp; the left stands for Positive Law (Old world despotism).

@doubtthat11 The British ended slavery but supported the Confederates. My point is that they are hypocrits. They did it so they could talk down to us in the press. Call the Northerns complicit. All they wanted to do is divide America because we will ALWAYS be better.

@doubtthat11 They tricked the South into going to war over it and they would have aided the South of not for Lincoln signing a peace treaty (and not blowing the British ship out of the water) 		But keep defending the Crown you Anti American Loyalist
@doubtthat11 Yes the Europeans will do anything to appear better and trick Americans to handing their rights away. That's why the British ended slavery first. Not because it was right but to try and erase their despotic history. And people actually fucking buy it.
@WheresMyArk_23 @conservmillen If his Comedy show on a Comedy network was solely about comedy why did he go on those networks to advertise? Shouldn't they just buy ads in the appropriate timeslots?

@doubtthat11 America was and is the only real socialist country, since 1776. It‚Äôs been hijacked by Euro Despots, disguising despotism as the right of the working class to rule. Sorry, we have that in America. You almost can't tell anymore tho.

@alania1985 A weird thing to complain about? If all three of them weren't together in the first trilogy what was the point? And all three of them were never together. The fact that we don't have a shot of Old Han, Old Leia, Old Luke, Chewie, C3-PO &amp; R2 in the cockpit of the Millium falcon is

@KamalaHarris Make no mistake - Loyalists to the Old World (Europe/Asia) have been abdicating Americanism since we declared independence from them in 1776. This becomes even more apparent when said loyalists scream and cry when America reasserts it's independence and truly strives for Liberty.
