@Channel9 My favourite Ch.9 show would have to be The Big Bang Theory, hands down.
@MMFlint Snipers play an important role inclusive of killing. Yes it's horrible, but I don't think they're cowards. I think some are heroes.
@chrispytweets Thanks Chris:) Hope all is well with you too.

@miss_elisa_lee @FollowBDT Completely agree. Drugs should be equally as entitled to freedom from stigmatisation alongside mental illness.
