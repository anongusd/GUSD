@neal_katyal I expect him to get on board quickly.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Afraid to callout the Lt. Governor's "problem" because it's in the same category as @realDonaldTrump???
@Bakari_Sellers Seems like an obsession with black music artist.  So bizarre!

@Amy_Siskind @BernieSanders please stay away.  This will end badly for Democrats.
@mschlapp How can this happen if you hire the best people?
@esglaude I believe people confuse being a Christian with being able to accept everything.  Not true. Forgiveness and consequences for actions can co exist.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Border security or a wall? Acknowledge that your messaging is flawed.
We wake up to a partial government shutdown. Americans not working because of funding for a wall that Mexico was suppose to pay for.  Say a prayer for all the Americans impacted by this unfortunate and avoidable circumstance.  Some things should be bigger than politics!
