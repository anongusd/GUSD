.@ChiefNGB has repeatedly praised the @USNationalGuard State Partnership program. He said two more partnerships will be formed in the near future.
.@USNationalGuard must do a better job of recruiting, @ChiefNGB said.		"That is a big problem for us going forward."
Another 10,000 Guardsmen are on state active duty at the border, combating drugs, fighting fires and responding to winter storms. https://t.co/lGqPPoU7ww
