Total cost for storm response will be much higher, mostly to pay for staff overtime, that will come back to Council in future.
Council approves $9 mil to cover initial storm response costs, mostly for debris removal. City's savings account will be used to pay for this, expect to get federal reimbursement for some of that. Shows importance of having strong savings account.
Council now asking citizens to have patience as we continue debris pickup, working as fast as we can. Also thanking citizens for helping their friends, neighbors.
So far, have already picked up more than debris from Hurricane Matthew. And make that up to 1.2 million cubic yards of total debris, not counting dangerous tree limbs and construction debris, to be removed.
Current progress: 57 trucks now picking up debris &amp; more coming. Crews picking up 30,000+ cubic yards of debris a day. In total, expect up to 1 MILLION cubic yards of debris, far surpassing any storm in recent history.
City will begin pick up of construction debris on Oct. 8, hope to be done in a week with that type of debris.
Big tractor trailer trucks in town to pick up the debris quickly, but trucks so big, can't go lots of places. Have brought in smaller trucks for those locations. All trucks, each load, must be checked by federal monitors.
Public Services Director Dave Mayes now reports on debris removal: 32 crews, many contracted workers, got all 400 miles of city streets cleared in four days.
Federal gov't won't reimburse for commercial/multifamily debris removal, but city will pick up anyway.
Crews still working to remove dangerous tree limbs.
Mr. Caudle says the city expects FEMA/state to cover most of city's costs to respond to the storm, but will take a while.
While many parks are still closed due to downed trees and other safety issues, we are making progress and some are now open!  For up-to-date information on city parks, go to https://t.co/YkftP6jcUS https://t.co/e7R3fa1yEf
