@GayRepublicSwag I think they played it smart. ANY R that would have questioned her would have been crusified as attacking the victim. This was the only way they could avoid that. The point was to gather info and see if she was credible, she wasn't.
RT @thebradfordfile: SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM IS ON FIRE.		LISTEN. 👇👇 https://t.co/n8wSvrPH4j
@YanceyMc @Manishka78 @paulsperry_ Actually, the testimony just given states Leland does not support her claimes and does not remember the so called party.
@seanmdav I thought she'd go along but she chickened out.
@paulsperry_ Well, she wasn't allowed to say she knew till her lawyers said so.
@AlwaysIntegrity She's playing dumb. She wanted this public hearing because it was supposed to be "mean old white men" beating up on a poor helpless innocent victim.
@YanceyMc @Manishka78 @paulsperry_ Which would be irrelevant when ALL others at said house deny any and all knowledge of her allegations.
@EWErickson Males who are falling for the "sweet, innocent dumb blonde" routine? The women are not falling for it cause we know it when we see it in our fellow females! 🤣🤣🤣🤣😜😜😜😜
@Techno_Fog She is not there to grill her or attack. Notes are being taken of the discrepancies, lies and contradictions. All will be layed out in clear and cohesive statements later by the R's. They will attack her story later, not her.

@Cernovich "She believes her story" doesn't make it true. She's persuasive if your not paying attention to the discrepancies in her story and the conveinient lack of memory when needed.
@StefanMolyneux And she said she was crying during it.
@tponews She is playing dumb. With years less education and life experience she has had, I'm smarter than her?? Fake!
She either DID talk to others about this, or she DIDN'T. Depending on the question. Anyone else seeing this?
@Techno_Fog @canyyoulove And because her house didn't look good from the street!??!! 😜
@KatiePavlich @AmyMek Good catch! Discrepancies everywhere.
So far, the person who violated her, used her, and is currently responsible for the anguish she is going through right now, is Feinstein. This is per Ford's own testimony.
RT @perfectsliders: Do you believe in Brett Kavanaugh?
@EricMMatheny oh and she seems to know how much everyone else was drinking too.
RT @AmyMek: Juanita Broadrick is at the #KavanaughHearings to “look hypocrites Schumer, Durbin &amp; Feinstein in the eye &amp; ask for an apology”…
@JoyceWhiteVance We are going through this process because Feinstein leaked her letter to the press and outed her at the 11th hour. Had Feinstein gone by the books this entire thing would have been handled in private and Ford would not be enduring this now.
I am so happy that all the Dems. are doing nothing but grandstanding and hoping people will believe her because sexual abuse exists. So transparently rediculous.
@TheMarkPantano Yeah, saw that, almost puked, or laughed, whatever :)
ask her what song was playing! It should be ingrained in her memory for all time. Never able to hear the song again without being reminded of it.
@tponews Just because they don't say "HA, gottcha" doesn't mean they didn't
RT @KurtSchlichter: Can I point out she's changing her story agin or is that not allowed?
@tponews I don't agree, yet. She knows how to talk to witnesses and has already gotten her to change the story she wrote in the letter and admitted to faulty memory on some issues, be patient.
@tponews She is pointing out her changing story and iffy memory, pay attention, this is how they work

@charliekirk11 Lindsay G just said the one he knows of is crazy as a loon and not believable. Sorry but these statements, without evidence, are not beliveable either. Motives? Are you kidding, people will say anything right now, none of this is believeable. :(
@stazdoggie @tedlieu I think these 2 men should not be believed without coming out and testifing under oath either. And then, you would have to decide if they are credible enough to be believed.
@Montemiletto93 Lindsay Graham just said the one he knows about isn't credible and crazy as a loon.
@quickslanding I believe they do see it for what it is. I think they are handling this masterfully. It is a trap to "prove" R's treat women bad. They didn't, they haven't, and the D's are furious there set up hasn't worked, it backfired. 😜

RT @JulianSvendsen: @realDonaldTrump What will you vote in midterms? (Please help by retweeting and following after voting!) https://t.co/O…
@PhilMcCrackin44 @RickLRobbins I am 100% for Kavanaugh, but, how can he claim to have not been at the party if no one even knows, including herself, which party it was? just sayin'.... :(
@SharletteH @ValerieJarrett Well, since she claimed to have never told anybody, these "facts" could be a little hard to come by
@mariedowler @chuckwoolery I believe they were expecting the R's to refuse a hearing and Trump to come out bashing her, (destroying the R's in the mid terms). Now they have nothing, and they know it. I love this President :)
@chuckwoolery No one finds them credible, they just want a vote delay. They don't care if it's real or not.
@dbongino Everybody sees this for what it is. The only ones pretending to believe this just want the vote delayed until after Nov. She claimed to have remembered since 2012, why wait till now?
@adadnamedChris @PollingAmerica @OleanderNectar @FBI She is refusing to answer questions. How can anyone investigate an accusation with no facts to look into? She doesn't remember ANYTHING and the only other men she claimed would know denied it. True story or not, there is no way to investigate this.
