The #DRC was within reach of what would have been its first democratic and peaceful transition of power since 1960. Unfortunately, after the flawed handling of the country’s election, this long-sought goal has eluded the Congolese people once again.		https://t.co/5UdYzizWqE

Yesterday's hearing has only confirmed what we already knew--evasive and untrue answers don’t meet the standard for a lifetime appointment.
With his opening statement and answers at yesterday's hearing, we can now be equally certain that Judge Kavanaugh is clearly incapable of the dispassionate, non-partisan or mature thought our nation’s highest judicial office requires.
We already knew Kavanaugh is a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States of America who is willing to use calculated dishonesty to advance his own career.
As a onetime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I considered the truthfulness of judicial nominees as a non-negotiable quality. Lying under oath cannot and must not be rewarded with a seat on the nation’s highest court. 	https://t.co/0A1npeVfEo
The fact that Kavanaugh would almost certainly rule to protect President Trump from investigation is another sad part of this illegitimate process. But these new documents show Kavanaugh's lack of truthfulness alone disqualifies him. @LegitAction 		https://t.co/OpbnIBHVhO
When I served in the Senate, I never doubted the legitimacy of the nomination process for a Supreme Court nominee. But after the way @BarackObama and Merrick Garland were treated, it's clear this process is off the rails.
He was a modern-day rough rider, and those of us who knew him well will longingly remember those days when we could join the charge by his side.	@SenJohnMcCain #McCain  	https://t.co/P6tejCEDjX
Like so many others, I will greatly miss my friend @SenJohnMcCain. We will all be poorer without his leadership.
This isn’t the first time we have seen a conspiracy theory elevated and racial tensions stoked so Trump can distract from his own problems.  I join with others in condemning the untrue comments made about South Africa which are aligned with hateful thoughts and violent behavior.
The consequences for the crimes we're hearing about for Cohen and Manafort should be swift and severe.  It also could be the tip of the iceberg. The Republicans have a legitimacy problem, &amp; today's news shows it's going to get worse before it gets better.		https://t.co/fbapnPzyRz

In his speech in MKE today, Russ discussed the importance of paid family leave for working Wisconsinites. #Russ4Us http://t.co/38g5tygNXn
#Russ4Us http://t.co/Y04hkagG26
#Russ4Us http://t.co/ar3upy4W7R
Russ on TPP: “It doesn’t matter how you dress it up, it’s still a giveaway to corporations &amp; a punch in the gut to working Wisconsinites.”
“Second, the Senate must never again threaten a shutdown of our government for partisan game-playing and one-upmanship.” #Russ4Us
#Russ4Us http://t.co/GcFi6fXeWM
“But still today, Democrats and Republicans both agree that banks are still ‘too big to fail.’” #Russ4Us
“I was one of only 8 Senators to vote against repealing the law that prevented investment banks from gambling w/ our savings account.”
“There’s work to be done in the Senate to lay the groundwork for an economy that works for all Wisconsinites.” #Russ4Us
“Everyone agrees that building a career, a family, &amp; a future is rarely easy. But far too many say the work &amp; worry they do to scrape by.”
#Russ4Us http://t.co/vYsiXeeMHS
“Finally, we must provide paid family leave for parents.” #Russ4Us
“We must help families have access to lending that’s available, transparent, and fair.” #Russ4Us
“Imagine such a country -- where our doctors, our teachers, our scientists -- come almost exclusively from families of privilege.” #Russ4Us
“Too many in Washington, like the incumbent Senator, have no idea what it’s like to need student loans.” #Russ4Us
#Russ4Us http://t.co/oCevai0EI7
“But we can act now, by making student loans subject to refinancing, just like we do with mortgages.” #Russ4Us
“Student debt is now an economic crisis, totaling nearly $1.2 trillion of debt, with seven in ten Wisconsinites graduating in debt in 2013.”
“My likely opponent, the incumbent senator, opposes entirely a federal minimum wage.” #Russ4Us
#Russ4Us http://t.co/VzjMqdEnnI
“Raising the minimum wage to $12 would mean a raise for nearly 400,000 women in Wisconsin and help to close the gender wage gap.” #Russ4Us
“Just matching inflation since the ‘70s would add more than two dollars to our current federal minimum wage.” #Russ4Us
“Basics like food and housing have become more expensive, but comparatively the buying power of the minimum wage has decreased.” #Russ4Us
“Our federal minimum wage -- $7.25 -- has not come close to matching inflation.” #Russ4Us
“Sometimes, people tell me they can’t pay their bills because their wages are just too low.” #Russ4Us
“I am alarmed by how many people who have a job -- or multiple jobs, tell me that they still can’t pay their bills.” #Russ4Us
#Russ4Us http://t.co/2zGKHqa6qR
“Joe Ruskey, owner of Dependable Solutions… brought up the issue of broadband, specifically, the lack of broadband access in that region.”
“In June, I had the opportunity to sit down for lunch with a number of community leaders and business owners in Prairie du Chien.”
“Also, I frequently heard across WI the concern that we need to invest in our transportation, water, &amp; digital infrastructure.” #Russ4Us
“It will benefit not just our students, but the employers who are so eager or even desperate for qualified workers.” #Russ4Us
“I’m encouraged by proposals to make 2-year community college programs more accessible.” #Russ4Us
“Trained welders once were hard to come by, the demand has now shifted to those specializing in auto electric &amp; heavy diesel mechanics.”
#Russ4Us http://t.co/N12Es9e05B
“Just last month, in beautiful Forest County, in northeast Wisconsin, I visited Hometown Trolley in Crandon.” #Russ4Us
“Despite a top-line unemployment rate that’s fallen, some people in Wisconsin still can’t find a good-paying job.” #Russ4Us
“The promise of a full economic recovery has sometimes seemed possible, but so far has still fallen short.” #Russ4Us
“As I travel the state, I hear the same concern: this economy still isn’t working well enough for the families in WI who work the hardest.”
“Wall Street earnings reports are up. Those at the very top have recovered, and then some.” #Russ4Us
“We’ve made some progress. In October ’09, unemployment peaked at 10% -- last month, our national unemployment rate was 5.3%.” #Russ4Us
“The people of WI want us to get things done that will move us toward greater economic well-being for all WI families.” #Russ4Us
“That’s the reason I’m running for the U.S. Senate: to help provide the leadership in Washington to actually get things done.” #Russ4Us
“This work requires listening, and then it requires action -- not lectures, excuses, or partisan sermons.” #Russ4Us
“The spirit of unity is still Wisconsin’s guiding principle.” #Russ4Us
“Despite the attempts to divide and conquer us, the people I’ve met across WI still carry WI’s traditions of optimism and collaboration.”
“The people of Wisconsin deserve respect -- all of the people of Wisconsin deserve respect. They should be listened to first.” #Russ4Us
“By the end of this week, I will have heard from people in all 72 counties.” -RDF #Russ4Us
"Three months ago, when we launched our campaign... I announced that I’d be hitting the road... to all of Wisconsin’s 72 counties.” #Russ4Us
