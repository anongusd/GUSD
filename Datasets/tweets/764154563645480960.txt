@AP So does she thinks that made it all ok?
@kathygriffin Sorry, Kathy. We've all seen your pathetic video and can't un-see it just because you are now being reprimanded.
I agree @_tyratucker This is over the top. Consequences are necessary! UnAmerican, to say the least! https://t.co/yA0miZwjXs
Can't believe anyone even hired her. MSNBC must have pretty low standards... https://t.co/lr5nh4rHUk

@PressSec @POTUS Grateful for you, Sean. Sorry you have to deal with rude media. Must make your job difficult.

@BreitbartNews Well that explains a lot, proof they are indeed American Idiots. Will cease listening to their "music".
Absolutely! Defund all sanctuary cities and states. Immigration needs to go through the proper channels. https://t.co/lLFXQWTqGh

@TuckerCarlson @CristobalJAlex @FoxNews I agree!
If I choose to not renew my driver's license will that make me an "undocumented driver"?
@jeffsessions @POTUS Thank you for clarifying that there are so many Americans who DON'T want sanctuary cities! We have laws for a reason!

@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Still a sore loser, Hillary?
It's so obvious. The Dems are just a flock of sheep. Not one of them is able to think for themselves.
