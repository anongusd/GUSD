More on why this is exactly the kind of policymaking America's kids and families need their leaders championing, via the @amprog report that first put forth the idea:	https://t.co/QbvLGgyPmS
And why focus on boosting incomes for families w/very young kids (&lt; age 5) with this new Young Child Tax Credit? 		B/c the first few years of life are so critical to kids' development--including brain development. 		Exposure to poverty during childhood has lifelong consequences.
@amprog @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet @rosadelauro @SuzanDelBene Why make the Young Child Tax Credit monthly, you ask? 		Because lots of expenses related to raising a child (diapers, infant formula...) don't wait for tax time.		The monthly YCTC would enable families to meet their kids' needs now instead of waiting for a lump sum tax refund.
@amprog @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet @rosadelauro @SuzanDelBene Between this, the creation of the new monthly Young Child Tax Credit, and other important features to strengthen the existing CTC, the American Family Act would on its own cut child poverty in the U.S. **nearly in half.**
@amprog @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet @rosadelauro @SuzanDelBene Another really important part of the bill that will get buried: it makes the existing Child Tax Credit **fully refundable** -- so it will reach the poorest children &amp; families, ~11 million of whom currently get no CTC at all or just a tiny amount under current law.
@amprog @SenSherrodBrown @SenatorBennet @rosadelauro @SuzanDelBene Incredible to see such broad support for this legislation:		- 35 Senate cosponsors	- 173 House cosponsors	- Every major 2020 Dem hopeful is on the bill

And the kicker: Many inmates with disabilities are held in solitary confinement‚Äîreportedly, in many cases, for their own protection, due to a lack of appropriate alternative accommodations. 		Few experiences are as likely to cause or exacerbate psychological distress as solitary.

Tell Trump what you think about him siding with payday loan sharks over the borrowers whose financial hardship they get rich off of: https://t.co/e1uLmE76SE		Deadline to comment: May 15, 2019. 		#StopTheDebtTrap
Note: Trump's trying to gut borrower protections using the federal rulemaking process.		This means--just like with his proposed SNAP cuts I've been tweeting so much about lately--we have the chance to use the public comment process to preserve the rule to #StopTheDebtTrap.
The payday loan industry's very business model relies on trapping people in debt.		That's why 4 in 5 borrowers end up having to roll over the loan or taking out a second to repay the first.		So naturally, Trump's rushing to payday's defense by gutting rules to #StopTheDebtTrap. https://t.co/aq73aTM4XI

/gonna leave it there for now, but will share lots more thoughts in real-time as things get underway in a bit...
FACT: For less than the cost of the #TrumpTaxScam, we could END POVERTY IN AMERICA.  https://t.co/nRYOq4j4Nt
FACT: Corporate profits are soaring to record heights in the wake of the #TrumpTaxScam‚Äîwhile workers see their wages continue to stagnate. https://t.co/nvhO3AXbi3
FACT: A full-time worker earning the poverty-level federal minimum wage ($7.25/hour) can‚Äôt afford a 2-bedroom apartment in literally any state in the country.
FACT: 40 million Americans‚Äîa staggering 1 in 8 people in this country‚Äîstruggle with hunger.		(Because, no, Mr. President, grocery stores don‚Äôt just give out free food to people who can‚Äôt afford to pay for it.)
FACT: Nearly half of renters in the U.S. can‚Äôt afford their housing costs‚Äîand half a million Americans experience homelessness on a given night. (More than 1 in 5 are children.)
FACT: 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. don‚Äôt have even $400 in the bank‚Äîputting them one missed paycheck or unexpected expense away from poverty.		(Yes, Secretary Ross, that's why furloughed federal workers were turning to food banks.)
FACT: 5.3 million people in the U.S. are living in what the United Nations has called ‚Äúthird world conditions of absolute poverty.‚Äù		https://t.co/BmOmHqov1w
FACT: More than 43% of U.S. households are struggling to afford food, housing, health care, and other basic necessities for human survival.
FACT: Nearly half of the country‚Äîa staggering 140 million Americans‚Äîare living in poverty or right on the brink of it.
So here are just a few Facts of the Trump Economy (TM) to keep in mind before the curtain goes up.
Push even a bit beyond the headline statistics Trump will lift up‚Äîlike the official unemployment rate‚Äîand you quickly see a very different picture...		widespread economic hardship and instability, while those at the top get richer (and richer, and richer still).
The countdown to tonight‚Äôs #SOTU goat rodeo feels like a good time for a refresher on who the ‚ÄúTrump economy‚Äù is working for (folks with multiple yachts).... 		and who‚Äôs getting screwed (Trump‚Äôs very own ‚Äúforgotten man and woman‚Äù).		(THREAD.)

What this means for NJ workers:		A full-time worker paid the state's current minimum wage of $8.85/hour earns.... $350 a week and $18,408 a year. 		At $15/hour, that same worker will earn.... $600 a week and $31,200 a year.		**Over 1 million New Jerseyans will get a raise. https://t.co/rkmza9gjPs
Grassley got it half-right:		The 140 million Americans who are poor or low-income are indeed ‚Äúspending every darn penny they have.‚Äù		Except it‚Äôs on housing, food, health care, and childcare‚Äîwhich a staggering 43% of U.S. households don‚Äôt earn enough to afford. https://t.co/flIHwMe1Cc

Worth noting: In addition to adequate funding to ensure PDs have caseloads that allow them to meaningfully represent their clients... decriminalizing poverty would also go a long way towards reducing caseloads bloated by "offenses" that shouldn't be crimes in the first place.

17. We‚Äôll see where things go from here in the coming days and weeks. 		The Trump administration has said via its Medicare &amp; Medicaid director @SeemaCMS Verma that it‚Äôs been carefully refining this cruel policy for weeks (recognizing how unpopular cutting Medicaid is).
16. By contrast, *expanding* Medicaid in the states still refusing to do so would save over a hundred thousand lives over the coming decade, as my colleague @rwest817 has found.	https://t.co/NONLKflmRh
15. As a result, back during the 2017 health care fight, some took to calling Medicaid cuts like block grants ‚Äúthe real death panels.‚Äù	https://t.co/TiMjPVZIf4
14. Make no mistake: people will die if Medicaid block grants take effect.		For context: the Congressional Budget Office estimated that more than 208,000 ‚Äúunnecessary deaths‚Äù would occur by 2026 if the Senate GOP health care repeal plan had taken effect. https://t.co/dWMAPGmcvO
13. Meanwhile, the newly Democratic-controlled House will try to block this cruel policy as well. 		House Dems have already vowed to investigate the Trump administration‚Äôs health care sabotage efforts &amp; several spoke out immediately against this latest move to slash Medicaid.
12. There are real questions about whether Trump has the legal authority to block-grant Medicaid by executive action. Lawsuits will inevitably follow if the administration moves forward with this plan.
@amprog 11. Now Trump is (again) sidestepping Congress &amp; trying to sabotage Medicaid by fiat after failing to get his agenda done legislatively‚Äîjust like with his cruel Medicaid work reporting requirements, which have already cost more than 17,000 Arkansans their health insurance.
10. Dismantling Medicaid was a core part of Trump &amp; Congressional Republicans‚Äô recent healthcare repeal effort. 		And the American people loudly &amp; clearly said no--especially to Medicaid cuts. 		@amprog polling found **80%** opposition to cutting Medicaid.	https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq
@rwest817 @kfgrobbins 9. Worth noting: even people who aren‚Äôt kicked off Medicaid would be hurt, as we‚Äôd also see states cook up new ways to deny beneficiaries the medicines, procedures, tests &amp; other critical services they need, in order to further reduce costs.
*more on the devastating effects of cutting Medicaid for people w/disabilities (via @rwest817 @kfgrobbins &amp; me): https://t.co/9v0JhPCQfp
8. Loss of Medicaid would also push people with disabilities out of the workforce in droves‚Äîbecause the program‚Äôs home- and community-based services enable millions to work outside the home.
7. As the largest provider of home- and community-based services‚Äîthink: personal attendant care, skilled nursing‚ÄîMedicaid makes it possible for millions of people with disabilities to live independently &amp; remain in their homes.
@urbaninstitute 6. One of the groups who‚Äôd be hurt the most: people with disabilities. This is because for many people with disabilities &amp; severe health conditions, Medicaid provides a lot more than just health insurance‚Äîit enables independent living.
5. Analysis by the @urbaninstitute of the House GOP proposal to block-grant Medicaid during the recent health care fight estimated that **between 14 million and 21 million Americans** would lose Medicaid.	https://t.co/cOrBrg1OcR
4. By shifting costs to states in a huge way, block-granting Medicaid will force them to make dramatic cuts to their Medicaid programs. (Read: kick huge numbers of people off of health insurance.)
3. A block grant would cap federal Medicaid funding, giving states a fixed $ amount and requiring them to pick up the rest. 		Because block-granting is a backdoor strategy for making deep cuts, Medicaid block grants are intentionally designed to make cuts grow deeper every year.
2. Medicaid is a federal-state program, meaning it‚Äôs partially funded by the federal government and partially by states. Currently the feds pick up a set percentage of states‚Äô Medicaid costs.
1. ‚ÄúBlock-grant‚Äù is code for converting a program from one that guarantees coverage to all who qualify, to one that helps fewer and fewer eligible people over time due to capped funding that declines year by year.		Here's what that would mean for Medicaid.
REMINDER: Trump is nowhere close to done trying to dismantle Medicaid by fiat, after failing to get his cruel cuts through Congress. 		A quick refresher on what ‚Äúblock-granting‚Äù Medicaid would mean and why it‚Äôs so dangerous.		THREAD: https://t.co/GSxUFQfp9U

9. While we‚Äôre already starting to see the early effects of the shutdown on SNAP -- for example retailers unable to renew their SNAP licenses -- it‚Äôs important to note that benefit cuts are not yet in effect, and will only go into effect if the shutdown continues.
8. Meanwhile the &gt;250,000 supermarkets, grocery stores &amp; other retailers that participate in SNAP will be hurt by cuts as well, causing ripple effects in hard-hit communities across the U.S.
7. Trump claims charities will make up the difference. But as food banks around the country can testify, this doesn‚Äôt come close to passing the laugh test, as the amount of unmet need is already tremendous.	https://t.co/ndiPNLcLWf
6. Furloughed federal workers struggling to make ends meet during the shutdown will face a double-whammy‚Äîon top of no income, no food assistance.
5. If the shutdown continues into March, food assistance through SNAP will likely be SHUT OFF ALTOGETHER--until the government reopens or Congress takes emergency action to fund the program.
4. Reminder that we‚Äôre talking about a program that provides an average of $1.40 per person, per meal. 		SNAP benefits are so meager, they already run out for most households by the third week of the month.
3. Depending on how the Trump admin decides to handle a shortfall in SNAP, we could see delays in families getting desperately needed food assistance and even across-the-board cuts.
2. If the shutdown continues into February, millions of struggling Americans‚Äô food assistance will be at risk as SNAP starts to run short on appropriated $.
1. SNAP, the nation‚Äôs largest food assistance program, helps nearly 40 million people in some 20 million households put food on the table. 		Right now SNAP has enough federally appropriated funds to make it through January.
Trump is threatening his shutdown could last ‚Äúmonths‚Äù or even ‚Äúyears.‚Äù  		If it continues even a few more weeks, we‚Äôll see hunger in America skyrocket as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka food stamps) starts to run short on funds. 		(THREAD.) 		#HandsOffSNAP

18. In the coming days, @CAPAction will have a handy #HandsOffSNAP comment tool available at https://t.co/B07PWVtrTa.		I‚Äôll reup this thread once the page is live.
17. So what comes next? 		This is a PROPOSED rule, which means we have the opportunity to tell Trump what we think about it (and hopefully stop it from taking effect). 		In fact, the Trump admin is legally required to read every single comment it receives in the next 60 days.
16. Trump‚Äôs cruel rule doesn‚Äôt just come a few days before Christmas. 		It also comes as we mark the 1 year anniversary of his tax cuts for the wealthy‚Äîwhich gave more in tax breaks to the top 1% than *the entire SNAP program costs.* https://t.co/Ac0fNBLkZx
^ h/t @rwest817 for this analysis: https://t.co/HWF818OOsv
15. In fact, just raising the minimum wage to $12/hour (not even the $15 it needs to be at) would save $53 billion in SNAP over the next decade, by ensuring workers earn enough to afford food‚Äîmore than 3 times the $15 billion Trump‚Äôs rule would slash by making workers hungrier.
14. If Trump actually gave any f*cks about the ‚Äúdignity of work,‚Äù instead of taking food out of the mouths of struggling workers, he‚Äôd be raising the poverty-level minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25/hour for nearly a decade.
13. Workers of color and workers with disabilities will be especially hard-hit, as they face unemployment rates 2-3 times higher than other workers.
12. Trump‚Äôs cruel SNAP cuts by fiat come as nearly *half* of Americans report trouble finding a job with decent wages in the past year, according to @amprog polling: https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq
11. Meanwhile, the mere fact of requiring workers to document work hours causes eligible people to lose assistance when they get lost in red tape. 		In Arkansas, over 17,000 people have already lost Medicaid since the state instituted work reporting requirements 6 months ago.
*Roundup of the research: https://t.co/sBlUYZHQQM
10. In fact, taking basics like food away from people unable to meet strict work reporting requirements is *directly* counterproductive to the goal of work. 		Research shows that when workers have access to those basics, they‚Äôre better able to work &amp; have higher earnings.
9. Once again, the Trump admin is dressing up their cruel cuts in the language of work, claiming their mass starvation plan is about the ‚Äúdignity of work.‚Äù 		Well, I‚Äôve got news for them. 		Making struggling workers hungrier won‚Äôt help them find work any faster.
8. Remember, we‚Äôre talking about a program that provides $1.40 per person, per meal on average in food assistance. 		This is what Trump is so eager to take away from struggling workers.
7. Now he‚Äôs using the same playbook to unilaterally take food out of the mouths of hundreds of thousands of struggling workers and families, circumventing Congress after his draconian cuts failed legislatively.
6. But as we know, Trump doesn‚Äôt give up when he can‚Äôt get his cruel agenda through Congress. After GOP leaders in Congress failed to repeal the ACA &amp; gut Medicaid legislatively, Trump has spent the past year doing everything he can to sabotage both through executive action.
5. But that plan was so odious and cruel, it was DOA in the Senate. When a bipartisan Senate Farm Bill deal was struck that didn‚Äôt slash food assistance, Trump‚Äôs hand was forced‚Äîand he‚Äôs set to sign that version into law later today.
4. Let‚Äôs be clear what this is really about. Trump made no secret of his desire to see food assistance dismantled in the Farm Bill. He vocally backed a House GOP plan that would have stripped food aid from 2 million Americans and 265,000 hungry kids of free school meals.
3. The rule would also undermine states‚Äô ability to respond to economic downturns and help distressed communities with few jobs, by preventing states from helping their residents put food on the table when times are tough. 		(So much for states‚Äô rights‚Ä¶)
2. According to the Trump admin‚Äôs own estimates, the rule could jeopardize food assistance for some 755,000 Americans struggling to find stable work.
1. A proposed rule issued today by the Trump admin would significantly weaken the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), by making it even harder for unemployed &amp; underemployed workers to access food assistance, under the guise of harsher ‚Äúwork requirements.‚Äù
BREAKING: After failing to gut food stamps in the Farm Bill, Trump has announced he plans to sidestep Congress &amp; unilaterally slash the program by fiat‚Äîjust days before Christmas.		(THREAD.)

@amprog More to come as further details emerge. 		But in the meantime, @NancyPelosi &amp; @HouseDemocrats are to be applauded for uniformly saying #HandsOff SNAP in the Farm Bill. Not a single House Dem voted for the GOP plan either time it came up for a vote because of its cruel SNAP cuts.
@amprog Reminder for context on how evil the House GOP Farm Bill was: 		SNAP provides a meager $1.40 per person per meal. 		This is what they were trying to take away from struggling families‚Äîjust months after giving more in tax cuts to the top 1% THAN THE ENTIRE SNAP PROGRAM EVEN COSTS.
Case in point: @amprog polling during the Farm Bill debate found that TWO-THIRDS of American voters oppose cuts to nutrition assistance‚Äîand a majority would be less likely to vote for a candidate who backs cuts. https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq
A key takeaway from this Farm Bill fight: it‚Äôs not just Social Security and Medicare that Americans love and overwhelmingly don‚Äôt want to see cut. Programs like SNAP are immensely popular, too‚Äîacross party lines.
At a time when nearly half of U.S. households don't earn enough to afford basics like food and housing, this is a major victory for families across the country struggling to make ends meet‚Äîand a stark reminder that elections matter.
INCREDIBLE NEWS: Senate lawmakers have reportedly struck a Farm Bill deal that protects SNAP, scrapping the House GOP/Trump plan, which would have taken food assistance away from 2 million Americans. https://t.co/g9n0lVWBS5 #HandsOff

@uscensusbureau @rwest817 @kfgrobbins Meanwhile, it's barely been 2 months since the Trump administration issued a sweeping denial of poverty and hunger in America, gaslighting the very real hardship faced by millions: https://t.co/HQCnE4Z2yd
@uscensusbureau In fact, analysis by my colleagues @rwest817 &amp; @kfgrobbins found that if just *three* of Trump‚Äôs draconian cuts to programs that help families make ends meet had been in place in 2015, 2.3 MILLION more Americans would have been poor. https://t.co/9xopnCsY0Q
@uscensusbureau Any good news for struggling workers is thanks to Trump‚Äôs FAILURE to impose much of his policy agenda (AKA a how-to guide for massively increasing poverty &amp; hardship):	 	- dismantling food assistance 	- tripling the poorest families‚Äô rents 	- stripping jobless workers of Medicaid
Later this morning, @uscensusbureau will release its annual report on poverty for 2017. 		We expect a slight downtick in the U.S. poverty rate‚Äîwhich is without question good news. 		But if Trump tries to take credit, he deserves to be laughed out of the room. 		(Here‚Äôs why.)

@NationalADAPT @amprog @CAPDisability @RebeccaCokley @TalkPoverty 11. So today, let‚Äôs commemorate 28 years of the ADA. But when we wake up tomorrow, and the day after that, let‚Äôs recommit daily to the work of building a truly inclusive progressive movement that doesn‚Äôt relegate people with disabilities to one day on the calendar. /end
@NationalADAPT @amprog @CAPDisability 10. As we launch @CAPDisability‚Äîled by my incredible sister @rebeccacokley‚Äî@amprog is proud to become the first and only progressive think tank with a dedicated disability project. 		**Read more about the work in her essay for @TalkPoverty: https://t.co/z5DNFA8sx1
@NationalADAPT @amprog @CAPDisability 9. Importantly, @CAPDisability‚Äôs work will intentionally center multiply marginalized voices, such as people of color with disabilities, immigrants with disabilities &amp; LGBTQ disabled folks‚Äîand ensure they have a seat at the table.
@NationalADAPT 8. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm beyond proud that this week @amprog launched the Disability Justice Initiative (@CAPDisability)‚Äîa project dedicated to applying disability as a lens across every issue we work on, in service of building out a truly inclusive policy agenda.
7. Real talk: Working with the disability community doesn't mean calling up @NationalADAPT and seeing if they‚Äôll get arrested at a particular place &amp; time to help get earned media around a particular cause. It means ensuring people with disabilities are actually at the table.
6. Wonderful as it is to see disability activism finally gain the broad recognition it has so long deserved following the ACA fight, recognition is not enough. PWD must be appreciated not just as part of an outreach strategy, or a compelling protest meme, or sexy talking point.
5. Fellow progressives, take note: Fighting for social justice doesn‚Äôt automatically make our work inclusive‚Äîor even accessible. (Does your video have captions? Does your event have an ASL interpreter? Does your mic come off the podium so a speaker in a wheelchair can use it?)
4. Like ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù health care proposals that leave behind people with disabilities because they fail to include long-term services and supports. And blanket restrictions on access to opioids that ignore people who need them to manage chronic pain.
3. It‚Äôs that kind of siloed thinking that paves the way for well-intentioned but counterproductive &amp; inadvertently ableist policymaking‚Äîlike straw bans that may make sense from an environmental perspective, but which in practice compromise the accessibility of public places.
2. But for too long the notion of ‚Äúdisability policy‚Äù has lived in a silo‚Äîartificially &amp; counterproductively separate from the fight to end poverty &amp; tackle inequality, to curb climate change, to achieve criminal justice reform, and even the fight for universal health care.
1. One in five Americans are people with disabilities. NEWSFLASH: This makes pretty much every issue a disability issue‚Äîfrom health care to the economy to the environment, to criminal justice, and more.
Hi friends! 		Today, as we mark the 28th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (#ADA28), let‚Äôs do one better. 		Let‚Äôs stop relegating people with disabilities to a single day in the calendar. 		(THREAD)

RT @jonrog1: Hey, cool, we‚Äôre doing insane North Korean style propaganda statements. https://t.co/zSsgSCtLOT
@profshaefer @amprog 20. The WH report is right about one thing: As long as Trump and his GOP colleagues are in power, the War on Poverty is definitely over. It‚Äôs been replaced with a war on the working class‚Äîincluding many of the very same people who voted Trump into office in the first place. 	/end
@profshaefer @amprog 19. BONUS: Blaming struggling workers for ‚Äúnot working hard enough‚Äù is a handy smokescreen to distract from the GOP‚Äôs inaction on the real problems they face: poverty-level wages; lack of affordable childcare, paid leave &amp; sick days; a nationwide affordable housing crisis, etc.
@profshaefer @amprog 18. This is why Trump is disguising his cuts as so-called ‚Äúwork requirements‚Äù‚Äîwhich is code for taking food, housing &amp; health care away from unemployed &amp; underemployed workers (and a policy that has nothing to do with helping anyone work). https://t.co/sBlUYZHQQM
@profshaefer @amprog 17. By dressing up his cuts in the makers/takers frame &amp; calling everything he‚Äôs trying to cut ‚Äúwelfare,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs simultaneously hoping his voters don‚Äôt notice they‚Äôre getting screwed by the guy they elected‚Äîwhile throwing red meat to his base in the form of a racial dog-whistle.
@profshaefer 16. In fact, polling earlier this year by @amprog found that **61% of Trump‚Äôs voters** faced significant economic hardship in just the past year (trouble finding a job that pays enough, affording their rent/mortgage, affording needed medical care, etc.) https://t.co/KzZhhfNVj6
@profshaefer 15. A big part of why we‚Äôre seeing Trump take this approach‚Äîit‚Äôs HIS OWN VOTERS who stand to be hurt the most by his proposed cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, nutrition assistance, housing assistance, and other programs that help families get by.
@profshaefer 14. But there‚Äôs another cynical layer to this‚Äîand that‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs continued efforts to 1) smear popular programs like Medicaid and SNAP with the dog-whistle of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù &amp; 2) frame cuts in the language of work (both of which the WH report do in spades).
@profshaefer 13. As with climate change, the reason Trump wants to deny the existence of poverty in the U.S. is to justify a radical, ideological agenda. In this case, his quest to take food, housing, and health care away from tens of millions of Americans‚Äîto pay for his millionaire tax cuts.
@profshaefer 12. Meanwhile, in reality:		‚úîÔ∏èNearly half of U.S. households are struggling to afford basics like food, housing &amp; health care		‚úîÔ∏è4 in 10 Americans don‚Äôt have even $400 in the bank		‚úîÔ∏è5.3 million Americans are living in "Third World conditions of poverty" per the U.N.
**Folks who want to wonk out more on the limitations of consumption-based measures of poverty like the one the WH cherrypicked for this report should check out @profshaefer &amp; colleagues‚Äô helpful explainer: https://t.co/JMBJv0Yfdx (which includes the above graphs)
11. All of this makes it the perfect poverty-denial measure. 		And it‚Äôs this poverty-denial measure‚Äîcontradicted by essentially every other available measure of poverty &amp; hardship‚Äîthat Trump‚Äôs White House is using to declare the War on Poverty ‚Äúlargely over and a success.‚Äù
10. Why is this particular measure so out of step with actual poverty trends? Among many reasons, it doesn‚Äôt distinguish whether people are spending $$ they actually have vs. taking on debt to survive -- or consider if people are spending 60, 70% of their income on rent, etc.
9. In fact, the measure the WH cherrypicked to deny poverty is so epically bad at assessing poverty &amp; hardship, if we used it ‚Äúwe would be forced to conclude that conditions were markedly better at the height of the Great Recession than in the year 2000," as @profshaefer notes.
8. The WH‚Äôs alternative measure is also wildly out of step with pretty much every other indicator of hardship‚Äîfrom falling behind on rent/mortgage to trouble paying utility bills to unmet medical needs due to cost, and more. https://t.co/wEhw8RnIRM
7. But the WH‚Äôs alternative measure is wildly out of step with basically every other indicator of poverty available‚Äîfrom the official poverty measure to the ‚Äúsupplemental poverty measure‚Äù (which counts assistance from antipoverty programs) to food insecurity. https://t.co/5Xr1Uj4412
6. In keeping with its penchant for spewing ‚Äúalternative facts,‚Äù the White House cherry-picks an alternative measure of poverty based on consumption. In short, instead of looking at how much resources people have, this type of measure looks at their spending.
5. To add the appearance of intellectual rigor to its gaslighting, the report includes a series of fancy-looking graphs purporting to show that poverty in America has reached historic lows. 		(Warning: I‚Äôm gonna get wonky for a sec here, but bear with me, it‚Äôs for good reason...)
4. The WH report even brags that‚Äîin 2018, in the richest nation on earth‚Äî‚Äúalmost all Americans have access to clean water.‚Äù 		(Sorry, people of Flint; Trump‚Äôs White House doesn‚Äôt think you even merit a footnote.)
3. It tells the 40+ million Americans who struggle with hunger to quit their complaining because ‚Äúdifficulty in obtaining food‚Äù and ‚Äúreduced diet quality as a consequence of limited resources‚Äù aren‚Äôt *really* hunger. https://t.co/YRjB6wzZEc
2. The WH report brazenly denies that homelessness is a meaningful problem in the U.S.‚Äîerasing the plight of the over *half a million* Americans without shelter on any given night (which includes 58,000 families with children). https://t.co/exy3mUrG89
1. In a report released late last week, Trump‚Äôs WH declared the War on Poverty ‚Äúlargely over and a success.‚Äù The report is literally page after page of gaslighting the very real hardship faced by tens of millions of Americans struggling to afford food, housing, healthcare &amp; more.
Move over, climate change.		Trump‚Äôs White House just issued a sweeping denial of poverty in America.		(THREAD.)

@RAMWdc 9/ DC‚Äôs voters didn‚Äôt fall for @RAMWdc‚Äôs sky-is-falling claims about DC‚Äôs smoking ban.		(Which you may have noticed proved unfounded, as DC‚Äôs restaurant industry is booming today).	 	And they shouldn‚Äôt fall for them now as they go to the polls on June 19 to vote on #Initiative77.
@RAMWdc 8/ Then, as now, @RAMWdc was willing to lie to DC voters in an effort to sink a popular ballot measure.	 	6 in 10 DC voters backed a smoking ban when it got put on the ballot‚Äîand 64% plan to vote #YesOn77 now.	 	That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre afraid of.
@RAMWdc 7/ Then, as now, @RAMWdc claimed ‚Äúoutsiders‚Äù were coming to DC to tell ‚Äúus‚Äù what to do.		"What we see is a small group of zealots who are funded by out-of-town money [and] who want to impose their values on city residents," said general counsel Andrew Kline of the smoking ban. https://t.co/lXC0xQRcK8

@RAMWdc 4/ Then, as with #Initiative77 now, @RAMWdc claimed a smoking ban would destroy DC‚Äôs restaurants and have a ‚Äúdevastating impact on the local hospitality economy.‚Äù https://t.co/vFbkGdS5qh
3/ Over a decade ago, @RAMWdc fought tooth &amp; nail to kill a ban on smoking in DC restaurants, bars &amp; other public places.	 	The sky-is-falling claims they made were proven unfounded.	 	Now they‚Äôre trying to scare DC voters by making many of the same claims about #Initiative77.
@saveourtips @RAMWdc 2/ @RAMWdc‚Äôs @SaveOurTips misinformation campaign is full wild, unsubstantiated claims, as I‚Äôve noted before: https://t.co/MSiXoGnp2e		But their effort to kill #Initiative77 is hardly the first time they‚Äôve lied to DC voters to try to sink a popular ballot measure.
@saveourtips 1/ One of the main lobby groups trying to keep DC‚Äôs tipped workers from getting a raise under #Initiative77 is the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington (@RAMWdc). 		They‚Äôre the ones behind the astroturf @SaveOurTips campaign.
For anyone needing more evidence the @SaveOurTips anti-minimum wage propaganda is built on a house of lies‚Ä¶		The lobby group behind the campaign to kill #Initiative77 is the same group that claimed a smoking ban would be the death of DC restaurants over a decade ago. 		(THREAD.)

@saveourtips 14. OK, so what about restaurants? In the eight states that have eliminated the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, the restaurant industry is thriving. In fact, restaurants in those states have even seen stronger growth than in other states.	https://t.co/lt0Ysk4Stt
@saveourtips 13. Eliminating the sub-minimum wage especially helps women, who make up two-thirds of all tipped workers. 		It doesn‚Äôt just boost wages, it also helps to:		‚úÖ Close gender wage gaps 	https://t.co/5RbXw5IPSh 		‚úÖ Curb sexual harassment https://t.co/NMHKTz9JQv

11. Here are the facts @SaveOurTips doesn‚Äôt want you to know.üëá
10. Many in the media have played right into the campaign‚Äôs hands, reinforcing the myth that the opposition to #Initiative77 is worker-led. Take this recent Buzzfeed article, which quotes only board members of one of @SaveOurTips‚Äôs chief lobbying partners: https://t.co/WnZYbHbWg5
9. This is how desperate the restaurant lobby is to not have to pay their workers a living wage. Meanwhile it would take a minimum wage worker 247 hours‚Äîsix full weeks of work‚Äîto earn what Dawn Sweeney, the other NRA‚Äôs CEO, makes in a single hour.	https://t.co/H82xz2d41F
8. Meanwhile, some DC restaurants aren‚Äôt just misinforming their workers‚Äîthey‚Äôre actively pressuring them to oppose #Initiative77. Here‚Äôs what workers at Matchbox see when they clock in for a shift: https://t.co/6nDnei1eky
7. Campaign finance filings show Save Our Tips has raised $250K since April to kill #Initiative77:		‚úÖ $100K from the National Restaurant Association		‚úÖ $75K from the Restaurant Association of Metro Washington		‚úÖ In all *over 99%* came from industry.		https://t.co/8vt3voYscj
@saveourtips 6. The address @SaveOurTips lists for where to send campaign contributions is literally the Restaurant Association‚Äôs K Street headquarters: https://t.co/jZ04luSL1U
5. The @SaveOurTips campaign website is registered to the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington:	https://t.co/3QN6bdMqlq
4. So who‚Äôs really behind @SaveOurTips? The National Restaurant Association (aka the "other NRA"), the Restaurant Association of Metro Washington, and a range of other industry groups and companies. 		Here‚Äôs how we know‚Ä¶
3. @SaveOurTips has gone to great lengths to pretend it‚Äôs a workers‚Äô organization, framing #Initiative77 in terms of ‚Äúour tips‚Äù and ‚Äúmy take-home pay‚Äù‚Äîand even crafting a ‚Äúresist‚Äù Twitter presence intended to appeal to left-leaning voters. https://t.co/j9fAQeWtZr
@saveourtips 2. In the months since #Initiative77 started to gain steam, signs screaming ‚ÄúSave Our Tips!‚Äù appeared in seemingly every bar and restaurant across DC. Diners drown in @SaveOurTips flyers making wild claims about how the ballot measure will supposedly hurt workers. https://t.co/e5JIWT1AUj
@saveourtips 1. In DC, tipped workers‚Äîaka anyone who makes even $30 in tips per month‚Äîare subject to a sub-minimum wage of $3.33 an hour. #Initiative77, which is on the ballot in DC through June 19th, would ensure they‚Äôre paid the same minimum wage as all other workers.
The restaurant lobby is so hell-bent on paying tipped workers a poverty-level sub-minimum wage, they‚Äôre funding a front group pretending to be organized restaurant workers‚Äîall to block D.C.‚Äôs #Initiative77.		Meet @SaveOurTips.		(THREAD)

34. ‚ÄúGET REAL ABOUT TAXES‚Äù	 	(yes that‚Äôs the U.N.‚Äôs actual phrasing)	 	‚ÄúThere is a real need for the realization to sink in among the majority of the American population that taxes are not only in their interest, but also perfectly reconcilable with a growth agenda.‚Äù https://t.co/wBuE171GZG
33. RECOGNIZE HEALTH CARE AS A HUMAN RIGHT‚Äî‚ÄúHealth care is, in fact, a human right‚Ä¶ Undermining [the ACA] by stealth is not just inhumane and a violation of human rights, but an economically and socially destructive policy aimed at the poor and the middle class.‚Äù
32.

27. DRIVER‚ÄôS LICENSE SUSPENSIONS FOR INABILITY TO PAY FINES &amp; FEES	 	‚Äúare a perfect way to ensure that the poor, living in communities that have refused to invest in serious public transport systems, are unable to earn a living that might have helped to pay the outstanding debt‚Äù

@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab ^ 	If this isn‚Äôt the kind of country you want to live in, there are 2 things you can do: 		1. First, call your member of Congress at 202-224-3121 &amp; tell them #HandsOffSNAP vote NO on the #GOPFarmBill. 		Toolkit: https://t.co/B07PWVtrTa 		2. VOTE IN NOVEMBER üåä 		/end (for now)
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab Yet in the face of all of these facts‚Äîand just months after giving $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans‚Äîthe GOP is trying to ram through a bill to take food assistance away from more than 2 million Americans (the #GOPFarmBill). 		17/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab Raising the minimum wage would also yield savings in SNAP. Raising the min. wage just to $12 would save $53 billion in SNAP over 10 years by giving families a much-needed raise‚Äînearly twice what the #GOPFarmBill would cut... by making people hungrier. https://t.co/HWF818OOsv		16/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab The GOP‚Äôs complete unwillingness to raise the poverty-level minimum wage from $7.25/hour is a big part of the story. Raising the minimum wage to $15 would prevent 1.2 million households from going hungry right off the bat.	https://t.co/gebho2V3mb		15/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab What‚Äôs driving widespread hunger in the richest country in the world? To be sure, it‚Äôs not a lack of resources‚Äîbut policy choices. 		Exhibit A: The tax cuts the GOP gave to the top 1% in their tax law cost more than *THE ENTIRE SNAP PROGRAM.* 	https://t.co/Ac0fNBLkZx		14/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab The long-term benefits transcend the individual and family level and yield significant societal benefits. For example, access to SNAP is associated with lower health care expenditures.	https://t.co/eOueolXMMS 		13/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab The meager assistance SNAP provides amounts to just $1.40 per meal‚Äîbut it goes a long way towards alleviating hunger. PLUS: by helping people afford adequate nutrition, SNAP improves health and educational outcomes in the long-term. 	https://t.co/NTe1rgZZQN 		12/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab Ensuring that the richest country in the world doesn‚Äôt let its people starve was the whole rationale behind the Food Stamp program, today called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 		11/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica @saragoldrickrab While data are limited, studies indicate LGBT individuals face high rates of hunger as well. 2.2 million LGBT adults struggled to afford food within the past year, according to one 2016 study. https://t.co/h1QZEx3OcJ		10/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica Hunger is widespread on college campuses as well. More than a third‚Äî36%‚Äîof college students struggle with hunger and food insecurity. (#FF @saragoldrickrab on this)	https://t.co/J3psmvdEig 		9/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica Meanwhile, hunger isn‚Äôt just a consequence of disability‚Äîit‚Äôs a cause. As we speak, Victorian diseases associated with malnutrition like scarlet fever &amp; scurvy are making a comeback in the U.K. as hunger has spiked following 8 years of austerity cuts. https://t.co/6PL8wsSgjR		8/
@amprog @UnitedWay @FeedingAmerica As many as 1 in 3 households with a disabled member struggle to afford food. Many are confronted with similar impossible choices, skipping meals so they can afford needed medications, or taking half a pill instead of a whole pill so they can eat. https://t.co/j74q7l1uyt		7/
@amprog @UnitedWay 5 million U.S. seniors struggle with hunger, forcing many to make impossible choices. According to @FeedingAmerica, 63% of the senior households they serve are forced to choose between buying food and accessing needed medical care.	https://t.co/v7pfaUrVbt 		6/
@amprog @UnitedWay 13 million, or 1 in 6 U.S. children live in households struggling to afford food. Inadequate nutrition during childhood can have lifelong consequences, hampering healthy physical and cognitive development, kids‚Äô ability to learn, and more.  	https://t.co/YVqvKjg2IA 		5/
@amprog Meanwhile, a study released yesterday by @UnitedWay finds that nearly half‚Äî43%‚Äîof U.S. households don‚Äôt earn enough to afford basics like food and housing. https://t.co/R71K7Luj35		4/
In a recent national survey conducted by @amprog, nearly 40% of Americans report that they or someone in their immediate family faced serious problems with ‚Äúhaving too little money to buy food‚Äù‚Äîjust within the past year. https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq 		3/
For many of us, the word ‚Äúhunger‚Äù evokes third-world images of kids with distended bellies. Or maybe the homeless man sitting on the subway grate. But in America in 2018, hunger and food insecurity are an alarmingly widespread experience. 		2/
As of this morning, Republicans are still pushing ahead for a vote on the #GOPFarmBill, which would strip more than 2 million Americans of food assistance. 		So it feels like a good time to review some facts about hunger in America.		(THREAD)

That means for the next few weeks, we need to light up the phones in the House and tell them #HandsOff SNAP.		This number takes you to a switchboard that will connect you with your member of Congress üëá 	202-224-3121		18/x
@IndivarD So what next?		As soon as next week, the House will mark up this ugly bill. From there, Republican sources suggest its author @ConawayTX11 wants to bring it to the floor for a vote as soon as early May. 17/x
@IndivarD If the House GOP were serious about helping people work, they would address barriers to work like unpredictable, fluctuating schedules and lack of affordable, high-quality childcare. And they would make sure all workers have adequate nutrition so they can thrive on the job. 16/x
@IndivarD Scores of workers and families will end up losing needed food assistance because they'll get caught up in red tape -- including eligible workers who can't navigate all the new paperwork requirements. 15/x
What this bill is really about is erecting as many barriers as possible to people accessing food assistance when they need it. As my friend @IndivarD put it earlier this week, it should probably be called the Increasing Paperwork, Bureaucracy, and Red Tape Act. 14/x
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE WORK. If House Republicans were serious about investing in job training, they wouldn‚Äôt be taking food out of the mouths of struggling workers to pay for it‚Äîafter giving $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. 13/x
There‚Äôs lots more in there, and it gets pretty wonky, so stay tuned for more in the hours and days ahead. But in the meantime, I‚Äôll end on the following note.... 12/x
There‚Äôs also lots of just plain mean-spirited stuff. Like a new policy limiting families to 2 replacement EBT cards per year. Families will literally be unable to access their food assistance for the rest of the year if they lose or damage their card more than twice. 11/x
The bill is chock full of new red tape &amp; paperwork requirements, including taking away a wonky-sounding provision called ‚Äúcategorical eligibility‚Äù which has enabled states to reduce costly bureaucracy, paperwork, and churn. This from the party who claims to &lt;3 "streamlining."10/x
This would set back years of progress in 40+ states that have raised or eliminated asset limits in SNAP to enable families to save for the future and get ahead. 9/x
House Republicans say they're raising SNAP‚Äôs outdated asset limits‚Äîand they are, to $7K for an individual/$12K for a family. But a closer read reveals they‚Äôre simultaneously ending states‚Äô flexibility to set asset limits above the federal floor‚Äîwhich now becomes a ceiling. 8/x
Particularly nasty: A worker can face a full YEAR-LONG LOCKOUT the first time she fails to meet the newly harshened time limits‚Äîand a staggering THREE-YEAR LOCKOUT for the second ‚Äúviolation‚Äù (since House Republicans felt the need to use criminalizing language). 7/x
House Republicans claim no one will lose SNAP if they‚Äôre willing to work or participate in job training. But the so-called job training ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù in the bill is actually a woefully underfunded mandate for states‚Äîpaid for by taking food off the tables of struggling families. 6/x
It would also extend SNAP‚Äôs harsh time limits to parents with children over age 6‚Äîas though caregiving obligations disappear once a kid hits school age. Parents &amp; kids both will go hungry since whole families lose SNAP when a parent gets sanctioned for not meeting work rules. 5/x
For starters, the bill would extend SNAP‚Äôs time limits to older Americans age 50 to 60‚Äîa group that faces some of the greatest barriers to work. This is a recipe for massively increasing hunger and malnutrition among seniors. 4/x
Jobless workers are already subject to a harsh 3-month time limit on SNAP in most parts of the country unless they are working 20 hours a week. The bill would make these time limits even harsher in a whole slew of ways. 3/x
The bill is a thinly disguised ploy to take food away from struggling workers and families in the name of ‚Äúhelping people work.‚Äù NEWS FLASH: Making someone hungrier won‚Äôt help them find work any faster. 2/x
üö® üö®  Just months after giving $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, House Republicans just unveiled a radical Farm Bill that would dismantle the nation‚Äôs main source of nutrition assistance for struggling workers and families. 		Here‚Äôs how.		(THREAD)

@realDonaldTrump First Trump came for our healthcare.		Now he's coming for food, housing, and everything else that helps families afford the basics, brick by brick.		All to pay for his $1.5 trillion in tax giveaways to the wealthiest people in this nation. 		22/x
@realDonaldTrump Trump is clearly hoping to poison public opinion on SNAP ahead of the upcoming debate around the Farm Bill, which Congressional Republicans are eyeing as their best opportunity for draconian public assistance cuts this year. 21/x
@realDonaldTrump Worth nothing: This EO itself doesn‚Äôt carry any real weight‚Äîit directs agencies to review programs that help families make ends meet. 		Its real purpose is to smear the programs Trump and his colleagues in Congress want to slash to pay for their millionaire tax cuts. 	20/x
So I ask:		Where, @realdonaldTrump, is raising the poverty-level minimum wage in your shiny new ‚ÄúPrinciples of Economic Mobility‚Äù? 		(crickets) 		19/x
In fact, raising the minimum wage just to $12 would save a whopping $53 billion just in SNAP over a decade‚Äîas more low-wage workers would suddenly earn enough to (gasp!) feed their families without nutrition assistance. 18/x
If Trump were really trying to promote "self-sufficiency" -- a concept he clearly doesn't think applies to the millionaires he just gave massive tax cuts -- he'd be all over raising the minimum wage. 17/x
As a result, a minimum wage worker in 2018 is taking an effective pay cut of $2,370 this year‚Äîthat's a whopping ***47 times*** what she can expect to receive under Trump‚Äôs tax law (cue Paul Ryan's deleted tweets about "crumbs"...) 16/x
CASE IN POINT: The federal minimum wage has stayed stuck at $7.25/hour for nearly a decade, as the GOP has stymied efforts to give workers a much-needed raise. 15/x
Trump says his EO is about eliminating "poverty traps." 		If he knew anything about poverty--aside from what he's learned from Fox News--he'd know the real poverty trap is the poverty-level minimum wage. 14/x
FACT: 70% of Americans will turn to at least one means-tested program‚Äîlike Medicaid or SNAP‚Äîat some point. 		That‚Äôs why polling finds Americans overwhelmingly oppose cuts to these and other programs that are there for us when we fall on hard times üëá https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq 13/x
By using dog-whistle terms like ‚Äúwelfare,‚Äù Trump‚Äôs trying to paint people who turn to Medicaid, SNAP, and other public programs as Reagan's mythical ‚Äúwelfare queen‚Äù -- so we don‚Äôt notice that he‚Äôs coming after the entire working and middle class. 12/x
Reinforcing these myths is core to Trump‚Äôs divide &amp; conquer playbook. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so keen to smear Medicaid, SNAP, &amp; other popular programs as ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù‚Äîa term with a deeply racially charged history, evoking decades of stereotypes about who is poor in this country. 11/x
1) That ‚Äúthe poor‚Äù are some stagnant group of people who ‚Äújust don‚Äôt want to work‚Äù 		2) That anyone who wants a well-paying job can snap her fingers to make one appear		3) That having a job is all it takes to not be poor 		10/x
Rather, pushing for ‚Äúwork requirements‚Äù is at the core of the GOP strategy to reinforce the following myths about poverty in America... 9/x
At the heart of the EO Trump signed tonight is the GOP‚Äôs favorite hobby-horse: so-called ‚Äúwork requirements.‚Äù 		Make no mistake: taking healthcare, food, and housing away from struggling workers has nothing to do with helping anyone work. https://t.co/sBlUYZHQQM  8/x
And the small fraction of families lucky enough to receive TANF are still pretty much screwed because in no state are TANF benefits more than half the federal poverty line. For example, a Tennessee family of 3 receives a max of $185 per month‚Äîor a little over $6 a day. 7/x
Today fewer than 1 in 4 poor families with kids get help from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families‚Äîthe artist formerly known as "welfare"‚Äîbecause it was converted to a flat-funded block grant that‚Äôs lost fully one-third of its value since 1996. 6/x
Housing assistance reaches just 1 in 5 eligible low-income families. Those left without help can spend 60, 70, even 80% of their income on rent and utilities each month, while they remain on decades-long waiting lists for aid. 5/x
SNAP‚Äîaka food stamps‚Äîprovides just $1.40 per person per meal. Imagine that as your food budget. Most folks run out of SNAP by the third week of the month because it‚Äôs so far from enough to feed a family on. 4/x
Trump says his EO is about ‚Äúwelfare reform.‚Äù But let‚Äôs get one thing clear. WE DON‚ÄôT HAVE WELFARE IN AMERICA ANYMORE. Congress eliminated it in 1996. What‚Äôs left of America‚Äôs tattered safety net is meager at best and so, so very far from enough to live on. Let‚Äôs take a look. 3/x
Millions of Americans are working 2+ jobs to get by.		Half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. 		But Trump‚Äôs plan for ‚Äúeconomic mobility‚Äù is to take healthcare, food &amp; housing away from struggling folks just months after giving huge tax cuts to millionaires. 		2/x
Tonight, Donald Trump signed an executive order that sums up how little he understands about poverty in America. 		Here‚Äôs why.		(THREAD)

Keep all of this in mind especially next week when House Republicans are expected to unveil their Farm Bill, which they want to use as a vehicle for draconian cuts to SNAP, dressed up as ‚Äújob training.‚Äù 		/end (for now, follow along for more updates in the coming days)
@SpeakerRyan In fact, a minimum wage worker is taking an epic pay cut of $2,370 this year because Paul Ryan &amp; his GOP colleagues have refused to raise the federal minimum wage for nearly a decade. 		That's 47 times what the same worker will get under the GOP tax law.		https://t.co/vU7l8vLsKG
@SpeakerRyan ‚ÄúThe laws we‚Äôre trying to pass are designed to go after this poverty trap problem... So we are looking at what‚Äôs working in communities," Ryan says.		Guess what's trapping workers in poverty? POVERTY WAGES.		Guess what's working in communities? RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.
@SpeakerRyan The very fact that he's trying to rebrand cuts as "helping people work" shows he realizes how unpopular his cuts are. 		And boy are they unpopular.		Americans--across party lines--widely oppose cuts to Medicaid, SNAP &amp; other programs he wants to slash: https://t.co/lrNkYDoP4d
@SpeakerRyan ^ This -- taking food, housing, and healthcare away from struggling workers -- is what Ryan's trying to rebrand as "workforce development."

There‚Äôs perhaps no more disgusting and twisted irony than taking $$ intended to help poor families with children avoid hunger and homelessness ‚Äì and using it instead to take health insurance away from struggling workers and families. 		9/x
Worth noting: TN is far from alone on this front--many states use TANF as a slush fund to close budget gaps instead of directing the $$ to struggling families.		But TN has squirreled away a staggering *$400 million* in unspent TANF $$ while the state's poor kids go hungry. 		8/x
But a big part of the story is Tennessee's history of diverting &amp; squirreling away its TANF $$ instead of using it to help the state‚Äôs poorest families with children. 		7/x
(More on that here: https://t.co/coHHMIjzRh)		6/x
Why is TN failing so horrifically to help its poorest children? 		In part, this is the legacy of 1996 ‚Äúwelfare reform,‚Äù which converted the U.S.'s main source of aid to poor families into a flat-funded block grant that has lost about a third of its value in the years since. 		5/x
Meanwhile, a Tennessee family of three lucky enough to receive help from TANF receives a maximum of $185 per month.		That's $6 a day.		Imagine trying to live on that just by yourself‚Äîlet alone raise two kids.		4/x
Nearly one-quarter of Tennessee‚Äôs children live in poverty. 		But just a tiny fraction get help from the state‚Äôs TANF program. 		Today fewer than 1 in 4 poor Tennessee families with kids get help from TANF‚Äîdown from 67% in 1996.  		3/x
The NPR story I linked to above makes it sound like Tennessee has oodles of leftover $$ in its TANF program--which provides meager cash assistance to very poor families with kids--because of a ‚Äúbooming economy and historically low unemployment.‚Äù 		Here‚Äôs the real story. 		2/x
Tennessee Republicans are so hell-bent on taking Medicaid away from unemployed and underemployed workers, they‚Äôre preparing to spend $10,000 per person they strip health insurance from‚Äìand to divert $$ from aid to poor families to pay for it. https://t.co/jICOnYzKwV #HandsOff 1/x

.@traceylross makes a good points about this on @offkiltershow this week -- calling the question about whether comparing black women to white women is the right way to be thinking about this. https://t.co/Q7zc9tdJv0
@SpeakerRyan @RepMarkWalker @ConawayTX11 Keep all of this in mind over the next few months as House Republicans cravenly try to market their unpopular SNAP cuts as supposedly about "helping people work."
@SpeakerRyan @RepMarkWalker @ConawayTX11 Let's be very clear. Taking food away from someone who's hungry has nothing to do with creating opportunity. 		In fact, it's actually counterproductive to the goal of work, since guess what boosts work capacity and earnings?		Adequate nutrition. https://t.co/sBlUYZHQQM
@SpeakerRyan @RepMarkWalker .@SpeakerRyan's GOP colleagues appear to be listening. 		@ConawayTX11, who's leading the House GOP's effort to cut SNAP, is claiming his plan to take food away from struggling families is 	"about creating opportunities for folks to help themselves get off these programs."
@SpeakerRyan That's what's behind @SpeakerRyan &amp; team's quest to rebrand the GOP's Robin Hood in reverse agenda as about compassion.		As House Republican Study Chair @RepMarkWalker put it, ‚ÄúWhen we talk about ‚ÄòMedicaid reform,‚Äô that‚Äôs not a great buzz phrase.‚Äù https://t.co/LXbzunxKiP
@SpeakerRyan Meanwhile, cuts to food assistance are the exact opposite of what the American people want. Recent polling finds two-thirds of Americans oppose cuts to SNAP -- and that a majority of voters are less likely to vote for a candidate who backs cuts to SNAP. https://t.co/cUVjVGQPOq
@SpeakerRyan Don't be fooled by their puppies and rainbows rhetoric. 		If the GOP were serious about "promoting work," they'd be all over raising the poverty-level minimum wage. 		In fact, raising the minimum wage just to $12 would save $53B in SNAP over a decade. https://t.co/HWF8196pk3
They're taking a page out of @SpeakerRyan's book, framing deep cuts to nutrition assistance as so-called "workforce development." 		REMINDER: Taking food (or healthcare or housing for that matter) away from struggling workers isn't going to help them find a job any faster.
After spending 2017 trying to take health care away from tens of millions of Americans, House Republicans made clear yesterday that next on the docket is taking food away from struggling families. https://t.co/MQ1KvBGESJ

@rwest817 **Good summary of why work requirements have nothing to do with helping anyone work: https://t.co/sBlUYZHQQM 10/x
@rwest817 Keep this mind the next time Trump/ Ryan/other GOP leaders claim so-called "work requirements" are about "helping" anyone. 		Taking health insurance, or food, or housing away from struggling workers does nothing to raise wages -- and only makes it harder to find &amp; keep a job. 9/x
In fact, as previous work by @rwest817 has shown, if Congress raised the minimum wage to just $12/hr -- they'd save $53 billion (over 10 yrs) just in SNAP, as fewer workers would need to turn to nutrition assistance to feed themselves &amp; their families. https://t.co/HWF818OOsv 8/x
It's no accident that the centerpiece of GOP proposals to slash Medicaid, SNAP, housing &amp; other vital programs is so-called "work requirements." 		It's all a smokescreen to distract us from the real problem facing struggling workers -- wages that aren't enough to live on. 7/x
@rwest817 @amprog Yet instead of raising the minimum wage, Trump &amp; Speaker Ryan are hell-bent on kicking workers while they're down, by slashing the very programs that help workers get by when wages aren't enough. 6/x
@rwest817 @amprog As the minimum wage has shrunk to a poverty wage, more and more low-wage workers now need to turn to Medicaid, SNAP, and other vital programs to make ends meet because wages aren't enough to live on. 5/x
@rwest817 @amprog Trump &amp; his colleagues in Congress keep telling us how much "compassion" they have for struggling Americans. How much they want to help the "forgotten man and woman." 		Yet for nearly 9 years, the GOP has refused to give minimum-wage workers a raise. 4/x
@rwest817 @amprog As a result, a full-time minimum-wage worker will lose a staggering $2,370 in purchasing power this year.		That's more than ***47 times*** the average tax cut she gets under the #TrumpTaxScam. 3/x
@rwest817 @amprog In 2018, a worker earning $7.25/hr must work an extra 41 days‚Äîmore than 2 additional months!‚Äîjust to earn the same amount as she did in a single year when the federal minimum wage was last increased. 2/x
