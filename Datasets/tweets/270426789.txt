@SallyQYates I’m still shocked every day.  But it’s frustrating because it seems like no one on the other side cares.  Are they ever going to be held accountable for all of the lies by anyone from their own party?
@JonasAndreis @Rob_Furney @GOP These guys aren’t the brightest bulbs, but not writing a porn star’s name on a check is kind of a no brainer.
@GOPChairwoman I could have not watched any of the testimony and guessed exactly how it went because of your full blown, non stop, attempt at damage control.  I’m actually enjoying this.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And yet he was Trump’s lawyer for 10 years.   I don’t think your Tweet makes the President look very good either.
@RepMarkMeadows But as bad as Cohen is, you seem to conveniently disregard that he was Trump’s attorney for years.  Why would Trump associate with someone like that? (I think you know the answer)	I believe any damage you all do to Cohen’s reputation makes Trump look much worse.
@RepMarkGreen Fine, upstanding, citizens don’t usually agree to break the law for clients.  I think your logic is flawed.  If a person that Trump employed for years is a person that would lie to congress, doesn’t that concern you at all about the President?  You can’t have it both ways.

@HerbMartin @seanhannity You didn’t mention healthcare.  Is health insurance anywhere in your equation of importance?   I think you’re the one that needs to think more.
@HerbMartin @seanhannity So keeping immigrants out of the country is as equally important to you as keeping United States citizens from dying because they can’t afford health care?  Really?
@DidiHopes @MarkSimoneNY Yes... because Trump has set the perfect example and never tweets about anything inane when he should be doing something more important.

@disneydoc911 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Did she know it was a lie when she supported it?  	Trump said there were good people on both sides.  He never apologized for that remark.  He didn’t back pedal (not peddle) either.  He knew the real version of events.  	It’s the worst form of hypocrisy that you can’t see that.
@disneydoc911 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump How does this make a positive argument for Trump?   It took him days to denounce Charlottesville, and then he claimed there were good people on both sides.  I’m tired of the hypocrisy.
@marclamonthill @KcFloWBro1 @Buccigross Who is going to decide which players get paid? If Duke players get paid, should UNC Wilmington players get paid? How much should women be paid for playing the same sport?  Also, if basketball players get paid, should tennis players be paid too?
@piss_uncle @PaulT22PT @Prez_R_Miguel I don’t think anyone should be opposed to added security.  I guess there’s just disagreement on the best way to accomplish that.
@smilinganyway @politicalGeoff2 @SamPappy1 @ChicagoAreaMan @GOPChairwoman So people should die because they don’t have insurance because there might be people that freeload.  Is that really your position?
@PaulT22PT @Prez_R_Miguel Simple answer, I do lock my doors.  I just don’t build a wall in front of my door that’s already locked.
@SamPappy1 @politicalGeoff2 @smilinganyway @ChicagoAreaMan @GOPChairwoman Why are you against everyone having healthcare?

@SamPappy1 @smilinganyway @ChicagoAreaMan @GOPChairwoman I don’t know a percentage, 25% seems very high if everyone paid, but yes.  No one should die because they can’t afford health insurance.  Social programs can be beneficial - like public education.
@SamPappy1 @ChicagoAreaMan @GOPChairwoman What about public schools?   Why don’t we quit paying taxes to educate our children?
@smilinganyway @ChicagoAreaMan @SamPappy1 @GOPChairwoman Please tell me where people can get medical coverage if they “truly can’t afford it”.   Do you really believe this?
@landers_ruby @RepMarkMeadows If I was innocent, my go to phrase would be “just wait on the report”.   Why don’t any of Trump’s associates seem to want to do that?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You have no idea how satisfying it is to know that Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of the President gets under your skin.
@RepMarkMeadows If there was no impropriety, why not just wait for Mueller to complete his investigation?  You say anyone that’s truly been investigating already knows what occurred.  If that’s true, won’t Mueller’s report reach your same conclusion?   You don’t make sense.
@MrAndyNgo For perspective, how many hate crimes attributed to Trump supporters are there that are substantiated?
@ed_waddell1 @DLoesch I’m not saying a high wage.  I’m saying a livable wage.  What would you consider a liveable wage now?   	If you work full time, an employer should pay you enough for you to pay basic bills: a place to live, dependable transportation(not a BMW), food, utilities, &amp; clothing. Agree?
@ed_waddell1 @DLoesch Again... I’m talking about people that are working full time.  Shouldn’t they be paid a living wage like you were?
@ed_waddell1 @DLoesch You’re missing the point.  I’m not talking about wanting anything free.  I’m talking about people working full time, just like you did.  Shouldn’t they have the same opportunity you did?   A decent paying job that could pay their bills?
@ed_waddell1 @DLoesch How long ago was this that you could buy a new home on $5/hr? 	 I think that’s the point here. 	There are many people working full time that can’t even afford the basics.  	Shouldn’t you be able to afford a home and basic transportation if you’re working full time?
@Fran_Neena20409 @KFILE @Nach9636 @CNNSotu @DanaBashCNN @CNN @cnni @HLNTV Read @KFILE bio.  He works for CNN.  What’s your point?
@JohnCornyn If lying is the criteria, how can you not view Trump with that same skepticism?
@WillinsDavid @antisnowflake83 @MZHemingway I wasn’t asking you, but thanks for your input.   Do you consume their product?  Do you watch?
@antisnowflake83 @WillinsDavid @MZHemingway You seriously believe that outlets like NBC, ABC, and CBS are lying to you?	And you probably think FOX doesn’t give right wing propaganda either, correct?
@Bloodavenger77 @BreakingChesky @DavidBHayter Nice non answer.
@BulldogChloe @JNEREBEL @RepMarkMeadows “Essential to the national defense” seems pretty thin to me.  	You’re right though, we’ll know tomorrow.
@Bloodavenger77 @BreakingChesky @DavidBHayter So you don’t want information?   He’s doing his job.  Why is that wrong?
And you think you’ve given something by quoting right wing propogandists Charlie Kirk and the Washington Examiner as “facts”.   I ask you who then is delusional?	Feel free not to respond if you’re not interested in a conversation.
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein Give me facts as to exactly how much a wall would cost.  Not 5.7 billion.  You know that’s incorrect.   	It has to be monitored, or a way will be found to breach it.   Over a thousand miles of border wall - built, then monitored 24 - 365.  And you say health care is outrageous $
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein Children dying because of gun violence - no national emergency.  	Everyday Americans dying because they can’t afford to go to the doctor - no national emergency.  	Mexicans crossing the border - national emergency!!!  	Seriously??	So yes, I do think the left has my best interests
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein By the way... I kinda do want him to declare a national emergency.  It’ll then be very interesting the next time a President that’s a Democrat wants to bypass Congress.  Also, something tells me if Obama had done this, you would be beside yourself.
Charlie Kirk and the Washington Times are your go to sources for “facts”? Please.
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein Pie in the sky stuff.  I believe you’re wrong on your estimate to build the wall.  The 5.7b was to start the wall.  I’ve seen much higher estimates to build the whole thing.  Get that figure right to start.  You’re just speculating on everything else.
@BulldogChloe @JNEREBEL @RepMarkMeadows Curious as to which one is Trump invoking?
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein How much money will a wall cost the taxpayers?   If it’s built, it’ll still have to be monitored which will lead to arrests that you say cost money.  How is declaring a national emergency gonna save the country money?
@Abraham42350652 @rj7388 @SenFeinstein These are stats for arrests.  That means they were caught?  What’s your problem with that?  Where’s the national emergency there?
@Abraham42350652 @SenFeinstein Who’s your source for this information?
@antisnowflake83 @WillinsDavid @MZHemingway Again... quit watching.
@RepMarkMeadows Answer one question.  Why is it a national emergency now?  Border crossings are at the lowest they’ve been in years, so why is it all of a sudden a national emergency?	Also, is being a liar a requirement for being a Republican?  I hope not, but you’re making me wonder.
@lshtls @MZHemingway Do you trust what they are telling you?  I do for the most part. 	However, if you don’t trust what they’re telling you, why would you want to consume their product?	You may as well read the comics.
@lshtls @MZHemingway It depends.  If you don’t trust what they’re saying, you may as well.  Correct?
@WillinsDavid @MZHemingway And, if most people had quit watching, advertisers wouldn’t waste their money.
@antisnowflake83 @WillinsDavid @MZHemingway You obviously don’t know how ratings work.
@MZHemingway Anyone complaining about the media needs only do ONE thing.  Quit consuming said media.  It’s really that simple.  	If you don’t quit consuming, you’re continuing to make what they do possible. 	Btw... I think the media plays a valuable role, but if you disagree, just stop.
@Jrofosho @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Btw.   Ted wasn’t counting, the El Paso fire dept was.  	Even so, I think it should worry the President that a person with a failed Senate bid drew close to as many people as he(trump) did.
@Jrofosho @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump So you tell us what the crowd sizes were.  How many for each?  How many in the overflow?  	And if Beto isn’t somewhat popular, how did he draw 10,000 in El Paso??
@Jim_Jordan I’m beginning to hate so called Republicans like you that use terms like “socialist” to play to your base.  You have no integrity, and anyone that will vote you back in office needs to have their head examined.  	Republicans... you’re better than this loser. Ditch him.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I don’t hear any Democrat saying that barriers don’t work.   Stop with the lying already.
@laamigable21 @GOP Is the fetus viable?
@laamigable21 @GOP Because he gave his opinion, it’s now Democratic policy?   Is everything Trump opines on Republican policy?
@GOP What are your sources for the open borders and third trimester abortions? 	I’ll also never understand why everyone having access to affordable medical care is a bad thing.

@TheRealGRoberts @thehill @TheHillOpinion Okay dude... your MAGA misinformed mind will never be changed, or you’re just trolling me. 	More people in this country voted for Hillary.  That is a fact.  You really can’t be for real.  I’m out.
@TheRealGRoberts @thehill @TheHillOpinion This media you reference seems pretty powerful, but the media didn’t choose Hillary, the people did... by several million votes.  If you think Roger Stone is a scapegoat, well.. there’s no use debating any further.
@TheRealGRoberts @thehill @TheHillOpinion Trump’s associates that pleaded guilty must’ve not known they could just refuse to disclose stuff.

@TheRealGRoberts @thehill @TheHillOpinion Riddle me this...   if there was nothing hinky going on, why all of the lying?
@auntieamy90 @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC By the way, I didn’t mean to gloss over the fact that your mother did what she did.  That’s outstanding.
@auntieamy90 @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC So no matter how little you get paid you should be able to save for a month with no pay?   Really?  There’s no tipping point?
@auntieamy90 @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Do you have children?
@Ouyevolitub @auntieamy90 @NolteNC I asked you where the line for income is for a person to “live within their means”. Obviously someone can’t live within their means on $2000 a year.  It was an absurd example I made to show that there is a line somewhere.  Where do you think the line is?  Minimum wage?
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC I’m all for border protection and stopping all human trafficking and illegal immigration.  We just disagree on how to accomplish that.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC You should come up with better arguments and quit being snarky.  I want border security.  I just think it’s a waste to spend huge money on a wall that won’t work.  I’ll be happy to talk to border security agents if they think just building a wall will keep immigrants out.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC That’s not my point.  The point is, the only way to keep people out is to monitor the entire border.  A wall won’t keep people out.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC A fence is different than a wall.
@Ouyevolitub @illdiscourse @NolteNC Obviously, there should be NO use of force of any kind, and that’s not really the deterrent at govt installations.  People are kept out because the govt monitors all ways to gain entrance.  If you want to stop immigration from the southern border, just make sure it’s monitored.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Clarifying.  Yes, it needs monitoring.  If you want to stop illegal immigration, just monitor it.  There’s no need to waste money on a wall.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Yes.  That’s my point
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Have you ever been to the military installation in that some people call Area 51?   Unless you work there, you haven’t.  There are no walls, but the govt keeps EVERYONE out by constantly monitoring its borders.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC If walls worked just because they are built, we could put our lawbreakers inside four walls and boom, they’re not going anywhere.  We could save a whole lot of money on guards and all of the other safeguards.  	Walls must be monitored to work.
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Walls don’t work unless they’re monitored.  How much would it cost to monitor a 2000 plus mile wall?   If you’re going to monitor it, why not just monitor the border that’s already there?  Why waste extra money on a wall?
@Ouyevolitub @auntieamy90 @NolteNC Where is the income line where you will admit it’s impossible to live within your means? Seriously.  Give me a figure. 	There has to be one.  For example, if you make $2000 per year, could you just “live within your means”?
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC It’s also cute when righties can’t answer a simple question and just attack.  Are you okay with the govt spending your money needlessly?
@illdiscourse @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC If you’re okay with the govt spending your tax dollars needlessly, then that’s your prerogative.  I’m not okay with that.
@Ouyevolitub @auntieamy90 @NolteNC Typical let them eat cake response.  This just isn’t realistic for a whole lot of Americans, and is frankly elitist and out of touch. It’s hard enough just to make it week by week on a 30k. Where’s the income line where you believe a person makes enough to save a 2 month reserve?
@auntieamy90 @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC That’s a huge problem in itself, and it should be addressed as well.  I’ve been there too.  Employees should be paid well enough to not have to have more than one job.   Can I ask why you don’t teach full time?
@auntieamy90 @Ouyevolitub @NolteNC But you can plan on it.  Correct?	What if you were about to start your semester and classes for that semester that you teach were cancelled?   Could you make it?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC He asked for a wall.   He made it all about a wall.  Not just border security.  There had to be a wall.  	That’s what’s frustrating.  No one I’ve heard is against border security.  They just believe there are better and cheaper ways to do it.  Why would anyone be against that?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC They’re not.  They’re just against a wall.  Why are you asking a misinformed question?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Lol.  Give me something besides a link to an article about the 2013 shutdown.
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC McConnell said he wouldn’t bring a bill to vote that the President wouldn’t sign.  	It’s all on the President.  Well... and McConnell.
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Because the President started his crap.  But you knew that
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC I don’t even know what you’re saying.   They’re not being paid right now.  Money paid later doesn’t help right now.  What about that is difficult?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC They had one passed.  He didnt sign it.
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Why is it the Dems fault?   Trump said this shut down is on him.  His own words... on video.  Are you saying he lied about that?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Which ones aren’t working?
@Ouyevolitub @NolteNC Are you serious?  You’re not noticing it because they’re STILL WORKING.  They’re just NOT GETTING PAID.   	When the TSA agents quit, for example, it’ll be noticed.  	If you can do without any income for two months, you’re very fortunate.  Most Americans can’t.
@JohnCornyn @WSJ Who are you tweeting this to?   I hope it’s the President.  He’s the cause of all of this.
@BretStephensNYT Here’s a novel idea...	Why can’t conservatives just do the right thing regardless of what liberals do?	Trump doesn’t just “misrepresent facts”.   He lies.  And he should be held to account.  	If AOC lies, she should be held to account as well.  	Why is this so difficult?
@HikerCari @timjacobwise @JacobAWohl Did you even read the requirements you posted?
@k_tremont @cathykamlet @ericbolling @AOC There’s a lot of Americans with transcripts like that from a semester in college, that have much more of a clue than you, if you’re equating a few bad grades to how much intelligence a person has.
@sully7777 Agree!  Lines like that are earned and not given.
@PJayHall2 @DonaldNotTrump_ @ThatWitchUKnow @BuckSexton You just made my point.  Mueller’s statement was most certainly not anti-Trump.   All of the media outlets reported it.
@PJayHall2 @DonaldNotTrump_ @ThatWitchUKnow @BuckSexton Mueller’s statement was all over the MSM last night.  If the MSM was wanting to promote only propaganda,  wouldn’t they try to suppress that statement?	BTW... I’m glad that you believe Mueller.  All anyone should want is the truth.
@NarrativeFilter @DrewRankinCMEEC @dguaraglia @NolteNC @DonaldJTrumpJr It’s amazing the lengths people will go to defend a chronic, serial, liar.
@yankeeztex25 @NarrativeFilter Noted that you’re okay with being lied to.
@DrewRankinCMEEC @NolteNC @DonaldJTrumpJr I understood your point.
@DrewRankinCMEEC @dguaraglia @NolteNC @DonaldJTrumpJr Have you criticized the President for this same behavior?  And it’s not facts, it’s your opinion.  You extrapolate to include all media for what one outlet did.
@DrewRankinCMEEC @NolteNC @DonaldJTrumpJr I think you missed my point.  This starts at the top.  I disagree with you about most of the media’s behavior, but If you think the President’s behavior hasn’t affected the behavior of others, you’re kidding yourself.
@DrewRankinCMEEC @NolteNC @DonaldJTrumpJr The same could be said of the President, no?
@CaliforniaPanda You’re actually bragging about a POTUS working this weekend??  Stupid me for assuming being the President of the United States is a 24/365 gig.
@EEAGLEEYE07 @jmc663 @bethanyshondark Do you believe it?
@EEAGLEEYE07 @jmc663 @bethanyshondark Nice deflection.
@EEAGLEEYE07 @jmc663 @bethanyshondark Just curious if you read the article
@RepRobWoodall @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @HouseGOP @Varneyco Do you seriously believe this nonsense that you’re spouting?  If Trump were on the side of the American people, he wouldn’t be presiding over the longest shutdown in history.  Also, please stop with the talking points that are just flat out lies.
@CodyAlexander07 @GrandpaKardash1 @WalshFreedom Yes!  Walls work with prisons too.  All we have to do is build four walls, put the criminals inside the four walls, and then leave.  They’ll never escape because walls work!
@ukn96 @MiddleRob @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump If any of these walls aren’t monitored, they won’t work.  We don’t put prisoners inside four walls and leave them to their own devices.  If walls worked as you say, shouldn’t we be able to do that?   Walls work, right?
RT @stephanpastis: https://t.co/lvKcUZNE6s
@DanCrenshawTX It’s called voting.   I think Democrats taking the house might be something for Republicans to think about and not the other way around.  	Also, if Trump hadn’t insisted on wall funding, the government would still be open.   Care to comment on that?
@ericbolling @Acosta Correct me if I’m wrong, but isnt the point here that the slats don’t run the entire length of the town, and in some places it’s even chain link, and yet there’s no problem.  Isn’t this a perfect argument AGAINST a concrete wall, or even 30ft steel slats for the entire border?
@GOPLeader     I don’t trust a word that you, Scalia, the Vice President, or the President say.  What the President has been quoted as saying is the exact opposite of what you all are saying now.   Also, quit standing in the background laughing.  This is NOT humorous in any way.
@BravoJunk @MaterialWeaknes @FactualLiberal @yologuy @AdamSchiff @mdhelfenbein I think a more appropriate term than Nazis would be White Supremacists.  I can tell you unequivocally that those groups are still around and as dangerous as ever.
@hedgefundmgr42 @seanhannity Probably.  Nice deflection.  The point is, however, that Trump has used the same language, so Hannity objecting to it now is nothing but disingenuous.   Yes?	Don’t even act like you believe that Trump hasn’t called numerous people that word.
@seanhannity I didn’t read the whole story because I’m not going to give Fox News a click, but in my opinion, your view is about as hypocritical as it gets.
@OGandE   Power is out in Alma, AR. Wondering what happened and an estimated time that it might be restored.
@farosales1 @mattch_3 @RealSaavedra Exactly what I just said.  I don’t care what their parents have done, if a child dies while in CBP custody, our country needs to reevaluate what we’re doing.
@mattch_3 @farosales1 @RealSaavedra But you’re okay with children dying as the consequence?  Surely not. 	These children died while in CBP custody.  There should be nothing wrong with figuring out why that happened and never letting it happen again. 	Kids dying is a consequence that should NEVER be acceptable.
@farosales1 @mattch_3 @RealSaavedra So you’re okay with a child dying because it’s a consequence of their parent’s activity... okay.  	You and I definitely have different values.  To me, whatever their parents have done shouldn’t be a life sentence for their children.
@DICEY63 @RealSaavedra And how would we do this, exactly?
@StillAKMessiah @mattch_3 @RealSaavedra Seriously, can’t we do better?  Do we not have a moral obligation to try to save a child’s life no matter who’s at fault?    	If you’re tired of the media, quit consuming it.  I’m serious.	They depend on advertising for income, so if no one is consuming their product...
@mattch_3 @RealSaavedra Do you have children?  		Can you imagine being in such a hopeless place that your would risk that child’s life for a better one?	I didn’t say it was entirely the CBP responsibility.   However, when a child’s life is involved, we should do better.  Is that too much to ask?
@mattch_3 @RealSaavedra It’s not about blame.  It’s NEVER okay when an innocent child dies, especially if they are already in the custody of CBP.  Surely to God we can agree on that.  To explain it away blaming the parents isn’t acceptable, at least to me.  I say again, WE ARE BETTER THAN THIS.
@RealSaavedra Have all of the immigrants that weren’t children, that have died during this administration been reported on by the media?	Right or wrong, when children are dying, the last thing we should do is start with the whataboutism. 	We, as a nation, should be so much better than that.
@JoyceWhiteVance If nothing we’ve learned so far has damaged Trump, then I have a hard time believing anything will.  	I will never understand why so many people defend this man, and will continue to do so , even after all we know. 	It’s truly bizzaro world.
@JohnWoodrowCox @TheWillHobson This is truly ridiculous.  I love NCAA football, but there’s too many entities that make way too much money from it, including some of the universities. It’s no longer affordable for many fans to take a family to a game because of these huge paydays.
@I_want_my_252 @jacobsoboroff @GarrettHaake You’re exactly right.  This doesn’t pass the smell test.  Something is off.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Tired of your circular,  nonsensical, bull. I’m really out this time.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Geez.   You’re an idiot.   Who pays when people declare bankruptcy?????
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST We obviously disagree.  You aren’t going to change my mind, so it’s pointless to keep doing this.  Have a nice day.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST And yes, I would honestly love to not pay for insurance.   There’s a lot of different things I could spend that money on.  I pay it in case someone in my family needs medical care.  Is it fair for me to lay that at the feet of others?  Thus insurance, which spreads the risk.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Why would someone risk bankruptcy or years of payments (that taxpayers are essentially extending them credit for), if they could have full coverage?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Since it’s a federal program, I don’t get what you’re asking.  And yes, people should have to buy in, because it doesn’t work if they don’t. The government forces us to pay for other things, why not healthcare?  Why would someone not want coverage?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST It’s not insane.  Pay attention.  If most people didnt have insurance, your stupid scenario where people pay out their debt or declare bankruptcy wouldn’t be a possibility, because hospitals and doctors would go out of business.  You seriously don’t get that?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST You are being intentionally obtuse and ignoring the point.   Answer my question.  Will hospitals be able to stay in business and extend credit to these good souls that will pay off their bills, if the majority of people don’t have insurance?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Quit being obtuse.  The only reason some people are able to make payments to pay off their bills is because the majority of people have insurance	Is the system messed up?  Yes.  	But don’t act like it would work if the majority of people didn’t pay their bills.  Prove me wrong.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Hypothetical.... what if everyone declined insurance coverage and just declared bankruptcy for medical bills?   What would happen to the hospitals then?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Have you ever declared bankruptcy?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Those bills still have to be paid.  Who do you think is paying them when the hospital writes them off
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST You’re arguing that uninsured people made it better??  You’re arguing both sides.  	There are many people that were uninsured that are financially ruined now because of unexpected medical expense.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Now... you answer my question.  Who pays for the emergency care of people that don’t have insurance?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Seriously?? The reason insurance works is because not everyone needs it at the same time.  I paid for it for years when I was healthy and didn’t need it.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Are you dense?  Obviously I think the answer is yes with regards to Health Insurance.  It doesn’t have to be the same way in all instances, but yes, I don’t have a problem with the govt telling people what to do in this instance.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST How far are you willing to go by forcing others to pay for emergency services for people without insurance?  We’re talking about the same thing in that respect.  Taxpayers would be forced to pay for individuals without insurance.  How is that different?
@zelliej1 @Paine_1776 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Yes.   Me too.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST Surely you agree that we all pay for most people that are uninsured if they need emergency services.  Why should we be forced to do that if there’s an alternative?   Why not force someone to pay what they can?  Then they also get the benefit of seeing a doctor electively too.
@zelliej1 @Paine_1776 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST I understand about the (full) price, but I think that prices that aren’t negotiated are way too high.  Surely we can agree on that.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST You understand that the hospital could afford to work with you because other people that have insurance could pay full price, correct?	If an uninsured person has a car accident, the cost can run into the hundreds of thousands.  They can’t pay that off.  It’s impossible.
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST But you obviously could’ve afforded insurance.  	How could someone that couldn’t afford insurance be able to pay off expensive surgeries?  	Who paid for your debt that was forgiven?
@Paine_1776 @zelliej1 @johnddavidson @seanmdav @FDRLST If someone chooses not to have health coverage because they can’t afford it, but suddenly needs emergency surgery to save their life, who pays then?
@DavidSpade @Uber I think this is already been mentioned, but how about simply telling the driver, “I’m tired, I don’t really feel like talking”. 	That seems like the decent thing to do, and then the driver isn’t left guessing, and you have to actually have enough guts to communicate face to face.
@AmeriChrist @realDonaldTrump But what happens when working people choose to spend their money on other things, then they or their children need emergency surgery(like an appendectomy, to save their life. 	Who pays for that?
@RepMarkMeadows @ChuckGrassley This is not rhetorical... If it’s no big deal, or if there’s a whole lot more to the story, why did he plead guilty?		After seeing many of your tweets, I frankly don’t trust you to be objective about anything regarding this investigation.  		If it’s not a big deal, why lie?
@realDonaldTrump I usually try to respect the office of the President, but this tweet... I just can’t.  		Either you’re one of the dumbest human beings on the planet, or you think Americans are the dumbest human beings on the planet.  		Just man up and admit you said stupid stuff to get elected.
@AriFleischer I remember Trump saying while campaigning that if he was elected he would direct his attorney general to investigate Hillary.   I didn’t hear one word from you about justice then.   I’m tired of the straight up hypocrisy.
@TheContemptor All Trump had to do to foil this evil plan by these evil women was not cheat on his wife... twice.  	This is FOX NEWS in all of its propagandizing glory... blaming the women because the Donald couldn’t keep the little Donald in his pants.
@GDVegasK @realDonaldTrump No Bob... people are upset because our President is a name calling hypocrite, and when he’s telling the truth, it’s an ultra freaking rarity, and in this case he’s doing it only to demean.  	He’s like a public school on a Sunday... He has no class.
@SamuraiJW @GilbertCTweets @PubliusPost64 @brithume You don’t think his opponents would’ve been relentless in using that information to try to sway some votes?   I would sincerely hope that it would’ve cost him some evangelical votes IF they knew he had paid off a porn star to keep quiet, but that might just be wishful thinking.
@OGandE   The power has been off for 12 to 14 hours and there’s not even an orange truck in town.  Can you please give me an estimate when power might return north of Alma?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Okay.  You win.  Trump is a paragon of truthfulness.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Another cop out.  For some reason, you don’t believe the evidence that’s been presented.   And I guarantee you there are more people that believe he’s a daily liar than believe that he’s truthful.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Anyone can put their head in the sand and claim lack of evidence.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Talk about a cop out.  There’s plenty of evidence, you just don’t believe the sources and I do.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Answer my question.  What are you basing your conclusion on?   You don’t know him or any of his associates personally, I take it.  So aren’t you doing the same thing you accuse me of doing?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews What are you basing your opinion on that he’s not lying daily?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I haven’t struggled.  There’s severe weather here and I’m going between twitter and the news.  This Twitter thing is the least of my worries right now.  I’m done.  Have a good evening
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Ok.  Answer this.  Does Trump lie?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I don’t have to prove anything.  I believe he lies daily because of what I see and hear.   You don’t.  I get it.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I know he lies daily.  Believe what you want.  I really don’t care.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Here’s one that you’ll appreciate.  Prove to me Trump is NOT a serial liar.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews You’re talking out of both sides of your mouth.  You say that you never implied that Trump hasn’t lied, but you’re telling me to tell you when.  I think you know good and well when he has.
@jllgraham @TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I’ll ask you directly, because you keep posting stuff about Obama.  Do you honestly believe Trump hasn’t lied?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews How about when he said he knew nothing about a payment to Stormy Daniels?   Then later Giuliani said that he had in fact paid her.   	https://t.co/GLKssJJHYT
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Are you honestly saying Trump hasn’t lied?  Seriously??
@jllgraham @TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Can’t read the article.  Does it say that Obama didn’t believe you could keep your doctor when he said it?
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @jllgraham @JackPosobiec @FoxNews If he’s stupid enough to believe that Mexico would’ve paid for a wall he had NO business leading a country.  I’m a nothing, nobody, Joe Schmoe and I knew Mexico wouldn’t pay for a wall.
@TheVantu @jllgraham @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews He believes a lot of things that are wrong then.  If you’re using that logic, Obama wasn’t lying when he said you could keep your doctor.  I’m sure he truly believed that.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews https://t.co/6JOZ8ALEBb
@TheVantu @jllgraham @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I’ll give you one on his first week in office.  He said his inauguration crowds were bigger than Obama’s.  His lies have gotten more sinister and more frequent since then.
@TheVantu @JoeSmit61826251 @jllgraham @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews Then following that logic, you’re obviously not okay with it when Trump lies, correct?	His lies are well documented and voluminous.  Do you support him and his lies?
@TheVantu @jllgraham @JoeSmit61826251 @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews I don’t like being lied to, period.   It doesn’t matter to me which party does it, I don’t like it.  	However, Trump is the all time champion at telling falsehoods by a long shot.  Are you okay with this?
@jllgraham @JoeSmit61826251 @TheVantu @MUZ_ @JackPosobiec @FoxNews So you don’t like that Obama lied, but you seem to be okay when Trump lies.  Why?
@KUCER70 @jefflongKU Feltner’s, with Tucker Colosseum at Arkansas Tech seen through the back window.
@MSNBC But Trump only hires the best people, right?
@ericbolling If your point is valid, that means Trump hired a slimeball, lying lawyer who worked with him for a long time.  But I’ll bet that doesn’t concern you at all, correct? 	You keep defending this lying POTUS.  WHY?
@ToddMitchem @CillizzaCNN Yes.  I know this.  It’s just my opinion that interviews of politicians where the questions are known beforehand are by and large worthless unless the interviewer is able to follow up with some unscripted questions.  Otherwise, isn’t it all just talking points?
@mrcoldshower @CillizzaCNN I understand that it’s done industry wide.  It was widely reported when CNN did it.
@ToddMitchem @CillizzaCNN I understand this for a non politician because it leads to a good, informative interview.  	 But sometimes I like to see politicians answer some questions that they might not be prepped on just to see how they respond.
@mrcoldshower @CillizzaCNN Are you saying both are okay, neither is okay, or you don’t care only when FOX does it?
RT @rodger: you can keep Ohio State-Michigan, I'm gonna keep on watching Baylor-Texas Tech waiting for players to stand next to each other…
@ChuckLane1 More of the same in the poor category, which was what you referenced.  Sorry. Only 7% of respondents said the economy was poor.  85% of that 7% were Democrats.
@ChuckLane1 This is not what that poll says.   Look at it again.  23 % of respondents said the economy was not good and 83% of that 23% were democrats - that’s a yuge difference from what you stated. 	51% of respondents said the economy was good and 47% of that 51% were Democrats.
@werewolfMA I apologize.  I sincerely didn’t mean to affect the effort for this family to raise money or diminish them or their circumstances in any way.
@werewolfMA What abuse?  Honestly asking.  I started a convo about political rhetoric.
@werewolfMA So what else can I do except apologize and say that wasn’t my intent?  Which I’ve done...
@werewolfMA @C_Stroop I honestly didn’t realize I was doing that.  I just thought I was having a discussion about stupid political rhetoric.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop It’s toxic for me to say that some Christians are nice?  Whatever.  The term “Honey” is very condescending and frankly offensive.  I haven’t called anyone names or condescended in any way.
@C_Stroop @DesnaStan Whatever.   I was just wanting a conversation about something I thought we agreed on.  Since I’m a Christian, it makes sense to me to say that I didn’t think all Christians were like that, but apparently that’s bad form too.  I’m done.  I’ve unfollowed so I won’t bother you again
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop But after I explained, I was still skewered.  Go figure.
@C_Stroop @DesnaStan I just expressed that, even as a Christian, I agree with you about this crazy political rhetoric by evangelicals, and that it pisses me off.  I stupidly thought that was relevant and might start a productive conversation.  I won’t make the same mistake again.
@C_Stroop @DesnaStan I honestly didn’t realize I was not being tactful.    I was just saying that even as a Christian I get frustrated by the Christian political rhetoric.  I guess I don’t know a tactful way to say that.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop I just thought we were talking about political rhetoric, and it obviously evolved to something I wasn’t even thinking about.  I apologize.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop Geez.  I didn’t mean to be trite or disengenuous.  That wasn’t my intention at all.  I don’t even know what I was trying to convey anymore.  I’m out.
@C_Stroop @DesnaStan Gotcha.  I just thought that’s what Twitter is for.  I won’t make the mistake again.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop I apologize if I came across like that.  It wasn’t my intention.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop That wasn’t my intention, but okay.  I understand.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop No worries.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop I think I understand.  All I wanted to convey was that there are Christians that don’t blindly follow Republicans.  Honestly asking, is that wrong?
@pinklady_ktown @C_Stroop If I came across as defensive, that wasn’t my intention.  I’m very frustrated by what I’m seeing some so called Christians do.  That was my whole point.  I disagree with them, but I’m still a Christian, and there are many like me.  I’m not very good at this, I know but I’m trying
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop But there are too many that do follow that rhetoric.  That’s why I said I was frustrated.  I see some followers of a religion that aren’t following its basic teachings.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop I honestly think we’re saying the same thing.  I was only saying there are many other Christians that agree with me.  We all don’t just blindly follow Republican political rhetoric.
@ajax0510 @C_Stroop I agree completely and I’ve had this discussion with others many times.  Voting all comes down to the abortion issue for many Christians.  This needs to change
@C_Stroop @Irish_Atheist Didn’t mean to make it about me.  I just know there are many Christians who aren’t Trump supporters.  I know the ones you are talking about.  It’s frustrating to be a Christian when some are behaving like they are.
@C_Stroop Maybe I misunderstood, but the last thing I want to do is defend Trump’s base.  As a Christian, I honestly can’t believe any Christian supports him.  I was just saying there are some Christians who aren’t just blindly Republican.
@werewolfMA @C_Stroop I agree.   Completely.
@DesnaStan @C_Stroop Yes.  I’ve had multiple discussions.  And I’m not sure we’re talking about the same thing.  I’m talking about political rhetoric by evangelical leaders, not abuse.  If you’re talking about the Catholic Priests I don’t defend anything or anyone that did those abhorrent things.
@mimislo @C_Stroop I have spoken out on many tweets by evangelical leaders that I’ve seen that I think are wrong.  So have many others.  Go ahead and lump me in with all of them if it makes you feel better, but you’re wrong in doing so.
@C_Stroop I said it’s frustrating, and I obviously don’t have all of the answers.  But to vilify everyone that’s a Christian is wrong.
@Irish_Atheist @C_Stroop So you would advocate treating all Muslims the same?   I wouldn’t.
@C_Stroop It’s absolutely frustratingly true that there are some loud, so called Evangelical, voices out there that are completely wrong. However, there are also so many Christians that are good, decent, giving, folks, that quietly do the right thing.  Please don’t lump them together.
@ClaireBerlinski It’s the only explanation.  What frustrates me more though, is that so many of our elected officials won’t call him out for his awful behavior.  Even it’s a demonstrable lie, many Rs will fall all over themselves to back up the excuse for him.  I just don’t get it.
@MaxBoot It’s really beyond comprehension that our POTUS can’t honor the service members that have paid the ultimate sacrifice because of some bad weather.  VD was his Viet Nam, and now, apparently, weather is his WWII.  He only thinks of himself.  Sad.
@THEmrMATTERS @skyblujobim @McnallyKell @MDTeresa @CNNPR @jaketapper @abbydphillip @realDonaldTrump Also, good to know you’d support a serial murderer in office as long as the economy is good.  Do you really think someone like Bundy could keep from trampling civil liberties?  I know you’re being facetious, but a few interns might come up missing in a Bundy WH.
@THEmrMATTERS @skyblujobim @McnallyKell @MDTeresa @CNNPR @jaketapper @abbydphillip @realDonaldTrump I think character matters.  People without character, like Trump, base their decisions on things that aren’t necessarily important to me.  	Honestly, do you trust that Trump will do anything he says, ever?
@THEmrMATTERS @skyblujobim @McnallyKell @MDTeresa @CNNPR @jaketapper @abbydphillip @realDonaldTrump Absolutely, I do. If there were a hard decision to be made, such as whether to go to war, I do not trust Trump to make a good decision, other than what would be the best outcome for him personally. 	I’ve basically trusted all of the other presidents in my lifetime.  Trump.. no.
@THEmrMATTERS @skyblujobim @McnallyKell @MDTeresa @CNNPR @jaketapper @abbydphillip @realDonaldTrump But at some point the conduct and behavior of the elected official becomes one of the issues, no?	Where is your line?  Could he really shoot somebody in the middle of the street and still have your support?
@Elizabe96177273 @realDonaldTrump If it can be proven, prosecute her.  If not, they need to count the votes. 	From the outside, it seems they’re only questioning because they lost.  If she was still in a position to tamper, isn’t that ultimately the governor’s responsibility?
@LindseyGrahamSC If they’re breaking the law, prove it, and have them prosecuted.  Otherwise count the votes.   How long has Rick Scott been the gov?   If there was a problem, shouldn’t he have addressed it before now?
@LindseyGrahamSC @foxnewsradio @kilmeade I won’t listen to anything on Fox.  Ever.
RT @DougJones: Freedom of the press was considered by our founding fathers of such importance that they made it 1st. 		In America, we shoul…
@RealSaavedra Also, anyone that claims to be a journalist and isn’t condemning this hasn’t really done substantial journalistic work.
@marshallpattij @RealSaavedra @ProblemPanacea What did he do wrong?  He was asking a question.  That’s all.  If Trump doesn’t have the verbal skills to simply answer a question that he doesn’t like, he shouldn’t do pressers.  (which he doesn’t very often) 	I’ve seen high school football coaches answer tougher questions.
@RealSaavedra And, as usual with people like you, Trump receives none of the blame.  Why did he even call on Acosta?  It smells like a setup to me.
@Gary_Batey @RealSaavedra Manhandled?  Seriously?  She was rougher with him than he was with her.  Even so, there was absolutely no “manhandling” going on by either party.   You must’ve forgotten to put on your big boy pants this morning.
@cdefran145 @Olivianuzzi What promises has he made and kept?  He said we would have better healthcare, even better than Obamacare. Nope. 	He said he would build a wall.  Nope.  He said he wouldn’t have time for golf.  Nope. 	That’s just off the top of my head.  Plus all of his daily lies... dishonest.
@BelmarCPA @esaagar @TuckerCarlson I said that as a qualifier for context.  I’m not a fan, and this should never happen.  Obviously fans of his think it should never happen.  	And you have a high opinion of yours as well.  I certainly didn’t ask for it, but that’s kinda what this place does, no?
@BelmarCPA @esaagar @TuckerCarlson And this is Twitter, where people gather to sometimes *gasp* express opinions, like you just did.  Don’t berate me for giving mine while you are giving yours.  That’s just dumb.
@cdefran145 @Olivianuzzi “For all his lies, his actions are honest”.  Talk about brainwashing and blind acceptance.  You can’t see anything clearly. 	Wrap your brain around this.  He’s a dishonest, weak person.  Accept it.
@BelmarCPA @esaagar @TuckerCarlson Whatever.  You cared enough to respond, so I wouldn’t say no one cares.
@esaagar @TuckerCarlson Make no mistake, I don’t care for Tucker Carlson’s politics, or the job he does, but something like this should NEVER happen.  We have to be better than this.  It’s very fortunate that no one was hurt.
@cdefran145 @Olivianuzzi So it’s all about retribution for you and not actually truth. You are THE problem.  	There’s a difference between a liberal slant(which I don’t believe happens)and an outright lie.  If someone is lying, whether liberal or conservative, they should be called out. Why is this hard?
@PressSec If you have to speed edit the video to make your point, is your point really valid?   This is infuriating.   You should resign and @Acosta should sue for defamation.
@RCarls1 @VickiLynn47 @MaggieTrainor @thehill If you think Acosta was rude, you can’t have been paying attention to Trump for the last few years.  	I guess Acosta should’ve just grabbed the intern by the p****, because that’s apparently okay by Republican standards.
@RCarls1 @VickiLynn47 @MaggieTrainor @thehill I’ve watched the entire incident and there was no rude, disgraceful behavior towards the intern.  That’s complete “fake news”	It’s disgraceful behavior by a President against a journalist trying to do his job.  Trump just isn’t smart enough to spar with Acosta verbally.
RT @SarahBurris: Slowed down the @Acosta encounter to show the FOUR times the White House staffer touched HIM... not the other way around.…
@VickiLynn47 @MaggieTrainor @RCarls1 @thehill How, exactly, is he the enemy of the American people for trying to get an answer to his question?   Also, please explain what he’s lying about?
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta What exactly is your definition of swat?  She doesn’t react in the least to anything he did.
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta Show me where he slaps her hand.  Oh, I mean swats her away.  Please show me.  She touches him first.
@nevaeh19731 @AynRandPaulRyan @PressSec @Acosta Yes... so hard and so violently that she didn’t even react.   This proves that Repubs will try to make any ridiculous argument just to muddy the waters.
@KelVarnsenVanD @AynRandPaulRyan @PressSec @Acosta That’s what you’re going with?  And y’all call Dems snowflakes?
@starryjazzy @girlsreallyrule This is just fake news propaganda, as your dear president is fond of saying. There was no “karate chop”.  There was no reaction by the intern at all.  Wouldn’t a karate chop cause pain?  Talk about snowflakes. Geez
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta I’ve looked at the video.  You must get swatted in crowds all the time.  Did you give the people that swatted you their deserved beat down?
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta Lol. Really??  So, did he slap her hand, or swat her?   Point to the exact second in the video where he does either one of these.  	Like I said, I’ve literally seen coaches take tougher questions than Acosta asked the President.  Trump is extremely thin skinned.
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta And... you said he slapped her hand away at first.  Sounds like you’re the fake news propagandist.
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta Like I said, if your president doesn’t have enough sack to handle a rude reporter himself, he’s severely lacking in the leadership department.  I’ve seen college football coaches answer tougher questions than Trump and handle it much better.  Quit making excuses for him.
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta You support a president who lies more than any president in history and you’re playing the dishonest propaganda card.  Seriously??
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta Bullshit.  I’m not dishonest in the least.  Give me the second in the video where he “slaps her hand away”
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta He can’t handle Jim Acosta asking widdle questions???  How can he be expected to handle MAJOR decisions?? Decisions that actually mean something?  When our freedoms are eroded beyond return because of Trump, remember how it happened.
@whitforreal @jeffmason1 @PressSec @CNN @Acosta He didn’t swat away her hand. I watched the video. 	 If your President doesn’t have enough sack to answer questions and handle things himself, how in the hell do you expect him to effectively lead a country??   	He’s a joke and people like you are too.

She was wrong... first to assume he didn’t live there, and second to try and intervene.   If she was that worried, she should’ve called the police.   As I said earlier, he owed her no explanation.
@ShelbyCooperUSA @REEEEEpublicans @ABC It has nada to do with race or gender. Again, you’re obtuse. My point was that you don’t confront someone you think is breaking in because it could possibly result in your injury.  It has nothing to do with race at all.  I would’ve said the same thing if the man were white.
@ShelbyCooperUSA @REEEEEpublicans @ABC You’re obtuse.  The man certainly shouldn’t be blamed.   And yes, I’m blaming the person that confronted him because it shouldn’t have happened.  It makes no difference at all that it’s a woman.  I would’ve said the same thing had it been a man.  Nice deflection though.
@ShelbyCooperUSA @REEEEEpublicans @ABC If she was REALLY concerned she should have called the police.  If he had actually been trying to break in, she could’ve been seriously hurt.  The police will tell you that confronting someone that you think is committing a crime is always a bad idea.  He owes her no explanation.
@RepMattGaetz You and your party, led by Trump and Fox “News”, are the real experts at the dissemination of FAKE NEWS.
@steph93065 @travis_view He confirmed it.  As usual Gaetz is wrong.  I think anyone that would defend him is suspect.
@teller_ruth @kaitlancollins I’m not sure that Trump even knows what truth is, so I think you’re absolutely correct.  He is chronically, continually dishonest, and even so, he wants to be taken at his word.  I’ve honestly never seen anything like it.
@MZHemingway I also think that if you’re in the conservative media, and all you do is defend Trump, and can’t understand why some people get upset, or can’t admit where he fails, you should quit your job for the same reason.  You’re very bad at it.  	Trump lies. Please, at least admit that.
@barbarastarrcnn What would happen if they were needed for combat?  It’s disturbing that most of our top fighters at that base wouldn’t seem to be combat ready within a couple of days.  Is this an ignorant take?
@Errol_Ogman @tomshattuck @NoLeftTurn1 @CNN @brianstelter She’s not reading from a prompter, and she’s not the enemy. She’s just trying to do her job.  Get over yourself.  We need to find common ground to come together as a country and ridiculous statements like this just because of the way you perceive CNN don’t help.
@GlennThrush It bothers me that he’s getting ANYTHING from FOX “News”.    He has the best intelligence in the world at his disposal and yet he chooses Fox “News” for his arguments and talking points?  To me, that shows something questionable about his decision making process.
@AgentF16 @SenBlumenthal Do you support Trump?
@Sam_5thEstate I’m not reading this whole thread, so if she says differently, I won’t know, but there have been A LOT of sarcastic tweets about how this accusation didn’t make a difference.  I don’t think she’s celebrating ruing his life.  I actually think her feelings are quite the opposite.
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends Actually, I wish she would be prosecuted.  Then she could put on a defense and subpoena witnesses.
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends Exactly.
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends One honest question.  Do you watch anything but Fox?
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends Kavanaugh
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends So should Kavanagh be prosecuted as well?  - Lying about what terms in his yearbook mean.  -Lying about not knowing about Ramirez until the article in the New Yorker.
@RWiodcock @foxandfriends What should she be prosecuted for?
@LindseyGrahamSC @SenatorCollins Just remember, in the words of your nominee, “what comes around, goes around”.
@patrickbec @Lisa25497509 @jasuntzu @AndrewCFollett @altieri9 @eggsandbeer @charliekirk11 @JunkScience In my mind it means drunk enough that you don’t remember things you did the next day.
@Lisa25497509 @patrickbec @jasuntzu @AndrewCFollett @altieri9 @eggsandbeer @charliekirk11 @JunkScience The main one I’m concerned about is his statement that he never got drunk enough to black out.  Several Yale classmates say he did.
@patrickbec @jasuntzu @Lisa25497509 @AndrewCFollett @altieri9 @eggsandbeer @charliekirk11 @JunkScience Please show me where these have been proven false.  I honestly want to know.
@jimkatriney @HeyTammyBruce I’m not a lawyer, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, and I would wager he won’t sue.  If he does, witnesses could be deposed and could possibly testify.  Do you really think he wants this?  	(Lawyers please correct me if I’m wrong)
@samstein Do you think this hypocrisy is recognized and they do it anyway, or do you think they’re oblivious?
@NoahCRothman He wasn’t even on Trump’s beginning list.  I’m sorry, but I’m skeptical of this whole nomination.   I honestly can’t understand why some people aren’t?
@NoahCRothman Why does it have to be proven?  People are promoted or not all of the time based on the information at hand and how they perform in the job interview.  Honest question... why is he the end all be all of SCOTUS nominees?  Is he really the best candidate that Trump could find?
@BirchandMaple @marcusgilmer @ayesharascoe @AprilDRyan @PressSec @C_Stroop Just checking in from Arkansas to let you know there are quite a lot of people here that aren’t nearly as hypocritical as SHS is at times.
@EAD54 @JAngello85 @greggnunziata @ToddRuger What’s incorrect about the tweet?  It is whatever the WH says it is, correct?
@senorrinhatch Then release them so the public can see. You’ll excuse me if I would like to see for myself.
@Thalia_Nyx @AltUSPressSec I understand that.  But he accused a guy of drugging and raping people.  I’m just saying if I was that guy I would hire a lawyer. You don’t know if it’s true or not.
@Thalia_Nyx @AltUSPressSec I think he should sue.   I’m not a lawyer, but that tweet seemed libelous to me.
@AltUSPressSec I hope Urgo hires a lawyer when he finds out about this tweet.
@MonicaCrowley @realDonaldTrump Did he also come up with the name?  I thought he was referencing the USMC - United States Marine Corps - when I first saw it. 	Do you have any details on how it’s different than NAFTA?
@stucknLAwzmbies @ZagVanilla @ThomasHCrown How do you know?  Seriously asking?
@ZagVanilla @stucknLAwzmbies @ThomasHCrown Ok.  Some of his classmates at Yale are saying he did, but obviously that doesn’t convince you.  We just disagree on that point.
@ZagVanilla @stucknLAwzmbies @ThomasHCrown From many accounts he did lie about his drinking, plus the meaning of several terms in his yearbook. I think that’s disqualifying right there.  And you’re lucky it was delayed if you support him. If they had held the vote today he might not have been confirmed.
@stucknLAwzmbies @ThomasHCrown Why are you against getting all of the information possible?
@stucknLAwzmbies @ThomasHCrown He’s a judge and he potentially lied under oath.   You’re okay with that? If he lied about that, What else would he lie about?  Also, The witnesses don’t deny it.  They say they don’t remember.  One even says she believes Ford.  Would he put up with a lie in his courtroom?
@stucknLAwzmbies @ThomasHCrown Here’s what I want to know.  I want to know if HIS characterization of his drinking habits is accurate.  But it’s my understanding that can’t be asked.  It just seems suspicious if that question can’t be asked.
@ThomasHCrown And, what isn’t what who said??   I don’t know what statement you’re referencing.
@ThomasHCrown But the WH has even limited the people whose statements they can take.  Isn’t that too limited?
@ThomasHCrown So please explain to someone who is not a lawyer.  It seems the scope of the investigation is so narrow that there’s no way many of the accusations can even be investigated. So why is it idiotic to state that?
@ForecasterEnten Just curious as to why today was THE day to finally try Taco Bell?
@jtparkey @brithume Yes, I do.  So people who report on things like that for a living can look at them and evaluate them.   I don’t care if I personally see them.  I just think they should be seen.  There are plenty of people that would be glad to peruse them.
@jtparkey @brithume Lord no.   Have you?
@stevethib @jtparkey @brithume I don’t know what might be learned.  That’s the whole point.
@jtparkey @brithume If Brit wants him judged on his record, then it should all be released.  It’s a lifetime appointment.  Why the big rush?   If we know what he’s like and it takes a few months, SO WHAT?
@brithume Then have ALL of his records released.
@KerryHinkle @badtweethaver @borgiestaffa @Love_Hot_Dogs @verysmallracoon @copperbird7 @myshoeisuntied1 @McAllisterDen You know that she’s not a medical doctor, correct?
@MattWalshBlog Would he accept that as a defense in his courtroom?	  “Well, your honor, I was asked embarrassing questions so I lied”.  	If he would, he doesn’t deserve to be a judge. 	He knew the stakes and CHOSE to lie. 	Are you really saying it’s okay for a Judge to lie when under oath?
@KerryHinkle @verysmallracoon @copperbird7 @myshoeisuntied1 @Love_Hot_Dogs @borgiestaffa @McAllisterDen I have no problems whatsoever.  I’m just trying to keep an open mind and keep misinformation from being spread.
@KerryHinkle @Love_Hot_Dogs @copperbird7 @myshoeisuntied1 @borgiestaffa @McAllisterDen They never said they agree with Kavanaugh.  They never said it didn’t happen.  They said they don’t recall.  It’s definitely not corroboration, but it’s not refutation either, which is what you’re trying to make it.
@KerryHinkle @copperbird7 @myshoeisuntied1 @Love_Hot_Dogs @borgiestaffa @McAllisterDen They don’t say it never happened.  They say they don’t recall, and that’s a big difference.  One person who says she doesn’t recall also says she believes Ford. 	I do know there’s pretty strong evidence he lied about some seemingly little details.  I would like to know why.
@JerryFalwellJr @realDonaldTrump This takes what God can do completely out of the equation.  He needs people obedient to him, then he can work.  He doesn’t need any street fighter’s help.  You’re just so wrong about this and it’s frustrating that you can’t see that.
@davedix @oregonmom76 @AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO Do you have stats that they didn’t?
@airewavesmedia  The football games are great, but thank you for also showing the @AlmaHSBand ! https://t.co/BkS5K0um5X
@mdculham @charlescwcooke I think firm sincerity instead of conspiratorial anger would’ve been a good place to start for a future Jusitice of the Supreme Court.  I can never believe he’ll be unbiased regarding liberal cases now, and I was honestly trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.
@spotswoode @RichLowry What about these instances years before the hearing?  Why do you discount them?		https://t.co/dKk99r16qe
@TomCottonAR @SenBlumenthal Then maybe the President, who has lied more than 5000 times since he took office, should sit out commenting as well, if that is your standard.  Have you EVER said just ONE thing about his dishonesty?  	I’m truly embarrassed that you represent my state.
RT @SethAbramson: Beginning tomorrow, every nonwhite criminal defendant should demand that, in lieu of an investigation by law enforcement,…
@RoadKingCT @DLoesch @SenBlumenthal You’re saying that Blumenthal should never be believed because he lied about Vietnam Nam, correct?
@RoadKingCT @DLoesch @SenBlumenthal I was talking about his believability and if you would apply the same standard that you’ve applied to Blumenthal to Trump.  That if he’s said one thing false, nothing is to be believed.
@RoadKingCT @DLoesch @SenBlumenthal Think about this statement with regards to Trump.
@TerrenceBates4 @imlottolady531 @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @benshapiro @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @DennisPrager @marklevinshow And you need to google the difference between alluded and eluded.
@upper_fixer @FoxNews All of them are dangerous.  I truly believe FOX “News” stifles debate because none of these shows have an obligation to even hint at the other side of the story.   No issue is ever as black and white as these shows say.   We need to find more middle ground.
@WetHog @charlescwcooke I told you in my first reply it was sarcasm.  Was that not plain enough?
@WetHog @charlescwcooke So you don’t get sarcasm, eh?
@WetHog @charlescwcooke Oooh you got me.  But... sarcasm, because of the first lady’s ja...  oh never mind.
@charlescwcooke I’ll make a deal with you.  I’ll assume you’re really concerned about the truth if you’ll use your platform to correct everything the President says that’s a lie as well.  Otherwise, I really don’t care, do you?
@JohnCornyn You can’t have it both ways Senator.  You can’t slam the Dems for having already made up their mind, when you obviously have too. 	Also, when normal people are accused of a potential crime, law enforcement investigates.  Let some professional interrogators see what they can find.
@KathyLo128 @HashtagGriswold Before anyone believes this happened as stated, please google.
@jbarro I don’t know that anyone is looking for absolute proof.  I think that’s probably impossible. But it would be nice for some of these people to have to answer questions from skilled interrogators to see if their stories hold together.
@brithume Read the thread Mr. Hume.  Please...	She’s talking about the look Kavanaugh’s wife will have.
@Miguel_wyd42 @SenFeinstein So you don’t think Trump has committed sexual assault?
@Miguel_wyd42 @SenFeinstein Summer Servos debunked?
@Miguel_wyd42 @SenFeinstein I was specifically talking about the sexual assault.
@Miguel_wyd42 @SenFeinstein Great!   Now do Trump and his accused cases of sexual assault. That is, if you’re not a hypocrite.
@greg_doucette Why can’t they just expand their background check to consider the new information has come to light?  If they’ve done 6, why not an abbreviated 7th?
@karliesl @MZHemingway You’re either trolling me or you’re just obtuse.  We are not talking about the same thing.
@hughhewitt @FBI Even if you’re right about this, so what?  The process gets held up a little bit for a lifetime appointment.  I don’t understand the problem with taking the time needed.  Spurious allegations will be easily disproved. Credible allegations should be investigated fully.
@BenFriedman @hughhewitt @FBI This makes so much sense that there’s no way anyone in this government will be okay with it.
@karliesl @MZHemingway What are you even talking about?? This is dated 2009.
@MonicaCrowley Are you saying that being under investigation tells the public something about a person’s character?
@karliesl @MZHemingway It’s not the letters that I want to see.  It’s all of the classified documents that the President wants only specific parts of released.  These haven’t been released yet.  	 Btw - you need to read and listen to other sources, even if you don’t agree with them.
@karliesl @MZHemingway I don’t have a problem with it being released.  It just seems very specific.  I want to have all of the information released.  My original point was that it seems a reporter would be suspicious when only very specific parts are released.  Please tell me you can see that point.
@karliesl @MZHemingway Then why was the president specifying what he wants released?  If Congress has asked for the exact same thing, can you show me a source?  I don’t mean this as argumentative, if Congress has done this, I want to know.
@enlightenedin1 @MZHemingway Because he’s only declassifying selected parts and not the whole thing.  Why can’t you understand that???
@MZHemingway @karliesl Please explain to me how a real journalist wouldn’t be suspicious of selectively unclassified material that’s, I’m sure, going to support the President’s side.	Is this just about winning for you, or finding the truth?   Why do you think he won’t declassify all of it?  Seriously?
@AviAhvee @MZHemingway It’s so frustrating to me that she will ignore the obvious hypocrisy in this.
@MZHemingway Then why not declassify all of it?   How can YOU be a journalist and not think that selective declassification is suspicious?  Do you really believe selective releasing is transparent?  I know you won’t answer and that proves your partisanship.   Real journalists want to see all.
@_The_Big_Ern @DanimalVIII @Jim_Jordan @FBI Because they’re only releasing portions.  I’m good if they release it all.
@BMFuda0307 @sherlou710 @Jim_Jordan Lol.  You really don’t get why she called him Gym?
@Jim_Jordan I honestly can’t believe you can’t see your own hypocrisy.  If it’s a good thing, let’s see it all, starting with Trump’s tax returns.  Then, Trump should sit down and answer Mueller’s questions.  Let’s just get everything out there and let the public decide.  Do you agree?
@mn6824 @RyanGirdusky So you really think he was scratching his head??	And the best explanation you have is that he’s trolling people??    	So basically he’s not racist, just stupid.
@mn6824 @RyanGirdusky He’s the one that did it, and he purposely did it on national television!  I was only asking why.  If his career is destroyed, it’s because of something he did, not me.  	All I asked for was a reasonable explanation of why he did it.  I don’t think I’m the crazy one here.
@mn6824 @RyanGirdusky Then why did the coast guard guy do it?  That’s all I’m asking.  I don’t even know his politics
@gregcool1 @NaZReD1 @RyanGirdusky In my first tweet, I was only pointing out that it wasn’t a BS story, in my opinion.  I was merely asking for a reasonable explanation as to why he did it, and not surprisingly, no one has provided one.   	Have you seen the video?   He’s not flashing the “ok” sign.
@mn6824 @RyanGirdusky It was.  But it’s evidently a thing now.  Can you explain why Coast Guard guy did it and why he was removed from that position?
@NaZReD1 @RyanGirdusky I understand that this is a recognized hand signal for “okay”, but what the Coast Guard guy did was different.  All I’m asking for is an explanation for why he did it.  It’s not the circle game, and he’s not signaling okay.  So what was he doing?
@captainmikemd @RyanGirdusky At least you’re admitting that the coast guard guy did flash that sign.  Why would he do this?
@captainmikemd @RyanGirdusky It’s not the circle game.  That has to be below the waist to count.  Does this guy not know the rules?
@RyanGirdusky Why don’t you explain what he was doing then?  I’ll bet it’ll be a bullshit, racist enabling explanation.  I wish the press WOULD quit covering the White House.  99% of what comes from Trump is complete and utter bullshit and shouldn’t be given the platform.

@JohnCornyn I’m just wondering if you actually read replies to your tweets.  It doesn’t seem so.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino LOL.  All right.  You’re just trolling me now.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino I think you might actually be Donald Trump tweeting under an alias. You sound like you’re 10 years old. Are you Dana Denison??
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino I can debate all day.  I just said there’s no use debating YOU because it would be like banging my head against a brick wall, and I think you’ve proven my point.   I’m out.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino You’ve got it backwards there, Dana.  I’m not interested in debating with someone who thinks Fox News isn’t biased because it would be a colossal waste of time.  There’s no way I would ever change your mind.  And, “left wing urban myths”...  What is that even?
@FoxNews More Fox propaganda.   I was gonna explain, but I’ve realized it won’t do any good.  This tweet accomplished its mission - to let the base see it. They don’t care whether it’s true or not... just that someone on Fox said it is enough for them.
@RossyD84 @ChrisCuomo Gotcha...  Also, to your point, even though it may not be their target demo, I’m sure Nike could care less about College of the Ozarks when they sponsor Alabama, Clemson, Georgia, Arkansas etc.  	College of the Ozarks was just looking for a little free publicity, in my opinion.
@RossyD84 @ChrisCuomo Hey, I may be coming in late on this, so I might not understand what the conversation has been. But, I live in the Ozarks, and my next athletic shoe purchase will be just like 90% of all of the other times for most of my life - Nike.
@TuckerCarlson You’re just digging deeper.  You were wrong.  Just admit it.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino Respectfully... That is just false. Their news department leans right.  Their opinion shows are so far right that it should be embarrassing.  If you’re reading transcripts and such, you should know this.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino If you’re avoiding radical, political, outlets, you should avoid Fox.
@oh_melodylane @tobyismybaby @CalebJHull @DanaPerino So where should we get our news?  What are the news outlets that form your opinion?
@brithume Don’t investigations happen all of the time and it’s found that there isn’t evidence of a crime?   Isn’t that why there are investigations?  Why would you state a crime if it turns out there isn’t one?  I’m not being sarcastic here.  What am I missing?
@JohnCornyn @USATODAY Do you really think that Kim Jong Un is dumb?  He is playing Trump and tweets like this show that it’s working. 	I’m beginning to think our lawmakers are dumb.  Do you seriously think these missiles not being in a parade means anything?? Please answer this.
@survivor92959 @foxandfriends @NineLineApparel Don’t speak for this American.  I think being free to protest is one of the things that makes this country great.  They’ve said this protest has nothing to with the military.  Why is doing something to bring attention to a racial injustice a bad thing?
@Holly2360 @brithume I was pointing out that the article that Mr. Hume said was spot on, said to diligently investigate his background.  It didn’t say diligently investigate his judicial record.  Thus the question that I posed.
@brithume A quote from the article. 	“So, yes, scrutinize his record. Diligently investigate his background.”	 How could they possibly diligently investigate if they had only 10% of his record, as well as many things arbitrarily assigned confidential by a partisan lawyer?
@redsteeze Then why didn’t Cornyn and Grassley just tell him they had already been released instead of reading him the riot act?  That is what sounds like a stunt.  It makes no sense.
@LiberalD3mocrat @FoxNews Lol.  I know, but I used to work in news, so I’m very disappointed in myself.  I just get angry at Fox, because I think they’re much to blame for all of the crazy partisan rhetoric now, on the right and the left.   I actually like to read objective news accounts.
@LiberalD3mocrat @FoxNews Correct.  It is opinion.  That’s my bad.  It seems most of their stuff is opinion,  and as I just unintentionally proved by being an idiot, the lines get blurred.
@LiberalD3mocrat @FoxNews That’s not true.   Leave out positive or negative descibers and just say what happened.  News organizations used to be good at this.  Fox never has been.
@STLsherpa @JonahNRO Okay,  but it was not released until that morning.  Why not release all of the documents in plenty of time for a thorough review.  Why did it take this long to release?  Why not his entire record?  Why did Burke even think this needed to be withheld?  Why?   Why? Why?
@FoxNews Is it possible for an organization with the actual word “News” in its name to write an unbiased headline?  Nope, not if it’s FOX.
@jonathanchait @zacbrownband I always thought it meant he liked his chicken fried... not baked or boiled or grilled or any other way.
@JuddLegum I don’t understand why he’s even involved.  Is this typical of SCOTUS nominations?
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepLeeZeldin @mattgaetz @CongressmanHice @RepAndyBiggsAZ @replouiegohmert @RepScottPerry If you’re truly committed to this, I think that’s a good thing.  Please release ALL of the documents regarding the Kavanaugh appointment too.  Also, if truthfulness is really what you seek, get the President to release his tax returns. Let’s get it all out there and then decide.
@STPacker915 @Bust3d00 @JoeTalkShow @Nike I don’t understand your reasoning.   It sounds like you agree with police brutality.  	The U.S. doesn’t really have a great track record for treating all races equally, correct?  	If kneeling during the national anthem can help change that, how is that a bad thing?
@kylegriffin1 What does it say about the man that he still isn’t spelling counsel correctly?  It has to be purposely misspelled at this point, correct?
@CarolHLN @carlbernstein @CNN needs to sue Trump.  He’s trying to ruin their brand and actually having some success.  He shouldn’t be able to use his office for personal vendettas against companies he doesn’t like. Where is Congress??

@GGGGreatNiece @Franklin_Graham @POTUS You’re uninformed.  Read up.
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS In my opinion, Christianity needs better leaders than you at this point in time.  You’re leading people astray.   You praise something abstract like promoting religious freedom, but won’t condemn his policy of separating families??  What’s Christian about that?  Seriously?
@vfx_dude @brianstelter @_ImperatorRex_ @ThomasWictor @KurtSchlichter @ScottAdamsSays @JackPosobiec @drawandstrike If they’re standing by the story after all of this extra scrutiny...  well, if I were a betting man, I would bet that the story is correct.
@LindseyGrahamSC @foxandfriends I’m SURE that’ll be a hard hitting interview with no pulled punches.
@DrMcKuKu @glc203 @oliverdarcy @brianstelter @ainsleyearhardt Show me news releases of any of these except Bill Clinton.  Or, show me a link to these pictures from a legit source please.
@samstein I believe Gingrich and others will tweet statements like this with the full knowledge that many in their base will take this statement at face value and won’t accept other explanations.  They don’t care if it can be challenged. They only care about getting the message out.
@briansflood FOX “News” viewers...  please read the comments below.  Please, PLEASE, REALIZE that Fox is LYING to you to advance conservative talking points that are demonstrably false.  	This should piss you off.  Make them do better.  Boycott advertisers.
@theturk47 @deadeye42 @stephenfhayes He’s a lawyer and had a lawyer representing him. Does it really make sense that he would’ve pleaded to something that wasn’t a crime?  If so, that’s the worst lawyering in the history of lawyering.  I don’t buy it.
@BillOReilly Could it be all of the negative things he says and does?
@FoxNews It’s truly amazing how many Americans can’t see the big picture, and I blame Fox News for much of it because they pander to the viewer and don’t honor big ideals. 	So many positive changes have come about because of Americans protesting, and other Americans defending that right.
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump If the intel com was weaponized to take down Trump with Hillary as the favorite in the campaign, whoever did this doesn’t concern me at all. They’re obviously completely stupid and inept.  All of the polls said Hillary would win.  How did she lose with all of this help?
@RepMarkMeadows As long as the next time that there’s a Democrat in the White House all of the Republicans in the previous administration lose their security clearance, I’m good with it. 	You just don’t seem to get the system of checks and balances... sad.
@TomCottonAR @realDonaldTrump Yes, let’s execute everyone with a drug problem or that deals drugs.  I honestly am angry that you even gave that ridiculous opinion a voice, and it tells me all I need to know about you.  	We need smart people to come up with smart solutions.  I don’t think you’re qualified.
@yashar So is he semi decent or a hack?  You can’t have it both ways.  Btw... I can’t believe I’m sucked in to this really meaningless argument.

@ljcljf @nothxci @sam_vinograd @OMAROSA So your position is since Hillary’s email was potentially hacked, that it’s okay for Trump to use his personal phone?
@sam_vinograd @OMAROSA I thought I read where the President won’t give up his unsecure phone and still makes calls from it.  If this is true, it starts at the top.
@ThisWeekABC Please quit having @KellyannePolls on as a guest.  She won’t answer questions.
@KellyAnnPolls You are public servants!   There should be no NDAs signed.  The public has a right to know everything that happens in OUR house.
@sharlow_2 @ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch positively or negatively on the NRA whether she says she’s in her official capacity or not.  If she personally disagreed with an NRA position, would they be okay with her saying so on the air even when she’s not working as the NRA spokesperson?  I don’t think they would.
@sharlow_2 @ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch No conspiracy at all.  Almost every job in the public eye is like this.   You’re representing your employer at all times, and your employer will unequivocally make sure you’re aware of that fact. Whatever she says at any time could reflect either
@TheRynoMiller @ChrisLoesch @McDonalds I didn’t instantly assume anything.  HE brought it up. If you can’t see what he was trying to do, then nothing I say will change your mind.
@ChrisLoesch First, acting in a film, is a lot different than doing live unscripted news hits.  Any opinion and bias in acting is that of the writer.  Any bias in news(even though there should be none) is that of the reporter.	Second, you’re still making fun of those jobs and you know it.
@ChrisLoesch Classy....but definitely expected.   I know how the media works and the expectations of credible news reporters and spokespersons.  I guess you just don’t.  	And you’re very disrespectful of the hardworking people in the fast food industry.  @McDonalds
@KevinPa32281061 @ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch I don’t remember him being a news reporter.
@KevinPa32281061 @ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch So you’re saying that he could separate himself from the NRA while he was President of that organization?   	Was he also doing unrelated live hits for news networks during that time?
@VeraMBergen Un-impressive
@BillOReilly How much have you done?  I mean, besides a couple of tweets.  	I live in the mid south and I’ve seen media coverage of it.   You tweet like the media is supposed to fix it.  	If I live in a completely different region and know about it, it seems they’ve done their job.
@ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch Would she ever say anything that contradicts the NRA while commentating on FOX?   I think not.
@ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch She operates in that capacity just by being their spokesperson.  You’re the one that makes no sense.  You don’t turn a job like that off and on.
@ChrisLoesch @Kjunesu @DLoesch I think her NRA affiliation should at least be disclosed, even when talking about what you say are non related events.  Give the viewer the information and let them decide.  Wait, isn’t that pretty close to Fox’s tag line?  	Not disclosing seems shady IMO.  But it’s Fox, so...
@DLoesch Just about all of the responses in this thread could just do what you suggest.  If someone has been libeled in TV, then sue.  There are laws to remedy that.  	But, social media outlets can boot people that violate their terms of service.  That’s not violation of free speech
@TomCottonAR @SenKamalaHarris I would like for those documents to be produced.  I seriously don’t understand the problem with taking the time to get a SCOTUS nomination right. It was proven with Garland that 8 justices can do the job for a while.  	START DOING YOUR JOB!
@Robeno @GC_Esau @AaronBlake @brianstelter After that “joke” you have absolutely NO standing to judge anyone’s sense of humor.  	Comedy 101 - #1.  Jokes should be funny.
@brithume It puzzles me that some conservatives can’t understand that this thing with Trump isn’t because he’s a Republican.  It’s because he’s a liar that can’t be trusted.  The POTUS should be better than that.  Why is that such an awful position?   Seriously?
@stevefox247 @crisdosev @mattgaetz @DonaldJTrumpJr He reported EXACTLY what a REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL said in a statement.  How else should he word it?
@Amy_Siskind 100% agree with both.   Quit covering them.  The public gets nothing of substance from these press briefings or campaign events.
@SaysSimonson For those of you that don’t like the media, I have a simple solution.  Just quit.  Quit watching. Quit reading. Quit listening.  Quit consuming these stories.  The media depends on consumers to make money.  Start doing without the information they bring you.
@zaclynch23 @DLoesch Okay... misleading... uninformed.   Even though those are a stretch imo, I’ll give you that.  One thing...journalists are human and asked to report on many things.  They won’t be experts on everything.  But I still don’t see the “blatant lies” that you stated in your premise.
@zaclynch23 @DLoesch So you think “easier to sneak past metal detectors”, and “often undetectable” are blatant lies?	So, you’re saying that these guns are always detectable?
@zaclynch23 @DLoesch I’ve seen exactly what you just said reported.  Where is the blatant lie?   		If you and I have seen it reported, then the good information is out there, so saying the entire msm blatantly lies is just false.  		There are laws against reporters lying.  They don’t want a lawsuit.
@zaclynch23 @DLoesch Okay.  Then give me some blatant lies by msm outlets.
@DLoesch Have you given any thought as to what it would be like without a free press?  	People in power could literally get away with murder and we would never know.  	Unequivocally, the press is NOT the enemy.  	Is it perfect? No.  Needed? Yes	Can no one see the big picture anymore?
@zaclynch23 @DLoesch What blatant lies has Acosta reported?
@marcthiessen What Hillary did and what Trump did just aren’t the same thing, and you SHOULD know that.  	I honestly can’t believe I’m saying that to a political columnist for the WaPo.  I can explain why, but I feel like you already know and are just pandering to Fox viewers.
@skdietsch @DLoesch @Acosta Do you think our country’s leader sets a good example for children?
@Bfadair @novablue18 @LadySayruh @CountryLivingG1 @charliekirk11 @GeorgeFeldman17 This mentions nothing about Secret Service.
@Bfadair @novablue18 @LadySayruh @CountryLivingG1 @charliekirk11 @GeorgeFeldman17 Whatever... Why can’t you just say where you got your information?   What’s the big deal?
@Bfadair @LadySayruh @CountryLivingG1 @novablue18 @charliekirk11 @GeorgeFeldman17 I know what you’re saying, I’m just wondering how you know this.  He really doesn’t seem too worried about emoluments to me.
@Bfadair @LadySayruh @CountryLivingG1 @novablue18 @charliekirk11 @GeorgeFeldman17 Where did you get the information that he puts them up for free?
@teller_ruth @realDonaldTrump I’ve said this many times.  I’m no intellectual by any stretch of the imagination, but I actually think I might edge out the President in the brains department.  He’s the only President EVER, with which I would even entertain that thought. 	That scares me.
@kirklite @DirectionalMike @JesseBWatters @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld Thank you for your answers.   I appreciate you taking the time to explain.   Personally, I don’t care for Trump, but I want to make sure I hear and learn why he has support. Have a good evening.  Thanks again!
@kirklite @DirectionalMike @JesseBWatters @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump @WattersWorld I’m not trying to be inflammatory or looking to argue, I’m honestly curious as to why you support him.
@DougHeye I used to follow Levin on Twitter, but I had to stop for my own sanity.  He’s on the outer fringe and ultra partisan.  He just plays to his viewers and doesn’t seem to care about objectivity in the least.  It’s total spin.
@AnnCoulter @yashar 21 sources and he got a bum steer?
@DAC1924 @EricTrump When Obama hit 5% one quarter, was that God’s blessing as well?
@hell_oh_clarice @JulieBanderas @soledadobrien @MeghanMcCain I don’t think it’s ever okay.  There’s no exchange of ideas when dissenting opinions are shouted down.  Any person that does this needs to do better.  	Fox News hosts are just so blatant with their agenda, it’s almost comical.  Except, it just isn’t.
@JulieBanderas @soledadobrien @MeghanMcCain I don’t know who you are, but I knew you were from Fox just by the content of your tweet.  	I saw Mcain’s segment on the view.  She was shouting down other opinions and didn’t appear interested in debating.  Why is that okay?	And...”not to brag”, then bragging... classy.
@TomCottonAR Just wondering if all of the Russian sanctions that you all voted overwhelmingly for have been implemented yet.  If not, why not?
@seanhannity The headline isn’t what the story says, therefore you lied, which isn’t surprising.  This is full blown Fox “News” propaganda.  Your first line says that Pompeo says Russians have been *attempting* to undermine elections.  	Not quite the same thing is it?  	ins-Hannity.
@Untouchable7320 @david224 @JCSJR58 @FoxNews And Clinton was impeached for it.
@biannagolodryga Do you have any information to contradict what “Russia says”?   How nice it would be if you did.
@seanhannity Ins-Hannity
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @DevinNunes Fox “News” knows Trump is in trouble because they are in full blown ridiculous crisis spin mode.  	Devin Nunes??? Ha!! That literally made me laugh.  It seems that Fox “News” is actually entertaining me now.
@seanhannity As I said earlier, it’s easy to tell when Trump has royally screwed up because Fox “News” starts bringing up Obama and Hillary.  This in no way makes Trump siding with Putin okay.  Fox is just stirring up his base, and they are falling for it, as usual.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @BarackObama You know Trump screwed up badly because Fox “News” has started spinning the greatest hits.   Seriously... if you’re a devoted Fox viewer, please reconsider.
@FoxNews @BarackObama Fox “News” propaganda machine back at it, stirring up the base Republicans.  They know exactly what they’re doing, and it’s wrong.
@dmartosko @EricTrump @StJude No one should have a problem with taxpayer money paying for the President’s travels.  But that money SHOULDN’T go to his properties for this reason - We shouldn’t be able to question if the President’s businesses are profiting because of his office.  Why is this so hard to grasp?
@Franklin_Graham @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I sincerely can’t believe you’re defending this mess.  Russia committed an act of war by manipulating our free elections.  We need a President that understands this and will deal with it appropriately.
@foxandfriends @SebGorka @RandPaul @JonHuntsman @jasoninthehouse @JustinWallin1 @danielhoffmanDC @MariaBartiromo @seanhannity @johnrobertsFox Not one of the people in this lineup will do anything but agree with the conservative narrative.  Fox News isn’t news at all.  It’s obvious propaganda.  	What’s even more disappointing is that Fox viewers don’t care.  They should at least hear and consider opposing views.
@RepMarkMeadows Also...  I believe that we’re still waiting for the sanctions against Russia to be implemented.  Why don’t you ask any questions about that?
@RepMarkMeadows I could text that I want to rob a bank, but unless I actually do it...well...		 If he did anything to stop Trump, he’s totally inept.  Also, what would have happened had he leaked that Trump was under investigation?   		Are you really this dense?  I’m seriously asking.
@seanhannity It’s very easy to spot the tweets of people that only watch Fox News.
@townhallcom Just curious as to who really read the article and not just the headline.
@906reynolds @brontefan @ericbolling So you’re okay with kids in cages because Obama did it too?   Hillary is right.  We need to be better.
@BillOReilly I guess most of your followers don’t understand that children are STILL separated from their parents.  And, it’s not just the left that objected, or he never would’ve reversed his policy by signing an executive order.  I can’t believe there are some that think this is okay.  Sad!
@lhenrytimmins @DLoesch I object to his public insults and lack of civility.  I object that he has no public policy other than undo Obama.  I object to his demonstrably false lies.  I object that he governs by executive order;something he criticized Obama for.  I object to his lack of moral character.
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume Okay.... whatever man. What about the other things I mentioned?  And, I’ve noticed you won’t answer my original question.  I’m out.  Have a good day.
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume I read many outlets.  You still haven’t disputed anything I’ve said with anything of substance.
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume Are you really saying you don’t believe Trump has lied?
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume Explain to me which of those aren’t true
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume Seriously??  He said that crime in Germany is way up.  It’s not.  He said that people are smuggling shoes into Canada to get around tariffs.  There are no tariffs on shoes.   He said the US has a trade deficit with Canada.  Gov statistics show the opposite.  Just this week!!
@liuhath @Not4RightorLeft @brithume Do you care when the President lies to people?
@KBlasney @GMSarli @realDonaldTrump Yes.  I was replying to your comment about enforcing the law.  Is your position that it’s okay to selectively enforce the law, but only if it involves Americans?  What if it involves children?
@KBlasney @GMSarli @realDonaldTrump Then why is he pardoning people that have ADMITTED to breaking the law.  Why do they get special treatment, but children don’t?
@RepMarkMeadows Did y’all legislate the zero tolerance?   You’re intentionally misleading.  All Trump has to do is tell Sessions to stop the zero tolerance enforcement policy while congress legislates a solution.  	While you’re tweeting, families are being separated.  It’s on you.
@TomCottonAR You’ve told us what Dems want, so I ask you, what do Repubs want?  		It seems that you Repubs want to use family separation as a deterrent.  It’s been endorsed by the A.G. and the Chief of staff.  		I’ll choose the other side of this every time.  You should too.
RT @Whataburger: retweet this in 11 seconds 	                               to receive good news		somebody may even surprise you with Whata…
@USA_First_X @RoboChem @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @POTUS Two of those three hostages were taken during Trump’s administration. 		That’s why hostages are taken, btw.  So it appears that concessions are being made by releasing them.
@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Has Trump ever done anything you didn’t approve of?   What about wanting Russia in the G8?   Also, why do you think Trump still hasn’t implemented all of the Russian sanctions?  Serious questions... really want your explanation.
@DineshDSouza @PreetBharara No matter what you say, you broke the law... correct?   Just accept your pardon and be quiet
@RepPeteKing @nyjets Just wondering if you ever read the replies to your tweets?   Do you have the stones to reply to any of these very valid points?   I seriously doubt it.
@charliekirk11 Reasonable people can disagree.   When did disagreeing with someone start meaning they were worthy of vilification?   People that were mature enough to understand that you could disagree yet still try to find some common ground used to inhabit this country.   No more.
@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Just curious if you ever read any of the replies to your tweets?  Do you care at all	about finding the truth?
@FoxNews Trump is the current President, so there should be nothing wrong with imploring him to do something.  It’s kinda his job.  If he didn’t want that responsibility, he shouldn’t have run.   I’m also tired of Fox ALWAYS defending Trump
@chadfelixg @DLoesch The only thing anyone should be concerned about should be keeping any more children from being slaughtered at school.  I don’t see supporting her helping in any way. So I don’t really care.
@FightTheFascist @suzyd68 @ericbolling @trumps_feed He was there.
@suzyd68 @FightTheFascist @ericbolling @trumps_feed Google is your friend.  Don’t spout nonsense.
@seanhannity Can you let some of this crap go for just one day while people are mourning dead children?  I know that you have a show to do, but is it too much to ask to just ease up and stay off social media with that stuff?  It just does not seem important today.
@CalebJHull All of you making this about CNN just don’t get it and will sadly probably never get it.  How many more children have to die before anything is done? 	If one child dies of violence at school, that is too many.
@ericbolling Totally disingenuous to lump everyone that might have a different opinion In with this jackwagon.  Why would you do this? 	 I don’t expect an answer.
How do you know what Mueller has?  Seriously?   You could end up being right, but  how do you absolutely know what he has?  Please tell me
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis Russia influencing USA’s elections?  When has this happened before?  This isn’t about Democrat and Republican, though.  This is USA - Russia.  They are definitely bad actors and you blow it off???   I’m obviously not going to change your mind.  I’ll wait for Mueller.
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis Trump lost the popular vote.  If they influenced it at all, even if it was “soft” as you say, it could’ve changed the outcome.  You have no way of knowing how many people changed their votes.  How can you be so cavalier about a foreign government interfering with our election?
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis Do you even believe that Russia tried to influence the election?
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @RepDeSantis You only think it’s a nothing Burger because of what Jr. said in his testimony?   You don’t think he could be lying?   If it was nothing, why did they try to cover it up?   Remember the statement crafted on Air Force One, then Jr. changed his story?  Why are they acting guilty?
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepDeSantis Have you seen the IG report?    You’re aware of the meeting in Trump Tower?  I would think that would be enough to raise suspicion right there.  	I’ll wait for Mueller’s report as well.  If he didn’t do anything wrong, time will tell.
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepDeSantis How do you know that no crimes were committed?
@TimMags @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepDeSantis All that’s required to keep from committing perjury is tell the truth.  So you obviously would agree that the President has a problem with this.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepDeSantis Yes.  Americans want the truth.  Please encourage the President to sit down with the Special Counsel and testify.
@MZHemingway But it’s one of those things that if it had never been said, it would’ve never been leaked.  Don’t blame the leaker, blame the sayer.  And because it was said in a private meeting doesn’t make it any less revolting.  Decent people don’t say things like that.
@thetruthhurtscc @hippiepiper_rae @seanhannity That just shows how crooked the people he generally associates with are.  Not a good take, btw.  Don’t you expect that a Presidential candidate could at least hire non-criminals?  The expectations have really bottomed out with Trump.
@BillOReilly What we didn’t know, was the intense hatred HE’S been displaying towards the media.  And I would submit, the loathing and degradation of public discourse started with Trump.
@FoxNews I just wonder what people have against finding and prosecuting people that have broken the law?   It seems to me, that if you haven’t broken the law, you don’t have anything to worry about.   	And, I’ll echo some other comments.  The will of the people wasn’t Trump.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Anyway... thanks for the debate.  If my tone came off as confrontational, that’s not the way I meant it.   Have a good day.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump You can’t tell me that all of this doesn’t stink.   First Cohen says he pays out of his own pocket and says Trump didn’t know.  Then Guiliani says Trump reimbursed Cohen, even making a point to say it wasn’t from campaign finances. Then he says it was for unspecified ex?	Really??
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I didn’t misunderstand anything.  I heard him say it.  Guiliani realized he stepped in it, and then walked it back.	   If that’s what you want to hang your hat on, fine.   Our President is a liar with no moral compass, and you’re complicit.   Clinton was impeached btw.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump It’s what Trump’s lawyer(Guiliani) said in an interview.    He said that Trump reimbursed Cohen, using those words.  It’s all over the news.  I could really care less if you believe me.  Get back with m when you realize I’m right
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Watch Giuliani’s interviews on Fox News.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump I watched it last night and this morning.  Guiliani says Trump reimbursed Cohen 35k per month in 2017.... while he was President.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump According to Giuliani, Trump paid money to Cohen, who had paid Stormy previously, while he was President.		 I believe if Obama had done anything similar he would’ve been impeached before he could even explain.  I’m just tired of no one being willing to hold Trump accountable.
@225Kristen @SidneySD2012 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Years ago, I watched the Republicans with their pronouncements that Bill Clinton didn’t deserve the Presidency because of Lewinski.  Then, he lied under oath and they impeached him. 	I want the same standard applied to Trump.   Have him testify and see what happens.
@marklevinshow Is it just about winning for you, or do you care at all about the families that this affects?  	Do you want to deport these people to countries that they haven’t seen since they were probably too young to even remember?
@DineshDSouza You’re using someone with 5 followers as an example of the entire Democratic Party.   You can always find an extreme opinion on twitter, but you know this.   Nice!!!   And transparent.
@stranahan @SethAbramson I have seen and heard the President be more crass than some of the tweets I think you’re referring to.  As a Christian, do you support him?  	If so, that’s telling as well.  	I’m a Christian too and I’m really struggling with Christians that support a man that has no morals.
@ThePlumLineGS @philipaklein I can almost guarantee he won’t answer, or he won’t answer honestly.
@UrbanAchievr Remember when just being honest mattered?
@marklevinshow Do you believe our President has a problem telling the truth?   I’ll wager you won’t answer that question.  	He’s been in office 400 plus days and said over 3000 things that aren’t based in fact.  Some, just outright lies.  	Honest question - Why do you trust anything he says?
@LouDobbs That looks and sounds like a threat.   You can’t seriously consider yourself a journalist.   Are you advocating an active investigation to be impeded?	What are all of the innocent people so afraid of? @FBI @ FoxNews, This is getting out of hand.
@didntvote4eithr @ChrisCuomo Good.   I give him respect when he deserves it.  However, I honestly think he has no moral compass, and that scares me because of the decisions he might be forced to make someday.   I just don’t like the hypocrisy of some conservatives.
@bobbyrayfrankl2 @403_Forbidden @seanhannity I didn’t make any claim.  What are you talking about?
@didntvote4eithr @ChrisCuomo Have you publicly called out Trump for anything he’s said?
@bobbyrayfrankl2 @403_Forbidden @seanhannity If you’ll live by those rules too.  Don’t say anything unless you know the source.  Btw.  If the NYT has it, it’s a good source.
@wjmcgurn So.... who is to say what science is good and what science is bogus?  A lot of lives have been saved because of good science.  Just like you, things on this earth are never perfect, and yet you want to point to the bad just to make your own point.
@didntvote4eithr @ChrisCuomo That’s not what he’s saying at all.  He’s saying it’s hypocritical to call the comedian out if you haven’t called Trump out.  In this case Schlapp is on a high horse he has no right to be on.
@drlamb97 @jakewirth6 @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I saw it with my eyes and heard it with my ears.  He was mocking him.  Just because you’ve bought in to the way his campaign spun it doesn’t make it not so.  It’s people like you that won’t hold him accountable that are part of the problem.
@FoxNews @edhenry Normally I would agree, but what she got was tame compared to some stuff our President has said about people.  He started this era of non civil discourse.  If the President isn’t called out for his statements on your network, then you can’t really complain about SHS treatment.
@ConnieDWeeZ @maggieNYT My mistake if that’s the way you meant it.  I took it as slang.   Please don’t believe everything you read on the internet.   I would be very skeptical of stuff on qanon.  	You really don’t know what standards journalists like her have to meet, do you?
@ConnieDWeeZ @maggieNYT Talking to
@ConnieDWeeZ @maggieNYT Read her reply again.   She said he “has no idea who WE ARE alking to”.  As in he doesn’t know her source.  	BTW... A bible verse in your twitter name and calling someone a tool in the tweet.  Nice.
@marklevinshow @FoxNews You guys really need to get this guy off the air.  He seems legit cray.  Tweets like this border on inciting violence.  Read the comments.  See for yourself.   Plus, what’s the end game?  In his scenario, how does power change hands? Isn’t that what a real coup is?
@LouDobbs What are all of the innocent people so afraid of?
@Bruce_LeVell @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @jasoninthehouse You weren’t there on the day jr. met with one then.
@JackPosobiec Where are you getting this information?  I would like to verify for myself.
@RepMarkMeadows Ask the President to release his tax returns.  I’ll wager it’s not so empty then.
@JanLange15 @RepMarkMeadows America, based on the popular vote, wanted Hillary to be the president, so I don’t think you can really say “America” wants all of those things.  This American wants anyone that’s broken the law, Trump included, to be punished.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I watched CNN this morning, and they made sure to give Trump most of the credit for North Korea.  They gave much credit, several times.  Did any of you even watch?
@AnnCoulter Where’s the original quote?   Is there audio?   Just wondering how they got it so wrong?
@RepMarkMeadows Saying that claim is well-debunked is disingenuous at best.  A Republican did initiate the dossier.
@marklevinshow I’ve seen you, Trump, and Trump’s followers say that Hillary should be in prison.  So yes, I guess that is the new standard, on both sides.   I guess you just don’t like it when the no due process shoe is on the other foot.
@LouDobbs Your poll are ridiculous - worded with bias to get a biased reaction - but I think you know this.  Once again... Fox News not really being a News outlet.  Y’all really should change the name of your organization.
@THEHermanCain This is truly fake news.  I live in Arkansas and I saw the reports.
@larryelder @BarackObama Trump criticized Obama for his golfing.  Now Trump plays more than Obama ever did.  Trump also spends tax payer $ at his own golf properties!  He’s literally paying himself to golf.  You’re okay with this?
@SebGorka @BBCJamesCook @BBC Trump came in second place in the popular vote.  I wish he would’ve “lost”.
@marklevinshow Not the same thing, but fine.  If you think Chuck Todd should be punished, there’s no logical way you can believe Hannity shouldn’t.   Fire anyone that doesn’t disclose.  Have any of your relatives ever worked on a campaign?
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump You have less than zero credibility.   This is not how someone that works for a news organization should act.
@NoleAlum83 @marklevinshow First.:. It’s defamation.  Second... he’s a lawyer.   I’m pretty sure he would know if what he’s saying is defamatory. He’s a pretty astute individual, it seems to me.
@marklevinshow Are you saying that you don’t believe Hannity’s account of their relationship?
@FoxNews So tired of Fox News.
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @KeithRothfus If the President has nothing to hide, why does it need to be shut down?
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump I’m going to repeat one of the comments on here, but WHY are the Rs afraid of this investigation?   Why are you personally afraid of this investigation?  Let it play out.   If there’s nothing there,  you can say I told you so.
@RepTomRice This just shows how much things still need to change.  Of course employees are happy with $1000, but that’ll be gone in a couple of weeks.  Meanwhile, this tax cut package goes on for years.  Companies should do much better by their employees.  Still #crumbs
@BillOReilly You’re pretending you don’t know how this works.  By doing so, you blatantly trick people, thus protecting Trump.  Why?	Comey is the one “smearing” the President.   The media is reporting what he said.  It’s a first hand account.  The audience is free to believe or not.
@PastorKelly822 @DonnaLfromNY @TuckerCarlson @Sears @Swiffer @CharlesSchwab @KelloggsUS @AAAnews @SUBWAY @Bounty @HomeDepot @comcast Are you really that dense that you don’t understand that Kimmel was saying?   I honestly find that hard to believe, but then again, not much surprises me about ridiculous arguments that some people are willing to make.
@steveblake01 @marklevinshow That should tell you something. If a FOX reporter asks questions that make a Trump cabinet member look bad, something is definitely up.
@MannyNeva77 @CoachMason33 @JayBilas I do agree with this.  Everyone makes money but the players and that isn’t fair.  In a perfect world the NCAA shouldn’t profit either, but that’s not realistic.  The big money has definitely done a number on college athletics, and I hate that.
@MannyNeva77 @CoachMason33 @JayBilas This isn’t corporate America.   It’s amateur athletics.  And a full scholarship isn’t cheap.  Probably around 100 grand, give or take.
@JayBilas @CoachMason33 I’m not necessarily against college athletes profiting, but rich donors agreeing to buy a stated amount of the top athletes’ merchandise just for signing with that school... Recruiting would literally be who could pay the most.  That’s really a direction y’all wanna go?
@CoachMason33 @JayBilas But that’s only a relatively few athletes that would be able to profit.  Would the center be okay with the star QB banking, while he’s struggling to pay rent?  What about the female athletes?  I think paying just opens up a whole can of worms?
@JayBilas If some athletes are paid, wouldn’t that mean that all athletes-men and women-should be paid, unless you want to invite lawsuits?  I think that’s where the question of whether there would be enough revenue comes in.  Would the “haves” be willing to share with the “have nots”?
@BillOReilly The fact still remains that nothing would’ve happened- no boycott, no retweet, no lost money- had she not tweeted something that a lot of people agree was off limits, and something that she later apologized for.  Not right to say it like they started it.
@BillOReilly You, and the network that used to employ you, have done more to contribute to the degradation of journalism in this country than anything.  I FIRMLY believe this.
@marklevinshow Did the shooter (bad guy) have an AR-15?
@marklevinshow Our President has called U.S. citizens this publicly.
@BillOReilly I’m seriously tired of all of the partisan accusations.  We should want EVERYONE that’s been involved in illegal activity out of the picture, whether they’re  Republican or Democrat.
@KayaJones Screw all of the stupid politics.  Can you not agree that if these students walking out saves one child’s life in the future that it would be worth it?   I know I would do anything to save one of my children.
@IngrahamAngle @ConorLambPA @TomCottonAR We need more people toward the center politically.  That would benefit us all by letting us find more common ground.   There shouldn’t be all encompassing prerequisite values when choosing a party.
@marklevinshow It doesn’t spin anything.  The article plainly says you won in total viewers.  And... it IS a CNN win in the demographic most prized by advertisers.   I guarantee if you had won that demo, you would be touting that fact.  I know the people selling your advertising would.
@BillOReilly This is the problem with people like you.  You so want to place the blame somewhere other than where it really belongs.    If these women bring Trump down, IT’S HIS FAULT! 	 It’s not the media that had sex with a pornstar and cheated on Melania.  Quit making excuses for him!
@Broach972 @marklevinshow It’s just easier to shout “fake news” and throw out insults.   They have nothing.
@greta I agree!  Once again, two words...Fox News
@maggieNYT You folks that are parroting the fake news mantra need to understand what you’re doing.  You’re letting the government off the hook for any unfavorable story.  I can assure you, you DON’T want a government that’s not accountable to the people.
@greta By that definition 90% of programming on Fox News is fake.  Correct?
@MichaelCohen212 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You only didn’t see it on the other networks because you apparently weren’t watching the other networks.  This is simply not true.  Is there anyone associated with Trump that won’t lie?
@greta People like you criticizing and not defending your peers doesn’t help the public perception.  Why does the criticism always seem to be leveled at cnn and msnbc and never Fox?  I think Fox has contributed more than any other media outlet to the public distrust of the media.
@RepMattGaetz I’m all for finding EVERY corrupt politician and punishing them... Democrat as well as Republican.  Are you up for that too?  	If you’re not, you need to resign.
@SenTomCotton Please uphold the sanctions against Russia that CONGRESS VOTED FOR!  It’s disingenuous to tweet about being concerned about China when you’ve done nothing about Russia.
@dbongino Better than FOX (state tv) any day.
@greta I’m glad that CNN will call FOX News out.  I honestly think that FOX shoulders much of the blame for the hyper-partisan attitudes of many people.  I live in a red state and many of the otherwise smart and good people I know that watch FOX are deliberately being misled.
@JesseBWatters So put it out there on the air.   List the scandals without pussyfooting around.  Don’t say alleged, or allegedly... say this is what he did and show the proof.
@BillOReilly @NoSpinNews Have you been spinning for so long that you actually don’t realize you’re doing it anymore?   I don’t trust a word you say (spin).
@greta Ivanka didn’t have to accept the job she has now.  If she wasn’t an adviser to the President, I would say the question is definitely out of bounds. But, it was her choice to accept the job, so questions about the sexual behavior of her boss are uncomfortable but fair.
@dpshow @JayBilas If you pay one athlete, you’ll have to pay them all. That’s fair.  Smaller schools that have athletic programs that are in the red anyway, will struggle mightily to do this, I would guess.   	A free college education ain’t that bad of a reimbursement.  I’m still paying off loans.
@CaseyCagle @Delta @NRA @wsbtv     You might want to follow up on this.
@dbongino Put yourself for a moment in the head of a victim.  Do you want the violent criminal armed or unarmed.  See... I can do it to.  Why can’t we keep the weapons out of the hands of violent criminals?  What is wrong with beginning discussions there?
@IngrahamAngle @BreitbartNews What’s wrong with having a policy debate about why mass shootings keep occurring?   I have school age children.  If it were possible that a policy change might save their life...  show me a parent that wouldn’t want to, at the very least, have a discussion about it.
@SpeakerRyan @POTUS I’m seriously beginning to wonder about the GOP.  I can see what might happen in 2020.   Trump loses while Russian meddles, then won’t accept the results of the election because he says they’re tainted.   Is this the grand plan to keep the republicans in power.  Sanction Russia.
