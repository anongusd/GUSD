@RepTedLieu @POTUS Most Americans no longer feel the FBI or the CIA or even NSA are trusted sources... too many issues with all of these agencies!
@davidmweissman We answer because you offend us true Trump supporters. I hate pretenders and thats what you are doing! You are on the left, so just embrace it!
I totally agree and think they are already stalling to try and get it to the timeframe when Obamas last SCOTUS pick got ignored! https://t.co/y4vL7qXKiL
@RealJamesWoods Flake couldn't win a national election for dog catcher!
@RealJamesWoods I guess they should have tried " fair and unbiased " reporting to see if that would have increased sales! People get tired of reading BS and lies every day!
@SenatorCollins We can't give in to the Democrats since they refuse to negotiate at all about the wall and you know its because of President Trump and not the wall.
@SenatorCollins As soon as Nancy and Chuck negotiate, including money for the wall. Until then I hope our President keeps it shut down.
@davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Stop offending us true Trump supporters by claiming you were one at one time. Be honest!!
@davidmweissman @realDonaldTrump Why did all but 6 of the democrats vote against the bill to pay the workers on shutdown for their first check of the new year? Because they could care less about the workers or any of us. It's all about stopping President Trump's promise!
Also, if the Democrats truly cared about Americans getting pay checks why did all of them except for 6 vote against paying the workers even though we have a shutdown?
BS! The Democrats have shown on numerous occasions they could care less about border security. The one and only reason they won't give the money is because it means President Trump honored his promise and the Left can't have that! https://t.co/mDYQB7i6bP
