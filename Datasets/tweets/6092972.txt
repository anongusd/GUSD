This is just another example of #TheBabyTrump refusing to admit he was wrong, making it all about himself, and stepping on the legitimate feelings and concerns of the people (Warmbier and his parents) who are the actual victims. #sad
And instead of apologizing to Warmbier's parents about him taking murderous dictator Kim Jong Un's word on the matter, Trump focuses on denying he said anything wrong, that it is our fault for misinterpreting him, and that Trump, himself, is the hero of this story for saving him.
And notice that @realDonaldTrump won't even call what happened to Warmbier "torture." He calls it "mistreatment." Talk about sanitizing the whole thing. He is still yielding deference to the murderous dictator Kim Jong Un.
This tweet from Trump really #jumpstheshark. He claims he loves Warmbier, a man he never met, and that he thinks of him often. And all of this in the context of him saying he takes Kim Jong Un at his word that he didn't know about Warmbier being tortured, causing his death. https://t.co/HIumfn4GRv
WHAT A COLOSSAL LOAD OF CRAP	‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© says his remarks on Warmbier were 'misinterpreted.‚Äô Not only were they not misinterpreted, it seems Trump is more concerned about getting credit for Warmbier‚Äôs release than apologizing to his parents. https://t.co/ne0wfuibv8

@shallowhunt Exactly who are you talking to? My "chosen one"? Do you know who I voted for in the primary? If you do, should you be arrested for hacking that info? And, if you mean HRC, she did get 6 million more votes than her opponent, so who rigged the election for who? So many questions.

For example, the crackdown on sex workers on #CraigsList or #BackPages. By forcing those companies to shutdown that content 1) sex workers were forced back to the streets, where it is much more dangerous &amp; 2) law enforcement lost access to useful intelligence for investigations.
But it is foolish to lay all, or even most, of the blame for #fakenews on @Facebook or other social network company.		Lawmakers must be smart about their proposals to address the threat of disinformation campaigns.
#FakeNews is a serious problem that requires a lot of responses, including fact-checking, regulations, improved media and info literacy, more tech and staff to catch it by socmed companies, legal consequences for running fake news operations, etc.

@MerrittIUfan82 @blackwelljohn1 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA Protesting is never something we get permission to do, it is something we have the right to do. And we do it when we believe the cause is just and in our most effective manner.
@MerrittIUfan82 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA Since some religions (including my own) believe life begins at birth and that until birth the pregnancy can be terminated for physical &amp; mental health reasons (with a Rabbi's sanction) it would be God who said it was OK.		#1stAmendment protects those beliefs.
@MerrittIUfan82 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA No. @PPFA raises money separately through its Action Fund (501(c)4) to advocate for its agenda. It is a separate organization from the clinics that get federal funding and completely compliant with the law. Again, there is a lot of #fakenews out there about Planned Parenthood.
@MerrittIUfan82 @blackwelljohn1 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA Let's be clear, #TakingaKnee doesn't add time to the game, nor distract from the game. And since the players are employed by NFL owners, not the fans in the stadium, the decision to allow them is between them, not you.
@MerrittIUfan82 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA @PPFA did not screw up. There is a lot of #fakenews claiming they did, but a simple google search or search on a fact-checking site will give you the truth. https://t.co/qwMx6W8Xu7
@MerrittIUfan82 @realDonaldTrump @PPFA No... none of the money is used for abortions. That is strictly regulated. And @PPFA has always been certain not to use it that way because it never wants to risk losing the funding. That seems incredibly logical, as well as being true.
@MerrittIUfan82 @blackwelljohn1 @realDonaldTrump If you are doing nothing wrong, then the protest is not about you. Lots of people protest things only some people do. I am sure you never performed an abortion, nor helped you GF/wife to get one. But I doubt you object to protests outside of @PPFA clinics.
@MerrittIUfan82 @realDonaldTrump Congress gives money to @PPFA to support its women's health clinics... specifically the health care they provide that is not abortion. In MANY communities across the country, Planned Parenthood clinics are the ONLY healthcare clinics. You don't think that is worth funding?

What is the right balance between the perpetual campaign and the responsibilities of governing? And how does social media affect that balance?		I don't know the answers yet, but I suspect some of you have ideas about the question that might help.		#24hourScrutinyCycle
I don't think we're talking about a clean pivot from social campaigning to social governing. You can't put that genie back in the bottle. The perpetual campaign may be the norm, but governing is the job, So what is the right campaigning/governing balance? #24hourScrutinyCycle
Clearly @AOC has amazing starpower. And social media is a big part of that. But up to now, her social media presence is being driven by a campaign mentality. Now she also has governing responsibilities. And those are different.
There is also a political side to the #24hourScrutinyCycle, and that figures prominently into the narrative about @AOC's relationship with her Democratic colleagues. This is uncharted territory, even with Trump's experiences of the past 2 years.
More recently, the courts ruled similarly with respect to all social media accounts of elected officials. Their social media channels are governed by the 1st Amend. That is the legal side of the #24hourScrutinyCycle.
But Trump's campaign mentality on social media has compromised his ability to govern on several occasions. Courts have ruled his accounts are public forums, therefore governed by the 1st Amend. Blocking people is not allowed &amp; posts are official statements. #24hourScrutinyCycle
With the #24hourScrutinyCycle, we see into politicians lives and minds every day. And we see the public reaction to it constantly, throughout the day. That environment allows Trump to change the news narrative with just a tweet in the middle of the night.
When Bill Clinton won the Presidency in 1992, he kept his campaign operation going throughout the in between years, to some degree, ushering in the age of the #perpetualcampaign. But that was before social media, before the #24hourScrutinyCycle.
Now we see the challenge working its way down the ticket to Congress. @AOC and @BetoORourke are the 2 most striking examples, each dealing with their social media campaign stardom and the pivot to governing in different ways. https://t.co/G7kBKNvzpf
The challenge of moving from tech campaigning to tech governing still looms large. In 2008, Obama faced this challenge, as did Trump in 2016. In these cases we saw what it looks like to pivot from campaigning to governing and what not pivoting looks like.

@Boboskiwatnot @SenateGOP @TeamPelosi Sure, abortion is legal. 	My religion says that pregnancy can be terminated up until birth (in the 1st 40 days without a rabbi's sanction, after that for health reasons with rabbi's sanction). Life does not begin until birth. 	So don't force your religion on me. #1stAmend

Tip O‚ÄôNeil said all politics is local. I once wrote that all virtual politics is virtually local. The inevitable march of social media in politics is the growing expectation among voters that they see real evidence of their candidate‚Äôs authenticity. That is the new bar.
Trump‚Äôs apparent authenticity on Twitter is actually rather one dimensional. It hides what he is doing behind the scenes. That type of ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù is shallow, at best, and won‚Äôt cut it against opponents that meld their whole lives into the political process.
Will Trump ever be able to compete with the daily life video interactions presented by AOC or Beto? Can you imagine Trump live streaming mealtime with his family? If he did so, the facade that he is just like all of us would melt away like fat on bacon in a skillet.
The nature of the digital presence needed to win a presidential nomination has evolved. Where Trump‚Äôs authenticity won the day in 2016, the new era is far more personal. It is not enough to tweet your mind, people want to see you being a normal human being, just like they are.
"The digital front-runner is going to win the nomination. That goes to both fundraising and it goes to content delivery."		This should be no surprise. It is the reason Trump won the nomination in 2016. It is a big reason Obama won it in 2008.  https://t.co/40HpzN2itD

@DMDorey @GlennMorin10 I know... I have a long history of my RB getting injured. So I stocked up on them this year. Also have Kerryon on the bench.
@DMDorey @GlennMorin10 Thanks, as always, for your help.
@GlennMorin10 @DMDorey I think that is where I am. This is my lineup:	Mahomes	Elliot	Carson	Edelman	Ty Hill	Amari Cooper	Ty Boyd	NE Def	Maher (though I also have Boswell)
@GlennMorin10 @DMDorey And Ware just got downgraded to doubtful!
@GlennMorin10 @DMDorey So you are saying I should go with Carson? I love Seattle's commitment to the running game. And he looked sharp against Minnesota, especially in tennis ball yellow.
@DMDorey @GlennMorin10 I see that both of you totally get my angst. Ware didn't practice yesterday and is in a committee of sorts (though he kicked ass last week), Carson looks great and Martin has a great matchup.
@GlennMorin10 @DMDorey Obviously Zeke and one of those two. But Martin has a great matchup and is on some start lists this week. I know David's predictions for all three (Carson, Ware &amp; Martin) are pretty close. Hence my challenge.

So please, @thedailybeast, when you report how Fox News hosts act like an arm of the Republican Party and staff of Trump Administration, it is because they are allowed to by contract. It is because they are entertainers, not journalists.
We should not be surprised that Bill Shine got a $3.5 million bonus and stock shares from @FoxNews  WHILE HE WAS WORKING FOR THE @WHITEHOUSE as Deputy Communications Director. https://t.co/jfPcSK1k50
But the morning and primetime hosts on @FoxNews do not work for the Fox News News Division (where Shep Smith works). They are entertainment HOSTS. They are free to lie. They are free to endorse candidates and parties. These are not things journalists are allowed to do.
We should not be surprised when @FoxandFriends gives EPA Admin Pruitt interview questions in advance. We should not be surprised when @seanhannity appears on stage at a Trump rally or donates $ to a candidate. These are things journalists would NEVER do.
Dear @thedailybeast (and other news media outlets), please clearly educate the American people that @foxandfriends, @seanhannity @JudgeJeanine &amp; @TuckerCarlson are NOT journalists. They have entertainer contracts. They are not bound by journalistic ethics rules. https://t.co/hSUmFk512F

And then @realDonaldTrump gets angry at the companies he's hurting for tightening their belts. 	Remember when Republicans thought government interference in business decisions was evil? Now they support a president that not only interferes, but does so like a #stupidbullygenius.
Trump is so ignorant of how the economy works that he creates policies that cause serious short-term losses for companies that they cannot endure in order to create long-term gains they won't be around to enjoy. #StupidBullyGenius

But I agree, the press should talk about #taxexpenditures along with government spending. The public needs to understand the implications of the policies being promoted. They need to know who benefits, who suffers, how much it costs and how it will be paid for.
Democrats look for ways to pay for things that need doing. Republicans look for ways to justify doing less for people, so they cut taxes and then say, "oh look, we cannot afford #socialSecurity, #Medicare and #Mdeicaid anymore. Hence the original comic I posted. https://t.co/vkAATgxpvY
For Democrats, they are always looking for policies that help the people who need help the most. Calling #taxcredits #taxexpenditures opens the door to criticism from #deficithawks. But these days, the hawks don't seem to apply their criticisms towards their own policies.
For Republicans who used to care so much about deficits, talking about #taxcuts as #taxexpenditures undermine their core beliefs (these days, Trump has freed Republicans from caring about deficits and debt).
The notion of #TaxExpenditures is crucial, as it points to how #taxcuts, #taxcredits, etc. are government spending when netted out at the bottom line. The contextual implications affect both Republican and Democratic favored policies. https://t.co/g1OFUdUo7j

Goal before New Congress in January is to educate journalists to clearly distinguish PACs from SuperPACs. #nabpac2018
SuperPACs remain a challenge. On one hand, they are not transparent. On the other hand, PAC champion Mitch McConnell likes them. #nabpac2018
Messages being tested: ‚ÄúPAC money is the cleanest money in politics‚Äù because it is transparent as bipartisan. Also, business PAC contributions come from the employees of the company, not the company. #nabpac2018
Much of the battle over PACs and Campaign Finance Reform will take place on Twitter in ‚Äú140 characters or less,‚Äù says panelist at #nabpac2018.
2020 Senate election map is much less favorable to Republicans than 2018. #nabpac2018
Mitch McConnell is the greatest champion of business PACs. #nabpac2018
The sides are shaping up to be those who take PAC money vs those who take only grassroots money. But there is less focus on defining what PACs count in this split. #nabpac2018
In the history of the House, the number of women ever elected would not even fill the chamber.  #nabpac2018
Hearing lots of high praise for the new, younger members of Congress. Diverse, young and new to lawmaking, this Congress will be different. #nabpac2018
HR1 will be a collection of a lot of campaign finance reform proposals. House Admin Committee will be front and center in the effort to pass this bill. #nabpac2018
But below the top 3 there is likely to be a lot of changes in Democratic leadership... younger and diverse.  #nabpac2018
While Rep. Moulton is collecting signatures opposing Pelosi as Speaker, she has no opponent. Panelist predicts that I t is most likely that the top 3 leaders will remain the same. #nabpac2018
Panelist says new group of lawmakers are ‚Äúno shrinking violets‚Äù and will be ‚Äúdisrupters‚Äù (but not necessarily in a bad way). #nabpac2018
New efforts to change the public narrative around corporate PACs emerging. Also to educate Congress.  #nabpac2018
PACs are being branded as #darkmoney. But PACs actually report all donors to FEC. This separates them from SuperPACs. #nabpac2018
138 incumbents took anti-corporate PAC pledge (9 Senators). Most of these Members won. This is the beginning of an expected trend.  #nabpac2018
Current challenge for the NABPAC community is rising public anti-PAC sentiment. #nabpac2018
CPA-Zicklin Index is a growing method for classifying the levels of political activity of companies. https://t.co/Sy7OT3FkEr  #nabpac2018
State efforts to pass campaign finance reform referenda is seen as a way to change public sentiment about these laws (both sides seem to be seizing this opportunity). #nabpac2018
Half of the states are considering campaign finance reform and limits on foreign companies from giving political money legislation. #nabpac2018
The current DISCLOSE Act (S.1585) redefines a ‚Äúforeign national‚Äù company. Companies that are 20% or more foreign owned would be prohibited from having PACs.    #nabpac2018
We are listening to a history of NABPAC‚Äôs efforts to reduce restrictions on PACs. #nabpac2018
Mitch McConnell, years ago, introduced bills to limit PACs. Then, in 1997 he was persuaded to take the opposite approach, in part due to lobbying by NABPAC. #nabpac2018
FYI... this is a panel on challenging the narrative &amp; opening minds: PACs &amp; 116th Congress.  #nabpac2018
HISTORY OF PACs: 1904 Tillman Act banned corporations from directly contributing money to political candidates. Shortly after PACs were born.  #nabpac2018

@IQtrivia I think that would be my grandfather's good friend and colleague Elliot Richardson (May 25, 1973 ‚Äì October 20, 1973).
@bobpulgino @Mahogany1992 @fdjordanjr I understand that. The question I posed is that, under the Federal Vacancies Act, does the interim replacement have to be someone who was previously confirmed by the Senate (as Rosenstein was and Whitaker was not)?
Let's be clear, Trump fired Sessions. This charade that he resigned is pure fiction. Sessions' own resignation letter stipulates his resignation was at Trump's request. 	This has implications for the Federal Vacancies Act &amp; obstruction of justice concerns. https://t.co/3orc1nSjjY
@BitchyPundit @adonvski I hear you on that. We should definitely pay attention and figure out how to effectively reconnect with people that Trump has pulled in. To begin with, we need to systematically listen to what they are saying instead of talking at them.
@joanne_mulenex Whitaker is Acting AG. Trump has not said if he plans to nominate him. Then he must be confirmed. The question is can a non-confirmed DOJ staff be named Acting AG? Federal Vacancies Act says senior official within dept or a confirmed official from other dept can serve as Acting.

Whitaker is on record as being critical of the Mueller investigation. So Trump's unconventional, and possibly illegal, decision to bypass Rosenstein to name Sessions' C of Staff the Acting AG is extremely controversial.
The Acting AG would normally be Rod Rosenstein, the next in line at DOJ. But Trump sidestepped him to name Sessions' Chief of Staff as the Acting AG. The Chief of Staff is NOT a Senate confirmed position and does not appear on the DOJ org chart. https://t.co/MJNQvyDc4P https://t.co/MwGwwi4oCu

If Trump is really committed to leading our country away from rising domestic political violence &amp; division, he needs to stop promoting Russian anti-American bot campaigns and he needs to stop using the insulting ‚ÄúDemocrat Party‚Äù slur when referring to the Democratic Party.
BREAKING: 15 min before tweeting concerns about the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, Trump promoted an anti-Democratic Party event with the #WalkAway hashtag a Russian bot campaign used to divide our country. He also used the ‚ÄúDemocrat Party‚Äù slur. https://t.co/tASdCSdZ7a https://t.co/9dOW39i8Fz

@TheMiddleMan19 Your fixation on TV news when I asked if you read news sources you may not agree with is concerning. There are many more non-TV sources of news than TV sources. And, of course, ‚Äúall generalizations are false,‚Äù so your condemnation of all TV news is doubly concerning.
Is this switch in Trump‚Äôs twitter endorsement strategy a tacit admission that his incendiary comments about Democrats and his critics is enabling and encouraging threats of violence against them by his supporters?
Before all these pipe bombs were mailed to his critics, @realDonaldTrump would often tweet terrible exaggerations &amp; lies about Democratic opponents to Republicans he was endorsing. Since the mailing of these bombs, Trump has stopped the negative comments. https://t.co/8unja0QPt3

@I_am_Rooster @BunnyFenton @inglamwetrust @realDonaldTrump @CNN What you have heard is not fact. This march happens every year, seasonally. They are people fleeing political/gang violence in their countries, hoping for asylum in the US. Only Trump &amp; Fox‚Äôs rhetoric have painted them otherwise.
@skullaria @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I think the analysis showed in 2012 that no matter who won, Obama or Romney, that job growth was projected to be the same. And the same was true in 2008 and 2016. Look at the research. It is pretty clear that job growth depends on way more things than a President can do.

@TheMiddleMan19 @realDonaldTrump Don‚Äôt confuse calls for protest to threats of violence. Don‚Äôt take the comments of those you have accused of threatening out of context.
