Remember to use #condoms for any form of sex to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Look after your sexual health! 		#WorldCondomDay	#ValentinesDay https://t.co/j3iVCDoXuP
#Condom availability makes sexual activity safer, rather than increases sexual activity.		#WorldCondomDay	#InternationalCondomDay 		📷:@UNAIDS https://t.co/svmu3AJ95W
IF A #CONDOM BREAKS 😱	When emergency contraception is not accessible, immediately insert a spermicide (other than Nonoxynol-9) into the vagina, if available.	Also, wash both penis and the outside part of vagina with soap and water. This should reduce the risk of STIs, pregnancy https://t.co/JLtDICr5uw
Avoid using #condoms that are expired - see manufacturing or expiry date on the package.		Do NOT use a latex condom more than 5 years old, it’s expired and may break during use 		#WorldCondomDay	#InternationalCondomDay 		📷:@UNAIDS https://t.co/5XE0Q2qlrn
Male and female #condoms cannot get lodged inside the uterus, nor do they have any harmful effects on a foetus if the woman is pregnant. The opening to the cervix is far too small to allow a condom to pass through		#WorldCondomDay	#InternationalCondomDay https://t.co/nJVrXZwTLE
Sexual stimulation can be enhanced when a man allows their partner to put the #condom on him prior to sexual intercourse		#WorldCondomDay #InternationalCondomDay https://t.co/ntUoaBjXmz
Non-lubricated #condoms increase risk of HIV/STIs because they are more likely to tear and they can cause lesions on the vaginal wall		#WorldCondomDay #InternationalCondomDay https://t.co/wkFEr1Xmf9
WHO recommends that #condoms with Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) spermicidal treatment no longer be promoted due to adverse side effects.	N-9 does not provide extra protection against HIV/STI, instead it actually increases the risk of HIV infection when used frequently by high risk women https://t.co/AkyAUMrHZY
AVOID oil-based lubricants such as petroleum jelly, hand lotion, baby oil, or edible oils.	These weaken latex #condoms and make them more prone to breakage, therefore making them less effective.		#WorldCondomDay #InternationalCondomDay 		📷:@epaphotos https://t.co/4HDvJaQxg8
#Condom effectiveness depends on user behaviour in opening the package, putting on the condom, type of sexual activity, lubrication, and number of times an individual condom is used.	Condoms are designed for single use only.		#WorldCondomDay https://t.co/Nx3tHC9ptI

Before visiting the clinic, Francesca faced stigma in the community and had been told that she couldn’t give birth because of her #epilepsy.	Now - after being prescribed anti-seizure medication, she and her husband have two healthy children https://t.co/1TjcusK4jt #EpilepsyDay https://t.co/LihnRvD6vV
#Epilepsy is one of the world’s oldest recognized conditions, with written records dating back to 4000 BC.	Fear, misunderstanding, discrimination and social stigma have surrounded epilepsy for centuries https://t.co/BAV5WFD3Hd #EpilepsyDay https://t.co/qFJ1mUUkKG

70% of people living with #epilepsy could live seizure-free if properly diagnosed and treated https://t.co/BAV5WFD3Hd #EpilepsyDay https://t.co/1NDpsopg9I
#Epilepsy is a disease of the brain that affects people of all ages.	It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are brief episodes of involuntary movement that may involve a part of the body or the entire body https://t.co/BAV5WFD3Hd #EpilepsyDay https://t.co/G4W1KExv3H

#HappyNewYear2019 		Do you have healthy resolutions?		Here are 12 tips to be healthy in 2019.		https://t.co/crF6gAgSQW
Get needed support!	It needs to be someone you trust &amp; feel comfortable with:	-Your partner	-Friend	-Relative	-Someone at work	-Nurse	-Counselor	-Doctor	It is important that your supporter does not have a problem with substance use at the same time as trying to help you. https://t.co/7n0yRoWLD0
REMEMBER: It is possible to change substance use behavior, many people have done it! https://t.co/rxCrGQrdTu https://t.co/xisB6PJSXO
Your substance use diary and your problems relating to substance use can help you make a decision to change your behavior. To help you make up your mind, do the following three tasks: https://t.co/zSoQiGWJgn
Are you concerned about your substance use?	Go back over the week a day at a time &amp; write down the information for each day:	-Time &amp; place	-Who you were with	-What you were using	-How much you had	-How much you spent	It will help you to see how much you used in the last week. https://t.co/oIv81qCfrv
Using substances by injection can cause serious health problems no matter which substance is injected, such as: #HIV, #Hepatitis B and C. People who inject drugs have a higher risk of the substance dependence. https://t.co/rxCrGQrdTu https://t.co/VGeXIq3q4X
Different substances have different harms &amp; risks.	The risk of experiencing problems can vary from individual to individual and depends on:	-Your environment	-How much you use	-The way you use	-Your age	-Gender	https://t.co/rxCrGQrdTu https://t.co/Mfa9hDYHi4
Think about what substance(s) you use &amp; the problems you think it might be causing. Some people find that using substances can cause several problems:	-Arguments with family or partner	-Sleeping disorders	-Feeling depressed, anxious or agitated	-Lack of memory &amp; concentration https://t.co/o9NICGY2SF
How do you know if you are at risk of substance abuse? If you use:	-Cannabis	-Cocaine	-Amphetamine-type stimulants (incl. ecstasy &amp; methamphetamine)	-Inhalants	-Non prescribed sedatives or sleeping pills	-Hallucinogens	-Opioids	https://t.co/rxCrGQrdTu
