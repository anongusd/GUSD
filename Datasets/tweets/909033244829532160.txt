@latimes @mattb0401 if you think the US-Russian space collaboration has been a model post-Cold War relations, you are sadly mistaken and misinformed.
@HuffPost The fact that is trend is a thing is no big deal.  The disturbing part is that people feel compelled that every little bit of their personal lives is sharable content. 		The obsessive need for attention is what is disturbing		#IDC #IDontCare #DesperateGeneration #LookAtMeLookAtMe

@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand These are true feminist actions. Doing our best to take care of ourselves &amp; others in an empowered way.  The most control we have is over ourselves. Check the fantasy at the door.
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand If u want to address rape culture, address it in our entertainment: movies, video games, porn. These visual images &amp; situations being played out &amp; populated into youthful brains. Plus, it would be good to give up Disney princess movies. No prince is coming. Get reAl &amp; take care
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand Coming out of the woodwork 36 ys later.... not the solution.
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand If u want to solve this problem, the number 1 thing to be done is to educate &amp; empower women.  How to do self-care. To have wise discernment &amp; not trust everyone cuz the flash a smile.  Learn self-defence &amp; practice it. &amp; express yourself in a timely manner. All learnable.
@thehill Hey you silly silly Americans. This is part of the checka and balances to the American system do de-politicize the judicial branch as much as possible.  #AmericaTakeAHistoryLesson #RelaxEverythingIsOK
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand ...and thats the exactly problem here. Your (and others) inability to separate your personal experience from a completely differently reality that you were not even involved in. Were u even alive in 1983? Kavanaugh hearing is not about you. #SupportWomensRightToBeRational
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand Did you know a  in MA Clinical psych requires counseling for oneself? As she describes it, it is a groping incident. I can use my https://t.co/MqSnYpJlgf dont get to dictate my words. Sorry for what happened to you. Blasey is not u &amp; u r not Her. Kavanaugh hearing wasnt abt you.
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand There is NOTHING that she said that isnt found in Mark Judge‚Äôs book. Contrived. Crafted. Fishing lure. Flop. He was a virgin beyond college. Even all old college friend who says he threw ice in a bar says he nevee witnessed him disrespect women
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand Blasey has bachelors in psych from UNC; master in Clincal Psych from Pepperdine; PhD in ed pysch from USC plus yrs in field. ...and you want me to believe shes just know processing a teenage groping incident from which she got away??? Yeah right.
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand What is character? Character is a pattern of behavior over time. His moral character is well established...EVEN if this ONE teenage incident was true. Blaseys story was crafted &amp; contrived. She was a fishing lure based on false premise all men are https://t.co/4jNA2ehqs6. Flop.
@sararodriguezny @SenGillibrand I do understand Due Process! I actually be college educated in such thangs. Using term ‚Äújob interview‚Äù u must picked that up from liberal talking pt.

@Essence Whether she is for real or fake, it was wrong to exploit a teenager &amp; put her up on natl TV spewing hate like that.  @DrPhil raking in $$$ on exploiting kids and spewing hate. Now he‚Äôs acting innocent on Breakfast club. puke. #Treasure #UnethicalDrPhil
@RealSaavedra Makes no sense. They are the evil perpetrators.  Imho, im glad we finally have two alive so that we can drill into their mentality and motivations
@SchnarkyS @DrPhil Yeah nothing like a popular adult male authority figure turning his back on a teenage girl who is already lacking a father figure.   Yeah, throw some gasoline on that fire.
@dcexaminer I hope at least this guy is paying you for advertising. #NotNews #PornLawyer #NoCred
@SchnarkyS @DrPhil @DrPhil is s two trick pony. He either slaps them upside the head w a 2x4 or publicly shames them. Or both. Thst might work with 80% of people but it does not work fir other 20%. He needs to update his psychology education. His 15 years of fame  needs to end.
@relyonshelly @DrPhil I dont know if its real or fake. Im no psychologist but it seems to me in the realm of possiblity that she does have some serious mental identity issues‚Äîinconsistent as they may be. If not, thats some serious academy award crazy there
@relyonshelly I agree with u (&amp; Nina) on what the hell is up w @DrPhil letting her yap on about all these racist words on natl TV but say notting about the racist trash talk. Retard NO everything else keep the cameras rolling.  I did watch the link video w TashaK.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil It possibly does.  Im not a psychologist and weve only seen a snippet of her, but she could indeed have an psychological identity that identified as a white supremist. Im not saying thats the case, but possible
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil I will concede these are mind issues. I agree the mind is malleable.   		I believe at end of day, the mind is a physical manifestation of how our neural network in our brains developed. Societal influences that, an element of it. Plus genetics, plus biology, plus consumption,+++
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil There is some validity there. Its a misalignment.  At the end of day, there is still XY or Xx chromosomes, which is not changing (yet).
@NPR Goodbye open source.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil Point taken. Im not going to go diwn this path of discussion though.	 	At end of day, @DrPhil is using and exploiting a minor.   And not much good will come of it.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil Yes, true. I have issue with many classification and categorization of memtal illnesses. Many are social constructs.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil ...with the exception of the hatred she speaks...which goes back back to not being able ti function in society.  She is at risk of offending someone who will retaliate.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil At some level i agree with you.	Transgenders have modern technologies at their disposal: surgeries, hormones, makeup to transform their bodies to match their minds. If there was some way to genetically chg color of skin (like MJackson-idk what he did), then no real diff.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil If she finds her allies with the KKK, she is also at great risk.  I am normally a ‚Äúyou do you, Boo‚Äù type of person but st the end of day, it has to work for the person. This girl gonna be annihilated. She is a minor. @DrPhil is wrong to put her in a stage.
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil The things she says openly will make her a target of retailiation.  True, transgender can be subjected to hate based violence too‚Äîbut i think the risk is smaller. This girl is so offensive, she wont last long in real world. #Treasure
@TruthSe49260169 @TheDrPhilShow @DrPhil Good Q. That can be debated. But i will differentiate it by their ability to function in society. Approve or not, transgenders can function, interact &amp; have community. This girl. She will be ridiculed &amp; possibly abused &amp; hard to find true friend.  #Treasure

@MissNikkiNY @DrPhil Man, i am so confused. For realz. Something is messed up here for sure.  Treasure may have multiple personalities or something.  All the same, drphil should not be putting her on natl tv either way. Whether she is real or fake.

@Robgarren1 @thehill look up Miguel Facusse in the NYT archives. He is Honduran &amp; 100% MEastern ethnic descent. Facusse is Arabic surname.  Dont play stupid that you can discern the ethnic &amp; national orgins by your personal experience of looking at people. Next u will tell me Warren looks NAmerican.
@Robgarren1 @thehill U r so funny. I pray to God u r joking...
@thehill So interesting that those who cant intellectually debate resort to name calling but then somehow delude themselves into thinking the are morally and intellectually superior. #MAGA
@Robgarren1 @thehill Again, if u understood general migration patterns, mass migrationa do tend to happen in communities... so your general theory of 100% mixing is false.  #EducateYourself

@Wearethe65m @thehill @VP He didnt say they were
@jlburkeroco @Robgarren1 @thehill Apparently, he didnt leave the resort...
@Robgarren1 @thehill Take a history lesson and do some research. There was massive MEastern migration to Central &amp; South American in 1900s.  Go ahead and look up NYTimes articles on Honduran Miguel Facusse... who happened to be Palestinian. Facusse is an Arabic name.
@simulacrandrew @thehill Dude, I will be polite in informing you that there was huge Middle Eastern migration to Central &amp; South America in 1900s.  I have relatives who are Honduran by nationality and 50% Arab/Palenstian ethnically. Peace.
@thehill People, if you knew your geopolitical history...you would be aware of massive migration of MEasterners to Central &amp; South America in 1900s.  Yes, more likely descendants than Warren being NAmerica. #BeSmart #LearnHistory #CaravanInvasion

@thehill u got played again.If u were up on your geopolitical history &amp; past migrations, u would know about huge Middle Eastern migrations to central and south america in the 1900s.  So yeah, M.Eastern ‚Äúdescent‚Äù people more likely than Warren being NAmerican! #BuyAClue #JournalismIsDeas

@atalanta44 @aone2three4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren @Harvard Okay... uh one more..,, in Texas it is advantageous to present yourself as white to get the job. UT is not quite as competitive as @Harvard and also not a so self-deceiving to believe white people are minorities :) #cheat #fraud #SheSoWhite #Pocahontas

@atalanta44 @aone2three4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren Uh... would that be the Native American recruiter that came from Oklahoma too??? Yeah how does @Harvard seem to find so many white-on-the-outside minorities??? Coincidence?? #ThingsThatMakeYouGoHmm #Pocahontas
@atalanta44 @aone2three4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren ...yes, please press @Harvard to release all their recruitment practices and docs. Oh!!! I guess we will get to see that soon enough. This is all great timing for #RealMinoritiesWin #StudentsForFairAdmissionsVSHarvard
@atalanta44 @aone2three4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren They admitted the box being checked in 2012. Not very smart action for someone as esteemed as a Harvard level academic. Kinda embarrassing. #ReputationSoiled #SheSoWhite #SheGotCaught #Pocahontas #PocahontasDreaming
@atalanta44 @aone2three4 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren Yeah and ‚Äúi have never had sexual relations with that woman‚Äù. I speculate u still believe Bill too.

@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren Yeah....the fine people of Massachusetts may still continue to not be bothered by a white privileged elitist educated woman faking being a minority for personal gain, but the rest of America wont tolerate that. #SheSoWhite #SheGotCaught #PocahontasDreaming #Pocahontas
@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren I can not prove anything to a person who is committed not to believe. Her genetic test is proof enuf for me. Its beyond laughable that she went public with that. Talk about being in an echo chamber. #SheSoWhite #Pocahontas #PocahontasDreaming #SheGotCaught
@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren Common sense. I dont know anyone who is checking any ethnic minority box based on possibility of ONE of their greats from at least six generations ago on any form unless they be trying to minority qualify. #SheSoWhite #SheGotCaught #Pocahontas #PocahontasDreaming #CommonSense
@Demofthefuture @TreeOfLiberty15 @thehill @SenWarren should respect her whiteness and not be faking that she‚Äôs a minority for personal gain. That would be nice. Thats the real offense. The  Nikki Haley comment was at a roast...by design. #SheSoWhite #PocahontasDreaming

Isnt it frustrating when you cant control others think. Go ahead call me deplorable &amp; see how that works out in Nov. #Pocahontas
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Oh God... do you think they might bring up you stealing a minority label for your own personal gain? Theres no need to be ashamed on your whiteness Liz. Its okay to be white. God forgives you. #WhiteWhiteWhite #Pocahontas

@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren I never denied appropriation exist as a matter of culturally integration, engagement &amp; exposure. Still all quite different from me as an educated woman checking a box identifying myself as a minority in a privileged &amp; elitist institutions of higher education. #fraud #Pocahontas
@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren There is no dispute that liz notified employers ar UPenn &amp; Harvard checking the Native American box.  A very intentional and conscious act from a very educated woman. #fraud #Pocahontas
@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren Um,,, i believe in cultural infusion, immersion, blending, sharing, diffusing. All quite different than putting the label ‚ÄúCherokee‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù behind my name and promoting myself as such in privileged, elitist circles. #fraud #Pocahontas
@atalanta44 @DonaldJTrumpJr @SenWarren 1. She is white. 2. She promoted herself as Native American... genetically weak, culturally weak, minority wannabe... when convenient. Diminishing minority experiences everywhere. #WhiteWhiteWhite #fraud #Pocahontas

@howroute @readercenter @nytimes Proudly can! #supportwomensRightToBeRational
@readercenter @nytimes The Democratic playbook of holding this til the 11th hr to create a spectacle was a bad fail. The whole thing was based in premise that all men are guilty. Backfire. Failed. Slung mud in own face #FordIsAFraud #FordTheFraud
@readercenter @nytimes Completely crafted and contrived.  Coincidently the only details she remembers of the summer can be found in MJudges book #FordIsAFraud
@readercenter @nytimes As a woman, im embarrassed that the Dems put Blasey up as some exemplar of sexual assault w her36 yr old traumatic event being a grope by a teenage boy from whom she got away. All privileged - highly educated nonsense. U milay not be able to say it but American has common sense
@DRUDGE_REPORT Well... when it came to the ballot box, HRC wasnt a moral leader either. So i chose a flawed man who i felt at least understood business, economics, and power dynamics to lead the free world. Not so disappointed. #MAGA

@CaroleRadziwill Yes 1) all sexual assault claims agnst Kavanaugh are false, 2) there is photographic EVIDENCE of once-SEN. Franken staging a grope of sleeping colleague who claimed he forcibly kissed her, .3) yes, we all know PTrump to be a misogynist a-hole but voting for HRC was not an option

@johnpaulpagano @jkirchick @agrenell @nytimes careful now... i do believe most your subscribers are indeed ‚Äúwhite‚Äù
@CNNPolitics @maziehirono @SenatorCollins Sen Hirono, this process wasnt about justice for Blasey. It wasnt abt her at all. It was abt the moral character of Kavanaugh...which is pattern of his behavior over time. So even IF true, it doesnt hold. #FordIsAFraud #FordTheFraud

@dcexaminer @eScarry Her story was highly contrived &amp; crafted... including i felt he was going to ‚Äúkill me‚Äù so she could claim PTSD. It all lacks common sense authenticity. Noone in the press or politicians can say that...but to think America cant detect it...wrong. Sheesh #FordTheFraud #FordIsAFraud
@dcexaminer @eScarry To have a Bachelors degree in psych from UNC, masters in clincal psych from pepperdine, PhD in Ed Psych from USC, &amp; work professionally in the field...and she acts like this is first time processing this 36 yr old groping event from which she got away #FordTheFraud #FordIsAFraud
@dcexaminer @eScarry Coincidently, there are zero details to her story that cant be found in MJudges book #FordTheFraud #FordIsAFraud
@dcexaminer @eScarry ....the thing is Ed, the Dems were trying to ride #MeToo but they abandoned authenticity &amp; common sense. To put up Blasey‚Äôs story (even IF true) as an exemplar of sexual assault makes it lose its luster. #FordTheFraud #FordIsAFraud

@LeslieMarshall @ladygaga Shes an artist... not exactly a legal scholar or psychologist. What she says about trauma is true...when its REAL trauma. Blasey has a PhD is psychology, its total BS that if this happened that its the 1st time she processed it. #FordTheFraud

@maziehirono What is a sham is that Dems sat on Blasey for over a month while u prepped her, lawyered her up, scrubbed her, rehearsed and polished her. U sent her out as a fishing lure based on premise that all men are guilty. #MeTooFraud #ConfirmKavanaughNow
@AnnCoulter Yeah right! She is free to pack up and move any day of the week.  Although NZ is nice, they might be a little too reserved for her tastes. #MAGA #ConfirmKavanaughNow

@dcexaminer So sad that we are using this incident as exemplar of sexual assault and female disenfranchisement.  She got groped in high school by a boy in high school and she got away. 36 years ago. Sigh.  #whitePrivilegeGoneBad #MeTooFAIL #SupportWomensRightToBeRational
@fisherlady1960 @joseflopez98 @realDonaldTrump I am ashamed to be a woman at this time.  #SupportWomensRightToBeRational

@EdWhelanEPPC Hello all #metoo ladies.   Even if true...Decades delayed revenge is not the solution. Take care of self first. Stay safe and if that means sober and sane then do it. If assaulted, get help and report in timely manner. Sitting in shame does not do the spirit well. Get help early.

@nytimes @realBobWoodward On npr i heard a bit about concern cuz @realDonaldTrump asked why we have military in SK.  Not dumb-smart! Asking is deconstructing and reframing. What is true abt this 60 yr old policy? Its not an order; its a q. Presuming WW3 is fallacious. U dumb and panicked.
@FoxNews this is not news. this is a man living his life with dignity and respect.  this is not blast worthy.  mind yo bizness

@gardedan @DistrictDawg @glennbeck @benshapiro Yeah. Foreign is foreign‚Äîregardless friend or foe
@timmythegeek @DistrictDawg @glennbeck @benshapiro Yeah... remember how Obama diss‚Äôd Romney saying Russia was our biggest geopolitical threat.   Guess we do need that 1980s foreign policy back!
@DistrictDawg @glennbeck @benshapiro Foreign be foreign.  Regardless of friend or foe.
@TIME Journalism is dead.  Manufactured reality.  #FakeNews
@USC_Athletics @kendi_kendall @USC_Track_Field Impressive and inspiring ladies!  Showings‚Äô us how it is done!

@FoxNews @charlierose @CBS @PBS I guess what Trump said wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlocker room‚Äù talk after all. Appears to have been ‚Äúon the set‚Äù talk.  @charlierose  @cbs
@CillizzaCNN @johnlegend Difference is words versus cheesy grin ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so enjoying doing this while she sleeps‚Äù photographic evidence.
@tru50liv @jillralston30 @_trific @janlynnhen @SenFranken @FoxNews The difference being that she was not in control.  She didn‚Äôt choose the creeper.
@jillralston30 @_trific @janlynnhen @SenFranken Um, no he didn‚Äôt admit it.  He said he remembers it different.
@SenFranken Creeper.  Never never never gonna get it.
@nytimes Has ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù become intertwined w terrorism???? Um, the ‚Äúsomehow‚Äù is obvious.  Are you deaf, blind and dumb, NYT?   Somehow???? Sheesh.
@Thinkingshared How did he get his hair to be so perfect. It‚Äôs almost like he doesn‚Äôt have a receding hair line. Oh is it wrong of me to critique his looks?
@Thinkingshared Man‚Äôs gift to women, he is.  I wish I could date I guy like him.  Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.
@dcexaminer Yeah right she did...In her late night fantasies. Maybe @HillaryClinton and @donnabrazile can go on book tour together and rekindle the love
@dcexaminer Uh, what‚Äôs this nine million dollar line on the expense report?  Huh?
@DailyCaller Hillary has done more for Tammy Wynette that Tammy ever could have.  A good wife knows how to manage mistresses. @HillaryClinton #ImWithHer
@DailyCaller How many dead in NYC2001? How many years at war?   Get a grip @KeithOlbermann   You are hallucinating.  #MakeNewsRealAgain
@newtgingrich Cuz the truth hurts. You can not change what you don‚Äôt acknowledge.  #MakeNewsRealAgain
@NBCNews Oh @donnabrazile .... theoretical integrity does not integrity make.   Yeah, thought it, dreamed it, swallowed it whole. #ImWithHer
@thehill Thanks for shooting liberal feminism in the head, @davidhorsey @latimes  #workingMomsMatter
@Newsweek Be responsible journalist.  Don‚Äôt kill your brand.  #MakeNewsRealAgain
@Newsweek Why are you promoting this crap?  #makeNewsRealAgain
@dcexaminer I wonder if your sponsors feel the same?
@CNN ...and CNN pretends to be a professional news outlet.   Just cuz someone said it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to repeat.  5th grade lesson learned.
@WalshFreedom Exactly.  If you don‚Äôt like gun violence, do not support it in your entertainment!
@dcexaminer Yes
@jbro_1776 You‚Äôve said plenty.   Not your job, idiot, whether it all be true or not.   Time to deflate your ego.  It‚Äôs not about you, fool.
@realDonaldTrump Thx for creating stable business environment! Now we need to reverse Obama‚Äôs removal of caregiver overtime exemption. Hurts those who care!
@mitchellvii Exactly
@TPNN_ThePoint How about entertainers work in taking violence out of our entertainment industry!!!!  Music, film, and TV
@FoxNews Uh... why don‚Äôt we wait for his motive to come out.  It very well may be those 72 virgins in the sky.
@DailyCaller Entertainers can best help by lobbying for taking violence out of our entertainment... music, film and television.
@DailyCaller Genocide?   Complete loss of reality and historical perspective.  And she doesn't see herself as an aggressor.... #MakeAmericaSaneAgain
@Bettyjo48 @DailyCaller I know.  Apparently not. Sigh. One can dream. I'll have hope anyway
@nytimes Gratitude. Give it a try.
@DailyCaller Wow.  I just want everybody to get along
@nytimes So tired of paying for tax payer subsidized stadiums where most can't afford tix anyway. #BoycottNFL #AthletesArentMyHero
@thehill So tired of paying to these tax payer subsidized stadiums where most can't afford to go to games anyway.  #BoycottNFL
@mitchellvii Indeed. While playing in tax payer subsidized stadiums where most can't afford to attend. #BoycottNFL
@SteveBannen Yes they got a right. But should remember they are playing in tax subsidized stadiums where most can't afford to attend games #BoycottNFL
@FoxNews @Ravens @Jaguars @POTUS @NFL Already tired of tax payer subsidized stadiums when I can't afford to buy ticket prices. Already was #BoycottNFL #MakeCollegeBallGreatAgain
@thehill Good
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton @POTUS @hillaryClinton is a TWynette standing by her cheating man w/intern in OOfc.  Plz, get a divorce then u can preach and be an Aretha-RESPECT
@business 100k for Russian ads is what % of total campaign $$s?? And y'all sayin' that influenced the election? Plz, we wish elections that cheap!!!
@realDonaldTrump Donald, I love you but don't you have another problem to work on?  :)
@thehill Sorry, not picking up that shame she throwin' on me.  Why doesn't she understand that's exactly what makes her just barely "likeable enuf"?
@thehill This coming from a woman who stayed married to Bill Clinton...tell me more about how to be a self-respecting woman, Mrs Bill Clinton. Pleazz
@FoxNews Yes...all while balanced with the fact they are in the entertainment biz with a fan base while wearing the uniform of who they work for
@mitchellvii Haha-except Republicans want less taxes and Dems want more
@realDonaldTrump Yes, deceived by @SenJohnMcCain  . Liar. No integrity. No honor. So disappointed.  #AZVoter #MAGA
@nytimes This guy=idiot. Fact is ppl who do this work are obsessed male geeks. Women are capable but simply unwilling to be that. Feminism get real!
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Exactly. He's a liar and a fraud.  No honor. No integrity.  Deceived. #AZVoter
@ABC Nothing but a blemish on American history
@ABC Poor Comey.   Time to fade away.  No one likes you.., and I mean no one.

@ABC What type a show am I tuning in to?  I would like you to tell me a joke. :) @JimmyKimmelLive
@HillaryClinton ...and of a man/partner who treats you with dignity and respect
@thehill Hillary is a slow learner.  Shaming and judging people does win you friends or voters.  Sigh. You are what happened.  @HillaryClinton
@thehill This from the woman who remains married to Bill Clinton.  Tell me more about disrespecting myself, Mrs. Bill Clinton.
@thehill "While the report did not find evidence...,". How bout you lead with that?	Journalists? Really?
@Newsweek And who set that up with a "reset" button????   Eight years later.   Maybe our "friends" aren't are friends after all
@politico the NFL is in an entertainment industry...with a fan base.  People watch for enjoyment and fun unless you are a Browns fan. Remember that.
@AP Looks like a nice production piece by state politico machine. Was it your reporter on the ground AP? Or did this just arrive in your inbox?
@Independent Kim Jung Un did not call Trump if "dotard"--- his translator did. Give credit where credit is due.  KJU ain't that hip and savvy.
@Newsweek Oh Comey.   A day in a sad and lonely lonely life.
@HuffPost Yeah, it only took CNN 582 rallies later to figure that out.  What took them so long??? Sorry not impressed.   Hahaha
@dcexaminer Yeah, it only took 382 rallies later for CNN to figure that out.   What took them so long???? Sorry, not impressed.  Hahaha
@CBSNews Let's not forget the NFL is an entertainment industry with a fan base.   It's an enterprise of enjoyment.  Remember that's at the core.
@DailyCaller I liked the Mooch for five seconds.  Apparently it was five seconds too long
@CNN Kim Jong Un didnt come up wthe brilliant word "dotard", the translator did. Sorry KJU ain't that hip and savvy. Give credit where credit due
@dcexaminer "Prevent any negotiations"... um how long have we not been negotiating NKorea?   If polite diplomacy worked, Obama  would have fixed it!
@ABC Remember at the end of the day the NFL is an entertainment industry requiring a fan base. People tune in for a good time &amp; no other reason
@danibostick @AliCologne @realDonaldTrump Can you tell me how many counties in Arizona has one provider on the exchange with the real threat of having none? #AZVoter
@Bonita70737519 @HermesFlying @thehill B, your projections &amp; delusions are not real. We are not living in Nazi Germany. Get off twitter and take a walk outside. Check in w reality
@thehill Politics and sports have things in common.   They are entertainment.  Attention seeking. Both play to a fan base. How's it working for Kaep?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Agreed.  Privileged Chelsea has not a clue.  She wouldn't last 30 seconds on NKorea airways before she "disappeared"
@FoxNews @dbongino He lied. He deceived. No honor. No integrity.    disappointed AGAIN.  #AZvoter
@HermesFlying @thehill How many people has Trump gas chambered?  Take a history course and find out what a real Nazi fascist is.
@HermesFlying @thehill Omg.... you don't think fake news exists?   And you are on twitter?  Oh dear.
@IamRoyalOcean1 @thehill Actually Kim Jung-Un isn't that brilliant.  You can properly credit the translator for dotard.
@thehill 572 rallies and one POTUS later.... CNN figured it out.  Denying our existence doesn't make us go away. #MAGA
@DailyCaller NYT isn't as good as it never was
@DailyCaller NYT isn't as good as it never was. 	Muting one self does not vanish something out of existence.  Islamic terrorists, antifa. Farce news
@mitchellvii @SenJohnMcCain So ashamed. Deceived. #AZvoter
@realDonaldTrump Yes. He's a liar and fraud. No honor,no integrity.  So disappointed.
@thehill That's a lot of fancy talk. Sorry--not CIAs job to spy in Americans on our soil.   Oh oops!  Go talk to Sen RPaul. He can splain it to you.
@CNN Nobody loves Comey. A lonely lonely man. Sad. An island unto himself.
@Newsweek Nice to see us finally getting along
@TeaPartyOrg Who loves Comey? He's a lonely lonely man.  Sad.
@TheEconomist If any country can make someone conform, it's Germany.
@thehill Better than a white pant suit.  Just sayin'. @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #MakeAmericaFashionableAgain
@RakeshR89 @nypost @realDonaldTrump I agree with you, but he wearing a uniform that's representin more than himself. NFL is bout entertaining &amp; protestin ain't fun.. apparently
@CNN You finally figured it out CNN.   Only took you 172 rallies later. Brahahaha
@FreedomWorks Thumbs up. I have a right to express my opinions that may be contrary to yours.
@SarahKSilverman @Kaepernick7 No shot at Kaep.  Kaep ain't got a job. Can't fire someone who is unemployed.
@PatientAction Can you tell me when the federal subsidies for the states stop under Obamacare?
@DailyCaller What? You mean a late night comedian isn't a public policy expert all by himself?! Surprisingly not funny
@DailyCaller This is what happens when you believe the media that you paid to create
@DailyCaller What happened?!
@DailyCaller https://t.co/LASvxuyT0r üëçüèª
@DailyCaller @dhookstead Cuz there ain't no Kaepernick in TEAM
@DailyCaller @dhookstead Cuz at the end of the day, the NFL is in the entertainment industry.  And he's not entertaining. Simple.  Don't matter how fast you run...
@DailyCaller @dhookstead He has been set free.   He is free to do life his way.  No one owns his contract.  No one tells him what to do.  Now he's sad. :(
@DailyCaller @dhookstead Cuz when he and his girl go around talkin like the NFL is a form of modern day slavery, who is gonna hire him???  He ain't THAT good
@TheDCSports @DailyCaller Sad. Bad parenting.
@DailyCaller So disappointed. Traitor. Liar. Honor and integrity gone. Time to retire. #AZResident @SenJohnMcCain
@RyanAFournier Liar he is.  Honor vanished. Integrity poof.
@SenJohnMcCain So what you gonna do when there's no provider on the AZ exchange?  Where will u be then?	Traitor. Liar. #AZResident
@SenJohnMcCain You campaigned on repeal and replace. Liar
@SenJohnMcCain Traitor.  Yeah... like the bipartisan support that it had when it was rammed down our throats.  Time to retire.  #AZResident
@DailyCaller World hunger is result of World Bank
@Gov_Christie @thehill @nikkihaley POTUS, fake you
@FoxNews @POTUS KJU does not speak English. Dotard is not his brilliancy.  Please credit the translator.  Not that hip and savvy.
@dcexaminer Not national news. Not even local news
@politico @nikkihaley @nikkihaley for President 2024
@Gov_Christie @thehill @realDonaldTrump is living your dream.  Go pout in a corner
@Gov_Christie @thehill @nikkihaley for President 2024
@thehill @nikkihaley for President 2024
@dcexaminer Are you all aware that Obamacare federal subsidies to states are not designed to last forever? Designed to burden and fail
@nytimes Please stop crediting Kim Jong Un with the brilliancy of dotard and please start crediting the translator.  Sorry KJU ain't that hip &amp; savvy
@Reuters GDP=C + G + I + NX  .... time to focus on that NX
@KeepWarden @WashTimes Common practice at the time. Submission by fear and violence. Learn about Muslim practices as they pushed outward...cut off head.
@WashTimes So true. So tired of people judging prior times w modern perspective. There is such as SOCIAL EVOLUTION.
@shelli_chelle @thehill @RepMaxineWaters Touch√© ..... some are capable, others are not
@JeffFlake Good job @JeffFlake ,signed, Arizona resident.  AZ has one of most efficient Medicaid deliveries around. But not working for in gap!!!
@thehill Where has civility is politics gone?  Show us the way @RepMaxineWaters show us the way.  Discuss policy - not personality.  Ego Trippin'
@DailyCaller In the imaginary world where people like and respect her....
@DailyCaller ...but she's not...
@WashTimes &lt;ctl&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;dlt&gt; is his biggest regret in life?  How about his arrogant and condescending attitude at his anti-trust deposition? No?
@thehill Time to get real.  Polite diplomatic talk with despots does not work.  Refreshing speak.   Civilized diplomacy is relevant only in peace.
@thehill Don't blame Trump-speak for despots' abusing their own people. UN been in place how many years? &amp; despots still killing their own. Case: NK
@mtredden "trump does not value women" is poor correlation. I am a woman &amp; American.  Why not get my opinion from across the pond?  #MAGA
@thehill Where is China's accountability? They are the number one CO2 emitter in world. And that's not even counting the CO2 their population exhales
@dahlingECG @thehill China #1 CO2 emitter in the world.  Tell me what is their accountability in the Paris accords?
@dahlingECG @thehill Did you know that Chinese people breathe out more CO2 than American cars?? Wanna be a true environmentalist? Stop over-populating the planet
@dahlingECG @thehill So what major industrialized CO2 producing countries are you talking about?  Can you name top ten CO2 producers?
@piedpenguin @thehill @billoreilly I don't know nothin' bout BORs disgrace. I do know a lot bout BC and cigars, blue dresses, Oval Ofc, AR state police and prolonged affairs
@steven_demarest @thehill Relevant enough to take your time and attention!
@piedpenguin @thehill @billoreilly Like Bill Clinton? I agree!
@bbrussackpoltix @thehill Apparently you do!  You read his tweet!   Attention is love
@HuffPost #NotMyFeminist
@DailyCaller Prof should find a nice lawless, policeless country to call home.  Real-deal anarchy is a bit diff the theoretical anarchy. Won't last a day
@thehill Admit y'all. #RandPaul was right!   Secret governance is abusive governance.  No big brother here, trust us, right...
@brithume Shameful. #RandPaul was right all along
@dahlingECG @thehill Brahahaha.  Chinese can steal every bit of technology &amp; innovation America comes up with except carbon controls??? That's funny :) naive you
@dahlingECG @thehill Our consumption is their pollution.  If you don't want them to pollute, don't buy their manufactured products.  Problem solved w no payouts.
@dahlingECG @thehill If Americans really cared about the environment, they wouldn't buy cheap products made in China where they don't have to adhere to EPA regs
@dahlingECG @thehill Not true. Ive been to Katmandu.  No pollution they motorized. Now inversion pollution in valley.  Sorry it's not coming from America.
@NRO Poor professor.In real anarchy, there is no protection of the bureaucracy and academic institutions. Can't have cake and eat it too.  Fired!
@thehill No surprise since we are the ones suppose to pay $$ rest of world for them to keep polluting. Our CO2 emissions are decreasing, theirs not.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Let's get real.  We fund the world.  Let's act like that means something. Go Prez. #realDonaldTrump
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Yes! Let's not deny fact that power &amp; strength are the reality behind governance. Flex that $world funding muscle. Nothin' for free. Booyah.
@CBSNews #ArmchairLoser
@RandPaul I accept your apology.  Do what you can and keep fighting the fight.  #integrity
@realDonaldTrump Yes.  Make peace happen.  I believe!
@realDonaldTrump Rand understands $$$ and the bonds btwn Feds and states.  So difficult to unravel this mess.   But fix we must do.  One step at a time.
@realDonaldTrump Not the best, but a step forward, I agree
@Impeach_D_Trump @BreakingDTrump @realDonaldTrump They'll remember where they get their $ from soon enough.   For realz deal.  Not playing no more.
@realDonaldTrump I believe in peace.   Make it happen.  I believe.
@USATODAY So what would be a better name for a leader flying rockets over the only country ever to be attacked hit by atomic bombs???
@thehill Naked man butts make Hillary happy???  Great gift....to be stored in the vault.
@CBSNews Say YES to peace in the Middle East.   Now that would be worthy of a Noble Peace Prize.   Believe-make it happen.  Deal of all deals.
@Independent Not as awkward as staying married to POTUS Bill who had "sexual relations" w/intern in your house. Now smile pretty, Hillary, for next 20yrs
@washingtonpost Can you say "court martial"?  Not your baby, jerk.  Not your calling either.  Who is the real Satan here?????
@business You are right, healthcare public policy is not your area of expertise. ACA federal$ to states is temporary.  Not sustainable. AZ on brink.
@USATODAY ...and he's right.  She's not in office any more.  Says Single White Female Deplorable Who Made Mind Up All By Myself.  #GoHomeHillary
@cnni @CillizzaCNN PrezT still has no evidence? Or you don't have the evidence?  Prepare yourself to swallow your words
@FoxNews @KennedyNation Thank you and Tucker for actually having an education in philosophy.  So refreshing on my cable TV broadcast!
@Tedakin @jessebwatters AND the women who were not pressured by men!  Made my mind up all by myself.  I learned to do that when I left cheatin' hub behind....
@jessebwatters @SheriffClarke Don't forget to list all the "deplorables" who voted for a candidate that didn't think them "deplorable" !!!!
@SheriffClarke Much to her dismay, her greatest accomplishment will go down in history as a dutiful wife who stood by her man.  Tammy Wynette fulfilled,
@AP Uh... yeah.
@FoxNews How about too $pricey tickets all while they put the cost of stadiums to the taxpayers. Tired of subsidizing what I can't afford to attend
@Thereapper69 @FoxNews @HillaryClinton Can you answer the question? Who crafted the "protest gone bad" story?  Who approved it?  I do know this,,,HRC failed to correct it!
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Rest easy.  Last I checked (Fri), they are all glad to have a job and be contributing.  It's a right to work state.  They are free to leave.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Yes!
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Please consider changing the channel.  I'm not sure where you are getting such ideas.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Kate, I'm not in an argument with you about education or public health services.  It's errant of you to believe I don't support such things.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Didn't say it did.  I feel 100% confident in my social contribution.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker I pay state income taxes as well.  Are you suggesting that citizenry is based on equitable contribution?? Not very liberal if you.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker You are spewing false accusations and offer nothing in return.  Yet, I somehow feel I understand your political leanings. Nite nite
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Kate, or shall I call you Mikalev, you have exposed yourself as not being in my reality plane.  Nite nite.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Missed this earlier. Um, now I can clearly state you are "horribly wrong". I do pay federal taxes. I don't rcv $ from govt. AND no kids. :)
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker How so?
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Haha-you are funny.  Conscious choosing is my game, which may be why you struggle to understand me.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker As far as me being "horribly wrong", let me rest peacefully that my life will not be altered by your judgment.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Actually, its a respectfully way to acknowledge another's own way, self-determination, and autonomy... in a 21st century urban way
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker My top issues are labor laws, economics/national debt, health care systems, and immigration.  I live in AZ and am an employer.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker You said I wasn't being respectful-because you pride yourself for being so-then you call me boo boo. Fascinating. FYI-it's just one boo.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker What wasn't respectful?  Boo? For realz?    Where do you live?  Connecticut?
@Thereapper69 @FoxNews @HillaryClinton After multiple investigations, can you remind who crafted the armed assault was just a "spontaneous protest about a movie gone bad" story???
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker That is true for everyone.  I saw no one on the ballot worthy of being my moral leader.  I am solely responsible for me.  And you do you Boo
@kate_culhane @NewYorker PS) I said politics not politicians
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker It's the issues. It's not who is likeable or despicable.  but I can tell you this. You can't call voters deplorable and then get their vote
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker Trumps not likeable. I don't like what he said on a bus x-# of years ago.  But I'm not marrying him. Nor am I inviting Hillary over for tea.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker She is a smart woman.  I don't fit into a political box.  We all care about things, we just care about something other things more.
@kate_culhane @leahkrevit @NewYorker The answer to that is longer than a tweet will allow.  But in the words of Barack Obama, she is likable enough.
@CBSNews So the Russians were creating fake news/noise about anti-immigration rallies that didn't really exist.  Hmm.  Who was colluding with who????
@Delfiina2605 @SenSanders Cursing does not make you or your argument compelling....
@beaniedabuddha @NewYorker Thanks for the advice.  No need to sit when I'm living life outdoors.  I understand it-I am college educated after all.  #PublicEducation
@Ldydewood @NewYorker Would that be me or Hillary? :)
@leahkrevit @kate_culhane @NewYorker Thanks for looking me up!  And no worries I am not inclined to crumble to people who try to shame others.  Left that in 5th grade.
@kate_culhane @NewYorker Am I a cynic because I think a Prez should have a higher bar of what is despicable than someone accusing another of partisan politics? Pleaz
@vlsrn54 what Hillary is claiming as despicable is someone claiming they'll accuse some on of partisan politics. Read it. Then get over it. Pleazzz
@CBSNews Sad.  Prayers for Kenneka'a family and friends.  Keep your babies safe.
@NewYorker If Hillary can't deal with that level of politicking, she certainly wasn't prepared to be President. Boohoo. Politics by def. is despicable.
@guardian "It is clear... that non-believers have very little idea of what believers believe"
@HuffPost The world according to Bill Maher... he can only relate to what he knows... mental illness.  Cannot comprehend.  Sad.
@guardian Victims will never be victors as king as they view themselves as victims
@guardian Paradox... when one's indentity is grounded in being separate/different/fragmented, connectedness and together are not possibilities...
@SenSanders Is success defined by the high number of primary care providers who won't accept Medicare????
@TheEconomist And 100% New Orleans....
@TIME Uh... if they could, they would
@Newsweek Same as it ever was.  The withdrawal wasn't a disagreement on improving CO2 outputs. Conflict was paying the rest of the world to pollute.
@CNN ...maybe because there finally some awareness about MS13 presence in America with Trump
