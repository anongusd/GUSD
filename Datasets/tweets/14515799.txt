Record high-scoring season for the NFL, and game ratings were up 5% on average.		Record low-scoring Super Bowl, and it was down 5% year-over-year. https://t.co/bTairhyZKW

When Trump says stuff like this, and THEN says the drug problem "would be quickly and greatly reduced" with a wall, it's a total distortion of the truth https://t.co/Y6XGfddtkH
In a speech about border wall $$, Trump tried out a new stat: He said drugs "cost our society in excess of $700 billion" a year. The NIH's most recent # is $740 billion, but that includes tobacco use, alcohol, etc. Not just drugs smuggled from Mexico. https://t.co/mcrEb91z3N https://t.co/Z2Wue6SVtp

@creynoldsnc @SRuhle Could be. But in this case, I think there were many other factors. Tlaib was on tape -- story happened instantly. King was quoted in print -- it's been more of a slow build -- partly due to the reactions or LACK of reactions from other political leaders.
