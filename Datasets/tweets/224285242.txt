As #WomensHistoryMonth begins, join me in celebrating the extraordinary contributions women have made to Colorado and our country ‚Äì from opening businesses to running for office, and beyond. This month and every month, we continue our fight for progress and equality.
Passing this measure is one of many steps we must take to address this public health threat with the urgency it requires. #PFAS		More info here ‚Üí https://t.co/y3J87K51DH
It's inexcusable that the Trump admin continues to delay action to address PFAS contamination across the country. We introduced a bill to ensure contaminated sites are cleaned up &amp; resources are available to communities in Colorado so they have access to safe drinking water.
Thanks for all you‚Äôre doing to give young people the chance to serve our country and maintain our incredible public lands - in Colorado and across the country! https://t.co/lUckiManAL
Our farmers and ranchers know full well the cost of this trade war and need this administration to act responsibly. They won‚Äôt accept anything less. https://t.co/sXxBEXX2sF
Last year, U.S. carbon emissions increased &amp; we endured record-breaking drought &amp; wildfire across the West. More than ever, we need strong leadership at @EPA to combat climate change &amp; protect public health. @EPAAWheeler is not that leader. Full statement: https://t.co/MCbpL1TQD8
I can think of nothing more at war with who we are as Americans than letting kids grow up in poverty. A new report shows how we can cut child poverty in half &amp; how a child allowance, like my #AmericanFamilyAct, can be a big part of the solution.	https://t.co/mLz2NCLsc0
Heading into the Senate Ag Hearing to question @SecretarySonny on implementing the #FarmBill. From legalizing #hemp to funding drought resilience, we have our work cut out for us. We must ensure the Trump administration stands ready to help Colorado implement the bill.
Agree that the health of our communities is dependent on vibrant local news. We must seek out innovative ways to support &amp; invest in local journalism and ensure the next generation understands the critical role it plays in our democracy.

In Colorado, after two of the worst mass shootings in our nation‚Äôs history, our legislators rose to the occasion &amp; strengthened gun background checks. 		Today the House joined Colorado, passing a clean bill to #UpdateBackgroundChecks nationwide. 		The Senate must do the same.
#LWCF has directly benefited communities in our state like Durango. We are now one step away from providing Coloradans the certainty they need to pursue conservation projects that will boost the outdoor economy. https://t.co/I6TIWSn8uU
House passage of #LandsPackage2019 moves it to the President's desk. Permanent reauthorization of LWCF will expand &amp; ensure access to public lands for future generations. https://t.co/af6T8lCFrl
For years, I worked w/Senator John McCain, who valued service above all else, on the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps.

Now the Senate must pass this disapproval resolution to bring the President‚Äôs #FakeTrumpEmergency to an end. This sends a clear message to @realDonaldTrump that he cannot undermine democratic norms to fulfill his campaign promise. https://t.co/vbwIyn0n5v
#LandsPackage2019‚Äîwhich includes many bills I‚Äôve long-championed‚Äîwill ensure access to #publiclands for future generations. 		After years of working alongside Coloradans to save #LWCF, permanent reauthorization is headed to @POTUS' desk. Now our work for full funding continues.
Yet another example of the Trump Administration undermining women‚Äôs health care and the right to choose. https://t.co/NOQpo9maVg
.@realdonaldtrump, nice attempt to move the goal posts back to the 1950s by putting climate deniers on a panel to discredit a fact that your own government has reinforced time and time again: 		Climate change is a threat to national security. https://t.co/rHG5y6fK4l

Whatever your politics, every American should worry about a President inventing a fake emergency to bypass Congress. This is a dangerous precedent and blatant attack on our democracy and rule of law. #FakeTrumpEmergency
At a time when @POTUS attacks judges, flouts ethical norms, and disparages the Mueller investigation, Mr. Barr‚Äôs broad view of executive power and narrow view of obstruction of justice are deeply troubling. That's why I voted against his nomination for Attorney General.
Climate change is a national emergency. 		So is child poverty. 		You know what's not, @realDonaldTrump? Your ridiculous campaign promise.
We owe it to the kids in Parkland, and kids across the country, to fight for a country free from gun violence. 		The time to act is now.
In the year #sinceParkland, nearly 1,200 children have been killed by guns. 		Yet, tragedy after tragedy, Congress has done nothing.

The state I represent is a third republican, a third democratic, and a third independent. Colorado knows what hard, bipartisan work really looks like. We‚Äôll be looking in the days, months, and years ahead to see if any of it can be produced in Washington.
We heard nothing in tonight‚Äôs speech that addressed how the President will help raise incomes for middle-class Americans, make quality higher education more affordable, or address the urgent problem of climate change.
It will take more than a speech to paper over President Trump‚Äôs consistent view that the only obligation he has is to his political base.
What lines did we miss?
He thinks Democrats have ‚Äúturned into an angry mob, bent on destroying anything or anyone in their path.‚Äù
He has said Democrats are ‚Äútoo dangerous to govern‚Äù and have ‚Äúgone wacko.‚Äù
He has called Democrats ‚Äútotally unhinged‚Äù and the ‚Äúparty of crime.‚Äù
It will be interesting to hear what @realDonaldTrump comes up with tonight to talk about his commitment to bipartisanship. He should probably not repeat these earlier lines:

The farmers and ranchers of Colorado wrote enormous parts of this #FarmBill, and what passed today is a reflection of their priorities.
We have done our work‚Äîfrom the Agriculture Committee to the Senate floor‚Äîto advance this truly bipartisan #FarmBill. After two years of work, we‚Äôre just steps away from making good on our promise to Colorado‚Äôs farmers and ranchers to pass a bill by the end of the year.
The President should not be ‚Äúproud‚Äù to shut down the government for any reason, especially around the holidays. Tantrums like that highlight why Coloradans are so frustrated with Washington. I hope he will stop this brinkmanship &amp; work with Congress to keep the government open.
This bipartisan #FarmBill will legalize hemp, conserve land and water, combat climate change &amp; bolster economic security in rural communities. The finish line is in sight.

The rush and secrecy of the Kavanaugh hearings has left us to wonder what the White House is withholding from the American people. With @SenCortezMasto, led 19 senators to support @JudiciaryDems in calling on the WH to make Kavanaugh‚Äôs complete record public. https://t.co/HGVr53Mb3e
One year ago, @realDonaldTrump rescinded #DACA‚Äîpulling the rug out from under hundreds of thousands of Dreamers. Since then, he has blocked all legislative attempts to fix the crisis he created. It‚Äôs far past time to bring certainty back into these young peoples‚Äô lives.
By moving forward with these hearings, Senate Republicans are depriving the American people of a full, fair, and open confirmation process.
With so much at stake‚Äîincluding executive power and oversight, health care and reproductive rights, campaign finance, environmental regulations, and workers‚Äô rights‚Äîthe Senate cannot fulfill its constitutional duty to advise and consent without access to his complete record.
I stand with my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee in demanding the release of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs full White House record before his confirmation moves forward.
Handing over 42,000 more pages just hours before hearings begin is not transparency‚Äîit‚Äôs an effort to undermine the Senate‚Äôs ability to fully advise and consent. This is more reason to wait until all the documents are released before holding hearings. https://t.co/OHGtY9yr8t

We need to work together in good faith to provide the #PaidLeave workers deserve. Over 80% of Americans support paid family leave, but less than 15% of workers have access. It‚Äôs time we find a practical solution.
Unfortunately, the current GOP proposal does nothing to cover caregivers or workers who get sick. And it‚Äôs paid for by chipping away at Social Security. Workers shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between their children &amp; their retirement.
Today‚Äôs hearing showed encouraging bipartisan support for #PaidLeave. We need real paid leave that supports new parents, family caregivers, and workers suffering from an illness themselves.
Our security relies on strong alliances, which is why the Senate reaffirmed its bipartisan support for #NATO today. @POTUS should double down to fortify NATO‚Äînot isolate us from our partners while elevating Putin in the face of Russian aggression &amp; interference in our democracy.
Make no mistake: This is an escalating trade war, and the ones who lose a trade war are American workers, farmers and ranchers, and families. Reckless tariffs do not make a trade strategy. https://t.co/4bIFTb6kf4

Thank you to every teacher in Colorado &amp; across the country for the essential work you do for our kids &amp; communities.

U.S. intelligence has assessed Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA, and President Trump has offered no alternative path forward to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear capabilities. The President‚Äôs abandonment of the agreement is reckless.
Since taking office, @POTUS has produced no strategy to counter Iran‚Äôs malevolent activities across the Middle East, all of which would be more dangerous if backed by a nuclear weapon.
This hub for bioscience research at @CUBoulder has created a community of dedicated researches, startup founders, educators, and students. Thanks to Nobel Laureate Dr. Thomas Cech &amp; everyone at @BioFrontiers for showing me the work you‚Äôre doing to improve human health. https://t.co/gweWRBWRS8

Ending TPS for Hondurans forces tens of thousands of law-abiding individuals‚Äîmany of whom are parents to children who are U.S. citizens‚Äîback to a country challenged by violence, poverty, &amp; limited resources.

The Colorado teacher walkouts are part of a growing movement around the country. Read more on why it's so important that we listen to our teachers: https://t.co/ynTiXpcbfv
Coloradans want to take the long view and invest in our state‚Äôs future. To do this, we cannot neglect our schools. As a first step, we must find some way to prune the fiscal underbrush that threatens so deeply our investments in the future. Our children deserve better.
Shrinking state budgets have increased class sizes, reduced vital support for students like mental health services &amp; special education, and sometimes slashed school weeks to 4 days. We cannot allow mindless budget shortfalls to force wrongheaded changes to our kids' education.
A few important stats: Colorado teachers are now earning less than they did 15 years ago, when compared to inflation. The gap between what a college graduate makes as a teacher and what she could make in another profession in our state is the largest in the country.
First and foremost, we must listen to our teachers and educators. It was great to see former colleagues and friends on Friday as they spoke out about their experiences. #edcolo https://t.co/tfJ7BIPjZZ

The bipartisan #opioidbill we passed in the HELP Committee this week brings us one step closer to combating the epidemic. We secured three provisions in the bill that will help decrease opioid use &amp; provide those with substance use disorders the most innovative treatments faster.
In too many Colorado counties, hospitals are overwhelmed w/shortage of beds &amp; specialists; courts are barely staying above water; jails are crowded b/c of limited resources for #opioid addiction treatment. We must invest in broader effort to respond to a crisis of this magnitude.
Today thousands of Colorado teachers are demonstrating at the state Capitol for better wages and greater support for public education. We should listen to them. Op-ed in the @denverpost: https://t.co/ynTiXpcbfv

For American families, incomes have not kept up with rising costs of living. Coloradans tell me they feel trapped in a cycle of working so they have health insurance, but then spending too much on child care so they can work. Closing the #paygap is essential to break this cycle.
#EqualPayDay represents how far women, on average, must work into 2018 to earn the same pay as men did in 2017. It‚Äôs mid-April. This is unacceptable. We must close the #paygap, pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct, and fight for policies that reflect our ideals as a nation.

#ConnectColorado is a new initiative to help close the digital divide in our state. First up: Helping rural communities compete for $600 million in federal funding (secured in yesterday‚Äôs spending bill) by ensuring federal agencies provide timely answers to potential applicants.
Colorado‚Äôs local leaders, especially in rural areas, have been at the forefront of innovative approaches to deliver high-speed, reliable, and affordable broadband to their communities. We must do everything we can to build on their work. That‚Äôs why I'm launching #ConnectColorado.
Our farmers and ranchers want to be able to export the goods that they are producing here in the United States. They don‚Äôt need sympathy; they need the administration to act responsibly. https://t.co/kN7xKcA2Jw
Instead of lurching from one short-term spending measure to another, the #omnibus provides some much needed certainty. It includes a #FireFix that is particularly important to Colorado, and invests in #cleanenergy, LWCF, #infrastructure &amp; #opioid abuse prevention &amp; treatment.
.@facebook's admission and willingness to address its shortsightedness should force us to have an honest and transparent conversation about how social media companies secure and monetize our data.

The Trump administration needs to behave responsibly when it comes to trade.

This bipartisan #FireFix transforms &amp; modernizes the @forestservice's capacity to restore forest health and mitigate &amp; fight wildfires. It allows the Forest Service to complete the entirety of its mission, without being undermined by the pressures of fire. 3/3
Because of the pressures that #wildfires have brought to the West, as well as the challenges of climate change &amp; development, the antiquated way we pay for firefighting needed dramatic change. 2/3

.@POTUS should heed the Senate Intel Committee‚Äôs bipartisan recommendations for securing our voting systems and deterring those who aim to interfere in our elections. His inaction is confounding &amp; leaves our democracy vulnerable to future attacks‚Äîfrom Russia and others.
When the #MethaneRule was created in 2016, 75% of Westerners supported it. That‚Äôs because public feedback was considered in the process. @SecretaryZinke needs to do the same before he revises the rule. This affects too many Coloradans to act without their input.
The #MethaneRule protects the health &amp; safety of Western communities. Before @BLMNational revises it, @SecretaryZinke must listen to public input. With @RepRaulGrijalva &amp; Western lawmakers, urging @Interior to hold public hearings &amp; extend comment period. https://t.co/cO0ybx6VMw
We need a process that properly considers our political goals in Yemen and the region and a strategy to achieve them, as well as human rights, humanitarian conditions, the cost of conflict, and our geopolitical interests.
Voted to begin debate on Yemen Resolution bc I believe we‚Äôre overdue to have a discussion on U.S. policy toward Yemen. I would have preferred for that debate to start in the Senate Foreign Relations Cmt, where we should also consider authorization of military force more broadly.

#Dreamers' protection should not be contingent on dramatic changes to our immigration system. Instead, we must focus on providing certainty to Dreamers and keeping families together. I will continue to work with my colleagues on a bipartisan solution that can pass the Senate.

Could not agree more w/ Jen N. from Boulder, who says she doesn‚Äôt want buzzwords or vague statements‚Äîshe wants concrete plans &amp; actions. Tonight‚Äôs #SOTU is about more than tone &amp; rhetoric. It‚Äôs about looking to action in the next year. 10/10
In #SOTU, Coloradans want @POTUS to reaffirm his commitment to the rule of law &amp; respect for our institutions. 	Bruce S. from Denver says he wants to hear about ‚Äúplaying by the rules, and that no one, including the President, is above the law.‚Äù 9/x

In #SOTU, Coloradans want to know how we'll prepare our kids for 21st century economy. This means growing wages to keep up with the costs of housing, health care, and childcare. It means modernizing #highered &amp; career &amp; technical ed so students are ready for jobs of tomorrow. 5/x

The government should not be running on continuing resolutions. We have an obligation to the American people to stay here and do our work. We should use our bipartisan #DACA deal as a basis for negotiations and keep the government open. https://t.co/0v4U1tVRqm
To think we must vote for the CR or vote to protect Dreamers is a false choice.

Fundamental problem is that @SenateGOP didn‚Äôt set out to fix the health care system, they set out to repeal the ACA. #HealthcareBill
