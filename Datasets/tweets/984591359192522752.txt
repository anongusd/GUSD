Nancy &amp; Chuck should thank Sean &amp; Ann for strengthening their poker hand in the eyes of the American public.
Most folks who serve in Congress don’t do it for the title or for what future professional pursuits it may lead to. That’s true for Republican &amp; Dem MOC’s. Maybe in time u will find that to be true &amp; share a more favorable impression of people you serve with and who serve in gvt. https://t.co/f6MVNmx7NK
@byelin I think they felt that way too, and I have great respect for them. Reasonable people sometimes disagree, particularly on the types of votes when a legislator is often tasked with choosing to push red or green when inserting their voting card.

@xGAfletcher If you feel journalists vetted this and reported responsibly then you certainly have the right to think that. I simply disagree.
@xGAfletcher I find myself being restrained and sticking closely to only the facts and observations as I find them to be, but you’re free to assign me whatever bias etc you’d like.
@ryanosaurus716 Maybe so, maybe no, but perhaps you &amp; others should ask whether your contempt for the President is dangerously skewing your perspective on a highly-edited video which sought to inflame &amp; create a maelstorm toward what u describe as “maga hat” “white” teenagers who are pro life.
@ryanosaurus716 He went up to them. Not surrounded. Behind him are his folks videotaping. Also teenager in question isn’t in the video. Your bias shines thru, which is fine, twitter away.
@wisgaug Precisely, people didn’t like a smirk and so they assigned him guilty. Doesn’t get much more dangerous than that. Hopefully one’s children don’t have smirks that turn people off bc otherwise they’ll be subject to being guilty before proven innocent by those rushing to judgment.
@ryanosaurus716 Also what does the skin color of the kids have to do w anything? Either someone did something wrong or they didn’t.
@ryanosaurus716 My understanding is he walked into their circle, not vice versa. Were they supposed to go somewhere when he came banging an instrument in their face? Wearing a hat isn’t a crime, nor is being a teenager, nor is being pro-life. Last I checked, at least.
Journalism is vetting a story, esp an explosive one, thoroughly before reporting. The initial “reporting” was something less than journalism. The question is what underpinned the thirst to demonize a 17 yr old w false innuendo, &amp; why did so many delight in wreaking hate on him? https://t.co/EOGQDsuslz
Normal people would come to that conclusion, yes. https://t.co/xnPdj0EfX2
Honest answer -no one should look at another’s face &amp; describe it as “punchable,” esp that of a 17 yr old “kid.” You’re referred to as a “humanist” &amp; “public intellectual” working on “peace.” Don’t u think u should delete this post and apologize to the masses u spread this to? https://t.co/QI6uq3NIdc

@MikeLowry5150 Pretty sure I follow, yes. the bill presented to me had $5B for Wall, $8B for disaster relief. There was no clean bill presented to me for vote. You’re saying you’d vote against wall, disaster relief, &amp; to shut gvt down, correct? Sounds like we would vote different on this one.

@jonfavs That is my position. $5B doesn’t do that. And similar to Sen Heitkampf, I view the “wall” as figurative and representing something more broad than just a concrete wall.

@PeterChim @wcdailylocal @BallardSpahrLLP must be real proud of your comments, Peter, calling another human being a piece of garbage. A human being who served Chester County for over a decade who took the time to reflect on the service of former HW Bush and our need for more civility.

@solonl2001 Other thing on that race. His opponent defeated Sanford in primary and turned off a lot of Republicans in process. Created unique opportunity for Dem to brand differently.
@solonl2001 Good points. I was asked do Dems have a mandate. There’s wasn’t a national house Dem campaign platform a la GOP ‘94 so it’s hard for me to extrapolate a defining mandate other than, if u tried to boil it down, a rebuke of Trump. I agree the gentlemen from SC ran a good campaign.

@BarbaraVanlaan See 538 analysis. It’s next to impossible to create competitive seats in some urban areas. You end up with seats that are 80% Democratic or more. There’s a few GOP examples but Dem population location results in some of the data Maddox points to. May GOP seats more competitive.
Just off top of my head - This ignores candidate quality where R’s may have won close races, higher density of Dem voters in some zip codes, VRA protections requiring certain leg. boundaries for minority representation, a changing electorate over 7 years since lines being drawn. https://t.co/4mxHjYztWg

@Andrew_Moul @PoliticsWolf @DrewVanDrese Not defending a map. Judges take an oath to defend constitutionally recognized procedures. In this case judges chose politics over procedures. It’s not debateable what they did. It was politically corrupt.
@PoliticsWolf @DrewVanDrese The judicial map drawing process was rigged. I’ve been very clear on my arguments. You are conflating my position for your own purpose.
@browntailedhawk @kkondik The new maps actually incentivize extremists. I simply know more about all of this than most. Which is fine. Twitter.
@DrewVanDrese @kkondik I do intelligent dialogue quite regularly. But u disqualified yourself w your previous name calling. And as an “aspiring lawyer” someday someone will teach u name calling doesn’t really aid an argument. I’m done now.

@thejackweller Not upset at all. Just pointing out the obvious.

@MRKruge I didn’t draw a map. I came in after map was in place for two years. My point isn’t about the shape it’s about the process. U either do not comprehend that or u do not care to acknowledge that. Either way it’s not productive to engage w u.
@livingpotato @ReubenJeffery My point is that the legislature draws maps. That were in place for 6 years. Then a court unilaterally last minute voided it, manipulated process to redraw, then redrew itself behind closed doors to favor Dems as much as they could. This isn’t my opinion. It’s 1000% factual.

@whosonfirst6 Those are not GOP activists.
If the Dems want to media litigate this for the next few weeks it will damage them even more. There’s plenty of examples of Dem activists acting in ways that regular folks will look at and say it is unacceptable and should be rejected. That’s about as diplomatic as I can put it. https://t.co/O35HugIDkA

@TilterWindmill @GoldsteinThomas I don’t engage when people draw false conclusions from my tweets. Tho larger states would more easily exploit smaller states were it not for equal representation. So u proved my point and u didn’t even realize it when u did.
Occasionally I will randomly meet someone, &amp; they leave me feeling good about the future of our democracy. Then I go on twitter &amp; this feeling evaporates in like 2 seconds.
Senate designed 200+ yrs ago to treat states equally, mindful population trends change. some states have strategic importance to U.S. beyond large population, eg, energy &amp; agriculture resources, maritime. Constitution must change bc a journalist didn’t like how a vote turned out? https://t.co/kafNGorbOo

@Cellularlinks Actually they don’t want investigation into Clinton/FBI intersection, they’ve said as much, nor how the privacy of Dr Ford was breached when her letter was leaked. At least as far as I have understood it to be.
It’s interesting how Dems lambaste R’s for trying to interfere w FBI  Mueller/Russia investigation, have already said they’re voting No to Kavanaugh, yet now want to tell the FBI how to conduct the Kavanaugh background investigation. Maybe interesting is the wrong word

Issue of reporting vs opinion journalism &amp; social media momentum generated off latter another issue under analyzed 2date imo.
1) A process easier to defend 2) if confirmed, maybe Coons speech that votes No, but calls out Dems 4 some reckless dangerous partisanship of Noms process, labels process fair/legit. Big If/Maybe. Reasonable minds can disagree. Not sure how far Coons would go down this road https://t.co/mEJ7AjvFxP

It is deep, deep stuff. &amp; I think it will be talked about &amp; dissected for this generation of parents in ways previous generations never had to wrestle with. That is a good thing, bc we are evolving as a more equal society. &amp; it actually doesn’t have to do much w politics. Okdone
W looking back at mistakes knowing their kids would make mistakes. Wrestling w the knowns and unknowns. Wanting a daughter to be believed. But also not having a son lose a chance if he didn’t do something he was accused of. And for some, maybe even if he did act wrong.
then college &amp; work their way up corporate ladder. They worry abt daughters getting mistreated; but also about sons doing something stupid during their awkward years &amp; having it destroy them forever. Many I heard  this week said it wasn’t  abt R v D. It was how to wrestle
I hope a journo deepdive’s 30/40 y/o’s reflecting thru lens of when they were teenagers &amp; in college, getting hammered at beer parties, MeToo issues, now raising little boys &amp; girls, trying to sort out complexities &amp; worries for when their babies become teens    (Thread)
I know Jeff Flake. He’s kind, decent, principled. What he did wasn’t easy. It may be his voice today angered  conservatives, yet next week angers liberals. Yes, more ugliness now ensues bc process extended. But a man voting his conscience is needed in a divided republic. Always.

@danielschuman @rickhasen Claiming Hasen has “definitive” word on this is also not accurate. Ok, Go Eagles!
@danielschuman @rickhasen Tx 4 sharing hasen analysis. I read &amp; respectfully disagree. It’s largely a campaign finance system complaint- fine enough. saying nothing of value to opponent based on how Collins votes is facially inaccurate so far as I can tell. Obvi FEC is final word, not me, u or Hasen. Tx.
@Cellularlinks That would be illegal, too, actually. Your example is just another example of something illegal and proves my point more than disproves it, actually.
@SarnoDoyle This is a straight quid pro quo. A political contribution to a candidate or officeholder cannot be conditioned by a vote for or against something, by law.

@7bestoftimes I agree. It’s possible to find a court ruling indefensible and yet not defend how a map looks or the brute political plays made in map drawing. Good judgment possible; eliminating politics from map drawing, I think, is impossible. Last min court drawing improper IMO.
@WillCousins86 @7bestoftimes Well, to start, applying 2016 results to 2012 map is backwards and not a proper guide. Additionally compactness plays a role, as do other constitutionally recognized elements. Plus of course politics. Plus ticket splitters. Not as simple as u make it w ur one data point.
@7bestoftimes The districts are red bc voters voted red for state legis who then voted red favored congressional lines . That’s not corrupt. That’s consistent w constitution provided it doesn’t violate VRA or state constitution standards. Doesn’t mean u have to like it. Just is what it is.
@7bestoftimes “Fair districts” and “non partisan” are subjective phrases; can’t prescribe objective metrics or evaluation IMO. Judges now just get to make it up, which is what they did in PA. They drew a Dem map to replace a GOP map bc judges were Dem. NC a bit diff but timing is ridiculous
@7bestoftimes Gerrymandering means diff things to diff people. It’s the job of legislatures per constitution. U vote for legis and guv, they approve lines, unless state prescribed otherwise. It’s a political exercise. Has been since the beginning of our democracy.
Absolutely correct. And the losers are all candidates and voters who are confused by it all. But the lawyers will claim they’re just fighting for “fair maps” when what they’re fighting for are maps rigged by courts to their partisan advantage. https://t.co/XfpiDsoNYM

@bkschwartz Appreciate your data free feedback!
@bkschwartz Congress hasn’t really “done” anything on guns or immigration in past 1.5 yrs, nor did Dems when they had unified gvt 8 years ago. Also The Hill wrote the article not me. Ur free to not follow me if u feel I trivialize things imp to u. Just takes a click to do.

my TH tweet got feedback, tx to @kasie. Let me add a TH should be recorded &amp; uploaded for all 2 see. Most go bc they want to hear MOC be real, take tough ?’s, not to cause scene. Not all can make live TH tho. Uploading 2 web gives opp 4 all 2 see. Anything less ain’t a real TH.
@karenlytle711 @kasie By all means hold a live TH in higher regard, I do,  but a teletownhall gives more people a chance to hear what their MOC thinks from their living room, esp w busy lives and travel time. Both serve useful purposes. Calling. Teletownhall a “sham” i take issue with. That’s all.
@paigeo_rage No. A group of people set up a sham political event and held it even after I said I couldn’t attend. Big difference. But u don’t strike me as the objective type
@CWierzbowski Every townhall I ever did was fully recorded and uploaded for all to see. Doesn’t get more transparent than that.
It’s not a “sham” to hold tele- townhalls. But it is not a substitute for a live TH.  When having a TH, closing it to press makes no sense, bc banning press means bad press. All while she does cable hits which involve tougher &amp; more rapid questions than a townhall. Makes no sense https://t.co/ICObLvtPto

@sahilkapur Votes on bills that will go nowhere (I call them “purity votes”)  but we must vote bc of hfc demand in order to get to must pass votes. The “going nowhere” votes then trigger criticism from our most conservative voters bc they’re highlighted by heritage hannity etc to “Rinoblast”
@sahilkapur Too much to say here, but eg - whip Undec’d on bills bc hfc will hold out for changes I’d deem unacceptable . Being early &amp; sharp on issues they try to make bigger (eg) impchmnt of R-stein, else entire Conf gets branded part of effort.

Others, such as yourself, may reasonably disagree. I have personal experience w this and feel strongly that eliminating hateful and false stuff is a good thing for social media. It opens door for more civility. And roots out bad actors. My 2 cents!
@paulyswans Sure. I think blocking folks who are nasty is a good thing. But if you have an official page, ACLU may try to prevent blocking. Happened to me w some folks spreading hateful rhetoric, etc. my feeling is ACLU has become more of a political movement than nonpartisan 1st Amdt org.
Absolutely, blocking is way to go. If others spread hate or nastiness just zap them. That’s why the block button is there. Only exception is on official pages bc ACLU will try to sue bc they endorse spreading left wing hate and trying to remain relevant. https://t.co/lIIBA6SwGl

@SamMaverick36 I have the same precise question. And not knowing what I don’t know, nevertheless think that using more precise language (or answering ur question) wouldn’t impede or undermine investigation. But again, I don’t know what I don’t know.
Also, anyone demanding an “investigation by Congress” on this point, 2 points - 1, Mueller already is doing so, 2, why would anyone want Congress holding more hrg’s on this issue after yesterday’s circus? As if Congress is best-equipped to deal w this and not Mueller . . . .
It would be helpful to MOC’s if they’d clarify if the candidate was ever elected. Would help narrow the pool, perhaps. Maybe they can’t do so for some ongoing investigative reason. https://t.co/nJPqoXn9ZX
@TX_Vet1 @GOP @SpeakerRyan @kayleighmcenany Mueller already is. I m sure they know who it is they just didn’t name them. Why would anyone want congress more involved in mueller probe after yesterday hearing?” Think b4 u tweet.

@GildaRose77 @phillydotcom ? I said big loss for "democracy". There was nothing partisan in my assessment.

All those in Congress have charted their own independent path on the when &amp; how to respond; I largely agree w Sen Flake. Also Flake is a very good Centerfielder. https://t.co/oNWa4gvtni
@FoxReports nicely done &amp; Tx for including me, tho we both know that like 80% of my (funny?) one-liners were edited out! https://t.co/ZLr2GNs7lE

I don't believe those signing the discharge petition, in doing so, "defy" Paul Ryan. Signing the petition is not in any respect a reflection on the level of support he has as Speaker. It's a reflection of frustration over a particular set of policies not being debated/addressed. https://t.co/0U3AirJ9NT

&amp; if ur more toward the middle (albeit middle right) trying to make sense of things, govern pragmatically but w principle, &amp; reserve judgment until u hear all the facts and understand all the angles, many will say u lack courage &amp; are a coward.

@JakeSherman on @KasieDC correctly notes that not putting forth some reasonable, almost universally agreed to gun safety measures risks young voters tuning out GOP. &amp; if POTUS put forth consistent gun safety platform many if not most Republicans would get on board. I already am.

Happening Now: proposed Democratic Resolution to Appoint Select Committee to inquire on resignation/termination of House Chaplain who is still serving in said role. Strong likelihood it will be a bigger waste of floor time than floor debate and voting on naming post offices.

Pergram on point: "divergent decision by Founders leads us to conundrum . . bifurcated authority gives both branches . . Opportunity to act . . Also means 1 branch can dodge its war responsibilities." I support strikes last week, but think floor debate on new AUMF advisable. https://t.co/HeaAXoBnbm
