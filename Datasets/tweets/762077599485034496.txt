People don't have meta powers, and the organization isn't like the Justice League or the Avengers, but The Illuminati is definitely super cool. Represent human interests and furthering the cause of human interests. I respect that. I would love to join, but I need help.
I love The Illuminati and everything you've done for mankind and that you are the light. In a perfect world, their is no Superman, no superheroes, no Zues or no aliens. Their is time, mankind, technology, intelligence, wisdom, enlightenment, and simple pleasures.
I've had a Illuminati master try and recruit me. Offered to fly me to LA. I had to refuse. Not because I wanted to refuse, but I was unable to accept. Someone else has my guardianship and I live in a miserable group home life. Just waiting to be rescued.
This is me reaching out. I am Joseph Rowe. Might remember an email, JosephRowe84@outlook.com ordered a Oath agreement and gold Talisman. Sarah Withers, my attorney ordered it. Then another email I have, JosephRowe1984@gmail.com received a email receipt.
@ThelIluminatii I respect The Illuminati, the light and any force for good. Have I done something to insult The Illuminati or anyone of it? If I have, I humbly apologize. Represent human improvements, so it Is understood that humans have flaws, make mistakes. I am truly sorry.
@ThelIluminatii How was Zimmerman acquitted?
@Swafomali @ThelIluminatii @selene1897 That's a simple and great philosophy. I totally agree. But, with my circumstances, it's not that simple and it's just not possible for me. Superman, Hell's angels and no force on, off, in or out of this world or universe that can set me free. I'll be set free when I die.  Heaven!
@ThelIluminatii I believe in supernatural love.
@ThelIluminatii I don't have a love and never had any pride. I believe is supernatural love, but mortal love is non-existent for me. The Kryptonite to my loveless priceless heart would be faith. First hand, humans don't know true loyalty. All my friends aren't human.
The King reigns	The Queen is the champion	The Knights are warriors	The Rooks are diplomats	The Bishops are Merlins	The pawns are soldiers	The player is your heart	The board is your mind	Other team is foe or bro	White pieces, angel on shoulder	Black pieces, devil on shoulder
All family members aren't friends. Friends get some respect and some trust and love. Good friends get greater respect, trust and love. Best friends get unabridged respect, trust and love. My girlfriend will walk beside me, not behind me. In marriage, will walk as one. Chivalrous.
I'm not crazy or cuckoo. I'm depressed. Being in this group home or any group home is the cause of my depression. I am cynical at times. The Illuminati represents hope to me. I'm gonna need help to become free again.
Majority of folks would be able to join. What about those who have unique circumstances? Someone else is my legal guardian, and I'm being forced to live in a group home. I would love to join, I just don't know how. I respect that the Illuminati is a force for good and mankind.
@ThelIluminatii I almost joined the organization. Had a guy said he was master and asked me if I wanted to join. He asked me to buy or pay for an egg from Africa, and stuff. I got some stuff through the email. I have a signed Oath agreement, Sterling silver ring and gold talisman
@ThelIluminatii I agree and like that quote.
I say this... "Blessed be THE Source of the Light."
Technically speaking, Jesus Christ is a demigod. Father is a deity and human mother. The antichrist, is half demon and half human. Antichrist will be the union of Lucifer and a human. It is 2019. The war is culminating. The demigod vs the half demon.
I've been gray all life long. Who would you rather have? The one paid to serve or the one who loves the master? I question who will win the war?
@ThelIluminatii Traditionally, a soldier is paid to serve. Loyalty is as good as rationed currency. Usually a soldier has no relation to his/her leader. I haven't really served darkness, but have avoided the light. I've been in the gray all my life. And gray is my favorite color.
You know the antichrist will be half demon and half human. Since Lucifer is a seraphim, or was.
Maybe I am a nephilim.
Amazing, I haven't been sick in 7 to 10 years. I must have the heart of a Griffin.
Since my two part last Tweet didn't post, go to my profile and read the top two tweets. Ciao.
For a longtime, my life was in darkness. Then I went into the gray. Now I'm in the light. I'm not rich, famous or super, but I'm not sick. I'm not afraid of death. I must be half angel. Out of the 9 tiers of angel, what would I be. None of the 9 tiers of demon scare me either.
Hey everyone. Been a while. I have a new rebuilt self image. There's a thing about me. My enemies have had their way with me, but the war isn't over. As long as I'm still breathing, my king is still on the board. Chess reference.

@TwitterSupport How come I can't follow anymore people? I guess there's a ratio between those followed and followers. Why is it that some people can follow millions but I can't follow more than a few thousand? Why is this?
@Twitter Let me ask a question. How is it that some people can follow millions and I can't follow anymore than a few thousand people? I am unfollowing everyone who doesn't follow me and trying to follow everyone who follows me. Creating a balance. Let me follow more people.

@SteveCarell I am a huge fan. You're a great guy. I'll follow you through the good bad and ugly. I'm loyal to you man. Not good to compare people generally. Johnny Depp 1. Joseph Gordon Levitt 2. Steve Carell you are my number 3. You are awesome. Extremely loyal.
With all do respect, I respect gays. They should have equal rights. But to have Superman played by a gay guy is appalling. Superman aka Clark Joseph Kent loves Lois Lane, who is a woman, on a intimate level. Superman is NOT gay!!

@BLACKWlDCWS I wanna see that. I wanna see Zoe fuck Amanda. Good times.
I'm a huge fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt. As most celebrities are assholes and jerks in general. Joseph Gordon Levitt is humble and a great guy. I recently created an account with his HitRecord. I just released a book I've been trying to publish for years. Please don't screw it up.
@hitRECordJoe I'll check out this HitRecord. You're only 3 years older than me. You've done well. I always respected you as a humble celebrity and still do. You keep being great and take care.
@hitRECordJoe I hope I'm not talking too much. As I said before I am a creative writer but never been published. I have manuscripts sitting on my laptop collecting dust. I almost got published once. They turned out to be a scam. They wanted 700 dollars.That's one a month's check.
@hitRECordJoe I am a creative writer of some sorts. Occasionally I do poetry but my writing is science fiction and fantasy. From DC to Marvel to Star Wars and Star Trek to anything science fiction. I create my own characters and stories. I checked out your HitRecord. Cool stuff.
@hitRECordJoe Joseph... My name is also Joseph. I'm a huge fan. Did you know Heath Ledger as a brother or were you just great friends? Heath Ledger was the Joker in Dark Knight and you were the cop in Dark Knight Rises.Then the movie "10 Things I Hate About You." You are superb.
@ohkailno @wafflefather Nice looking animal. What breed is he? Siberian Huskey?

I'm watching a Robin Williams movie "Mrs. Doubtfire." Robin is my hero even in death. He didn't stand for bullshit or corruption and was humble.That's quite respectable. Johnny Depp is my favorite actor living but Robin Williams is my favorite of all dead or alive. Robin is pure.
@John_C_Depp I am a huge fan and you are the man. You're my favorite actor. You're a living legend. I'm 34 years old but I been watching you act since my childhood. I went back to watch movies before my time starring you. You an inspiration. I'm not gay but I respect you greatly.
@BurgerKing Burger King... It's why you're the King and the best. You serve my favorite sandwich "The Double Whopper with Cheese." Chow!!
Burger King you have my vote. I judge a town's character based on how their Burger King is run. I've been to several Burger Kings spread between North Carolina, Illinois, Kentucky, Connecticut and New York. 99.9% of the time I go in smiles and come out grinning.
Burger King is my favorite restaurant. I give the Burger King in Ahoskie, North Carolina a terrible review. I won't give them a zero. They earned a negative 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. That is bad.
I have a lot of respect for Burger King. In my ruling, if you want to judge a town, inspect its Burger King. I love Burger King. Has my favorite sandwich "the double whopper with cheese." I get one from Burger King in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Bad review on that one restaurant. -5

@hcnrycavills Mr Raman. I know we were discussing Superman mythology but I am also into Marvel. Remember the guy Andrew Garfield that played Spiderman? I share one detail with him. We share a birthday. Garfield's birthday is August 20 1983. My birthday is same only in 84. Does he have Twitter?
@TheSpiderMan35 I hope this is the real Andrew. Mr. Andrew I have something to share with you. We share a birthday. You're exactly one year older than me. Your birthday is August 20 1983 making you 35. My birthday is August 20, 1984 making me 34. I enjoyed you playing Spiderman. Have a nice day.
@ChrisEvans You are the man. The first movie I ever saw you in was "Cellular" and you've played two Marvel characters so far. The Human Torch and Captain America. Even after you finish playing Captain America, I will still support you man. Keep being awesome.

Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else.	-- Judy Garland
Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are.	                                                 -- John Wooden
