As a nation, we’ve long-rejected religious tests for public office and condemned discrimination based on one’s religion. #toleranceisatwowaystreet
Rushing clerked at the U.S. Supreme Court &amp; 2 federal courts of appeal. Her work at the Supreme Court led to letters of recommendation from clerks working in the offices of every Justice who was active at the time, a sure sign that she is fair minded and an excellent lawyer.
No one should use a nominee’s faith or their affiliation with a Christian organization like ADF as grounds for rejection.  That is a de facto religious test for public office, which is prohibited by Article VI of the Constitution.
In Allison Jones Rushing, the Senate confirmed not only a highly qualified lawyer, but a woman of integrity, professional competence, and judicial demeanor.  She has filed more than 45 briefs with the U.S. Supreme Court and worked on more than 50 appeals.
