America can not let this secret coup get away with what they did, they attempted to overthrow a President, there needs to be a special council to prosecute Robert Mueller, James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Hillary Clinton and Barrack Obama 	Rush Limbaugh
Today we need a nation of minute men, citizens who are prepared to take up arms, citizens who regard the cost of freedom as a basic purpose as daily life, and are willing to work and sacrifice for freedom. The cause of liberty and freedom can't succeed with lesser effort. JFK
You cross the border illegally in to Canda to are fined $5k, cross the border in Iran illegally you get 8 years in prison, you cross in North Korea you get shot, you cross the US border you get a driver's license, medical insurance, medical insurance, housing, right to vote, WOW!
Obama declared a national emergency to aid Lybia, to aid Yemen, to aid Ukraine, to aid Burundi, to aid Somalia, and Venezuela, Sudan and central American, Trump declared national emergency to aid AMERICA  wow

Dear members of Congress in regards to any attempt to disarm Americans whether it be through unconstitutional laws, backroom deals, strong arm tactics, we will not obey, our founders warned us of you and wrote the 2nd amendment with you in mind, just so we can keep our freedom
The people that voted for Trump are never going to abandon him, I don't care Mueller does, I don't care what the media does, they elected him knowing who he is, and in many cases they admire him, he is the one person standing in the way of losing our country	He is our President

Radical Islam will not fight us in the street while we outnumber them, they will use our government to control and enslave us. Ultimately they will overtake us. We need to get them out of our government now
In 1947 Congress passed the 22nd amendment limiting the Presiden to two terms. They said too much power for too long is a threat to our freedom. 	IT IS TIME TO LIMIT CONGRESS FOR THE SAME REASON
You know as a taxpayer I personally reject Nancy Pelosi pushing a bill of $35 billion  to cover worldwide abortions, MY TAX MONEY IS NOT FOR MURDER
The best barrier for stoppi g illegal immigration is to stop all benefits to illegal immigrants.  WE AMERICANS OWE THEM NOTHING

I was a registered Democrat but did not vote for Clinton and when Obama ran I changed over to be a Republican and was totally embarrassed over Hillary and now I am so ashamed of the democrats I will never vote for them again and feel sorry for those who do,
John F Kennedy died a true hero, that man even though he was a Democrat would not let the crap going on today happen, he would put a stop to it, guarantee we would have a wall, unlike Obama and the Clintons would not try to give our country away and send funds to terrist countrys

@KindOfGranola @realDonaldTrump If you believe that why did over 3800 troops volunteer as his guards and they had to force troops to guard Obama, so I suggest that you need to get your stuff strait before bashing our President,
