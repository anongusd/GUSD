While we still don't know what happened in that missing time, we DO know she ended up divorcing the husband who was cheating on her, married a hot archaeologist 13 years younger than her and then flew around the world on expeditions with him.
When they found her at the hotel she was registered under the name of her husband‚Äôs mistress and said she had no idea how she got there
Oh and also the Home Secretary asked Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to step in and help solve the mystery while she was missing and he found one of Christie‚Äôs gloves and took it to a medium(!!!)
Originally they just found her abandoned car, coat and ID by abandoned next to a quarry and for almost two weeks everyone thought her husband had murdered her so he could run off with his mistress.

RT @YeahHaus: Out today is our super epic sci fi short for the @verge Better Worlds series. Based on the short story A Sun Will Always Sing‚Ä¶
If you really want to live your values stop asking how you can do better for women from a position of power and start giving them the ability to do it for themselves
Men have asked me, many times, what they can do to make a very unequal world better. I have a five point plan:		1. Give women power	2. Give women power	3. Give women power	4. Give black/POC/LGBT women especially more power 	5. Give women power
@scalzi Man the fragility of men certainly takes on some bizarre contours in the modern age		Show me one man who has ever used the word ‚Äúsoyboy‚Äù that isn‚Äôt a complete insecure piece of shit whose identity breaks into pieces at the slightest touch
@marissadraws @letsgoayo Obviously it‚Äôs horrible but so was literally everything else he‚Äôs ever done		Ringo is a legend but it‚Äôs pretty sad that shitting on anyone but a respected white dude has been de facto tolerated
@marissadraws @letsgoayo It‚Äôs weird how much it takes (not racism, not sexism, not transphobia, but I guess yeah creative desecration) for people to realize that someone is fully worthless and full of shit		I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs telling but it‚Äôs extremely telling
@letsgoayo Wow I stopped paying attention to this for like half a day and it got two orders of magnitude more off the chain		Do you think he feels immense shame and has to just keep going bc he can‚Äôt cope with acknowledging it, bc I do

@ericjschuster @mattzollerseitz It was never about the Russian dude ‚Äî I think he ultimately died given that Tony's business with the other Russian dude continues later. But the ep is really about the relationship between Chris and Paulie and their struggles for power

@loudmouthjulia Don‚Äôt forget Breaking Bad
@ryanqnorth Yes
@lamecliche @angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson Whoops! I've always mixed those two up. Sil never really got a backstory, did he
@steve_lieber I always liked the scenes of Malfi's personal life, and would have liked more. Also, Adriana. Who was she, outside of Christopher?
Anyway that's my explanation of the finale of The Sopranos @angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson
This is the beginning and the end. It's the reason he had panic attacks. It's the reason he went to therapy. He knew, inexorably, he was headed for this moment and he feared it. He wanted to stop it. In the end, he couldn't because he loved something more: power, at whatever cost
Death comes like this for him, the way he always knew it would. He never saw it coming. It tears him away from his family, the deep fear that permeated everything. We never see them scream, or cry, or anything, We wouldn't. Because we're Tony. And we're gone
Then Meadow walks up to the diner. Remember that Tony recently had Phil whacked, in front of his wife and two children. The bell rings, Tony. And then darkness for ten seconds. We've been trained at this point to see what Tony sees when the bell rings. What we see is nothing.
The bell rings. Tony. We see him, and we see through his eyes Carmella come in. The bell rings. Tony. We see him, and we see AJ come in. They sit at the table. A man in a member's only jacket comes in. He goes to the bathroom. This is the only tracking shot in the entire sequence
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson Crucial to this are two other conversations, one that he has with his brother in law where he says, you probably never hear it coming. And then Paulie, who has someone whacked next to him and says, the scariest thing is that I didn't know it happened until after it happened
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson The last episode is a Pavlovian exercise. A bell rings, and we look, and we see. Here's how it works: someone opens the door, we see Tony, and then we see what Tony sees. Someone coming through the door. Again and again and again
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson He could have chosen his family. He didn't. He never did, and that was the primal and defining fear he struggled against since the first episode of the show. The ducks are his family, but not leaving him so much as he is leaving them. Bc he knows how this ends. He is going to die
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson Tony spirals. He reverts. He does exactly what Christopher does in his addiction relapse, but in a different way. He relapses to violence‚Äîironically, in defense of Meadow's "honor" which is really about him ‚Äî and finally he is called to account for the consequences of his actions
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson Then there's Eugene. In an episode called "Members Only" he wears a members only jacket and whacks a guy in a diner with the initials T.S. Then he kills himself because Tony will not release him from the Mafia.
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson He has a near death experience; he sees an opportunity to escape and for a time he does ‚Äî  much like Christopher and his recovery. He relapses. He becomes a gambler, the thing he disdained the most in the first season of the show.
@angrydadgamer @PaulSMattson 		So first of all, this has always been a story about family vs. Family. It's also been a story about whether or not Tony can be redeemed, through therapy or anything else, from his many sins.

And I shouldn't have to say this but of course I wasn't totally responsible ‚Äî comic book discourse owes a huge debt to Sana, Heidi, Brigid, Juliet, Kelly, Kelly Sue, Spike, Jill, Willow, Kate, Chelsea, Greg, Ann, Marguerite, Alison, Marjorie, Aline, Trina, Janelle, and on and on
@feitclub @ThePenDrake @ryanqnorth She actually had a running gag for a long time after The Incident where she posted the most benign things possible just to see how idiots would respond https://t.co/py3iI4IPPg
@oldjetsam Oh, I don't think I deserve all the credit ‚Äî I don't think anyone person does or should. But I think I played an important role, along with a lot of other ppl like Sana, Heidi, Brigid, Juliet, Kelly, Kelly Sue, Jill, Willow, Kate, and on and on. I'm mostly riffing on these idiots
@oldjetsam @dynamofire If we're talking about the same Sana, she's an old friend and someone who deserves a lot of credit for sure
@dynamofire Oops, here's the thread https://t.co/IELg0whuvj
@dynamofire Also, it claims that I am "partially or even entirely responsible for the entirety of comic book journalism going woke feminist over the last 10 or so years"		To which I say, *deep bow* I appreciate this rarely given but entirely true shoutout
Semi-relatedly, here is a KIA thread celebrating the fact that @dynamofire were recently let go from our jobs, which is primarily hilarious to me because one of their accusations is that she and I "hate white people and don't watch Star Trek"		lol		lolololololololol
@twoscooters share share share, here or not on main
@ThePenDrake @ryanqnorth But the important thing is that we allow them to Engage		Engagement √ºber alles
@JustPlainTweets When you've seen it up close for years and years on end, how can you not?
That's not a choice that everyone can make or should have to make. And one of the prices of Twitter's policies is that you have no idea how many voices have been silenced and removed from the conversation in the name of "free speech" because the human cost is too high
I participate in Twitter with full knowledge that if I continue on my current trajectory, there's a very good chance that I will enter this event horizon and my life will never be the same. Really, I'm surprised it hasn't happened already. I continue because I refuse to be afraid
Make no mistake: this is an active decision. Twitter's policies make very explicit choices about whose suffering they are willing to permit in the name of free speech and "engagement." It's almost always the most vulnerable people. This is how Twitter chooses to define itself.
Something I have observed over and over and over again is that there's a sort of event horizon on Twitter, particularly for women/poc/lgbt people, where you become elevated into a target in a way that can never be undone, mostly bc the platform stubbornly refuses to protect you https://t.co/zmw62XEJ95

The first season of The Walking Dead is a tremendous achievement. Tales From the Borderlands is one of the best games I‚Äôve played in the last several years, which I say as someone who gives zero shits about the Borderlands franchise.

@BoldwaterGerry @autieshawtie @KennyFabian @verge i don't expect any sort of good faith response, but do you think that the way a character is written for 15 years has no bearing on its identity? what motivates you so strongly to insist it cannot? would you feel differently if oz said they were gay and Saltzman said the opposite

@darthprovidus It's about maintaining power, like it always is. When so many of these people harassing women/poc talk about "freedom" they're talking about their right to be socially dominant and not consider others. They want to be free, not for others to be
@darthprovidus there's a girl somewhere who doesn't need a prince stop everything
There's no easy way to take any of it apart, but we should all be very, very frightened of it, and how easily the first two groups have recruited the third in ways that are transforming the political landscape of the world in ways that will not be easily undone
Every time you deal with this sort of backlash, you're dealing partly with the bad actors who have a very clear goal, partly with edgelords who want watch the world burn (and have little to lose), and partly with the people who get on board bc the rhetoric "speaks" to their fears
Not all of the people that they reach inherently subscribe to their core ideology, which about maintaining power by pushing and keeping other people down. But they successfully manipulate their anxieties around the growing power of minorities/women to win them to their cause

@mercurialblonde I will say as someone who lived through Gamergate that I never saw things get better because they were ignored, and that mockery was one of the most powerful tools in the arsenal.
@mercurialblonde Is the world better because you did or didn't talk about him, when half the community was already talking about him? Did that visibility make things worse or better? I genuinely don't know
@mercurialblonde It's a complicated question. Is it worth elevating someone ‚Äî who has had a major impact on an entire medium ‚Äî to a national level, just to own them? Clearly he he is begging to be owned on every level. But at its heart the question is about what you make bigger or smaller
@mercurialblonde Ignoring comicsgate or gamergate or any of this bullshit doesn't make it go away, or not in any way I've found. It's fucking pounded into our lives like a stake. The best we can hope for or try to do is to take the sting out of it, to mock it, to laugh in their fucking faces
@mercurialblonde I know people have different opinions on this, but I saw him operating from a position of power at every other point I saw him until this one, where he was mocked and dismissed ruthlessly. Given the enormity of what he has done, I think he was worth dunking on publicly
@taterpie On the most basic level, I came away feeling affirmed and that is what you would want out of any segment that goes trudging into the mud
@taterpie It's something we talk a lot about on my team ‚Äî what we give oxygen to and what you don't. I feel like he was lifted up specifically to be mocked and dismissed, which is a very intentional tactic, and that the overall message was positive

@ShiftlessHobo We have totally different editorial pipelines that work independently! In this case, we just had a different reporter doing the work and we posted it as soon as it was finished, edited and nailed down
@Dave_Hunter when you were arguing with people on that blog were you genuinely trying to persuade or just to mess with them/show them up? plenty of us have taken shots at people who don't like before but the aims and intents are very different from having a discussion or changing minds
@Dave_Hunter life is always going to have gray areas and well-concealed bad actors, but it's usually pretty obvious to a reasonable observer (or anyone who's spent time on social media) if someone is actually trying to talk to you or just fucking with you
@Dave_Hunter Engaging someone in good faith means engaging their ideas sincerely and wanting to hear the response, which has little overlap w/engaging to provoke or upset. It's possible to upset people without meaning to, which can still be shitty, but the intent is v different
@ShiftlessHobo what's the answer
