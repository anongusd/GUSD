Can the relationship between Jared Kushner and @SenatorDurbin end the #Shutdown impasse? @realDonaldTrump plan DOA in Congress. No permanent wall for temporary #DACA.  My column.https://t.co/ul4IxWHh8J
Sad news. Zoe Mikva, an educator and activist, wife of Abner Mikva, dead at 90. https://t.co/T1Whw3pT6m
Founder of #Dreamer movement, @SenatorDurbin rejects @realDonaldTrump   "I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate.... I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues."
GOP Senate leader #McConnell @senatemajldr said after @realDonaldTrump speech he will move a bill next week. But it will take 60 votes to pass, so he needs some Democrats. Highly unlikely.
for #Dreamers: Provisional status for three years for current #DACA recipients, covering 700,000, giving them  access to work permits, social security numbers, protection from deportation. Some current TPS recipients get provisional status for three years.
Details: $5.7 billion to fund a steel barrier system;$805 million for technology, canines, and personnel to help stop  drugs; $800 million dollars in humanitarian assistance, medical support, and new temporary housing; $782 million to hire more agents and judges...
And let's take note: @realDonaldTrump didn't address his promise of #Mexico paying for his wall.
Democrats and @AnnCoulter get to same conclusion, for different reasons: https://t.co/RahAqtOac1
So @realDonaldTrump yanked what were existing legal protections for #Dreamers in #DACA only to use them to strengthen his hand for his wall.
Note that @realDonaldTrump is still holding the wall in exchange for opening all of federal government. Dreamers still bargaining chips.
#DACA deal - @realDonaldTrump only calling for 3 years of relief. Permanent Wall for temporary #Dreamer protections is a non-starter for Democrats.
Latest @realDonaldTrump branding of wall "steel barriers in strategic location..."see through steel barrier on the Southern Border."
Trump said it is "ridiculous" to give "lengthy trials" to asylum seeking immigrants. Let them be processed in "central America."
The temporary #DACA deal @realDonaldTrump is DOA with Democrats. Trump is looking to peel off Democrats by framing Dems who disagree with him as "radical left." "Walls are not immoral"
Now: @realDonaldTrump paints immigrants in caravans not in the U.S. yet - and those who entered illegally - as criminals. "Our immigration system should be the subject of pride...not a symbol of disunity and disfunction."

Not true: @realDonaldTrump saying Democrats "don't care about crime."
"If we declare a national emergency, we have a tremendous amount of funds," re @realDonaldTrump #shutdown and the wall.
Am waiting for Trump administration to produce cash flow analysis of how and when the new proposed Mexico-Canada trade agreement - which needs Congressional approval - will generate billions for the wall.
"I never have temper tantrums, I really don't," said @realDonaldTrump
Latest from @realDonaldTrump - Never meant #Mexico would write check for wall..."China" easier to deal with than #Chuck &amp; #Nancy" .. "I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency." FACT Check: Any benefit from trade deal goes to companies, consumers, not US Treasury

from @MALDEF re #TrumpSpeech  - "message packed with obfuscation, deception, and dog whistles, all in service of a profligate agenda to force U.S. taxpayers to construct an unneeded and expensive monument to racism and xenophobia."
Re @realDonaldTrump blaming the Democrats for the shutdown - He told #Nancy and #Chuck in December, “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it."
"farmers, airport security officials and workers at the Peoria Agriculture Lab are being used as pawns in a partisan fight they had nothing to do with. This is just plain wrong."
from @CheriBustos on #TrumpAddress “Hardworking families are hurting because of President Trump’s impulsive decision to shut down the government –
from @senatemajldr McConnell on #TrumpAddress “Tonight, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our nation’s southern border. His proposal to increase security through physical barriers suits the reality on the ground."
Trump's re-election campaign just sent out a personalized fundraising appeal pegged to the #TrumpAddress - "We sent him a list of all patriots who donated to our Official Secure the Border Fund and he noticed your name wasn’t on the list, Lynn."
Their denial of the humanity &amp; rights of immigrants is driving this administration’s policy agenda, &amp; it is killing people.... Trump chose to compound the chaos because he can’t convince the majority of Americans that their taxpayer dollars should fund his bogus campaign promise"
"President Trump and Secretary Nielsen have lied about border statistics and conditions, continued to push narratives that are proven false, and egregiously distorted realities. ...
from the @ACLU on #TrumpAddress "There is indeed a humanitarian crisis at the border—but it is one of this administration’s own making. Its manufactured security emergency isn’t credible.''
from former Gov. Kasich re #TrumpAddress "The President and the Democrats need to learn how to compromise and put the American people first. It starts with the President putting the country ahead of his politics and being more flexible with his goals."
from @RepSchneider re #TrumpAddress “It is disappointing that President Trump chose to use his first Oval Office address to the nation to double down on his irresponsible demands for an ineffective border wall and prolong a damaging government shutdown."
From @janschakowsky re #TrumpAddress “What began as a campaign gimmick designed to fire up white nationalist crowds, has morphed into a giant poison pill that is impacting the lives of millions of Americans."
....Mr. President, you may have never lived paycheck to paycheck, but many workers do.  Stop picking on these federal employees."
...And we can have a debate about effective border security, but we shouldn’t do it while holding the federal government hostage.  "
From @DickDurbin "Tonight, what we heard from the Oval Office was a desperate attempt by the President to gain support for his medieval border wall.   It won’t work.  Democrats support strong border security.
.@realDonaldTrump talks re humanitarian crisis, which Pelosi and Schumer noted, 'the women and children at the border are not a security  threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President  Trump’s own cruel and counterproductive  policies have only deepened."
Quick analysis of @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi The two Dem leaders were speaking to more than their base in making the case that the shutdown needs to end.
"The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty," not a wall, said @SenSchumer #TrumpAddress
@SenSchumer - "We don't govern by temper tantrum" #TrumpAddress @realDonaldTrump appeals to "fear, not facts." Wants to separate shutdown from debate over border security.
While @realDonaldTrump didn't dwell on shutdown, @SpeakerPelosi does. "Trump must stop holding the American people hostage" with "manufactured crisis"
Now @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi are on. "The President has chosen fear," Pelosi said as she notes, "a wall he always said Mexico would pay for."
Quick analysis of #TrumpAddress - @realDonaldTrump did not use the word wall. Created a false narrative that illegal immigrants are major source of crime. Incorrectly said a new trade deal with Mexico could pay for wall. Injecting "humanitarian" argument.
"To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security" that would include @realDonaldTrump #TrumpAddress
Not true: When @realDonaldTrump says Democrats "won't fund border security." Also of note: Recalibration of his original formulation Mexico will pay for the wall to well, Mexico will "indirectly" pay from an improved trade deal.
Has not used the word wall yet...@realDonaldTrump won't ...says "barrier" requested by law enforcement - but we know it's what Trump wants.
In his #TrumpAddress so far @realDonaldTrump is talking about crime and drugs and traffickers stemming from illegal immigration "crisis of the heart, crisis of the soul" not mentioned shut down yet.... #OvalOffice

Yup, both @JBPritzker and @GovRauner disingenuous answer about transparency at #suntimeselive gov debate. https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU https://t.co/nwBebvFDGn
Who won @suntimeslive governor debate? https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU #TWILL
Asked at #suntimeslive debate about fav TV shows and books: @JBPritzker "loves" #Netflix #Atypical and "Industries of the Future." @GovRauner does not watch much, when he did liked Dick Van Dyke show (ran from 1961-66) Read "The Big Sort" https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU
#Rauner did not pledge to be more transparent in the release of his schedules at #suntimeslive debate. They've been pretty skimpy these past years. https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU #twill
#suntimeslive debate, @TinaSfon asks "How do you stay well, diet and fitness routine and how deal with stress?" #Rauner skates, rides motorcycle, swims. #Pritzker admits lifetime struggle w weight, plays tennis, likes to walk along lakefront. 	https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU
Strategic differences in approach in @suntimeslive debate. @GovRauner more aggresive, pushing corruption and Mike Madigan. @JBPritzker sitting on a lead in polls, is punching less.  Now moving on to underfunded pensions... #TWILL https://t.co/RJVrdPLvrU

Among the details not clear: When does the clock start for the one week delay for @KavanaughVote? It's Friday afternoon. @realDonaldTrump just now said re the one week delay, "I'm going to let the Senate handle that."
FYI to put this in more context: @lisamurkowski has said a few days ago she backed reopening the FBI probe....https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4
If the FBI comes up with no new information about #Kavanaugh sexual misconduct allegations, taking this extra step #Flake forced will be crucial in trying to secure confirmation vote of  Flake, Sen. Susan Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski. https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4
To recap: The GOP controlled Senate Judiciary Committee on a party line 11-10 #KavanaughVote advanced his nomination to the Senate floor only but Arizona Republican @JeffFlake secured a one-week delay to reopen the FBI background investigation. https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4
"SOMEBODY HAS TO EXPLAIN THIS TO TRUMP, AND I GUESS THAT'S MY JOB," @LindseyGrahamSC said. Democrats pressed #Kavanaugh yesterday to agree to reopen #FBI probe and he declined. https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4
.@amyklobuchar said she and @ChrisCoons and others suggested. @LindseyGrahamSC seems ok with this, though not quite sure what exactly the agreement is. But "this might bring the country together" AND....
Yes, this is unprecedented. More moves than Bork, Clarence Thomas here. All because @JeffFlake https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4. "A surprise to all of us," said @amyklobuchar  No investigation - No Flake vote.
The Senate had been poised to do prelim votes Saturday leading to the #KavanaughVote next week. @realDonaldTrump, who does not like @JeffFlake has to decide if he will ask FBI to reopen probe and McConnell has to decide what he will do. https://t.co/g0sHoQ70O4

.@tedcruz is defending the decision not to interview #Kavanaugh witness Mark Judge, because, he said it would be too hard on him because he is an alcoholic, battled cancer and depression and a felon. Very sympathetic to Mark Judge.
"When I hear sanctimonious talk," said @amyklobuchar about GOP grips about delay re #Kavanaugh.. what about "Merrick Garland?" GOP refused to give Obama Supreme Court pick Garland even a hearing.
"Yes, the Justice system is messy. Things come in at the last minute all the time...the question is, what do you do when it happens?" @amyklobuchar  said, re sexual misconduct allegation against #Kavanagh. Ford made a credible claim, it should have been investigated, she said
In these Trump times, #KavanaughConfirmationHearings "not normal," said @amyklobuchar https://t.co/It45jKWvuZ Senate did more for Anita Hill - who got an FBI probe re Clarence Thomas - than Dr. Ford.
.@JohnCornyn interesting approach. Defending Mark Judge, the witness to alleged #Kavanaugh sexual misconduct, who does not want to testify. Said it would be wrong to "drag" him in to testify because he suffers from alcoholism, cancer and depression. Your thoughts on Judge
"I will be voting no on the nomination of Brett #Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court," said @SenatorDurbin.  Chair @ChuckGrassley said the ABA letter will not influence him and will not delay moving ahead.
.@DickDurbin reading American Bar Association request to delay #Kavanaugh confirmation vote until an FBI investigation in order not to erode public "trust" in the Supreme Court.
"I could not understand" @SenatorDurbin said, how #Kavanaugh could say he had no ill will to Ford and then call this "revenge on the part of the Clintons."

"I feel sorry for her," @LindseyGrahamSC saying re Ford. But "in any reasonable standard, under the rule of law, this would not go forward." Graham framing #Kavanaugh allegations as if a potential criminal charge - different from background investigation for a confirmation vote
"I don't think I didn't do anything" unfair to Merrick Garland, said @LindseyGrahamSC because Obama nominated him in a presidential election year. GOP never even held a hearing on Garland.

Re calendars, on why #Kavanaugh did not include going to church on Sunday. Because going to church was like 'brushing my teeth." The calendars r important since, as #Kavanaugh noted "like" a diary, "another piece of evidence in the mix for you to consider."
#Kavanaugh kept detailed calendars since he was in 9th grade. Picked it up from his Dad. So he has the "summer of 1982 documented pretty well." ...If it happened on a weekend night, my calendar shows definitively I was not there." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6

"I've been a good judge..for all my 53 years and seven month on this earth....never a hint of anything of this kind, and that's because nothing of this kind ever happened." #Kavanaugh at #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
#Kavanaugh recalling that he was open to intense scrutiny from oppo researchers when he worked for Ken Starr on Bill Clinton impeachment. #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
#Kavanaugh: "I am innocent of this charge..." His voice cracking, "We mean no ill will." Coming on much stronger than on @FoxNews interview. #KavanaughHearings
#Kavanaugh "I never sexually assaulted anyone..due process means listening to both side." His parents in the room, so is White House counsel Don McGahn. #KavanaughHearings "This onslaught of last minute allegations does not ring true."
#Kavanaugh more push back at Dems, saying the process is fueled by "pent up anger to President Trump and the 2016 election ...and millions of dollars...from outside (left) interest groups. ....coordinated efforts will not drive me out."
#Kavanaugh taking hard partisan aim at Democrats in his statement. @realDonaldTrump said he would be watching. "This has destroyed my family and my good name." #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
#Kavanaugh pushing back hard: "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace...from" advise and consent to search and destroy." Echo of Clarence Thomas famed line that he was subject to a  "high tech lynching." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
#Kavanaugh reading statement he said he wrote himself. Complaining that it took "ten long days" for hearing. His name "permanently" destroyed as a result of sexual misconduct allegations. My impression: He wants his name cleared as much as wanting to be on the Supreme Court https://t.co/F5oF9RM1I9
All set up for judge to testify. #KavanaughHearings. Yes, the Senate has private label water. https://t.co/y9OFQVCvB0
My quick take before #Kavanaugh testifies:  #Mitchell, trying to erode Dr. #Ford credibility nicked her on fear of flying; otherwise Dr. #Ford unwavering in her allegation of sexual misconduct. #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
"History will show you are a true profile in courage," @KamalaHarris  at the #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/yWaPhD1gxG
"You are not on trial," Sen. @KamalaHarris telling Dr. Ford at #KavanaughHearings. Harris: That she reached out to her House member - @RepAnnaEshoo before #Kavanaugh was nominated - to "warn" the White House and is ok w FBI probe bolsters credibility.  https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
Mitchell trying to build a case Dr. Ford got help from outsiders- read that Dems- that's why she is asking now how she choose her attorney...who is paying her legal fees..has anyone (read that Dems) shown her questions in advance. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 #z #KavanaughHearings
.@maziehirono at t#KavanaughHearings slams #Mitchell for acting more like a prosecutor for Republicans in questioning Christine Blasey #Ford...in asking her questions not about the alleged incident but other stuff -who paid for the polygraph? https://t.co/wZ7RNQCDtE
Rachel #Mitchell is trying to chip away at the credibility of Dr. Ford at the #KavanaughHearings
.@amyklobuchar amplifies in her tweet why she wanted the polygraph admitted to the record. https://t.co/t8IaGdOFRM
Important time line point from #Coons: Dr. Ford contacted @washingtonpost (paper that broke her story) when #Kavanaugh name first surfaced as a potential Supreme Court nominee... https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
Does this ring true for you, as @amyklobuchar  is saying, that people remember "what they don't forget" even if not clear about date.#KavanaughHearings. Dr. Ford. #Mitchell. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
@amyklobuchar, a former prosecutor, trying to bolster #Ford credibility by noting she told therapist and husband of incident. "And if someone had made an investigation," her husband would say she mentioned #Kavanaugh's name. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/xolaCY1zz1
Mitchell trying to make the point that #Ford anxiety could have been caused by reasons other than alleged #Kavanaugh attack. Questions taking on adversarial tone. Trying to make her out as a liar because she does not like flying. Backfire potential here. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
My quick take at this #KavanaughHearings break. Mitchell is taking her time in laying the groundwork...for what? To get new facts? Format so far seems only to serve to protect Republican male senators from saying something foolish they will regret. https://t.co/qw2nBKLa66
Here are the three maps #Mitchell is using in questioning #Ford..Where the alleged incident took place, near Bethesda, Md. #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/pF7v9RPBcX
Hearing taking a 15 minute break. BTW...there are no members of the general public here at the #KavanaughHearings Only reporters and people who have been invited. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
Asks @SenatorDurbin to Ford: How certain are you it was #Kavanaugh  Reply " 100 percent." @ChuckGrassley takes exception to Durbin accusing  Republicans of "obstruction." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6  Dems setting the stage for argument that may rise of mistaken identify. https://t.co/CuzfBiFax5
"I'm sorry for what this had done to you and your family," @SenatorDurbin ...The FBI should have investigated your charges as they did in the Anita Hill hearing." #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/qtXfDJaRCu
Keeper quote: @SenatorLeahy to @ChuckGrassley "You and I were both here 27 years ago for Anita Hill. At that time, the Senate failed her." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/y7qcwt6Lde
.@SenatorLeahy also mentions Julie Swetnick and Deborah Ramirez, other women who have accused #Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
RT @CBSNews: "I was too afraid and ashamed." Dr. Christine Blasey Ford explains why she didn't tell her parents of the sexual assault as a…
@SenFeinstein to Ford "How are you sure it was he?" Reply: As sure as she is talking to Feinstein. Now Mitchell is bringing Ford back to the day of the incident "to make sure you thought of everything." https://t.co/0iIW2o69bR
This #KavanaughHearings format is going to be awkward. Mitchell is trying to be methodical in setting a record, but she can do it only in 5 minute chunks, intercut with Democratic questions. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
The reason for the second front door is that #Ford tells @SenFeinstein she suffers clastrophobia as a result of what she said was the #Kavanaugh https://t.co/JZqvvLbfE9
New Jersey Democrat Sen. @CoreyBooker just brought a cup of coffee to Ford. She requested it at the top of the hearing, to have coffee after she read her statement. #Grassley handed his time Rachel Mitchell.https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/9k0Bhcig9c
#Ford at #KavanaughHearings Since Sept. 16, family forced to move out of their home..last Tuesday, her email was hacked.."aside from the assault itself, the past couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/wWOOWNdBzo
Ford at #KavanaughHearings:  agonizing decision to go public. Reporters were at her home and workplace. So she decided to speak out..to the Washington Post journalist who first contacted her and who she trusted to let her tell her story in her own words. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
"Sexual assault victims should decide for themselves" when their story becomes public. Ford at #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
Ford: "Brett's assault on me altered my life for a very long time....I convinced myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should move on." Finally talked about it in therapy...when she and her husband were remodeling..and she wanted a second front door.  #KavanaughHearings
#Ford at #KavanaughHearings "I drank one beer. Brett and Mark (Lord) were visibly drunk. ..Brett "began running his hand over my body...Groped me and began taking off my clothes. I believed he was trying to rape me." https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
On TV, with better audio, you may clearly hear Blasey Ford. At  #KavanaughHearings, in the room, she is speaking in a very soft voice. She is adding another name of someone at the party. A person who the #FBI could have talked to before this hearing.https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/8QNpLWnLUL
.@SenFeinstein to #Grassley et al: "The entire country is watching how we handle these allegations...this is not a trial for Dr. Ford. This is a job interview for Brett #Kavanaugh. Is this the best we can do?" https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/TEoCnWZyme
Putting it on the record: @SenFeinstein asking the FBI to probe Blasey Ford plus two other women with #Kavanaugh sexual misconduct allegations. So this really opens the door for Dems to ask Kavanaugh about the other women, even if they are not testifying. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
.@SenFeinstein "Republicans also scheduled this hearing" without FBI checking out the allegations. FBI did that "routine step" in 1991 for Anita Hill, calling some 20 witnesses over three days. Today, GOPers are not allowing witnesses aside from Blasey Ford. #KavanaughHearings
The larger frame of this, @SenFeinstein noted: comparing the #MeToo movement to the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings 27 years ago.https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
.@SenFeinstein shrugs off Chuck Grassley criticism, saying she was asked by Blasey Ford at first to keep her name confidential. And she did. She did a 'you don't get it' to Grassley when it comes to women and sexual violence. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
You tell me how this looks: Sitting below the 11 white Republican men on the Senate Judiciary Committee is the female they hired to ask their questions to Blasey Ford. #KavanaughHearings https://t.co/smoVn0as1l
Senate Judiciary Comm. Chair #Grassley, a Republican, kicking off #KavanaughHearings by slamming - has not used her name - @SenFeinstein, the ranking Democrat, for not sharing her "secret evidence"  provided by Blasey Ford.  https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
What you may not see on TV right now...there are two rows for about ten friends or supporters each of Blasey Ford and #Kavanaugh. Though they will not be testifying they are wearing badges that say "witness." https://t.co/b6o02QWynK
Dr. Ford just took her seat...she is sitting across from @DickDurbin at the #KavanaughHearings. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/1Cw288jIm6
That's Sen @SenGillibrand, New York Democrat at the #KavanaughHearings sitting next to Alyssa Milano. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/1I4v49kSsl
FWIW...I am in the back of the hearing roo. I am sitting across from former @Suntimes reporter @TomBruneDC now with Newsday. Pictured is @JonathanTamari from the Philadelphia Inquier. Also at my table, New York Times, McClatchy, and the LATimes. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/BKPXolZOL6
Each senator has 5 minutes to ask questions. The Democrats, including @DickDurbin will ask their own. As you see, each Senator has a countdown clock at their seat. Looking at seat of California Dem @KamalaHarris https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/21uz0AnnCv
To combat perception problem at the #KavanaughHearings the Senate Judiciary Republicans -11 white men- hired a female prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell to ask questions. But some GOP members may ask their own questions - keep an eye on Sens. Flake, Graham. https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6
Actress, #MeToo activist @Alyssa Milano is here at the #KavanaughHearings, chatting with reporters. Dr. #Ford has arrived, but is not in the hearing room.https://t.co/wZ7RNQl2C6 https://t.co/RyR1rtdILf
There are a very few seats set aside for members of Congress at the #KavanaughHearings. The first to arrive is @RepMaloney, a Democrat from New York. https://t.co/iQWEoIYvqh
Good morning. Am covering the #KavanaughHearings. To know: 1. This hearing in a Dirksen Senate building hearing room is smaller than the Hart room where the other hearings were held. 2. There will be far fewer seats for the public. https://t.co/Yam0GsZA5D
So nothing to say to young teenage men...
Seems @realDonaldTrump totally did not get the question..Not getting the #MeToo times we are in. Complains "in this case you are guilty until proven innocent...w that being said, I look forward to what she has to say."
Q. What is the message @realDonaldTrump is sending to young men on the eve of the #KavanaughConfirmation hearing about sexual misconduct? Trump choses not to talk about proper, respectful treatment of women...rather riffing on women making false accusations
Question Re accusation from @realDonaldTrump that #China trying to interfere w elections to hurt him; given that, why his praise for Chinese leaders who he says he has a "good chemistry" with?
Trump has an obsession with the #NYTimes
"Would love to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians," @realDonaldTrump . Puts it on par with negotiating over healthcare. Coming out for a two-state solution. Sees it as a "real estate deal." Oy.
Invokes @seanhannity name for third time at press conference.
"The Times. I think they're going to endorse me," @realDonaldTrump said BTW, that is @Yamiche Alcindor, used to be @nytimes, now at @NewsHour
#Trump points to @PBS reporter for a question, saying he is calling on @nytimes.  In his telling, @realDonaldTrump said he was not being laughed at yesterday at the #UN. Said folks laughing with him when he was bragging about his self-described historic accomplishments.
Likes to keep 'em guessing. https://t.co/C3ETcCAxzn
.@realDonaldTrump shrugs off meeting w #Canada #Trudeau.. over trade....Shows almost unprecedented contempt for #Canada. And if tariffs on cars increase....will put "billions" in US Treasury...But who suffers if car prices are higher?
.@realDonaldTrump seems whatever the question, if he doesn't want to engage, the pivot is "con job." He is saying "women are so angry" because #Kavanaugh is being accused of sexual misconduct by other women. Not all women, Mr. President....
.@realDonaldTrump all over the place with this answer.. https://t.co/S8VdHrtPlt
NEWS: @realDonaldTrump says he may delay Thursday meeting w #RodRosenstein so not to distract from #KavanaughConfirmation hearing. Said he may call "Rod" tonight.
On eve of crucial hearing for #KavanaughConfirmation, @realDonaldTrump demonstrates only sympathy for #Kavanaugh and himself, not the victims. What seems #Trump thinking: If people believe women accusing Kavanaugh...then why not give credibility to Trump accusers?
.@realDonaldTrump said women making up "phony" sexual misconduct allegations against him "absolutely" impacts his thinking about #Kavanaugh.
Asked "How are your personal experiences" playing into this, @realDonaldTrump said all "false" accusations --accusing the women of being paid off to say "bad things" about him. "I've had numerous accusations about me...I never met them." Told media to check it out w @seanhannity
And I don't want to ignore that @realDonaldTrump also just said “President Obama wasn’t big on picking judges." Really? Republicans blocked Obama Supreme Court nominee #MerrickGarland
"We want to give them a chance to speak." @realDonaldTrump seems not to know that only one woman of the 3 coming forward is scheduled to speak at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday.
"Don't you understand," a reporter asks. "You have daughters" ..@realDonaldTrump who is slamming the women credibility because they did not come forward when the alleged incidents happened.
Yes, it's noticed: @realDonaldTrump expresses sympathy for #Kavanaugh  and his family and nothing towards the women making allegation except "this is a big con job."
.@realDonaldTrump does not make a distinction between #FBI trying to find out the truth about sexual misconduct allegations against #Kavanaugh...that's one thing...and Democratic opposition no matter what a probe would find.
.@realDonaldTrump said not happy re Fed raising interest rates..first question about why #FBI did not investigate newest allegations re #Kavanaugh. Said they wouldn't know where to go...moving on to calling Dems "con artists."
Riffing....

.@SenatorDurbin asks #Kavanaugh about the "dirtiest" job he had --working construction the reply..to set up a question about labor law in an agribusiness case where "he went out his way" to stick with owner and not "exploited workers." Durbin worked 4 summers in a slaughterhouse.

.@DickDurbin point is that a partisan reviewed the #Kavanaugh records...he is moving on to torture policy...aid holds up a poster..
.@DickDurbin challenges #Kavanaugh to call for the release of his documents from this Bush White House days. He declines. @ChuckGrassley intervenes; #Durbin not sidetracked.

The point @LindseyGrahamSC is making that a president "can pick someone of his own philosophy" in a Supreme Court nominee - trying to get Dems to vote for #Kavanaugh- seems to be nullified because Republicans blocked @BarackObama pick #MerrickGarland from even getting a hearing.

I can only wonder what is going through the minds of Ivanka and Jared as they are sitting in the National Cathedral listening to the #McCainMemorial #McCainFuneral ..3 presidents here and not @realDonaldTrump

.@Obama re #McCainFuneral "That's why he championed a free and independent press," as JFK, Ronald Reagan understood "that what makes this country great" is "adherence to the common creed, that all of us are created equal."

Not even a slap at #Putin for interfering in US election...@realDonaldTrump could not even give Putin a warning about 2018......#Helsinki2018 This is not normal.
That @realDonaldTrump bought #Putin "very powerful" denial of Russian hacking of US elections - that is  diminishing US intelligence.
CNN's @andersoncooper called press conference a "disgrace" on part of @realDonaldTrump for softball treatment of #Putin. Noted that #Trump pivoted to Hillary Clinton when asked about hacking.
#Putin said when @realDonaldTrump was in Russia as a private citizen, he didn't even know about it. Doesn't collect compromising info on everybody...
AP's @JonLemire asks if Russia has any compromising information on @realDonaldTrump or his family. Asked because of @realDonaldTrump longrunning defense of Putin
#Putin now going after Democratic donor George #Soros...Re extradition "please do send us a request." But wants reciprocal treatment for 'persons of interest to us.' #Helsinki2018
Wow...@realDonaldTrump totally deflecting on director question about Russian meddling and why he does not believe US intelligence. "#Putin was extremely strong" in his denial.
@realDonaldTrump handed ball to #MelaniaTrump to give to son Barron. Actually, official gifts usually end up held in the National Archives.
What a touch...#Putin hands #WorldCup soccer ball to @realDonaldTrump Ball now in Trump court, Putin said. #Helsinki2018
Here is some background about Bill Browder, who #Putin mentioned Russians want to interrogate..maybe a swap w hackers.. ...https://t.co/r7emVWlCNp #Helsinki2018
#Putin deflects central question about whether 12 indicted Russian hackers  are Russian intelligence agents. Said 'would look into it." Do you believe Putin knows? #Helsinki2018
#Putin "Can you name a single fact that would prove collusion?" Off point right now, the question is about extraditing Russian agent alleged hackers.	#Helsinki2018
Reuters @jeffmason1 asking if Russians will be extradited...Trump punts to Putin. Says again, "there was no collusion." .."We ran a. brilliant campaign," that's why Trump is president.
@realDonaldTrump says "zero collusion," in the Russia probe and his latest tweets. "It's ridiculous"
Trump corrected reporter who asked about calling #Puting an adversary. “The word competitor is a compliment,” Trump said referring to Putin. Last week Trump said Putin a “competitor” not a friend or foe #Helsinki2018

"This was a very constructive few hours we spent together...sure will be meeting again in the future often," said @realDonaldTrump
.@realDonaldTrump said Meeting "only the beginning of a longer process." Talked about #Syria. #Helsinki2018
.@realDonaldTrump said"Addressed directly Russian interference" in elections' w #Putin.  Said Spent time on it. Said Putin has some 'interesting ideas." Did Trump ask for extradition of alleged Russian hackers? #Helsinki2018
'Our relationship has never been worse than it is now,' @realDonaldTrump on #Russia/US relations. But #Trump said  that just changed because of #Helsinki2018 #HelsinkiSummit
.@realDonaldTrump calling Trump-Putin #Helsinki2018 yielding "deeply productive dialog' Reading so far, not winging. Let's see how many questions they take from the press
News!  Putin said @realDonaldTrump asked about hacking. Putin said "never interfered" in U.S. elections...then moved on.... #Helsinki2018 Trump-Putin
Take notice: #Putin talking about a lot about very specific things...reading from notes.. He is not winging this. Will @realDonaldTrump?
#Putin mentioning cybersecurity, but skirting the hacking indictments of Russian agents. Will @realDonaldTrump go there? #Helsinki2018
#Putin saying Hope to "restore previous level of trust" As nuclear powers have "special responsibility." Trump-Putin #Helsinki2018 #HelsinkiSummit
#Putin said Trump-Putin #Helsinki2018 #HelsinkiSummit  conducted in "Frank and businesslike atmosphere." Interesting Putin speaks first.

RT @CNN: Former FBI Director James Comey will sit down with CNN's @jaketapper for a live interview on Thursday, 4p ET. https://t.co/lgkPMPL…
#JamesComey BTW..not calling for @realDonaldTrump impeachment because it should be up to the American people..
Interesting: #JamesComey not calling for @realDonaldTrump impeachment...
In some ways the #ComeyInterview tracks his congressional testimony ...
#Comey.... "He has no credibility and President Trump was right to follow through on the bipartisan calls for him to be fired.”  2/2  Republican National Committee rapid response ....
Just in from RNC Chair McDaniel, playing off of title of #JamesComey book:  Comey "publicity tour reaffirms that his true higher loyalty is to himself. The only thing worse than Comey’s history of misconduct is his willingness to say anything to sell books...1/2
#ComeyInterview "Values matter. This president does not reflect the values of this country."
Is @realDonaldTrump unfit to be president- @GStephanopoulos #JamesComey "Yes….morally unfit to be president…who lies constantly about things big and small…"
My analysis: Reason #coming giving for not releasing memo himself..too many reporters...is lame. What did you think. Lame or good answer
#Comey did give an unclassified memo to friend to leak to journalist. ...to try to get a special counsel.. Kudos to @GStephanopoulos pressing Comey on why not just release the memo yourself.
What #Comey did on the plane ride back to DC after learning he was fired: "drank red wine in a paper cup." #ComeyInterview
Day of firing in Los Angeles, "The rooms had televisions on the wall when..with words Comey resigns:" tHe sees the screen change to "Comey fired." #ComeyInterview
Now this: Stormy Daniels, #JamesComey will be on @TheView this week...separate shows.. On Monday, #Stormy lawyer said she will be in NYC courtroom for #MichaelCohen hearing. All stories are one.
May 9, 2017: @comey finds out he is fired from tv report: "How can that be?" #ComeyInterview
Maybe should have said  to @realDonaldTrump you can't ask me that, @Comey reflects.....#ComeyInterview
#Comey Recapping now famous episode in Oval Office, alone w @realDonaldTrump after kicking out #Pence, #Sessions asking re Flynn probe.. "I hope you can let it go"
BTW...What @abcnews is showing now are excepts from a five-hour #ComeyInterview with @GStephanopoulos
Maybe a mistake when asked about loyalty. @Comey said he promised "honest loyalt" ' Maybe should have just said he can't promise. Was a "compromise." #ComeyInterview #JamesComey
And the dinner table talk: A series of "monologues" Even alone w #Comey, @realDonaldTrump talking about his inauguration crowd size. This is the dinner where Trump tells him "I need loyalty."
When #Comey arrived for a dinner with @realDonaldTrump he didn't realize they would be alone. Got down to business before the shrimp scampi. @GStephanopoulos
About that famous blue room scene: #Comey tells @GStephanopoulos it was about "dominance"
Interesting: #Comey wife supported Hillary Clinton, with daughters attended the women's march after the inauguration.
#Comey asked by @GStephanopoulos - “Can you assure people that the Obama Justice Department was not protecting Hillary Clinton?”	 .@Comey: - “Yes. The FBI drove this investigation and we did it in a competent and independent way. I would bet my life on that.”
What was it like to be #Comey?  It "sucked."
When Russia collusion #FBI probe started, was not about @realDonaldTrump #Comey saying
Consistent to what #Comey has been saying... https://t.co/LRrhB6ZoMa
What voters did not know at the time Comey went public with Clinton: That the #FBI was probing Russia..and already had #papadopoulos in scope.
#Comey "Will bet his life" that the Obama administration was not rigged for Hillary Clinton.
#Comey pushes back- gently - the @GStephanopoulos asking (telling?) him about his ego..
After that Lynch tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, #Comey said he had to separate himself from the Attorney General.
#Comey agrees with @GStephanopoulos that the Clinton email investigation was going to be trouble.
Just in case you needed the clarification... https://t.co/9dFBn5Oiev
#Comey...When a kid, an armed robber broke into house....
#Comey "I don't know whether the president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing.. could be" @realDonaldTrump "somewhen for whom the truth is not a high value."
Now on to celebrated quotes released early about telling @realDonaldTrump about prostitutes in Steel #dossier Said Trump,  "Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?"
#Comey  talking about "flashback" in meeting @realDonaldTrump to the "mafia...."felt" like "we were all part of the messaging." "Very strange to suggest president to mob boss.
#Comey first impression of meeting @realDonaldTrump -  hair "highly coifed" must "take a lot of time in the morning."
#Comey interview kicking off: Comey tells @GStephanopoulos that he did not vote in the presidential election. Because he was the #FBI director.

"Most Speakers don't go out on their own terms," @SpeakerRyan saying. Longest serving GOP Speaker J. Dennis #Hastert  R-Ill. at the time did not leave on his own terms. (nothing to do with why he went to prison)
Interesting: @SpeakerRyan making point that he could have run in November and if he won say he was resigning, making it easier for GOP to keep southern #Wisconsin seat, but that would not be right.
"I am going to look back proudly" at days at Budget and House Ways and Means chair. Going to "run the table." Paul Ryan @SpeakerRyan #Speaker

So this turned out not to be true..@realDonaldTrump ended event without asking for questions.. Sitting still for questions=News conference. Trump took a few shouted questions on way out...Even a Trump announcement about a news conference is subject to a fact check. https://t.co/W3v9yZnJjN
He can say it but it does not make it true: @realDonaldTrump saying re  #Omnibus that Democrats "did not want DACA in this bill" ..."Republicans much more on your side" Dems "using you." It's #Trump who ended the DACA protections @BarackObama installed.
Waiting to see if @realDonaldTrump takes questions...
Still frustrated with Senate rules, @realDonaldTrump asking for two things he is highly likely not to get: a change in the filibuster rules that require supermajorities to pass stuff and a line-item veto.
.@realDonaldTrump signing #Omnibus he said "no one" read, a bill he is "unhappy with." Inaccurately blames Democrats for not including DACA relief in bill.

More from @BarackObama on gentrification worries: Not really a South Side problem, he says. Not like "all these folks from Lincoln Park pouring into the South Side."

At meeting, @BarackObama takes a swipe at #Chicago media for reporting on critics of Obama Presidential Center development, suggesting those reports give too much attention to critics. This at a meeting while zoning application pending in City Hall.
The Obama Presidential Center will be "something that outlives me and Michelle." @BarackObama at planning meeting in #Chicago. To unnamed critics "So there are going to be some people who will (not) be happy and sign up for every single aspect of this project.
"There are kids on the South Side who don't even think about going downtown," @BarackObama on "stretching" Chicago all along Lake Michigan.

Kennedy #SOTU "Folks, It would be easy to dismiss the past year as chaos. Partisanship. Politics. But it’s far bigger than that.  This administration isn’t just targeting the laws that protect us – they are targeting the very idea that we are all worthy of protection."
Kennedy in Democratic response "Bullets tearing through our classrooms, concerts, and congregations.  Targeting our safest, sacred places. And that nagging, sinking feeling, no matter your political beliefs: this is not right.  This is not who we are."
Rep. Joe Kennedy on now Dec #SOTU "We are here in Fall River, Massachusetts – a proud American city, built by immigrants. From textiles to robots, this is a place that knows how to make great things."
.@realDonaldTrump calls for giving cabinet secs the power to "remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people." Will have to see how this is defined.
Red meat alert. Without direct reference to #NFL players taking a knee, @realDonaldTrump says "We proudly stand for our national anthem" IN ALL CAPS IN SPEECH TEXT #SOTU2018
Trump makes it seem these things are at odds: "faith and family" and "government and bureaucracy" #SOTU2018 #sotu
"This is in fact our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American dream" @realDonaldTrump #SOTU2018
.@realDonaldTrump @POTUS: issues call "To set aside all out differences…seek common ground" Do you think this will happen?
#SOTU "We have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous vision to make America great again for all Americans."

Sen. Graham vow to DACA recipients: "We're not going to leave you behind. I don't how this movie ends, but you're going to be taken care of."
RT @NBCPolitics: WATCH: Sen. Graham says President Trump was not "well-served by his staff" before White House immigration meeting https://…
"The president I saw on Tuesday was the guy I play golf with" said Sen. Graham after Senate hearing. By Thursday noon things changed. "Cannot do this" with staff members "with an irrational view on immigration" he said.
The two crucial hours last Thursday: @realDonaldTrump open to a first phase immigration deal with Graham and Durbin at 10 am but by noon when they got to White House off track. What happened? Trump "not well served by staff," Graham is saying
Sen. Graham  to Nielsen ..trying to get the negotiations back on track...supporting @SenatorDurbin while keeping channels open with @realDonaldTrump.
Deal with DACA  folks "fairly and with a sense of compassion" said Sen. Graham, telling Nielsen, "I think Dick Durbin is one of the best people you ever could work with" - even if he is a "liberal Democrat."
"This has turned into a S-show" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, urging @realDonaldTrump to call him --but don't- as he did during primary campaign..give out his number.
Sen. Lindsey Graham pressing Nielsen on how a meeting with @realDonaldTrump and @SenatorDurbin and him..following a cordial conversation..turned into something else by the time they got to the White House.
Now Sen. Lindsey Graham quizzing #Nielsen..and the tale of the "two Trumps" the Tuesday Trump and the Thursday Trump who used vulgar term re immigrants from African nations and others Lindsey: ."As we go forward, how does this movie end? What it going to happen"
Re push from @realDonaldTrump to use #Dreamers for big immigration package: @SenatorDurbin to DHS Sec Nielsen “To put the entire burden of immigration reform on the shoulders of these DACA recipients is fundamentally unfair, not practical &amp; jeopardizes their future &amp; their lives"
"To put all of immigration reform "on the shoulders" of DACA is not fair..."we gave you every penny you asked for." @SenatorDurbin
.@SenatorDurbin noted that Dems offered $1.6 billion for border security in deal..but was "Physically, legally impossible" to do what @realDonaldTrump wanted..pay for wall in one payment. https://t.co/EBQgIonkJe
Nielsen said did not 'specifically remember" what @realDonaldTrump said about African countries" @realDonaldTrump called them "shithole countries"
DHS Sec. Nielsen said she heard Sen. Lindsey Graham use a profanity..but that was, as @SenatorDurbin noted..in response to what @realDonaldTrump said.
What was that "strong language" @SenatorDurbin to DHS Sec. Nielsen. She was struck by "general profanity" said Durbin did not use profanity. Durbin trying to pin her down. She says some "cusswords."
Very dramatic: @SenatorDurbin to DHS Sec. "recall to the best you can..about immigration from African countries to the United States...how did he characterize those countries from Africa." https://t.co/EBQgIonkJe
.@SenatorDurbin at hearing - before grilling DHS Sec. Nielsen is introducing #Dreamers ..."That's what this debate is all about." https://t.co/EBQgIonkJe
DHS Sec. Nielsen to @SenatorLeahy said she did not know if #Norway population mainly white and sparred over meaning of "pay" when asked if there were arrangements for #Mexico to pay for border wall, as promised by @realDonaldTrump. This at at Senate Judiciary committee hearing.
DHS Sec. Nielsen grilled by @SenatorLeahy over whether she heard the word (he did not repeat"shithole")  or something "similar"  w @realDonaldTrump at meeting she was at gave a narrow answer: "I did not hear that word" though "tough language" was used.

Sorry, @realDonaldTrump said "hell," not heck. Speaking about violent crime to new cops at FBI National Academy he said, "And you look at what's going on in Chicago. What the hell is going on in Chicago? What the hell is happening there?"
To new cops at #FBI academy @realDonaldTrump slams Chicago crime again: "and if you look at what is going on in Chicago, what the heck is going on in Chicago....this anti-police sentiment is wrong and it is dangerous and we will not stand for it."
Does @realDonaldTrump use of the word "yet" in talking about a pardon for Michael Flynn suggest to you....Trump has not ruled out a Flynn pardon? Or something else?
More @realDonaldTrump -Q " ..a pardon for Michael Flynn?" A" I don’t want to talk about pardons for Michael Flynn yet.  We'll see what happens. Let's see.  I can say this:  When you look at what's gone on with the FBI and with the Justice Department, people are very, very angry."

Now we know for sure: Trump tweet tease about tapes pushed #JamesComey into leaking his version of events.  https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Convinced fired "to change" the way the Russia investigation was being conducted, "A very big deal," #JamesComey 	https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
"I know I was fired" because something about the way conducting Russia investigation "irritated" Trump #JamesComey 	https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Duh. Is firing FBI director good way to make investigation go away? #JamesComey: 'Doesn't make a lot of sense to me' https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Comey outed the source he lined up to leak his memo... https://t.co/41NTpUjB3g
Interesting: @jamescomey said turned over his copy of memos to Mueller; dups he gave out re leak may exist. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Interesting: @JamesComey regards Russian Ambassador to US Sergey Kislyak more a diplomat than a direct spy https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Refuting: #JamesComey said he never initiated a call to Trump, contrary to what @realDonaldTrump said. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Russians "will be back" to tamper w future elections said #JamesComey no matter the party. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Sen. Blount scolding #JamesComey for using an intermediary to leak, and not just go on the record himself. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Breaking: Comey says no reason Senate Intel Comm could not see all 9 memos Comey wrote after meeting w Trump. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
To #JamesComey from Sen. Heinrich "Why should we believe you?" https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
#Comey "No fuzz on this whatsoever"  Russians interfered with our election.."That's about as unfake as you can get." https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Candid: #JamesComey: After Trump said may be tapes, he wanted his side out, so he arranged for leak to reporter.  https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Noting: Obama administration never warned states about hacking. My story on Illinois hacking https://t.co/h0oF6aMhgW
Ya can't make this up.....https://t.co/zCZh37POVy

Breaking Cubs scoop from @Suntimes https://t.co/J3OJ7jLt3R
Rubio to Comey W all leaks, why never leaked president is not under investigation? (Which is what Trump wanted out)  https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Ball in Trump court: Where are the tapes? https://t.co/zCZh37POVy #JamesComey
#JamesComey "Lordy, I hope there are tapes" of Oval Office meetings, which Trump has hinted exist. https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Interesting self-reflection: #JamesComey said it was "cowardly' not to stand up to Trump  https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Feinstein asks Comey why he just didn't tell Trump in Oval Office he can't talk about Flynn. "Maybe if I did it again, I would do it better"
#JamesComey to Feinstein: believes Russian investigation is the reason he was fired. #ComeyHearings
Is this really the day for Melania to do this: Sent out Trump campaign email	raising money off of Trump upcoming June 14 71st birthday.
Your bet: Will the underlying #JamesComey memos become public? 		https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Important: #JamesComey deliberately wrote memo about Trump meetings in such a way so would not be classified, easier to get out.
Dramatic: #JamesComey knew something big happening when Trump asked to speak to him alone; knew he would have to remember everything.
Interesting: #JamesComey concludes that Trump realized he asked him to stay on as #FBI chief and "didn't get anything for it."
Now we know what Trump whispered to Comey in the now famous Blue Room clip per Comey: Looked forward to working with you
Warner said will be looking at #JamesComey memos for the record. Looks like we won't be getting them out in the open in this hearing.
Significant, said Warner, that Comey never felt need to document few solo meetings with Obama, GWBush. #ComeyDay 		https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Warner to #JamesComey on why he took notes on Trump meeting: Because of Trump "nature," ..."Thought he might lie" about meetings.
#JamesComey said it again: Bill Clinton tarmac meeting w AG Lynch influenced how he handled Hillary email probe #ComeyDay
Background to this:  Reluctance of Obama administration to call out Russian interference in the election. #ComeyDay  https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
#JamesComey became aware of Russia cyber intrusion in 2015. 		https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
Worth noting: So far, #Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Burr asking crisp questions looking for facts https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
#JamesComey not ready to say Trump obstructed justice - Flynn BTW was in "legal jeopardy" https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
#Comey: No doubt Russia tried to intervene in the election, DNC &amp; "in the cyber intrusion in the state voter files" https://t.co/zCZh37POVy
#JamesComey Trump team lied about me.
#Comey: Even though appointed to a 10-year term understood I could be fired" Trump told me "I was doing a great job.."
"This is not a witch hunt. This is not fake news." - Warner #ComeyHearing https://t.co/8zt62aywDH
Understatement from Warner "There is a lot to investigate" #ComeyDay
Warner getting to the heart of the matter with Trump: "Asking the FBI director to drop an investigation" re Flynn, Russia. #ComeyDay
Warner noting Russia ties w Trump associates, including Kushner, Manafort, Flynn and Trump's "odd" affection for Russian leader #ComeyDay
Warner "This hearing is not about relitigating the election" Here because "Russian spies" sought to "highjack" the election. #ComeyDay
GOP Burr stresses bi-partisan nature of Senate Intelligence Committee, work w Dem Warner. We'll see how the questioning pans out #ComeyDay
And BTW...looks like Burr wants to get into the Clinton email decision on #ComeyDay at Senate Intelligence Committee w #JamesComey
Burr :"The American people need to hear your side of the story," Burr to Comey. #ComeyDay Notes panel is doing probe behind the scenes
And we're off #ComeyDay Burr tells Comey hearing is his chance to "set the record straight"

EPA Chief Pruitt comments come off as over the top effuse praise of Trump with scant mention of danger of carbon emissions.
Trump: Paris Climate Accord  'hamstrings' US. Trump emphasis on need to "reassert'  U.S. "sovereignty"
Second time Trump talking about Paris Climate Accord as a scheme to "redistribute" U.S. wealth.
"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," Trump on Paris Climate Accord. https://t.co/sVScSXvZ5c
Trump puts little stock in global warming crisis: Paris Climate Accord is really a "mass redistribution of U.S. wealth."
Trump: "Willing" to negotiate our way back to Paris. BIG CLAIM;  he can do 'better" than Paris Accord #ActOnClimate
"We are going to be environmentally friendly, but we are not going to put our businesses out of work," Trump on Paris.
Trump saying the Paris Accord is less about the climate than about other countries getting a "financial advantage" over the U.S.
Seems like @realDonaldTrump sees w'drawal from Paris climate deal as a jobs for coal miners program. Cites PA, WVa.Ohio - states he won.
"I happen to love the coal miners," @realDonaldTrump. Paris Climate Accord pushs renewable energy solar and wind energy, not fossil fuels
Trump said in Rose Garden he will try to negotiate another deal as he announces withdraw of Paris Climate Accord.
"As of today, the United States today will cease all implementation" of Paris accord" @realDonaldTrump  Rose Garden  https://t.co/sVScSXvZ5c

The keeper quote from wild #TrumpPressConference:  “The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake."
Incredible #TrumpNewsConference wraps up...clocked in at 1:17:05
“I didn’t come along and divide this country” Trump said.
Trump asking April Ryan - a reporter - if she wants to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus #TrumpPressConference
"There are two Chicagos as you know" One that is safe and the other "worst than the Middle East."
"You go to some of these inner city places and it is so sad....they lock themselves into apartments..." #TrumpPressConference
"We are going to be working very hard in the inner cities..." #TrumpPressConference
April Ryan asking Trump about his HBCU order coming out this afternoon and his urban agenda..
"I think she is going to be a fantastic first lady...helping her will be Ivanka.." That's news re Ivanka.
Melania working on "women's difficulties." "..and the things they say are so unfair..."
Asked what is Melania Trump doing for the country. "Now that's what I call a nice question," Trump said.
DACA "it's a very difficult thing for me." Will be issuing a new travel ban exec order tailored to court ruling
Asked about DACA, the Dreamers: Trump said it's a "difficult" "tough" subject for him. So what will he do?
Trump asked about anti-Semitism. Trump complains question not friendly, "insulting."
Trump says he is looking for a "friendly reporter" to call on...
AP Julie Pace: Asking for yes or no - Anyone during course of election have contact w Russia?
...and 'the only problem we had was a bad court. The rollout was perfect"	Where to start....
Taking question from BBC reporter, Trump says, 'that's another beauty.' Asked re travel ban &amp; Trump says rollout was 'very smooth'....
"Does anyone really think Hillary Clinton will be tougher on Russia" than he would, Trump says.
"I want to do the right thing for the world," Trump says. He's been briefed. Told, "Nuclear holocaust would be like no other"
Trump taking questions from all the network reporters. Contrast to last two pressers taking q's from just a few conservative outlets.
"The false, horrible fake reporting by you people" Trump tells reporters, makes it harder for him to make deals w Putin
Trump: As he has said before, "If we can get along with Russia, that's a positive thing."
"The whole Russian thing, that's a ruse," Trump says, a media plot diverting attention about leaks
"I won, I won," said Trump. Praising chief of staff Reince Priebus
Never, ever, seen a presidential news conference like this. Trump says Friday headlines will be Trump "rants &amp; raves" And you say....
Trump asked by CNN Acosta to explain how he can say the"Leaks are real but the news is fake"..."the tone, Jim".
Trump: "You look at Schumer and the mess he's got over there." All Dems "can do is delay." Running out the clock on Merrick Garland?
Trump says he views #CNN and sees "hate and anger"..."I don't mind bad stories when they are true."
ABC's Jon Karl on the leaks: Are they fake news? Trump: "The leaks are real." But "the news is fake." To ponder.
Trump- "I've called the Justice Department to look at the leaks"
NBC's Peter Alexander to Trump: "Why should Americans trust you?"
Trump is wondering why reporters are not calling him before doing stories.
Following up on morning Tweet, Trump declares, "Russia is fake news"
Regarding ousted Flynn, Trump said he didn't tell Pence "the facts and then he didn’t remember &amp; that just wasn’t acceptable to me”
Trump says the press "should be ashamed of itself" for reporting leaks.
After a 24-minute opening statement, Trump takes question from #NPR	@MaraLiasson
"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine," Trump said. Flynn? Puzdor?
Trump just can't stop talking about his Electoral College win.

So far...@netanyahu avoided answering Trump request about holding off on settlements for "a little bit." #Israel
.@netanyahu floating idea with Trump for a "regional" approach. Would take in "many, many countries," Trump said.
Crucial to paving way to peace: @netanyahu first, PA has to recognize the right of Israel to exist. #Israel
1 state? 2 state solution? Trump says he can "live with either one." Up to what #Israel, Palestinian Authority decides.
Wow. Trump tells @netanyahu he would like him to hold off on settlements -a giant issue for Netanyahu - for a "little bit." #Israel
