With first 🛣 win agst ranked team since before I can remember games (2008), Maryland has a *fairly* easy schedule closing out, which should hopefully make them a 4️⃣ seed in both B10 Tourney and March Madness! Go Terps! #FearTheTurtle https://t.co/ID0kb2IY16

@JohnKasich @KarenKasich He’s SO relatable. Someone’s drawing from the playbook of @ewarren
@RepKinzinger ISIS and Hitler have a lot in common. 1930s Germany and 21st century have very little in common. You can call Assad an “enemy,” but he himself is not a major threat. Regime change in Syria would be a disaster, and that’s the point @TulsiGabbard is trying to make.

@mehdirhasan I’m not saying that Brennan didn’t make mistakes for not calling out Trump when he lies, but you have an unreasonably high standard here for being harsh on Trump. Of course, my main point is that Brennan is being harsh on Trump in the wrong ways.
@mehdirhasan CBS intv isn’t a bunch of “softball” ?s. There’s only a short time, and she shouldn’t be debating him, just factchecking. When she insinuates that he’s an idiot for ending wars, that’s not soft on him. Fox’s soft on Trump. This isn’t the denunciation you want, but she’s not soft

@gregpmiller Trump is secretive regardless of Putin. As a private businessman, he got used to being very shady. As president, he’s had to deal with many leaks(eg phone calls with 🇲🇽&amp;🇦🇺 leaders). This guy tears official documents into pieces. This only emphasizes his disregard for transparency

@bethanyshondark @benshapiro I actually like the idea of having a short segment on a daily news show that is lighthearted. Just because one segment a day isn’t “newsworthy” doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth covering. I think it’s important that we have a break from taking heads shouting at each other

@benshapiro Kavanaugh was one of Trump’s worst decisions. He was enthralled in a scandal, doesn’t care about the 4th amendment, and cares too much about precedent. He’s a Bush/Roberts Republican down the line; he’s not a real conservative.
@jonathanvswan Wouldn’t be surprised if Meadows already knew he was being considered since he passed up another term as chair of the Freedom Caucus and Oversight Committee ranking membership
@ThomasEWoods I don’t think this divisive and childish discourse will end up diminishing the presidency. I think that it will end up with each party trying to augment its own power. With the courts on the GOP’s side and the media on the Dem’s, they’ll bypass the Constitution and ⬆️ gov’s power

@politico Does Miller think that it is important for the GOP to elect more women? Also, What does she think the reason is woman are generally less conservative than men?
@politico Does Rep.-elect Spannerger view herself as a DC insider that will act like an “establishment” politician, or does she view herself as a newcomer who wants to shake up the status quo and significantly change the way Congress works?
