@DeborahLenoreS1 @KamalaHarris Across the river from me in Charlestown, Indiana the water &amp; water system is causing an awful brown color and looks as if it’s raw sewage. $5 Billion could possibly fix the water system in Flint, MI and other areas with situations like this.
@KamalaHarris I’m beyond not shocked Trump would rather spend $5 Billion on a Wall and not the American’s that are living homeless. Sadly this is including out very own Men and Women that hasn’t transitioned after they return from service.

@Johnathan981968 @1kathyr @SenKamalaHarris @IvankaTrump Plus apparently you’ve been either sheltered or under a rock. Men go to Planned Parenthood to get tested and medication for STDs since they don’t want their wives to know about the affairs they have. If you don’t know, then please STFU.
@Johnathan981968 @1kathyr @SenKamalaHarris @IvankaTrump Planned Parenthood isn’t just a for an abortion, birth control, testing for STD’s by both men &amp; women, but it’s also there for women who have other healthcare needs when our insurance isn’t good enough for some doctor offices. https://t.co/qou8FnQm7c

@Budhahess @ProofBlog @SenKamalaHarris Exactly, prevents cancers, and helps with medical care for unknown reasons. I had to go on birth control in my late teens to help with heavy periods. They choose to give their full insurance and that should include women’s preventative medicine or healthcare.
Nobody and including Hobby Lobby has no right to say what’s ok for a woman. Especially a men who thinks they’ve got the authority to. No company should have the to say what goes for a woman’s body. Jerks sometimes Birth Control is medically need for women or an abortion. https://t.co/WHgCKGSTTC

@cyncynj @Johnathan981968 @SenKamalaHarris Women are amazing and capable of so many things to just sit at home to raise her children. Now should she wants to have a strong career as well, then don’t shame her. In today’s society both has to work to afford decent housing, food, and at times one vehicle.
@TylerOl25141041 @SenKamalaHarris I did look in the mirror to see a strong independent woman that is done with MEN that thinks it’s okay only to live by their rules and guidelines when it comes to our amazing bodies. We grow humans in our bodies and you’ve got is diarrhea of a thumb to body-shame me. #womenhaters
@Johnathan981968 @SenKamalaHarris I think it’s a form of child abuse when she withholds a her children from a good father and I think the courts need to change things with every other weekend craziness. Children should be able to spend with good fathers as much time with their mother.
@HelenMCollier4 @SenKamalaHarris I’m Pro-Life with my body, but doesn’t give me the right to judge another woman’s choices for her body. Abortions are sometimes a must have procedure and nobody is asking tax payers to pay for it.
@Johnathan981968 @SenKamalaHarris You don’t have a female body and men vote that your not able to get not only the best care so we can carry those children in a healthy way. No government officials or men had the right to say what a woman can or cannot do with her body. Sadly men will never understand our bodies.
@SenKamalaHarris With myself having PCOS and Fibroid Tumors. No man should ever tell me I can’t get my healthcare covered. With this Supreme nomination it’s not only going hurt Planned Parenthood, but the right to choose what’s best for a woman’s body. #trumpsclowns
