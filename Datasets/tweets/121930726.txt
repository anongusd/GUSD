@emrazz I‚Äôve worked in intensive treatment as a therapist for a few years. Approx 80% of my female clients have been sexually assaulted. PTSD, suicide attempts, depression, &amp; attachment issues are all very common for these women. I share that knowledge when confronting other men.
@emrazz I rarely witness men being abusive towards a woman in front of me. But I hear misogynistic comments, objectification, &amp; rape culture are quite common. I usually directly confront them in private since shaming usually makes them defensive and gets us nowhere.
@emrazz A therapist trainee/friend started with the ‚Äúlots of women fake rape‚Äù BS. I gave him the stats, appealed to his own personal history, and told him he would never be a therapist if he spoke &amp; believed those things. It took a few hours but he thanked me.

@xjrh20xx @yourfeminstboss How's this for equality.  85% of domestic violence is committed by men.  And being triggered is when a rape survivor relives her rape.  It's a symptom of PTSD that can take years to change.  Using it to win an argument makes you the definition of an asshole.

@kidboston @joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Not true.  Not even close.  Ethnicity is not a predictor of intelligence.  I would suggest browsing google scholar.  It will prevent you from making these types of mistakes
@kidboston @joeedh @MarkSKrikorian No because it's a very stupid argument
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian That last part sounded more like Breitbart than politico. Throw a little emotion into the argument and people start to show their actual views.  Far less logic than you attempted at the beginning.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Nothing you have said suggests that. You appear to share the far right wing immigration policy. Although you have tried to shave off some of the racism with economic rationalizations. Though unconvincing. To your credit it did take 4 tweets before the white nationalism came out.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian White privilege isn't just about money.  And I think you're motivations are clear, even if your rationalizations obfuscate your actual views.  Nice talk üëçüèª
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian There it is.  Didn't take long.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian So by your logic, restricting the supply of people of color, you decrease their power.  Which is the conservative mission, to reduce the number of non-white immigrants.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian What does that even mean?
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Power in the labor market is a question of resources.  Not demographics.  Conservative immigration policy is about keeping the country white.  Nothing coming out of the White House of GOP caucus suggests otherwise.  Making this about balance is naive.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Those wages are a function of undocumented status and lack of access to resources of regular citizens.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Look at the difference in Florida.  Cubans got amnesty, Haitians didn't the difference is inescapable.
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian Yes it has.  Anything else?
@joeedh @MarkSKrikorian You need to look up the definition of gas lighting.  It has no application to your argument.  And your assumption about Dem motivations is faulty.  Democrat immigration policy is based on compassion, equality, and a desire to make the country more diverse.  Votes are irrelevant.
@Gentile_Sama @MarkSKrikorian Making immigration policy based on racism?  If you don't already know, I doubt I could convince you
