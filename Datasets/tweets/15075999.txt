Finally, the U.S. has consistently opposed the “big 3” among authoritarians —PRC, Russia and Iran. We are most concerned with the dictators that threaten us or our region, as Maduro’s extraordinary repression and failed state policies threaten Columbia/Brazil and entire region.
The more @AmbJohnBolton and @SecPompeo appear on the airwaves and explain @realDonaldTrump national security strategy, the better. But they need more time to explain. Example: I’m not sure how many millennials even know what the reference to “Monroe Doctrine” means.
“This is a new experiment in public diplomacy,” says @AmbJohnBolton of his tweets re #Vemezuela. He added “In this administration we aren’t ashamed of the term ‘The Monroe Doctrine.’” That’s the perfect response to @jaketapper questions about relations w/ other dictators. https://t.co/6Q4XlIt91Z

3. It could prove an interesting opportunity to revisit the non-delegation doctrine, and if Dems in House want to repeal the 1976 act in its entirety, then I would be urging every R to vote yes on that as re-establishing Article I powers. But we shouldn’t turn a statutory process
2. By contrast, the action by President @BarackObama was to suspend enforcement of law pursuant to a vague nullification authority implied in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Opposing the policy of this @POTUS is fine, but this isn’t a constitutional show down moment.
1.

Some critics of Neomi Rao suggest her defenders are indifferent to Roe/Casey and the pro-life issue. Here’s my column from last week on the path to reversing both via #SCOTUS decision soon: https://t.co/VxwXeZNSC2 Support for Rao is in no way inconsistent w/ pro-life views.
the @SenateGOP reputation on its central job and achievement. The consequences of rejecting an extremely qualified nominee who is also a woman and a minority would be high and very damaging to 2020 candidates like @MarthaMcSally.  Keep the tent big and the personal attacks few.
The @SenateGOP can of course begin now to weigh in on future #SCOTUS nominees but not at the cost of a brilliant legal scholar and experienced administrator. The cost to “rule of law” conservatives as a consequence of internecine battles is enormous, and defeating Rao would hurt
The discussion of substantive due process is a fine one to have, but idea that administrative law expert Rao is unqualified b/c of “doubts” about her views of Roe is absurd. She would have zero authority over Roe (or Casey) but considerable authority over out of control agencies. https://t.co/wdFVyeBAyy

First day of vacation and I hear about a whispering campaign against one of the best nominees to federal circuit courts @realDonaldTrump has made: #NeomiRao. As it is the WH and @SenateGOP is vulnerable to lagging in appointing women to bench (nudge nudge @CPLiebau).
FYI @SenateGOP: My interview with D.C. Circuit nominee Naemi Rao from 2017: https://t.co/98n46PGGlQ What a colossal error to reject this extraordinarily qualified nominee at this critical juncture when the “rule of law” project already faltering. Political fallout would be huge.
She is w/o question one of “rule of law” conservatives leading authorities on cabining regulatory excess. Not a surprise if we discover attacks on her are coming from the left. What a disaster to reject her, and it is injurious to “rule of law” protect to indulge this whispering
The attacks on Neomi Rao represent a fundamental failure to appreciate how crucial her confirmation would be to the fight against the regulatory state. Wholly aside from the politics consequences of rejecting a superbly qualified women who is a minority, it’s just plain dumb.
First, believing such random comments is as bad as buying into the slanders of Justice Kavanaugh. Second, lower courts are bound by #SCOTUS rulings. Third, the effort to restrict abortion via lawful constitutional reform will advance with Judge Rao on the D.C. Circuit. https://t.co/brc1mpZ3lm

6. And what’s amazing about @realDonaldTrump getting slow rolled on judges is that his record there will go a lon way to re-elelction. Delay in Q1 2019 can mean failure in Q4 2020. And the loss of @SenateGOP majority as well.  Self-inflicted wounds of the most astonishing sort.
5. Them keep @SenateGOP and @SenateDems in town on working until backlog completed and negotiations w/ blue state senators complete or abandoned along with their traditional prerogative to plac some on state’s federal district court.  @realDonaldTrump is getting slow rolled.
4. I’ve left on vacation but @kurtschlicter @MarkDavis @RadioDoneRight and @EdMorrissey will keep focus on this while I’m gone + @senatemajldr will keep pushing. @realDonaldTrump ought to demand a list from his WH/DOJ Judges team as well, and start hammering. Want to win at 9th?
3 And there is astonishing logjam at WH. @realDonaldTrump rightly complains about 9th Circuit but not only does he not jam @SenateGOP, his own DOJ, WH Counsel’s Office and WH Personnel can’t even get nominees for Circuit up to Senate. Can’t conclude negotiations w/ @SenFeinstein
2. No issue has higher priority for @senatemajldr but not so with his colleagues who are simply unbelievably indifferent. The proposed rules change on time of debate for district and circuit nominees has been languishing for a year. @RoyBlunt promises action and nothing happens.
1. Not one federal judge has been confirmed by the @SenateGOP since December 11, even though there are 6 vacancies on the 9th Circuit appeals court and 25 district court vacancies!  Discussed w/ @LindseyGrahamSC Friday: https://t.co/AWN0L92cZ1 But this is a @SenateGOP issue.

Culture warriors demand that you care. They demand  you be part of the solution, and if you’re not, you’re part of the problem. When this spirit takes over, there’s no one to appeal to for your grievance, because everyone is in on the new crusade or too afraid to say they’re not.

It has not been a transition useful to the long term prospects of the Republic.
The document that was proposed was then sent to state ratifying conventions amidst vigorous public debates (including the Federalist Papers and the anti-Federalists responses) and those conventions were exercises in persuasion. Today we have performance art and confrontation.
What Dr. Larry Arnn, president of @Hillsdale, repeatedly emphasizes is that the genius of the Constitution emerged only after four months of closed-door, often intense debates wherein everyone tried to persuade everyone of their views, and in which compromise was necessary.

5. Point is: Make the choice!  Don’t make the easy ones hard, and if @realDonaldTrump wants to win the reluctant Trump voters again in ‘20 he needs 50 circuit court judges and 100 district court judges to go with his 2 #SCOTUS picks. Rebuilding the military and saving the Bench
4. There is one more 9th Cir nominee to be made from CA. It is wholly the president’s choice. So @realDonaldTrump should make it. Maybe Jim Rogan who’s a fine CA judge who was blocked for federal beach by @HillaryClinton, or Andy Guilford, or the smartest 40 year  old Federalist
3. And @realDonaldTrump has to call AG Barr in and WH Counsel Cippolone and remind them that @POTUS is @POTUS b/c of judges so they need to get the nominees up to the Hill. Priority number one all around and it’s a shared massive failure all around but especially on 9th Circuit.
2. It seems like @SenateGOP has backtracked on changing rules re debate time so @senatemajldr is just going to have to keep them there for a few months and 6-7 days a week to clear the backlog. Those judges are everything to rule of law, esp in age of nationwide injunctions.

If @realDonaldTrump and team give @SenFeinstein a deadline for a list of district court nominees and she doesn't meet it, then @LindseyGrahamSC should take up the pure @POTUS slate and explain that, like an NFL team who misses their window on draft day, she's out of luck.
IF @SenFeinstein refuses to negotiate in good faith or come up with a list within a time certain, say a month, then @realDonaldTrump should just nominate and @LindseyGrahamSC proceed w/o her, establishing that intransigence in the process dissolves the "blue slip" courtesy.
Yes, one or both senators have a role in the appointment of district court judges. Thus it has always been and thus it will always be.  But @SenFeinstein can identify 3-4 of her picks for the district court and @realDonaldTrump and his team can match them. The package proceeds. https://t.co/ofj0UovNP7

It is absurd to allow the “blue slip” to cripple CA federal district courts when there are scores of qualified generally apolitical candidates for the trial court who would make fine judges. Leaving any 9th Circuit seat empty is just nuts. #PickTheNominees.
There are 8 district court, 1 circuit court vacancies in CA with no nominees: https://t.co/1rASzkMBgW. The latter should be a priority for @realDonaldTrump and a deadline given @SenFeinstein for a list of acceptable District Court nominees to which @POTUS would add his own.
Proud to have been long-time supporter of @RichardGrenell. He’d be great at U.N., and if he doesn’t go b/c of his central role in Europe and vis-a-vis Iran, send @robertcobrien, Grenell’s longtime friend and colleague at U.N. under @AmbJohnBolton.  https://t.co/Yf1vwsCudd

And of course they can’t hold hearings on nominees who haven’t been sent up. DOJ/WH Personnel/WH Counsel should all have a spread sheet and a timetable that wraps up in July of 2020 w/ every vacancy filled. Malpractice not to be planning. But no such plan exists.
The @SenateGOP and Manhattan/Beltway media elites consistently —over decades— underestimate and even dismiss how crucial the judges issue is to “base.”  @senatemajldr gets it. But the Caucus?  Their actions impeach their answers about resolve. #GetItDone. https://t.co/1SCxm6UJJC
Mr. @POTUS, tell the @SenateGOP to fill the vacancies on the 9th Circuit!  Get your staff to send nominees for every vacancy!  You don't have to lose every case and won't if you get nominees up and GOP gets off its hands. https://t.co/uxtCkstc8v
And Senator @RoyBlunt: Keeping the "debate" rule at 30 hours for a circuit court nominee is a major fail.  If the @SenateGOP caucus opposes. lets have a vote so we know who.  You folks are punting away the majority in 2020.
What is incredibly frustrating is that challenges to @realDonaldTrump often are filed in 9th Circuit, which has so many circuit and district court vacancies.  It's like playing in the NFL w/ 7 on your side, 11 on the other. C'mon @LindseyGrahamSC: Get the 9th Circuit nominees up.
It must be driving @senatemajldr nuts.  He knows the need to change the rules on debate, and not just for district court judges but also circuit court judges.  The @senjudiciary teed up a bunch of district court judges but are waiting on the rules change so they each take 2 hours https://t.co/gQTYfLlxs3
The @SenateGOP has been talking about changing the rules for two years.  They promised to do it this month.  Not happening, and the rules proposal itself back-tracked on change to the time of debate for circuit court nominees.  It is like they want to lose their majority in 2020. https://t.co/IhqerwpO2s
Which members of the @SenateGOP won't vote to change rules generally, and which specifically oppose moving the circuit nominees along briskly?
The @SenateGOP caucus seems bent on losing its majority in 2020 by not doing the one thing it can do and do expeditiously; Confirm judicial nominees.  Not a single confirmation in 6 weeks, but three recesses.  @senatemajldr has done everything he can but it is time to name names.
This is the week the @SenateGOP was to have changed rules for time of debate for nominees but it is off the rails because somebody decided it was ok for Dems to continue to obstruct circuit court nominees w/ 30 hours of "debate." @senatemajldr knows the score, but the caucus?
That's not a direct answer to a very direct, important question.  Former Acting Director McCabe has evaded every pointed, serious question: Who talked about the 25th Am?  When? Which Members of Congress "knew?"  When were they told?  By whom? Basic, key questions he won't answer. https://t.co/mr0PU4en0Z
Up next: @HotlineJosh and I discuss the @SenateGOP failure to move to confirmation even a single judicial nominee in 6 weeks!  12 appellate nominees, no votes.  46 district court nominees, no votes.  And scores of vacancies w/o nominees! Key issue for @realDonaldTrump re-elect.
And btw: The very best candidate to replace 2d Circuit's Judge Jacobs is @CPLiebau.  How many former managing editors of Harvard Law Review (Princeton undergrad, head of @YankeeInstitute, former Senate staffer) do the @SenateGOP get to vote on?  @FedSoc should weigh in.
From @DavidMDrucker on the U.N. vacancy: @realDonaldTrump should nominate @RichardGrenell or @robertcobrien as both the Ambassador to Germany and the Special Envoy on Hostage Affairs are quickly confirmable. Both are eloquent and experienced. Easy and significant win for @POTUS.

Playing excerpts of @realDonaldTrump speech in Miami yesterday. It’s the biggest story by far this week. @POTUS is preparing —it seems to me— to drop flag on the military option, whether led by Colombia and/or Brazil with or without U.S. support.
Negotiating with Democratic senators over "slates" is fine if on a hard deadline.  This is central to @realDonaldTrump re-election.  The WH personnel shop, WH Counsel's office, DOJ and @LindseyGrahamSC have to get going. Incredible not one confirmation since 1/4/19.
Not 1 of 12 appellate or 46 district court nominees have been voted on yet this year.  There are also scores of vacancies for which nominees need to be announced.  When a sitting judge has announced intent to take senior status (like 2d Circuit's Judge Jacobs) get nominee named. https://t.co/tHDKfzgwLD

@NPRinskeep Fair observations. Comprehensive border security requires massive investment at ports of entry, tunnel detection technology —and border barriers. And unless we abandon interdiction completely and thus unleash an even greater tidal wave of these drugs, we have to embrace it all.

Courts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject. [Footnote 4/4] Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution, 24
3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter. 23
measures on independent presidential responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables, rather than on abstract theories of law. 22
but there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. Therefore, congressional inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least, as a practical matter, enable, if not invite, 21
and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who might attack it.		2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, 20
it usually means that the Federal Government, as an undivided whole, lacks power. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, 19
for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth) to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional under these circumstances 18

Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress. We may well begin by a somewhat over-simplified grouping of practical situations in which a President may doubt, or others may challenge, his powers, 16
it also contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government. It enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but reciprocity. 15
The actual art of governing under our Constitution does not, and cannot, conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles torn from context. While the Constitution diffuses power the better to secure liberty, 14
And court decisions are indecisive because of the judicial practice of dealing with the largest questions in the most narrow way. 13

And then, he became my boss as the deputy attorney general of the United States. And I will tell you that universally, while we all loved Larry Thompson, who was his predecessor, when Larry left, we thought wow, the President got it right again.
We were both U.S. attorneys, neighboring U.S. attorneys. He was in Manhattan. I was in New Jersey. And we worked on matters together. And I found Jim to be smart and funny and tough, and a really good lawyer.

"But there is more to Herman's story.		A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American Soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth." 3
“'To me,' Joshua recalls, 'the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky. They came down from heaven.'		I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik." 2

Was it the shock? What was it that made them so upset?” 7 The answer from @chrischristie is interesting but not as interesting —and unfortunate— that two close friends were done b/c of politics. That’s never happened to me and I’ve scores of close D friends. That’s different.
HHI remember at Orange County, you were doing a Lincoln Club dinner.	CC: Yup.	HH: And I understand a lot of people were angry with you. I got to stay in Switzerland through the whole campaign, but boy, were people mad at you, because you were the first big deal endorsement. 6
CC: (laughing) I don’t know. It’s a long time away, and I would hope that when some of the passions of the moment subside, that Meg and I could become friends again, because we’ve been friends for a very long time.	HH: You came out here, and you worked your butt off for her. 5
HH: You want to expand on that a little bit?	CC: Well, I mean, listen, she, Meg doesn’t have an interest in repairing it. I’ve tried.	HH: So do you expect if you were to go in 2024, she’d get back on the horse? 4
I was in the green room at ABC with Greta, Matt Dowd, and you when the statement from her denouncing your endorsement of President Trump arrived. You turned white as a ghost, Chris Christie.	CC: Yeah.	HH: Have you repaired that relationship?	CC: No. 3
HH You may not recall this, at the 2012 Convention in Tampa, I introduced Meg, who introduced you to the California delegation.	CC: Yes.	HH: You two were very close.	CC: Yeah.	HH: She was your campaign finance chair. She should have been the governor of California, in my view. 2
My interview w/ @ChrisChristie today was long, and full of very interesting asides and diversions. This one about @MegWhitman is especially interesting to me b/c it shows how politics can sunder friendships, even close ones:		HH: I want to start with Meg Whitman. 1

a Republican who does not replace a woman with a woman, or an African-American w/ an African-American, and somehow make it seem as if that choice was not based upon consideration of all the available candidates, but that somehow it means you’re anti-woman or anti-African-American
does he have to replace Ginsberg with a woman and Thomas with a minority? Is that just the way, are we locked into a Court that’s driven now by race and gender?	CC: I think so. I think so. And I think unfortunately, especially for a Republican, because the media will go after
“@Chrischristie: What I would tell you is if I don’t think there’s a way to beat Mike Pence, then I won’t run.	HH: All right, now looking very near term. Does President Trump, if Justice Ginsberg were to retire, or if Justice Thomas were to retire,
“HH: Did Comey win Donald Trump the election?	@ChrisChristie: I believe that Comey was the single biggest factor in changing the momentum after Access Hollywood and before the election.	HH: So that’s a yes.	CC: Uh-huh.”  https://t.co/8HrlllzC9h
“HH:  I don’t think @realdonaldtrump is a racist. Do you?	CC: No.	HH: Why not?	CC: Because I’ve known him for 17 years, and I’ve seen him interact with people of every different race and ethnic background, and have never seen him treat people with anything but absolute respect.”
I thought the SC was AAG for Criminal Division under 41, then private practice as administrations changed, then back as line prosecutor under 42 in SF, then tapped for FBI by 43. Don’t think “fired” is how I’d describe United States Attorneys turning over at end of administration https://t.co/qj6YQc6u0N
with some of the stuff he’s done since then.” https://t.co/8HrlllzC9h
Sally Yates was there, was not compromised.	HH: Yeah.	CC: Sally Yates should have been making those decisions and those announcements. But Jim believed that Jim could do no wrong. And that’s where he got himself in trouble, and you can see that manifesting itself to today
and try to get him fired. And I’m like well, what are we doing here?	HH: Yup.	CC: Now you know, he can say whatever he wants about how Loretta Lynch was compromised. And in fact, she probably was. But she’s still the attorney general.	HH: Sally Yates.	CC: That’s not the point.
[I]f the FBI special agent in charge in your district held a press conference without you there announcing that they had recommended that you not prosecute someone, what would you have done?	HH: Yeah.	CC: And they, exactly, they all said we would have gone to the FBI director
CC: No.	HH: Isn’t that the bottom line?	CC: It’s the bottom line. And you know, it would be like, and I said to any of my U.S. attorney colleagues who initially tried to defend Jim on that, my former colleagues, I’d say to them:
HH: Well, let’s pause there for a moment, Governor Christie, because again, I’m a DOJ alum. The Rosenstein memo was 100% correct. I was on with Joe and Mika the morning it came out, and I said yeah, he should be fired. FBI doesn’t decide who gets prosecuted in this country.
and who isn’t, and instead of just saying no prosecution and ending it, but then excoriates the person who he’s telling everybody he won’t prosecute, if any of us had ever done a show like that in our district, we would have been fired within 15 minutes by Jim Comey.
HH: Hero complex.	CC: Yup. And he became a different person. And I will tell you this, and I wrote this in the book. If we, if any one of us had ever done what Jim did vis-à-vis Hillary Clinton, which as an FBI director comes out there and announces who’s going to be prosecuted
He picked the best among us, and he picked Jim. But then, when Jim had that incident at John Ashcroft’s hospital bed, much discussed, where he stood up to Al Gonzales and Andy Card…	HH: Gonzales, right.	CC: He changed. He began to read his own press clippings and believe them.
And then, he became my boss as the deputy attorney general of the United States. And I will tell you that universally, while we all loved Larry Thompson, who was his predecessor, when Larry left, we thought wow, the President got it right again.
We were both U.S. attorneys, neighboring U.S. attorneys. He was in Manhattan. I was in New Jersey. And we worked on matters together. And I found Jim to be smart and funny and tough, and a really good lawyer.
HH: Let me ask you a little bit about Comey. Do you know him	@chrischristie: I do very well.	HH: What’s up with him?	CC: Listen, this is a guy who changed in the years that I knew him. When I first met Jim Comey, it was 2002.  https://t.co/8HrlllzC9h
HH: Yup.	CC: …and absolutely takes no prisoners.”
After a short period of time, he calls Eric Holder, who is at that time the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, and asks Eric for a job prosecuting murder cases on the local side of the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. This is a guy who just loves being a prosecutor…
Bob Mueller takes no prisoners. Bob Mueller, remember, this is a guy, Hugh, and this is all you need to know about Bob Mueller. U.S. attorney in San Francisco in the Bush 41 administration, he is fired along with all the other U.S. attorneys when Bill Clinton becomes president.
Re SC Mueller: “Many say he’s absolutely incorruptible, you can trust him. Do you agree with that?	@ChrisChristi: I do. I believe, and I’ve told the President this. I believe in his integrity and his honesty. But I also told the President he’s an assassin. https://t.co/8HrlllzC9h

You may not like the policy, but it isn’t an argument to say his doing so will lead to unconstitutional actions in the future. All executive actions get judicial review if any individual is injured. (A landowner whose property is “condemned” for barrier would have standing.) 10
“Slippery slope” arguments are usually —though not always— bad and it is a bad argument here. If @realDonaldTrump has the power via a statute (and it appears he does), his using it would not legitimize unconstitutional presidential actions past or future. 9

I’ve looked at the law. It’s not, actually. It’s not a Youngstown Sheet and Tube sort of situation there. There’s a law on the books that has been used repeatedly in the past. Would you support the President using a national declaration in the event that no deal emerges? 3

And so I think we probably should go ahead and do it." --@JimInhofe.  That's news when the chairman of the key committee changes his mind on establishing a new branch of the military. @realDonaldTrump wants it, but Congress decides it.
Did I misunderstand? You’re against it, or you’re for it?	JI: No, I said I started out against it, and I think now the best argument is that we’re giving the impression that we’re not as involved in a space force as our competitors are.
And so I think it’s, it’s all right with me if they want to do it, but I started out on the other side of this thing.	HH: That’s news. That’s a big deal.	JI: I hate to start, I hate to start another bureaucracy, because I know what happens.	HH: But you know that we, so wait.
And the fact that they have their own comparable, something that you’d call a space force, and if we don’t, and we’re trying to do it with our existing assets, and maybe doing just as good a job, it’s still not going to, it doesn’t give the impression that we are.
We’re doing a good job in space. We are doing, and some of the people that are working there have done a good job. And I think one of the main reasons...but I think it has some merit, that everyone else is looking at us, and they’re looking at other countries.
From yesterday's interview w/ @SASCMajority Chair @JimInhofe:	Do you support a new branch of the military as the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the space force?		JI: You know, I started out on the other side of this thing for what I thought was a very good reason.

The #VenezuelanSpring has a leader in Juan Guido, but does it have "a place," as there was in Eygpt during the Arab Spring in Tahrir Square, Alexanderplatz when Berlin Wall crumbled?  Where are the students gathering, the symbolism of the freedom revolution.
"Look for this one to move fast," says @stavridisj.  Audio and transcript of this wioll post this hour.  Send it around to anyone who is, or ought to be, interested in #VenezuelanSpring, which should include every freedom-loving America. https://t.co/rHu3PwqCGw

"The tyrant isn’t entirely alone. Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Hezbollah stand with him. Havana runs the counterintelligence network charged with controlling the Venezuelan armed forces and brownshirts.

The Rs and Ds are sending 17 members of Congress to the immigration reform/border security negotiations. They can do a deal if Rs ask Ds for their wish list on immigration and a draft bill, then provide an edited response w/ deletions, additions and edits.  That's how to do it.

Read the whole thing.  It's about Corsi and Wikileaks, but who are the people inside the Trump Campaign? It's plural: "STONE spoke to multiple	individuals involved in the Trump Campaign." Have those people testified before Congress/grand jury?  If they lied about Stone? Toast.
“Spoke to my friend in London last night. The payload is still coming.”	c. On or about October 4, 2016, STONE told a high-ranking Trump Campaign official	that the head of Organization 1 had a “[s]erious security concern” but would release	“a load every week going forward.”
a. On multiple occasions, STONE told senior Trump Campaign officials about	materials possessed by Organization 1 and the timing of future releases.	b. On or about October 3, 2016, STONE wrote to a supporter involved with the Trump	Campaign,
” STONE falsely and misleadingly	answered, “I did not.” In truth and in fact, and as described above, STONE spoke to multiple	individuals involved in the Trump Campaign about what he claimed to have learned from his	intermediary to Organization 1, including the following:
The key paragraph in the indictment of Stone:	STONE’s False and Misleading Testimony About Communications with the Trump Campaign	35. During his HPSCI testimony, STONE was asked, “did you discuss your conversations with	the intermediary with anyone involved in the Trump campaign?
What was Stone thinking when he testified under oath before the House Intel Committee?  That all the agencies of the government didn't have and couldn't get his emails and texts? Key Q: Who is contact at Trump Campaign. @realDonaldTrump hoping its Manafort and not Corey L.
Hopefully the smartest 6 senators  --3 GOP/3 Dems-- and the same from the House just go round the clock.  The Homestead Act was 1500 words long.  This can be the same. Keep staff out of room.  Offers should be made that neither side can refuse. "Never let a crisis go to waste."
The Stone indictment will take up the 24-72 hour news cycle, which means some space for Senate and House negotiators, along w/ @VP, Jared K and Dir Mulvaney, to fashion a "go big" bill that gets the long, strong, double layered fence, e-Verify, non-citizen status for 10 million.

Homestead Act.  Paralysis comes from overthinking and from fear, not of the base in both parties, but of the fringe. Legitimate reformers like @SenTomCotton @LindseyGrahamSC and Portman and 3 counterparts from Ds along w/ smart House Ds and Rs like Jim McGovern can get this done.
Provide for the barriers, provide for the @robportman border security endowment, regularize everyone in the country without permission who can make a case to county level boards, sever family migration from this group, perhaps expand merit visas, and do it in 8 sections like the
The Homestead Act of 1862, for goodness sake, was less than 1500 words and set in motion 1.6 million individual claims on land, nearly ten percent of all government held property, for a total of 420,000 square miles of territory. There have got to be a dozen legislators on Hill.
Some in Administration favor this.  Others just want to get out of a jam. But “going big” is only path other than surrender by Ds or Rs. https://t.co/JTT9y2Zpjg Name the drafters: 6 senators, 6 representatives and @VP, Jared K, Dir. Mulvaney and draft something big.
Great summary, but by no means clear declaration of emergency at border would be struck down.  Preferable to have a deal, a big one. Ds are missing opportunity to address all the undocumented and Rs the opportunity for real border security/immigration reform. https://t.co/wnt6pIGwsN

Imagine if President @BarackObama had acted towards Iran’s Green Movement in 2009 as @realDonaldTrump and @VP Pence have done Tue and today towards the people of Venezuela?  Iran might be free today instead of the world’s leading exporter of terror and oppressor at home.
@PatrickRuffini Adding: Pray for Venezuela and it’s people, fighting for freedom, risking all against a ruthless secret police.
RT @PatrickRuffini: If your focus is on what happened at the Lincoln Memorial and not on Venezuela, reevaluate your priorities.

I'm neither "winning" nor "losing," but "reporting" on a key set of questions that have nothing to do w/ SC Mueller, whom I esteem b/c of reputation and his service, but for whom I have a question: What standard fires Strzok and keeps Weissman?  It should be articulable. https://t.co/0lz7bljLlS
"Ahmad and Weissmann would go on to work for Mueller, the special prosecutor overseeing the Russia probe."  The SC felt he needed to fire Strzok.  Why not Weissman and Ahmad?  Did they disclose this to SC Mueller? https://t.co/AcfgjybtBM
"Those he briefed included Andrew Weissmann, then the head of DOJ’s fraud section; Bruce Swartz, longtime head of DOJ’s international operations, and Zainab Ahmad, an accomplished terrorism prosecutor who, at the time, was assigned to work with Lynch as a senior counselor." https://t.co/aWrKtvYWcZ
The question. @MZHemingway, is what is the standard that SC Mueller is using that led him to fire Peter Strzok but retain Andrew Weissman?  I know Weissman's reputation is as a ferocious and extremely competent prosecutor, but he clearly is now part of the story.

"Three top Senior Justice Department officials, two who are senior prosecutors on Robert Mueller’ Special Counsel, met with Bruce Ohr in the summer of 2016, well before the FBI sought a FISA warrant on a Trump campaign official." https://t.co/6vyrsTeorm
If @realDonaldTrump isn't tweeting about this article soon --https://t.co/mluPOaCeS3 it just means he hasn't seen the @RudyGiuliani-@ChrisCuomo exchange yet.  (3)
It is indeed a blockbuster.  It is stunning.  It means that DOJ and FBI conspired to commit a fraud upon the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  Ask yourself: If you were a FISC Judge, would you have wanted spelled out what Bruce Ohr spelled out to everyone?  Of course! (2)
I'm one of the few people in media --@MarkRLevinshow is another-- who routinely handled FISA applications. My desk was the last stop for such a warrant application to AGs Smith and Meese. W/that experience in mind, you can assess my conclusion on this story (1)

based on another story that the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump in May of 2017. Were you shocked by that, Senator Cotton?	TC: Well, I won’t necessarily credit a report that appeared in such an anti-Trump news source, Hugh.
And I would add that the President is opposed to the Russian pipeline to Germany. I mean, it doesn’t, there isn’t an iota of evidence of this. But the Manchurian candidate narrative has taken hold when in fact we ought to be looking at the Seven Days in May narrative
All those things are objectively contrary to the interests of the Kremlin.	HH: And I would add that when the Russian mercenaries came over the hill in Syria, the American military had standing orders that Mattis ordered executed through Dunford, and they were wiped out.
or get tough on Europe’s dependence on energy in Russia, or to encourage NATO, which is explicitly designed to stop Russian encroachment in Europe, to spend more money on their common defenses, to spend more money on our defense.
I’d further say that if you take a look at what the President has done over the last two years to Russia and its interests, it’s kind of a strange claim to make. I mean, for years, we asked the Obama administration to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine,
But as many Democrats on that committee have said, there’s been no evidence that demonstrates any kind of collusion between the President or his campaign and the Russian government or their intelligence services.

@LahavHarkov Thank you. Off to airport already! Too short a visit but @AmbJohnBolton sets the pace for the journalists w/ him. Wonderful welcome by every single Israeli and extraordinary help from staff of  @Netanyahu and career foreign. Every American who can come should to this amazing land
Thus @realDonaldTrump is invested w/ a veto. If we’d used your approach minus the filibuster in the closing weeks of the last Congress, there’d be border barriers funded and no shutdown. But I like the extra-constitutional legislative filibuster too. Slow, but liberty-protecting
Good morning from Jerusalem Preet, where a parliamentary system functions that way. But of course our Framers wisely did not want a parliamentary system but 1 of slow process and frequent conflict, “faction against faction.”  Messy, but effective in preserving individual liberty. https://t.co/txZuz9P9Yh

We’ll be talking about the nature of the withdrawal, the continuing presence of very strong us and coalition forces  in iraq, and the president’s determination not to see a resurgence of ISIS in Syria or Iraq after the withdrawl ttakes place.”
Syria. particulalrly the kurds but everybody who has fiught with us, is not put in jeopardy by the coalition withdrawal .it’s a point the rpesidnet has made very clear in his discussions with pres Erdogan fo turkey. And we’ll be discussing that here and what that means.
and other ISIS personnel and facilities that r potentially dangerous to us as we leave.	It’s also very important that as we discuss with members of the coalktion, other countries that have aninterest like isreal and turkey that we epxect that those who have fought  w/us in Syria
“And certainly encompassed in that is it’s very clear we’re going to withdraw, we want protect american forces during the withdrawal period. But the president also expects we woyld be able to accomplish the destruction of the ISIS territorial caliphate
