CBS instant poll on Who won the debate - Obama 53% Romney 23%
Mark Shields says Romney's best points were on China. Resonates with Midwest
Chris Wallace says #Obama was slashing and personal. #Romney was big picture.
Brit Hume praises Schieffer's performance. Says Romney was smooth and fluid on foreign policy issues. Effectively used economy
Steve Hayes says #POTUS was being disrespectful. Risking looking un-Presidential
Joe Trippi calls this debate "the big hug" #Romney agreeing with POTUS more than not
"Go vote. It will make you feel big and strong." Bob Schieffer's mom rocks. My favorite quote of the night.
#Romney closes with saying he'll bring jobs. Bring bipartisanship.  Carry American torch of freedom and hope and opportunity
#Obama closes by calling #Romney's plans backwards. Says his plan will-control energy,Reduce spending, Build manufacturing, Build our nation
We all love teachers
Where's the foreign policy part of this discussion on U.S. auto industry?
#Romney says he'll call China a currency manipulator. Makes key argument that China doesn't want a trade war with us.
