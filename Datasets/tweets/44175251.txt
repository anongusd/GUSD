@DelSchilling When people ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù commandeer parts of other‚Äôs cultures and flippantly do whatever they want with those parts, the meaning behind what is worn and done can easily become so diluted that it is danger of being lost entirely.
@DelSchilling This is a prime example of why it‚Äôs so important for people to protect their own culture‚Äôs ceremonies from appropriation...
@DelSchilling There was profound meaning behind each part of this ceremony. 	  Samhain is what people now call Halloween and celebrate as a day to wear costumes and eat candy and most have no idea why.
@DelSchilling Much of the tribe‚Äôs plans for the following year revolved around what their ancestors said during this ceremony. 	  At the end of the ceremony,  the Celts would relight their own fires from the flames of the sacred fire.
@DelSchilling They would wear animal heads and skins and extinguish their fires. The Druids (Celtic holymen) would then build a large sacred fire.   The Celts believed that the spirits of their dead ancestors would come to advise them on this day.
