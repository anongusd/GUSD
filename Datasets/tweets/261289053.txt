RT @RosenthalHealth: Sweet and sour: Senator accuse drugmakers of "gouging" Americans. Senate hearing overshadowed by other news. But this…
A sign of the tide turning against drugmakers -- Sen. Isakson, a Republican who opens by praising pharma for the fact that he can function everyday despite having Parkinson's, says, "When I can’t explain it, it’s tough, and I can’t explain the cost increases."
A bipartisan moment among senators as Sen. Cornyn, a Republican, suggests patents are being abused to prevent patients from getting low-cost generics. Sen. Wyden, the committee's top Democrat, chimes in: "Mr. Cornyn's dead right." Cornyn calls for Judiciary to also investigate.
So far, we have heard pharma executives point to the cost of innovation and flat/declining drug prices to defend against charges of "morally repugnant" costs, as Sen. Wyden said. Time for a fact-check: https://t.co/TgA9phq0SU
Sen. Wyden goes on to call it "morally repugnant" that patients can't afford miracle drugs. Then, as pharma executives sat stone-faced, he called them out one by one for their practices.
RT @jrovner: Just a reminder for history buffs watching this Rx price hearing, Wyden was one of the lead questioners at the tobacco CEO hea…
Sen. Wyden is, let's say, much less measured in his opening remarks to drugmakers: “Pharma executives, all you that are here today, are here because the way you’ve been doing business is unacceptable.”
Sen. Grassley is firm as he opens hearing with 7 drugmaker executives: “One way or another, we’re going to get some clarity.” Strikingly, he reminds them it is a crime to lie to Congress.

"We're trying to get back in our house,” Charlie Murry said when I asked about his neighbors’ feelings about health care, immigration, etc.
I met the Murry’s as Sen. Cassidy’s town hall began. Their house filled with more than three feet of muddy water during last year’s flood.
Many at Sen. Cassidy’s town hall just concerned about repairing homes after the devastating flood six months ago: https://t.co/KCOQGYmzdf
We dispatched reporters to Republican town halls in Tennessee, Iowa, Florida and Louisiana today: https://t.co/WB5QVDn30L
Barnes, 55, said she was unimpressed by Sen. Cassidy’s call for President Trump to release his tax returns. “So, what is he going to do?”
(Sorry, mistyped Jampole's quote — deleted original tweet and sent corrected version.)
Jampole, 73, said she marched to legalize abortion years ago. “I didn’t think I’d have to work to legalize it again, but I may,” she said.
Lois Jampole of Hammond, La., (L) &amp; Rheta Barnes of Roseland, La., came to Sen. Cassidy's town hall to ask about President Trump's policies. https://t.co/QBi3T5x0d0
@allicat1214 Thanks — I was there for this exchange.
Sen. Cassidy said Trump shares his views on health care: need for universal insurance; no preexisting conditions or mandates; lower costs.
Sen. Cassidy of Louisiana is in the minority among congressional Republicans on this point: Most do not plan to hold town halls this week.
At town hall, Sen. Cassidy emphasized importance of listening to concerns. "This is one of the ways, not the only way, that we communicate."
Among other questions, Sen. Cassidy said he believes President Trump should release his tax returns. "I'm for transparency," he said.
Sen. Cassidy invites her to stay after and talk to him personally, as she clearly has a question, he said.
"We're willing to stay if you'll take more questions from us," one woman calls out as Sen. Cassidy said he is out of time.
Sen. Cassidy said "most" calls were coming from California and Oregon. Staffers tried to prioritize Louisiana callers.
Asked about troubles reaching his office, Sen. Cassidy said they were getting about 5,000 calls per week recently, too many to keep up.
Sen. Cassidy reading questions off slips of paper, apparently culled from attendees. Some tough ones, so don't seem to be sanitized.
Tomorrow, however, protesters will greet Sen. Cassidy at his next town hall. Local Indivisible &amp; Planned Parenthood have organized protests.
Protest organizers told me they decided not to demonstrate at Sen. Cassidy's town hall today out of respect for flood victims.
Topics inc. vets, health care &amp; President Trump. "Hats off to the president of the United States," Cassidy said of focus on job creation.
Sen. Cassidy opened town hall on flood relief in Denham Springs, devastated by flooding last year, w/ ~15-min "Washington Update."

…the Electoral College results are not final until they are counted and reviewed by Congress on Jan. 6. So don’t expect final answer today.
In 2012, @AP unofficially called election for President Obama on the day the Electoral College met. BUT...
The Electoral College meetings are public, and in the past, at least some states have announced results during those meetings.
I have an unsatisfying answer for those asking whether we’ll know Electoral College results today: It’s unclear.
@derektmuller Right, 1969 and 2005, from what I found. Thanks for your help!

Sen. Sessions was one of two votes against moving forward with clean DHS funding bill yesterday: http://t.co/hUyADSIE1P
Sen. Sessions: Vote for Lynch "does provide support for the president’s agenda, and I don’t think we should provide that support.”
Sen. Sessions as he objects to Lynch b/c she believes president’s immigration action is legal: “She is a very fine person, I’m sure."
Sen. Hatch on House letter saying vote for Lynch is vote for president’s “lawlessness”: “That is ridiculous on its face.”
Opening remarks now at Senate Judiciary meeting that will include vote on approving Lynch’s nomination as attorney general.
Loretta Lynch’s father, Rev. Lynch of North Carolina, is at confirmation vote. Sens. Leahy, Grassley &amp; Klobuchar greeted him before gavel.
Appear to be just five, cramped press seats at Lynch’s confirmation vote. Come early — win a chance to sit on one another’s laps.
To the Hill reporter wondering where you left your phone: It’s in the Senate Press Gallery fridge.
