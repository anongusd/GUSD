Wait, the CPD investigator is saying the brothers that were arrested last week are victims? And is saying so because, reportedly, Smollett put them in a position to agree to assault him as a hoax?

@CLEUCl Also, I never unretweeted that tweet you mentioned. That account seems to be deactivated.
@CLEUCl I wasn’t retweeting it because he called for the journalist to be fired. It was an Empire writer going on the record to say reports about Smollett being written off were incorrect, as that headline was being written.

@tylergabriel_ Speaking for myself, I believe in all our copy we wrote that this is what Smollett said, not that this is what happened.
this is so good https://t.co/qVxqlW4mu3
Oh, one more thing that’s been nagging at me about this. It wasn’t even Smollett who initially called the police. It was his confidante, (allegedly) over Smollett’s initial objections, according to the CPD. 		So it’s something to keep in mind for what I’m sure will be a slow week
7. ...except for initial reports that Smollett was being written off the show. Which several folks involved with the show swatted down immediately on the record. 		In conclusion, we are nowhere right now.
5.  Skepticism in some corners of Smollett’s story has existed from the start. Yet, even after weeks of it, Smollett went on GMA to adamantly deny notion that he made it up. If he made it up, a remarkable thing to do. 	6. “Empire” and “Fox” are staying quiet right now.
3. Publicly, CPD has repeatedly said Smollett has been cooperative. Last week, Smollett’s attorneys said he will continue to cooperative.	4. There’s the matter of the brothers, whose lawyer said initially on cam that they had no idea why they were considered persons of interest.
Where we are right now:	1. At this point, CPD not saying Smollett is a suspect. Won’t say he’s a victim either, because they want to talk to him first.	2. CPD trying to confirm whatever it was the brothers told them last week. (Cont.)

Gerald Green has at least two of the top 5 dunks in contest history. The candle dunk is a magnificent basketball achievement. Better than anything that was done in the 80s. (Won't say better than Vince though!)
The dunk contest is like SNL: Every year, people are like, "It was so much better back then!" 		No it wasn't. Chris the Birdman Andersen was once in a dunk contest. We're just too nostalgic.
I mean look at that stuff that was just pulled off. Over a WRIGHT BROTHERS plane. That is amazing. The dunks are more creative today overall.
I'm going to hot take something now: Dunk contests now are better than they were 20 years ago. The dunks are better. We just don't see it that way because of how nostalgic we are for the contests when stars like MJ and Nique went out there.

I should clarify, because I said this in my tweet too. Lots of media outlets are saying the arrest happened today. CPD has not said that the arrest happened today, or whether being detained on Wednesday is considered the official arrest. Either way, they are under arrest.
@joel_luther Incorrect
@joel_luther Link?
Story posting soon, but as others have been reporting, the two men detained this week in Jussie Smollett case have been arrested today. They have *NOT* been charged yet with any crime. CPD still not treating this as a hoax.
@tylercoates Well I just said what I feel
@dangercart @Max_Lederman @nProctor I guess this is where we disagree. I wouldn't trade Embiid for Lillard straight up. (For Jokic, I probably would though.) 		I also don't think a 13.5 TOV% on a 33 USG is that bad, given everything else he brings to the table.
@Max_Lederman @dangercart @nProctor I do.
@dangercart @Max_Lederman @nProctor And Embiid is an exceptional rebounder and a good defender (where Dame, in particular, is a minus), which makes up for his efficiency (which is still very efficient.) 		And there is no doubt that Steph/KD are better players than Embiid. But that's not the discussion here.
@NathanKalasho Look at these numbers for Ingram. Counting stats aren't everything. https://t.co/rgztdp17t1
@m1ghtymouse7 yes please center a team around kyle kuzma. like, what?
@RedsArmy_Chuck oh, i mean, yes. i thought you were referring specifically to the deadline.
People on my timeline keep saying the Pelicans screwed up the Anthony Davis thing. How? By not trading him as soon as Davis requested it? By not waiting to see if a top-5 player can net more than Ingram, Kuzma and a low pick?
Classic NBA.	1. Anthony Davis bails on team by asking for a trade request and tries to force one to the Lakers..	2. GM says, "Hey, I'm going to see what everyone else has to offer.	3. AD *literally* bails on the team during a game.	4. It's the GM's fault. You're fired. https://t.co/MftsCzVETx
@RedsArmy_Chuck why was it expected? and why wasn't it done before the deadline then?
@dangercart @Max_Lederman @nProctor Jokic and Lillard also have a sub 60 TS%. And again, Embiid is a great rebounder and defender. Won't even dignify KAT or Gobert.		If you want to make a case for Steph/KD as MVP when 1 has missed like 15 games and it's not even clear who the best player is on the team, sure.

@dangercart @Max_Lederman @nProctor I mean, who are the 5 MVP candidates above him? Giannis, Harden, George, Kawhi? who did I miss? It’s definitely defensible to give Embiid a top 5 vote.
@dangercart @Max_Lederman @nProctor We are really getting on a guy for *only* having a 60 TS% while averaging 27/13 and being a great defender?
@GotEm_Coach @maxthegirl Indeed. It’s a blind spot for the NBA. It is a more progressive league than others. But not in some ways.

Do keep this in mind. I don’t want to mention his name, because it’ll only spread the tweets even more. Lots of bad information going around tonight.

@tammyinlalaland Said it was “inaccurate.”
@poniewozik Jim id like to welcome you to Twitter I’d love to give you a brief tour
In this case, two local outlets are reporting the same thing. Could two local TV outlets have the same inaccurate sourcing? Yes. I’m not saying we know this to be the case. Just saying CPD going out of its way to say they are wrong.
It should be noted: There have been multiple instances of a local Chicago reporter tweeting incorrect information about the Smollett investigation citing anonymous law enforcement sources.
Either unnamed sources are lying to a local reporter about Smollett now being suspected by CPD, or Fox, CPD, and Smollett’s representative are all lying *on the record.*
From Jussie Smollett's spokeswoman: "Today Jussie did answer routine followup questions for Chicago Police Department and continues to cooperate."
NEW STATEMENT FROM FOX: "The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous.  He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him.”

@csl_duke Ben Simmons has improved from last year markedly (more so than Tatum). He’s become a more efficient player and an exceptional rebounder for his position. Siakam is fine. It’s one game!
@csl_duke That’s nuts. Come on.
The Celtics are the most baffling team in the league. Blow huge leads to two lottery teams in a row. Follow it up w/ a big road win over a stacked Philly team (w/o Kyrie and Baynes), &amp; a dominant win over a streaking Pistons team (w/o Kyrie, Rozier and Baynes) on a back to back.

@bjdavis you had such blatant disregard about breaking the law!
@ChrisPollone Would you do a story on jaywalking in the city? And think about who exactly skips fare swiping. Do you think it’s wealthy people? Especially in the area of town IE spotlighted. To stick a camera in their faces is terrible. Like, THAT’s what you put investigative resources to.
@bjdavis just curious, have you ever jaywalked? or had a drink under 21? smoked pot? driven a car even a mile above the speed limit?
@ChrisPollone Honestly, the mentions on the original tweet explain it enough. And if they don’t, I don’t think my explaining it will get the point across.

Trump has been the way he is in treating and talking about people for decades. DECADES. That late night comedians have anything to do with it is the ultimate strawman to excuse Trump.
The notion that it’s the COMEDIANS’ jobs to change their routines, not the most powerful person in the world is the more dangerous suggestion here. The point of political satire is that it’s the powerful who should change. https://t.co/SSNi3e1Cgg
Find the Trump supporter who crossed over to being one because late night is so mean to him.
Takes like these are so sloppy. They operate under the presumption that Trump has changed his behavior as a response to late night comedy as a way to let him off the hook. (Like the 98th time this has been written since Trump took office.) https://t.co/X77gyXfQlY

@JasonKirkSBN BOMB
@derek_humphrey remember that it actually benefits the pelicans not to play davis, in that the more games they lose, the better their pick is.
i just got traded.
@DanielfromSport You see the Clippers as having gotten better *after* giving up Harris?
@derek_humphrey You're paying for nothing anyway. The team isn't making the playoffs and he doesn't want to be there.
@peterwsinger For what? And why? Whose minutes are you giving those to? Morris is not enough of a difference maker to justify giving up assets for.
If you're the Pelicans, why would you play Davis? He doesn't want to be there. Why risk the injury? What obligation do they have to play someone at the expense of other players they want to get a look at?
@sepinwall We had Kanter last year, his name was Greg Monroe.
@DanielfromSport This is assuming that Memphis doesn't swing for the fences in the next year or two and get a big star. Somehow.		And I'm assuming the Clips don't make the playoffs next year either.
That's not saying Ainge should've made trade or anything. What could he really do? You're not trading the J's. Rozier's value is low. You're riding with this team and hope the other teams have chemistry issues.
Some NBA Trade Deadline thoughts no one asked for:		Absolutely brutal for the Celtics. Every East contender got markedly better. Every acquired draft pick for the Celtics becomes either less likely to convey and/or a worse pick.

wondering if tom brady is going to try the "jeff flake," which calls for wildly gesticulating after the ball is hiked in the backfield and then being viciously tackled by everyone, including your own team.

@Enstone This will already follow him forever
@someideasnstuff Absolutely. But that’s partially why he’s not resigning I imagine. What else would he do?
@theshrillest any opportunities he would have would still exist if he resigned in, say, a week. 		those employers would still have to answer the yearbook question.
essentially, northam is betting that the news cycle moves so fast -- as it does for trump -- that the world will have moved on in a couple weeks. better to be a weak governor for self preservation than an embarrassed, unemployable person.
i kind of get why northam won't resign. like, once he's out of office, he'll NEVER get the chance to be in office again after something like this. no way he could run again. for anything. might as well try a hail mary and see if you can survive. what's the downside (for him)?

@jack_hamilton Also given that this wouldn’t be the first time.
@PatchCarraggi What’s weak about it?
@cliffordlarcom Kings fan. Much better following a surprising team than a disappointing one.
@jack_hamilton When there have been multiple reporters from credible reporters saying he’s rethinking it? After he already publicly recommitted? Yeah, he shouldn’t get prickly.
He could easily diffuse it by saying one line: “I’m not going to talk about it anymore but my plans haven’t changed.” That doesn’t take intense media training. But he chose not to. Those aren’t reporters bugging him.
Remember this on Kyrie: He brought this on himself. He taped that commercial. He told season ticket holders unprompted that he was resigning. He’s the one who tugs at the Cs jersey after a game winner. For him to suddenly say “I don’t owe anybody shit” is just so disingenuous.

@sepinwall This isn’t Roger Clemens, I’ll put it that way.
@dangercart Jaylen sits in the backseat
@sepinwall More irrelevant than anything. Assuming Cs don’t win a ring this year: Cs did fine without him, this year and last. Many Cs fans didn’t love the trade that brought him here to begin with. (They do now!) The flat earth stuff...

LOL **and** the Mavs get their long awaited revenge on DeAndre Jordan. 	https://t.co/Yw5owxvzei
OH MAN, I am so tired of franchise building blocks leaving small market teams like ::checks notes:: like New York.
The Knicks just traded their most promising player in decades -- IN DECADES -- essentially as a SALARY DUMP. To *maybe* get a top-tier free agent. 		While *also* taking themselves out of the Anthony Davis sweepstakes. Amazing.

@jakewoolf yeah i'm off the boat on that. KP hasn't shown enough to be worth that for me. that kind of return gets you anthony davis. not KP.
@Anpalacios5 @KeithSmithNBA Yeah, I mean, this is where I'm off the boat. I'm not convinced KP has that kind of value. I'm not trading Brown and picks for someone who hasn't been able to stay on the court and hasn't shot above 45 percent.
would the knicks be able to tell the difference if the celtics kidnapped porzingis as accomplished in @JuddApatow's "celtic pride" - and subbed in daniel theis for him?
@dfera81 @KeithSmithNBA i'm a no on that.
@jakewoolf who is boston trading that isn't named tatum/brown for KP?
@KeithSmithNBA i just dont see a non-tatum/brown pkg the knicks would accept for KP.

@ComfortablySmug @NoahGrayCNN How old are you
@dbschoemer He said it on a podcast. I’d like to hear more about what he’s talking about. Did he hear that from people close to Kyrie? Or LeBron? And many other reporters close to Kyrie have laughed it off
@hames_cole Yeah, I mean, sure, is it possible Kyrie was lying when he went out of his way without being asked to say he was resigning? Yes. I find it hard to believe though.
@blouiszelman Yes but the Pelicans aren’t going to trade for an injured KP and a maybe top pick right now. It doesn’t make sense for them to rush that.
@arappeport If you throw in Simmons
@arappeport Maybe trade for Fultz
@hames_cole The Celtics cannot trade for AD to beforehand. Unless you’re saying July 1 comes and goes and Kyrie waits and sees what happens to Davis before deciding what to do.
@blouiszelman Right. Why wouldn’t he?
@blouiszelman Oh hell yeah. But that deal would still be on the table this summer IMO.
I get it. He wants to be in LA. Ok. To pretend that this is about doubting Kyrie’s commitment to Boston is just disingenuous, unless AD is out and out saying Kyrie is a fraud.
@hames_cole I did! Thanks! I’m saying the stance doesn’t make sense from the Davis camp.
@blouiszelman Why? What deal that is on the table now won’t be this summer?
I will say it again: This take from Anthony Davis doesn’t make sense. The Celtics would trade for Davis *after* Kyrie has resigned. https://t.co/wHOwSD6Lkt https://t.co/b9NewZKLiT

@AG_Conservative I think you make a good faith argument that I (politely!) disagree with. 		Generally speaking, I’m curious if what you’re talking about continues, like what happened with Kessler last week. From AOC *and* reporters.
@drewjmcpherson3 They were on track to be the worst team in the league. Instead: 	1. Playoff contenders unexpectedly in a brutal conference.	2. Super fun, scrappy team	3. Fun young core, with legitimate building blocks for the future
@drewjmcpherson3 this year? any kings fan who isn’t having a blast this year should never watch basketball again because there’s no hope for them.
@AG_Conservative if all trump did was tweet about news he didn’t like, and all AOC did was the same (which is what you’re referring to) then yes, you have point. But Trump has gone way beyond that. The context matters on why they’re talked about differently.
@AG_Conservative I don’t agree. Elected officials have criticized individual networks going back decades. Trump’s taken it beyond that, which is what, in the broad strokes, we’ve talked about since 2015. Sure, individual stories might refer to a specific tweet. But it’s part of the larger context
@AG_Conservative I missed a particularly important one: He mocked a reporter’s disability 		Others too. Trump’s DOJ seized a reporter’s emails and phone records as part of a leak investigation.		These all go beyond tweets.
@AG_Conservative 6. Celebrated a reporter getting bodyslammed.	7. Mocked journalists getting laid off multiple times.		I know I missed stuff. But this isn’t some both sides thing because AOC doesn’t agree with specific critical articles of her.
@AG_Conservative Couple things here, that I feel, make this different:	1. Trump campaigned on changing libel laws.	2. Kept press in pens.	3. Banned outlets he didn’t like from covering rallies.	4. Didn’t fly with press during campaign.	5. Withdrew WH press creds based on a lie. 	(More in next...)

@samesfandiari lmao the wrath of warriors bloggers really knows no bounds.
@BenHoffmanNYT BEN COME ON
@BenHoffmanNYT Listen, I love America, and therefore I thoroughly enjoy when Team USA win the gold medal in basketball. But as a fan experience, I enjoyed last year’s Celtics more because of the expectation factor.
@BenHoffmanNYT Did you feel the same satisfaction as a Dubs fan last year as you did in 2015? If Dubs fans can honestly answer yes, all power to them. I think it’s disingenuous though. Meeting expectations as opposed to trouncing them isn’t the same fan experience.
@BenHoffmanNYT not the same. it would be comparable if after winning 3 championships, the Celtics signed Bill Russell on a discount, and then Bob Pettit a year later on even more of a discount. And also if there were 29 teams in the league instead of like 8.

@ramonashelburne @margskerr I remember this! A great read. I’m talking strictly about the fan experience.
One of the joys that the Warriors has is Steph Curry, the guy the fanbase nurtured and watched blossom into an all time great....and there’s a legitimate discussion as to whether he’s even the best player on the team in all of these rings except one!
@LA_Madridista23 It’s not a good point
@drewber Lmao
Lots of my mentions saying “But Steph Curry!” Theres not even agreement as to whether he’s the best player on the team. That’s how crazy this is.
@NathanIHarris Lmao at Steph transcending the sport like Jordan. Is he even the best player on the team?
Anyone comparing the Warriors to the Patriots isn’t being honest. (I’m not even a Pats fan, I don’t really care.) 		The gap between the Pats and the rest of the league is nothing like the gap between the Dubs and the NBA. https://t.co/CVzC54IGPR
@DanDanUniverse I mean yeah
The 90s Bulls aren’t analogous here. They didn’t have 5 All NBA starters. It’s different. And the Warriors don’t have a single player that transcended the sport the way Jordan did. https://t.co/V02Cz3ylpC

lmao at the warriors fans in my mentions. “no, no! these wins all matter! we experience them the same way! we really are so surprised by these!” https://t.co/U9qdBQh62e
@ClogTheBases Totally true. The whole concept of being a fan is ridiculous. Like, why do I care if the Celts win? But I do, a small amount. Society is weird.
Think about this: when the Dubs win, the max enjoyment a fan can feel is “Eh, that’s what’s supposed to happen.” That’s it! There’s no joy! If they don’t win, it’s a huge embarrassment. There’s no feeling of accomplishment in winning. Zero.
Like watching the 90s Yankees. Except worse and more uninteresting. It’s far better, as a fan experience right now, to be a Mavs, Kings or Nets fan.
I feel bad for Warriors fans that they’ll never experience joy watching basketball ever again. 		The max joy they’ll reach is basketball fans watching Team USA win the gold. Methodical. Expected. Uninteresting.

@paulryanpaul that's not the kind of attitude i instilled in you pups at WTBU!!!!!!
@MarleyJayAP with due respect, that is incredibly presumptuous of you. i have been laid off twice in my career -- and a third time that technically wasn't a layoff, a company couldn't afford to keep me on past a temp contract. i've been at the NYT for 2 years, the longest i've been w/ 1 gig.

this isn't even fair, what the warriors are doing out there. it's ridiculous. so unfair. especially with cousins now. 		by that i mean, it's unfair to the warriors because these runs make them think they'll have a chance against the celtics in the finals. 		#gotem

@ReclaimIguana Atlanta? Orlando?
@dangercart If you say so. That the offense needs Kyrie to bail them out so often against poor defenses is worrisome.
@quit_NAGgin @dangercart When they’re going up against teams like Atlanta? No.
@dangercart Apparent that Kyrie needs to go ham in any game the Cs want to win. Not a good sign for the playoffs.

Also, if Draymond was officiated like any other NBA player, he’d never last till the second quarter. It’s hilarious what he gets away with.
LOL. I hate the hanging on the rim technical. But if there was ever a time when it was completely appropriate, it was Draymond right there.
@zaron5551 Yup. KD did that already though.
I like that Boogie is shooting the ball almost everytime he gets it. He is just going to mess around there for 20 minutes a game and get himself a chip. Remarkable.

@zinoman @DerekKMiller I don't think we write those anymore btw, whether shows recoup or not.
@zinoman @DerekKMiller You're making me rethink this, of course. We really don't know if these numbers are cooked!
@zinoman I can't really argue that - (although I believe because of the investors, shows have to report their earnings to the SEC,  so it might be a legal thing at that point.)
have we all seen the new mortal kombat trailer? it is very gory and i am not old enough for it. 		https://t.co/pGK841eTA0
@BillMurphy75 we'll have to disagree on that, but also, that's a low bar. the best TOS episodes will be better than the worst stretches of trek, obviously.
@zinoman True, but if a show loses money, it closes. There's no incentive to cooking the books because the money is real, right? Like, Head Over Heels can't pretend it's made a bunch of money when there are pictures that show a half empty theater and it closed.
@zinoman I think it's because we know how every show on Broadway is doing, good or bad. That's not the case with Netflix. (Broadway shows have external investors, so that makes a difference...)
I agree with you on this. DS9 was definitely bold in Season 1, as was Discovery. (And that boldness paid off in later seasons for DS9.) https://t.co/fw5J1psHiO
@BillMurphy75 i say that all those seasons were bad
a bit out of context - but as i write in my piece: the first seasons of trek shows have never been good. (esp. TNG.) it took them a while to find their footing. of the trek shows, while ST: Discovery's first season was problematic, it was the best 1st season of any trek show. https://t.co/B83ArZl43y

@rdhotgt @startrekcbs yeah i messed that up.
@planetjared @JoshEberley right. again, all of that could be true and still doesn't change the fact that he, whether inadvertently or not, made his teammates sound like immature children.
@planetjared @JoshEberley i did? i still read it the same way.
@JoshEberley Kyrie was def. being genuine and reflective. But that doesn't change him criticizing his own teammates again. I mean, apologizing to Lebron because now he knows what it's like to be him and not getting the most out of young teammates?
as;lkfjc a;skdfj a;sdkl	https://t.co/Uc6h53J93S https://t.co/PRWUG9O3IO
@JoshEberley Yes, as media consumers, Kyrie should 100 percent be honest. But Bill is definitely right that Kyrie was again calling out his teammates minutes after saying he wouldn't do so publicly. And this time he did it in a backhanded way.

It’s tempting to say tonight’s Celtics/Raptors game is a huge showdown. But honestly, given how the Cs have played recently, my pessimism is at an all time high. Like, this game I expect Boston to win by only 20 instead of 30. It’s tough.

philly fans can take solace that their next disappointing playoff loss won’t happen again for a couple months when the 76ers bid to get out of the first round comes down to an open Ben Simmons 3 or the only slightly better option, a Jimmy Butler 3.
the funny thing is Philly fans will react to this the same way they would’ve if they won. with the passionate destruction of property.
foles was just too scared of facing Brady again eventually

@pbump Time for a chart
@Sheridanblog I wouldn't go that far. Kyrie is playing the best ball of his life. In addition, Kyrie played much of last season.
@BrianPickett well yeah, that's very true.
@Pywacky I do respect the man. He's a great player. Best season of his life. Top 10 NBA season this year. I just can imagine it coming off as condescending when a 26 year old is talking about "the young guys." It's like when reporters used to treat Kyrie as LeBron's little brother.
@HowardKushlan No question. He's a playoff performer. (And a regular season one.)
@BrianPickett Can't argue with Rozier and Tatum, I guess. But Jaylen has been playing really well in the last month in a reduced role.
@HowardKushlan It's not. It's literally factual. It's not even a take.
@BrianPickett Jaylen? Who was arguably the best player on a Celtics team that was minutes away from going to the Finals?
My point is that Kyrie himself is one of the young guys. (And yes, I get that he's had way more playoff experience.) But we're talking about 3 playoff runs for Kyrie. This isn't Tim Duncan in his 30s on the Spurs. Marcus Smart has played in 9 less playoff games.
I kind of chuckle at Kyrie saying "the young guys don't know what it takes to be a championship level team." Kyrie is 26. The only time he has grey hairs is when he's dressed as Uncle Drew. He's not some grizzled vet. He's two years older than Rozier and Smart.
@TruthFaustino @dangercart I do agree that, generally, Terry has been an issue. But I think he’s been this his whole career and last year happened to catch fire for a long stretch.
@TruthFaustino @dangercart It’s a long season. And there’s cause for concern. But what, does a guy just forget how to coach from one season to the next? That’s not how it works.
@dangercart for reactionary fans, maybe. but outside of that? no.
@onlxn when kyrie was on a finals level team, he forced a trade. he wanted to lead a team. this is what comes with it.

@Saramac1237 I mean, there was though. Literally there was an entire plot about Sally's hatred of Don. Don's parenting was routinely questioned.		And...Midge doesn't have clients. They routinely show her at home. And on vacation. Just not with kids.

If you're wondering why I just spent 5 minutes of my day critically analyzing something Charlie Kirk said, it's because I'm a moron.
@dbschoemer Martin Luther King
Also, bringing in Ted Kennedy's net worth into it. So internships should only be given to wealthy people. (Which is why unpaid internships existed for many decades.)		Look, I agree with Kirk's bottom line: You know what school lacks prestige? The Outside-Of-Boston College.
Look, Kirk is right about BU being prestigious.  I'd even say it leads the world in prestige.		But let's look at the more sinister implication here that a true "girl from the Bronx" shouldn't be attending Boston University. Talk about telling on yourself.

if you guys want truly controversial behavior exemplifying poor judgment from AOC during her time at BU, somebody please find out how often she ordered panda express at the GSU.
@RohanNadkarni that goes both ways too - there's way more antipathy to harden because of his style of play (the fouls, etc.)

@2kDFG my dude. anyone still using raw FG% instead of TS% or other metrics that include FT% and 3s in 2018 should not be talking basketball. It’s like using batting average and excluding on base percentage. We don’t do that anymore.
@7im how dare you 	https://t.co/HKcoiR7DnX
@2kDFG anyone who criticizes harden for that game has no business ever talking about basketball ever again
@JaredWeissNBA Funny thing about this call is that if the refs blew their whistle, Durant would’ve been in Shaqtin A Fool
james Harden is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.
here is a little known NBA fact: the guy who hit the game winner tonight and will likely win another MVP this year? he was once on the same team as russell westbrook and kevin durant, both of whom are also very good at basketball.
@jakeandamir Fireable offense is draymond green shooting the ball
I’m kidding. holy hell what a missed call on Durant though. How does that happen?
@asoukuptx Nah
that’s in the top 5 game winners in history by a guy who traveled and got away with it
referee bias is draymond green not getting a technical every time he goes down the floor. 90 percent of the league would get thrown out for the stuff he pulls.

RT @DavMicRot: @NateSilver538 @SopanDeb While horse-race coverage may be demanded by consumers and increase interest in politics in general…
@migold Sassy
On second thought, ignore my question. This is my nightmare: 	https://t.co/UJds4AYD5Q
@skoczela yes on second thought, never mind
@bencasselman yes, you're right about this. my question is if we've inflated how much people care about the horse race. but maybe my head is in the sand!
(Can I just say for the umpteenth time: No, I'm not suggesting we get rid of all polling or even much of it. I'm asking if we would be better served by not telling people who is winning or losing. Polls are valuable, much more valuable than gut feeling punditry.)
@skoczela Oh god kill me now. But to say again: I’m not saying to get rid of all polling. I’m asking what if we didn’t know who was winning or losing? That’s all.
@micahcohen I did literally say in the tweet you just quoted that I wasn’t talking about all polling. Just the polls about who is or isn’t ahead.
@bencasselman You're right about the polling (which is generally good) being superior to anecdotal pieces, which is a good point. 		I guess I just wonder why we need to know who is or isn't ahead. We have enough resources to cover several more candidates than we used to before the Internet.
@bencasselman True, there is value to demographic breakdowns of support (ie. if there is a surge in minority support for a candidate or something), for example.
@NateSilver538 I agree with you here. Where I disagree: it feels like the horse race drives coverage rather than the other way around. And I don't think those have to be the two options, hence why I wonder about the value of telling people winning/losing. But it's just so embedded in newsrooms.
@NotThatRKelly @NateSilver538 This is a good question. Is there value to knowing how much money a campaign has? (Jeb!) There certainly is in knowing who has donated to that person/Super PACs.
@Telenovelarocks @Sam_Vecenie I’m not quite sure what you’re trying to say here.
@ThousandRising @NateSilver538 I think you’re right about this. (And I don’t exclude myself from this, given that I was a Trump embed in 2016.)
@TomDreisbach Bingo.
@Sam_Vecenie Yes, but I'm not suggesting we get rid of polling entirely. Just horse race polling, ie. who is or isn't winning. There's obvious value in data that tells us where people stand on health care reform, etc.
@NateSilver538 I excluded issue based polling. I’m asking strictly about the news value of telling people who is or isn’t winning. What necessary information does that offer voters? (Asking people what they think of issues obviously as value.)
@amw_stanford but even in aggregate, what's the news value? why does the voter need to know who is or isn't winning?
I suppose there is an argument to be made that horse race polls are a measure of how strong a candidate's organization is. 		Or not? I really have no idea.
So just as a thought exercise: Would political coverage be better or worse off if we didn't mention a single poll? What is the value of telling people who is winning/losing? (Excluding issue based polls here. Talking strictly horse race.) https://t.co/9jE3FJkez5
@kboldens You should think about using it
