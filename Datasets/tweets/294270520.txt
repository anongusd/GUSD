Up to now, Eric Garcetti did a lot of stuff to suggest he was running for president		https://t.co/sw7GdAIk3R		https://t.co/V01FjslKNn
Compare that to San Francisco, which claims House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. (Amid decades worth of state and national leaders). Read all about it: https://t.co/iu6F6qaWiq
Eric Garcetti was pondering something never done in the history of this great republic, making the leap from City Hall to the White House. But it's worse than that for LA mayors. None has ever gone on to governor, either* *Except for William Stephens for less than 2 wks in 1909
And, of course, to do well in South Carolina, Harris can't get waxed in Iowa/NH. So, yeah, California and March 3 is important. But when you're shivering your tuchus off in February, don't say you were caught unawares.
Even the Harris campaign recognizes that South Carolina, in particular, will be vital to her changes just three days later in her home state:		https://t.co/4J16IdoQJX
Before you @ me, note that Jerry Brown finished third in 1980 in the California Democratic primary, behind then-President Carter and Teddy Kennedy, and second to Bill Clinton in 1992. Californians may be mellow, but they're not going to waste a vote on somebody with no chance.
The Garcetti exit is no doubt of benefit to Kamala Harris, who won't have to compete for support and, especially, donors. But the impact shouldn't be overstated. She still must do well in Iowa/NH/South Carolina and Nevada if she is to seriously compete in California on March 3
Once it looked like there could be as many as five Californian Dems running for president. With Steyer, Avenatti and now Garcetti out, there are just two left: Sen. Kamala Harris, who has declared, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who's running like he is but not formally announced.

You heard the speech, read the analysis: One week into her presidential candidacy, @KamalaHarris has established herself as one of the top candidates to beat for the Democratic nomination. That's good and bad. From Oakland (my hometown!) with @MelMason https://t.co/SUasg71ikt

In opting against running for president, Steyer offered much the same rationale he gave in opting against a 2018 run for California governor. He said then, too, he could have greater political impact traveling nationally and fighting to remove Trump “from office and from power.”
Other Californians still weighing a 2020 run:	Sen. Kamala Harris	LA Mayor Eric Garcetti	Rep. Eric Swalwell	https://t.co/hF67fbq46H
He also spent heavily to boost minority and millennial participation in November’s midterm vote.
He traveled the country last year+spent millions on TV ads promoting Trump's impeachment, garnering millions of signatures. But he antagonizing many Dem leaders., including Nancy Pelosi, by pursuing what, to their minds, is a misguided and politically counterproductive  effort.
Steyer was less successful in 2014, when he spent $74 million  — most from his own pocket — in a failed effort to make climate change a  central issue in the midterm campaign. Republicans won big and elected  the most environmentally hostile Congress in years.
In 2012  he backed another voter-approved initiative that hiked taxes $1 billion  for out-of-state corporations to pay for conservation and alternative  energy programs...
Steyer has had mixed success in political arena. In 2010, he financed a California ballot measure that beat back repeal of the state's landmark law fighting climate change...

4. Different outcomes, and the past ain't necessarily prologue. But would wager dollars to donuts whoever emerges atop the field early is going to face a strong run from some candidate perceived a year+ now as the emergent insurgent in the Democratic field.
3. Then there's the inevitable hunger among Democrats, especially at the grass-roots, for someone seeming fresh and new. We've seen this movie time and again: Gary Hart. Howard Dean. Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders.
2. Is that such a great place to be? Democrats tend to push back against the perceived early front-runner, who invariably gets branded the candidate of the dreaded "Establishment."

UPDATE: With ballots from Fresno County, TJ Cox extends lead over GOP Rep. David Valadao to 529 votes. Barring a big turnabout, looks like Democrats pick up their seventh seat in California and 40th nationwide--best showing since Watergate era.
With David Valdadao's evident loss in #CA21, the hits keep coming for California's flat-on-its-back Republican Party. Re-upping: https://t.co/LQij1io669
The totals set to be released this afternoon in Fresno County will be crucial and could be decisive. The vote there has broken much more evenly so far, meaning Valadao needs a turnabout and whopping margin to make up the difference.
UPDATE: With Kings County reporting, Democrat TJ Cox extends his lead over Republican Rep. David Valdao to 506 votes in country's last undecided House race. This not good news for the incumbent. He had been winning the updated vote in staunchly conservative county 63% to 37%.

UPDATE: With latest count, Democrat TJ Cox pulls ahead of Republican David Valadao in #CA21 by 438 votes.  If his lead holds, will give Democrats their seventh House seat pickup  in California and give them 40 nationwide for this midterm election.

And there it is. Huge--&gt; https://t.co/VMwXbkjclY
Despite claims by Kim and others, there is no evidence of fraud or other nefarious activity.
On Saturday, when Orange County released its latest totals, Cisneros gained 375 voters, bringing his lead to 3,495 votes.The pattern is consistent with the historical trend in California, in  which Republicans vote early and Democrats later.
Kim, a former aide to the retiring incumbent, Republican Ed Royce, led  by nearly  4,000 votes on election night. But Cisneros has slowly and  steadily pulled ahead as mail ballots and others counted over the past  week tilted his way.
If Cisneros prevails, as seems increasingly likely, it would be the  fourth seat Democrats gained in the once-solidly Republican bastion and  give the party a clean sweep of California’s six most hotly contested  House races.
UPDATE on CA's undecided House races.	#CD39 Democrat Gil Cisneros added 475 votes to his lead, giving him a 3,495 vote edge over Republican Young Kim,.	#CD21 Incumbent Republican David Valadao continues to lead, now by 2,178 votes over Democrat TJ Cox.	That's all til Monday.

In #CD10, the third California House race still undecided, numbers maven @mayasweedler reports Demo Josh Harder has extended his lead over four-term GOP incumbent Jeff Denham to 3,447. Denham has been a perennial Democratic target and a Harder win there be another pickup.

There are just over 300,000 ballots left to count in Orange County. There are seven congressional districts in the country, meaning (ballpark) tens of thousands in the two undecided races in #CA39 and #CA45.

That is all.
Oops. FIVE brothers growing up, and no sis.
She's a Deadhead.
She had brothers (and no sister) growing up, which is why she became and remains a sports nut.
She was the second Pelosi to win elected office in San Francisco. Her brother-in-law, Ron, served on the Board of Supervisors from 1968 to 1980. Nancy Pelosi was 47 when she made her first run, after raising five kids.
She was elected the first time, in a 1987 special election, thanks to San Francisco Republicans. (Yes, they exist)  Pelosi actually lost the Democratic vote to Harry Britt, who succeeded the assassinated Harvey Milk on the Board of Supervisors. The GOP vote made the difference
She has an in-law who, she suspects, voted for President Trump. But they make a point of not discussing it. “We don’t talk politics on that side of the family,” she said. “We just have a  loving family relationship.”

Oops. Fixing that link :		https://t.co/OnTSbNSSu1
That is all.
So if a blue wave is coming Nov. 6 in spite of today’s economic prosperity,  it seems fair to say the president can look in the mirror if he wants to figure out why/17
Or as George Washington University’s @jmsides put it, “He can’t get out of his own way.”/16
That leaves perhaps the greatest reason for the disconnect between prosperity and Trump's job approval: Trump himself. Because he's such an overwhelming personality, he's turned the midterms into a personal referendum that, for many,is quite apart from policy-or the economy/15
But, Herzik went on, "There are still a lot of people who don’t feel completely on their feet and that the economy is benefiting  them personally.”/14
Another factor is the uneven nature of the economic boom. It's been great for corporate profits and investors. For others, not nearly as much. Everyone's glad the recession is over, Erik Herzik of the University of Nevada, Reno, told me/13
Others, like Republican Liza Maupin, don't think Trump, or any president, has much to do with the economy. She's voting based on other issues, including which candidates can best work across party lines. That's why she's backing Democrat Jacky Rosen over Sen. Dean Heller/12
He praises Nevada's outgoing GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval and local business leaders for fostering a business climate that has the Reno area rocking/11
Still, I ran into a lot of voters like Correy Castaneda, a contractor who survived paycheck-to- paycheck during the recession. Now he’s got a great job in the booming commercial real estate industry. But he doesn’t credit Trump or any Washington politician, for that matter/10
Since then, the state has bounced back smartly. Northern Nevada has attracted big job-creating engines like Tesla and Apple. After peaking at 13.7% the state unemployment rate now is 4.5% and job growth is more than twice the national average/9
Call it Ground Zero for the Great Recession, if you’ll forgive the cliché/8		(Hi, @RalstonReports!)
Nevada seemed like a good place to try and figure out this Trumpian disconnect between well-being and well-liked. The state was pounded like no other during the last recession. It led the country for a time in unemployment, foreclosures and personal  bankruptcies/7
Still following along? To put that in some context, Democrats need to gain 23 seats on Nov. 6 to take control of the House/6
OK, so why does this matter politically? In midterms going back to 1946, presidents with job approval ratings below 50% in Gallup surveys have seen their party lose an average of 37 House seats, compared to 14 when a president’s approval was above 50%/5
Here's @johnmsides work, overlaying presidential approval with the decades-long survey of consumer confidence conducted by the University of Michigan	https://t.co/X45R8WNMD1
Yet Trump’s approval rating is stuck somewhere around the low 40% range. By the calculations of George Washington U political scientist @johnmsides, Trump should be about 20% higher/3
Trump boasts of presiding over the greatest economy in the history of America. Even allowing for his habitual exaggeration, the stats are impressive: very low unemployment, high levels of business and consumer confidence/2
So here's a puzzle: The economy is doing great and yet President Trump's approval rating is in the dumpster. https://t.co/yFOeKFvlEB Why is that? And why does it matter so much? (It matters a lot heading into the Nov. 6 midterm)/1

That is all.
Whichever view of the midterm prevails will likely decide the winner in Orange County and could well decide control of the House as well. You can read all about it here:  https://t.co/f95r53zbbJ
But for others, it's all about Trump. Or as one voter--who supported Walters in the past, told me, it’s a choice between a representative who promises to rein in Trump versus an incumbent “not holding him accountable for extremely bad  behavior.”/10
Walters says the choice is pretty straight up:  “A person who supports big government and higher taxes ... versus someone who champions lower taxes and limited government.”/9
She’s attacking Mimi Walters as a 99% percent Trump-rubber stamper in a district he lost by 5 percentage points.  She’s also attacking Walters on the GOP tax bill, which could hit hard by denying deduction for state and local taxes in high-cost Orange County/8
Porter supports single-payer healthcare, is sympathetic to sanctuary cities and is a protege of liberal Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. GOP TV ads paint her as a crazy lefty/7
They hope to turn the election from a classic referendum on President Trump into an up-or-down vote on challengers like Katie Porter, a UC Irvine law professor battling GOP  Mimi Walters inland Orange County, where I visited/6
So in Southern California, Omaha, Kentucky’s horse country and beyond, the GOP and its allies are spending tens of millions of dollars attempting an epic feat of political re-engineering/5
But Republicans, while quietly conceding they'll lost House seats in keeping with the historical norms, believe Democrats have nominated enough outliers for them to hang on in November/4
As @GarrySouth sed: “Republicans are kidding themselves if they think they can make this about the economy, tax cuts, deregulation. It’s about who has a ‘D’ after their name, how  much [voters] hate Trump and how much they want to pay Republicans back for enabling this guy”/3
Many Democrats believe a big blue wave is 'a-coming and it will sweep in candidates who typically wouldn't get elected in a different election season/2
So with just about six weeks to the midterm election, here, in a nutshell is the political dynamic at work/1

In addition to confinement as a POW, McCain survived near-banishment from the Naval Academy, 3 plane crashes, a divorce  caused by  philandering, a career-threatening Senate scandal, 2  unsuccessful tries  for the White House and nearly as many legislative  setbacks as victories.
He was described (and described himself) as a charmer, a wise guy,  an  underachiever, a warrior, a hero, a coward, a straight-talker, a  shape-shifter and, perhaps more than any label, a maverick. John McCain dead at age 81. https://t.co/GEnDLAB80F

Also, President Trump's endorsement of Cox--even tho he didn't vote for Trump in 2016--was crucial. The president's standing with GOPers is off the charts, and he made Cox the anointed one.
.,,, or whether someone lives  in a big city, the suburbs or the countryside. That applies even to "independents" or those "I don't vote party, I vote for the man/woman" voters. Scratch not too far below the surface and you find a partisan D or R.
about Republicans slipping behind decline-to-state in California, party labels are still the single best predictor of voting behavior.  They telegraph how an individual will cast a ballot far better than age,  income, gender, education, sexual orientation/2
So if, in fact, Republican John Cox finishes second in the race for California governor, that again reinforces the importance of party labels. While it's fashionable to pooh poor parties--and there's all that blah blah/1

California is an exceedingly Democratic state and there's not a whole lot of reason to believe that will change between now and November. But who knows. That's why we hold elections and not coronations.
t's been more than 20 years since a Republican has been elected governor  in a conventional race. That is to say one not involving Arnold  Schwarzenegger running in once-in-a-lifetime recall.
So no certainties in life or politics, right? But if these numbers hold and John Cox finishes second, setting up a D vs R November election, it looks pretty darn likely Gavin Newsom will be the next governor of California.
So another non-surprise in California, with Lt Gov Gavin Newsom projected to finish first in gubernatorial race. He's been eyeing the job since 2009, when he waged futile bid vs. Jerry Brown. The first candidate to announce and the leader in every poll leading up to Election Day.
RT @AP_Politics: BREAKING: Democrat Gavin Newsom advances to November election for governor in California. @AP race call at 9:17 p.m. PDT.…
So what we have is a top-two primary, followed by a general election.
Here's the difference: In a jungle primary if a candidates get 50%+1, they win election outright. Failing that, the top-two finishers (regardless of party) face each other in a runoff. But here in California, even if someone hits the magic 50%+1, they still face runner-up/2
Re-upping for those just tuning in:	California is not waging a "jungle primary," despite what you might be hearing on some TV networks. Yes, candidates of all parties are running together in a free-for-all/1
So long as a ballot is postmarked Tuesday, it will be counted if it's received by close of business on Friday.

Failing that, the top-two finishers (regardless of party) face each other in a runoff. But here in California, even if someone hits the magic 50%+1, they still have to face runner-up in November. So what we have is a top-two primary, followed by a general election. That is all.
OK, one other thing... As noted by @RobStutzman and others: Technically, California is not waging a "jungle primary." Yes, candidates of all parties are running together in a free-for-all. Here's the difference: In a true jungle prmary if a candidates get 50%+1, they win!!!/1
for the record that percentage is .0021141 (vs. .0021786).		That is all.
As LAT Sacto Bureau Chief @johnmyers notes, we've had another 14 contests under top-two: US Senate races in '12 and '16 and eight constitutional offices + Bd Of Equalization in 2014. So a grand total of 473 contests. So strictly speaking...
For those keeping score at home, that 1 in 459 contests under top-two amounts to .002% of elections we've held since 2012. We'll see tonight if that percentage goes up or now.
Miller at the time was considered one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents in the country. He hung it up rather then run again in 2014. Aguilar won the seat and has been reelected ever since/3
To break it down further, that's 159 congressional races, 240 state Assy races and 60 state Senate races. The "lockout" happened in 2012 when then-Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar finished third, 2.2% behind a Republican in the race for then-Rep. Gary Miller's Inland Empire seat/2
So what's been California's past experience with top-two? Per the esteemed @GarrySouth, we've had 459 contests since it took effect in 2012. There has been precisely one instance in which a party was shut out of a race it could/should have won. (Assuming, cuz ya never know)/1
My friend, the gentleman from Sacramento, is correct--&gt; https://t.co/o9jphnG8Gj
Some perspective amid all the heavy-breathing over California's top-two primary:  Even if Dems got shut out in all 3 seats they're nervous about, there are still scores of competitive races across the county. Control of the House will not be decided tonight in Fullerton.

If it sounds familiar, it’s  because this is the same eastern Washington congressional district that  bounced House Speaker Tom Foley in the 1994 GOP wave year. (“We need a  listener, not a speaker.”) First such ouster of a leader in 130 years!
Separately,  the local congresswoman and No. 4 member of the GOP leadership, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, looks to face the most serious challenge since her  election in 2004. Several interviewed said she’s lost touch with folks  back

That is all.
So maybe there was a “Bradley effect” involving white women voters in Alabama. We’ll never know of course, and it’s just a notion. That and $5 will get you a Frappuccino.
Save those cards and letters; there’s are plenty of reasons to debunk the notion, but the “Bradley effect” lives on in politico/journo shorthand and has been cited in Donald Trump’s victory in re polling in the 2016  race.
That’s the notion it’s not socially accepted to state your real views so people will lie to pollsters, saying one thing and doing another. (Bradley was the black mayor of LA who ran for California governor in 1982 and lost even tho polls showed him ahead.)
They didnt choose to speak up publicly about opposing Moore. But in the privacy of the voting booth, they voted for Democrat Doug Jones or wrote in another candidate. It’s an interation of the “Bradley” phenomenon..
In short, they GET why the allegations against Moore were so late surfacing. In others words, they believed the women. But for whatever reasons, not wanting to engage the “fake news” media and their pollsters, wishing to keep peace in the household..
I’m a guy, not a gal. Stating that up front, so can’t speak from personal experience. But I’m surmising there are a great number of women who’ve experienced sexual harassment, or worse, and kept mum...

@realDonaldTrump But it's not all sunshine and daydreams:   But Democrats also have to deliver if they win the House in 2018 and look to taking back to the White House in 2020.
@realDonaldTrump On Demos going forward:   “The lesson is we need to keep being aggressive, fighting him everywhere. There’s no reason we can’t win Tennessee, there’s no reason we can’t win Arizona and Nevada. There’s no reason we can’t win congressional seats all over the place.”
First, viz @realDonaldTrump:    “If he can’t figure out a way to turn this around we’re going to win the Senate, we’re going to kill ‘em in the House and we’re going to set up the second half of his presidency where he’s going to be neutered.”
