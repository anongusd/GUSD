@OnofrioJosh @HughLander1 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips True. People are working which is good. Problem is that tax cuts and resulting economic stimulus have a very high cost that will need to be paid for. Not sustainable. Democrats share blame for high spending but Republicans are responsible for tax cuts and exploding deficits.
@OnofrioJosh @HughLander1 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips The last recession ended in June 2009, about 7-1/2 years before Trump entered office. That was the largest recession since the great depression that started under Bush and ended under Obama. Trump came into office after more than 7 years of growth.
@HughLander1 @OnofrioJosh @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips Most tax receipts from individuals are withheld. Are you hoping for a surprise next April with tax receipts somehow paying for the huge tax cuts? Dream on. We're heading toward a $1 trillion deficit courtesy of a Republican controlled.Congress and White House.
@HughLander1 @OnofrioJosh @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips If you consider facts obtuse, guilty as charged. The tax cuts are not paying for themselves. They are adding to the deficit and making the rich richer.
@OnofrioJosh @HughLander1 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips That is my point. The tax cuts are resulting in gigantic/growing budget deficits that even the white house OMB admits will exceed $1 trillion. That's a nifty way to generate short-term growth that our grandchildren will pay for.
@OnofrioJosh @HughLander1 @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips Fine. Do you go by what the Trump.White House say? The New York Times data comes from this report: https://t.co/zNKCY3QtUE. Pesky reporters.
@HughLander1 @OnofrioJosh @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips So, I'm right. The tax cut took effect January1, 2018. That means that tax receipts for individuals and corporations declined starting January 1. Thanks for clarifying.

@OnofrioJosh @FoxNewsInsider @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips Alas, even the White House admits that corporations are paying smallest share of federal taxes in generations. I believe less.than 2%. The rich are getting richer (and I'm one of them). Even Reagan realized.that the massive tax cuts passed in his first term were too much.
@FoxNewsInsider @trumps_feed @foxandfriends @cabot_phillips You should ask Trump and the Republican Congress how they're funding the government.

@redeye80 @Surabees @trumps_feed @NRA @ACLU Here‚Äôs one example. Seems like scare tactics to me. https://t.co/bcojJ5XWT7
@Surabees @trumps_feed @NRA @ACLU So, how does the ACLU create fear?
@Surabees @trumps_feed @NRA @ACLU The @NRA also creates fear among the victims of gun violence by preventing even the most common sense reforms from being implemented. The huge numbers of guns - promoted by the NRA - make nearly everyone fearful that they will be the next victim of gun violence.
@Surabees @trumps_feed @NRA @ACLU Main difference us that @NRA uses fear and @ACLU doesn‚Äôt. The NRA convinces people that without guns they will be victims of crimes and plays on those fears to convince those people to give them money. Reality is that in vast majority of cases, those guns make them less safe.

@dkrwilliams @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews @foxnewspoll You are getting desperate if you‚Äôre turning to the idea that any weapon that can be used to assault someone is what is meant when people refer to assault weapons.
@hawkman1964 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews @foxnewspoll Reasonable people would assume that an assault rifle is a military style weapon that can cause military style carnage.
@WiredWebDesign @FoxNewsSunday @foxnewspoll I would guess that most people would interpret ‚Äúuniversal background checks‚Äù as meaning that anybody purchasing a gun of any type in any way would undergo a background check, eliminating loopholes for private sales or sales at gun shows etc.
@GotTheUmp @mattyistnatty @HoneyPotWay @piersmorgan Your comparison doesn‚Äôt hold water. üòÄ As pointed out, people don‚Äôt cause others to drown in a pool. People do shoot other people and kill them.
@HoneyPotWay @piersmorgan News flash. If you have a gun in your house for protection the chances of someone in your family getting shot is much higher than houses without guns. It‚Äôs an NRA myth that guns keep you safe.
@Michael2014abc @piersmorgan Probably not. Most Republicans aren‚Äôt gun death cultists. More than half of the guns in the US are owned by 3% of the pop which is about the same number of people who subscribe to Better Homes &amp; Gardens. The rest are mostly normal people who think reasonable controls are ok.
