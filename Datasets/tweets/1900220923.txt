@AOC @TheRevAl Was that his hand on your rear? Good way to get him in the door.

@MaryWalterRadio @AOC Don‚Äôt expect the hypocrisy to change.
@AOC The only example I see, an attractive idiot who got lucky &amp; shines on ignorance &amp; stupidity because of this diluted message that she‚Äôs like the average person. Great example, but your physical appeal will soon fade as people realize how dumb you really are. Go back to bartending.

@lexKrasny @mattbubbs @PatTheNESpunk @mattmillsap That‚Äôs not what I mean. Typically the people who play the lottery pay little to no taxes whatsoever.

@JJSAVAGE20 A million dollars doesn‚Äôt get you what it use too. You will find if someone is unhappy with money, they will be unhappy without it. If you are happy now, that‚Äôs a big step. Don‚Äôt tell anyone if it happens and learn to love to save.
@lexKrasny @mattbubbs @PatTheNESpunk @mattmillsap Well, it‚Äôs $2 and that over a lifetime isn‚Äôt worth it. The lottery is a tax on poor people and a sad one at that. Save your money and find better ways to make your dreams become a reality.
@JJSAVAGE20 I‚Äôd rather make my millions with old fashion work. It means more than free money. Half of all winners go broke, frankly most people just don‚Äôt know how to handle money and it‚Äôs often those who ‚Äúthink‚Äù they can, often fail. It‚Äôs a skill and needs people. Good luck!
RT @_Lambo_Leo: How many bitcoin will it take to get $1 million dollars at the peak of the next bull run?
@JJSAVAGE20 It‚Äôs cool. Yeah, odds won‚Äôt change. Granted, someone is going to eventually win but I always see the lottery as a tax on the poor. I watched my grandmother spend a lifetime hoping to win, it was sad.
@JJSAVAGE20 https://t.co/wymSKL3RhW
@JJSAVAGE20 You aren‚Äôt in finance, I take it? Odds don‚Äôt change based on the number of people who buy tickets, not how odds work. Even worse, they just changed the formula, making the odds worse, like I said, the odds of winning the jackpot are now 1 in 302,575,350 no matter how many play.
@JJSAVAGE20 So a 1 in 300m chance it will happen? Better luck of getting bitten by a shark after a vending machine falls on you after getting struck by lightening.

@APompliano I agree as since the 30s, the economy cycles every 7 to 10 years but I disagree on bitcoin, one alt will emerge as the future. Bitcoin was a nice try but it‚Äôs the Napster if crypto.

@APompliano I think people are missing the utility component. Too much effort is being put into fluff, names, PR, very little effort is focus on the actual utility if the token. If people find no more value than trading the token, then it will ultimately fail.

@mjevans611 @iheartmindy Many restaurants have resorted to automated change machines because people don‚Äôt know how to make change, it‚Äôs truly sad that said person feels they deserve $15/hour - minimum wage was meant to be a starting wage, not one where you can support a family.

@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge I‚Äôll be fine, fighting much worse criminals for over a decade. Their issue was greed, nothing more. Others intentions are more sinister but thanks!		I know money won‚Äôt change it but at least want you to know we are trying to do the right thing, I only wish @FinishLine would. Best
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge I‚Äôll tell you what.		To prove our intentions are genuine, I‚Äôll do this.		Keep track of whatever time you spend and any cost you incure and ‚Äúwithin reason‚Äù I will personally compensate your time.		There are plenty of honest merchants out there and I‚Äôll get you a gift card to use.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Could it be I was tired of seeing millions of consumers get screwed year after year? Could it be I‚Äôm tired of seeing banks cover these things up? Will they go down for this? Probably not but I won‚Äôt see a dime but at least consumers like you know.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Verify everthing I say, yes, I‚Äôm being honest. Do I want them exposed? Absolutely but will we see a dime from it? Nope. Do you know how much in legal fees this is costing us? So won‚Äôt see a dime, spending a fortune and then you have to ask, if it wasn‚Äôt to help, then why?
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge We didn‚Äôt lose money, beyond lost future revenue.		Do you know how many breaches I‚Äôve seen in the space? Never once being able to say anything and yet the industry covered it up. If you don‚Äôt think consumers should know, I‚Äôm happy to report others would disagree.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge We won‚Äôt sell it, that would be pretty stupid now, don‚Äôt you think?		That said, would you rather we not tell you it‚Äôs been exposed? Some people would say yes but come six months from now and you are hit with 10 unauthorized charges, now, at least you know.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Sometimes it‚Äôs the lesser of two evils and while either way the consumer is hurt, would you oppose our way and letting them know or the @FinishLine way and six months from now, you never know why those 10 charges hit your card? For my money, I‚Äôd rather know.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Consider if you never got that alert, someone would be selling your data as we speak and you‚Äôd never know. Would that be better?		Breaches average two years to go public and people often never know why, now?		File a police report. File an #fbi report. A least you are protected.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge You say how we did it was wrong but what would you suggest? Banks, #sec, #fbi? No one cared. Less than a year ago, they were nearly out of business so everyone looked the other way. Want to know the truth? Read their 10k statements from 2016. What would you have suggested?
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge The sad truth is I don‚Äôt know. Consider if we have the data, how many others do?		Keep in mind, they have tried to suppress this every step of the way, first claiming they didn‚Äôt know preCharge, then claiming we stole the data. So you really think that was wise?		Get the word out
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge You are right, the consumer is innocent and for that, I‚Äôm sorry but if our biggest error was notifying them, I think that‚Äôs the least of the concerns.		Keep in mind, this has been going on since 2016 and we tried the #fbi, #sec and media and even with proof in hand, no one cared.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge BTW, if our plan was to hurt @FinishLine - we simply would have sold the data on the black market. What do you think a million credit cards is worth?		We simply asked people tell the #sec and #fbi - if doing something wrong, that would be a very silly approach.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge I‚Äôve give you that.		Wasn‚Äôt trying to incite fear but if a company even ‚Äúmay‚Äù have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars, don‚Äôt consumers have a right to know?		You say you don‚Äôt work with them, your objectivity to this question will prove that one way or another.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Nope.		Remember, you said last question. Hold to your word.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Tell me if you need the #sec and #fbi contact info, I‚Äôll get you the direct numbers, no need to go through regular channels. You are welcome.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Nice try but we are required to allow consumers to opt out.		We didn‚Äôt transfer your data, if you login, that creates the Wallet. Show me in the email where we ‚Äúsolicited‚Äù ?		Disagree? Contact the #fbi and #sec - I‚Äôll wait for your report.		Everthing done was in compliance.
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Released it to whom? The consumer? Yeah, find me one law that prevents that.		Nope, we don‚Äôt delete data, ever. Our clients, regulators and law enforcement have known that for 15 years.		Get over it, we‚Äôve been catching criminals for over a decade, your beef is with @FinishLine
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine @precharge Well, since you don‚Äôt work with them, you wouldn‚Äôt know that their own attorney said their data was compromised.		I‚Äôm guessing they didn‚Äôt contact you about this compromise?		So, we did.		Get over it, if you have a problem, file a report with the #fbi and #sec
@premiumsneaks @FinishLine Truth has no versions.		Tell me, how do you work with them?		I hope the 2 people that respond to your feed can see the truth.		If you have any other issues, feel free to call the #sec - I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd love to hear the ‚Äúversion‚Äù

@IKEA founder just past at 91. He was a great man. If you were born in Europe, chances are you were conceived on his furniture. Never liked his food but he thought it was good.

@ThomasMHern You mean the once not for profit making billions in profit? Who knew.
@ThomasMHern Fortunately, ever second is another chance to turn it around. That is why the founders made it four years and put in the Electoral College to be sure.
@ThomasMHern The only day of the year this may be true is April 1, then it becomes questionable. While she may deserve that, she is also protecting too many powerful people behind her which will never let that happen.
@missmagamia @ThomasMHern @NFL God bless those men and women.
@missmagamia @ThomasMHern @NFL If they only allowed televised returns, people would truly understand but America is not ready for that level of truth.
@ThomasMHern Any media becomes a tool for the elite and corrupted by the powerful even if not the elite. FB, G, Twitter, its never about if but when.
@ThomasMHern People have no idea. 2007/8/9 stem from that era and yet Bush got all the blame and Obama got all the credit but neither is accurate.
@ThomasMHern Rich white guy, of course he is guilty until proven innocent. People talk about the attack on the middle class but don't care about the war on the upper class.
@ThomasMHern People tend to wait, fire, aim. Hindsight is always 20/20.
@Gunnar_Thor It will be shut down, too much money is made in chaos which is why pharma pays for these things, even if on the back end.

@sassygayrepub They are both based on flawed interpretations of the Jewish bible, two wrongs don't make a right.
@BobDog92956834 @sassygayrepub Sad but true.
@sassygayrepub Rules are what define your constitution and are subjective. If your moral compass is the law, it becomes the constitution and if it is religion, it becomes the bible. Ultimately, it is all perspective, right and wrong is simply the path of least resistance.
@sassygayrepub Alcohol makes too much money and with the support of insurance and politics, it is unstoppable. THC by contrast, backed by virtually no one but everyone is all too eager to jump on the bandwagon. Hasn't reached the tipping point, yet.
@sassygayrepub As it stands up until recently, democrats by nature are socialist and republications are capitalist. Sadly, can't have the ying without the yang.
@sassygayrepub People fear what they don't understand and praise what they assume is popular but really not which makes it popular.
@sassygayrepub Great point!

@topicolist If you will allow me, I will send you the early version of the white paper once the lawyers sign off on it this weekend and if interested, put you on the white list for the early release.
@topicolist that we‚Äôve created to back this project.
@topicolist Consider that unlike most ICOs, ours is founded on a proven product, a serious need in the market and over 10M+ consumers to start. I think you will be impressed with our focus on regulatory compliance, security and background but also the partnerships and options
@topicolist The fact is that we have worked with blockchain for 10+ years and that an ICO by our company would heavily focus on regulatory and industry compliance, we are rolling out a very aggressive ICO and would like to talk to you about how we can work with you on the project.
@topicolist For 15 years, preCharge has served as a global risk management provider for some of the largest brand names on the planet. As a result of this, we maintain one of the largest repositories of consumer data along with many government, industry and corporate connections.
@topicolist I am the cofounder and current CEO to preCharge USA, Inc.
