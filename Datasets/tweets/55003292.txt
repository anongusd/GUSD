The prosecution then played questioning during which Fields wept, hyperventilated, and went 2 to 3 minutes before regaining composure when told there was a fatality.
Jurors heard Fields say again and again when apprehended that he was sorry. When officers asked why, he said he didn't mean to run into people, that he was afraid.
He said the jury could logically conclude that it showed his state of mind and hate, noting some individuals, including Hitler, stand for much more then their names, and Hitler was a dictator who exterminated groups considered lesser.
Judge ruled the prosecution could enter into evidence a text from James Fields to his mother that included picture of Adolf Hitler.
