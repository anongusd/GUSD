@mattmillsphoto Fair enough 💇🏻‍♂️
@mattmillsphoto This is, sadly, less bad than I thought it would be
@mattmillsphoto Where are the pictuuuures? 👀😂
@deb_espinosa @dzalcman Yeah, obviously I'm biased in thinking it's a really interesting subject, but there's such a spectrum of experience based on your appearance/name/family history etc and whether that fits how you identify (and the psychological and sociological effects and implications of that)
@mattmillsphoto time to buzzcut
Time has no meaning https://t.co/3l9rKfVrrf
@CaeanCouto Yeah. That’s my specific question/ problem. Like— it’s a very binary option (it’s actually a photographer survey too) and one that’s very awkward for me to choose between
@dzalcman Ah yes, that old chestnut. 	I’ve mostly gotten that or asked if I’m part Indigenous, if anything. (Often by Indigenous people). One lady asked if I was from South America once 🤷🏻‍♀️I think 2 people ever have guessed correctly but one was also part Japanese
@dzalcman (As an aside, are there actually people that meet you and think you’re white??You are obviously Asian)
@gjmccarthy @dzalcman Hahah I’m pretty sure I am listed as “Asian” at my former university because you could only check one box (no “multiracial” option I don’t think) so I decided, what the hell.
@kidandcamera I love that being able to select more than one is even an option on at least some forms now instead of “check one” so now I’ll check both (the survey that prompted this tweet has just a POC box to check, hence my handwringing). 	Sorry kids can’t tell Asians apart 🙄
@dzalcman Exactlyyyyy. Can there be a POC-ish box 🤔 I think this would be less of an issue for me if my appearance was different since asian-ness is something I’ve always kind of had to “prove”. Not a great feeling, and also makes me uncomfortable saying I’m a POC due to my privilege
(This is really more than a 1 tweet kind of question but there must be others who also exist in an awkward middle ground that can commiserate)
Biracial/mixed people: how do you feel about the POC box in surveys? I am half Asian &amp; identify more w/that side of my family, but I have a white name &amp; I think most people assume I’m white. This makes me uncomfortable identifying as a POC, but I don’t identify as white either.

@TheWittyNinja Sure. I’m really glad I had a vacation payout because I’d accumulated about 6 weeks. So, me never taking vacation was the only reason my severance wasn’t laughably small. But even with that, it still wasn’t as good as what Buzzfeed is offering 😐
@EJSmith94 I’m going to take credit for the fact that he changed his cover photo 😂
Not that I’m defending Buzzfeed’s choice, but the article also states they’re giving people a minimum of 10 weeks pay and extension of benefits until April. I don’t know what most severance packages are like, but I got 3 weeks. https://t.co/ea99e38KQU

@mattpentz is it just me or does that seem like five minutes too many
@jakequery @MariaMann16 @andersoncooper (This is coming from a photojournalist’s POV, though. But I personally get a bit irritated when I am referred to namelessly that way because it implies the reporter is in charge/ is the real journalist/we are totally interchangeable. Anyway. Just my 2c)
@jakequery @MariaMann16 @andersoncooper Fair point—I was just thinking about this the other day, because I too get irritated with the “my photographer/videographer” but I think the difference is just that it feels like ownership in this case. Esp. on TV, where the photog/videoperson is usually unseen and nameless

Apparent theme of the week: random men willfully being jerks 		(To be fair that could be just about every week)
@antmay @JaneGPhoto Honestly it would be nice if everyone who complains about the departure of the Sonics would expend less of that energy and maybe try even watching a Storm game on tv
@RyanBlethen It is indeed a confusing olfactory experience
@JaneGPhoto There’s a way to talk about the issue of disparity between viewerships in sports without being a jerk, but I think he enjoys the attention that brings. So in that respect he gets what he wants.
@morenojosea @bettinahansen @bikehugger Yes, but I honestly don’t really care who is directing them. Point still stands
@morenojosea @bettinahansen @bikehugger I just think about @ElaineMThompson’s great Griffey pile photo and how today if that happened it’s twice as likely there’d be some random social media or broadcast video person in the way... 🤔
@morenojosea @bettinahansen @bikehugger But often that shaky Facebook video or bad phone photo for IG means there is no great image
@morenojosea @bettinahansen @bikehugger Look I get that he has a job to do, but not at the expense of literally everyone around him. It’s worse when the person has access you don’t, so there’s nothing to do about it. If something happens people won’t remember shaky Facebook video, they’ll remember a great image
@DaneCreekPhoto But did someone named Carter give you the keys

@sbhopper8 @bettinahansen (and probably Bettina and maybe the other NBA photographer. I can't really remember who else was next to me at the time).
@sbhopper8 @bettinahansen If i remember correctly I had been waiting for Breanna to walk off, so I'd been standing there for a minute or two. Phone man comes off the court following her, pretty sure knowingly walking right in front of me. Not the end of the world, but again it's about intent
@bettinahansen @bikehugger It's a difference in intent, basically. Here at least, people try not to screw everyone else over. Social media video on smartphone usually means the person is IN the scene instead of capturing it, and usually with no spatial awareness
@bikehugger @bettinahansen That's not really the point. Fellow stills photographers, at least in Seattle, mostly know each other, so everyone tries to be respectful while also understanding everyone needs to get the shot. Dudes like this literally walk up 2 feet from the scene/subject and block us.

@12thMax @antmay Ok. I never said that originally, but I think it’s important to point out what I did and that people need to keep those things in mind. Anyway. I could go on but I think I’m at my convo limit this evening  –30–
@12thMax @antmay My point was just that authorities historically have been very bad at handling interactions with photographers, that’s all. Most widely known example.
@photoJDL @brandonsblog No, seattle
@brandonsblog @photoJDL I mean, some Boeing employee tried to detain me and get security to do something with me when I was taking photos through a fence with a 300. Didn’t break into anything, no climbing over anything. Thankfully the guard didn’t care and wanted to hear about my job.
@12thMax @antmay anyway it's sort of a confluence of issues that's hard to condense to Twitter but needless to say the "authorities" are often very poorly versed in photo laws /rights and often overstep their bounds. Just ask anyone who covered Ferguson
@12thMax @antmay yes, it would be great if someone noticed something and stopped a potential terror threat, but let's also keep in mind the very real issue that photographers of color are affected quite a bit more by the "report suspicious photographers" thinking.
@12thMax @antmay I fear these types of calls to action will encourage the Permit Patty types and not do much good. Theoretically if someone called the authorities on a photog, they would realize the mistake and move on, but that's often not the case. I hope you can understand the other side of it
@shelbywebb This is truly incredible

@Polly_Philllips @petapixel Using McCurry, a disgraced photojournalist, as their "how to do it like the pro" example is eye-roll worthy. They might as well say "how to edit photos like someone who is a terrible example of their profession." Obviously commercial/advertising has a different perspective.

@bucketgirl Sure. Hopefully I made it obvious this is not an argument about free speech. Guess I was more interested in the idea/issue of a racially loaded phrase being consumed (if you will) by white people and how that changes when the owner is the minority instead of white
RT @soledadobrien: *sigh*. Hey reporters in DC: maybe more handwringing over this and less on the other stuff. https://t.co/a52Y11mlq5
For the record— My mother is Japanese American and married my dad, a white guy. Lots of girls on my mom’s side, and most married white guys. So...that’s where I’m coming from. Personally I’m not really on board with the restaurant name. Curious what other Asian Americans think..
I acknowledge that in the grand scheme of things it’s not a huge deal but I think the fact that “Yellow Fever” owner Kelly Kim is Asian certainly prompts discussion on reclamation of words vs. perpetuation of stereotypes
On the one hand, some people will say, no, [political slur here] stop  complaining, everything is too PC, etc. There’s her argument about reclaiming the term, but it’s kinda muddled by the fact that it’s a restaurant a lotta white people will visit. And may think is now “ok.”
Have some complicated thoughts on the fact that there is an Asian woman running this restaurant utilizing a term about the fetishization of Asian women/ culture. Usually the issue in stories like these is, well, white people, which is a lot more straightforward.. https://t.co/vgZMu4OW3M

@justicar (Also I wish I could be this casual about picking up a “200-400 or so.” 😂😂😭😭) Overall I know more Canon folk but @rodmarphoto is a Nikon shooter and obviously is 👌🏼, so is @JaneGPhoto.
@justicar Ah, nice! Had no idea. (Also sent that last tweet before reading this string..) Anyway yeah. I don’t have experience with Nikon’s top of the line stuff but think it’s comparable to Canon’s mostly.
@justicar I mean Sony is killing the mirrorless market so I feel like for people who aren’t PJs /also do sports that’s the way to go. Nikon and Canon are gonna be the “pro” standard for awhile yet (out of the 2 it’s really personal preference once you’re using pro stuff)
@justicar (This is all assuming we’re talking about sports stuff.... because a separate mirrorless kit would be nice, and also a few wide primes, and also..)
@justicar I mean, depends on the assignment. 1dxiis would be fun. 400 2.8 ii is one of the best lenses I’ve ever used. 200-400 is great for baseball (and soccer sometimes). Really what I want is a 200-400 2.8 but they might have to change physics for that 😂
@justicar (Er, 5diii. ) Anyway, sucks not to have more options anymore, but use what you’ve got I suppose.

@JmeSeattle @tingshenphoto That is... far different. You can’t equate the scenarios. Yes they do, but they aren’t an outlet already in or covering DC themselves. I don’t mean to sound like an ass, but... nothing you’re saying is really feasible
@JmeSeattle @tingshenphoto This is just not at all how this situation works, sorry, friend.  Obviously both Ting and I have been photographers too... It's one of the  biggest stories of this moment. Only allowing 5 outlets to photograph  it would be insane. This all comes with the territory.

@erinhooley @kodacohen Yeah, healthy competition in a 2 newspaper town is a good thing....taking digs at layoffs is pretty low.
