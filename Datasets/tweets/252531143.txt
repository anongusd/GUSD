@E_JonesEurasia I agree, but if he had thought that using barrel bombs &amp; chem weapons meant that he would lose the ability to use his air force, he might have thought twice. Is it possible to intervene in a civil war only to make clear that some weapons off limits? Maybe not, but worth trying?
@E_JonesEurasia I agree with you there; ANY of us who supported/support R2P (and Kosovo was still the right thing, I think, also East Timor, Sierra Leone) are chastened &amp; rethinking. Still bombing Syrian runways in response to chem attacks, to declare some weapons off limits might have helped.
