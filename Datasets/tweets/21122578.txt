@racheld They don't have standing. They licensed performance rights to BMI/ASCAP and Trump pays a per play fee.
@alli_k I know many see compromise as capitulation. I don‚Äôt. I see it as the only way for a representative government to function. Digging deeper into retrenchment and perpetual shutdowns is not tenable.
@alli_k I‚Äôll admit my bias toward personal experience over campaign messaging. I also have a general political bias for the pragmatic center. I fear a nominee who is either (a) so far off-center they can‚Äôt win, or (b) one who can‚Äôt govern effectively, and extends the stalemate.
@alli_k You are right about the party‚Äôs policy platform (not just Biden‚Äôs) re 80s crime as being a mistake. But for that matter, it was also the Clinton (both Bill &amp; HRC) policy back then. Did that disqualify them as nominees?
@alli_k All fair statements. Though obviously not applying the white/male bias to Harris on that hypothetical ticket. ;)

@Carty @NewsCEO None of them. Read the op-ed. Suggesting the path forward is to roll back regulation limiting news orgs from negotiating together with FB etc. Actually level the free market field rather than have govt hold them back. I bet even you could endirse that play! ;)
This RT = endorsement. @NewsCEO makes good point: Facebook, Apple, and (to an extent) Twitter have become what antitrust limits on news orgs were designed to prevent.

@alli_k @JoeNBC The victims have every right to yell. But the rest of us can't just stop at yelling. Too many yell and still stay home come November.
@alli_k @JoeNBC But bottom line my RT (which was an endorsement this time) was more to suggest voting has greater impact than yelling, not to suggest people don't have the right to be angry and yell too, especially at the Capitol.
@alli_k @JoeNBC Fwiw the women with flake in the elevator were totally appropriate IMO. I do think the restaurant things w Cruz and Sanders weren't though. I do believe elected officials are people who deserve "off time" with their families.
@alli_k @JoeNBC Very true. And when it comes to the fundemental flaws in our electoral system, I think we agree.
@alli_k @JoeNBC Think the key point here is if more people voted, there wouldn't be as many senators worth yelling at.

@alli_k I believe there is a difference between threatening individual w imminent harm vs stating foreign policy against a nationstate. Under strict reading, anything but pacifist policy would be TOS violation. TOS designed to protect indivs, not make Twitter replace @UN sec council.

@kscharold Hey, only fitting after the many times you've done the same for me! I miss having these chats desk side! :)
@kscharold Fair. :) fwiw, I think he has had potentially suspendible Tweets in the past‚Äîbut NK ones aren't among them. Ultimately, Twitter's obligation is to its users. I can extend that to individual non-users more easily than I can saying it has a duty to intervene between nation-states.
@kscharold Likewise. If only more could use the platform for civil, respectful debate between two equally valid but strongly held viewpoints. :)
@Larakate @SG AGREED. In that spirit, I actually think suspending him or removing his Tweets does more to protect him from himself than punish him.
@kscharold Though fwiw, if argument is Twitter should go back to being "social" network, for friends and not controversy and political debate, I would disagree with it but find it more supportable than choosing what political statements are appropriate vs. not.
@kscharold I also believe the egalitarian vision of treating every user the same is somewhat unsustainable. If I threatened nuclear war, it would be meaningless. If POTUS does it, it has implications. Therefore our threats shouldn't be considered in the same vain.
@kscharold Where it gets tricky is yeah, he takes it somewhere else. OK. But hard to scale what matters of public interest do belong vs don't, as that is often subjective.
@SG By my logic, fwiw, I think Trump has had potentially suspendible Tweets in the past -- but the NK aren't among them.  And I also agree that Twitter's TOS lines are blurry, confusing, and inconsistently enforced and communicated, which causes more tension.
@SG Ultimately, Twitter's obligation is to its users. I can extend its protective obligations to individual non-users more easily than I can saying it has a duty to intervene between nation-states.
@SG Not making country-by-country basis. If Trump called for extrajudicial killing of a US person, I too would say that crossed the line -- and if Duarte used Twitter to threaten war against a nation, it wouldn't in my view.
@kscharold So if our nation goes to war, our interpretation of the TOS is that POTUS can only use the platform if he doesn't say anything that threatens the enemy? If W or Obama tweeted their intent to capture or kill bin laden, wouldn't that too violate that TOS interpetation?
@SG I do think there is a difference between targeting individuals without due process vs the CIC threatening war against a nation state. And at least in the US, the law draws a clear distinction there as well re what's the role of the judiciary vs executive.
@teecres1 @jack @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Then isn't it better that we know his actions? Suspending his account won't change his policies. Just limits our visibility into them. Not like he won't nuke if he can't Tweet.

@leostamillo @JoannaG @mep @fzarife @guilhermerib @pgreenberger @dancarvs @magicandrew @CarlosMoreiraJr @KatieS Congrats Leo! Loved our adventures together!
@kscharold It's sort of circular for sure, but the reality is the world needs to know what the POTUS is thinking. That's doubly true if he's unhinged. We only know to be outraged if the thoughts are public. Nixon looked a lot different once the tapes exposed.
@kscharold Also, there is no greater good served by shining a spotlight on one random user's bad acts. But when the leader of the free world puts us all under threat, I feel that should be exposed more broadly, not supressed. Only then can needed outcry emerge.
@kscharold When it's a statement of US policy ‚Äî no matter how flawed the policy ‚Äî yes, I believe there is a distinction. Making everyday users safe from others ' abuse is different than saying the government should only be permitted to use the platform for pacifist policies.

@wdkatie @jack @Twitter @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Exactly. Congress has a role and responsibility to provide a check on the executive. Not Twitter's job to pretend he's not president and hope that solves everything.
If @jack &amp; @twitter are "complicit" in providing platform for @realDonaldTrump, then must also say they are "complicit" in supporting @HillaryClinton, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and other voices.

@JordanElderTV AGAIN with the potato???!?!
@lessin @finexploration @magic Will continue testing both probably through the end of the year before zeroing in on one to be my go-to. But if only one existed, I'd be happy with either ‚Äî both have been really helpful. P.S. Really loved the Fin blog the other day on the underlying tech.
@lessin @finexploration @magic I like also Fin's ability to do voice messages for easier said than typed requests, though admit I haven't used it yet.
@lessin @finexploration @magic Some degree of reminders of capabilities are good, as I admit at first I was unsure of what to ask, but I think Fin could dial back frequency of email campaigns a bit.
@lessin @finexploration @magic From marketing, it appears Fin is more advanced in capabilities but I am not totally clear on what the contrasts are ‚Äî all my tasks so far are ones I expect either could handle.
@lessin @finexploration @magic Magic's pricing seems lower for equivalent tasks, but when Fin's new "effective minutes" model kicks in, I wonder if that will change. I like not having to prepay a "use it or lose it" block, but would mind less if prepaid credits rolled over.
@lessin @finexploration @magic Both seem equivalent in turnaround time and quality of service so far, but wish each had support for more calendars (I have 2 Google and one iCloud) without cross-sharing them.
@lessin @finexploration @magic I like both. But to compare: I like ability to monitor progress and history in Fin app, and have control of saved data in the vault. Can give logins etc points to Magic, but no easy way to monitor/manage. I like SMS simplicity, but wish they had app too.

@lavin @SenJohnMcCain @MittRomney Not saying *criticism* was unfounded. But many went much further, undermining credibility of fair criticism then and now. (PS, cancer metaphors may be poor fit when talking about McCain.)
Fellow Dems who demonized W, @SenJohnMcCain and @MittRomney in 2000-2012 elections, and now in 2017 applaud them as voices of reason, consider: 		Crying "wolf!" all those years helped Trump, Bannon and crew dismiss critical contrast when it mattered. #FanaticalModerate
