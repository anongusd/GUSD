@evepeyser @PaulBegala Begala you are OUT of your mind. You have no cred. A partisan hack. VERY typical of lawyers.
So as you can see my account @SteveWCarlson has been unlocked. With an apology @RealJamesWoods https://t.co/cbsUxpgBqM
@TimOBrien @PaulBegala You're the ones claiming wealth brings standing. Grow a brain.
@benjaminwittes @jpodhoretz Couldn't use this in court could you?
@charliekirk11 Charlie, those were not elements of her psych-based strategy to beat the lie detector. She needed it all to be "Brett and I" and avoid the details other than the laughter.
@amyklobuchar Yeah, she looks like the one who used to make faces at the Chicanos as they sought representation in the governance system of the @umncla. Finally got us expelled from the board for seeking endorsement. Called it "disruptive." Black admin and regents didn't help. Yup. Opportunist
@CillizzaCNN Everyone, Chris? (I think I'm being shadowbanned so if you see this). Is it normal to lie to Congress about your work beating polygraphs? Is that normal Chris? @amyklobuchar I know you'll get the report and I suspect you'll keep secret the @fbi hopeful she trained.
@PhilipRucker Absolutely. Philip likes to slut-shame men for money.
@brithume I think the problem is that the friend's name has not been released, and #ChristineBlasleyFord needs to deny this or release the name for the @fbi to talk to. So let's not manufacture problems, Brit. I think @ChuckGrassley can handle it.
@ProudResister She lied to Congress
@RepAdamSchiff That's what we don't want Adam, @amyklobuchar
@SenatorCollins Uh, Susan, are you aware that @amyklobuchar and her gang are throwing women out of their #breastcancer coverage that YOU fund (at a 75%-25% @MedicaidGov match I believe?) https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@BuckSexton @CoryBooker actually thinks we're all as stupid as him. He benefits as tens of millions of black people, unborn, are slaughtered as if by King Herod himself.
@RealCandaceO Well I'm pretty sure you got one right here. @SenAmyKlobuchar. So I thought she was beating the truth by psychologically clinging to the most emotional parts as I watched her. It was always "Brett and I"? WHAT? Then she only talked about the emotion, laughter. And 100% sure how? https://t.co/MjyAnQR4dU
@thehill @SenBlumenthal she LIED to Congress. Is this your latest tactic to control the @USSupremeCourt?
@MNFarmLiving Sure, I'm interested in discussing a second track for agriculture in the trade talks so people don't starve and we can feed the world, and help the world feed itself, that kind of thing. Let's call it humanitarian trade. @potus @SecretarySonny https://t.co/KnkaeVuRnF
@KatrinaNation Well isn't this exactly what @SenAmyKlobuchar and @HillaryClinton and the evil @BarackObama and @AmbPower44 WANTED?? GET the Russians, Hillary lost because of RUSSIANS, RUSSIANS don't like gays and lesbians propaganda all that?
@thehill Tell the @FBI to get the name of the person #ChristineBlasleyFord coached (for money?) to beat a polygraph to try for a job in the FBI or DOJ, okay? Enquiring minds want to know. @BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/f16rMvwWL8
So @SteveWCarlson here is a person who remembers that @SenAmyKlobuchar @amyklobuchar was hanging out at the @umncla CLA Assembly organization in the 1970s when I was in the government. She represented #WalterMondale. Did not disclose. https://t.co/y1LhipzVNd
We won't be instructed by the @unitednations However, this effort should be made by us all to maintain food trade between us and China, to maintain our food capacity--humanitarian trade on a bi-lateral basis. @potus @vp @senatemajldr https://t.co/xPTnsaZ72f
@IndivisibleTeam If you vote for @SenAmyKlobuchar and @TinaSmithMN, men, then this is what you sign on for. "Union" guys, yep, these little sophomores leading you around by your nose. I prefer freedom as we have established with God's help. Don't be capped, fight back.
@BuckSexton Yes, @JeffFlake and @SenAmyKlobuchar the result of your forced @FBI investigation is the boyfriend swears he watched #ChristineBlasleyFord train a prospective agent (Some fbi job) to beat a lie-detector test, then lied to the @senjudiciary. Thanks. https://t.co/tJPaYH6IXP
@BuckSexton Yes, @amyklobuchar. We now know that #ChristineBlasleyFord used psychological manipulation to create a charge that could withstand a polygraph test. Because she trained an applicant for the @FBI and Dept of Justice. We need the NAME. Her technique is focusing on emotion not truth
@seanmdav @BuckSexton Plus isn't it 11 miles away?
@markknoller @senatemajldr @SenSchumer Yeah this is @amyklobuchar schtick as well. I don't go for it. https://t.co/IuNquCxIiR
@inforum Security threat.
@alixkendallfox9 @Slate Maybe that's what happened here. DA's aren't really famous, but attacking @BrettKavanaugh for drinking in past gives you that 15 minutes. @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/IQ8LhugTNe
@MSPBJnews @Twins Yep. @MLS @MNUFC attendance is extremely competitive with current @Twins attendance. Hey, maybe the two teams can cross-market to build attendance.
@journalsentinel She lied to Congress
@brd_dispatch She lied to Congress
@JonJustice AND @charliekirk11 coached and explained polygraph using psychology to a friend seeking employment with @fbi and @doj. I could see her using psychology. Just say Brett and I and focus only on deeply held core emotional beliefs. Only had two questions. Must have practiced w/polygr
@KTTCTV Turns out she lied to Congress.
@WSJ During the @MinnesotaDFL @USSenate primary I had an in-depth (for me) with a farmer and association officer about the impact of trade on #Minnesota ag. I concluded we need to develop a separate track for ag. Looks like the machinery is in place. https://t.co/KnkaeVuRnF
@thehill Would any of them lie to beat a polygraph to sink a judge? @maziehirono @amyklobuchar
@thedailybeast @MalcolmNance I assume #ChristineBlaseyFord is going to plead she didn't understand the question she lied about. But she better do it SOON.
@thedailybeast @MalcolmNance She lied to Congress.
@ProudResister @JeffFlake @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @BobCorker She lied to Congress. Give it up.

@GeorgeTakei She lied to Congress
@webertom1 She died of #breastcancer. What's behind that? Did she have it before? Is what happened to her going to happen to THESE women in cancer treatment? https://t.co/pJTVtEY5Fx Does @MPRnews care?
@thehill Yeah, look at THESE women, @HillaryClinton https://t.co/pJTVtEY5Fx #BreastCancerAwarenessMonth
@kylegriffin1 So....how does the hippocampus help you beat a polygraph if you're trying to get a job at the @fbi or @doj?
@StarTribune This is @RamseyCounty misconduct. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5 It's a BIG DEAL. And Lori Swanson is GONE.
@SethAbramson She lied to Congress.
@CNNPolitics She lied to Congress Chris @CillizzaCNN give it up.
@rgoodlaw @SethAbramson @7im Yes, ATTACK religious virgins!
@KellyForUs @amyklobuchar But now @LindseyGrahamSC says @SenAmyKlobuchar should apologize to @BrettKavanaugh and #ChristinaBlaseyFord lied to Congress! https://t.co/middnHcOMB
@MSNBC She lied to Congress @chucktodd @SenatorDurbin
@WalterHudson I got kicked off twitter for posting this photo of @amyklobuchar schnockered. Apparently this was when she was just @HennepinAtty. Probably hated her job. Note look of concern on her drinking companions. Nothing to see here. https://t.co/TeTsJsPo2H
@WalterHudson So, uh, how do you like new NAFTA? Don't like the use of tariffs?
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT She lied to Congress Peter.
@DavidCornDC She lied to Congress @matthewjdowd
@tribelaw She lied to Congress. You don't see a problem with that @mitchellreports?
@thehill She lied to Congress. @amyklobuchar
@joshtpm Well, this is what @foxnews is quoting: ""explained in detail what to expect, how polygraphs worked and helped [her] become familiar and less nervous about the exam," using her background in psychology." @brithume @ChuckGrassley charges she lied.
@AriFleischer @brithume Where's the letter. #fakenews is saying she just explained polygraphs to one federal job applicant.
@joshtpm #fakenews is doing defense for #ChristineBlaseyFord @brithume. Says she "explained" a polygraph for a FEDERAL job applicant. Yep, we need to know a LOT more about this. @FBI
@The_UnSilent_ @BettyMcCollum04 in broadcast debate with me in 2012: "A rape is a rape is a rape!"
@rockthesham @SenAmyKlobuchar I feel rage. And Jiff feels the rage, too, because @amyklobuchar is carrying out a #waronwomen #breastcancer patients! https://t.co/1tcEWbGsRB
@repmattdean @NickZerwas Look at what they're doing to #breastcancer patients! https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@jeffzeleny @CNN Obviously some of it was compelling while other parts were not credible. Is this hard?
@thehill Oh, I think they will though. Seems #ChristineBlaseyFord was so expert at beating polygraphs she COACHED people to do it. Did she actually get paid? Did she research it?
@hardball Yup, work-hard, play-hard. DEFINITELY a crime.
@SebGorka @LisaMarieBoothe Apparently @amyklobuchar drank as @HennepinAtty and candidate to succeed failed @USSenate member @GovMarkDayton. Looks that way anyway, and you can see concern on faces of her companions at the table. https://t.co/FFnEQPdC6b
@SebGorka Okay, so did @SenFeinstein lawyers even ask #ChristineBlaseyFord about this before they publicly boasted she had passed a lie detector test? Would this alter your judgment of this as a prosecutor @SenAmyKlobuchar? Did your law school cover this?
@jeffzeleny @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake Yes, he mocked the testimony which should not even have been brought.
@PioneerPress This is crazy and a threat to security, @amyklobuchar
@FOX9 I am truly sorry to hear this, and sorry for you Alan Page. Here's what we're facing on #breastcancer. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@soledadobrien That is exactly what I said @LindseyGrahamSC look at this, it explains @BrettKavanaugh question, which he asked all the drinkers who attacked him. #HowAboutYou? https://t.co/4DyB9t0icd
@rollcall Here's a rap, Anthony Delgado, called #fightlikeagirl. https://t.co/1tcEWbGsRB BTW Lori @swansonnolanMN LOST and is OUT. #Minnesota #breastcancer patients are safer because Swanson is out.
@AriFleischer @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, @SenAmyKlobuchar so I guess #ChristineBlaseyFord was coaching someone ELSE how to beat the polygraph. How interesting. So that's why it was rigged. And was it the first time she took it? Or second try or what?
@StephenRubis @NickZerwas Look at how #Minnesota is treating #breastcancer patients IN TREATMENT. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@RSVance @JoyceWhiteVance Minutiae LOL
@katekelly @joncoopertweets So the conclusion is he forgot to stand up straight? Is @SenAmyKlobuchar standing up straight in this photo? Maybe she forgot. She looks forgetful. https://t.co/J06fjfM0Zs
@rosadelauro Looks like #ChristinaBlaseyFord was coached how to rig the polygraph. Should we believe someone like that?
@NormOrnstein #HowAboutYou? Have YOU no shame, Norm? https://t.co/NlaNRsH4z2
@soledadobrien @Franklin_Graham sister is CORRECT. @SenAmyKlobuchar
@TinaSmithMN @javimorillo But I suppose you DO Have a way, @TinaSmithMN @SenTinaSmith? LOVE to hear it. @KarinHousley
@SenGillibrand @BettyMcCollum04 insisted in a debate with me "rape is rape is rape". Unless you're charged with it in which case it has to be defined, and proven. Under the U.S. Constitution.
@BettyMcCollum04 Dear Betty: @TheDemocrats DID cut @MedicareGov, @TheDemocrats DID cut @MedicareGov! https://t.co/UjPy2AZj0l
@BettyMcCollum04 @SenAmyKlobuchar Yep poise, dignity, and determination. https://t.co/eEuT7gXlLs
@SebGorka @WhoopiGoldberg In a live broadcast debate with me @bettymccollum04 told me "rape is rape is rape." I said, unless you are a man charged with it. Yes, this is what #genderquota gang @SenAmyKlobuchar and @bettymccollum04 are like.
@JFNYC1 @SebGorka @SenAmyKlobuchar "offensive and absurd." @MinnesotaDFL @EllisonCampaign
@jdawsey1 @senorrinhatch @SenAmyKlobuchar they're shouting #wewantkavanaugh! Same guy you had groveling because of his love of beer. Which you love also.
@BetoORourke If she would have shown a few material facts that might have avoided the @potus rejection of this charade. No she is NOT entitled by her gender or her troubled past to attack innocent judges. Nor are the @SenAmyKlobuchar democrats.
@RepAdamSchiff So, uh, Adam, what do you think about @DianneFeinstein lawyers rigging the polygraph. Would that be ethical?
@RealSaavedra @dbongino So @SenAmyKlobuchar take note: The @DianneFeinstein people were rigging the polygraph. Uh-oh.
@Amy_Siskind This is a #fakenews "journalist" yup
@heartisatwitta @CarolLeonnig Does this help?
@jmartNYT And here's @amyklobuchar I think when she was the DA. The AA DA. #howaboutyou https://t.co/ILS64OdMwi
@dog_rates @louisep95 Looks like Fred Flintstone.
@AshleyRParker @TimOBrien @PhilipRucker @SenAmyKlobuchar complicated relationship with alcohol. Leads #metoo AND #howaboutyou movements. https://t.co/Nk1V9gx4SI
@EllisonCampaign You have never uttered a PEEP about this. I have to do all the work myself because attorneys will not take it. It's about life and death of cancer patients, @keithellison. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5 Would you do the same thing if @KarenMonahan01 had #breastcancer? Probably.
@Bakari_Sellers @PaulBegala What about Central Park? Change in politicians proves something? What?
@CillizzaCNN Oh, you mean this contradiction Chris? @SenAmyKlobuchar leads #metoo	now she also leads #HowAboutYou? https://t.co/wClN38OGYO
@maggieNYT Oh, you're so proud.
@CillizzaCNN That's right. Baseless charge, which a prosecutor advised could never be brought.
@mitchellreports @PhilipRucker White men? Seriously? Ever watch to kill a mockingbird? Try to at least ACT professional.
@maggieNYT They're laughing that you would use a trumped up charge unfairly against the judge. Hey, Maggie, what's "exculpatory"? Do you know?
@jaketapper @benjaminwittes #fakenews king of lies.
@maggieNYT Sorry I can't be there to see the #fakenews get introduced to some good Americans.
@KSTP Looks like his son done set Keith up.
@jaketapper @SymoneDSanders @HolmesJosh @ScottJenningsKY @neeratanden @TheLeadCNN Here's sloppy drunk. https://t.co/w5FNLDyNdi
@thehill Like this one @ChrisCoons @JeffFlake? https://t.co/NSSElOQc5B
@thehill I don't think it preserves eleciton integrity to help @amyklobuchar by throwing me off twitter because I post this photo of @SenAmyKlobuchar getting schnockered as concerned companions look on. https://t.co/zqU0Xo6gjn
@jaketapper Oh you mean the ones @SenFeinstein hand-picked. And who played along hide their client's case from the @USSenate. Little details the "pro" #fakenews leaves out.
@SXMProgress @RepTedLieu @tedlieu @MSignorile He wasn't lying.
@brithume First, they didn't agree to anything. This was a concession. Second, it was one week. Cleared or not. If no wrongdoing is established, it's over. Clearing is not necessary @ChrisCoons
@SCClemons @JohnJHarwood @JeffFlake @AtlanticLIVE By her unfair attacks on @BrettKavanaugh @amyklobuchar is showing disrespect for the  @USSupremeCourt as well as for #Minnesota voters #mn2018
@kylegriffin1 @christinawilkie So I take it you have some great revelation that when Kavanaugh says he never had sex with women until several years after high you still believe he attempted to rape girls? This is why you are #fakenews you don't even acknowledge his testimony. He has to be like you right?
@CarolLeonnig @maggieNYT @emmersbrown @seungminkim Leonnig is not qualified to be a prosecutor because she's obviously biased. I'll point out that Mitchell had to cut off her questioning. Sad for someone claiming to be a professional.
@jdawsey1 @maggieNYT That's right.
@CillizzaCNN Think you're the echo in the  room, Chris.
@mitchellreports @Mimirocah1 Only animals like the #fakenews would expose a judge to this unfair attack and then taunt him. NOT a good reason to reject his nomination and we know you love guilt-free abortion and that's why you're doing this.
@jennifermayerle @WCCO @WCCORosen Mark I remember the time you interviewed me and Bill Paul about the treatment of some Gopher athletes who got some furniture from alumni. That was nice. I think they left them alone finally.
@AshaRangappa_ @PaulBegala @senatemajldr Actually it was your @BarackObama who had this responsibility. But he didn't care he was so sure @HillaryClinton would be elected. You're both disgusting liars.
@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy Yeah, Leahy how long have you been saying that. And #ChristinaBlaseyFord had NO RIGHT to hold up the nomination for months with her little games.
@seungminkim @senorrinhatch Yep, Hatch is correct. That's why you're getting paid. They trained you to parrot all this manipulative stuff and you get an award. Money, pats on the head.
@ezraklein Well, look at the questioner Ezra. I don't think that's unsafe. So as @potus said, he said he drank beer. He was honest. You get that but don't want to get that, you're pretending. https://t.co/laappkWRd1
@StarTribune You're a joke.
@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy Tell me about how Justice Scalia died, Mr. Leahy. Any thoughts on that? Is that the American way?
@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy Pat Leahy master of deceit.
@realDonaldTrump @parscale #writemein
So you better hope they find corroboration, @SenAmyKlobuchar. Because you're all in on this one and you can't walk it back. https://t.co/QwGVHDMff4
@electmnhousedfl You're not winning any points with me. @BarackObama is a DISASTER.
@ezraklein That's not the problem, Ezra. It's that SHE was drinking and can't remember any of the details. You keep selling your little schtick here Ezra. You got a gig. barf
@AaronBlake @CillizzaCNN It should go WAY down.
@ShannonLoehrke @MnSenateMedia @MNCommerce Maybe you could do something about the Minnesota women being cancelled when they are in #breastcancer treatment. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump vote for me against @amyklobuchar and I'll help you win even more.
@amyklobuchar Sorry for Mr. Page, my sympathies.
@mkraju LOL. Wait. He escaped to an elevator? Hasn't he learned his lesson?
"In one notable exchange, he snapped at Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., "Have you?" Schumer said Kavanaugh was "rudely interrupting" senators in a way he'd never seen from a witness." And @BrettKavanaugh did not snap at her, @SenSchumer https://t.co/9KFmohLBnY
@thehill What? He's on the Hill ranting? I'm so impressed.
@lisamurkowski @SenatorDurbin @US_FDA Yes, they are very bad for you. We should indeed help young Americans escape wretched death or heart disease, lung disease. Want a federal health program? Stop the smoking, stop abusing something Indians used for spiritual purposes. @AmericanCancer
@merica @christinawilkie I hope he loses. But, you can only hope.
@timelywriter @christinawilkie @AP Uh, it wasn't "white nationalist". It was American nationalist. People spurred on by @BarackObama to attack America and its history. Unfortunately, to get re-elected, Obama stirred up a lot of anti-white and anti-American (don't forget to kneel to disrespect her) strife. Sad.
@samstein Uh-huh. Show me the "criticism".
@SenatorDurbin Dick's got the lies down, @amyklobuchar. Well I don't buy them. I know for a fact that the Wilberforce Amendment was never enforced. Do you know what that is, Dick? Here, read it: https://t.co/zNJu2Tcu3a
@BairdStrib @StribLopez LOL Baird. Oh, and don't forget to leave candidates you don't like off your list of "candidates" you publish in your rag. That really makes them better voters, right? So people who read your stuff are "better voters"? Seriously??? That's marketing brands, not FREEDOM, dude.
@SenatorDurbin Oh sure, Dick, the WaPo "confirmed" it. Are you kidding? The LAW was supposed to be enforced by @BarackObama who INSTEAD used it to tell people to "punish your enemies"! What's wrong with you Dick? We can do a lot better than this. Look at some of my ideas. They're American.
Yes, @SenAmyKlobuchar Eddie was a big AA guy. Helped a lot of people. Very humane person. Used to play 2nd base in St. Louis Cardinals system I believe. VERY fast. Dexter Gordon liked his album abou Bebop and Soda Pop, I think it was called. NOT alcohol. @BrettKavanaugh
@GovMikeHuckabee @greta Pssst, Greta don't tip them off. Let them run themselves into the ground. They're already famous in history for what @SenAmyKlobuchar and others are doing, trying to be rabble-rousers.
If you think the song Eddie played was square, @amyklobuchar, check THIS out. https://t.co/gLe66aBhCl
@SenAmyKlobuchar I don't think @BrettKavanaugh is an alcoholic. Or you either, I hope. But this constitutional book had pretty good evidence about ethnic groups being selected out for the alcohol gene and the rates of alcholic I don't know, deaths, in these groups and time exposd
@amyklobuchar I didn't play any music at Ed's table, just talked with him between sets. He did point out the AQ's no dancing policy. But I guess he liked me from seeing me in the political cartoons of the @mndailynews. About my rumbles with YOU at @umncla. You weren't in cartoons
@amyklobuchar @BrettKavanaugh, Eddie Berger https://t.co/7DJSlFNUyB introduced me to people at his table, including Keith Peterson the Jazz Lawyer. Who eventually gave me a book showing the constitutional (physical) basis of the alcohol gene. Explained total abstinence is needed
@SenAmyKlobuchar Eddie Berger here https://t.co/7DJSlFNUyB was a customer of mine in Yellow Cab. Picked him up while his picture was on front page of @citypages and told me about his gigs. I was there every Sunday night Artists Quarters in Minneapolis from then on.
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar I'm not talking about your family. But my own grandfather had issues putting me at risk. My best friend at the time he died. I thank this guy https://t.co/7DJSlFNUyB for introducing me to some people. He like me because I didn't drink at his gigs.
So I am sharing instantly and hopefully without barriers, the idea that @amyklobuchar my opponent is being hypocritical in attacking @BrettKavanaugh for beer, but look at her here. I am not clear that this idea is prohibited. If it is, I must comply and ban it. @USSenate https://t.co/PyCVrsxMef

This is an election. Our 1st Amendment is intended to protect vigorous discussion of issues, like the treatment of @BrettKavanaugh by @amyklobuchar. BUT, @SenAmyKlobuchar has a lot of clout with @fbnewsroom and @twitter. So she suppresses views she dislikes. All hail!
@ShimonPro @maggieNYT your buddy @amyklobuchar got me run off twitter because I posted this photo. @SenAmyKlobuchar is not on trial here but she is up for re-election for @USSenate and I'm running a write-in against her. https://t.co/t2R1EeqO06
@ShimonPro @maggieNYT "After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party" 2/2
@ShimonPro @maggieNYT “her memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident. In her initial conversations with The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh’s role in the alleged incident with certainty. 1/3
@GovMikeHuckabee I do agree that when young men drink they do get rowdy. @mkraju I don't think this is disqualifying. I never drank until I returned from my first leave in the Air Force. To a desert. I joined the party and people were rowdy but okay with it. A way of bonding I guess.
@GovMikeHuckabee The guy was aggressive, @mkraju. Apparently he was panicking because someone thought he was a rock singer. Personally I would have just said hello and said I wasn't the singer and left it at that. The guys didn't have to leave.
@zackstephenson @BarackObama Barf...
@davidharsanyi @SebGorka Exactly @SenAmyKlobuchar DOES  believe that. She loves trashing a good man using the spotlight. Have you no shame, @amyklobuchar? @keithellison?
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump And I think @SenAmyKlobuchar @amyklobuchar needs to back off of her attacks on the @potus on trade until she learns a thing or two about how trade and the economy actually work. This is not a high school debating society. It's making hard policy for a nation and a world.
@SebGorka Long ago they lost their minds, when Harry Reid selected articulate black man (but not particularly American) @BarackObama to run against @HillaryClinton in 2008. They've been batsht crazy ever since. And actually when they adopted gender quotas. https://t.co/21fURDGwsI Really.
@jonathanchait @JohnJHarwood Let's pretend you're rational. Are you talking about the presidential election of 2016? And why would @senatemajldr be the one to take this to? I think it would be Obama would it NOT? So why are you pretending to have a "news story"? #fakenews
@JohnJHarwood That's right John. So? Here's @SenAmyKlobuchar no I am not a machine. https://t.co/kTFN8c0ODI
@SenWarren Senator, I think you know the issues here. And it's cruel for you to use them as a political pawn. Imagine that was you, Elizabeth. Would you want politicians to be insincere and dishonest at your expense? @SenAmyKlobuchar @amyklobuchar
@charliekirk11 So I guess they moved the agency out of the Department of War. So that's a good thing. But I think your numbers are wrong. And I hope @realDonaldTrump the master of management, will consider ways to address this. Indians are not a "group." Think you know that. Let's discuss.
@thehill Yes. It's hard to believe ANYONE is your friend @SenatorDurbin
@JohnJHarwood There are other parallels as well @senatemajldr. @SenAmyKlobuchar https://t.co/UsU2OogwHD
@amyklobuchar "Expand"? That's not enough jobs and I know that YOU know it's not enough jobs. And what's this myth "everyone" gets a "chance"? That's bunk, @SenAmyKlobuchar and I think you  know it's bunk. So this is election season B.S. @SteveWCarlson
Well, I have a library. I grabbed a Concise Dictionary of American History I bought for $1. Read quickly through entry "Agriculture" etc. As we approach this impasse with #China @POTUS I think it's urgent to map out ag policy just like we did in the past. That is what he's doing.
@christinawilkie @brianbeutler Well, of course they can if the incident did not happen.

@DavidAstinWalsh @JohnJHarwood I don't care
@JohnJHarwood Don't be ridiculous. @costareports stop with the racial stereotypes already.
@NateSilver538 @JohnJHarwood No he did none of those things Nate.
@rgoodlaw @MaddowBlog Who cares?
@christinawilkie I don't care.
@CRTV @AllenWest Don't forget @KarenMonahan01 son. How did @alfranken Charlie Nauen firm account for that?
@HaroldMeyerson @StribLopez That is false. Scalia died under mysterious circumstances. Not allowing Obama to capitalize on this is not illegitimate.
@BillKristol @StribLopez Obviously the arrogant Kristol (we all know) doesn't care about @USSupremeCourt abortion or any of that. Listen to your boss W, Bill.
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump @SenWarren you are talking to me. Time for what? Time to ruin the country again? @SenAmyKlobuchar

@RWPUSA Amazing that I am on same page as @RWPUSA on this. How about you, @amyklobuchar https://t.co/M2KhGkvTno
@RAMRANTS I agree. You agree @amyklobuchar? https://t.co/G2yyBvKZdX
@NBCNews This is what's happening in health care in #minnesota, @keithellison I think you know that. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@RBReich @ScottDibble These guys are bullies. https://t.co/rcFFm38R5s
@SINOradio @HildegardeLamki @PeepNuggets @wearesocial @AAF @RCamposDuffy @pdbowen @EconomyUS Thanks for follow I'm restricted for photo below follow me at @CampaignCarlson I think it's fair for @BrettKavanaugh to challenge on drinking for @amyklobuchar https://t.co/FFWgN1C9yH
@KamalaHarris You on the wagon? https://t.co/vGTHoZ66kJ
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump This is good news. Right, @amyklobuchar? @MinnesotaDFL
@timpugmire @KarinHousley @EllisonCampaign No, Lori @swansonnolanMN is too busy taking #breastcancer treatment away from patients on MA-BC. @KarenMonahan01 https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
Wow, @MinnesotaDFL give it up. https://t.co/TPBo1GHs69
@SecretarySonny How can @USDA help #minnesota farmers make planting and marketing decisions right now? When does the new tariff come online? @MNFarmfest
@Stowydad @MPRpolitics I reject this report. I also want to know, did @KarenMonahan01 know @IlhanMN and did Ilhan know @EllisonCampaign was going to drop out ahead of time?
@SarahPalinUSA Dear Sarah please take a look at this and help the #breastcancer patients. Thanks. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
Beautiful @Franklin_Graham @SteveWCarlson https://t.co/QRGxQWXqRx
@GOP Please consider this. Let #breastcancer patients have the protection of the law when challenging treatment by welfare officials controlling their MA-BC coverage. We can save lives! @MNCourts @MNcounties https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@gatewaypundit @TomFitton Wanna see the REAL @amyklobuchar? Yeah. https://t.co/tD6x6rdxiL
@VP @POTUS Great job. Admit it, this helps everybody @MinnesotaDFL
@pickensplan @KarlRove @PenguinUKBooks @SociablyDigital @realpolichick @pl1949 @tavilabradog Thanks for follow I'm restricted and at @CampaignCarlson for this photo. I think it's fair for @BrettKavanaugh to go after @USSenate drinker hypocrites. She has no shame. https://t.co/gJxOcjzbBO
@MPRnews I have concluded that the lawyer and @MinnesotaDFL are unsubstantiated and I reject this conclusion from @alfranken Charlie Nauen firm.
@henry_spinelli @rockthesham @aligiarc Don't forget @amyklobuchar she lays out with the boys in the bar plotting. https://t.co/8z1f9HCYUV
@StarTribune So basically @SteveWCarlson then @keithellison @EllisonCampaign gets off on a technically. So the accused is lying then. Hate to mention @amyklobuchar @HennepinAtty name here but for the gang-rapists it was that she liked it. Here @kenmartin73 works it out with @alfranken attorny
@KirstenPowers Well Kirsten instead of making these goofy remarks, do you have any actual evidence?
@EddieZipperer @dbongino So is mine, Dan. For simply posting THIS about Klobuchar. See me at @CampaignCarlson This photo is really something up close. From 2006 she was plastered. @BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/6BcY4vycdd
@FirstAvenue @Ana_Sia @ill_esha https://t.co/ZOz31usMlm #AllLivesMatter #WriteMeIn @ussenate November 6!
@jimblockey @T_Horner @NewsHour @Heritage @JimDeMint @Advertising__ @Advertising_Fan Thanks for following. I'm restricted at @SteveWCarlson I'm at @CampaignCarlson for this photo. But it's fair for @BrettKavanaugh to question Klobuchar. https://t.co/ogNslr4n2J
@KirstenPowers Here's a big name, Kirsten. https://t.co/RNHcogr6Fl
@brithume @KirstenPowers Then I say it's fair for the judge to raise the same issue against Klobuchar below. Because it's not a trial. https://t.co/2CM0dVOU9x
@brithume Now I don't this this photo is name-calling or verbal abuse. It raises the issue: Is it fair for @BrettKavanaugh to raise a defense that "truthfulness" about drinking is fair to raise against the @senjudiciary members if they're asking him. Probably a just strategy. https://t.co/P1qDgbnmvO
@brithume This photo of Klobuchar got me run off twitter today. @SteveWCarlson https://t.co/MgpYHgFAi1
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Find out what SHE'S drinking. https://t.co/n1XFvy80SL
@GovMikeHuckabee This is @SenAmyKlobuchar and I believe @BrettKavanaugh raised a fair point about her, @SenatorDurbin and others ALSO drinking and that it's not a crime. I got locked out of twitter for this, and she's locking me now. https://t.co/gZAmaXaB8U
@newtgingrich So FYI I'm hacked or something but temporary restriction on twitter for posting this honest photo of @SenAmyKlobuchar https://t.co/7ki1cVKuIB
@rockthesham Thanks for the follow. I'm restricted for posting the photo and am at @CampaignCarlson https://t.co/6rtyiymxpN
@1Deplorable42 Thanks for the follow. I got attacked for posting the picture below and I'm at @CampaignCarlson https://t.co/sDvnIgE31q
@ted_berner Thanks for the follow. I'm temporarily restricted so you can follow me at @CampaignCarlson. I posted this photo and I think I got hacked, I'm asking twitter. https://t.co/3YzWLIDDKx
@gatewaypundit @TheDemocrats @POTUS I can say this: This is a BIG deal for Minnesota and Minnesota farmers. I DO suggest, @realDonaldTrump and @SecretarySonny that you issue communications to #Minnesota #farmers tying in your assistance in crop switching and marketing and the new trade agreement. @amyklobuchar #npr
@philipaklein Have ya seen this? https://t.co/BRXqB6vueQ
@cspan @POTUS But he-e-e-er's @AMYKLOBUCHAR! The grand inquisitor, taking a break with friends. https://t.co/JQfUucizYW
@rollcall This is what the real @amyklobuchar is all about. Nice front on TV though. GREAT question by @BrettKavanaugh https://t.co/fbIpL3uxGf
@latimesent @latimes My thoughts on #Maga @kanyewest: https://t.co/ZOz31usMlm Also, who is "Lana Del Rey"?
@mitchellreports @maziehirono Here, maybe this will help. @amyklobuchar is right up there with Big Joe! 15 minutes of fame! https://t.co/J4P9A0Ovdt
@GOP @realDonaldTrump This is really great. Still waiting to hear from @SenAmyKlobuchar about the new trade agreement. I don't think @NewbergerJim will be enthusiastic, but believe me Minnesota farmers @MNFarmfest need these markets. Let's hook up with the @SecretarySonny aid to make it clear.
@ArthurSchwartz @SebGorka Here's a photo showing @amyklobuchar my opponent at a local establishment. My account was hacked and locked because of this. Still trying to resolve it. https://t.co/sVygGD7Gyc
@HHSGov So be aware that if any of these ladies are nearing 65 their life is at greater risk, because in the middle of their #breastcancer treatment their state, like @E_J_Piper @DHSCommPiper can cancel their treatment insurance. So yeah, all those young women.. https://t.co/UcWeMZ08l5
@RealJamesWoods look at this. Just because I posted this picture of @SenAmyKlobuchar, @twitter is helping her by giving me the 5th degree treatment. Can't anything be done under free speech or something? @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/obffpR2jwE
Dear @TwitterSupport you have locked me out of my account @SteveWCarlson because I'm saying @SenAmyKlobuchar has been drinking in Minneapolis bars while she is trying to destroy @BrettKavanaugh nomination for underage drinking charges. Please unlock that account. My phone changed
@senjudiciary @OrrinHatch @ChuckGrassley Please note that because I am surfacing photos of @SenAmyKlobuchar in a Minneapolis bar drinking, @Twitter is locking me out of my account. Really? Can't they just tell me I can't post certain information? @jack Hey, tell me I'll take down https://t.co/Po300KHRSz
@SteveWCarlson @politico So was this the Russians surfacing this picture of @amyklobuchar drinking next to Joe McCarthy? Or do incumbents have so much power they can make their opponents disappear in the United States of America? Did @SenAmyKlobuchar take steps to suppress this? @potus @BrettKavanaugh
@SteveWCarlson @senorrinhatch So why would this photo be such a problem? Isn't this free speech? Does @amyklobuchar have absolute power over twitter @potus @BrettKavanaugh? https://t.co/wRcAJ5mfYR
