AARP's statement on the Senate Finance Committee Rx price hearing easrlier this week: https://t.co/Bx40yFn42W		It‚Äôs time for legislation that deals with the root cause of #drugprices: price gouging by big drug companies. #StopRxGreed
Americans agree: enough talk, it‚Äôs time to ACT: https://t.co/7TzZ1PjURG @alikodjakNPR		Congress, we need real solutions that lower Rx prices &amp; crack down on price gouging by big drug companies. #StopRxGreed, NOW.
That means they either:		1‚É£Skipped a dose.	2‚É£Cut their pill in ¬Ω.	3‚É£Didn‚Äôt fill their prescription at all.		That should be unacceptable in this country. American lives are at RISK because they can‚Äôt afford the medicine they need. #StopRxGreed.
A new @KaiserFamFound study finds nearly 3 in 10 Americans didn't take a prescription as recommended by their doctor‚Äîdue to high price. https://t.co/VFhA4PRSOs
On Tuesday, pharma CEOs were asked WHY Americans pay among the HIGHEST Rx prices in the world.		Spoiler alert: they couldn‚Äôt answer.		AARP‚Äôs @jhishta recaps Tuesday‚Äôs hearing üëá #StopRxGreed, NOW: https://t.co/WZrs07TcbU https://t.co/SZqNsbQYGL

Addressing hand-over-fist escalation of drug prices is a top priority as I lead the agenda for the Senate Finance Committee - @ChuckGrassley		We're glad to hear that. It‚Äôs time to #StopRxGreed and hold big drug companies accountable! https://t.co/5WeAOBHKXF
Today, PhRMA execs shifted blame &amp; dodged questions on skyrocketing Rx prices. Shameful. It‚Äôs time for Congress to ACT on real solutions that lower prices.		ICYMI: AARP's Capitol Hill Strike Force volunteers in action today üëáüí™üëáüí™ #StopRxGreed https://t.co/9qZOU2pNYr
AARP supports solutions that lower #drugprices, not just simply shifting costs around within the healthcare system. #StopRxGreed
This is particularly problematic given that drug company executives wouldn‚Äôt commit to lowering their prices if the proposed rebate rule is implemented: https://t.co/NLIrWc1AXt (@bobjherman, @sam_baker)
However, we are concerned that the recently proposed rebate rule could lead to higher Part D premiums for ALL Medicare beneficiaries and higher costs for the Medicare program.
We are glad that bipartisan members of Congress have made it clear today that #drugprices MUST be lowered.

Congress, it‚Äôs long past time to take action and lower #drugprices for the MILLIONS of Americans who can‚Äôt afford their lifesaving medications.		AARP &amp; our 38 million members are watching and we expect you to hold #PhRMA accountable!üí™
As Senators from both sides of the aisle address #PhRMA advertising, here‚Äôs a reminder üëá		Big drug companies spent a staggering $3.73 BILLION on TV ads in 2018: https://t.co/MogU7IY5Qa. That's $300 million more than they spent in 2017. #StopRxGreed
.@SenWhitehouse: Is it true that Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world? ‚Äî #PhRMA CEOs say as an average that would be true. 		Outrageous.
From @SenatorHassan: Breakthroughs aren‚Äôt breakthroughs if people can‚Äôt afford them. 		Exactly. #StopRxGreed
It‚Äôs simple, Americans are paying among the HIGHEST #drugprices in the WORLD‚Äîand it‚Äôs time for that to change. #StopRxGreed https://t.co/iTPc9tFu6O
At the same time, Americans are choosing between paying rent, groceries, car repairs and paying for the medications they NEED.		Sickening. We need meaningful action to #StopRxGreed!
The seven drug companies testifying today have a combined annual revenue of $297 BILLION. https://t.co/7Yg6eMPqpv
And #drugprices‚Äîlike @abbvie‚Äôs widely used drug Humira‚ÄîKEEP rising.		Enough is enough! It‚Äôs time for Americans to be able to afford the medications the NEED.
Who funds #drugcompany research for new drugs? American tax payers, who contribute $200M in grants to develop these drugs.
One way to lower prices? @ChuckGrassley mentions the bipartisan #CREATESAct, which works to reduce Rx prices &amp; increase competition. We agree. 		Americans need sustainable solutions that actually LOWER prices.
.@pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talked about breakthrough medications that save patients lives‚Äîyet in 2017 they exceeded the general inflation rate of 2.1% by increasing their retail price by 13.8%.		Shameful. Congress, it‚Äôs time to #StopRxGreed and lower prices, NOW.
Unacceptable. Americans should NOT be paying Rx prices that are more than their yearly salary. #StopRxGreed
.@abbvie recently acquired Humira‚Äîthe most LUCRATIVE product in PhRMA history, bringing in nearly $18B annually.		So what does AbbVie do? More than doubles the price &amp; charges Americans $38K per year. https://t.co/MRnEBTcL7o
FACT: Revlimid costs about $20K for a 30-day supply. A patient on Medicare Part D pays about $1K per month, PLUS a $5K copay. 		It‚Äôs time for change. Older Americans can‚Äôt afford to pay among the HIGHEST prices in the world!
ALSO, the company plans to acquire cancer treatment drug Revlimid, which has risen about 145% in $$$ since it was first approved.
One note on @bmsnews while CEO Giovanni Caforio speaks‚Äîthe company currently sells cancer treatment Opdivo at $150,000 annually‚Äîgenerating BILLIONS in revenue.
Thank you, @GrassleyPress &amp; @RonWyden for holding these drug companies accountable. It‚Äôs time to #StopRxGreed!
.@RonWyden ‚Äî ‚ÄúI was there when 7 big tobacco CEOs testified...they lied that day. @GrassleyPress and I expect more this morning.‚Äù		‚ÄúIt‚Äôs long past time to STOP the excuses and take concrete action to make medicine in America more affordable.‚Äù https://t.co/kfScScyzGL
Please, explain to us how this is sustainable. Older Americans deserve bipartisan legislation that LOWERS Rx prices! #StopRxGreed
Meanwhile, the average Part D enrollee takes 4.5 prescriptions per month with a median income of less than $26,000.
Sen. Wyden is correct‚Äî@AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot once said he is the ‚Äúlowest paid CEO in the WHOLE industry,‚Äù and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúannoying to some extent‚Äù‚Äî Soriot makes $12M annually.		Hang on while we find the worlds SMALLEST violin üéª
‚ÄúDrug prices are high because that‚Äôs how PhRMA wants them. American families are hurdling along in the passenger seat, terrified on what comes next.‚Äù - @RonWyden
.@GrassleyPress on the outrageous cost of drug prices: American people deserve straight answers and REAL solutions. #StopRxGreed
Before we begin‚Äîhere‚Äôs a fun fact: @GrassleyPress &amp; @RonWyden invited a number of #drugmakers to testify in January, but only two accepted. 		However, after BOTH sides of Congress put serious pressure, 7 execs decided to show today.

November 6 is almost here. Any member of Congress who voted the wrong way should understand the consequences of ignoring AARP‚Äôs 38 million members.
You can see who voted:		‚úîÔ∏èYes on an #AgeTax that could have cost you $13,000 a year	‚úîÔ∏èYes to deny coverage to people with conditions like cancer or diabetes		You can also see who did the right thing and voted NO.
We promised you we‚Äôd publish a list of each and every member of Congress, and how they voted on last year‚Äôs bad health care bills. And we‚Äôve made good on that promise. https://t.co/MhU2KqLbga

Rest assured, AARP and our 38 million members remain vigilant and will oppose any ongoing attempts by the pharmaceutical industry to roll back the progress that has been made to help lower drug costs for seniors.
The Medicare Part D improvements that are now law as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 will save seniors billions of dollars in their out-of-pocket prescription drug costs.
Reversing the progress made under current law will increase prescription drug costs for older Americans while providing a windfall of billions of dollars to the drug industry. We urge Congress to reject any attempt to roll it back and to do more to lower drug costs.
Thanks to the efforts of thousands of AARP members, we successfully beat back PhRMA‚Äôs latest back room attempts to weaken the recent Medicare Part D donut hole improvements as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.

On behalf of our 38 million members, we strongly urge Congress to stand up to PhRMA and reject any attempts to reverse the Part D donut hole deal. Any change to the current law will simply be a windfall for the pharmaceutical industry that will only raise seniors‚Äô drug costs.
At a time when seniors are struggling to afford high drug prices, we need to be doing more, not less, to help lower their drug costs and we certainly should not roll back the progress that has been made.
The Part D donut hole improvements, which are now law, are good for seniors. These improvements will save seniors billions of dollars in out-of-pocket costs on their prescription medications by moving them through the Rx coverage gap faster, which results in lower co-payments.

AARP, on behalf of our 38 million members, will continue to fight for affordable quality health coverage, including fighting against any plans that would impose an #AgeTax or discriminate against those with preexisting conditions.
Think this doesn't matter? Before the ACA, many insurers charged older Americans 10x or more for health care, making insurance unaffordable for MILLIONS.		Consumer protection matters. Not being allowed to discriminate MATTERS.
How? By dramatically undermining the individual market, leading to $$$ premiums for people who need good coverage by encouraging the creation of plans that don't meet basic consumer protection standards.
Among the hardest hit will be Americans age 50-64. Six million rely on the individual health insurance market. 40% have a preexisting condition like cancer. These plans are a direct attack on their health care &amp; the core consumer protections of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Put simply: short-term plans are cheap for a reason: 		*they can discriminate against people with preexisting conditions	*they can impose a crushing #AgeTax on people 50+	*they don‚Äôt have to adhere to community rating standards	*they aren‚Äôt required to cover essential benefits
We're proud to voice our support for a coalition of health care advocates, including @LittleLobbyists, @NPWF, @AIDS_United, @NAMICommunicate and more, who have brought suit against the administration's new rule on short-term, limited-duration health plans.

We have heard a lot of talk from Congress about reining in high drug costs.  Now is the time for action that matches their rhetoric. #PeopleOverProfits
PhRMA may be spending millions to overturn this law, but we have the power of our 38 million members - and we believe we can win. Call Congress at 1-844-453-9953 and remind them they‚Äôre supposed to represent YOU, not drug company profits. #PeopleOverProfits
What‚Äôs worse is that over 155 Republicans and 50 Democrats have already taken the bait and signed onto a pro-PhRMA letter, taking the side of Rx companies over their own constituents. Absolutely shameful.
Now they‚Äôre lobbying Congress to overturn a law that lowered Medicare Part D drug costs for millions of seniors.
PhRMA is nervous, and they should be. Americans are struggling to pay the highest drug prices in the world while PhRMA is raking in billions.  Enough is enough.

The average Part D enrollee takes 4.5 medications a month. 	The median income of Medicare beneficiaries is less than $26,200. 	Older Americans cannot afford for Congress to go back on their promise.
Let's be clear: Americans already pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world. In 2015 alone, the cost of brand-name drugs used by older Americans has risen by 15.5%.
The ink is barely dry on the original deal, yet #BigPhRMA is already spending millions to try and protect their profits, so they can continue price-gouging older Americans.
AARP supported the important Part D donut hole reforms included in the BBA, and we strongly oppose any efforts to re-visit that deal that would increase Rx costs and fail to provide relief to older Americans struggling to afford needed medications.
UPDATE: On behalf of our 38 million members, we sent a letter to the 205 members of Congress who support big #PhRMA‚Äôs desire to roll back the #Medicare Part D donut hole deal -- included in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  Read the letter here: https://t.co/ta3l9yBUXh

AARP will continue to fight for adequate, affordable health coverage, including fighting against any #AgeTax and against discrimination for those with pre-existing health conditions.
Skimpy plans are a direct attack on the core consumer protections of the ACA. Among the hardest hit will be the ~6 million Americans aged 50-64 who use the marketplace, and the 40% of Americans 50-64 who have a preexisting condition.
Skimpy health plans can:		-charge older Americans an #AgeTax amounting to thousands of $$		-discriminate if you have cancer, diabetes, arthritis, or dozens of other common conditions		-refuse to cover essential health benefits like emergency care, prescription drugs &amp; more
BREAKING: The Administration has released its final rule on Short-Term Limited Duration Plans, or "skimpy" health plans. This rule will dramatically undermine the existing market &amp; lead to higher premiums by creating plans that don‚Äôt meet consumer protection standards.

Our nation cannot afford to return to pre-ACA days and lose hard-fought gains. AARP strongly believes the ACA is constitutional and is ready to defend our position in court.
Let's not mince words. The lack of affordable health care leads to worse health outcomes and even death. It negatively impacts people's financial security, and not only personal health, but the overall economic health of the nation.
Bottom line: a ruling in favor of Plaintiffs is NOT in the public interest. It would have a catastrophic effect on the health and financial stability of all Americans, especially older adults, those with pre-existing conditions, and millions with employer-based insurance.
Doing away with these critical protections will also re-open the Medicare Part D ‚Äúdoughnut hole," forcing seniors to pay even more out-of-pocket for their prescription drugs.
What does that mean? A 60 year-old could see her premium increase to a staggering $18,000/year, if she is charged 5x more than her younger counterpart. And the ACA's financial assistance would no longer exist.
Under the ACA: insurance companies can't price gouge based on age or gender. If this challenge succeeds, insurers could charge 50-64 year olds up to 10 times more than everyone else.
More than 1 in 4 Americans - an estimated 52 MM people - has a pre-existing health condition. If this challenge succeeds, an insurer could deny them coverage or charge astronomical premiums.
Let's be clear. The old days were NOT the good days when it came to health care. Before the ACA, the number of uninsured 50-64 year olds shot up from 5.2 MM in 2000 to an alarming 9.3 MM in 2012.  Thanks to the ACA, that number dropped to 5.4 million in 2016.
What happened? A new threat has emerged in the form of a court challenge, Texas v. United States, which claims the ACA is unconstitutional and should be struck down. And last week, the Department of Justice declined to defend the law.
AARP strongly opposes any attempts to take away the ACA‚Äôs protection for people with pre-existing health conditions or bring back an unfair #AgeTax on older adults.

AARP recommends that the Commission amend its proposal and adopt the state trust definition of best interest - which the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) also adopted. @DavidCertner #NoBadAdvice
AARP has long stated that a suitability standard does not protect investors from the potentially detrimental impact of conflicted advice. @DavidCertner #NoBadAdvice
Absent a full fiduciary standard, investors will continue to be vulnerable and will not receive the protections they need and deserve. @DavidCertner #NoBadAdvice
Unfortunately, in its current form, the Commission‚Äôs proposed Regulation Best interest does not impose a fiduciary standard and further fails to define the contours of the ‚Äúbest interest‚Äù standard.  @DavidCertner #NoBadAdvice
AARP has long supported advice in the best interest of individuals saving or investing. To that end, AARP was very supportive of the DOL‚Äôs fiduciary rule, which required that retirement investment advice be in the best interest of the client.

High-priced drugs hurt Americans of all ages, and seniors, who on average take 4.5 medications a month, are particularly vulnerable.
In particular, we need to take further steps to lower the cost of health care, especially the ever-rising price of prescription drugs. No good reason exists for Americans to continue paying the highest brand name drug prices in the world.
We need to work together in a bipartisan manner to strengthen these vital social insurance programs to ensure they can meet their benefit promises for current and future generations.
Social Security and Medicare remain critical to the income and health security of all Americans, and today‚Äôs reports again show that while the programs remain strong, there are challenges ahead for the long term.

AARP will continue its efforts to fight on behalf of consumers who want financial advice in their best interest.  It is hard enough to save for retirement ‚Äì we should do all we can to make sure retirement savers are getting the help they need.

ICYMI: On Wednesday, April 25, AARP leaders &amp; volunteers from every state traveled to Capitol Hill and met with lawmakers to push for medical expense tax relief, SNAP protections and support for family caregivers. https://t.co/ReokcXP5kj #AARP2018
AARP firmly opposes the proposed cuts &amp; changes to SNAP that would negatively impact 43 million Americans who depend on this vital safety net. We urge Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure these cuts &amp; changes are taken out of the House Farm Bill. #ProtectSNAP
@Rogermayz1 Roger, to the nearly 1 in 7 older Americans that rely on these benefits, SNAP means not having to choose between food and other expenses like heating bills or medical care.
@US_1st AARP is non-partisan, full-stop. We do NOT endorse any political parties or candidates. We have a LONG history of working with ALL elected officials to protect the benefits you've earned.
@Darla61a Darla, our advocacy decisions are based on what‚Äôs best for our members and all people 50+.
@ConnieAustinTX Connie, for 60 years, AARP has been fighting on the behalf of older Americans and their families. One in seven seniors depend on SNAP benefits. For them, SNAP means not having to choose between food and other expenses like heating bills or medical care.

Seniors around the country rely on SNAP for food and nutrition assistance. But some members of Congress are proposing drastic cuts to SNAP in the upcoming Farm Bill.

As the debate continues, we urge Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to #ProtectSNAP and preserve the program‚Äôs ability to carry out its important mission in providing nutrition to America‚Äôs vulnerable populations.
Denying people's access to SNAP benefits for up to three years for not being able to comply with tough work requirements could increase food insecurity and likely have negative consequences on health. Approximately 10MM adults age 50+ struggle with food insecurity.
Most people who receive SNAP benefits and are required to work already do work. Expanding work requirements for SNAP would be especially burdensome for older workers who take longer than younger workers to find employment after being unemployed.
Categorical eligibility is essential to improving access to SNAP for low-income Americans of all ages and must be protected. Categorical eligibility leads to people receiving their SNAP benefits faster &amp; reduces the number of people who may be facing hunger.
SNAP is a critical safety net for low-income families, including many older Americans and people w/ disabilities. 43 million Americans depend on SNAP for food and nutrition assistance, including one in seven older Americans.

AARP supports the administration's efforts to crack down on drug company monopolies blocking Americans‚Äô access to lower-cost medications. We also urge Congress to pass the bipartisan CREATES Act immediately. #PeopleOverProfits https://t.co/iuoB3LALaB
As the debate continues, we urge Congress to work together on a bipartisan basis to #protectSNAP and ensure the final bill includes these important policies that are critical for low-income older adults.
AARP urges Congress to #ProtectSNAP, specifically:		-Refrain from making benefit cuts to SNAP	-Reject any expansion to the law‚Äôs work requirements	-Continue to protect categorical eligibility	-Allow grandparents to apply for benefits on behalf of children in their care		And more.
And SNAP helps with more than food. By freeing up resources otherwise needed for food costs, SNAP also plays a key role in helping people afford basic necessities like housing and utility expenses.
Approx 10MM adults age 50+ struggle with food insecurity, and the negative consequences are dire. They‚Äôre 2x as likely to report being in poor health, 53% more likely to die of a heart attack, 52% more likely to develop asthma, and 60% more likely to suffer from depression.
SNAP is the nation‚Äôs largest nutrition assistance program, critical to low-income families including seniors &amp; people w/ disabilities. It helps nearly 43 MILLION Americans purchase food for themselves and their families.

The federal budget must reflect a commonsense approach to our nation‚Äôs current and future health and economic security needs, and we look forward to working with Congress and the Administration to satisfy them. &lt;END THREAD&gt;
Last, AARP strongly supports maintaining funding of all existing housing choice vouchers. Rental assistance vouchers help more than 2.2 million very low-income households, including an estimated 600,000 elderly and 1.2 million disabled individuals.
SSA budget cuts have already left many people‚Äôs claims sitting on shelves for months or even years, and the current proposal would cut SSA by an additional $400MM. This is outrageous.
Third, AARP is calling on Congress to increase, not cut, Social Security Administration (SSA) funding to ensure seniors &amp; people with disabilities get the services they need.
We urge that states be required to maintain the ACA‚Äôs core consumer protections: 	-prohibiting discrimination for preexisting conditions	-protecting older Americans from an #AgeTax	-requiring health insurance plans to cover essential health benefits
We support reinsurance funding, which ensures more affordable premiums for all market participants, and cost-sharing reduction (CSR) funding, which provides help for low-income consumers to lower their out-of-pocket costs.
Second, AARP urges Congress to take action to strengthen ACA marketplaces and protect affordability &amp; coverage for millions of Americans, including the six million 50-64 year olds that get their coverage through these marketplaces.
Older Americans are already struggling to afford the medicine they need. We urge Congress to stand up to big drug companies, put #PeopleOverProfits, and protect lower drug costs for seniors.
First, AARP supports closing the Medicare Part D doughnut hole one year earlier &amp; providing beneficiaries with a higher discount on their prescription drugs when in the coverage gap. We oppose any efforts to roll back that progress.

As the debate continues, we urge Congress to work together on a bipartisan basis to ensure that any final package includes these important health care improvements without shifting more costs onto Medicare beneficiaries.
However, we remain strongly opposed to increasing premiums for Medicare Part B &amp; Part D beneficiaries. Higher income-related premiums risk driving seniors out of Medicare and undermining support for the Medicare program.
We also support the expedited closing of the Medicare Part D ‚Äúdonut hole‚Äù to 2019 and are pleased this legislation adds generic biologic drugs to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program, which will lower out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.
69% of seniors have at least 2 chronic diseases that lead to difficulties walking, bathing, or going to the doctor. Rehabilitation services are critical to maintaining their independence so they don't have to go into a nursing home or face frequent, costly hospitalizations.

@perlop When the exceptions were in place, Medicare beneficiaries paid only the 20 percent coinsurance that Part B requires. Without the exceptions, Medicare beneficiaries must pay the entire therapy bill once they exceed the threshold.
@perlop The latest exception expired Dec. 31, which means the caps of $2,010 for physical and speech language therapy and $2,010 for occupational therapy are now being enforced. These services fall under Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services.
@perlop For decades, Medicare has capped how much it will pay for physical, speech &amp; occupational therapy. Ever since the limits were imposed, Congress has passed an automatic exception that allows Medicare to pay for care beyond caps when the treatments are deemed medically necessary.

Despite these provisions, AARP cannot support the tax bill due to the negative impact it would have on older adults.		We're all for making the tax code fairer. But exploding the deficit, forcing Medicare cuts, and hiking taxes on millions of seniors is not the way to do it.
We are also pleased the bill retains the additional standard deduction for those age 65+ and rejects proposals to make significant changes to the tax treatment of retirement contributions.
We appreciate that the bill retains the medical expense deduction which is critical to Americans with high health costs, many of whom are seniors.		AARP activists &amp; volunteers worked hard to protect the 8.8MM Americans who count on this deduction. https://t.co/ODbjtPDcEq
An AARP analysis found people age 50-64 could face average premium hikes of up to $1,500 a year due to individual mandate repeal. https://t.co/HQVijscWJ0?
This tax bill is also a health care bill ‚Äì and not a good one. The repeal of the individual mandate will:	‚ÄîIncrease premium costs by 10%	‚ÄîResult in 13 million fewer Americans having health insurance.
As years go by, cuts could get worse. The worrying potential outcome:	 	1‚É£ Tax bill explodes the deficit.	2‚É£ Calls for greater spending cuts begin.	3‚É£ Critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid end up being slashed, hurting already vulnerable populations.
Exploding the deficit would jeopardize the nation's ability to fund critical programs serving older Americans ‚Äì and not just "down the road."		The nonpartisan CBO says Medicare would be cut by $25 billion NEXT YEAR alone. Unacceptable.
As written, the tax bill would:	‚ÄîExplode the deficit by $1.5 trillion	‚ÄîPut critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid at risk	‚ÄîLikely increase taxes on many older Americans	‚ÄîIncrease health care costs &amp; lower coverage.		Our full statement: https://t.co/wadvsdkCW4

It's not over. This bill must now be reconciled with the House version. We will keep fighting on behalf of these important issues. To our members: stay tuned for ways you can get involved. &lt;END THREAD&gt;
We urge Congress to work together to enact tax legislation that better meets the needs of older Americans and the nation.
As with the last major tax reform effort a generation ago, AARP will support legislation that makes the tax code more equitable, promotes growth, and produces sufficient revenue to pay for critical national programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
We are pleased the bill maintains the medical expense deduction, including temporarily restoring the deduction to 7.5%, which is critical to seniors with high health care costs. We will fight to ensure any final bill protects seniors from an unfair #HealthTax.
We will keep fighting on behalf of our 38 million members and all Americans age 50 and older to ensure these critical programs are not cut.
&lt;THREAD&gt; We are disappointed the Senate passed a tax bill that will: 		 ‚ÄîExplode the deficit	 ‚ÄîPut Medicare, Social Security, &amp; Medicaid at greater risk 	 ‚ÄîRaise taxes on more than 5 million seniors 	 ‚ÄîIncrease health care costs &amp; reduce those with insurance by 13 million

We're all for making the tax code fairer. But irresponsibly¬†exploding the deficit, forcing Medicare cuts, and hiking taxes on millions of seniors isn't the way to do it.
This tax bill is also a health care bill - and not a good one. It would mean higher costs AND less coverage for older Americans.	¬†	An AARP analysis found people age 50-64 would face average premium hikes of up to $1,500 a year. 		https://t.co/HQVijscWJ0?
Then there's the tax hikes. This bill creates winners and losers. An AARP analysis found many seniors would be left paying more, not less:		‚û°Ô∏è 1.2MM seniors would get a tax hike right away		‚û°Ô∏è 5.2MM would get one by 2027	¬†	https://t.co/gpg1njF7yf
Exploding the deficit would jeopardize the nation's ability to fund critical programs serving older Americans - and not just "down the road." The nonpartisan CBO says Medicare would be cut by $25BN NEXT YEAR alone. 		Such sweeping cuts would hurt an already vulnerable population.
As written, the Senate tax bill would:		‚ÄîExplode the deficit		‚ÄîPut critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid at risk		‚ÄîRaise taxes on more than 5 million seniors		‚ÄîIncrease health care costs &amp; lower coverage		https://t.co/Sg7O4sNuEE

Congress: We urge you to work in a bipartisan manner to enact tax legislation that better meets the needs of older Americans and the nation. 		AARP stands ready to work with you toward that end.
We remain committed to stopping a new #HealthTax and keeping the medical expense deduction threshold at 7.5%. 		We also urge the family caregiver tax credit (Credit for Caring Act) to be included in the final bill.
We do greatly appreciate that H.R. 1 does not change the tax treatment of retirement contributions, which would have affected many Americans saving for the future.
The CBO has already said that H.R. 1 will trigger:	- Automatic cuts of $136B in FY2018	- $25B of which must come from Medicare.		This is unacceptable.
The deficit increase will inevitably lead to calls for dramatic cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other critical programs serving older Americans.
Also troubling is the negative effect H.R. 1 will have on the nation‚Äôs ability to fund critical priorities. 		H.R. 1 will increase the deficit by:	- $1.5 trillion over the next ten years	- An unknown amount beyond 2027
#TaxReform should not result in a disproportionate, adverse impact on older Americans.		Yet AARP estimates that H.R. 1 will increase taxes on:	- 1.2 million taxpayers age 65+ in 2018	- 4.9 million older taxpayers by 2027
We are all for legislation that makes the tax code more equitable and efficient, promotes growth, &amp; produces sufficient revenue to pay for critical national programs like Medicare and Medicaid.	 	H.R. 1 in its current form does not meet these criteria.

AARP will keep fighting on behalf of our 38 million members to ensure our elected leaders focus on lowering costs and improving care.
All Americans need and deserve affordable premiums, lower out-of-pocket costs, and coverage they can count on as they age.
We support the recent open and bipartisan efforts by Senators Alexander and Murray to work on market stability legislation.
We strongly encourage Washington to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions to lower health care costs and increase coverage.
The answer here is NO. Ending these subsidies could devastate millions of Americans, leaving them unable to afford health care.
We ask ourselves the same simple question with each health care action: does it lower costs and increase coverage for the American people?
See our full research on how CSRs protect consumers from out-of-pocket costs- with exclusive state-by-state numbers: https://t.co/wm5FwN2hnK
For example, in 2017, subsidies kept out-of-pocket limits $5600 lower, on average, for people between 100-150% of the federal poverty limit.
These subsidies help 6 million people, including more than 2 million older Americans, afford the health insurance they need.
We strongly oppose the Administration‚Äôs decision to stop funding cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments.
AARP encourages the Administration to work with Congress on bipartisan solutions that will lower health care costs &amp; increase coverage. https://t.co/wfJ7fQgqXR

We are ready to work w/ Congress on solutions to protect &amp; strengthen the health care coverage that millions of Americans need &amp; depend on
Older Americans need &amp; deserve affordable premiums, lower out of pocket costs, &amp; health coverage they can count on as they age.
‚ñ™Ô∏èCrack down on drug companies' high prices and work to lower the cost of prescription drugs
‚ñ™Ô∏èKeep Medicare strong &amp; oppose cuts to funding that could open the door to benefit cuts &amp; vouchers that could hurt seniors
‚ñ™Ô∏èProtect Americans w/pre-existing conditions from price gouging &amp; oppose ANY weakening of protections
‚ñ™Ô∏èStrengthen Medicaid to ensure access to services that people 50+ need to live independently in their homes
‚ñ™Ô∏èEnsure any legislation does not include an age tax for people 50+

Call your Senator: urge them to #VoteNo on the health care bill. 844-222-0110. [end of thread]
Millions will see their premiums skyrocket or lose insurance altogether, while special interests benefit.
Health care in this country can be improved, but this bill does not meet the basic test of lowering health care costs for most people.
This higher cost, less coverage bill is unacceptable, and AARP urges all Senators to #VoteNo.
Last, it would give $200 BILLION to big pharma &amp; insurance companies, while doing nothing to lower health and drug costs for real people.
To be clear, it wouldn‚Äôt actually *lower* Medicaid costs ‚Äì it would simply shift burden to states. Ultimately taxpayers would foot the bill.
It would also slash Medicaid funding by $772 BILLION, stripping away coverage from millions of seniors, children, disabled, and veterans.
The bill also lets states dramatically increase costs for people with conditions like cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, and asthma.
The CBO also found the bill weakens Medicare funding by tens of billions of dollars.
That's a mind-boggling $13,700 increase. That‚Äôs not just high. That‚Äôs unaffordable.		That‚Äôs enough to devastate a household.
What does that mean? A 64-year-old making $56,800/year would see their premium hike from $6,800 to $20,500/year.
The bill also imposes an "age tax" ‚Äì meaning people 50-64 years old could be charged 5x more than younger people for the same plan.
Nonpartisan CBO confirms: Senate bill would have a crushing impact on Americans, leaving 22 million more people uninsured by 2026. #CBOScore

As we did with all 435 House Reps, AARP will hold all Senators accountable for their votes. We strongly urge the Senate to reject this bill.
Our members care deeply about their health care and have told us repeatedly that they want to know where their elected officials stand.
The Senate bill also cuts funding for Medicare, leaving the door wide open to benefit cuts or Medicare vouchers.
The proposed Medicaid cuts would leave millions, including our most vulnerable seniors, at risk of losing the care they need.
AARP adamantly opposes the Age Tax, which would allow insurance companies to charge older Americans 5X more for coverage than everyone else.
This Senate bill was crafted in secrecy behind closed doors without a single hearing or open debate‚Äîand it shows. https://t.co/GS6i0Ajfjn

.@mmurraypolitics Representatives who supported the bad bill in the House should be held accountable. The Senate would be wise to start from scratch. [end]
.@mmurraypolitics Bottom line: Americans see this bill for what it is. They know it would raise costs, strip protections, &amp; cause millions to lose coverage.
.@mmurraypolitics Q: What do you think about allowing states to opt out of protecting pre-existing conditions?		Good idea: 20%	Bad idea: 74%
.@mmurraypolitics Unfortunately they're right: AHCA imposes a crushing age tax on 50-64 year-olds.
.@mmurraypolitics Q: Would your health care costs go up or down?		Up: 42%	Down: 13%		In other words: By a 3-to-1 margin they expect AHCA to raise their costs.
.@mmurraypolitics By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, 50-64 year-olds reject the AHCA. Of those who disapprove, more than 4 out of 5 disapprove *strongly* of the bill.

Bottom line: AHCA would allow insurance co.'s to price gouge people with pre-existing conditions, effectively making coverage unaffordable.
Older Americans would be especially at risk. 25 MILLION people age 50-64 have a pre-existing condition ‚Äì a full 40%. https://t.co/37CIAEwFuH
Sky-high premiums would price many people out of the market altogether, leaving too many Americans without the coverage they need.
AHCA would force many with pre-existing conditions into high-risk pools with SKYROCKETING premiums ‚Äì possibly as high as $25,700 per year.
The AHCA in its current form ‚Äì with MacArthur amendment ‚Äì does NOT adequately protect patients with pre-existing conditions.
FACT CHECK: high-risk pools don't protect people with preexisting conditions. We encourage Congress to fix the bill. https://t.co/cIMREldzWI https://t.co/rrqUV201Ls

High-risk pools need $178B per year to be adequately funded. AHCA only offers $100B...over 10 years. You do the math.

Congress should focus on legislation that puts Americans‚Äô health care first, not the special interests. https://t.co/JmftlBKdiz
Here's what the AHCA does do well: line the pockets of special interests like big insurance &amp; drug companies.
CBO projects: AHCA cuts $800 BILLION from Medicaid over 10 years. Many older Americans depend on Medicaid to live independently.
CBO projects: Under AHCA, coverage for a 64 year-old w/ income of $26,500 would cost $14,600/year ‚Äì a $12,900 increase from current law.
AHCA imposes an age tax on Americans age 50-64. The result? CBO projects a 20-25% premium hike for a 64-year old. Unacceptable. #NoAgeTax
CBO estimate reinforces why AARP strongly opposes the AHCA. The impact on older Americans would be devastating. Some of the worst features:
24 million would lose coverage; older Americans disproportionately impacted, says nonpartisan CBO. AARP reacts: https://t.co/cORBBWIOAz
