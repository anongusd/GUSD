If we truly have faith in those we serve — if we want our government to reflect the diversity + strength of our communities — then let’s help clear the way for new leaders to step up and bring their unique experiences + expertise to bear on the problems + opportunities before us.
Congress needs term limits. https://t.co/6OJJ4LJXtH

Just introduced a bipartisan bill to increase staffing + improve infrastructure at our ports of entry -- that will mean less congestion for travelers; more security at our borders; and more legitimate commerce and the jobs and growth that come w/it. More: https://t.co/U631osOvTc
Our ports of entry facilitate trade and travel that is connected to jobs in Texas and states all across this country. But severe staffing shortages and outdated infrastructure are creating long wait times for visitors and lost economic growth for our state (1/2)
At a time when 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives and 30,000 provider positions at the VA remain unfilled, the VA needs a leader focused on ensuring our veterans can access timely, quality care worthy of their service and sacrifice.

There are too many authorized but unfilled clinical positions at the VA. Every day we allow these roles to go unfilled is another day we fail to fully meet our commitment to our veterans. I’ve introduced a bill to help address this provider shortage.  https://t.co/DhvGfuqYJn
Sending the military to the U.S.-Mexico border is a grave mistake and a gross waste of taxpayer resources. My exchange with Secretary Mattis: https://t.co/MTt65AV65D
Today, Sec. Mattis told our Committee the administration hasn’t decided to launch missile strikes in Syria. Yesterday, the President tweeted “Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” Asked Sec. Mattis to explain: https://t.co/mPjWhH8WSV

Such an impressive group of students from @utsystem and @TAMU. Thanks for the great conversation and ideas about how to make graduate education more affordable and keep our campuses safe. https://t.co/WBT8W4wszN
Twenty veterans a day are taking their own lives. The bipartisan provisions we got signed into law will help ensure more of our veterans can access the mental health care they need and deserve. https://t.co/KfEDCblWJi

Women earning the median income in the U.S. will earn $400,000 less over their careers than men. Let's be a country that ensures women receive equal pay for equal work.
“If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” 		50 years after he was assassinated, MLK Jr.’s legacy and example still shine as brightly as ever. #MLK50
At our town hall meeting yesterday, I was proud to meet and recognize some of the outstanding organizations that serve El Paso through @AmeriCorps and @SeniorCorps. They represent the best traditions of El Paso and our state. So grateful to live in this community. https://t.co/29nrmFmfXr

At a time when 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives, VA Secretary Shulkin has been deeply committed to ensuring those who have borne the battle for this country can access the mental health care they deserve. I thank him for his dedicated service.
Our April town hall is right around the corner -- next Monday, April 2nd at 2pm. Hope you can come out and share your ideas/questions with me. https://t.co/r24GG560pN
I am grateful for the sacrifice of all those who serve and put their lives on the line for this country including transgender Americans. Our country and military are strengthened by their service.
With the president’s signature, our bill to help veterans with “other-than-honorable” discharges get mental health care is now law. Real progress in our efforts to ensure those who put their lives on the line for this country can access the care they deserve.
Hope to see you on April 2nd for our next town hall -- looking forward to hearing what's on your mind and taking your questions. https://t.co/PyEBoR1NJo
While I am disappointed in money appropriated for new fencing (33 miles) and replacement, this compromise is the best possible path forward at this time. (3/3)
At a time when twenty veterans a day are taking their lives, it also includes a provision I led to expand access to mental health services for veterans with "bad paper" discharges, who are often unable to access the care they need and deserve through the VA. (2/3)
Just voted yes on the omnibus. Far from perfect, but includes a lot of good things for Texas and the country: the biggest pay raise for service members in years, a $7 billion funding increase for veterans, significant funding increases for our schools, and more. (1/3)

(2/3) investment in our veterans, predictability for our service members, a meaningful response to the opioid crisis, funding for community health centers, and a real commitment to rebuilding the homes, businesses and infrastructure so badly damaged during Hurricane Harvey.
(1/3) This morning, we were able to work together to reach a budget agreement — imperfect as it is — that includes a lot of good things for Texas:

In every way that’s meaningful, Daisy is every bit as American as my three kids. We need to do right by Daisy and the 800,000 Dreamers in Texas and across the country who are contributing so much to our communities – making us stronger and safer and more successful every day.
Meet Daisy Arvizu, my guest to tomorrow’s State of the Union Address. Daisy was brought to this country at the tender age of one year and eight months. She grew up in our community; she works two jobs; and she’s a student at the El Paso Community College.
Heartbroken by recent flu-related deaths in El Paso. Public Health officials are encouraging people to get vaccinated and practice the “4 C’s” to help prevent the spread of flu: Clean, Cover, Contain, Call. More info here: https://t.co/RXUhRweWXm
That’s why I recently helped introduce new legislation – the Community Broadband Act – that will help ensure that more Texans are able to get online.
There are too many parts of Texas where people can’t get online to look for a job, take an online course, or read the news. Close to half of rural Texas communities lack access to high-speed internet - almost 2 million Texans.
What we need now is leadership — to fund the government for the rest of the year, to support our military, to fulfill our obligation to our veterans, to protect the Dreamers, and more. Fully within our power.
We cannot continue down the path of funding the most powerful government in the world one month at a time.

I voted against the House version because it would be devastating for Texas. But the Senate's would be even worse. Join me in making our voices heard today &amp; this week so we can stop it once and for all.
It will also cause inequality to grow and hurt the very people we so desperately need to be helping. It's simply a terrible piece of legislation. 	https://t.co/OzzHnDgL3i
On top of that, the bill would cause premiums in our state to spike by an average of $1,730.
🚨 Red alert! The Senate tax bill would cause 1,036,000 more people to be uninsured in Texas -- a state that already has the highest uninsured rate in the country.

More than 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives after bravely putting them on the line. Their deaths are an epidemic that we can  stop. We must. Today's news is a step forward.
We know that too many of our service members don’t seek voluntary evals because of the stigma surrounding mental health. This amd. makes evals routine &amp; starts an open discussion about PTSD.
Personnel separating from active duty are required to have a physical exam before transitioning. But there is currently no requirement that they be examined by a mental health professional.

Low VA utilization due to issues of access among others. Can VA improve operations and increase funding enough to meet true demand?

For the full report, click here: https://t.co/wflqLPhET1
- 82% of EP veterans said they do not care whether their healthcare is delivered at the VA or within the community, as long as it is timely.
And in an indication of how we might begin to address the issues of demand and access,
- 34% of veterans are not able to get a mental healthcare appointment at all
- 77 days, on average, to see a primary or specialty care provider	- 64 days to see a mental health provider
While we saw small improvements in some areas of service, the overall picture of healthcare access in EP remains disappointing&amp;unacceptable:
We have just completed our second annual survey of El Paso veterans to determine the true state of VA healthcare in the region.
