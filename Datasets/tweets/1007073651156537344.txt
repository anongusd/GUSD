@Jim_Jordan Russia interfering in elections and changing the course of American history is the EMERGENCY
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump For their first meeting American taxpayers paid for the production of a N. Korea propaganda film. Kim is not on a reality show. You're out of your depth and the quintessential example of the Peter Principle.
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems We have a right as American citizens to hear everything. Just like you do.
@Jim_Jordan Wishful thinking does not create reality. Numbers don't lie but Congressmen apparently do.
@HouseGOP @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @USATODAY The only good thing about this mess is that we can clearly see who is willing to sell out our country.
@RepMarkMeadows The GOP is making it very clear that they don't care about TREASON as long as the traitor is a Republican
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The state of Texas came out and said that was fake news. Anytime you use numbers they have to be fake since you don't read

@PressSec Property taxes are due in January. These idiots are oblivious to the real world.
@realDonaldTrump This will be the costliest administration in history. Lawsuits will continue for several years after this bum hit's the road.
@realDonaldTrump Donald's projection is absolutely hilarious! Third rate conman is a perfect description.
For those of us living in the real world, January is the month that property taxes are due. Any damage to FICO scores are also real world consequences faced by those impacted by Trump's Shutdown.

@brianklaas When a 100% qualified woman, whom all the generals supported, "loses" to a completely unqualified and incompetent TV personality, followed by Anita Hill 2.0, nothing has changed for women in 30 YEARS. The whole world got to see what women experience in the work place every day.
@WhiteHouse @Cabinet Fake President, Russian Traitor. Execution is warranted for everyone who knowingly worked with Russia. WWII started with hatred and a scociopath...don't think history can't repeat itself.
@realDonaldTrump Anytime this idiot quotes numbers you know he's lying. He doesn't even read is daily briefings. Complete incompetence.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You're the human debris. Your stats about illegals in prison are ridiculous.
@nottoogullible @IngrahamAngle They are not being used. They are fleeing violence. My own grandmother survived the Armenian Genocide. The GOP should just confess that they don't give a crap about anyone. They only pretend to care about are the ones not born.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The nations don't disrespect American sovereignty. Countries cannot arrest people for walking.
@IngrahamAngle How about describing them as women and children fleeing a violence ridden country because if they don't leave their sons and daughters are in danger. What would cause a Mother to travel thousands of miles for safety?
@HouseGOP Paychecks are up temporarily. The individual tax cuts expire after the election and it was planned that way by the GOP. By the time you file for 2018 and see how little you're gaining the election will be over.

@SenWhitehouse @FBI Either way the truth will come out and then what?
@ACLU As well as the propaganda film Trump produced for the N. Korean regime. Seriously.
@senorrinhatch A persons character is well established by 17. A basic requirement of the job is a LIFETIME OF RESPECT TOWARDS WOMEN. That is not too much to expect. A judge cannot OBJECTIFY ANYONE EVER.
