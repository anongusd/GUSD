#TBT to the Jet Age when the @usairforce was developing metals for aircraft that were lighter and more resistant to higher temperatures. Magnesium had been used for components, but by the 1950s the metal was being used to skin entire aircraft, like this F-80. #AFRLHistory #avgeek https://t.co/f1kzTP03lL
