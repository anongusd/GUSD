@EdKrassen I've been crying off and on since this hearing started.  I was brutally raped at the age of 15.
@AprilDRyan Absolutely! I'm a rape survivor and one thing we all know is another survivor.  I got brutally raped at age 15 just like Dr. Ford. I can't stop crying while watching this BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS WOMAN OF GOD.
@DanaBashCNN I started crying within the first 30 seconds in hearing Dr. Ford's voice. I was brutally raped at 15yr old and I'm horrified of flying but I do fly to see relatives and go on vacations. Dr. Ford's fear of flying has nothing to do w this case.
