@RepSmucker So nothing coming up and nothing open to the general public then?
@realDonaldTrump @Cabinet @SenateCommerce We do, its unfortunate corporations just got a huge tax break that could have helped pay for the roads. While our national debt will only go higher.  SAD.
@realDonaldTrump Like those you put in place making us less competitive in the global market
@jonfavs Don't forget he is also cute according to fox news
@shortstuffckwk @RepSmucker Its Fulton bank not the Fulton, I understand your confusion though
@RepSmucker @nytimes Key words you seem to be missing there is Looking Awfully Strong, however with the attempts to remove the regulations that would prevent another crisis like 08 I am sure you will bring it crashing down again in no time.
@RepSmucker You mean the making sure workers have less safe environments to work in, our environment in general gets destroyed and America becomes an unlivable wasteland? While also scamming the middle class by borrowing against the future leading to much higher taxes as our debt soars.
@npratc @NPR @Deggans I haven't watched the new season but I hope it starts out a bit better, than the last one. Her show is my third favorite Netflix marvel show with number one being Luke Cage and number two being Iron fist which I feel was unfairly judged.
@fullnby Oh I know that most libraries cover those types of programs, I was questioning if some libraries should ditch physical books and switch to an all digital format having only those types of services. I find those services to be great additions to existing libraries.
@RepBarragan To be honest I feel Libraries as a whole should be evaluated and in some cases and maybe replaced with media centers, where programs that were previously done at libraries can be done on computers or tablets. Not saying they shouldn't exist just that maybe they need updates?
@ToddRokita @realDonaldTrump I am a liberal and to an extent I agree with you, if someone commits a crime they should be reported if they are here illegally to ICE. However at the same time you shouldn't be forced to produce proof of citizenship if you are reporting crime.
@RepSmucker @LancasterOnline Too bad you don't have any
@RepSmucker Just Ban Assault Rifles already like every other First world Country
@RepTomSuozzi Washington raised taxes on whiskey and he himself rode out to make sure the tax was enforced when a rebellion ensued, I am sure he would be abhorred to the way Republicans twist the tax code to give exceptions to the rich.

@IvankaTrump @POTUS Unless that involves better funding for schools too I don't want it.
@NormaJTorres Who knew they sold guns?
@realDonaldTrump Just wanna say I like what you are trying to get done about gun control, I disagree with arming teachers though. I normally disagree with you but when you do good it needs to be recognized just as much as when you do bad.

@cathymcmorris So vote out the republicans this year everyone get to the polls!
@RepSmucker On this day in 2018 you have been in office for 405 days without ever holding a town hall meeting to hear from your constituents. No wonder Trump likes you, he doesn't listen to the American People either
@JeremyR06910620 @jaguarphoto @skipthesubway25 @DevinNunes The memo, which even republicans felt was incomplete so they voted to release a subsequent one which was only blocked by Trump. Seems like its incomplete
@JeremyR06910620 @jaguarphoto @skipthesubway25 @DevinNunes Can you point to an article from a reputable news source saying that?
@jaguarphoto @JeremyR06910620 @skipthesubway25 @DevinNunes We lost the election, but not our sanity. Trump isn't good for America, especially if it turns out he colluded with Russia to get elected. If Hillary was accused of collusion by the FBI, then I would want an investigation. The question is why doesn't he?
@RandPaul @justinamash Sorry Rand but Republicans only care about their own salaries while they are in office, and not the American People.

@pdacosta That's the level of shade that needs to be thrown by the media.
@RepSmucker Seriously though why is there this discrepancy are the other states affected kicking money in as well to a shared fund, did some new info come out that lowered the cost did you just spitball a number that sounded good?
@RepSmucker End Tank Graveyards
@realDonaldTrump You mean #nojobs
@SenToomey You mean the fiscal responsibility, that you threw to the wind by passing unneeded corporate tax cuts, without raising the minimum wage. As well as widespread pork barrel military spending on tank graveyards filled with tanks that will never be driven due to extreme surplus.
@RepSmucker @RepEsty @soledadobrien @matteroffacttv Can't do that without raising taxes or the debt ceiling, where's the fiscal responsibility now?
@RepSmucker @realDonaldTrump How about introducing a measure that would allow the American people to recall a president or removing the electoral college.
@RepSmucker Less than half of the $40 Million your office said we needed.
Our Government should never shutdown and no American should ever be placed at risk of being deported because our president, doesn't have a heart.
@RepSmucker Yeah its good for the middle class now but it will be gone in only a few short years when they skyrocket up because America can't pay its debt #NationalDebt #FiscalResponsibility #TaxScam
@SpeakerRyan @RepSmucker Great you delivered legislation long overdue now start work on the executive and judicial branch versions
@RepStevenSmith @TheAlanBerry @RepMattGaetz You mean the credible investigation that has more evidence everyday?
@SenatorRounds We have enough useless tanks sitting in the desert that will never be used. Scrap them and you will have enough money to do whatever it is you want.
@realDonaldTrump Oh look a myth, I do believe we need a merit based program, I just don't believe you have the merits to write one.
@davidcicilline Why is he still in office
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Well the Border is as secure as it is going to get, Chain Migration is a myth, the visa lottery is for people well qualified to work in this country... so the only thing that needs reform is your news sources and DACA
@RepMattGaetz If only that money was spent on something we needed like healthcare.
@PatrickMcHenry And how much money is now instead of paying for repairing our nations outdated infrastructure is now paying for some already rich person's third yacht. #TaxScamBill
@WarrenDavidson You are right we should be maximizing our services for the American people with fiscal responsibility by stopping the waste of money on tank graveyards. And by preventing banks and other companies from getting too big to fail through heavy regulation.
@HouseGOP You are playing politics in the way you fund our troops tossing money in the trash creating massive tank graveyards. Not every American needs a tank
@jasoninthehouse The Dems weighed the danger of your biased memo to the American people. They tried to vote against it to prevent the damage to us, upon failure to stop it they decided to put out their own memo that corrected some of the omissions to balance out the damage with repairs. So Dems

@RepSmucker I didn't get the invite to the townhall, otherwise I would have told you I don't own a large corporation, nor does anyone else I am friends with. Only tax reform their really is, is bringing back regulations which allow small business to compete as well as raising min wage.
@FoxNews @RepDarrenSoto Desperately needed military funding for what tank graveyards? Congress wastes our money on stuff that does nothing to protect us, or our nations troops when it comes to military spending. The wasted money could fund another countries military and pay for universal healthcare.
