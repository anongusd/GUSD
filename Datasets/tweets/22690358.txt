@JakeElman According to their website, 2002. I will say this: I know a lot of pregnant women who when they hit their third trimester had massive foot swelling and couldn't wear anything except Crocs. So Crocs really has a niche market there of pregnant women/Mario Batali.
@JakeElman The traditional Croc, heck yes. So awkward. But they've released some cute designs over the past few years that are more modern. I took a swing with the sandals and it was a big miss. üôÑ
@thememanxx Locals are concerned about the increase in traffic along Southern that will come of this. It's going to put a lot more cars on the road in that area. On the other hand, there's a need for apartments in the area. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@KVJShow I would call 911 if I saw that too.
@KVJShow Lol! Was it Jason who was on it? This was back in like 2007-2008 that I called in, I think.
OK one last one: My mom loves @luigisice. Sometimes she would try to pretend she wasn‚Äôt sleepwalking and come out to get an icee. But the giveaway would be that she would ask for a Luigi‚Äôs ice with a crappy Australian accent.
@DoreyScheimer Yes! Lol and you were the nazi, Dorey. You were the man. üòÇ I guess to my mom, I was the sandwich nazi.
P.S. I once called into a radio show ‚Äî I think it was @KVJShow ‚Äî to talk about this and they didn‚Äôt believe me that she made us chase her. She did. It‚Äôs actually on video somewhere. We kept the tapes. üôå
@DoreyScheimer She once started trying to sort some of her cookbooks by tastiest cakes. She gave up pretty quickly bc the Ambien would make her arms weak and she didn‚Äôt want to lift the heavier books anymore. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Once she realized she might accidentally hurt herself while sleepwalking, she hopped off those pills so fast. PSA: Unless you‚Äôve been through every other med to treat something, side effects aren‚Äôt normal and your doctor needs to know so you can find something else to take.
She wouldn‚Äôt believe us when we told her what she was doing, so we had to start filming her. She was mortified and got off the Ambien ASAP. She had gained 10 pounds in the meantime. Her behavior was amusing and benign but also potentially dangerous.
Her response was, ‚ÄúBut what if the pastor wants one?‚Äù Idk, I guess he can buy his own? https://t.co/da6hRYob2B
On another occasion, my dad accidentally bought hot and spicy dill pickles and my mom tried to tear into them late one night. We tried to convince her not to eat one ‚Äî they were too spicy for her during the day; Ambien wouldn‚Äôt change that
@AndrewRuizWPTV Indeed it is! Thank you so much. üòÅ
@wilkinebrutus Thanks! These pregnancy symptoms are crazytown. lol Good to know I‚Äôm in good company! üòä
The autiobiography of our dog was my favorite though. It started pretty strong with how Gracie came to our family but ended with the line, ‚ÄúThe cook with the brush‚Äù and two pages of scribbles.
She also told us while not on Ambien not to let her sleep-eat anymore. That night after taking her pill she got up to nab a snack and she made my sister, our friend and me chase her in circles through the house giggling like a little kid.
She once made butter and cheese sandwiches on hamburger buns. She sat in her room watching Dudley Do-Right and called them Dudley Do-Right sandwiches as she ate six of them.
My mom has done some weird stuff on Ambien. She once helped our dog start writing her autobiography. But the things she did never were offensive. Rather, she became an almost-infantile version of her usual self. (Thread with examples of behavior) https://t.co/nLwsNVqprK

Now, back to the news.
That's it. I hope you've enjoyed this look at a very #Florida problem to have. Also, if you live in Rio, I hope you don't feed the peacocks because if you do, your neighbors probably are *very* mad at you.
And, finally, my favorite comment: "Haven‚Äôt tried it yet, but they would be good with black beans and rice! Get rid of these nuisance parasites. ... Don‚Äôt know if you ever experienced bird screaming in your window at 3:00 a.m., but it sucks." https://t.co/PKVfkTR01t
These two people seem to not be OK with the word "poop." https://t.co/XPhVXL9sUP
This grandma confessed to going #Florida on a rogue peacock, chasing it with a broom "3 or 4 times." https://t.co/8R7Enh0qfn
These two folks are *not* fans. One says the peacocks are "a pain in the .... Thanks." Never heard that saying before but I know where he was going with it. https://t.co/sgYg3hOG3o
This poor guy basically ran a peacock toilet: "Peacocks come to my house daily and poop." https://t.co/jgaGvogEcY
"They damage my vehicle (actually, one [peacock] in particular). Any type of reflection from cars he attacks." https://t.co/LNjvhwK0C8
But not everyone was a fan of the peacocks. If they were, I wouldn't be doing this.
A lot of the written comments said, essentially, "Live and let live." Many evoked the name of Frances Langford, the starlet who first introduced the birds to Jensen Beach. https://t.co/iL2kgNOHcm
Most people said the peacocks weren't annoying. https://t.co/8B3PaEFykp
We'll start with the survey itself, which asks residents about everything from how often they see peacocks to how annoying the peacocks are. https://t.co/aHWTWy3ydb
Well guess what? I found it: https://t.co/eCnttf8hp5 -- and now I'm going to share the best responses here because they are hilarious and real and honest and so very #Florida.
The responses were choice, to say the least. But a few years ago, the link to the survey results broke. Every once in awhile when I'm really not feeling well - right now, thanks all-day morning sickness - I take a quick spin through the internet to try to find it again.
Some residents in Jensen Beach's Rio neighborhood were frustrated by the beautiful but destructive peacocks that live in the area. The Rio Civic Club sent the survey to residents to see if a Peafowl Management Plan was needed.
When I worked at @tcpalm, one of my favorite things I covered was the Rio Peacock Survey in 2014. Yes, a peacock survey. Allow me to explain.

At one point in the meeting, board members said it could come down to paying $93,000 a creditor or paying teachers. One board member admitted if it gets to that point, it would be the end of the school.
