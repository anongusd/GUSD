#Russia is a foe,not a competitor--AG #Rosenstein's announcement today of #Mueller's latest #indictments against #TwelveRussians who meddled in our #democracy further proves this point. I joined @CNN's @AnaCabrera today to discuss the indictments&amp;the ongoing #MuellerInvestigation https://t.co/hDWpBvqUqz
Indictment means more likely guilty than not I.e probable cause. Trumpers are now Russiaphiles &amp; standing up for the GRU(Putin’s intelligence force)in contrast to #Mueller and grand jury.#TRUMP friends are few.He doesn’t keep our allies close but he stays close to  Comrade Putin. https://t.co/D6RiSzKKYX
