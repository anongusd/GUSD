Our shared values and commitment to each other is and always has been this institution’s greatest strength.  Let us never allow polarization, politics, and short-term political expediency undermine our obligation to make a difference in the lives of those who sent us here.
From my first day in Congress to my last, every constituent or stakeholder who stopped me on the street or walked into the office to tell me about their issues and priorities was my boss.  It has been the honor of a lifetime to work for you.
Today, I gave what will likely be my last address to the House as your Representatives for New Mexico’s First Congressional District. Thank you all for entrusting me to represent you in Washington, holding me accountable, and giving me direction. https://t.co/sJoi4tVNT0
Further, it will provide certainty to farmers and ranchers and demonstrate Congress's commitment to supporting rural communities throughout the country.  I urge my colleagues to support and quickly pass this #FarmBill. 6/
This bill also protects #SNAP &amp; contains no cuts to the program which will ensure that no NM families lose their benefits. Considering that NM is one of the hungriest states in the nation, this legislation will keep countless New Mexicans from falling into poverty. 5/
Expanding broadband access will grow New Mexico's economy, create jobs, boost wages, improve health outcomes, support small business growth, help our students learn, increase crop yields, and so much more. 4/
This broadband program, modeled after legislation I introduced, will help transform the economies of rural areas in New Mexico.  High-speed internet has revolutionized every aspect of the U.S. economy, including education, health care, and agriculture. 3/
It was an honor to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect SNAP, support New Mexico Land Grants &amp; Acequias, strengthen conservation &amp; water management programs, promote Tribal sovereignty &amp; establish the first ever broadband grant program in a Farm Bill. 2/
I am proud to support this #FarmBill that advances the interests of New Mexican families, farmers, and ranchers for years to come. 1/	https://t.co/wn0hmmDy40

In order to fully protect Chaco, the BLM must suspend all lease sales including the active March leases until BLM completes a comprehensive cultural resource study in coordination with impacted tribes.
The 10 mile zone around Chaco Canyon should be permanently protected from oil and gas development to safeguard both the archeological sites of ancient civilizations in the area and present-day communities. But we cannot stop there.

We must send a clear message to empower sexual assault survivors to tell their stories. This is a pivotal moment in American history and we must rise to the occasion.
Dr. Blasey Ford and the other women who have shared similar experiences of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh deserve to be heard and respected, as all sexual assault survivors deserve to be heard and respected. Their allegations must be investigated.
I am inspired by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s courage to come forward and provide her powerful testimony at great personal cost and amid Republican attempts to rush through Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.
If the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh proceeds, it will undoubtedly result in a court we can’t trust.
President Trump’s refusal to call for a thorough, independent FBI investigation into the multiple credible allegations of sexual assault by Judge Kavanaugh has severely damaged the integrity of the judicial nomination process.
Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court must be withdrawn immediately.

Congress and the President have a responsibility to allow the American people to learn the truth about whether Judge Kavanaugh misled Congress while under oath and the truth about his character.
To hold a vote this week is an insult to sexual assault survivors, sending a disastrous message that they don’t matter and will not be believed.
The women coming forward with allegations of sexual assault and misconduct must be heard &amp; respected, their allegations must be investigated by the FBI, and this nomination should be brought to a halt until that happens.
These newest allegations against Kavanaugh are beyond disturbing and must be investigated immediately.  https://t.co/zDuptJqRLj

Today, USPS closed the customer service area of this facility due to water leaks which impact employee safety, employee productivity, and quality mail service for Albuquerque residents.
I am requesting USPS officials explain why the conditions at this location are not being improved, and why they're interfering with my constitutional obligation to investigate issues that inform my work as a Member of Congress.
This undermines my ability to respond to the concerns I have heard from members of the community and from USPS employees about systemic understaffing and underfunding issues at USPS facilities throughout ABQ.
It is unacceptable that USPS prohibited me from inspecting this facility, talking to impacted employees, &amp; evaluating the working conditions in the building. https://t.co/bUGvDOptHn

This #HispanicHeritageMonth, we must celebrate our accomplishments and continue to seek out and challenge divisive rhetoric, beat back intolerance, and uplift the contributions, culture, deep roots and legacy of the Hispanic community in New Mexico and the United States.
These achievements by Hispanic Americans, and countless others are but a glimpse of what comes when our nation promotes inclusion and welcomes individuals from all walks of life.
From civil rights icons like Dolores Huerta who fought to improve conditions for laborers to Astronaut José Hernandez who traveled into space to advance science &amp; innovation, these are some of the Hispanic innovators &amp; leaders whose accomplishments have moved our country forward.
These efforts have marginalized immigrants &amp; undermined the contributions of Hispanic families, &amp; are inconsistent with the values on which #HispanicHeritageMonth  was founded. The reality is that Hispanics have broken down barriers &amp; fought to improve the lives of all Americans.
But instead of celebrating inclusion, our country has seen a rise in hateful anti-immigrant rhetoric perpetrated by this administration’s systematic attacks on, and targeting of, our community.
Hispanic Heritage Month not only recognizes these contributions but also reminds us that America has been strengthened and enriched by our diversity.
From serving at the highest levels of gov &amp; Fortune 500 companies to starting small businesses, building our nation’s roads &amp; bridges, &amp; teaching, our community’s determination &amp; resiliency has helped lead the US, spark innovation, &amp; create a better life for all Americans.

These revelations underscore the critical importance of a full and thorough review of Judge Kavanaugh’s body of work. New Mexicans deserve to know the truth about Judge Kavanaugh and how his life-time appointment to the Supreme Court will affect their daily lives.
His critical description of affirmative action regulations as a “naked racial set-aside” shows his ideological prejudice to programs that promote equity in education, healthcare, housing, &amp; banking, &amp; helped millions of minority &amp; Native-American families &amp; businesses thrive.
The Judge’s comments questioning the precedent establishing a right to privacy in Roe v. Wade validates women and girls’ fears that their essential freedoms will be eroded and their right to make their own health choices will be infringed upon.
These disturbing revelations confirm the nightmare of many Americans who believe Judge Kavanaugh will erode women’s rights and challenge programs that promote equity.	https://t.co/f3JeXB0a2Z

I urge my colleagues to come together to pass a bipartisan #FarmBill that is desperately needed by farmers, ranchers, and vulnerable Americans in every single one of our districts.
These are extremely complex issues that are sometimes a matter of life and death for producers and vulnerable New Mexicans. Which is why it is so important that we support #SNAP, SNAP-Ed, FINI, TEFAP, and other programs to ensure that everyone has access to nutrition.
Roughly 461,000 New Mexicans are on SNAP including thousands of veterans, children, and working families. Last year, #SNAP helped keep 76,000 New Mexicans, including 36,000 children, out of poverty.
This past month, I had the opportunity to meet with farmers and ranchers across New Mexico who rely on #FarmBill programs to support their hard work, and with children and families enrolled in #SNAP working hard to get ahead.

I am proud to stand with New Mexican families to fight for quality, affordable coverage, and to ensure that all have access to the health care that they need.

Playing politics with people’s lives neglects Congress’s responsibility to take bi-partisan action to reduce prescription drug prices, hold insurance companies accountable, and increase access.
They have repeatedly attempted to eliminate life-saving consumer protections and destabilize the health care market which increases costs and has made health care even more unaffordable for millions of families.

On 7/25, the DHS Sec guaranteed CHC Members that families would be reunified by the first court-ordered deadline, yet weeks later disturbing reports have surfaced of a child dying after being held in a detention center and other children still languish in inexcusable conditions.
This administration’s continued failure to reunify the hundreds of children and parents they separated is devastating to the families, harmful to the wellbeing of children, and shows an utter and complete disregard for the court ordered deadline imposed weeks ago.
Kavanaugh’s reactionary judicial record threatens decades of progress for a woman’s right to make their own health decisions, LGBTQ rights, civil rights &amp; Americans’ access to healthcare. I urge the Senate to protect our constitution by defeating Kavanaugh’s SCOTUS nomination.
This morning’s release of over 42,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh’s documents hours before the Senate’s confirmation hearing makes a thorough review of all documents impossible and diminishes the Senate’s ability to thoroughly question the nominee. This is unacceptable.
The nation deserves a transparent, thorough, and open nomination process. But there is an unprecedented lack of transparency surrounding the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court of the United States. 	https://t.co/xnKCEv7b8b

Our community - families, law enforcement, social service agencies - must come together to do everything possible to prevent these horrific and unnecessary tragedies. The consequences of not doing so is a matter of life and death.
In the case of Rio Rancho, the organizations obligated to protect children must be more vigilant and do a better job of preventing abuse, neglect, and deaths.
Ultimately judges have a sacred responsibility to safeguard public safety, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure that the community is not subject to further risk.
In the case of Taos County, I share concerns w/ members of the community that those important protections may have been misapplied. We have an obligation to re-examine NM’s pre-trial detention policies, which empower judges to detain a defendant due to the severity of the crime.
Every decision throughout the judicial and bail process needs to be made with the best interest of children and the safety of the community in mind.
The recent disturbing reports of violent child abuse in Taos County &amp; Rio Rancho are abhorrent and must be thoroughly investigated. Those responsible must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and brought to justice.

Before spending millions on a costly reorganization that tribes have never asked for, the Trump Admin should focus on fully funding education, public safety, &amp; natural resources programs that support self-determination &amp; have a significant impact on tribal communities across NM.

Overall, I am proud that this bipartisan bill strengthens the missions of these institutions, ensures that federal investments are leveraged to create jobs and grow our economy, and provides a pay increase for our troops and represents our commitment to their sacrifice and duty.
Unfortunately, this bill did not include one of my amendments that would have addressed inequality among our service members by making maternity leave available to women in the National Guard and Reserves. It is unacceptable that this blatant inequality was not corrected.
I am pleased that this bill includes my amendment that helps start-ups and small businesses in NM and across the country develop partnerships with #DoD to take innovative technologies to market.

Our national monuments are natural museums of our state’s cultural heritage that pump millions of dollars into our local and state economy.
Our national monuments here in New Mexico, including the Rio Grande del Norte and the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks, contain sacred tribal areas and provide outstanding opportunities for hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, and tourism.
Nationwide, these precious #publiclands help fuel an $887 billion outdoor recreation industry, which sustains millions of jobs and billions of dollars in federal, state, and local tax revenue.
I am proud to introduce the #ANTIQUITIESActOf2018 in the House to protect our treasured national monuments and #publiclands. This is the companion bill to @SenatorTomUdall’s legislation and cements our support for our public lands. https://t.co/K4LWfdDgFi

As if enacting policy that pries children from their mothers &amp;fathers was not abhorrent enough, the administration’s latest policy change means that girls &amp; women fleeing horrors of gender-based violence &amp;children fleeing gang violence will be deported back to danger, even death.
It is shameful that the most powerful nation on earth has chosen to turn its back on these desperate victims. This cruel policy change betrays our values, chips away at our shared humanity &amp; is a direct assault on girls, boys, mothers, &amp; fathers lawfully seeking asylum.

That is why #Congress must act without delay to pass the bipartisan #EqualityAct to provide clear and consistent non-discrimination protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
When a business decides to open its door to the public, that business must be open to every person, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Although the decision does not give businesses the ability to discriminate universally, it does not uphold the rights &amp; fundamental pillars of human dignity enshrined in the #CivilRightsAct more than 50 years ago. https://t.co/ve2bsfdyIN
Today’s @USSumpremeCourt decision reminds us not only how far we have come to protect longstanding civil rights laws, but also how far we have to go to ensure that Charlie Craig, David Mullins &amp; all #LGBTQ people are free from discrimination b/c of who they are or whom they love.

Pushing a partisan #FarmBill with those changes along with massive cuts to #SNAP will continue to sabotage any chance that Congress passes a bill that invests in farmers, promotes conservation, and ensures that low-income families have the support they need to make ends meet.

Today I spoke at the @ABQChamber Congressional Luncheon to discuss my work in #Congress and how we can collaborate to create jobs, grow wages, and support working families in #NewMexico. https://t.co/R3cff5rwCI
Teachers need to be respected, valued &amp; fairly compensated. We need to understand the challenges our children come to school w/ including the devastating impacts of poverty. We must support our children &amp; their families at home &amp; in school so they can be successful. @ABQChamber
I am a fierce advocate of the #labs because #NM has 2 out of the 17 @Energy national labs in the country. We are leading the nation in research &amp; #innovation. This state sits in the center of almost every new technology &amp; innovation not just in the U.S. but the world. @ABQChamber
There are so many things about #NM that create opportunities rather than liabilities. It's critical to have a laser focus on improving the economy &amp; generating job growth. We need stability in this state &amp; we need to move toward more bipartisan efforts in #Congress. @ABQChamber
It's great to be with the @ABQChamber this afternoon to discuss various topics that impact New Mexicans. https://t.co/Ol2mTbrTa4

Finally, it should not be up to the government to decide what people eat. Instead, we should increase funding for #SNAP Education to empower those in need to make healthy food choices.

New Mexicans deserve a #taxpackage that prioritizes middle-class families and #smallbusinesses; lifts families out of poverty; increases targeted investments in education and innovation; incentivizes businesses to grow wages and create jobs.
I firmly believe that NM desperately needs bi-partisan #taxreform to boost our sluggish economy. We have the third highest unemployment rate in the nation, half of our population is on #Medicaid, and 1 in 4 New Mexico children do not know where their next meal is coming from.
It further erodes the financial security of countless New Mexico middle-class families by increasing their taxes and health care premiums, in order to help massive corporations pad their profits and reward their wealthy investors.
The bill’s $2 trillion price tag would trigger devastating automatic cuts that will be used by Republicans to justify ransacking Medicare, Medicaid, work training services, or agricultural programs that the #NewMexico economy depends on.
The GOP #TaxBill is the most destructive and immoral piece of legislation I have voted against since serving in Congress.  https://t.co/tZ0cfxobVi

Nearly 1.3 million people receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders under the Medicaid expansion. #ACHA
Kicking people off the Medicaid rolls will mean that fewer people have coverage to access any treatment services that remain. #ACHA
Cutting funds from the Medicaid program and removing benefit requirements will mean that even fewer people have access to treatment. #ACHA
That’s what happens when you cut behavioral health and substance abuse services, people die. #ACHA
Many New Mexicans died because they didn’t have access to the treatment they needed. #ACHA
I just entered into the record a collection of obituaries describing victims of opioid addiction in New Mexico. #ACHA
