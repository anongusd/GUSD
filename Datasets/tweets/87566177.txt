@IndyPiggy Fear can be a healthy thing.  It has boldened me speak up and demand change in ways I never thought I would!
@WeThePeople5 I know.  God, Constitution, Freedom, and America are very politically incorrect these days.  Call me politically incorrect!
Just discovered liberal bloggers are following us.  (I'm slow).  Am removing questionables from my list.  http://tinyurl.com/yje99vy
@IndyPiggy They'll send those kids to reeducation camps.  Oops, is that Communism?  That can't be happen to us, right?
@IndyPiggy Think how dangerous this is: if good Americans are jailed for no insurance, then they can't vote!  This is voter disempowerment!
@WeThePeople5 These godless liberals need to go to church some time.  Then they'll know Who the real deal is.
@IndyPiggy Thanks Indy, Pelosi had the nerve to do that from my state!  Jailing people for no insur - monstrous!  http://bit.ly/3tRqXe
@conservatweet http://bit.ly/2F3J6d This admin is a blessing for terrorists.  At least we're making someone happy.
@WeThePeople5 Oh I know!  It's b/c we're not equal in HIS eyes.  Oh, holy Obama.  What have we done wrong?
@JonKeel Thanks Jon.  We'll have to trust that this admin doesn't have enough H1H1 vaccines b/c they are merely incompetent
@HULAgate True!  And he's saved the environment by hiring John Holdren, who wants to save the environ by forced abortion
@IndyPiggy What was Pelosi's explanation for jailing people w/o insurance?  I missed it!
@WeThePeople5 Indeed, why would Obama describe lawful, peaceful Americans as extremists?  Hmmmnnn...
@FloridaJayhawk 2012 end of an error - and end of terror.  I might finally be able to sleep at night.  :)
@IndyPiggy I know.  If Obama to answer all the questions he really needs to answer, he'd have to go in front of a Congressional hearing
@IndyPiggy So true!  Michelle probably gives him nightmares.  What with her fist bumps and being ashamed of US and dressing like a cow!
@HULAgate His Muslimness did have a plan for Afghan.  It involved apologizing to the world about US and bashing us.  He hasn't been wavering
@HULAgate 2010 is going to make 1775 look like a stellar year for the incumbents.  ROFL!
@IndyPiggy Maybe we should offer questions to Maj Garret:  "Pres Obama, what is your definition of terrorism?"
@WeThePeople5 Let's pray the WH doesn't infect Major with another H1N1 to get him knocked out. He's already suffered enough.  :)
@glennbeck.  #912  "Can we call people what they really are?  Terrorist, criminal, whore."  That just about sums up this administration
@WeThePeople5 Drudgereport: Obama Grants FOXNEWS Interview to Major Garrett in China - oooh, Obama might have to answer questions

@IndyPiggy I'm ROFL too.  Who do you think Michelle's fashion advisor is?
@WeThePeople5 http://tinyurl.com/y9s4lvm #912 Obama must be so much smarter than his nat security advisors.  That's why he's ignoring them
@HULAgate You gotta remember that Bamster got the right priorities.  He makes FAST judgment about hero cops "who act stupidly".
@HULAgate Thanks Hula!  Should we be hopeful that Rep are finally outperforming Dems in polls about 2010?
@Daggetdbeaver Gotta love Michelle's classy style.  Very garage sale furniture style.  http://pic.gd/7fce04
@HULAgate Remember, it takes true courage for our president to call Kanye West a jackass.  Afghan troop decision is nothing compared to that
@michaeldcarney This "let's feel more sad for Muslim terrorists than murdered Americans" - this goes beyond PC.  What is this?
@TNJim I was so shocked at Obama giving "shout-out" before addressing Ft Hood victim's families.  This is beyond liberal - it's thuggery
@mycoalition http://tinyurl.com/yly2zct #912 Obama shoulda done a lot of things Bush had the courage and integrity to do.  We're screwed
@TNJim We expected all presidents to have the integrity and courage that Bush had.  And all first ladies to have Laura's class.  So wrong
