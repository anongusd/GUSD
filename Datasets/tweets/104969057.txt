4/4 When it comes to abuse by people in positions of power, the correct response is clear. The accusers must be heard and the accused given the opportunity to clear their names. If the accusations prove credible, the abuser‚Äôs access to power should be removed.
3/4  I deeply regret my careless remarks and apologise unreservedly for any distress I caused.
2/4 My intention was to encourage the LGBT audience I was addressing, to be proud and open about their sexuality. In doing so, my point was clumsily expressed. I would never, ever trivialise or condone abuse of any kind.
1/4 As part of an extended podcast recently, I suggested that if closeted people were instead open about their sexuality they wouldn‚Äôt abuse others. That, of course, is wrong. https://t.co/9k6KLH2hx9

.@pdsufferer Saraman but watch out Vi!
.@BeKaterInTheSky I wouldnt be seen dead in Freddie‚Äôs outfits but I still wear Magneto‚Äôs Ralph Lauren overcoat from the first X --Men.
.@donzoui I think Freddie is a one off
@AndyDandyMandy Unbelievably yes. I‚Äôve enjoyed getting better at it.
.@kalyndimartin I put on a costume and let Freddie admire himself in the mirror
@theAnalogTimes Things are getting better for gay people, which is why the homophobes get so upset.
.@Doug_E_Fresh2 I‚Äôd love to see him in drag - Stuart too for that matter.
.@_Nam_Dam_ I love his smile and his sense of humour. I only wish I knew how to pronounce his name
.@Hristowen Swanning down the staircase
"@Doug_E_Fresh2: @IanMcKellen Do you stay in character on set? #ViciousPBS" as much as possible.
.@besuamj why dont you write to Jeremy his agent
.@PeterHStephens Absolutely not. However I‚Äôll suggest it to Gary Janetti who knows all
.@_jennnyyyy_ I think all the characters I‚Äôve played have been more interesting than I am
.@JK_believe That Ash has no problems being friends with an old gay geezer
.@SecularScot Like all good comedians Derek knows how to feed a laugh line
.@EvyPanda If the entire cast of Glee got down on their knees I might have to consider it
.@lizakhodarinova This is our friend Violet
.@FerdiAlessio Yes. Because ‚ÄúQueens‚Äù sounds judgemental.
. @_WalkOn_ Bliss. Took me right back to our undergraduate acting at Cambridge 50 years ago
.@christianb572 Refining the acting style. Which is why I‚Äôm looking forward to the second series
.@gaystheword Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, Quentin Criso, Stephen Fry. Spot the connection?
.@terryh47 Life is a comedy. You can‚Äôt even play Hamlet unless you know how to get a laugh.
.@erinduck It‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve ever been offered
.@JaneBuzJane It‚Äôs more dangerous. you only get one chance. I‚Äôve just completed 450 performances on stage in Waiting For Godot
.@mollyraesly Freddie make well be a wonderful actor. My favourite scene is in Episode 3 when you will see Freddie rehearsing
.@BaileyHilyard Laurence Olivier in particular for his theatre work.
.@BahnPamela Ghandi and Gandy
.@ReillyStoner Well I hope Gandalf gets a laugh or two. Vicious is a farce: if the audience doesn‚Äôt laugh we‚Äôre all wasting our time
.@ljbdomino Not during the recording but rehearsals have been hilarious.
.@a_shibs I have a bigger ego than Freddie and Derek loves his own dog as much as Stuart adores Balthazar
.@whitequeen58 For actors, comedy is a serious business. But who could not have fun with the Vicious lovelies, who are all expert comics
.@Natsgrrl all the same thing really but there is a special delight in hearing an audience laugh.

Ever since the magnificent Opera House first docked on Sydney Harbour, I waited to work there. Last night I made it under the iconic sails.
I'm awfully glad not to have met any of them in person when we were there last month.
On screen they are rivettingly nasty, especially the matriarch of the gang, played to perfection by Jacki Weaver.
Saw Australia's hit movie, direct from Sundance, "Animal Kingdom", about a crazed criminal family in Melbourne.
"Hearbeats" was declared the winner.
Today is the Queen's birthday-Her Majesty ie-so I celebrated with Sean Mathias at lunch with Sydney Film Festival folk.
The films will get made. I suspect we'll start shooting at end of this year.
"Hobbit" sets are ready, script ready and movie is casting this month. Fans are not to worry.

Seeing an unkempt old man down on his luck, a passerby said, "Need some help, brother?" and put $1 in my hat.

There's another week to go. Glad the snow has gone in London, as it can impede theatre-goers.
The amazing Godot scenery is up at the Theatre Royal Haymarket again and it feels like home.
After Godot rehearsals I did my Five Minutes interview with Matthew Stadlen for BBC News website. If only all interviews were as short.
