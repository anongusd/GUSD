It's very likely that South Florida's slow mail system, coupled with strict mail in ballot laws, hurt Democrats in 2018. In 2020, it could be worse.
It doesn't help that this facility was shutdown at a critical time because of the mail bomb situation in late October.
All of the mail for Broward County goes through a Miami-Dade USPS facility that is notorious for being slow, is likely overworked, and in rundown city with crumbling roads. As a result, the mail in Broward is slow.
Some people here in Broward County are quietly fearful that the region's slow mail delivery service, coupled with strict mail-in ballot rules, could have actually cost Nelson the Senate race--or at least had an effect.	https://t.co/kdhK50avgO

Good morning from recount HQ in Broward County, where the hand recount in the FL Senate race is set to begin at 7am. Here‚Äôs what it looks like. https://t.co/dqYV7QeBdm
Inside the room, this news sent shockwaves. For Dems, who need to add votes in Senate and governors races, this was a blow. If Nelson or Gillum had gained ground in the machine recount, we‚Äôll never know.
To clarify: going forward, Broward‚Äôs official total in the 2018 midterm election will be preliminary (pre-recount) results + manually tabulated ballots + overseas/military
So the Florida secretary of state's official numbers for the Broward machine recount will actually be the preliminary numbers from Saturday.
This just happened: Broward failed to make the 3pm deadline. Election planning director uploaded results 2 minutes late due to "unfamiliarity" with the state's website. State did not accept recount numbers. "Basically, I just worked my ass off for nothing," the official said.
Broward official just read out latest recount results. There is still a significant undervote between Senate and governor totals, meaning the votes Nelson needs to win didn‚Äôt appear on the machines, or at least not enough. Tomorrow‚Äôs hand recount will determine if they exist.
More from Broward: The expected hand recounts will begin early tomorrow morning here. It‚Äôs expected to be a marathon 14 hours for hundreds of volunteers. And that‚Äôs just the Senate race. Deadline is noon Sunday.

Alexa drove an hour to her canvassing board at 4pm on Thursday. Just under the wire, she pleaded with them to accept her ballot. Here's what happened next, in her own words:
Now, it was up to the county canvassing board whether to accept the provisional ballot. She had until 5pm on Thursday to make her case to them. Here's what happened next:
After Election Day, she learned provisional ballot was not counted. Technically, even if her absentee ballot was rejected, she had already voted, so now she had voted twice...
To "cure" this problem, voters must send in a signed affidavit and a copy of their ID. Alexa did not want to do this b/c she fears identity theft. Instead, she went to an early vote center and cast a provisional ballot in person.
This Florida voter is in Volusia County, and her name is Alexa. In a series of emails to me, she relayed her story. I haven't further verified it. She has been voting absentee for decades. But this time, the canvassing board rejected her ballot as having a mismatched signature.
Here is a story about how one Florida voter overcame the signature match law and made her sure ballot counted‚Äîthe law the Senate campaign is now suing over. It's a saga.

So according to Mitchell's former colleague, her memo does not meet the standards she sets for her own office. Instead, Long sees it as a product of political bias, discarding prosecutorial expertise rather than deploying it.
Fourth, Mitchell points out that Ford does not remember key details. ‚ÄúAgain, I was trained by Ms. Mitchell about how trauma explicitly does prevent memory from happening...I was trained explicitly by Ms. Mitchell to identify that as corroborative,‚Äù Long told me.
Third, Mitchell says the potential witnesses failed to corroborate Dr. Ford's account in signed statements to the Senate committee. Long says using this to discredit Ford is "bullshit." He calls these "unreliable" "hearsay" that fail any "standard that Ms. Mitchell would allow"
‚ÄúI challenge Ms. Mitchell directly on this issue because her office often charges cases with a very expanded timeline,‚Äù says Long. ‚ÄúI was trained explicitly by her to not consider this time thing as an inconsistency."
Second, Mitchell emphasizes that Dr. Ford alternately referred to the early 1980s and mid 1980s in discussing her assault. Mitchell points to this as a reason to doubt her story. Long, her former colleague, says this is a different standard than one her own office uses...
First, why did she apply the standards of criminal liability when she knows that the case hasn't been given an adequate investigation to reach a conclusion on that front. ‚ÄúMitchell doesn‚Äôt have sufficient information to even draw these conclusions,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed in my former boss and mentor,‚Äù says Matthew Long, who was trained by Mitchell as a sex crimes prosecutor and spent 12 years as a prosecutor in Arizona. Here are some of the biggest problems with Mitchell's memo, according to Long:

So here we are, months from a major election and Congress is sitting on their hands when it comes to election security. Here's my recent @MotherJones story on how vulnerable we are‚Äîand why Republicans are MIA on election security https://t.co/qtT1ljDX9u
For two years, Republicans have avoided holding hearings on Russian hacking of election systems and campaigns. There's a lot of blame to go around, but the fact that Republicans won't hold a hearing on a bill that has bipartisan support is bad news.
Election security bill markup canceled today. Russia interfered in myriad ways in our basic process of holding elections. Two years later, and with midterms approaching, Republicans can't even hold a hearing to discuss some pretty basic security upgrades.  https://t.co/SkUueVjRfZ

Yes, Congress already gave states $380 million for FY2018. But most experts I've talked to describe that as a downpayment, maybe 10-15% of what is needed to secure elections in the US. https://t.co/qtT1ljDX9u https://t.co/6eo4H0Nel7

@NSementelli I'm not expert, but I think he did get more conservative in recent years. I also think he got tired. He had so many opportunities this term to make his mark in a big way, esp. on his favorite amendment (the first), and each time he declined. He seemed just over it.

This term, Kennedy has sided with the conservatives on 5-4 decisions. If Kennedy had had any reservations about where the conservatives were headed, he might stay in order to side with the liberals on key issues. But those concerns don't seem to exist anymore.
Finally, I'm just gonna be one of those people who makes a prediction. I think Kennedy is going to retire, possibly tomorrow on the final day of the term.
In the last few weeks, this court has gone out of its way to condemn even a hint of bias against a Christian who refused to serve a gay couple, while going even further out of its way to ignore bias against African Americans, Latinos, and Muslims.
Today, faced with far more evidence of religious bias than in the Cakeshop case, the conservative majority decided that prejudice wasn't enough to block the travel ban. Sotomayor pointed this out in her dissent: https://t.co/IVe0bFY3AP
However, despite 9 findings of intentional racial discrimination against Texas, the court decided Monday that "the ‚Äògood faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed.'" https://t.co/HIAmrZHkmx So much for the context of bias in racial gerrymandering
SCOTUS had two different approaches to discrimination this term. In the case about the ant-gay cake baker, the court said government officials failed to respect the baker's Christian faith. Government officials, the court warned, shouldn't show bias. https://t.co/zcd2FGjZt1

The third and final‚Äîand permanent‚Äîban laid out many ways people like students or those seeking medical care could get waivers to enter the country. But as the Supreme Court was well aware, those waivers were "window dressing" to make a blanket ban look more reasonable.
Though the official reason for that ban was to review visa vetting procedures, the administration never prioritized that review. The results of the review, when finally completed, have not been shared with the court or the public. https://t.co/MjMORangOA
Trump tried to implement a travel ban on his 7th day in office. That ban explicitly sought to exempt Christians but block Muslims from 7 countries.
Chief Justice Roberts found this comparison offensive... Meanwhile, it just so happens that the Trump administration is holding children in cages with no plan to reunite them with their families.
Sotomayor compared today's opinion to the Supreme Court's infamous decision to uphold Japanese internment, noting the flimsy rational for that program and, again, ample evidence of bias.
First, let's look at the context today. This court just issued a ruling embracing flimsy evidence that the travel ban is not about anti-Muslim bias at the same time that Trump is talking about brown people invading our country at the southern border

On a party-line vote, the House Oversight Committee voted not to subpoena John Gore to force him to answer questions about the citizenship question on the US census right now. The motion to subpoena remains tabled for now.
rationale* doh
Gore's rational for adding a citizenship question to the census is that it will help the Civil Rights Division enforce the Voting Rights Act. But questioned by Gowdy, he can't name a single DOJ case that has been hampered by not having the question in the past.
Gowdy, the chairman, agrees to table the subpoena motion on the grounds that there is not currently a quorum.
Maloney says that the committee pursues parallel investigations all the time. If the committee couldn't do oversight every time a lawsuit is filed, she says, they might as well all go home
Rep. Maloney wants to subpoena Gore right now to force him to answer questions. "The problem is, Mr. Gore is not answering our questions...so I move that the committee subpoena Mr. Gore right now."
Gore says he asked for the citizenship question on the census in order to enforce voting rights. But in his career before DOJ, he was a Republican lawyer defending states accused of racial gerrymandering. https://t.co/OjbIQhaOao

This House Intel finding is literally lifted from a quote from a witness: Efforts to set up a "back channel" with Trump associates post-election suggest the absence of collusion b/c the communication associated with collusion would have rendered such a "back channel" unnecessary. https://t.co/4jFwT9fZCd
This finding is based entirely on 	 Jr's recollection of the meeting: "Donald Trump Jr. briefly met with a Russian government official at the 2016 National Rifle Association annual meeting, but the Committee found no evidence" they discussed the election.
House Intel Rs have spent months saying Carter Page is not the kind of man who deserves to be surveilled by the government. Their report now finds: "the Committee is concerned about his seemingly incomplete accounts of his	activity in Moscow."
House Intel Rs seem to think Flynn didn't lie to the FBI, even though he's plead guilty to that very crime? "Finding #22" is Flynn plead guilty to lying to the FBI "even though the Federal Bureau of Investigation agents did not detect any deception during Flynn's interview."
House Intel GOPers say Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 "demonstrated poor judgement" and "the Trump campaign's periodic praise for and communications with Wikileaks-a hostile foreign organization-to be highly objectionable and inconsistent with U.S. national security interests"

Liberals will likely find travel ban to be an illegal executive power grab, outside Trump's authority under immigration law. Conservatives seem too afraid of terrorists to think of it as anything but an emergency national security power. So it comes down to Kennedy.
The liberal justices, in addition to raising constitutional concerns about religious discrimination, wanted to know where the president gets the authority for the travel ban. This is likely the key to the case.
I wrote about the Justice Department's and conservatives' battle against the ability of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions here: https://t.co/OdXbjfKJbU
Justice Neil Gorsuch raised the issue of lower courts issuing broad injunctions that apply to the whole country, an issue that the Justice Department has raised in this case and others as district court judges keep knocking down Trump admin actions. "What can we do about that?"
He notes that the country denied entry to a 10-year-old with cerebral palsy seeking medical care, and dozens more who should have met the ban's exceptions.
Justice Stephen Breyer, as he sometimes does, hammered a single point that has broader implications: This ban looks like other executive orders because it has exceptions. But is this just "window dressing"? Is the government actually letting some ppl in?
Trump's lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, seemed to actually support Katyal's point when he repeatedly stressed "one principle purpose of the proclamation is to exert diplomatic pressure" on these countries over vetting procedures.
The rebuttal to this by lawyer Neal Katyal (who did a very good job in oral arguments) is that the travel ban is very separate from emergency scenarios.
The conservative wing seemed pre-occupied with the president's ability to ban nationals from a single country in an impending national security emergency. The chief justice brought up such a hypothetical where known terrorists were headed toward US to attack.
Kennedy seemed perturbed by hypotheticals in which presidents could get away with religious discrimination.
After Supreme Court oral arguments in travel ban case, I think it comes down to Justice Anthony Kennedy https://t.co/Tb1sXtA2D5
@MotherJones "I am living here for seven years, studying and working and paying my taxes, however because of my nationality now, I am worried that they won‚Äôt issue an immigration visa for my lovely wife."

@MotherJones "I am 4.5 months pregnant with a baby girl who might not even see his father as a result of this travel ban!"
@MotherJones "My son sees the therapist but it doesn‚Äôt help because the only thing he needs is his father, he‚Äôs just a little kid. This is the time he needs his father the most.		The only thing we want is to be like other families. Together. Not separated."

For Dems, the goal of this case is to win by losing: lose a gerrymandered district but gain a tool with which to challenge GOP gerrymanders, which are more prevalent. But even if the court blocks this gerrymander, it's not clear it will do so in a way that will apply to others
Justice Breyer seemed upset that the court was not also hearing a partisan gerrymandering case out of North Carolina alongside this one. The court has not yet decided whether to hear that case, though it presents perhaps the best facts for tackling the problem
Even liberal justices, including RBG and Kagan, worried that the test proposed by the plaintiffs would interfere with legitimate redistricting goals like undoing a past gerrymander, making a district competitive, or making the map work on a statewide level
After SCOTUS oral arguments in Maryland gerrymandering case, it's clear that most justices are uncomfortable with how Democrats drew state's Sixth District to maximize partisan advantage...but they struggled with how to contain such behavior

Booker points to the fact that members of Congressional Black Caucus are at the Judiciary Committee today opposing Farr
Specifically, the issue is whether or not Farr lied about his knowledge of a voter suppression scheme on the part of Jesse Helms, who sent cards to 100k black voters with incorrect info about voting and warning that voter fraud is a crime.
Booker says it's not too much to ask to bring Farr back before committee to answer questions. "If there's nothing to hide, why not have a chance to set the record straight."
Sen. Booker says Farr seems to have given "misleading testimony" to Senate Judiciary Committee about his involvement with a 1990 scheme to stop African Americans from voting in a North Carolina election.

But this strategy often targeted poor, immigrant, and minority voters. And the result was low participation in American elections. So Congress sought to end these purges in the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. Now, the court could open the door to such purges again.
For much of the 20th century, states purged voter rolls to prevent fraud, and in the process disenfranchised millions of voters. Essentially, states used a voter's failure to cast a ballot in a recent election to purge them from the list.
Next week, the Supreme Court will hear a case that could lead to purges of voter lists across the country: https://t.co/cCW0pj2qV3

These two statements from attorneys for and against travel ban sum up ideologies of Trump and his allies and his political opponents https://t.co/T6hLsNy11L
After 9th Circuit oral arguments, main takeaway still whether courts will consider Trump's anti-Muslim statements https://t.co/cTSJ2T5ryj
(Article 3 establishes the judicial branch of the federal government)
Katyal: US is a beacon b/c of "majestic Article 3 and the grand contours of the 1st Amend."	Wall: What makes it a beacon is the rule of law
At end of arguments on travel ban, lawyers for both sides disagree on why US is a beacon to the world...
Wall: Leave this where it belongs, in the political arena.
Wall: Even if we're wrong on standing and merits, most you can get is an injunction against part of it.
Well, almost final point. Wall also argues that injunction blocking travel ban executive order is too broad...
Acting SG Wall's final point: There just isn't enough in the record to get to a bad faith finding to block travel ban.
Katyal conludes: If court rules against ban it preserves the status quo. If it allows ban, "you open the door to so much."
As his time runs out, Katyal returns to key issue of Trump's statements: "The bad faith exception‚Ä¶ is enough to rule in our favor"
Katyal goes on to say test should be: how would an objective observer view 1st Amendment protections for religion in Trump's ban?
Judge Hawkins: Why shouldn't court defer to the office of the president of the United States? Katyal: "That's the million dollar question"
Katyal: ruling against Trump travel ban won't erode power of future presidents b/c this is a very special case due to Trump's statements
Katyal: "Context matters, it always has in the context of the Establishment Clause." Calls context in travel ban case "overwhelming."
Neal Katyal, plaintiffs' lawyer, uses Trump's tweets and statements to make the case that travel ban is actually a Muslim ban.
Attorney for plaintiffs, Neal Katyal, follows up on this point. "President rekindled those [campaign] statements" as president.
@mpratschner The government says the EO, the plaintiffs say both. Thus far, judges have said both.

Acting SG Wall says yes, he has made statements approaching that. (His campaign website removed Muslim ban press release a week ago.)
Judge follow-up: Has Trump ever repudiated his calls for a Muslim ban on the campaign trail? "Has he ever said anything approaching that?"
Acting SG Wall responds: You need a "affirmative showing of bad faith" to block travel ban as a secret Muslim ban
Judge Gould: How is a court supposed to know if it's a Muslim ban in the "guise" of a national security "justification"?
