@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So did every other president. No US President made North Korea's leader crazy, unpredictable, and dangerous. No blame needed...
@RepTrentFranks Pathetic!
@SenatorCollins Let them know that you stand for the American people and not politics. They tried to bully you, but you stood firm.
@Cyn190 @SenatorCollins Sabotaging ACA means sabotaging the jobs that have been created by it. So grateful for Collins @SenJohnMcCain @lisamurkowski
@SenatorCollins So grateful that youre a voice of reason to a party that I once strongly affiliated myself with. We all win when we're all in #worktogether
@marcorubio @NCAA So you have an opinion on this but you have nothing to say about healthcare, jobs or Russia? I wonder how your constituents feel about that.
@iamcardib Proud of you Cardie! Been following you and yo slick mouth since the beginning #BodakYellow
@marcorubio I want to hear your thoughts on whats happening in the Government right now. The bible verses are great, but not what we need.
