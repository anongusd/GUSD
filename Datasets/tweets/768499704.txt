At the very least, it has created the perception of a corrupted process &amp; raises questions that warrant scrutiny.
It was abnormal for the DNC to create any such joint-fundraising committee with any candidate prior to the party's official selection.
Bottom line: Whether HVF has acted within its legal rights or not, I still view it &amp; the Clinton campaign's use of it as illegitimate.
plus, there's the added "bonus" of being able to buy off state parties
in which case, the joint-fundraising committee w/ the DNC provides a way for the campaign &amp; her big$ supporters to skirt contribution limits
Just a tiny % of Sanders contributors have maxed out, not the case for Clinton &amp; her large donor funders
Not to mention, any $$ Sanders raised through such a fund could be funneled &amp; used by the DNC to support his opponent.
The Sanders' campaign's ability to rely upon small donors makes it so they have no need to make use of the DNC's joint-fundraising committee
That the DNC set up a joint-fundraising committee for Bernie too is irrelevant to my specific concerns about the HVF.
Somehow I got myself all tangled up in an argument on Facebook about the legitimacy o the Hillary Victory Fund.

.@Botas111 I see LBJ as more of a conduit for civil rights legislation. Credit for being a positive one, but I'd hardly championize him.
.@Botas111 I take issue with the descriptor of champions, as well as how the assigning of only two erases the impact of countless of others.
&amp; 2) insisting that a film about civil rights activists/organizers *must also* do the work of "redeeming" LBJ serves a malignant purpose.
Of course, 1) that redemptive marker is placed as high as our own out-sized perceptions of the man are. We disallow him to be shown flawed.
Thus, I see the critiques of Selma as resulting from a desire for the historical redemption of LBJ among those who favor him.
In large part, this is a reaction to decades of a less than rosy representation of LBJ in political/historical narratives, also other films.
Which may cause us to irrationally oppose any depiction of LBJ that isn't wholly centered on those "good" or "admirable" qualities.
I think there are those of us (fans of LBJ) who have a tendency towards over-emphasizing what we loved, while erasing/forgiving his faults.
I've not seen Selma, so I can't much speak to it's portrayal of LBJ. I've been following the "discussion", though.

Fuey, where'd the evening go? G'night.
Seems like Shriver Report work has included a policy focus in the discussion, which I'm glad. I'm just not here for the tips/advice part.
These women don't need tips/advice. They need policy.
Placing the onerous on individual women to prevent/avoid/combat poverty @ a micro level excuses inaction on a larger, more meaningful scale.
I do worry about what giving tips/advice for what WOMEN specifically can do to avoid experiencing poverty and/or to get out of poverty says.
I appreciate very much the spotlight the documentary is placing on how gender, motherhood &amp; poverty all intersect. Needs plenty more attn.
I look forward to watching #PaycheckToPaycheck later. I am concerned by some of what I've seen said, but hope my concerns are proven wrong.
