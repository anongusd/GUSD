@krassenstein You really are a smuck. It’s a quote from Rush Limbaugh. You think he should be impeached because of a quote he tweeted from someone else. Really?? Keep dreaming b**ch. You and your comment is just one more example why I will NEVER EVER be a DEMOCRAT again!
@krassenstein You Dumb F**k. Manafort was charged with crimes from years ago, nothing to do with TRUMP. Cohen same thing taxi medallions. Flynn setup told he doesn’t need a lawyer present when meeting FBI agents out to get him. FBI agents Comey, McCabe, Strock, Page. 	ALL FIRED!	NO COLLUSION! https://t.co/6DkWnCFGfn

@UatuAndStan @cutiekimmy704 The tunnels exist because of the bull**** fencing that exists now that does not go deep enough to prevent it. So you admit there are tunnels? And that’s ok with you?? Meanwhile thousands of Americans die everyday from drug overdoses. Oh but nothing to see here...keep moving...SMH
@UatuAndStan @cutiekimmy704 You’re obviously getting your facts from the biased liberal media that says there is no problem at the border. Meanwhile human beings are being trafficked, drugs are being smuggled and illegal entry. THE BORDER PATROL IS SAYING WE NEED A BARRIER to slow this down. FOOL! WAKE UP!!
@UatuAndStan @cutiekimmy704 So you’re saying no drugs come across the border unless it’s at a port of entry? Well you’re a misinformed jack***.  Get your facts straight fool. Have you heard of tunnels? Have you heard of coyotes? Your ridiculous ignorance will be the downfall of this Country! Build The Wall! https://t.co/HHkiZgS4K7

@BeezzyD @cruckel11 Where do you get these phony statistics? I’m sure it’s from some left-wing think tank. I WILL NEVER BE A DEMOCRAT AGAIN! They are a LOST PARTY THAT STANDS FOR SOCIALISM, COMMUNISM, ANARCHISM. Look at what they are doing to an honorable Judge. I’m sure you can care less about that
@BeezzyD @cruckel11 @Joey769011 @ChrisCuomo @FoxNews @POTUS @BarackObama You really are Brainwashed! I watch Fox and they are NOT STATE PROP. They always have people on from the other side. So called, “Democratic Strategists” and they debate the news of the day. If you think Fox is State Propaganda you really are far gone. As TRUMP would say...SAD.
@cruckel11 @BeezzyD This hater could NEVER change my mind. I am well informed and have seen things from both sides. 	I guess he doesn’t mind:	1)Higher Taxes	2)Open Borders 	3)Sanctuary Cities	4)Outsourcing Jobs	5)Job Killing Regulations 	6)Unfair Trade Deals	7)Weak Military	8)Due Process
@BeezzyD @cruckel11 @Joey769011 @ChrisCuomo @FoxNews LOL you are speaking to someone who was once a Democrat so I see the blatant BIAS on CNN and MSNBC and you are naive and ignorant if you can’t see that for yourself. CNN, MSNBC etc.. bashes TRUMP all day long with their ridiculous, nauseating panels of experts. PATHETIC. https://t.co/rWCJIzehiu
@BeezzyD @Joey769011 @ChrisCuomo No kidding “Dumbass”  The great President TRUMP says “WE WILL” “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN” Which he is doing. Shall I go over the economic indicators or do you Dems not care about that..Outsourcing our jobs, open borders, socialism, increasing taxes, horrible trade deals. NO BUENO
@BeezzyD Oh please “Russian Bot” is that all you Dems have to say when someone has an opposing view. I’m an Italian New Yorker and proud of it. Our current Mayor is an Ahole and the Governor is a disgrace to the Italian race, but I still ♥️ NY and yes I have nothing better to do.
@BeezzyD Thanks for asking BeezzyD 🐝 No I haven’t looked at every statistic but I would have to beg to differ about all Red States in  all those areas...have you ever looked at the crime statistics in blue cities like CHICAGO, Detroit, San Fran, Baltimore?  All run by Democrat Mayors.
