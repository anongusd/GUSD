Sanders wants open boarders because he is a cuck to big business. Cheap labor. He is not a hero. He exploits the weak and feable minded. Feable minded liberals.
Remember that corporations are globalist at their core. Cheap, plentiful labor. Business is not on your side. Amazon, Dell, Walmart all lobby for open boarders. Why do you think there is no wall. Why pay an American a decent wage when you can exploit an immigrant.
