There is nothing radical about a tax break. I repeat: in order to avoid economic collapse and mobilize now for climate change, we need to increase taxes on our wealthiest, not simply bandage the middle class and poor (while doing nothing for the very poor or to the very rich).

@rpetty @ShevrinJones You're shaming my Rep for pointing out obvious truths about the racial and gender realities of this situation? One could only wonder why you don't want to discuss race anymore after that Sun Sentinel article. Tip: my Rep will say whatever he wants, whenever he wants about race.
There's two tallies for ballots: API and ENR. API generates in real time by machine and on election night, showed ~715,000 votes in Broward. ENR is what the SOE is referring to, and on election night was ~600,000. These ballots are not just appearing. They're legitimate votes. https://t.co/I6YfjZSNle
This is true. From my 2016 pollworker training, the ballots go in a zipper bag that gets locked with a tag, and the equipment goes in boxes when all is done. Though it's concerning that the equipment was left at the schools, it's much less damning than leaving ballots. https://t.co/iouPsmk2cN

I see the fake outrage over bullying, trying to use bullying as an emotional tug to expand the power of charter schools. I'd love if the other representatives actually cared about bullying like they say they do. It's a serious issue that isn't fixed by funding for-profit schools.
I went to both public and private school. I was bullied at both. The idea that bullying only happens at public schools and therefore we need to much more generously fund  charter schools is absurd. Bullying happens regardless of whether a school is public or for-profit.

@PollackHunter @ShevrinJones @BillyCorben @TimWSternberg The Rep and I work in conjunction to create his schedule, @PollackHunter. Perhaps you're proposing that if the Rep had directly connected with Tim to organize the meeting instead of me doing my job, then Tim would have come. But I doubt that would have happened.
@BillyCorben @TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones Me either, @BillyCorben. I still saw the exchange because *lol* of course the aide has access to the Rep's account... He just doesn't want me confirming that we set up an appointment that he last moment backed out of. Oh well, I'm confirming that here anyway regardless.
@ShevrinJones @BillyCorben I'll be very honest that of the political opinions I have seen, Tim does not support many black people. He is a cyber-only organizer against black leaders, and when I respectfully called on him to look at that contrast, that's when I got blocked the first time. He seems fragile.
@ShevrinJones @BillyCorben So. I just saw that I got tagged, but Tim blocked me again (after the first time he unblocked me). Now I'm back to being blocked once Rep. tagged me. But I saw the whole exchange on Rep's account anywayüòÇ When Tim canceled I told Rep "he's Twitter fingers."

I swear--even the outside support from other orgs and donors was because of Gillum being spectacular. He gave everyone hope. It begins with candidate. It's the candidate. It's the candidate. It's the candidate. It's the candidate. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.
Big organizing. Is because of the candidate. If the candidate isn't the whole package, people won't open their calendars or their reputations for them. You don't need big money to be a great candidate, and even moreso it can be a huge liability for regular folks' trust.
Our volunteers would go to random events, not in groups. My friend Tyler would go alone to the farmer's market to hand out lit. I was the only person representing Gillum in the Pride Parade. One or a couple passionate vols were all we needed, not swarms of paid folks.
So for both all the people who asked about his field operation, and for these journalists who apparently are just now getting briefed on Gillum's candidacy, it starts with an amazing candidate. People follow because of who the candidate is, not because they're getting paid.
And that's exactly how Gillum won his first race for Tallahassee city commission. He bought shirts and his friends pushed the brand knocking doors. When people are loved and inspired and hopeful, they don't need money to push the message, because they have all bets on it.
When they would go to events, do the thing, they'd leave because they weren't on the clock. Gillum's field consisted of many, many more unpaid people who would wear their shirt everywhere and hold it down at all hours, because there was no clock.
That take hinges on the idea that field only consists of paid field organizers and directors. Which, with that definition, absolutely. They paid the most people to go to events and do the thing. Fine. But
I don't make threads but I'm about to. I've read plenty of "hot takes" from national and Florida reporters on the fact that a different well-endowed campaign had the best field team. AND I'M PUTTING IT ON RECORD NOW: NO.

@TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones Having read one book on race does not qualify that now one doesn't have to discuss race ever again. There is no resume for "okay now I'm not racist or vulnerable to implicit bias." There was a lot to unpack in those statements too but I haven't accused you of anything so...
@TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones I will not stop saying what I choose to say, about anything, race included. I will continue to center it as a focal point of any discussion.
@TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones What do you mean by convenientlyü§î let's unpack THAT
@TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones Also, I never once heard @ShevrinJones speak up on the racism of it today, but if he did, he's right. And I'll speak to you any moment about it because while he may have a lot on his hands all the time, I have plenty of time to educate people on white supremacy.
@TimWSternberg @ShevrinJones Sir, you're educated. You know about implicit bias. I don't have to tell you that white supremacy persists and even if racism is not the main factor, it's still a factor... Right? Anyway, racism is not about hurting anyone's feelings or being offended. It's a systemic hierarchy.

@Refinery29 @GwenGraham 4. If you dig through Emma Gonzalez's tweets some, you will find this. A gubernatorial candidate who was sued by the NRA and won in court. Who debated our House Speaker on gun control and immigration the night BEFORE the tragedy. Someone who cared before a press event. https://t.co/ZHc9XJa7Bw
@Refinery29 @GwenGraham 1. Gwen Graham believes that any law-abiding citizen should be able to own any gun they want 2. She would not sponsor a ban on assault weapons 3. When asked the biggest policy difference between her and Senator Graham, she said she has a greater appreciation for gun rights.
