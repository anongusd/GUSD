@MushKat @ATLSAHM @KneesPenguin @Anthrax Well, they play here the following Saturday. You could visit and we could go.
@KneesPenguin @ATLSAHM @Anthrax Oh yeah. Still recording and touring.
@MushKat @KneesPenguin @ATLSAHM @Anthrax They are great live. When I lived in L.A., I saw them a lot. Loved every show.
@MushKat @KneesPenguin @ATLSAHM Awesome! That would be a blast.
@KneesPenguin @ATLSAHM It‚Äôs @Anthrax. I‚Äôm a metal head. \m/ \m/ I‚Äôve seen them several times, but I‚Äôd still like to go.
@ATLSAHM Yay!		There‚Äôs a concert I want to go to in February. No one wants to go with me and I don‚Äôt want to go alone. Guess I‚Äôll be skipping that show. üò¨
@ATLSAHM Oh nice! Have a good time. Sounds like a fun night.
@KneesPenguin Oh how I wish that were true in practice. This place tilts left. So, I‚Äôd be the one to get in trouble and reported for re-programming.
