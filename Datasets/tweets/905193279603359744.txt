@RaniaKhalek @AnissaNow What about the fact that most of Venezuelan parliament and people in general don't believe the most recent elections were legitimate? Maduro's poor governance is starving his own people. It is not US sanctions, most target corrupt individuals not the entire country

@SteveScalise Everyday Palestinians are NOT terrorists;as Israel’s strongest global ally we should hold Is to a standard of fair &amp; humane treatment of Pal civilians and stop turning a blind eye to violations of human rights. It is Pal identity that is under threat of extinction, not vice versa
@SteveScalise While I don’t agree with Rep. Omar’s statements, at least someone in Washington isn’t afraid to speak up against 🇮🇱. Their policies towards Palestine equate to apartheid, illegal occupation and settlement of the West Bank. Hezbollah doesn’t represent Palestinian civilians, esp WB

Climate change is essentially the degradation of our atmosphere and we would lose its moderating effect on temp
@KimStrassel @WSJopinion a comprehensive plan to combat climate change. Climate change isn’t just going to wait for a perfect solution to appear, we need to start taking the dialogue more seriously. Many Republicans including the president won’t even recognize it as a real issue. That’s counterproductive
@KimStrassel @WSJopinion I’m terrified of living on a planet with temperatures like the surface of Mars, so what’s your plan to avoid that?
