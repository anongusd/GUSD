@OAmollo @SokoMad @africaupdates Hon otiende I think you need to give an explanation of what devolution means to a Kenyan people when the national government can bring in illegal sugar with cancer traces and the devolved government is quieter because that is meant for the national government bullshit
@OAmollo @SokoMad @africaupdates But what if the national goverent fails like for the present case the devolved government must join hands in fighting this because it affects all the Kenyan population and no one should run out of this.
@OAmollo We elect people like you into power with a hope of being reputable only to see into your gluttonous nature and greed for money now this is being blamed on MPs and other official in the government where a we going as a nation if we cannot be protected by those in power.
@MigunaMiguna I think madness and some dictatorial take can help for the Kenya situation or even having your own tarlibans who can threaten the state whenever it makes a useless decision that is meant to benefit their cartels rather Kenyan people as a nation
@MigunaMiguna @UKenyatta @WChebukati @IEBCKenya @dkmaraga This is the truth but he should keep in mind one thing power remains but those in power changes after a short period watch out what will happen to him while out of power
