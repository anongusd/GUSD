@LoveCreating @PamKeithFL No one has mentioned this, and I so agree. As a single father of a daughter (almost 18 now) I have always been bothered by the extreme sexualization of young girls on the Disney Channel.  These girls are essentially teaching sexualized behaviors to the young girls watching.
@GeorgeTakei Did 5 years in my 20s over drugs (20+yrs sober now). Lots of drugs inside, and IMHO walls may well have made it harder to bust incoming drugs, because of the criminal ingenuity used to circumvent them. So, I imagine we will see less drug busts with the wall, but no less drugs.
Too many examples of this.  White americans have a duty to hold people accountable based on what they do, and not the amount of pigment in their skin. I will do my part. I hope the rest of will, too. https://t.co/PVuRUM5XGP

You work for WE THE PEOPLE, Senator, so as one of those you were hired to work for, I call on you share the responsibilty of your parties actions, stand up for your constiuents, and help end these petulant partisan politics. They serve no one.
Further, isn‚Äôt ending this shutdown far more important than delivering the SOTA ‚Äúimmediately and verbally‚Äù?  Whether Dems are complicit in the shutdown at this point or not, it was started by The Donald, under the GOP lead 115th congress, and could have been ended then.

@RoyBlunt I want, as a constiuent, to ask you to see reason, to think of those you serve (not just who fills your coffers) when voting to cripple lives, like you did on tax reform.  Alas, you have proven repeatedly that average Missourians don‚Äôt matter to you, so I will just say: https://t.co/ZdfbkA0KTx
@VP Today I think you would do well to reflect on Matthew 25:31‚Äì46 and consider your ‚Äútie breaker‚Äù vote.  Listen to that still small voice, if it hasn‚Äôt been made mute by your prior actions.  It‚Äôs not too late.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Real question: why are you teaching your toddler to behave that way? I know the Drumpf klan sees women as little more than sexual chattel, but he‚Äôs only 2!! Training him to sexualize his teachers is some @MooreSenate level pedo shit.  Seriously, what is wrong with you?

@FoxNews @POTUS Not treating America properly, IMO, but I do think @realDonaldTrump believes he is treating our country with love, because the only expression of love he seems to understand is fucking (e.g. @IvankaTrump) and he is giving it to America like @RealRonJeremy in a ‚Äòroid rage.
@PressSec In no way do I mean to disparage your looks, but as it seems you never smile, I wonder is it that your face just naturally makes your smile look like a snarl, or is it that you are so devoid of joy, compassion, truth, and humanity that you are unable to smile? #curious
@EdKrassen I still wake up every day questioning the reality of his being the office holder. Even after a year, his winning seems like a horrific joke, and his tenure thus far like a cruel and sadistic prank.  #riftinthematrix
@dariameetsworld @tedcruz I‚Äôd love it if just one of these ‚Äúsocialism is the debil‚Äù folks would first explain to me what they would prefer their taxes (which they‚Äôll pay regardless) go toward, and moreso declare that they don‚Äôt ever want the SOCIAL security they paid in to because, hey, fuck socialism.
@tedcruz It must be awful to wake up every day as such an utterly unlikable creature. I bet you even want to kick your own ass. Thoughts and prayers for you, you poor unsightly fig.
@realDonaldTrump:  ‚ÄúThe intentional disregard of the historical trauma of Pocahontas as a sexual assault survivor directly resulting from colonization is disturbing.‚Äù‚ÄîAmber Kanazbah Crotty of the Navajo Nation. She sure ain‚Äôt talking code, eh, Herr Presidente?

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump tried to do the same, however, his most recent (televised) attempt was an epic failure.
@StephenKing One reason he was able to live so long was free access to tax-payer funded healthcare.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, his name is Al Franken , or Senator Franken @SenFranken .  Frankenstein was a doctor in a book (you should try one) by Mary Shelley (yes, a woman‚ÄîGASP).  Frankenstien is not anything.  #spellcheck
