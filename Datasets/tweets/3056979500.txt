Parsons Fertilizer is getting closer to opening, worked on wiring, then water, now bathrooms and plumbing. Remodel completely bathroom and added new shower room for government reg,s. https://t.co/zcU5r24Qre
Well we are gutting the bathrooms and starting anew. Had to replace the  ceiling and now tomorrow we start pressure testing the water pipes  before we start tiling the floors and painting the walls the final  colors. Hopefully next week we will be finished with new shower room. https://t.co/yuBvbEiKcJ
Well we are starting to remodel these 75 year old bathrooms and install a  shower to meet OSHA standards, low and behold we find two baby rattle  snakes and the skin from there mother six feet long, sure hope we don't  meet up with her. https://t.co/559ye3t0CL
Parsons Fertilizer has a handyman position open it's a salary position $1,600 a month. Text 918-716-0455 for more information. https://t.co/mrx03yN84b
Well guys guess I need to post something since it's been a while, but we have been really busy at the plant.  I'm lucky to have hired a good staff so far. Keep us in your prayers as we move forward.
the wire is ran from the front to the back to building, and pulled the  wire from building to outside electric poles and cleaned and put back.  Had to check if it was good still being ran underground. Metal stand being made then we can install meter base. https://t.co/DcLE9KRrrg
@NickEhlers01 Steak, bake tater, and salad the perfect meal with Texas toast yum yum
@thisfarmwife @JuanitaLevy20 that is all so good with slices of potato fried in a little oil in pan till brown then put with that on your sandwich
Got the electrical wire in place for the electrician to hook up shut off and install meter base. We are excited to see electric in the building soon. https://t.co/JDxCvxf4Tg
@PitstickFarms no way I would wear crocs and build a building
We are  starting to move equipment in, I forgot how heavy this 3 ton beast is to move. We probably will have to move our opening date a month or so because of having to rewire whole building first. https://t.co/ToOF1Pkr7u
@KTULNews if they really cared about children they would keep them home and do things the right way.
Construction begins at Parsons Fertilizer  https://t.co/8cCI2JvjZe
@KevinSandersLaw @Oreo @Krystal ok send me four Krystal with cheese fry's and a shake please lol
@RogerMarshallMD All boosters need to drop there funding for any sport or activity.

Does anyone know anyone who likes to invest in green technology?	https://t.co/DxTKlK9t3I	https://t.co/wBrc9jpQrc
@SmithAgConrad Really only time fields signs needed are when you are trying something new, signs are free advertising for the company selling it.
Because of us recycling so much waste a day we are starting to pick up investors in making fertilizer. So glad when September gets here and our grand opening happens. https://t.co/uR4ESeYSP3
@KTULNews They shouldn't have to, if someone is a criminal that's the way it goes.
@JohnBoozman @DeptVetAffairs Well the @DeptVetAffairs  is not no better I got out of Army on crutches, walked with a cane for two years, and had the Florida VA do traction on my neck, well all those records have come up missing when they went from paper to computer Today I can't turn my head,  I get nothing.
From all of us at Parsons Fertilizer we hope all fathers around the world are having a great day today. And if you haven't called your dad today don't forget to. https://t.co/I5IM2e1ywo
@jaxlef14 @KansasWheat Hey Jacquelyne may I ask what are you using as fertilizer.
@SmithAgConrad That is a hell of a way to change your oils
Moving furniture in and stting up offices. What a day https://t.co/KNOzUFgZ64
@BernardKerik @donnabrazile Hate to say if people aren't supporting him in this meeting they are just plain stupid, because when you are trying to control a killer who has control of a country all people should be supporting the president whether hes democrat or republican.
@SmithAgConrad Ive seen other farmers do this, it works great for dry areas to hold moisture in the ground and use less chemicals on weed control.
@SmithAgConrad One of the biggest problems is we are slowly living in a world of uneducated people, then on top of it we have a media that plays sides. One part is republican and the other part is democrat, so you never know if the news is correct anymore.
@KTULNews Question is where are they going to move them to.
@shawnanderson21 @KansasWheat @AGCOcorp Thank you the site is https://t.co/Qmv1RlzyEA  Thx again
@shawnanderson21 @KansasWheat @AGCOcorp Can I use it on a fertilizer site we are building its hard to find good farming pictures
@shawnanderson21 @KansasWheat @AGCOcorp Hey Shawn did you take this picture
My question is why would the United States spend millions of dollars on building two war ships then never use them and pay Canada a million dollar each to cut them up. My other question is why did we spend 650 million dollars building a website and pay a Canada company to do it.
Today - Parsons Fertilizer Brand Opening September 2018 https://t.co/vrm3fvb6lQ via @
@MarshaBlackburn We are so sick of hearing what you guys are doing because us the America people dont see it.
@BetsyFreese @eburnsthompson Our new fertilizer plant has the ability to take liquid waste from pigs and such and turn it into a dry mix ferttilizer that Texas AM did studies with that worked great for corn, using one third the amount of nitrogen.
@FOX23 I would like to know why criminals even have the right to have a cell phone
@KTULNews Who cares, they are none American company anyway
@kmoxnews @RoyBlunt Well he needs to sign a bill to help all the veterans from the 70's and 80's who the VA lost there records changing from paper to computers
Tomorrow we start meeting with our potenial new investors, I pray this goes good for us. selling one percent shares for 16,000 up to 25 percent. Grand opening is projected for September. Attached a brief Pitch Deck https://t.co/KagV1f0Lbe https://t.co/xaOKmV85y0
@cnnbrk I just lost my faith in him when he let her in the white house.
@USArmy @SecArmy @ArmyChiefStaff WELL THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF SO MANY FROM THE 70'S THAT THE va LOST THERE RECORDS SWITCHING FROM PAPER TO COMPUTERS. BECAUSE i AM TERMINAL WITH LEUKEMIA AND WILL DIe BEFORE THEY FIX IT. BEEN FIVE YEARS NOW STILL WAITING.
@JerryRice Do you guys really read anything we tweet to you, just wondering.
@JerryMoran Well they need to do something to help the veterans from the 70's because they suck at it. I am terminal with leukemia and will die before they get done with my file been five years now. They lost part of our records switching from paper to computers.
@SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump Well when it comes to veterans from the 70's you guys suck at taking care of us. VA LOOSES SOME OF OUR MEDICAL RECORDS CHANGING OVER TO COMPUTERS AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR. WAITING FIVE YEARS NOW I am terminal and will die from leukemia before I see anything.
@RepFilemonVela Only if they do it legally.
Looking for a few investors: Parsons Fertilizer will be selling stocks shares in there new plant in Parsons Kansas, shares will start at a dollar a piece minimum of 16,000  for one percent. https://t.co/KagV1f0Lbe
@BDoeschot I hope so, because we don't buy anything from Tysons
As most of you know by now were are building a new fertilizer Plant in Parsons Kansas,  We need to raise $320,000 to finish installing all our  equipment and have it up and running, 	 https://t.co/uK5bipPxre	 https://t.co/KagV1f0Lbe
@BernardKerik Who really cares about a bunch of over paid children
@BDoeschot wonder if they will change how the chickens are raised
@MagicJohnson Hi this is William Shirley you know my brother Jim Shirley from Orlando, by chance do you know anyone out there that likes to invest in Green Technology.
@sherman_news Thank you for following us, my son tells me to come into the 21st century with internet, so here's me trying to. Plus I am building a new business in Kansas is why I followed you.
@RealJamesWoods  Hi James, may I ask you a question, if this seems wrong to you please forgive me. But when I was director for National Camps for Blind children a man said if you don't ask you won't get it. By chance do you know anyone who likes to invest in green technology.
I am in the process  of building our new fertilizer plant in Parsons Kansas, attached is two links. One is a Project Scope and the other is a brief Pitch Deck. Looking for small investors https://t.co/uK5bipPxre https://t.co/KagV1f0Lbe
@Kaks0201 @BryanLowry3 Well I am on a school board, we see on the average of 12 -15 kids a day in 1st and 2nd grade come to school hungry, why do you think most schools serve breakfast now. And no reason with the food stamp program for kids they do this. So it's not nerve it's facts.
@Kaks0201 @BryanLowry3 Plus I am in my sixties, when I went to Junior High they had a class on fire arm safety and how to clean a gun. And of coarse I got a bible because all the kids got a pocket version.
@RogerMarshallMD I am a disabled veteran, who got hurt back in the 70's and when they changed from paper to computer they lost 6 years of my records and to this day I still get nothing. Can't turn my head or bend over at all since 1979. Spine is a mess. Plus have leukemia now terminal.
@Kaks0201 @BryanLowry3 Kathy you live in Kansas this is normal part of America, but there are cities in our country where kids go to school without breakfast or lunch, and I am talking about first and second graders to. And if schools have to feed kids that means parents aren't training them either
@BryanLowry3 I think parents need to grow up and start acting like adults, I remember we use to have our shoot guns in our truck during school because we went hunting before school.
I would like to know why is that our soldiers who have gave there life willing to our country have to do without because the VA has lost some of their medical records when switching over to computers.
@KTULNews no

@realDonaldTrump @KimKardashian Now I wonder why
@Ronna30087777 No Ronna I am just a American like so many others, no more no less
Camp is coming up quickly and they could use your help.
@JerryRice Looks pretty good from here Jerry
@CRSBfriends Congrats guys
@KassyDillon @realDailyWire congrats kid
@KTULNews This guy just has mental problems plain and simple, you can't fix this
@tulsaworld Hey if John Wayne could fly coach then who does this guy think he is.
@CherokeeNation @KTULNews @chiefbillbaker is it for all veterans of just tribal Indian vets
@BernardKerik So sorry for their loss
@rep_stevewomack @HouseGOP Congress has done nothing for me, I am a disabled Vet who the VA lost some of my records from back in 1981-86, I got out of Army on crutches still this day walk with a cane and for my back and spine I get nothing. After seeing two congressman
Well back to the old grind stone tomorrow. Look out Kansas here I come. Have a few things I pray go easy. I  still need to find a $320K investor or investors.  Looks like I have a busy week already.
@newsmax @BernardKerik Far as I am concerned the Veterans Administration does nothing for us, they lost part of my medical records from back in the 80's and now I am terminal with leukemia and I am getting no help for my neck and spine injury's.
I had the honor of serving in United States Army 1/41st 2nd Armor Division from 1978-81, all the men who have done this wrote a blank check for there life for the people of our country. So remember a veteran on this day.
@JimInhofe It's funny most politicians use the military to show the world they care, when in reality it is only about getting reelected. Because so far I haven't seen anything that the two I connected for help, one being you.
@JimInhofe @realDonaldTrump Hurt twice in the military back in 1978-81, day I got out was discharged walking on crutches, six months then a cane for a year. After I got out traction on my neck. Went to VA in Gainesville Florida. from 81-89 no records found today and can't turn head at all now.
@BernardKerik @BillOReilly @NewsmaxTV @boyscouts They need to be done if they have no more since then to do what they are doing. I am glad my kids are to old for boy scouts now
We just got done meeting with the electrical company that will be doing all of our new electric insulation and will handle any problems that might a rise in the future. Will be 45 days before they can start our job and will take two months to complete. https://t.co/bFpB3pBURm
@CatchItKansas @USD265_EHS nope he was safe
@JimInhofe @realDonaldTrump Well you keep treating our men and women like I have been treated we won't have a military.
Hey  guys if any of you like to donate to help a  good cause let me know.  Reason is National Camps for Blind Children is gearing up for summer  camp.  The cost for a week is around $600, or if you know someone  give them my cell # 918-716-0455
Since we found one large investors let’s see on the last $160,000 we need can we find small investors at $16,000 per one percent. So we are offering ten percent sale of stock in our company min of one percent at $16,000 or you can buy all ten.	  	  https://t.co/axUexLWpgq
@JeffFlake That's where  you are wrong, because if they people who are doing the investigating are crooked someone needs to be able to get them.

@JohnHeim67 Some times in business there is only one who can do it, or you have already used the others and they fail. So I see the need sometimes not to take bids
@markknoller That is big, hum in our day and age it is not much. Women been working for a long time at top places. Good lord say something that matters.
@realDonaldTrump If you are really the veterans president, I need your help because the VA sure hasn't helped yet. They lost part of my files from the 70's when they switched to computer and I am terminal.

@DoDMilSpouse @SecondLady Well I am a disabled veteran who for five years have been fighting for my disability and still no luck after the VA loosing part of my medical records, now I am terminal with leukemia so much for the government caring about veterans.
@baldagronomist @swksfarmer good target for bow and arrow
@BetsyDeVosED Wouldn't be hard to solve we have so many veterans after service who don't do anything who could. Most service men retire around 40 years old. Very young men you could help.
Check out our new website at https://t.co/5qdM0DCl4x we are still working on it and fixing some mistakes but it's coming along pretty good. If you have any thoughts on it please let me know.
@HouseAgNews @ConawayTX11 @DanaPerino @dailybriefing That is because they are scared they will loose voters if they don't speak out.
@marne1 The people who are crossing the borders are not family's they are gang members and drug dealers they are animals and if you would have listen to his speech here you would have seen he was talking about a gang not every day illegal aliens. you are so full of hate its sad.
If you are a veteran don't waste your time going to see a congressman or a senator because all they will do is tell you where you already are in the process. I have been to two in Oklahoma no help at all.
@joelmachiela @CBSEveningNews @NewsOn6 @NRA First off I am a veteran who fought for there country, this only has to do with government trying to control people to get them to vote for them. The democrat party is known for this many years now since common core Americans think they are idiots.
@ksfarmboy We make a slow release cheaper then you can buy urea
@ksfarmboy Both of our studies from Texas AM show our dry mix did better then the top three today and used 1/3 the amount of nitrogen and only one trip in the field not two like the others
@CBSEveningNews @NewsOn6 Then they have no common since
@DonaldJTrumpJr Can I ask a favor, I am a disabled vet who for the last two years fought leukemia and now back to work could you share this link. I am looking for investors https://t.co/axUexLWpgq
@ksfarmboy I am building a fertilizer plant in Parsons Kansas after we are open if I sent you our dry mix free for 25 acres would you be interested in trying it.
@ksfarmboy Now you are in Kansas right, how many acres do you farm
@marne1 I don't have a problem with a bus, but I do have a problem if it has words all over it, just needs to have state of federal info on it. We do have way to many illegal aliens in our country who need to go.
@HouseAgNews @ScottWalker @SpeakerRyan Greet work guys
@Berblann now days you have to be careful on both internet and real life
So many sites post so many bad things and say our country is bad and the people. But I want you to think about this, in America we have over 300 million people in our our country and if 3 percent is bad then that's over 9 million bad folks but we have over 291 million good ones.
@flower_boho Not always true, your heart loves what your heart loves

Looking to buy a rotary dryer very large one all so need some 30-50 ft  augurs, three and 4 inch oil well pipe about 200 feet. stainless steel  tanks and steel tanks or bins. Packaging equipment and one 4-6 ton  forklift and 2 bobcat type bucket loaders.
@marne1 And anyone who says it's okay to let someone have more then ten rounds in a 22 rifle compared to assault rifle has never spoken to a police officer because more die from 22's then AR-15 because a vest don't stop 22 but will AR-15
@marne1 Who ever wrote this article is a idiot, because if you go to Alaska you will find more AR-15 then anywhere else reason is when it comes to hunting and survival AR-15 are easy to maintain in such ruff area.
@kate60456 @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump That's how it with them, I got out in 1981 after being hurt I walked on crutches for a year then used a cane for the next year. After I got out they did traction on my neck in Gainesville Florida VA hospital but 8 years of records are missing
@kate60456 @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Hiring a attorney is like getting two senators here from Oklahoma they talk a good game to your face but they do nothing but send you information you already know.
@kate60456 @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Its okay Kate, only reason I am venting is hoping it helps another veteran some day, I know for me it's to late.
@realDonaldTrump Sure wish you would take care of disabled vets, Iv'e been waiting five  years now on something that should have been handled in 1980's They  loose our medical records then no help. Now I am terminal will die  before they fix it.
@mike_pence @realDonaldTrump Sure wish they would take care of disabled vets, Iv'e been waiting five  years now on something that should have been handled in 1980's They  loose our medical records then no help. Now I am terminal will die  before they fix it.
@SecondLady @VP Sure wish they would take care of disabled vets, Iv'e been waiting five years now on something that should have been handled in 1980's They loose our medical records then no help. Now I am terminal will die before they fix it.
@marne1 But they have no idea of right and wrong, first church to split because of gay marriage.
@marne1 Do you ever know anything you are talking about or do you just talk to hear yourself. Because you know nothing about guns or hunting I can see that for sure.
Well things are looking good so far, start working with electrician Monday on how to wire the plant. Also going to see about moving more equipment there from Oklahoma. Still looking for a couple small investors.
@marne1 lol you must be drinking to much of their col-aide, first time in American history black Americans had a chance to see black heritage at work and he let them down. All he did in America was use the black people for votes like Clintons
@marne1 He still is better than Clinton who had sex in the White House, and Mrs. Clinton who stole more then you can count, or even Obama who tried destroying our country.
@adam_g_brown Thank you Adam
@JimInhofe @JohnBoozman Wish you did more to help Veterans then to just talk about it, because all you did for me was nothing. . So after five years now nothing, I will die before I ever get my disability since I am terminal.
We are starting to move to our new plant, this is a few pieces of equipment we will be taking.		https://t.co/xqoQG0f4xO
@amyjenson3 @KTULNews I got a story take on the VA, I am 60 year old veteran who has been fighting for five years to get a disability I should have got in 1981. Have went through two senators with no help from them either.
@adam_g_brown By chance you don't have any more do you, I'm own a fertilizer company in Kansas and we are building a new website and still need some new pictures for it. https://t.co/5qdM0DCl4x
@marne1 Actually Obama should have been jailed
@adam_g_brown Adam did you take this picture
@marne1 So when they were telling us all the great things that Obama was doing to our country they were telling the truth. And I suppose when Clinton's stole 80 million from Hatti and they said he was helping them it was the truth to.
@marne1 Listen a lot of these people coming in are drug dealers and gun dealers, most don't have kids here, go to southern California or South Texas and you can't even walk along the border without getting mugged or shot at.
Can everyone do me a favor we lost one of our investors can you share this for me. https://t.co/axUexLWpgq
@JimInhofe After dealing with the Va for the last five years with and them losing part of my medical records about my disability  and two different senators from Oklahoma. I don't trust anything our government or politicians say.

@DeborahForeman That's what tuff about living in west to northwest United States, even though I worked building the restaurants on the Disney Cruise Lineit's cheaper to live out here in Oklahoma.  Plus taxes are hardly nothing here. You can still buy 100 acres of land for 600  a acre.
We added a new contact box to our website so people can just type in a  message and it comes straight to us. Still looking for a couple small  investors all so. 		https://t.co/bFpB3pTwfW
@marne1 I don't  think he did since California wouldn't show there vote counts.
@newson6wxguy @NewsOn6 Hey its a blessing don't egg them on lol
@marne1 Our school system has forgot that some kids don't want college because they work with there hands. When we take away shop classes the arts and band we take away other chances they have in life.
@marne1 Our education makes no since my son in the 7th grade came home with math and asked for my help. After three hours trying to solve a problem, I ended up not only not solving it but couldn't find a reason why you should. Visiting with teacher she couldn't figure it out either.
@GroganontheGO @NewsOn6 Use to have one of those as a pet when I was a kid. Kept it for two years till game warden came and took him.
We are so excited to have our website started and up here is a preview of it.		https://t.co/cIcqKRgwd4
@tulsaworld Then our state has became a home for idiots instead of smart thinking normal folks.

@coachbhill I just wish kids wouldn't get passed just because they play sports, over the years have seen so many in college who couldn't do simple math let alone algebra. Because once they get to pro ball and after retired a lot are flat broke.
@MelissaRooker Big problem is telling all schools to do or act the same way, this I see as the biggest problem, because not all schools have the same problems when it comes to teaching. You go into one area and parents are educated and spend time with there kids and then others areas that don't
Hey guys look at this.		https://t.co/za99waxXjG
@MelissaRooker Biggest problems I see in schools after being on a school board is  state and Federal government who try to control local town schools  without having no ideas what they really need. When it comes to state  testing, or discipline of students they really have no idea.
@POTUS when can they fix the VA, because I am a disabled veteran who after 37 years haven't got the disability I deserve. Got out of service 1981 on crutches They lost my records from April 1981 to 1985. I get nothing for it because they lost records switching over to computer.
First of its kind Fertilizer Plant being built in Parson Kansas https://t.co/DoifNgPJzj
Building new fertilizer plant in Parsons Kansas, Looking for a few investors below you will see where we are at in this process.
@tulsaworld Who really cares. I am a disabled veteran they have helped me not at all. Its a bunch of crap that they say they are helping veterans, there idea of help is they write a letter asking VA whats up with your case then they tell you something we already knew four years still no help
@DeborahForeman Long time no see Merry Christmas hope all is well
Depends on where you live, because shooting six coyotes in our area is needed because they run in packs of fifty or more sometimes. https://t.co/oG14RlCI1S
