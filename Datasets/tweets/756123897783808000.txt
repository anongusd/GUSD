This is why I have invited Leon W. Russell, Chair of the @NAACP Nat’l Board of Directors to be my guest to the #SOTU today. The NAACP is tackling the #climatecrisis as a human &amp; civil rights issue because so many of our neighbors are exposed to industrial and carbon pollution.

Meanwhile, our national security agency chiefs are saying that our election systems are being targeted. Russian intelligence indisputably used cyber espionage &amp; misinformation campaigns to help elect Trump in 2016.
Democrats are focused on increased infrastructure at our ports of entry, new technology to scan for drugs, weapons and detect unauthorized crossings, and hiring more personnel.
Also, they did not raise our southern border as an area of concern.  The more pressing concern is fixing our immigration system while providing modern border security that is smart and effective.
America’s top intelligence chiefs, including the Director of National Intelligence, CIA, &amp; FBI provided Congress w/ their annual assessment of nat'l security. It was striking, but not surprising, that they advised that Russia &amp; China are attempting to influence the 2020 election.

(3/4) FL could join vast majority of states &amp; expand Medicaid if we elect @AndrewGillum.  We could bring our tax dollars home for a change rather than send them to other states! @NelsonForSenate has strengthened Medicare &amp; fought to protect our neighbors who rely on Medicaid. 👏
(2/4)There are stark differences between #Democrats and #Republicans on health care. Ron DeSantis voted time and time again to end protections for preexisting conditions and Rick Scott consistently refused to expand Medicaid for #Florida families. 😡
