For years, China has employed illegal trade practices that have driven jobs out of America and hurt our workers. The President is right – we must protect our workers by making fair trade a priority #SOTU
We cannot settle for anything less than full operational control of our borders. It is imperative that we provide our border security agents with the tools necessary to succeed: a physical barrier, more agents, and better technology
Knowing who and what is coming across our borders is essential to the safety and security of our nation. Congress must work with the President to pass legislation that will fully secure our borders #SOTU
