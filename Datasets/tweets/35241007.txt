@cindyk2710 @brithume They didn't tell the courts that the opposition paid for it on a political opponent. Also this proves that the without the dossier a warrant would not have been granted.  Andrew McCabe said so himself.
@FoxNews @POTUS Do it Mr President! #VoteRed2018
@marklutchman Why does he have to consider it? It should be a no brainer!
@cindyk2710 @brithume What is it you democrats see? The evidence is right there in this article. You are still in denial. Poor People!  Your hatred for the President overrides common sense.
@RandPaul Thank you Senator! Should have been done long ago. #revokeclearance
@KayaJones I love it!
@brookie222222 @skins7810 @UROCKlive1 @realDonaldTrump Then answer the question.  Why was the warrant denied three times before they invented the dossier? Guilty until proven innocent?  That is the kind of lawyer you Are? Pitiful! #MAGA
@ballas_mitchell @FoxNews What exactly are those charges? I would think Mueller would be all over that.
@SenBlumenthal You are a liar!  It proves the total opposite and any smart American can see that! #MAGA

@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Obama knew before him and did nothing. He thought Hillary was going to win. The whole investigation is a hoax and with people like Tom fighting for the truth, it will come out.
@sean_spicier She is dumber than a box of rocks and she is the Democrats rockstar.  Should be an easy win in 2020. #MAGA
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Can't the President declassify every doc that you and the Freedom Caucus are wanting? If he wants the truth out there, maybe he should

@foxandfriends @RepKevinYoder Why did Justin Amash vote to do away with ICE?  He is Republican,  right?
@RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 And she is who the Dems are hanging their hopes on!
I wonder if the Democrats subpoenaed Bill Clinton's translator when he met privately with Putin at Putin's home.
@marklutchman How can they get away with that?  That's ridiculous.  And they are freaking over Facebook running a few Russian ads.
