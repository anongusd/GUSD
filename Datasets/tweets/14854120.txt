@67jewelCDH I think about this every day. And I’ve yet to come up with an answer.
@StaceyCKs1 @MKGenest You should see what he’s done for cheeseburgers. . . and there exists no exceptions.
@MKGenest Go West - King of Wishful Thinking
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Your “evidence” is that Kamala and Cory are black and Bernie isn’t. THEY might sway me but it’ll be in spite of you and not because of you that they do. I’m open to both. But if the election were tomorrow, sorry, Bernie is my man in the PA primary.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 He’s been to every state. He has people in each. He has an email and text list bigger than anyone else running. He has way more money. He has a strategy that’s proven competitive against a far bigger name than any running alongside him. These are facts. He CAN absolutely win.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 You say he can’t win and you’re sure and I just outlined how and why you could easily be wrong. With concrete factors that you’ve given no answer for. How do you out-raise him? How do you best his ground game? When will you admit there exists no answer in topping his experience?
@StephenHotHands @fras99 If Iowa and New Hampshire were tomorrow, Bernie would win both. From there, you can’t ignore the power of momentum. He already has a cache of cash and early wins could snowball that. He has reach and databases and organization so far completely outmatched by all running against.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 There’s no favorite on this day, the 1st of March, AD 2019. That wasn’t true in March of 2015 when 85% of the country didn’t know who Bernie was. He needs no introductions today. He has nobody so far ahead of him as to face insurmountable odds. I’ve shown you tangible. You ignore
@StephenHotHands @fras99 The first handful of primaries are pretty ghostly white. And plenty of black votes have, more than once, turned out to deliver white-haired white men to the ticket followed by the Oval Office. It’s all in the pages of history my friend. And Bernie polls well with black voters.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Not so simple. He doesn’t have to. Trump did that leg work for him. Trump, just by being his predictable self, has given every Democrat a reason to turn out, including every color of the rainbow and those who hold rainbows in high regard. Momentum speaks.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Add: he has more experience. He fits the mold of those new blue faces that tipped the house. I say Bernie is a contender because of things I can see and recent history I can point to. I ask for the same tangible things when hearing you out how you have come to believe otherwise.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 The part I want you to say is why you believe this. My opinion that he can and currently leads the pack is founded logically and scientifically. He has more money. He has better organization. He’s able to be passed. He hasn’t YET been. These elements matter.
@espn @btsteelcurtain @LeVeonBell I’d like him to consult with his left fielder first.
RT @SocialPowerOne1: Congress to White House: Hand over records on Kushner clearance — now https://t.co/p8Br8uRlzI
@StephenHotHands @fras99 *giving
@StephenHotHands @fras99 That’s the credit you’re not given him. Your pretense that he can’t win is an opinion loosely based and in the same mold as my very own wrong one that wrote off Trump on the other side. I’ve learned. You should follow suit.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Bernie is plenty capable of winning the primaries. He’s already gotten more primary votes to his credit to prove it than any you’ve mentioned and given the pants suit lady will be sitting this one out, they must all be taken from him. He’s the man to beat in other words.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 one by one. And if we were smart, we’d weed out those that simply can’t beat him. Bernie CAN beat him. That isn’t true of all of the rest you’ve named yet. This race will he one of endurance. Don’t prematurely crown your favorite sprinter to run our important marathon.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 And it is neither a “straw man” argument, nor a fallacy. Odds are the winner of the nomination will face Trump. He has straw hair and it’s up for debate whether he’s a man, but we have to believe he’ll be the opponent. So it’s only fair that we look at every candidate against him
@StephenHotHands @fras99 We’ll soon see which are, in fact, viable, but you’ve put the cart ahead of the horse to suggest any you’ve named have already passed him by.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Their war chests suggest otherwise in comparison to his. The same goes for their campaign infrastructure.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 I don’t see it that way. Bernie vs. Trump. Who do you pick? Cowardly would be not answering. Those who might favor your line of thinking in our back and forth should know the answer to that to know whether you deserve to be taken seriously.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 He appeals to independents. He can beat Donald Trump. His platform is shared, at the core, by the entirety of freshmen who overtook the House in dramatic fashion and re-installed Pelosi as Speaker. For all the credit you fail to give him, you’re missing what continues to deliver.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Maybe he will. If that’s all it’d take to change your position, you’re missing the forest for the trees. He’s the same man regardless. He votes with Dems. He campaigns with and for Dems. He has adapted the Dems platform to match his own more closely. He raises money from Dems.
@MyBlingRoom @funder And while we’re at it, how about a #CanDeVos?
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Independent voters swing elections. His actions prove him Democrat enough for me. If you value winning the same way I do, we’ll vote alike if and when he’s the last Dem standing.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 If you want to call me uninformed, debate me. I don’t have Bernie’s brass but I’ll surprise you. I understand the history and feel the current temperature of things better than you’ve just given me credit for. AOC is effectively the heartbeat of the party. Who she endorses wins.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 He’s voted with the Democrats for decades. For Bernie’s every belief, there’s a video of a similar-looking younger fellow echoing the same in the 1980’s with the same name, from the same state. I voted for Bernie and later Hillary in PA. I’ll do the same for this nominee.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 *claim
@StephenHotHands @fras99 I’ve heard that before. While I understand his obstacles, for you to write it off as impossible is short-sighted. I made the same clame regarding Trump in regards to the 2016 GOP primary. If anything, the added blue characters improve his chances more than they hurt them.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 Do you have any featuring Alice? Because until the old man stops mopping the floor on fundraising, he’ll continue to be the only candidate worth considering. While both Kamala and Cory are individuals I’d absolutely love to vote for some day, they’ll have to show me a bit more.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 And I’m referring to Trump resigning, not Bernie. There’s no quit in him. And I’d put the odds of Trump calling it quits in 2019 at a coin flip. #MuellerTime can’t come soon enough.
@StephenHotHands @fras99 You want a fresh face and an age-lift. We all do. But Bernie has infrastructure, promises infrastructure, is out-raising the pack by leaps and bounds, and polls very, very well against Donald Trump. So unless or until he resigns, that, my friend, checks all the logical boxes.
@realDonaldTrump Shove your sympathy up your ass. You had a platform with which you could’ve made a statement decrying the murderous regime and you puckered up and kissed some Kim ass and retreated, tail tucked, back to the America you, rest assured, haven’t made an ounce greater. #Resign
@fras99 Thus far and for a good, long while now, I #FeelTheBern. My ears and mind are open to any of the others to woo, but so far, and it is early, none have pulled their chin over his bar. He’s consistent and he’s being cloned. We took the House with his doppelgängers. Success speaks.
@Voteforthefrig @BisLaughing @thomaskaine5 I grew up in a town called DuBois. Most would pronounce like the French (du-bwah). The family it was named after didn’t. (Doo-boyz). Residents too.

@TDPattillo @PutinOwnsBLOTUS If the questioned is reduced or reworded to “Are more people experiencing prosperity under Trump?” it’s a hard and fast “No!” to anybody outside the bubble. Just remember there are sectors he’s massaged that are in an artificial climb.
@TDPattillo @PutinOwnsBLOTUS The same goes for tax returns which have even more moving parts. Many with very basic returns are seeing more simply as a result of the standard deduction doubling. Or a change in income or just filling out the W4 can create the perception it is better than otherwise.

@MaggieDog01 @westgate55 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica And if 4 million more votes is a landslide, then Hillary won the popular vote vs. Trump in a landslide. Except she didn’t and that’s not what constitutes or defines a landslide. It’s a model of an exaggeration and a demonstration of not understanding the term you wield.
@MaggieDog01 @westgate55 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Believable by anyone unfamiliar with what defines a landslide and exactly nobody that does.
@speerwerfer @westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Then we likely voted alike. But if you think the manner in which the primary was conducted and reported was fair, I’m afraid that’s a bridge too far. Many did Bernie dirty. DWS, Donna, the entire DNC, the media, especially CNN, etc. It wasn’t a fair fight. It CAUSED Trump voters.
@westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica You’re impersonating a broken record.
@MaggieDog01 @westgate55 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica They reported them as probable for one and separately from the rest. On protocol. This changed in 2016 and they were counted as if they had already voted. Yet. . . they hadn’t.
@speerwerfer @westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica It isn’t that simple. Your point relies on a flaw/fault. The superdelegates DO have a tendency. And it’s to award themselves to the candidate who scores the most delegates in the competition. Just like Obama, who at that time in comparison to Hillary was hardly yet a fixture.
@westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica You can make and win that argument. Obama vs. Hillary was closer than Hillary vs. Bernie. I can dig it. But the superdelegates SHIFTED from Hillary to Obama as he began to edge her. And they were reported the proper way vs. in 2016.
@MaggieDog01 @westgate55 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica If you think Sanders lost by a landslide in the 2016 primary then you don’t know what a landslide IS. . . and are akin to Trump supporters making the same claim equal in ridiculousness.
@westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Results is the key word. Reporting superdelegates as if they had voted before having voted is. . . spin. Tantamount to favoritism. Unfair. And that’s how it went down.

@westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica How many of those defeats were BECAUSE the delegates counts being reported were skewed and he looked further behind than he was? That’s a harder thing to put into words. But context matters.

@MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Horseshit
@pecunium Except he’s the only one who has been primarily identified as an Independent. He can reach across the aisle. He’s crafty. In a divided America it may take an independent to accomplish a lot. Who can part with a strict ideology better to pass legislation against obstructionists?
@pecunium @AaronDunlap72 @notcapnamerica His movement stemming from his candidacy in 2016 changed the party platform for the better and the momentum he’s responsible for flipped the House in the recent mid terms.
@westgate55 @MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica If you prematurely counted the superdelegates who hadn’t yet voted and weren’t officially committed. But among those that were legitimate in real time she was a neck ahead in a very tight race.
@pecunium Show me another Vermont Senator with ANY bills to their credit or a tenure as long and go back all 200+ years as you research.
@pecunium Maybe poor politicking if he were the Senator from New York. But he is the Senator from Vermont, America’s whitest and second tiniest state.
@Eedwardsellis @westgate55 @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I’ll boil it down. Bernie has been a supporter of civil rights through this entire adult life and has the track record to affirm. He wasn’t MLK or Medger Evers. He was a tiny white voice with little fanfare. But he wasn’t on the sidelines.
@sukatra @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica Weaponize whatever you like. I’m nobody from nowhere. I pointed out a reality of our history that can’t be refuted. Some of those who replied as if I was referencing present day and went on their tangent. Have fun with it, but it isn’t what I conveyed and it isn’t who I am.
@MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica For every line he said on the trail in 2016, there could be found a 30 year older video of him saying exactly the same way back when.
@MaggieDog01 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Tell me another fairy tale. Hillary Clinton is a brutal warrior. If you think she left grenades on the table you don’t know her very well. He’s been vetted and he always comes out as the most sincere and consistent stalwarts on his every stance.
@chezguyg One in 5 dollars of the budget goes to defense. Show me any other country with this level of commitment. Many are left out of plenty as this bloat continues to swim along unquestioned since Eisenhower’s last speech in office.
@chutry @ShinySquirrel99 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica That’s the right reply. And I will likely vote for Bernie in the primary but I’m not yet a lock. Mind is still open as I hear the others out. But this excerpt must be sourced as we’ve both now pointed out.
@ShinySquirrel99 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica What’s that excerpt from?
@RosemaryMcL @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica Observing that African American schools were neglected from the turn of the century through the late 1980’s isn’t showing a color. It’s understanding the timeline. It took work. Work not yet complete to ALMOST close the gap. Almost.
@sukatra @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica A real bigot might be offended. You’re either confused or don’t know the meaning of the word.
@monabay1515 @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica To put it mildly.
@TwinCitiesChick @notcapnamerica I’ve explained why. If you missed the lesson go back and reread it.
@TwinCitiesChick @notcapnamerica Still crap. Sorry.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica What I’m certain of is that if we laid our political beliefs on the table and put them in two jars we’d fill up the first jar before the first entry touched the bottom of the other. But you’re too die hard Kamala to see it. Me having an open mind about her isn’t enough for you.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica The enemy of my enemy is my friend. It’s thousands of years old but no less true today. You’re fighting a battle against an ally instead of focusing on the task at hand.
@KurtNiceHHL Agreed. And most of the best examples are in flyover states like Mississippi, West Virginia, etc. Poor socioeconomics created this and will again over and over until someone addresses and breaks the cycle. Betsy DeVos won’t do it for you. Bernie might.
@westgate55 @Eedwardsellis @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica So if I were a basketball fan in Boston who loved Larry Bird. . . I somehow would take a backseat to a player who shared the same admiration of a childhood idol? Of course there are those who did more. But of the dozens of candidates we’ll see who did nothing, why pick on Bernie?
@LexAlexander @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica History and statistics back me up. However many electoral votes the state of denial has, they can be safely awarded to you.
@Vocal_1 @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica And when policy decisions didn’t benefit or lift up the black communities who do you think had the least income to afford those property taxes? Black populations suffered most and some continue to to this very day. Only in the last 12 years have they begun to garner attention.
@LisaTalmadge @VABVOX @WeAretheMedia2 @notcapnamerica I don’t agree with your summation but it’s yours to make.
@brownone585 @lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Until someone steps up and convinced me otherwise. Biden. Kamala. Warren. Booker.
@brownone585 @lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Bernie 2020.
@JulieErick3 @LisaTalmadge @VABVOX @WeAretheMedia2 @notcapnamerica I wouldn’t categorize him as a trailblazer. He was ahead of other aging white folks who grew up surrounded by other white folks. He was present and on board and sympathetic to the plight of blacks when there was no political capital to be gained from it. Nothing more.
@Joyechippenham @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I have certificates of appreciation given to me by the Southern Poverty Law Center that suggest I’m not the threat to inequality that you’ve mistaken me for my misunderstanding one reply completely out of context.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Perhaps because he has an election to win and the elementary students can’t vote for him if they wanted to. That doesn’t mean he won’t prioritize them in due time.
@TwinCitiesChick @notcapnamerica That’s crap. While I’ll agree they’re both civil rights they’re also unique when it comes to public digestion of the concepts. Those not yet woke as to either weren’t awakened to each simultaneously.
@KaylaraOwl @notcapnamerica Couldn’t agree more. Did I give the impression they weren’t?  I was simply adding historical context as to the political climate as it pertained to the gay community 25ish years ago.
@LisaTalmadge @VABVOX @WeAretheMedia2 @notcapnamerica Don’t use a trailblazer as an example. Not only did that stance almost cost him Arkansas but it wasn’t shared in rural America at that time from sea to shining sea.
@SimianFriday @lyn_cade @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I won’t go that far but I’ll give you that she’ll be tasked with defending it. And I’ll absolutely hear her out. Christ, I just ordered one of her $30 shirts. I’m a fat white guy who lives in a community that’s conservative and 97% Caucasian.
@lyn_cade @SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I ultimately voted for the pants suit lady. Don’t lump me in with the “or bust” wingers. I recognize the single greatest threat to America as Trump and my vote goes to whoever looks to have the best case to beat him. I’ll settle if I have to to achieve this.
@SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I’m not. Your points aren’t just relevant, they’re predictable oppo attack points to which she’d better have good answers or will get skewered in the general if she makes it that far.
@sbaio_blcked_me @GlennCraven @ida_skibenes @imgrape2 @KamalaHarris Or he could best assist by beating some orange ass which polls suggest he’s the best equipped to do in his party dating back to the last election through today.
@existenceisjoy @SimianFriday @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I’m speaking as to my personal preference with what I know today. I’m not beholden to polling. I’ll leave that to populists like Steve Bannon’s Frankenstein.
@SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica They weren’t. At all. But they’re how a fine black woman survived and grew up in So Cal politics. And so long as that’s not her tomorrow, she’ll get my ear until I’ve heard enough. She isn’t my first choice but the door’s wide open for her to be my final choice.
@Gdex86 @JoshuaB77311058 @notcapnamerica He’s too aware to be shocked. He wants to improve it. Unlike many freshmen candidates, he knows what’s wrong. He’s lived through it. He doesn’t have to learn it. So he often comes off as someone who doesn’t listen enough. He’s passed that class. He wants elected to teach it now.
@existenceisjoy @SimianFriday @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I think you have her confused with Senator Warren. She’s the most progressive. But Kamala isn’t huge lengths behind.
@chezguyg @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica Couldn’t agree more. So he wants to take money blown on the military industrial complex and wars a half world away and bolster our education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
@kerryanderson @SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica You really believe he’s unauthentic?  You’re missing out. He’s the single most authentic candidate in my lifetime. On an absolute par with Obama. Minus the impossible to top charisma.
@DailyLibber @SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I’m not running for anything. No support sought. I support Bernie Sanders and all of a sudden it seems that makes me racist. I missed the memo explaining why.
@JoshuaB77311058 @Gdex86 @notcapnamerica And Gillum can wedge himself in there after the first two as well.
@JoshuaB77311058 @Gdex86 @notcapnamerica I donated to Gillum. Look it up. I live nowhere near Florida. He got fucked. He’s a rising star I hope to see as President one day. If I pick the 4 people in modern politics I hope to see as president before I’m a senior they’re Bernie, Booker, Beto, and Kamala in that order.
@lyn_cade @SimianFriday @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica This one isn’t. I’m happy Kamala is running. I hope to see her as President one day. I’m just not yet sure today is that day. But I want to see her in the oval. My January 27, 2019 preference is to see Bernie sworn in January 2021 but my mind is open to Kamala. Or Booker. Biden.
@VABVOX @notcapnamerica That’s a feather in his cap. He cared about black people when he had absolutely nothing to gain and Whitey to lose. But you’ve spun it craft-fully otherwise.
@SimianFriday @lyn_cade @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I plan to absolutely hear Kamala Harris out. And I may, in the end, decide she’s better than Bernie. My mind is open. But until she proves as much, he’s my guy. The only color I’ll never vote for is orange.
@SimianFriday @lyn_cade @existenceisjoy @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica There will be those that’ll say she latched on to some old balls to jump start her political career too and they’ll attack her with Willy (no pun intended). That’s shit. But it’ll be effective and the Trump crowd will beat it like a drum the same way they say “Pocahontas” unasham
@GlennCraven @sbaio_blcked_me @ida_skibenes @imgrape2 @KamalaHarris Not wanting someone to run is different than feeling they’re the most worthwhile candidate. There are days I am unsure whether Bernie should run again. It’s a lot to ask of him. But he’s my favorite out of the gate the day he announces.
@ABubblesCooper @Imfrommichigan @notcapnamerica I didn’t know anything about gays in the 1990’s as a ten through nineteen year old. I’ll bet I was in my early 20’s before I met and significantly interacted with the first person I was certain was gay. I’m from a small town from which those who grew up there and were gay moved.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I’m not racist. Furthest thing from it. Same as Bernie. While he may not appeal most at first glance to a number of black voting blocs, he shouldn’t be dismissed either. He’s actually polling significantly better today with POC than 2016, so much so that if he’d have won then.
@AnitaM86 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica And don’t we know better than to use crowd size to discuss anything? Trump has ruined that for everyone.
@AnitaM86 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica That sounds like someone who is off to a good start. It isn’t yet an inch towards the first mile Bernie blazed in 2016.
@AaronDunlap72 @notcapnamerica Besides his activism and participation, he was apolitical at that juncture in his life. I’ve read his book. Have you?
@OriginalKMF If you think that statement is racist you should reread it. Twice if necessary. And comb through the context.
@Trawler_Trash @notcapnamerica That depends I suppose on where you grew up.
@KDA531 @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica At the days end, in 2016 you had 3 candidates late into the game, none of which should have appealed more to black voters than Bernie Sanders. Yet, Obama endorsed Hillary. And the rest is history.
@GrumpyBurrito @fawfulfan And this was because it took decades for the wins of the civil rights movement to work their ways into the culture. It took decades and court battles just to cement desegregation—only for it to take steps backwards in my own lifetime (I’m 38).
@GrumpyBurrito @fawfulfan It was. 1989 saw black adults educated during the late 60’s and early 70’s who were lacking in attention from national politicians. It sported voters of color who were of less, sometimes low, information as compared to their modern day counterparts.
@fawfulfan Plenty. And they all had the same opinion. The Democratic candidates offered them more than Trump and his “What the hell fo you have to lose?!” wooing of them.
@kerryanderson @ShinySquirrel99 @notcapnamerica So what if he was? Maybe he didn’t feel above it though. Maybe he felt beneath it, as in a hill too steep until he opted to give it a try.
@Eedwardsellis @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica And we know it wasn’t for the politics because there weren’t a ton of black folks in Vermont at that time who were registered to vote to make for a target audience strategically. While VT wasn’t void of a black population it was below the national average. Wasn’t going to sway.
@Eedwardsellis @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Understood. He didn’t get injured enough for his presence to count for you. Doesn’t he get any brownie points for being bright white and going with a very unpopular opinion at that time? Maybe he wasn’t Bobby Kennedy but not for nothing, he stuck his neck out.
@garykellum Trump’s schools were plenty funded. His attitude is to blame for his educational shortcomings. But there are schools in rural and inner city areas today that aren’t, even in 2019 and the education isn’t yet equal. And that spans all races. Bernie wants to level that.
@fawfulfan One last time, I was talking about 30 years ago, the 60’s and early 70’s, not 2016 or today.
@fawfulfan 30 years ago, black school districts were nowhere close to where they are today. And some of those places absolutely had voters who were low information.
@fawfulfan My reference is historic. As in when Bernie’s political career began, not present day or 2016.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica If you think that observing the historical slow slope that historically predominantly black school districts have taken to achieve the same education as others is racist, it isn’t. It’s knowing history. Those places had children equally able but a tenth as funded.
@Gdex86 @JoshuaB77311058 @notcapnamerica So you can hear your group mentioned and charge him with pandering? I’ll let Bernie be Bernie. I’d ask you to hear him with an open mind and decide for yourself. Nothing more.
@dj1028_jean @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I believe he will. And you’re welcome to take my pulse. Not a bot.
@kerryanderson @BarackDaVote @notcapnamerica I’m a white ass man. I believe Bernie will govern effectively and well for all the colors of the rainbow.
@Gdex86 @notcapnamerica I’m not asking you to do anything. I’m telling you that I believe you can trust Bernie. What credence you give my sincere advice or what you do with it is for you to decide. But it is what it is. My belief.
@AnitaM86 @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica If you’re suggesting that Elizabeth Warren or Kamala are instantly better I disagree. They might well be but neither has run a national election. Neither have his length of experience. Neither has debated Hillary Clinton. Neither have proven widespread support yet. Yet.
@Imfrommichigan @stalag13G @notcapnamerica Are you suggesting Bernie used a more derogatory term? If not, we’re likely on the same page.
@kerryanderson @lyn_cade @notcapnamerica For every Barack Obama who climbed through and over a deck stacked against them a million more black men never did.
@lyn_cade @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Because without white people in power sympathetic to those rights they wouldn’t have been possible. People like the Kennedys and even Lyndon Johnson (though he may have done it purely for politics). And I’m not dictating. I opine Bernie is on your side and you’re free to disagree
@rgranata6944 @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Quick, name 46 states more powerful in Congress than Vermont. He’s voted with the Dems his whole career and supported plenty that did exactly that. And that’s plenty good enough for me.
@IJefTomI @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Debbie Wasserman Shultz didn’t join the unemployment line by happenstance. Donna gave Hillary the questions and admitted it. The resignations and confessions from the horse’s mouths are my credible source.
@IJefTomI @notcapnamerica So that’s what this is? You’re bitter about Hillary? I voted for her. Go after someone that didn’t. She wasn’t my first choice but she was the best choice left on the ballot in November.
@IJefTomI @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Kiss my incredible ass. If you can’t remember two years ago it’s not my job to teach you history. I’m right. My statements will survive your fact-checking. Hire someone else to do your homework or get yourself a tutor.
@Jaegersmomma @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I’m saying that Trump isn’t human. And that the worst of the Dems field will be better than Trump on his best day.
@IJefTomI @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I have to remind you that Hillary was given debate questions ahead of time and that other moves were made to alter the game mid stream?  Don’t you remember top DNC people removed from positions over this cheating?
@IJefTomI @speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I have to make a citation to tell you CNN and every network counted superdelegates before they voted for months and included them in the running tallies?
@speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica And I too will back the nominee just as I did in 2016.
@speerwerfer @kerryanderson @notcapnamerica I’m not sure. Will the DNC cheat against him again? Will the networks inappropriately and prematurely count superdelegates? Will he get a fair shot in a larger field? He deserves that shot. If a better candidate emerges, they’ll get my support. Until then, he’s the man to beat.
@notcapnamerica I’m not asking you to care. Bypassing cliche, my wife and I have among our closest friends, two gay couples, one of each sex. We have Muslim friends who are dear to us and I have a black friend who is like a brother from another mother. And if I didn’t think Bernie backed them, I
@lyn_cade @notcapnamerica I’ve got a sweet old man with the best heart that little birdies land beside to do that for me.
@kerryanderson @notcapnamerica His record is consistent and longer than any other’s. That it’s imperfect means he’s human. Two years into Trump and I’m ready for another human. Aren’t you?
@AaronDunlap72 @notcapnamerica He didn’t vote on slavery either, because that was also before his time in public office. And do you know how paisley white Vermont is? A good representative would focus first on what was most applicable to those in front of him. Bernie, even still, found time for minorities.
@kerryanderson @notcapnamerica Have YOU ever been arrested for fighting for the rights of a group to which you don’t even belong? Bernie has. And that’s plenty good enough for me. And it’s probably why he’s polling so much better among black voters.
@notcapnamerica 29 years ago I might have said the same if I thought a step in the right direction had a better chance of success and progress than attempting a leap that might leave the issue flat on its face.
@notcapnamerica And people only know better once they learn better. I wouldn’t punish someone for being late to come around. I’d be satisfied that he came around. And you will never know if his hesitation was political survival or whether it was what was in his heart. He’s right for America.
@notcapnamerica He was a hippie who believed government was spinning its wheels and ineffective and not representative. He lived as a young adult in a period where he was right on these assumptions and elected to be the change he wanted to see in the country and has been fighting ever since.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes You’re the world’s worst poker player. This screams you want him to run to help divide your competition. That’s the Trump way.
@sbaio_blcked_me @ida_skibenes @imgrape2 @KamalaHarris Except every study disagrees with that notion.
“You can’t trust the press.”  Did you ever notice that the only people who say this are failed journalists who have went on to become talking heads? They are to journalism what mall cops are to law enforcement. #FakeNews Media outside the main stream share the same mud puddle.
@klamb1953 @robreiner @godzilla_mama17 Is THAT what the Fox said? Or are you just in a Rush?  Aren’t you at all skeptical that the only people who say this are failed journalists that have went on to become talking heads? They are to journalism what mall cops are to law enforcement.
@ida_skibenes @imgrape2 @KamalaHarris I will support Bernie the same way while absolutely hearing Kamala out with an open mind.

@notcapnamerica In 1991, the word “gay” was used as an adjective for bad. Few understood the biology and chemistry and thought it was choosing to be different. Education takes time. So maybe he was a step behind with the LGBT community. He was decades ahead when it came to civil rights.

@siano2020 Absolutely. And he should be looked at as the man to beat. Consider it wasn’t long ago that Bernie Sanders was NECK and NECK with Clinton and polled much better than she vs. Trump nationally. Only with Superdelegates being counted prematurely did she appear winning at the half.
@TopRopeTravis @B52Malmet If Sarah Sanders doesn’t get kicked out in the end, this isn’t worth reading.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Is THAT what the Fox said or were you just in a Rush? Liar.
@Patrickesque @Selena_Adera He said “probably not” while citing the law and his immense support for it that already does that. While it reads as a little cold, how is he wrong? Court decisions based on the existing liberty will go much further than a law specific to and repetitive of this fine objective.
@MollyJongFast Did he now? ;) Is THAT what the Fox said? Gullible can be difficult to watch.
@TheWasBunny @ClistonBrown I supported and continue to support Bernie, but you can bet your ass I will absolutely hear Kamala out. She’s a fine candidate as well. We will soon see whether she can woo the support and manage the infrastructure of a national campaign.
@ClistonBrown You’re all alone there my friend. You don’t seem to recognize a solution when you see it.

@muellertime2019 @DisavowTrump20 @JimA050 @amyklobuchar @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @KamalaHarris And the Trojan Horse was a last-minute tactic. Bernie has voted with the Democrats for 30 years. We have no fear of loyalty to worry about with him.
@muellertime2019 @DisavowTrump20 @JimA050 @amyklobuchar @SenGillibrand @SenWarren @KamalaHarris This is a very near-sided way of thinking. If you have your finger on the pulse, Bernie might be an old man, but he’s the future. He’s what millennials will graduate to. We may or may not see him as President but we’ll eventually elect someone of his mold and that won’t be bad.
@TalbertSwan @LuxAngela @realDonaldTrump Trump took a break from the Gorilla Channel this morning to look at this tweet and pretend to read it, commenting, “I’ve always said David Spade was not funny.”

@lopiccan @emmailey Bingo.
@emmailey @rayray_rabbit I don’t think he did. Quite the opposite. He was better suited to beat Trump. He was competing too well while dragging anchors and being cheated against. He’s the hope we lost. I respect Hillary Clinton, but the DNC and her campaign didn’t allow him to compete in a fair way.
@JoshB412 @Cupcake_Fury @Dejan_Kovacevic For THIS organization that’s relevant, lol. Maybe he is a HOF manager given what he’s produced with so little.

@jeffmason1 I wouldn’t say without ANY evidence. He’s been trafficking women for quite some time so he has some knowledge of this. He’s probably thinking about how many he’s personally responsible for and extrapolating. ;)
@Steel_Curtain4 Straight off their couches.
@Steel_Curtain4 Well, working within a salary cap, if Brown were to leave, the Steelers might be able to afford 2019’s trio of JuJu, Nate Washington, and Randle El. ;)
@kiwireportfeed This is like way back when when everyone’s grandma had a deep concern about kids wearing clean underwear “in case of a car crash”. In my head I always thought there was a better set of incentives to push for clean underwear. . . but I digress.

@godless_coconut @nytimes I’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, they need her just as much as she needs them and she has the seniority and the skill set.

@sutrofog @ambertamblyn That would be the scenario I referenced in which we don’t even have to vote.
@RB_0007 @KwikWarren He isn’t. Mitt Romney loves this country. He wouldn’t be bad for it. He’s the most distinguished and respectable Republican in Congress and while that is not a high bar, it bears repeating and acknowledging.
@KwikWarren Yeah. . . and?  If you told me that Romney would win the nomination, I’d absolutely consider him. I’d register Republican to help him in the primary. I agree with him almost never but I’d take him right now vs. Trump/Pence in a New York minute.
@godless_coconut @nytimes You’re like that player on Wheel of Fortune that is leading by tons and keeps spinning and spinning even when the average knuckle-dragger can solve—risking bankrupt and loss of turn with each needless yank.
@godless_coconut @nytimes And you think Nancy is a closet Republican?
@johncusack Thank you John. So sick of seeing the sanest, most consistent man in Congress called crazy and written off.
@walterowensgrpa @RudyGiuliani When did the Queen knight old Rudy? He took a distinguished, respectable career and put it in a blender. The guy married his cousin and dressed up as a lady almost as often as he disguised himself as an attorney and still he was a winner. Was. No longer. He’s looney toons.
@RudyGiuliani When your tailor finishes the measurements for your straight jacket, put it on and drift away.
@HillReporter @luapyelrab At some point one has to consider that someone who so often has to say “You’re fired.” is a shitty manager.
@godless_coconut @nytimes She’s an ally, not the enemy. If you want her out primary her and show you can beat her. Then you have a case for coming in as varsity.
@godless_coconut @nytimes The woman has never lost a floor vote and has forgotten more about politics than most incoming freshmen will ever come to learn. You don’t sideline your HOF QB because you drafted the most recent Heisman winner. You watch and learn and represent your constituents as best you can.
@SBSPestControl @fski3 @MarkMaddenX @steelers He’s the head coach, not the GM. And his record is two Super Bowl appearances and one win, a winning playoff record and a regular season line in which he’s won nearly 2 games to every one lost. His record is impressive and he can only coach those who elect to show up.
@godless_coconut @nytimes Patience.
@godless_coconut @nytimes That’s horseshit. Freshmen need to slow their role and not skip any rungs on the ladder.
@nytimes Once Mueller is done, instead of visiting the Oval, she’ll receive guests.
RT @bobgrove91: Lundqvist has now been chased in 6 of his last 13 starts vs. Pens, including playoffs.
@SBSPestControl @fski3 @MarkMaddenX @steelers I don’t even know how to translate that. For starters, BB doesn’t have six rings. Tomlin never coached Brady. No legitimate argument puts Ben in the top 5 all time.

@JasonLaCanfora I think you’re mis-using the word “reporting”. Reporting would mean you told us the when, the to whom, the method of delivery, etc. “it happened; I said so.” Is not reporting.
@ambertamblyn Re-check your history. Plenty of women have ruled this world throughout history.
@ambertamblyn How about Nancy Pelosi and we don’t even get to vote. That’ll warm us all up to the idea and we won’t even be upset about it with the Trump Crime Family in unflattering stripes.
@PaulZeise @USATODAY That’s rude, but like with any child. . . less so if you can believe he doesn’t understand the meaning.
@bobgrove91 Small world.
@Tomlin_Sense You win 2 of every 3 games you coach. You can be as cryptic as you like so long as that holds true.
@JTLovecraft @McMazzz @MarkMaddenX Tough to argue. Just didn’t know it was contagious. Maybe Harrison was Patient Zero.
@GeorgeTakei I wouldn’t even give him general anesthesia. He’s ordinary.
@daniel4missouri @814Pirates @MLB I love my Pirates, but that’s a reach my friend.
@Disco242 @McMazzz @MarkMaddenX I was referring to Brown. He got his pay. We’ll see if he gets it for week 17.
@McMazzz @MarkMaddenX He’s been paid and he’s under contract. He holds zero leverage. Since the Steelers have the dead cap space issue and he killed any return value in any potential trade, the Steelers can sit him and save over $1 million and he’s just stuck sitting on his aaa for a year. Dumb AB.
@fski3 @MarkMaddenX @steelers 2 Super Bowl appearances and 1 win. Wins 2 games for every 1 lost. 15 playoff appearances with a winning record. Head cases in the locker room year in and year out. Unless you build a dormitory onto Heinz Field and task him with tracking ankle monitors, Tomlin isn’t blameworthy.
@MarkMaddenX @steelers Uncle Fatty knows best. Who’s your pick to replace him? Is Fun &amp; Gun Spurrier white enough?
@henrique_veio @SteelVideos It isn’t.

@PLUTOAPLANET @ThePoniExpress 9.5
@ThePoniExpress Or they show up to camp ready to win a Super Bowl and you’re impersonating Chicken Little unnecessarily.
@PisstakeRhaiadr @ByKevinAllen The NHL does and that’s all that matters. It’s their league. It is a showcase of their talent. It’s a major event. It’s contracted. Same as an awards ceremony, etc.
@ByKevinAllen Absolutely. It promotes the league. The league drives the revenue that allows for the salary and it is in the contract. Sitting out is a disservice to the NHL as a whole and bad for PR—especially when you’re among those most featured as one of the key faces of the league. More.
@McMazzz @MarkMaddenX I don’t know how well any football team can fold paper but if it means that much to you I’m sure we can get it addressed.
@allan_bucher Thank you for your CONTINUED service to this nation, both in uniform with a rifle and without it via your QWERTY. I salute you and your entire family of patriots.

@MarkSimoneNY Because he shared it doesn’t mean he’s the leak. And too much of the dossier has come true or otherwise underwent confirmation than to call it phony. Quite a reach there—and a bit too convenient to blame the interned.
@MrDane1982 I don’t think Oprah’s security personnel would allow that to happen. ;)
@DKPghSports So unless someone has video of Brown exiting the stadium during the game, that’s off the table. I trust Tomlin and the brass to otherwise put a lid on this shitshow and be ready to rock and roll come day one at Latrobe. Without any aviatory landings.
@paulkrugman @WeAretheMedia2 You had me until you implied the GOP had a soul at its core.
@Tomlin_Sense @DKPghSports @dlolley_pgh @Dejan_Kovacevic @getgo He isn’t Plaxico or Martavis or Bell. Or Hunt or Lewis or Gonzalez. I can live with a ticket and a little broken furniture in exchange for the best hands in the NFL vs. $21M+ in dead cap space and no worthwhile return. He’s intense. We’ve dealt with far worse.
@mvukovcan @SteveRotstein @PghSportsNow @PGSportsNow Ain’t gonna’ lie—had to read it 4 times to make sense of it.
@WPC85 @funder What is how to get on a list for $200, Alex?”	That said, I’m in complete and utter agreement (and I’m not even a cow).
@SavoRPC @MedicChris13 @steelers If by “can’t win shit” you mean he wins nearly two games for each he loses and two Super Bowl berths and one win and 15 playoff games with a winning record, all at an extremely young age for a head coach. . . ALL COMING WITH a room full of head cases, then “sure”.
@spring_bo @MedicChris13 @steelers No way to prove you wrong absent Marty McFly but I disagree. Teams all over have had instant or near instant success with rookies at the helm.
@Tomlin_Sense @DKPghSports @dlolley_pgh @Dejan_Kovacevic @getgo Those financial reasons double as competitive reasons and asset management reasons. Dead cap space = no return without major sacrifice and his antics water down any potential return anyhow.
@DKPghSports @dlolley_pgh @Dejan_Kovacevic @getgo The best option is to kiss ass and trade him after a 100 yard, 2 TD game when he least expects it. . . or not at all. There aren’t any real options prior unless the commish puts him on the restricted list for a bit due to antics. The next CBA has to include more &amp; better options.
@JohnDreker Honusly, I can’t think of one. ;)
@RawStory Aunt Lydia is back at it.
@realDonaldTrump He got 1.1% more of Americans to vote for him in a losing cause than you did. . . in a loser clause—saved by the EC with some help from Mother Russia. You lost the popular vote. You got a smaller chunk than Mitt.  You don’t hold a candle to Mitt.
@NikkiHaley I’m crying for you on the inside. I mean, not really, but I don’t enjoy kicking people while they’re down. Maybe you can find the air strip where the Twitter brass is landing and stick your bony finger in their face.
@MAGAGirl15 Embarrassing poll there dudette.
@exBFF @GOPChairwoman #UncleIssues
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @WSJ On that we agree, but no way Pence was blind to everything. His installation and how it came to be is just as damning as the Trump/Russia collusion. The GOP forced him into the VP role the same way the Russians took advantage of Trump (like an ASSet compromised).

@MedicChris13 @JesseSanderson2 @steelers It’s a Pittsburgh thing. In my own words, it’s a blue-collar working stiff that decided one day in their twenties that they know what they know and needn’t learn anything new.

@unblock_list What blocklists
@funder It’s not out of the realm of possibility that Nancy Pelosi will be the president before the calendar concludes.
@EdKrassen It took me ten minutes to submit my answer. The delay came in trying to picture the expression on Hillary Clinton’s face at Nancy Pelosi’s inauguration.
@colin_dunlap Follow the money. Math says that AB is going nowhere. They’ll kiss and make up and he’ll remain the leagues best target. The Steelers have, with him, an undebatable top five offense. Focus the ENTIRE draft and offseason on the secondary and defense.
@GeorgeTakei Perhaps because 43 rich white men have had successful bids for the presidency and no woman ever has?  While it isn’t a fair reality, it’s certainly a fair question.
@realDonaldTrump If this were true (you said it so I’m even more confident it isn’t) then keep tapping that source Mr. President because the Congress that we the people elected to check you that starts tomorrow isn’t giving you any dinero. #RESIGN
@MedicChris13 @JesseSanderson2 @steelers Like I said, race may not factor into YOUR opinion about a Tomlin firing (that won’t happen) but I promise it is high among the consideration of countless yinzers who count themselves among Steelers fans. There are those who in 2019 STILL make the argument a black can’t QB.
@realDonaldTrump @BurghRambler909 Pretending you have the slightest influence over the price of gas is among the most ridiculous things you’ve ever said. And that’s quite the bar. What are you smocking? #RESIGN
@DKPghSports @DavidGolebiewsk Jake fans and Pens fans need to break out their voodoo dolls and take aim on Toronto’s Nylander. He’s the blue mirror image of Guentzel and held out and got payed bigly. So if he returns to form, he’s created the market and next asking price for dear Jake. And it is steep.
@DKPghSports @Dejan_Kovacevic @dlolley_pgh @getgo So what’s left is a player who as Hodge outlines needs to change. And change he will. While he has an ego he also has a brain. So look for artful representation to draft his apology blaming frustration and scapegoating Bell so the parties can kiss and make up. Calling it now.
@DKPghSports @Dejan_Kovacevic @dlolley_pgh @getgo For starters, he isn’t going anywhere. “The cap and dead space issue, combined with his antics, makes a return via trade impossible.” -Math
@PJLM @RWPUSA I could picture it. It’s like a flock of chickens racing to lay their heads beneath the cleaver.
@JesseSanderson2 @MedicChris13 @steelers Because Tomlin absolutely HAS performed well at his job. . . and race is among what’s left once you eliminate performance shortcomings from the conversation given they fail to exist.
@ThePoniExpress You can maim him for what he won’t do, but can you propose a viable and sensible solution for what he should do instead? Math says AB stays. No return fixes the dead cap issue. No replacement coach sans Cowher coming back is an upgrade. So what to do, what to do? Nothing works.
@RWPUSA Trump is inept. Pence isn’t. And that’s where we differ. I’d sooner leave the powerless invalid at the helm than someone actually capable of enacting a shitgenda.
@realDonaldTrump You should build a wall around the Crayola factory since every source you cite would die out without crayons.
RT @washingtonpost: Mitt Romney, who will be sworn into the Senate this week, writes an op-ed for The Post: 		Trump’s character falls short…
@realDonaldTrump I absolutely believe in TDS. That said, it only affects those named or legally attached to a Trump. 2019 will be your meltdown. You’ll forever regret the day you waved forward your exploratory committee to run as your power is stripped and your silver-spoon assets seized. #RESIGN
@Arctic__char @JeffFlake @GOP Makes you wonder how they re-polled the 16% trapped in a bomb shelter cut off from the outside world.
@JeffFlake It’s like the Twilight Zone when I find myself liking Jeff Flake tweets praising Mitt Romney.
@TimBenzPGH I’m not as sold that it can’t happen. Ultimately, every self-centered athlete has their “come to Jesus” moment when it hits them that they can’t put up numbers by themselves. At that point, they know they have to perform and either get real or decide they have enough money.
@parscale @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Do you really believe that horseshit or do you just collect a fee from Dave and Chuck for each nonsensical tweet? I didn’t and wouldn’t vote for him, but Mitt Romney loves America. Donald Trump loves Donald Trump.
@Serial_Tragedy @mmpadellan @siano2020 Me either; where can they be found?
@siano2020 What’s your theory as to causation?
@MedicChris13 @steelers If you look at his record and match it with those saying he should be fired, if you don’t list race as a factor skewing those nonsensical numbers then you’re turning a blind eye because it absolutely is. Kordell Stewart 2.0, Coach Edition.
@MedicChris13 @steelers Tomlin allows players and fans alike to assume a playoff bid because his record suggests it is a given. And until very lately Tomlin has managed the nearly impossible in focusing a team that has a lot of “me first” personalities and making them win.
@MedicChris13 @steelers *there. It’s possible race factors not whatsoever into YOU calling for Tomlin’s head, but you’re one individual. I hear it from bar stools and from places where I’m embarrassed to hear it said. Underachieving is Marvin Lewis. Tomlin has won a Super Bowl, appearing there twice.
@ggqt3 @lang51b Who are the assholes holding HER back? I’d fire them instantly.
@wiseoldwoman @DanRather @MM01793535 If they’re indicted simultaneously it’s over. Nancy would be crowned. Or. . . if collusion is proven, Pence steps down due to the illegitimacy of his office to preserve his political career.
@dvarney456 @The_Real_HB17 @MarkMaddenX I’m aftaid you’re wrong on the facts. Players are the absolute best judge of MVP. A leader motivates you to play your best by their presence and example. Obviously JuJu won the hearts of the locker room post-Bell-debacle and that’s what got this team up. What they say goes.
@MarkMaddenX What time of day do you begin drinking? You’re the biggest JuJu hater in the media. Now you’re passing the torch and completely forgetting the investment in Brown and fail to realize that the latest news would eliminate the chance of a worthwhile return. AB isn’t going anywhere.
@mlbtraderumors I love this signing.
@MedicChris13 @steelers Except he isn’t. He’s one of the top five coaches in the league and does it in Yinzerland where if you’re black and in a star position or one considered “brainy” that the racist base calls for your head despite logic. Pittsburgh has a poor history of support for black coaches.
@johnis44 @steelers Not gonna’ happen.
@steelers After this tweet, there’s no need for a presser. It already foreshadows the predictable. 1. Tomlin stays. 2. AB skates. 3. See you at Latrobe.
@davidaxelrod @SenWarren Offer your services and bring her across the finish line.
@DanRather @MM01793535 The odds are greater that Nancy Pelosi will be our first woman president. . . without the burden of having to run. And if that were to happen, she’d be the incumbent and Warren is no match.
@ddale8 Step 2: stop accepting advertising money from dark money or SuperPACs altogether. They might be able to raise it via Citizens United but I don’t think the networks are obligated to air anything they’re asked to.
@ddale8 Step 1: stop counting Superdelegates prematurely and announce totals, instead, as and only as they occur.
@DellDaleHartz @MarkMaddenX Step 1: know nothing about football. Step 2: Don’t let that stand in your way from emptying your fat wind bag.
@harvardplayer You’re most definitely wrong on the third point. Whether he’ll be removed from office is a different debate, but he’s technically already been impeached.

@TimotRice Tomlin isn’t going anywhere. Yinzers be damned.
@ErichZimny @colin_dunlap And other times you look around and realize Tomlin is one of the top four coaches in the league and you’re lucky to have him. It’s time to draft for the secondary, fire Joey Porter, and realize you missed the playoffs as a depleted team that was STILL capable of winning it all.
@Dejan_Kovacevic The right answer is “yes”, but they had a lot of help missing the playoffs. If Bill Cowher could teach Mike Tomlin a class on the game clock he’d be a top 3 coach in the league. He might be regardless.
@ErichZimny @colin_dunlap Maybe. Doesn’t make it the right call. Tomlin isn’t going anywhere.
@O_Danny_Boyy @Steigerworld @MarkMaddenX https://t.co/bfQk3DkclF
@MarkMaddenX Let’s pretend he didn’t. Does the 2018 incarnation of Boswell make the kick? Do the refs that saw and called multiple bogus phantom pass interference penalties get the coin toss right? What happens in that overtime? Of all there is to fault, you’ve put your crosshairs on JJSS.
@krassenstein It isn’t a reach to believe any of the above, but I first disliked Trump because he fails to pay driven, hard-working people who invested well in themselves. Stiffing contractors and ballooning debt and wringing the freebies dry by a strategy of frustration is deplorable.
@DanRather @lang51b Now it is the leader who lacks experience and knowhow. And those underlings most capable of bridging that ability gap are those quitting. The only people who continue to WANT to be led by Trump are the most ignorant and powerless among us.
@DanRather @lang51b Washington’s troops were un-trained and ill-equipped, but even without shoes in some cases, they wanted to work for him. They believed in him and left bloody footprints following him. Fast forward 241 years and the Cabinet has more turnover than a poorly-run fast food joint.

@realDonaldTrump That’s not happening Mr. President. You won’t see a wall as long as you live. You just lost the first part of Congress you needed for it, not that you had any luck when you controlled BOTH chambers either. Sad.

@random_atheist @PassTheSalty @ResistanceNOW77 I don’t know how you can use the word “allow” with a straight face given the DNC cheated against him. Bernie had better numbers against Trump. That’s not debatable. Had he gotten the nomination, we wouldn’t have had these 22 months worth of suffering.

@MzDIS @debiresistshate @DearAuntCrabby @SteveFM20 @realDonaldTrump And Grover Cleveland is 20. . . and 22. There have been 44 presidents. I suppose you could say they studied which of the same Grover Clevelands were better than himself. . . but that would seem rather corny, no?
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit So long as you’re not opposed to turkey or 🥔 we’ve established a common ground to save bloodshed. ;)
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit I had missed your use of the word. I was navigating the replies.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Negative. My use of “you’re” was correct each of the two times I used it. *Your (&lt;—correct usage) correction is made in error. I used the contraction meaning “you are” as grammar intended, properly.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit The car that led the race for one lap isn’t typically hailed in motor sports. This president is doing everything to put the USA car in park on pit row.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit For starters, it isn’t news. Setting goals and attaining them or falling short of them is. Crediting Trump with the economy is also a gross overstatement as it relates to his impact. The economy has been on the rise since 2010. We are ONE year into an economy with Trump residue.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit There’s a difference between “great” and “best ever”. Scotty Pippin was a great basketball player, but there are better than 100 players counted among his superiors. And wealth equality isn’t a false flag. It is a metric. You can count it. The middle class: shrunk. Poor: growing.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit These are the measures that have always been used to score an economy. I’m not mentioning these metrics willy nilly. The ONLY source that the current economy is the “best ever” is Trump. . . who even hedges himself while making the ridiculous claim.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit It isn’t. Growth is mediocre. Wage growth is subpar. Deficits can’t be ignored. Inequality is taking steps backwards. While the stock market is, undeniably, at a high, this economy cannot top the late 1990s or the extreme growth in parts of the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s. DEBT.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Is the economy booming? Have you watched the market lately? What are the mistakes that called for retraction?
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Trump holds a rally. It is reported on. Why the coverage? If it’s the crowd, why isn’t the hockey game in the same city with twice the attendance paid news? Why is a 3:AM tweet assisted by some drug that has no substance besides propaganda elevated just because celebrity made it?
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit If you’re on air and news breaks, you can opine on it. If you get on Twitter and claim that you broke it, you’re pretending to be a journalist. And a mistake made almost daily in Trump’s favor is coverage of his campaigning as if it qualifies as news. Time devoted to every tweet.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit I guess I don’t understand why you’ve given me this link. If it is to highlight that some happenings receive less coverage than others, that’s a product of time and its constraints and personnel and its limitations. When a hundred races happen together, the coverage will vary.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit If you “break news”, that’s journalism. If you opine about news that someone else broke, that’s opinion. So if he can’t admit his role and its limitations, that’s a problem. Journalists and the press have nothing to be ashamed of. Occasionally they get something wrong and correct
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Not at all. That conservative talk show host pretending to be a journalist is his mistake and the mistake of all those in his audience who believe him to be and the mistake of the network for not clearly spelling out that he isn’t a journalist.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit This would seem to indicate that Hannity believes he’s a journalist and masquerades as one. And I promise that a great many of those who tune into his show believe this too and aren’t told the difference. If he WAS a journalist, he’d have disclosed he had retained attorney Cohen
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Shep Smith told Time magazine that “some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining.” Hannity tweeted that Smith “is clueless about what we do every day” and that his show “breaks news daily.”
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit I’m afraid I’ll have to throw the bullshit flag and back your drive up ten yards.
@RonBrownstein We see who the new flake is.
@jackdoranjr @gatewaypundit Explain to me how and when they’ve ever lost it. Before you dig too deep, I’m talking about the PRESS.  Journalists. I’m not talking about opinion heads like Hannity and Limbaugh and Beck, etc. Journalists report. Good or bad, they deliver facts. And they’re needed more than ever
@gatewaypundit While the tradition is great, this administration is no laughing matter. It should be postponed until we have a leader who respects the job of the press. This is a man who waved forgiveness over a WaPo journalist being chopped to bits and thrown in a garden for fertilizer. End it
@noahphillips114 @DebbieSpillman @Joel_inPA @TorturedBucFan @steelcitystar @steelers @afan66 @mvp86hinesward And that says nothing at all about his yards after catch. Just as Ben is perhaps the best QB in NFL history after being touched by the opponent, Ward is in the highest elite company, a tiny group, among wide outs after contact.
@noahphillips114 @DebbieSpillman @Joel_inPA @TorturedBucFan @steelcitystar @steelers @afan66 @mvp86hinesward For an entire generation, Hines Ward was the best receiver not named Marvin Harrison. And he racked up 1,000-yard-season, one after another, all while being far shorter than his peers and the undisputed best blocker among them—as well as the best and most fearless across middle.
@debiresistshate @DearAuntCrabby @SteveFM20 @realDonaldTrump There have only been 44 presidents. Scratching my head how he managed to fall 1 below the total number of people.
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump I don’t dispute Trump has last place locked up. But I do question how he’s 45th on a list that can only possibly include 44 people. How does that happen?
@KellyanneConYou Given you could have couriered whatever for her on your broom, there remains no excuse for this behavior.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump He’s 44th among them though.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump You’d think such a group of experts would have uncovered there have only been 44. Hmph.

@MichaelAvenatti @Bakari_Sellers Couldn’t we white males just call out our white male friend’s stuck in a prior century on behalf of a superior candidate who happens to be black? It isn’t exactly ancient history to remember that’s exactly what had to come together to successfully elect Obama. Twice.
@Bakari_Sellers Splitting hairs, I think he recognized a perceived supremacy among the misguided. But the manner in which his words were delivered were far below what could be considered “articulate”.

@DKPghSports @TaylorHaasePGH Such a POS.
@zesty_leftwing Of course he should. Kavanaugh could be completely innocent and if no longer matters. Once he ranted that Clinton revenge and Trump outrage is why he waits for his seat, he became wholly partisan and DQed himself. It no longer matters whether he did as accused for job purposes.
@bryanbehar You’re right but it’s the wrong narrative. A majority of the Senate will vote to confirm a man who said he’s the victim of a conspiracy driven by Trump outrage and Clinton revenge—in favor of a man who is unquestionably partisan.
@ananavarro And I’m sorry I spelled your name incorrectly in my reply.
@ananavarro Don’t get caught up Anna. Once he named Democrats and suggested he was victimized because of Trump outrage and Clinton revenge, he outed himself as wholly partisan and disqualified himself whether guilty or innocent.
@kittens526 @ReneeHoagenson And if he knew himself to be innocent, then respect for them couldn’t be expected either. Problem is, only he and Dr. Ford can KNOW this. He defeated himself from consideration once he gave birth to a straw man that illustrate that he can’t fairly judge half the country.
@kittens526 @ReneeHoagenson In total fairness, and I think this is of the greatest importance, but if he did nothing like this, it wasn’t a “theory”. If he’s innocent, he would absolutely know it was a conspiracy. And THAT said, to allow the words to come out and suggest that. . . a disqualifier.

@mrhunt79 @MorinMoss @HermannKoum @nytimes If you think the searching and finding of these names and collecting them didn’t start well before the story broke them you’re in dreamland. So this hiccup was known by GOP leaders in advance of the accusation and its preparation began in advance too.
@mrhunt79 @MorinMoss @HermannKoum @nytimes Few doubt he’ll be confirmed. But suggesting this random woman is making up her story removes all doubt that you’re an asshole in present day.

@mjrdude @citizensonnet @MamalinaCaro @kevnmontana @Flowerp24392484 @BackBeat24 @SenSanders If they aren’t free on release, they’d likely have a hard time getting to the polls. I’m OK, to a point, for the incarcerated felon not voting. I’m not OK for the participating in society version being unable.
@mjrdude @citizensonnet @MamalinaCaro @kevnmontana @Flowerp24392484 @BackBeat24 @SenSanders I would argue that “legitimately” deleting felons is Jim Crow 2.0 in and of itself. If they’re free on release, society has deemed them a non-threat and society still has expectations of them. So to not allow their vote is disenfranchisement and takes away their representation.
@citizensonnet @MamalinaCaro @kevnmontana @mjrdude @Flowerp24392484 @BackBeat24 @SenSanders One example of the Jim Crow “2.0” is the deletion of registered voters from the rolls without cause and the closing of minority precincts to create huge lines that people often opt not to navigate.
@citizensonnet @MamalinaCaro @kevnmontana @mjrdude @Flowerp24392484 @BackBeat24 @SenSanders I mean in-person voter fraud doesn’t and hasn’t existed in reality and ID laws have a single goal—to keep people from voting. A study showed that in Pennsylvania the law would disenfranchise as many as 750,000 alone. And a Republican, Turazi, gleefully admitted as much.
@gregrej @tonyposnanski Fake news. She said “all of them”. ;)
@RepMarkMeadows @darkbeautiful77 While I may agree, Gorsuch lost all credibility with me when he accepted the nomination that was stolen politically in broad daylight from Merrick Garland.
@citizensonnet @MamalinaCaro @kevnmontana @mjrdude @Flowerp24392484 @BackBeat24 @SenSanders You mean it used to be. Before Gerrymandering, voter suppression, deleting droves of voters from the rolls, removing polling places to force impossible lines and otherwise deter particular voters from participating, etc. Add in the voter ID and other Jim Crow 2.0 for good measure
@Roadrunner19673 @BrunchPunch @sherryrudman1 @marie_cari44 @DragonForce_One @travisnichols @SenWarren Trump’s presidency will be over before his first term ends, maybe before this calendar year is complete.

@Israellycool @LauraLoomer How much did you donate to Laura’s McDoubles and gas money fund there moneybags?

@ASaunders_PGH @DYSTPittsburgh You can’t possibly tell me, straight-faced that a #8 batter isn’t going to see fewer strikes with the pitcher behind him? I don’t know anybody who’d dispute this.
@ASaunders_PGH @DYSTPittsburgh Do whatever you like with the studies. Pitchers have given interviews and said in plain English that they’ve had to go at so and so and trust their defense in hopes to record a final out so as to not face so and so on deck. In the NL it holds even more true as pitchers bat.
@sprintcare I’ve been on the phone with customer care about it. They won’t even give me the hardware to get better coverage at home. I had much better call quality with my old provider PagePlus, a CDMA prepaid provider. Corner of Stockton &amp; Superior, Grove City, PA.
@ASaunders_PGH @DYSTPittsburgh At the major league level, the batting order means an absolute great deal. The quality and frequency of good, hittable pitches can absolutely be affected, sometimes dramatically, by those before and behind you in the lineup.
@sprint Meanwhile your network is by far and away the absolute worst. I have the X. Too bad I can’t talk on it. It’s a great phone that I’d have better luck with styrofoam and a string.

@JackPosobiec @LauraLoomer That’s because one is real and the other is Bibi trying to force our hand to satisfy his own paranoia. His PowerPoint was a history lesson bent on accomplishing what he failed to when he addressed Congress. The timing is to get his wishes granted while it is still red and stupid.
@Adam_Majk Because while there will always be content, whether it is ever found or not, there will always have to be a place to harbor it.
@Adam_Majk Negative. Most of the web and its content is quite the opposite. Unseen and untrafficked. While coders make great platforms, average users stumble at getting their work seen. And it takes up space. Lots. For this reason you should advise your people to invest in good hosting cos.
@Adam_Majk And some sink and some swim and the majority just occupy space and time.
@Adam_Majk While that is true, it simultaneously isn’t. These coders create structure that, in and of itself, has the potential for widespread utilization and organic profit. They’re framers. What you decide to operate within your walls and under your roof is left up to the end user.
@jwwatson63 @funder Or as George Carlin would call it, “a near miss”.
@funder Too many letters.
@Adam_Majk The internet can’t be harnessed in this way in this country. And this isn’t me underestimating humans—it is giving them credit. And the majority of developers don’t have jobs. They freelance and work on their own terms. The people will forever migrate to where the top coders go.
@Adam_Majk If you believe that, that’s your primary mistake. The second it was nationalized, every Republican in the land would pull out the next day. And it’d lose every quality developer. It’d be the swiftest death possible. The only people left would be the ones who forget their password
@Adam_Majk Your vision seems limited to the dollars and sense of it all, but the reality is that people will move to ease of use and keep their social sharing in the private sector. And they’ll go where it is forever free, another reason I wouldn’t invest in Facebook stock.
@Adam_Majk Wrong again. If and when it would become nationalized, the coders would stop coding and take their balls and bats and go home. And the people will follow because the tech wherever they go will be superior. If nationalized, it’d become an instant pariah and an exodus would happen.
@DevilisRepublcn @PRyan For starters, the average Trump voter is either a soulless greedy bastard or stupid enough to believe the propaganda that the event you mention never happened. Take your pick.
@Adam_Majk Silly. It IS a monopoly. It is breakable if and only if it chooses to break. It doesn’t need to buy anything. It’s a magnet. They are drawn to it. They integrate TO it or fail. Any business without a free Facebook presence either has a spoon-fed market or is soon to fail.
@Adam_Majk I’ve made no argument. I’ve explained that you don’t understand the internet. And it isn’t mining when the miners bring what is being mined TO the mine. To summarize, Facebook is a superpower. Twitter is one of its most profitable parasites. Each serve different users.
@Nationals @Capitals That’s sweet. But try again.
@SeniorBoobies @Tahdahling @LauraLoomer Not at all, but I suspect I’m not the only thing in this world you have a great difficulty following.
@Adam_Majk What you’re failing to understand is that access to the masses allows Facebook a power that supersedes wealth. For that reason, I agree Twitter is a better play for average investors, but if Facebook WANTED to make their shareholders rich, they could do it with extreme ease.
@Adam_Majk The MySpace comparison demonstrates your lack of understanding in this department. Because of the total immersion it has over its users, Facebook has the highest potential of any stock traded. However, it’s core mission doesn’t seek to mine those caches. Returns will be minimal.
@Adam_Majk You couldn’t be more off. And I’m not an investor—at least not yet. I’m a web developer. I understand coding. Facebook has more programming potential and sustainability than Microsoft EVER had and it had a hell of a run. It’s stock will enrich few, but it isn’t going anywhere.
@Adam_Majk Stock viability notwithstanding, your summation of Facebook and its creation is a tick below elementary. The development platform of Facebook is second to none. And to compare it to Twitter is very much apples and oranges. The platform serves two different types of users.
@Tahdahling @SeniorBoobies @LauraLoomer The hours I DON’T work in a week likely number fewer than those you sleep.

@shanecglass @CDPGH @MattGajtka The regular season is a seeding and exclusionary contest to determine playoff brackets. Besides the attaboy trophy for coming out on top it is meaningless. By statistics and history, outside of Pittsburgh it isn’t a curse. But winning when it counts, if you could pick only one. .
@MKHunt1066 @LauraLoomer You attend a lot of mosques do you? Or, you can tell us, is that just what the Fox said?

@kovamitch_12 @Shesk305 @Starting9 Fictional or not, Rocky I, 2, 4, 5, Rocky Balboa, and Creed all featured victorious Philadelphia sports stars and fans winning something. And that is a MAJORITY of Philadelphia sports success stories so it HAS to be counted. ;) Until their third string QB won, the Eagles had 0.

@DeckTheCards @rtjr It’s possible. It’s more the principle, not a commercial for scalping.  If I could send them a message it would be that the line time my cheeks will touch their seats this year—the draw was a class act they dumped to save a buck.
@DeckTheCards @rtjr I’m aware. And I’m aware it was purchased whether I buy it or not. And I’m aware it is one fewer ticket sold vs. if I were to buy from the box office (this the point). I refuse to add to their ticket sales until they add winning to the roster and sustaining it to priorities.
@rtjr I’ll be there the day Cutch returns. Dressed in all black—my tickets straight from the sketchy fellow with the cardboard sign. I’ll exit, hopefully not alone, the moment his last plate appearance completes. I’ll buy my next ticket naturally once they commit to winning baseball.

@tonyposnanski Yes and no. It isn’t the whole answer, but removing the gun-free distinction and, with it, the confidence of a would-be shooter that he’s the only one armed is a step in the right direction. They want notoriety. Though not afraid to die, they likely fear dying early on.
@BeckeeSheffer @realhawkmash @BoomerCgrlcane @AlliInCali72 @cschwandt @barbtherock @quitewhimsical @adrycoolwit @Oprah If we drive on public roads and risk liability to others, sure. What’s your point?
@AlliInCali72 @realhawkmash @BeckeeSheffer @BoomerCgrlcane @cschwandt @barbtherock @quitewhimsical @adrycoolwit @Oprah I see it. And I see she can’t see it.
@marcorubio Tell me Marco, do you even know the difference between automatic, semiautomatic, and action weapons? If you’re not astute on that basic question, you’re not even qualified to speak on the issue.
@Jason_Shetler Glasnow. If he can’t perform to hype, the Pirates stand no chance of a quality season. If they’re to surprise, it’ll be he, Taillon, and Nova as the primary catalysts. He has the least expectations, therefore the greatest ceiling.
@dloy113 @gal755 @ShowMeRep2020 @Critterpap @jerweber @JoyAnnReid I never suggested it was a solution. I believe removing the confidence of no guns present is an improvement. As for the gravity of how I hold the security pros, the shootings continue despite them. . . so I have to be open to new ideas or revert to a past idea that had success.
@Bakari_Sellers Gun-free zones are sitting duck zones. A single new gun may never be even added but confidence would instantly be subtracted the second a would-be shooter has to consider the potential of return fire and missing their headlines if taken out early.
@Bakari_Sellers It’s not often we disagree. You don’t DISarm teachers. You don’t force any teachers or even pressure them. You let those who are willing to be trusted the same way they’d be trusted a block away at 5:PM. Those that want to, you train and allow them to deduct expenses.
@gal755 @ShowMeRep2020 @Critterpap @jerweber @JoyAnnReid You’re right. So I’m all ears for a better suggestion than the one he made. I don’t think there exists one but I’ll continue to root for it to come along.
@ShowMeRep2020 @Critterpap @jerweber @JoyAnnReid Agreed.
@ShowMeRep2020 @jerweber @JoyAnnReid I absolutely hate the Trump administration and I feel like most of his remaining supporters suffer some form of mental illness, but this guy who I might not agree with a single other point in the world is absolutely right.

@JoyAnnReid Even if the permission to allow the fit to arm themselves didn’t add a single gun to the school, just removing the confidence of the shooter that they won’t receive return fire is a step in the right direction.
@JoyAnnReid Arming nobody and hanging a sign that says as much is more worthy of your eye roll. I’m a snowflake who wouldn’t donate a drop of piss to put Trump out if he was afire, but sitting duck zones are stupid no matter whose idea it was. Allow trustworthy and willing personnel to arm.

@raul_579420 @bryanbehar I contend it is also common sense to restrict ownership from the mentally ill. . . and that allowing it is every bit as negligible as a parent allowing their children a gun.
@CodeinePiss_ @raul_579420 @bryanbehar I only ask because if you believe the parents who gave a loaded gun were culpable, why not also find a society that would allow firearms in the hands of the mentally ill?
@CodeinePiss_ @raul_579420 @bryanbehar So it’d be their fault?
@raul_579420 @bryanbehar The contention is that those that arm the disturbed or look the other way as they arm themselves are, themselves, complicit. . . or, at the very least, negligible.

@martymcflow @NHLPlayerSafety If the stat measures someone’s agility and toughness and determination, then a suspension shouldn’t snap the streak.

@KDPomp It literally underscores things when considering Ben threw 6 TD passes and one was scored a lateral and credited as a rushing TD.
@NCHurricane15 @ThePoniExpress That’s an interesting theory. Total crap, but a theory nonetheless.

@Steigerworld So while you’re doing your forensic accounting about how partisan players got to the stage, does it bother you in the least that a dirty old pervert pedophile is running for the US Senate out of Alabama? Deflect much?
@JillNull @LauraLoomer @RealAlexJones @infowars Riiiight. Because undocumented aliens show up on so many deeds.
@LauraLoomer @RealAlexJones @infowars When someone is just as bigoted as you, it doesn’t make them right. It just makes them a like-minded bigot.
@CNNPolitics He makes a great point. Not only is his judgment lacking, but there’s always been a MAGA magnet interfering with his moral compass. Add to that he’s mostly irrelevant and this becomes his lone statement I can trust.

@NerfHerder36 @TrinaLTalma @WalshFreedom But that the eyes of the rest of the country would open wide.
@NerfHerder36 @TrinaLTalma @WalshFreedom It makes perfect sense. This is arguably the first time in his career he is truly relevant outside of Alabama when those people sitting on this knowledge knew it would be dismissed by the good old boys club.

@clemfairie @Shartacular @bryanbehar Watch a circus once. Awe. Watch the same circus for two straight years. . . yawn. He’s flooded the attention span and comprehension dam of half the electorate. Your observation is accurate.
@bryanbehar @ealight461 If you mean, the right will yawn and look the other way despite what would otherwise be a bombshell, then yes. But an outspoken dullard has dulled their senses by being nonstop sensational (like most circuses if you traveled with and did nothing but watch the same one for years.)

@PolitiSearch @AwardsDaily @betseybess She may not of. But with more votes from Sanders’ supporters it would have proven harder to hack. I’m in the minority in that I voted HRC.
@PolitiSearch @AwardsDaily @betseybess Had she gone against Agent Orange after having beaten Sanders legitimately, she’d have beaten Trump by an ELECTORAL landslide.
@PolitiSearch @AwardsDaily @betseybess Singularly, no. Not only did she scorch him, but so did the DNC. And we have Trump because of that. She won popular vote absent Bern voters.
@PolitiSearch @AwardsDaily @betseybess She had my vote, but wrong is wrong. If she came out and said, yes, I burned Bernie; I’m sorry, I’d forgive. He polled better against Trump.
