A3 Health organizations like gyms are frequently inaccessible for people with ID due complicated admission forms and lack of fitness professional training on how to adapt certain activities for people with ID. #FoodFri
A3 Health communication materials are written in complicated or technical language with long sentences and words with many syllables.  #FoodFri
A3 Health care providers are not trained on how to work with patients with ID, resulting in undiagnosed issues. #FoodFri
RT @MomsRising: Q3 What are challenges people with intellectual and developmental disabilities face trying to be healthy? #FoodFri
A2 Special Olympics is the largest sporting organization in the world for people with ID. Special Olympics is creating a world where people with ID have the opportunity to be healthy. #FoodFri https://t.co/OjC3fyUOs8
A2 Approximately 6.5 million people in the United States have an intellectual disability. Approximately 1-3 percent of the global population has an intellectual disability ‚Äì as many as 200 million people. #FoodFri
A2 Intellectual disability (or ID) is a term used when a person has certain limitations in cognitive functioning and skills, including communication, social and self-care skills. #FoodFri
RT @MomsRising: Q2. What are intellectual and developmental disabilities? #FoodFri
@MomsRising A1 Making #inclusivehealth a reality for people with intellectual disabilities would reduce disparities, lower health care costs and ensure social justice. #FoodFri https://t.co/yPeKy7erXx
@MomsRising A1 #inclusivehealth is important because people with intellectual disabilities are at a high risk of chronic health problems, not because of their disability but because they have poor access to quality health services and programs. #FoodFri https://t.co/6bp3Q3YxoV
@MomsRising A1 #inclusivehealth is the inclusion of all people, including people with intellectual disabilities, in mainstream health policies, laws, programming, services, research, and funding streams. https://t.co/jxVfURQysz #FoodFri

These events, like many others taking place all over the world, thanks to the support of the @GolisanoFdn, all contribute to our goal of improving access to quality health for 11 million people with ID. A goal we refer to as #InclusiveHealth.
To help alleviate the health needs of our athletes in this region, a team of local physicians, health professionals &amp; students are volunteering to offer free health screenings &amp; education for all athletes at the IX @SOMENA68 Regional Games this week &amp; @WorldGamesAD 2019.
Among youth Special Olympics athletes in the MENA Region, 18% are overweight and 16% are obese; among adult Special Olympics athletes, 25% are overweight and 7% are obese.
Additionally, 38% have never had an eye exam, 9% have permanent hearing loss, and 75% have balance problems.
Among athletes in the Middle East/North Africa Region, 23% have mouth pain, 62% have untreated tooth decay, 36% are missing teeth, 63% have signs of gingivitis, and 25% need urgent attention from a dentist.
According to data compiled by Special Olympics in 2017, prevalence of certain health indicators among Special Olympics athletes in @SOMENA68 were higher compared to our athletes globally.
Despite severe need &amp; higher health risks, people w/ ID often lack access to quality health care and services. Special Olympics Health, made possible by the @GolisanoFdn, is fighting for a world where people with ID have the same opportunities &amp; right to be as healthy as others.
