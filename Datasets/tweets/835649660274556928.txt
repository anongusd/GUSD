That strain is authoritarian in essence, traditional, anti-American, and anti-European; it values religion and public submission. And more significant to today‚Äôs headlines, it is expansionist.
They draw on a long tradition of Russian imperial conservatism and, in particular, Eurasianism.
Whereas conservatives in those parts of the world are fearful of big government and put the individual first, Russian conservatives advocate for state power and see individuals as serving that state.
True to Putin‚Äôs insistence that Russia cannot be judged in Western terms, Putin‚Äôs new conservatism does not fit U.S. and European definitions. In fact, the main trait they share is opposition to liberalism.
