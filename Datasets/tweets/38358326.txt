Something needs to change. Ayton will likely be the #1 draft pick in the NBA. We don't know if he took any money but he will be fine. #SeanMiller will get $10 million if he gets fired. The victims: @UofA #Wildcat fans and other players. Not exactly fair. @APlayersProgram
For sure. Just waiting for the press conference. Pretty sure we know what will happen. Vacate this years wins. Coach Miller on administrative leave. Ayton no longer on the roster. No NCAA Tournament. Self imposed sanctions and then wait for the NCAA. https://t.co/AZk6Izo5W6
Can you at least tell us when the press conference is scheduled @APlayersProgram ? I have a Saturday to plan. Thanx.

Instead of a nothing burger for lunch I had a Lynch obstructed justice burger with side of Comey leaks! #Lordy
Oh #lordy Loretta Lynch has some 'splainin' to do!
Dow hits record high during #ComeyHearing Hahaha!  #MAGA trumps Trump investigation! #ComeyDay
Boom! Comey says he would expect any FBI agent to report if (s)he thought a felony was committed. #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
Comey reading so much body language and "looks" into President's meeting. That'll hold up in court! #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
RT @TomFitton: I'm looking forward to the follow up hearings featuring testimony from Bill Clinton, Loretta Lynch, Terry McAulliffe, etc.
Ms Harris wants to make a statement.  Shocking!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Comey hints Flynn may be suspected of lying to FBI!  Yikes!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
RT @adamhousley: But it was written as a serving FBI Director...again...this could end up being an issue https://t.co/UiayLxobqn
Manchin wins dumbest question: Would you have been fired if Clinton would have won? #WhoCares #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Comey obeyed Loretta Lynch's request to call Clinton investigation a "matter". Obstruction? #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Flynn request would have a chilling affect on FBI that's what we kept it so tight (until I leaked it of course) #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay
So far: Loretta Lynch obstructed justice, Comey leaked memo (a fireable offense or worse), Trump wanted investigation to continue. #ComeyDay
Why have a private hearing when it will all get leaked anyway?  #ComeyHearing #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay
Pressing question:  What did they have for dinner?!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
Comey leaked memo on Flynn conversation but was to afraid to confront President or report to AG. #ComeyDay #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing
If Comey is trying to walk a fine line he is failing the field sobriety test! #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
Comey, "My Mom told me..."  DRINK!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay
Subversive and insubordinate.  Fireable offenses!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyDay https://t.co/EHkuojusZx
Ask Comey if he felt his job was threatened by Lynch. He let Clinton off the hook after her downplay request! #ComeyDay #ComeyTestimony
Wyden trying to pull Pence into this.  Twofer impeachment Dem wet dream!  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Rubio is exposing what a joke these hearings are and Comey's contradictions. #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Comey stunned and weak. Didn't report "direction" to AG and didn't confront the President. #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Comey just used the word "direction"!  He's contradicting himself, but also giving the Dems and media the ammo they want. #ComeyHearing
Senator Feinstein regrets the witch hunt the Democrats and media are on.  #paraphrase #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
"Did the President instruct you to obstruct justice?"  "Not in his words, no"  But what about in his eyes?! #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing
My biggest takeaway so far is that Loretta Lynch tried to obstruct justice.  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
What did President Clinton whisper in Loretta Lynch's ear?  #ComeyTestimony #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
The President whispered sweet nothings in Comey's ear.  We have enough for impeachment!  #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Comey does impressions!  #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
We need Loretta Lynch hearings.  What at this point does it "matter"? #ComeyDay #ComeyHearing #LynchDay
DNC wasn't very concerned about being hacked.  Why should I be?  #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay
Not a question I can answer in an open session.  Drink!  #ComeyHearing #ComeyDay

Chris Wallace the class of the debate moderators this year.  #debate #debatenight
Of the two, Trump is my choice, but I don't know if he made the case well enough tonight or not. We'll know soon. #debate #debatenight
Hillary says she won't add to the debt.  Obama said the same thing. Trump's plan will shrink it! #growthepie #debate #debatenight
Trump is so right on jobs and Hillary is so wrong.  #debate #debatenight
Hillary is well aware.  So comforting  #debate  #debatenight
Trump: "on emails and so many other things". Cruz would be listing specific after specific. #debatenight is not Trump's strength. #debate
Undocumented immigrants pay Federal Income tax on SS #s from where??? #debate #debatenight
Boom!  Great point from Trump.  Give back the money from countries that throw gays off buildings, etc. #debate #debatenight
Clinton with so many distractions from real issues that Trump has handed her. #debate #debatenight
Hey Trump supporters. Imagine this debate with Cruz or Rubio. What have you done to the GOP?! #debate #debatenight
Bush's fault that Obama couldn't put people back to work in almost 8 years.  #debate #debatenight
Economic plan.  Hillary = more government and regulations.  Trump = less government and regulations.  #nobrainer #debate #debatenight
Hey Hillary, trickle down economics pulled us out of Carter's malaise. On steroids would be even better! #debate #debatenight
Clinton:  "Jobs Program".  Government doesn't create jobs.  Get regulations and taxes out of the way! #debate #debatenight
I'm feeling the same way I did after the first two debates.  Crap.  One of these two will be our next President.  #debate

Trump had a really good debate.  Will it make a difference?
Stupid.  Not a fair or important question.  Please.  Stop.  #debate #debate2016
Trump with a great answer on energy.  So great.  #debate #debate2016
Trump has all the best Supreme Court picks!  I'm not mocking or kidding.  He really does! #debate
Hillary is pro abortion.  No surprise. #debate
Community Reinvestment Act.  Expanded under the Clinton Administration.  That's what caused the crash of 2008.  #debate
Trump is so right about the Iran Deal and how that has empowered Iran and Russia. #debate
You hit the reset button with Russia Hillary.  You have no credibility on your Russia answer. #debate
Boom!  Hillary has been doing this for 30 years.  She talks but does nothing.  #debate
Trump is actually killing it tonight. #debate
Wow.  Hillary opens the door to hacking.  Gird your loins.  Her emails were so exposed!  #debate
Thankfully for Trump he is running against Hillary Clinton.  #debate
Hillary has bad judgement on our southern border.  #truethat #debate

Radical Islamic Terror is not Islamaphobia.  Thank you for that Trump.  #debate
Best performance yet by Trump #debate
Hey Hillary.  Pretty easy to start all over again on health insurance. So many great ideas that allow competition and capitalism. #debate
Trump on Obamacare bad.  My plan is great.  Competition!  He's right.  That's great! #debate
Obamacare is a disaster!  Trump rightly points out that Obamacare will never work.  Amen brother! #debate
Hillarycare.  Good luck  #debate
Trump is subdued, but doing much better than the first debate of putting words together. #debate
Hilary, "I take classified information very seriously"  Yeah riiight.  #debate
JAIL! #cagematch #debate
Audience now twice told to calm down after Trump answer but not yet on a Hillary answer.  #debate

Hillary is worse on women.  But will the people see it that way?  #debate
Trump sounds defeated.  Maybe he is.  #debate
I'm thinking I will soon enough https://t.co/HQ8ZNeTlIM
I hate to say it but Hill has a point on the way Trump talks about women.  #debate
Trump finally denies doing things he joked about on tape 11 years ago. #debate
ISIS is worser than "locker room talk" #debate
Off to a great start.  All in agreement! #debate

Struggle with balance of Faith and public policy question. Kaine picks death penalty. Pence picks abortion.  #VPDebate
Pence gets 30 seconds to respond and interrupted by Kaine twice! #VPDebate
Boom!  Pence on Clinton Foundation. #VPDebate
Kaine trying to argue context because he can't win on facts.  #VPDebate
Pence destroying Obama's and Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East and with Russia.  #VPDebate
Kaine says "gotta be tough on Russia". What is Hilary waiting for? She was Secretary of State right? #VPDebate
Pence killing it on the Iran Deal. Kaine trying to interrupt. Shocker! #VPDebate
Not sure who Kaine thinks he is swaying with his lame Trump taxes points. Best he's got I guess. #VPDebate
Moderator interrupted Kaine's interruption of Pence when he started talking about Hilary's email server. #VPDebate
Jimmy Carter said keep them out if they are Iranian Students, so there's that. #VPDebate
Kaine just interrupted his interruption of Pence with an interruption. #VPDebate
Pence hitting Hillary hard again on her failure to "secure America's hard fought gains" in Iraq. So true! #VPDebate
Bin Laden!  Wow.  How long do they think those coattails are? #VPDebate
Pence knows how to debate, has facts on his side, is a gentleman and not a socialist. Pretty easy to see who's winning. #VPDebate
Yes!  Make America Deplorable Again! #VPDebate
Kaine interrupts again.  What's the over under?  I'll take the over. #VPDebate
Kaine apparently has a lot of scar tissue, but learned nothing about Gun Free Zones after VT shooting. #VPDebate
Kaine's rudeness will be applauded by media as assertiveness. #VPDebate
Dems lie about privatization of S.S. Bush plan was always voluntary and small percentage.  Pence says rightly, "old scare tactic" #VPDebate
All Kaine has is beating the dead horse of Trump taxes. #noideas #VPDebate
Boom!  Pence making the exact right point about Trump paying taxes.  Of course he pays taxes!  #VPDebate
Wow.  Kaine is desperate.  Provides segue to moderator on Trump's taxes.  Non-issue.  #VPDebate
Pence with a flurry of shots.  Facts and his record vs. Hilary's.  Kaine counters with raising taxes and empty promises. #VPDebate
Pence please lead the GOP ticket.  Can we make that happen?!  #VPDebate
Pence hits Kaine with ISIS and lack of Clinton's leadership in Iraq.  So true!  #VPDebate
Can Pence move to the front of the ticket? or at least debate Hilary in Trumps place?  #VPDebate

So excited to get the new S7 that now I have to wait until Tuesday. @TMobile unable or just unwilling to fix it? Never preordering again!

Cruz on the history of Detroit. This is how he'll destroy Hillary in the debates. #GOPDebate

Bad call against Bengals. Way worse no call against Steelers. Burfict should be banned for his nonsense. I say Jets go to #Denver #PITvsCIN
No call against Shazier ridiculous. Burfict's hit was insane. He should be kicked out of football. Maybe Jets should go to Denver. #PITvsCIN
Burfict may have cost his coach and himself a job. What an A$$! #PITvsCIN
Cincinnati will have a lot of grievances to air next Festivus. Still, they gave it away in the end and a horrible hit by Burfict. #PITvsCIN
Pretty soon a hockey game will break out! #PITvsCIN
Holy Crap. That hit was wicked. More fines. #PITvsCIN
I matched one number. Thinkin' that should be worth at least $10-million. #justsayin #Powerball

To lift sanctions on #Iran is the same as funding terrorism, #NetanyahuSpeech implies, and it is so true.
Lifting sanctions on #Iran while it is a state sponsor of terror is lunacy. 		#NetanyahuSpeech
The President wants to "push back against terrorism in the region." If he lifts sanctions against Iran he will be funding it.
Obama: Sanctions haven't worked so let's make a deal. Hey Mr. President, Iran's proxies just took over Yemen! Wake up!
Iran is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. That should be enough not to lift sanctions until that behavior stops. Period.

@StephsBubble @devinbanez Great!  It'll be fun!  Lets plan on it and just figure out the when.
@StephsBubble @devinbanez Friday is out this week. I'll be in Dallas. Tomorrow is good, or next week? #BattenChat
THUNDER!  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @devinbanez M-F at 4:00 p.m. Tucson time (midnight for you).  Let me know. I think it would be interesting! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @devinbanez I thought about inviting you as a guest on the show, but it starts at midnight your time :-) #BattenChat
@devinbanez @StephsBubble See you guys. Have a great Monday! (it could happen) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Religion &amp; Politics are my favorite subjects, but God gave me an interest in weather so I can relate to people :-) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble I love the big rains.  Exciting! And I just love thunderstorms. #BattenChat #WeatherGeek
Flash Flood Watch here through tomorrow morning.  Hoping for some big storms!!! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall It's part of it. Social media via YouTube. The radio show is my favorite! Hoping for some interviews. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @cscoffeetime @battenhall Instant classic! #BattenChat
@battenhall I'll be shooting video in Dallas for work. Not sure you guys wanna see those. Very political :-) #BattenChat
@battenhall I will occasionally.  Maybe Vlogtober! #BattenChat
@ClarkLarsen1 Have a great Monday! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall No problem.  I should have asked for alternates :-) But I was busy as well so... #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall I was busy the Billie Jean day. That song really isn't in my range anyway :-) NOT doing the Macerena! #BattenChat
@battenhall I'm not sure why, but I haven't done well with the secret challenges. #BattenChat #PartyPooper
@TheRealFoodBlog @devinbanez Cool.  I might give it a go. #BattenChat
@devinbanez Sounds simple enough. I do my weatherman stuff again! #BattenChat
@devinbanez @TheRealFoodBlog Where is a good vlogtober calendar? #BattenChat
@devinbanez I'm gonna find a corner of the apartment and try it someday. Probably. Maybe. #BattenChat
@devinbanez @ClarkLarsen1 Don't!  It's probably the NSA... #BattenChat
@devinbanez @battenhall You have mad green screen skills! #BattenChat
@battenhall I vlogged one day with my Nexus 7 :-)  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @nancygh @TheRealFoodBlog @ClarkLarsen1 Downtown Friday and Saturday. Kids and Grandkids Sunday! #BattenChat
@nancygh @StephsBubble @TheRealFoodBlog @ClarkLarsen1 I'll be in Dallas Friday - Sunday. Might be good material actually. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @TheRealFoodBlog @ClarkLarsen1 @nancygh I'll try :-) #BattenChat
@TheRealFoodBlog @ClarkLarsen1 @StephsBubble @nancygh Super busy last week and I'll be out of town this weekend. I may be done! #BattenChat
@nancygh @StephsBubble @crgeek1 @devinbanez Some day I might have a DSLR :-)  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @nancygh @crgeek1 @devinbanez I like to put the hashtag on the screen, so even phone vlogs get run through iMovie. #BattenChat
@nancygh @StephsBubble @crgeek1 @devinbanez If I record on my desktop the quality is actually lower than my phone! Uploads either way are OK

@StephsBubble @nancygh @battenhall My friend has a Mini. Someday we are going to race.  Same horsepower as my Scion tC. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @nancygh @battenhall Minis are pretty cool.  I call them the Tardis cars because they are bigger on the inside. #BattenChat
@nancygh @battenhall Acuras are decent cars.  I'm hoping for something sporty!  #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff With the seat that folds up in the back that faces out the back window... #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff lol  With the wood paneling on the side???! #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff @battenhall If we can meet in the UK, I'm in!  #BattenChat
@battenhall ummm.  Who has the nicest car?  :-) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall It is pretty cool how we inspire each other from time to time.  #BattenChat
@battenhall I like to sing at the beginning.  It's "special" alright :-) #BattenChat
I literally cringe when someone ends a sentence with the word at.  At the end of the day it is what it is. #BattenChat #PetPeeves
@Katiesaurrr @StephsBubble Sunday's are bad for me.  I'm usually playing cards at friends. I made the first one.  It was fun! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @Lotsaboutstuff People who end sentences with the word "at".  Where you at?  Stop it!  :-) #BattenChat #PetPeeves
@StephsBubble @battenhall VEDA for the past two years has really helped!  The TV experience doesn't hurt :-)  #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff lol.  I used to tailgate way too much.  Thankfully I am over that!  #BattenChat
@battenhall I've been doing straight videos with no editing most days.  #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff My biggest pet peave is bad drivers.  Of course I am never one of those :-)  #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff Doing well.  Just edited a video for work.  Thinking about getting my cranky old man on for today's topic. #BattenChat
@nancygh @battenhall He really likes it there.  Says there is a lot to do.  #BattenChat

@AngelaSchans @StephsBubble Hi y'all.  I have done the monetization thing, but never tried annotations before or after.  Sorry.
I had no idea why some of you were complaining about YouTube uploading. Until now! 0% after 5 minutes. Like rolling blackouts. #BattenVEDA

@Lotsaboutstuff @PenPaperPad @nancygh @devinbanez I think 5 Guys might have them both beat. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @devinbanez @mikeshaw @nancygh I remember your vlog with your Dad there last year. Looked AMAZING! #BattenChat
@devinbanez Ah, now we are getting to the root of the problem. (if it is a problem) #BattenChat
@nancygh @devinbanez Whataburger is the Texas state chain restaurant. And Texas Roadhouse. #BattenChat
@devinbanez There are REAL local Mexican restaurants here. I guess I'm spoiled. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble One of my favorites! #BattenChat
@nancygh @devinbanez I'm not a Chipotle person either. Sushi and Whataburger on the other hand... LOVE that stuff! #BattenChat
@Lotsaboutstuff @PenPaperPad Yep.  @StephsBubble is building quite an empire! #BattenChat
@nancygh @Lotsaboutstuff Me three, but I guess I'm not as stressed about it. #BattenChat

Here's a sunset I took nearby with a Saguaro posing in it. #BattenChat http://t.co/RudqE3EYc7
@StephsBubble Sounds like a dangerous wardrobe change! They have sharp defenses :-) #BattenChat
@Bruno_Lucas_ Works great for me. Of course your individual milage may vary.  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Yes.  Saguaros are the cactus with the arms. They are also the Arizona state flower. #BattenChat
@Bruno_Lucas_ I use TweetDeck on the Chrome browser.  #BattenChat
@devinbanez It happens, but thankfully not to me!  ...so far. #BattenChat
@Macanonii @battenhall :-)  I'll never tell. Best bring plenty of water!  That's for sure. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Might as well take advantage. Saguaros only grow in this part of the world. #BattenChat
@battenhall Solid labor for me this month, but maybe I can take everyone into the nearby desert again. Very pretty and unique. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Good!  Busy :-)  I'm glad I had a chance to pop in. #BattenChat

@JaneyKSpratt @Artismia @StephsBubble I like to take little jabs at the Brits when appropriate :-) http://t.co/0Kc1uv3YsW #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @Artismia @StephsBubble My biggest surprise my first VEDA was the social part. I've met some great people! #BattenChat
@battenhall It's a great way to hone your video skills (shooting, editing) while meeting great people from around the world! #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @Artismia @StephsBubble That's the cool part of #BattenVEDA. We support each other! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @JaneyKSpratt I have the non accent American accent with a bit of west Texas. #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble I disagree. ALL accents are cool to the folks that don't have them :-) #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble Funny. Everyone has the reaction at first. You get used to it! #BattenChat
@battenhall I'm so there! My schedule will be even more demanding, but I'm willing to give it a go as they say in the UK. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Yep.  That's my story.  I'll explain in a video hopefully today. :-) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @JaneyKSpratt And I was once attacked by a Penguin! :-) #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble :-) Well, just an FYI, I avoid running since my ACL surgery, but I can substitute bike riding. #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble I'd be a good guinea pig, but I must have more details first :-) #BattenChat
@battenhall Maybe occasionally. My sister and my Mom love seeing my videos everyday :-) #BattenChat
@Artismia @StephsBubble Brandon is right. The key is determination. I could have vlogged every day. I let "busy" be an excuse. #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble Yikes! Might be the kick in the pants I need. Not sure I'm ready yet. :-) #BattenChat
@JaneyKSpratt @StephsBubble I know this one, but I didn't comment to ruin it for others. Steph was "only" champion of the UK :-) #battenchat
@StephsBubble I found Amy searching for social media stuff. Then she announced SSSVEDA. So, it was kind of by accident I guess. #BattenChat
@battenhall My first was #SSSVEDA a year ago and then in August. Now both SSSVEDA and #BattenVEDA, but not quite every day :-) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @artismia Penguins are my favorite. I have a good story. Maybe I'll get it done today. Maybe. #BattenChat
@Artismia @StephsBubble I'm wondering if you could do a StephsBubble face mug? Ever do people rather than characters? #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @Artismia Aw shucks. I will do the Penguin story for sure. I promised! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble It's not bad at all when I have time :-)  Thanx.  #BattenChat
@Artismia Hey Brandon!  What's up? #BattenChat
@battenhall Alas, I haven't vlogged in 9 days. Schedule is out of control! I decided to back off rather than push through. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Amazing! I know what to do, but I am too lazy. :-) That WILL change at some point. No Marathon for me though. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Good advice!  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Nice! I used to work out.  Those were the days :-)  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble I think so. I'm getting ready to eat something for the first time today. We'll see how that goes :-) #BattenChat

@StephsBubble @battenhall You may be right. With @devinbanez and others doing both, maybe there is great #BattenVEDA awareness! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall Yes and no. Not sure all the #SSSVEDA folks are tuned in here, but they should be! :-)  #BattenChat
@battenhall @StephsBubble for sure. I get the #SSSVEDA folks and #BattenVEDA folks confused sometimes, so we will see. #BattenChat
@devinbanez Ugh!  I just did the same thing!  #BattenChat
@StephsBubble iMovie FTW!  I have been pleased with the Moto X for sure.

@battenhall So far so good.  I've missed a couple days, but I justify that because I am also doing #SSSVEDA. 2 videos a day most days.
@StephsBubble The desert likes to be warm I guess.  My Oregon upbringing has me longing for London Fog days sometimes.
All good here in Tucson.  Sunshine and near 90 degrees F.  #BattenChat
@battenhall Looking forward to it!  See you at Noon Tucson time :-)

@StephsBubble @LarnzLive Soon.  Very Soon. I washed my iPhone 5! It still sorta works, but had to get something. #BattenChat
@LarnzLive That's no fun. Time for an upgrade! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Do Brits enjoy the American accent as much as we like the British? If so I'd like to be a TV presenter there :-) #BattenChat
@ReneeVlogs Happy Birtday Dr. ReneeVlogs!!! #BattenChat
One of my favorite things about #BattenVEDA is the British accents. I think I am picking up some new words. Brilliant! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Vlog Nominations looks interesting... #BattenChat
@battenhall Penguins! I have a fun penguin story. #BattenChat
@AngelaSchans Congratulations! I'll check it out. #SSSVEDA
@StephsBubble lol.  But then I'd have to buy some make up :-) #BattenChat
@battenhall The only thing I can think of is to vlog with myself. Split screen or a back and forth. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @reneevlogs Happy Birthday Dr. ReneeVlogs! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble I generally like that. After watching Chris Pirillo for so long I don't think it's necessary for me. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Not me. I'm late January like you. @ReneeVlogs is having the birthday! #BattenChat

@battenhall Devin is fast paced and very funny. Not sure I could adopt that style, but I love watching his videos! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble That's amazing! We had one when I was in high school in Oregon. Of course it was cloudy. :( The birds freaked! #BattenChat
@StephsBubble I'll have to think about that. hmmm. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble I've seen Lunar Eclipses. They are pretty cool and last a long time. Won't be staying up for this one though. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Since it is happening during Passover some people are saying it's a sign. Not sure how I feel about that. #BattenChat
@StephsBubble @battenhall Pretty much the same here.  Just some light editing (half the calories of our regular editing) :-) #BattenChat
@StephsBubble Blood Red Moon in the middle of the night! Skies are so clear here it's never completely dark. #BattenChat
@drewb It starts at almost 11pm here which is 7am there, so I'm guessing you are missing out. #BattenChat
@battenhall Have definitely fallen into a rhythm here at my desk.  My sign off is usually, "see you tomorrow." So creative :-) #BattenChat
@drewb Lunar Eclipse visible in the states overnight tonight.  I'm guessing the Brits will miss out? #BattenChat

Administration IS putting American people through the ringer. Visit a National Park lately? #fnpolitics #MakeDCListen #Shutdown
The House passed an entire bill to fund it all minus Obamacare! Senate won't consider it. Tell the truth! #MakeDCListen #fnpolitics
House compromised to fund government but delay ACA. Senate won't won't budge. ACA isn't ready anyway. #fnpolitics #Shutdown #MakeDCListen
House passed a budget minus Obamacare. Senate won't consider it. That's what this is all really about. #fnpolitics #MakeDCListen #shutdown
President is so tired of the gimmicks that he has shut down parks and monuments. #fnpolitics #shutdown #MakeDCListen
The President has used emergency powers. Like spending money to close National Parks and Monuments. #MakeDCListen #fnpolitics #Shutdown
House has already passed bills to fund all of that except Obamacare. #MakeDCListen #fnpolitics #shutdown
Suggestion to remove threats. Senate should pass House Bill to fund government sans Obamacare then negotiate. #fnpolitics #MakeDCListen
Biggest fear of not raising debt ceiling is this President has demonstrated a willingness to hurt Americans. #fnpolitics #MakeDCListen
Threaten Seniors. Same ol' Democrat playbook. #MakeDCListen #fnpolitics #Shutdown
Again. We will still be able to pay our "Mortgage" if the debt ceiling is not raised. Discretionary spending would  be cut. #fnpolitics
He will even spring for dinner. Doesn't he mean WE will spring for dinner?  #MakeDCListen #Shutdown #fnpolitics
"We can't afford these manufactured crisis' every few months"  Amen to that.  Does he listen to his own words? #Shutdown #fnpolitics
Again, there is plenty of money to meet debt obligations without raising the debt ceiling.
Lying about the "default". America WOULD be able to meet financial obligations, although discretionary spending would have to be cut.
The House did pass a bill!  Oops.  #ObamaPresser

Gee @SenatorDurbin have you been watching? @SenatorTedCruz repeatedly stated Senators should be in exchanges. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
Dick Durbin admits that passing the law without knowing what's in it is causing problems for Teamsters. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
So @DickDurbin supports that Senators should be able to keep their current plan. Little people not so much. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
Apparently Senator Dick Durbin has only one example to cite. Same example as last night. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
Senator @JeffFlake. As an Arizonan who helped you get elected I implore you to join @SenTedCruz in voting against cloture. #MakeDCListen
I have much respect for you @JohnCornyn. I am hopeful that you will be voting against cloture. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen

@1AmericanWoman @SmallgGay @SenTedCruz I would like to see that.
Single payer is the goal of Obamacare. Democrats don't want that honest debate so they hide behind lies. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
Truth in advertising &amp; honest debate. Great concept. Socialized medicine doesn't work. They lose honest debate. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen
Thank You @SenTedCruz for calling out the political class, including Republicans. #KeepCruzing #MakeDCListen

@StephsBubble @Schmittastic We are networking now! Amy mentioned in person from VidCon and the importance of making those trips. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble It is true. I could do a better job networking locally. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble I don't have the cash for travel. That's the main barrier right now. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic Golf? Bagpipes? Anything Shaw :-) #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble You mentioned networking in person Amy. That will be tougher for me now, but I see the importance. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble I missed one or two today too :-) #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble So engaging consistent content. Got it! #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic One reason for my earlier success was my feature news style stories. Lots of editing :-) #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble For sure following the calendar for the most part, but getting out more if I can. Hiking for example. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic I still need to take you all hiking on our amazing desert trails! #VlogChat
I'm watching a lot more YouTube these days and noticing that volume is one of the keys to success in growing a channel. Yes? #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic Yes! Great decision. Also Facetime with the family. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble iPhone 5 allows me to vlog almost anytime anywhere, so that will be a big help. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic Yeah, I need to make sure I don't ignore either work or growing the channel. It can be done! #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble That's my other challenge. My other YouTube account was linked to my G+. YouTube won't let me switch! #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble I want to get serious about growing my channel. I also have to get serious about my job. Time. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble I may try that auto tweeting. I think you can auto G+ too. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic I like they way you add context to your vlogs in your blogs, Steph. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @Schmittastic I almost always Tweet, FB, G+ and blog my vlogs #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble YouTube's recommendation of Capture was a Red Herring! Yikes! #VlogChat
@StephsBubble Of course I have my favorites that are must watch every day :-) #VlogChat
@StephsBubble I go through #SSSVEDA hashtag. I also let YouTube recommend. I've subscribed to most everyone, so I don't miss out. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @StephsBubble I'll try it tomorrow if not sooner!
@StephsBubble See. I'm glad I'm not afraid to ask dumb questions :-) #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @devinbanez That's probably the missing piece Amy. The YouTube app recommended Capture. I should stick with YouTube! #VlogChat
@StephsBubble I was wondering if there was a good app for uploading straight from the iPhone where I can add a description, etc. #VlogChat
@devinbanez Well, I upload from the phone with Capture, but I don't see a way to do a description until I log on YouTube. #VlogChat
I am finding I need to practice vlogging with the iPhone 5 more. Any favorite apps for that? #VlogChat

@StephsBubble @VlogBoss It did create some opportunities though so I'm not complaining. Still learning. #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @VlogBoss I had a lot of success a couple of years ago with my political videos. National exposure even, but no $ #VlogChat
@StephsBubble @VlogBoss Thanx Steph! It really is what I'd like to do. Hard for my personality type to "focus" #ENFP #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @duncan33303 @VlogBoss Haven't watched yet. Really like This Week in YouTube. #VlogChat Looking forward to it!
@VlogBoss or maybe I'm not willing to put in the time outside of my paying gigs. hmmmm. #VlogChat
@VlogBoss Would love to build a channel to make a living with but it's pie in the sky for me right now. #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @VlogBoss The one I have already written is ,"We are never ever gonna survive the weather" #VlogChat
@Schmittastic @VlogBoss I have rewritten a couple of songs into parody songs. Need to produce them. I think they could do well! #VlogChat

RT @uashaykh: Good man #Buffon #ConfedCup #Italy
#Italy could have won #ConfedCup with a 1st half goal against #Spain Thursday. #Buffon is amazing! 4 finalists all great teams.
#Buffon hashtag moving faster than #Italy!  Great guy. Great goalie. Awesome game!
Almost nothing separates the top four teams at the #ConfedCup.  #Italy showed heart and skill! #Italia Italia Italia
#Buffon is so awesome!  Live forever man of the match! #Italy #Italia
BUFFON!!!!!!!!!!!!! #Italy #Italia
#Italia Italia Italia Italia!  #Italy
#Buffon! #Italy #Italia
#Buffon Man of the Match! #Italia #Italy
Aquaman goes high, which I hate, but scores :-)  #Italia #Italy
BUFFON!!!!!! #Italia #Italy!
Buffon reminds me of my Grandfather who was from Naples. Happy funny guy and always smiling! Go #Italy! #Italia!
Penalty kicks.  Reminder.  Don't shoot high!  Keep the ball low #Italy
Buffon Man of the Match!  Win #Italy!
Big time foul!  Quit complaining Caceres. #Italy
How much separates #Italy, #Uruguay, #Brasil and #Spain?  Not much. #ConfedCup
If you like soccer you will love #Italy vs. #Uruguay.  2-2 in 81st minute. Great match! #ConfedCup
Free corner for #Italy.  Thanx #Uruguay :-)
#ConfedCup top 4 packed with talent. #Uruguay equalizer.  2-2 with #Italy. Wow!
Diamanti with his crazy curls and great free kicks! #Italia #Italy
#Italia! Italia Italia Italia!!!  #Italy is awesomeness!
@StephsBubble Watching Italy and Uruguay.  Go #Italy!  :-)  That's where my grandparents are from.  My favorite team.  Oh, and USA.
Buffon is so awesome.  Let's go #Italy!
Love this! RT @StephsBubble: The Bubble.. Is Back! On social media channels you use from 1st July #vlogchat #vlogging http://t.co/Xg7Hn5LoSe
Another great match. Top 4 of #ConfederateCup are very even. #Italy will still win :-)
Yep.  #Uruguay onside.  1-1 with #Italy.
#Uruguay is getting chances. This match is far from over. Still, #Italy with the best of play. Go Italy! #Italia, Italia, Italia!
OK OK, I'll get something done :-) RT @StephsBubble: You've only got one day left of  #VlogChat: InstaMeet Challenge http://t.co/NbIX3Mw9Oy
True. Hand ball should have been called against #Italy. #Uruguay was robbed of a penalty shot. Still, Italy having the best of the play.
2-1 Italy was my prediction also. RT @Hadi_RM7: @FIFAcom Italian had a better chances in 1st half. So it will 2-1 to #Italy #URUITA #Confeds
I like #Spain over #Brasil and #Italy over #Uruguay.  Italy could have won it all with just one finish in the first half with Spain!
#Italy FTW!

Most evenly played match ever.  #Italy lost it in the first half when they should have scored and then in the end.
That seriously sticks. #Italy #Spain
Never go high on a PK. #Italy losses.
Crap. #Italy
Even the PKs go OT! Go #Italy!
This is torture! Who will blink? #Italy up 4-3 in PKs
Casillas and Buffon.  Two of the best!  Go #Italy!
OK #Italy!  Take care of business.
Impossible to pick who wins penalty kicks.  Both luck and skill.  Hoping #Italy will advance to the final.  What a game!
That's it.  Penalty Kicks now.  Lets do this #Italy!
Frenzy! #Italy
I'm guessing 2 or 3 minutes will be added so about 4 minutes left.  Lets Go #Italy!
Good Defense #Italy
#Spain across the six! and a corner.  Come on #Italy!  Hang in there.
Holy cow that was close!  Whew #Italy
#Italy playing for penalty kicks it looks like.
Thank You #Spain for your poor finishing.  Go #Italy!
#Spain and #Italy playing even going into the less 15 minutes of extra time although Italy should have won in the first half. Anyone's game!
#Spain playing American Football! lol  Go #Italy!
#Spain had to miss that one. Can't reward the DIVE. Go #Italy!
Lousy call!  That's a DIVE!  #Italy #Spain
Offside, but #Spain can't finish anyway. Don't let this slip away #Italy!
#Spain now getting too many chances. #Italy needs to shut them down and counter! Lets Go!
#Spain finishes way worse than #Italy so far today.  Casillas in the first half has been the difference keeping #Italy off the score sheet.
So many chances for #Italy and still no joy.
OOOOooooo hit the post!  #Italy
Navas earns another corner for #Spain. He has made a difference since he came in. Come on #Italy!
