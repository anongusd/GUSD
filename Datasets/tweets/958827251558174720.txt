So yes, there is a slight disagreement between @SenatorBurr and @SenateDems. What Sen. Warner is saying is "Yes, there is collusion. No, we just don't have concrete proof of evidence that there was one. If there's more evidence, then it'll surface and we can look at it again" https://t.co/cSlrLEnr51
Sen. Warner: Will we ever have any concrete proof of evidence that there was Russian Collusion going on? We won't unless we can find enough not just circumstantial evidence to prove that there was one https://t.co/cSlrLEnr51
The slight disagreement is this: 	@SenatorBurr: There is no direct evidence that Russia has INTERFERED w/ our 2016 presidential election or that @realDonaldTrump colluded with Putin 	Democrat Sen. Warner: I disagree. Is there proof? Probably. Can we prove it? Maybe (1/2) https://t.co/cSlrLEnr51
First, it's not a lie. Second, @SenatorBurr said there was no evidence of any collusion between @realDonaldTrump and Putin and Democrat Sen. Warner disagrees. Third, @realDonaldTrump just forgot to add that the @SenateDems are in a slight disagreement w/ @SenateGOP https://t.co/cSlrLEnr51
What is there between @SenatorBurr and Democrat Sen. Warner is a slight disagreement over whether or not there was indeed a Russian Collusion between @realDonaldTrump and Putin. Like I said, circumstantial evidence isn't enough to prove that there was collusion https://t.co/uWMzWSfSIm
So, yeah just b/c @SenatorBurr says there's no evidence of the collision between @realDonaldTrump and Putin and Democrat Sen. Warner disagrees doesn't mean circumstantial evidence is enough to prove that Russia has INTERFERED with our 2016 presidential election https://t.co/uWMzWSfSIm
Just because you think circumstantial evidence is enough to say "ooh, we've got proof that there was a Russian Collusion" doesn't mean circumstantial evidence is enough to show proof of collusion. What is actually needed is üíØ% concrete and COMPLETE proof of evidence https://t.co/uWMzWSfSIm
