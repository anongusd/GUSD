Amused to see that well 	over 90% of my Twitter anti-gun “hate mail” this morning is from liberals OUTSIDE of SC.  Meaning not representative of SC opinion...much less SC’s 5th Cong Dist.  #sctweets
BREAKING: Democrats think they have a brilliant “new” anti-gun election strategy: fear of inanimate objects - proving they don’t understand average Americans, much less voters in SC’s 5th congressional district.  #sctweets
We get that liberals hate guns and want to get rid of the Second Amendment, but most Americans aren’t and don’t...which is why Dems have to be hysterical and act like they don’t understand the English language. #sctweets
So not only do hysterical anti-gun liberals not understand guns are inanimate objects, they don’t know the definition of “brandish”.  @jslovegrove @jaketapper #sctweets https://t.co/dHD5CWmOXU
Wonder if they get nervous in Bed Bath and Beyond or Williams-Sanoma... u know, all the inanimate knives.
Hysterical to see liberals freak out over @RalphNorman accurately demonstrating that guns really are inanimate objects.  #SCTweets #SCPol
