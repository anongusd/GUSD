@pierremercer You're right. Here's the latest. https://t.co/8lVQFFuKkj For Oahe and Garrison, the regulating tunnels will be used during scheduled maintenance to hydropower units.
@btubbs83 @NWSKansasCity @moundcity_news When lower basin rainfall amounts are like we saw in the in last week or more, even cutting releases by 1/2, hydrologic models show no reduction to river stages or improvement to the rate of decline. We do watch the rain &amp; river stages &amp; make changes when necessary.
3/3	At GARRISON DAM #MissouriRiver - Spillway flows have ceased Regulating tunnel inspections showed some cavitation but no areas of concern. Releases are currently being made from the powerhouse and regulating tunnels during scheduled maintenance. https://t.co/1oQqxEu8wk https://t.co/jeDxBWnnFC
At OAHE DAM on the #MissouriRiver - Beginning Sept. 10, scheduled maintenance on the hydropower units will require releases to be made from the powerhouse and the regulating tunnels. Combined release rates however, will begin to decline. https://t.co/QMcSrjgrvX https://t.co/RW1IfWXYAN
Higher-than-average releases from all #MissouriRiver Mainstem System dams, including Gavins Point, will continue through the fall.	1/3	https://t.co/QMcSrjgrvX https://t.co/Ln3MlXJcI3

@btubbs83 We understand your concern. As the distance downstream from Gavins Point Dam increases, the more tributary inflows will affect river stages. We continuously monitor precipitation, river stages &amp; reservoir levels to make adjustments as needed.

Current #MoRiver releases from Fort Peck are roughly 9,000 cubic feet per second.
When we talk service level increase, we raise the "floor and the ceiling" for potential releases. An increased service level of 15,000 cfs, doesn't mean the releases increase by that amount, it means we have the system wide capacity to release up to that amount.

This chart shows how much more storage is available in the Missouri River Main stem system than in 2011. The blue line depicts the median of the 2018 runoff forecast and the storage changes as the runoff is captured. https://t.co/2KLW8A1OaO
By increasing the service level on the Missouri River by 15,000 CFS since mid-March, USACE water managers have more time to evacuate flood storage runoff. Current storage in USACE and USBR reservoirs plus runoff forecast influence release decisions.
Missouri Basin Plains snow is typically melted off by March/April - recent years has been January/February. This year it is a little later. May June July is when about 50% of the runoff occurs.

3 of 4 - Plains snow in the upper Missouri basin normally melts in March &amp; April. Much of the melting has occurred - some isolated pockets remain. Drier than normal soil in the upper basin is favorable for absorbing plains snowmelt runoff. https://t.co/p4srBHqaUI https://t.co/VXhdVxkguy
2 of 4  The increased #MORiver service level allows a longer time to slowly release stored flood water - through the spring, summer &amp; fall.  Releases will be reduced, when appropriate, during times of high flows in the lower basin from sudden rain events  https://t.co/p4srBHqaUI https://t.co/1KsyC7VnGj
1 of 4 - Missouri River water managers have increased the service	level by 10,000 cfs. This is based on the amount of water currently stored in the main stem and tributary reservoirs as well as the forecast runoff for the remainder of the year. https://t.co/p4srBHqaUI https://t.co/BpKfNkT5kE
