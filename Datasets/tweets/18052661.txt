The #SummerSolstice will happen here in NYC on June 21, at 11:54 ET. It's hard to explain how amazing those first warm nights are in NYC. It's electric. There is something happening on the streets that you almost had forgotten about. Anyway, until then, hello winter. ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
The silver lining here? Every day from here on out, daylight hours will continually increase in small increments, until we are introduced again to the glorious season known as summer. #wintersolstice https://t.co/dUztYuSZMt
In fact, some places, such as Utqiagvik, Alaska (previously known as Barrow, Alaska) haven't seen the sun since Nov 20 and will not again until Jan 23, 2019. https://t.co/K3H1OtOyUQ https://t.co/lH5zndsE1x
Climatologist Brian Brettschneider (@Climatologist49) made a map showing the varying length of daylight hours across North America during the #wintersolstice. Note some areas in the Arctic Circle who wont see any sun at all. https://t.co/HF8oERHesb
As the shortest day of the year, and longest night, today NYC will experience 9 hours, 15 minutes and 18 seconds of daylight. This obviously varies across the globe. Hong Kong, for example, will experience 10 hours, 46 minutes and 14 seconds of day light. #WinterSolstice.

For the British, an American trying to better himself was like putting a feather in his coonskin cap + imagining himself the height of elegance, or a ‚Äúmacaroni.‚Äù		Yankee Doodle went to town	Riding on a pony;	He stuck a feather in his hat,	And called it macaroni		#NationalPastaDay https://t.co/OqQz3mo8rk
In mid-18th-c. England, some wealthy young British men came back form the European Grand Tour totally obsessed w/ the latest fashions. These fops, or dandies, rejected English cooking for fancy Italian cuisine they discovered, so they were called "macaroni.‚Äù
‚ÄúYankee Doodle‚Äù was first sung by the British army to ridicule their rag-tag colonial allies during the French and Indian War in 1754-1763. The British called them Yankee doodles, a "doodle‚Äù being English slang for simpleton, or in modern parlance, a doofus. https://t.co/GsXrdAHumI

"A couple days later a little boy comes out with a white flag from the British and signals that they‚Äôre surrendering.‚Äù And that's how Alexander Hamilton defeated the British at the Siege of Yorkville! Happy Birthday America. https://t.co/WWvE9lDWsB
"So basically, a bayonet charge. Hamilton is apparently first one up over the ramparts...and in five or ten minutes they subdue the British..
Hamilton ‚Äúleads 200 to 400 men in the dark without bullets in their guns because Hamilton thought that a gun might go off and warn the British that they‚Äôre about to be attacked."
On a moonless October night in 1781, Hamilton led an attack on British troops that resulted in their surrender.
Happy 4th of July everyone! Here's a story about Alexander Hamilton beginning his march on British forces during the Siege of Yorktown, as told by Richard Sylla, author of Alexander Hamilton: The Illustrated Biography. (Illustration by @morphmaker) https://t.co/bFEY8yVdfL
