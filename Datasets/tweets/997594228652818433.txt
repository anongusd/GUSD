@DogginTrump Ordered my nerf gun last night. The Strongarm with an extra 200 rounds. 	Soon to take aim.

@JustaFan18 @patriciaf4444 What I'd really like to see is, who ever wants to be president, start getting up in trumps grill now. Call him out and take him on toe to toe, right in front of everybody. If they get spanked, they aren't going to make it later.
@alien_rogue Ok, I blocked the rest too. I'm most bothered by the us against them (racist) with this border wall thing. I think it gets to me because it's those same people that would lynch me if they could get me alone, for being a trans woman.
@alien_rogue @crk_flyer40 @GOP @realDonaldTrump It's always been this way here, Jeff. Over the years, the Jews, the Germans, the Irish.. ect.. They've all been met by those who said "we don't want your kind here". To those who say it now, somebody said it to their ancestors at some time in the past.
@alien_rogue @crk_flyer40 @GOP @realDonaldTrump There does seem to be awful lot of venting going on, though I guess that's expected, from both sides. Perhaps it's even healthy for those who can handle it. I myself try to avoid getting frustrated. I comment as a humanist for the most part, devoid of political faction.
@alien_rogue @crk_flyer40 @GOP @realDonaldTrump That's what I was trying to say with my first post. "A people of any decency should not treat others as sub human."

@_MrsAtheist_ I just laughed and moved on when I seen the "math is not proof".	If you are not going to accept math, you do snot peak the language of the cosmos. So, before we can have this class, you need to go back and pass a few others. Preferably with high marks.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump *laughing* You actually made me laugh with that one.. 	You did! It is a most excellent point!
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump If it were me writing the check, I'd want to see blueprints, a plan, before I just handed over the money. I'd want to see how they intend to deal with things like aminal corridors, water shed and the like. My understanding is that these are questions we don't have answers to.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump Well then maybe they need to stop fighting each other. Arguement, for the sake of arguement, should not be a fight. Assuming both sides were acting admirably, arguement should be the way to find a compromise that all can be happy with.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump Both sides must first agree to capitulate to the actual facts. Only then is it possible to address the situation in any meaningful way. No grandstanding, no us against them, from either side. Winning should be less about beating your apponent, and more about doing what's right.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump I firmly believe in legal migration. Please do not missunderstand me. My original post was simply to imply that we could be dealing with this better. I don't pretend to have all the answers. I only wish that we as americans were dealing with the situation more compassionately.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump Wherever there is a need, there will be those who seek to take advantage of it. I am not in favor of those who seek to profit from others tragic circumstances. I do however feel compassion for parents who seek to give their children a better life.
@crk_flyer40 @alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump You have a very good point. I'm sure there are many that would mean them harm, though I've spent many a summer on my aunts ranch outside of Columbus New Mexico. I've seen them pour out the water, and I've stood there while they asked her to not put it out for the migrants.
@alien_rogue @GOP @realDonaldTrump The mindset is that it's us against them. Treating them as though they are invaders.. the enemy. It's hate. Hate and fear, and stinginess. "This is for us, not for you, go away" That's the gist of the mindset. It's prejudice.	With intelligence comes understanding.. compassion.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Here's a fact for you. @realDonaldTrFan should be tried on crimes against humanity.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump A people of any decency should not treat others as sub human. That includes ICE. If they fail in that regard, they either need better training, or to be dismantled all together. 	You have no high ground here.

@Lead1225 So, let me see if I understand this. 	Are you saying that we've learned all there is to know with respect to our origins? 	Are you saying my life has no meaning, no morality... no purpose?		Are you being that judgemental?
@ewarren If you really want to win, you're going to have to learn how to fight. Getting your message out is one thing, but it isn't enough, not in this day and age. You're going to have to put your gloves on, and you're going to have to box.

@realDonaldTrump The stress is just eating you up... isn't it.
@realDonaldTrump I'm so tired of you. I really am. It's going to be so nice when we're finally rid of you. After all, how could it get any worse? 	Wait.. Pence.. That's how it could get worse.
@iamAtheistGirl Papa and I go round and round about abortion. He's one of the "old white men"(73). I keep asking him why he should have a say about any woman's body, and to that he never really answers. When I say "if it was a mistress of yours?" He says I set a trap for him. Perhaps.

@realDonaldTrump Trump pays his Chinese partners. Or at least there aren‚Äôt any reports of Chinese steel or aluminum companies suing to be paid. Unlike in the United States, where workers have time and time again had to sue Trump in order to receive a partial payment for completed jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Trump doesn‚Äôt operate a publicly traded company, and he has no fiduciary obligation to shareholders. His decisions are all about higher profits for himself and his family at the expense of American producers and their employees.
@realDonaldTrump Trump used 207,000 feet of Chinese aluminum for the Trump hotel in Chicago. Conservative estimates based on pound per foot means at least $350 million in sales went to a subsidiary of a Chinese aluminum manufacturer. Now he attacks Harley-Davidson.

@AbbaChip @MavenOfMayhem Seems to me Chip hasn't actually read his bible at all. That god of his both directly and indirectly killed how many children in the womb? At one point, all of them, according to the story of Noah. Heck, he even killed all the little baby kittens too, except two.
@Sam16734423 @ABC Yes, agreed, it is a tragedy. One that "conservative christian men (and women)" created, defended and continue to lie about. The hypocrisy in the whole of it, is staggering.
@ABC I hate that they pray before business. Get God Out Of My Government!
@realDonaldTrump The biggest problem with this country today, is YOU! You and that bunch of spineless pussies that sit on their hands #GOP and allow to puke out your rhetoric without saying a word to defend what is right or moral.
@realDonaldTrump The friends I chat with every day who happen to actually live in Germany, all say you Sir, are full of shit. Stop The Lies!
@RepJudyChu This is the same man that attempted to silence the masses by quoting from the bible. The separation of church and state has never been more relevant than it is today. He should be asked to step down.
@CNN Attorney General Jeff Sessions quotes from the bible to defend this administrations actions. That is completely unacceptable! The man should be asked to step down!
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure that will be a wonderful group of haters all pumping each other up. Just what this country needs! 	How about you sit the hell down and Do Your Job.
@realDonaldTrump It's a good day when one sees so many speak out against a tyrant, and the feeble members of an administration that know better, yet are too pussified to stand up to that tyrant.
@rudyperry77 @POTUS "First there came the color gold	 To show the world that we are bold. 	Then there came the color red 	To show the world the blood we shed". 	I'm with ya! 1st Bat, 3rd Marines.
@SaysHummingbird @jbmoorephoto #MAGA is fine with dehumanization as it fits perfectly with their conservative christian values.
@ParkerMolloy Hormones are not Opioids. They don't just hand them out because you stubbed your toe. Biased writers need to get a life.
The amount of dysfunction seen in this government today, starting at the very top and making its way down the pipe... It's sad. Don't we elect these people to sit down with other elected people to talk this stuff out... And Find Answers? Do Your Job!
Neil's the Bomb! https://t.co/kXhTJbeiKj
@VP As long you stand quietly by and say nothing about the children being separated from their parents at the southern boarder, don't you dare try and promote your "god fearing christian values". How Pathetic! Clearly nobody taught you what a real man with honor is.
@realDonaldTrump Yelling now; how so very grown up of you. Listen up Dip Shit, this is your fault and the fault of the idiots that you put in place. Suck it up and fix this crap. Today!
@EdKrassen I should be the commander of the "Space Force"!	"Private Sugar Watkins: Gimme the nuke		Johnny Rico: You trying to be a hero, Watkins?		Private Sugar Watkins: Just trying to kill some bugs, sir."
@EdKrassen @AnnCoulter When people like Coulter speak, we should all know it's just bullshit spilling out of an otherwise useless bucket. Of course, this is the norm for @FoxNews .
@realDonaldTrump *sips coffee*
@realDonaldTrump Seems the National Idiot doesn't have much to do today. How about you put your damn phone down and go take care of the problem at the southern boarder that YOU created.
@Lorarmcha @JustAVoice16 @realDonaldTrump What's worse than the criminal idiot in the white house? All the criminal idiots that fall for his crap, and back his play. Wake Up America!
@Lorarmcha @realDonaldTrump The EO wouldn't get him the "Wall built On Extortion" that he so needs to feed his ego. He deserves the same suffering those families are going through.
@realDonaldTrump The only reason they treat you the way they do is because you're such a piece of crap.
@realDonaldTrump The two faced golfer plays the part of the fool yet again. The stupidity of the man never ends.
@RepMarkTakano  Don't let churches get a tax break for meddling in partisan politics! I urge you to oppose any appropriations bill that weakens or repeals the Johnson Amendment!
@Lorarmcha @realDonaldTrump @JustAVoice16 @MichaelCohen212 I'm all for seeing donny get what he has coming, and those pussies who wouldn't stand up him too. They all need to go. The garbage that he appointed to offices, they need to go as well. And the sooner the better.
@Lorarmcha @realDonaldTrump @JustAVoice16 He's stroking his base. Rubbing the dogs belly, so to speak. Getting them ready for his next line of bullshit.
@EdKrassen "I'm with ya, right or wrong". That's the mentality. They don't much care that he's lying due a lack of ethics on their behalf. They're on the same team, so they're going to back his play even when it makes them look bad too.
@ACampaNajjar Just seen you on TyT. Wishing you the very best over there in the 50, from out here in the 41st.
@realDonaldTrump Dude.. get over yourself already .. sheesh. You're starting to sound like a teenage girl.
@audrey4congress Sorry.. up there in the 1st
@audrey4congress Just seen you on TYT.. From down south in 41, we're wishing you all the best up there in 50. üëç
@realDonaldTrump *sips coffee*
@realDonaldTrump Again you play the part of the fool. Time after time you fall for the simplest of things. It really is a shame to have you as president.
So much for the separation of church and state... according to Pence. https://t.co/3Om3Vj400r
@realDonaldTrump Laxalt had talked openly about the difficulties of his teen years, including a  drinking problem and a DUI arrest. Speaking of his time at Tulane University before he transferred to Georgetown: ‚ÄúI got down there and it was just too much fun, too many women, and too much booze.

@jazminasaavedra Mental disorder you say.. You mean like believing in a god that doesn't actually exist? Or contorting that fake god to fit your agenda and then claiming it's the right thing to do? Pot calling the kettle black
@jazminasaavedra *sips coffee*
@EdKrassen I see the man for what he is. A cheap used car salesman trying to convince you that you really do need that 72 pinto, with the broken antenna. Let's be honest though, it sure looks like there's an awful lot of people out there lined up buy it. Speaks poorly of folks these days.
@jazminasaavedra Tweeting to Saavedra is like taking a piss in some dump. Sure, it's a little disgusting when you first get here, but after you've "vented", it's a whole lot better. *bangs on the wall* "you got any paper over there?"
@peterdaou Can't give him the benefit of doubt, based on his history. Though too, I do hope something good can come of it. My sweetheart thinks the nukes could be on their way at anytime. It's a good night for steak, I think.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe now you'll find somebody that can give you good advice with respect to trade. Perhaps even somebody that isn't an embarrassment to the american people.
@realDonaldTrump I don't think you know what the word great actually means. Might want to look it up. Since you have some free time.
@hemantmehta I'm thinking coach is closeted. Almost bet on it.
RT @VicenteFoxQue: .@realDonaldTrump, this is going too far!	Please step down.
@JustinTrudeau  It seems odd that I'm here apologizing for the behavior of my countries president, though, here I am. Please Sir, know that there is a very large part of these United States that are appalled at that mans conduct. Wishing you the best.
@FoxNews And the wheels on the bus go round and round... round and round... round  and round. Fox News is a complete joke! Their mission is to propagate the stupidity of the current administration, as if that is somehow responsible reporting.
@jazminasaavedra Looks to be a pretty crowded affair there Saavedra.. About like the likes here on your page.. You go girl! *laughs*
RT @RebzBrown: Religion is never an excuse to discriminate. No hate. No exceptions. @seculardotorg #CapitalPride https://t.co/wDVkURVQHo
#FoxNews has an article "How Jesus Died". They list under "Science". The stupidity of foxnews never ends. Says a lot about their base.
@jazminasaavedra If things go the way they look like they're going to, your application will be denied based on your crimes and your mental state. You clearly are not responsible enough to have a weapon; Exactly like many others in your camp.
@CatholicLeague It's actually hard to believe the stupidity in this, though perhaps, not all that hard at all. If you took the time to stop and think before you spoke, you wouldn't look like such an ass.
@jazminasaavedra Here's your family values, Saavedra. This is what you stand for.  https://t.co/qI8PL4VqIz

@nardooncis_b Sheep.
Christians who listen to the idiot behind the pulpit instead of reading the bible for themselves, are just fools. Take your blinders off and read the book objectively. Then talk about your god.
@jazminasaavedra Numbers 5:11-31 Read it Saavedra! Read where your god not only condones abortions, but tells man how to do it. Read It!
@jazminasaavedra If you want to stand against abortion, fine, just don't use your god as moral compass to do it with.
@jazminasaavedra A Christian that stands against abortion, based on their beliefs, has never actually read the bible. Otherwise they would know of the countless number of children aborted in that "good book".
@jazminasaavedra Read your bible dumb ass. In that bible, there were countless abortions done both by your god and in his name. Christians who don't read their own "holy" book should shut the hell up.
@RoseMorganTG @Lorarmcha @jazminasaavedra The situation as a whole was quite saddening. A person victimized and then dehumanized on a candidates platform; How out of line is that! A special thanks to voters for letting Saavedra know this is not acceptable.
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube With pay! The stupidity never stops. Take the badge and file charges against the cops. Do the right thing.
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Remember when there was a time when we could admire the police? Remember that?
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube A child takes a gun to school and shoots other children with it. Take a look at the parents/parenting. The madness we see today is a direct reflection of the mindset of certain adults... trickled down.
@realDonaldTrump What a bunch of bullshit. You own this!
RT @seculardotorg: Religion is never an excuse to discriminate.  We are excited to celebrate #PrideMonth @CapitalPrideDC this Sunday! #Love‚Ä¶
@FoxNews Just another example of fox's bullshit. Down with Fox News
Wake up people. https://t.co/lXuRaMAqxU
@jazminasaavedra This is a good day! As a state/country, we need to see a lot more of this. Intolerance based on a damaging hateful christian believe needs to be eradicated from our government. Kick rocks Saavedra!
@RoseMorganTG So happy to see voters rid of us that woman.
@jazminasaavedra Grasping at straws! You're drowning, Saavedra. Drowning in your own ignorance. Drowning in your own intolerance. Drowning in your regressive ideals of what it is that makes America great. And it's your own fault.
@jazminasaavedra WE deserve a government that stands to represent ALL of its people. ALL! And NOT one that would use its power to OPPRESS those that don't fit into its PATHETIC outdated ideals. Move forwards, not backwards. Saavedra No!
@jazminasaavedra You don't have the common sense given to a common dog. It's clear you don't even understand exactly what your rights are. Yet here you are trying to defend them. This is not what we need in a political leader. Saavedra No.
@jazminasaavedra What this state/country needs, is great thinkers. Not those who stand to oppress others based on a belief that they themselves do not fully understand. Those who claim to represent their god, yet conduct themselves in such a way that that god would not be pleased. No On Saavedra
@jazminasaavedra Not surprising how many conservative Christian organizations are now being labeled as hate groups. Many Christian groups hating on other Christian groups. It‚Äôs hard to know who is hating on who. One thing we do know for sure, it‚Äôs all just hate. Keep hate out of politics.
Day 1. Scratch built spectrohelioscope assembled. It took 6 of us 2 hours. Tomorrow will align the optics and polar align the scope, then hook up the power. Found great deal on vintage 60 millimeter refractor optical tube assembly. A good day.

@KamuiCosplay @pouchedfox @starwars @EA Well Done!
@jazminasaavedra Take a look at the difference in quality/professionalism,  between Saavedra‚Äôs tweets and those of Barrag√°n‚Äôs. It‚Äôs staggering. One is done well, the other, a complete fail. #Outclassed

@jazminasaavedra California Republican Gets Dehumanizing Image Of Transgender Woman Yanked From Facebook! That should be the headlines. That‚Äôs what we should be talking about.
@jazminasaavedra Two sides to every coin, and a whole lot of coins. I get this. But, if you‚Äôre to have a voice for your side of the coin, shouldn‚Äôt it be an honorable voice? A respectable one? One that represents you well? Saavedra! She is not that voice. You can do better‚Ä¶. Much Better!
@KrisRobin666 @jazminasaavedra I seen that. It reads like it was written by somebody that was brainwashed and oppressed by religion at a very early age. Somebody that was too weak to break free from their abusive master. Sad
@jazminasaavedra Facebook removed the dehumanizing image Saavedra posted on her page. Thank you Facebook!
@KrisRobin666 @jazminasaavedra We removed the post you reported	Today	We reviewed the post you reported. Since it violated our Community Standards, we removed it. We let Jazmina Saavedra know that their post has been removed, but not who reported it.	If someone repeatedly violates our standards,.. blah blah
She comes downstairs in the morning, she's got her shirt on inside out, and backwards. It makes me laugh! She don't care... neither do I. Learn to live, enjoy as much of life as you can.
@jazminasaavedra June 5th. Vote with an informed mind. Not based on what some candidate says in their ads, or worse yet, along party lines because "that's how it's done". Rather, take the time to look into their actions. Educate Yourself!
@Stargazing_Girl @jazminasaavedra HAHAHAHHA!  I love this girl. Too Funny
@jesuswordtoday @jazminasaavedra People who cherry pick the bible to suit their own agendas, they are not christians... they're something, but they aren't christians
@Stargazing_Girl @jazminasaavedra Do I get to kill bugs? Really big bugs?
@HRC Most Excellent!
@jazminasaavedra Seriously, that is a nice picture.
I'm tired of people who spout that "Make America Great Again". when all they really want to do is make it fit their narrative. Bigot's. Racists, Homophobes.. The list goes on. Call it what really is.. Hate!
@KrisRobin666 @jazminasaavedra Do not.. I repeat, DO NOT go to her home. If you want to send a mariachi band, that would be funny, but do not go to her home. Please, everybody, let's respect limits.
@WEBNtvNEY @jazminasaavedra @HRC @AGBecerra Pay close attention to Jazmina's video. Listen to the other woman as she says Jazmina was fallowing her the day before. I think Stalking could be added to list of mounting crimes here.
@empowergracewi @jazminasaavedra Thank you @empowergracewi It's Jazmina that has brought me to twitter. Her and her hate. I run a trans friendly website with "Over 1110615 contacts (approx 18/ad) have been made to date!" Members are livid!
@jazminasaavedra I'm done here. It's like we're all standing around ragging on a dead horse, for the way it got itself run over. It didn't know enough before the wreck, it sure as hell isn't going to learn anything after. #Loser
@jazminasaavedra we need to start forwarding all this on to the news agencies around the U.S. copy,paste,click send. the FB video they made yesterday, Jazmina's FB page, the crap we see here... all of it!

@jazminasaavedra She lied! She posted a feed from earlier, but nothing at 6pm. The Latino's for Trump phones were ringing off the hook to make a show for the spectacle, but no face to face to learn/understand. Tough talking coward
@MarcoGutierrez @WEBNtvNEY @Lorarmcha @jazminasaavedra @DennysDiner Sadly, I cannot say the same thing for that twacked out unit that spat out that rant at the Latino's for Trump page. "Throwing the Goat Herder's Guide To The Universe" out there as though it were the only law that needs respecting. Bull Shit!
@MarcoGutierrez @WEBNtvNEY @Lorarmcha @jazminasaavedra @DennysDiner Watched the feed and then went to watch the one at Latino's for Trump. Marco, you tried. I really wished you had been able to continue, as it seemed as though you were thinking through your choice of words.

@jazminasaavedra It's a publicity stunt. To participate, is to give this person a voice. If she truly wanted to learn, she would be down at the transgender clinic. Not On FB!
