Agreed... this should be one of thousands of announcements for the Bayou State #lalege #lagov https://t.co/jYvyK7bJxj
We should be celebrating with businesses who make these investment decisions every day in a state with riches like ours. Again congrats to @ExxonMobilBRA  for getting to this point despite the hurdles they had to overcome #lalege #lagov
And competing for investment (90% of their dollars went to #texas) means taking down walls to doing business - unfair &amp; unnecessary litigation &amp;  unpredictable taxes to start. #lalege #lagov
Congratulations in order for @ExxonMobilBRA ! We are all looking forward to the day when investments like these are not shared so disproportionately with our neighboring states... for that, we'll need to be ready to compete for these projects as a state. #lalege #lagov https://t.co/0Xe7i7tApb

"We have an opportunity to look in the mirror and decide what kind of #Louisiana we want to be - and the way we make it better is by engaging in local elections. Recent elections had only 10% turnout, and people need to make their voice heard to make Louisiana compete #lalege
"The oil and gas industry is not unique. All biz is vulnerable to predatory lawsuits. As long as there is fertile ground for lawyers to find businesses that they can sue and get huge paydays from, they are going to move from industry to industry." #lalege #lagov

Lousiana üëè deserves üëè a üëè better üëè legal üëè environment üëè #lagov #lalege
The Farm Bureau told FOX 8 Investigates, ‚ÄúWe believe our legal environment is a significant factor contributing to the high cost of insurance in this state.‚Äù #lagov #lalege
One insurance company said the amount of lawsuits does impact rankings. The Southern Farm Bureau operated in six states. Louisiana accounts for 17 percent of their policies, but fifty percent of the company‚Äôs lawsuits originate in Louisiana. #lagov #lalege
..The next highest jury threshold is in the State of Maryland where the threshold is $15,000. Thirty-six other states have no jury threshold. #lalege #lagov
One thing that does separate LA from the rest of the country is what‚Äôs called the state‚Äôs jury threshold. Louisiana has a $50k jury threshold, that means a judge decides any case below that amount, anything over that amount -- a jury takes the case. #jurythreshold #lagov #lalege
‚ÄúWe are off the charts in claims to litigation. For decades that has been what has kept us top most expensive state in America for auto insurance.‚Äù - La commissioner of insurance #lagov #lalege https://t.co/rX2sVNwZt3
"The numbers FOX 8 Investigates found, show that Louisiana is more litigious than any other state. In 2016, lawyers filed 3,300 auto liability suits in Orleans Parish. That amount is higher than Miami and Austin." #lagov #lalege
Lawsuits + More Lawsuits = The reason why the #citizens of #Louisiana pay more than ANYONE in the nation in car insurance #lagov #lalege @LeeZurik https://t.co/uzuhFiRsxC

@LaPurpleReign I agree with that. Certainly a diversified economy is a strong one.  Now that prices and industry have rebounded, so to should have our economy.  Texas has certainly benefited.
@LaPurpleReign Oil and gas prices are not floundering at all. Oil is above $70. US Oil Production is at record levels. The state should be booming with current prices.  But Louisiana is choosing lawsuits over jobs and investment.  We need the oil and gas industry invest more in La, not less!
