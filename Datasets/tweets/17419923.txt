@NateZeisler We have to build that #ArtsVote power #NETMCDO
RT @guptaviolin Another way is to show up in a non-arts capacity. Go to city hall meetings. Be a citizen. then bring your fiddle. #NETMCDO
A5 Build a coalition, broaden your network, join your neighborhood council, volunteer for a movement that's meaningful to you #NETMCDO
@ACon0506 agreed, coalition building, partnership, &amp; co-creation is key #NETMCDO
A5 Vote! Artists can show their #ArtsVote power &amp; inspire civic participation so the arts can thrive in our neighborhoods #GOTV #NETMCDO
A4 Echoing the need to listen. Also, doing research to understand community assets that exist but are underutilized #NETMCDO
RT @NateZeisler A4 Listen, Listen, Listen! 21st century...opportunity to have a deep impact on all walks of life, not just the arts #NETMCDO
RT @guptaviolin A4. Artists need to talk to their neighbors. Literally... #NETMCDO
A4 Artists can inform &amp; collaborate with social justice orgs to strengthen critical movements for community change #NETMCDO
@KUSCGail great question. Brings up the need for coalition building &amp; strategic partnerships between organizations #NETMCDO
A4 Artists can speak up &amp; get involved in the civic process! We need creativity in policy solutions &amp; community action #ArtsVote #NETMCDO
A4 Artists have a unique vantage point. We need artists who are listening to offer creative solutions to social problems #NETMCDO
A3 #ArtsVote is building an informed &amp; engaged population in LA County - providing space for public dialogue &amp; volunteerism #GOTV #NETMCDO
A3 the #arts can also change policy and the level of civic participation which is important re: community impact #ArtsVote #NETMCDO
A3 Partnership is critical too. When social justice activism &amp; arts link that's a powerful strategy to ignite change in communities #NETMCDO
@guptaviolin that's amazing. how have their experiences in #homelessness and #incarceration shaped your work and story? #NETMCDO
A3 When leaders come together and help each other it strengthens our collective work to advance the arts in cities and schools #NETMCDO
A3 #ACTIVATEArtsLA advocates are bettering their communities through the arts, action, &amp; coalition building #ArtsEd #CulturalPolicy #NETMCDO
A3 I work with about 100 community arts leaders &amp; advocates throughout LA County in our #ACTIVATEArtsLA program #NETMCDO
@J_Derderian That's awesome. I was a music teacher in #ChulaVista for sometime #NETMCDO
@RobertsRachelL story telling is key! We have to voice the narratives of how the arts are part of the fabric of life #NETMCDO
A2 An indicator of community health is the degree of access to the arts. #Arts are part of the whole community ecosystem #NETMCDO
@J_Derderian Yes! Where have you seen some great examples of this? #NETMCDO
@NateZeisler we approach advocacy through grassroots leadership development, policy change, &amp; bosting civic participation #NETMCDO
A2 When someone is empowered through the arts to participate in civic dialogue or a movement for change, that is community impact #NETMCDO
A2 When a child comes to school excited to learn, that is community impact #ArtsEd #NETMCDO
A2 When we experience a better quality of life because of investment in the arts that's community impact #NETMCDO
A2 Community impact in the arts means there is deep investment to make individual lives &amp; geographic spaces more healthy &amp; vibrant #NETMCDO
A2 It’s a fundamental right to have art &amp; creativity as part of your daily life in your community - home, work, school #NETMCDO
