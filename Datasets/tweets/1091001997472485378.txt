@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews This is a blatant lie.  Congressional leadership was informed of the facts prior to the investigation.  NO ONE objected - not McConnell, not Ryan, not the Dems.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews This is blatantly false.  Trump continues to attack rule of law, which is clearly threatening to him.
@realDonaldTrump This is false.  Trump inherited a 9 year bull market economy, with a steadily increasing job creation trendline.  He has done little to change this.
@LouDobbs @POTUS This is pure propaganda.
@JRubinBlogger This article is accurate.
