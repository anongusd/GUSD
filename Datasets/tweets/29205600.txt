Instead of cutting conservation $$, let's increase investment in programs, practices and research that can clean up our water, pull carbon out of the air and into the soil, and make the land more productive for farmers: https://t.co/S7RzohvXld. It will payback dividends.
The #2018Farmbill cuts funding for conservation. Our conservation programs already face demand that far exceeds capacity. In FY15 they turned away as many as 75% of qualified applicants. We should not be turning away farmers that want to protect their land and the environment.
A sustainable #Farmbill is key to supporting farmers &amp; addressing some of our most serious environmental challenges. That's why @SEEC leaders called on Chairman Conaway to restore funding for conservation programs &amp; remove damaging environmental polices: https://t.co/5sIBPUQvPX
