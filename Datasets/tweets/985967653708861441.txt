@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov Slow down there, fella; i can smell ur sister on ur breath.
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov So no, you dont have any connection between the  strengths/weaknesses of genders and the draft.
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov What does strength have to do with the draft? Most of the jobs in the military dont require any sort of physical strength.  Your biological strength has nothing to do with the draft.

@Anom1c @SSS_gov No.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov That's the current rule they have for men.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Can you please rephrase what you said?
@Anom1c @SSS_gov if a woman has a child and the woman is not a key supporter for their household, yes i do.		But i have already said this many times. I assume you are trying to get me to say something contradictory. If you have anything new to say, i will respond. If not, I won't.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov And in most cases they dont punish a man who does that, society does.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov They may just wait 9 months and then draft the mom. What would happen to the child would be different for most cases.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov I wouldnt call it complicated, its just hard to explain through twitter into a closed mind.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov I suppose out of all of the things i have said, that would be the one thing i was mistaken on.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov If she could prove that she was financially needed and it would be a hardship for her dependents, no. But if she couldnt, yes.		Its the same rule they already have implemented for men.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Maybe it is, but again im not the supreme court nor congress, it would be up to them.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Or they could just wait 9 months for the baby to be born and then send her off.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov No, because they would be pregnant. They would have to prove beyond responsible doubt that the woman was lying. If she wasnt, the DOJ and constitution would most likely have her back.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Avoiding the draft is a crime (which this would be), but they could have a sort of policy that prevents prison time because the perpetrator is pregnant. Im not the Supreme Court or Congress, so i dont know 100% what will happen.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Sorta, yea. Not 100%, but i would think that would be the basis.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov It IS her choice. However, using a child to avoid the draft most likely means she didnt care about it in the first place.		(I also said it would most likely be a crime, the penalty for it could be anything, a fine, jail, or absolutely nothing.)
@beckoh @SSS_gov What kinds of idiotic tweets?
@Anom1c @SSS_gov (Purposefully) getting pregnant after being drafted would be considered a crime for avoiding the draft.		If they are already pregnant, they wouldnt be drafted.		If they are the sole guardian or primary source of food and whatnot, they would also not be drafted.		Pretty simple.
@DC_Matthew @SSS_gov So men are more disposable than women?
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov Why do you think only men should be drafted?

And just like that, a flag representing humans to other lifeforms should look something like this: https://t.co/EMJJxFvZw4
It could also have a black peace (to show a nonviolent idea of our species) symbol (Hinduism is the first established belief, so the symbol should be from that religion) the middle of the circle (to show that no matter how bright, there is always darkness)
and have a red background (showing how blood that is spilled is all in support of goodness)
The flag could have a white circle (representing the sun and goodness)
If we plan to go to other planets, we will need a flag that accurately describes human history.		If red black and white were the first colors acknowledged by humans (through blood, night, and day) why not just make a flag that is red black and white?

@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Yes. Because presidents are human and they are immoral.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris The fact you won't look proves that it is you who is unopen to new ideas.		In addition, your comments only further prove my initial point.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Im simply saying that humans are immoral. Naturally. I have literally no idea how you are trying to disagree with that.

@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Its undeniable that Trump's bombings of Syria have resulted in half as many civilian casualties as guilty ones. Might want to fact check that one
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris He has denied the citizenship of people legally trying to enter the country. Walking into girls's dressing rooms and frequently calling women golddiggers isnt exactly moral.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris A bombing that caused half as many innocent casualties as soldier casualties.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris I would say denying citizenship, allowing racists in washington, degrading women, keeping kids in cages, and many more are fairly immoral decisions.

@Micahsdaddy69 In the end, i think that if you get a minimum wage job, you should expect to live the minimum (next to no luxuries).		However, with only 8% of Americans owning a business and neither of us being a part of that 8%, its safe to say what was said here wont matter in the long run.

@Micahsdaddy69 I may have never been employed, but my immediate family has a combined 130 years of work experience. And they could all atest that free products/employee discounts have only encouraged them to work.
@Micahsdaddy69 That usually a simiar case now with emplotee discounts or free food. It allows employees financial benefits that also benefit the company (employees get food and will be encouraged to work as a result)
@Micahsdaddy69 The same can be saud for hiring. With a minimum wage of lets say $5, a company can hire triple the amount of workers and be able to pay good workers more based on quality rather than cutting the workforce in half because not everyone can do $15 worth of work.
@Micahsdaddy69 But if they raise prices (more than they do know because they will compensate for the profit they will be losing), your new wealth wouldnt do anything because everything is now more expensive, moreso than it would be otherwise.
@Independent His name would be "General Lee" btw

@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC What can I'm say? I'm just supper cool.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC Nah I didnt learn a think, I'm very closed minded.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC Maybe, but I hope you know you argued about taxes with a 14 year old who is failing math for 3 hours.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC Either way, its 3 am and I have 8th grade orientation at school.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC (Most importantly) we aren't in an arms race which caused most of these taxes.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC Taxes of 70% in the 1910s? Because that worked out well, right?
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC Nah. I do. I'm saying that taxing the rich (a broad word), and lowering taxes for the middle class, you will never have a stable economy.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill @AOC If u wanna live like that, go ahead.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill How would you have asked?
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill What percent do you propose taxing the rich?
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill Sorry, dumb question. You dont.
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill Do you even know how to read?
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill I'm framing it exactly how the OP phrased it:		Do you support tax cuts?
@ItsSuperEric @StealYoRedBull @thehill Yea, an analogy that you said "neither" to. Meaning you dont support tax cuts.

@syobevoli O darn, sorry. I have one final question:		Is it morally wrong to go into the future 25 years and "rape" yourself?
@syobevoli But then that's mitosis and it's perfectly natural
@syobevoli Out of curiosity, what is a "wrong reason".
@syobevoli Ok, is it morally wrong to go back 15 years and have intercourse with your 9 month old self?

@be_weeeeee @thehill @Gillette I'd reckon all 4, but I dont see how this is a headline. There are a lot worse protests gone wrong for a kid standing near a protester to make the news.		In other words, I still dont think what the kid did warrants this kind of misbehavior.
@be_weeeeee @thehill @Gillette What did he do?
@be_weeeeee @thehill @Gillette It could just as easily been a terrible female role model. 		In addition, I personally dont see what's wrong with watching a protest (that's what he did, unless I'm wrong)

@syobevoli The closest thing they had to a perfect balance was AC Rogue. It had the old story elements, and included a compelling, ORIGINAL story
@syobevoli They should do one about Jacob and Evie's parents about the fall of London to the Templars. Cuz then you know the prologue (Kenway), story (this one), the arc (Syndicate), and the end (The WWI Syndicate) of the Templars in London. It would finish the unfinished story arc.

By this time (if vamps are revealed) town has to kill 3 vamps. In addition, vamps will have bitten a new guy n6. So the vamps can still win.

@crod1906 @thehill Does that make it ok?
I honestly think that there is only a true "Chaos" game in #TownofSalem.		It's a custom game with these roles:		Sheriff	Sheriff	Sheriff	Jailor	Veteran	Bodyguard	Vigilante		Godfather	Framer	Janitor	Disguiser		Executioner	Executioner	Jester	Witch
@townofsalemgame The new role, or "Exorcist" would select any of the 14 players, and if their target was a townie turned vamp, they would become a townie again. It could also be that if Exorcist becomes a vamp, he could commit suicide, or something. Idk, this was just a solution I thought of.
@townofsalemgame I personally think that vampires are to OP in Dracula's palace. Because at least in Ranked/Classic, you knew how many evils there were.		I think it'd be cool if there would be a "new" role for that mode. It'd replace Retributionist, and act like VH.
@crod1906 @thehill Why are they laughing the memorial of a dead president?

@JamesAnthonyMc5 @CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow That still doesn't change the fact that cops are individuals and think differently than one another. For all you know, when the video cut out the man was loaded full of bullets for trying to get out.

This is why time travel was a bad idea. Stupid Chinese people with their baguettes, tea, and vodka! Maybe if they would have worried about us and not their oil, there would be 2.7 trillion more people on this Earth and not another one.
Why didn't they warn them? They could have saved trillions of lives. No wonder China and America are at a civil war. This is a major factor in China`s loss to the Aztecs in WW2. If they had warned President Cleveland about the terrorists, we wouldn`t even celebrate 9/11!!!
Today at school, we celebrated the memories of 9/11, the awful moment in American history.....but I heard that China was 12 hours ahead! Since they are ahead in time, they could have warned Obama about the terrorists in Pakistan and India that they were hijacking a plane! Right?

@JennyCaldwell @Leigh_ATL_SAV @TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei If Mexico is so bad, then we better close the border so none to the (as you say) not-by-a-long-shot-worse-than-american Mexican criminals.
@JennyCaldwell @Leigh_ATL_SAV @TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei But America has no hate, gun, police, minority, or gang  violence.
@SpencerPI @GeorgeTakei In a place with the highest gun violence, police that kill innocent people, high gang violence, minority-hate groups, and a president who disrespects women, they should have stayed in Mexico.
@SrikanthTalagad @GeorgeTakei I guess we'll see

@BlackMrWilson @KJ_Jeller @KyleKulinski They "dont" do that. They may have at one time, but he died and the Waltons dont work for Walmart anymore. Anytime Walmart screws over workers, it's not the Waltons that do it.
@BlackMrWilson @KJ_Jeller @KyleKulinski What? Taking money from a man's family that he worked for is immoral. I'm saying that "the kids screw over workers" is not valid because they dont run Walmart.
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei Yea. Pretty stupid claim isn't it?
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei So they cant watch the news, but they can watch our movies?
@Silverwillow51 @TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei I bet I'd think the same if I moved to a third world country, and moved to Mexico (like they were offered) but they obviously dont care.
Dang. @kissmyash_86 thinking I care. https://t.co/wwj3T1d41M
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei I have honestly NEVER seen the US portrayed as the good guys.
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei So why would they go to a new country without knowing anything about it? Are you saying that we could be at war with Canada, and they wouldn't know? They are migrants, not idiots.
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei "A happy life" in a country with the highest gun violence, police that kill innocent people, separated families, suppressed minorities, and a president who disrespects women?
Dang. Cant hold his ground. I guess @browns_brewer isnt built for Twitter. https://t.co/zgDQmNQ6kE
@KJ_Jeller @KyleKulinski How is that at fault of his family?
@Draculess1 @GeorgeTakei If trump is so bad, why come here? Would you move to North Korea if you didnt want to live here?
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei Then they would go ANYWHERE because anywhere would be better. They shiulda stayed in Mexico.
@Tribal_Prophet @browns_brewer @GeorgeTakei That has nothing to do with what was being discussed. Now stfu
@TC_in_TDot @Leigh_ATL_SAV @GeorgeTakei Well, if they come from such broken countries, they'd take any help, and know you dont always get what you want.
@KJ_Jeller @BlackMrWilson @KyleKulinski The CEO and executives of Walmart arent even Waltons. That isnt a valid argument.
@KJ_Jeller @KyleKulinski Why take Sam's money from the family he worked for? He literally worked for the money to give it to his family. (As all people who make money do)
@Draculess1 @GeorgeTakei If they wanted help, they'd take it. They didn't, so the dont.
@browns_brewer @GeorgeTakei No, I think you're the one not reading the news. America is literally Nazi Germany, and even has Fuhrer Trump. We kill blacks, hate gays, separate families, and side with evil dictators. If America is truly this bad, they should have taken asylum in Mexico (as offered)
@syobevoli @DailyMirror Yea
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei If they didnt know (unlikely), now they do.
@browns_brewer @GeorgeTakei So y come here? If America is sooo bad, why come here?
@syobevoli @DailyMirror I got time
@syobevoli @DailyMirror Nah

@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei If America is (as the Left calls it) Nazi Germany, with Fuhrer Trump, why seek asylum here?
@KyleKulinski Yea, let's just take Sam Walton's hard earned money away from his kids!!

@DestiniSchmit @Its_Fern_02 Did the teacher in question hack your Twitter account?
@syobevoli @Its_Fern_02 Ethanol, by the way, is the official drink of the AntiHydro Party.
I have decided to create Williams-McCarthyism. However, it will not be about Communism. It will be about water.		Better cheq urself
We had a tornado drill today in school. Luckily the tornado passed, and no one was hurt!! #Safety #CloseCall #WeAreWest #SCCSD #siouxcity #GausmanForDistrict4
@Its_Fern_02 I was gonna add on to that, but idk who may or may not read this.
@treasonstickers @realDonaldTrump How does he "empower violent white supremacists"?
@Joerg1968 @washingtonpost But still worse than what Kavanaugh did to Ford
@ThatMagmaDragon @hawkeyeka1K @philswiftontv You're*

@syobevoli I hope #GausmanForDistrict4 is on that list
Here's a big good night from Mr. President.
@Ptab01 @YippyKieYay @JasonTGillock @extrucker57 @Ocasio2018 Considering he calls himself a "political science major" in his bio, it's pretty scary.
@Qmicisha It was a joke
Two questions:		1.) Where are her legs?		2.) Does anybody have her number? https://t.co/IxPUDQgxv5

@YippyKieYay @Ptab01 @JasonTGillock @extrucker57 @Ocasio2018 But it is. He just chose not to listen.

Myah can act like the victim all she wants, but when it standing in the middle of an aisle, a lady says "excuse me", you cant hear her cuz of ur headphones, I try to pull your headphones out, and you still dont listen, I'm gonna snap you into reality.
Reminder to all #SCCSD Students:		The Fischer Trial will be by jury on November 25, 2018.
Is @paulgausman going to run for president? #Gausman2020 #GausmanForDistrict4 https://t.co/J8mvyMYpkc
At the very least make up a reason that you said something so stupid.
Please delete this tweet. It will only ruin your public image (i.e. your lack of knowledge of a "Republic", "Slavery", and the "Electoral College") https://t.co/CMbnvLectU
Uh....no it doesnt.		In fact, the Electoral College  is one of the few things that MAKE us a Republic, and not a Democracy. https://t.co/CMbnvLectU
@DailyMail K, but this time in English

@syobevoli I dont think this conversation ever happened. When I ask my 7yo niece what she did at school, she talks about some Sofia the First.
With my return to the states, I bid you goodnight.
@sarahsplains @rebeccaballhaus @nycsouthpaw Is that a no?
@srogers844 @KellyannePolls @KellyannePolls
@dwbiega @KellyannePolls Do you have proof?
@Ras_Beret @rebeccaballhaus @nycsouthpaw I dont understand the meaning of "stop"
@mymomwaswrong @rebeccaballhaus @maggieNYT You must not have a husband or son
@sarahsplains @rebeccaballhaus @nycsouthpaw Did you press charges?
@brits91 @LisaLacherBryan @rebeccaballhaus I dont know the meaning of "no"
@JenniferHertzl2 @rebeccaballhaus What would you do if some girl falsely said that one of your sons sexually assaulted her? Then, her friends back her up, and he is put on trial. Next, not only is he found guilty of that assault, but of many fabricated others. Would you support those women?
Is that 51 - 48 now? https://t.co/yZg1VUank6

@MarkBHyde @FoxNews They dont even know anymore
That's pretty bad sportsmanship. Republicans have the house AND Senate. Yet there are still Democratic Justices. https://t.co/fmN3UBBUgA
