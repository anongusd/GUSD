We are NOT a democracy , we are a democratic republic , since 1776		Why not be a good American and go take a civics class instead of destroying this country to fit YOU.  		‚ÄúAsk not what your country and do for YOU, ask what YOU can do for your country‚Äù.

Give me a break, instead of focusing on trashing YOUR president, go fix a DNC primary process that allowed Clinton to buy it
@Jack_W002 @beehive1027 @disturbingduck @HuffPostPol @realDonaldTrump We established an electoral for just this purpose, that the densely populated areas didn‚Äôt have more power than the suburbs.

@DGPurser @joegooding So true.  Even worse, is these democrats are actually working for the #Resistance and the 18 billion invested in it.   		Sadly, too many Americans are so filled with hate they can‚Äôt see the truth right in front of them.  		https://t.co/gWgN9njJ3M

@tedlieu @RoKhanna @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I think if you‚Äôd finally stop #Resisting you‚Äôd see he‚Äôs actually been doing a pretty good job.  		Disconnect your hate for his style and focus on policy.  Like the border wall.  Dems and Reps been promising it for 20-30 years.  But @realDonaldTrump will actually get it done.

@Official_Cord I‚Äôll side with republicans, they have guns and know how to use them. 		IMHO, I think the 2 parties ARE dead they just don‚Äôt know it yet. Republicans have been replaced by conservatives.  Democrats have been replaced by socialists, communists and other radicals......
@JackPosobiec @DavidAFrench Your right, it‚Äôs not a hoax, it was actually a conspiracy.
@dbongino I hate saying this, because it escalates a lot of hate in America but, the only way these dividers and destroyers of our constitution will ever STFU, is to hold them accountable for their actions.		They are all part of a conspiracy to unseat a duly, legally elected president
@dbongino Didn‚Äôt he also support communists in the 1970‚Äôs?
@Official_Cord So, what‚Äôs your thoughts on how to unite those that have been brainwashed to hate trump?
@HanifeLong Here‚Äôs some homework, go watch The Enemies Within on Amazon , and go see how many people in congress that are tied to socialist, communist or Muslim brotherhood organization.		It‚Äôs over 100 , it‚Äôs scares me to think how many are in lower levels of government
@Official_Cord I hope so, cause it‚Äôs keeping us very divided as a nation, it‚Äôs so sad that families and friends are being divided because of who they voted for. 		The HATE people have and spewing is sick
@DoYouCOVFEFE @usminority @covfefe Oh I will, I‚Äôll be placing some in my ‚ÄúLiberal Tears‚Äù #covfefe tumbler		üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@Official_Cord Well it‚Äôs not drama when they start prosecuting people, then it‚Äôs action.   And I have a HUGE problem with the one sidedness of these actions.  		We should be calling this what it is, a soft coup, how nobody is being held accountable for the FISA stuff is beyond meü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@usminority I never tagged you in my pinned tweet.  		When all this nastiness on social media gets me down, I listen to Gary‚Äôs song.
@Official_Cord There is a difference though , Obama was fined 375k.  They want to impeach trump, kinda overzealous and , this whole Russia think is a one sided hoax.  If working with Russians was such a big deal, why didn‚Äôt they investigate Hillary‚Äôs campaign who also had contacts with Russia ?

She is as bad as @RepMaxineWaters https://t.co/jIXUZSORuK

@Jim_Jordan Why doe the DOJ keep refusing to let him answer?  What is he hiding?  		@realDonaldTrump needs to declass the @DevinNunes documents.  They say sunlight is the best disinfectant 		https://t.co/HPioZYiH1n
@themarketswork I can understand tweets like his from regular twitter trolls, but a member of Congress?  		He‚Äôs vile
@ernie_plumley @lori_tech @BreitbartNews Translation: he‚Äôs not part of the New World Order , globalist cabal.  		That‚Äôs my @POTUS rejecting the SWAMP
@ArthurSchwartz @trumpovic02 If trump declassifies the emails and documents, Comey won‚Äôt be able to stall any longer
@tedlieu Yeah, you‚Äôre right , it‚Äôs a waste of time when people don‚Äôt answer questions.		It‚Äôs ok Ted, you can‚Äôt protect him from his own lies., it‚Äôs coming , and history will not judge your partisanship lightly 		https://t.co/HPioZYiH1n
@thehill Wow, you make it sound like breaking news.  Every candidate had contact with Russians
@PatriotMike6 @RealBasedMAGA It sucks to suck
@brandondarby @trumpovic02 She‚Äôs a socialist, she needs no defending, her win has only enabled her , and made her louder and more cocky, when her platform fails to attract REAL Americans , that actually understand our history and our constitution, she will undoubtedly turn to fascism to retain power.
@mflynnJR @POTUS He‚Äôs smoking some of the good legal weed in his state of CA.  What‚Äôs up with Californians enabling this peddler of Hate ?

@MiaFarrow @realDonaldTrump You know how much value your opinion has ....no more than mine.  		Now go enjoy your HATE sandwich
@slacker_ga01 @PuggySueR @RepMaxineWaters Has any of these liberal dividers and panders of hate ever disavowed this hate and violence?  üëáüëáüëáüëá https://t.co/JstY5Do9Tj
@dbongino They won‚Äôt give two shits, until they start seeing people legally held accountable.  		It‚Äôs not painful for them yet and they are still ridding the house mid term win
@doanfilm @DineshDSouza @KevinMKruse I love how he used the word ‚Äúincendiary‚Äù as if to diminish the value of your facts.  IE we don‚Äôt have to debate them because they are incendiary.
@DineshDSouza you are the best!   The more I listen to you , the more I appreciate you https://t.co/jfPzE7hGCW
@RealBasedMAGA @Stonewall_77 Not surprised, isn‚Äôt weed legal there?
@tedlieu But @gop gained in the Senate
@tedlieu @mflynnJR @POTUS You‚Äôre speculating Ted, very sad that a member of congress would send these kinda tweets.  		Such a class act.  Hope the folks in your district realize the hateful person they have representing them.
@mflynnJR @POTUS Ted is in a liberal safe space in CA and so he doesn‚Äôt get held accountable for his biased hate speech.
Saving this tweet as it won‚Äôt age well https://t.co/vt4O7I7obO
@RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 See what happens AOC, when you get out of your little liberal safe space bubble into the national spotlight, you‚Äôre not so popular. 		You should have calibrated on your agenda with the opposition, when people like @charliekirk11 @conservmillen @benshapiro offered to debate you, https://t.co/cOS5oH7PNT
@dbongino @JBaker31826004 They are the REAL Fascists disguised as socialist.
@SaraGonzalesTX Because @Ocasio2018 , If smart, needs to stop and realize that socialism Always leads to fascism/communism.  		While she claims it was a joke , maybe so, but when her power is eventually threatened, she will use fascist tactics like she joked about.
@DineshDSouza https://t.co/HSk5WcxQ0E
@JoeConchaTV Perfect, the merit is she threatened someone with subpoenas over an opinion, and this is the kind of immature person NY elected to Congress.
@mflynnJR Apparently 445k hacks follow this tard

@HouseGOP @TheDemocrats @HouseJudiciary @OfficeGovEthics @GOPChairwoman @WhiteHouse @SenMajLdr @HouseDemocrats @GOP 		This appears to be a blatant abuse of power, threatening a citizen with subpoenas.  		This is an ethics violation 		@foxandfriends @FoxNews @dbongino https://t.co/QhtjsZykVA
@Ocasio2018 Well you did kinda threaten a person with subpoenas for trolling you .  That‚Äôs an abuse of power , didnt they cover that in your orientation?  @HouseGOP 		@RealCandaceO @benshapiro @usminority @TheOfficerTatum @charliekirk11 @TPUSA @realDailyWire @TomiLahren @CRTV @conservmillen

The Academy‚Äôs is a sinking ship anyways, with their partisan , one sided , and hateful rhetoric.  		#WalkAway w/ @usminority
@Education4Libs @SoCalNow3 Oh but this liberals trying to build some fantasy utopia, don‚Äôt give two shits about our history nor the constitution.		Americans need to wake up and understand that liberals want to rewrite the constitution to suit THEM not ALL

@EmilyCompagno @PlanetTyrus I‚Äôm never surprised by the hypocrisy of Harris or many of her colleagues in the new Socialist Democratic Party 		What I am surprised with is how many people still vote and support them, knowing they are hypocrites
@Lrihendry It doesn‚Äôt fit their #HateTrump agenda
@RebekahWorsham @montanarancher1 @realDonaldTrump extended the olive branch after he was elected BIGLY , and she should have just enjoyed retirement...BUT NO.....she had to go on book tours and continue to divide.		They only way she‚Äôll shut up is to #LockThemUp		Sadly it‚Äôs come to that, cause it‚Äôs not unifying
@stiner_kathy @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Oh, btw, his poll numbers are rising.  As people lay down their HATE, they‚Äôre no longer blinded by emotions , and can see what he‚Äôs doing for jobs and middle class workers.
@stiner_kathy @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Wrong...most polls have him mid 40s and Rasmussen has him at 50.		Not one poll has him at 38.  Fact matter more than your feelings 		https://t.co/yWj2kwu3jp

@realDonaldTrump Integrity at the head of the alphabet agencies should have prevented the FISA abuses, those need to be fully investigated and those responsible held accountable.
@KevinHart4real Kevin I‚Äôve not followed all your work, but I‚Äôm disgusted by how the liberal MOB mentality has treated you. And pressured you to step down.		I hope you realize now, why people #WalkAway with @usminority 		You have the ability to UNITE Americans with your humor, don‚Äôt cave to MOBS
@XCM_FunkX @fucku121 @KevinHart4real This is why people should #WalkAway
@PatriotMike6 Americans have been complacent for far too long, in CA they allowed illegals to get licenses 15 + years ago, and now the democrats are illegally registering them to vote when they get it.  		Conservatives need to start standing up to these haters of America and stop compromising
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump FYI, we like Lindsey 2.0 much better.
