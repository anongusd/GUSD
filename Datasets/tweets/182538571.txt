@roentgenwarrior @SenSanders You're talking as if government is a separate entity from the capitalist system, as if private power doesn't exist and doesn't capture the regulatory bodies that are designed to keep their greed in check.
@roentgenwarrior @SenSanders The government is just the captured executive wing of private businesses which acts as an extension of their greed. But the major source of greed is the corporation itself. Which is why they need to be kicked from the government.
@roentgenwarrior @SenSanders Tax policies aren't greed, they're used for programs which everyone in the society typically (or should) benefit from. Private sector is about maximizing profits for a minority of shareholders and minimizing the wages of employees as much as possible.

@KyleKulinski https://t.co/s0lA10KPs9
Renzo Prieto, the student leader who spent four years behind bars for organizing a 2014 protest; or the country’s elected National Assembly should be entitled to meddle in their own internal affairs—and get back only a stony-faced silence.
The anti-imperialist left in the West is demanding that the United States refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Venezuela. Fair enough. The trouble begins when you ask whether Venezuelans such as Luisa Ortega Díaz, Chávez’s former chief prosecutor-turned-dissident;
"Yet what is really frightening are those who, under the guise of anti-imperialism, consistently favor dictators—as long as they mouth anti-American platitudes."		https://t.co/s0lA10KPs9
@KyleKulinski Yes the U.S. interests in ridding the country of Maduro is self-serving, but I don't think countries around the world recognizing Guaido as interim can be characterized as an "illegal coup".
@KyleKulinski How is this an illegal coup Kyle? You're really missing the mark on the situation internally to the country. It's a revolt against an authoritarian leader who caused a constitutional crisis in 2017 and created a new wing of the government to consolidate his own power.

@RileyRayne177 @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 They were Marxist-Leninist states that had commodity production and wage labor, I.e. elements of capitalism. It's not accurate to call them socialist anymore than it is to call America a laissez-faire capitalist free market with it's massive state intervention into markets
@Bruwer6699 @adviseagainstit @JohnValjean5 @charliekirk11 Capitalism narrows luxury and power into a small minority of hands for the private owners of the economy and state. Socialism unlocks that luxury and access to the tools and means of subsistence to everyone by democratizing the means of production.
@vadimnewquist Don't forget "He's not a Democrat!!!!"
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Even so, there is no perfectly non-coercive human system. The Anarchists did a far better job at minimizing this than capitalists did when individual farmers in the U.S had their livelihoods completely destroyed as they were forced into the wage system.
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 No it does not. I was talking about the political assassinations, the collectivization in some instances which was forced by the nature of the civil war in some cases (which is debated) was not enforced through assassination of those who wished to opt out of the process.
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Political assassination was mostly against the fascist forces that were trying to kill people and take control of the society. It wasn't against people "foolishly disagreeing loudly" lol. Political assassinations occurred quite heavily in both the American and French Revolutions
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 It was a system put in place by worker's organizing democratically to control their own workplaces. It wasn't "against them" it was *by* them. Militant distress is how every single revolution in history as broken out, including the capitalist ones.
@FKNFairyPrinces @Kick_Back_Relax @mk2liv @natemcdermott "Why do women candidates have to be perfect but Bernie doesn't have to be?" No one is arguing this, this is a fantasy in your head. AOC is beloved and Warren is the 2nd choice among Sander's supporters.
@FKNFairyPrinces @Kick_Back_Relax @mk2liv @natemcdermott When did Bernie campaign for her? I don't see any articles on this anywhere through 2016 to 2018. So we shouldn't hold elected officials accountable for problematic policies? If she managed to pass M4A that'd be great but I'd be just as critical of Bernie if he did the same asher
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Mondragon is worker owned but not worker managed, they elect management. It's still a glimpse of an alternative form of organization that extends democracy to the workplace. It's an experimental blueprint for the broader society if it embraces socialist organization.
@Kriidah @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 The Spanish Revolution is a better example. You asked what it means for workers to have control, the Mondragon example is simply an example of a form of worker ownership inside a capitalist system.

@MoellerMatthew @JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Yea? You're right? socialism is for the people, it's the descriptive word meaning collective democratic control of society/workplaces.

@FKNFairyPrinces @mk2liv @natemcdermott How did he hijack the party? By making it accountable to it's base lol?
RT @gaywonk: *whispers* Capitalism and democracy are fundamentally incompatible.
@ItinerantCamel @HumanistReport This, I worry a bit about his health but I read that article in GQ where they described how he seems more energized than staff like 20 years his junior. It's a good sign, hope he lives into the 90s with good health.
@charliekirk11 "Illegals cost US taxpayers $135 billion a year" also misleading and mostly false. I'll have to check the rest but you clearly have no intellectual honesty. 		https://t.co/bz8NFHpd6e
@charliekirk11 "90% of all heroin comes across the border" Which comes through the border by legal means which some wall (that will never be built) is not going to curtail. If you want to end the illegal drug trade then legalize and regulate drugs.
@charliekirk11 Your claims of "facts" are misleading		“If you are asking if illegals commit crimes out of their proportion of the population as I said maybe, maybe not,” Camarota said. “Data is limited and it depends on who you compare them to.” https://t.co/VSyF2uQatx
@UltimateByeah @schticknic @BethLynch2020 Paid Russian operatives lol
@JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 He's either an asshole or maybe because it threatens his position in the hierarchy of the capitalist business model. Under capitalism, workers are forced into competition with each other which drives down wages. Whereas in socialism, work is run collectively and democratically.
@AOC They're basically doing for you, what CNN/MSNBC did for Trump. You're getting nonstop free media coverage, thanks @FoxNews keep up the good work.
@jivejiverson @BethLynch2020 Yea I actually just started using my Twitter again for the first time in 5 years. It feels like the majority of political stuff I've read on here about Bernie is people screaming in opposition. Maybe that's the same for all the other candidates though, idk.
@VicNobu @SeeYouAroundKid @BethLynch2020 Some of the craziest comments are people complaining "BUT HE'S NOT A DEMOCRAT!!!!" as if his party affiliation matters more than his policy positions.
@SeeYouAroundKid @BethLynch2020 Is it really paid trolls though? I've only recently started using Twitter and it's got me shook lol. Genuinely shocked by the Bernie hate from non-conservatives, I don't understand it.
@JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Sure there is, the Spanish Revolution of 1936 is one such example of a society built by worker control of the means of production. It was short-lived because it was crushed by the Spanish fascists and Stalinists, but it's an example of what could exist in the future.
@JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 What do you mean there's no such thing as worker control in a benign sense? There's worker cooperative workplaces all across America and much of the world. Mondragon is the largest example. None of them are run by governments. https://t.co/s72umL1Qx7
@BethLynch2020 Why do so many people hate Bernie Sanders on Twitter? I feel like I've probably been in a Youtube bubble for too long, every comment on videos about him is like 99% support.
@neoliberal4life @lisadubbels @joshorton Exactly, Trump is going to blast candidates with these corrupt records so easily despite his own insane corruption. All he has on Bernie is shrieks about Venezuela.
@GoldieAZ @joshorton @TomPerez What a fucking moronic comment lmao
@mk2liv @natemcdermott Like AOC? Sure, I will when she's old enough. I'm not voting based off someone's gender or race if they don't have the right policies though.
@genefoxjr @Kal_El_Lives @JCardwellNYC @natemcdermott @hunterw Who gives a fuck
@RT_ChrisDavis @ZVanDenBosch @Grandmomsshadow @bugzbony @Carrasquillo I'm not sure they "believe" in it as much as they're just jumping on the bandwagon because Sanders forced it.
@Carrasquillo He's got my support, don't really care about his age or race. He's the most consistent and principled politician I've seen in my lifetime.

@lyndaloo222 @BernieSanders Seen it. 		https://t.co/2BBzYTBcxR
@JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Socialism is collective/worker control of the means of production. No one is giving their earnings, you work according to your abilities and receive in according to the amount of your contribution.
@JohnValjean5 @Bruwer6699 @charliekirk11 Define socialism. Socialism = paying taxes? What is meant by "giving your earnings to the collective"?
@lyndaloo222 @BernieSanders I'm an anti-capitalist and I'm telling you now, she's no anti-capitalist. Universal healthcare and taxes on the wealthy isn't "anti-capitalism".
@lyndaloo222 @BernieSanders Instead of repeating stupid right wing strawman talking points, maybe read about the history of the situation in Venezuela and why it's economy is in shambles. If you think that would happen to the U.S economy if it adopted European social democracy you're insane.
@lyndaloo222 @BernieSanders Bernie and AOC are social democrats in the model of European countries. You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about and probably have no understanding of the differences between the U.S economy v. Venezuelan economy and why that matters in analyzing what happened in Ven

@charliekirk11 Wow big thinks, I'm sure it's definitely THAT simple.
@wi11iedigital @4NextGenofUSA @ByRosenberg @chrislhayes That's not my point, assume they couldn't be restaffed. My point is that Bezos would be nothing without profiting off the backs of workers.
@_merjc It's also because the US domestic economic interests that controls the state does not want countries that are outside its influence to influence others to go in the same independent path. It has nothing to do with caring about Democracy, that's a joke.
@_merjc Can't control as in, can't maintain business relations with that favors US investors. Cuba is an example and why there's been an economic embargo against them long after the CW ended. It's designed to force them to create a gov that will satisfy it's interests.This is documented
@_merjc There's a very long history of US support of fascist dictatorships in Latin America, incredibly brutal human rights abusers. There was no condemnations by the US for these and other dictatorships it's been supporting. It only condemns govs it can't control for access to markets.
@_merjc The US is not interested in democracy, if it was it wouldn't support 76% of the world's dictatorships. US history in LatinAmerica since Cold War has been one of supporting and actively facilitating coups against governments to install new governments that favor US investors.
@_merjc @Reuters Just because he's not a legitimate ruler does not mean his government doesn't exist. The military just backed him up over the opposition. The Trump adminstration has floated military involvement, it's not something we should become entangled with.

@4NextGenofUSA @ByRosenberg @chrislhayes Of course, what would happen to Amazon if every single worker simply stopped coming into work for a week? The entire company would collapse. That's how capitalism works, it's one of it's defining features...exploitation of workers for the benefit of a few individuals.
@Reuters Which I suspect may be the point. U.S is interested in control of markets there, it's history in Latin America is transparent.
@Reuters They need to all leave at this point, you can't just declare a government doesn't exist anymore over twitter because you don't like it. Let the people of Venezuela deal with their own country. Keeping diplomats there illegally can be used as a pretext for further escalation.

@mtracey The way I feel about it is that America should not be anointing the opposition leader as president, should instead follow @RepRoKhanna's advice on this one and allow the people of Venezuela to handle their own government. If they want Maduro out, that's their decision, not ours.
@dpakman @charliekirk11 @AOC I guess they have to avoid that though because it would be far harder for them to damn welfare state capitalism when it's worked far better than laissez-faire throughout history. Much easier to point to a Soviet boogyman strawman.
@HandleOfRy @Bernlennials I agree with both of you to be honest. I'm not going to scold AOC for trying to do something but I'm not losing sight of the need to go beyond reformism when the conditions are right.
@dpakman @charliekirk11 @AOC David, I can only wish people like Charlie would argue based off of an actual accurate representation of their policy positions. I'd have more respect for them if they did.
@charliekirk11 @AOC So is Marxism when you raise the marginal tax rate to 70 percent on income over 10 million? If so, then was America Marxist through the 40s to the 70s when the top rate went as high as 91%? What are her Marxist policies?
@dbongino There's absolutely nothing radical about Denmark or the U.K's healthcare system. And the countries haven't been destroyed by it either. So the facts are the opposite of what you're claiming here.
@dbongino They're promoting the European Social Democracy policies...you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I've yet to hear AOC or Sanders promote government ownership of the means of production. Raising taxes on wealthy people isn't socialism.
@ScottforFlorida @BernieSanders @ewarren They're promoting European social democractic policies you dunce.
