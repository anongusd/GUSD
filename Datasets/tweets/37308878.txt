@yesmam47 Napoleon gave Louisiana tertory to King of Spain in 1790s. When Jefferson Pushed Napoleon to sell it to US. Napoleon resisted. Then took it back from Spain, for it was rightfully his and Sold it to Jefferson Putin took back what is rightfully his.
@yesmam47 Let me make it clear. Nikita Khruschev anext Creamia from Russia in 1953 and made it part of Ukrainian. He did it because he could. Russia,  took back what belonged to it. Mostly they did it for strategic and legal reasons.
@yesmam47 You should  study Russian history since the year 862 so you will understand  more. At this point you have just an opinion which is unsubstantiated and uneducated. You sound like typical American Who  thinks she knows all,  but know nothing
@yesmam47 How do you know what you do not know? I was  born in Ukraine  during the Soviet Time. I believe  Creamia is part of Russia. I have spoken with people  in Creamia. They wanted to be part of Russia  rather  than part of Ukrainian. That is the fact. I want it to be part of Russia
@yesmam47 First if all. Creamia was part  of Russia. Before Khruschev made it Part  of Ukrainiane. So legally,  it is Russian real-estate. Moreover,  people  did vote for Creamia to become  part of Russian Federation. I watched Russian news channals during the voting process. People voted
@yesmam47 In a year Creamia  was annexed by Russian Federation. 2014. There were more Russians in Creamia than Ukrainians. So they voted to become  part if Russia. This is a documented  fact. Most Russian speaking people,  do not like Ukrainian culture and Language and Nationalism
Creamia  belonged to Russia. After Khruchev who was Ukrainian, got into the power, added Creamia to Ukraine. During USSR it did not matter. Now Russia  rightfully  got Creamia  back. Ukrainian nationalist are dangerous people. That is why people voted  it to be part Of Russia. https://t.co/XW4Ww8W5on

Dodgers  is going down big time.  Game v SF which  Jensen did not save  was a down word  spiral
Dodgers  are done  cooked  finished lol #Dodgers live
@DodgersNation when  Kennly  Jensen did not save  game  v Giants.  It was avalanche to loose  and fall  back behind Giants 6 1/2 now
@DodgersNation Kenly  Jensen  inability  to save  game  against  Giants  caused  Dodgers  fall 6 back.i think they  will fall  further
@GonzaleSports @Dodgers now dodgers  will loose.  He should  not  be managing  major league.
@GonzaleSports @Dodgers agree,  Roberts  looses  many  games  due to  his stupidity,  managing pitchers. Urias should  have pitched and win
@Dodgers Urias  was pitching a good game.  Although  he had 80+ pitches., Roberts should  have  gave him a chance to pitch 1 more inn 2 win

@CJJ1267 I hope  Warren is correct.
@mdudas if SQ  could  work with e commerce  companies,  like eBay  Etsy.  Etc that would  be money in a bank  deal.
@mdudas if SQ will get  to profitability, this  year, as promised it could go Way Up.  But in a mean time  it is a trading range stock

@c4u4b6s8 @Dodgers 200% so.  I looked  at his technique,  he had great delivery. He should  pitch.  Kershaw  then right  hander  and Urias

@c4u4b6s8 @Dodgers I liked Urias.  They should  leave  him here.  He and Kershaw,  2 left handers  would dominate.
@c4u4b6s8 @Dodgers Agree,  bullpen  and  couple  starting pitchers,  without Kershaw they would  be in last place. They are  already falling

@Ruthless_Turtle well  at least  Urias did not get a loss.  Hatcher,  Baez and Roberts  must be let go. We loose games because  of them.
@Dodgers please  fire Hatcher  Baez and  Roberts
@Dodgers Dodgers  ownership.  Please get rid of Hatcher  Baez and Dave  Roberts. We are loosing because  if this 3 persons
@Dodgers here  you go again.  freaking Baez and Hatcher

@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers what do you  think about  Kevin Kennedy  as  a Manager?
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers Neither  Mattingly  nor  Roberts,  use  fundamentals. Bunting with 2 on no one out . Manufacturing runs
@Ruthless_Turtle Dodgers  are  falling  down. Team looses  momentum.  They should  have hired  Kevin Kennedy to manage. Roberts not  ready
Team  with $250,000,000 payroll  has less  than minor  league  pitching  is an embarrassment.
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers agree  100% Baez  and hatcher  has to go. Urias should  be in rotation. He will double well.
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers 1006 agreed  what do you think  about  Kevin  Kennedy  as a manager?
@Ruthless_Turtle I think Urias should  stay in rotation. Dodgers  are  done  in 2016 they should  have hired Kevin  Kennedy to manage
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers ,Agree.  Hatcher has to go. Urias should  stay.  Dodgers is done in 2016 even years are Giants years since 2010
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers when strikling pitched no hitter  Roberts took him off.  Brought Hatcher.  2 run  home run.  Dodgers lost
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers I agree.  Front office and Hatcher. When Roberts bring hatcher game  is lost. Strikling is in minor. Due to Hatcher
@Ruthless_Turtle True.  Kaufax  had horrible  first 6 years  of his career. This kid need to be on a team and practice. Dodgers done in 2016
@theReal_D_Rose @Dodgers Dodgers are done,  cooked. Roberts is a wrong  manager. Hatcher is subotaguer. Kevin Kennedy would  be great mngr
Giants is  winning.  Roberts kills Dodgers  with inability  to manage Fire Roberts  and Hatcher
Roberts  brings Hatcher  to loose  games. Is ownership stupid  or what.
@GonzaleSports Chris  Hatcher is s reason  Strikling in  the  minor.  Roberts  brings him and hatcher helps dodgers to lose fire  Robers6
How  and why Robets  brings Hatcher? He is a looser.  Dodgers is loosing  Giants  is winning #Dodgers #Fan
@MikeSGallagher Fernando became  superstar.  Urias became has been kid is done
@MikeSGallagher He could  have been next Kershaw  or next has been. He is not ready for  major league.  May never be ready.  Trade him
@MikeSGallagher certain things  you  can not learn. Some figure  skaters and gynmasts Olympic champs by 16
@Ruthless_Turtle You  have to do your  best in debut. Hi was weak and wild.  Granderson almost had double  to begin with  kid is not ready
@MikeSGallagher Dodgers  should  trade  Urias.  If you  do not survive on a first day.  You are not focusing he is not ready. Send him back
@Ruthless_Turtle Urias was  wild.  He does not  belong in majors.
@MikeSGallagher kid was wild.  He does  not belong  in major league

@darnellyummyjr @DodgersNation age should  not matter.  It is a mental state.  ,Kaufax was horrible,  his  first 6 years.
@EHernandezTV he is not going to survive  today.  Hope they give him few more chances
@EHernandezTV it was a positive  experience.  He needs to hang out with team to get assimilated. He flew  in from minors
@EHernandezTV after  strikling out first two  batters.  Had he  struck out 3rd  he would  have been on a cloud 9
@EHernandezTV he was not sharp to begin with. He almost allowed  base hit to granderson. Then struck him out.
@EHernandezTV true,  too many pitches. Hope he survives  5 innings and  hope dodgers  score  than Mets
@EHernandezTV 1st major  league  inning had 2 strike  outs.  Kershaw like  performance.
@EHernandezTV hope  dodgers  will explode,  score  runs.  Urias  seem  at ease  now
@EHernandezTV @DodgersNation I am rooting for him. He does well  drinking first 2 batters
@EHernandezTV @DodgersNation I think he will settle down.  Hope dodgers score  some runs for him

@EHernandezTV @DodgersNation    I agree  100% Urias will be Great  pitcher.  I believe  first inning Double  play killed his  momentum.
@EHernandezTV @DodgersNation Uriashad a bad luck.  1st inning double  play,  killed momentum. I hope he will  recover and  Dodgers score
@Buster_ESPN Urias  has bad luck. double play Momentum killer in first  inning.
@McCulloughTimes he is a great pitcher. First inning double play  killed momentum.  I knew  game was over. That is a bad luck  for the  kid
First inning  bobble play killed momentum.  I new game was over.
