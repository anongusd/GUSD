@LilMadBenMax @MrsRabbitResist When I've read the case it DID/does seem like something they'd care about!
Unrestrained by the need to balance its own 	interests against the states‚Äô, Congress has felt free to 	expand federal criminal law well beyond the scope 	envisioned at the founding and even through the mid-	twentieth century, and the states have been powerless 	to resist.
For POTUS to pardon ANYBODY on state level for any "reason" is an unconstitutional violation of a state's rights to enforce laws amongst it's citizens within its borders, not to mention stepping on the toes of EVERY state Gov whose prerogative that is!
As with so many issues in the DJT era, this is BIGGER THAN POLITICS! Whether R or D, an [indirect] attack on the "sovereignty" of one state has the same effect on all the others. States are the only thing standing between ordinary people &amp; Caesaropapist govt!
That's an enormous amount of power for states to give DC. STATE'S RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT &amp; STATE LAWS ARE BINDING! Keeping Kavanaugh off the bench would be the states last chance to preserve some measure of autonomy... &amp; DIGNITY!
... the "authority" of Govs &amp; mayors, state legislatures &amp; state Supreme Court's gleefully knocking their heads against the ground in emasculating awe of the God like powers of Washington! ...States no longer able to tell their citizens what to do?
Changes in the law can work both ways! Who's to say another Bill Clinton won't get into office &amp; decide he wants to pardon his henchmen doing his dirty work in the most conservative states? ...state &amp; local laws become moot -- trampled over by presidential pardon?
Separate Sovereigns underpins the CONSERVATIVE principle of state's rights. If a POTUS can pardon crimes on the state level &amp; prevent states from prosecuting certain individuals, [the people of] the states can't regulate their own affairs or enforce their own laws! (1

Just to prove my point...		CHALLENGE:		TURN YOUR PHONE OFF &amp; name all eight SC Justices!
...&amp; contrary to popular myth, R's care about their local district judges &amp; prosecutors but the SC is a distant institution to ALL OF US! The ONLY Republicans who CARE about SC &amp; who think there's still a chance in Hell on overturning Roe are the Fed Soc &amp; Heritage Fdn!!
...tell me, what ONE PIECE of lgsl'n will they pass with THIS two year maj?		Who wants to be "corralled" to the polls every two years only to get ONE THING done? DC is HIS HOUSE -- he should be able to move Heaven &amp; earth with the maj he ALREADY has!!
R's run DC lock, stock, &amp; barrel &amp; -- in two years -- the only dom lgsl'n they've passed is the Tax Deform Bill which, to me, DOESN'T COUNT since the tariffs cancel out whatever "benefits" one might THINK they've "gained!"
As a matter of fact, it's not clear to me what Trump "Republicans" are even voting for! If the purpose of dragging POTUS onto the cpgn trail to rile up his "base" so they can get a maj... THEY HAVE A MAJ NOW that they're not doing shit with!! Why even vote &amp; STILL nothing?
We must be fair to the party in power... They COULD get a lot more done if not for POTUS!		In a sick &amp; twisted way, DJT is our saving grace because we'd be in MUCH WORSE SHAPE under an EFFECTIVE POTUS!!		...yet, they can't stop voting for his candidates!!!
The same guy said the same thing about ACA; but their failure to "repeal " replace -- their failure to RUN WASHINGTON at all -- doesn't stop anyone WHO'S GONNA VOTE from voting!
So... In my FB group, there was FIERCE, but civil, debate about Tax Deform Bill last year. On the other side was a professed R urging people NOT TO VOTE R if they didn't pass Tax Deform! (That's why I don't buy this "we must confirm BK!") The guys name on fb was Boris Godunovski
