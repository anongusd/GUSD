@RepMarkMeadows Aren’t you interested in whether the Prez broke the law? Doesn’t seem so. You, sir, are an embarrassment to North Carolina.
@MSNBC C’mon, @MSNBC, keep your eye on the ball. The central issue from the hearing so far is not Roger Stone phone call, racism, con man or cheat, or even Trump Tower meeting. It’s the campaign finance crime. Subpoena to AW will corroborate.
@LindseyGrahamSC @VP Lindsey, the only way to make a case like that is to lie through your teeth. What has happened to you?
@realDonaldTrump Make America grotesque again...
@senrobportman Nonsense. Border security MADE this bust. A wall would have been irrelevant. There is no crisis.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, you shameless toady. That happened on Nov. 8, 2016–with Russia’s help...
@JohnCornyn It is outrageous! The House has passed a series of bills to reopen govt., and @senatemajldr won’t bring them to the Senate floor. Guess he can’t fulfill his constitutional duty from inside Trump’s pocket. Convince him to #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown
@SenThomTillis @SenatorCollins You picked the right word, Thom—incredible...
@SenSasse Read your statement re: Kavanaugh. The truncated FBI report aside (with only nine interviews and no leads followed), does it not bother you that Kavanaugh lied to the committee?
@JeffFlake Did I miss something? What happened to “We can’t have this (temperament) on the court?
@OrrinHatch Listening to you in the press conference. You, sir, are a disgrace to public office. This “honest man” lied to the committee. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out of the Senate.
@tedcruz Comparison? You mean a likable guy who speaks his mind vs. a sniveling coward who has done a complete flip-flop on Trump and can't be trusted?
@sendavidperdue What? Did being forced to respond--or not--to citizens with relevant questions make you uncomfortable? You refuse to communicate with the people who elected you. No surprise that they make use of an available opportunity. You are accountable--and must face reelection.
@senorrinhatch The "I like beer; I still like beer" defense was particularly effective.
@jasoninthehouse What about Trump's mocking of Dr. Ford during his speech in Mississippi? Don't you have daughters? Aren't you the same guy who disavowed Trump when the Access Hollywood tape came out? Now you're his lackey. Dance, puppet!
@senorrinhatch Senator, that is so disingenuous. A thorough investigation demands FBI interviews with all parties, including all potential witnesses. What matters is the truth, not political game-playing.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He mocked her. Own it.
@JeffFlake You are absolutely right, Senator. We can't have a man of Kavanaugh''s temperament and partisanship on the highest court in the land. Please hold that thought. Our democracy demands better. (PS--You didn't get the thorough investigation you demanded.)
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Any comment on Trump's classless mocking of Dr. Ford? This is the man whose boots you're licking.
@LindseyGrahamSC Oh, please, Senator. It is patently obvious that Kavanaugh lied and misrepresented material facts in his testimony before the committee. I once thought you were worthy of respect. Now you're a pawn for a man you once called a fraud and a con man. He hasn't changed. You have.
@senatemajldr This FBI investigation is a sham. The WH says FBI can pursue all leads, but clearly that is not the case. I hope some of your GOP colleagues continue to insist on a full and fair investigation and delay a vote until that happens. Are you listening, @JeffFlake?
@FoxNews @senatemajldr That's the nuttiest thing I've heard all week. Can't believe he could say it with a straight face.
@sendavidperdue Your statement is misleading. The so-called "three witnesses" have not refuted Dr. Ford's allegations. Two of them were not in the room when the alleged attack occurred. The third, Mark Judge, did not say it didn't happen. He said he didn't remember. Put him under oath.
@michellemalkin Good luck with that. Only three precincts in the entire state voted Republican in 2008.
@jasoninthehouse I'd give you a horn to blow, but you already have one of your own. #DeepDookie
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary How about your woeful inaction on pausing the hearings and delaying the vote for a full investigation of all charges? The only consolation is that your grotesque posturing at the hearing probably helped your Senate opponent. #SenatorSmarmy #LyinTed
@JeffFlake Dear Senator, your entire legislative career will be remembered for your vote on Friday. You have a chance to be a true American hero. It's up to you. Demand a full investigation before a vote.
@LindseyGrahamSC Not that there was much questioning involved. More like overplayed righteous indignation. Was that your screen test for the AG's job?

@marklevinshow Heartbreaking that this man was nominated for the Supreme Court. As an aside, Trump won't like the sniveling...
@IngrahamAngle If you like belligerence... Straight from the Trump playbook.
@SenBillCassidy Well, Senator, there is an eyewitness, who was never called, and whose story has changed. Mark Judge should be subpoenaed to testify under oath. Simple as that.
@JohnCornyn You can't possibly see whether burden of proof is met without an independent investigation and testimony from an alleged eyewitness. And what about all the other allegations? Do they not bear investigation, too? You'll need a warehouse-sized rug to sweep all this under.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Is that all you've got? Could you possibly be any more boorish? Lots of us would prefer not to fly but do so out of necessity--or for the reward of a vacation that outweighs the discomfort. Doesn't mean it's not an ordeal in both cases.

@marklevinshow A spectacular flop, don’t you mean? I’m assuming you heard the waves of laughter at his ridiculous boast...
@SenateMajLdr That’s a complete misrepresentation of fact, Senator. FBI should investigate all allegations, Mark Judge should be subpoenaed to testify under oath, and Senators on the Judiciary should have the courage to question Dr. Ford themselves...
As you should be. So do something. Vote against Kavanaugh, whose appointment to @Scotus will only embolden a President already running roughshod over the rule of law... https://t.co/Gn6W2sjUOU
@SenatorBurr @FtBraggNC @camp_lejeune Dear Senator, please work across the aisle—and with your colleague @SenThomTillis to protect Mr. Mueller and his investigation.
@MalcolmNance @LeaBlackMiami Had to be blind not to see this coming.
Dear @MSNBC Please stop running the incessant footage of Rosenstein leaving his house. It’s ridiculous. And why has no one on your network mentioned that the NYT story being used as a pretext to fire Rosenstein was a White House plant?
@jasoninthehouse @FoxNews @NextRevFNC Has it appeared yet on the New York Times’ fiction list?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump That collapse began when you and your cronies robbed the President of his constitutional authority to appoint a Supreme Court justice. Remember Merrick Garland?
@TeamTedCruz @tedcruz We all believe that the vast majority of police officers are brave, honorable men and women, but we also must hold the ones who aren't accountable. That's why I'm voting for Beto!
@DeanHeller And you're a Trump person, who used to be an anti-Trump person. Isn't that right, #SenatorHiccup?
@ChuckGrassley The only thing that should be conducted, Senator, is an FBI investigation--the same sort you supported in the Anita Hill case.
@RepMattGaetz @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews You mean that story planted by the administration to undermine the Deputy AG? Idiocy.
@JohnCornyn @tedcruz @jamesdickey @TexasGOP Then you must have observed how absolutely unlikeable #SenatorSmarmy aka #LyinTed is.

@realDonaldTrump @GeraldoRivera Time to give up this insane argument. You're just making yourself look worse and worse...
@SenDeanHeller @NewsTalk780KOH Did he ask you how it feels to be a lame duck #SenatorSpineless?
@SpeakerRyan And blew up the deficit in the process. And now your new plan will add another $3.8 trillion to the debt. When did you abandon conservative principles? The end game is to cut Social Security and Medicare in a cyncial betrayal of public trust. Good thing you're a short-timer now.
@thehill His pleas may not have much to do with the White House, but his cooperation will. He's 1) the first cooperating witness who was actually in the Trump Tower meeting; 2) the architect of the change to the platform plank on Crimea invasion, presumably on candidate's orders.
@thehill Another "witch" bites the dusty. They're coming for you, Warlock-in-Chief.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS So why did WH deny funding to states that wanted to combat election system hacking?
@JohnCornyn The justice system works. Caught, prosecuted and deported. Can you cite millions of other cases (per Trump)? Thousands? Hundreds? Any?

@tedcruz Nothing wrong with being popular. You should try it some time, Ted.
@JohnCornyn You’re proceeding with this farce?
@SenatorCollins So please act as an American now and vote no on Kavanaugh. 1) he’s against Roe, no matter what he told you; 2) he lied to the committee; 3) he’s facing some serious questions about past behavior. Way too much baggage to sit on the court.
@HouseGOP That last statement will become true on first Tuesday of November.
@rob_bennett @SenatorCollins I'll give to her Dem challenger no matter which way Collins votes. She got played on the tax cut, too.

@senrobportman @OhioState You do that, Senator. But it should look familiar. Urban Meyer and Brett Kavanaugh have a lot in common--when it comes to problems with the truth.
@senrobportman @FoxNews @BensonAndHarf Oversight work of Congress? You're kidding, right? You and the rest of your toady colleagues have abdicated your oversight responsibilities. Worry less that Dems have released papers that all Americans ought to see and more about your willingness to appoint a proven liar.
@SenateMajLdr Those weren't the same hearings I saw, Mr. Leader. Far from brilliance, I saw a man who had issues with the truth and a man who was trying to sell the committee members a bill of goods when it came to his past writings. To me, he's undeserving of a lifetime appointment.
@TeamTedCruz Is this the same Ted Cruz who called Trump a charlatan and a con man on the campaign trail, then begged him to come to Texas to rally in his support?
@SenTedCruz @MariaBartiromo @FoxBusiness Oh, Ted, I will lose no time in watching it--literally.
@SenatorCollins Dear Senator Collins. Do you really take seriously Brett Kavanaugh's assurances that Roe v. Wade is settled law? His writings belie that assurance. You have been played before by Trump and McConnell. Fool you twice, shame on you. Please vote no.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump When did you become Trump's chief toady, Senator? When did he promise you the Attorney General's job? Trump hasn't changed since the days of the campaign. You clearly have. Remember what you said then? Your credibility now is zero.

@ChuckGrassley You're not exercising your constitutional power to check and balance when you fall into line like the meekest of sheep. The President only shares power with Congress, when the majority party in Congress has the courage to exercise that power.
The Chief Kangaroo, aka @ChuckGrassley, was completely wrong in not allowing a vote on adjournment of Kavanaugh hearing. Nothing in committee rules restricts such a motion to executive session.
@thehill Thank you, @SenSasse for standing up for the justice system today. Now please put your vote where your mouth is. It would be equally wrong to confirm a Supreme Court justice appointed by a man who seeks to undermine the DOJ and law enforcement at every turn.
