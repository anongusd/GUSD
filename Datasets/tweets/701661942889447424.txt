@tomkarlo @ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump The courts have yet to find him liable for anything pertaining to Russia, try again.
@domdew25 @ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump So all im gathering from your manifestó is that no sane person could like Trump. ( Which in of itself is insane)
@DaisyVivaldi @ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump I don't watch Fox, but thanks for confirming your own bias, where you only watch and listen to anything that isn't fox
@sjhaddow @ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump Oh how convenient!! When they don't fit the Russian collusion agenda they're fake news!!
@FluffTheGemini @ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump Yeah and people in the investigation have said that to MSNBC, but you're quick to link him to a Russian collusion, before the investigation is over, but I'm jumping the gun when the very same organizations you believe and trust say there's nothing there?? https://t.co/B1F9cHHcK3 https://t.co/b2VETQI8vY
@ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump In before im labeled a Russian bot, let me steal their thunder.
@ajforn @clcdugan @steph93065 @weathervanejay @realDonaldTrump It must be nice to just live in a bubble where if someone says something I don't like,I label then a Russian bot, also didn't MSNBC just release a story where the Senate committee found no collusion?? Damn it feels good to be a gangster.

@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta Where do you get your facts to say a majority? Statistics are BS, sample sizes don't translate to the complete population, secondly name a single president with an approval rating above 58%, George Washington doesn't count... So what have we learned? You cannot please everyone.
@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta It isn't an obsession, he made a promise to the American people, he's keeping his promise to us, unlike lifer polítican's that talk sweet and never follow through.
@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta Opinions may differ, definitions do not, he isn't blackmailing or extorting anyone.
@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta Importance and relevance, now THOSE things are open to interpretation, I say that if my life is uneffected by those my tax dollars fund, they must not of been doing much in the first place, secondly Schumer has denied 2 different proposals to reopen the govt...
@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta Yes and you're cherry picking what *portion* of the definition to use, sorry grammar doesn't work that way, a definition is definitive, quite literally, not open for interpretation...
@aaronvanlaan @gwo_design @RonWyden @senatemajldr You just contradicted yourself, you do realize that yes?
@jalagiwolfhart @RonWyden @senatemajldr What the Liberals in this country don't remember, Republicans are Americans too, keep it shut down until we get our wall, secondly it doesn't seem we need the government all that much, my life is completely unaffected by this shutdown.
@_Gamer1986 @CassandraRules How do you have this foresight? Journalistic instinct? You must work for CNN. Oh, what's that? Wishful thinking isn't concrete facts?
@SidneySD2012 @Acosta Really? Because they've been talking about it for 2 days, try watching something other than CNN.
@_arturo_albion_ @CassandraRules @TeamAmericaMOFO Where is the proof of the conspiracy? Witness tampering? That's all they've even charged him with, not even convicted him on
@Mariterri0607 @ElizabethEThorp @InSpiteOfTrump @CassandraRules CNN was doing their job, yes because we've seen so many FBI raids caught on camera, oh wait that's right they're kept private to insure he safety of the person being charged with crimes, and the agents involved, silly me.
@akelsey1991 @SenTomCotton You're not American, your opinion about our senators is irrelevant, go handle your substitute teacher prime minister then give us a call
@litboybrew @SenTomCotton What law enforcement activities have been shut down?
@tracymcguire13 @Acosta Fabricated? You might deem it unnecessary but last I counted there's over 300M Americans, you do not speak for them, thankfully Trump does.
@SidneySD2012 @Acosta He was set to announce it before the raid, maybe keep with current events and not just what they want to tell you.
@kathrynjt @nprpolitics Good thing it's a statement from npr and not stone, those quotations placement matter
@RealTonyRiggio @nprpolitics Ironic how the quotations end before making any mention of that, must be that journalistic instinct I keep hearing about today. Also you might want to look up the Rico statues, it doesn't remotely apply here
@joe719 @nprpolitics He could literally pardon him on all federal charges, learn what powers Trump has first before such an asinine claim, maybe?
@JSzen @nprpolitics @NPR Still nothing to do with Russia, imagine that.
@AngryMongo @nprpolitics You must not know about the Florida homestead laws.
@TalishaLoa @HarperHornaday @cynthiaherrick_ @nprpolitics What are you talking about? Do you even understand what pleading the 5th is? It literally states you don't have to self incriminate.... Learn what you speak of before you spew nonsense.
@NYCwondergirl @realmagaflag @nprpolitics Yeah? So where are the formal charges associated with that claim?? We're still waiting on that.
@gatormason @nprpolitics This statement literally doesn't make sense. Secondly, would you like to show me how his charges are related to the Russia investigation? Lying to Congress=/= Russia...
@Jmylessmiles @nprpolitics Yes lock up anyone associated with Trump on anything *but* Russian interference, I mean that was why this counsel was created in the first place, right? 18 months later and they're finding anything but that evidence, fancy that. https://t.co/u2Vpux4Hj2
@gatormason @nprpolitics And not a single charge against either Stone or Manafort has to do with Russia, fancy that.
@widtap @nprpolitics Cohen is spineless, and stone is accused of obstruction, not anything resembling collusion.
@JoeConchaTV Will the publisher release his diary in the original format? I'd love to see what crayons @Acosta uses to complain about Trump and his administration.
@colinjones @vicenews Ah yes, referencing The Godfather, this clearly proves Russian collusion.

@NumbersMean @kodzhabasheva @RealJamesWoods He promised it (Trump,) and delivered.

@kodzhabasheva @RealJamesWoods He hasn't put any effort? Are you kidding me right now? The market spiked when he took office, learn about the economy and how the market works, not how you think and feel it works, the actual fundamentals behind it.

@AOskomaOfficial @politico Poor opinion, rambling, pushing your own narrative, yep you should apply for a position in @politico, you'd fit right in.
@politico The story that the white men earned their jobs and didn't expect it handed to them? Also what is she doing in this picture? Is a psychic? Is she trying to brain wash people using the Jedi mind trick?

@omuniz21xx @eugenegu The Democrats are using their own wand to claim this victory for Obama.
@Dashman1052 @CliffStraham @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Those 0% interest rates didn't help any huh? What was it Obama said right before Trump took office? "How does he expect to hit 4% GDP? Does he have a magic wand?" Presto chango, this has now become Obama's victory. https://t.co/krBHtw9yYY

@DavidCThatsMe @Acosta It sounds like you don't know the definition of blackmail, let us know once you've googled it.
@BirdBrain2017 @darryljaydee @KEMPSAIDWHAT @Acosta He doesn't need to close a deal when he can circumvent the bureaucracy and declare a national emergency and build the wall anyways, he's just showing the true colors of life time polítican's that can't do any good for this country unless they get their cut first.
@WTFizHappening @Acosta If by cracking you mean cracking down on frivolous spending by lifer politician's, then yeah I agree.
@dcexaminer And this is news because? How? It isn't like other wealthy businessmen haven't requested the same exact thing, go back to journalism not forcing Americans to live in the reality satire of The (Truman) Trump Show, thanks!   --Signed every single American.

@aengland818 @eugenegu Imagine being so petty you have to always talk down on people's faith and religious views, Im agnostic myself but I don't go around pissing on everyone else's parade, try keeping your negative feelings to yourself, we all inhabit this planet, not just you.

@Jakeman65 @JeremyB36496024 @thehill Thank you, and same to you.

@OttleyJam @turd_herder @AngeloRayGomez @realDonaldTrump Yes make it about the investigation now because your first comment was so good.

@sonnyandsam @realannapaulina @JackPosobiec @POTUS So circumvent them, activate the national guard, activate the militias in the border states, call on the governors to stand up, protect the border at all costs.
@realannapaulina Of course your liberal governors wouldn't participate, but that isn't the point, show unity in force, support the border, otherwise we're neither sovereign or a nation.

@Haliban85 @ivehadit6 @BernieSanders And half the constituents want it and half don't, so which do they represent? Which do they pick? Yeah I'm sure you're selflessly choosing your own side, it's virtuous.
@Haliban85 @ivehadit6 @BernieSanders That's awesome, still waiting for a response, as it was indeed directed at you all along.
@ivehadit6 @Haliban85 @BernieSanders motherfucker, ya im taking a nap long story short haven't slept is my lack of attention to detail.
@ivehadit6 @Haliban85 @BernieSanders then im a little confused by why you had first said "you mean all politicians", but if we're in agreement no reason to be hostile about it and realize we had a miscommunication, but were 100% on the same paragraph.
@ivehadit6 @Haliban85 @BernieSanders Not all politicians agree with this, so why should all politicians have to give up 70% of their wealth, exactly what do you mean by "exactly"?
@Haliban85 @ivehadit6 @BernieSanders well no, see i just recently learned that you don't just have to pay what you owe in taxes, you very well make donations to the treasury of what you feel you deserve to pay, so why aren't these liberal politicians utilizing this?

@SinSincere @JoiseyJoh @MrDanZak Oh look unwarranted opinion. No facts  can be  backed by data, nothing supports this as a fact, you're conflating issues, happy holidays!
@ConservativePTZ Well shit, who won? now I'm  stuck in this abyssal world where I don't know the answers to such questions, clearly the army did not prepare me.
@jjaone @RJ_Killmex All data suggests a 180 pivot, c'mon be honest :).
@MuellerIsHere @achutank @cnni , my tale might as well be a Dr. Suess adventure; going from belly up to belly down we've contrived this state of affairs.. God damn it, I want unity, I want us to come together and resolve our issues, these type of conversations, and declarations do NOT lead towards that.. 2/2
@MuellerIsHere @achutank @cnni I'm beyond assured my comments are quite vulgar, and even diminishing. I'm not trying to accomplish a shutdown, or silencing of the press, I want to discuss things, and disagree with each other, it's our god given right [Said the Agnostic] 1/2
@MuellerIsHere @achutank @cnni Oh I'm definitely addicted to conflict, could you diagnose what personality disorders lead to this? I know what I am, I just want to judge what your curriculum taught you! You are that type of doctor, correct? If not , what type of physician are you?
@achutank @MuellerIsHere @cnni You seem quite capable of liking a comment rather than defending your stance on it, @MuellerIsHere.. ;) Could it be that you're just being politically bias? No facts  behind your notion??
@MuellerIsHere @JasonSnowbeard @cnni I can very well reverse this question.. what have YOU proven? You've dedicated yourself to become a doctor in a field an yet to even be relevant in the field, come at me bro?
@achutank @MuellerIsHere @cnni I'll never argue against this or the facts, just saying. read what I'm actually calling this fucker out on ;).
@MuellerIsHere @cnni For someone claiming to have a Ph.D it doesn't seem you particularly focused on history, as this very thing you're wishing for has occurred in our history, time and time again......
@ResistXIIXVXIX @thehill Has it? tell me about those alleged changes in the past 150 years? Can you? Or are you just pointing out what you consider to be argumentative. pivotal, not honestly of no relevance in the courts?
@JasonSnowbeard @MuellerIsHere @cnni receptive or deaf to the situation, tell me how that alleviates from the situation itself?
@ResistXIIXVXIX @beingbev @thehill @RadioNational Emoji spam isn't showing, or spreading facts, you know this yes?
@MuellerIsHere @JasonSnowbeard @cnni What cultures have been destroyed? Whom is bringing up Muslims EXCEPT you? I'm sure these type of stunts work in the east, but here in the West we don't buy this very clear, BULLSHIT.
@JasonSnowbeard @MuellerIsHere @cnni Ok? What have you proven aside from stupidity on the idiots part? Nothing?
@SonOfAlgos @CBSNews but it never reminded you of her apologetic statements towards Assad, the irony is thick, and virtually uncut, gag on it fucker.
@CBSNews Assad's puppet trying to talk shit, the irony.
@beingbev @ResistXIIXVXIX @thehill @RadioNational I will most definitely disprove this article, it doesn't take much effort as they're not very disingenuous.
@beingbev @ResistXIIXVXIX @thehill @RadioNational "They've gone back to the old formula that lost them the last two presidential elections." yet we won the presidency??...
@MuellerIsHere @cnni I would hope someone with a PH.D would be a little more receptive to this.
@beingbev @ResistXIIXVXIX @thehill @RadioNational According to what facts? Because facts show they're more alike than opposites?
@AnnetteSadler @TIME And here I thought I was the only one that saw it, woohoo.
@heckyessica @RealJamesWoods Keep it up, I need an ex-wife.

@BeElliotwagner @thehill Sigh, here I go disproving bullshit... Tell me good sir how you know for a "fact" that the Republicans lost the house majority vote, by "9 million", I really want to see what you consider to be a fact or even a factor here...

@Kmac75259044 @KoalityCaleb @wikileaks I suppose I should've not been an asshole, or even helpful to begin with? You don't hurl stones at an individual and expect them to remain silent about it -- I was not remotely offensive until I was insulted first.

Here's some real facts, aside from the trolling: I have Aussie friends, they're some of the most wonderful people i know
@Cranky_Old_Guy @guzmman566 @benshapiro But we just admitted, and agreed the people of London have a higher homicide rate?  So how could it be that, when the very data we recite is showing us otherwise?
@mastodonkey @michaeljknowles Haha, it was STILL appreciated, good friend.
@Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro It's relevant to the conversation, whether cordial or not that we're participating in.
@Cranky_Old_Guy @guzmman566 @benshapiro But London has a higher homicide rate than NYC? Which has no guns??? Explain that one to me, Sherlock. Could it be that guns are irrelevant??? Are people going to use any means to commit murder and mass atrocities???
@Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro Whether we are, or are not an entire continent does not change my statement about what can be found on a continent, you realize this correct?
@greysquirrells @ABC You're a ranting, raving lunatic. Obama was more of a threat to reporters than Trump ever has been, track records, investigations, and indictments do not lie.
@JillBartolomei @ABC He's expressing his contempt to abide by the notion that the crowned prince killed the journalist, if this video leads you to believe he's rationalizing, we did not watch the same footage, incomprehensible.
@LALewman @ABC He gets paid far more to be a business man than a politician, realize the sacrifice this man is making for EVERY American..
@ABC My Potus seems to know his shit, keep up the good work!
@Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro We're apart of an entire continent, if you want to measure dick sizes which country is larger?
@Cranky_Old_Guy @guzmman566 @benshapiro Are you trying to say America has a mass shooting problem then? Because in reality we have a bunch of sycophants that lie and change what constituents a school, or mass shooting.
@Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro Yeah... You go ahead and enjoy all that, as if it isn't found on all continents or something... https://t.co/pooFGorZCg
@Cranky_Old_Guy @guzmman566 @benshapiro Sounds like the state of affairs in America then.
@guzmman566 @Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro Shit, it seems your rhetoric has been disproven by a local, I don't need to go further.
@tf2 @claherron @mdornic @hardovski @caroline_mkelly traitors, not me, so if anything you should stop crying/whining about the civil war? As no one but you has brought it up, or even mentioned it? 2/2
@tf2 @claherron @mdornic @hardovski @caroline_mkelly I'll listen to the Mueller investigation, which conveniently seems to of forgotten it's Russian related, and foreign related charges! I was never whining about the civil war? For some strange reason you thought it made your argument more relevant to have the blood of 1/2
@Cranky_Old_Guy @benshapiro No one wants to live in Australia, even Australian's hate Australia.
@tf2 @claherron @mdornic @hardovski @caroline_mkelly It isn't a fact, facts are backed by evidence, which this 'fact" is not, if anything the "fact" shows no Russian involvement.. Who is fighting the civil war?.. Indeed the war was lost, slavery is illegal, so what is there to get over?
@guardian Do you guys ever get tired of being full of shit? Literally read maybe, 30-40 words from your article, so here I am upset because of the level of misrepresentation you bring. Can you stop lying? Is that even possible for your organization???...
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian a copy of the statue without permission, when statues and likeness of Baphomet existed for how many decades? Push, and pander this  here bullshit to others, the residence do not believe this.
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian I'm not listening because they're bullshit facts backed by nothing other than your own morose, grandiose statements, did you expect me to support you from the grave because you were GOP?
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian Do you? Okay Mr, or Mrs. Librarian (you can correct us, as I want this to be as interactive as possible,)  Tell us what you know about copyrights as a whole that the rest of us don't?
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian Except we return to the first part, which either ironically, or coincidentally you've seem to of let out, how is it relevant again?
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian Didn't you also just prove my point? Whom asked for the artistic endeavor Which ended up translating to the likeness and artistic portrayal of Baphomet?
@ABC @FiveThirtyEight Aye MOTHERFUCKER, are you trying to start another civil war over this ? We Mac &amp; Cheese individuals pride ourselves on this national tradition, are you trying to tell us we're invalidated and or wrong???? https://t.co/BMP401Tb4z
@mastodonkey @michaeljknowles THE FIRST WITCH LOLOLOL.THIS MOTHERFUCKER SAID RBG IS THE FIRST SALEM'S WITCH TRAIL RECIPIENT... Whoooooo sorry man I'm trying not to chuckle, keep my composure, and still be honorable, because this is a lot of shit to swallow in one weekend.
@murphystina @RealSaavedra @The_DailyWire mine or ryan's? If we're talking about Ryan's, I don't believe it's gone and it has to be "sensitive material" as we're still replying from the same thread, or he's banned (I haven't looked, just speculating folks, relax).
@guardian rehashing an earlier conversation from a previous thread because I'm not satisfied... Would someone with a legal degree/background, like to tell me how this case is relevant? Considering the likeness of Baphomet has existed for centuries? Creating a statue doesn't entitle you.
@Thomas1774Paine It seems to me that Gov. Kasich doesn't have any shred of decency, or even a modicum of respect for his own constituents, how can someone presumably presiding, residing, and governing over a state not very well care about the unborn constituents? I'm flabbergasted by this stunt.
@ABC Bitch please, I've been practicing my stop drop and roll's for 3 decades now, I'll hurdle over that raze like my nickname was Back-draft.
@murphystina @RealSaavedra Yes it's legit. Do you really believe people such as @RealSaavedra , or @The_DailyWire would post things without verification first? Not to sound like a dick, but it's the profession they've chosen, I guarantee they've authenticated it.

@realSean_______ @thehill Not sure what KMA means, but he has more credibility than you can ever hope for, and he's still a legitimate President, now if you're not from America I'll forgive your arrogance, but if you are, you're just a shithead that refuses to accept the outcome of an election.
@blackcheckmark @anitabetterlife @CassandraRules Do you realize how ridiculous your statement is? I'm not even sure how to interpret it, are you trying to say I'm being ridiculous by stating Antifa only exists because fascists existed first? Or what exactly?

@Bitcunt1 @Tioman_Island @cryptodemedici @CalvinAyre @satoshi CSW is a moron that believes hes more than what he is,  he's given no facts to back he's Satoshi, no irrefutable evidence at all, he'd just have to access the Satoshi wallet to prove it, but let me guess, he can't? I wonder why!
@Moosesmummy @BBCNews I humbly disagree because of a few reasons, first and foremost that the US isn't in this state of chaos the media (all sides and locations there of,) are portraying, right now we just want to be with family to celebrate the holidays, no animosity.
@iamprovocateur2 I mean, I really didn't but if you'd like to touch base, I'm Hispanic myself, I've been listening to what the people say, and not the articles, it's pretty damning stuff compared to the narrative carried out by the MSM.
@iamprovocateur2 That's also true, but I believe my concern isn't ill placed neither.
@iamprovocateur2 That's also true, it is occurring across the pond, but still, those ripples will reach us eventually, don't need that nonsense in the West.
@DailyCaller Does he think his last name will get him a Presidential nomination? Trump's administration has already talked about it, and will push reform, your campaign headliner just got sunk before it even started.

@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian Which the likeness as already stated is hundreds of years old.
@Smartymarty66 @SuperPatriotMax @guardian But who's to say that's where Netflix or the show got their inspiration from? Slippery slope, you have to admit. This opens up the doors for plenty of other lawsuits...

@LesgartCPA @HopesMom12 @zolriss @emilytgreen I will happily translate all the videos coming out of Mexico to show just how full of shit the MSM and left are about the caravan, Mexico is tired of them, but no one wants to speak about this, I wonder-fuckin'-why?
@RealSaavedra [At this point it just breaks down to two chants, and others in the background that I personally can't discern]		*chanting in unison*	"Leave Southerners we don't want you here!"		"Leave Southerners!" 4/4
@RealSaavedra Another lady across the crowd: We don't want them!" "We don't want you here!" "We don't want Southerners!" 3/4
@RealSaavedra to stand up (or wake up), and start demanding the rights that we need here "--		Lady begins yelling in the back ground: "We need to start exercising law 33 and start the deportation! article 33! [begins to get garbled ] DEPORTATION!"		Lady: "Article 33!" 2/4
@RealSaavedra Man: "Donald Trump was right! It's an invasion! What Donald Trump said is the truth! It's an invasion! This is what it is! And there are more of these caravans coming! And they're only terrorists! That is all they are! Open your eyes Mexico, I demand all the Mexican States 1/4
@birdy_momon08 @EaglesTTT @RealSaavedra Vastly less, they know socialism fails. They don't have any delusions of grandeur that it "Hasn't been attempted properly", "It hasn't been implemented correctly", or "Only America could make it work right".

@EpochTimes to take on so many that just want to be taken care of. So no I don't think they're going to get asylum, and I don't think that's what they're coming for. And if that's what they're coming for, and the way current situations are, I doubt they will give it to them." 7/8

@EpochTimes To ask for what it should be (not too sure what she's saying, or meaning here), and to apply law 33. If they're coming to work, look for it, if they want someone to take care of them, return to your own country. This is what we want." 		Reporter: "And do you think they're 5/8

@EpochTimes they're for animals. Reality is these are foods a lot Mexicans have in their house, and with that all I can se is them coming out and criticizing the food of Mexico. These are people that ask for help, then they're requesting luxury food items, or who knows that they're 3/8
@EpochTimes Reporter: "Why are you protesting?"	Lady: "Because I've seen videos on the internet, of Hondurans, Salvadorians, how should I know what they are? Complaining about the food that Mexico is providing them. They're complaining about the tacos, and the tortillas with beans, that 2/8

@memefan2000 @MarcACaputo I explained it just fine, we either has a misunderstanding, miscommunication, or you simply are rejecting the facts. You don't change a system by complaining about it on twitter, you need to elect officials that give a damn and will steer reform, is that more clear?
@BacksTweets @marcorubio Trump isn't going to cut funding from anything, he's in California now speaking to officials trying to find a means to an end, rather than play politics. Get @EcoSenseNow to weigh in on it IMO, rather than some hollywood liberal hack that claims to be a climate specialist.
@BacksTweets @marcorubio @ScottforFlorida airport. The Senator is 100% in his right, and completely correct in calling this sham for what it is. 5/5
@BacksTweets @marcorubio were taken to court by @ScottforFlorida, court ordered to declare their ballots, and still failed to do so. They failed to meet the machine recount, they failed and had issues with the manual hand recount as well, provisional boxes were discovered at a highschool, &amp; an  4/5
@BacksTweets @marcorubio instructions to law enforcement, no the Senator was not trying to keep votes from being counted, he was trying to keep illegimate, tardy, and unlawful votes from being counted, which I will wholeheartedly agree with him. #BrowardCounty didn't meet the first deadline, they 3/5
@BacksTweets @marcorubio rest of your tweet, no my dear good Soon-to-be Senior Senator from Florida @marcorubio was trying to prevent actual fraud, attached is just one example, https://t.co/T36DTPJ0fu here is a tweet with more court documents, it got to the point the AG got involved and gave 2/5
@BacksTweets @marcorubio Mr. BacksTweetsBackAlright, I'll give you the suppression one, I did jump to that conclusion, because of how many times this same conversation leads to that direction, so for not giving you the benefit of the doubt, I'll humbly agree, and apologize for. Now, proceeding to the 1/5 https://t.co/gZ562uzHKS
@ProfFaustus Did your astute foresight give you the ability to see @Satoshi being suspended due to you trying to spread propaganda on the account?
@KatrinaPierson @Acosta @CNN Anyone else remember that @DaveChappelle skit where people were traded between different ethnic groups? Yeah the Latino coalition would like to trade @Acosta, we'll take @benshapiro it's a fair trade obviously.
@memefan2000 @MarcACaputo Then maybe they need to vote for reform so it doesn't suck, my guy. That is how rules and regulations are passed, an elected official pushes to pass, or fail the bill, see how that works??
@What51771670 @marcorubio That's the one thing I disagree with Nelson so far, he did concede then try to get back into the race, no dignity there.
@JulesLmb @marcorubio Wrong, there was no conspiracy theory, it's a fact and the court documents back this up.
@FuMikechu @marcorubio Every legal vote was counted.
@NeToChiGuy @marcorubio Not a conspiracy theory, facts backed by court documents, and video evidence.
@BacksTweets @marcorubio What does supporting Trump have to do with anything #1, and #2 no one tried to suppress any votes, what in the world are you talking about? Are you referring to counties repeatedly breaking the law, and not meeting deadlines? Because that isn't suppression, that's the law.
@ArtistGailS @marcorubio It isn't an accusation when they were indeed trying to include non-citizen votes, you don't apologize when you catch someone in a lie/doing wrong.
@marcorubio It's refreshing to see posts like this, everyone is so involved, divided on their "team", red or blue, forget that Nelson was an actual citizen first, served our country, and the people of Florida graciously, may he enjoy his much earned, and deserved retirement.
@TheDocSportello @marcorubio womp womp womp.
@DeFede And if I didn't make it obvious enough, I'm trying to say she was smoking meth and thus that lead to the problems in the election.
@ScottPresler I think one day we need to decide who has the better hair, you or me @ScottPresler.
@DeFede I think she meant to say that she only took a few tweaks during this election cycle, it's the only way it makes sense.
@ThusSpokeStella @MarcACaputo @foswi So people moved, didn't update their contact information and claimed voter suppression, seems like the most logical conclusion to me as well.
@TheDemocrats Conveniently leave out redistricting.

@NancyTwinMama @MarcACaputo You're taking this way out of context, they're referring to the race and nothing else.
@omacacodolado @thehill When it comes to Metallica I can't get the taste of shit out of my mouth, I still enjoy their music and everything, but they've never regained my respect since Napster, can't let it go.
@omacacodolado @thehill I'm an open book, I speak my mind freely and free of propaganda.
@mitchellvii Thank fucking Christ, by the looks of Miami-Dade, the Olympia Heights &amp; Kendall area, you'd think it was already Los Angeles county.
@RealSaavedra LOL, it'll work.
@omacacodolado @thehill Considering they were apart of the fires, guess what the relief efforts WOULD help them too.
@BBCNews This is too soon, we're still dealing with Irwin's loss, you big mean stingray cunt.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver Apart of the original team, lol opinion man, stay on facts. I'm not emotional, nor do I eat soy, can't your argument hold it's own weight on it's on merits? Or do you have to resort to personal attacks since you're out of ammunition, which is it really?
@omacacodolado @thehill It's no ones job to donate money, that's why it's called, and considered a donation, an act of charity. Metallica did not do this out of the kindness of their own heart, PR stunt, and I've helped in other ways, not promoting public relations on twitter, they can try that.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver I don't play at anything, I remain consistent, try it sometime.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver Pure speculation not backed by fact, opinionated, and lastly how the fuck is this relevant? You ask how you move the goal posts, you can't sit still long enough to acknowledge the ones put in front of you, and lol @ BTC dying, yeah okay https://t.co/Bh3SkirkXT
@omacacodolado @thehill My mindset is that Metallica are sell outs only looking out for themselves, 5 members I believe, that's 20 grand a piece, they didn't even chip in a new kia each, when they've had record sales, plenty of albums go platinum? 🙄Metallica lost my respect with Napster.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver how*
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver What logical consistency? See for there to be a parallel you should be able to point it out as well, and of course now convenient, you've been trolling me this entire time! 🙄
@omacacodolado @thehill When you say your guys, who are you referring to? Seeing as I'm not in California, apart of the fires, the list goes on.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver When you can find the time to answer my direct questions, I'll show you precisely how you kept moving them.
@Jules35260162 @ProfFaustus He's been a loser since the beginning of this entire campaign, he should just gracefully recede into the shadows.
@Pinoynina @ProfFaustus Fanboy located.
@ProfFaustus Only fools pretend to be Satoshi. Get lost from the crypto space already, you remind me of an unhinged closet door just flapping, and spewing it's rhetoric into the wind for any and all to hear, the death rattles of someone's relevance disappearing?
@BBCNews Why is this news?
@BTCTN That''s great, but who gives a shit when the London banks are keeping their gold hostage? The petro died before it even took off, lol.
@omacacodolado @thehill Not sure what that's supposed to indicate but sure, just keep in mind how many members are in the band and how 100,000 is insignificant considering their net worth.
@Mykonos6614 @ABC Nothing about this constitutes a mess, stop being hyperbolic.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver I neither asked nor wanted the warmth, so it's moot and irrelevant, do you get away with this sort of goal post moving in your daily life? It's no wonder you're so confident in your convictions.
@Heywood0823 @mitchellvii @HPSelf you democRATs need to learn not to twist facts and reality with opinion. 2/2
@Heywood0823 @mitchellvii @HPSelf Let's do remedial math then, which is the bigger number, 35 or 69? Because 69 is what Obama lost during his mid-terms, as stated before this is a symptom of Democracy on a state level, and yes gaining senate seats is historic, once again backed by facts,1/2

@ReaganBattalion Here, here. @SenBillNelson may still be a Democrat, but he served our country, and he did well for Florida in Congress, the people just want new blood, enjoy your well deserved retirement @SenBillNelson, and that is by no means sarcastic.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver "Craig Wright (Bitcoin is Cash, BCH.)	Medium member since Sep 2018	My opinions are my own" lol, even he says they're opinions and not facts, 🙄
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @VitalikButerin @rogerkver acknowledging how he openly claims to BE SATOSHI, wouldn't he have access TO Satohi's wallet if he WAS INDEED Satoshi? No manner of cryptic back, and or double talk can help you on dancing around answering a direct question. 2/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @VitalikButerin @rogerkver Having a hoard of BTC doesn't give you any sort of talking point on the economics or fundamentals of BTC, it just signifies you have a lot of BTC... Time and time again investors get lucky with a project and try to claim praise after the fact, and once again you're not 1/2
@ReaganBattalion What a hairy situation we find ourselves in.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver It's being pushed back as the original hearing was in September, you mean.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @VitalikButerin @rogerkver The letter in the blockchain = not a fact, not being able to access Satoshi's wallet = not a fact, what is a fact then, we must be using a very cryptic definition of a fact and opinion here, so I need to know the rules of the game in order to participate accordingly.
@LukeDashjr @SenBillNelson @ScottforFlorida You're choosing to make this about pro-life, I could argue this could be a climate change deal breaker, it's all speculation and nothing based by fact, stop spewing nonsense.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver I've been waiting to find out for several years now, when is this going to happen? Is it another religious revelation like 2012 that keeps being pushed back?
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @VitalikButerin @rogerkver I don't like impostors, and Craig Wright is trying to be one, so yes. And I will not move on, you don't like my replies, neither respond or read them, I'm not going to stop being factually consistent to appease your delicate sensibilities.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver They haven't earned anything, that's called self preservation and selfishness, you want me to believe he has the best intentions for the project at heart with what you just said? It completely disproves your argument and validates mine....
@LukeDashjr @SenBillNelson @ScottforFlorida This isn't a fact, this is an opinion, you do know the difference yes?
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver Don't care if he's a nice guy, and it's been up for reclassification how many times? How many times has it been denied? @ProfFaustus isn't relevant to this point, and it's pure comedy to compare this monumental asshat to Ghangis Khan, for he hasn't conquered anything.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @VitalikButerin @rogerkver His word holds far more weight on the crypto space on the subject, yes. And @ProfFaustus does? Mr.I'm the richest man alive, I don't really care what Africa thinks? Real smart guy there, alienating, and berating the people he's speaking to.
@LukeDashjr @SenBillNelson This tweet is ridiculous, @SenBillNelson had a decent career in congress, and a decent race against @ScottforFlorida, Florida wants new blood plain and simple.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver give opinion on things they were neither apart of or relevant to it's conception, they're flapping gums and nothing more 2/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi Who are you to say who is and isn't to have bitcoin? There in lies your fault and bias, you believe your course of action to be the right one, consensus says otherwise, and thus disproving your notion, only amateurs I see are @ProfFaustus and @rogerkver trying to 1/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @ProfFaustus isn't a coder, so @VitalikButerin having more of a say on his project is far more likely to hold weight than the personal squabble of @ProfFaustus &amp; @rogerkver which is what is happening right now.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi "I listen to what people say", that's terrible then, for actions speak louder than words, and it doesn't take much to lie.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi @rogerkver via the blockchain, or did you miss that stunt? https://t.co/1FlwSHR22Y -- Go ahead and tell me the MSM/Media did that, he's a pompous liar, and secondly aren't you proving my point by saying Satoshi was a group? @ProfFaustus claims he is the sole architect 2/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi That is a pile of shit, and he is not the smartest guy in the room, for the smartest guy in the room knows the possibility of there being someone smarter, they're humble, not arrogant like Craig, secondly he's been claiming it in other ways, like sending a message to 1/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi A raving lunatic (or two in this case, you and @ProfFaustus), or a whistle blower with a track record of releasing the truth? Easy choice here, IMO 2/2
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi You're pushing an opinion, Satoshi is a person, as the writings, and forum posts all have consistent grammar and style (And yet I'm the one that didn't do research), if you did any research at all you'd know Snowden pointed a finger to an ex-NSA member, who to believe 1/2
@WarAngel1111 @Heywood0823 @mitchellvii @HPSelf Indeed.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus @satoshi "You have done zero research", there is zero evidence that he is Satoshi, he could access Satoshi's wallet and move a portion of BTC to claim proof, it really would be that simple, let me guess he can't, he lost the wallet huh? You've shown no proof, good luck.
@WarAngel1111 @Heywood0823 @mitchellvii @HPSelf Right now it's more like the scene from Inglorious Basterds in the basement, they have a gun at each others balls right now.
@Heywood0823 @mitchellvii @HPSelf What a load of shit with nothing behind it, it's like you don't remember basic civics and what each house can do, or something.
@MarcACaputo I don't think the author, or the website are at fault, more so the attention span of the said 6 million that can neither critically think, or rationalize for themselves.
@ScottforFlorida Congratulations soon-to-be Senior Senator @marcorubio and soon-to-be Junior Senator @ScottforFlorida, now like you said, work work work!
@ABC More like held back to the last second hoping Nelson would gain a lead elsewhere, don't piss down my back and call it rain.
@ScottPresler I would say late in this reference given the recount, but a good day nonetheless.
@TEDTalks Busy calling @SenWarren on her bullshit.
@TheUrbanMiner @officialmcafee @ProfFaustus Lunatic, he pretends to be Satoshi, that's why even Twitter just suspended @Satoshi because he was promoting propaganda, only thing I will find out is how much of a fraud @ProfFaustus really is.
@KatrinaPierson It'll be China for the 2020 cycle, let's get ready for that.
@chuckwoolery Accept the election results, but pay no attention to GA or FL, those are clearly outliers and orange man bad situations.
@KatrinaPierson again*
@officialmcafee @ProfFaustus Is a complete lunatic, and obviously an impostor trying to claim he is Satoshi. Now you're pretty "eccentric" yourself so I could see you liking Craig more based on that alone.
@ROsborne71 @RealSaavedra Yes it does, you're saying they're racist for not voting for Hillary in a racist pretext, it's racist to assume that's why they voted that way and not any other reason aside from race.

@senatemajldr Crack a cold one with Grassley, Hatch, and Kavanaugh let us know who does the best keg stand.
@LANow That's because the MSM (that's you if you haven't been paying attention) is shifting the focus, if it bleeds it leads right? :)
@ABC Really up playing this good family / strong values, the surprise Presidential run closer to 2020 will be a shock, I'm sure.
@KellySpringer11 @DrDMenke @mitchellvii Which is why we should be adults. Violence on any side, or no side is to condemned.
@surecantpickem @thehill There was rampant fraud in #BrowardCounty, don't conflate one county as the entire state.
@braxtonryn @thehill Really, how should we elect them? Scott had over a 50,000 lead until Broward kept breaking the rules, and law by not declaring their ballots. They failed the machine recount, and the hand recount, and Scott is still declared the winner by total votes, how is this wrong?

@thehill Stop conflating issues. California's wildfires are not due to global warming, climate change is real but not in the sense and pretext being presented here, this is rubbish.
@ScottPresler Agreed, but a tweet can ignite the fire which gets people to register, and vote. Trump is a social media phenomenon which is why more elected officials are turning to social media to reach their constituents.
@PaulLov78107824 @mitchellvii It's relevant, you're the one trying to make it a bigger deal than it has to be, why don't you look at past Presidents and see how many retained the house, it isn't a conspiracy it's a historical fact.
@DrDMenke @mitchellvii I don't think so, let's not be sore losers.
@PaulLov78107824 @mitchellvii The house flipping is a symptom of Democracy on a state level, Obama lost 69 seats, you want to play the numbers game?
@PaulLov78107824 @mitchellvii Loss? That stacked Senate would like to have a word with you.
@thehill How generous of them, they gave up 1 sports car. 🙄 How many Californians are they taking to court for copyright issues at this very moment?
@ProfFaustus How is @Satoshi doing?
@james_furry @AndrewGillum @RonDeSantisFL @ChrisKingFL This is his second concession, not as graceful.

@JazzDeeApple @marklevinshow The same @HillaryClinton that back peddled on this issue 20 years later, that is an absolutely terrible image to link in this discussion lol.
@JazzDeeApple @marklevinshow itself indicate there is room for improvement? 2/2
@JazzDeeApple @marklevinshow I'm not cherry picking anything, I'm stating a fact that other countries have better success rates than our own with a different approach at reform, of course you can look at data from both sides of the argument and see we're neither terrible nor amazing, doesn't that 1/2
@djmcconnell85 @thehill The fact you need to be retaught civics is scary, he can't alter the constitution, no single man or political party can, you need a super majority to alter it 2/3rds vote now see how rare that is, republicans even saved andrew johnson from impeachment after lincolns assassination
@cyaneyed7 @thehill Haha, delusional.
@RAG__JJ @mitchellvii @JebBush Or a category 5 political mistake, I like my explanation better.
@NBCNews People are willingly allowing wire taps into their homes, privacy went out the door the day the internet of things became a reality/means of life.
@JazzDeeApple @marklevinshow that being said people that show no signs of change or meaningful effort don't deserve a chance to participate in society, I do not speak for, or about those individuals, don't focus on the extreme cases as a cliff note 2/2
@JazzDeeApple @marklevinshow Oh I don't assume anything, why are you assuming what I do or don't believe instead of asking me? Institutionalized individuals will never change, but other countries yield far better results given they have a different approach than just caging people like animals 1/2
@mitchellvii Republicans put Dr.Snipes into her position in #BrowardCounty, @JebBush I'm looking at you, can you apologize to the state of Florida for this egregious error?
@mitchellvii Let them enjoy their short term high tide, it always recedes, and the #GOP sharks are hungry for the next cycle.
@NBCLatino @NBCNews Why is this news, we have more participating than ever (that lunatic Cortez should be excommunicated), let's be happy with what we have maybe?
@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill 3. Since you bring up laws and SPECIFICS, do you remember the law that states the first candidate to over 50% of the votes wins? Who was the first candidate to 50.1%??? What is the current results? She doesn't have a chance, should concede with grace like McSally did.
@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill suppression speak to those districts specifically, because you're essentially trying to say Kemp rigged this election like some puppet master, when each DISTRICT is in charge of their OWN VOTES 2/2
@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill 1. Kemp was in charge of the elections, and not a single person has called fraud, or suppression, provable I should say, accusations are a dime a dozen, also meaningless to me		2. There is no law SPECIFICALLY that says to leave them locked up, instead of crying 1/2
@jdylancross @qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill Yeah no shit, #Democrats flipped @JeffFlake's seat and the GOP / right didn't expect that, is anyone calling foul play? Any sort of notion that it was rigged? Oh so we're accepting the results like adults, maybe take our lead, the left.
@Daniel_DuPaul @WatergateII @charliekirk11 This isn't to say they're a liar per se, but I'd at least like them to provide it if they cite it. :)
@WatergateII @charliekirk11 I'm sure I can find bigfoot too if I really wanted to, thing is when you make a claim you tend to back it up.

@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill Miss the hand recount now, thus invalidating every vote in that county, a REPUBLICAN appointed Dr.Snipes, so we can't even just blame this on #Democrats anymore, stop crying because you lost (Abhrams), there is another cycle in 2 years for house, 3 for Senate,6 for Governor 2/2
@qhRd0oVXuKgqmUT @fortiethstreet @thehill The laws where they had a deadline to meet and didn't, every state has counties that faces these issues, want to talk about voting suppression and fraud? #BrowardCounty, they didn't meet the first deadline, violated a court order, missed the machine recount, and are fixing to 1/2
@CNN @jaketapper @JeffFlake Living up to his name, being a Flake in his last days because he has nothing to lose, you're of no consequence and nothing of value was lost, thankfully a real Republican will take your place eventually, not a career politician. :)

@Broseph_Planz @ReaganBattalion Let's not make this about political affiliation, and the fact she's been involved in every single one of Broward county's election fiasco's, so for that alone lets get rid of her.
@TrentFergy @ReaganBattalion She's been CONVICTED of voter fraud, in 2016, so there's MORE than enough reason to be highly suspicious that an individual, whom has been CONVICTED -- not ACCUSED of voting fraud in the past, is up to her schemes again.
@daily_tomato @ReaganBattalion She's had multiple instances, now I'll agree Scott's at fault for not firing her, same with Jeb Bush after 2000 elections, but the fact remains whoever gains the reins needs to remove this incompetent fool from the system immediately.

@AleG20888321 @OffsetProfit @AP Hey they've been bitching and bitching for gun control right? Well now they have the house, start proposing sensible bills, bans on AR15s and shit like that will not fly, also FYI, this shooting was done with a freaking handgun.
@yanks2derek @FoxNews And I can dig up an article claiming they wore sunglasses, a skimask, and a baseball cap, we don't know who or what the shooter is yet, everyone was running in a commotion with smoke bombs going off, really doubt they got a good look at them.
@OffsetProfit @AP Yeah that didn't take long.
@CindyHardy @SarahBloomNBC12 Whoa, I'm going to need a source on that, that number simply does not sound correct. And yes I understand that, I came off strong, only because I'm viewing it from every perspective, my first thought was that was quite disrespectful to say las vegas survivors, for example.
@TechCrunch @riptari The fact I even had to go to your retarded link to see what the fuck you were trying to say, tells me you were not only clickbaiting, but you're shit at video editing too.
@couchloc @TechCrunch @riptari Jesus even they're getting into this crap?
@Denzil_85 @BBCWorld Government has always been shit compared to the private sector, I'm glad with my business-minded President.
@BBCWorld Why are you spreading this propaganda? He resigned albeit at his request, he didn't even need to request it, he could've *actually* fired him.
@NBCDFW Yeah I bet he really regrets saying it, you can tell.
@CindyHardy @SarahBloomNBC12 This is not the largest mass shooting in the U.S.
@cam5parkie @justdawn_ @ariana2525 Not sure, why don't we survey every country that has murder and see why they love killing each other.
@justdawn_ 1 year from retirement folks... 1 year.
@EatCryVote @jasoninthehouse The same reason you never know you're in the presence of a psychopath.
@jamescurro @RealSaavedra @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @PressSec I surveyed my own eyeballs and watched it live on national television, would youlike a copy from MSNBC? altered footage-my fucking-ass.
@DineshDSouza Damn, someone finally said it.
RT @DineshDSouza: FACT: Antifa thugs are the real fascists.		📀 https://t.co/ZzXeyOdCXH https://t.co/Th01z7CRsJ
@x0rz @amias And another layer is going to protect us? Because vulnerabilities wouldn't arise? Short sighted.

@jamescurro @RealSaavedra @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @PressSec wasn't he just claiming he never touched her period? Survey say's thats a lie. 2/2
@jamescurro @RealSaavedra @Acosta @realDonaldTrump @PressSec I mentioned Trump to point out a reasoning as to why he does it, not to center, or concentrate the conversation around Trump; Cool you support @acosta, glad we established that. Lies and cowardice, welp I'm taking it there then, 1/2
@MFajay @FoxNews if the events aren't similar I'm not seeing the relevance, 13 people dying in separate instances isn't the same thing as 13 dead in 1 situation. Of course I'm not trying to say one is better or worse, merely pointing out why they cover it.
@chlorineMarie @MFajay @FoxNews If it bleeds it leads, they will never care, they're worse than the ambulance chasers because they'll cause the accident just to have something to cover.
@stopmediabiasxo @MFajay @FoxNews Ask your elected officials why they rejected Trump offering help, only to specify they don't want him to federalize the national guard.
@JeanineKrajcer @MiracleTraining @AP I really wanted to argue with him about NYC's murder rate vs. London's, but you know!
@RealSaavedra 3 hrs later and still no mention of the bomb squad... Does anyone know if it was cancelled, or what's going on there? I know I heard them call for it on the scanner and nothing has been said about it since..
@MiracleTraining @JeanineKrajcer @AP I like how he just blocked me out right, couldn't debate his point, or anything. https://t.co/q6Z0bsAsWd
@FoxNews I was just thinking about this tweet, I just heard 11 victims, the suspect, and the police officer.
@CryptoPoland @coindesk Here here, I'll drink to that.
@CryptoPoland @coindesk Historically we've always seen a nice run around the holidays, but I can't quite put my finger on it, I just don't see it this year.
@klintron How do they see ray of hopes when literally with out clicking, the headline synopsis contradicts you https://t.co/vNGtfNIAO5
@CryptoPoland @coindesk Eh.... Calm down there Sparky,I don't see any bulls running this winter.
@CoyoteUnclean @HdezErick14 @EALTurner @RealSaavedra For the most part I hate them too, reducing language to just pictures, just seems to be devolutionary to me, call me crazy.
@martins25762974 @PoliticiansI @RealSaavedra Honestly I don't think it's "twitter's way" it's what's society is being reduced to.
@MiracleTraining @JeanineKrajcer @AP You're wasting America's time calling for an end to gun ownership, take that non-sense to another country.
@FoxNews The only saving grace (thus far,) is that no one has been confirmed dead (yet.)
@Bellajane127 @NickSpaloss @RealSaavedra And other accounts have them wearing a ski mask and a baseball cap, reality is very few saw them, there was a lot of commotion and smoke bombs, let's just wait and see who they announce.
@CoyoteUnclean @HdezErick14 @EALTurner @RealSaavedra I wasn't doing it specifically for you, but jeez I've made some very obvious sarcastic comments that've even started with "something something 2A something something ban guns" and people actually jumped on me for that shit, not sure how they could've overlooked it, but ok.
@coreydwillis @AP My deal is I found it funny so I posted it. I know people that may of been injured, or killed as well tonight, your outrage doesn't outweigh everyone else's life.
@CoyoteUnclean @HdezErick14 @EALTurner @RealSaavedra Then we should get rid of the 2A then, since we can't trust ourselves we can't trust ourselves not to kill ourselves -- Disclaimer since some people can't fucking read sarcasm, that's called sarcasm. https://t.co/I5sEIsgYdu
@AP Welp, time to start placnig your bets boys, heres mine. https://t.co/Hc9knMiZ2f
@CoyoteUnclean @HdezErick14 @EALTurner @RealSaavedra Na, we need alcohol free zones now.
@PoliticiansI @martins25762974 @RealSaavedra Well I'm right with you about the gun rights, don't worry.
@StefanMolyneux Yeesh, if that isn't the face of fuck off before coffee.
@TerryLa00384494 @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst LOLLL Holy shit.
@martins25762974 @PoliticiansI @RealSaavedra I was replying to @PoliticiansI, they seem to of deleted the comment now.
@stopmediabiasxo @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst it doesn't seem like he's apprehended since they've sealed off the area and made mention he's in the area, there was also a bomb squad call, I haven't heard anything else about it though, they may of cancelled it and I didn't catch it.
@FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst What's going on with the bomb squad call? I heard that shit early on into the scanner.
@martins25762974 @PoliticiansI @RealSaavedra Meh, none or all, screw that.
@PoliticiansI @martins25762974 @RealSaavedra Jesus the something something's didn't give it away? I was clearly being sarcastic, I'll add fucking brackets &lt;Sarcasm&gt; &lt;/Sarcasm&gt; next time for you.
@TimothyMHowe @HollandStanton @TwitterMoments @FBI where did I say "city-scale", see I was waiting for this, because you've set your own trap dumb ass, no one ever said it would be a burst that would be as large as a city, I said it could take out a city *grid*, do you know the difference?
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Well I hate to break it to you, I'm not. Researching a subject doesn't necessarily indicate anything, aside from a curious mind.
@newjorts @Greenileo3 @justme199008 @FoxNews @LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight He's been pushing the issue since he got into office, we've only secured a 1/4th of the budget, secondly give the whole xenophobe rhetoric a rest already, they're trying to cross our borders illegally, they're criminals, and if you want to speak about asylum, well I have plenty.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Yes because I'm so entrenched in this survivalist ideology I am now living off the Twitter land, foraging only likes and retweets for sustenance... https://t.co/g7gmLLkded
@TimothyMHowe @HollandStanton @TwitterMoments @FBI I don't need to google anything, my argument is sound.
@HollandStanton @TimothyMHowe @TwitterMoments @FBI No one is making bombs?
@TimothyMHowe @HollandStanton @TwitterMoments @FBI you can abso-fucking-lutely guarantee that huh, okay lol. Read what I said, read what you said, now tell me we're on the same page.
@martins25762974 @RealSaavedra Something something 2A wasn't designed for these fully automatic weapons, it was intended for muskets something something argument ended virtue signaling, follow me on youtube.
@SaberX01 @RealSaavedra The entire time I didn't even give them the chance to report it to me, I just hopped on the scanner and live listened, yeah they were not only late as shit in reporting it, but all over the map on the details, here's how I picture it going down behind closed doors. https://t.co/Zv7rFp51VR
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments That isn't true, you just need to learn proper IT Security.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments No one is talking about committing treason, what the hell? I'm spending my time as I see fit, what are you doing that's so much more productive than me I might ask? Because arguing on Twitter with me seems to be your sole preoccupation right now, virtue signaling this early?
@HollandStanton @TimothyMHowe @TwitterMoments What right do you have to his tax returns.... None, zero, zilch, zip. Much like my own return, and you yours, see how that works? It is a fantasy, disconnect yourself from it.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments What a crock of shit, so what if they have my background? You must live in this fantasy world where everything is like a Spy movie, where they can zoom in on us in the streets with a satellite or something, yeah man they're really going to use nukes on their own land....
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments it isn't treason when your government is out to take away your rights, that's called fighting back, I'm not going to sit here and continue to play make believe war with you, I don't care to entertain hypothetical's that don't lead to a conclusion.
@HollandStanton @TimothyMHowe @TwitterMoments Yes they're clearly nuts for being prepared, for something that is their constitutional right to do so, a lot of the survivalist people are ex military, you'd know this if you actually researched half of what you're saying.
@TimothyMHowe @HollandStanton @TwitterMoments First of all we lost the war politically more than anything, secondly you can't shoot a drone with an ar-15, no but you can create an EMP bomb for around $300 that would knock out an entire city grid (great, now the @FBI	is going to look all up in my asshole).
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments but I digress, you're simply trying to tell us why bother to fight, they're too strong, why bother to live, life is clearly too hard? Nothing good ever comes easy, and I wouldn't be surprised if we did have to fight for it back. 2/2
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, cannot be deployed, or used on U.S soil against it's own civilians, there are exceptions to the rule, like when Eisenhower federalized the national guard, 1/2
@FoxNews Why are you bothering with this shit when you have a mass shooting in thousand oaks? Fuck off with the side stories, prime time headlines right here baby, get to work.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments I can most definitely equate the two cultures, because the relevance is war, and do I think people will stand up against the government if it came down to it? Uhm, yes? That's why you have so many survivalist groups, they're convinced it's coming.
@aussieavidread @FoxNews no we just get ran over, stabbed, acid attacks, give me a break, London had to do knife bans because their murder rate surpassed NYC's, after that they started putting barricades in London because of car attacks, I'll take a gun shot over being ran over a damn semi-truck any day.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments A third world country defeated a first world country in a war.... Truly if you can't see how that's relevant this is a complete waste of my time to type any further.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Oh what a crock of shit, want me to refute your entire argument right now? Want to talk about Vietnam? They were a fucking guerilla army, rice farmers mostly taking arms to protect their lands, and they succeeded. They defeated us in a war we shouldn't of been in the first place.
@aussieavidread @FoxNews The guns keep the citizens alive, see how that works?
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP yep, any time.
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Fair enough point I guess?
@HollandStanton @TwitterMoments Maybe just a bit too soon, a smidge.
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP That's a pretty good mantra if I say so myself.
@AP @EcoSenseNow - Do what do you do best.
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight Nothing of a Russian conspiracy has come out, nothing that the original investigation was pertaining to.
@RealSaavedra They believe they've found the 7 dispatch mentioned, got garbled so I couldn't make sense of the rest, but it didn't heated, so I'm going to say they found survivors.
@RealSaavedra they're investigating the men's room now, dispatch made mention the caller was female, could be survivors hiding, waiting on more details.
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP Haha, I get you, I'm very hard to offend don't worry.
@RealSaavedra Listening to the scanner, they just said they have 7 individuals barricaded in the bathroom, and also requested the bomb squad, the two calls were separate, waiting to see if there's any correlation.
@rayKarls @RealSaavedra Bomb squad called, it's done.
@RealSaavedra Holy shit they just called for the bomb squad @RealSaavedra
@BONeal1987 @RealSaavedra From what I can hear help is already on the scene. https://t.co/CtbHXQZ8iy
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP Hahaha, I try my best to keep it to the point, but it's very hard when you need to cement the goal posts in place first and all. :)
@Skater_Heatherr @RealSaavedra @VCscanner https://t.co/CtbHXQZ8iy good idea I didn't even think to listen to the scanner lol.
@martianator1 @MaxdaP1MP @AP I can see all sides of this, from a business perspective @Tesla definitely did what was good for the company and it's shareholders, Musk created it, but he's long let the ship become someone else's property.
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP I know what you mean, especially on these big ones where everyone is posting. I'll cultivate my method as I go.
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight I'm not against the investigation you know that right? I'm all for it to continue, but please be sensible if nothing comes of it. You're right I hate Democracy, but we're not a Democracy... We're Federal Republic.
@RealSaavedra Jesus christ that is a LOT of police.... Is this just one gun man? I can't find very much information (yet.)
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP I think twitter doesn't like my posting style, fuck their character limits, I'm not sound byting my thoughts. :)
@RealSaavedra https://t.co/krGnRZKVBz
@jamescurro @RealSaavedra @Acosta Sure, now find a way to excuse his actions without sounding ridiculous. You can't, just like I can't support Trump's antics, but that is truly irrelevant isn't it? We're talking about Jim and suddenly this is all about Trump, stay focused.
@martianator1 @MaxdaP1MP @AP I don't think he really cares if he's CEO man, he seems a bit more disconnected from all of that, bottom line/focused and not worried about nonsense, I'm truly envious of that work ethic.
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP My dude hit him with the AOL screen name, fucking dead this takes the cake tonight.
@KarliJayne6 @MaxdaP1MP @AP I could've sworn I posted it, I will do so again.
@MaxdaP1MP @AP I don't know why you don't like him, and that's fine, but to wish the rest of us to live in a world free of a literal genius and someone that'll go down as history as a pioneer, na why don't you leave instead? 3/3
@MaxdaP1MP @AP eventually lead to the development of Paypal... The list goes on man, he's accomplished a whole lot more in his life than you ever will, or can even imagine, 2/3
@MaxdaP1MP @AP That sounds like a horrible world to live in. @SpaceX single-handedly advanced our rockets propulsion systems for @NASA by about 50 years, @Telsa is the first automotive company to be ran off of anything other than non-standard fossil fuels, https://t.co/ZkjJfdUnwL which 1/3
@jamescurro @RealSaavedra @Acosta Because @Acosta is a pissant that can't stand to not be the center of attention, honestly believe he just does it to get more attention than Trump, not because he cares in any which way.
@RealSaavedra Have to disagree here, because yes it doesn't directly effect them, but neither did Kavanaugh, or any of the number of other "outrages" they've had the last 2 years, the returns will effect their mental stability, now if their expected results will arise, pure speculation.
@mar4lex @paroncourse @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson He isn't spewing hatred, what hatred is he spewing? Protesting his private residence, terrorizing his family? You're comparing Tucker Carlson to fucking Hitler? You're so unhinged you're a fucking gliding closet door, just flapping your insane rhetoric into the wind.
@paroncourse @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson True Democracy was always about mob rule..
@JastenSweat @FoxNews @TGowdySC Oooof, yes please.
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight but not of a conspiracy to allow a foreign nation influence our elections. 4/4
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight there isn't anything to find? They got Manafort dead to rights, he has no reason to stay loyal, even if Trump could pardon him, he can't pardon state level crimes, which is where he is heading for now... See a connection yet? Guilty men yes - 3/4
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight of which deal with Russia, a conspiracy, or a conspiracy to commit, so yes we're finally right on track, Cohen flips, even fucking changes his political affiliation (fucking LAWL), and you also have Manafort, both of which haven't given up the goods, could it be because 2/4
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight He could've removed Sessions and installed an AG at any point, now Sessions resigns (albeit Trump did request it), and they're conflating it with being fired and obstruction? Dictated a false testimony for Don Jr? What, sources,	 and yes they've plead to crimes... None 1/4
@chip_chops @RealSaavedra Dude we all saw it live, he definitely touched her, purposefully or not isn't the point, both sides are being retarded. The Left: just admit he fucking touched her. The Right: It wasn't assault -- however she could press charges, *if* she felt like it, so yeah there's that.
@phyteorflyte @RealSaavedra Exactly, that's why I said it doesn't matter if the sexes were reversed here, you can clearly see the narrative.
RT @USAisInTrouble: @RealSaavedra @Cernovich https://t.co/egZO4DzSNo
@USAisInTrouble @RealSaavedra @Cernovich If that isn't the world's biggest shit eating grin I've ever seen, Good shit @PressSec, good shit.
@stanimals @Jacob_R_C75 @RealSaavedra @WhiteHouse Altered propoganda, LOL now @MSNBC is also complicit with @realDonaldTrump good to know.
@allamerican1818 @leftyvotesright @KendraAlcock @RealSaavedra and you don't see the problem? 2/2
@allamerican1818 @leftyvotesright @KendraAlcock @RealSaavedra The irony being he was just trying to promote Pelosi for house majority speaker? You're ridiculous, he was asking a question when it wasn't his turn anymore, he refused to give up the mic to the individual whom's freaking job is literally to pass the mic, 1/2
@AJacob2016 @RealSaavedra Oh I absolutely agree, he should've been removed a long time ago, and honestly the white house doesn't need to give a reason, this was a great scape-goat, until they fucked it all up pushing it to this degree, call it unprofessional and move on, don't call it "assault".
@RealDark_Kent @DonaldJTrumpJr Hell yeah, I'd kick it with the dragon lady.
@JimmyBear2 @realDonaldTrump Learn the definition of fired, then learn the definition of resignation, next learn that he could've dismantled this investigation a long time ago, he isn't doing so because there isn't anything to find.
@Rob4Raiders @jeffsessions @USAGSessions @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't need to ask for his resignation, he can outright fire him and replace him at at a whim, because he *is* the president it *is* within his appointed rights to do so, this conspiracy theory is a whole lot of nothing.
@CorduroyDP @realDonaldTrump Real men with nothing to hide don't openly welcome harassment either, and he hasn't dampened the investigation one minute, so any failures that occur will be from lack of evidence itself.
@CDL2004 @lizjanebates @SenJeffMerkley @painter_nancy McConnell didn't think for once Trump's campaigning would keep the house - https://t.co/EY3D8iQntb -- the beauty about facts is you can't change them to fit your narrative or rhetoric.
@2017_itstime @AP @VP What? https://t.co/w5wf3rgP7p
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight When you say yet again, that indicates hes done it in the past, there'd be a history of this maybe even a list of convictions. Oh? You don't have any you say? Hrm, well that's concerning, considering how you're preaching like a madman that just found Joseph Smith's golden tablets
@AP Can someone in the media, or a blue check mark possibly get a comment on this? Asking for a friend. https://t.co/2jCVV6r14q
@Ellysa_Maye @Jeremiah_J_12 Give credit where it's due, or something like that.
@RealSaavedra We get it, @Acosta is garbage, but this rhetoric doesn't help. 2/2
@RealSaavedra He did say he was trying to keep control of the microphone, I genuinely feel this is being blown out of proportion far more than it needs to be, yes there was contact, now tell me you've never accidentally bumped into someone? 1/2
@Jeremiah_J_12 @Ellysa_Maye To be fair they did mention the GOP winners as well, at the very least.
@Light4One @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight Can we put things in perspective though? Our border wall budget proposal is 20B, Obama gave Iran 150B, perspective, context folks, who's fucking borders matter than our OWN?
@Carsonstweet @FoxNews @marcthiessen @foxnewsnight How cute, you still think the Democrats really are going to go for articles of impeachment. Sorry bub they played you for your vote, impeachment will not follow.
@Jamal_Barry @FoxNews Same place CNNPC's obsession with #Russia, #BLM/#BlackLivesMatter, and the #MeToo movement lie.
@DidHeTweetThat1 @FoxNews Yeah this is the shitpost authorities here, we're going to have to confiscate this meme on the grounds of we do whatever the hell we want, and take what we like.
@BigFundamentle @FoxNews @NRA If only they were living in a socialistic babylon where no evil exists and everyone is singing Kum ba yah for 15 dollars an hour.
@CowboysChica @johnnygee1955 @FoxNews I think it's ironic your comment shows up as "sensitive" material, but trash talking a red state? Na that's free game ;)
@danilogkir @goldman_snax @LeoKrayola @TechCrunch Not so sure about that whole Matrix diatribe there Neo.
@goldman_snax @danilogkir @LeoKrayola @TechCrunch I haven't seen any apps forcefully updating, but I do keep it pretty barebones though.
@danilogkir @LeoKrayola @TechCrunch Yeah to be expected, and those will all be your shit apps :).
@LeoKrayola @TechCrunch Just because they can doesn't mean they will, no need to go there (yet).
@SouthernKeeks @Reuters They didn't forget, they don't care.
@RealSaavedra When in doubt attack the source, why doesn't @BrianStelter give us the unadulterated footage if they're claiming tampering.
@Greenileo3 @justme199008 @FoxNews @LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight I agree, but I can't speak as to why they didn't, or why it didn't take priority, but we agree it should've been done, it should be done, and that it has to be done.
@Acosta You can't even sleep without cuddling your Trump-like good guy doll.
@stellalimelight @multiplebarkasm @JordanSchachtel How were these events remotely about Trump though? If you're referring to @Acosta then yes I wholeheartedly agree.
@wpbergstrom @JordanSchachtel @CR So eloquently put, don't believe I could've done a better job myself. https://t.co/AowMPB3bT3
@justme199008 @FoxNews @LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight Only difference here is Trump has shown a commitment to at least continue to pursue the issue, whether it's ridiculous, or not isn't the point, it's the fact he's persisted on this topic, I think we might finally get somewhere, maybe -- hopefully, probably not :).
@ReaganBattalion Not vaccinating your children.
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews Might as well be how many brain cells you have left and if you have the attention span of a goldfish at this point, how many times do I need to ask the question?
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews I don't need a thesaurus? You made a statement, I've questioned it, all you're doing is grand standing, so let me ask again, so maybe your thick, narrow minded skull can concentrate, 3rd times the charm, right? What makes him incompetent, much less a stooge?
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews To you, the only fucking person I've asked a very specific question to?
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews It is? What have you presented as an argument to make it coherent, a statement and declaration isn't an explanation, "moron".
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews *Crickets* *Tumbleweeds*, gee what do you know, just another angry individual that can't formulate or articulate a cognitive argument.
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion I'm not sure why the fuck the White House is doing that honestly, it was such a clear cut and dry win for them, I have no words to express my disappointment other than maybe this. https://t.co/amHuxKEa68
@kirby575757 @CantonHOFfor88 @FoxNews Why are you on my side, my armed escorts aren't supposed to be here for another 4 hours, what the hell?
@CantonHOFfor88 @kirby575757 @FoxNews So let's debate it, what makes him incompetent or even a stooge? I'm asking you again since you've conveniently over looked my question the first time.
@kirby575757 @CantonHOFfor88 @FoxNews I'm glad you can exercise your freedom of expression and opinion so eloquently, now how about some meat with them potatoes?
@IRdotnet @RealSaavedra @AlliemalCNN @CNNPR @Oprah I really don't know, that's the best I got lol.
@MattsIdeaShop https://t.co/aQZJMs9gND
@CantonHOFfor88 @FoxNews What exactly has Kavanaugh done to be considered incompetent, much less a stooge?
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion should the individual choose to press charges, it doesn't seem like they are, so this is what we have now, reductive bullshit arguments. 3/3
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion considered against the law, so while this may seem extremely trivial, and even downright childish (from both parts,) in reality what he did could be escalated to a criminal level, 2/3
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion Both showed the same thing, one just emphasized on the contact, which in reality is what matters, now this whole assault, no assault bullshit, yeah this is nonsense, not assault by the slightest, however keep in mind that even throwing a towel at a person in an argument is 1/3
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion Okay and they also linked the video from MSNBC almost immediately after their reply, I understand where this is coming from but let's be realistic, speeding and slowing a video doesn't distort what we saw, I agree with everything else.
@RealSaavedra @AlliemalCNN @CNNPR She was merely defending herself against the bigoted, unwarranted attacks from @Oprah, clearly. Shit, wait we favor minorities now, my bad. Uhm... Clearly this was supposed to be a tweet about the Olympics pedophile scandal, yeah!
@BrandonnJG @ReaganBattalion "An edit infowars gif" like that some how removes credibility of the footage? You won't bother replying to this or any of the other comments, as you'll merely view the reply, see the video, and block out of rage, good talk though.
@OutOfKenTroll @ReaganBattalion Survey says no Kham, it will ultimately end up being another #DearDiary entry by @Acosta.
@ReaganBattalion Also Breaking: If you're a woman and you don't vote for another woman, you're not apart of the problem, you're simply exercising your free will to choose and independently think, not be shackled to some sort of tribe mentality.
@TimothyStuckey6 @FoxNews @POTUS This doesn't sound correct, source?
@loftontech I'm not sure what to make of your comment so I'll just ask, what are you inferring?
@ReaganBattalion Reagan is smiling down with a single tear rolling down his cheek, you made dad proud son. https://t.co/7uYvc0dcF6
@mt_newman @ReaganBattalion Just call it for what it really is, a double standard. Had that been reversed and it was a woman talking and a man did that to her, how many heads would roll? About the same, because this isn't about fairness, it's about rhetoric and agenda.
@traderlyfe @ReaganBattalion Damn Pelosi, Schumer, and Waters are streaking down Pennsylvania Ave you say?
@Bitcoin2140com @ErikVoorhees @coindesk Nothing? Because is a whole lotta nothing burger, speculation at it's finest.
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier 😂No worries.
@DerekEBoucher @ReaganBattalion @Acosta Would he know where her p**** is?
@ReaganBattalion I think their entire argument here is to showcase how unintentional it was, fair point to say the least, not so sure it holds water considering who it is, but I digress.
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier We didn't though, and now I feel like I'm being trolled.
@MovickP1 @ReaganBattalion Oh give me a break, even if you had the "real" one you'll cry foul, give it a rest.
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier Yeah that's really one thing I don't understand about the left, if it actually came down to confrontation well....They're a bit out gunned, both physically and metaphorically lol.
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier Not sure what I could really say about that, sorry the media mislead you? Now I'm not going to say who, or even that all media is bad, just the nonsense, rhetoric pushing assholes, they will never get any sympathy from me.
@bilindafripp @ReaganBattalion The levels of no fucks given there are quite impressive, jelly tbqh.
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier Simply put the narrative and agenda, it was never about women, rape, or survivors, it was about voter turn out, and just like #BLM/#BlackLivesMatter, the #MeToo movement will now fizzle away into the ether since it is no longer relevant to the MSM.
@GoldsteinEman @InconvenientTr5 @ReaganBattalion Hate speech is violence remember? So the fact they're Nazis in their eyes solidifies the argument.
@InconvenientTr5 @ReaganBattalion Really? Can you define a constitutional crisis? Maybe give cite some sources, give an example of one? Just so long as it doesn't like this, I think we'll take you a bit more seriously. https://t.co/fdsuGxUrgU
@Ryebread1300 @JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier They're not Democrats, what else?
@JoeyKeyport @ron_fournier His personal space was interfering with her job, which Jim not only knew was her job, blatantly decided to not give it up, yes someone does need to reach, and or grab for the mic, *IF* it is their *JOB* to do so.
@TrollasaurusRx What in the flying fuck did I just watch? https://t.co/QaRJNKodq5
@BTCTN Good riddance.
@ReaganBattalion @FFL_of_America the key here is communication to begin the negotiatons for a compromise. (2/2)
@ReaganBattalion @FFL_of_America I agree that their actions were reprehensible and down right idiotic, I don't think anyone would dispute that, but the fact is they do have a right to voice their opinion, we need to meet that opinion with the same open mindedness as our own platforms, (1/2)
@FoxNews This isn't about #Trump or politics Fox, you know no one cares about this, back to the political onslaught. https://t.co/TvOqeQ2IMU
RT @ThomasSowell: “Some Americans will never appreciate America, until after they have helped destroy it, and have then begun to suffer the…
@ReaganBattalion I'm all for avoiding an argument if it isn't necessary, but yeah blocking people because your points of view don't align is a weakness IMO, destroy them with facts and acceptance instead, it's effective (and they'll block you instead).
@TheBoxingMadMan @AP_Sports @debo_rey futbol* if you want to go there.
@ReaganBattalion @KristiNoem Of course not, we all know the narrative isn't minorities or even about females in general it's about furthering the identity politics agenda, it'll backfire on them, lets just sit back and watch the train wreck instead, maybe apply some nice filters and selfies with the wreckage
@conservmillen Tribalism personified.
@Jamie_Weinstein This is turning from #DearDiary into #TheMatrix real quick.
@veyseyor I'm glad we came to this understanding civilly (no sarcasm intended).
@Acosta https://t.co/xN0dg7TRkI
@veyseyor I watched the video, I'm not trying to up, or down play it in either direction, the guy is a piece of shit, an ass, and completely classless, he doesn't deserve the WH credentials.
@55DoxMom Trump couldn't give a shit less about @Acosta, he's irrelevant in @POTUS's life, where as @Acosta's I have a hard time believing he can even go to bed without a night light for fear Trumplistilskin might get him in his sleep.
@veyseyor Ah yes, the great ole the GOP is weaponizing it angle. So let me get this straight, we're supposed to believe all women, no facts what so ever, but this is an insult to actual assault survivors? Gee, Kavanaugh would like to have a conversation with you about his allegations.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Yes I'm trying to move goal posts when your argument gets invalidated by historical data. https://t.co/stGjaWvHPi
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump We've been talking about politics in general, and for the Democrats to do what has happened time and time again, is like bragging about the rain and how you played a role in it's arrival when there's a hurricane.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Of course you want to talk about this election cycle, it ruins your narrative when it historically happens time and time again doesn't it? No you're not going to slither your way into the safe zone, acknowledge the can of worms you've opened.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump They were not out performed, if you want to talk performance, how about when Obama lost 69 seats to Republicans? Surely that is worth mentioning, it is not unprecedented for the house to flip during a mid-term, it's rather expected, doing average isn't an achievement.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Were they? But you won't acknowledge how they've gained seats in the senate, which is completely unprecedented? Almost never happens? Okay, but we got out performed.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump And how is that relevant over all? Okay pat yourself on the back for a victory I suppose, one that doesn't indicate anything?
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump And over all suggests what? Could it be the total? The grand total? Could it mean the entire tally? Winning seats isn't the same as your accumulative total.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I didn't? You sure about that? https://t.co/38YYjUO6Wc
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump For majority yes, they won more seats in the house, they do not have the majority in the senate, or the governors mansions, so yes it isn't a hard concept, 2/3rd's is better than 1/3rd.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Except I never once said that, or expressed it, I was calling you out on that fact? And show you where you're wrong, uhm the data is the same across the board man, show me where they beat incumbent Republicans, that was only 3 seats, which by the way, we also flipped 3 ourselves
Jesus christ I just spit up my coffee EVERYWHERE https://t.co/gchQFgV4Am
@ReaganBattalion LOL, that boy Romney though.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Who holds the majority of the governor's and senate? races won isn't relevant and never was, it's about how many were won over all, and that wave was more like a splash, just barely grabbing the majority isn't overwhelming support, as predicted/repeated for weeks on end.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Winning a battle isn't winning the war, why are you insisting on doubling down on this.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I'm glad we've reached personal attacks when your data doesn't support your claims, I already knew it was leading to this anyways.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump So we're only going to focus on what was won and what was lost? Gee, them senate results though.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump So what is your bottom line? As you were counting numbers up there one can only be lead to believe that's your entire point (since it's the only one you make), losing the majority of the races means dick all when you retain the majority as a whole...? https://t.co/LfWwLDKnBg
@SimonWasSaying @charliekirk11 Why are you so disingenuous? Almost all those charges have nothing to do with a Russian conspiracy, but these convictions prove a collusion. https://t.co/bjSk3U9JdJ
@ReaganBattalion @Acosta This entire "assault" argument is just as hyperbolic as when democrats call everyone that supports Trump a nazi, let's stop this bullshit, thanks.
@WIRED @gadgetlab The Samsung Galaxy Book.
@alexanderc1003 @WIRED @Samsung "Shut up and give me back my money"
@WIRED @Samsung https://t.co/UTXs1DQnD2
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Did we retain the majority? Considering that's the bottom line in your entire narrative. :)
@Rindie62 @Acosta Yes Trump is the insecure, petty, vindictive one, not @Acosta hogging the microphone to waste more of the people's time.
@Acosta #DearDiary ...
@RealSaavedra https://t.co/8MJs31qhkq
@wickedyiya @ronnyshreve @ReaganBattalion @Acosta Hell yeah, I wholeheartedly endorse this statement.
@Warzone_Maniac @PressSec He wasn't on the ballot for the mid-terms #1, #2 he upped the ante? What's a disgrace is #JimAcosta acting like a complete bully only to write into his diary hours later, victim mentality personified.
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood You're arguing with a human being and if you're too delusional to see that, well I don't know how to help you.
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood There in lies the real problem, gerrymandering and redistricting, which neither side is innocent of, so stop crying wolf.
@drion97 @PressSec Which constitutional crisis are you referring to? I must be on another planet as I do not see this crisis myself.
@DDT_RN @PressSec It doesn't matter if he grabbed her by the pussy? Why don't you actually watch the video before you call anyone a moron.
@CryptoCoinsNews That doesn't really mean anything though, let's not praise him like a messiah or anything until he actually *does* something.
@intenselydriven @ErikVoorhees Yeah, I said it.
@APRPEH @ReaganBattalion All is fair in love and war, but in politics my paper cut equates to your loss of limb.
@APRPEH @ReaganBattalion That is fine though, this sort of precedent will not work favorably for them in the long run, the short run is irrelevant.
@ErikVoorhees At this point even Roger Ver would be a good candidate.
@princessdeaner @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Who has the majority of the governorship's? They flipped almost 30 seats, after how many retired? They didn't beat incumbents, the data even supports that.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump They're only going to focus on the House flip as a blue wave, they know they didn't do remotely as good as they projected, and bragged they would, we're going back to gridlock until 2022 where we regain control.
@satoshibaggins @ErikVoorhees #Satoshi2020
@ghgirl_s @beemergranny @jerkyboys23 @SenSchumer @SethAbramson Your wish isn't the will of the people and have been defied, now just be an adult about it and stop crying on the internet about it every single chance you get, even Obama haters weren't this ridiculous/persistent.
@ghgirl_s @jerkyboys23 @SenSchumer @SethAbramson Except the POTUS didn't fire anyone, secondly it isn't a CRIME for him to fire anyone in his cabinet/administration, he actually has that right, and always did, just like every president before, and after him *gasp*, those pesky facts!
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood I see 3 districts that were painted red, I call it an image, you know what I don't call it though, facts, verifiable evidence.
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood Key difference is they controlled the media, unlike now where it's a free press, right? Except for that little tidbit that completely refutes your fairy tale point? Oh, right.
@EWErickson Oh you sweet summer child, you thought it was over? That was only the prologue.
@Realitybitesgee @redjanuko @san_doil Agreed, the media went hyperbolic with that.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC I'm glad you have an opinion, mine differs from yours, now let's move on.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC You know this for a fact though? You never thought he haphazardly just wrote it today, didn't bother to date it because well you know, who gives a shit it's his last day? Na, this is clearly a conspiracy https://t.co/4YSlvkQTJ9
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC Wow there wasn't a date, so this completely validates your entire ignorant perspective, back under your bridge.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC The part where I said there's no need for the theatrics, the President can hire and fire whomever he wants, a resignation isn't being fired, thanks for playing.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC If a reply is all you wanted then you've succeeded. If to make sense and formulate a cognitive argument, not so much.
@Realitybitesgee @san_doil @SenSchumer It's easier to shift the blame onto Trump than acknowledge their own failures.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC I'm aware of what a metaphor is, I also know when one is used ridiculously, why don't you look up definition of effectiveness.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC Yes I'm blind and typing in braille.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC Except there's no need for a spectacle, he can hire and fire whom he chooses, and he didn't even fire Sessions, so yeah.
@jillolson01 @SenTedCruz Not only didn't this tweet not age well, but you're completely overlooking just how much Beto invested into his campaign, and still didn't come close.
@treybritt42 @LindseyGrahamSC Good thing Sessions wasn't fired then.
@cynthia_ellis @realDonaldTrump Do you know the difference between request and firing?
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Rejection of climate science? https://t.co/4WEsF6AO6T How about someone that fucking founded green peace calling them a bunch of hacks? And no, the left has always operated on feelings, oh you want sources now? Okay, show me yours too then.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC The fact you need to correct an obvious typo though, what's transparent is your lack of knowledge on this subject, and your obvious bias.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I said in the next 2 years, you know seeing as there's a Presidential election in.... 2 years... They occur every 4 years...
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood I don't, because you're accusing entire districts of voter suppression without any facts, just conjecture spewed by the MSM.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I know what happened, do you? I'm parroting the 'black on black' rhetoric, well it does stand to logic and reason that if you're accusing a county of voter suppression, then that means the county had to actively play a role in it. Watch Fox? No, but I don't watch CNN either.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC what perjudice, you're the only opening admitting to calling me a dRump supporter without any facts, just an opinion, if that isn't a bias what the fuck is?
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You can't argue with me because I don't need to use feelings or emotions to make a solid argument, you however can't seem to find enough time to virtue signal. Nefarious reasons, only which lie in your minds eye, none of which stem from reality.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You don't say sherlock? You mean to tell me the mid-term elections are for congress? Yet most people also attribute to voting during the mid-terms as to whom is in office, so essentially he isn't, and is on the ballot, at the same time.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Which tends to imply I'm a white male, please I've dealt with enough of you liberal lunatics to understand how you reason.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC you're basically saying black on black voter suppression since it's delegated to the counties themselves. 2/2
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I have actual medical research to do, but before I do let me throw in a few more shades to show my superiority towards you. How about no, GA is a perfect example of mass hysteria, there was no voter suppression, 1/2
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I think it's credible that the Left and Democrats overreacted, and continue to overreact about President Trump, yes. He won legitimately, instead of complaining, come back in 2 years with a better candidate, constant whining in the MSM isn't helping anything.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC to speak for the people they suddenly know whats best for the people, which is why time and time again true Democracy has failed, it only seems to work levied with a Republic backbone. 2/2
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Why would slavery matter at all in this instance, we're not talking about human decency we're talking about the demise of a government that stood for centuries, and there in lies the problem of it all, you allow the politicians 1/2
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You didn't need to say I was white, you implied it with the duck quacking analogy, or are you going to try and say it was being used for a different reason? Go ahead, try and explain it, I'd love to hear what I could possibly sound like.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Meaningful in what context, and who's dream/vision? See you're pushing that mob rule because it suits *your* agenda, not mine, the power of the many will not infringe on the few, remember that line?
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC The wants and needs of the people are heard every election, thing is we don't claim Honduras collusion every time a Democrat wins the Presidency.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I'm not talking circles, I'm bringing it right to the level you'd like it to be, disputing the authenticity of the video, which I've mentioned several times, would be far harder to accomplish than a good quality.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/u2ea2jZhXl 	A federal republic is a federation of states, with a republican form of central government. It differs from a unitary state in that in a federal republic, the authorities of the state governments cannot be taken back by the central government.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Citing their eventual demise as a source of argument as a repeat historical trend? Yes, it very well is, and your capacity of as a medical researcher has little, if not at all nothing to do with the subject at hand?
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Because that's how identity politics work, you're categorized due to your race, cultural background, ethnicity, etc. Also I'm Hispanic, so I guess I must be the only platypus on the face of the Earth that can quack like a duck.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC What in the world is "changing democracy", whether I like it or not has nothing to do with the fact you made little, to absolutely no sense, yes I would "next" me too when my pesky facts keep getting in the way of your fairy tale.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC If you want to be reductive we can go there too, I'm just being objective.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC What I mean by allowing it is, if he was remotely helping Trump (which he wasn't), and he got shitcanned after the fact, why wouldn't he drop some unpalatable bombs that destroy Trump's reputation?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I haven't ignored them, what I have done is remember that it's innocent until proven guilty, did you forget that caveat?
@NothingsTweet @Travon @michaeljkellyjr You're pretty fucking retarded, and I almost never start a conversation like that. Ben's rights have always been protected? Sure, in this day in age, in this country. Would you like to talk about the holocaust, or any of the other despicable crimes committed against Jews?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC And yet I get plenty of people telling me that Hillary only lost because Comey mentioned her e-mails, so I have a hard time believing that Comey both helped Trump and allowed himself to get shitcanned after the fact.
@Ellysa_Maye He's already beginning to extend the hand, so just maybe.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC From just the video we can determine a gun of sorts and something being handed out to only the women, going by their demeanor and attitude they don't seem to be very friendly, that's it.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I'm not disputing his e-mails, but I also haven't read them, so I haven't the slightest idea what the contents are, I'm saying let's wait for a verdict, or something we can actually speculate on, just because they have his emails doesn't mean anything necessarily.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC of the crap they spew, and we're also suggesting it can't be taken seriously because it's a grainy low quality video, well the fact it's grainy and low quality makes it harder to fabricate. 2/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I honestly dont know where in my feed the reply is, but I'll just paraphrase it: We're basically saying here the source shouldn't be trusted because it's deepstate, trust me I don't agree with at least 97% 1/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I don't agree, but that's also okay in my book, these are opinions, not facts, and we should let our judicial system do it's job, not rush to a conclusion, it'd be nice to know the answer to everything ahead of time, but yeah not the case.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I did, not sure why they're not showing up though. https://t.co/yNtEbkmIjR
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You can be arrested for conspiracy to commit (I'm even fairly certain I made mention of that), so IDK what were even disagreeing about here, when we're on the exact same page?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC one's been arrested for conspiracy, conspiracy to commit, or anything remotely dealing with Russia meddling in the elections. They flipped Cohen &amp; Manafort, they produced nothing, Benghazi went on 2+ years and nothing came of it. 2/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Ridiculous notion, if I meet with someone from Saudi Arabia am I suddenly in cahoots with them? Something has to come of it, something needs to be discussed for it to be considered conspiracy, and as to why is it continuing? I don't have an answer to that, what I know is no 1/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC He could've gotten away with it for a long time, he isn't doing it for a reason, there isn't anything to find.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC The resolution being low is in our favor, degraded quality is harder to fake than a crisp image/video, because you have less to work on, you'd think it's the other way around, but it's actually harder to replicate degraded quality than cleaning up a high quality photoshop.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC now I'll agree they COULD still ask for asylum, my main problem is how they disregarded Mexico's barrier, and crossed. 2/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I don't mind if they want to come here, I even welcome them, my real point? My family migrated here legally, they can do the same, they make the rest of Latin America look bad by disobeying the laws, 1/2
@VetResistSquad @medwoman1 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I think if the GOP wins 2020 we'll regain the House in stronger numbers and retain the Senate the recent gains will only solidify that. But were quite early anything can happen and since this is politics its ever evolving the moment I hit reply everything could drastically change
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Show me how to digitally alter blurry videos to such a degree you can't discern their authenticity, you can't. Even the best photoshops and video alterations have telltale signs, I've learned to spot them over my lifetime, that videos quality is far too degraded to alter.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It isn't a fact? Would you care to explain that to me? Are you claiming the video is fabricated? Because if it isn't, it's just blurry, and anyone with half way decent vision can see what's going on.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Majority isn't the same thing as having the numbers to pass a law, how many votes does it take to pass something in the senate? Yeah, that's right, they never had the numbers.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC They literally crossed Mexico without permission are you kidding me right now? And the gun? The money? Like I've said before, willfully ignorant.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Because he's been met with resistance, and the wall has been rejected how many times by Democrats? He's been TRYING to fix it, the constant bureaucratic process is what's preventing anything from getting done.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I'm getting angry? About what, I've laid out fact after fact, point after point, all you've provided is conjecture, nothing rooted in verifiable facts.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC He could fire Sessions and Rosenstein too, but hasn't, hrmm. But wait, that's just because he's not stupid enough to incriminate himself, correct? I just want to make sure I'm using the same play book as you are.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Oh give me a break, now we're breaking out the phobia's as some sort of broad stroke explanation, fact is you're just looking for a cop out to justify your POV, you're simply wrong, be an adult about it, see it for what it is, adjust your world view and proceed with life.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC They didn't ask for asylum in Costa Rica, or Mexico, they bulldozed through Mexico's barrier without permission, that last part is pretty important and seems to be completely overlooked by the left, they've already done exactly what Trump is trying to prevent, ffs.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It's very simplistic of me to think it was Democracy that brought them down, but also found in history is the repeat issue where Democracy has failed, it's very simplistic of you to try and refute it without any factual evidence, where as I at least have cited sources.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Must of missed the part where DHS backed him up on his statement too? Is that open to interpretation??
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC of what my "way of thinking" even is, you've merely lumped me into a group because you're unable to separate an individual's ideology from the color of their skin, if anything you're whats wrong with the country, there's your stagnant way of perceiving and thinking. 3/3
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC cute to see you care about voting rights far more than the right to protect yourself. And my way of thinking, is very stagnant? I haven't given a single statement, thought, or declaration 2/3
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC How the hell is the civil rights movement remotely the same thing to this? Ex-prisoners lost their right to vote, so what if they served time, I'm also aware of Brady's Law that if you're convicted of any sort of violent crime,	you're banned from firearms for life, 1/3
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It's completely under scrutiny and interpretation what he means by dangerous, if he's even said that at all, I can honestly say that any sort of "threat" he's emphasized on is purely on an economic level and not on the propensity for violence these individuals have.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It is a load of crap, you're refuting the evidence based on the source putting the data/information out there, not the actual data/video itself, weak argument.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Because it's a fact, if they were just seeking asylum they've seem to of passed at least 2 or 3 different countries so far, I don't see very many of them applying for asylum in said countries.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Why so you can claim that it's merely a video of one individual so they don't speak for the entire caravan? Give me a break already, you're willfully being ignorant and that's your prerogative, I simply refuse to participate in such a thing.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Yes I'm sure you only view true bi-partisan media, like CNN.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC What makes no sense is you know how they work, and some how think mob rule (true democracy) is the best route? Have you never picked up a history book and learned about Rome or Greece? How did democracy work out for them in the end?
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC What makes the system ridiculous? I'm not closed minded, I'm quite open minded. Now explain to me how the popular vote in a SENATE RACE matters, so I can show you just how blissfully ignorant you truly are on this topic/discussion.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC That's a load of crap, even "reputable new sources" grab video footage and still images from social media, such as Twitter, I see them all the time asking permission to use the footage/image, yet again another moot point.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Why are you minimizing what's going on then? Regardless on how you feel about these people, they've openly said they're not trying to seek asylum, they've already disregarded one nations borders, why would they suddenly just obey ours after the fact?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Yeah because it's easier to discredit the source than the material, bullshit, and moot point and you know it. 2/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Who cares who aired it? Sounds like a personal problem, you personally not watching Fox News is limiting your world view, also they aren't national tv or credible, what the fuck does that have to do with the source, the video itself? 1/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC And I never once said that a single man with a single gun was super dangerous, but you didn't hesitate to twist my words to such a degree, right? Don't like it when your tactics are used against you?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It's illegal to cross borders illegally, you can apply for citizenship at an embassy too. These people are not coming to seek asylum, they've even said it on national TV that they're going to try and cross regardless of what Trump says, that's seeking asylum??
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Clearly I must be one of these inferior individuals below a simpleton because I can't understand. Please, explain it to me using small words and graphs, still waiting to see how the popular vote effects/matters in a Senate race, though.
@afidla @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You realize just how ridiculous you look? The popular vote argument, really? Go educate yourself on senate races work, you might learn something.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Logic leads that I never once said I subscribed to the theory and presented it for what it was, a video showing what I described, so logic would dictate I'm observant, you're saying a group of 7,000+ people crossing our borders illegally is no big deal, my bad...
@BobbyDug @FoxNews @wjmcgurn Yep, now what makes them Nazis?
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC First of all why are you associating ANYTHING I'm saying with a paid caravan theory? I haven't mentioned that shit once, I pointed out that you can clearly see them handing out (what seems to be) money and a gun in his waistband, that's flat out shady you can't argue against that
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC isn't asylum when you ask the first country for entry? Interesting how they disregarded Mexico's borders and passed without permission. Interesting though, laws and borders suddenly don't matter. 2/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Of course you wouldn't, it's easier to do what you're doing now, you're completely refusing to see how their actions is actually unlawful, they could've asked for asylum in Mexico or Costa Rica, 1/2
@BobbyDug @FoxNews @wjmcgurn What makes them Nazis? What's crazy is labeling your opponents Nazis, I think you misplaced your thesaurus because you're missing all the ism's associated with this type of rant/talk/message.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC You didn't see a gun because you didn't care to, now it's about the quality of the video, i can screenshot the fucking gun, circle it and you'll contest that it could be an airsoft pistol. Now we're also going to say that isn't money? What sort of valuable paper could 1/2
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC he be distributing amongst the caravan that holds any value? Nametags? A single sheet of toilet paper? There's ignorance, and then there's willfully being ignorant. 2/2
@cathwheely @susanpotts58 @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/ERMAzCWVN6 -- Same place it was last time, compadre.
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/ERMAzCWVN6 -- He's really a good guy though, he's giving them money out of the kindness of his own good heart, and the gun is there purely for self defense, and since this is a migrant caravan, guns are okay!
@cathwheely @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I love how you only show my reply, you called me a bot, I called you an NPC, see that's how it works, you insult someone, you're open for speculation and retaliation, don't throw the first punch and whine when you're defeated.
@DebbieHenley16 @MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC The only thing they resist is facts and common sense, bunch of ostriches burying their heads in the sand.
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Don't read Brietbart, don't watch Fox News either, which other stereotype would you like me to defy by simply existing?
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC How am I the fake news, much less how am I on it's side? Once again, making statements and declarations that make little to no sense, and hold no basis in reality, come back when you've formulated an articulate argument, rooted in facts not feelings and emotions, of course. 2/2
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC It's a huge deal because it's normal, that literally contradicts itself, please research the definition of these words, or I'll google and paste the results for you. Who are is sycophants? The caravan isn't about being a threat, it's about being proactive and preventing crime 1/2
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC The irony being you're the one acting completely out of control, perpetuating a stereotype (that all liberals formulate an opinion based on identity politics) and even being hostile, where as I have maintained the same rather reasonable demeanor, try being an adult for once.
@cathwheely @susanpotts58 @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Ah yes, I'm a superior technological life form because I've bested your argument. Attached you'll find the Liberal's guide book on how to rebuttal. https://t.co/abeVM8zWRd
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I didn't try to frame "it" or anything for that matter, when you say "you're all psychopaths" who is they in this situation? I'd just like to point out your hypocrisy is all, so feel free to ignore this as it threatens your delicate sensibilities.
@lestatdelc @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC What archaic feature are you referring to? And who are you calling a traitor, and why?
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC He can't be a "narcissistic sociopath" because you can't be both things? Sociopaths and Psychopaths have an underlying narcissism, what separates it from classical/true narcissism is the fact they feel empty inside, you're contradicting each diagnosis by suggesting this.
@medwoman1 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Yes, now the question becomes will the Democrats just start throwing subpoena's in every which direction hoping something sticks, or do we get shit done in congress, if they waste time, money, and effort on nonsense, 2020 is in the bag for the GOP, no questions asked.
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC goes against the very nature of a narcissist, they need praise and admiration, psychopaths and sociopaths don't need that but its the key difference, I say and ask all this because a real narcissist wouldn't be enjoying himself in the White House if they were in Trump's shoes 2/2
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Okay now let us focus on narcissism, what separates a narcissist from say a psychopath or sociopath is the fact that deep down inside they feel utterly useless, and hopeless, now knowing this, would you want to be in a place where you're constantly being put down? Fuck no, it 1/2
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC because he can't be both things, a highly sophisticated conman that is slithering his way through our nation, and a complete and utter moron, because a moron wouldn't of gotten remotely as far as he did. 3/3
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC just about money he's wasting his time with the Presidency, he made far more of it being a businessman, if it's respect once again, he's in the wrong line of work, I don't think he's this criminal mastermind the Democrats paint him out to be, 2/3
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I don't see fear-mongering, I see him trying to shine light on a real problem, anyone can just cross our borders at any given time without permission, self-interested or not, his actions seem far more selfless than you give him credit, let's be realistic here, if it was 1/3
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Why would I need to be? Considering Bowers detested Trump and thought he was too soft, I'm not seeing the connection here.
@ChineseNavy @JeanRay1123 @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Every president needs oversight, this is just stating what we already know, maybe the GOP was complicit, but he also hasn't done anything I'd deem immoral or illegal.
@MrSadTrump @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Deranged simpleton, MAGA baboons, arrogant with total control, lol... There will be a wall, we've already got 1/4th of the funding #1, and #2, checks and balances always existed, it isn't a historic trend or anything that the house flips during a mid-term. https://t.co/2dnZtiVKTk
@JeanRay1123 @ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Don't bring up Obama, you'll get accused of deflecting (even though it's a direct, and relevant question).
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Ah yes the same dehumanization treatment they gave Kanye West for visiting the white house? An uneducated token coon that can't read? Those are very tolerant words right there. Only reason I brought up CNN is to display the double standard, not argue which is better.
@JamesMountSays @scorsiglia81 @MarcoRichter16 @realDonaldTrump lmao, this tweet is far better than your first. +1
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC I have video footage of people in the caravan carrying guns and also handing out money to the women, also video of them getting on buses and trucks, funny how the cameras aren't rolling to catch that right? They've walked all that distance by foot? Survey says that's a lie.
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Oh what a crock of shit, he isn't spreading any sort of bs, and if you really want to make this about the media, because CNN is so much better right? They don't just go on tirades blaming the President for Anderson Cooper's lukewarm coffee? Give it a rest.
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Can you specify his abuse of power? Maybe specific instances? He may want Sessions to intervene, but Sessions recused himself long ago, so this is a moot, and completely irrelevant point, do you have a point, and will you arrive to it in the near future?
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Sided with him over us, that never once happened. What war is he waging on the government? He hasn't done anything to undermine the investigation into Russia, and as for the ties with allies, do you mean parasites?
@ChineseNavy @WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Yes, a deemed traitor by the courts of public opinion, nothing that holds water or is remotely formulated in the realm of reality.
@MeganKelleyHall @LindseyGrahamSC McCain is also looking at you confused and with horror, because what you just said made no fucking sense.
@ChuckVoelter @Jophus21 @Jj1127L @karatblood The list of excuses more like it. Voter ID is completely fair, only a lunatic would be against it, and you're basically saying that the counties themselves are suppressing votes, black on black vote suppression, really?
@RyanCoo88764651 @dannielachance @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump The rhetoric of the latter. Maybe not *as* big of a deal, but I don't think it'd be too far off base honestly.
@WPeterRay @LindseyGrahamSC Because the house never flips during a midterm, this is unprecedented events here!
@wongfenglei2000 @scorsiglia81 @JamesMountSays @MarcoRichter16 @realDonaldTrump Because that easily couldn't of been an auto-correct? Why focus on grammar? Is it because you actually have no argument that is your own, so you default to the the most simplest of wins to feel vindicated?
@JamesMountSays @scorsiglia81 @MarcoRichter16 @realDonaldTrump They needed 23 to regain control, they gained 26, that's a splash and not a wave, and also a historical trend, why don't we compare figures from previous presidents though? Pro-tip, I can speak about more than just Obama.
@henryh68 @RyanCoo88764651 @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump How isn't it about each team rooting for their side? Democrats are claiming a sweeping victory, a "blue wave" reality says not so much. Republicans are claiming some great siege in which they held their ground, also not so much, Democrats gained and lost so did Republicans, facts
@RyanCoo88764651 @dannielachance @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump I think this rhetoric is why our country is where it is, I don't think Trump matters all too much and could be replaced with another red figure head and we'd have virtually identical results.
@dannielachance @RyanCoo88764651 @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump lol I appreciate the compliment but yes I do support Trump.
@RyanCoo88764651 @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump Yeah very true, doesn't matter what side of the aisle you're on each side is claiming victory, I'm just hoping they both shut up before the start of the featured film.
@RyanCoo88764651 @GoVolsBo @realDonaldTrump Yeah but in all honesty we expected the Democrats to take the house, the gloating is a bit ridiculous, but I expect redwave messages everywhere if we kept the house, so all good fun in sportsmanship I suppose?

@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump You're still not addressing why they chose to run that cover with the girl whom was not separated from her mother, the photographer saw them leave together, and didn't bother to do any follow up, straight to the Photoshop and .png to the printers.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump I'd like to see the graph and it's sources please.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Do they need to be out in the news daily to be fact checked? They've also had a substantially longer time in office than Trump, given enough time everyone is guilty of something.
RT @Megan4MAGA: When Democrats tell trump to "tone down the rhetoric" I like to remind them of this https://t.co/hg9bSlCDnd
@MistressKye @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump The vast majority of the children have been returned to their parents, the ones that remain are there because the parents don't want to be reunited with them according to @SecNielsen, whom is working closely with other adminstrations to find homes for them https://t.co/WypbLrl43y
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Where are you getting your 70 billiion estimate? Provide your source, because everything I see shows the proposals at less than 1/2 of your quote. How do you know it won't work? What proof do you have aside from conjecture?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump What makes the wall stupid and useless? Why is it that democrats say these things yet they themselves live in homes with high walls?
@leemc1982 @Canela60 @AP How is he saving his own hide? His ratings are higher than ever? 2/2
@leemc1982 @Canela60 @AP I'm a former South Floridian, do you remember Andrew? Do you remember how long it took for them to finally be able to get clean water, food, and places to sleep for all those effected? What about Puerto Rico? How have they handled it poorly? 1/2

@Manivone13 @ericsslater @Amy_Siskind @GOP Proof=
@ericsslater @Amy_Siskind @GOP What makes the Republican party a "domestic terror organization"? I'm glad you wouldn't be surprised, but you also lack any sort of credible evidence to blame either side realistically, so why don't we just all grow up, and wait to see what we find?
@mavwc @8thRG @FoxNews Mother of fucking god you read it did you? Here, I spared you mental gymnastics. https://t.co/JKAWWBcubt
@BraylenNapier @dinocaufield @AP I guess it'll be Obama's gains until there's trouble, then it'll most certainly be Trump's fault.
@carpjen @AP What sort of philosophical question is this?
@8thRG @mavwc @FoxNews https://t.co/xQQMin4cIj Yes, they can... Fucking research people.
@mavwc @FoxNews https://t.co/xQQMin4cIj I can see why you may believe it does, but it doesn't dig deeper.
@itunes65 @wtfdonn @Ferroso1130 @FOX13News You can limit them from the router! and if they start to use up the data, well you are the account holder, revoke that too until they get the hint, your house, your rules, they can do what they want they either pay bills or move out like we all did.
@Ferroso1130 @FOX13News blocking programs from connecting to the internet, and you can also set a schedule of when that computer can and cannot be online, people need to own up their children not expect the damn government to solve everything for them. 2/2
@Ferroso1130 @FOX13News Why do we need regulation for limiting a child's freedom on the internet? Do you realize just how impossible that would be enforced? Learn how to configure your router, most have the ability to block specific computers on the network from specific websites, 1/2
@GreenSideOfCity @FoxNews Sure, when they apply for citizenship, or asylum, otherwise no.
@Daddy73659512 @mccunecicki @FoxNews Because its easier to comment on something when youre not directly effected than being exposed to the reality of the situation not a single person against borders has a credible argument to stand on the law is the law, we have to enforce &amp; obey it otherwise we descend into chaos
@eamckeown @FoxNews How is this racism?
@mavwc @SomewhatHopeful @FoxNews @MarshaBlackburn I guess you don't really understand how this all works?
@lashka707 @Theeyeoftruth4 @FoxNews The only way we'll ever change their mind is with kindness, if we begin to fight back physically, we'll only confirm their biases, it won't matter who threw the first punch, we need to deescalate, not progress the issue.
@SomewhatHopeful @FoxNews @MarshaBlackburn Excessive, 800 trained soldiers with our gear/technology should be more than enough to handle this, first and foremost civilly and peacefully, but that isn't to be mistaken for a weakness, for they will perform as trained if instructed to do so.
@GrantG_NYY @Auriandra @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump The problem is that freedom of speech also gives you the ability to be dishonest, it's a doubled edges sword. That isn't to say we should limit, or restrict freedom of speech, or the free press.
@RealYogeshDhami @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Here here, finally I can say in my lifetime we have  President that is putting America, and American needs first, not because we're better, or they're lesser, because this is our home, we need to get our house in order before doing charity work.
@T_Bone1964 @FoxNews You just had to turn it political.
@HerschelHatrack @FoxNews Couldn't of said it better myself, let's move back towards this.
@RubinReport @kenanmalik @GadSaad This is why we left, and created this bastion of freedom.
@mavwc @FoxNews Uhm, while we all hope for a peaceful resolution, do not confuse the fact that he very well can use them there, they'll use deadly force if instructed, that isn't to incite fear, or to be a threat.
@Maria_O59 @FoxNews When you can't go 10 seconds without mentioning Trump. https://t.co/L1r3Zr1Q8a
@DidHeTweetThat1 @FoxNews @FoxBusiness When you can't wait to mention Trump on a completely unrelated tweet.
@raymondrowleym1 @FoxNews @FoxBusiness Categorically incorrect.
@Dr_Covfefe_PhD @americagirl15 @FoxNews This literally makes no sense, are you on drugs or something?
@Auriandra @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump Since when was it the medias "role" to call out lies? Never has, and never will be their "role", but they have the "right" to exercise it under the 1st amendment, and if what you see on mainstream media is your definition of corruption, boy are you willfully blind.
@dyer_sampson @KajEriksen @EricTrump @TrumpVancouver I agreed with everything until you said that comment about coming together as Americans, this is in Canada...
@LadyJustice2018 @opinionated75 @KajEriksen @EricTrump @TrumpVancouver How in the world is protesting going to force a privately owned organization to change, or even remove the name from the Hotel? Please, I'm genuinely curious tell me.
@KajEriksen @EricTrump @TrumpVancouver Too bad you won't be alive to see that, since it'll happen long after this generation of Trump's cease to exist, fucking hateful piece of shit.
@RepublicanDuck2 @GrampaHarold @FoxNews Would you like to get into this further? I agree @GrampaHarold is being a complete douche noozle but you don't help the situation by flinging feces with him either.
@bartaxyz @RubinReport That sounds more like traffic and networking issues than a bug.
@RubinReport Completely agree, hopefully they reply soon.
@RealAmericanCon @RubinReport They aren't silencing him, because I can still view, and play the videos, technical difficulties.
@RepublicanDuck2 @GrampaHarold @FoxNews You're both idiots, opinions have never required proof, that's what makes it an opinion and not a fact, shut the fuck up children.
@pullingred @RubinReport @TeamYouTube @TuckerCarlson I don't think this is unfounded paranoia or victimization, the video does give the error that it doesn't exist, but multiple users (including myself) can still play and watch, so there are technical difficulties.
@gianniborbone @RubinReport @TeamYouTube @TuckerCarlson @Google Technical difficulties, please relax.
@RubinReport @TeamYouTube @TuckerCarlson Both videos are up, and play for me as well, this is technical difficulties.
@Canela60 @AP The President can only do so much, what would you like him to do to show he truly cares? Stay in the disaster area until it completed? He's got an entire country to look after, he can't play favorites, and this is why we have elected officials to represent our states.
@45RAPEDKATIE @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/g1xKYNlQQG
@Canela60 @AP Have you lived through a hurricane? Do you know what sort of catastrophic damage they can cause? Hurricane Andrew absolutely destroyed Miami Dade County when it hit, and it took *years* to rebuild, this will be a long, ongoing process.
@coryscrib @AP @TamaraLush Orange asshole has nothing to do with this, please just shut the fuck up, I speak as a former Floridian that lived through hurricane Andrew, you clearly don't understand what's going on.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Just saw some footage that was just males, wonder whats up with that, seems like there may be several groups scattered.
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump My parents never seeked asylum, but okay.
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Did I say that? Why does it matter who spoke to her? You've spent more time replying to me than watching the video I assume, that should be enough.
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump "Some ladies lies", okay, can you prove she's lying? #FactsMatter, but you've offered none.
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Oh okay, now we're just going to completely ignore who they're talking to, you know what's reliable? Your complete and utter ability to dismiss information without even seeing it.
@FoxNews @SecNielsen @wabisabi8468
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Survey says you're full of shit, but I'll even go as far as to @ you in the tweet itself. https://t.co/6Wu0oR19Ov
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Right I wasn't trying to imply that it's minimal, but that those would be the only places they'd have to really worry about, Mexico is pretty big, I haven't really researched it, but if they tried they should be able to avoid all that.
@RevSinister769 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump Did you ask me what I was? Did you look at my twitter profile and reach this conclusion? What has lead you to believe I'am for one or another political party? 2/2
@RevSinister769 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump I won't entertain the notion that either of them really are at fault, that's what I meant, way to be hyperbolic, secondly are you calling me a conservative/republican? 1/2
@Cambananana @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately I view this as a loss, Im not here to just argue with people because Im for one group or another Im here to destroy misinformation so that we finally start unifying as a country I don't care if you're red or blue, all of our blood collectively pumps red white &amp; blue
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/WypbLrl43y I'm going to go with this ladies statement, considering she's directly involved, over your internet outrage.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov The only places they'd need to fear is the cartel controlled territories, and yeah the cartel has a ridiculous arsenal of weapons.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov https://t.co/ktv4qgPhgC
@Cambananana @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Yeah they blocked me too, ridiculous.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Yes I definitely agree guns are good for self defense, but I still don't see why they're essentially brandishing it if the case is for defense, you lose element of surprise doing that. What about DHS confirming what Trump said, albeit poorly.
@wabisabi8468 @KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump What part of what I've said is bullshit? Specify
@coupcat @FoxNews https://t.co/GWX4Knbs9a here's a better version of it for ya.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov Also, if you read the subtitles (they're roughly 95% accurate, I'm Hispanic myself) they're telling them to get in line, and they're only paying the women, yeah something about that doesn't ring as a community effort to me 2/2
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov I like how you're focusing on the money and not the fact the guy has a fucking pistol in his waistband, I for one never said that it was the case, I merely said "it's being said", did I say I believe it? No, I said it does make it hard to argue against it though. 1/2
@KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump to even be reunited with them, so they're working with agencies to find suitable homes for the children, for such a mean child hater such as myself, I seem to be far more up to date on your own talking points. 3/3
@KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump I am a conservative or republican, the fact I questioned your views at all, you threw me into that category, and no one has ever said from the GOP that children should be in cages, the remaining children the parents have rejected 2/3
@KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump When you say "you're the ones" would you care to specify who we are, I'd like to know what group you're placing me into without even asking me first, I thought liberals were all about tolerance and acceptance, but you haven't so much asked me if 1/3
@RevSinister769 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump and went far more into detail than a tweet with a character limit could ever do justice? No you're just arguing this bullshit angle, theres videos of it on youtube, nope, it *has* to be a tweet, ridiculous 2/2
@RevSinister769 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump And CNN didn't/doesn't have a rhetoric? If anything they're both at fault, but I'm not even going to entertain that. Now you're bringing up this specifically, that he didn't tweet about it? Who gives a rats ass if he didn't tweet about it, when he gave a press conference 1/2
@KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump They let them pass? They fucking tore through their barricade, secondly this whole "carry on" or "NEXT" shit really shows just how little you're willing to even attempt to be civil when your ideological and political views are questioned.
@SionelTweet @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ktv4qgPhgC -- https://t.co/ERMAzCWVN6 Here you go, I found some evidence just googling instead of spewing bullshit on twitter.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov I don't know what it's for, but it's being said that the caravan is being paid to come here, it's hard to argue against that right now with this footage. I can't defend his poor choice of words, but far from fear mongering that's for sure.
@KildayMorgan @bill_shafer @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump Seeking asylum pertains means at the nearest country, and they illegally passed into Mexico's borders to head towards ours, why didn't they choose Costra Rica, or Mexico itself, considering the vast distance between the US &amp; Honduras instead?
@KildayMorgan @_montoni @vision_____ @realDonaldTrump You're really trying to blur the lines between Socialism and Social Security? Taxes that pay for roads, schools, police, and fire departments are usually on a state level, nice try on that one.
@jeremynewberger @realDonaldTrump Yes because CNN wasn't being partisan or anything the entire fucking day immediately after it happened right?https://t.co/sHbZEnRa3K
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov https://t.co/ERMAzCWVN6 -- https://t.co/ktv4qgPhgC Let me know when you've decided to just drop it.
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump The @DHSgov has backed him up on that, would you also like to see a video of a person clearly carrying a gun, and paying the women money? Or are we just going to blindly believe one side of a story without researching the rest?
@nuffthefairy @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump Conjecture! https://t.co/oqi1A15YjW
@votebLOUbLOU @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/XDOCe2m30L
@koumeposter @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump Is it? Sources and references please.
@Neuer_Wilhelm @crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson https://t.co/uXj5ffX7jN
@RevSinister769 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump He did genuinely apologize, and you mean following it with jabs after CNN kept blaming Trump essentially the entire day? You take a shot at someone, especially the President, expect an appropriate response.
@OyeKaren17 @GrantG_NYY @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/JG63ypiYZa There's one time, you can use google and find more results.
@franzjaeger_ber @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump He condemned the bombings, on live tv, and it's also on his twitter feed, because I watched it LIVE from there, so I'm sure there's a recap, but why are you so quick to blame Trump/Trump supporters? We do not have a suspect, you're spewing conjecture and spinning a narrative.
@SionelTweet @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump Would you like to give specific references, or?
@Auriandra @tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/sHbZEnRa3K -- Yeah, no. He owns it? Elaborate, how does he "own" this, https://t.co/XL0wFdFCzL -- please familiarize yourself with the terminology you use, before you use it.  We all have access to media, CNN has a pretty big exposure too, but they're innocent right?
@tomiahonen @realDonaldTrump He condemned it on live on TV, so what are you talking about? Is it the fact he didn't call them a #MAGAbomber? So sorry unsubstantiated claims aren't being touted around so frivolously.
@morten @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/sHbZEnRa3K -- Go on.
@DrKikiG @SimonaJenner @thistallawkgirl @realDonaldTrump yeah yeah, cyka and suka blyat to you too.
@passantino I'm wondering how you're trying to fact check the President when you couldn't tell the difference between asylum and citizenship.
@jenpenn22 @DrKikiG @thistallawkgirl @realDonaldTrump I've been busy dealing with my own life, and my own set of problems to really focus on twitter, now that I have free time, I have been, and you're entitled to your own opinion, mine differs from yours, vastly.
@DrKikiG @SimonaJenner @thistallawkgirl @realDonaldTrump Ah, when in doubt call us Russian bots!
@DrKikiG @thistallawkgirl @realDonaldTrump Would you care to be more specific instead of just giving conjecture? I'd like some sources, and some facts with your rant.
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Did you ever stop to think there's a reason for him being up, such as protecting your fucking rights to whine about him on twitter at 3 am? Of course not, you just need to complain.
@DrKikiG @thistallawkgirl @realDonaldTrump A hard working President doesn't sleep, I'm actually shocked to see him tweeting this late, impressive.
https://t.co/FXRah1jQjc
@RamonaMacLeod @LauraBehrensWu @danielgross Yeah that's inaccurate.
@Theeyeoftruth4 @FoxNews We'll never recover from this if we continue down this path, it is time to stop the fighting and unify as a country, red, or blue, all of our blood collectively pumps red, white, &amp; blue.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump No one fact checks them this rigorously, know why? Because it IS fake news, they're swaying your opinion on a subject with half truths, the Times article is a pristine example of that, completely misleading, but that's okay because it's effective? 2/3
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump How do you defend that, you've basically attacked everything about my point except my original one, how do you explain it's existence when she was never separated from her parents(at the time of it's printing, so we don't go back down that rabbit hole)? 3/3
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump I love how we have such a concrete number on that 5,200 lies, damn that's impressive, has anyone counted the lies of a Democrat? I won't ask for Obama since obviously I'll be accused of just deflecting to him or Hillary, what about Maxine Waters? What about Pelosi? 1/2
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Welp I guess we should just say neither of us is correct or knows for sure then, it's a dead discussion since neither of us can prove either which way, and I just spent a decent amount of time trying to find new data, but of course, it's no longer relevant so no ones covering it
@Theeyeoftruth4 @FoxNews You just had to make this about political party affiliation didn't you, couldn't help yourself?
@FoxNews Look at that folks, an instance where a gun not only didn't take a life, but also put criminals behind bars, it's almost like... They aren't just for killing?!
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump I didn't even support him until a year after the election, because I started to see what was being said about him, and what his actions were showing, not what he was saying on Twitter, but the promises he made, and how they've actually been kept/ 7/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump play a game, the media is involved in the game, an outsider like Trump, puts their game in jeopardy, which is why he's being portrayed the way he is.Please view what I've said as neutral as possible for yes, I do support him, I didn't just blindly come to that conclusion, 6/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump government to remove the incentive of being a politician. Also all media outlets pretty much either loved, or were indifferent to Trump, before he decided to run for President, it was only then that this entire smear campaign began, it isn't a coincidence, career politicians 5/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump itself existed before his presence (as our President.) But we both see that the problem isn't necessarily the individual (Trump) and both acknowledge that most politicians lie just to get re-elected, and remain in office/power. So we should be focusing on how we reform our 4/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump our neighbors. As for the dividing, yes I can see how he could cause a divide via Twitter, but let's not deny that the media does not help, adds fuel to the fire, and further more before Trump we still had this issue, it isn't fair to say it is his fault, when the problem 3/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump doing what hasn't been done in a long time, put America and it's value first, then the rest of the world, this isn't to say that those countries are inferior or of lesser importance, but they frankly also aren't our problem, we need to focus on our own house before we help 2/7
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump Actions do speak louder than words (I use that phrase myself, and your remix of it with being a shadow led me to be we may be able to have a civil conversation about this), now here is where we begin to differ, I feel he's just an unconventional President 1/7
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump It's almost as if... All politicians lie, and neither political party is innocent of this, go figure. Far from the same topic, and nothing to do with Trump, you began this entire thing bashing on Trump, and now you're shifting to the GOP.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/akrmm1F4NP Actually I can, instead of focusing on just the photographer, you should've researched the case as a whole.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump It's a rabbit hole to entertain opinion based discussions which ultimately leave us back where we started, opinionated with no facts, I felt it needed clarification so there was no room for error.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Okay? Why are you going from Trump to McSally? stop shifting from topic to topic.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Hrm, okay I was wrong about the events, but they weren't separated were they? Which is what the entire thing tried to convey, and it's false.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump likely include the pre-existing condition. As for the tax cuts, I don't have a response to that yet as none of us have information on it, pure speculation and I'm not going down that rabbit hole. 2/2
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump How is the caravan a spin to inflame "the base"?Gutting Obamacare doesn't mean they wouldn't implement Trumpcare, since that's what they're trying to do, repeal Obamacare, and install a different version of healthcare that would more than 1/2
@matisyahuu619 @FoxNews @POTUS @RichEdsonDC @foxnewsnight Stop telling people how to vote, and just vote, fucking ridiculous.
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Oh it does? So I guess the little girl in the photograph crying for her parents, not because they were separated, but because she got lost in a crowd, means absolutely nothing? Good job trying to spin it and make about policy though! :)
@dontbelievemoi @NTrumplican @realDonaldTrump While I agree with your message, we need to change our delivery, and how we interact with those that do not share our political or ideological view points, they're still Americans, and have every right to express themselves such you and I do we'll make no progress continuing this
@NTrumplican @dontbelievemoi @realDonaldTrump Would you care to explain this to me then, since I'm a blind parrot, I must not know a false narrative and photoshop when I see it. https://t.co/6R8y8e9QHg
@TruBluMarin @marcorubio Climate change is a natural, and normal function of our planet Earth. Please follow @EcoSenseNow, and read what he has to say, I believe he holds a lot more weight on this discussion than your typical global warming alarmists.
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump That's a very fair point, and I completely agree with you on that aspect of it.
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump I can understand what youre trying to convey but lets be realistic about it,let us say he really is being disingenuous, he's still doing something that is commemorating their sacrifice, let's focus on that, not who's saying it, that's what matters, the point, not the talking head
@XcrossAtlanticX @ProfessorShn00k @FoxNews @foxnewsnight Where did anyone say filing for asylum was illegal? Please show me, we both know I didn't, but you sure did try to spin that didn't you? What's your explanation for them breaking through Mexico's borders without permission?
@Puglvrscot @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight but they sure did pick a convenient time to want to come to the U.S with the midterms looming. 2/2
@Puglvrscot @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight How do you know they are? See how that works? Have you spoken to them? I've seen video footage of people in the caravan with guns, so call me crazy, I don't think they're using it as a pez dispenser. Yeah you're right there is no caveat, 1/2
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump There is also a tweet from me clarifying that it doesn't make him any less patriotic or unappreciative of our military, but it would make him a coward. I don't think it's absolutely fair to judge a person on whether or not they'd want to fight a war, or willing to die 1/3
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump whether its because they're morally against it, or they're afraid of dying.  3/3
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump for a country, but that does mean that those that would make the sacrifice should be held in a higher regard. Let's be perfectly honest here, the majority of people giving him shit for dodging a draft would more than likely try to find a way out of it too,  2/3
@Puglvrscot @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight They're not fleeing from violence, they could've gone to Costa Rica, or ask for asylum in Mexico, instead they broke through the border in Mexico, they're already breaking one nation's laws, you believe they have the right to break ours?
@ProfessorShn00k @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight Don't think anyone cares about their skin tone and it's completely based on the fact they're trying to enter the nation illegally -- A brown person.
@ReaganBattalion @CillizzaCNN Exclusive footage of that event. https://t.co/MV3Com4Kp4
@JohnStossel https://t.co/42OXMvl4ZO
@PEOPLENRG @realDonaldTrump I guess when you say we, it must be some group of individuals that doesn't include myself, because I emphatically disagree.
@elonmusk @JamesLandino Boosette or bust.
@DianeCo33480 @FoxNews Seems they did it for a white woman too, what does this make them now, sexist? https://t.co/GH8vYXlCW3
@PROAMERICAN13 @FoxNews Yeah, that's a bit extreme, tone it down.
@MrShawnMR @RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump Oh okay I think I get it, you're saying his version of Vietnam was to not catch an STD in Manhattan. I don't see how that exactly is disrespectful to troops, but okay, we're all entitled to our opinions.
@sheagrimm @Bayl3rat @tedcruz The Toyota stadium rally seems to contradict you again, but you're just going to recite how many people could fit inside right?
@beaveranthony2 @MaryEbth @FoxNews @AndrewGillum Yeah going to need a source on this or I call bullshit.
@FoxNews @AndrewGillum Oh so police shouldn't defend themselves now and become victims of physical violence, this sounds like a great strategy on keeping citizens safe.
@MaryEbth @FoxNews @AndrewGillum Obamacare is a disaster, they'll be doing everyone a favor.

@MrShawnMR @RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump No I'm too young to of dodged any draft. I'm not really sure what you're trying to convey on the second portion of your statement, so I won't assume can you please rephrase?
@sheagrimm @Bayl3rat @tedcruz a few dozen isn't a crowd? But if you really want to go there, want to compare the turn outs between Beto and Cruz? Oh right.
@Bayl3rat @tedcruz Ah, you must know this with your telepathy, got it. Facts  matter, not your opinion. I like Ted Cruz, what's up? How will you say I'm lying or just want to "vote Republican" when I'm not from the state?
@Bayl3rat @tedcruz That crowd of people seem to contradict you.
@FoxNews They see me rollin' they hatin'....
@crab_blood @Neuer_Wilhelm @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson What did I lie about.. Literally using your own fucking picture, who did you expect to read this shit, ants? Why couldn't you just name them or link a source, holy shit, and at the end of it all you don't even acknowledge that your "proof" is only showing a fraction of the names?
@crab_blood @Neuer_Wilhelm @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson Here's the image you sent me, oh boy, in that very tiny, and almost fucking blending color, it does have *two* names, GASP! I'm sorry that I did not see those two names, when there's a sum total of 11 people here. https://t.co/gqnuhWjSUi
@crab_blood @Neuer_Wilhelm @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson You didn't "prove" anything, I found it, and you were correct you didn't delete it, however #Twitter deemed it sensitive material, which is why it was removed from my mentions, and I had to dig it from your twitter profile that being said, let's unpack the rest of it shall we?1/2
@crab_blood @Neuer_Wilhelm @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson I can't because it's deleted, and I can't screenshot what isn't there anymore, and what am I lying about? Terrorist sympathizer? WHAT LOL, who am I sympathizing with?
@MrMagnanimal @ManInTheHoody Except I'm not a bot and I've gone by myth for over 16 years, but okay.
@FoxNews https://t.co/GfEJWfPLth
@Neuer_Wilhelm @crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson Hey Crab, you really shouldn't of deleted that tweet you sent me about calling me a racist, illiterate, blind, bigot, I really wanted to make you look stupid too, but it seems @Neuer_Wilhelm is doing a spectacular job. https://t.co/vOxAYQN4Fv
@abrahamdylan4 @RyanCoo88764651 @_my_pov @realDonaldTrump just because you'd do things differently does it suggest it's the only way to accomplish it. 2/2
@abrahamdylan4 @RyanCoo88764651 @_my_pov @realDonaldTrump For all you know he may be planning a trip, you're literally bickering for no reason and destroying something that should be beautiful &amp; unifying, you're unwilling to even give him something so simple as showing respect to the dead, 1/2
@DrDanielKirk @RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump You see me defending him, or defending his actions and honoring the deaths in Beirut? Every god damned time, you even remotely show support in something he's *done* you're automatically supporting *him*, stop conflating.
@elonmusk Move like an arrow, sting like a banana.
@RyanCoo88764651 @_my_pov @realDonaldTrump Him not serving has nothing to do with disrespect though, it could easily be attributed to fear of dying, it's a very real possibility, that would make him a coward, but not disrespectful towards the military.
@RyanCoo88764651 @realDonaldTrump So because he never served himself he doesn't care about the military? That's absolutely ludicrous, I never served, and I respect, and damn well shake the hand of every veteran I know and buy them a beer, because those are the real heroes of this country, not the politicians.
@_my_pov @realDonaldTrump Even if he didn't care about a single soul on the planet but himself, he's still honoring the memory of these individuals, which is far more respectful than how you're behaving at the moment.
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport Yeah we can beat around the bush, we all know it's a loophole. It's the furthest  thing from jay walking because you're not crossing the street, you're entering another's domain without consent, or permission. 1/2
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport Why should i go to jail if i just enter your home without your permission? But we both know I would, doesn't matter how malicious or benign my intentions were. 2/2
@Agent99Firm @realDonaldTrump Yeah but it shouldn't be about promoting #MAGA either, it should be about remembering those that gave their lives so we wouldn't have to, it's disgusting to politicize this, I'm also not accusing you of doing so,  but yeah let's not kid ourselves, we both have eyeballs.
@realDonaldTrump I love how even this can receive hate, there is no pleasing people.
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport You begin by contradicting yourself, he isn't fine with them, he wants stricter laws, and that's a good thing, please explain to me why sanctuary cities should exist? They're ignoring the Federal law and undermining our Democracy.
@CanadianLad13 @Milmore @FoxNews @AGPamBondi I don't know how it would work either, but people do some desperate shit in an attempt to cover up, I agree with everything else in your statement.
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport we have to obey the law if you're upset with how the immigration laws currently work, write to your elected officials, get out there and push for reform, don't sit here and blame the President. 2/2
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport Can I prove it? https://t.co/06lo2wKPlt , and what's so damaging about it? It isn't about the significance of damages or not, it's the law, 1/2
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport Insignificant crime LOL,  fuck out of here, you're the nutjob man, and as for those children separated, do we need to visit the time scandal, and the photo ops of kids in cages, which were staged, or?
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport According to what? Blanket statements do not amuse me.
@Xenophon28 @RubinReport That almost sounds like an ultimatum, go figure.
@mike_pence @RonDeSantisFL @RepJNunez https://t.co/jdIUEATABg
@A_Smart_Liberal @tedcruz Beto doesn't have a fighting chance, accept the defeat and return with a better candidate next time.
@_mascione @CanadianLad13 @Milmore @FoxNews @AGPamBondi I don't believe I understand the last portion of your statement, what do you mean by that? https://t.co/yl2FSISvNE
@_mascione @CanadianLad13 @Milmore @FoxNews @AGPamBondi Exactly, thank you! It could be either side, instead of waiting until the facts are in everyone is just doing this. https://t.co/vZsCKKlW7h
@CanadianLad13 @Milmore @FoxNews @AGPamBondi You never stopped to think that the typo's were intentional to throw them off? We have Google man, it's virtually impossible to get a name wrong if you try.
@VP @SecondLady @FLGovScott @RedCross https://t.co/SgUGh0S6vF
@elonmusk https://t.co/GvUL0t1Jh8
@Milmore @FoxNews @AGPamBondi What facts do you have that this was "right wing extremism"? Bit premature don't you think?
@FoxNews https://t.co/ZiVhHMqkk6
@CRTV @conservmillen https://t.co/cSHio8oNm7
@crandallgold @realDonaldTrump @MikeDunleavyGov something something facists, something something nazis, something something xenophobes, something something white males.
@tedcruz https://t.co/8oXKtz7X51
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson of reference to who they are. Of course I can just google "alt-right terrorists" or "conservative violence" or "conservative terrorist", that isn't the point, you're making a claim that one side is more violent than the other with no factual basis. 2/2
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson You have no time for me because you have no argument and are just conflating separate issues and finding dots that don't exist. You've made a claim, I'm requesting the data on said claim, you post a picture of 11 individuals, expect me to "Google" them without any sort 1/2
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson How about you just give me all your data at once? Secondly, how am I supposed to "Google their names" when there are no names listed in this image? I don't need bits and pieces, I need the whole pie if you want to me to argue this.
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson Where are your facts? Present them.
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson but one person's actions do not equate to the entire party, finger pointing gets us nowhere. Just accept there is violence on both sides, neither is innocent. 2/2
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson What are you trying to prove with this photograph? first off the left one looks completely benign and exactly how protests should be, civil, no violence. Yes we all know about #Charlottesville, 1/2
@crab_blood @RubinReport @TuckerCarlson What a load of shit, I guess #Antifa is just a peaceful protest group too.
@CarrollJDorsey1 @NancyPelosi @amervoices @realDonaldTrump and now you know why the 2nd amendment is also so important, because should the unthinkable happen, we're legally allowed to go to war with the government and take back our great nation. 3/3
@CarrollJDorsey1 @NancyPelosi @amervoices @realDonaldTrump is setup in such a way that it's a system of checks and balances, which is why no single branch can never obtain complete control, and install a dictator/tyrant, 2/2
@CarrollJDorsey1 @NancyPelosi @amervoices @realDonaldTrump Okay first of all, there are laws in place that specifically state that the military cannot be deployed on US Soil, against it's own citizens (there are exceptions, but those would be state of emergencies, which he wouldn't be able to declare). Secondly the federal government 1/2
@FoxNews https://t.co/5TUTZsOwNS
@Ellysa_Maye Why isn't #BlackLivesMatter taking this on? Whether you agree, disagree, or are indifferent with a person's political views, you have no right to touch them, or damage their property, I don't care what side you're on, or what the topic is.
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews the entire Pro/Anti-Trump rhetoric is just causing factions and getting us no where. Remove Trump from the equation, replace him even, the issue in of that itself remains, and the next person will be the one to blame. 2/2
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews I'd just like to say that although I'm fairly certain we disagree politically, we were still able to be adults, and keep the conversation civil. This is how discussions about politics should be handled, 1/2
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews that isn't to say that people that have records can't change their ways, but we need to be fair and favor those that have demonstrated a pattern of respectable behavior. 3/3
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews yes I'm 100% for having people screened, and then welcomed in, based on merit. What do I consider merit? Someone with a strong work ethic, a clean criminal record, 2/2
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Speaking as a brown person myself, I disagree that we're perceived as boogeymen, or that we're victims in any way shape or form, if you speak with the Latino community, you'll come to find we're quite for closed borders, and for legal immigration, that being said, 1/3
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews that sign is also from July 12th, 1926, times have radically changed since then, and you'll be hard pressed to find any type of campaign ads that resemble this, not saying people themselves wouldn't do it, but our political parties wouldn't, it's political suicide. 2/2
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews What does that have to do with my message? You're focusing on the fact I'm not familiar with a Reagan quote, okay, but why is that relevant? I don't need to of heard everything he's said, or particularly agree with it, to be a good American, with a good heart, 1/2
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Considering I wasn't born yet, yeah of course I fucking missed it? And no we need to screen, and welcome those based on merit, welcoming all leads to the same problems other countries are facing.

@zhaomemo @JohnRingoes @bhamvett @FoxNews Not all parts of Mexico are controlled by the gangs and the cartel, but once again no one is even commenting on when I mention Costa Rica, research the country, compare it to Mexico/Honduras, then get back to me.
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Costa Rica????? Hello! This is logic calling, you completely skipped the first country I mentioned, so how about I hone in on it only and see what you have to say?
@zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Who is fearmongering? Are you  referring to me as Trumps' base now too? Separate politics from the topic. It's called an analogy, and currently that dangerous car seems to be on it's way here, after already crossing Mexico's borders illegally.
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews We know their intent because they broke through Mexico's borders already ILLEGALLY, why don't you actually acknowledge this?
@zhaomemo @JohnRingoes @bhamvett @FoxNews You're right, but I ask my first question, why go this much further out to reach America and not Costa Rica or Mexico itself if the point is to leave a violent regime?
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Thirdly, If they're trying to come to america LEGALLY, why did they BREAK DOWN THE BARRIER and come into MEXICO without PERMISSION, or are we going to forget this happened?
@JohnRingoes @zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews You're ASSUMING they're coming to ask for asylum, why not go to Costa Rica? Or Mexico? Significantly closer than coming all the way to the United States, secondly I'm all for them to come into the country LEGALLY, but that process will take TIME, and they'll need to RESPECT that
@zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews It doesn't matter if they haven't cross the border yet, their intent is to cross, taking preemptive measures to prevent crime isn't good, or bad, it's neutral and called being proactive. 2/2
@zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews I'll even pose a hypothetical to you, if you see a car barreling down heading towards you, no signs of stopping, are you going to stand still, and let them hit you, or are you going to take action to preserve your own life? 1/2
@zhaomemo @bhamvett @FoxNews Where did you get yours? It's so easy to dismiss the rule of law when you're polarizing everything to be Pro/Anti-Trump, regardless of if you like, dislike, or are indifferent towards the @POTUS, laws are in place to protect the country and it's interests.
@CarrollJDorsey1 @NancyPelosi @amervoices @realDonaldTrump It's completely, and unequivocally impossible for him to use the military to stay in power.

@Energy321 @RealOmarNavarro It's a pity they didn't follow through with their threat, maybe that's what the Left should do, just mass exodus to Canada since they seem to hold similar ideological points of view anyways, instead of trying to change America, go to where your values already exist.
@Energy321 @RealOmarNavarro Their name is Jordan Hunt, they've also been filmed attacking another woman, and they were apprehended not too long after the incident went viral. https://t.co/poiXv0uw3E
