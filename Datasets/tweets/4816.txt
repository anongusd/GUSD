“The state’s failure to automatically expunge DNA samples and profiles from the hundreds of thousands of Californians who were not ultimately convicted of a crime is unconstitutional. It’s time for the state to start honoring the privacy rights guaranteed to all Californians.”
Because of the deep racial disparities that plague our criminal justice system, DNA collection and retention practices disproportionally put people of color at risk of mistaken arrest and conviction.
DNA identification is widely—but mistakenly—seen as a “fool-proof” technology. There are myriad ways that it can (and does) implicate innocent people for crimes: crime-lab sample mix-ups, sample contamination, selective presentation of evidence to juries. https://t.co/EyZlWGxmml
The DNA profiles are accessible by law enforcement across the country—not just in California. California analyzes and uploads DNA it collects into the nationwide Combined DNA Index System, or “CODIS,” which is shared with law enforcement across the U.S. https://t.co/i6Kd8j5JYp
Those not convicted can apply to have their DNA expunged, but the process is lengthy and uncertain, and many are not aware of the option. Only a fraction of a percent of eligible profiles have been expunged—even though California has no legitimate interest in maintaining them.
Since 2009, California has collected DNA from every person arrested for a felony. In the vast majority of cases, it holds on to the DNA even if the person is acquitted, proven innocent, or not charged at all. This violates the California Constitution. https://t.co/oZNAzguDXb

5. Platforms may think that if they “voluntarily” embrace the role of speech police they can escape regulation. But nothing adopted by platforms in the copyright space has stopped content companies from asking for more, and often inspires regulation. https://t.co/6oLmGNgWIJ
4. Abuse should have real consequences. The reason so many of these problems flourish is because the punishment for fraudulent takedowns has been rendered toothless by the courts. https://t.co/BZXdpSkocB
3. Platforms must invest in transparency and robust, rapid, appeals processes. In copyright, the DMCA allows for users to challenge a takedown, but it is an unbalanced system with many flaws. 		Appeals processes need to be usable and understandable. https://t.co/CX7VtCjylT

For much of his life, Ahmed Mansoor has campaigned to free activists who have stood up for human rights and free expression. Now, we join the coalition calling on the United Arab Emirates to release him and drop all charges. https://t.co/8yc9lMlBVX
In March 2017, Mansoor was once again taken from his family and charged with using social media to disseminate false information, rumors, and fake news. 		He was also fined about $270,000 for insulting the “status and prestige of the UAE.” https://t.co/NCJ5Rr71F0
UAE agents repeatedly targeted Mansoor using surveillance software, which included an attempted attack that exploited three flaws in iOS. 		Mansoor worked with researchers and the flaws were fixed within days—protecting other users from similar attacks. https://t.co/QrPpCFqcaK
In 2015 Mansoor was awarded the Laureate Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, but was unable to travel to Switzerland to receive the prize due to a travel ban placed upon him by the government of the UAE. https://t.co/A1oZ1tOOgA
Human rights observers called the case “a complete sham.”  		The following day, the five were pardoned by the UAE’s President— but their criminal records remained. https://t.co/d0vUP1OyVR
In August of 2009, he co-founded https://t.co/0VqZdiMfln  as a media platform for all Emiratis. 	In 2011, Mansoor and four others connected with the site were taken from their homes by police. After eight months of detention they were convicted of insulting the rulers of the UAE.
Mansoor continued to push back against the UAE authorities’ efforts to control or punish Internet expression. He petitioned against a draft online media law in 2009, which was subsequently abandoned by the UAE government.
Mansoor was one of the first to highlight attacks on free expression on the Emirati Internet.		When UAE news and discussion site https://t.co/CTZ0VU5nY2  was shut down and its owner and a contributor was arrested in 2006, Mansoor organized a successful campaign to free them.
Blogger and technologist Ahmed Mansoor has fought against oppression &amp; for digital rights in the United Arab Emirates for over a decade.		In 2018—after a year in solitary confinement—he was given a 10 year sentence for spreading "false information" online. https://t.co/8yc9lMlBVX

The public momentum for private companies to do something to more actively moderate content is worrisome. Transparency in their ­content-moderation decisions is essential. We must urge that they apply their rules consistently and provide clear, accessible avenues for appeal. /9

If content moderation is here to stay, existing human-rights standards provide a framework for policies that companies could and should voluntarily implement to protect their users. /7 https://t.co/hhm8LDBO2R
Company executives regularly reshape their rules in response to governmental and other pressures, and they do so without significant input from the public. /6
Time and time again, platforms have capitulated to censorship demands from authoritarian regimes, and powerful actors have manipulated flagging procedures to effectively censor their political opponents. /5
We should be extremely careful before rushing to embrace an Internet that is moderated by a few private companies by default. Once systems like content moderation become the norm, those in power inevitably exploit them. /4  https://t.co/aGd17Ranr0

We are extremely gratified by the Supreme Court’s ruling today. This is a major victory, and we hope it signals the eventual demise of the Third Party Doctrine—that sensitive data held by third parties is automatically devoid of constitutional protection—for good.
Cell phones connect to cell towers and antennas hundreds of times a day, creating a non-stop flow of information on everywhere we travel—as the Court wrote, “Sprint Corporation and its competitors are ever alert, and their memory is nearly infallible.”
Like the Internet, cell phones are all but essential to modern life, and for years, EFF has fought in courts, legislatures, and public to update the law to protect individuals’ privacy as they move through the world.
Our amicus brief argued cell phone records are far too sensitive to obtain without a warrant based on probable cause. https://t.co/s5MczPeH1U

BREAKING: The EU JURI committee has passed #Article13. This requires sites to filter all submissions against a database of copyrighted works—creating a #CensorshipMachine that puts thousands of daily activities and millions of Internet users at the mercy of algorithmic filters.
BREAKING: The EU Parliament's JURI committee has approved #Article11. This #LinkTax will hurt those who use the Internet for sharing, punish projects like Wikipedia, and “poses a significant threat to an informed and literate society," according to the research community.
Experts and activists have been protesting bills like this for years, but now there's a real risk that they could become hard law for millions of European Internet users. Follow us at @EFFLive to see what’s happening in the debate.
#Article13 would require mandatory copyright filters on any site that lets users upload their content to the world. These filters would scan every contribution to the Web, and refuse to accept anything that its algorithms believe may be copyrighted material.
What’s being voted on? 		#Article11 of the proposed law would create a new quasi-copyright power that would let news organizations charge others for linking and quoting tiny snippets of their news stories—even when they describe well-known facts, like "Trump Travels to Korea."
Our live coverage of the EUs Parliamentary vote on “Copyright in the Digital Single Market" directive—including #Article13 and #Article11—begins now. Follow us @efflive for commentary. This committee vote may be the last chance a democratic institution has to modify the bill.
