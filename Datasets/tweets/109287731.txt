That‚Äôs why I worked w/ a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce legislation to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under our environmental protection laws. We need to address contamination, increase transparency &amp; hold responsible parties accountable.
NH families shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the safety of their drinking water every time they turn on the tap. As the nationwide PFAS health impact study moves forward, Congress must keep working &amp; take steps to ensure our environment and water supplies are clean.

‚Äú‚Ä¶We are people who are already facing death, either to ourselves or to our child and have to decide what is best in this situation. Each person is different, there is no one size fits all solution‚Ä¶‚Äù
To use Kelly‚Äôs own words: ‚ÄúI would like people to know that people, like me, who have had abortions later in pregnancy are not people who change their mind about having a child. We are people who are loving, caring, and have to make choices that nobody would ever want to make...‚Äù
I recently heard from Kelly in Concord, NH ‚Äì she had to make this heart wrenching decision. No one wants to be in this position. I stand with Kelly, and women and families throughout NH &amp; across the country in defense of maternal and reproductive health.
We must always remember that abortions that are performed later in pregnancy are often done so as a result of severe fetal diagnoses and the serious risks that the pregnancy poses to the life of the woman.
The bill forced by Senate Republicans today would significantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship &amp; pose new obstacles to a woman‚Äôs constitutional right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.
Women should have access to comprehensive reproductive health services without the interference of politicians, and without fear that their providers will be intimidated out of delivering that critical care. Full stop.

I appreciate the President's attention to the fentanyl trafficking issue, and will continue to work with the administration to stop fentanyl distribution in the United States.
Fentanyl continues to be the main cause of overdose deaths in New Hampshire, devastating families and communities all across our state.
Thorough follow through, combined with a recent bipartisan law that stymies the international shipment of fentanyl through the postal service, will go a long way towards keeping this deadly poison off our streets.
This is an important breakthrough that will help save lives but this commitment must be followed by diligent implementation by the Chinese government. https://t.co/oRZzKqUbra

Billy and I send our warmest condolences to the entire Bush family as they lay to rest their beloved patriarch. May he rest in everlasting peace.
Today, I join a grateful nation in mourning the passing of President George H.W. Bush. An exemplary of the greatest generation, his dedication to family and country were unwavering and unmatched.
We cannot go back to a broken health insurance system that makes it more expensive, if not impossible, to find coverage when you get sick. The Senate should come together, reject the admin‚Äôs continued actions to sabotage the ACA &amp; instead work to tackle rising health care costs.
This will promote a race to the bottom for health care coverage standards &amp; protections that patients count on. It will incentivize consumers to drop health care plans that provide quality coverage &amp; cover pre-existing conditions, &amp; then purchase junk insurance that does neither. https://t.co/9oVUJKdIzN

Keeping everyone impacted by the earthquake in Anchorage, Alaska in my thoughts, and praying for first responders. If you or members of your family are affected, please stay safe.
I will do everything in my power to stop this permitting and any efforts to move forward with Atlantic drilling. The Senate should move quickly to consider legislation that I‚Äôve cosponsored with @SenBooker to bar seismic testing in the Atlantic.
The environmental impact of this decision would be catastrophic, further depleting the whale population and many other species that we cherish and are important to our economy.
These seismic tests are an immediate threat to our fishing industry, in addition to the long-term threat to NH‚Äôs economy &amp; outdoor recreation industry posed by an oil or gas leak from drilling.
The Trump administration is laying the groundwork for an environmental disaster on NH‚Äôs Seacoast. https://t.co/flgQzcWGnt

These are important steps forward to combat the opioid epidemic, but more work needs to be done to end the crisis and help families recover. I‚Äôll keep reaching across the aisle to deliver the treatment, care &amp; resources that our communities need.
Drug Monitoring Programs: These play a critical role in identifying &amp; reducing substance misuse. By increasing data sharing among prescribers in Medicaid, we will improve oversight of opioid prescriptions being filled. Reducing the amount of opioids being prescribed is critical.
Help for Moms &amp; Babies: The legislation ensures pregnant women who receive inpatient treatment for substance use disorder will still have Medicaid coverage for the maternity care they need &amp; can continue w/ their recovery.
Alternative Pain Medication: The bill provides support for the development of non-addictive alternatives to opioids &amp; gives @NIH the flexibility it needs to research non-addictive pain therapies, which will help prevent substance misuse.
Medication-Assisted Treatment: This will help increase treatment options for those who need it most, and strengthens our overall response actions to stop the opioid epidemic in its tracks.
The bipartisan opioid response legislation passed yesterday is a necessary stepping stone for additional response efforts that Congress must prioritize. It includes a number of important measures that our communities on the frontlines need and deserve, including:

The callousness of the separation policy is just unconscionable. Every last child must be reunited with their parents w/o delay. Nothing less is acceptable.
The Trump admin must answer for why they separated children from their parents with no plan in place to reunite them. Are we to conclude that there was no intention to reunite these families?
This is a moral outrage. Thousands of children are still separated from their parents.  The Trump Admin must immediately reunite all of these families. https://t.co/N6FwGNMGFO

Omnibus bill provides $3.3B in additional funding to respond to the opioid epidemic‚Äîa fulfillment of the agreement we reached in the Common Sense Caucus. $142 million is set aside for hardest hit states. This is a significant increase to the frontlines of this crisis #nhpolitics

Again and again, studies have found that policies to limit or ban abortion outright have the unintended consequence of dramatically increasing abortion overall.  When family planning services are accessible, rates of unplanned pregnancies and abortion go down.
Just about every woman of my generation has a story about a friend or acquaintance who had to resort to this. We remember those days, and we refuse to be taken back.
I remember the days prior to 1973 when abortion was against the law in most states. An est. 1.2 MILLION women each year resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary conditions by unlicensed practitioners, often resulting in infection, hemorrhage, even death.
FROM MY REMARKS JUST DELIVERED ON SENATE FLOOR: We know from harsh experience that outlawing abortion does not end abortion, it simply drives it into the shadows and unsafe conditions.
This is a pervasive cultural problem at the US Olympic Committee &amp; many governing bodies ‚Äì Congress needs to act to deliver answers &amp; accountability. https://t.co/wjIdaHAXP9

Our democracy is being tested. Our law enforcement agencies are being tested. Our responsibility is clear ‚Äì to come together across party lines &amp; defend the independence of DOJ &amp; FBI and demand that Special Counsel Mueller complete his investigation w/o political interference.
The FBI has thwarted &gt;720 potential acts of terrorism in the last year. I have the utmost confidence in the FBI &amp; Special Counsel Mueller. And so should the President.
The FBI continues to be the gold standard for law enforcement agencies worldwide. The 37K employees of the FBI put their lives on the line every day to protect the American people from violent criminals, terrorist &amp; foreign agents who mean the US harm. https://t.co/jeP4byS02B
Discrediting &amp; deflecting the ongoing investigations into Russian meddling by Congressional Republicans &amp; the President are an affront to our democratic institutions, particularly the partisan assaults lobbed at Special Counsel Mueller &amp; FBI.
When Mr. Mueller was appointed special counsel in May, he was greeted with bipartisan praise for his integrity and professionalism. https://t.co/Eakmz1iR43
W/o a strong US response, institutions &amp; elections here and throughout Europe will remain vulnerable to the Kremlin‚Äôs malign influence operations.
We absolutely know that Russia interfered in our elections. That is a fact. Partisan attacks from the President &amp; his admin dismissing interference compromises our national security &amp; protection of future elections.
The bedrock of democracy is rule of law &amp; it‚Äôs imperative that DOJ, law enforcement agencies &amp; federal prosecutors can do their jobs, independently w/o interference.

I‚Äôm proud to stand with NH students. Silencing them is not the answer.
This kind of voter disenfranchisement sends a message to young people that they‚Äôre not welcome in NH. How about Republicans in NH appeal to the youth vote in NH rather than trying to purge them from the rolls?
The Trump admin shuttered its voter fraud commission because there was no case to be made for widespread fraud in NH or any other state. It‚Äôs time for Republicans in Concord to do likewise &amp; cease attacks on students‚Äô right to vote.
Lack of trust in our elections comes from politicians misleading the public, not students exercising their right to vote.
THREAD: Efforts by Republicans in NH legislature to bar NH students from voting is unacceptable and runs counter to our democratic principles &amp; longstanding electoral history.
NH has more fentanyl overdose deaths per capita than any other state -- interdiction of fentanyl at the border is absolutely critical to saving lives in NH. Glad to have helped push this bill forward &amp; see it signed into law. This is progress, but more work lies ahead. https://t.co/CgjjuK3jxe

All this to pass permanent tax cuts for corporations by adding $1.5 trillion to our national debt. We need a tax bill that‚Äôs fiscally responsible, helps grow our economy &amp; prioritizes the middle class. This is NOT it.
Under #GOPTaxBill, homeowners in NH lose the ability to deduct property taxes ‚Äì a real blow to middle-class families.
Work-study students at colleges &amp; universities will see a steep tax increase which will make college even more unaffordable and discourage higher learning.
College graduates lose out ‚Äì they‚Äôre no longer able to deduct interest on student loans. NH has one of the highest student loan burdens in the country. #GOPTaxBill will make it worse.
Seniors also get hurt ‚Äì the #GOPTaxBill will result in a $25 billion cut to Medicare. Seniors have paid into this program their entire lives. They deserve better.
The #GOPTaxBill again tries to repeal parts of Obamacare which will raise healthcare costs. The American public have already made their voices loud &amp; clear that they don‚Äôt want their healthcare repealed.

How will your bill affect women‚Äôs health? Do you eliminate funding for @PPFA? Are women‚Äôs preventive health services preserved?

Sixteen years into the 21st century, it‚Äôs time to make good on our promise of equal pay for equal work in the United States.
#PaycheckFairness Act would empower women to negotiate for equal pay. It‚Äôs about basic fairness and equal treatment. #EqualPayDay
As @SenateSmallBiz lead Dem I know women small biz face similar gaps. Odds of biz owned by women winning Fed contracts are about 21% lower
40% of US women are sole or primary earners in households w/kids. Equal pay is not only about fairness, but about providing for families
.@ussoccer_wnt players are paid ¬º men‚Äôs team despite generating more revenue. Simply unacceptable. #EqualPay
According to @JECDems as much as 40 percent of the pay gap may be attributed to outright discrimination. #EqualPay4EqualWork
