@nolerogers sure thing. here are the bill numbers if you want to follow them: HB 787 and SB 636.
@robert_heyman Yeah I had the same thought.
Last thing: The proposals include this: "Immunity from prosecution is not available to an aggressor." Reminds me of this deep dive from last year into the meaning of "provokes" in the current law. Is this another (vague) way to accomplish the same point? https://t.co/6kozCgxzjD
Also interesting: The proposals change the standard prosecutors must meet to *disprove* a stand your ground claim from "clear &amp; convincing evidence" to the lower standard of "a preponderance of the evidence." So in  theory it'd make it easier for the state to disprove a claim.
Which he got a lot of pushback on btw. We musn't forget The Politico Story. https://t.co/YxHlZ4nyk5
The word "objectively" is especially interesting after the #MarkeisMcGlockton shooting last year. Much of the sheriff's reasoning for *not* arresting McGlockton's shooter, Michael Drejka, was around the subjectivity of what's considered reasonable, &amp; by whom.
Interesting stand your ground news: Florida lawmakers (Jones &amp; Braynon, both Democrats) filed bills in the House &amp; Senate that would change the use-of-force standard from "reasonably believes" to this. https://t.co/cLF0RZgoII https://t.co/CbiTXvBBCd

The trial is slated to start Aug. 19. Here's the latest on the legal strategy. Whether the defense team argues self-defense (as George Zimmerman's attorneys did), or the subset of self-defense known as stand your ground, will be something to watch. https://t.co/bMWcl2rUNG
So anyway, that will get you caught up on the various spectacles outside the courtroom. But keep in mind the case could have major implications for the debate around self-defense. There are way bigger reasons to keep following this case than the sideshows. https://t.co/XlyslSmZpJ
On top of all of that, a lead @SheriffPinellas detective on the case was fired last month after deputies said he showed up to a death investigation scene drunk. He was also arrested on a DUI charge. https://t.co/NmHkBZPKdG
Last week, William Flores, a young lawyer &amp; Stetson grad, entered the fray. He said he joined the defense team to learn from Trevena &amp; help out where he can. Flores also has a recent DUI arrest and was convicted in December. https://t.co/Lo0XjLi7CI
The docs also revealed a close friendship b/t Trevena &amp; the anchor, Reginald Roundtree. That lead to ethical ?s about Roundtree's Drejka coverage. The station fired him last week. (Roundtree &amp; his lawyer say it's related to age discrimination, not ethics.) https://t.co/QtZOVqCTGE
Then, last month, the head lawyer, John Trevena, aired his personal drama in salacious court documents. He wrote that a prominent TV anchor introduced him to a woman who stole from him &amp; got his wife hooked on drugs. Yesterday, he took it all back. https://t.co/a7XfDscGCw
Up first, a former lawyer on the case, Lysa Clifton, is under Florida Bar investigation for possible solicitation based on a cold call jail visit to Drejka in jail. She withdrew from the case in October &amp; was arrested on a DUI charge weeks later. https://t.co/BslX8O7jID
So remember the stand your ground shooting of Markeis McGlockton in July? Well, alongside this major manslaughter case that sparked a national debate about self-defense, a series of sideshows has been playing out outside the courtroom. Strap in. It's a wild ride. @TB_Times

For those wondering why they don‚Äôt move away, I‚Äôll point to this analysis from a disaster expert. Disasters affect everyone, but especially residents who were already in tough spots before the storm. https://t.co/tybKw1pw8S https://t.co/ifk7CJL4lJ
RVs had become a luxury. The Elliott family lived in one in the driveway of their destroyed rental home. But the landlord has to demolish the house, &amp; finding a permanent spot for the RV hasn‚Äôt been easy in the storm-battered terrain.
But relocate to where? Some residents seeking to answer that question ended up at a tent city behind a church. Jessie Wolf, 72, had lived out of her car for weeks. A tent with an air mattress was better for her back, at least.
Across the street, Latoya Jackson had moved back to her apartment with her two sons. It had minor damage compared to the rest of the complex, so she‚Äôs staying, even as the housing authority asked residents to relocate.
There was 9-year-old Nakyah Williams, living with her mom &amp; siblings below their storm-ravaged bedrooms in their two-story apsrtment. "I don't like to look in there," she said outside her bedroom door. "It makes me sad."

Hurricanes are only getting stronger, as this @ByJoshSolomon story explains. Something to chew on as the Panhandle trudges toward recovery: No Floridians are immune from nature‚Äôs wrath. (Sorry to end on such a sobering note, but it‚Äôs reality y‚Äôall.) https://t.co/jP9B6K5B26
Epilogue: As we drive toward the Tampa skyline, it‚Äôs so weird seeing whole buildings. Everything seems much more fragile now. The AME church with the high steeple, the Metro PCS store (destroyed in Panama City as pictured below), even, or especially, the skyscrapers. https://t.co/uY2RlQfRjY
@MarkPuente Only the one we ate at in PC but hey it was open so I‚Äôll take it.
@craigtimes They lived in separate homes so never hopefully.
I‚Äôll leave you with this: we met so many good dogs on this trip, &amp; cats &amp; even a python named Honey. Shout-out to the pets looking out for their families. Pictured here are Toby, Beanie &amp; Maddie. https://t.co/ygbvHQxu6U
So, keep Panama City, and the whole Panhandle, in your thoughts, or prayers if that‚Äôs your thing. Consider donating to causes you care about. Recovery will take years, &amp; even after that, the city will be changed forever. https://t.co/ovZ2SnLfdM
One man told us he &amp; his dog, Bubs, ran to a neighbor‚Äôs house after the roof blew off his own mid-storm. They were strangers to each other but let him in. They go to church together now, the same church that opened its property to people with no choice but to live in tents.
The sense of community strengthened, too, many residents told us. People knew their neighbors, now, their property no longer separated by trees or fences or judgment.
Amid the wreckage was a strength &amp; gratitude that amazed me. A woman living in a near-condemned apartment complex saying she was one of the lucky ones, for example. We saw lots of #850strong bumper stickers &amp; signs, &amp; we could feel it. https://t.co/UjKQgcfvuw
Residents *wanted* to talk to @monica_herndon &amp; me. Many commented on how the nat‚Äôl media had left as if life was back to normal, but how could that be when their family is living in a camper in the driveway? Or when they get lost in their own town bc landmarks were wiped out?
The piles of debris were staggering. Tree trunks &amp; branches, yes, but also couches, TVs, children‚Äôs books, even a piano keyboard &amp; sheets of hymnal music next to roofless Presbyterian church. The contents of lives, out on the street. Some piles were taller than our Kia Sorento. https://t.co/Nrkc0LfS4M
It‚Äôs been two months since one of the Panhandle‚Äôs worst storms on record, &amp; it‚Äôs still really bad here. Buildings decimated in a way that made me think of tornadoes. Blue tarps covering nearly every home, or just living rooms &amp; bedrooms open to the elements. https://t.co/nB84slN5nZ

More on this: Crump says according to the store owner, the man had a history of harassing black men. We reported on one of those cases in this story: https://t.co/d9QyEYioUV https://t.co/sBq7H9vdm0
Evidence: "In this case there's video that clearly shows Mr. McGlockton was retreating. He was walking back," Crump says. https://t.co/rxTUepfK6N
Crump emphasizes race is a factor in the case, laying out this scenario: https://t.co/xIxsrouTyZ
To Bernie McCabe, Crump says: "There is enough evidence in this case to charge this murderer with a crime."
Draws comparison to Trayvon Martin. Both Drejka and Zimmerman "were allowed to go home and sleep in their beds that night after killing unarmed black men. We have to say no. This is not justice."
"We are here to demand justice for the cold-blooded murder of Markeis McGlockton by the self-appointed, wannabe cop Michael Drejka," Crump says. https://t.co/5OEm3w8Kam

He won't go so far to say he disagrees with it. But he goes back to the adage at the beginning.
Crux is that Drejka was in fear for his life and acted quickly when he pulled the trigger. No words were exchanged between the two men. "I'm not saying I agree with it, but I don't make that call," sheriff says.
"That is within the bookends of stand your ground and within the bookends of force being justified," the sheriff says, noting the Florida legislature, not the Sheriff's Office, made the law.
There's a lot of analysis in this decision that I'll get into in the story, but Drejka will *not* be arrested, sheriff says. The Sheriff's Office is forwarding the case to the State Attorney's Office. Ball's in their court now. https://t.co/POBnwDnwPg
Sheriff says Drejka told deputies he was in fear for his life. Emphasizes that McGlockton didn't just shove him. He slammed him to the ground.

"This guy needs to go to prison," Gualtieri said. "He needs the harshest of consequences... because he put kids in harm's way."
How long was this going on? "I don't know the answer to that. We may never know the total answer to it because as we go back" some people may be gone, hard to get ahold of, etc.
He refused to answer questions when he was arrested, Gualtieri said. When confronted back in January, he denied first, then said he may have skirted a few things. On the verge of the agency starting an internal investigation, he resigned.
Urban worked at the agency for six years. The Sheriff's Office is following up on Urban's cases over the five years before January 2017, too, Gualtieri said.
talking*
Sheriff enacted policy change in response to findings. A supervisor will conduct five random checks a week to make sure investigators are talking to who they say they're talkinh to.
Other child protective investigators are "flat-out mad... To have someone who works among them who is a liar, cheater, scammer... is an affront to all of them, but it's also an anomaly," Gualtieri said.
Urban was arrested this morning at his home in Largo, accused of 10 felony charges of falsifying records, Gualtieri said. Those charges include 40 false entries on 24 different dates.
Agency has rules in place to safeguard process, including briefings with a supervisor on each case. "The reason our processes did not catch Urban's actions is he flat-out lied," Gualtieri said.
72 cases had to be re-investigated. That resulted in two cases in which the children were removed from their homes. One, involving two kids, was an abandonment case. The other, involving three kids, was medical neglect.
Sheriff's Office looked into 142 cases he worked between January 2017 up until his resignation. 75 of them had fabrications. 29 he did no fieldnwork whatsoever, Gualtieri said.
He resigned in January.
Family members said they hadn't spoken to him. After reviewing the case, the agency found he falsified the case, including by saying he talked to the child's grandmother who had been dead since 2014.
In January, another child protective investigator was looking into an allegation of abuse. While investigating that one, she brought up a case Urban had previously looked into with the same family.
Sheriff Gualtieri is starting. The arrested investigator is Steven Urban. https://t.co/ZD6M0odMSR

Thanks all for following. I'm going straight to bed, but look out for the story on https://t.co/jlsGKBT9a1 tomorrow.
@_RigelG It's 12 rooms but not sure how many people are in each one. Also not sure how many of them are living there vs. lodging there.
@_RigelG Nope, that hasn't come up at all.
Andddd it's official.
And there it is. She's against purchase. And Karr just said he's for. So this is pretty much a done deal. The commission is poised to vote 3-2 to send a counter offer of $862k to the owner.
Commissioner Susan Miccio-Kikta is voicing a similar line of thinking. She starts with the fact that she's disgusted residents have referred to Tarpon as a crime cesspool known for prostitution and drugs. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. It‚Äôs just - it‚Äôs appalling."
Commissioner Rea Sieber holding fast to reject the deal. ‚ÄúHow much are we willing to spend? Is that what our job is - to buy every blighted property in Tarpon Springs?‚Äù she says.
Why that number? Because it's 125% of the city-ordered appraisal of the property, which was $690,000. In the past, Tarpon has purchased land within that threshold, mayor says.
The mayor, largely seen as the swing vote, floated the offer first. Commissioner Banther, a staunch supporter of the purchase, made the motion.
Well here's a twist. There's a motion on the floor not to reject or accept the offer but to suggest a new one: $862,000 - $33,000 less than the offer from the motel owner.
Board members will now discuss.
He wants to see the purchase go to the voters via referendum, which is required for the City Commission to buy land for this much. But because this is decided by the Community Redevelopment Area board (same people, different agency), there is no threshold.
A resident just spoke against it. Root of issue is crime, not place where it's happening. ‚ÄúTo come up here &amp; wave a figurative bloody shirt &amp; say that anybody up here who does not vote a certain way is responsible for the crime that takes place? That‚Äôs a lot of bull," he says.
Meanwhile, in the "NO to Sunbay Motel Purchase" Facebook page. https://t.co/dQtwKkX9CZ https://t.co/2WTIR9d8jW
A few have pointed out that the city spent a million dollars on a pool by Tarpon Springs High, so there should be money for this. More on the million-dollar pool: https://t.co/i3AaipFGXn
More people speaking in favor of purchase. Several have circled back to cancer reference. Also, no one seems to disagree the property is a LOT of money but, as one resident said, "Who cares what the price is? ... We don‚Äôt want another black eye in the neighborhood."
Wow. From a local doctor: ‚ÄúSunbay is cancer. And cancer‚Äôs don‚Äôt sit still. They grow, or they metastasize. And when they metastasize, nowhere in the body is safe, and by analogy, no place in the city is safe. What if the next metastasis is the junior high school?"
Two residents after him have underscored the crime problem. One says he's seen crack pipes, needles, at the end of his driveway. Another resident says Tarpon has become a destination for drugs and prostitution.
One resident says he's torn. On one side, the loss of new businesses, residents, etc. may cost more than the purchase of the motel itself. On the other, there are other problem spots (like Eureka). He wants to see a plan for the whole area.
Across the room, a woman holds this sign. Officer K refers to Officer Charles Kondek, who was fatally shot Dec. 21, 2014, at the Eureka Apartments, part of the cluster of troubled properties Sunbay is part of. https://t.co/ZzvJvdHws4
The biggest issue? The price. Also some concern about what precedent this could set for future nuisance properties.
Here we goooooooo. After a thank-you to the residents in attendance &amp; a recap from the city manager, the chairman of the Budget Advisory Committee is explaining why the board voted to reject the deal.
We are just ONE! ITEM! AWAY! from Sunbay. Stay tuned.

The deputies were under the impression Reed had a gun. He was behind a car at the beginning of the confrontation, so they couldn't see his hands, sheriff says.
Deputy Jason Fineran will get a five-day suspension. He turned off the audio on his dash cam video, a policy violation that muddied the investigation.
Deputy Alexander Edge received a 15-day suspension for a violation of the use-of-force policy. He's the one in the video who gets on top of Reed, which Gualtieri said was not necessary for the circumstances.

As for her, she votes in every election. "If I want to b---- about something, at least I've made my voice heard."
She attributed slow turnout at polls to there just being just one question on the ballot for many county voters: the Penny.
She voted yes on the Penny. "It's done good things," she said, pointing to the public safety complex off Ulmerton Road.
