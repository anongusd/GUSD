The crisis is the treatment of immigrants.  The Pres refused to share his source for statistics that don't align with any we can uncover and told his great reporter he doesn't need to declare a national emergency to build the wall, he is doing it so he can "do it faster". https://t.co/7tsvD0437f
@NJFON There is a national emergency - but not as explained by the Pres. The emergency is the treatment of immigrants trying to follow our laws and legally enter the country. #immigrantsmatter

How long will it take before Americans become apathetic and accept not putting forth effort is ok?  üò∞
The police didn't want use any effort....sounds vaguely familiar....didn't the US Government just argue against reuniting immigrant children they ripped from their parents because it would "require extraordinary effort to reunite migrant families"?
Opening a locked door to save 56 girls from burning to death didn't require extraordinary effort from police standing outside. Instead police listened to the cries, the screams and then the silence. https://t.co/DyiBSMSy21
The work of the United Methodist @UMChurch &amp; specifically the women shown here touches the lives of immigrants daily in so many ways, from offering kind word of hope to providing meals, warm clothes &amp; donating to JFON's to help give immigrants free legal services.

According to CBP stats from Oct 2017- Aug 2018, fewer than 3 percent of immigrants stopped at the border had a criminal history. The top crime: illegal re-entry.  Good info..thanks for sharing @JuliaEAinsley.  #ImmigrantsMatter https://t.co/8dWJkU8MIa
Ending DACA would cost Texas nearly $6.3 billion in annual GDP losses - according to research from @amprog .... Let's stand with Congressman @HurdOnTheHill and demand the continuation of DACA and a permanent path to citizenship for DREAMERS.  #ImmigrantsMatter

These parents had their children stolen from them. The trauma these children have experienced will last a lifetime.  No amount of money can compensate. https://t.co/4jyQ0pBsIu
@NIJC @arnoldporter @KRMFLaw @immcouncil The trauma these children have experienced will last a lifetime.  No amount of money can compensate.  These poor parents had their children stolen from them.
Disgraceful. Children torn from their families and not reunited because it would be too ‚ÄòTraumatic‚Äô?  The parents of these kiddos were never found to be neglectful, abusive or bad parents.  These parents risked everything in hopes of giving their children a better life. https://t.co/wLLcErsL7N

It seems President Trump is now asking for a substantial down payment on the wall to support a short-term funding bill to re-open government.  Thoughts?
@JuliaEAinsley Thank you for reporting on this horrible public policy change.  We appreciate you and others for shinning the light on horrible decisions. #ImmigrantsMatter
The idea of asylum is to allow people to seek refuge in a safe country due to life threatening conditions at home - not send them somewhere while we process paperwork. This is maddening.We must stand together against the executive branch changing policy without legislative input. https://t.co/wcbumDJaj2
Thanks to all those who spread the word.  Neither bill passed today but the dem sponsored bill had 2 more votes than the GOP bill...maybe now both parties will sit down and work together to create a solid bi-partisan bill.
My disgust worsens as more immigration policy is changed and created without legislative debate. 	The legislative branch should be creating policy, not the executive branch.	Trump admin plans to begin turning asylum-seekers back to Mexico https://t.co/mt54bo0WcC via @nbcnews

@HillaryClinton Sadly, we turn away deserving immigrants trying to follow the laws daily.  We just don't have the means to help everyone deserving.  Let's hope more Americans choose to get involved with deserving non-profits providing legal support in their towns.

Immigration policy has been changed without legislative debate.  This is WRONG.  We need to demand all immigration policy change be enacted by the legislature, not presidential order.

Well said @chrislhayes. 	The crisis is the lack of respect and dignity being given to immigrants trying to follow the law and seek asylum as directed by our government.  #ImmigrantsMatter https://t.co/xipen32pqJ
Just because someone claims something as fact...don't believe it...no matter the office or title of the person making the claim!  Six is a big difference from the 4,000 claimed by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Friday.  Thanks @JuliaEAinsley for reporting the truth. https://t.co/qxDw8uYTtZ
@cassandrajar @monicarhor The work reporters do helps change the world.  It is through your reporting we see the good, bad and ugly and can rally for change.  Keep up the good fight.
The actions of our gov't have created a humanitarian crisis. Will measures be outlined to immediately increase care for immigrants in custody? Will the address include a promise to allow immigration policy changes to be debated by the legislative bodies of the House &amp; Senate? https://t.co/G1NDIQN2G2
@NBCNews I hope he takes the time to see the impact on American citizens and talk with the immigrants trying to follow the law and apply for asylum.  The ever changing immigration policies make following the law even more difficult for immigrants.  #ImmigrantsMatter
@lehrennbc Thank you for the work you did on the story about immigrants dying while in U.S. custody.  We appreciate you going the extra mile and sharing the horrors immigrants are experiencing.  #ImmigrantsMatter
