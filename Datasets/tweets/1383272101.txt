If you are ever in DC, here‚Äôs how to find him. https://t.co/Id30J8TklA
@jdudemill He feels strongly not to benefit from this. But I did tell him I am going to help him open up a foundation. He has a vision for doing more work.
Abdul wasn‚Äôt bragging. These were things I observed over one long lunch. He has been invited to be on shows in NY and LA and has politely declined. He doesn‚Äôt really get the fuss. He views what he is doing as what he‚Äôs supposed to do.
Since this story appeared people from all over the country have been calling, offering to send him money to help. He has refused it all. He got $650 in cash in an envelope. He used it to buy care packages 4 government workers during the shutdown (who also ate at the restaurant.)
He showed me a woman at another table who also called him because she lost her job and was feeling suicidal. She was losing her apartment. She has been coming in every day. He begged a friend to find her a job &amp; she now answers his friend‚Äôs phone. He told her ‚Äúyou matter to me.‚Äù
-Then a woman cam in and gave him a hug and sat down for a meal. Abdul told me that her boyfriend had been abusive to her &amp; she needed help &amp; saw his clip on TV and he seemed kind. She had no where to turn. He has been helping her.
-A couple came, no longer homeless but had been out of work &amp; having a hard time. He had them sit at the most prominent table and served them a great meal. He told them they brought light into his restaurant. He told them to keep coming back for free meals as long as they wanted.
He told me the greatest blessings have happened to him (Abdul is devoutly religious) since this clip ran. 		That blessing? More people in trouble have come to him and found him. In the course of my two hour lunch with him this happened...
If you watch the clip you‚Äôll know that Abdul has given away 80,000 meals to homeless people. They come in his restaurant and if they can‚Äôt afford to pay, he tells them to sit down and serves them.		He hasn‚Äôt sought publicity but it found him.

There will be many big ideas and small ideas on how to fix health care. @USofCare doesn‚Äôt intend to be a substitute but rather to assist those ideas in getting done.

More:	-People feel disconnected. The ER is not the right place to get care.	-High deductibles may cover people but they don‚Äôt help people care for their families	-Rx drug costs and surprise bills &amp; expenses are evidence health care doesn‚Äôt work

There are tricky elements to the public option being proposed that I won‚Äôt get into here.		One way to guarantee competition &amp; lower premiums, particularly in rural communities, is to have insurance available anyone can buy into. @SenatorBennet has a proposal like this. 6/
There is a big open question here about what insurers should commit to in exchange for better subsidies.		It is time for them to make insurance better. For one: primary care, mental health &amp; key services to stay healthy should never be subject to a deductible.  5/
Tax credits extending to higher incomes make a lot of sense and would quell the large majority of the criticism of the ACA nationally. If Congress had been interested in making it work, instead of criticizing, this would have been done long ago. 4/
Another trend: reinsurance v subsidies at higher income levels. 		The governor proposes subsidies &amp; tax credits‚Äî straight subsidies would work better, but the state doesn‚Äôt think it has the time to implement them in 2020.		This choice is still to be negotiated w the leg. 3/

@charles_gaba And the 2021 delay
@charles_gaba This is why. And the tweet after... mostly it puts the implementation in 2021 after the election.		https://t.co/9ZVeQIbAPZ
For this reason the comments really matter. A strong evidence base of the damage this would cause  will be necessary to keep this from being proposed next year at this time. 11/
I happen to know there has been an ongoing argument in the Administration about these very controversial proposals.		There is a team of hardline destroy-ACA- at-all-costs people.		Another team doesn‚Äôt support the ACA, but also doesn‚Äôt support the shitshow of dismantling it. 10/
@charles_gaba Can explain
(You didn‚Äôt miss 8/. There was no 8/. Like 13 on an elevator.)		Almost done, swear.		9/
There is a lot more in what was proposed. Higher out of pocket limits, lower premiums.		But comments on the auto-reenrollment and silver loading are most critical.		The changes wouldn‚Äôt happen until 2021‚Äì- delaying the negative impact until after the presidential. 9/
Getting rid of silver loading is a sure fire path to raising premiums by a lot and pricing people out of health care.		Why get rid of it? Because it was created in direct response to Trump trying to shock the market in 2017 by eliminating subsidies and increasing premiums. 7/
Silver loading is worth understanding only if you‚Äôre a diehard. Will add links.		But what‚Äôs essential is that it‚Äôs the province of state insurance regulators on how insurance premiums can be reduced.		States. You know, the people the Trump Admin says should have flexibility. 6/
@charles_gaba Totally disagree with you this one time. There is no reason to do this but cruelty.
What happens if it‚Äôs taken away?		You forget to sign up by 12/15. Get a cancer diagnosis in January. Not covered.		With auto-re, covered.		It‚Äôs already automated, and how people are used to operating.		Undermining Obamacare is the only conceivable reason to dismantle this.5/
Auto reenrollment is simple. It means that like most employer coverage, if you forget to sign up for coverage, yours won‚Äôt get taken away.		With auto-reenrollment, you can still reject coverage by not paying the bill. 1.8 million use it every year to keep continuous coverage. 4/
The 2 important areas where the public needs to comment are:		1) auto reenrollment	2) ‚Äúsilver loading‚Äù		They sound obscure, but like every other act of sabotage (CSRs, risk adjustment, mandates), are basics to keep things working in the background. So Trump wants to gut them.3/
These actions invite public comment on 2 activities that are highly controversial because they are highly destructive.		Americans need to comment.		I will provide details shortly. Follow if interested. 2/

This is the worst stock market week since 2008.	This is the worst stock market month since 1931.	Most Americans have lost 10% of their savings or more.		Markets hate chaos, corruption, and heading in the wrong direction. In other words, Trump.

‚ÄúGovernment is bad and we‚Äôll show you when we‚Äôre in charge of it.‚Äù		A Republican state Senator in MN criticized the ACA because the Feds can‚Äôt be counted on (under Trump) to keep their word.
When the Feds have spent 2 years tearing down the ACA, calling it dead, cancelling payments, sticking it to blue states, and attacking pre-ex condition protections, it‚Äôs not surprising they don‚Äôt get any benefit of the doubt.		They‚Äôve earned that. /end
While this is worked out the Feds need to be 100% transparent and available and the press and public should keep it visible.		You see... (my close is coming don‚Äôt worry...üòï)6/
When Tom Price was Secretary of HHS, the way MN was treated was horrible. That trust was violated.		MN is likely owed money from a decision from then. But even putting aside the merits, Price kept MN waiting an unreasonable amount of time., purposely creating uncertainty.5/
Much of health care is set up to be a stage-Federal partnership. Feds often reimburse states for costs. That number is estimated upfront and then needs to be trued up.		When that happens, a small Federal govt blip is a potential state govt crisis. 4/

If we want better care for more people more affordably, we won‚Äôt get there until we have strategies to defeat the inequalities, the money, and the political process that so dominates our system.		We can do these things if we begin by identifying them wherever they exist. /end
The third threat is our broken and corrosive politics which work against the public health in so many ways &amp; can‚Äôt get fixed until public officials become more responsive to the needs of the public.		Our midterm election featured this theme prominently. /6 https://t.co/S50GILWFEA
The second threat is the obsession with revenue, which in many parts of health care can hamper the focus on patient care, sometimes overtly, sometimes subtly. 5/ https://t.co/kwHY5AcrQT
The first threat is the vastness of the inequality of care based on race, income and zip code.		There is a 12 year life expectancy difference between wealthy zip codes and NEIGHBORING poor ones.		This will undermine the entire health care system 4 millions until we change. 4/ https://t.co/rbckkoccRd

What was good about this is it became a movement towards making sure there was better communixation, people were sent home after surgery or to the best rehab centers. And if quality was good and money was saved, that‚Äôs how the care team and hospital got paid. 4/

Consumers will be required to send a separate payment for the tiny portion of their insurance that is attributable to abortion services.		This is being done to show that taxpayer funds aren‚Äôt being used but likely creates an incentive not to cover abortion services. 5/
Consumers without proper documents or whose income changes unexpectedly could find they have to pay back their subsidies. 4/
This rule would add oversight to make sure people aren‚Äôt receiving the inappropriate subsidy (if their income changes unexpectedly) or if they should be in another program. 3/

We should lower Rx drug costs and introduce a public option and more.		But it should be clear now the the Congress and Administration when messing with the ACA as they continually do are messing with something that works for millions and could work even better w any effort.		/end
There is evidence the Administration is still contemplating purposely harmful rule changes for 2020 that would raise rates a lot and make it harder for people to enroll.		And if Congress doesn‚Äôt change hands, more serious threats.
And I know there are great @HHSGov and @CMSGov career employees (aka the deep state) that have great work to make things work under often very trying circumstances.		 Ow the job is far from finished...
Now, about the Trump Administration claiming some credit for rates coming down, despite what I just said earlier, I have no problem with that.		I am glad for the team there to feel ownership in the results No matter how they arrive.
Win a solid amount of effort‚Äî getting insurers back into the market, extending reinsurance, marketing, and promoting stability, rates can come back down much further. This is effort that I hope the Administration takes on.
The ACA is alive because it was built to be durable. It has some inherent protections.		It be clear‚Äî the end of the mandate, pulling of CSRs, Swiss cheese plans, 90% cut to marketing‚Äî all these things and others really hurt.		Rates should be down 10-15% on average.
But the more important point is these results‚Äî and the Admin‚Äôs own press release indicate‚Äî Trump was wrong* when he said over and over ‚ÄúObamacare is dead.‚Äù Rates are going down. It‚Äôs working. 		*Alternative explanation: he lied.
First, as @larry_levitt points out, the principal reason premiums are decreasing is insurers‚Äô profits are off the charts. They had freer rein to raise rates last year w Trump, there was a lot of uncertainty w Trump‚Äôs threats &amp; insurers raised rates a lot.		https://t.co/u9mlv2GHPf

@alevine014 About that reality. I hope people draw a line at what they won‚Äôt countenance any longer.		Because as of now, Trump gets vindication from every action from supporters. It doesn‚Äôt just not temper him or encourage him, it allows him to push to the next level. Only Rs can stop him.
@alevine014 I‚Äôm friends with enough Republicans who feel very conflicted. Some can‚Äôt support him any longer. Others keep moving the line of what‚Äôs acceptable and justify it by trying to keep it relative to what they imagine Hillary Clinton to be, and believing worse and worse stories...
@alevine014 Drawing a line, no less sympathetic to the concerns in rural communities, taxes, judges. So I‚Äôm not asking that Republicans walk from Trump and become a Democrat or change their values. I‚Äôm hoping those values cause them to put country over party.
@alevine014 It shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if this leads to a 1974. My ask is when will good people in the Republican Party say enough is enough‚Äî leaders like yourself and others. There has to be a point. And it doesn‚Äôt mean stopping being conservative. Flake is no less conservative by . . .
@alevine014 ...away from being a mainstream party that believes in what you describe people wanting. Because people like Trump will deliver what sells only as long as it sells. And be willing to call Obama a Muslim if need be, a Hispanic judge in-American or anyone not with him against him.
@alevine014 entirely by corporations, other candidates and party leadership. So when someone takes the well worn idea of ‚Äúconservative‚Äù as it used to mean and bastardizes it to bend to the whims of a demongauge and good people support them, it is likely to change the identity of the GOP...
@alevine014 We believe we are best served when there are two good ethical candidates in every race and that even if your person loses, there is someone who you disagree with but can respect and listen to representing you.		But we‚Äôve lost that because competitive races are funded almost ...
@alevine014 There is now no profit in agreement. Much more political money can be raised by disagreement. Trump didn‚Äôt event this, but he exploits it. My wife and I are both strong Democrats but strongly believe we need two great parties once again.
@alevine014 In the course of that even the places we agree we can‚Äôt get to agreement. Few people believe that most refugees are gangs members and few believe in open borders. Most support DACA and comprehensive reform.  But...
@alevine014 Nobody should be demonized or characatured on either side. People are desperate and are reaching for left and right sounding solutions, but not always with a political identity but a fear of losing the basics‚Äî like the simple ability to care for their families.
