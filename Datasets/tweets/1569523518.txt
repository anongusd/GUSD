California has always been a leader in emissions regulations. I want to know how many of the jackholes with the Sun Up Your Butt Movement know even the basic history of the Clean Air Act, &amp; how California's state-level regulations have pushed the country's regulations as a whole.
To the desperately uninformed going after #DianneFeinstein GET HER NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH. She has served California citizens since she was 36 years old. She was first elected to local office right around the time California was implementing the 1st emissions standards.

Your tweet is telling DEMS to fight the GOP over criticism for bigotry &amp; stupidity committed by politicians operating under the Dem banner, yet those very same politicians can't be bothered to go after the GOP, as they are too busy attacking fellow Dems?  WTF are you smoking?
These women also make a habit of attacking Dems - they DON'T attack the GOP. Your current posse will protest the shit out of @SpeakerPelosi, but can't be bothered to protest Mitch McConnell - why is that, ya think?
No one put those words in Ilhan's mouth. No one forced AOC to fvck up the #GreenNewDeal rollout to the point that it's  unlikely anyone will take it seriously. Those women made their own mistakes. Dems are not responsible for covering up for them.
The Dems stood up to bigotry happening IN THEIR OWN RANKS. As they should. Dems don't have control over what the GOP does to its racist members, but they do have some measure of influence on those operating under the Dem banner. You expect antisemitism from Dems to get a pass? NO
The more I think about this, the more disgusted I am. This reads as some kind of threat - what are you suggesting, @RevDrBarber? That you and your trio of GOP-funded "Justice Dems" are going to come after Dems for the actions of the GOP? WTAF kind of BS are you spewing?? https://t.co/GA8SzdV3NW

@Gus_802 @RevDrBarber @ncnaacp @UniteThePoor it was shocking to me when I saw it go down. absolutely shocking. and heartbreaking.
.@RevDrBarber - are you ready to tell the people in NC who would benefit from #Medicaid expansion that you said "no thanks"?  #hkonj
Case in point. This is how you make the perfect an enemy of the good. There are thousands of people in NC who could be covered if we expand Medicaid. This rhetoric encourages people to eschew efforts to do so. 🤨  #hkonj 		https://t.co/1zRhsPQCX6
I love that my rep @RepDavidEPrice &amp; state pols @juliefornc @MikeWoodard &amp; showed up, they always do - true public servants. 		But I don't see Rev Barber as shining a light any more. I see him empowering people who are making it harder for us to actually make progress.  #hkonj
I still believe in all the causes of justice, and I support all the partner orgs who are active in trying to make things better every day - incomplete list: @NCNAACP @democracync @PPSATNC @NARALNC @equalitync @PS1NC @elpuebloinc @NCAIDSAction @ncjustice etc.   #hkonj
@yesica @RevDrBarber Did you go today? I didn't. I don't know anyone who did - out of the dozens of people I would have contacted to meet up with in past years...not a single one planned to attend.
Instead, he surrounded himself with those abusers &amp; glorified them. In doing so, he lost his moral authority in the eyes of many of us. When he got on stage w/Sanders &amp; Sarsour &amp; started using the same smears as the bros, it was done. I now see his calls as pretty empty. #hkonj
I think many of us who were involved in - committed to - #ForwardTogether in NC had every expectation that @RevDrBarber would call out and condemn the abusive bro crap, and the "or-bust" mentality that makes the perfect the enemy of the good. Especially after the 2016 #hkonj.

@Rob_Schofield https://t.co/XypCYcAgDH
@Rob_Schofield Hey Rob - Having been involved in the #ForwardTogether movement since 2013, I have some thoughts on the causes of the dwindling draw to HKonJ... 		https://t.co/64qeGmusZJ
if you weren't enough of a "comrade" to vote for ~gasp~ Hillary Clinton in 2016, you sure as shit aren't doing anyone any good now.
I have a serious problem with folks who are all of a sudden super concerned about the ICE arrests of hundreds of folks in the NC Latino community who spent all of 2016 suppressing the vote by telling their friends that Hillary and Trump were the same. 		#Hkonj #HKonJ2019
Even if @RevDrBarber refuses to acknowledge what's going on, at some point SOMEONE in the coalition - likely @NCNAACP - is going to have to grapple w/ the drop in interest &amp; figure out how to fix it. That's the purpose of this thread - insight as to why fewer of us are showing up
note that the sparse crowd that showed up to #hkonj includes buses of folks from around the state, and weather was pretty hospitable. previous years drew 10+ times in numbers of local folks, in absolutely miserable weather. 		#HKonJ2019
here's some more background on Linda's arrogant dismissal of Hillary Clinton, and the tens of millions of women who voted for her enthusiastically. Were you unaware of this @RevDrBarber? Or do you just not care what we think?  #hkonj 	https://t.co/x58TFxW2qY
Some of us have been raising our voices about this stuff for a while now; folks tried in good faith to engage @UniteThePoor @wilsonhartgrove @knightopia in conversations about this toxicity that is crippling your work, but we were ignored and/or attacked. It's just sad. #hkonj
Rev, you must see by this point that the good will you had left over from #MoralMonday is wearing out. The new people you are attracting are those who want to destroy, not build. Those of us who always turned out for #MoralMonday are not going to turn out to support abusers.
.@RevDrBarber actually counts Linda Sarsour as a "good friend" - this is appalling. Her behavior is the antithesis of everything that made #ForwardTogether movement great. She wasn't out there getting people to the polls. She wasn't out there uniting, Rev. #hkonj
For all practical purposes, @RevDrBarber has abandoned the things that made me admire him. With no focus on unity, no rebuke of those espousing divisive sexism and bigotry, and no emphasis on the NECESSITY of voting to minimize harm, why would I show up? What good is it? #hkonj
These women - who launched themselves into the spotlight on the backs of millions of Hillary supporters, many LGBTQ &amp; many Jewish - have yet to make appropriate, convincing denouncements. Now @liztheo, @RevDrBarber's partner in @UniteThePoor, is on the @womensmarch board. #hkonj
even more horrifying - Tamika Mallory &amp; Linda Sarsour's uncritical proximity to antisemitism and homophobia... I met the amazing @Leslieks through #MoralMondays... How can I support someone who okay with people's antisemitism toward her, @RevDrBarber?  I can't. I won't. #hkonj
Linda is a vote suppressor - she actively told people that it was okay to not vote, or vote third party. Seeing @RevDrBarber team up with her for the #PoorPeoplesCampaign was a horrific joke. How could this champion of voting elevate such irresponsible, harmful fuckery? #hkonj
Linda Sarsour also did not vote for Clinton in 2016. She went on to appropriate the activism of millions of women who gathered in DC to march in 2017 - we did not appoint her to speak for us - MOST of us were there for Hillary - but Linda had other ideas..	https://t.co/paAUVVWXtl
These are vote suppressors. They are a big part of how we arrived at this horror. Those of us who were core members of the #MoralMonday #ForwardTogether movement are simply stunned &amp; horrified that @RevDrBarber has cast his lot with this mentality.  How did that happen? #hkonj https://t.co/blcgJxiCvS
This is the kind of ridiculous crap they are STILL out there spewing. You see this ALL THE TIME from Bernie/DSA/TYT related accounts. Straight out of the Russian agitprop playbook. 		I'd like to know what @RevDrBarber &amp; @UniteThePoor think about these absurd smears. #hkonj https://t.co/dPDoq1KKyK
Another awesome NC Democrat, @MikeWoodard, who ALWAYS shows up to #hkonj &amp; other community events where he can talk to voters face-to-face. He's a huge advocate for women's health &amp; safety. 		Yet this is the kind of leader "brand new congress" &amp; "justice dems" are out to destroy. https://t.co/Mu2Lmg0KhI
What makes the whole thing so stunning to me is this is the element that tried to sabotage the 2016 #hkonj ... the Bernie coalition claimed they had been disinvited, and smeared @RevDrBarber, Rev Gatewood, and Bob Hall of Democracy NC. It was a shitshow. https://t.co/RVByNkDJEs
I'm using examples from John, because he is the poster child bro - but this behavior is rampant in the DSA/Our Revolution/Justice Dems/Brand New Congress arena. It is explicitly and unapologetically misogynist and racist. 	This will not build a coalition. #ForwardTogether? #hkonj https://t.co/5Wz1V7VFtD
If anyone at @UniteThePoor or @BRepairers or @RevDrBarber himself are listening, your embrace of this toxic element is why you are losing so much support. It's what made the #PoorPeoplesCampaign fizzle, and it's why the crowd was so low for the #hkonj #MoralMarch https://t.co/QodJPAChDN
Here's John, telling us what BNC is all about - and it's not policy outcomes. 		#ForwardTogether #hkonj https://t.co/xbsl7nKSuT
THIS is the element that created "Brand New Congress" &amp; "Justice Dems" - How in the world does @RevDrBarber think that women are going to overlook this abusive crap? These people are not interested in #ForwardTogether. #HKonJ https://t.co/WBOh3x9Pd9
"neolib" is his favorite insult. 	https://t.co/Q1kHjFvWeD
He's appallingly divisive, antagonistic, and unhelpful - and that's when he's having a good day. This is the antithesis of #ForwardTogether - yet @RevDrBarber @UniteThePoor @BRepairers @PullenChurch lay out the red carpet for this BS. #hkonj #MoralMarch https://t.co/oXdfjdCXWK
Here is one of the bros' most vocal (and vile) associates. His hobby is misogyny. Ask any woman on twitter who has expressed criticisms of Bernie. He is at the core of the Justice Dems/TYT/Brand New Congress crowd. #hkonj https://t.co/778HzWZdar
Women were key allies in #MoralMonday - they represented more than half the civil disobedience arrests. When @RevDrBarber embraced the berniebros, he turned his back on them &amp; turned a blind eye to the systemic abuse in the bro culture. #hkonj  https://t.co/iCmrrjHpv1
The strength of the #MoralMonday movement came from its ability to rally all kinds of people with different background in to a common purpose. The MO of the Bernie crowd is to attack anyone who is not in lockstep with their twisted version of all-or-nothing progressivism. #hkonj
@Leslieks the estimates were like 80k, but a lot of people disputed that number. I think it had to be at least 50k, though.
@Leslieks Barber spoke this year (he was sick last year).  It's still a coalition, with NCNAACP at the center, but Rev B isn't with them anymore.
They represent the most toxic, abusive elements from the 2016 campaign. Their surrogates regularly abused and harassed women, especially WOC, throughout 2016 and beyond. They're doing it today. They are not #ForwardTogether. #hkonj #moralmarch https://t.co/ijBuLi4UgY
This is what I'm talking about in terms of the #berniebro element corrupting the #MoralMonday movement - these guys are anything but #ForwardTogether. @PullenChurch just gave itself a huge strike by hosting these people who are out to destroy Dems. #hkonj  https://t.co/XcYqrNSsqO
So sad. I am sure @RevDrBarber sees the decline as he looks out over this sparse #hkonj crowd. Hopefully he @UniteThePoor &amp; @BRepairers will open eyes and ears to the problem many of us have articulated: You can't be #ForwardTogether when your agenda is attacking allies. https://t.co/rW0gKaNy8q
@Leslieks i think they pulled about 2000 people this year. The loudest social media presence I've seen comes from "anti-capitalist" oriented accounts. All the local orgs are there - PP, NARAL, EqualityNC, etc., but the grassroots energy is missing. So sad.
Here's the 2015 #HKonJ #MoralMarch ... before the toxic #BernieBro element formed and started to chip away at the genuine grassroots progressive activism of #ForwardTogether. https://t.co/nVqGg5jAcm
This is the 2014 #hkonj - people could barely move. It was massive. https://t.co/ahS4blPsLp
This was 2017 - this was before @RevDrBarber started hanging out with people who told people it was okay to not vote.   #hkonj #forwardtogether #moralmarch https://t.co/9SaHiAomi2
For reference - the 2019 #hkonj turnout... https://t.co/agvYihLI7h
My awesome Rep. David Price is always at #hkonj, too. He's in the trenches working to help NC citizens every day. He's awesome. But the DSA &amp; "Brand New Congress" folks tear people like him to shreds. I'm horrified that @PullenChurch is hosting them. Opposite of #forwardtogether. https://t.co/mwdmUKoBLC
Now here's an old school #MoralMarch #ForwardTogether #hkonj vibe. These folks have turned out for years -there for every step of the fight for voting rights &amp; will never turn their backs on voting, because they understand the danger of making the perfect the enemy of the good. https://t.co/Z0gevFlpaV
This is the smallest turnout I've seen for #HKonJ.  The BernieBro element has chased away many people.  Local orgs who have been consistently working to address specific issues in NC are still there, but without the public energy behind them - the DSA/bro elements sucked it out. https://t.co/OEV3vltmGi

@Bret_Lieuallen @Kyruer No. Not if you intend to be effective as opposed to incendiary. If you want to help, this is not the path.
This is the result of "or-bust" mentality. This is why I cannot abide those who did not vote, who encourged others to not vote, and who are, even today, more dedicated to a cult of personality and slogans than they are outcomes. https://t.co/Tk1uEQracF
@LuluLemew @Remote_Interior I should see if that trial is going to be open to the public...

@wmcarterelliott @elonmusk I'm all for serious policy discussion for addressing climate change, and am not arguing for combustable engines. I'm simply appalled that the Dems allowed that disaster of a document to be released and to make a mockery of the whole discussion. So disappointing.
@wmcarterelliott @elonmusk agree that electric is an improvement - but we're still at, what, at least 60% of energy consumption in the US coming from fossil fuels?  And then there's that nasty problem with cobalt, lithium &amp; other mined materials required for batteries.

she doesn't know how electric cars work, does she? 		"Totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle	manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere."		This is just shifting the source of carbon emissions, not eliminating emissions..

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂		"Major examples of government investments in “new” tech that subsequently spurred a boom in the private section include DARPA projects, the creation of the internet - and, perhaps most recently, the government’s investment in Tesla."
"Why can’t we just rely on regulations and taxes and the private sector to invest	alone such as a carbon tax or a ban on fossil fuels?"		i just can't... this entire thing is indefensible. Was there NO ONE available who could at least craft a coherent sentence?

oh, you're unwilling to work?  WE GOT YOU, FREELOADER!  		"Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work"
Did a 4 year old write this? 		"Ensure justice and equity for frontline communities by prioritizing investment, training, climate and community resiliency, economic and environmental benefits in these communities."

@LGJustinFairfax Please do NOT resign. This is a clear attempt by the GOP to weaponize Dems' morality in order to gain power and enact racist policies TODAY.

@rootadvantage C. Thomas Howell still stands by that movie. I haven't seen it in forever, but I recall liking it at the time. And his career has not skipped a beat over it. (I believe Rae Dawn Chong stands by it as well.)
