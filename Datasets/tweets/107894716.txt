On defense, yes they held the Pats to 13, but their secondary lined up 2 outside, leaving the slot open for Edelman and they couldn’t get them off the field.
@Greg651 @Fromthedougout By the same token, if Brady throws a couple of better balls it might have been a blowout. So just judging Belichick vs McVay (especially considering McVay is an offensive guru), he got outcoached. He admitted it himself! No shame in it, BB is the Goat.

@mike_petriello I have to be consistent - your statement on the podcast about the difficulty of a hustle stat doesn’t add up. Hustle isn’t going past your peak- it’s how often you play at your peak. And it’s just as difficult for Machado to go past his ability as Hamilton.

Whatever “judicial temperament” is needed for a SCOTUS justice is necessary to be a federal judge on the DC Circuit as well, on which Kavanaugh served to almost unanimous praise. Law professors know this, and that letter shows just how many political activist law profs out there.

@Oh_Jesse Right. So both sides have legit concerns which is why we are where we are. The only things I think could’ve been done different are: a) Feinstein sitting on that letter for weeks; and b) GOP should’ve at least brought down Mark Judge.
@ChaikelK She might have thought she can kill 2 birds with one stone and get away with it.
@Oh_Jesse ☝️This is the scenario that needs to be avoided. If everyone can agree to simply keep it to the Ford allegations I’m in. 	Also, who does the investigation? We know Trump and his cult don’t trust the FBI anymore. Robert Mueller? Rosenstein? Do we want to go down that path again?
@Oh_Jesse Or, during the delay more Avenatti-type gang-rape allegations sprout up, with people demanding an i dependent investigation into each one, ensuring that it remains open into the midterms. Bad precedent to set.
@edrhew Completely agree. How much of a bum does this guy look like that just having him there is a no-no for Republicans
Not sure what Avenatti thought he was accomplishing, but I’m convinced it worked to Kavanaugh’s advantage. Can we all agree he is not a gang rapist?
And I think underpinning all of this is a widely-held notion - no one will ever admit publicly - that 1 teenage drunken clumsy sexual encounter, that could have been perceived differently by each drunk party, may not be disqualifying after 35 years immaculate adulthood.
@Oh_Jesse Absolutely. Except Republicans have a legitimate concern that this is all a delay tactic to push the open seat past the midterms. If there was some way to compromise around that I’d be in. And, irregardless, I think it’s crazy that this guy Judge wasn’t heard from.
If I’m a senator I have no idea how I would vote. On 1 hand, gun to my head, I believe her (maybe not necessarily rape, but *something* went down). OTOH, I’m deeply unsettled about accepting a charge of 35 years ago with no hard evidence, &amp; particularly how the Dems played this.
This is not a reason not to at least even ask for his testimony. If he pleads the 5th that would be incriminating (in the court of public opinion) unto itself. https://t.co/DecOP2hWAv

In an era where - rightfully so - there is zero tolerance for a single act of domestic abuse, even emotional abuse as we saw with Chris Hardwick - I wonder about the bouquets thrown to the man who publicly shames his wife to millions on an almost daily basis.
I believe he’s smart enough to know how the public is taking his tweets. And if he doesn’t - all he needs to do is see his replies. Hard to make the argument he’s being a good husband.
@Greg651 And btw - all he needs to do is see his replies to know how his tweets are being interpreted. Hard to make the argument he’s being a good husband.
@Greg651 Again, this is all lawyer-speak, parsing his statements. Like I said, he knows how his attacks on Trump admin’s lies reflect on his wife who is communications director, that was excoriated for using the term “alternative facts”
@Greg651 Sometimes you just have to go with occam’s razor that he’s a passive-aggressive who loves the attention and accolades he is getting from the “resistance”
@Greg651 Come on that’s a stretch how could she be okay with him calling out her lies publicly? And to what end? How about just not tweeting and dealing with it at home?
@Greg651 I thought of that too but I think he’s smart enough to know his wife’s place in Trump’s orbit of lies - or at least the public’s view of it
I’m not saying I can’t see disagreeing politically with your spouse, or even having deep issues with her ethically or morally. Some things belong in the family. Passive-aggressively taking to twitter with these issues shows me what kind of man he is.

@forestmconner @Oh_Jesse Ok even if the guns come from outside the city, the guns are *being used* inside - which was the initial point about not fearing for your life in the street - hence Chicago murder rate substantially higher than Indiana’s. So, again, it’s about other factors, not legality of guns.

What a strange way to present this finding. There is a strong men-women divide across both parties. https://t.co/9qg33ryFMK
Was literally about to ask what Louise Mensch knows about Avril Lavigne. Contemporary real news will put parody out of business. https://t.co/gHRFkcKhmA
I will say the lyrics to "My Happy Ending" are incredibly haunting knowing what we now know (yes, I say 'know') about Avril.
Props to @givenchyass the foremost journalist of our time for uncovering this massive conspiracy. Who plays her (?) in the inevitable movie?
I for one will not rest until I see Avril Lavigne and Melissa What's-her-face in the same room together. Make it happen @JimmyKimmelLive!
It's gone mainstream! @realDonaldTrump - if ever there was a reason for an independent investigation... https://t.co/Dt4XsAffnq

No wonder Rosenstein threatened to quit.
For example, Spicer gets ridiculed mercilessly, but how can he possibly do his job when he's told of an axing an hour before?
Reading the WaPo story I was struck by how many public servants may actually be competent but are made to look silly by this blowhard POTUS.
@Greg651 You're saying Americana and I'm thinking Italian-American. All is missing is a letter to Don Corleone on the day of his daughter's wedding.

@ajz510 Is what David Wright said after that high five
Do the Mets charge David Wright for the water and sunflower seeds on the bench?
Hey a David Wright sighting! Do they let the mascot onto the field?

@thatgirlondeck Yup but you'd have been long gone by the time i got to it
@thatgirlondeck Girl you must be a Matt Harvey fastball the day after he was up all night with Adriana Lima, because- I'd hit that.
@thatgirlondeck Girl you must be the highest qualifier for a Nascar race because tonight you're sitting on the pole
@thatgirlondeck K one more: Girl you're a Crosby in the streets, but I'll bet you're an Ovechkin in the sheets.
@thatgirlondeck Girl let's be like MMA and make my boxers disappear
