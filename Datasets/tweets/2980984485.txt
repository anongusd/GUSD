@rich4life @doyinokupe I am yet to see an actual statement condemning the actions toward the Ibos from him..	May be,I am lost in the woods,on this!
@thehill Jokers!!!!!!
@doyinokupe I tend to wonder why the south westerners can’t seem to call out Tinubu for all these problems?		He is the problem in Lagos- those thugs wittingly or unwittingly,take directives from him!
@AOC Very correct!
@LanceEdwardsChr @GlennFink3 @Inappropemle @IlhanMN When public discourse is relegated to religious inclinations,it is akin to mental slavery and knowledge disarmament. 		I don’t need to see these photos to know that religion has made us look more into what divides us,than what unites us as humans!
@maddow I only plead with the democrats to act,and talk less.The end justifies the means; cos we all want accountability by this administration..
@Inappropemle @GlennFink3 @IlhanMN You have to be born again..
@Inappropemle @jhall723 @IlhanMN Beg that same god to help you now: you have to show love to people,no matter who they worship
@Inappropemle @GlennFink3 @IlhanMN If you base your acceptance of people on a god you haven’t seen,then you don’t even know the reason for existence- love your neighbor as you love yourself!!!
@Inappropemle @jhall723 @IlhanMN What ever god you worship,I suppose doesn’t make you hate others,irrespective of their religious inclinations!
@IlhanMN People don’t really understand the forces against this congresswoman. My prayer for you,is that God guides you,as you discharge your duties in the Congress,without fear.Keep doing your thing,irrespective of whose ox is gored— don’t be weary!!!
@ShehuSani This is where investigative journalism should swing into action,but these lazy journalists-Punch newspapers included,would never follow through with this news— very sad!		If the Nigerian press was viable,our democracy should have been more glowing..
@MrAyeDee @atiku @NGRPresident This is bullying...
@AOC That’s why I like this congresswoman- breath of fresh air.	You need to call out these guys,cos all they do,is to divide the Democratic Party from within. That’s the worst kind of enemy you can ever have!
@MrBanksOmishore @PDP_2019 @MBuhari So true..
@realDonaldTrump I am not an ethics guy,but shouldn’t this be unethical?
@ShehuSani Who are these gun men terrorizing the North?Northerners should set aside partisan politics and religious bigotry,and fix this mayhem eating into the daily fabric of the society.		The peril in the north - poverty and insecurity- is incomprehensible!
@chucktodd I pray they keep this up- enough of the stupid Trump’s coverage 👍🏾
@DeleMomodu You were stunned??
@AOC @USPS Thank you@AOC— you really feel the pulse of the common man👍🏾
@eugenegu That’s my man...💪🏾💪🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👌🏾👌🏾
@DeleMomodu My people are suffering: reason why these politicians take advantage of the citizenry,by giving them crumbs for their votes.	Nigeria is still in the primitive phase of both economic and human development.
@realDonaldTrump Boy.... you lie as well,yet you and your Republican minions want us to look somewhere else-so sad!		At least,Michael has owned up to his not so proud life style in the past, when will you do same?
@SarahPalinUSA Republicans—always chasing https://t.co/fAkdsLeUSB guys are doing more damage to this country,than you realize!
@HenshawKate Chai..my role model@kate Henshwa must have been pained,to be expressing herself in this manner.	You are a true patriot- wish we had more Nigerians like yourself🙏🏿
@Viva56860733 Exactly-that’s why Dino was victorious- he published all the results in real time,making it difficult to rig him out,even when there were attempts at doing that!
@fkeyamo As a legal luminary,isn’t it illegal for the military to be part of a democratic election process?		This is totally unacceptable,’cos of the dangerous precedence your party is creating for Nigeria’s nascent Democracy!
@JRubinBlogger @AP @EricTalmadge What about Pompeo??Michael Cohen said it: “ Trump is an enigma,and would influence your character,until you realize how much of a liar,you’ve turned out to be” -paraphrasing!!		I just pity for those working for Trump!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Very funny..for a meeting he wasn’t supposed to set up!	Trump thinks foreign policy is a child’s play.The young man from NK,just proved to Mr. Trump,how much of a dotard; he actually is!
@GOP @IvankaTrump This party seems like a subsidiary of the Trump estate.Such a shame for the party of Lincoln! 	#SavetheGOP!
@AshaRangappa_ Very sad.That’s the reason why you have to be careful,how much you display your dubious-lying character in-front of your kids,cos they might just pick it up,like a standard lifestyle.	The fish gets rotten from head,down the body!
@soledadobrien I am the least surprised.Van is an arrogant man,looking for ways to seek relevance beyond his bloc- self acclaimed hero!
@todayng You didn’t contest on a free and fair basis..Let citizens exercise their civic duties- seeking redress in a court of law,should you feel dissatisfied with a process.
@neeratanden That’s what arrogance does; blindfolds you,all in the quest for relevance.	Van feels like a self acclaimed superstar- one of those men that have superiority complex,unaware of the implications of junketing with people that are out of touch with modern America!
@abbydphillip @SunlenSerfaty Why Kenya?
@_SJPeace_ Over pampered kids,that end up becoming entitled ladies.Calling the cops for that,is totally stupid!
@iKingMillie @dondekojo Na wa for our country oo..Suffer too plenty 😭😭
@DammyFrancos Nigerians keep embracing mediocrity: one reason amongst many others,why our country is where it is today..
@McFaul The progress of having a “meet and greet” session. Poor Pompeo- has been turned into a schoolboy..
@GOPLeader Truth be told; he had no biz going to meet the NK leader,in the first https://t.co/KLTBs4WQV7 with their hypocrisy!!		Trump just embarrassed himself,and it was obvious during the press conference,that he was frazzled!!
@oagbakoba @MBuhari Yea,however,it would still be in the interest of posterity for this assertion to be tested in the court of law.
@ananavarro Lame guy ..
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 I so love this country,irrespective of her shortcomings🙈	The congressman is now apologizing,knowing quite well he could be punished for trying to intimidate a witness via social media and other public utterances- oh,my beloved America: Bold and Beautiful!!
@dondekojo @atiku @seyiamakinde Lets keep our party together — PDP 👍🏾👍🏾
@GOP @SecPompeo Oh..poor Pompeo😭😭😭
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Distinguished congressman,we can’t help it,if Trump has chosen the path of failure..The guy actually made a mockery of himself on the international scene,trying to hobnob with a dictator!
@GirlOnFireSally Let’s forgive him!!Takes a lot to come out in the open,seeking for national forgiveness.That guy has lost a lot more than any one can imagine...
@AMADICHIMA Obviously...
@dino_melaye My party— the PDP!!!!
@JakeSherman That’s so true..None of them mentioned FOX,cos they know how incompetent that media house can be- untrustworthy source!!
@Alyssa_Milano The guy already accepted that he lied,and is trying to be a better person,yet all they did was to vilify him for being honest- which is a rare thing to do!
@babs_anthony @DeleMomodu Good for you bro- if Grace is what you define it to be;then bask in it👍🏾
@fkeyamo Get over this childishness,and go back to those days of excellent legal https://t.co/uQwctoPW7s are a SAN,please act like it,and leave this pettiness to some of us that do not have your level of supposed intellectual capacity- humbly begging🙏🏿
@realFFK Let’s don’t glorify the nonentity,trying to spew division amongst us,and focus on our collective will to get to the root of our course.	I believe in Atiku,any day;any time!!The man is a fine gentle man,and a leader in all ramifications!!
@JeffreyToobin Mostly the Republicans..
@GirlOnFireSally Lollll..I don’t want to have a migraine studying people that act wacko- extra terrestrial!!
@GirlOnFireSally My sister,if I were a son/ daughter to those Republicans,I would call my dad/mom to please wake up!These Republicans are truly stupid in trying to defend Trump. For once,when will they do set the interest of the nation above Trump’s- shameful!!
@Noble_Hassan @atiku Exactly!!!
@fkeyamo The country is in mourning- one thing your group/party should worry about. The APC lost the goodwill of Nigerians ,cos of the undue suffering and difficulties meted out on the people.	These elections have set the country an age behind- very sad!
@musteedbt @realFFK Why do you guys enjoy insulting people?If this is an election to you,then your standards are pretty low!
@mattgaetz You gloat in your ignorance a whole lot- got me asking: if you truly understand your position in the society-congressman?
@Phil_Lewis_ Not every one,entitled lady!
@DeleMomodu Nigerians and their https://t.co/KxBiXvGjsk has taken us no where,and never will!	 	Now,we are quoting and reading bible verses for pacification.Until we realize the fact that;God is no Nigerian,and tackle our problems head-on,we will always be at the level we find ourselves!
@taiwo3xl @DeleMomodu Stop cursing at people expressing their opinions- very amateurish!
@Noble_Hassan @atiku That’s why Nigerians have to contest the results of the elections,in a court of law-as our civic duty!!
@RepKatiePorter Well done congresswoman 💪🏾
@APCNigeria @ChibuikeAmaechi ....and what has he done for his region? He will get his comeuppance— just a matter of time.
@APCNigeria This dude has benefited from the system,so much that;his contribution to society is to orchestrate mayhem on Rivers state..Amechi will reap the harvest of his violent acts in no distant future...
@fkeyamo Hopefully,you continue in this gesture afterwards!!
@farooqkperogi @ChrisGanachi That’s my wish as well- Atiku and the PDP have to test all necessary legal means to make their case. After all,Buhari went to court to fight his course,when he lost to Obasanjo in 2003. 		So,it’s within Atiku’s duties to do same!
@DeleMomodu These are two different contexts- I live in the United states,and voted for Hilary Clinton as a naturalized citizen,but the elections in the states were no where rigged or fraudulent like the one in Nigeria.		What happened in Nigeria was a rape of democracy!!
@DeleMomodu The Nigerian elections were not free and fair. Like earlier stated ,let Atiku and his party decide on the next line of actions to take.		Please,try not to put yourself at the center of this process.
@APCNigeria How can a political party call people thieves.This is very despicable,and should be the start of a healing process of bringing the country together,at this very vital point of our national existence!
@realAliTweets .....that’s if they ever get to rise!
@VicqyBELLE @adeyanjudeji That’s the voter apathy we are talking about.Buhari and his cohorts have crippled a fledgling democracy.May take am age to fix this mess.
@NTANewsNow I pray the NTA improves on their coverage.The European observers mission said it best: “ The NTA was clearly partisan in its coverage,therefore depriving people the opportunity for electioneering campaigns”.
@inecnigeria The hopes of the PDP has finally been dashed—Rivers state- the root of the PDP just got raped!		APC is a party of power hungry people!!!!
@inecnigeria This exercise is a sham..Sorry Nigeria,while the world laughs,and sees us as a proud bunch of idiots😜😜
@benmurraybruce @dondekojo ...if it finally dies,then the myth about a section running the country cos of their numbers,will go with the wind!		My only fear with these elections is the ability to create voter apathy,henceforth.The APC has made a caricature of the progress made by GEJ-our hero!
@OfficialAPCNg You obviously are trying to cover up for the poor outing,even with the voter suppression and rigging.Just a paltry 130k votes difference- shows	lagosians are getting wind of your gimmicks and this wouldn’t be the norm,henceforth!!
@Spearszed @solomonapenja If only INEC was an unbiased umpire,then this would be the https://t.co/Pn4AJDoMYB such situations,you have to be proactive,to at least mitigate any result distortions to the nearest minimum. The Rivers state result shows how far this APC people went to rig the elections.
@PremiumTimesng This is the final straw that broke the Camel’s back..How can this be true,that the center of PDP- Rivers state has such number of votes,and Kano still maintains its crazy numbers. Chai,this APC people really used the power of incumbency— GEJ we miss you dearly 😭😭
@cchukudebelu I agree with you on this one👌🏾
@femiaribisala My brother Femi,Nigeria tire person. What powers within the law,does the chairman of INEC have to set aside results,if found suspicious?	 	Really would be nice to know the extent of his powers!
@MrAyeDee @atiku This guy, you crack me up.👍🏾I do like you all the same, cos u make this whole thing seem easy and jocular..I applaud your love for Buhari,but hope we shall all be on this forum,in no distant future to appraise the performance of the Buhari’s administration objectively
@DeleMomodu @benmurraybruce @atiku Thank you,and I applaud you for that.👍🏾👍🏾
@PremiumTimesng Why is PDP winning with small margins in their strongholds,while APC wins with very outrageous margins in their strongholds.This is quite an election.		Buhari is the chief rigger and most clueless president,Nigeria has ever produced- no kidding!The guy has no integrity!
@realFFK @atiku That’s how a real supporter should sound! I am with you on that@FFK💪🏾
@TheNationNews It should have been different if not for rigging and voters suppression.Tinubu is not after all,invisible as we thought!		PDP could win that state,if the guber elections are free and fair..
@SaintOraye @NyesomEWike Oh my poor little state,has been turned into a battle ground of sort.Must Amechi win by all means available in that state?
@Spayan11 @DeleMomodu Very correct- we have to face monstrous acts head-on,for our country to get better!	Today people go to Ghana to enjoy the benefits of good governance,laid down by President Lawrence.If he had waited on God,where would Ghana be today!
@DeleMomodu From the much I know about you,u didn’t let Abacha continue with his crime against Nigeria,by letting it up to God.If you doubt that Buhari would obey a court’s decision on the elections,Will your position be for Atiku let it upto God?		We have to change our national psyche..
@DeleMomodu I humbly feel your tweet was premature.U should have waited for at least 75% of the states to be  announced before tweeting.		The responses you got from the twitter sphere,put you at the center of the discourse- making it all about you!
@PremiumTimesng Umuahi should sssshhhh!!That’s the problem with these governors-that the president is your boss?How silly is that!You were not appointed by the president,cos you won an election too,and also belong to a party different from the president’s.		People should have party ideologies!
@elrufai That’s beneath your person,insulting people and labeling them as criminals. Buhari- your hero,could only win elections when he had these same criminals on his side after several attempts at the presidency. 		Let’s be more civil in our public discourse.
@solomonapenja That’s why people should have made their unit results public,Like Dino Melaye.They almost rigged his results this time around,but for his smart way of playing politics- publishing results at every turn of events!
@bbellgam @dondekojo Brother ask o!!!!The thing is magical 😭😭😭😭
@dondekojo Buhari is a tyrant.A president that can’t address the nation;for peace to reign..People commit these atrocities,cos the man at the helm of affairs isn’t a democrat!
@dondekojo That’s the problem- voter apathy!!People had hopes for the process this time around,due to the precedence laid down by GEJ.This will take us an age backwards- such a pity!
@walegates @JoelJumbo6 Nigerians and the quick mention of their god!!Even when they are involved in wrong doings,they call on this god..
@GuardianNigeria Very sad...
@YeleSowore This guy...make una form merger,to be more formidable,una no agree.	No even open mouth talk.The selfishness displayed by you and others like Fela Durotoye,was quite appalling—hind-sighted!
@nnabros @DeleMomodu @atiku You hit the nail on its head..
@Siegenersabitho @DeleMomodu Exactly...
@IhoTerence @DeleMomodu Very good question..
@DeleMomodu It’s not that easy.Let this plea wait till the last set of results are announced by INEC..
@DeleMomodu The Buhari-APC voodooism!!!
@Phunkey__ @JoelJumbo6 Why insult people?Totally unnecessary🙏🏿
@coolvic2 @JoelJumbo6 @GEJonathan I don’t think this is the case here..This is more of voters suppression- people voted,but their votes were either suppressed or altered by the ruling party,in connivance with the military and the police.
@ASUUNGR @JoelJumbo6 This organization is psycho..
@cnni That’s the idea;to distract CNN and other media houses,from the death of Kashogi!
@AfroVII @JoelJumbo6 Lazy journalism..
@Omojuwa I sure think he was beatable ,however,the conduct of the elections was Abysmal! The voters suppression in the opposition strongholds by the elements of state power- military and police- was totally ridiculous.
@RealCandaceO What does this really mean?
@sianoresist I really couldn’t comprehend what she was trying to express.The lady is wacko- seeking relevance!!!!
@soledadobrien Thought I was watching a comedy show-SNL!!
@SaintOraye @owonatty @inecnigeria This is sad...
@amb_abbas Why wait this long to release an election https://t.co/MkDAjVigHZ’s so shameful!
@NicholasGogo The Nigerian print media is very lazy.They should be more into investigative journalism,that just adopting results form INEC and other social media sites.		If they were vibrant,a lot of these atrocities would have been nipped in the bud..
@Rapha_ella_Flow .Its very troubling how people that suffer the same economic woes as the rest of the nation,can be monolithic in their political inclinations- never independent.	It’s the level of illiteracy,and the northern elites will keep holding their people hostage!!
@GuardianNigeria Please..I worked in Bayelsa state,about 10 years ago- nothing difficult about the terrain.INEC is so incompetent. 		A free and fair elections is the bedrock of any democracy. Rigging election results,is the worst disenfranchisement that can happen to any citizenry!
@dumakadozie @AMADICHIMA It’s usually the trend globally..
@AMADICHIMA The whole idea is to scale down the numbers from the PDP strong hold,and still maintaining the numbers from the core north.They will try to mess with the numbers from Rivers,Akwa Ibom,Delta,Cross Rivers and Bayelsa.
@AMADICHIMA There is a limit to which the foot soldiers for PDP can do.The military and the Police aided the ruling party,to scale down the numbers.GEJ is a Democrat,while these APC warloards are scavengers.I suspect they will do the same in my state-Rivers state 		I weep for my country...
@NicholasGogo @realFFK These APC politicians are a set of cannibals,ready to create turmoil for the sake of holding onto power.		The PDP should not accept this results,cos the INEC chairman doesn’t seem to get the gravity of the election violence and rigging perpetrated by the ruling party!
@NicholasGogo @realFFK A country with an unlimited abundance of human capital;being governed by a man that can’t articulate a sentence without showing how out of touch he is with modernity and progress.		Results from the southwest sends a message to the ruling party- we are no fools!
@realFFK Let’s keep the faith and hold forte..I believe we shall prevail sir—Atikulated🙏🏿
@MrAyeDee This may be a form of self realization and confession..methinks!
@dondekojo Buhari is a dictator. None of these south-westerners are calling Tinubu out,for the aggression towards the Ibos this morning by touts,Cos they voted for the opposition party.		These guys are so power drunk,that they can do anything to hold onto power—very shameful!
@ChimaChimney @AMADICHIMA Bros,it’s tough when the elements of the state are used against you! 	If he tries to do anything,they may shoot him and his supporters;tagging them as thugs or enemies of the state.		Very sad day for our country..
@BrianJDennis @dondekojo Lollllllll- social media candidates..
@ogundamisi @MBuhari That was the plan from the outset- steal votes from PDP strongholds.then rig the votes in the core north,		Very sad!!
@AOC @MylesMill You don’t need to respond to these despicable elements,congresswoman.They can’t just stand your rankings and high power👍🏾💪🏾👌🏾
@HuntsmanAbby I am with you on that- makes it more engaging and sleek👍🏾
@MobilePunch So what caused the fracas?
@adeyanjudeji If I were Buhari,this should have been a way for me to bow out in peace.	It’s quite unnerving for this country to continue with another 4 years of this lame-duck presidency.		Nigeria wake up!!!
@MobilePunch Punch is an element of the state.I have keenly watched your coverage of the elections- it’s obviously despicable- very one sided. 		I thought I was wrong,but it’s a trend that this once revered newspaper,is now an arm of the ruling party!
@piersmorgan It sure does look ridiculous..
@SirajAHashmi What a way of relaxation🙈
@mitchellreports I will let my kids ask questions,irrespective of whose ox is gored.We don’t operate a monarchical system of givernance in this country,so there is nothing wrong with asking questions- even when they seem silly from the point of the old brigade..
@bolu_oj @PDP_2019 You have to be nationally viable to vie for the presidency..
@bolu_oj @PDP_2019 Same thing I said!!Sowore showed so much excitement defeating Buhari and Atiku in his PU,as if that was his dream- he should have simply contested to be a councilor,instead of undertaken on a goose chase of becoming president!
@AMADICHIMA Your expose’ is always refreshing-rapt and enlightening!!
@MrOdanz That’s so true..No body should have the entitled disposition of being an 8 year tenured Presidency!

@APCNigeria @thecableng I wish APC can stop showcasing such strange results,where the opposition parties have no votes.Its rather suspicious and lame!Even,the polling unit of President Buhari,had some voters from the opposition parties.
@JoyceWhiteVance Thank you..
@siano2020 Classified fool..
@gloria_adagbon @channelstv I am a Nigerian in diaspora- watching channels TV for the past 24 hours.	To be honest,the guys have been fairly reasonable on their covering of the https://t.co/eVrSjXFFFM, your assertions are quite misinforming!
@LugardHouse @APCNigeria This result is disturbing. How can the voters in that center be this monotonous- voting only for APC;as this could spell danger for the govt. Objective dissenting view is the bedrock of democracy. 		 This is totally absurd!!
@MrAyeDee @OfficialPDPNig @atiku Lollllllll
@DeleMomodu Tinubu and his cohorts should be called out..This burden lies on democrats that are in the Lagos area,to be brave enough to call him out,when things are this sordid- he is no god!
@YeleSowore @Omojuwa @APCNigeria @MBuhari @atiku This guy should have been a councilor,if winning a polling unit,deserves such an excitement.		Atimes,starting from the simplest position,may just make that huge difference and more meaning to the constituents👍🏾
@DeleMomodu If it’s this bad just for the presidential elections,can imagine what will happen at the gubernatorial elections;that’s more dear to people - guess there will be bloodbath to a level unimaginable.		The ruling party,would not want to relinquish power peacefully.
@muyiwaferreira @dondekojo Johnattan is a hero...

@brianefallon We need to take over power from these old brigade politicians..
@RebeccaBuck This is how politicians think: feeling insulated while in power.We need more young people to take over power from this old brigade politicians!

@DeleMomodu Yet,the ruling party has not shown the same humanity towards this tragedy at their campaign rally today.Instead,all we see is the crowd size at the rally- such a disdain for human lives..
@fkeyamo The same Port Harcourt that 14 people died,cos of this rally.Yet,the APC has not shown any form of human feelings toward the tragedy,rather they bask in displaying crowd sizes—such disdain for human lives!
@KarenAttiah ....and still are👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾
@KarenAttiah ....and still are🙏🏿🙏🏿
@JesseLehrich @CNN CNN aka Entertainment news channel.These guys are entertainers!!
@MarkHertling This is totally ridiculous.What’s truly going on with this White House?This guy is a hawk- and would most likely set the United States up for a show down with Iran- war!!
@siano2020 Lollllll
@fkeyamo Too petty...
@fkeyamo This guy is supposed to be a Senior Advocate of Nigeria?I have a very close friend of mine whose father was a Senior Advicate of Nigeria;and in all honesty,I doubt if he would have acted this way- if he were around! Sir,you have a life to lead after this election,act wisely!
@PoliceNG Why do these VIPs need so much police protection,when the police to citizens ratio is very abysmal?	Ordinary citizens are very much important as well.
@DoyinSoExtra @JoelJumbo6 Why kill them??
@TinaMarie88888 @nytimes @MaggieAstor Thank you..
@ProudResister @nytimes The NYtimes subscription skyrocketed due to the Trump’s presidency. Trump is a cash cow,so they would rather have him become president all over again,cos of their ROI!!
@JRubinBlogger If that’s what it takes to beat Trump,then Beto is the real https://t.co/RtsHfx5fyk I said: Going soft on Trump,will give him the second https://t.co/K4sP8wQ8fH,Democrats need a vibrant candidate to defeat Trump at the next elections,and not a “ softie”..
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump Watching Trump at the rally tonight reminds me of the last election campaign.The guy is at it again- Democrat’s have to field a formidable candidate that can match him.I am getting jittery,that this guy may be difficult to defeat,with him on the ballot- he is full swing!
@IlhanMN Special interests and politicians want to stifle the congresswoman,cos of her statement on twitter.Henceforth,my suggestion to the congresswoman is for her to choose her battles wisely.Don’t comment on all fronts,cos you will need that energy when the real fight comes!
@RebeccaBuck That’s more like it..Next should be Elizabeth Warren!
@GOPLeader Typical of a rabble rouser..
@politiquacks @samstein @daveweigel That’s the point.America shouldn’t be seen as Israel’s puppet,at that point do we loose our integrity as a nation. We shouldn’t equate an objective criticism of a govt and her policies,to anti-semitism.
@LeperaRobert @samstein Very well so!!!!
@BigLdaGod @samstein @GOPLeader That’s my point!!We can’t talk any more Cos it’s Israel-we are living in bondage,if we can’t express our opinion about matters objectively.	Where were these guys when Natayanhu and his govt. disrespected Obama and Biden during their presidency.Please,let truth be told!!
@Dwobers @ggreenwald @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @keithellison Used to follow Farakhan on Instagram,but hd to unfollow him due to his hateful speeches towards Jews,which is inimical to what I stand https://t.co/ZKNhM5Wdmi anycase,I still do not have a clear idea of what AIPAC stands for?	I also don’t think the congresswoman  is anti Semitic!
@bungarsargon @IlhanMN Again,that’s not being Anti-Semitic.Not all jews support AIIPAC,so stating an opinion against their interest, is an actual freedom of expression and not anti-Semitism..
@GReschenthaler @HouseGOP @RepLeeZeldin When the Israeli government under Natayanhu disrespected President Obama and Biden,we never heard calls for Natayanhu to apologize.	America is not an arm of the Israeli government- let truth be told!!
@GReschenthaler @HouseGOP @RepLeeZeldin I am truly confused about the difference,between anti-Semitism and calling a govt( Israel) and special interests groups out,when they are wrong! 	We shouldn’t loose our ability to freely express our opinion,without being termed anti- Semitic - that’s a dangerous trend!
@ggreenwald @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @keithellison Isreal,I suppose, is not an extended American colony..The way we stand up to Govts. that go wrong around the globe,the same way we should stand up to Israel as a country,when they go wrong..	Powerful interest gps should stop bullying the congresswoman!!
@ggreenwald @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @keithellison There is no need to apologize congresswoman..The day we try to stifle opinions,due to influences peddled by groups;the day we loose our standing- as a country of freedom.	Taking a different opinion about Israel as a country,is different from being anti Semitic!!
@ananavarro @RepShalala The congresswoman should not be stifled by powerful groups,and the MSM, to tender an apology,Cos there is none to give!!	The Israeli govt under Netanyahu disrespected Obama and Biden,yet no body called him/them out! 	Let justice and truth prevail!!!
@ananavarro @RepShalala I am truly having a problem understanding the difference between calling Israel out when they go wrong as a country,and anti-semitism.	If an opinion about a country is seen as being anti Semitic,then we have lost that pivotal point of our existence- freedom of expression!

@GOPLeader This same Republican Party that gave huge tax breaks to billionaires,totally shortchanging the common man,and blowing up the debt ceiling- Govt. sponsored corporate welfare.
@soledadobrien .... with a soft ball moderator. CNN— the new entertainment station- ET.

@NateSilver538 So true- CNN is very sensational,and all they care about is just the ratings,rather than the substance of the programs they propagate.What happened to candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Julian Castro???
@EdKrassen I don’t either..That’s how democracy should be — checks and balances👍🏾
@RepAdamSchiff Nice job Adam💪🏾💪🏾
@JoeNBC Trump is a cash cow.The MSM would do anything possible to give Trump a second tenure,cos his presidency brings more cash to the media houses.
@cchukudebelu @CNN I am with you on that. They have lost that substance in objective news delivery- seems like an entertainment outlet to me;casting news with so much sensation!
@siano2020 Absolutely!!!
@DeleMomodu A man that said he came into power in 2005,at a campaign rally in Ekiti state.Nigerians,wahala Dey ooo..What other signs do we need to declare this guy,totally unfit for this office of the presidency of our great nation; Nigeria.We may be the problem,after all!

One huge difference b/w American politicians and their European counterparts is; the inability to resign in the midst of bad behaviors.American politicians are not any different from politicians in Africa- sticking to their guns,even when they are wrong.Very sad!

@DeleMomodu As an ardent follower of Mr. Momodu,Atiku was my choice,’till yesterday.After that walk of shame; of being present yet absent at the debate,I finally pitched tent w/ Moghalu.That guy is Nigeria’s hope for the future,sentiments aside.He is grounded in facts and policies.
@MoghaluKingsley This is Nigeria’s chance for a breakthrough and better future.After watching yesterday’s debate,Sir,you have the wherewithal to lift Nigeria from her economic shackles and pervasive corruption state.#voteMoghalu
@ShehuSani @benmurraybruce Senator Sani is the best👍🏾👍🏾
@lolaloveandart He still needed to make himself available for the country to hear from him directly. In normal climes,that alone would cost him the chance to win - cos he just acted like the president- arrogant and poor judgement!
@AMADICHIMA Exactly!He has a set of advisers from the old bloc,that makes it difficult for people to think Atiku has anything new to offer Nigerians.He used to be my candidate until yesterday,when he ridiculed himself-by being present, yet absent.
@AMADICHIMA Kingsley Moghalu was the best to me.Fela is obviously a motivational speaker,but not so grounded in policy!!
@MoghaluKingsley Watched the debate,and was very impressed with the performances of all the candidates.Wish Nigeria can give any one them a chance!For me,Kingsley Moghalu should be the President of the Republic..
@atiku Mr. President,if I had the opportunity to advice you — you should have continued with the debate.Better to live above board,and not be part of the moribund conventional ways of doing things in Nigeria!!
@AMADICHIMA @atiku What a wasted opportunity. I wonder who advised him not to continue with the debate — that’s not good PR!
@AriFleischer Why are republicans so scared of these new fire brand set of Democratic congresswomen?It’s getting too awkward!!

@SymoneDSanders My take is: why not wait for the trade deal to go into effect,then the proceeds can be used to pay for the wall?Why the rush to build the wall with tax payers funds now?All liessssss!!!
@amandacarpenter I presume it would be nice to have a more direct knowledge of our president by some one close to him,rather than mere speculations?So,the American public will like to hear from Mr. Cohen🙏🏿
@realDonaldTrump Such a lame argument.A humanitarian crisis requires a humanitarian response,and not the building of a wall!!You are going around in circles,and make it difficult for Democrats to negotiate with you—very sad!

@GirlOnFireSally You are lucky..I actually stayed awake to hear the same old s..t.America is in static mode!The funniest scene was the rebuttal by Pelosi and Schumer- very awkward television😂

Nothing new from Trump...	Another waste of time 🙈
@MrFilmkritik Thank you..I have been shouting this to the top of my voice: the media gave us Trump,and they are at it again!
@owillis @MrJonCryer Boy..I though I was the only one seeing this!These guys love Trump,and would rather have him as president cos of ratings and ROI.	The Media gave us TRUMP,and they are at it again!
@neeratanden The media knows that TRUMP is a cash cow for them,so no matter the level of abuse,they still love him,and pretend otherwise in public.The media gave us Trump,so would do anything to keep Trump as president for their ratings and coffers!!
@doyin_boss @DeleMomodu Yes!!As a Rivers man I feel the pain of the mismanagement of the states’s resources.Port Harcourt used to be next to Lagos in all spheres,but today,our governors have crushed it to a gory site.Uyo leads PHC in terms of development..
@DeleMomodu They spend so much money,just to prop-up their national status,like no other state.Since the days of Odili,the state has been in peril;both economically,security wise and poor infrastructural development.	Rivers state is a shadow of itself,with these minions as governors!!
@DeleMomodu Rivers state is the goose that lays the golden egg.The problem is that;our governors always seek national relevance to the detriment of the state.Our resources are squandered,just for national fame.From the days of Okilo,to Ada-George,Odili,Amechi to Wike.
@brianefallon They are the enablers: Gave us Trump!
@NBCNews NO!!
@DavidABergstein In think the two of them are their own problems—very awkward!!
@AOC The media is at it again: They want to break this rising star,and that’s not going to move a needle!Like I said;the media-both print and TV, gave us TRUMP. They would rather prefer Him to win a second term,for the ratings.
@sirDukeDevin Not a chance,if it’s an all white men ticket!They will suffer the same defeat as Hilary Clinton- all white ticket!!Also,a woman need to be on the ticket,Cos they are the bedrock of the Democratic Party.

@CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC I wish it’s Jake Tapper interviewing and not Dana Bash- softball!She doesn’t know how to ask questions;just my take.
@DeleMomodu My attention to the deplorable state of MMIA was brought,due to a video you posted on the leakages at the https://t.co/gKWvvHmWfi can only do as much in Nigeria!Everything has a political motivation,that is grounded on ill-will.That’s where real leadership comes into  play.
@DeleMomodu I was young when Abiola won the elections in Nigeria- a lost era,when Nigerians voted irrespective of religious beliefs and ethnic sentiments.If only that period was allowed to fruition,we would have been far greater than how we are today- possibly the Giant that we claim to be!
@DeleMomodu We may be that giant that have ideas but not ideals!Our leaders lack the will to move us to the challenges of the future.
@DeleMomodu @braining01,you see how Dele respectfully stated his point.That’s why I follow him on this platform.He disagrees with people on the basis of facts,and not spew unnecessary sentiments on issues!We need you sir,in the mainstream of leadership in our country 💪🏾
@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu Good luck brother.
@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu Again,it’s not my biz what Kwame writes about Nigeria.I only state facts based on my own knowledge of facts!!If we did the right things in our country; our deeds would speak for us!
@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu You really do have a tiny mind.I see how swift you are at hauling insults in a supposed civil conversation!If every one that follows you,shares the same opinion as you;then you are going on be engraved in your myopic view of life-good lUck👍🏾
@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu Haha..my brother,I no Dey face any other place,but front o!Our mouth for Nigeria too much.I use Ethiopian Airlines to travel,yet begging to use Nigeria’s!We too make noise,yet nothing— truth🙈😜

@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu Bros,no be fight!Giant of Africa that can’t provide common security for her citizens.If you look beyond this your utopia-Lagos,you’d know how Nigeria really is.Killings everywhere,without an actual war.Even the so called Lagos,is reveled in poverty.
@braining01 @KwameSet @DeleMomodu A Giant of Africa,without a functional Air liner!Our people keep sending their wards to Ghana and other countries for better education;our elites give birth to their kids overseas(America),cos they have lost faith in their country.Nigeria,my country: is a shadow of its self!
@billmaher That’s right!!

@MidwestArea @kenvogel @DearAuntCrabby @MSNBC @FoxNews They recycle segments: showing and talking about one topic,from segment to segment- that bores viewers. MSNBC diversifies the conversation and have journalists that ask real questions and not entertainers;like CNN!!
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo That’s it? Even Pompeo seems like a misfit for his own job!
@DeleMomodu That’s not good enough:Nigeria’s future is at stake,and not to be toyed with.We should vehemently stand against mediocrity in our leadership!!
@fkeyamo @AdeBanqie Thus,it goes to show how the foundation of the Buhari’s presidency,like any other one in modern Nigerian history, is shrouded in corruption and fraud!So,No: he is not as innocent as they portray him to be!
@fkeyamo @AdeBanqie Prior to that election,he had attempted in previous elections,where he purportedly played clean,yet the results were nothing but elections losses.When the corrupt governors and other corrupt individuals jumped ship in 2015 from the PDP to the APC,that was when he won..
@fkeyamo @AdeBanqie President Buhari became elected,the moment he decided to sleep in the same bed with Nigerian corrupt cannibals- 2015 elections..This premise of painting him as a saint flies in the face of reason!
@DeleMomodu Thank you Dele.I have met a lot of Ghanaians,that tell me that: getting admission into the public university system is more competitive than the private schools- it goes to show the level of the standards.I also work with them,and can see how lettered they are!

@BendelJounal @renoomokri @AtlanticCouncil Nigerians shouldn’t just queue behind some one cos of what he claims to be or thinks he is.Let’s learn how to differ objectively,without demeaning the other person.Reno and other Nigerians that claim to be knowledgeable are not oracles.

@toomuchjuice200 @renoomokri @AtlanticCouncil That’s the problem with Nigerians: Reno is an oracle and shouldn’t be reponded to.On this matter; Trump picking a former Attorner General for HW Bush, as AG now,doesn’t make him a genius.

@grinch_dr That’s not being negative.Just one reason why Nigeria is where it is: Respect for others and ignoring local achievements!First African chief resident at the university of Pennsylvania hospital isn’t a thing to parade in any sense..That’s neo-mentality!!

@SecPompeo It’s obvious that this administration gloats in its ignorance!Wish you could have the slightest understanding of how this administration looks - errand boys to a 33 year old boy,that is not as intelligent as they portend him to be!!
@SecPompeo Why Pompey??So,Saudi Arabia can kill all her citizens and still be seen as a stabilizing force in the region?Can’t wait for this administration to come by,so this great country takes back her mantle of leadership on the world stage..
@ShehuSani This would encourage smuggling and hike in the market prices of these commodities-which a lot of Nigerians depend on as business for their well being.Our government has not provided the template and biz environment for local content,so this move is anti-trade!

@brianstelter @ER_DavidLittle CNN should expend more energy covering the aftermath of the California fires,and stop appropriating undue attention to Jim .Like one BBC correspondent captioned it on their news network;The man that’s supposed to follow the News,is the NEWS himself.Acosta is no hero!!
@JackiSchechner @Acosta Yea,but Acosta shouldn’t be the NEWS!!!As much I don’t agree with this administration on so many fronts,Acosta shouldn’t be disruptive in the way he presents himself during the WH briefings!!
After this midterm election,my opinion is for America to humbly go to Europe and learn how to conduct elections,especially the southern states.The elections in Florida and Georgia,are a total disgrace to what this country claims to stand for..
@jaketapper And I hope CNN would make it a priority to talk about this story,rather than spend time talking about the Clinton’s Affair.The Clintons have been vilified by every sphere of American society,to the point of making them look evil,w / CNN playing a huge role in propagating that!

@GreerMcVay @waltb31 @JCTheResistance @DavidJollyFL @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS44 Thank you.The media has a way of bullying Democrats into towing a weak path. The media is now asking democrats to be careful how they investigate Trump, Cos of overreach,forgetting the fact that, this blue wave happened so that Trump can be checked.
@JoyAnnReid @BBCNews America..a lot of things are just wrong with policing in this country.What happened to asking the guy to “ Drop his weapons” before shooting!!

@CurtisIP1 @amandacarpenter @CNN I don’t have a problem.!!If you ever watch the BBC and see how they interview people,you would know,the interview this morning was a joke...Journalists in this country have to sit up!
@CNN Rudy just gave the right response to the interview ; “ This conversation is getting petty” Alyson is so amateur in her way of asking questions.Most of the questions are so petty,really!Where is David Gregen???😭😭😭
@amandacarpenter I waited for this interview,just to see Alyson make it look like a joke!Where is David Gregory 😭😭😭Alyson isn’t well rounded to interview Rudy..So sad @CNN 😭😭
@CNN I waited for the interview with Rudy Giuliani this a.m on News day,just to see Alyson ask very watery questions.Why didn’t David Gregory handle this interview!!Alyson is making this look like an entertainment...So sad!!
@NewDayCNN I would rather prefer David Gregen interview Rudy Giuliani,than Alyson..I think she is not well rounded enough to interview Rudy.U need an expert like David!Was waiting for the segment till I saw Alyson turn it to a joke😭🙈

@Acosta We need more of Mr. Acosta💪🏾
@ananavarro Trump obviously has plans for his family,rather than being president of the U.S.He knows the future of the world lies in the East,so anything to pave way for his family biz makes a lot of sense to him.The so called Western allies are no longer fertile for biz!America wake up!
His vision is to invest his biz interest in that part of the world,rather than the already saturated Western world.He actually has a good biz sense and has nothing to lose,but a lot to gain cozying up to the East.
Americans are naive!Trump is thinking more about the future of the Trump family,than being president of the U.S. He knows that the future is in the East,that’s why you see him cozying up to leaders/people Asia,instead the so called Western Allies#futureinvestment🙈

@johnzimmer @lyft After giving my own side of the story,it seems as though it has fallen on deaf ears.False allegations can be devastating,and I wish Lyft doesn’t descend to treating drivers poorly like uber.Some people go about wrecking other peoples’ lives and careers!!!!
