When I was young, #ShirleyChisholm‚Äôs trailblazing run for President inspired me. And when I was sworn in, she was there in spirit ‚Äì folding chair in hand. https://t.co/p6RaiGVliy
The #HBCU Partners Act can make lasting changes to historically black colleges ‚Äì tapping into talented students at prestigious HBCUs across the country.	https://t.co/t87NSjr9ZA
She is a trailblazer who broke down barriers and played a dynamic role in Delaware government for over three decades. I am fortunate to call her friend and mentor, and I thank Senator Henry for helping make our state a better and just place for all Delawareans. #BHM
Sen. Henry‚Äôs influence extended beyond her role in the General Assembly. In her non-profit career, she served as Executive Director of  Now, Girls Inc., which empowers young women and girls across the state.
She championed bills that provided cost limits on prescription medication and fought out-of-school suspensions for minor infractions, which disproportionately impact students of color. https://t.co/tBEWiwWBAf #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
In one of her many focus areas, Sen. Henry was dedicated to protecting voter‚Äôs rights. She sponsored and helped pass legislation that fought voting discrimination, allowed same-day voter registration, and restored voting rights for convicted felons. https://t.co/tnXjZ4Lbfn #BHM
Her tenure as a public servant began in 1994 when she became the first African American woman to serve in the Delaware State Senate and later as Senate Majority Leader. Throughout her career in the GA, she was a trailblazer and civil rights leader. https://t.co/VdJAhjLYUJ #BHM
For over 30 years, Delaware‚Äôs former State Senator and living legend Margaret Rose Henry, has helped define service and community advocacy in Delaware. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM https://t.co/mZbGFmhDcU

Though his life was short, Wilmington continues to honor his lasting influence annually with the @cbjazzfest. https://t.co/IYTlIvpaik #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Brown had a natural aptitude for music, forming the Brown-Roach quintet and recording a series of scores throughout his life. In 1954, he composed "Joy Spring," one of his greatest and most recognized hits. https://t.co/eMsRXZxf3d
Clifford Brown was a founding father of bebop. His distinguished career in jazz was defined by his pioneering sound and graceful technique. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM https://t.co/ljUn42wYrV

Loper pushed for diversifying the field - painting a way for others to follow. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
His work is now immortalized by permanent collections in Paul R. Jones Collection of African-American Art, @philamuseum, and @ngadc, @americanart museum. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
For 70 years, he taught the next generation of artists at the Delaware College of Art and Design and other institutions - cultivating an appreciation of art within the community.
Loper‚Äôs signature technique is defined by color and vibrancy. He frequently painted landscapes of his beloved neighborhood in Wilmington. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
He was the first African American to be featured in the Delaware Art Museum in 1937 with several notable exhibitions and shows, including a retrospective of his work in 1996. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
As a self-trained artist, Loper started drawing in the Work Progress Association during WWII, rendering 113 illustrations. https://t.co/c9Rh1E239a

Shadd Cary was a trailblazer in advancing the causes of African Americans and women in Delaware and across our country. I am pleased that Shadd Cary is now receiving the attention and acclaim that her influential life deserves. https://t.co/rgWZxvZDxq #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Later, Shadd Cary would join the National Woman Suffrage Association and work alongside prominent figures in the movement to fight for the right to vote for women everywhere. She was one of the first 1st African American women to cast their ballot in a national election. #BHM
After having moved to Canada to avoid being captured into slavery, Shadd Cary moved back to the US where she would go on to teach at black schools in Wilmington and receive a law degree from Howard University School of Law - the second black woman in the US to earn a law degree.
At the time, even mainstream abolitionist newspapers only featured white authors. Shadd Cary's paper was one of the first to include stories, poetry, and letters from the best and brightest in the black community. #BHM
In 1853, Shadd Cary became the first black woman to publish and edit a North American newspaper, the Provincial Freedom. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM https://t.co/umYhoycrhT
Hailing from Wilmington, DE, Mary Ann Shadd Cary is remembered as an extraordinary abolitionist, suffragette, and journalist. Born to a free family, Shadd Cary devoted her life to defending the voiceless and fighting for equality at the ballot box and in our society. #BHM https://t.co/88NXp8S6OG
Redding also played an instrumental role in opening up the @UDelaware to black students. By using his legal mind, Redding stood up to injustice, created new opportunities to learn, &amp; advanced the rights of African Americans across the nation. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
As the 1st African American to be admitted to the Delaware bar, Louis Redding‚Äôs career was spent fighting for equality &amp; inclusion. He was a member of the @NAACP legal team that challenged school segregation in the landmark #SCOTUS case Brown V. Board of Education. #BHM https://t.co/A0UEKRtFSS

Millions of women across the country saw themselves, their family members, and their friends in Dr. Ford's heroic and moving testimony yesterday. Her strength, her pain spoke to the trauma millions of women suffer in silence with. #BelieveSurvivors https://t.co/BSDPABqhmW
Moments like this reflect the historic times we live in. Every Senator needs to ask themselves if partisanship and the advancement of a political agenda is more important than protecting women, their body autonomy, and their well-being.
By voting yes, Senate Republicans are sending a message to women everywhere that their experiences and their truths are less than. It‚Äôs the wrong message to send to anyone who comes forward and speaks truth to power.
I know that as women watched Dr. Ford‚Äôs powerful testimony that they didn‚Äôt just see Dr. Ford, they saw themselves, a friend, a family member. I #BelieveSurvivors and Senate Republicans must as well.
Like millions of women across this nation, Dr. Ford‚Äôs pain cut right to the core for so many who live in silence afraid to speak about the trauma they experienced. Her courage was inspiring and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here today. https://t.co/bETzy6wtDP

The Trump Administration has declined to defend the Affordable Care Act in court, and the case will likely end up in the Supreme Court. Make no mistake, health care for millions of Americans could depend on Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh
The Affordable Care Act guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, which more than half of all women &amp; girls have. They could lose health care coverage if those protections are invalidated by a Supreme Court ruling. #WhatsAtStake #StopKavanaugh

It‚Äôs estimated that we‚Äôll need an additional 3 million slots for workforce training programs under this proposal. With $1B in funding, that comes out to less than $30/person/month. That‚Äôs a drop in the bucket to provide workplace training to anyone. #2018FarmBill

In Delaware, we're performing better than the national average, but we must press for #EqualPayNow to ensure that April 10, 2018 will be the last #EqualPayDay. #NetDE
Based on the current rate, women's wages won't be equal to men until the year 2119. One more day of pay inequality is far too long to wait. This is about ensuring fairness, equality, valuing the contributions of working women everywhere. #EqualPayDay
The #WageGap only widens for women of color. African American women earn only 63¬¢ and Latinas earn only 54¬¢ for every $1 made by their white male colleagues. Now is the time to demand #EqualPay and end gender and racial discrimination. #EqualPayDay

Students in Delaware and across the country, without exception, deserve protections under law. #SNDA spells out that students must be protected from discrimination based on gender identity &amp; sexual orientation - as well as race, religion, ability, &amp; national origin. #LetKidsLearn
The only thing students should be worried about is academic achievement, not getting bullied or discriminated against. #SNDA #LetKidsLearn
Discrimination, bullying, and harassment do not belong anywhere - let alone schools. The Student Non-Discrimination Act says in law that discrimination of any kind won‚Äôt be tolerated. #SNDA #LetKidsLearn
The Student Non-Discrimination Act will put an end to discrimination in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity. All children should have access to an education free from discrimination. #SNDA #LetKidsLearn

We need to do right by our students and our neighborhoods by preventing the next shooting that takes anyone‚Äôs life. #HonorWithAction
It shouldn't take another mass shooting for us to deal with this crisis. Students are dying every day in and out of school buildings because of gun violence that plagues too many communities.
From our classrooms to our neighborhoods, we need to create safe spaces for our students and communities to grow and thrive.
We need to protect Americans by passing the #GVRO Act, banning bump stocks, expanding background checks, and preventing domestic abusers from obtaining deadly firearms.
According to @Everytown, Americans are 25 times more likely to be shot and killed with a gun than people in other developed countries. We must act now by passing the #GVRO Act. #HonorWithAction
I‚Äôm proud to co-sponsor the #GVRO Act, which is designed to prevent people who pose a threat to themselves or others from having access to guns. It‚Äôs already saving lives in the states which have adopted it. Read more about it here: https://t.co/qYQidnjq8O
