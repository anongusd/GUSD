Yes, governments need to do more to scale-up support in terms of facilities for young people affected by violence in schools. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/xj9JR7rtpA
I totally agree with you 😀.  Adults should also join the conversation. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/RrJKx1yRsu
Thank you for these kind words. They really motivate me to do more and advocate for change. I read e-books on Wattpad where a lot of young people upload their books. I also love Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/KLxBa9roDu

Every child has the right to be heard and helped. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I am determined to make sure that some day, every school in my community has qualified psychologists. I think this will make it easier for students to report violence or simply talk about their problems. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Parents should take pride in being actively involved in school meetings and their children's lives. They should also understand that depression and suicide are real issues, instead of dismissing them. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
In the future, I hope that all students feel safe in school so they have better learning experiences. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Violence does not only take place between students but between teachers and students. A teacher in my country was killed earlier this year by a pupil. The schooling system needs to change. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I would like to tell world leaders that violence in schools is real and without action, it causes fatalities. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I also think young people could create a platform to support students affected by violence at school, like a website where they can report and seek help. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
To draw attention to the devastating impact of violence in schools students could hold silent protests in honour of victims of violence in schools. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
It’s important to educate people - old and young - about violence in schools and that often students learn good and bad behaviour at home. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Young people around the world can also take action against violence in schools by hosting seminars, especially in rural communities. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I have lived through violence, experienced it, &amp; conquered it. That’s why it’s important that young people from around the world are gathering right now to create the #ENDviolence in Schools Youth Manifesto, as no one understands the youth like the youth. #YouthTakeover
Students need to speak up, as I did, against the violence they are experiencing. Being quiet does not change things. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/vTVVtRf9LL
Students also have their part to play. They can get involved in initiatives and clubs that allow them to have a platform to speak their minds and protect each other from any form of violence. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I was unhappy with how my case was handled. When a student reports an incident, the school management should follow up and investigate - in my case they didn't. They should also have counsellors available at school. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
School is a home away from home. So I think to support students the government should make it mandatory for all teachers to have psychological training. This will help to make sure that when students experience issues, they will be well-supported. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
The club also empowers students to be drivers of their own community-based conversations and work. We go to workshops, senior living facilities, pick up litter and much more! This initiative is near and dear to my ❤️. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I joined a UNICEF-supported student-led club called The Girls and Boys Education Movement (GEM-BEM) which is in schools across the country. The club helps promote mutual respect and dignity between students. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/QfzfAg2pgN
I started to advocate and support fellow students who were going through similar situations at home or at school. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Counselling really helped me recover from the trauma of the incident and I want other children and young people, who have been through a similar experience, to have the same opportunity to recover that I had. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
My experience with violence at school also taught me to speak up for myself and not let anyone dismiss me, whether male or female. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/kJCEYp52P0
This difficult, personal experience impacted me in so many ways. My parents were also greatly affected and they immediately went to my school and reported the incident. This is an action that most parents/guardians should adopt. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I first realized the impact of violence in schools when I was assaulted at school. The ordeal made me feel dehumanized and like a pawn in a chess game. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
In my spare time I love cooking, watching cooking shows, and eating plenty of food. Oh, I also like reading e-books. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/dpSdeL4u2s

Hello! It’s Khuthadzo here! Excited to share my story and my message to leaders and young people on ending violence in schools. #ENDviolence #YouthTakeover https://t.co/bHyfs7yilR
Thanks for checking out my story and for your questions. Now over to Khuthadzo... #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
There needs to be more education focussed on the impact of gender-based violence on victims, preferably at a young age. So that everyone can fully understand that it is an abhorrent act. #ENDviolence #YouthTakeover https://t.co/9tsxojP8bN
💯 I completely agree with you! #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/F5RHuPzkUX
I think that there are many initiatives that are excellent at tackling violence. One that stands out is the "Peace for Champs" initiative, where secondary schools come together to promote peace &amp; mutual respect at an annual school sports event which was known to be violent. https://t.co/p3D5D7qjfb
For me when you're in a position to contribute to a change and you don't, there is no guarantee that someone else will. So that's why I am determined to advocate on ending violence in schools. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/usZiMiKdAe
Do you have any questions for me about my experiences? #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/KjclI7SCfp
At school, children should have a chance to focus on their education and not on possible breaches to their safety. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/SsuzkfPKU1
I would also like to see a future where schools in volatile areas have safer surroundings. I just hope, more than anything, that in the future, violence in schools becomes a rare occurrence instead of being embedded in the whole system. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I would like to tell the world that violence in schools is not self-contained. It often starts at home and extends into communities. When implementing measures to #ENDviolence in schools, this needs to be taken into consideration. #YouthTakeover
3. Stand up for victims and start school/community rehabilitation projects for violent students. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
2. Students can start non-violence campaigns in their schools or lobby for better cyber policies that can regulate cyberbullying. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
1. Taking action can be as simple as monitoring your own behaviour and ensuring you’re not part of the problem. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Young people can take action against violence in schools in three ways. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Ending violence in schools is a personal interest of mine as it affects youth. That’s why for me it is of paramount importance that I participate in helping to initiate change, which I believe the Youth Manifesto will do. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/sQrRehaIr9
I think it is important that young people, like me, are working together right now to create the #ENDviolence in Schools Youth Manifesto, as anything that involves youth or impacts youth, should have youth representation or contribution. #YouthTakeover
It is also important for students to support each when they see others being targeted. This can take the form of emotional support and/or speaking out against the perpetrators. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Students can support each other through accountability. That is, the quality of being able to identify when your actions or those of your peers can be considered violent and bringing them to an immediate halt. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Teachers need to be accessible, observant, and approachable to facilitate conflict resolution processes and for students to feel comfortable reporting violence. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Parents need to make sure households are violence-free. They also need to identify not only when their child is being affected by violence, but also when they’re displaying violent tendencies. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Politicians need to lead the discussion on violence by either starting initiatives or developing policies to stop violence in schools and/or by supporting student-led activities that are trying to achieve that same goal. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/5bKWActWg0
Politicians, parents, and teachers can all take action against violence in schools and support young people. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
Fun fact: At the conference, I wrote and delivered the final address on the Children’s Declaration and it is still being used today. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
I participated in a conference on violence against children that was held in Jamaica. From that experience, I fell in love with advocating for the rights of children with a special focus on violence. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/n0gGwgRprr
I was inspired to advocate for children’s rights and ending violence in schools in 2012 when I was 15. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
The incident also gave me an insight into how all those other students had been feeling the whole time. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
It was the first time one of my peers made me feel truly powerless. To this day, I still haven’t got my tamagotchi pet back. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence
One day the bully took my tamagotchi pet while I was playing with it. I couldn’t tell my teacher because toys weren’t allowed at school. That’s not the point of the story though. I just remember feeling helpless and sad. #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/Ml6EhL92eb
I first noticed the impact of violence in schools when I was in second grade. There was a class bully who would physically hurt some of my classmates. The class bully didn’t target me, so I never stopped to truly consider the implications until... #YouthTakeover #ENDviolence https://t.co/Wi0XRraWtG
