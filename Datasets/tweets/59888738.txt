When you read the report, please think about the people who went to the press because they had information and were denied an interview with the FBI.  Did Mark Judge know Dr. Ford?  Did he remember a gathering on July1?  Did that house fit the description given by Dr. Ford.
Too many people who said they had information they wanted to give to the FBI were interviewed.  You may have been charmed by Judge Kavanaugh, but he said under oath no current that no current Justice said whether they believed Roe was correctly decided at their hearing.

That's right!  @SenFranken wasn't accused of the things Donald Trump or Roy Moore were accused of.  Furthermore, an apology should be worth more than denials.  I believe Senator Franken when he denied one accuser. https://t.co/rAC1FtIX4K
@Morning_Joe Senator Franken should not resign.
@JoeNBC @SenFranken should not resign unless Trump, who did much worse, resigns.
@morningmika There's a big difference between what Roy Moore is accused of and what @SenFranken  apologized for and what @realDonaldTrump  did.  Senator Franken should not resign unless Trump resigns and Moore drops out of the race.
