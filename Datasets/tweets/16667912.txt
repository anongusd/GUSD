Swift also cites Blackburn‚Äôs opposition to gay marriage as a reason to oppose her. But given that this issue is essentially settled, it‚Äôs unclear why this should be a top concern for Tennessee voters. 6/6 #IWpol #WomenInPolitics https://t.co/cNhKrxoa6X
Sadly, VAWA funds tend to be grossly mismanaged so the GAO can‚Äôt tell how the money is spent and has urged better oversight. By opposing the VAWA status quo, Blackburn is pushing for a better law, one that better uses funding for prevention and victim services. 5/6
the question about its reauthorization isn‚Äôt whether you oppose violence, stalking, or date rape. The question is if you think that this law actually works as intended and that funds are being used properly to help victims, rather than for unrelated political purposes. 4/6
more class-action suits (great for lawyers, not so great for workers) and generate more red tape for businesses, which would hurt employees, particularly women. Similarly, the Violence Against Women Act sounds like a wonderful law ‚Äî who but a monster could oppose that? ‚Äî but 3/6
has worked to create more and better opportunities for women. First it‚Äôs already illegal to pay a woman less than a male coworker for doing the same work. The most popular legislation advanced by the Left under the equal-pay banner would just encourage 2/6
