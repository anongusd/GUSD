@vpi75wood Yes. More specifically, it's a constitutional amendment
@vpi75wood Yes, the legislation passed Saturday. It must be approved again by the 2020 General Assembly. If that happens, it would go to a statewide referendum in November 2020.

@vpi75wood There was no citizens commission involved in the process
@vpi75wood So court hired an academic expert to draw up a plan that met the court's guidelines. The court adopted his plan, which impacted the 11 districts + 14 adjacent districts
@vpi75wood The legislature (and Governor) were unable to agree upon a map
@vpi75wood The court ruled the 11 districts unconstitutional and gave the General Assembly a deadline of last fall to correct the lines
@vpi75wood Not aware of any such commission.

@CarrieMPruett You are correct about incorrect word choice. Thanks. Point of the map: Some localities that appear small on the geographic map have a massive impact on statewide electoral map (and vice-versa)
@david_sauerwein @JZTessler On Tuesday, 6 Virginia localities accounted for 1/3 of statewide ballots. That is not inconsistent with one-man, one-vote. It's just recognizing there are a lot more men (and women) in Fairfax County than, say, in Bath County.

@kmdric @RalphNortham Central AB out in Henrico, Chesterfield and Spotsylvania. In Chesterfield AB votes tilted a teensy bit Democratic last year compared to county results. Northam won Chesterfield 49.71 to 49.13 (0.58 pts) won CD7 AB 50.1 to 49.2 (0.9 pts)
Also out is Chesterfield Central AB, which in last year's governor's race was tilted a teensy bit Democratic last year compared to county results. Northam won Chesterfield 49.71 to 49.13 (0.58 pts) won CD7 AB 50.1 to 49.2 (0.9 pts)
Chesterfield Registrar shows 6 precincts out: @RalphNortham and Gillespie split them in last year's Governor's race. Most Democratic: #204 Jacobs; Most GOP #518 MidloNorth.

@frashure Sorry if you misread tone. By posting your results, I made a (false) assumption you expected a higher result for one candidate. The quiz tries to have a cross section of issues. Of course a different set of issues would give a different result
@frashure We find that people who are all in for one candidate can be surprised when there is an issue or two where they and their favored candidates disagree. Also, the quiz includes two issues where Kaine and Stewart agree. So, you can be 100% for one and not score 0% for other.

#Virginia CD10, biggest gains in absentee voting over 2017 at same point is voters 40 and under. Fastest growth is among women age 18-25 -- 4.5 times 2017 rate. In age 41-60, men have edged ahead of women.
No way to project how absentee votes will break in #Virginia CD10. Here is some historical perspective: In 2016, @BarbaraComstock won 47% of absentee votes and 54% of votes cast on Election Day.
@sosheepy @GlennKesslerWP @BarbaraComstock @JenniferWexton It is correct to say Virginia doesn't allow no-excuse early voting. But that is not the same as saying all people who are voting early (ie., before Election Day) are somehow lying.

@Ghentite @timkaine @CoreyStewartVA VPAP Board of Directors decided -- after Libertarian candidate for Governor last year polled 1% -- to adapt 15% threshold set by national presidential debate commission.
@AbigailDFox @timkaine It means you matched Kaine on 14 of 16 questions. Of course, the quiz doesnt measure what's most important to you.
@AbigailDFox Like last year, we selected a few questions where the candidates had the same position. It can be a shock to people when they learn they don't disagree with every single position taken by the candidate from the other party.
@AbigailDFox No. It's possible, of course, that they could have the same position.

@kmcurry Fir example, if the shift is toward the GOP,  it means had a past election taken place in the proposed district, Republican candidates would have gotten more votes among the district's voters.
@kmcurry There is no good/bad judgment. Simply a measure of how moving district boundaries (shedding some voters, picking up new ones) would have shifted results of past elections.

@vpi75wood @CoreyStewartVA Relevancy is what you make of it. Data shows that in THIS election turnout was down in equal amounts in two sets of precincts. So, all things equal Stewart did slightly worse than last year in rural precincts and better in suburban-urban precincts.
Here's visual that explains how @CoreyStewartVA under-performed in certain rural precincts while over-performing in suburban-urban precincts. Turnout in each set down &gt; 20% compared to June 2017 gubernatorial primary. https://t.co/cjlOM9m2St #PrimaryDay https://t.co/TCivaM31pN
@JCWilmore @CoreyStewartVA @NickForVA Turnout in statewide GOP primaries:	2017: 365,762	2018: 301,181 (unofficial)
Compared to last year's gubernatorial primary, @CoreyStewartVA found his greatest performance gain in #Southampton and #Winchester. His performance declined the most in @NickForVA's home base of #Culpeper | https://t.co/QH7wrKImgI https://t.co/1Tl02qeN37

What do Tues results in Loudoun County say about potential size of 'blue wave' this November? In June 2017 gubernatorial primary, there were 1.7 Dem ballots for every 1 GOP ballot cast. This June, Republicans closed that gap to 1.1 Dem ballots to every 1 GOP ballot. Discuss.
More details in a.m.: @CoreyStewartVA under-performed in rural precincts that he carried in 2017 and over-performed in suburban precincts that he lost in 2017.

In Nov. 2016, Dept of Elections estimated 335 provisional ballots cast in Newport News. 76 (or 23%) were counted in presidential race.
Historically, low percentage of provisional ballots are counted. This are people who (a) don't have ID (b) were not listed on voter rolls or (c) a other issues that cast doubt on voter's right to cast ballot.
RT @Zachary_Cohen: Shout-out to @vpapupdates, which has been an invaluable resource to reporters and voters this year for #VAgov and other…
State says 50 there were provisional ballots in Newport News, where HD94 margin currently 12 votes. Unclear how many in HD94. Could take days for local electoral board to determine which PVs to count.

Canvasses going on in other close House districts. There's also possibility of provisional ballots adding to vote total for one or more candidates.
Canvass is a chance for local election officials to double- and triple-check accuracy unofficial results reported to the @vaELECT on Election night. Not uncommon to find transposed numbers.

Small correction. Unofficial results show Dems +16 (not +15). Long day. https://t.co/Iqq3GMuV43
@DannyPlaugher @cFidd Yes, subject to results being certified and almost certain recount in handful of districts. Not set in stone, but that is current state.
5 House elections closer than 1% and qualify for recount: 3 won by GOP (Robinson, Bill Howell's open seat, Yancey); 2 won by Democrats (Hugo, Holcomb)
Results are unofficial. Vote count must be certified and, in handful of cases, subject to recount. There are many miles to go before a 50-R:50-D split is a sure thing.
If unofficial results stand, number of women in Virginia House will grow from 17 to 28 out of 100
Virginia Beach results in. Davis (R) leads; Holcomb (R) trails by less than 1%. Upshot: Unofficial results show Democrats pick up 15 seats; projected House 50-R, 50-D
Was just told that @CityofVaBeach should have absentee count within the hour.

Del. Holcomb (R) trails by 447 votes with absentees out. If there were 1,000 AB (7,000 total in city), Holcomb would have to win 72% to pass Turpin (D) https://t.co/ZjTT28Llhs https://t.co/0S3SzQOgQM
.@DelGlennDavis holds 657-vote lead with absentees out. If there were 1,000 AB (7,000 total in city), Coleman (D) would have to win 83% of them to pass Davis https://t.co/ZjTT28Llhs https://t.co/2vV0SabUN2

The results tonight are unofficial. The votes must be certified and, in some cases, subject to recount. The current 51R-49D split is not set in stone.
Women now account for 27 of 100 members (up from 17). Two races left - women candidates in both races https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc
4 House races qualify for recount: 3 won by GOP (Robinson, Bill Howell's seat, Yancey); 1 won by Dems (Hugo) https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc https://t.co/YDJsyT6d1e
@thomasbest100 As in all cases, Speaker is elected by a vote of the chamber.
GOP holds Ingram, Robinson seat. 2 Va Beach districts still out: GOP leads in 1 (Davis); Dems lead 1 (Holcomb). All eyes on the Beach https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc https://t.co/GohNvdqCUX
Four House races out - GOP leads 3 (Robinson, Ingram, Davis) and Dems lead 1 (Holcomb). If these hold, House goes 50R-50D https://t.co/Dx69yURJPb
@ldhsnamechange Loser can request recount if margin is 1 percent or less. State pays costs is margin is less than 1/2 of 1 percent
Closet race of night - Del. Yancey (R) wins by 12 votes. https://t.co/7Ha9DSsj3G https://t.co/eLJpu9e0in
Democrat Donte Tanner beats Tim Hugo by 68 votes in HD 40. Recount country. GOP has one-seat margin - w/four races to go. https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc https://t.co/ySD6E1gVIt
@BradKutner 1 percent. If the margin is 1/2 of 1 percent, state pays costs.
Anyone on ground in Chesterfield, Va. Beach or Prince Wm. have some 411 on absentees?
All that is left is absentees from Chesterfield, Virginia Beach, Prince William
Based on unofficial results, women in the Virginia House of Delegates would increase from 17% to 26%. Of races still out, 4/5 include a woman
AP Calls it for Fowler over Villanueva. Four races to call: Dems lead in 2 (Hugo, Holcomb) and GOP leads in 2 (Ingram, Davis) https://t.co/uiSgu6SbXp
@OutsideOfDog That is possible -- if Dems were somehow to win all five seats. I was starting with assumption that GOP candidates have leads in two districts.
Depending on outcome of 5 races, House partisan split could range from 53R-47D to 50R-50D https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc
Unofficial Results:  Dems +13 with 5 GOP-controlled seats left to call: Dems lead in 3 (Villanueva, Hugo, Holcomb) GOP leads in 2 (Davis, Robinson)  https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc https://t.co/o1BNhBOTwY
In several races, only thing left to count are absentees. Can't recall in past absentees coming in so uniformly late.
CORRECTION: Dems +9 with 9 GOP-controlled seats left to call: Dems lead in 8 (Villanueva, Hugo, LeMunyon, Loupassi, Massie's seat, O'Bannon, Davis, Holcomb https://t.co/ULqKWRQVzc
