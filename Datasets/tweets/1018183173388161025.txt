@GoboMontaco @POTUS @VP Be careful. They have the whole group report you at the same time so Twitter goes off the handle.
@secupp No that would be CNN.
@Feisty_FL Shows how scared they are. The only way they can beat him is if he doesn't even run. 🤣🤣
@JudieHall9 @KamalaHarris Their "future" will end in 2020.
@Auntie_Maxine Albino Gorilla sounds so mature. 😳
@AOC Write a bill making all libraries open 24/7!!!!!!! 😳
@JudieHall9 @KamalaHarris "As President"...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 They are so scared, now their asking him not to run in 2020.
@mattgaetz @GODandCountry33 @IsaacDovere @MiamiHerald Where is your retraction Isaac?????

@senrobportman What did you do for Otto? Nothing, you left him over there for a year. What did you expect the Prz. to do, yell liar liar pants on fire and walk out of the room? Grow up.
@AOC We weren't mad, we laughed and laughed and then laughed some more.
@RepAdamSchiff Quit threatening William Barr. You'll get what you get when you get it.
@GOPChairwoman I hope you guys have started paperwork on getting her removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is absurd that she is on this committee and is privy to confidential information.

@SenFeinstein Glad we don't need your vote.
@KamalaHarris Just the ones in CA and they're probably right. You guys have driven that state into the ground.
@ewarren He had no proof and was coached by Schiff, Cummings and Davis. You guys aren't fooling anyone. You're just embarrassing yourselves.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @SenateGOP You guys didn't even show up at the committee to put the vote forward. Chickens. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

@thehill @TheHillOpinion LOL. Like Mueller hasn't already talked to all these people. Nothing but a circus.

@Acosta Interesting, considering he talked about Cohen to the REAL news outlets. 🤣🤣🤣😋
@JudieHall9 @Acosta Dear Diary,
@senatemajldr They're new gun bill is frivolous and just for show. It would not have stopped one of the mass killings. I hope you are planning to vote it down in the senate.
@RepSwalwell And your new law would not have stopped one of the killings that happened. It's frivolous and for show. Luckily the senate will vote it down.
@SenGillibrand Where's your proof?
@Stella_Basham1 @gatewaypundit Maybe if he was going to a real pen. But usually 5 years or under, they're kept in county.
@CrackerJax123 @ChrisCuomo Then go debate your 5 year old.
@LiberalTed @KK_22_CA @DavidMDrucker Land is not voting, people are. The interests of 6 states should not dominate all 50. The electoral college is fair representation of all states.
@CrackerJax123 @ChrisCuomo Ahhh.... poor little snowflake. Is the Kool-Aid that good?
@thehill No, by now we DO NOT know that. Where is the proof??? Because dems say so, is that it? lmao.
@ChrisCuomo Obviously Trump isn’t going to say Kim Jong Un is a lying about Otto Warmbier during their summit.  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

@nytimes Julian Assange himself said no one from the Trump circle communicated with him. And the emails were not hacked, they were sold to Wikileaks by Seth Rich.
@JudieHall9 @SenSchumer @senatemajldr Not to mention all the illegal voting that went on in CA.
@DogHairDiva1 @ChrisCuomo I can't either. They make me cringe with all their lies. #TDS #GetHelp
@RightLaneEnds90 @ChrisCuomo He likes playing the fool.
@mattgaetz It's not right for the dems to hold closed door hearings. It's only purpose is so they can twist what Cohen says afterwards.
@Lowcountry1Girl @SenFeinstein When Joshua Trees are more important than newborn babies = Democrat.
@KamalaHarris The drugs that got caught. How many don't we catch coming through the open borders? You don't want to talk about that fact though.
@DavidWohl Can't stand her. She just loves to ham it up for the cameras, and comes off as an overly dramatic drama queen.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @SenateDems And that legislation will go no where because you don't have the majority. By the way just because a panel doesn't agree with what you want,, does not make it fake.

@KamalaHarris Here's a thought - don't commit a crime in the first place.
@RepDanCrenshaw The GOP is so afraid of it looking like they are politically targeting someone that they just let the cancer grow and fester. The dems would go after you guys in a NY second and wouldn't care what it looked like.
@RepDanCrenshaw I mean really, what do you expect us to do about it? His CA voters want him to do this crap. You guys have more power than we do to take care of this hack.
@RepDanCrenshaw Just get rid of Schiff. There is tons of dirt on him if you guys would just pick up the ball.
@SenSchumer He Chuckie, what about the Russian spy that set up the meeting in Trump tower but was working with Clinton and Glen Simpson? She called them twice before and after the meeting. When will you be addressing this?
@chowdallas That's what I keep saying! It's way past due for arrests.
@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness They have all they need to indict McCabe. Calling him back in front of the committee is a waste of time. No more talking, we want to see arrests!
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog "comedy"?
@thebradfordfile @RealJamesWoods @KamalaHarris I think she was in on the hoax. Trying to get her ridiculous lynching bill passed.
@DanRather He was saying he didn't need to do it if Congress would have done their job. HACK.
@AdamSchiff @JussieSmollett He Schiffty, 65 million #MAGA are waiting for your apology.

@AOCpress @ReneSaenz17 Prime Minister? Wow you are moving up fast!
@Dalesum32654835 Whittaker agreed to meet with them, and they had a time set and everything and then they turned around a subpoenaed him anyway. So he said no until they remove the subpoenae and gave them like 12 hours to do it.
@DanRather Don't insult our intelligence. It's over reach and you know it. smdh.
@LindseyGrahamSC @dcexaminer If you change it back to the 60 vote rule like you said you may, you can kiss good by ever getting another confirmed.
@AdamSchiff No, what is alien though to the rest of us is how much power the congress can have when it come to ABUSING their power to do witch hunts and to harass a sitting President.
RT @JohnCornyn: Who knew? “Green New Deal" is a resolution, not a bill, which means it's a "statement.” @playbookplus
@tamarak87131252 That's right. He had already agreed to a time and everything and than they subponae him. smdh.
@RepSwalwell Gaetz nailed it. And by the way, it was really petty of you guys not to let Scalise speak. What are you so afraid of?
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump You misspelled "Obama's Policy". Oh and by the way.... it was written by congress.
@RepSwalwell HAHAHAHA. Get use to it. No one is going to allow you guys to continue your witch hunt!
@senatemajldr And Graham wants to bring the 60 vote rule back????  What is wrong with that moron. You need to talk to him asap!
@senatemajldr Senator - Graham just said he is thinking about bringing the 60 vote rule back to the Judicial Committee. This would be a disaster. Another Trump nominee will not be confirmed if he does this.
@SenSchumer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Good thing we don't need your vote.
@RepSwalwell Hahahahaha. You guys can start expecting the same response to all your subpoenas that Matthew Whittaker just did!
FOX: Whittaker will NO longer be testifying to the committee as they are not acting in good faith and have nefarious intentions. WOO HOO!!!!! Love it!
@scribbyj @EricTrump @RepAdamSchiff And then there's this..... https://t.co/2ydHR3vdhJ
@LindseyGrahamSC Are you serious?? You are thinking about going back to the 60 vote rule? If you do that, you will NEVER get another Trump nominee confirmed. Your dem friends are no longer your friends. #WAKEUP

@RepAdamSchiff No, he said ridiculous investigations hurt the country. And he's right.
@StarmapperJoe @Paul_Schatz @SenSchumer @staceyabrams They did. It was high for Trump from Republicans, 30% approval from dems but here's the catcher - 86% approval from Independents. 🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏
@SenSchumer @staceyabrams She sounded ridiculous. No one could top our beloved POTUS SOTU let alone her.
@RepAdamSchiff LOL. Like you have anything Mueller doesn't.
@ChicagosFines19 LOL. I didn't really mind, I just happened to notice when you tweeted that. Thx for the follow back.
@ChicagosFines19 Yet you never followed me back. Hmm.
@outlawjw I thought the same thing. I think it was fake.
@AnnCoulter I'm fine with a "barrier". Speak for yourself.
@RealMAGASteve @TheTrumpLady @KamalaHarris She was one of the few doing that tonight. I guess she didn't get the memo to be decent. She just makes herself look bad to both sides.
@bennyjohnson @PetilloSuzette She was actually heckling him. Many of those women beat out Republicans. At least in CA.

@Acosta My favorite line of the whole speech. He nailed it. #KAG
@Lrihendry She fidgeted every time he made a good statement and got a lot of applause. Can read her like a book.
@KamalaHarris LOL. You sound nervous. You know it was one of the greatest SOTU of all time.
@Acosta His speech was absolutely excellent. You wouldn't recognize that though as you are not a Patriot.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump LOL. What a joke she was.

@RudyGiuliani That's what it's really about. It's not about race. They pushed the pro life agenda too far and it backfired. He's just their scapegoat.
@dcexaminer @JoeBiden You have posted this now about 20 times today. No one believes the BS polls. And no, the perv does not have a chance. Warren is in the race for the sole purpose of splitting his votes if he gets in. She knows she can't win. Split Bernie and Joe's votes.

@JudieHall9 @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Chuckie and Nancy think they are the President.
@Thomas1774Paine She's probably been picking boogers with it anyway.
@realDonaldTrump Go Venezuela!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Go blow yourself. You are not the President of the United States, he is.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews I would like to know why you let the dems push back the confirmation of Barr. You know their tricks. Just say NO.
@seanhannity 😢😢😢
@seanhannity Sean - please ask Lindsey why he is allowing the dems to keep pushing back the confirmation of Wm. Barr. Tell him to grow a backbone! @LindseyGrahamSC
@KamalaHarris Yet you dems are pushing laws allowing a new born baby to be murdered.
@ewarren @senatemajldr What he is against is illegal non citizens voting and you know this. So are the rest of us!
@catturd2 😢😢😢

@JudieHall9 @RepSwalwell LOL. They have been on video all over the news for the last two weeks but apparently he thinks his base does not watch the news. (And they probably don't).
@ChrisCuomo Because we all know the DNC was never hacked. They know it too which is why they refused to give their servers to the FBI. Seth Rich is the one that copied emails to Wikileaks. No one is buying and never have the fake CNN agenda.

@realDonaldTrump I was just starting to look forward to not having to watch her sit behind you chewing her cud for an hour and not clapping or standing.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, she will just come up with another excuse then. She doesn't want you to talk to us.

@SenFeinstein I bet you wouldn't have been if it were China. Tick tock......
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @JudiciaryDems LOL. Who are you kidding. You were going to vote no before you even heard who the nom was. We the people are tired of your resistance. Do your job.
@RepSwalwell You probably did pay him.
@BreitbartNews He's a grand standing POS.
@realDonaldTrump BS on Pelosi. Mr President hold the State of the Union Address as  scheduled. If the elected congress is serious about performing their  duties, they will show up. If they don't show, it reveals their true  character-or lack there of.
@politico Yes just like 80% of Americans think it is stupid.
@ChuckGrassley @JewelsJones1 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer
@lupo4cl2 @CarolineChrisom @SecNielsen And we own that bldg!
@seanspicer @SL1733 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS Very petty. The dems continue to embarrass our country.
@MSNBC @maddow https://t.co/EAFRnoHZxr
@thebradfordfile @Pink_About_it If she really thought it was a security risk, she would WANT him to give it.
@ChuckCallesto Can she do that??? She doesn't own the bldg, we do!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump #SchumerShutdown2 https://t.co/9lgYVOMC1N
@Feisty_FL Yes that and they know that their antics re Kavanaugh totally backfired.
@SL1733 https://t.co/KYvYfCp66I
@seanhannity He better put in a formal request for it to be investigated!!!!
@birdman8272 @SL1733 LOL. Any one that voted yes does not know our Prz. very well.

@DanRather I would offer that the GOP caved and threw Steve King under the bus. The term "racist" has gone out of control.
@SenatorDurbin Yet you were invited to the WH yesterday and did a no show. #StopTheSchumerShutdown
@SaraCarterDC It shouldn't take this long though.
@SenFeinstein https://t.co/fc3InTkX5M
@NevadaJack2 Schiffty is the one that needs to be investigated.
@JacobAWohl He got screwed over. GOP caved to the left to appease them. He needs to fight this.
@SteveScalise @bryfrei1961 I think you guys caved to the left and threw Steve King under the bus. You should review your decision.
@RepAdamSchiff Oh what a blow hard. Barr already said he is good friends with Mueller and is not going to shut it down. What are you so afraid of Adam? Tick tock.....
@FuctupMike I thought it was for saying illegal immigrants dirty up America.....
@DonaldJTrumpJr @ReneSaenz17 https://t.co/wMOHNtm7Q1
@prayingmedic He couldn't very well say he approves of it. He said other things that gave me the impression he will definitely be looking at Clinton.
@JohnCornyn @FreeBeacon Senator Cornyn, the thing with Steve King is not fair. I feel he is a scapegoat just to appease the dems.
@Auntie_Maxine 🤣🤣🤣
@Feisty_FL I couldn't believe her questions. Does she not realize the AG doesn't write law, the congress does??? smh. He handled her well though.
@kevinomccarthy GOP are mostly pathetic cowards. Nothing wrong with extolling the virtues of Western Civilization. You are using Steve King as a scapegoat to appease the left. Sad to throw him under the bus like this.

@Fuctupmind He's eating the dems up. It's fun to watch.
@KamalaHarris Most isn't ALL Kamala!!! And the statistics are misleading because the only ones that are caught are the ones that come through the port of entry.
@SenFeinstein It's the dems that politicized the DOJ and FBI, not the Repubs. You know that.
@SpeakerPelosi Don't celebrate yet, it's going to the Supreme Court!!!
@DRottiemom @GregRubini @maziehirono 🤣🤣👏👏👏
@MAGABots @catturd2 @SenateJudiciary Agree. I was wondering about that as well.
@freedom_moates I'd eat dog biscuits with Trump.

@catturd2 I can't believe no one has asked him if he thinks it was opened off of fraudulent findings. Because it was.
@Jim_Jordan I hope someone is investigating voter fraud. Because this is exactly why they want all these illegals here. They're hoping to rearrange the electoral college by population.
@SenWarren LOL. You were a no before you even heard his name. Don't you realize how foolish and unprofessional all of you are treating our justice system?

@SenatorCollins That's sweet that you continue to believe that. What have you done to convince the dems to give us our 5.6 billion for the wall though? Anything????
