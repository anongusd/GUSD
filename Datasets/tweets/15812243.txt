Debate recap:	Sniff. 	Pence who?	sniff. 	Locker room talk. 	sniff. 	Hate in her heart. 	Sniff. 	$1 billion loss taken. 	Sniff. 	#debate
Trumps answers are completely and totally asinine. It is a disgrace. Sniff. 	#debate
Sniff. 	We disagree on Syria.  	Sniff. 	Haven't talked to Pence. 	Pence who? 	Sniff. 	Sneak attack. 	Sniff. 	US is stupid.	#debate
Maybe Trump should've picked Bernie to be VP?  Seems like he really trusts Sanders- maybe he has VP remorse for Pence not defending him?
Sniff. 	I don't know putin. 	Sniff. 	I have no loans from Russia. 	Sniff. 	My balance sheet is great. 	Sniff. 	Tax docs? Later. 	#debate
Martha raddatz: Answer the question!	Another solid follow up -- 18 months too late. 	Trump should have been subjected to extreme vetting.
Sniff. 	Radical. Sniff. Islamic. Sniff. Terrorism. Sniff. 	You can't solve it unless you say it. 	Sniff. 	Say it without sniffing.	#debate
Cooper to Trump:  what does that mean? 	The most under-asked question of Trump. 	What. Does. That. Mean???	#Debates2016
Sniff. 	Obamacare is the worst. 	Sniff.  	Single payer is a disaster. 	Sniff. 	Canadians are coming into the US.  	Sniff. 	#Debates2016
Sniff. 	If I win, I'm getting a special prosecutor to look into your emails?	Sniff. 	Threatening a presidential candidate during a debate?
It's just words. 	Sniff. 	I'm gonna help everyone. 	Sniff. 	Sounds fair. 	Sniff. 	#Debates2016
Trump is-- 	Not. Fit. To. Serve. 	#Debates2016
