So rather than worry about a lack of innovation, we have much more anxiety about ensuring we are the first to see "the next big thing," which we assume is lurking behind every corner.
I am genuinely surprised when people ask if innovation has peaked in Silicon Valley. For 20 years, I have zero recollection of a time where we felt like ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù wasn‚Äôt right around the corner.
Or consider ‚Äì @discordap, @Nextdoor, and @marcopoloapp, three separate breakout social networks ‚Äì all started in a day and age where the common wisdom is the space has "matured" and is ‚Äúover.‚Äù

@d_len @nima3rad I think I can help here. The problem is that no one has a portfolio where all companies are 5X outcome. If you did, this would be fine, and that would be a top decile firm. The problem is, many go to $0. So the winners have to offset the less fortunate outcomes.
4/ Which leads to the purpose of this twitter-stream, does anyone know of a financial services vendor willing to enter in to this exact type arrangement (get paid to transfer $$) with smaller marketplaces? Let me know, and I will gladly promote who you are!
3/ Most of the experts in the field know about this reality - one of the few times you can turn a cost item into a profit item. Historically, when a situation like this exists, someone will find a way to bring it down market, such that smaller players receive the same benefit.
2/ When you get larger it turns out, you can get "paid" to distribute $$ to suppliers. How? Well you pay them on to a debit/CC account, and when they later use that account, your partner generates interchange fees which can now be shared with you (the marketplace provider).
1/ When you are building a multi-sided network, many marketplaces need to distribute $$ to suppliers. In this past this has cost $$/transaction. Not as much as a credit card transaction, but let's say in the 50-100 bps range.
@satyan It's not the fees, it's the under-pricing, which is much, much, much more costly to an organization. Lots of ink shed on this elsewhere.

@sks01119 @gregbettinelli Correct. If you really care about this subject read about how the UK attacked this decades ago. https://t.co/aYBtwbBhHc this is what our government should be doing.
@gregbettinelli You realize you are referring to the tech and banking stack that already exists and operates in Zimbabwe as a ‚Äúperfect world‚Äù that will ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù exist here.
And to suggest the proper action is for the government to regulate the use of cash? That will reinforce the real problem.
I think you are missing an important issue. The regulatory capture in the US has created a banking system where 3-day ACH is the norm, and innovation is cut off at the knees.

Other books that all entrepreneurs should read: 1) @MichaelEPorter, Competitive Strategy, 2) @geoffreyamoore Crossing the Chasm, 3) @claychristensen Innovator's Dilemma, and 4) @Jerry_Kaplan Startup
Another fascinating theme is how super successful and accomplished people become so personally enamored with the company's narrative being true that they shut their eyes and ears -- creating structural anti-governance.
There is a lesson in the book for every constituent -- employees, executives, investors, board members, and even corporate partners. Interestingly the employees had the most to say, but had the least amount of power - which kept them squelched.

@ducktalker any links on this? I am curious?
Old school network TV had scarcity of "prime time." With on-demand we can all have our own personal prime time.
As a consumer I feel this. As Netflix grows, there is more content that feels special to me, knowing quite well that some of this niche stuff will have very little appeal to the broader world.
Netflix CEO @reedhastings has argued that one of the network effects they have is that at scale they can more efficiently serve individual niches. Somewhat counter intuitive, but personal or special tastes will find what they love more often over time. All in one low $ package.
After many, many recommendations, I just finished the @netflix documentary "Wild Wild Country." It is really hard to explain how good this is. The characters, the breadth of video, the storytelling without taking a side. Must watch.

@trengriffin Which one could argue was also Facebook and Amazon's strategy.
Product is also getting better over time. Example: the Daily Mix product is fantastic &amp; leverages the size of the overall user base. This type feature, along with the use of personal and shared playlists, makes switching much harder &amp; raises barriers to entry (even for big 3).
Will Spotify eventually struggle because they can't generate meaningful cash flows? Of course that could happen -- but (1) being bigger is better [they don't have negative marginal costs], and (2) I stand buy the argument that the team has executed optimally.
When you consider these three large companies are betting big on voice input, music (and enabling easy selection and playback) is super important. I would bet quite a bit of money that every one of the three have discussed this potential acquisition.
I for one believe that Spotify is a very valuable strategic asset to at least three companies with monstrous market cap. Therefore, Spotify's value = a % of the average of these three companies market cap ($819B). More members is better for this %.
Here is why: Had Spotify traded growth for profits, they would be marginally profitable, and have fewer users (and would be worth less). It is in Spotify's best interest to be bigger and bigger, and the low cost of capital makes this trade-off possible.
I would offer the following in defense of Spotify. Can anyone name an alternate execution strategy that would have resulted in a higher equity value for the company? I would argue the answer is no. I think @eldsjal and company have basically optimized value creation.

.@solvhealth @heathermirj @dfarnedi 9) Solv is leaning into this  disruptive trend, applying modern-day marketplace techniques to this exciting consumer-focused provider base.
8) Today, we are excited to announce our investment in Solv (@solvhealth) founded by the incredible team of @heathermirj &amp; @dfarnedi
7) These new consumer focused entrants care about things like wait time management, transparency, reviews, and NPS score. New reality.
6) New provider entrants are rushing to meet this demand, which leads to the 1st real ‚Äúconsumerization‚Äù of our U.S. Healthcare system.
5) One new breakthrough trend: Rise of high-deductible plans (like ACA) is creating true consumers/shoppers for very first time.
4) Tons of market failure driven by indirect payment process, unnecessary presence of employer, regulation, as well as  regulatory capture.
3) Spent 3 years looking &amp; learning to develop a thesis about seams in the market that represent opportunity for true disruption.
2) While the opportunity in healthcare is massive (17-18% of GDP with tons of inefficiencies), navigating the landscape is quite tricky.
1) Over 3 years ago, sent tweet below. Having invested in OpenTable, Zillow, Grubhub, Uber, we felt same opportunity existed in healthcare. https://t.co/3pkC52baO4

@sagarbathija  Sorry.  Not true. :)
@alexrkonrad Depends on burn rate relative to stock pile.
@billmcneely I TOTALLY respect that!  Could be an advantage in near future! LOL.
@alexrkonrad Sure.
8/ Can you get to profitability on your last round? Have you even considered such a reality?
7/ Which Unicorn entrepreneurs/CEOs are prepared for such a shift? Who can adjust quickly?
6/ Investors are likely to refocus on business model viability and path to profitability. This will seem like an abrupt sea-change to many.
5/ If so, we may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability. It could be at an inflection point.
4/ One might reasonably assume that this would have an adverse impact on late stage private market liquidity and valuation. I certainly do.
3/ The bottom line is that global tech valuation multiples are compressing (coming in).  Quickly.
2/  The China stocks are also under pressure. The BATs (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) are down on average 34% off their highs.
1/ Tech stocks have been getting crushed the past 6 weeks.  Many names are down 25-50% from their highs. Today was very tough.
