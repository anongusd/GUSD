Let us use this 400th anniversary and the entire #BlackHistoryMonth to take every opportunity to recommit ourselves to acknowledging the stain of slavery and racism on our country and take the steps we need to truly find equality for all.
Now in 2019, we continue to see far too many African-Americans struggle from the systemic racism that began 400 years ago in Jamestown.
On this first day of #BlackHistoryMonth, we commemorate the first Africans who were brought here to Virginia as slaves in 1619 - 400 years ago.

The suffering and deprivation we have seen across the country clearly demonstrated that a #shutdown is not the answer to any disagreement.
Contrary to what President Trump said at the end of his speech, a #shutdown should never be the solution or even an option when governing. Everyone must be committed to finding a resolution without threatening or enacting another shutdown.
The President owes these Americans an apology for being hostages to his intransigence.
Fortunately, 800,000 federal workers will soon be back on the job, receiving long overdue paychecks so that they can pay their bills and feed their families.
Negotiating policy differences can be done without closing the government, without depriving dedicated workers of their paychecks, and certainly without depriving Americans of needed services.

Dr. King's incredible efforts to create a more equal and more just society inspire us every day. Let us never give up and not be discouraged. As Dr. King so eloquently said, "The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice." His legacy is our responsibility.
Today, as we honor the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we are all reminded that we have a long way to go until we achieve his dream of a world where people are judged by their character, not the color of their skin. #MLKDay

27 days of the #TrumpShutdown has left American families wondering how they will cover their basic costs of living, like rent &amp; groceries. It is time to #EndTheShutdown.
No individual who works full-time, year-round should live in poverty. It‚Äôs time to #RaiseTheWage.
Researchers estimate that just a 10% increase would drive up consumer spending by $2 billion a year. #RaiseTheWage üìà
The #RaiseTheWage Act would put more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans. This bill is good for workers, good for businesses, and good for the economy.

We are engaging in harmful behavior - seismic testing - just to find ways to engage in other bad behavior - offshore drilling. #ProtectOurCoast
Seismic testing, creating the loudest man-made sounds in the ocean, can disturb and even harm whales, turtles, dolphins and fish.
We cannot prioritize polluters‚Äô profits over our oceans. #ProtectOurCoast
President Trump and his cabinet officials have given these companies the green light to destroy wild life and fisheries without concern.
Offshore drilling in the Atlantic clearly panders to the corporations who stand to gain at the expense of the American people. #ProtectOurCoast
Seismic testing leads to offshore drilling, which can cause environmental disasters like #DeepwaterHorizon resulting in millions of gallons of oil spilling into our waters tarnishing marine life and coastal communities.
Coastal communities are united in fierce opposition to offshore drilling. I stand with my constituents who say no drilling off our coasts.
The Trump Administration‚Äôs nonchalant dismissal of #climatechange coupled with granting permits for seismic testing, action that leads to offshore drilling, is beyond alarming.
Issuing permits for seismic testing in the Atlantic Ocean puts our coastal businesses, fishing communities, eco-tourism, and our national security at risk. #ProtectOurCoast

The plan slashes EPA‚Äôs budget by $2.8 billion. This includes a 70% cut to #environmentaljustice enforcement; elimination of grants to fight lead poisoning; and reductions to state, local and tribal air quality monitoring programs.

I hope this bill will create lasting state-federal partnerships to preserve lands and improve water quality; I specifically hope that it will encourage states to set up new conservation easement programs.
I introduced the Clean Water Partnership Act (CWPA) in part to encourage every state to use a program similar to Virginia‚Äôs for the specific purpose of improving water quality. https://t.co/qYxjwI8WTo
Virginia landowners already have the ability, with our land preservation tax credit, to receive transferable tax credits when they accept conservation easements that prevent their land from being developed (or when they convey that land outright to a public or private preserver).
The need to prioritize our water quality means that each level of government must work cohesively with the members of our community to ensure that we have clean water available everywhere.
In my recent @RTDOpinions op-ed I highlight the importance of prioritizing water quality in our communities with the Clean Water Partnership Act. https://t.co/DVw2fuOHHH

In advance of @EPAScottPruitt‚Äôs hearing, I firmly stand with my colleagues in opposition to his proposed cuts to the EPA.

The American people have lost faith in the @EPA as a result of #PollutingPruitt and enough is enough which is why I am supporting a resolution that calls for his immediate resignation.
Furthermore, it is obvious that #PollutingPruitt is a disgrace to the @EPA.; He has one job. He‚Äôs failed it.

25+ oil spills in the United States alone since the #DeepwaterDisaster in 2010 is one too many.

The #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill taught us an unforgettable lesson. We cannot go backward. #ProtectOurCoast
Eight years later, we see the Trump Administration trying to open more of our oceans to offshore drilling solely to please #dirtyenergy business owners.
In the six long months it took to control the spill, 5 million barrels of crude oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico - damaging the local economy and the ecosystem.
Eight years ago today, we witnessed one of history's worst environmental disasters: the #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill.

The GOP tax bill was always crafted to benefit the select few. #TaxDay

While federal laws are currently in place to ‚Äòprotect‚Äô the civil rights of America‚Äôs students, it is our responsibility to vigorously enforce said laws. #RethinkDiscipline #InClassNotCuffs
.@TheJusticeDept and @usedgov must uphold the 2014 School Discipline Guidance Package, to remind schools of their legal obligations to administer school discipline without discriminating on the base of race, color, or national origin. #RethinkDiscipline #InClassNotCuffs

.@BetsyDeVosED and @HouseGOP want to rescind the 2014 school discipline guidance which turns a blind eye to the evidence-based @USGAO research and robs our nation‚Äôs students of full civil rights protections. #InClassNotCuffs #RethinkDiscipline
Recently, @BetsyDeVosED and @HouseGOP have criticized and wrongly blamed the 2014 guidance for increasing school violence, implying a reversal of this critical civil rights guidance. #RethinkDiscipline #InClassNotCuffs
The 2014 School Discipline Guidance Package, developed and released jointly by the Department of @usedgov and @TheJusticeDept, describes schools‚Äô obligations under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to administer discipline in a nondiscriminatory manner.

The government should be open &amp; working for the American people. Instead, the @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP chose to begin the #TrumpShutdown.
ASTOUNDING: The #TrumpShutdown is the 5th GOP government shutdown in under 30 years ‚Äì and the FIRST where they‚Äôve controlled the entire government. Republicans, it's time to #DoYourJob.

I call on the President to remember that disasters are not Democratic or Republican, that Puerto Ricans are American citizens.
Mayor Yulin Cruz continues to make every effort to help her community recover.
Mr. President, when it comes to needless partisan attacks as a diversion, look in the mirror.
Trump speaks bombastically of his ability to destroy N. Korea, then claims he can‚Äôt get better aid to PR b/c we‚Äôre separated by an ocean.
Today‚Äôs tweets were just the latest in a pattern that speaks to excuses and diversions, rather than solutions.
Our President, and their President, I might add, chooses to attack the mayor.
The people of #PuertoRico despair of having the most basic of life‚Äôs needs ‚Äì food, water and shelter.

Racial profiling - not legal. Stopping someone just for immigration status - not legal. Arpaio was not "doing his job," he broke the law.
Arpaio was a racial profiler targeting Latino Americans.
Arpaio broke the law &amp; was found guilty. He doesn‚Äôt deserve a pardon. He was not a ‚Äúselfless‚Äù public servant just "doing his job."
Banning transgender troops. Pardoning Sheriff Arpaio. Shameful, mean-spirited and un-American.

I am inspired by those who participated in the #womensmarch over the weekend. I stand by them.
Meanwhile, Democrats are laser-focused on ensuring that we only move healthcare access forward.
Republicans are laser-focused on making it harder for women to access the healthcare they need.

The #TrumpGlobalGag prevents NGOs from educating people about the dangers of unsafe abortion.

Today the @EPWDems has the chance to ask #PollutingPruitt exactly why he considers himself fit to run the @EPA.

About 10 million Americans earning moderate or middle level income will see a tax increase if the #ACA is repealed.
