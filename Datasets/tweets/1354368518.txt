@RamosTab @FIFAWorldCup Well done boys
@michaelG4NY They played “not to lose” at first and it cost them early. They grew into it and played well, but it was too late.
@ExtraTimeRadio I thought there were some poor player selections. McKennie, Pulisic, Weah combination looked good, but I think the game called for Adams over Trapp. Trapp looked good only after he battled nerves. At first they tried “not to lose” and it cost them 2 goals. Attitude was the key.
