@TMarie_10 @miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris Why did you delete your post about Charlottesville?
@TMarie_10 @miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris Im not so ignorant to understand that presentation is everything..being told to shut up from the start and now your bait tatics, show a lack of willingness to unite all humans..instead you bait and bc we dont fall for it, you start cussing and turning this into something else
@TMarie_10 @miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris Oh the hypocrisy.. They attacked @realDonaldTrump bc that guy backed him but no one is up in arms when he backs her?? Come on? You just turned a presentation/verbiage issue into a bait..well done by you!!
@TMarie_10 @miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris I said it was all about the presentation.  I have never disputed the unfair treatment of black women..ever..not in this post or any previosly.. Go back and read from the top.. I was told to "shut up and listen" from the first response
@TMarie_10 @miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris Im one of "the two white dudes" again another divide.. Men can have strong opinions about the care or lack there of for women!!! Esp. when that "one white dude" has been through a terrible ordeal regarding negligence of a hospital resulting in the death of a 19 day old
@miriamyohannes @jtp4eva @KamalaHarris Unfortunately thats true, however, presentation is everything. Even if that is the base of a proposed bill, the verbiage should show unity.
@jtp4eva @KamalaHarris I completely agree. However, the presentation of the verbiage will continue to divide. As much as we know its an uphill battle, verbiage is important by our leaders in order to create unity.  Too much segregation as it is.
@miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris I am sorry I missed the invite in the mail.. Could not find your TED Talk..	Your confusing research over the presentation of this.. "Esp. Black women" Divides us by suggesting Asian Women, Hispanic Women, White Women, Mixed Women, are not equal https://t.co/iPlrWWDyuI
@miriamyohannes @KamalaHarris All lives MATTER!!! Stop creating a divide and you listen.. Too often segregation happens in this country. Hence why we are a joke to the rest of the world. Nobody is listening. This is a HUMAN issue, not a black/white. Do not be apart of the divide. All women deserve better!!!

@charliekirk11 @alantbaird 		Have a look at the ease of coming in...
@alantbaird @nytimes You dont understand American politics Alan. If the Republicans meet all of the Democrats demands, they have zero leverage in moving their agenda forward. This is especially true for the next election. There would be no open talks with @SpeakerPelosi for border security
@bwrighteousfit @mikerashid7 @Bodybuildingcom @CrunchGym @JimStoppani You motivated me to get back at it!!! Lets get some brother!!
@alantbaird @nytimes As you can see there were 187 Republicans/out of 198 and 13 Dems that supported this. There were 11 republicans with a No Vote. regardless, they need DEMs to vote "Yay" to get that going.		We will give you a shout out tomorrow at noon. Tell your followers.
@alantbaird @nytimes I appreciate your faith and your GOOGLE knowledge, however sir 214 Dems voted "NAY" to makes appropriations available to those that have not been paid in 33 days. This is the problem sir. The federal workers are the ones suffering here. They need to get paid.
@RepDanCrenshaw You are a good man sir!!!		https://t.co/w2Us5K7OaM	"Success After Service"
