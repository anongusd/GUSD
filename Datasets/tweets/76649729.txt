‚Ä¶and determine whether we can both build the 234 miles of border wall that the president requested and avoid this dangerous precedent.
It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution regarding the national emergency declaration so there is time for the president‚Äôs lawyers to take another look‚Ä¶
It avoids taking money for military construction projects specifically approved by Congress such as military barracks and hospitals. And it also avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely the full 234 miles are ever built.
Using authority already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional crisis of separation of powers. It avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be misused by subsequent presidents.
There is a way the president can avoid this dangerous precedent completely: he can use the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234 miles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in his January 6 letter to the Senate.
The late Justice Antonin Scalia said, ‚Äúgenius of the American constitutional system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized in one person, or one part of government, the Bill of Rights is just words of paper.‚Äù
Separation of those powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes to the heart of our freedom.
The Constitution gave that responsibility exclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us United States senators has sworn an oath to support that Constitution.
After an American revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive who could tax the people and spend their money any way he chose.
There is no limit to the imagination of what the next leftwing president could do to harm our country with this precedent.
If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to provide the funding, then the next president can declare a national emergency and tear the wall down or declare a climate change emergency and stop oil exports and offshore drilling.
There has never been an instance where a president has asked for funding, Congress refused it, and the president then used the National Emergencies Act to justify spending the money anyway.
I support what the president wants to do on border security, but not the way he has been advised to do it. 		https://t.co/Gy2hIP72PR

The Democrat minority is determined to make it nearly impossible for @POTUS to form a government, to fill the 1,200 federal government positions that require confirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to nominations.
This is a problem not just for our Committee‚Äôs nominees‚Äîit is a problem for the entire Senate.
This meant these well-qualified nominees never received their confirmation, and had to be sent back to the president to be re-nominated at the start of the new Congress. Five of these nominees have been waiting over a year for their confirmations.
This Committee has already approved all but three of these nominees last Congress, but unfortunately, the Democrat minority has prevented these nominees from being considered on the Senate floor.
Today, the Senate HELP Committee advanced 11 of @POTUS‚Äôs well-qualified nominees to the full Senate for its consideration. https://t.co/wZXLCk4hM3

Today, I hope to hear about how close are we to having a non-addictive painkiller, and how doctors and nurses can better treat people with pain.
Now that we have started to turn the train around and head in a different direction on the use of opioids, everyone ‚Äì doctors, nurses, insurers, and patients ‚Äì will need to think about the different ways we should treat and manage pain.
And fourth, the new law requires the Secretary of @HHSGov to report the impact on pain patients that Federal and State laws and regulations that limit the length, quantity, or dosage of opioid prescriptions.
Second, we included provisions to encourage new pain management strategies, such as physical therapy. Third, the new law requires experts to study chronic pain and report to the Director of the @NIH how patients can better manage their pain.
First ‚Äì We gave the @NIH more flexibility and authority to spur research and development of new non-addictive painkillers. We have backed up those new authorities with substantial funding ‚Äì most recently $500 million to help the NIH find a new non-addictive painkiller.
We also took steps to ensure our new law wouldn‚Äôt make life harder for patients with pain, but now we need to take the next step to try to find new ways to help them.
Last year, Congress passed comprehensive opioid legislation to combat this crisis, which @POTUS called ‚Äúthe single largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of our country.‚Äù
More than 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, including prescription opioids, making it the biggest public health crisis in our country.
These Americans need more effective ways than opioids or other addictive painkillers to manage pain. Opioids, which are commonly used to treat pain, can lead to addiction and overdose.
We are holding this hearing to better understand the causes of pain, how we can improve care for patients with pain, and where we are on developing new medicines and ways to treat pain.
But on the theory that every action has an unintended consequence, we want to make sure that as we deal with the opioid crisis, we keep in mind those people that are hurting.
Here is the reality: we are engaged in a massive effort to make dramatic reductions in the supply and use of opioids ‚Äì the most effective painkiller we have.

Today, I am interested in hearing more about specific recommendations to improve access to affordable primary care.
And, employers are increasingly taking an active role in their employees‚Äô health and in the cost of health care, like employing a doctor on-site so employees don‚Äôt have to take time off of work to see a primary care doctor.
There are other ways to lower health care costs through expanded access to primary care. Another is community health centers, which we talked about at our last hearing and that are where 27 million Americans go for their primary care.
And, while the data may be incomprehensible today, it is a ripe opportunity for innovation from private companies to arrange the data so primary care doctors can help their patients can have better outcomes and better experiences at lower costs.
I believe we can empower primary care doctors, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants to go even a step further. At our 4th hearing, we heard about how patients have no idea how much a particular treatment or test will end up costing.
Dr. Adam Boehler, who leads the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, recently told me that primary care is only 3-7 percent of health care spending, but affects as much as half of all health care spending.
Dr. Gross‚Äô practice is one of about a thousand similar clinics in the United States and is a good example of how a primary care doctor can help reduce costs.
In 2010, Dr. Gross created one of the first Direct Primary Care practices. Instead of working with insurance companies and government programs, Dr. Gross‚Äô patients pay him a flat monthly fee directly.
.@drleegross, of Florida, testified last year at this committee‚Äôs fifth hearing on the cost of health care that too many government mandates and insurance companies were getting between doctors and patients and making primary care more expensive than it needed to be.

It is our responsibility to take whatever steps we can to help students afford college and make sure that the degrees they earn are worth the time and money they pay for them. #MakingCollegeWorthIt https://t.co/vwhLbGluFE
In my conversations with Democrat and Republican senators, I have found a remarkable degree of bipartisan consensus about the directions we should take to make college affordable and make students‚Äô degrees worth their time and money.
This year, I have met with Ranking Democrat Senator @PattyMurray and nine other committee members to discuss compiling these ideas into a single piece of legislation.
During the last four years, the Senate education committee has held 27 hearings on the Higher Education Act.  These hearings have resulted in a number of bipartisan proposals that make college more affordable and worth students‚Äô time and money.
Third, I am proposing a new accountability system based upon whether borrowers are actually repaying their student loans. This should lower tuition for some programs, or even discourage schools from offering programs that are not worth it to students.
This plan makes sure if there was no money earned, there would be no money owed, and that would not reflect negatively on a borrower‚Äôs credit. The other option would be a 10-year payment plan, with equal monthly payments, similar to a 10-year mortgage.
The option I believe most borrowers would choose is a repayment plan based on a borrower‚Äôs income, which would never require the borrower to make payments of more than ten percent of his or her discretionary income.
Second, a new way to repay student loans: We should scrap the current system of nine different ways to repay federal student loans. It should be replaced with two options, both of which would automatically deduct payments from your paycheck.
First, simplify the #FAFSA: We can cut the dreaded Free Application for Federal Student Aid from 108 questions to no more than two dozen.
Today, I have three proposals to help make the answer to all four of those questions YES.
And from administrators as well‚Äîcan‚Äôt you do something about the jungle of red tape that makes it so hard to apply for federal financial aid, to pay back student loans and that wastes money on overhead that could instead be spent on students?
The questions I hear most often about college are: Can I afford it? Is it worth it? And can you make applying for financial aid and repaying student loans simpler?
The U.S. has most of the best colleges in the world, but also the most graduates paying off college debt. Roughly 40 million borrowers owe $1.5 trillion in collective student loan debt.
A college graduate paying more than $1000 per month on student loans recently wrote, ‚ÄúI was told to chase down a bachelor‚Äôs degree by any means necessary. But no one mentions just how expensive and soul-crushing the debt will be.‚Äù

Two weeks ago, Senator @PattyMurray and I took the first step by introducing legislation that will extend funding for community health centers for five years at $4 billion a year in mandatory funding.
In Fiscal Year 2019, these centers received $4 billion in mandatory funding and $1.6 billion in discretionary funding. Congress has to act by the end of September to make sure community health centers continue to receive this federal funding and keep their doors open.
Community health centers have also been an important part of combating the opioid crisis that has impacted virtually every community across the country. #OpioidCrisisResponse
There are about 1,400 federally-funded health centers that provide outpatient care to approximately 27 million people, including 400,000 Tennesseans, at about 12,000 sites across the United States.
Because the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional is a community health center, they charge patients based on a sliding scale which means more people have access to and can afford health care close to home.
The old hospital building was turned into the Lewis Health Center @MauryRegional, a community health center which operates as something between a clinic and full hospital. Lewis Health Center estimates they can deal with about 90 percent of patients that walk in the door.
For example, in Tennessee, after Lewis County‚Äôs only hospital closed, the closest emergency room for its 12,000 residents was 30 minutes away.
Community health centers actually fit into a larger topic of great interest to this committee ‚Äì primary care. Today, we are talking about the community health centers where 27 million Americans receive their primary care and other services.
Today‚Äôs topic is extending federal funding for community health centers, as well as four other federal health programs, which are all set to expire at the end of September.
I will be working on these priorities with Ranking Member @PattyMurray, with members of the HELP Committee, and other senators interested reaching a result on lowering health care costs and updating the Higher Education Act.
This is the first hearing of the new Congress so let me take a few minutes to talk about what we hope to accomplishment these next two years. Number one, reducing health care costs. And number two, making sure a college degree is worth students‚Äô time and money.

A second priority is reauthorizing the Higher Education Act to ensure that the expense of a college education is worth it for students.

In 2013, 68 senators ‚Äî including all 54 Democrats ‚Äî voted for such a bill, but the House refused to take it up. That bill included more than $40 billion and many other provisions to secure our borders.
3.Go really big: Begin the new Congress by creating a legal immigration system that secures our borders and defines legal status for those already here...
2.Go bigger: Pass the bill that 54 sens‚Äîincluding 46 Ds‚Äîvoted for last Feb that combined a solution for children brought to the U.S. illegally (DACA) &amp; $25B in appropriated funding for border security over 10yrs. The bill failed only because of last-minute White House opposition.
1.Go small: Give the president the $1.6B he asked for in this year‚Äôs budget request, which the bipartisan Senate Appropriations Committee approved. Provide an additional $1B to improve border security at ports of entry, which everyone concedes is needed.
I've suggested three specific solutions for ending the partial government shutdown:
When the president of the U.S. has a legitimate objective‚Äîwhich in this case is increased funding for border security, including a physical barrier‚Äîmembers of Congress should bend over backwards to accommodate it, especially when they've voted for that same policy in the past.

This shutdown is a failure by negotiators, both Democrat and Republican, and will produce a success for no one.
This shutdown wastes taxpayer dollars, adds uncertainty to the economy and hurts small businesses around our national parks. A government shutdown should be as off limits in budget negotiations as chemical weapons are in warfare.
When the government shut down under President Obama, I said that I was elected to make the government work for taxpayers, not to shut it down. The same is true under President Trump.
I want to make sure Tennesseans know, as I have said from its beginning, that I believe there is no excuse whatsoever for this partial government shutdown.
I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year! https://t.co/xBbEF8E9em
I was not elected to shut down the government, I was elected to make it work for taxpayers. This is a complete failure of negotiations and a success for no one.
Shutting down the government should be as off limits to budget negotiations as chemical weapons are to warfare. I was not for a government shutdown under President Obama. I'm not for a government shutdown under President Trump.
There is no excuse for even a short-term, partial government shutdown.
I want to put a stop to this practice of the Senate breaking its rules to change its rules. I will not vote to turn the Senate into a rule-breaking institution, and I hope that my colleagues will not either.
This is a country that prizes the rule of law ‚Äì I‚Äôve heard President Trump say that, and I've heard President Obama say that. How can we expect Americans to follow the rules when their number one rule making institution, the U.S. Senate, will not follow its own rules?
Ending the legislative filibuster would be like allowing the home team to change the rules in the middle of the game, saying a nine yard gain is a first down, or a three point shot counts as four.  That's not the rule of law.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says that almost all fentanyl that comes to the U.S. is, one way or the other, produced in China.
Opioid abuse is the number one U.S. public health epidemic, killing more Americans last year than automobile accidents. Fentanyl can be 100 times stronger than opioid prescription pills and is the source of the greatest increase in opioid overdoses and deaths.
.@POTUS deserves great credit for persuading China to make the selling of fentanyl subject to the maximum penalty under Chinese law.

Fourth, the Committee will vote on Emergency Medical Services for Children Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, offered by @senorrinhatch, @SenBobCasey, and Senator @brianschatz.
Third, the Committee will vote on @SenatorBaldwin and Senator @lisamurkowski‚Äôs Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, which will help bring more doctors and nurses to rural and other areas where there is a shortage of these providers to provide care for pregnant women.
Second, the Committee will vote on the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization of 2018, offered by @senorrinhatch and @SenBobCasey.
Today we are going to vote on an additional five bills. First, the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer‚Äôs Act, offered by @SenatorCollins, along with Senator @timkaine, @SenCapito, and @SenCortezMasto.
This Congress, the HELP Committee: has approved 14 bills that have been signed into law; reported to the Senate floor 9 additional bills, six of which the full Senate has sent to the House; has held 58 hearings; and approved 46 nominees.
We have also passed bills such as the PREEMIE Act, to prevent preterm births and reduce infant deaths, and the Childhood Cancer STAR Act, to encourage pediatric cancer research.
And last August, @POTUS signed into law the @US_FDA user fee agreements that will help bring new drugs and devices to patients more quickly.
In July, @POTUS signed the Perkins CTE Act, which @SenatorEnzi and @SenBobCasey worked on and we passed through this Committee. This legislation funds the career and technical education programs that train the skilled workers employers tell us they need.
Also in October, @POTUS signed @SenatorCollins‚Äô bill to ban the ‚Äúgag‚Äù clauses that prevented a pharmacist from telling a patient their prescription would be cheaper if they paid with cash instead of using their insurance.

Going forward, I plan to take what we‚Äôve learned from our hearings, and ask leading health care policy experts for specific ideas on how the federal government can reduce the cost of health care.
Today, we‚Äôll hear more stories like this about how the private sector is working to address America‚Äôs high health care costs and hearing what Washington needs to do to get out of the way of private sector innovation.
According to @HCAhealthcare, this reduction in MRSA infections saves $170,000 for every 1,000 patients. Those savings are shared among the hospital, insurers, and patients.
.@HCAhealthcare has implemented new techniques to reduce the spread of MRSA, a drug-resistant bacterial infection, in Intensive Care Units. These new techniques have reduced cases of MRSA by 37% in HCA hospitals.
Private health care companies also have the ability to reduce health care costs. For example, @HCAhealthcare has 178 hospitals and 119 freestanding surgery centers located in 20 U.S. states and the United Kingdom.
A third way is for employers to band together to circumvent traditional insurance and negotiate better deals on laboratory testing such as CT scans and MRIs, surgeries including knee and hip replacements, and other health care for their employees.
One way employers can reduce health care costs is through wellness programs ‚Äì which encourage employees to lead healthier lives. Another way to reduce the cost of health care is to give employees access to additional resources.
We heard at a previous hearing how employers have incredible purchasing power when buying health care for their employees and are more motivated than ever to take advantage of that purchasing power.
Employers are the largest purchasers of health insurance in the country ‚Äì 181 million Americans, or roughly 60% of the insured population, get their insurance on the job.
While there may be a role for government to play, at today‚Äôs hearing ‚Äì our fifth in this series ‚Äì we will examine ways private companies, doctors, and states are taking innovative steps to disrupt the health care system and reduce health care costs.
In June, the HELP Committee launched a series of hearings on the rising cost of health care ‚Äì an issue that is at front of every Americans‚Äô mind.

By adopting these measures, China would become a global leader on fentanyl control and avoid being seen as the source of the world‚Äôs most pressing drug problem. #OpioidCrisisResponse https://t.co/93WY8jIccc
Scheduling fentanyl as a class and enhancing enforcement against illicit fentanyl producers are the keys to stemming the flow of fentanyl substances from China to the U.S and other countries.
So the request we made of Chinese officials was this: control all fentanyl substances as a class, just as the Trump Administration did for the U.S. in November, 2017.
China cooperates with U.S. law enforcement agencies to combat the fentanyl crisis, but our cooperation faces challenges when a substance is not on China‚Äôs controlled substances list.

In four bipartisan Senate health committee hearings I chaired last fall, virtually every witness told our committee that waiver application is too cumbersome, inflexible, and expensive for states to use.

What do Democrats have against lower-cost insurance that doesn't change one word of the Affordable Care Act's protection guarantee for pre-existing conditions?
Why do Democrats want to keep 1.7 million Americans who won't have insurance in 2019, according to the Urban Institute, from being able to buy these short-term health insurance plans?
I hope that across this country as Americans look at this they will ask Democrats: ‚ÄúWhy do you want to kill a rule that President Obama favored, that gave people who might lose their jobs or couldn't afford Obamacare a chance to buy insurance that might be 70% cheaper?‚Äù
I hear often from Tennesseans that they struggle to afford their prescriptions. This new law takes a simple step to allow a pharmacist to tell a patient about the option to potentially pay less for prescription drugs so they can keep more of their money in their own pockets.

So I'm going to think about what @SenatorCollins has said, and I hope other members of the body do, and I hope many Americans do as well.
Not just because I happen to agree with her, but because she showed characteristic diligence, independence, and fairness, and a suggestion of the lessons that we should have for the future of this unique institution and this unique country that we prize so much.
I've heard speeches in this body for nearly a half century, both as a young aide and as a member of the United States Senate, and I will remember this one.
I think the more important takeaway from what the senator from Maine said is that we've reached what she said she hopes is the rock bottom in the Senate confirmation process. This is not the way things should be, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.
It is sometimes said that today's Senate does not measure up to Senates of previous years because we have no eloquent senators who make compelling speeches. I think @SenatorCollins just disproved that today.

The Every Student Succeeds Act put states back in the driver‚Äôs seat for decisions on how to help their students, and I am eager to see what this new chapter holds for our nation‚Äôs students.
Today, we will hear specifically from additional three states who, based upon my review of the plans, have also taken advantage of the flexibility we encouraged under the law to design innovative plans.
Last October, this Committee held a hearing to hear from the State education chiefs in three states, Tennessee, Louisiana, and New Mexico, that were among the best at making the most of the new law by designing innovative plans.
Under #ESSA, in order to receive over $18 billion in annual federal funding, states have the chance to design their own State plan that includes setting academic goals for students, measuring schools‚Äô performance, and deciding how to fix failing schools.
Today, I hope to hear how Nebraska, South Carolina, and Delaware are taking advantage of that opportunity.
The Every Student Succeeds Act gave Tennessee, in @Mrs_C_Hines‚Äô words, ‚Äúa real opportunity for our state to build on the progress we‚Äôve made and enact change, particularly in traditionally-underserved communities.‚Äù
The consensus this Committee reached was: Continue the law‚Äôs important measurements of academic progress of students but restore to states what to do about that progress.
Reaching the point of fixing No Child Left Behind took seven years of Congressional efforts, 27 hearings, and a three day markup where this Committee considered 57 amendments.
Mrs. Hines: ‚ÄúESSA empowers Tennessee with the responsibility to decide how to close achievement gaps, improve schools and make sure that all our children succeed.‚Äù
Mrs. Hines: ‚ÄúUnlike the previous federal education law, No Child Left Behind, #ESSA gives Tennessee more autonomy to design policies to meet the needs of our state‚Äôs students.‚Äù

In an age when you can compare different prices and check a dozen reviews when shopping for a new BBQ grill, Americans should be able to know the cost of their health care.
While the private sector is largely leading the charge on making health care information more easily available, the federal government can also play a role to help patients, and witnesses today can inform Congress about steps we can take.
As patients have shopped around for Lasik, the price started to dramatically decrease ‚Äì it has gone down 75 percent over the last 15 years, according to @RandPaul.
.@RandPaul has talked about how, with an elective surgery such as Lasik, a patient is more likely to call doctors‚Äô offices to find the best price, calling an average of four different doctors to find the best price for the corrective eye surgery.
Today‚Äôs hearing is an opportunity to learn how we can improve what information is easily available about the cost and quality of health care, so patients can make the best health care decisions for them, their families, and their wallets.
This is true for everything else but not for health care ‚Äì the cost of health care has remained in a black box.
The Internet has made it easier for consumers to know more about what they want to purchase before they actually buy it. You can easily read an online review and compare prices for everything from a coffee maker to a new car.
After using a website that compiled typical prices for medical care, he learned the same test would have cost just $550 in a doctor‚Äôs office. @SecAzar said that consumers are so in the dark they often feel ‚Äúpowerless.‚Äù
.@SecAzar recently told the story of his doctor ordering a routine echo cardio stress test. He was sent down the street and admitted to the hospital, where, after considerable effort on his part, he learned the test would cost him $3,500.
As any American, even @SecAzar, knows, it can be very difficult to find out how much a simple health care test will cost, before a doctor‚Äôs visit.

More recently, half the Democrat senators voted to confirm President George W. Bush‚Äôs nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2014, I voted to confirm President Barack Obama‚Äôs nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, not because I agreed with her, but because she was qualified.

RT @cspan: .@NIHDirector Dr. Francis Collins and others testifies before the Senate @GOPHELP @HELPCMTEDEMS on Science &amp; Stewardship at #NIH‚Ä¶
But, if there are some bad actors who are attempting to influence @NIH-funded research, we want to know about it and we want to know what authority you need, or others need, to deal with it.
It is important to protect the integrity of research funded by the federal government. It is also important to recognize the role that scientists from other countries have played in research funded by the U.S. government.
.@NIHDirector Dr. Francis Collins recently told Senator @PattyMurray and me information about an ongoing investigation into federally funded research, including, in some cases, research conducted by foreign nationals.
This spending is part of the so-called discretionary spending, which is roughly 29 percent of all federal spending and includes NIH, national defense, national parks, and national laboratories. So, funding for research is not the reason for the increasing federal debt.
The second thing to keep in mind is that these large increases in funding for biomedical research and other increases for our national laboratories and other basic research are not the part of the federal budget that creates the huge national deficit.
There are two things I think we should keep in mind when we look at the large increases in funding Congress has given the @NIH in recent years: First, we often say it is hard to think of a major scientific advancement since WWII that has not been supported by federal funding.
Development of a new, non-addictive painkiller, which may be the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù to solving the opioid crisis; and, The creation of a safe and effective artificial pancreas, making life easier and healthier for the millions of Americans with diabetes.
Some of those predictions were: Being able to identify Alzheimer‚Äôs disease before symptoms appear; The possibility we could rebuild a patient‚Äôs heart with their own cells; Development of new vaccines, including for Zika and HIV/AIDS, and a universal flu vaccine‚Ä¶
The reason Congress has devoted so much funding to biomedical research is captured in testimony you gave to the Senate Appropriations Committee in April 2016, when you offered ten ‚Äúbold predictions‚Äù of what we might be able to achieve in the next ten years.
The purpose of this hearing is oversight, to make sure that this record amount of billions of new dollars for biomedical research is being spent wisely.
Today, we expect the full Senate to approve an additional $2 billion increase to @NIH funding for next year. If the bill we hope the Senate approves today is signed into law, Congress will have increased funding for NIH by $9 billion since 2015 ‚Äì a 30% increase.
In 2015 and 2016, Congress increased funding for NIH by $2 billion each year. And then in 2017, Congress increased funding for NIH by $3 billion, including $500 million to work on a non-addictive painkiller.
So I said, In December, 2016, Congress passed what @SenateMajLdr called the ‚Äúmost important legislation of the year,‚Äù the 21st Century Cures Act.
Not long ago, I ran into a friend who is very interested in Vanderbilt University Medical Center‚Äôs cancer research. He said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it a shame that the government isn‚Äôt funding biomedical research like it ought to.‚Äù

With @POTUS‚Äô signature, more than 200,000 Tennesseans who participate in career and technical education programs will get a boost in learning the skills that help them find a good job and put them on the path towards the middle class.

At a time when our economy is booming, what I hear most often from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers.

As we look at how to reduce health care costs, we should keep in mind that what may seem like a good idea or a magic bullet in Washington may actually result in something very different for doctors and nurses.
The Trump Administration has taken a look at what administrative tasks are required by the federal government and I am glad to see that @SeemaCMS &amp; @CMSGov, which oversees Medicare &amp; Medicaid, recently proposed streamlining many of the agency‚Äôs burdensome reporting requirements.
The average community hospital needs 23 full time employees just to keep up with the regulations about what a hospital needs to do to participate in Medicare ‚Äì called ‚ÄúConditions of Participation,‚Äù according to the @ahahospitals.
According to the @ahahospitals, there are 629 different regulatory requirements from four different federal agencies that doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers have to comply with.
This is just one example of how well-intentioned ideas from Washington can turn out to add to the administrative burdens doctors face.
Unfortunately, electronic health records systems have ended up being something physicians too often dread, rather than a tool that‚Äôs useful.
For example, there was a lot of excitement over electronic health records in Washington ‚Äì many said these records systems would make it easier for doctors and patients to access a patient‚Äôs health records and share information with other doctors.
While many administrative tasks in the health care system come from outside the federal government‚Äîsuch as insurance company or state requirements‚Äîthe federal government is clearly at fault for some of this burden.
Administrative costs are much higher in the U.S. than in other countries. According to Dr. Ashish Jha, a witness at our first hearing, administrative costs accounted for 8% of all health care spending in the U.S., roughly that is $264B, compared to only 1%-3% for other countries.
Today, we are examining the cost of administrative tasks ‚Äì which includes everything from the time spent filling out insurance claims to buying software for an electronic health records system.
At our last hearing, we focused on reducing what we spend on health care by examining two things: one, on reducing unnecessary health care tests, services, procedures, and prescription drugs, and two, how to increase preventive care.

The hope is that with a modernized approach to apprenticeships, industries that weren‚Äôt around when Paul Revere was training to be a silversmith or even when Elvis was learning to be an electrician, would be able to start apprenticeship programs.
Another type of apprenticeship is an ‚ÄúIndustry Recognized Apprenticeship.‚Äù These apprenticeships are an alternative to federally-registered apprenticeships, with more flexible requirements developed by industry and less administrative red tape.
One way for workers to learn new skills is what we are looking at today: apprenticeships. Today, federally-registered apprenticeships are especially concentrated in industries like construction and manufacturing, and work well for many employers and workers.
On Monday, the Senate passed an update to the #PerkinsCTE ‚Äì which this committee worked on ‚Äì a nearly $1.2 billion federal program of grants to states that help fund CTE programs at high schools and community colleges.
In this booming economy, there are 6.6 million job openings, and what I hear most from Tennessee employers is that they need more skilled workers. Congress is doing our part to close the skills gap.
The United States is in the middle of the best economy in 18 years ‚Äì and in one month this year, the unemployment rate fell as low as it has been since 1969, nearly half a century ago.
For the millions of Americans who are looking for ways to improve their skills, make a good wage, and live the American Dream, high-quality apprenticeship programs- whether federally- registered or not- are a smart path forward.
We are here today to explore ways to modernize apprenticeships, which are training programs that allow workers to ‚Äúearn and learn‚Äù at the same time.

The substitute amendment introduced by myself and @RoyBlunt will: 	- Clarify legal liability	- Establish a clear timeline for corrective actions	- Protect restaurants from frivolous lawsuits for minor violations	- Allow access to nutrition information online
But after Senate Democrats raised concerns about the House bill, @RoyBlunt and I drafted this targeted solution to help give the food industry the certainty and flexibility it needs to implement the rule.
To make the menu labeling rule more workable for restaurants and to make access to nutrition information easier for customers, the House passed the bipartisan Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act twice, both times with strong bipartisan votes.
When Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, they included a provision mandating nutrition labeling in restaurants and food retailers with over 20 stores nationwide. The final menu labeling rule went into effect earlier this year. https://t.co/yE3UNsOoxI
Today Senate Democrats blocked a common-sense bill introduced by myself and @RoyBlunt to prevent a 21-year-old manager at a Tennessee Chick-fil-A from facing criminal and financial penalties if an employee puts extra slices of cheese on a sandwich. https://t.co/9n2ZD1ztF1

We are gaining near unanimous support in both the House and Senate, and I‚Äôm hopeful the legislation will become law this year.
Too many roads, trails, campgrounds and visitors centers are in bad shape, and American families spending their vacations in our national parks are disappointed and sometimes shocked to find that they are in such bad shape or even closed.
Our bipartisan legislation could cut in half the nearly $12 billion in deferred maintenance at our @NatlParkService, including the @GreatSmokyNPS, and help restore our 417 national parks.

I look forward to working with @PattyMurray and other members of the Committee to add to our list of accomplishments over the next few months.
This Congress, we have held 54 hearings, almost all bipartisan, on topics ranging from the cost of prescription drugs to making it easier for students to apply for federal financial aid.
The approval of these four bills will add to the already significant bipartisan legislative accomplishments this Committee has achieved so far this Congress.
Fourth, we will consider the Action for Dental Health Act that @CoryBooker, along with @BillCassidy, @MazieHirono, and @SenatorTimScott have worked on, to help prevent dental disease, and expand efforts to provide care to low-income and underserved patients.
This bill will allow the @HHSgov to study sickle cell disease and other heritable blood disorders so we know how many people are affected by these conditions and implement strategies to help treat these diseases.
Third, we will consider @SenatorTimScott and @CoryBooker‚Äôs Sickle Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Act.
Second, we will consider the Congenital Heart Futures Act, introduced by @SenatorDurbin, which will continue to support research that will advance our understanding of congenital heart disease.
In other words, if you walk into a pharmacy and ask for the prescription your doctor has written for an antibiotic, you might have a copay of $40 under your insurance plan but if you pay with cash, it could only be $5.
First, we will consider @SenatorCollins‚Äô Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, which would ban ‚Äúgag clauses‚Äù that prevent a pharmacist from telling a patient a drug may be cheaper if they pay with cash instead of their insurance.
Today we are going to consider four bills that will help millions of Americans ‚Äì including those with sickle cell and congenital heart disease, those with limited access to dental care and people who are struggling to afford their prescriptions.

Ms. Martin did not have a confirmation hearing, nor did any of the assistant secretaries for this position going all the way back to the Clinton Administration.
To compare, President Obama‚Äôs first Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development, Carmel Martin was nominated on March 18, 2009, and was confirmed 44 days later by voice vote.
At Democrats‚Äô request, the HELP committee held a confirmation hearing for James Blew on November 15, 2017. The committee first approved his nomination on December 13, 2017, 216 days ago.
Former DC public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, a Democrat, called James Blew "an important partner and advisor to me since my days as Chancellor in D.C." when Blew replaced her as head of her organization StudentsFirst.
For 20 years, he has advocated for improving educational opportunities for families and children by overseeing grants to low-income, high-risk schools.
James Blew is well-qualified to lead the Office of Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development and did not need to be subject to seven months of delays by Senate Democrats.
At 11:45 AM, the Senate will vote on the nomination of James Blew to serve as Assistant Secretary for Planning, Evaluation, and Policy Development at the Education Department.
At this second hearing, I hope to learn from our witnesses specific recommendations on how to start investing more in preventive care and how to stop spending money on unnecessary medical tests, services, procedures, or medications.
We need to find ways to improve care and maximize the quality of the health care patients do receive by looking at what medical tests, services, procedures, or medications are really necessary or if there are more cost effective alternatives.
Unnecessary spending is a burden on the health care system and on the patients who undergo tests and procedures that may not be medically necessary ‚Äì and who are then stuck with the bill.
And second: The lack of preventive care, which results in spending money on health care services that could have been avoided if the patient had received care earlier.
Today, we will discuss two of these categories of wasteful spending: First, unnecessary spending, which does not actually help patients get better or was spent on unnecessary medical tests, services, procedures, or medications.
According to the @theNASEM in 2009 there was $750 billion in wasted health care spending, or as much as 30 percent of our total health care spending.
Our focus today is on reducing wasted health care spending, which is important given the estimated amount we spend on unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs, fraud, and other problems is a great, big number.
This is the second in a series of hearings to look at how to reduce health care costs, as they continue to increase for families, taxpayers, and employers.

Today we will take the first step toward reducing health care costs by understanding the cost of health care ‚Äì to taxpayers, employers, and individuals like Todd.
So, Todd was surprised when he received a bill for $1800 ‚Äì because even though the emergency room was ‚Äúin-network,‚Äù the doctor who treated his son was not.
That is what I heard from Todd, a Knoxville father, who recently took his son to an emergency room after a bicycle accident. His son was treated, Todd paid a $150 copay because the emergency room was ‚Äúin-network‚Äù for his health insurance, and they headed home.
The average American is shocked by the cost of their health care. They don‚Äôt understand what they are being charged for and why it costs so much, and they want better answers.
The most obvious fact about health care costs, other than that they‚Äôre too high, is that they are indecipherable. Any one of us who has received a hospital bill in the mail or has tried to figure out their health insurance benefits has wondered what it all means.
The first step to reducing health care costs is to better understand the cost of health care in America and understand why health care in America costs so much more than it does in other countries.
Warren Buffett has called the ballooning costs of health care‚Ä¶‚Äúa hungry tapeworm on the American economy.‚Äù
According to the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the @HHSGov, which is the health data office at HHS, we spent $2.2 trillion dollars on health care in 2006. This is projected to grow to $5.7 trillion in 2026 ‚Äì that is a 159 percent increase.
So today, we are beginning a series of hearings looking at how to reduce health care costs, including examining administrative costs, waste, how to improve transparency, private sector solutions, and other important issues as they come up.
But, the hard truth is that we will never get the cost of health insurance down until we get the cost of health care down.
For the last seven years, Republicans and Democrats have been locked in a debate over health insurance, primarily the individual insurance market, which is important but is where only six percent of insured Americans get their health insurance.

The PREEMIE Act was first signed into law by President Bush in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013. This law has helped give more babies the chance for long and healthy lives. It is important we pass this bill today so the full Senate can consider it before many of the programs expire.
We are also voting on Scott Stump as Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education at the @usedgov and John Lowry III to serve as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans‚Äô Employment and Training at the @USDOL.
Today we are considering the PREEMIE Act, sponsored by @SenBennet and myself, followed by three additional bills: Maternal Health Accountability Act, Sports Licensure Medical Clarity Act and the Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.

Sometimes the Senate has been like joining the Grand Old Opry and not being allowed to sing. But last week and tonight we have taken an appropriations process, which has been incomplete and broken for the last several years, and we have done what we are supposed to do.

This new rule simply says that the same protections that Democrats agreed work for roughly half of all Americans should work for small employers and the self-employed, too.
Association health plans would be required to comply with the same patient protections as plans at larger companies, including prohibitions against charging more or denying coverage because of a preexisting condition.
The rule will allow small businesses of similar trades or geographies to join together and offer insurance to their employees. For example, bakeries and small sporting-goods stores in Chattanooga, Tenn., could come together and purchase a plan for their employees.
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and the Trump administration have come up with a potential solution within existing law.
Today, if you‚Äôre a self-employed plumber or a farmer or a waitress at a small restaurant, you likely don‚Äôt have access to the same kind of lower-cost health insurance, tax breaks and patient protections that employees of bigger companies, such as IBM or Microsoft, enjoy.
READ: My op-ed in the Washington Post on a new rule from @POTUS and @SecretaryAcosta that will help self-employed Americans and more small businesses to band together to buy health insurance coverage through Association Health Plans. https://t.co/gSMeYhDFtX

Right now, @HRSAgov has clear authority to determine if hospitals, clinics, and drug companies are eligible to participate in the 340B Program. However, it is unclear if it has the statutory authority to oversee other aspects of the program.
Congress needs more accurate information to determine how to make the 340B Program work better for patients and hospitals. https://t.co/sFP0ks8DNA
I look forward to hearing from our witness with @HRSAgov today, and our other committee members about what Congress can do to evaluate the 340B Program, measure the program‚Äôs performance, and ensure that the agency responsible for the program is conducting proper oversight.
Data is necessary to demonstrate the value of the 340B Program, and Congress cannot evaluate the program, conduct oversight, or consider changes to improve the program without more information.
We learned at our two previous hearings on the program, there is no consistent data that shows how hospitals and clinics are spending the money they save through the 340B Program.
Some of the time, the 340B discount is passed directly to the patient as a lower priced drug. Other times, the hospital or clinic uses the savings to provide other services to patients like the programs Methodist, Saint Thomas, and Erlanger run.
They are all able to provide these services because of the money they save by participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which requires drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid to provide discounts on prescriptions drugs to qualifying hospitals and clinics.
And, Erlanger Health System in Chattanooga delivers prescription drugs at no cost to low-income patients at their homes, to ensure they are receiving and taking their medications.
Saint Thomas Health in Nashville operates four Dispensary of Hope pharmacy sites across the state of Tennessee, providing low-income, uninsured patients with free or low-cost prescription drugs.

These are a few of the proposals in the blueprint I am excited about, and I look forward to hearing from @SecAzar about others.
The blueprint also proposes ending the so-called ‚Äògag-rule‚Äô that prevents a pharmacist from telling a patient a drug would be cheaper if they paid out of pocket instead of with their insurance.
Another action @US_FDA is considering is requiring drug manufacturers to include the list price of a drug in television commercials or other advertising materials.
In President Trump‚Äôs blueprint, there are some steps the Administration has started to take or are intending to take. For example, @US_FDA is going to start going after bad actors gaming the system to delay generics from going to market.
According to the  @KaiserFamFound, about half of Americans ‚Äì that‚Äôs about 163 million people ‚Äì take a prescription drug. And about one in eight Americans say it is difficult to afford those prescriptions.
In May, President Trump announced a comprehensive blueprint to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. Today we are pleased to hear from @SecAzar to help us understand that blueprint and what the Administration plans to do to implement it and what legislation might be necessary.

Democrats are not at the table; they are hiding under the table. Insurance premiums are rising again because of a law that Democrats enacted, voted not to repeal and replace, and refuse to fix.
Democrats voted for the Hyde compromise more than 100 times in the Omnibus spending bill to which Republicans wanted to attach the 40 percent reduction in rates.
In March, Democrats used the excuse of not wanting to vote for the traditional Hyde compromise on regulating federal abortion spending that Democrats have voted for every year since 1976.
What I do not know how to do is to deal with Democrats who are unwilling to change a sentence in their Obamacare law even while a self-employed contractor making $60,000 might be paying $15,000 or $20,000 for health insurance.
I know how to be bipartisan and how to get results.
As chairman of the Senate‚Äôs health and education committee, I have worked with Democrats to solve big differences. We fixed No Child Left Behind, enacted 21st Century Cures, and unanimously approved legislation to combat the opioids epidemic.
In March, Democrats blocked a proposal that President Trump and Republicans offered to enact that experts at Oliver Wyman health consulting firm said would lower premiums by up to 40 percent over three years.
Rates in Tennessee have risen over 176 percent since every Democrat (and no Republican) voted for Obamacare in 2010. Last year, every Democrat voted against repealing and replacing Obamacare which would have given Americans more choices of insurance at lower cost.
Health insurance premiums are skyrocketing again and Democrats are scrambling to blame the increases on someone else. They should look in the mirror.

I want to thank @SenatorBurr, @SenBobCasey, @PattyMurray and all of their staff members for their hard work to ensure we are prepared for and able to respond to the next public health emergency.
It is important to reauthorize this legislation before it expires in September. My hope is we can approve the bill today so the whole Senate can quickly consider it.
.@SenatorBurr, who authored the original legislation in 2006 and led the first reauthorization effort in 2013, along with @SenBobCasey, have again worked hard on this bipartisan reauthorization.
.@SenAlexander: The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act authorizes programs that protect Americans from 21st century threats, including natural disasters, bioterror attacks, or infectious disease outbreaks, like a pandemic flu or Ebola.

We need to know if what the federal government currently is doing is effective or if specific improvements should be made. Do we need all of these programs, or should there be changes to better meet the needs of patients?
And finally, we spend about $310 million for the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan repayment for primary care doctors who go to work in under-served areas.  Most of these doctors choose to work at the 10,000 community health centers across the country.
Second, we spend over $1B on about 70 different health workforce programs that provide scholarships and loan repayment for students, faculty, and health care professionals in exchange for working in rural areas. All of these programs are within the HELP committee‚Äôs jurisdiction.
First, about $10 billion goes to Medicare Graduate Medical Education Programs, which funds resident training for new doctors. That program is in the jurisdiction of the Finance committee
The federal government is currently doing three things to help reduce and prevent shortages of health care workers.
The shortage affects certain populations more than others. In 2014, the @acognews reported that 47 rural Tennessee counties, out of 95 total, had no OB-GYN. That means a couple may have to travel to Memphis, Nashville or Knoxville to see an OB-GYN.
According to the @ruralhealth, there are only 39 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people living in rural areas, but there are 53 primary care doctors for every 100,000 people in urban areas.
We know that the shortage of health care professionals ‚Äì which includes doctors, nurses, paramedics, and x-ray technicians ‚Äì is a problem that has the potential to keep getting worse.
Today‚Äôs bipartisan hearing is an opportunity to learn about the growing shortage of health care professionals ‚Äì especially in rural areas ‚Äì and better understand where health care professionals are choosing to work so we can start addressing shortages across the country.

Last fall, our committee held 4 bipartisan hearings &amp; 4 roundtable discussions on these issues w/ more than half of the members of the United States Senate participating and I‚Äôve had many meetings with Democrat and Republican senators this year to discuss the proposal.
It has been my goal since September to include this proposal in the omnibus spending bill and that continues to be my goal.
I've been working since August in a bipartisan way to try to reduce skyrocketing insurance rates. We agree on broadly bipartisan policy that would give states more flexibility, and fund cost-sharing reduction subsidies as well as fund state reinsurance programs for three years.
Every year since 1976 Republicans and Democrats have agreed that federal dollars cannot be used to fund elective abortions, and our proposal does not change that.
It is disappointing that an opportunity to lower health insurance rates by up to 40 percent for working Americans has turned into a debate about the mechanics of funding for abortion coverage.

Earlier this week, an analysis by consulting firm Oliver Wyman projected that passage of our proposal could result in 40% lower premiums than what people in the individual market would pay if Congress doesn‚Äôt act. Read more on the study here: https://t.co/uJ72hjbXwp
The projected reduction in premiums assumes that in 2020 and 2021 states take advantage of our proposal‚Äôs Section 1332 waiver flexibility to create reinsurance programs and invisible high risk pools.
CBO‚Äôs preliminary feedback is that this proposal could reduce premiums by an average of 10 percent in 2019 and by 20 percent in 2020 and 2021 compared to current premium projections.

Hopefully we can sign this bill into law ‚Äì that will allow us to go to work on the maintenance backlog ‚Äì by the end of the year.
The Smokies is full of wonderful volunteers like the 2,800 who worked on the Rainbow Falls Trail last year.  But we must do more to get funding to our parks to help address these maintenance needs and support volunteers.
In August, I visited the Smokies with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and saw firsthand the work that is needed on the trails. We hiked the Rainbow Falls Trail where a two-year project is currently underway to rehabilitate the trail.
For the Smokies alone, between Tennessee and North Carolina, there is a $215 million backlog of projects.

According to an independent study, when President Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002, it raised consumer prices and ‚Äò[m]ore American workers lost their jobs in 2002 to higher steel prices than the total number employed by the U.S. steel industry itself.‚Äô
Targeted measures against countries that don‚Äôt play by the rules, such as China, could help American workers. Broad tariffs against steel and aluminum imports will raise prices on consumers and hurt American workers.

As we consider new legislation, I want to hear specific suggestions about how the federal government can help states and local communities take full advantage of the amazing potential that technology has to offer in solving the opioid crisis.
When we look at what the federal government can do, sharing more data and utilizing new technologies may be the most helpful thing that we do.
As we‚Äôve examined this crisis over the last five months, we‚Äôve learned that strong local communities are key to finding solutions and Washington‚Äôs role is to support those efforts.
Today we are looking at the role data and technology can play in combating the opioid crisis.

I‚Äôm glad the Senate confirmed David Jolley to serve as the U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of TN. He will serve East Tennesseans with integrity.
This resolution seeks to recognize their sacrifice &amp; contributions to the civil rights movement.
On Tuesday, I introduced a Senate resolution ‚Äì along with United States Senators @SenBobCorker, @DougJones , and @SenatorCardin ‚Äì that recognizes the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Memphis sanitation workers strike.
Four days later, on April 8, 1968, 42,000 people marched in Memphis, and on April 16, the strike was resolved. The 1,300 sanitation workers in Memphis took a stand for freedom, and they displayed a great deal of courage in pursuit of equality.
His speech included the lines ‚ÄúI've been to the mountain top,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the Promised Land.‚Äù The next day, Dr. King was assassinated on the Lorraine Motel balcony.
On April 3, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. addressed a rally of 10,000 African-American workers and residents, members of the clergy, and union members at Mason Temple, the Memphis headquarters of the Church of God in Christ.
Their deaths galvanized the 1,300 African-American sanitation workers who decided to begin their strike to protest working conditions on February 12, 1968. The workers demanded recognition of their union, increased pay, and safer working conditions.
In Jan. 1968, workers began negotiating with Memphis Mayor Henry Loeb and the Memphis City Council to improve pay and working conditions. On Feb. 1, 1968, two sanitation workers sought shelter from the rain &amp; were crushed to death in their garbage truck when it malfunctioned.

We know that the human medical products we use are safe because the FDA has approved them ‚Äì and the way that farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians know drugs for animals are safe is the same ‚Äì the FDA has approved them.
Farmers and families in Tennessee want to have access to the drugs that keep their animals and pets healthy.

While that was a lot of numbers, they represent real families and children whose lives are being affected by the opioid crisis.
This is a problem seen nationwide as well ‚Äì after steadily declining since 2000, there‚Äôs been a 10% increase in the number of children in foster care in the last 3 years. In some places, the numbers have even tripled in the same time period.
This crisis affects more than just infants ‚Äìmany grandparents &amp; relatives have taken on the role of caregiver for children whose parents are addicted. In TN, between 2010 and 2014, there was a 51% increase in the number of parents who lost parental rights b/c of opioid addiction.
According to the CDC, the number of infants born in withdrawal from opioids has tripled from 1999 to 2013, &amp; according to Dr. Stephen Patrick from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Tennessee‚Äôs rate of babies born in drug withdrawal is about three times the national average. https://t.co/smwsad2zn6

The opioid crisis is particularly heartbreaking for families and children. No one understands that more than Jessie, an East Tennessee woman who lost a baby during the nearly two decades she struggled with an addiction to opioids and other substances.

To be clear ‚Äì we want to ensure students are getting a quality education and that they are not borrowing more than they can afford to pay back to the taxpayers who are making the loan.
I did not agree with making the federal government the bank for student loans, but now that we are the bank, we must do what a bank does, which is protect its shareholders. In this case, the shareholder is the American taxpayer.
Since the last bipartisan reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the federal government has become the provider of all loans for students.
I believe Congress should consider new accountability measures that are more effective at holding all individual programs at all colleges and universities accountable for the ability of their students to pay back their loans.
An important part of that accountability is to find ways to make sure students are not borrowing more money than they will be able to pay back. Today, when students don't make payments on their loans, colleges are held somewhat accountable under the current measure.
Today we are looking at another important focus of our reauthorization of the Higher Education Act: Accountability ‚Äì whether students are earning degrees worth their time and money.

As we continue to work on reauthorizing the Higher Education Act, I hope we can work together in a bipartisan way to make it clearer to students what grants they are eligible for, how much they are able to borrow and provide simpler and manageable ways to repay their loans.
Today‚Äôs hearing is to see if we can reach a result on simplifying the complicated system of grants, loans and repayment plans to ensure the financial aid system isn‚Äôt a barrier to college.
We consistently hear from students, parents, and administrators that students looking for federal financial aid to go to college need a much simpler system for the $30 billion in grants, roughly $100 billion in new loans, and the repayment plans for those loans.
These hearings have produced a large number of proposals, mostly bipartisan, ranging from simplifying student aid to improving the accreditation system. It is now time to bring our process to a conclusion and present our recommendations to the full Senate for action.

We are eager to hear your testimony and your solutions.
And, second, if stronger communities are the ultimate solution to this crisis, as you suggest often in your book, what can a central government in Washington do that actually helps?
First, when 100 million Americans live with pain, 25 million of them with chronic or severe pain, is finding the so-called holy grail of medicine, a non-addictive pain medicine, not the obvious antidote to the opioid epidemic?
Rather than spend more time establishing the crisis, I want to focus today on what we do about it. Here are two things I am hoping to learn from you:
The governor told me that in our state of 6.6 million people, there were 7.6 million opioid prescriptions written in 2016.
Yesterday I dropped by a meeting at the Tennessee Governor‚Äôs Residence in Nashville. The heads of all our state‚Äôs institutions involved in training doctors were planning how to discourage the over-prescription of opioids.
This epidemic kills more Americans every day than car accidents. In each of our states we are reminded almost every day of the crisis.
The challenge this crisis presents has captured the attention of every member of this committee. Your research and writing have been acclaimed for their depth and breadth.
Mr. Quinones, it is unusual to have a single witness at our hearings. But this is an unusual topic, one you quote Washington State research professor Gary Franklin as calling the ‚Äúworst man-made epidemic in history.‚Äù

As HHS Secretary, there are other steps you can take to lower premiums and stabilize the market, such as approving states‚Äô innovation waivers, which could increase access to lower cost plans and incentivize younger and healthier individuals to purchase insurance.
Alexander-Murray has so much in it that it appeals to so many Democrats and Independents that it is hard to imagine not passing something that prevents a 25 percent increase in premiums by 2020 and offers states flexibility to further lower rates.

Mr. Azar, if confirmed to lead the Dept. of HHS, you will be running a $1.11 trillion organization, which almost equals the total of the 12 Appropriations bills that Congress passes each year to fund everything from national parks to national defense to national laboratories.
Today‚Äôs hearing is on Alex Azar, the nominee to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
We want to make sure we do whatever we can to make sure it never happens again.
The response was almost as incredible as the fire itself, and the overwhelming impression that I get from the community is how tough and resilient they are. A lot of heartbreak came out of the wildfires: deaths and destruction, but, today, everybody is focused on the future.
It‚Äôs been a year since the devastating wildfires swept across Gatlinburg and Sevier County ‚Äì a heartbreaking story for all of us who know and love the Great Smoky Mountains and the people who live there.
I was encouraged when the president told Republican senators today that he supports the Alexander-Murray bill &amp; the Collins-Nelson reinsurance proposal‚Äîboth of which will reduce health insurance premiums. With his support, both proposals should become law by the end of the year.
As I‚Äôve said time and again, I am committed to seeing ESSA implemented as it was written. I believe Secretary DeVos is doing just that‚Äîfollowing the law in approval of state plans while encouraging states to use maximum flexibility afforded to them.
25 years after the first #FAFSA and four years after the first hearing, it is time to bring this discussion to a result.
Our proposal will also tell students the amount of their Pell Grant, money they do not have to pay back, before they apply to colleges instead of after they have already been accepted to schools.
Senator Bennet and I are now completing work on a bill that would reduce the #FAFSA to as few as 15 and no more than 25 questions, depending on how you answer questions about your family.
My central focus will be to make it simpler &amp; easier for students to apply for federal aid and to pay their loans back, &amp; to cut through the jungle of red tape that federal law and regulations imposes so college administrations can spend their time and money instead for students.
Third, this complexity wastes time and money that could be better spent helping students choose the right college or major, or develop financial literacy skills so they can understand the impacts of taking out student loans.
I know in Tennessee, where two years of post-secondary education is now free, the complexity of the #FAFSA is the single biggest impediment to more students taking advantage of Tennessee Promise.
Second, this complexity frustrates the goal of the Pell Grant, which is to help low-income students attend college, because it discourages them from applying for aid.
First, nearly 20 million students fill out this form every year. This means if you receive a federal grant or a loan as a freshman, you have to fill it out again to continue to receive aid for your sophomore year and beyond.
Let‚Äôs take a moment to talk about why simplifying this form is important:
If there is that much consensus on how to make it easier for nearly 20 million families to apply for federal aid, we asked, why don‚Äôt we actually do it?
Nearly four years ago, at a hearing before this committee, an unusual thing happened: four witnesses from diverse backgrounds agreed that almost all of the 108 questions on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or the #FAFSA, are unnecessary.

I look forward to hearing how community level partnerships and engagement can lead to healthier individuals, higher quality health care, and lower health care costs.
Dr. Adam‚Äôs motto as Surgeon General is ‚Äúbetter health through better partnerships,‚Äù and I hope this committee can be one partner going forward.
This is important because the United States spends about $2.6 trillion treating chronic diseases. This accounts for more than 84 percent of our health care costs.
It makes sense for that to be his focus, because there is a remarkable consensus that wellness ‚Äì lifestyle changes like eating healthier and quitting smoking ‚Äì can prevent serious illness and reduce health care costs.
At his confirmation hearing, he said, ‚ÄúI would also make wellness and community and employer engagement a centerpiece of my agenda if confirmed‚Ä¶ Our health starts in the communities where we live, learn, work, play, and go to school.‚Äù
When Dr. Adams and I met before his confirmation hearing, I said to him that if, as Surgeon General, he threw himself at one important problem, he could have a real impact on the lives of millions of Americans.
Today, we are holding a hearing with the Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, to hear his priorities on how to encourage people to lead healthier lives.

The sooner we pass this legislation, the better‚Äîto give patients, doctors, FDA reviewers, and companies certainty.
A delay in reauthorizing these agreements would delay the reviews of drugs and devices submitted after April 1
If we do not move to pass these agreements in late July, the FDA will be forced to send layoff notices to more than 5,000 FDA employees
The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me &amp; Senator Murray, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements that expire at the end of September
The FDA is the agency responsible for making sure the promise of the 21st Century Cures Act actually reaches America‚Äôs patients
Now the next step ... is to fund the Food and Drug Administration.
21st Century Cures became law last year and provided $4.8 billion for medical research, on top of the support Congress already provides
This was legislation to spur research and development of cures, devices and treatments for some of the most deadly illnesses and diseases
Just five months back , 94 members of this body voted for a bill called the 21st Century Cures Act.

FDA will be forced to begin sending layoff notices to more than 5,000 employees
Here is the problem with missing the goal of having this to the President‚Äôs desk before August recess:
We need to make sure we can get user fee reauthorization done by Aug recess‚Äîmeaning we need to report this legislation to Senate floor today
The FDA Reauthorization Act, sponsored by me &amp; Senator Murray, reauthorizes the four user fee agreements that expire at the end of September
We have followed the same sort of bipartisan process on how we continue funding the FDA
The year before that, we worked in a bipartisan way to fix No Child Left Behind.
We ended last year passing the 21st Century Cures Act, which Leader McConnell called ‚Äúthe most important piece of legislation‚Äù that year.

We may soon have a situation where no insurance company is willing to sell insurance on an #Obamacare exchange
If the #Obamacare policyholder isn‚Äôt paying the higher premiums in the exchange, then you, the taxpayer, will...
The bill I am introducing will not fix #Obamacare. It is not a permanent solution. We still must repeal &amp; replace the law.
A growing number of states--including #TN--that have multiple insurers have only one insurer selling policies in a majority of counties
People buying on #Obamacare exchanges will have only 1 insurer to choose from in the entire state in 5 states next year: AL, AK, OK, SC, WY
2: Waive #Obamacare requirement that you buy a specific health care plan or pay a fine of as much as $2,000 for a family of four next year
1: States w failing #Obamacare exchange could allow residents to purchase any health plan, even those off the exchange, for 2017
This legislation will do 2 things for the nearly 11 million Americans who buy health insurance on the #Obamacare exchanges
You may be eligible for an #Obamacare subsidy..but there‚Äôs also a good chance the insurance you currently have may be gone by November,
It takes a certain amount of creativity for Senate Dems to come to the floor and complain about #Zika funding--THEY refused the vote.

Dems want to spend more taxpayer $ to prop up the exchanges and they want to expand the role of gov't in your private health care decisions
But if there is a Democrat in the White House, broad systemic, structural changes to #Obamacare will still be necessary
If there‚Äôs a Republican in the White House next year, we need to repeal #Obamacare and replace it with step-by-step reforms
Politico reports that one Arizona county [Pinal] is ‚Äúpoised to become an Obamacare ghost town" #Obamacare
A similar picture in North Carolina, West Virginia, Utah, South Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, and Florida. #Obamacare
For the 2017 plan year, it is estimated that 60% of Tennessee‚Äôs counties will have only one insurer offering #Obamacare plans.
According to Avalere Health, Americans buying insurance in 1/3 of #Obamacare exchange regions next yr may have only 1 insurer to choose from
Next year, Tennesseans will pay an intolerable increase‚Äîon average b/w 44 &amp; 62% more for their #Obamacare plans than they paid last year.
This Nov., when Tennesseans sign up for 2017 #Obamacare plans, there will be fewer plans to choose from &amp; they‚Äôll be much more expensive.
This might be what Repubs predicted‚Äîbut it‚Äôs happening even faster than we imagined‚Äîand no one is happy about being right. #obamacare
