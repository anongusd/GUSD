#CountOnLibraries: @NYLA_XD adds: "This is something to embrace and it's also a strong opportunity to connect with your state associations and chapters, who can identify and ask for the resources that are available." #alamw19
#CountOnLibraries: Michelle Perera's advice: "Get involved. This is our opportunity to show how community involved we are." Meredith Higashi agrees and adds: "Build on existing partnerships in your communities." #alamw19
#CountOnLibraries: Michelle Perera shares the purpose of Complete Count Committees. "It's a group of key players in the community who can spread the word for you and be your eyes and ears and feet on the ground. Libraries can be helpful as the convener." #alamw19
#CountOnLibraries: @NYLA_XD compares @ALALibrary's efforts around 2020 Census awareness to tax season. "The Taskforce wants librarians to be prepared!" #alamw19
