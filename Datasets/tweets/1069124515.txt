Yesterday, Democrats passed H.R. 8. Today, they passed H.R. 1112. Both claim to make Americans safer from gun violence, but in reality, both only infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens.

We cannot allow California‚Äôs radical gun laws to be imposed upon all Americans.
None of the major shootings recently in this country would have been prevented by these laws. This legislation is a farce that would only make life more difficult for honest Americans and jeopardize their safety ‚Äì while not so much as inconveniencing real criminals.
By definition, criminals do not comply with the law. So what makes my Democrat colleagues think tightening background checks on law-abiding Americans will decrease gun violence? Criminals get their guns from the black market, the so-called dark web, or by other illicit means.
Today, I opposed H.R. 8, which was a partisan bill that would infringe upon our #SecondAmendment rights as Americans.

#ICYMI: The President declared a National Emergency at the southern border. I spoke with @KRCR7 over the weekend to reassure wildfire victims that money for the border wall will not be taken from wildfire relief funds. https://t.co/0qSxgBqYg0
(4/4) The situation at the southern border is a humanitarian and national security crisis, and it‚Äôs a national emergency. The stubborn opposition to a regulated border is incomprehensible and endangers American citizens.
(3/4) I‚Äôve been working with the White House to ensure funding for disaster recovery and critical civil works projects, such as levees and water storage, are not affected by a shift in funding in this process.
(2/4) This decision is not without precedent ‚Äì there have been nearly 60 national emergencies declared by U.S. Presidents since 1976. Similarly, previous governors of New Mexico and Arizona have also declared states of emergency along the border in the past.
(1/4) I support the President‚Äôs decision today to use the powers of the Executive to secure our southern border. I would have preferred to accomplish this legislatively, but the intractability of Democrat leadership to adequately address this issue has made that impossible.

Their unwillingness to negotiate speaks volumes about their priorities to defy a President &amp; the overwhelming number of Americans that want solutions, not gridlock.
In San Diego, illegal traffic has dropped 92% since a barrier was built in 1992. Democrats do have some history of supporting physical barriers at the southern border. What has changed? They seem only to oppose it now to impede this President.
The status quo is dangerous and is inflicting harm on real people and real families. Walls work ‚Äì in sections of the southern border where a physical barrier is already present, we‚Äôve seen a marked decrease in illegal immigration.

I hope that we can get to work finding a solution to reopen those closed portions of the government that includes important disaster funding and border security which is desperately needed. Unfortunately, the bill today lacks both.
It has been clear for weeks that in order for a funding bill to pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the President it will need to be a compromise. The Senate has said they won‚Äôt consider this bill and the President has said he would veto this bill.
The funding bill passed by Democrats tonight wasn‚Äôt a serious attempt to reopen the government, but the beginning of a stunt that takes time away from finding a solution.
(4/4) I‚Äôm optimistic that the House, Senate, and the President can all work together to further legislation that will meaningfully benefit the American people, and I‚Äôll ensure the North State‚Äôs voice is heard loud and clear. Now, it‚Äôs time to get to work.

#WOTUS was nothing short of a job-killing Washington power grab, and I‚Äôm glad to see it replaced with something that works.
Now, those driving our economy will spend less time &amp; money on land-use decisions &amp; litigation &amp; more time running their business. States will finally have a clear definition of where federal jurisdiction ends &amp; begins, as well as the ability to properly manage their own water.
Instead of attempting to needlessly regulate every puddle, ditch, and furrow in America, the new rule will focus on bodies of water and wetlands that are physically and meaningfully connected to other bodies of jurisdictional water.
After listening to those directly impacted by one of the previous Administration‚Äôs most harmful rules, the @EPA is replacing #WOTUS with something that actually makes sense for land and business owners.

I‚Äôm encouraged by this latest tool announced today by USDA that will help more of our communities access the information they need about different resources and funding opportunities available to combat this opioid epidemic on the local level.
We‚Äôve passed dozens of bills into law that are designed to combat this epidemic. I've also introduced legislation to make USDA resources more accessible to rural communities for this very reason, while ensuring coordination among different agencies to avoid duplicative efforts.
The #opioidcrisis is a very real threat to rural communities across America - more than 300,000 have died from opioid-related overdoses since 2000. That's why Congress has worked with the Admin to take unprecedented steps to curb opioid abuse in America. https://t.co/HQLOakvYYm

As a whole, this new law advances treatment and recovery programs in our communities, helps get illegal synthetic drugs like fentanyl off the streets, and improves our ability to prevent #opioid addiction from happening in the first place.
Thank you to @POTUS for signing into law H.R. 6, the Patients and Communities Act. This bipartisan legislation overwhelmingly passed the House and Senate earlier this year and contains numerous bills designed to combat the growing #opioid crisis in our country. https://t.co/BGSafvAggr

Unemployment and GDP numbers show the real focus should be on economy and jobs. Govt needs to get out of the way
It‚Äôs no surprise that economy shrank when Washington spent entire month of December arguing over how much more to take from us.
Glad to see the Senate Pass #nobudgetnopay Maybe they can pass a budget now, something they haven't done in 4 yrs.
The President has disbanded his jobs Council after not meeting with them for a year. It's time to focus on the Economy not ignore it.
@mwestonmercury thanks Mary!
To fix budget/ debt need to reduce spending AND grow economy- that means more Jobs + better opportunity for all.
Carbon tax is a sure way to hurt the economy and move clean industry from usa to foreign countries where less restrictions. #nocarbontax
