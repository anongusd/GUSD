@blackrepublican @CooperDaves One of the groups of the activists told the African American boy in the group that his classmates would one day harvest his internal organs. The look of incredulity and defiance on the boy's face, which was there for only a moment, is understandable.
@blackrepublican @CooperDaves They were engaged by two groups of adults who were clearly activists who clearly objected to the boys' attire. I heard several times during the video where is the bus? When are they going to get here? You can even see where the boys walked away from the two groups for a while.
@blackrepublican @CooperDaves I would have done the same thing if a group had approached me in that manner. I would not have moved. There would have been no reason for me to move. No one asked, no one said excuse me, no one engaged in dialogue. The kids were waiting on their bus.
@blackrepublican @CooperDaves The activists with microphones cameras and a drum walk up to the group of boys not saying much but telling them that they don't belong there things like that and banging a drum at them. The boy that didn't move could have moved but I don't fault him for it.
@blackrepublican @CooperDaves The video has been taken down since. Not sure if I can find it again. Mostly the first comment you hear is where the buses and you see a group of Native American activists separate away from the group a boys.
@blackrepublican @CooperDaves Looks like I missed a lot of activity over the past few hours! The clip that led me to the conclusion that they were mostly kids that were just in over their heads who handled the situation without finesse was a clip taken by someone in the back of their group.

@BillyBlue37 @JohnMaintenanc1 @JerryDunleavy It was a beautiful day. The weather was perfect.
@JerryDunleavy We prayed and talked and decided how we would tell the children. We watched the cleanup for days. There was literally nothing we could do but pray and participate in relief drives. So we did. I will never forget. /4
@JerryDunleavy The Pentagon, a plane crashed somewhere, and air traffic was grounded. The towers fell. My oldest son came out of his room. I turned off the television, numb, and we went back to schooling. I was finally able to get through to my parents that afternoon, then my husband. /3
@JerryDunleavy I tried calling my husband, then my parents, but the cell phone signals were jammed. I sent the kids to their rooms to read and I watched the events unfold, standing first motionless, then on my knees, watching as the 2nd plane hit, realizing we were under attack. /2
@JerryDunleavy I had awakened very early that morning. I'll never forget it. By 8 a.m. my husband had left for his 2 hour drive to seminary and I was homeschooling our children. I turned TV on to catch up on the news. The 1st plane had just hit the tower and they were reporting an explosion. /1
