To add one more note.  Even when tax revenue finally increased. (Not due to the tax cuts) Government funding to state schools has not recovered to their pre recession level.
When tax revenue didn‚Äôt magically appear our largely Republican leaders didn‚Äôt rescind the tax cuts they just passed a tax increase on the middle class in the form of student loans. Thank you for listening to my #TedTalk
In summary, we cut funding to state schools to give tax cuts. It was supposed to generate more tax revenue.
This happened at State Legislatures across the country especially during the recession. Universities to make up for the lack of public funding raised tution knowing that students and families would take out loans to cover the cost.
1. To answer your question it went to tax cuts for the corporations and individuals that were supposed to create more taxes and then be collected and reinvested back into schools. Except it did not ‚Äútrickle down‚Äù. https://t.co/pw2OvYxKBF

With less than 24hrs notice the Phoenix City Council will take a vote that could kill light rail. Years of planning and an initiative go out the window with out Phoenix residents knowing that this is a possibility.
To be clear a 30 delay for light rail is a vote for the Koch brothers. This was voted on by Phoenix citizens with a majority Republican electorate and passed overwhelmingly. Koch brothers can't win at ballot box so now they are using the Phoenix city council.
Why is the Phoenix City Council rushing to kill light rail? Where is the public notice? A 30day delay kills light rail. Not enough notice has been given to Phoenix residents for a project voted in by initiative.
There is a rushed vote at the Phoenix city council tonight that will kill light rail into South Phoenix. A 30day delay is a backdoor to kill light rail for the Koch brothers. Call all the Dems on the City Council and demand no delay. https://t.co/ZStH1Bx0Xx

A semi auto hunting rifle without the right grip, cooling fins is less dangerous than an AR.
These "cosmetics" are essential to making a killing machine. For example a gun grip is essential to keeping the weapon in place as you fire many rounds. The black fins on the rifle are designed for cooling the barrel as you fire.

4. So this hunting argument is bogus. If you don't want a ban, just say it. Hunters will be able to hunt with an assault weapons ban. If you have a current AR15 you can continue to use it anyway. Hunting is important but it does not supersede the right to keeps kids safe.
3. It doesn't matter what you are hunting boar, javelina, deer if a ban happens there will be weapons that will be redesigned by gun makers for your particular game.
2. You can hunt with out an AR15.  Many people did it before the invention of the AR15. Many people did it when the assault weapons ban was in place.
1. It is amazing to hear so many hunters suddenly come out and testify for the AR15 as a hunting rifle.

For further thought. We regulate dozens of different types of cars and other commercial products. We can easily pass regulations to separate semi auto hunting rifles from weapons designed to kill humans.
It is a false comparison between an AR15 and a Ruger. Trying to shoot the Ruger as fast as an AR15 would kill your shoulder and not allow you to properly site in on a target. @NRA activist try to confuse everyone so we dont regulate any weapon. https://t.co/93aFMzgIxG

Not to mention the difficulty of shooting accurately while on the move with a bolt action rifle. AR15 allows you to move and shoot with ease and less reloads. Easier when chasing a target. (Human, sorry it's true).
If @marcorubio wants to kiss ass to the @NRA he should just be honest and say he doesn't want to ban the AR15 because he is afraid of the NRA. Not use lame excuses.
The combination of all those elements make the AR15 a killing machine for humans. Your typical hunting rifle is not.
Plus the magazine capacity of an AR 15 is much bigger than a hunting rifle which is usually around 3 or 4 rounds.
Add the 5.56 round which tumbles upon impact with soft tissue causing wide spread internal damage that makes surviving difficult. Most hunting rifles do not use that type of bullet.
So wrong. Cyclical rate of fire on an AR15 is much faster than a typical bolt action hunting rifle. https://t.co/PtVIAFTgBL

10. Only Generals being involved in the Afghan strategy should worry you. Because the solution no matter what the question was more troops.
9. And understand that war isn't just shooting. It is a multi dimensional problem that is rarely solved by just military means.
8. How easy or hard they are to get, depending on rank and service. How political the promotion process is for Generals.
7. Lastly, this is also the medias fault. They need to stop being awed by shiny things on chests and ribbons. Learn what the ribbons mean
6. BTW the officers that were the problem. Kept their rank and pay. Instead of being sent to Leavenworth.
5. Though the Vehicles were there , the Pentagon couldn't fix themselves.
4. Look at Gen. Flynn or meet the thousands of Men and Women that died because the genius generals couldn't get IED resistant vehicles even
3. These Generals are human, they have human faults and weaknesses and guess what some are also dumb and incompetent.
2. The public and politicians are quick to give too much credit to anyone with a star or stars on their shoulder. As if their word is gold.
The Afghan strategy was created by Generals. This is a big problem. They view the world as full of nails and the only tool is a  hammer. 1.
But with more bellicose words!!! https://t.co/kx5ESeOZoE
