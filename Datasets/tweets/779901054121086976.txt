@hheatherrae @11AliveNews That's the job of the NWS
@ChuckGrassley, #Kavanaugh, and @senjudiciary must have forgotten that #SNLPremiere is this weekend.  #KavanaughHearings #SNL
Anybody know why @wolfblitzer keeps asking for urinalysis? Did they finally find the @realDonaldTrump tapes? #cnn
RT @Ocasio2018: “But how are we going to pay for the Space Force?”		Oh wait sorry - we only ask that when it comes to healthcare, education…
Oh I forgot @BrianKempGA we live in a world where you can get away with chastising someone for not paying taxes.  Who endorsed you? Gosh... I forget. 		"Oh, that's what his doctor said when I asked where Kemp's spine left to." 		#putin4georgia https://t.co/Bq2wsjueQM
I ask you sir, why was your coach so focused on winning the governor's seat right after winning a state championship? #syntax https://t.co/rQ65zwngG2
Don't worry about putting in any work to get him elected, he runs the polls and... oops!  Did he drop the polls off a cliff?  Yes.  But it's all good!  @BrianKempGA When OOPS is good enough.  #OOPS This tweet brought to you by #putin4georgia https://t.co/4OaAgLUBtf
@CaseyCagle @juliojones_11 As Governor, I'd hope you wouldn't use humor to blur the lines of executive privilege, seeing as we have a problem with that already.
@marcorubio Do something about it.  Get rid of Sinclair.  Bring back net neutrality.
@CoryBooker Good luck.  You're gonna need something more procedural.
RT @ManInTheHoody: first they came for the muslims and i did nothing		then they came for the mexicans and i did nothing		then they came for…
@RepTomSuozzi Just say congressmen next time.
@WestWingWeekly "Play the tape through to the end, Leo." That's an old saying from Alcoholics Anonymous. "Gonna drink? How's that gonna go?"
RT @JohnKasich: The media needs to be held accountable. At the same time, we all have a responsibility to read news outside our comfort zon…
Today's @CNN breaking news is yesterday's @StephenAtHome monologue. Let's redefine breaking news, eh? #LSSC #Comey #cnn #latenews
@CNN  pulling a @realDonaldTrump , valuing insight from ex #kgb. Thank god the American media consumers are wicked smart. #whatcouldgowrong
@mike_pence isn't in the chain of command, he can't forgive minor transgressions of #USNA #Midshipmen. Oh my god it's begun. #Commencement
@dccc has it figured out... if you gotta run a negative ad, cite your assertions, and cite 'em w/ reliable sources. #associatedpress #ajc
@MattPSapp Yes.
Everybody knows #Atlanta is a democratic island in the south. They shoulda held the #dncdebate in #Huntsville.
@PeteButtigieg is stumping again. Not showing #DNCChair skills. Some sort od federal office? #stumpinggrounds
I'm voting for that Alan Alda guy to read bills and SCOTUS opinions to me. #dncdebate
@TomPerez needs to write the platform with #sallyboyntonbrown
Undecided but leaning towards the establishment. Oh really. #dncdebate
I like everyone competing for most humble. #dncdebate
Wow, watch folks get uncomfortable real fast. Mention candidates using money at #dncdebate
Stumpy stump stump
@PeteButtigieg isn't running for DNC chair. Something else
@keithellison knows industry having seen the decline of fur coat factories and wheat breweries in the heartland of #Minnesota
The job of @PeteButtigieg as mayor of #SouthBend is to not screw up things for #notredame. Pretty sure he is in touch with millenials
The @WhiteHouse Roosevelt Room looks a lot like The Apprentice set.
@realDonaldTrump The builders did do a good job making the thing, the curators curating. The blacks looked good on the walls. Nice cafe! https://t.co/cyDGcrzLae
@hillhulse @AliABCNews Thank god they didnt. 4 years is a lot shorter than a lifetime.
Why @mike_pence is doing anything other than studying is beyond me. #SuperBowl #blairhousearrest
"I am so behind you" @realDonaldTrump said to the CIA. "So are we, technically" said the fallen CIA patriots he was upstaging. Trump's CIA
Reports: #JamesComey books two week @CarnivalCruise to tour island real estate opportunities.
Now this is the America I love. The poor don't deserve clean water. True children of God would filter it with their faith. #gop #flint
@SenWarren CSPAN is one of the only unbiased sources of news and information we have. We need to preserve public access to it. https://t.co/YaRzCyapEQ
@chrislhayes @cspan  is the only unbiased thing we have left, and we need to preserve puclic access to it. https://t.co/YaRzCyapEQ
@marcmaron I feel as if I've created a reasonable person's petition. I hope you'll take a look at it and maybe sign on. Boomer lives. https://t.co/YaRzCyapEQ
@alfranken Sign this petition like the normal citizen you are! You can! You're good enough, you're smart enough, well doggonit ppl like you! https://t.co/YaRzCyapEQ
Remove CSPAN's Paywall. Its the right of all citizens to have free access to watch our government at work. https://t.co/Anh77m9TMC @moveon
#TheLastThingINeedIs Healthcare from the government. One of my three employers will spring for it. Right? Rigghht??
Luckily there's never been any violence b/w India and Pakistan, or China and #Taiwan. Cuz if there was, this would really be stupid! https://t.co/PHXdZOyWD3
I hope the Mich AG prevails. Democracy is long gone. Let this see saw ride fling me into the puke filled sandbox of absolutism. #Recount2016
This as an opportunity to invite other heads of state to design public buildings for our cities. #TrumpTalksToHeadsOfState
@OwenBenjamin Haven't listened yet, but I'm amused you think we're representative of the deep south. I feel like we're on a liberal island.
Time to go to bed. Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow I'll remember the last 16 years. Otherwise my job is going to be hard. #cspan #2000s
Nice to see no one's updated the decor. #cspan #un
Turkey's catching crap for its relations to the West. Give me a break. That's no news. #cspan #turkey #un
Whoa. Syria sounds like it's in real trouble. Hopefully the rest of the middle east is still good. #cspan #un #syria
What's happened since 2000? Why is this Syrian guy being featured? Aleppo is such a beautiful city. #UN
Whoa. It's 2016. What happened? #cspan #un #syria
Oh crap I turned my head. I wonder if the candidates kissed their wives? They'd better, especially Bush. #cspan #bushvgore #tongueincheek
Thank god we'll always have anchors like Jim Lehrer to keep us as a nation grounded. #cspan #pbs #lehrer #bushvgore #hope #1st amendment
Oh god @AlGore. Don't fucking end on a poodle note!!! You might accidentally piss off some old ladies in florida. #cspan #bushvgore #algore
Sometimes I think an invisible person occassionallg pulls one of @algore hairs. #cspan #bushvgore #alsnore
God I hope no one votes for a guy they just want to have a beer with. Luckily America's smarter than that. #cspan #bushvgore #georgewbush
You know, that Governor from war torn Texas sure makes me feel safe, and prepared for global instabilities. #cspan #bushvgore #georgewbush
The government definitely shouldn't provide campaign finance. I want my mom and pop stores to support their local leaders. #cspan #bushvgore
Bush really doesn't seem to like Gore. Too bad he doesn't have a TV station to do that for him. #cspan #bushvgore #morepropoganda
#McCainFeingold. That's such an easy sell, no way anybody will ever undo that law. #cspan #bushvgore #campaignfinance @russfeingold #mccain
We need a cultural change for sure. All kids are doing these days is playing their #N64 and not honoring their elders. #cspan #bushvgore
I'll bet Truman stopped a lot of buck in his day. #cspan #potus #bushvgore #harrytruman
Bill Clinton used to give Monica Lewinsky the paddle with that old "buck stops here" placard. #cspan #familyvalues #bushvgore
Jim lehrer is such a buzzkill, so glad @algore stopped him. #cspan #bushvgore #algore
It'd really hard to patronize someone onstage about tax policy. Mr. Vice President, you've lost the audience. #cspan #bushvgore #alsnore
God I bet this #lockbox stuff is gonna be all over SNL next week. Ugh. #cspan #bushvgore #snl #willferrell #darrelhammond
Gore really needs to stop laughing at Lil Georgie. He's gonna lose in a landslide, give him a break! #cspan #bushvgore
Gore really has spent his Vice President cutting government waste. #cspan #bushvgore #vpitus #algore
Gore said Bush believes dollars are 1/6th corporate. Sounds a bit low. #cspan #bushvgore #thegreatcompromisepart2
"We need to do more and better." Shhh!!!! That's what they hate!!! #cspan #bushvgore #algore
Governor Bush said he's good with catastrophic floods. Maybe I'll vote for him. Global warming and all. #cspan #bushvgore #georgewbush
Gore has problems keeping his mouth going through consonants. #cspan #bushvgore #algore
Oh, ir rurns out the guy in power actually likes his power.  Where's Nader? I'm voting for him. #CSPAN #bushvgore #alsnore #ralphnader
Voluntary testing. Bad. Mandatory. Good. Mean grandpa turned preacher. No way he'll get elected. #cspan #bushvgore #GeorgeWBush
Oh god did you get that letter in a lockhox? #cspan #bushvgore #alsnore
"Bonus plan and and and, if not. Federal money. Stumble stumble . I like leadership! Who is this guy?" #cspan #bushvgore #GeorgeWBush
