#HOW15 Following a #DamRemoval near Green Bay, migratory fish began utilizing the newly available habitat
#HOW15 http://t.co/OefEUa5YM3 is a great visualization and information tool when prioritizing barriers for #DamRemoval
#HOW15 #DamRemoval Most suitable inland habitat for Great Lakes migratory fish is completely blocked by barriers like dams and road culverts
#how15 #DamRemoval helps fish migration. We typically know where larger barriers like dams are. We're less sure about smaller road culverts.
#HOW15 #DamRemoval helps native migratory fish, but also allows invasive migration
