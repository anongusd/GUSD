@sheldongilbert @alangura Is this where we get 14th amendment due process as Solomon Grundy de jure privileges and immunities?
@CCamosy Nonetheless, I do see a lot of themes involving typically anti-utilitarian virtues the characters embody, such as lack of acceptable sacrifices.  Also through a common basterization of utilitarianism of those who sacrifice lives in unequal perportion to the utility gained.
@CCamosy Not precisely, though I just like to suppose his calculation of the consequences was based on utility.
@CCamosy That sounds possible.  However, Strange would have done whatever it took to succeed.  Just so happens it involved sparing of Tony/possibly others.  In the end, Strange calculates those to let live and let die based on the consequence (utilitarian) calculation.
@CCamosy If deontological Cap (cannot let a soldier die to save the universe) had commanded Wanda to destroy the stone from the beginning, probably lowers chance of a finished gauntlet.  Anti-deontology?

@NathanSumrall @jodiecongirl On that note, I would think a business his size would have to provide benefits or else face penalty
@lisabari Though the small business owners themselves (not necessarily the workers), could also find some level of success above workers
@lisabari Problems were more willing to be escalated to people in the know.  This probably says more about our size as a agent though.
@lisabari They do, but with my interactions with insurance as an individual (smaller sample) twas always terrible, where as in small biz,
@lisabari Some conjecture here; since companies are actually making money on small biz market (as opposed to indi), more incentive to help
@lisabari and having relationship with providers, because representing 500 people to an insurer makes you more important than 3-8 small biz.
@lisabari and our advantage (especially as we grew), was trying to preempt questions with automation (pulling lists of docs, IDs etc) and
@lisabari I was @SimplyInsured, which was a basically an online health insurance agent/HR management tool with a plan selection algo,
@lisabari I was on the small business side, but non-tristate regional carriers were generally better in my experience.
@lisabari best option is probably getting equipped with provider information and finding the right place to throw a fit.
@lisabari It's sad, but unless you have a good relationship with an insurance company (which obviously no individual consumer will have),
@lisabari Yup.  Some will have a vague sense of accepting one provider or another, but often no idea on the myriad of plan options.
@lisabari I did this for a living.  Even with knowing all the tricks, could still be very difficult to pin down coverage.

@ddoublep People against absolutely having a trade deficit are fringe.   Those who say on the margins to support domectics have some points
@jbarro @JimAcostaCNN Ask Sheldon Adelson
@MikeGrunwald @CoryBooker I think we may have very similar policy views
@ddoublep The question about the trade deficit is whether it's advantageous to buy things whose production's efficient elsewhere, domesticly
Your tweet adds to the count #Circular RT "@LarrySabato: Sen. Booker? Google "Cory Booker run for president"; you get 24,100,000 results."
@ddoublep @michaelbd I second that.   Having a trade deficit definitely has hard to measure advantages

@modernactivism I respect and commend your commitment to children.  Bad parents hurt children.

@modernactivism What percentage of parents constantly move?  Doesn't seem like it would be a high percentage.  If they do, they seem to care
@modernactivism Good, get them a case.  It would seem expensive, but I don't know the stats.  Longer days force parents to take notice
@modernactivism How do we get parents with less means more involved?  Or how do we level the playing field? Extended time seems plausible
@modernactivism It does not, but kids with means will do better.  Those parents know, more often, more often importance of education.
