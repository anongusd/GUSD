I am asking my rep, @RepTedBudd , to not play this game with such vulnerable people. Please join me and ask yours to d the same. We need legislators that respect facts and the truth.
They aren't tortured for political gain. The GOP is promoting this to label Democrats as against life, babies and the constitution. They want to get presidential candidates to commit to this issue to harm their campaigns.
The GOP would spend money time and resources that could help someone to prolong  the life of the nonviable fetus. Instead they would force doctors to cause these unfortunate souls to undergo painful procedures and suffer. Other dying children get hospice.
As usual, the GOP is taking a fact, interpreting it to foster its own goals, and then trying to solve a problem that is not really there. These are not healthy smiling babies. For example, one category of would be babies born with no brain. No medical treatment will fix that.
Then Governor Northram , a physician, was asked about this on a radio show. He explained what happens in the sad situation that a nonviable baby is born. Any physician will say the same. The GOP went nuts and started claiming infanticide.		https://t.co/Kouw9zIOP3
HB962 Born Alive bill. Another GOP political ploy. Late abortions, after 20 weeks, was only allowed if the mothers life was in danger. Governor Cuomo passed legislation that allows late term abortions as well if the mothers health is at risk, or if the fetus is nonviable.
@RepTedBudd Realize that what you are saying is it is important to take a nonviable birth and force it to endure expensive and painful medical procedures that will not make it survive, just suffer. This is, harmful, unethical and an abuse of your power. I guess we have no hospice either then

@repmarkpocan @realDonaldTrump This is not about being given something. The world is changing. AI and automation are removing jobs from the economy faster than they are being replaced. Driverless cars will remove truckers, cabbies, etc. Our world is changing and government must adapt or people will starve.
@SenBlumenthal Those who do not, will be voted out.
@JimInhofe You would force an infant that is nonviable to be given expensive care and undergo suffering? This is cruel, a misuse of our medical system, and sheer fear mongering and the latest GOP propaganda designed to raise money and votes.
@AngryNIdaho @SenatorRisch As long as he gets the evangelical vote and money, he doesn't care.
I think it is laudable and notable that @SenThomTillis will vote to stop the fake emergency. His refusal to call out the emergency as fake, however, tells me he needs to go in 2020. This could all have been prevented if he stood against lies earlier as his oath demanded. Shame.
