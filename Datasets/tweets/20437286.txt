The Rethink K-12 Education Summit has come to a close. Thank you for joining us today! The conversation continues at #RethinkSchool.
Kamal Hamdan (California State Univ) says that innovation shouldn't be limited to students, there must also be innovation in how teachers are prepared to educate students. #RethinkSchool
"Teaching is not about throwing content at children. It‚Äôs about giving each individual child the supports they need to grow and thrive." - Nicole Assisi (Thrive Charter Schools) #RethinkSchool
"True innovation happens when it redesigns the role of the teacher and sets them up for success‚Äù - Diane Tavenner (Summit Learning) #RethinkSchool
‚ÄúWe should also focus on rethinking how we are educating our educators so they can embrace the concept of educating the whole child." - Heather Clawson (Communities in Schools) #RethinkSchool
Nicole Assisi on tailoring the student experience to fit the individual: Provide the band-aid to the child that fell and scraped their knee. Just because a band-aid is available doesn't mean the whole class needs it at the same time. #RethinkSchool
"There is a real opportunity in education for schools to not fit kids into the same mold" - Thrive Charter School CEO, Nicole Assisi #RethinkSchool
Travis Works says goal of modern education should be to create self-motivated and self-directed thinkers that can tackle 21st century problems. #RethinkSchool
Travis Works of Cornville Regional Charter School describes the challenges of a ‚Äúpunch-in, punch-out‚Äù mentality that accompanies a traditional structured school day. #RethinkSchool
"College acceptance doesn‚Äôt equal readiness.‚Äù Summit Learning CEO Diane Tavenner emphasizes the importance of ensuring that students are prepared/positioned for college and career success. #RethinkSchool
Ken Wagner, Rhode Island Commissioner of Education, stresses "We need to get away from the assumption that education is a zero sum game" between types of schools. #RethinkSchool
Today‚Äôs final round of lightning talks is about to begin. Join us live: https://t.co/Hk5cJWKQEP     #RethinkSchool https://t.co/L3pMMOXMW9
Carol Becker, a homeschool parent, explains how homeschooling gives parents the opportunity to provide their children an environment that is physically and emotionally safe, flexible and academically challenging. #RethinkSchool
Elizabeth Geottl of Cristo Rey network describes how their schools serve exclusively low-income students and partner with local businesses to give students valuable, real-life work experience. #RethinkSchool

A common theme from today‚Äôs panelists: COURAGE. Courage to innovate and to reimagine how to achieve student success. #RethinkSchool
A learner-centered system requires student empowerment. "You have to empower the learners and trust the learners that they can and will actively go after the learning." - Tom Rooney #RethinkSchool

Mauney illustrates a shift in the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù classroom. From desks in rows with a teacher at the front of the room - to more group activities and hands on student engagement. #RethinkSchool
Technology is a way to build engagement in students - to tap into an intrinsic motivator to education in the classroom. "We have to prepare kids for jobs we don‚Äôt even know exist yet‚Äù - Stephen Mauney #RethinkSchool
Superintendent of Mooresville Graded School District explains that kids often have to ‚Äúpower down‚Äù when they step into schools. Mooresville, however, focuses on engaging students by ensuring access to technology in the classroom. #RethinkSchool
Rooney describes a learner-centered education model that emphasizes lifelong learning standards. It‚Äôs not just academics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about what kind of human being graduates will become. #RethinkSchool
"The traditional model doesn't honor the principle that people learn in different ways in different time frames‚Äù - Superintendent of Lindsay Unified School District, Tom Rooney #RethinkSchool

Kathleen Plinske challenges the assumption that the ‚Äútypical college student‚Äù attends college full-time directly after high school. #RethinkSchool
Matt Sigelman (Burning Glass) says we should view the exchange between college and careers as bidirectional -- not simply as college always preceding a career. #RethinkSchool
Capella‚Äôs Jillian Klein explains that students value the flexibility a flexible model provides to fit the students' individual needs. #RethinkSchool
Jeff Selingo illustrates the path to success for today‚Äôs students: where seat time is variable and mastery and outcomes are key. #RethinkSchool
ASU's Jeff Selingo describes how personalized, adaptive courseware can improve student success rates by 20-28%.  #RethinkSchool
‚ÄúWe try to squeeze many students through the narrow pathways to and through college, and then we wonder why many students don‚Äôt make it out.‚Äù - ASU's Jeff Selingo #RethinkSchool

"When students get that first successful college experience while still in high school, they are much more likely to continue onto a college education." - Kathleen Plinske #RethinkSchool https://t.co/gvGPponpaI
‚ÄúWe need broader preparation for a job market that is changing dramatically." - James Milliken, CUNY #RethinkSchool
Sigelman also notes that today's jobs require mixed skill sets -- or 'hybridized' -- yet higher education is often at odds with this reality and geared towards linear careers. #RethinkSchool
Matt Sigelman (Burning Glass) asks, "What does it mean to be 'job ready' amid tectonic shifts in the job market?" #RethinkSchool
College of the Ozarks president, Jerry Davis: "Everything cannot be solved with a computer. Sometimes it takes a personal touch to prevent students from falling through the cracks." #RethinkSchool
President of Valencia College, Kathleen Plinske, illustrates how Valencia is partnering with local businesses to serve non-traditional higher ed students. #RethinkSchool
Our second round of lightning talks is now under way. Join us live: https://t.co/Hk5cJWKQEP  #RethinkSchool https://t.co/i6135oez3z
Rick O'Donnell (Skills Fund) emphasizes: "If you want to measure quality, employers are the accreditors of last resort." #RethinkSchool
There‚Äôs easy consensus in the room: It‚Äôs not just about teaching students valuable skills -- it‚Äôs ensuring they actually learn them. #RethinkSchool
An important question for discussion: How do we encourage employers to hire based on competencies, not just based on a degree? #RethinkSchool
Ryan Craig (University Ventures) stresses the importance of a college graduate‚Äôs first job: "If you don‚Äôt get a good first job, you can‚Äôt get a good fifth job.‚Äù #RehinkSchool
Nelson highlights data that shows 1/3 of American undergraduates do not advance at all in terms of basic skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and analysis between the ages of 17 and 21. #RethinkSchool
Minerva Project CEO, Ben Nelson, describes the disconnect between higher education institutions and employers. 90% of institutions feel they are effectively preparing students, but employers often feel the workforce is underprepared. #RethinkSchool
EdX CEO, Anant Agarwal, asks our panel to guess how many of today‚Äôs jobs will be gone by 2030 due to advancements in technology. We‚Äôre surprised to learn it's 50%. Changes to how we approach education can help prepare for that shift. #RethinkSchool

The @usedgov School Ambassador Fellowship is designed to involve educators 	in the development and implementation of education policy.
Teachers, principals &amp; school staff provide vital leadership but often lack opportunities to contribute to policy on a broader scale.
In order for education reforms to succeed, practitioners must be involved in their planning and implementation.
