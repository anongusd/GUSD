@trixirabbit So when is our first date?

@BernieSanders minimum wage is bad, mmmkay?
@MrBeastYT This would be true only forgetting that we're already on the face of the planet traveling along with it.  Essentially, because our bodies and the earth's surface are moving together, any direction, regardless of the relativity to the earth's spin, is the same.

@StefanMolyneux On a relative scale, absolutely!  Lying about your heritage to get ahead is way worse than dressing up as anything.  Seriously, COSPLAY is huge, FURRY is huge, but we still find outrage in costumes?  There is NOTHING anyone could DRESS UP AS that would offend me, personally, ever

@AOC yeah, gotta get "big fossil" out.  They've been ruining the world for over 60 million years!		/sarcasm		On another note, glad to hear you got those living arrangements taken care of, I was terribly upset when I heard our new crazy congress lady couldn't get a place to live!

@Cheryll1950 @IlhanMN You're dumb, do some research on coal, or maybe work at the plant?  Or wait, yeah, having an ignorant opinion, that's probably best, do that!
@IlhanMN burning of coal produces near zero emissions.  my dad worked at a coal plant his entire life.  They have insane methods and regulations already to ensure most of what comes out of the stack is steam
@IlhanMN You're literally pandering to the idiots that believe in the modern myth of inter-sectionality?  A word with zero real meaning?  You aren't fighting crap, you're getting paid to advance in the destruction of your enemy, the USA, by implementing Sharia law and destroying tradition
@candiedhams @TheresaKudia @IlhanMN lol says the moron that's profile says climate change is intersectional?  very peer reviewed analysis there candiedhams, your scientific acumen astounds my senses!
@TheresaKudia @IlhanMN Love the coffee addicted mom and the lefty here talking like they're some erudite M.I.T. meteorology doctorates...  yes, eat up whatever fiction they feed you.  Isn't it tasty?  Mmm, this global warming thing does seem real, right?  Most science I've been able to test... not this
@IlhanMN "Climate Change" "Global Warming" and whatever they decide to call it tomorrow is SCIENCE-FICTION.  It is forced upon the scientific community with very disagreed upon models.  This is a NWO talking point to bring about carbon tax, and whatever other hellish regulation they want.
@IlhanMN You're wrong.  Protecting our country is the top priority for OUR COUNTRY and OUR PEOPLE.  @realDonaldTrump is our hero.  You and what you stand for our evil, disgraceful, and novel.  A day will come where your Sharia and Hate is banned in the good ole USA.

@RealCandaceO @TomiLahren @TPUSA and just because @RealCandanceO is probably morally and otherwise correct in her Pro Life stance - Pls don't demonize those who are still in doubt that life in ANY circumstance is ALWAYS correct.  For me, pro-choice was natural in youth because i am staunchly libertarian...

@peta Yummy! Pro Carnivore here. Death is part of Life. Eating is necessary. Those who eat nuts and berries are lucky they live in such an abundant society where they have CHOICE afforded to them.  Starving, alone, you would choose diff. I would agree free-range and non-GMO though!
@IlhanMN You should follow the traditions of the people you migrated into, and now, represent.  If head coverings are prohibited, you should bend to US.  Show US you are ONE of US, then push the issue for CHANGE on behalf of EVERYONE and not just YOURSELF.
@NicoleArbour That's what I tell myself too!	Now that I know you don't want me for a green card (congrats btw), marry me?

@RepSwalwell 1) I propose your resignation	2) You say you're going to continue to "serve" on my behalf	3) I propose your plans for disarming the citizens is evil	4) You claim big government will PROTECT the citizens, they do not need to do it themselves	5) You then threaten nukes against USA
@RepSwalwell you're so off base. it's clear you think the government is something MORE than its composite citizens	by the way to those ignorant, "assault weapon" is vocabulary they use to describe any semi-auto rifle...this is the majority of any modern weapon.	AUTOS are already illegal fools
@RepSwalwell 2nd amendment, look it up
This is the dumbest thing I've heard you say, and you say a lot of dumb stuff @REPSwalwell.

@I2394gusbirdcow @someideasnstuff @RealSaavedra @I2394gusbirdcow another NPC thinking criminals will follow laws	:golfclap:		Free humans have the freedom to utilize tools in order to protect themselves.

@brianstelter fake news, move on
@iowahawkblog ehhh, thin line there man, razor sharp thin
@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I read it, it's still dumb.  You lack a cohesive glue in all your arguments, namely the truth.
@realDonaldTrump @RonPaul was right, abolish the Fed!
@MichaelAvenatti Is this your Cory Booker moment, i mean, uh, "Spartacus"?
@staceydash Keep up the good work Stacey!
@transgamerthink cannot and should not are two distinct things...
@transgamerthink Criticize all u want, it's just kind of lazy to write a piece about the limitations of the exact thing you're criticizing.  Like saying, "Bananas taste too much like bananas" or "RDR2 plays too much like a game"	Go play something to your taste, leave RDR2 for us masculine cowboys
@transgamerthink OMG, the NPC's are becoming self-aware, they actually are judging other NPC's for being too artificial.
I LOVE that the left are now STRICT constitutionalists!  So, have your feelings on the 2nd amendment changed?!?  Can't we just use "founders didn't imagine illegal pregnant women" like you use "founders didn't imagine current &lt;insert misused gun jargon&gt; firearms" https://t.co/J9poBbt7v4
@brianstelter I LOVE that the left are now STRICT constitutionalists!		So, have your feelings on the 2nd amendment changed?!?		Can't we just use "founders didn't imagine illegal pregnant women"	like you use "founders didn't imagine current &lt;insert misused gun jargon&gt; firearms"
BAHAHA, you're dad is a REAL NAZI cuck:	"you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps?"	"Right. I was 14 y/o and I would say that was when my character was made..."	"was it difficult?"	"not at all.  Not at all."		https://t.co/kSmH7BkyAd https://t.co/8bmoQu4pDE
@AlexanderSoros @jewishaction BAHAHA, you're dad is a REAL NAZI cuck:	"you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps?"	"Right. I was 14 y/o and I would say that was when my character was made..."	"was it difficult?"	"not at all.  Not at all."		https://t.co/kSmH7BkyAd
I don't think the founders envisioned boats of pregnant women due any minute ILLEGALLY entering these united of states.		Don't like that argument?  Well, progressives try to rewrite the 2nd amendment ALL the time! https://t.co/MbF51wAkBa
@Acosta I don't think the founders envisioned boats of pregnant women due any minute ILLEGALLY entering these united of states.		Don't like that argument?  Well, progressives try to rewrite the 2nd amendment ALL the time!
A.K.A. first calls to reign in the internet, speech, and freedom of thought.  These people get paid millions not because they're beautiful or smart, or even tall.  They are paid because they understand the deception they spread and are lie smiths, crafting their evil half-truths https://t.co/uSOmSG27W2
@benshapiro for someone who thinks Trump should be supervised in his use of twitter..	you sure seem like a better candidate some days	Trump declared war on "fake news" not all media. He means those who DECEIVE THE PUBLIC; how many lies get peddled Ben?	Ask Alex Jones explain it to you please
@piersmorgan BAHAHAHA, f off t'wat
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley you're probably the most over the top character since Rosie
@MichaelAvenatti it's gonna be even more fun watching Trump wipe the floor with you than he did with Hillary
@MichaelAvenatti bahahaha, it's like watching a farmer feed his chickens corn
@benshapiro c'mon ben, you know they are.  look little brian stelter even liked your comment.
@NewWorldHominin @Laurier Congratulations Lindsay!!!
@davidmweissman i just threw up a little, excuse me

@LuckyBonez honestly, you did it better than scar jo
@CNN sick news CNN, is this how you plan to top Nickelodeon?
@CNN @julianzelizer @CNNOpinion so		cheesy
@CNN So this explains your pundits...
@brianstelter you're an imbecile
@kaitlancollins because true bomb are capable of exploding by definition.		try a dictionary.
@BrittanyVenti Top tier troll game B!
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Haha keep up the good work Sarah.  CNN is propaganda BS
@RealJamesWoods Still looks like a bad mofo to me. If anything the "flinch" is bcuz of the sheer concussive force and noise. This happens subconsciously and requires loads of training your body NOT to react. A more common example of this phenomenon is shooting a handgun.
@RealJamesWoods dude, best wordsmithing i've seen all day
@elonmusk i hope one day to use this as a quote
@LauraLoomer OOO David, need some aloe for that there burnnnnn?!?

@TheYoungTurks @YouTube the young turds is a failing organization
@JaniceDean @megynkelly uh, i dunno, what she tried to do to Alex Jones was pretty horrific.
@Marxism_Wokeism @elonmusk dumb, if elon found himself in revolutionary France, it's because he built a time machine to get there.  Certainly, one who time travels doesn't get caught.
@BrittanyVenti @Styx666Official @pewdiepie love that you love styx!
@MichaelAvenatti Dude, gonna be so happy watching you go down
@kaitlancollins BREAKING NEWS		CNN Reporting the hard hitting facts		Keep up the good jorb		https://t.co/IHGfKctRB2
@brianstelter so this means Fox News is attacking themselves?		Didn't quite think that one through, eh?
@brianstelter right, i see your ploy...		Get Trump to admit to climate change...
@CNN @brianstelter @oliverdarcy it's astounding that anyone actually would listen to "analysis" from "little" brian stelter.
Question, why are all the people in the caravan wearing completely clean, brand new, branded clothes?!?  I thought they were poor, shouldn't they be in rags?

@AC360 @andersoncooper "I'm CIA deep state controlled nd we r mad the people are waking up"  I'm gonna continue the propaganda until u r reeducated."		If u guys were ACTUALLY smart u'd realize a position of neutrality was ur only hope at slowing the awakening. U dbl down, so do we.		U still lose #MAGA
@Acosta I'll translate this for your audience: 		"Wahh, orange man bad.  Orange man didnt talk about me or my mega cool propaganda outfit.  Gimme attention!"		*a little Brian Stelter appears!*		In a Mark Dice voice: "It's OK Jim, orange man IS bad"		*lil Brian wipes Jim's tears away*
@brianstelter Just the 'facts' ma'am... https://t.co/9cmQY2ck9x
@Acosta Pics or it didn't happen.  I'm thinking "fake news" was far more likely?  Either way, glad you landed safely.
@PeterSchiff Maybe I'm ignorant, but i thought the Federal Reserve does nothing but evil?	Aren't they trying to put us into a recession by raising rates?
@DeTabachnick @NewWorldHominin @MeghanEMurphy Leave Lindsay alone brah, are you mad because she's more relevant than you?
@PardesSeleh Can't vote, need more information on the 101 candidates...
@MichaelAvenatti @StephenKing Isn't yours this week, Michael:		"Pay Up"?		lul
@StephenKing Yikes, i dunno Stephen, this late in life you're going to run?  Kudos to you i guess.  Trump is gonna be really hard to beat, though.  I prefer you keep writing.  Also, i really liked the SNL idea of Hillary Clinton being the evil clown from IT.
@thedonaldreddit Whilst i pushed back on him, i also have to say let's not over-correct.  At the end of the day @benshapiro is an ally of Trump, and a patriot, and very smart.  He also is married to a doctor, a super hot one.
@daveysockrocker @PardesSeleh Davey, the difference is honor.  The difference is intention.  The difference is $700b+ for the US Military that protects the current safety of our lives, freedom, and liberty.  You also are incorrect, they are CRIMINALS by definition.  Migrants are what Ms Seleh's parents are.
@benshapiro Additionally, i would push back that while sending bombs is an evil act, acts do not necessarily denote a human being purely divine, or purely evil...		You are presupposing a lot, one person, 100% evil, and only attempting to commit a simple direct attack.  Usually u r more even.
@benshapiro Now, as someone who generally agrees with u, isn't that a little extreme?  Isn't it just as likely, given zero information, that either is true?  What facts support this comment?  Or is it just how u feel?		I, being 100% ignorant of any facts, avoid making a judgement either way
@jeffzeleny It's ok Jeff, take a breather before you inform the masses of the urinal openings		https://t.co/arHdW1plI4

@brianstelter That's some pretty in-depth reporting, i think you are onto something here...  HMMM
@PeterSchiff Yeah, i agree, i feel like he's politically forced into saying that despite knowing better.  Could also be rhetoric, won't know until he gets a shot at changing it.
@Fox35News like, literally no one?  hmmm suspicious
@jeffzeleny Jeff, during the first 100 minutes of this rally, what has surprised you the most?  Enchanted you the most?  Humbled you the most?  Troubled you the most?		--I KNOW, GREAT QUESTION--	:clap:

@davidhogg111 you literally know nothing.  you think the NRA has power over manufacturers? you're likening a book club to the author, and claiming the book club controls the narrative, you're just literally uninformed.  i don't mind you're stupid as shit, but don't spread your ignorance
@davidhogg111 honestly, i think you should just go to therapy, bypass the dog
@davidhogg111 when the light bulb goes off in your head later in life and you realize you knew nothing at this time, will you ask for forgiveness, or double down on your ignorance?
@davidhogg111 delete your twitter account to show you aren't an opportunist using tragedy to promote yourself.  oh, wait, you won't.
@davidhogg111 @equalityfl @Emma4Change wow surprised the comment section is filled with adults who know less than these two idiotic kids.  not surprising.  hey how's that nazi armband thing going kiddos?
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump #guntax ... already exists
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Sales to most police, military, and government are exempt to this tax, however, these sales are at most 20% of any manufacturer's revenue.  The vast majority, the commercial market, is taxed.
@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump Guns are already taxed upon import or first sale after domestic production here in USA.  It's called FET. It's an inclusive 10% for pistols and 11% for longguns and ammo.  So those mean manufacturers pay millions a year to the feds.  Facts don't care about your feelings.
@HilarieBurton @JDMorgan Congratulations!
@cameron_kasky @DLoesch I know all of you kiddos who just left the womb think Dana or the NRA is a new thing...  its not.  She was famous is badass while you were still on the teet.  Don't worry life is long enough that you'll eventually see your folly.
@elithejake @davidhogg111 Your poem sucks.  It seems to forget entirely about the person behind the trigger.  Also, incendiary is to cause fire, unless you are talking about magnesium dragon's breath shotgun rounds you're inexact at best
