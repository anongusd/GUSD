@musiklpn @RepMarkMeadows Good advice.		Gee, I wonder why these guys dont ever acknowledge that üî¥BIG-FAT-LIE-TO-GET-HIMSELF-ELECTEDüî¥	with which Trump rolled them ?		I'm guessing that 	(whopper though it was)	it's been drowned out in the tsunami of daily lies which defines this contemptible "presidency"
@RepMarkMeadows Congress hasnt been doing its job since 1/20/17.Heck, it's not done its job since M.Garland.	No, come to think of it... Congress hasnt done its job since Mitch&amp;Gang decided in that bar to tank EVERYTHING during O's term (even if it HURT üá∫üá∏) 	bc their TOP goal ws to get back power

@RepRashida And you had to wreck it with your tacky, ugly remarks.		As much as we could sing duets about the character of trump, you damaged others, not him, by being so ugly about it.
@RepRashida "Unapologetically me"?		How very Donald Trump of you.		No regard for anything but yr own sweet self.		You do libs no favors by being tacky &amp; crass, even if its unapologetically you. And since you brought up th Quran, you do no favors to muslims, either. 		Clean up the ugly mouth.
@RepRashida 		You make ALL dems look vile &amp; redneck when you speak publicly like a vile redneck. Please remember that now that you're  elected. Save that language for your garage or corner bar.		Dems are supposed 2look BETTER than the disgusting trump. They are. Dont hurt them.
