HHS is asking employers, employees &amp; insurers how the federal gov’t can be more flexible &amp; responsive to concerns &amp; challenges over maintaining “grandfathered” plans- the federal gov’t shouldn't be a roadblock to affordable coverage. Share insights here: https://t.co/SlUHOsrzlb
Through @POTUS’s leadership, the Trump Administration is committed to improving access to more affordable healthcare options for all Americans, including access to “grandfathered” plans for employers &amp; employees if these plans continue to meet their needs. https://t.co/SlUHOsJacJ
Because “grandfathered” plans pre-existed the ACA, they are exempt from costly ACA requirements &amp;, as a result, can be more affordable. Though a significant number of employers continue to maintain these plans, the number has consistently declined. https://t.co/SlUHOsrzlb
Today, @HHSGov, @USDOL, &amp; @USTreasury issued a RFI seeking comments on challenges employers may face in maintaining “grandfathered” health plans that existed before the ACA passed in 2010, which can be a more affordable option for employees. https://t.co/SlUHOsrzlb

Ultimately, every demonstration will be independently evaluated under a CMS approved design. Guidance coming soon to ensure this will be done consistently across states with CE. But monitoring activities already underway, &amp; we’re working closely with states.
Evaluation happens over the life of the demonstration (5 years) &amp; involves an independent third party. We’ve worked with experts to design methodologies to measure impacts of CE waivers on employment, net income, coverage, &amp; health outcomes.
Evaluation and monitoring are related, but separate, activities. Monitoring starts day one, and we’ve developed metrics for states to regularly report on items like enrollment counts, access to &amp; quality of care, administrative costs, and appeals.
Medicaid 1115 demonstrations are an important tool to test and evaluate innovative reforms. Community engagement (CE) requirements are no different, &amp; we’re working with states to ensure that all projects are carefully monitored &amp; independently evaluated.

Past administrations have tried fixing our system by regulating its every sector, every provider, every payor, but now we’re unleashing the most powerful force for improving quality and value: our patients.
These 2019 objectives will rely more on the efficiencies and innovation of the private market rather than bureaucrats in D.C.
This year, @CMSGov is focused on three main objectives: empowering patients, focus on results, and unleashing innovation.
Have you downloaded "What’s Covered" yet? This free mobile app lets people w/ #Medicare quickly see whether services or medical items are covered – in any setting where they use their mobile device (like a smartphone or tablet). https://t.co/MdVbVpWhvx #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/iJxophW7FX
Thank you, @NancyLeaMond, for helping spread the word! We’re excited to hear feedback from @AARP and its members. https://t.co/7AFVuXdElz
Today we’ve had wonderful discussions with #healthcare leadership from across the greater Philadelphia area. Just had a great meeting with @PennMedicine leadership about value-based care! https://t.co/XsGu4biUls
On my way to @PennLDI for a roundtable discussion on @CMSGov initiatives. Looking forward to listening to the unique insights and perspectives of #Philadelphia’s health care professionals.
Thank you @WhartonHCC for inviting me to speak at #WHCBC2019, and to everyone who joined me this morning! https://t.co/UNzuoqBPqV
“One of the underlying issues in healthcare is the lack of transparency - many of our policies are designed to achieve greater transparency on price” #WHCBC2019 https://t.co/a8CY86ecuf
By empowering patients, focusing on results, and unleashing innovation, we will move toward a patient-centered health system that delivers higher value. #WHCBC2019
We are leveraging innovation, ensuring that patients &amp; doctors have access to instantaneous, life-saving patient care information. #WHCBC2019
When it comes to the bureaucracy, we want to focus on results, not process. Bureaucracy that keeps doctors away from patients does more damage than it does good. #WHCBC2019
For the very first time, #Medicare is paying for virtual check-ins, meaning patients can connect with their doctors by phone or video chat, similar to how telehealth works. #WHCBC2019
When providers have responsibility for managing a budget &amp; their reimbursement is tied to the results they produce, they will be incentivized to find innovative ways to keep people healthy &amp; lower costs. #WHCBC2019
In an ideal world we would be able to evaluate quality without providers taking any extra effort, so we are focusing on electronic, registry and claims-based measures, going forward. #WHCBC2019
We demand to know the cost of virtually everything we buy. Why shouldn’t we demand #PriceTransparency from the health care system? #WHCBC2019
We all know how difficult it can be to navigate the health care system. We are taking action to create a world where patients have instant information at their fingertips to easily choose a doctor to get the best care at the lowest price. #WHCBC2019
This year, there are 23 more insurers on https://t.co/Ew0H2vt9To than last year, but our work to ⬆️ competition &amp; choice to ⬇️ prices didn’t stop w/ the Exchanges. In #MedicareAdvantage &amp; in Part D, premiums are at their lowest in 3 yrs &amp; plan choices have increased. #WHCBC2019
About to take the stage for my @WhartonHCC #WHCBC2019 speech and fireside chat! Looking forward to sharing insights on our 2019 strategies and initiatives!
Excited to be in #Philadelphia for @WhartonHCC’s #WHCBC2019! Check back for live updates from my speech!

At @CMSGov, we know that understanding the risks that are often associated w/nursing homes are critical when searching for a facility that will provide care that supports health &amp; quality of life. Take a look at our blog in @Health_Affairs for more: https://t.co/3RJeLj2tHo
@kleib323 @memorialhermann Thank you, @kleib323! We’re taking notes. #WheresThePrice

"We can’t accept the status quo. Because if we do, the best health care in the world will be undermined by an unsustainable, expensive delivery system." #CMSQualCon19
We are solving problems to sustain our programs over the long term to make our system more competitive, innovative, and to deliver high quality, affordable, coordinated and efficient care. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/oZGI4wWVtF
"Medicaid is a vital safety-net program that was created to care for society’s most vulnerable.  Let me be clear, this administration is firmly committed to this purpose." #CMSQualCon19
Because of our Blue Button 2.0 initiative, over 1,400 app developers are building user-friendly apps that help our beneficiaries understand and access their data, like sharing their claims history with their doctor, and lists of medications. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/UDdJTGYKvk
We are improving the experience of every patient through a White House initiative called #MyHealthEData. Its goal is to ensure that patients have access to all of their records. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/06rBOdBhNd
“I have noticed that advocates of #MedicareforAll have cited the low administrative costs of this important program, but that isn’t something to brag about…..we only review less that 2/10 of 1% of the over 1 billion claims that Medicare processes every year.” #CMSQualCon19
.@CMSGov is delivering results. We’ve addressed nearly 60% of the suggestions and, through regulation changes alone, providers have already saved nearly 5.2 billion dollars &amp; 53 million hours through 2021. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/TisrkBNhAF
As part of our #PatientsOverPaperwork initiative, we received over 3,000 comments, &amp; over 2,000 healthcare professionals attended our listening sessions. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/84bLCH4kUg
Last year, we published our first-ever #Medicaid &amp; #CHIP Scorecard. The scorecard is based on the premise that taxpayers &amp; beneficiaries deserve to know the performance &amp; results their Medicaid programs are achieving. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/D2YWxIqpfl
In 2017, we launched our “Meaningful Measures” initiative, &amp; we delivered on our promise.  We rolled back nearly 20% of measures because they were either topped out, duplicative, or simply overly burdensome to report for little gain.#CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/PrKnv8XHYp
From 2014 to 2017, we have seen a 13% reduction in the number of Hospital Acquired Conditions across the nation. This translates to preventing over 20,000 deaths from hospital harm, &amp; a savings of $7.7 Billion to the #healthcare system. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/F1VlU40pot
Today, I am pleased to announce the latest patient safety data, which shows a continued significant reduction in the amount of harm experienced in hospitals. #CMSQualCon19
Once patients are able to assess both cost and quality, providers will have to compete and improve efficiency in order to stay in business. #CMSQualCon19
If you can’t find the price of a procedure at your local hospital on their website, I want to know about it. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/9VpK7h6HMt
Critical to patient empowerment is our #PriceTransparency initiative. A key reason health care costs continue to skyrocket is the fact that health care prices are largely hidden from patients.  #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/0zkYWOD291
"Hopefully you are seeing that providing patients pricing information is a marketing opportunity, not a competitive disadvantage. Either way, you can count on @CMSGov taking steps this year to further transparency." #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/2SarZgaoo3
#eMedicare gives beneficiaries new online tools, including secure access to their claims information. Our goal is to provide a seamless, online healthcare customer experience. #CMSQualCon19 https://t.co/OngBtsMWbm
The current financing structure treats episodes of sickness rather than promoting a lifetime of health, and it doesn’t reward providers who deliver high quality care, and positive results. #CMSQualCon19
We are re-positioning the government’s role from one prescribing processes through heavy regulation to one focused on safeguarding outcomes and taxpayers’ dollars. #CMSQualCon19
We are prioritizing a well-informed, empowered consumer rather than a government agency to make our health care decisions. #CMSQualCon19
All of our initiatives focus on implementing a vision to transform the healthcare system into one that delivers better value to patients through competition and innovation. #CMSQualCon19

.@CMSGov has made #interoperability a top priority because #healthcare communications should be as easy as clicking a button. Our beneficiaries should be able to obtain &amp; share their information w/ just a few clicks – and we’re working to make this a reality.
Our transition to a value-based #healthcare system depends on #interoperability &amp; creating a system where doctors &amp; their patients can make decisions based on ALL of a patient’s health information. @CMSGov is working to ensure patients have access to their data.
The work @CMSGov has done to empower patients by increasing #PriceTransparency is unprecedented, but we are just getting started and will be doing more over the next year to encourage hospitals across the country.
We have big plans for @CMSGov this year. Want the inside scoop? Join me at #CMSQualCon19 on January 29 to hear about #CMS’s strategic priorities and initiatives for 2019. https://t.co/VJcCpj4wPU

To support #PathwaystoSuccess, @CMSGov is streamlining the application process for ACOs through our recently launched new system that is more user-friendly &amp; provides rapid feedback to ACOs on provider enrollment information at the time of submission. https://t.co/XGARK4Q4NH
Please note that ACOs who plan to submit an application for the July 1, 2019 start date must submit a non-binding Notice of Intent to Apply by Noon January 18th. https://t.co/XGARK4Q4NH
Last week, @CMSGov released the sample applications &amp; guidance documents to assist ACOs preparing for applications for the July 1, 2019 start date. These applications are DUE FEBRUARY 19th! You can find the documents here: https://t.co/XGARK4Q4NH
Unlike previous years, we’re offering 2 application cycles in 2019 to allow ACOs that are ready to launch on July 1st to immediately move to the redesigned program, while providing an additional opportunity for new &amp; transitioning ACOs that require more time.
This year, @CMSGov is providing two ACO application cycles: the first for a July 1, 2019 start date and the second for a January 1, 2020 start date.

@Surgeon_General @Chiefs @NFL @Colts You are so gracious.  I’m still getting trying to get over it.
.@CMSGov is following @POTUS’s leadership by putting patients first and ensuring that we reduce out-of-pocket healthcare spending for the American people.
Here at @CMSGov, we’re working to lower drug prices. We’ve already begun improving the current system by getting rid of burdensome regulations that kept beneficiaries from having access to lifesaving medications.
Thank you for helping spread the word, @gracemarietweet! We’re eager to learn about more great examples of how hospitals are driving #PriceTransparency! https://t.co/JnvPNv39my
Ultimately, @CMSGov is measuring the success of #PriceTransparency by the ability of patients to get the information they need. Learn more about our latest price transparency initiative in my recent blog: https://t.co/52VnVZaF2P
Patients have been shut out of the process of increasing value, but I believe they should instead be driving change. The lack of #PriceTransparency is a significant barrier to value w/in the current market, &amp; unlocking cost information is critical to #EmpoweringPatients.
Mark your calendars! The #CMSQualCon19 is fast approaching! You can stay up to date on the latest news here: https://t.co/2zw5qajTie

If your hospital has a pricing tool that works, I’d love to hear about it! #PriceTransparency
You can check out these great examples of hospitals that have gone above and beyond their requirements here:	@UofUHealth: https://t.co/zhKNXr18jI 	@UCHealth: https://t.co/Q0nCFsWHRf	@MayoClinic: https://t.co/uobpHCy7b9
.@UofUHealth’s out-of-pocket costs tool estimates prices w/individual’s insurance information, @UCHealth offers individualized estimates via patient portal, mobile app, &amp; a dedicated call center, &amp; @MayoClinic offers a cost estimator- all great examples of #PriceTransparency!
While @CMSGov is driving price transparency for hospital services, we have already seen some great examples of tools from hospitals that have gone beyond what is required. @UofUHealth, @UCHealth, &amp; @MayoClinic are examples of hospitals that are #EmpoweringPatients.
Giving patients access to pricing data is critical, but it is just the first step in fulfilling our commitment to helping patients see the whole healthcare picture so that they will truly be empowered. #PriceTransparency #EmpoweringPatients
Many hospital CEOs have released statements of support towards giving patients more information, and hospitals don’t have to wait for us to go further in helping their patients understand what care will cost.  #PriceTransparency
While the information hospitals are posting now isn’t patient-specific, we still believe it is an important first step &amp; sets the stage for private third parties to develop tools &amp; resources that are more meaningful &amp; actionable. #PriceTransparency
By requiring hospitals’ price information to be online in a machine-readable format- meaning the data could be imported into other documents, we hope to make it easier for patients to access &amp; compare at least basic information about costs at various facilities.#PriceTransparency
.@CMSGov made a historic change by updating guidelines to specifically require hospitals to post price information on the internet in a machine-readable format. #PriceTransparency
We must move our healthcare system on a trajectory that points our #healthcare system towards what has always been its primary mission: serving the interests of patients. To do this, patients must have access to the information they need to make the best decisions.
#PriceTransparency in #healthcare is a top priority for both @POTUS and @CMSGov. The lack of price transparency has resulted in millions of patients either foregoing care or being forced to purchase a service w/o knowing its true cost.
Congratulations! Looking forward to working with you in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/u1KZ67DYDM
This year, @CMSGov is charting a new course toward improving value, and we have some big plans to help empower patients. To get an in-depth look at what we have planned, join us at the #CMSQualCon19 on Jan. 29th and tune in here for live updates! #EmpoweringPatients
The answer to the high cost of #healthcare isn’t more government control. The answer is to put empowered patients at the center of the system, driving lower costs &amp; higher quality as providers compete for consumers. #EmpoweringPatients
By 2026, 1 in 5 dollars in our economy will be spent on #healthcare - if not addressed this could lead to greater strain on household budgets, &amp; hurt businesses.

Through our “Pathways to Success” program, @CMSGov is #StrenghteningMedicare by reducing the amount of time an ACO can remain in the program without taking accountability for healthcare spending. https://t.co/vxu9tD7jdB
To encourage accountability, our “Pathways to Success” program increases the shared savings rate to 40% for ACOs not at risk for healthcare costs, &amp; 50% at all levels for ACOs who assume risk, providing an on-ramp to the program. https://t.co/vxu9tD7jdB
Most #Medicare ACOs currently do not face consequences when costs increase. Through “Pathways to Success,” ACOs will now be taking greater accountability for healthcare spending. https://t.co/vxu9tD7jdB

Thank you to everyone who joined me at @Knect365! It was great to share insights on how @CMSGov is working to lower drug prices for the American people! #FDACMS https://t.co/Ifk7CIilhv
The IPI model would generate savings of 30 percent for beneficiaries and taxpayers, for total savings of up to $17.2 billion over five years. #FDACMS
@POTUS introduced the International Pricing Index Model for #PartB, in an advanced NPRM. The IPI model would make Medicare a smart purchaser, slowly phasing in a payment level based on international prices – which are far lower than what we pay. #FDACMS
We are also committed to lowering prices in #Medicare Part B, which covers physician-administered drugs through a fee-for-service system. #FDACMS
.@CMSGov has also embedded strong patient protections that would ensure that use of step therapy and prior authorization would not restrict access to prescription drugs. #FDACMS
Specifically, we propose to allow #PartD plans to exclude from their formularies protected class drugs w/ price increases that are greater than inflation, as well as certain new drug formulations that are not a significant innovation over the original product. #FDACMS
To modernize the #PartD program and empower plans to drive down costs for beneficiaries who need these drugs, our proposed rule would permit greater flexibility in the protected classes.
I want to make clear that as @CMSGov has developed solutions, we have put patients at the center of all our policies, not special interest groups, but patients. #FDACMS
To address this, in May, @POTUS released his drug pricing blueprint, which includes the most sweeping set of policies to lower drug prices ever put forth by an administration.  @CMSGov has been hard at work to make the President’s vision a reality. #FDACMS
In #Medicare, we devote the largest percentage of our budget to prescription drugs – and this spend is growing each year – faster than in any other area. #FDACMS
...I realize the remarkable impact that these new medicines are having on our programs and the people we serve. #FDACMS
From where I sit, as the head of the #Medicare and #Medicaid programs and the health insurance exchanges – which collectively cover over 130 million Americans...
The nation is truly benefiting from @SGottlebFDA’s leadership, which has significantly sped up the approval process for new drugs, and is encouraging even further innovation. #FDACMS

We listened to docs &amp; responded by streamlining the documentation requirements for office E/M visits. Our E/M coding requirements rule is a long overdue update of the 1995 and 1997 E/M documentation guidelines. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/w4mvbg4ZxO
#ICYMI: After 20 years of increasing burden with no change, @CMSGov’s PFS reforms the E/M coding requirements in order to ↓ burden on providers so that they can spend ↑ time with their patients. #StrengtheingMedicare https://t.co/w4mvbg4ZxO

Today’s rule provides more certainty to the market, but doesn’t fix Obamacare’s underlying flaws that caused premiums to more than double since 2013. Good news: new CMS guidance empowers states to waive flawed Obamacare requirements &amp; adopt better solution https://t.co/21mhEFtL8s
“Today’s final rule continues our commitment to provide certainty regarding this important program, to give insurers the confidence they need to continue participating in the markets, and, ultimately, to guarantee that consumers have access to better coverage options.” https://t.co/dm9sGGMK25
This rule will restore operation of the risk adjustment program, and mitigate some of the uncertainty caused by the #NewMexico litigation: https://t.co/21mhEFtL8s

Notably, retail prescription drug spending was nearly flat (grow at less than ½ percent) – down from a high of 12.4% growth in 2014. While we have much work ahead, this is promising sign for @POTUS’s commitment to lowering drug costs in this country. https://t.co/YhuscMV9fe
#Medicare spending growth was flat and #Medicaid spending grew slower. Overall spending growth across the three largest service categories – hospitals, physician &amp; clinical services, and retail drug spending – all slowed down in 2017 compared to 2016. https://t.co/YhuscMV9fe
The good news: overall national health spending growth slowed to 3.9% in 2017. That’s almost a percentage point lower than 2016 and slower than growth in the overall economy (4.2%). https://t.co/YhuscMV9fe

It is essential that we continue bipartisan conversations on how we can make the promise of 21st Century care a reality for patients by building it on a foundation of innovation.
This demonstration, the Independence at Home, tests the use of home-based primary care teams to improve health outcomes and reduce expenditures for chronically ill #Medicare beneficiaries.
The Bipartisan Budget Act also extended an innovative demonstration that aims to improve care for #Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions.
Including all states in this model will allow plans across the country to focus on the services that are of highest clinical value to these chronically ill enrollees.
The Bipartisan Budget Act includes all 50 states in a @CMSGov Innovation Center model in which #MedicareAdvantage plans offer supplemental benefits or reduced cost sharing to enrollees with specified chronic conditions.
This Administration has worked hard to be innovative at @CMSGov. Through action we’ve taken, for the very first time, starting in January, #Medicare will pay for virtual check-ins, meaning patients can connect with their doctors by phone or video chat.
At @CMSGov , we understand that relentless #innovation is a crucial driver in creating value in #healthcare, just like in other industries.
We think this legislation will lead to improvements in innovation and quality of care for the millions of Americans dealing with chronic conditions every day.
The Bipartisan Budget Act is a great example of Congress reaching across the aisle to address the growing concerns faced by the millions of Americans with a chronic disease.
I would like to take a moment to applaud @senorrinhatch and Sen. @RonWyden for their leadership in advancing innovative efforts to modernize Medicare and support innovation that will have a real impact on our beneficiaries.
Our time in public life is finite, but the legacies of dedicated public servants such as President George HW Bush will live on.
I have found that, even in our disagreements, while heated they sometimes are, the energy of our arguments are not born from a political need to win, but from a sincere desire to do what is best for the American people.

In addition to this new guidance, I am pleased to announce that, today, @CMSGov is releasing four Waiver Concepts to help illustrate how states can take advantage of this new flexibility. #ALECINDC #ALECIDEAS
So, last month, we took a major step toward empowering states to address the problems caused by the ACA by giving states broader flexibility to waive certain ACA requirements and create real alternatives. #ALECINDC #ALECIDEAS
The federal government should be working in closer partnership with states to foster and support innovation. In fact, @POTUS ’s first executive order directed federal agencies to “provide greater flexibility to States and cooperate with them in implementing healthcare programs.”
The Administration has also opened up more affordable coverage options by expanding Association Health Plans &amp; short-term plans, which can provide a lifeline to certain people priced out of the market.

.@CMSGov recognizes that accurate and appropriate Medicare payment rates are essential to all hospitals, especially rural ones, and has made improving the current wage index system a priority.
Thank you @AEI for hosting me at today’s conference, and to everyone to attended and tuned into my speech! https://t.co/3hr31lFwIK
You can tune in to my @AEI fireside chat, happening now: https://t.co/phcYNK0k8D https://t.co/eCAwFXodwu
While these policy changes are in the weeds, they are going to transform medical practice, which is part of why we are allowing 2 years for implementation.  We want to continue the conversation &amp; gather input from the medical community beyond routine communications and meetings.
We need to fix the problems in Medicare today – and that is what our proposal for physician documentation is all about.  In addition to the changes I outlined for 2019, we are making more fundamental changes to reduce burden in 2021.
We also finalized more fundamental changes to the system of billing Medicare, but those changes will not take effect until 2021, because we want to engage further with the medical community on these policies.
.@CMSGov moved to finalize improvements to documentation requirements for 2019.
.@CMSGov received over 15,000 comments on our rule, which provided us with specific feedback on how to improve our proposal, and we listened.
In this year’s rule for physician payment in Medicare, we proposed an overhaul of the current system of billing Medicare for “Evaluation and Management,” or E&amp;M visits.
The fact that we are having these highly trained individuals spend time clicking through screens is a poor use of one of our greatest resources.
Clinicians are many of our nation’s brightest minds.
It should be clear to anyone paying attention that we are focusing our efforts to reduce regulatory burden &amp; bolster competition in order to support independent practices &amp; increase choices for patients.
.@POTUS’s Executive Order “Promoting Healthcare Choice and Competition” empowered our agency to focus on this trend and bolster competition in the marketplace
Consolidation has downstream effects in the healthcare system and impacts patient care.  Patients have fewer choices and face higher prices when there are fewer competitors, and physicians often have less autonomy in consolidated systems.
The costs to comply with our regulations have, in many cases, become too high for independent physicians to bear – from requirements regarding EHRs to new regulations under MACRA.
The thicket of regulations that @CMSGov has rolled out over the years has also accelerated the consolidation we are seeing in our #healthcare system.
The most common driver of burnout is having to handle too many bureaucratic tasks, including charting and paperwork.
A recent survey by @Medscape of over 15,000 physicians from 29 specialties found that a striking 42% of physicians report burnout.
Regulatory burden is a major driver of healthcare costs. @AHAHospitals has found that health systems, hospitals, &amp; post-acute care providers spend nearly $39 billion a year on regulatory compliance.
.@POTUS has directed all federal agencies to “cut the red tape,” to get government out of the way &amp; unleash the ingenuity &amp; creativity of the American people.
While many see only government solutions to this problem, since I have been given the helm at @CMSGov, it has become clear to me that many times the government IS the problem.
.@CMSGov we are constantly aware that due to the size of our footprint, our policies have spillover effects on the entire healthcare market, as many private payers base their payment on #Medicare’s policies.
My @AEI conference speech is happening now! Tune in here to listen LIVE: https://t.co/phcYNK0k8D
Protected class policy is now in need of an update in order to make sure that patients who need these drugs get the same discounts as other patients. Learn how we are proposing to fix this through my blog with @SecAzar: https://t.co/yt4wb8y4bm #StrengtheningMedicare
The lack of any ability of Part D plans to manage protected class drugs has allowed the pharmaceutical industry to command high prices. Private market discounts for these drugs are in the 20-30% range, but the average discount in protected classes is just 6%.
One area in which #PartD plans are constrained in their negotiating power is in the "Protected classes." This policy was put into effect 12 years ago, but the policy was never intended to stay permanent. #StrengtheningMedicare
From Day one, @POTUS has made it clear that lowering prescription drug costs is a top priority, so today @CMSGov announced proposed changed to strengthen negotiations for #Medicare #PartD to lower costs for beneficiaries. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/yt4wb8y4bm
Additionally, our proposal requires plans to increase transparency w/out-of-pocket cost obligations for prescriptions drugs when a prescription is written. https://t.co/rCSm8F23xy
Today's #Medicare proposal provides #PartD plans w/greater flexibility to negotiate discounts for drugs in "protected" therapeutic classes, &amp; lower costs for patients taking these drugs.
Today, @CMSGov is proposing to modernize the #MedicareAdvantage and #PartD programs by removing barriers that keep plans from leveraging these tools and is seeking comment on further considerations to ensure patient protections. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/rCSm8F23xy
Seniors in #Medicare deserve to benefit from the #PartD program tools that have been developed in the commercial health insurance marketplace to reduce costs. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/rCSm8F23xy
“In designing today’s proposal, foremost in the agency’s mind was the impact on patients, and the proposal is yet another action CMS has taken to deliver on President Trump and Secretary Azar’s commitment on drug prices.” #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/rCSm8F23xy https://t.co/3iCfc4dFoE

Under @CMSGov’s recently finalized separate payment under the #Medicare PFS, clinicians can be paid when a patient checks in w/the practitioner via a telecommunications device to decide if an office visit or other service is needed. #NationalRuralHealthDay https://t.co/rbMmY6vxZd

Ultimately, whatever @CMSGov is doing to promote #telehealth, it’s really all about one thing:  To foster #innovation &amp; protect &amp; strengthen the #Medicare program in order to deliver on its promise to our elderly &amp; disabled populations. #HospitalSummit2018
For 2019, under our final rules, #Medicare patients receiving home dialysis will be able to receive their monthly clinical assessments via telehealth, from their homes.  #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
We will also be paying for virtual consultations between physicians, and evaluation of remote pre-recorded images and video.  #HospitalSummit2018
For the very first time, starting in January, #Medicare will pay for virtual check-ins, meaning patients can connect with their doctors by phone or video chat.
Every year we’re adding new services to the list of what can be covered by #Medicare via #telehealth. This year, that includes prolonged preventive services, which includes wellness exams for patients with complex needs.  #HospitalSummit2018
Wound care, mental health counseling, questions &amp; challenges related to medication adherence, lifestyle coaching, these are all areas in which #telehealth is being used to improve care for patients &amp; helping providers deliver value to their patients. #HospitalSummit2018
But #telehealth is not just a #ruralhealth issue—anyone who has faced DC traffic understands that people living in cities could benefit from virtual access to care. #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
As part of our #RuralHealth Strategy, advancing #telehealth and #telemedicine was identified as one of our five primary objectives.
#Telehealth has especially provided a lifeline in rural areas that are characterized by great distances and a limited number of healthcare providers and specialty services. #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
The MyHealthEdata Initiative, led by Jared Kushner and the @WhiteHouse Office of Innovation, takes a comprehensive approach to ensuring that patients control their health information throughout their healthcare journey.  #HospitalSummit2018
Fostering innovation is a priority for me, and an example is our focus on interoperability through the #MyHealthEData initiative.  #HospitalSummit2018
While we’re on track for healthcare costs to represent one out of every five dollars of American GDP by 2026, it’s technology that will help ensure the sustainability of our healthcare system. #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
Technology is also connecting patients to their doctors, even outside of the hospital setting, with devices like new glucose monitors, which we just approved, that can continually monitor vital signs and relay them to a practitioner. #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
Healthcare innovation is in fact serving as a catalyst to improving quality of care, enhancing access to care, increasing efficiency in the system, and lowering healthcare costs. #HospitalSummit2018
We understand that relentless innovation is a crucial driver in creating value across all industries.  As Thomas Edison noted, “There’s always a way to do it better—find it.”  Healthcare, of course, is no exception. #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
When we start paying for value, we will foster innovation as providers look for ways to compete for patients by providing the highest quality care at the lowest cost.  #TelehealthPolicyForum #HospitalSummit2018
#Telehealth is part of @CMSGov’s larger vision of moving to a system that is value based, that rewards value over volume by bringing the best to patients.  #HospitalSummit2018
Excited to be at the @ConnectwCare #TelehealthPolicyForum to share insights on how @CMSGov is driving #innovation, #telehealth and #telemedicine through its policies and programs. You can tune in here: https://t.co/NiFA9PorjU
For those impacted by the #wildfires in California, @CMSGov is temporarily waiving or modifying certain #Medicare, #Medicaid, &amp; #CHIP requirements, enrollment opportunities for healthcare access &amp; ensuring dialysis patients obtain critical services. https://t.co/huciOwB8Ld
In response to the public health emergency declared by @SecAzar, @CMSGov has taken several actions to provide immediate relief to those impacted by the #wildfires in California &amp; ensure healthcare providers, facilities, &amp; suppliers are able to provide continued access to care.

Thank you to everyone who joined me at #BPC4 this afternoon! https://t.co/UOg6uuIdST https://t.co/DdV0sUq8uS
All of our initiatives are ambitious, but we are not stopping here.  Expect more from us in the coming weeks &amp; months, as we continue to execute on @POTUS’s blueprint, including to encourage value-based purchasing. #Biopharma #BPC4
I applaud #Michigan’s proposal. As we see innovation in biomedicine, it is incumbent on us to also modernize payment policies. #TransformingMedicaid #BPC4
This is the 2nd proposal of its kind that @CMSGov has approved, following a similar waiver from #Oklahoma this summer. #Michigan’s waiver will empower the state to demand results from drug manufacturers in exchange for paying for medicines. #TransformingMedicaid #BPC4
I’m honored to announce that today @CMSGov is approving a proposal from #Michigan to enable the state’s #Medicaid program to enter into value-based payment arrangements with drug manufacturers.  #TransformingMedicaid #BPC4
This administration is committed to ensuring that seniors are getting the best deal possible in all therapeutic classes, including in the protected classes.  #StrengtheningMedicare #BPC4
The IPI model would, for the very first time, introduce competition in #Medicare #PartB. Now, in #PartD, private plans are already negotiating with manufacturers, &amp; plans are keeping premiums down.  #StrengtheningMedicare #BPC4
That could mean that a senior receiving a medicine that costs #Medicare $1,800 a month but costs other countries just $300 a month would see their annual coinsurance drop from $4,400 a year to just $900 a year. #BPC4
The IPI model would generate savings of 30% for beneficiaries &amp; taxpayers, for total savings of up to $17.2 billion over five years.  Beneficiaries would potentially see lower #PartB &amp; #Medigap premiums, &amp; lower cost sharing on the order of $3.4 billion. #Biopharma #BPC4
In response to these issues, the IPI model offers a fair and sustainable approach to drug payment in #PartB, because it is time for #Medicare to be a smarter purchaser. Our nation depends on it. #BPC4 #Biopharma #StrengtheningMedicare
The problem is particularly serious when you think of new gene therapies coming on the market, many that will be physician-administered, with prices approaching half a million or even a million dollars or more.  #Biopharma
As drug prices continue to rise, accepting the sales price is not sustainable for the millions who depend on #PartB; the number of our #Medicare enrollees is projected to grow by 16 million in the next ten years – from 53 million enrollees today to 69 million in 2027. #BPC4
Drug pricing is a particularly acute issue for @CMSGov. Combined, #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid represent 40% of the U.S. drug market, &amp; we’re the largest purchaser of prescription drugs on the planet. #BPC4
In May, @POTUS released the historic American Patients First Blueprint, which was the most sweeping set of policies to lower drug prices ever proposed by an Administration. @CMSGov has been hard at work to make @POTUS &amp; @SecAzar’s vision a reality. #BPC4

Today’s rule changes the Quality Payment Program (QPP) to reduce clinician burden, focus on outcomes, and promote interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs). https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
.@CMSGov is moving the E/M coding from 5 to 3 levels in 2021, keeping a separate level for patients with the most complex care needs. https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
We will be delaying implementation of E/M coding reforms to give time for providers to prepare and for us to continue working with the medical community. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
.@CMSGov is modernizing #Medicare &amp; restoring the doctor-patient relationship by streamlining the system of E/M codes- one of the most significant #burdenreduction actions for providers by any administration. https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
.@CMSGov is taking action w/ our Physician Fee Schedule rule to lower the burden associated w/ billing for E/M visits so physicians can increase the amount of time they have w/ their patients. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
.@CMSGov’s QPP &amp; PFS rule delivers on @POTUS’s commitment to lowering prescription drug costs. Payment for new drugs under Part B will more closely match the actual cost of the drug, reducing the amount seniors have to pay out-of-pocket.  https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
In response to concerns raised on the proposal, the final rule includes revisions for complex patients, equalize certain payments for primary and specialty care, &amp; allow for continued stakeholder engagement. https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
Coding requirements for E/M visits had not been updated in 20 years &amp; are contributing to burnout in the medical profession, detracting from patient care. This rule addresses these longstanding issues. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
For the 1st time, Medicare will pay for virtual consultations between physicians, evaluation of remote pre-recorded images &amp; video, &amp; an expanded list of telehealth services- saving beneficiaries from the burden of unnecessary travel to the doctor’s office https://t.co/F0neVzC11z
Today, @CMSGov finalized the 2019 Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) &amp; Quality Payment Program (QPP) rule that addresses provider burnout &amp; provides clinicians immediate relief from excessive paperwork due to outdated billing practices. https://t.co/F0neVzC11z

Did I get your attention? Good. Medicare for All isn’t a joke. It’s a multi-trillion dollar drain on the American economy that will bankrupt future generations. It’s government controlled health care that will strip choice away from millions. It’s a bad idea. And it IS scary.
As we begin to implement payments for home infusion therapy services, we continue to seek further comments on potential effects on access to care. #StrengtheningMedicare

Despite the unrealistic doomsday scenarios, one thing is clear: States know better than the Federal government what their markets need. We are giving them the flexibility to offer more Americans high quality, affordable healthcare that fits THEIR needs.
The reality, after numerous claims of “sabotage” by many (many who also made false positive predictions about Obamacare), under our watch we’ve delivered the highest Exchange consumer satisfaction rate, insurer participation is rising, and PREMIUMS ARE GOING DOWN
Fact check: When @POTUS came to office, he inherited a mess in the market. Premiums were skyrocketing,’ insurers were leaving. Premiums were not “contained,” but were, in fact, pricing millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions, out of the market. https://t.co/BsLEeWLZ18

By contrast, under the leadership of @POTUS, today’s proposed regulation represents the latest in series of strong steps-including new guidance @CMSGov released yesterday expanding state flexibility—to improve affordability &amp; strengthen the individual market for all Americans.
The previous administration let premiums skyrocket for people, including those with pre-existing conditions, &amp; never took action to help the millions who were priced out of the market.
The Trump Administration took another important step today to deliver on @POTUS’s commitment to give Americans more affordable health care choices by issuing a proposed rule to allow employers to fund individual market coverage for employees pre-tax.
Forcing Americans into high-priced ACA plans because the Federal Government knows what’s good for them has forced millions of Americans to the sidelines. It’s time to give them better options &amp; allow states to innovate. #StateInnovation
What does make sense is giving Americans more choices, and the tools they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. #StateInnovation
We have suffered through the broken promises of Obamacare, and now those same voices are crying out for even more government control. It doesn’t make sense.
It’s disappointing that so many healthcare “advocates” don’t trust the American people to know what is right for them and their families. @CMSGov is giving states their voice back. #StateInnovation
With millions of Americans priced out of the ACA Markets, it is our responsibility to find affordable options for them. Americans can and should be trusted to make healthcare decisions for themselves. #StateInnovation
In fact, pre-existing condition protections are not waivable provisions under the statute itself &amp; no state waivers that would alter or erode pre-existing conditions protections can or will be approved.
Nothing about the new flexibilities issued in the State Relief &amp; Empowerment Waivers’s guidance would allow states to erode protections for pre-existing conditions.
State Relief &amp; Empowerment Waivers aim to give states new flexibilities to develop solutions that would not be possible under the ACA’s highly restrictive approach.
.@CMSGov’s State Relief &amp; Empowerment Waivers is a direct response to the severe deterioration of the individual health insurance market in a number of states, where premiums have skyrocketed, choice has diminished, &amp; enrollees have fled the market by the millions.
During #MedicareOE, people with #Medicare can take advantage of eMedicare enhancements such as an improved online coverage wizard to help compare options between Original Medicare &amp; #MedicareAdvantage. #StrengtheningMedicare  https://t.co/A9tlrbLdm5 https://t.co/s6J4IJVzA2

Together we can modernize our payment systems to ensure sustainability, encourage access, &amp; foster competition, which will lead to lower prices.  That way all Americans will benefit from 21st century advancements in biomedicine.
There are additional steps we will be taking in #PartD to strengthen negotiations &amp; get a better deal for beneficiaries. #PartDPricing #StrengtheningMedicare
When drugs are as expensive as some of the new gene therapies are, we absolutely must hold manufacturers accountable for outcomes.
At a time when health care costs are rising, our Administration has proudly announced that #PartD premiums decreased this year &amp; we expect that they will decrease again next year. #PartDPricing

Thank you to all those at the #WEDINational for allowing me to share @CMSGov’s vision of a data revolution &amp; how we are driving innovation today! #MyHealthEData
#Interoperability &amp; data will revolutionize our health care system. @CMSGov is doing its part. We hope you will join us. #WEDINational #MyHealthEData
Imagine if, in turn, your doctor didn’t have to spend so much time faxing records, manually inputting data &amp; staring at a computer during an appointment. #WEDINational
As we look to the future, imagine a world in which your health data follows you wherever you go &amp; you can share that data with your doctor in a useful, usable format at the push of a button. #WEDINational
We take privacy &amp; security very seriously, &amp; we ensure that those we regulate do as well, but I can assure you, that is no reason to keep data from a patient, or withhold that data when it is needed for treatment purposes. #WEDINational
.@CMSGov, we put privacy, security &amp; safety above all else. Our #BlueButton apps are individually vetted to ensure certain privacy &amp; security criteria are met. #WEDINational
.@CMSGov is leading by example on #MyHealthEData by releasing more data &amp; taking action to drive #interoperability &amp; patient control of their data. We are calling on industry to step up to the challenge.
As part of this effort, @CMSGov is participating in HL7’s Da Vinci Project, &amp; through this effort we are digitizing our prior authorization &amp; documentation rules, making it easier for providers to locate the information they need to provide care. #WEDINational
As part of @POTUS’s “Cut the Red Tape” initiative, @CMSGov launched #PatientsOverPaperwork in an effort to reduce unnecessary burden, to increase efficiencies, &amp; to improve the clinician &amp; beneficiary experience. #WEDINational
.@CMSGov is doing its part to make this dataquake a reality, &amp; we are looking to industry to pick up our lead by taking that data &amp; transforming it into usable information that will change the face of health care in the United States.
In preparation for #MedicareOE – which began this week – @CMSGov made improvements the https://t.co/P0w682bW7W website to help beneficiaries compare options &amp; decide if Original #Medicare or #MedicareAdvantage is the right choice for them. #WEDINational
Liberating this data will drive innovation throughout the entire health care system &amp; create new tools &amp; solutions that will allow the system to deliver value to patients. #WEDINational #MyHealthEData
To help spur innovation in this era of digital health, @CMSGov has unleashed a dataquake, releasing unprecedented amounts of data for public use. #MyHealthEData
The possibilities are endless, &amp; we’re just beginning to see what this data can do once it is made available to patients in an innovative &amp; useful format. #WEDINational #MyHealthEData
If we could eliminate the fax by replacing it with more efficient &amp; effective technologies, we would change the way in which doctors communicate and coordinate care for their patients &amp; save them the time spent on manual entry of this data. #WEDINational
I recently made a remark about how we could make every doctor’s office a fax free zone, &amp; you wouldn’t believe the support we have gotten to make that happen. #WEDINational
We can go online &amp; book our travel, not just airline tickets, but a rental car &amp; hotel from a single aggregator site. It’s a one-stop shop! But we don’t have the same expectations in health care. #WEDINational
Excited to be at #WEDINational to talk about data &amp; innovation in our healthcare system!
Looking forward to speaking at #WEDINational in less than one hour! Be sure to check back here for LIVE speech highlights!

The solution to our problems is right in front of us, &amp; it’s all of us coming together, not relying on the government, to transform our health care system to make it more sustainable for today &amp; for future generations. #AHIPMMD
We need to come together as a healthcare community &amp; focus on the drivers of our skyrocketing healthcare costs:  Drug pricing, lack of interoperability, overly-burdensome regulations, &amp; inefficiencies that are jeopardizing our status as the premier healthcare system in the world.
We have empowered seniors with more choices, increased transparency  introduced a better customer service experience, but problems in Medicare still persist. #AHIPMMD
We’ve made tremendous strides in #Medicare this year. Medicare Advantage plans this year will offer seniors more benefits, at lower costs. #AHIPMMD
We are taking a closer look at VBID to see how we could lift additional barriers so that plans can better meet patient needs, to lower drug costs for patients and so that plan incentives are aligned with beneficiary incentives.  	#AHIPMMD
We have seen the potential for Medicare Advantage plans to innovate in response to consumers' needs.  The Value-Based Insurance Design or VBID model tests particular flexibilities for Medicare Advantage plans.  #AHIPMMD
.@CMSGov projects that our final rules &amp; current proposals will eliminate more than 53 million hours of burden for providers &amp; save our healthcare system close to $5.2 billion in the next four years. #AHIPMMD
Every hour saved from reducing needless administrative burden is an hour more that our healthcare system can spend improving Americans’ health outcomes &amp; reducing costs. #AHIPMMD
As a part of @POTUS’s Cut the Red Tape Initiative, @CMSGov launched our #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative to reduce unnecessary &amp; redundant regulations that impact the entire health care delivery system by reducing efficiency &amp; increasing costs. #AHIPMMD
History shows us that the way forward is to go a completely different direction…to put patients, not government, at the center of reform…to promote competition and choice and value. #AHIPMMD #MedicareForAll
If government-run care eliminates choices and narrows provider networks, the answer is not a single-payer system where essentially everyone has the same plan and it takes Congress to deliver new benefits. #AHIPMMD #MedicareForAll
If government-run, one-size-fits-all programs are the reason for skyrocketing premiums, the answer is not to put everyone on a government plan. #MedicareforAll #AHIPMMD
Their solution is literally to do more of what’s not working. It’s like the man who has a pounding headache, who then takes a hammer to his head to make it go away. #AHIPMMD #MedicareForAll
The reason people are calling for Medicare for All is not because the ACA has worked in remedying what ails our system, but because it has not. #AHIPMMD #MedicareForAll
Medical innovation would take a back seat. We would give up our status as the world’s leader in medical innovation. Placing every American under a system where an act of Congress is required to add benefits or make routine changes. #AHIPMMD #MedicareForAll
Empowering Americans to make choices for themselves about what they purchase &amp; how much they’re willing to pay for it, will lead to the market responding, &amp; will force providers to increase the quality &amp; coordination of their care at increasingly lower costs. #AHIPMMD
But to make matters worse, it would destroy Medicare for the seniors who have spent their whole life paying into it. A promise made to those who paid for it would become an entitlement for all, destroying an important program for those it was intended for. #AHIPMMD
After generations of government policy-makers failing to produce the results our system not only requires, but also demands, this Administration is taking a new approach: putting patients at the center of our healthcare system. #AHIPMMD
If implemented by 2022, Medicare for All would mean healthcare spending would take up 58 percent of federal spending, compared to 28 percent today. #AHIPMMD
Under “Medicare for All” you either take private insurance away from those 170 million Americans, or greatly restrict access to it, meaning there is no relief valve for physicians facing up to 40 percent payment cuts. #AHIPMMD
We need to start talking about how to move to a value-based care healthcare system, one in which we pay for the value of a service rather than the mere volume of services. #AHIPMMD
Doctors receive less from their Medicare reimbursement than they do from private insurance for the same services. In essence, 170 million Americans in private insurance subsidize the care provided to 60 million Americans in Medicare. #AHIPMMD
When the same voices clamoring for “Medicare for All” promised the ACA would lower costs, allow you to keep your doctor and your plan …and none of that has proven to be true…then I think we have to pay attention to that. #AHIPMMD
On top of that, this year people living in more than half of all counties across America have access to just one insurer, which is essentially no choice at all. #AHIPMMD
The ACA didn’t live up to its promise of preserving your plan or your doctor, as an estimated 4.7 million Americans saw their plans canceled in the first year. #AHIPMMD
Whether you supported the ACA or not…there are certain results since implementation that are simply, observable fact.  After the law forced people to buy a one-size-fits-all government designed health plan, premiums increased drastically. #AHIPMMD
If you find yourself skeptical about the negatives of more government control, just look at the history of Obamacare. #AHIPMMD
Unfortunately, some are still clamoring for a single-payer, government-run system, euphemistically called Medicare for All. 	 	I find it ironic that in the face of the facts – people, whom I assume are well-meaning, are calling for more government healthcare. #AHIPMMD
"In fact, for the very first time in the program’s history, they are set to go down slightly, &amp; insurers are re-entering markets they abandoned in individual states." #AHIPMMD
"Now, with the Trump Administration’s Market Stabilization Rule, getting rid of the individual mandate, &amp; providing waivers to states, along with other steps implemented by @POTUS, it is true we have stabilized premiums in the exchange." #AHIPMMD
History clearly shows us that when government becomes central to the delivery of care…when its edicts and mandates chase insurers out of the market, and doctors out of networks… that care costs more to deliver, quality diminishes, and patients wait longer for it. #AHIPMMD
We also lack adequate legal authority to do the types of prior authorization reviews that have become routine in the private sector, leading to a high frequency of improper payments, and more fraud and abuse. #AHIPMMD
We review less than two tenths of a percent of the over 1 billion claims that Medicare receives a year.  Given the scope and size of the #Medicare program, that is ridiculously low.  #AHIPMMD
The #Medicare program has extremely low administrative costs, but this isn’t exactly something to brag about.  The reality is we aren’t focusing enough on critical program oversight functions like medical reviews of claims.
Advocates of government-run health care like to point to #Medicare’s low administrative costs…a sort of wink and nod to the idea if you remove profit motive, it costs less to administer healthcare. Well, I don’t buy it.
In addition to misaligned incentives, #Medicare also suffers from inadequate oversight of fraud and abuse, &amp; I can tell you that I am personally committed to improvement in this area.  #AHIPMMD
#Medicare's payment for physician administered drugs in Part B presents additional examples of misaligned incentives.  Under current law, Medicare is a price taker for these drugs &amp; does not negotiate at all. #AHIPMMD
#Medicare faces many issues, including a slow response to new innovations, misaligned financial incentives that work to increase costs for taxpayers and beneficiaries, and challenges with fraud and abuse. All of these problems threaten the solvency of the entire program.
There has been a lot of talk about #MedicareForAll.  But we only have to look at some of Medicare’s major problems to know,  it’s a bad idea. #AHIPMMD
This means that patient cost sharing can vary by location, for the exact same service. This is not fair to patients or taxpayers. It is also a prime example of #Medicare’s misaligned financial incentives.#AHIPMMD
We have more than a dozen different payment systems in Fee For Service #Medicare, meaning we can pay vastly different amounts for the same service, depending on the site of care. #AHIPMMD
We made changes to the #Medicare Prescription Drug program to allow for greater use of lower-cost generic drugs &amp; biosimilars, to lower costs for our beneficiaries &amp; promote innovation in these markets. #AHIPMMD
For the first time, #MedicareAdvantage plans can now take advantage of an approach developed in the private sector known as "step therapy" to ensure that patients get the highest quality &amp; lowest costs for physician-administered drugs.
Under the @POTUS’s leadership, we have been intensely focused on giving plans greater flexibility to negotiate drug prices. #AHIPMMD
#MedicareAdvantage represents value for our beneficiaries &amp; taxpayers.  @CMSGov provides a budget for plans, &amp; plans structure competitive benefit packages within this capitated structure.  #AHIPMMD
As #OpenEnrollment gets underway this year, we’re projecting all-time record enrollment of 22.6 million beneficiaries for 2019. We’re excited to see this growth in MA enrollment – a projected increase of 11.5% this year.  #AHIPMMD
.@POTUS is committed to preserving and strengthening Medicare for the people the program serves, &amp; every action we take at @CMSGov has been aimed at delivering on our nations’ promise to provide high quality services to seniors. #AHIPMMD

Although the #RuralHealthStrategy was only released a few months ago, our work on the strategy is already underway throughout our Offices &amp; Centers.
In May 2018, @CMSGov released the agency’s first #RuralHealthStrategy intended to provide a proactive approach on healthcare issues to ensure that the nearly 1 in 5 individuals who live in rural America have access to high quality, affordable healthcare.
We understand that creating networks in rural communities can be challenging. That is why, for the first time, @CMSGov is organizing &amp; focusing our efforts to apply a #RuralHealthStrategy to the vision &amp; work of the agency.
We are working to ensure all rural consumers have adequate network coverage in their communities. #RuralHealthStrategy
.@CMSGov recognizes the many obstacles that rural Americans face, including living in communities with disproportionally higher poverty rates, having more chronic conditions &amp; being uninsured or underinsured.

Ideas like, “Medicare for All” would only serve to hurt and divert focus from seniors.  All the while, expanding the regulatory burden and misaligned and perverse incentives of a government run system.
Putting millions more Americans on Medicare will undermine health care for the very demographic the program is designed to assist. Medicare for all would become MEDICARE FOR NONE.
By proposing to expand the services offered by Medicare to every American, “Medicare for all” would further strain Medicare’s funding streams and run the risk of depriving seniors of the coverage they have worked their entire lives to receive.

Good article! #TransformingMedicaid 		https://t.co/4HGm9Pzavi
"Prosperity can never be handed out as a government benefit, but our programs can play an important part in helping people get off the sidelines of American life and find independence and a sense of purpose."
https://t.co/qb5jKlGyvI
"Because we recognize that what works in Montana won't be a good fit for Rhode Island, but we can all learn from our individual &amp; shared experiences." #MedicaidManagedCareBRI #TransformingMedicaid
"We must foster greater collaboration among, and between, state agencies, providers, advocates, and beneficiaries - to chart a path forward."
"As a part of our #MyHealthEData Initiative, we have called on everyone who holds patient data, whether it be hospitals, insurers, or Medicaid Managed Care Plans, to give patients control of their records, so that they can be the chief drivers of value in our healthcare system."
"@CMSGov will begin targeted audits to ensure that provider claims for actual health care spending matches what the health plans are reporting financially." #MedicaidManagedCareBRI
"This includes both state &amp; federal performance measures in areas like the speed of processing managed care rate reviews or state plan amendments." #MedicaidManagedCareBRI
"In addition to displaying health outcome &amp; quality metrics in areas like well-child visits &amp; chronic health conditions, you’ll see for the first time public reporting on our administrative performance."
"As we drive toward value across the entire health care delivery system, we believe greater transparency breeds greater accountability, &amp; we were very excited earlier this summer to publish the first-ever Medicaid &amp; CHIP Scorecard."
”Even the Children’s Health Insurance Program – or CHIP - allows states to impose premiums and consequences for failure to pay them in certain circumstances.”
”CMS has approved demonstrations that include those exact type of incentives for failure to comply with requirements like monthly premiums going back across several federal administrations.”
“Some believe that any consequences for failing to comply with a program requirement, like disenrollment or periods of non-eligibility, shouldn’t be allowed. There is no basis for that contention."
There is dignity and pride that is derived from work, for paying one’s own way, and I believe it is the desire of nearly every American to achieve financial independence. #MedicaidManagedCareBRI #TransformingMedicaid
One of the most encouraging outcomes that I’ve seen emerge in states participating in this initiative is the level of engagement &amp; partnership spurred by these waivers. #MedicaidManagedCareBRI #TransformingMedicaid
We want the economy to lift up as many Americans as possible, and lift millions off of programs like Medicaid and instead onto private insurance.  #MedicaidManagedCareBRI #TransformingMedicaid
I prefer to think of it more like President Reagan, who said, “We should measure welfare’s success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many are added.”
Some have argued that a Medicaid demonstration can never advance the program’s objectives if the project ultimately reduces #Medicaid enrollment or spending.
.@POTUS's administration has created a booming American economy. Not only are job opportunities on the rise, but wages grew at the fastest rate in August since the Great Recession.
Under @POTUS's leadership, we are now experiencing among the lowest rates of unemployment we’ve seen in over 50 years.
It’s easier to give someone a card, it’s much harder to build a ladder to help people climb their way out of poverty. But even though it is harder, it’s the right thing to do.
Community engagement requirements are not some subversive attempt to just kick people off of #Medicaid. Instead, their aim is to put beneficiaries in control with the right incentives to live healthier independent lives.
To quote @ArthurBrooks book: “Work gives people something welfare never can. It’s a sense of self-worth &amp; mastery, the feeling that we are in control of our lives. This is a source of abiding joy. There’s a reason that Aristotle wrote, “Happiness belongs to the self-sufficient.“
.@ArthurBrooks of the @AEI wrote a book about the concept of earned success. The idea that we value what we earn much more than we value what is given to us. The drive to earn propels us to new heights whereas dependency limits us.
Compassion is about giving people the tools of self-sufficiency, allowing able-bodied, working age adults to experience the dignity of a job, of contributing to their own care, and gaining a foothold on the path to independence.
It is not compassionate to trap people on government programs, or create greater dependency on public assistance as we expand programs like Medicaid. #TransformingMedicaid
In January, we released a groundbreaking new demonstration opportunity in response to state requests to test work &amp; community engagement incentives among able-bodied adult beneficiaries. #MedicaidManagedCareBRI

.@CMSGov will continue our efforts to eliminate unnecessary regulations that take providers away from patients and stifle innovation. #PatientsOverPaperwork
I thank @POTUS, for his leadership and commitment to reducing regulations, &amp; @SecAzar’s commitment to moving our healthcare system towards providing value for patients.  #PatientsOverPaperwork
Between 2018 and 2021, @CMSGov now projects the #PatientsOverPaperwork initiative to eliminate more than 53 million hours of burden for providers and save our healthcare system close to $5.2 billion, over the next three years.
Today’s rule would produce an additional $1.12 billion in savings every year, on top of savings already achieved as part of the #PatientsOverPaperwork initiative that we started last year.
Today’s rule is intended to ease the burden of regulation, while ensuring that we maintain a focus on integrity, quality and safety.  #PatientsOverPaperwork
Today, I am pleased to announce we are proposing a new rule that will make changes across the health care delivery system from hospitals, to surgery centers, transplants center, hospices, mental health centers &amp; many more.  #PatientsOverPaperwork
We have made it clear that patients own their medical record and have made significant changes to make interoperability of the health care system a reality. #PatientsOverPaperwork
Specifically, we heard that many of our quality measurements weren’t meaningful in actually measuring quality, so as a part of the #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative, we revamped our quality measurements, and have called our new program Meaningful Measurements.
Instead many of them were actually having a negative effect: keeping patients from the care that they need and decreasing patient safety by taking providers away from caring for their patients.
.@CMSGov listened and what we heard was that, not only were many of our regulations not contributing to improving patient health outcomes, or improving quality of care and patient safety
In total, the @CMSGov team conducted 21 site visits, nearly 300 customer interviews, 97 subject matter expert interviews, and held 73 listening sessions around the country. #PatientsOverPaperwork
I knew that it was important for us to hear from those living under our regulations to see which ones were valuable &amp; which ones were redundant, topped out, or weren’t positively impacting patient care, patient safety, or program integrity.
We all know that at times regulations can get in the way of innovation – which can actually drive up costs, and the rising costs of our healthcare system are unsustainable. #PatientsOverPaperwork
.@CMSGov conditions of participation require providers to have processes in place to guide them in times of disaster &amp; ensure patient safety, which are very relevant today as providers in NC, SC, &amp; VA will hopefully be better prepared to keep patients safe. #PatientsOverPaperwork
At @CMSGov, we took @POTUS’s directive and created our #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative last year, and today I want to highlight some of our key accomplishments as well as make a new announcement.
Upon taking office, @POTUS made reducing burdensome regulations across the federal government a top priority, establishing his “Cut the Red Tape Initiative”. #PatientsOverPaperwork
We have issued a number of waivers in VA, NC and SC around deadlines, quality reporting and certification requirements. Our teams are working around the clock and will continue to do so as long as needed.
Following a natural disaster, @CMSGov works diligently with @HHSGov and @FEMA to make sure that our beneficiaries have access to the care they need &amp; we work w/providers on the ground to make sure that regulations don’t get in the way of providing critical care to patients.
@JamesLSwann 🤫
.@CMSGov’s #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative is vital in moving our healthcare delivery system towards one that provides value for patients. Every hour saved by #ReducingBurden is an hour more that our healthcare professionals can spend improving Americans’ health outcomes.
We consistently hear from providers that time they spend complying w/ unnecessary &amp; outdated regulations interferes w/ providing high-quality care. We are working to remove unnecessary regulations where the costs exceed the benefits to patients &amp; providers #PatientsOverPaperwork https://t.co/Wu4ghn2a7Y
.@CMSgov is taking action to help physicians reduce the number of hours they spend on paperwork. We are committed to reducing the number of dollars &amp; hours wasted on excessively burdensome regulations that don’t improve patient care. #PatientsOverPaperwork #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/AE84DQQVUM
Across @CMSgov we strive to empower providers to deliver high quality care. That is why it is critical to reform our #healthcare system in a way that protects patient safety &amp; supports improved patient outcomes. #StrengtheningMedicare #PatientsOverPaperwork https://t.co/O5KWU2IK15

1/3: Last month, @CMSGov took a historic step to address drug pricing issues in #PartB with respect to #MedicareAdvantage plans. #FTPharmaPricing
.@CMSGov intends to give #PartD plans more leverage in their negotiations and more flexibility in their benefit design, so that they can continue to drive towards lower costs and higher quality for our beneficiaries. #FTPharmaPricing #LowerDrugPrices
At a time when premiums are rising in virtually every form of health insurance, our Administration has proudly announced that #PartD premiums decreased this year and will decrease again next year. #FTPharmaPricing #LowerDrugPrices
#PartD is a market-based system- prescription drug plans compete for beneficiaries. History teaches us that competitive pressures drive towards greater value. #FTPharmaPricing #EmpoweringPatients #LowerDrugPrices
Generic Competition is critical, and @CMSGov applauds the outstanding work that the @US_FDA has done, under the leadership of Commissioner @SGottliebFDA, to accelerate the approval of general and biosimilar products. #FTPharmaPricing
To address the steep price tags of prescription drugs, earlier this year @POTUS and @SecAzar outlined the most sweeping set of policies to #LowerDrugPrices ever proposed by an administration, in the American Patients First Blueprint #FTPharmaPricing
Innovation cannot be an excuse for exploitation. Prices must come down so that all Americans can benefit. #FTPharmaPricing
Lowering the cost of prescription drugs isn’t just something we would like to do; it is something that we must do #FTPharmaPricing #StrengtheningMedicare #LowerDrugPrices
In #Medicare, in the aggregate, spending on prescription drugs is growing faster than spending on any other area #FTPharmaPricing
America is the world’s leader in biopharmaceutical innovation, but life-saving medicines do not mean anything if patients cannot afford them #FTPharmaPricing
Just arrived at #FTPharmaPricing at the Time Warner Center! Eagerly awaiting to get on stage and discuss how we are lowering prescription drug prices.
“As for the CEO, those who market medical products should show regard for patients”- I totally agree! We need to put patients first. https://t.co/A9z3KaN6pu
I’m excited by the partnerships that Arkansas has fostered to connect Medicaid beneficiaries to work and educational opportunities, and I look forward to our continued collaboration as we thoroughly evaluate the results of their innovative reforms. #TransformingMedicaid

@SarahKarlin @SGottliebFDA I’m out of town all week - there will be no “Seema Swapping”
Together we can modernize our payment systems to ensure sustainability, encourage access, and foster competition, which will lead to lower prices. That way all Americans will benefit from 21st century advancements in biomedicine. #GRxBiosims
The President’s Blueprint was released on May 11th, and we have been taking steady action since then. #GRxBiosims
The bottom line is that all of the incentives are lined up for manufacturers to set higher and higher prices.  But patients usually pay their cost sharing or coinsurance off of this list price, meaning they are having to pay more. #GRxBiosims
Rebates are calculated as a percentage of the manufacturer’s “list price.”  Therefore, the higher the manufacturer’s list price, the larger the rebate will be.  And the higher the rebate, the more money that plans and PBMs get. #GRxBiosims
Another practice that we are examining is the practice of manufacturer rebates. Plans hire PBMs to manage their drug benefit and negotiate with drug manufacturers. PBMs do this by extracting rebates from manufacturers in exchange for putting their drugs on the formulary.
@CMSGov sent a letter explaining that “CMS finds any form of gag clauses unacceptable and contrary to our efforts to promote drug price transparency and lower drug prices.” I applaud @SenatorCollins on the bill she introduced that would end the practice altogether.
One practice that some plans undertake, which I find completely unacceptable, is the imposition of “gag clauses.” #GRxBiosims
The problem of high drug prices is a multi-faceted one, and no single actor is to blame.  CMS is examining the entire value chain to identify issues and pinpoint solutions. #GRxBiosims
Part D plans have done a great job in keeping premiums low.  However, while plans can be a powerful negotiator, sometimes it is the case that a plan’s incentives are not completely aligned with the patient’s. #GRxBiosims
This will lower out-of-pocket costs for biosimilars for low-income beneficiaries, thereby removing a barrier to biosimilar use.  @POTUS budget would go even further, with a proposal to eliminate cost sharing altogether for generics and biosimilars for low-income beneficiaries.
Similar to encouraging the uptake of generics, we also want to promote biosimilars.  We changed a policy around biosimilars to advance this goal.  CMS now treats biosimilars as generic drugs for the purposes of determining copays in Part D. #GRxBiosims #Biosimilars
When it comes to empowering Part D plans to encourage generic utilization, CMS is leaving no stone unturned in looking for savings opportunities. #GRxBiosims
CMS intends to give Part D plans more leverage in their negotiations and more flexibility in their benefit design, so that they can continue to drive towards lower costs and higher quality for our beneficiaries. #GRxBiosims
The patient can choose the plan that is best for them, and make trade-offs between costs and quality.  And I assure you that this is better than the government making decisions for them. #GRxBiosims
Rather than a government bureaucracy making every decision for patients, the Part D program protects a patient’s ability to choose the plan that is right for them. #GRxBiosims
I often hear that Medicare should negotiate drug prices with manufacturers.  In response, I have to point out we already have negotiators – and these are the Part D plans, which cover drugs that beneficiaries pick up at a pharmacy. #GRxBiosims
#GRxBiosims https://t.co/kmFhgnspn5
While @US_FDA has been accelerating the introduction of generic and biosimilar products, @CMSGov has been acting in concert to modernize our payment policies to increase competition. #GRxBiosims
This part of Obamacare was a giveaway to drug companies. We must ensure that our policies are creating incentives for lower, and not higher, list prices. (2/2) #GrxBiosims
We have called on Congress to lift the cap imposed by the Affordable Care Act on the total amount of Medicaid rebates that manufacturers pay when they increase their prices. (1/2) #GRxBiosims
CMS is committed to ensuring that manufacturers pay their fair share in Medicaid rebates. #GrxBiosims
In 2017 @US_FDA approved a record number of generic drugs, and July saw the highest number of approvals in history for any single month.  #GRxBiosims
Generic competition is critical, and @CMSGov applauds the outstanding work that the @US_FDA has done, under the leadership of @SGottliebFDA, to accelerate the approval of generic and biosimilar products. #GRxBiosims #Biosimilars
The market for prescription drugs is complex, but we are bringing the same principles of competition and choice that have worked in other markets to tackle challenges in this one. It’s no coincidence that the President’s Blueprint is organized around competition as a key pillar.

Bottom line is, the individual mandate failed—it failed to bring in the young and healthy, and it penalized low and middle-income Americans faced with Obamacare’s skyrocketing premiums and dwindling choices. Choice, competition, and state flexibility = lower premiums.
Instead of burdensome mandates on Americans priced out of health coverage, the Trump administration is helping connect people to more affordable options by expanding access to Association Health Plans and short-term, limited-duration insurance.
The individual mandate penalty is a regressive tax on lower income families; nearly 80% of those who paid the penalty in 2015 made less than $50,000 a year.
The individual mandate unfairly forces people who can’t afford Obamacare’s skyrocketing health insurance premiums to pay a tax penalty—premiums more than doubled between 2013 and 2017 https://t.co/97sexIqPOy
People who buy health insurance in the individual market and don’t get subsidies stand to see the most benefit from the approval of today’s @NJGov 1332 State Innovation Waiver. https://t.co/o8VmgjiQMA
👏 to New Jerseyans, who will see their premiums in the individual market ↓ by about 15% from the expected premiums because @NJGov took action to address the failures of Obamacare. Today, @CMSgov approved NJ’s 1332 State Innovation Waiver. https://t.co/xvX4kcVZLW

Earlier this month we pushed the needle on #interoperability by finalizing our overhaul of the meaningful use programs in the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS final rule #PromotingInteroperability #MyHealthEData
Recently, CMS overhauled the Meaningful Use programs to the “Promoting Interoperability” programs to highlight the change in direction from programs that support the adoption of health IT, to programs that promote interoperability and patient access to data. #MyHealthEData
Great demonstrations by some of our #BBDC18 developers on how they are leveraging @CMSGov data to reduce burden for both the patient and doctor in a safe and secure manner. #MyHealthEData

It's great seeing how developers across the healthcare industry are utilizing @CMSgov data to help beneficiaries. Seeing these app demos make me very excited for the future of healthcare! #BBDC18 #MyHealthEData
But despite those efforts, doctors are faxing patient records, medical staff are manually entering results into EHRs, and hospitals are handing out data on a CD-ROM while the rest of the economy is functioning on fully digitized, integrated data. 2/2 #BBDC18
In 2008, adoption of health IT was limited to 17% of doctors and 9% of hospitals. Today, 78% of doctors and 96% of hospitals use certified health IT. 1/2  #BBDC18
For the first time, every state is providing Medicaid data. We have also released Medicare claims data and we are calling on insurers to provide data as well, and we will reinforce that through regulation in the future. #BBDC18 #VDRC https://t.co/mNU1h1M7Cl

"We can keep patient data private, safe and secure, while also making it available to patients working on leading edge innovations that can transform American medicine.” #InteropForum #Interoperability
"Systems too often refuse to share data because they fear their patients will be poached. This mentality has to be changed because it endangers the health of millions of Americans.” #InteropForum #Interoperability
"Too often, patients are told their data can’t be shared with another provider “for their security.”	But patient security should not be a ruse for what is really happening: patient profiteering.” #InteropFourm
“It’s time for the rest of the industry to do its part. I have called on insurers to begin releasing claims data as we did with Blue Button 2.0, and make data available to the patients that they serve.” #InteropForum #Interoperability
#InteropForum #Interoperability #MyHealthEData https://t.co/g7tIE8oPbz
"As the head of CMS, one of my main missions is to break down any and all barriers to interoperability, and create that one-stop shop for health data that will help inform our health care decisions with a complete picture of our medical history.” #InteropForum #Interoperability
"Now, if my phone knows what podcast I might want to listen to next based on my purchase history, shouldn’t our medical decisions be fully informed by our medical history?” #Interopforum #Interoperability
"As patients, we are used to showing up early for doctors’ appointments and waiting 30 minutes because that’s just the way it is. We are used to our primary care doctor not having all our records from our last PCP and asking us when was the last time we had a tetanus booster."
"The federal government spent over $35 billion on the effort to get doctors to use Electronic Health Records…new technology that is making their work more difficult, not less – causing more physician burden and burnout.” #Interopforum #PatientsOverPaperwork #Interoperability
"But despite the best efforts of innovators, health care providers are in a 1990’s time warp, where doctors are faxing patient records, medical staff are manually entering results into EHRs, and hospitals are handing out data on a CD-ROM.” #InteropFourm #Interoperability
“The United States is a leader across the world with many of our advancements in medical technology.” #InteropForum

@CMSGov's E/M codes proposal is a win-win for providers and patients. It will have a huge positive impact on the doctor-patient relationship. #StrengtheningMedicare
The overall impact of our E/M code proposal will significantly reduce provider burden while remaining budget neutral with most specialties only seeing an up or down impact in the 1 to 2% range. #StrengtheningMedicare
For providers that see the most complex patients, we have also proposed additional E/M code add-on payments to make sure that they are still compensated well for taking care of Medicare recipients. #StrengtheningMedicare
We listened and in response proposed streamlining the documentation requirements for office E/M visits. This proposal is one of the most significant reductions in provider burden ever taken by any administration. #StrengtheningMedicare
We held nation-wide listening sessions and heard from thousands of providers. Three things we kept hearing were how E/M code documentation was needlessly burdensome, wasn’t improving patient care, and was actually having a negative impact on patients. #StrengtheningMedicare
Great article by @kevinbtruong w/ @SFBusinessTimes on how @CMSGov is promoting consumerism in health care &amp; giving patients more control over their health data. https://t.co/THd7DhPwo9
To drive towards value, @CMSgov is finding ways to pay for patient-centered care, not volume of care. #ValueOverVolume
Patient safety is our top priority, so improving our quality programs is critical.  That’s why we’re focused on #MeaningfulMeasures.
Patients should be at the center of cost and quality decisions, and they should have the information they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. #PuttingPatientsFirst
Here at @CMSgov, we’re working to make way for innovation and greater value. By focusing on #MeaningfulMeasures, we’re removing burden for providers while giving patients more useful information. #PatientsOverPaperwork
We are taking significant steps in advancing our #PromotingInteroperability and #MeaningfulMeasures initiatives. More to come.

"As part of @POTUS's Cut the Red Tape Initiative, CMS launched our Patients Over Paperwork Initiative to reduce unnecessary and redundant regulations so that doctors could focus on their primary mission – taking care of their patients.” #PatientsOverPaperwork
"It is clear that our regulations have held back innovation and if we are going to be driving to a system that drives value, lowers costs, and creates better health outcomes, we need to remove barriers that thwart this effort.” #PatientsOverPaperwork
https://t.co/MxK3bdw2P1
"Medicare’s payment incentives are often upside down and until Congress makes changes; CMS is pushing forward by using our Innovation Center to test out new ways of paying for care."
"The system actually rewards providers that provide the most service rather than those that produce value and better health outcomes for the patients they serve."
"And while Medicare Advantage sets up the right financial incentives to deliver value, unfortunately, the rest of Medicare does not."
"This could include modifications to help keep seniors safe in their homes and out of institutions with equipment like wheelchair ramps, stair rails or grab bars; more in-home support services; and respite care for her caregivers."
"Starting in 2019, we’re giving plans more flexibility so they can cover more supplemental benefits, which go beyond the traditional Medicare benefits."
"This administration has worked to support innovation in Medicare Advantage.  We have given plans more flexibility to offer more choices to beneficiaries and rid the plans of burdensome requirements that deterred them from devoting resources to beneficiaries."
"There is no better example of how competition drives value than the Medicare Advantage program. This is a great example of how incentives are aligned to drive competition that increases value for our patients."
"In addition, our proposal would allow patients to text an image to providers for review and we’re expanding the list of Medicare services that can be delivered via telehealth.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"Just recently, CMS proposed to have Medicare start paying for virtual check-ins, meaning patients can connect with their doctors by phone or video chat."
https://t.co/mGQ7DQGvYS
"Electronic Health Records have merely replaced paper silos with electronic ones, while providers, and the patients they serve, still have difficulty obtaining health records."
"Through the CMS Digital Seniors initiative, we are working on a broad set of changes that will enable our seniors to access and navigate the Medicare program more seamlessly, and provide the personalized tools to improve the customer experience."
https://t.co/7OenUGltla

https://t.co/voCse02rQw
"Commercial payers review claims for services before and after the claim is paid. Currently, the Medicare program only reviews less than 3/10 of 1% of the nearly 1.5 billion Medicare claims that CMS pays annually."
“Speaking of fraud, program integrity is also an issue at CMS.  Due to its sheer size, our programs are always vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.  However, as the nation’s largest healthcare payer we have a long way to go to preventing it."
"While Stark is an important anti-fraud protection for Medicare, it was enacted in 1989 and has been interpreted and reinterpreted, and is out dated. It has become a significant barrier to innovative arrangements that drive value."
"Overly burdensome regulations too often stand in the way of providers focusing on innovation and creating value.  One key example is the Physician Self-Referral Law, also known as the Stark Law."
https://t.co/TymHNiecMX
“Many aspects of the program have become detached from its intended purpose: to serve the patient.  For years, money has been poured into a system that is only increasing in complexity and burden, all while the patient has been locked out of the process."
"Despite the burgeoning demand for Medicare services, the reality is the Medicare program is on a troubling trajectory, as decades of neglect by Congress and past administrations have allowed it to travel down a path that is unsustainable."
https://t.co/rqn9A1TcEs
"Healthcare costs are growing faster than the U.S. GDP, making it more difficult with each passing year for CMS to ensure healthcare for generations to come. If we continue on this path, by 2026 our nation will be spending one in every five dollars on healthcare."
"Yet while the volume of care consumed by American patients has not increased dramatically compared to similar economies, the cost of care in the United States has accelerated at an alarming pace."
"Americans enjoy the benefits of the best healthcare providers and innovators in the world.”

Today, @CMSGov issued a memo to plans explaining how they can manage drugs differently for different indications, or different patient conditions, to get the best deal for all types of patients who use a certain prescription. #LowerDrugPrices
.@CMSGov is committed to providing our seniors’ Medicare prescription drug plans the tools that are available in the commercial market to negotiate with drug manufacturers to achieve lower costs for patients. #LowerDrugPrices
Under @POTUS and @SecAzar’s direction, @CMSGov is focused on lowering prescription drug costs. And as outlined in the Administration’s #AmericanPatientsFirst Blueprint, strengthening negotiation is a key strategy for achieving this goal.

Today’s rule will provide more certainty to the market, but still doesn’t fix Obamacare’s underlying flaws that caused premiums to rise 105% since 2013. Ultimately Congress must act to address flaws and create affordable coverage. https://t.co/1aE4G8Z5P7

@JKTGFoundation 2/2: The new proposed payment rules were designed to allow and encourage doctors to spend more time with their patients by including additional payment to physicians when a patient needs more of their time.
@JKTGFoundation We heard from doctors that the amount of time they spend on documentation takes time away from focusing on quality improvement for their patients.
.@MedicareGov sometimes pays vastly different amounts for the SAME service if patients go to a hospital rather than a doctor’s office.  This system does not support patients and needs to change. #StrengtheningMedicare
Site neutrality and price transparency are key enablers of a #healthcare market that drives towards value – where patients have the information they need to choose the providers that are best for them. #PuttingPatientsFirst
When patients have more choices, they win. We’re working to give patients more options to access care so they can choose the care setting that best fits their needs. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/V2KKFjHNLn

Stay tuned for more on this https://t.co/fb4UeqqJkV
On it, Mr. Secretary. We’ve looked into it—generic competition has generated significant savings for Part D &amp; its beneficiaries. You're right that there is more to do. Misaligned incentives &amp; beneficiaries lacking info on generic substitution leave significant savings uncaptured. https://t.co/N3bUFieoAl

.@CMSGov asked for comments on the rule’s proposals to reduce burden to the broadest extent possible while making sure physicians are paid for what their patients need.
Our new proposals work together so a physician can account for extra time spent with a complex patient – this would result in a payment of MORE than they are being paid now for the most highly paid visits (level 5).
.@NYTimes readers should start from the bottom of the article. @CMSGov proposes additional payment to physicians when particular patients need more of their time, w/o additional paperwork requirements. ↓ time on paperwork is ↑ time caring for patients. https://t.co/uRmHjkPGci

Also for 2020, Congress mandated that @Medicaregov stop using the number of therapy visits provided to determine payment, acknowledging that not all patients need the same thing (some have complex needs that don’t involve a lot of therapy).
Later, Congress took action in the Budget Act of 2018 to require @CMSGov to implement certain changes for #HomeHealth:  Instead of paying for 60-day episodes of care, starting in 2020, @Medicaregov is required to pay for 30-day episodes of care.
Last year, @CMSGov proposed a new model for paying for @Medicaregov #HomeHealth care, but we did not finalize it, so we could take time to consider public comments.

The policies in the FY 2019 proposed rules further advance @CMSGov's priority of creating a patient-driven healthcare system w/ greater price transparency, interoperability, &amp; burden reduction to give hospitals &amp; patients the flexibility they need.
Starting in 2019, #Medicare Advantage beneficiaries can get more tailored benefits to their needs, such as help performing daily living activities &amp; more help w/ in-home support services &amp; fall prevention. A great step forward in #StrengtheningMedicare.
From lowering #DrugPricing for beneficiaries, to increasing plan choices and reducing burden for plans &amp; providers, 2019 guidance and rules by @CMSGov are #StrengtheningMedicare.
Medicare is a promise that our nation has made to provide high quality healthcare to those who are eligible for the program.   #StrengtheningMedicare
@CMSGov has been doing everything in its power to lower costs for #Medicare recipients and the Medicare program, as well as giving seniors greater access to innovative drugs and therapies that will save lives and money #StrengtheningMedicare
Our healthcare spending rate continues to grow faster than our overall economy, by 2026, we will be spending 1 in every 5 dollars on healthcare – this means more and more of US household budgets will be spent on premiums, deductibles and copays
However, we have to address the unsustainable growth of healthcare spending because #Obamacare, despite the promises made when it was passed, did not do enough to stop our out of control healthcare spending #StrengtheningMedicare
Another example in @POTUS’ FY19 Budget - Address excessive payments for patients for post-acute care providers by creating a unified payment system based on patients’ clinical needs not site of care: $80.2B in savings over 10 years #StrengtheningMedicare
Here is an example of the savings proposed in @POTUS’ FY19 Budget – Modify #Medicare payments to hospitals for uncompensated care: $138.4B in Medicare savings over 10 years/ $69.5B in net savings to the federal gov’t over 10 years #StrengtheningMedicare

Thank you to the @CMSGov team for your hard work at today’s drug pricing retreat. I am continually amazed by the expertise of the staff and their drive to #LowerDrugPrices. We’re underway in executing on @POTUS’ vision for the American Patients First Blueprint. https://t.co/nK0wdVYQFx
#ICYMI: I announced the many steps @CMSGov is taking to take part in @POTUS’ Initiative to #LowerDrugPrices &amp; improve price transparency, from changes to the #Medicare Part D 340B program to the redesigned Drug Spending Dashboards. Read all about them: https://t.co/i0V7qlEgBG
Patients need to know how much a drug is going to cost when it’s prescribed and what alternatives are available so they can get the best deal possible, no matter what. That’s why we @CMSGov have sent this letter to #Medicare Part D plans: https://t.co/yl7UL3vldG
In the government-wide initiative to #LowerDrugPrices and improve price transparency, see how @CMSGov is doing their part with the release of the newly redesigned Drug Spending Dashboards. https://t.co/0Jy3BScn3t
#MyHealthEData makes it clear that patients should have access &amp; control to share their data with whomever they want, making the patient the center of our #healthcare system. See this blog from @HealthComU: https://t.co/j583FxaZ3A
Our all-day internal drug pricing retreat today is a great opportunity for collaboration. The talented @CMSGov staff is advancing efforts to #LowerDrugPrices https://t.co/o5XuDb34DU
Just started the @CMSGov Drug Pricing Summit! I’m very grateful for all of the collective input from our talented and committed CMS staff! Together we will #LowerDrugPrices for all Americans! https://t.co/JQzWLZF1I0
See how we @CMSGov are working with @POTUS’ American Patients First Blueprint to collaboratively tackle the problem on how to #LowerDrugPrices. https://t.co/tZ11nDNeaG
#DYK: The newly redesigned @CMSGov Drug Spending Dashboards include an expanded list of more than 3,000 drugs for both the #Medicare and #Medicaid programs? The prior release had less than 80 drugs included in each program. For more details: https://t.co/akKtyWTHZr
The @WhiteHouse #MyHealthEData Initiative will create an ecosystem that responds to patient demand for ⬆ quality &amp; ⬇ costs, unleashing innovative technology to create healthier lives &amp; #PuttingPatientsFirst by providing control of their #healthcare info. https://t.co/4ucqPXd8nN

We @CMSGov want to make it clear that any form of “gag clauses” are UNACCEPTABLE.  Gag clauses prevent pharmacists from telling patients when they could pay less &amp; are contrary to our efforts to promote drug price transparency and #LowerDrugPrices.  https://t.co/iikG1FEMHJ
We’re reminding all #Medicare Part D plans of @CMSGov policy that #Medicare enrollees should pay the lesser of the Part D negotiated price or their plan’s copay.  An important step in lowering out-of-pocket costs and #LowerDrugPrices for enrollees. https://t.co/iikG1FEMHJ
Yesterday, as part of @POTUS’ continued efforts to #LowerDrugPrices and promote drug price transparency, @CMSGov reminded #Medicare Part D plans that “gag clauses” are UNACCEPTABLE.  Our actions ensure lower out-of-pocket costs for #Medicare enrollees! https://t.co/Tfs3laMrHT
RT @FLOTUS: A sincere thank you to Walter Reed Medical Unit @WRBethesda &amp; to all who have send good wishes &amp; prayers! I am feeling great &amp;…
#ICYMI: as I stated at #PQAannual, @CMSGov is already making progress in an effort to #LowerDrugPrices with our newly redesigned Drug Spending Dashboards.	https://t.co/vubzoyEJbv https://t.co/gugOnDOks0
It was a pleasure to speak at #PQAannual and engage on how @CMSGov is working on @POTUS’ American Patients First Blueprint to collaboratively tackle the problem on how to #LowerDrugPrices. https://t.co/7FaoDEcT4d
#ICYMI our recently released Part D rule provided important new tools to Part D plans. They can now substitute new generic drugs for branded drugs more quickly on formularies, allowing beneficiaries access to low-cost generics MONTHS earlier. #PQAannual
Competition from generic alternatives can be very effective at lowering drug prices. #DYK just a year after the first generic statin reached the market, the average cost dropped 80% for the generic product? #PQAannual
There is no clearer example of why reform is needed then when our Drug Pricing Dashboards show examples of increases that are double-digit, triple-digit and even quadruple-digit increase. #PQAannual
Thanks to the new redesigned dashboard, the world can now see which manufacturers have ⬆ their prices &amp; for which drugs. The data shows that some of our most commonly used drugs have seen increases of 10% or more each year over the last 5 years. #PQAannual
This week’s release in the @CMSGov Drug Spending Dashboard expands the set of drugs that are reported in the dashboards to include the majority of drugs prescribed in #Medicare &amp; #Medicaid. #PQAannual
#ICYMI: @CMSGov recently announced the new redesigned Drug Spending Dashboard, which highlights year-over-year changes in drug prices over a multi-year period w/ the manufacturers that were responsible for the increases. #PQAannual
Patients need to know how much a drug is going to cost when it’s prescribed and what alternatives are available so they can get the best deal possible. We @CMSGov are working towards helping patients understand all of this. #PQAannual
.@CMSGov is taking bold steps to help patients understand the costs of their medications. We need greater price transparency in ALL of #healthcare so that patients can make the best decisions for them &amp; their families. #PQAannual
Part of @POTUS’ 5-part plan includes providing generic and biosimilar drugs to low-income beneficiaries FOR FREE; &amp; protecting beneficiaries from high costs in the catastrophic phase of Part D. #PQAannual
As part of the initiative, @POTUS’ Budget also calls for an integrated 5-part plan to modernize Part D, designed to be deployed together to drive savings for our seniors &amp; our taxpayers. #PQAannual
With the change of payment in the 340B program, #Medicare beneficiaries – and not just the hospitals – will benefit from the savings of the program. This change is estimated to save Medicare beneficiaries $320 MILLION in drug spending this year alone. #PQAannual
As a result of discounts not being passed on our beneficiaries through the 340B program, @CMSGov reduced the amount that beneficiaries &amp; the federal gov’t will pay hospitals for drugs that they acquire through the program. #PQAannual
#DYK @CMSGov changed its payment rate to hospitals for drugs that they purchase through a program known as 340B that allows certain hospitals to buy drugs at a discounted price. HOWEVER, these discounts were not being passed on to our beneficiaries. #PQAannual
This initiative by @POTUS is about #PuttingPatientsFirst, &amp; ultimately everything we do in this effort is about reducing out-of-pocket spending for our beneficiaries and all Americans. #PQAannual
The US leads the world in developing innovative new therapies &amp; the pharmaceutical industry has brought treatments to the market that are improving/saving lives, &amp; ⬇ #healthcare costs. We support innovation, but it means NOTHING if people can’t afford their meds. #PQAannual
.@CMSgov has been very hard at work to carry out its part in the American Patients First Blueprint. #PQAannual
#ICYMI last week @POTUS announced the American Patients First Blueprint, the most comprehensive &amp; far-reaching set of strategies ever released by an administration to tackle the problem of prescription drug costs. #PQAannual
As @SecAzar has pointed out, #Medicare incentives have ⬆️ list prices for drugs, &amp; this enhanced dashboard is an important step to bringing transparency &amp; accountability to what has been a largely hidden process.	https://t.co/OYCtJPdsKn
Publishing how much individual drugs cost from one year to the next will provide much-needed clarity &amp; will empower patients &amp; doctors with the information they need.	https://t.co/FKeinj1RRD
This PUF file includes summarized info on the more than one MILLION distinct #healthcare providers who prescribed drugs under the #Medicare Part D program in 2016.	https://t.co/YNTY7YY2fU
In addition to the newly redesigned version of the Drug Spending Dashboards, @CMSGov is updating the Part D Prescriber Public Use File (PUF) w/ data for 2016.	https://t.co/jdjsTyO9YC
In 2012, #Medicare spent 17 % of its total budget, or $109 billion, on prescription drugs. Four years later in 2016, spending went ⬆️ to 23%, or $174 billion. https://t.co/a0SQYm0Wol
#DYK: Some of the most commonly used drugs across #Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D, &amp; #Medicaid saw double-digit annual increases over the last few years? https://t.co/a0SQYm0Wol
Under @POTUS’ bold leadership, @CMSGov is committed to #PuttingPatientsFirst and ⬆️ transparency with a newly redesigned version of the Drug Spending Dashboards: https://t.co/a0SQYm0Wol
Excited the enhanced Drug Dashboards are now live! These provide much-needed clarity &amp; will empower patients &amp; doctors with the info they need. 		This is an important step to advance the American Patients First Initiative that @POTUS announced last week. https://t.co/a0SQYm0Wol

Just had a great conversation with @GovJeffColyer. Appreciate all the innovation taking place in his state for #Medicaid beneficiaries. @CMSGov is looking to working with #Kansas on their initiatives to strengthen care.
"The popularity of these programs and with the various new flexibilities and burden reduction changes that have been adopted, we expect plan choices to be even more robust in 2019.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"Medicare Advantage and Part D have never been more popular, proving the value of providing our beneficiaries with choice. We plan to unleash the potential of these programs to the best of our abilities.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"Of course, we recognize that across all of our efforts, we have to look at privacy at the front end and ensure informed consent. Patients must always be aware of how their data is being used and shared. Americans demand this of us."
"Next year, we expect to make the Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program data available. Researchers will now have access to data on another 70 million patients, which represent a different profile as compared to Medicare.”
"I recently announced that, for the very first time, we’ll be releasing Medicare Advantage encounter data to researchers.” #MyHealthEData #StrentheningMedicare
“We strongly encourage, and are considering rulemaking to require, Medicare Advantage to adopt data release platforms.” #StrengtheningMedicare
“I've encouraged the healthcare industry to embrace the notion that patients must have ready access to their health records. I have now repeatedly called on all insurers, including Medicare Advantage plans to do what we’ve done and give patients their claims data electronically."
"But we know we can’t achieve value-based care until we put the patient in the driver’s seat of our healthcare system. And that requires empowering patients with the data they need to make informed decisions as healthcare consumers.”
"Another key priority for @POTUS, @SecAzar, and myself is to move our healthcare system from one that pays for procedures and sickness to one that is value-based — one that rewards outcomes over mere volume.”
"In addition to reducing costs for beneficiaries, this policy alone is expected to generate savings to the Medicare program of $10 million in 2019.” #StrengtheningMedicare #LoweringDrugPrices
"We also made it easier for low-income beneficiaries by lowering the maximum amount they pay for certain innovative medicines, making sure that the latest drugs are available to all.” #LoweringDrugPrices #StrengtheningMedicare
"With the Part D policies that we finalized for 2019 and published last month, we are making lower-cost generic drugs available to beneficiaries regardless of when the drugs became available.” #LoweringDrugPrices #StrengtheningMedicare
"There has been a lot of discussion on drug pricing and President Trump and Secretary Azar have made lowering drug prices a major priority, and @CMSGov we are following their leadership to deliver results for our beneficiaries.” #LoweringDrugPrices
"And finally, we improved transparency in our Star Ratings to provide you with more information about what we’re measuring each year and why.” #StrengtheningMedicare
We are also making common-sense changes to allow electronic delivery of beneficiary documents. As a new generation of seniors come into the program who may be more accustomed to computers, it makes sense that we put them in the driver’s seat regarding how they receive information
"We are also looking forward to 2020, when plans and providers will have even more flexibility on how to deliver care with the implementation of the Bipartisan Budget Act provision that allows telehealth services to be provided as a basic benefit in Medicare Advantage.”
"Additionally, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will have access to safety devices to better prevent injury in the home, including stair rails, grab bars, and temporary mobility ramps.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"This means Medicare Advantage beneficiaries will be provided adult day care services, respite care for caregivers, and in-home assistance with activities like dressing, bathing and managing medications.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"These plans can offer benefits that compensate for physical impairments, diminish the impact of injuries or health conditions, or reduce avoidable emergency room utilization.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"For the first time ever, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries can access significant new flexibility for additional benefits that can help them live healthier, more independent lives.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"Patients over Paperwork brought changes to Medicare Advantage and Part D. Our changes for 2019 include significant new flexibility for offerings to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.” #StrengtheningMedicare #PatientsOverPaperwork
"Following his leadership, we have launched our own initiative we call #PatientsOverPaperwork”
"Overregulation is something that has been happening for years all over the federal government, and to combat this @POTUS Issued an Executive Order that directs federal agencies to “cut red tape” to reduce burdensome regulations.”
"One thing we have heard time and time again is that unnecessary administrative burden is contributing to rising costs as well as taking focus away from taking care of patients."
"For all of our beneficiaries, it is critical that we unleash the potential of Medicare Advantage and Part D, so we @CMSGov have been listening to providers, plans, and other stakeholders about their experiences with the program."
"The handbook is now designed to clearly highlight the benefits of joining a Medicare Advantage plan, such as protection from high out of pocket expenses and access to important additional benefits.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"Some of the improvements include changes in the Medicare handbook to help beneficiaries understand their coverage options.” #StrengtheningMedicare
"This year, CMS launched a Coverage Wizard to help people learn about their options. CMS is undertaking several consumer-friendly improvements for Medicare Open Enrollment so that people with Medicare can make an informed choice between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage."
During my tenure at CMS, I have been impressed by the level of private sector innovation and creativity that plans have brought to our beneficiaries and I know this personally because both my parents are in an Medicare Advantage plan, and they can’t stop talking about them.
"As you know, Medicare Advantage is playing an ever-increasing and important role in delivering high-quality and cost-effective care to Medicare beneficiaries.”#StrengtheningMedicare
Getting ready to speak to the #Medicare Advantage &amp; Prescription Drug Plan Spring Conference! Looking forward to sharing how we are #StrengtheningMedicare

In line with the priorities of the @WhiteHouse, we found it urgent to develop this strategy, the first of its kind @CMSGov. The CMS #RuralHealthStrategy seeks to alleviate the unique challenges faced in rural communities and make sure no beneficiaries are left out. https://t.co/6m2AlRQRyJ
It's paramount that we tackle issues facing rural #healthcare collaboratively, &amp; one of the objectives is leveraging partnerships w/ @HRSAgov, @HHSgov, &amp; other partners. As the #RuralHealthStrategy grows &amp; develops, we appreciate your help in promoting it: https://t.co/fWKfxedbx6
The nationwide listening sessions gave @CMSGov FIVE	clear objectives to address with this #RuralHealthStrategy https://t.co/HHROuUf2l8
The rural community spoke and we listened. After a series of listening sessions with providers and beneficiaries, I am thrilled to announce the release of @CMSGov’s #RuralHealthStrategy! https://t.co/fWKfxedbx6

Honored to sign New Hampshire’s #Medicaid community engagement program today. I congratulate @GovChrisSununu’s commitment to join me in improving the lives of Medicaid beneficiaries by creating a crucial link to work and community engagement. https://t.co/wTZrT3eHyz
We look forward to working with states and tribes to try to help them achieve their goals and determine how to best apply community engagement to serve their populations. (2/2)
On community engagement &amp; how it impacts local tribes: We believe we can give states flexibility and discretion to implement the community engagement requirements with respect to local tribal members. (1/2)
We seek to create a pathway out of poverty, but we also understand that people’s circumstances change, and we must ensure that our programs are sustainable and available to them when they need and qualify for them.
I applaud the growing list of states who have taken the initiative in designing comprehensive strategies to improve the well-being of #Medicaid beneficiaries in their states. Stay tuned for a state announcement today #AHAmtg
We’re also determined to make sure that the #Medicaid program remains a safety net for those that need it most. #AHAmtg
#ICYMI: We @CMSGov are determined to make sure that able bodied, working age adults receive the support &amp; encouragement they need to rise out of poverty and no longer need #Medicaid. #AHAmtg
It was a pleasure to speak at #AHAmtg &amp; share what we @CMSGov are doing to create a future of transformative #healthcare. Thank you @AHAHospitals for the opportunity to speak as part of such an esteemed panel. Here’s my speech #ICYMI: https://t.co/mcGIUkGMul https://t.co/DRka1OJmzP
Thank you, @ahahospitals, for your continued support &amp; partnership as @CMSgov moves towards value-based #healthcare &amp; also making sure that healthcare is tailored to the specific needs of our beneficiaries.
However, with PBMs serving BOTH the manufacturer and the plan, all the incentives are lined up for manufacturers to set higher &amp; higher prices. As prices go up, the manufacturer, the plan &amp; the PBM all win EXCEPT the patient. #AHAmtg
Drug manufacturers have an incentive to work with the PBMs because if the manufacturer’s drug does not get on a plan’s formulary, then the manufacturer loses market share. #AHAmtg
Every day, #Medicare Part D plans &amp; their Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, negotiate with drug manufacturers. #AHAmtg
Unlike Part B where @CMSGov pays the avg. sales price plus an add-on fee, a group of negotiators works on behalf of #Medicare Part D plans to get a good deal for our beneficiaries. #AHAmtg
Adding 6% to the sales price on prescription drugs doesn’t make sense in today’s world. #AHAmtg #LowerDrugPrices
#Medicare Part B providers get paid for drugs at an amount equal to the average price the drug sells for, PLUS a 6% add-on fee. #AHAmtg
The world of drug pricing is very convoluted, even if we just look at #Medicare. #AHAmtg
As the largest payer of #healthcare services, we need to protect innovation, while also encouraging ⬇ list prices &amp; ⬆ affordability for all Americans. #LowerDrugPrices #AHAmtg
#DYK spending on prescription drugs for #Medicare is growing more quickly than spending on any other area? The status quo is unsustainable.   #LowerDrugPrices #AHAmtg
As @CMSGov moves to a more sustainable and value-based system, we must look closely at every area of spending – including spending on prescription drugs. #LowerDrugPrices #AHAmtg
Patients deserve, and need to know cost of services, if they are to be empowered to shop for value. That’s why we @CMSGov are also working to advance price transparency. We’re updating our guidelines to require that hospitals post their charges online. #AHAmtg
It will allow a majority of beneficiaries to connect their claims data to third party applications, services, and research programs. #AHAmtg
As part of the #MyHealthEData Initiative, #BlueButton 2.0 is the new, developer-friendly, standards based API that we announced earlier this year. #AHAmtg
We @CMSGov have asked for feedback on making it a requirement that ALL providers share health records w/ patients as a condition of participating in #Medicare, #AHAmtg
The days of finding creative ways to trap patient data in closed systems MUST come to an end. No longer is it acceptable to limit access to patient records, or to prevent them &amp; their doctors from seeing their complete history. #AHAmtg
#ICYMI, in March @CMSGov launched the #MyHealthEData Initiative to empower patients by giving them control of their #health records. #AHAmtg
Patients need to be empowered with the info they need to make the best choices for themselves &amp; their families. #AHAmtg
We MUST make our system work better for patients, and to do that patients must be at the center of cost &amp; quality decisions. #AHAmtg
The rule will also reduce over 2 MILLION hours of burden for providers &amp; save over $75 MILLION. #AHAmtg
Combined with the measures from the cancer hospital quality program and the long term acute care hospital program, this rule would remove a total of 27 measures.  #AHAmtg
We’ve also proposed removing duplicative measures across the five hospital quality and value-based purchasing programs. #AHAmtg #MeaningfulMeasures
In the Proposed Rule for the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), we proposed eliminating a significant number of measures that acute care hospitals are required to report. #AHAmtg #MeaningfulMeasures
Another key @CMSGov initiative launched is known as “#MeaningfulMeasures”, an initiative to allow providers to focus their limited resources on improving their performance on measures that actually translate to improvements in patient care. #AHAmtg
.@AHAHospitals has a ‘burden reduction tracker’ to chart our progress here @CMSGov. We find it very helpful. Thank you for supporting and amplifying our message. #AHAmtg
We’re looking at even the smallest ways to eliminate redundancies &amp; burdens that are taking away from patient care. #AHAmtg
Not only will the #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative ⬇ costs for patients &amp; taxpayers, but it will allow providers to focus on what matters most – caring for their patients. #PuttingPatientsFirst #AHAmtg
We’re working here @CMSGov to advance @POTUS’ “Cut the Red Tape” Initiative to ⬇ regulatory burden. Our initiative is called the #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative. #AHAmtg
Here at @CMSGov we are conducting a holistic review of our implementation of the Stark Law &amp; the consequences. We intend to leave the protections for our beneficiaries while not penalizing providers who are taking bold steps away from FFS. #AHAmtg
Another important step in moving towards value: removing barriers that prevent providers from participating in new payment models. #AHAmtg
We’ve also been reviewing models launched under the prior administration, in particular @CMSGov’s Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs. #AHAmtg
We’re developing new models through our Center for #Medicare and #Medicaid	Innovation (@CMSInnovates) that provides an alternative to FFS payment. #AHAmtg
.@SecAzar and I are working for competition &amp; better value. How? By moving away from a fee-for-service (FFS) approach to a system that is value-based – and that rewards #ValueOverVolume. #AHAmtg
#ICYMI, last year @POTUS announced the “Promoting Healthcare Choice &amp; Competition Across the U.S.” Exec Order. The goal was to change the rate of growth of healthcare spending so that competition can be fostered in #healthcare markets. #AHAmtg
Status quo is not an option, and @POTUS agrees. He’s encouraged his Administration to take bold action to change and improve the #healthcare system. #AHAmtg
#DYK: with the #ACA the healthcare cost curve hasn’t bent? In fact, if continued on this path, by 2026 we will be spending ONE IN FIVE dollars on #healthcare! #AHAmtg
Over the last year there’s been a fierce debate around Obamacare often highlighting the #ACA’s many failures, ⬆ in premiums of over 100%, the insurers leaving the market, leaving 10 states &amp; 50% of counties in the US with only ONE insurer. #AHAmtg
Hospitals are at the center of the delivery system, leveraging innovation &amp; technology to advance patient care and improve #health outcomes. The progress we’re making in #healthcare – from #telemedicine to #telehealth, is extraordinary. #AHAmtg
Congrats to @SenatorCollins for being presented the @ahahospitals Honorary Life Membership Award!

The #ACA has put millions of Americans into a program that wasn’t designed to meet their needs, and the previous Administration was resistant to state level efforts to create waiver programs tailored to the needs of able-bodied recipients. #WHCC18
This has stretched the safety net for some of our most fragile populations, many of whom still wait for critical home-care services while states are busy enrolling millions of able-bodied adults into #Medicaid.	#WHCC18
An overwhelming majority of people covered by Obamacare are actually, able-bodied, working age adults who were put into #Medicaid, a program created to care for seniors in need, pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities. #WHCC18
#Medicaid makes an incredible difference to MILLIONS of Americans. It’s more than a safety net… it’s a lifeline, one that needs to be preserved &amp; protected for those who truly need it. #WHCC1
It would be impossible, however, to confront the problems with Obamacare	without also addressing the strain it put on the #Medicaid program. #WHCC18
Also, we’re proposing to expand the use of Short Term Insurance -- to be used as an affordable health coverage for people caught between individual market premiums they can’t afford, and no coverage at all. #WHCC18
We’re cleaning up regulations to provide states greater flexibility &amp; control to better serve the needs of their citizens, stabilize markets, &amp; create more choices and competition to help drive ⬇ costs. #WHCC18
This Administration has refused to stand idly by while Americans are	suffering. That’s why we @CMSGov have taken numerous actions to give help to those who cannot afford the expensive premiums on the (Obamacare) exchanges.	#WHCC18
Americans know a bad deal with they see one, and there is no amount of	advertising that could hide the sky-rocketing premiums and unaffordable	deductibles caused by Obamacare. #WHCC18
In addition, the gov’t had been making unauthorized payments directly to	insurers. And spending tens of MILLIONS of💲on ad campaigns that weren’t increasing enrollment. #WHCC18
When this Administration came into office, we were faced with #healthcare exchanges that were pricing Americans out of the system, giving them fewer and fewer options, and then punishing them with tax penalties for	being unable to afford government mandated coverage. #WHCC18
Promise – ⬇ premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family.		Reality – Premiums have more than DOUBLED since the inception of the #ACA.	#WHCC18
Promise – If you liked your #healthcare plan, you could keep it. 		Reality – Health insurers have fled the individual markets and 1/2 of the counties in our country don’t even have a choice of health issuer. HALF! #WHCC18
We’ve spent the last year working hard to MITIGATE the damages caused to Americans by the #ACA, NOT sabotage it. When the #ACA passed w/ the previous Administration, promises were made, but not kept. #WHCC18
To change that, this past year @CMSGov has announced changes that will save providers 4 million admin hours and up to nearly $390 Million. That’s just the beginning! #WHCC18
Overly-burdersome regulations continue to be a problem for our #healthcare system, costing $39 BILLION a year according to @ahahospitals.	#WHCC18
With all this data sharing, protecting the privacy of patient info is vital, so we @CMSGov are requiring that hospitals also take every action necessary to protect patient records. #WHCC18
That’s why @CMSGov is proposing a requirement that hospitals post their	charges online. We’ve also proposed payment consequences to hospitals who don’t give patients access to their health records. #WHCC18
Patients deserve &amp; need to know the cost of #healthcare services so they can be empowered to shop for value. #PuttingPatientsFirst #WHCC18
We @CMSGov are following @POTUS’ leadership with his Executive Order: Promoting Healthcare Choice &amp; Competition across the US - which will foster competition in #healthcare markets &amp; provide better value for our investments in care. #WHCC18
We MUST make our system work better for patients. They have to be at the center of cost &amp; quality decisions, empowered with the info they need to make the best choices for themselves and their families. #PuttingPatientsFirst	#WHCC18
⬆ quality, ⬆ outcomes, &amp; ⬇ costs aren’t new concepts. Some progress has been made, but we must activate the most powerful force in our #healthcare system for creating value: the patient. #PuttingPatientsFirst #WHCC18
This is unsustainable, yet there is no easy fix. Gov’t spending alone can’t fix this &amp; despite the huge increase in funding, &amp; the 11,000 pages of regulations we produce each year, many of our #healthcare challenges continue to worsen. #WHCC18
#DYK our healthcare spending rate is growing faster than our over economy? In fact, by 2026 we will be spending one in every five dollars on #healthcare. That means more of our household budgets will be spent on higher premiums, deductibles and copays. #WHCC18
I’d be negligent in my responsibility as a public servant, a mother, a	neighbor, and a citizen of this country to not do everything in my power to	overcome the looming #healthcare crisis on the horizon. #WHCC18
Our footprint here @CMSGov on the US #healthcare system is so	significant that EVERYTHING we do has a large effect on every American, whether they are a beneficiary of one of our programs or not. #WHCC18
Honored and excited to be the keynote speaker at #WHCC18 today to discuss key initiatives @CMSGov on #healthcare cost and quality.
Patient safety &amp; program quality and integrity are top priorities for @CMSGov and are the core of the #MeaningfulMeasures Initiative. See how the proposed rules for both hospice &amp; inpatient psychiatric facilities help accomplish these priorities: https://t.co/ZJqq3GctaF
#ICYMI: on Friday, April 27 @CMSGov released a RFI to obtain feedback on positive solutions to better achieve #interoperability or the sharing of #healthcare data between providers. To learn more: https://t.co/czOkl16CFa
The payment policy proposals issued Friday for Fiscal Year 2019 further advance @CMSGov’s priority of creating a patient-driven #healthcare system that fosters innovation of efficient &amp; accountable programs while removing waste, fraud, &amp; abuse. https://t.co/hJrhGb4sCo
Across the rules released and IPPS released this year, @CMSGov’s proposals will save providers close to 4 million hours and more than $140 million as changes take effect in 2019 and 2020.	https://t.co/pJr79sIVgL https://t.co/BKbF6Uqp6v
Changes in the IRF and IPF rules released today will allow providers will to work with a smaller set of more meaningful #healthcare measures and spend more time on patient care. #MeaningfulMeasures	https://t.co/aQMtKFvlPQ
All four proposed rules released today include measures that are patient-centered and outcome-driven rather than process-oriented. For details on the four proposed rules released today by @CMSGov, please visit: https://t.co/872bRPMk0h 	#MeaningulMeasures
We’re taking action in proposed rules to reduce paperwork, while maintaining our focus on patient safety and program integrity by focusing on #MeaningfulMeasures. See how: https://t.co/gH2QFgbNuL
These payment policy proposals for Fiscal Year 2019 further advance the @CMS’s priority of creating a patient-driven #healthcare system that fosters innovation of efficient and accountable programs while removing waste, fraud, and abuse. https://t.co/N603tGi3kB
The new payment model is designed to improve the incentives to treat the needs of the whole patient, instead of focusing on the volume of services the patient receives.
PDPM would simplify complicated paperwork requirements for performing patient assessments by significantly reducing reporting burden, saving facilities approximately $2 billion over 10 years.
@CMSGov is proposing a Patient Driven Payment Model (PDPM), an innovative new system for nursing home payments.
We @CMSGov are taking important steps for skilled nursing facilities through proposed payment improvements that reduce admin burden, &amp; foster innovation to improve care &amp; quality for patients. Learn more: https://t.co/9NxbWO85nm
Today @CMSGov proposed payment rules for a range of medical facilities, which are set out to further advance the drive to value, meaningful quality measure reporting, &amp; reduce paperwork and admin costs. #StrengtheningMedicare https://t.co/uf4ZTDrBfI
It has been 8 years since the passage of #Obamacare. For a law that was intended to be affordable and compassionate, it has proven to be neither, as it continues to cause Americans to experience skyrocketing premiums and limited choices for their healthcare.
Our new “Data Driven Patient Care” strategy, in collaboration with the #MyHealthEData Initiative and #BlueButton 2.0, will help @CMSGov be a leader in creating a system that rewards value over volume. #hdpalooza
It was a pleasure to speak at #hdpalooza about the Administration’s and @CMSGov’s strategies on leveraging #healthcare data and the future towards patient-centric care and data sharing.
Amazing to see all the innovation with data @hdpalooza to help doctors, patients, researchers and innovators make better choices with care and ultimately place #healthcare data where it belongs: in the hands of patients. #hdpalooza
An incredible day @hdpalooza! From consumer-facing technologies to cybersecurity and life sciences, I’m amazed by what the potential of health data can do to shape the #healthcare landscape for the better. #hdpalooza
Great sharing the stage today with leaders and innovators @hdpalooza to show how we can embrace, empower, and unleash the potential of #healthcare data! #hdpalooza
Without collaboration, the power of data can’t be unleashed to ensure a value-based #healthcare system that’s patient centered. #HDPalooza
The real value in data is in the analytics. The data products @CMSGov will ultimately help doctors &amp; patients make the best choices about care – and place #healthcare where it firmly belongs: in the hands of patients. #HDpalooza
Not only are we making #healthcare data more accessible, but we’ll also strengthening controls around the access to all data. Patients must always be aware of how their data is being used and shared. #HDPalooza
We @CMSGov are taking an API-first approach around cost &amp; quality data so that innovators can gain easier access to data, develop new tools and new ways to make the data understandable to various users. #HDPalooza
.@CMSGov plans to release #Medicare Advantage data annually in VRDC, and we’re not stopping there! Next year, we expect to release #Medicaid &amp; #CHIP data (T-MSIS data). That’s another 70 million patients which represent a different population w/ different needs. #HDPalooza
Extremely pleased to announce for the very first time that @CMSGov will be releasing #Medicare Advantage data in our VRDC! We were missing this piece, and it will help us complete the picture.  #hdpalooza
The VRDC provides timely access to @CMSGov program data on our 130 MILLION beneficiaries in an efficient, secure, and cost effective manner. Researches have direct access and conduct their analysis in a safe and secure environment. #HDPalooza
The “Data Driven Patient Care” strategy is also result driven. That’s why @CMSGov is expanding the data we make available to researchers in our Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC). #HDPalooza
Our new “Data Driven Patient Care” strategy is based on 3 cornerstones: 1) putting patients FIRST; 2) ⬆ amount of available data; and 3) take an API-first approach for sharing data. #HDPalooza
“Data Driven Patient Care” will help ensure that we can be an industry leader in unleashing the power of data to drive system transformation – enhancing efficiency, improving quality, and reducing cost. #HDPalooza
Excited to announce a NEW strategy for @CMSGov: “Data Driven Patient Care” - a strategy that recognizes we need better data that’s not only accessible and usable, but helps move us towards value. #HDPalooza
By not delaying the requirement that providers use the 2015 Ed. Of Certified #EHR Technology by 2019, systems will be able to share more clinical &amp; payment data via APIs. Patients can take their data to other providers and give developers access to their data. #HDPalooza
We have more data than ever today. #DYK 78% of doctors &amp; 96% of hospitals now use and have almost universally adopted EHRs? Not only that -- all the data is in digital format.
We’re at a defining moment when it comes to using data to improve and advance patient centered #healthcare. We @CMSgov, &amp; across the #healthcare industry, must make great strides while proceeding w/ caution with the power of data. #HDPalooza
Times, consumers’ demands, &amp; the expectations of @CMSGov have changed. We must accept the fact that patients should access to their #healthcare records and not be kept in the dark. #HDPalooza
With #Medicaid, we’ve started working with states on how they can make their claims data available to their beneficiaries. #HDPalooza
We’ve also recently announced the new #BlueButton 2.0, which allows #Medicare beneficiaries to download their claims info and connect their data to secure apps, services, &amp; research programs that they trust. #HDPalooza
The new Meaningful Use program will be renamed “Promoting Interoperability,” to reflect on the program’s new emphasis on providing #healthcare info to patients and sharing info among providers ELECTRONICALLY. #HDPalooza
In order to increase the emphasis on giving patients control of their #healthcare data, we’re reshaping the Meaningful Use program for hospitals. #HDPalooza
To further elevate the #MyHealthEData Initiative, we @CMSGov are streamlining procedures for researchers, putting new measures in place, and ensuring that everything we do is patient-centered.
Following the leadership of @POTUS and the Office of American Innovation, we’ve launched the #MyHealthEData Initiative -- a major step in providing patients with access and control of their health data while knowing that it’s secure and private. #HDPalooza
With more and better data, we can generate better info on treatments of drugs &amp; procedures. Researchers could help develop both personalized treatments and cures that could save MILLIONS of lives.  #hdpalooza
The value of data is priceless. In order to achieve value-based care, we need to empower patients with the data they need to make their own informed decisions. Unfortunately, that’s currently not the case. #HDPalooza
As @SecAzar has said, we’re working to move away from a fee-for-services approach to a system that’s value-based. A system that rewards VALUE over VOLUME. #HDPalooza
.@POTUS’ Executive Order: Promoting Healthcare Choice &amp; Competition across the US, will foster competition in #healthcare markets and provide better value for our investments in care. #HDPalooza
With proper safety and privacy regulations in place, we’re also working with researchers to have access to our data. This will not just improve individual health, but public and population health as well. #HDPalooza
Our data products @CMSGov have the potential to bring cutting edge breakthroughs in precision medicine, robotic technology, and telemedicine to the beneficiaries we serve.  #hdpalooza
Here @CMSGov, we’ve already done a lot to increase, improve, and allow greater access to data. For one, we’ve released a large amount of data in various formats that’s important to researchers, innovators and thought leaders. #HDPalooza
A recent study with ten other high-income nations show that the US ranked the HIGHEST in both infant mortality and in the percentage of obese/overweight adults. This cannot continue… #HDPalooza
We still face enormous challenges in #healthcare – especially in the value we receive for the money we spend. By 2026, we’ll be spending 1 in 5 dollars on our care. #HDPalooza
#DYK: On this day in 1954, the Salk polio field trials began. A year later and millions of pieces of data collected, a safe and effective vaccine was created. All because of the power of: DATA. #HDPalooza
I am so appreciative for my administrative assistants, Diana and Jasmine! There is no way that @CMSGov could function without all of our fantastic administrative staff - Thank you!! #AdministrativeProfessionalsWeek https://t.co/rU8qwKagqT

#hdpalooza is here! Can’t wait to talk later today on how @CMSGov will use the power of data to improve the #healthcare system and help drive value-based care.
#ICYMI: @CMSGov issued a final rule updating #Medicare Advantage &amp; the prescription drug benefit program to better empower patients &amp; doctors in making decisions about patient #healthcare. Learn more in the latest #PatientsOverPaperwork newsletter: https://t.co/aBHmz23Gol
After receiving comments about burdensome documentation requirements like the billing process for Immunosuppressive drugs, @CMSGov has taken action and clarified what a supplier can and cannot do. For more details on #PatientsOverPaperwork: https://t.co/EmM1NLJy7R
As these efforts evolve, @CMSGov will continue to solicit ideas for ways to reduce regulatory burden &amp; look forward to working with stakeholders to better understand their experiences with our regulations.
.@CMSGov continues to collaborate with partners across gov’t to address customer concerns that require the involvement of multiple agencies. See how we’re putting #PatientsOverPaperwork: https://t.co/O5mk1aFefe
#DYK @CMSGov identified over 3,000 mentions of burden in the responses to last year’s RFIs? From Documentation to Health IT, and Quality Measures &amp; Reporting, see how we’ve categorized burdens and recommendations. #PatientsOverPaperwork: https://t.co/fes7qYcb63

Are you ready for #hdpalooza? Excited to share how @CMSGov is focused on innovation by unleashing the power of data and providing a system based on value.
Ready to take the stage at the World Medical Innovation Forum this morning where I’ll be talking healthcare innovation, Medicare #BlueButton 2.0 and #MyHealthEData!  #WMIF18 https://t.co/Xujp0nZDIs
We’re eager to get comments back on our #MeaningfulMeasures proposals, as we work to strike the right balance in structuring effective quality reporting programs.  Patient safety is our priority.
Patient safety is our top priority, so improving our quality programs is critical.  That’s why we’re focused on #MeaningfulMeasures.
We are removing a total of 19 measures and are de-duplicating another 21 measures, all while strengthening patient safety requirements and the use of #EHR.
We’re removing measures that are excessively burdensome for providers to report – excessive because the information they give us isn’t valuable enough to make that burden worth it.
To advance #MeaningfulMeasures, we’re removing “duplicative” measures – those where hospitals will still report more-or-less the same thing through a different measure.
To advance #MeaningfulMeasures, we’re removing “topped out” measures – those where almost everyone’s scores are high, so measures reveal little about performance.
We are taking significant steps in advancing our #MeaningfulMeasures Initiative, which is designed to streamline our measure set to focus only on measurements that are meaningful for quality and program integrity.
#PatientsOverPaperwork: we’re providing more flexibility to urban teaching hospitals to accommodate the cross training of residents.
#PatientsOverPaperwork: we’re removing redundant reporting in #Medicare Part A certification and admission orders.
The IPPS rule removes outdated, unnecessary regulations and lets providers spend more time treating their patients. #PuttingPatientsFirst #PatientsOverPaperwork
Today’s proposed rule is projected to save well over 2 million burden hours for hospitals as changes take effect in 2019 and 2020, saving them $75 million.
.@CMSGov is also seeking comments on what data elements stakeholders would find most useful &amp; how best to help third parties create patient-friendly interfaces to make it easier for consumers to access health care data &amp; more readily compare providers: https://t.co/jsMOJscayl
We’re asking: what barriers prevent providers from informing patients of their out of pocket costs; what’s needed to support greater transparency in out of pocket costs; what can be done to better inform patients about their costs; what role should providers play?
In addition to the proposed rule, @CMSGov is requesting stakeholder RFI feedback on what cost information patients need to drive value.
Patients should be at the center of cost and quality decisions, and they should have the information they need to make the best decisions for themselves and their families.  Today’s rule takes a first step.
We have long known we need to move towards value-driven healthcare, but the patient has been missing from the equation.  Patients simply don’t have the information they need to drive value, and that needs to change.
Consumers must know prices to effectively shop for the best value.  Knowledge of prices is a basic prerequisite for a functioning market.
The #MyHealthEData initiative sends a clear message to the healthcare industry that patients should own and control their healthcare records and the industry has a responsibility to be transparent about costs and value.  #PuttingPatientsFirst
Today’s proposed rule increases patient access to price information and transparency by requiring hospitals show standard charges online. https://t.co/z7TGkwqyKU #PuttingPatientsFirst #MyHealthEData
When a patient leaves the hospital, they should have their medical info available to them electronically, period.
Requesting feedback on whether @CMSgov should require providers share data w/ patients, as a condition of participation in the #Medicare.  https://t.co/dwkXuF17XD
To avoid a payment penalty, providers will have to provide patients with electronic access to their health information.  #MyHealthEData
Meaningful Use has a new name: “Promoting Interoperability”.  Reflects the program’s new emphasis on providing healthcare information to patients in an electronic format and sharing information electronically among providers.
We’re OVERHAULING the meaningful use program to make it less burdensome on providers and more beneficial for patients.
The policies in the IPPS &amp; LTCH proposed rule further advance @CMSGov's priority of creating a patient-driven healthcare system w/ greater price transparency, interoperability, &amp; burden reduction to give hospitals &amp; patients the flexibility they need. https://t.co/t3INZgeV5o
We are moving the ball forward on #MyHealthEData as promised.  Thanks to Jared Kushner and Chris Liddell from the @WhiteHouse Office of American Innovation for their help in shaping our plan.
We’re proposing to get rid of regulations are redundant, process-based rather than outcomes based, or completely unnecessary to ensuring patient safety or quality &amp; serve as barriers to achieving a value based healthcare system. Looking forward to input. #PatientsOverPaperwork
Medicare is a promise that our nation has made to provide high quality healthcare to those who are eligible for the program. https://t.co/d0o8y5auhH #StrengtheningMedicare
Today’s proposed IPPS and LTCH rule updates #Medicare payment policies and rates and demonstrates our commitment to #PatientsOverPaperwork and #MyHealthEData. https://t.co/bjTFkZjqAF

We’re excited to explore the concept of direct provider contracting (DPC), as well as focus our attention on other areas guided by the input and feedback we received from the New Direction RFI. https://t.co/U0oOqi2yi6
.@CMSGov is also interested in creating a direct provider contracting (DPC) model that would focus on positive health outcomes for patients, and eliminate unnecessary administrative burden on providers.  For more info: https://t.co/U0oOqi2yi6 #PatientsOverPaperwork
We’re committed to empowering patients with more choices and better health outcomes, while reducing unnecessary burden for our Nation’s #healthcare providers: https://t.co/lODnS9rv33
Thanks to all those who provided valuable insight to @CMSgov’s @CMSInnovates Center to improve existing models as well as ideas for transformative new models.  The best ideas don’t come from Washington, so it’s important that we hear from the front lines of our healthcare system: https://t.co/YBffFSUQ3f

Too many Americans are facing SKYROCKETING premiums they can’t afford. Between 2013 and 2017, the average premiums more than DOUBLED in States using the Federal Exchange. There needs to be #RegReform to help lower premiums.	https://t.co/w5qZPUb0ky
Since #ACA started in 2013, States using the Federal Exchange have had fewer and fewer choices. As of 2017, HALF of the counties in America had only one issuer.  Choices ⬇, Costs ⬆	https://t.co/oh0BJNR3W2
Compared to the previous Administration’s one-size-fits-all approach, most of the policies we are releasing today @CMSGov give States more tools, flexibility &amp; choices to address the unique problems facing their insurance markets. https://t.co/lIsJBrPRg9
Program integrity is vital to those who truly need help. @CMSGov is improving it by requiring Exchanges to implement stronger checks to verify applicants earn the income they claim in order to qualify for Advanced Premium Tax Credits. https://t.co/TPnJcCgDZj
We’re giving States tools and flexibility to promote more stable markets and help them attract &amp; retain issuers. This will provide Americans with more #healthcare choices at an affordable price.	https://t.co/o9rKkjSNBq
Other #RegReform provisions reduce unnecessary burden, most notably eliminating online enrollment requirements for the #SmallBiz Health Options Program (SHOP) Exchanges. This will streamline the enrollment process. https://t.co/DZbAvsop90
The #SmallBiz Health Options Prog (SHOP) experienced MUCH lower enrollment than expected, 39K in 2017 compared to 4 MIL projected. That’s &lt; 1% of the projected outcome. There needs to be change.  We’re turning over enrollment to qualified agents &amp; brokers: https://t.co/Z92DLArDOF
Some key #RegReform provisions for States include: (1) More options in selecting an essential health benefit (#EHB) benchmark plan, (2) A larger role in reviewing Qualified Health Plan (#QHP) certification standards, and (3) Deference on network adequacy. 	https://t.co/aR8PkuyG99
.@CMSGov has been following the leadership set forth in @POTUS’ first Executive Order directing @CMSGov to minimize economic and regulatory burdens, and give states more flexibility and control to promote more free and open #healthcare markets. 	https://t.co/900dQNiEGR
The 2019 Payment Notice Rule will provide States greater flexibility &amp; control over their insurance mkts to better address local conditions moving forward. https://t.co/I8XMJSzwjL

Here’s a link to the Final Exchange Enrollment Report: https://t.co/Jy1jQSr6en
Data suggest that more affordable healthcare options are needed - especially for those forgotten women and men who are not eligible to have their premiums reduced by tax credits.
Greater share of Exchange shoppers selected a bronze plan. The share of bronze plan selections is up 6 percentage points while share of silver plan selections is down 9 percentage points.
https://t.co/RhAQ546lI5 consumers using their own money chose less expensive plans. On average, they chose plans 18% less expensive than those receiving generous subsidies.
https://t.co/RhAQ546lI5 risk pool grew older in 2018. The share of individuals 55 and older enrolled increased from 27% last year to 29% this year.
Final Exchange Enrollment Report also shows most consumers on the Exchanges relied on premium subsidies. Approximately 83% of consumers nationwide had their premiums reduced by tax credits.
Final Exchange Enrollment Report shows unsubsidized monthly premiums continue to increase for taxpayers and consumers - jumping from $476 last year to $621 this year - an increase of 30%.
Despite delivering the most successful consumer experience to date, Americans continue to experience skyrocketing premiums and limited choice on https://t.co/RhAQ546lI5.
11.8 million consumers enrolled for 2018 Exchange coverage nationwide. Great job @CMSGov on the most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date!

RT @HHSMedia: Video: New HHS Secretary @SecAzar Takes on the Opioid Crisis https://t.co/CXVwHWTVZ4 via @FoxNews
We believe the market will improve and lead to short-term coverage choices that consumers will value and that states under their traditional authority can regulate in the manner that best fits local conditions – as they did for decades before Obamacare.
Some critics say that this coverage option will raise premiums in the individual market. But @CMSGov projects that in the short-term, those effects will be minimal. Also, we believe this is far better than forcing people to buy coverage they don't want and can't afford.
The bottom line is: Many Americans are facing the choice between short-term coverage -- or no coverage at all.
STLD coverage can help people in many circumstances – between jobs, graduating from school, or who simply can’t afford coverage in the individual market. It isn’t the only choice for everyone, but it’s the best choice for many. Americans deserve more options than they have today.
FYI: Our proposed duration of less than 12 months is the same policy the Obama Administration had in place for almost eight years, before changing it in October, 2016.
In response to the executive order, we propose to expand access to short-term, limited-duration (STLD) insurance coverage from the current limit of less than 3 months, and increase it to less than 12 months.
https://t.co/lt0xSqfCvS		The President isn’t just standing by and letting this continue. Last October, he issued this executive order to increase competition, expand consumer choice and create better access to lower- priced, high-quality healthcare options for all Americans.
This is because premiums are skyrocketing. Average Obamacare individual market premiums more than doubled between 2013 and 2017 in the 39 states using the federal exchange. This is the definition of an intolerable situation.
There is no denying that Obamacare’s individual insurance market is leaving too many people behind. In fact, 28 million Americans still remain uninsured, and last year, 6.7 million Americans opted to pay a tax penalty rather than purchasing an Obamacare policy.
https://t.co/7FLpjE7v9k		Here is my statement on an Enforcement Letter @CMSGov sent to Idaho today.
https://t.co/7FLpjE7v9k
(3/3) Based on our review of the Idaho Bulletin, @CMSGov has reason to believe that Idaho would be failing to substantially enforce the provisions in Part A of title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act (the Part A market requirements) as amended by the ACA.
(2/3) @CMSGov is committed to working with states to give them as much flexibility as permissible under the law to provide their citizens the best possible access to healthcare. However, the ACA remains the law.
(1/3) @CMSGov appreciates the concern of @ButchOtter for his citizens and their increasing premiums, which have increased 91.4% over the last four years alone because of Obamacare. @CMSGov looks forward to continuing to work with Idaho on its 1332 and 1115 waiver applications.

Excited to announce that our Administration, following the leadership of @POTUS and the Office of American Innovation, are launching the #MyHealthEData Initiative -- a major step in #PuttingPatientsFirst. #HIMSS18
After hearing from Americans across the country, it is important to me to speak for all patients. It's our health, and it's our data, and we should have control of our health records. #HIMSS18
Met a doctor last week with twins. It took him - A DOCTOR - six months to get his health records from their primary care physician. SIX MONTHS! This isn’t okay. #HIMSS18
Doctors continue to find it difficult and burdensome to use their electronic health records systems. And they talk about still using fax machines to send and receive patient data. That's right... fax machines!! #HIMSS18
In conjunction with @POTUS’ “Cut the Red Tape” initiative, @CMSGov created the #PatientsOverPaperwork Initiative to address burdensome regulations that had a negative impact on patients &amp; providers. #HIMSS18
If our #healthcare system is going to survive, we have to ⬇ costs and ⬆ quality, and there is only one way to effectively do both; change our healthcare system from paying for volume to paying for quality. #HIMSS18

https://t.co/k0nHncEkI7	Our reforms will extend short-term, limited-duration insurance plans so they are more than a bridge -- but a lifeline -- for people who can't afford #obamacare.
https://t.co/xemY5aYCdY	We will move very swiftly to give people more affordable, high-quality insurance options.
https://t.co/3lF2ktzt0z
https://t.co/kQVVi6Mtsh		The current system is simply failing too many people.
Our proposed STLD rule would allow insurers to sell a flexible and short-term insurance product to consumers and extend coverage up to 12 months. The current allowance is no more than three months. We know this will help people left behind by #obamacare.
Today, @HHSgov and @CMSgov took a decisive first step to help Americans left behind by #Obamacare. Our short-term, limited-duration (STLD) insurance plan will provide increased consumer choice to those who can’t afford the current system’s skyrocketing premiums.

We’ve already achieved some results! 	-We removed a number of hospital measures, resulting in an estimated burden reduction of almost half a million provider hours. 	-We changed home health quality reporting, saving more than $145 million per year. 		#PatientsOverPaperwork
CMS measures must now meet one of our designated criteria:	-Eliminating disparities	-Tracking to measurable outcomes and impact, not process	-Safeguarding public health	-Achieving cost savings	-And improving access for communities		#PatientsOverPaperwork #CMSQualCon18
That’s why @CMSGov has announced our #MeaningfulMeasures initiative. Like everything we do, it starts with the patient at the center. #CMSQualCon18 #PatientsOverPaperwork
When a provider has to spend more time looking at a screen than engaging with a patient, or spend more time reporting data than actually providing care, then we’re collecting measures at the expense of patients. #PatientsOverPaperwork #CMSQualCon18
According to @ahahospitals, 15 doctors and nurses are needed per hospital for compliance, and regulatory burden costs $1200 every time a patient is admitted to a hospital. #PatientsOverPaperwork

Speaking to Health IT leaders in NY and one thing is clear: we must do a better job empowering patients by improving emergency health records. #PatientsOverPaperwork

I’m at @AARPUT today talking about #Medicare Open Enrollment! https://t.co/N6x1x6lGth
Our vision is to develop models that promote a patient-centered system of care within a market-driven #healthcare system. #AAO2017
We’re exploring new payment models to balance incentives across Part B &amp; Part D and eliminate worry about the cost implications. #AAO2017
We want to make sure that both opthalmologists and their patients can manage the costs of Part B drugs. #AAO2017
Ophthalmologists as a group are the 2nd largest prescribers in Part B by total payments, behind oncologists. #AAO2017
We’re working to identify opportunities to ⬆ efficiency in #Medicare Part B &amp; Part D as well as in the Medicaid program. #AAO2017
We need a system that can work for ALL providers so the transition to MACRA doesn’t push providers out resulting in fewer patient choices.
#MeaningfulMeasures takes a new approach on quality measures to reduce the burden of reporting #AAO2017
Along with #patientsoverpaperwork we've also announced our complementary initiative #MeaningfulMeasures #AAO2017
The primary focus of a patient visit MUST be the patient, NOT the paperwork. #PatientsOverPaperwork #AAO2017
.@CMSGov estimates that providers will spend over $1 Billion to comply with the #MACRA program alone in 2017 #AAO2017
.@CMSGov publishes nearly 11000 pages of regulations every year, taking doctors away from what matters most: patients #PatientsOverPaperwork
The array of regulations that govern #healthcare is overwhelming. Docs are spending more time complying with rules than caring for patients.
We can’t simply provide a card without care. #TransformingMedicaid. #AAO2017
Medicaid is central to our promise to Americans that we @CMSGov care deeply about. #AAO2017
We’ve seen advances in #ophthalmology inc. therapies for #RetinalDiseases &amp; advances in surgery for #Glaucoma. #AAO2017
People travel from around the globe to receive #healthcare services here, as we have one of the best healthcare systems in the world.

#MeaningfulMeasures takes a new approach to quality measures to reduce the burden of reporting on all providers.  #LANSummit
That’s why we’re revising current quality measures across all programs. #LANSummit
We have too many measures. We are measuring process and not outcomes. #LANSummit
Across the CMS hospital quality reporting programs, inpatient hospitals report up to 61 quality measures — 61! #LANSummit
We publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year and it’s taking doctors away from what matters most – Patients. #LANSummit
At CMS, our overall vision is to reinvent the agency to put patients first. #LANSummit
