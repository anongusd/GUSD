Donald Trump has nothing.		The evidence against Donald Trump breaking the law is greater than the evidence we had against Nixon who resigned. Yet Donald Trump is still our president and looking to campaign again. 		Disgusting.
And Republicans are saying Cohen was wrongly accusing Donald Trump of being a liar claiming Cohen himself was the liar despite Cohens  proof.		We do not have to trust Michael Cohen to know he is telling the truth. His truth has a money trail. His truth has legal documentation.
And I say this with the context that Michael Cohen has legal documentation and money trails proving Donald Trump to have committed a crime 		‚Ä¶ whereas Donald Trump has 8718 statements proven to be lies in the eyes of congress.
8718 is the official amount of lies Donald Trump has told as defined by congress and republicans are claiming Michael Cohen‚Äôs credibility is questionable over Donald Trump‚Äôs‚Ä¶.
The checks given to Michael Cohen claim they were for ‚ÄúLegal Advice‚Äù but were actually hush money.		This opens up an entirely new case where Donald Trump jr. is part a criminal financial scheme with his father.
The irrefutable proof Michael Cohen has of Donald Trump reimbursing him for the hush money he paid to Clifford‚Äôs Attorney has come to display that Donald Trump has been cooking his books.
Kavanaugh: I lied openly to congress	Republicans: lets make this man a member of the supreme court	Cohen: I lied to defend donald trump and I am now regretting that decision and have decided to come clean	Republicans: WE WOULD NEVER TRUST SOMEONE WHO LIED TO CONGRESS EVER
@mmpadellan Kavanaugh lied to congress and republicans let him be on the supreme court.
RT @mmpadellan: If Rep. Mark Meadows, and the rest of The GOP, were as outraged about false information about foreign entities submitted to‚Ä¶
donald trump: i could walk down 5th ave. and shoot someone and get away with it	republicans: hmm.. this seems like a man I should be defending.
All these questions about Cohen's credibility and all this blatant omittance of donald trumps lack thereof.
The republicans repeatedly waste congress‚Äôs time with frivolous questions AND THEN HAVE THE AUDACITY to ask why we‚Äôre wasting congress‚Äôs time with this case.	The case would be over by now if they would STICK TO IT. however if they stuck to the case trump would be convicted by now
michael cohen: heres irrefutable proof trump has committed a crime	republicans: uhm ... why are we wasting our time with this can't we just do something productive	everyone: republicans please tell me when you last did something productive for the public	republicans: *crickets*
after FOUR HOURS of the Michael Cohen court case they are finally asking questions regarding the REASON he is there instead of frivolous questions designed to derail his character and credibility.
They have nothing, so they keep trying to distract from the point.
The funds used to finance this court case against Cohen, against Trump, are not pulled from the same pool used to improve infrastructure. 		It would change NOTHING for the infrastructure if there was a court case or if there wasn‚Äôt one.
Amazing, the republicans have stated 		‚Äúwe could use this money on our nations crumbling infrastructure but democrats instead make us question you‚Äù		As if Donald Trump isn‚Äôt wasting infrastructure money on the wall,		FURTHERMORE, as if these aren‚Äôt completely separate funds.
the republicans admitting they have never heard of cohen before these cases is proof of their own incompetence and their inadequacy in their ability to deal with this case in the first place.
republicans: oh cohen, you just wanted to get on TV HUH		Michael Cohen: I was the person who started Donald Trump's Campaign, I have been on television since 2012		republicans: uHH.. uh fuck .. fuck uH I HAVENT HEARD OF YOU		everyone: that does not change the fact.
The democrats draw attention to legal documentation and ask questions about the case at hand, waiting for Cohen‚Äôs actual response.
there is a stark difference in questioning between the republicans and the democrats in the Cohen case 		The republicans do not wait for an answer, they repeatedly state things about Cohens character without ever placing a legitimate question, never giving Cohen time to speak.
If Cohen is found to be lying about any of the things he‚Äôs saying right now he will face longer times in jail. the republicans REFUSE to reveal this information because it PROVES Cohen has 0 incentive to lie right now.
The Republicans cannot prove Michael Cohen is receiving funds for his testimony and it frustrates them, because they know they have lost.
The democrats have even states ‚ÄúThe republicans are upset because you have stopped lying to congress‚Äù		Which is evident, as they keep trying to find some kind of way to prove Michael Cohen is making money off of his testimony when they have no proof of this.
Michael Cohen has repeatedly stated he has no book deal coming in the future. 		The only proof of lies we have are of Michael Cohen defending Donald Trump. It then follows that Michael Cohen must come clean because it has been proven he was defending Trump.
I‚Äôve been asked why they keep hounding Michael Cohen about the book deal and strictly speaking it‚Äôs because they want to convince congress that Michael Cohen is only saying these things to make money in the future off of talking about his actions with Donald Trump.
chairmen: are there any other illegal acts donald trump did that you haven't discussed	michael cohen [paraphrased]: yeah but i'm not allowed to talk about it because there are other court cases against donald trumps illegal actions as he obviously does many illegal things.
Micahel Cohen's disbarment has nothing to do with the fact that Donald Trump paid hush money and we have proof that Donald Trump paid hush money. The republicans are making repeated spectacle to avoid the inevitable truth that Donald Trump lied and we have proof.
democrat: if we say one lie makes a witness entirely void, every single organized crime case would never be able to go to court because we need criminals to come clean about their actions to prove actions took place.		republicans: well here's another emotional argument.
michael cohen: not one single question has been asked about mr. trump which is why i am here, all of the questions are regarding my past, which is not why i am here today.
michael cohen: donald trump has told over 9000 lies why aren't you talking about that	republicans: *flabbergasted*
@Typhonatemybaby YES
chairmen: did you ever see donald trump threaten to physically hurt someone		Michael Cohen: no he would pay others to.		me: üò¨
The republicans do not have legal documentation proving Cohen is lying .. The republicans only have emotional arguments they can make.
We do not have to believe Michael Cohen‚Äôs words, because we have LEGAL DOCUMENTATION that his words are truth.		The republicans keep trying to make us disbelieve in his character, we don‚Äôt need to believe in his character. We have proof outside of his voice.
The republicans show repeatedly they care far more about money than about the truth, which is why they keep trying to prove Cohen is somehow being paid despite us only having proof he was paid TO LIE.
THE ENTIRE REASON COHEN LIED IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP PAID HIM TO.
it‚Äôs the definition of projection being that donald trump is the one who pays people to lie for him, which we have proof of.
the republicans refuse to acknowledge the legal documentation that verifies what cohen says and instead try to invent some secret plan where the democrats guide cohen as a witness and are secretly paying him off with NO PROOF OF THIS
michael cohens case consists of repeated documentation to prove everything he has been saying
the republicans are trying to imply michael cohen is a witness concocted by the democrats despite not having any proof. and they keep asking repeatedly to try and prove donald trumps actions are the fault of the democrats.
LMAO the judge is tired of republicans shit:		judge: You are out of questioning time. Cohen you may answer the question		cohen: I don't understand what you're referring to		republican questioner: *opens mouth*		judge: Alright next questioner
donald trump: *lies constantly*		michael cohen: i lied to protect donald trump because donald trump encourages everyone to lie for him. i am now coming clean because donald trump no longer pays me.		republicans: uhm.. we're going to ignore the trump thing and just repeat u lied
michael cohen: i lied to congress to protect donald trump while he was still paying me money.		republicans: uhm, this man lied to congress, we aren't going to say what he lied about or to who but uhm should we really trust this dude ...
The republicans in this case do not care about the truth, and they do not care about Michael Cohen‚Äôs lies, what they care about is the fact that he‚Äôs told the truth AFTER THE FACT.
Michael Cohen has no income, has no book deals, has NOTHING to give him incentive to continue being in court.		All he is doing is making himself look bad to the public to clear up his previous lie.
Michael Cohen lied to PROTECT Donald Trump when he was still under the financial coverage of Donald Trump.		the republicans repeatedly keep trying to prove Michael Cohen has some financial incentive to lie currently, but cannot prove this to be the case.
The republicans keep stating that Michael Cohen has lied to congress, but refuse to say WHY and for WHO he lied to congress		https://t.co/ggnfx2KBXQ

Juvenile Detention Centers are child torture centers built to traumatize children so bad they can no longer function in regular society, thus assuring a fresh adult prison population with fresh adult prison slaves.
If you think a child smoking a blunt is a fucking illegal act that deserves legal penalties because weed "fucks up a childs body and mind" WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK JUVI DOES TO THEM
child: i smoked a blunt once.		juvenile detention centers: lets use military torture tactics on this child for months. this seems reasonable to me.
Juvenile Detention Center's infrastructure is irreparably damaging to children.		They torture children and mostly for marijuana possession. It's disgusting.		It must be destroyed there is nothing we can salvage from this horrific system of abuse.

88 Isakson, Johnny - (R - GA) @SenatorIsakson sneakily uses "farmers" to hint that he totally cares about the poor, but by farmers he means basically rich people who own land.
87 Johnson, Ron - (R - WI) @SenRonJohnson the second account I've noticed, next to @PattyMurray who actually lets people know when he's writing the tweets. thinks quantity is better than quality. classic.
86 Kennedy, John - (R - LA) @SenJohnKennedy classic racist republican makes his name in white supremacy, nothing new here.
85 Kyl, Jon - (R - AZ) @SenJonKyl this is the first account i've seen ran like this. whoever runs it just puts quotes of his on twitter. it's really weird. and for 13k followers, not really well done.
84 Lankford, James - (R - OK) @SenatorLankford i mean his twitter displays him as your average christian allegedly g-d fearing man that loves killing the poor.  i think all his votes come from rich christians telling poor christians they'll go to hell if they don't vote for him.
83 Leahy, Patrick J. - (D - VT) @SenatorLeahy driving home the fact that donald trump legitimately wants to shut down the united states government therefore harming millions of people ... in order to force people into funding a wall that is fundamentally racist.
82 Lee, Mike - (R - UT) @SenMikeLee the surreal thing is you see all of these accounts for all of these senators trying so hard to make everything they do look appropriate for their voting pools.
81 Moran, Jerry - (R - KS) @JerryMoran The more republicans I see supporting #FIRSTStepAct , the more stressed out I get. You know it's not going to be good. You can just tell. you know they're getting one over us.
80 Murkowski, Lisa - (R - AK) @lisamurkowski yep she's from alaska. case closed. she talks with bill gates like a friend so you know you can't trust her.
79 Murray, Patty - (D - WA) @PattyMurray oo she actually tells you when she's legitimately on her twitter. that's something I haven't seen out of the 79 senators I have reviewed so far. So if you want to actually see a tweet from a real live senator you can catch one here.
78 Paul, Rand - (R - KY) @RandPaul idk all i can think about this hip young celebrity senator bad boy [like @tedcruz and @SenWarren ] is that why are all the shittiest people named like that. ayn rand. rand paul. paul ryan. ron paul. like theyre all the same.
77 Portman, Rob - (R - OH) @senrobportman is out here proving ohio is if the midwest was in the south. https://t.co/p5agtdgjO3
76 Rubio, Marco - (R - FL) @marcorubio another one of those hip young celebrity senators like @tedcruz and @SenSanders very well run account, obviously. yall already know he's Like That though I ain't got nothin more to say.
75 Schatz, Brian - (D - HI) @SenBrianSchatz [but it looks like he mostly uses @brianschatz ] I will sum him up in two tweets https://t.co/9cgr01MhAb
74 Schumer, Charles E. - (D - NY) @SenSchumer actually straight up says he doesn't like trump unlike @SenToomey who is proud of being the 19th most bipartisan senator. these are just things I've learned today.
73 Scott, Tim - (R - SC) @SenatorTimScott concerned with research in preventing diseases, nice. seems to genuinely care about disability at least from going only off of the twitter. but like you know what kills disabled people? capitalism.
72 Shelby, Richard C. - (R - AL) @SenShelby oh whoever runs this account does a really good job. I'm not saying they're saying great things. But it's very well run. organized. I don't usually see this on many republican accounts. You definitely can see what they're doing.
"the press refuses to cover the good things we the senate do." I mean fear mongering does sell? But there is a lot to be afraid of.
71 Thune, John - (R - SD) @SenJohnThune not very active twitter, not very interesting twitter. professes concern for agriculture but mostly uses this twitter as for the aesthetic of nationalistic propaganda
Answer: My preference is to improve our background check system "and those who are dangerously mentally ill" damn, he's really going to call raging misogyny and white supremacy mental illness huh. @SenToomey what of the multi-millionaire shooter in vegas? never would be prevented
Next question: "This week is the anniversary of the sandy hook attack it seems like every day I read about children who find their parents guns and murder and main themselves and others what will you do in terms of legislation regarding safely securing firearms"
The combination of reduced minimum sentences and the ability to earn time off for reduced behavior hes saying will hurt prosecutors from harming legitimate big crime bosses, but like come on @SenToomey ... this is already how it is.
2nd part reward good prisoners with time off when they participate in programs meant to allegedly help them. 		here is his concern and he has not made a final decision:
now @SenToomey is explaining what this bill is in his words. 1 [sentencing reform] category, it does reduce mandatory minimum sentences that people are subjected to for crimes they commit, esp. if not explicitly violent.
"I want to ask about the first step act, it's going to be brought to the floor in the senate. I would strongly urge you to pass the bill, because society has become too punitive without thinking about the actual results to our society."
he makes sure to call america a republic ... lol.
What I get from most of these callers is they are scared of all the fighting. @SenToomey says that the news only really wants to report on when everyones fighting. Claims he wants stronger term limits on politicians but the supreme court is like Nah.
"Canada has a very restricted regime" this is the funniest sentence I've ever heard. thank you @SenToomey
He says there's more growth to be had and I'm torn which is more important? To comfort people in their plight dealing with our political infrastructure or to continue endlessly pointing out whats wrong. He's doing an alright job at doing both but in doing both he says nothing.
I mean we're living in squalor. He's claiming we're seeing upwards pressure on wages. But where? People think 15 dollars is an acceptable minimum wage. That's horrific. Especially with the egregious wealth concentration we see.
He says he disagrees with the opinion that the economy is not growing. My question is: is the economy what we should be concerned with? Is it not more important to account for the standard of living? Is it not more important to account for folks being able to retire?
well @SenToomey is saying that donald trump is a brick wall he's forced to work with. wants bob mueller to finish his investigation
"I'm an independent I'm concerned republicans are standing firm with trump and so many of his team have had interactions with the russians, i'm more concerned with republicans in congress not being a check and balance on trump" is a question asked by fred
I feel like you can hear the stress in his voice over his frustration on people's opinions about the wall but he wants votes so he's like "hey. uh let me talk around the issue because i'm really not going to make you happy with my opinion and what i want to do."
damn we got this super racist lady on here. she wants the government to shut down because she wants a wall to support her white supremacy. ... he's like trying to tell her she's wild as fuck without being rude lol.
he was ranked the 19th most bipartisan senator out of 100, which I mean feels like you stand for nothing because you're constantly trying to appease folks. lots of racist folks calling in are yall surprised?
he was just asked "what are you doing to try and make progress for the american people" he basically just said he can't control these hooligans in congress and he's sorry. I'm paraphrasing. I'm just going off of what he's saying I don't know anything else.
He doesn't want a government shutdown, which like yeah reasonable. Real salty towards republicans, and I mean who wouldn't be. "about 95% of all government activity is already approved and in the works" so he's saying that 5% is the one that's going to hurt us.
He's talking about all the things he's happy congress has gotten done. Mentioning the record low unemployment levels, but I'm curious if this is truly a good sign or actually a sign of people being unable to search for jobs they want and simply take whatever they can get to eat.
Alright @SenToomey is live right now and i'm going to talk about what i think about it. you can listen to him https://t.co/m02mPQHNVq here
70 Toomey, Patrick J. - (R - PA) @SenToomey holy shit i'm going to spend some time listening to this man talk on the phone he's literally right here https://t.co/m02mPQHNVq i'm just going to listen to this dude that's all i got for him rn. im going to live tweet it.
69 Van Hollen, Chris - (D - MD) @ChrisVanHollen is out here begging GM to stop ruining poor people's lives.
68 Wyden, Ron - (D - OR) @RonWyden i was already following this dude. you know the whole oregon thing. i think this is the democratic senator they use in oregon to appeal to like the uninhabited parts of oregon that i'm from.
67 Young, Todd - (R - IN) @SenToddYoung First of the class III senators I'm doin and all I get from this twitter is: "Hoosiers, get your hoosiers here, did i tell you i serve hoosiers, i just need to get the word in one more time HOOSIERS üò§ thanks for your votes"
@thehill comey literally wants us all dead. absolutely wild. hes just going out there and saying that right there
tomorrow i'll do class III senators. üîçüëÄ
66 Alexander, Lamar - (R - TN) @SenAlexander last of the class II senators. four words come to mind "drug fear mongering" and "racism" hes got someone decent to run the account for him though. they're really polishing up his trash takes. if you like polished garbage here u go
65 Booker, Cory A. - (D - NJ) @CoryBooker oh this is another one of those hot celebrity senators like @SenSanders @SenWarren and @tedcruz
64 Capito, Shelley Moore - (R - WV) @SenCapito she's trying to have the aesthetic of a democrat while still actively hurting the poor. republicans really don't know what they're going to do when more poor people start voting and the gerrymandering doesn't fix it in this system.
63 Cassidy, Bill - (R - LA) @BillCassidy this dude looks like he's on the human version of horsing around. uhh i have an image that sums him up. https://t.co/0gc9tRcWnP
62 Collins, Susan M. - (R - ME) @SenatorCollins a republican that supports and helps fund libraries? it feels like an onion article.
@HatsuneNiko @SenJoniErnst it's just ... an incredible piece of art imo. incredible doesn't necessitate positive connotations.
61 Coons, Christopher A. - (D - DE) @ChrisCoons this dude cares way less about delaware's importance than @SenatorCarper he's onto bigger fish i guess. this is one of the better ran twitters i've found in terms of actually talking.
60 Cornyn, John - (R - TX) @JohnCornyn you can tell which senators had some interns, or they themselves, majorly mess up because they'll all have "RTs =/= endorsements" in their profile description and it's like hmmmm what made this necessary?
59 Cotton, Tom - (R - AR) @SenTomCotton thinks patriot is a good word. i mean they all do. but he says it. uh whoever runs this account is kind of funny. i mean it's to cover up horrors, but like you know give and take. this man likes to have hot takes.
@HatsuneNiko @SenJoniErnst it's still really funny to me. maybe i just have no taste. that's possible. üòî
58 Daines, Steve - (R - MT) @SteveDaines yep he's from montana. I legit can't tell if he just hired someone really incompetent to run his account or if that's literally him. i want to believe he actually posts on this thing sometimes.
57 Durbin, Richard J. - (D - IL) @SenatorDurbin understandably worried about how racist arizona is so i mean that's good news that some folks in congress still give a shit at that level.
56 Enzi, Michael B. - (R - WY) @SenatorEnzi let me write something i think he would say "I'm just your average, thousand dollar suit wearing, working class, fishin, family man. i love coal and destroying the environment while i smoke cuban cigars"
55 Ernst, Joni - (R - IA) @SenJoniErnst she looks like a supermodel. but posts shit like this and has me losing my mind. this is the funniest tweet i've ever seen. do you think she legit runs her twitter and thats why it's like this ? https://t.co/J2Po4KrWmq
54 Gardner, Cory - (R - CO) @SenCoryGardner he looks like he smokes weed but on the DL because he works for the usa and doesn't wanna lose his job. he definitely is the reason marijuana arrests on youths increased after its legalization in colorado.
53 Graham, Lindsey - (R - SC) @LindseyGrahamSC theres a lot to unpack here just in the first retweet i don't even know where to start. this is the first republican where i really gotta sit here and remember they're like this but publicly.
52 Hyde-Smith, Cindy - (R - MS) @cindyhydesmith last tweets were in november not even worth reviewing not used. 		this image is how i feel about this twitter https://t.co/yuotcEbImU
51 Inhofe, James M. - (R - OK) @JimInhofe he wants trumps wall like legit so i mean you do the math on what kinda dude this is.
50 Jones, Doug - (D - AL) @SenDougJones this guy looks like a union boss caricature. doesn't talk about anything all that important from a glance. if he was a 16 year old emo from 2006 his myspace username would be xXsupport_our_troopsxX
49 Markey, Edward J. - (D - MA) @SenMarkey doesn't want another cold war from what i can tell. markey u should talk to @SenatorRisch about why he wants a cold war II.
48 McConnell, Mitch - (R - KY) @SenMajLdr LMAO THIS IS SO FUNNY. this is secretly a burn against george h. w. bush "I am honored to announce today that the late President George H.W. Bush will lie in state in the United States Capitol Rotunda." he's happy bush is dead, it says so
47 Merkley, Jeff - (D - OR) @SenJeffMerkley tbh i was already following this guy because im from oregon. whoever runs this account actually knows how to use twitter, unlike me.
46 Perdue, David - (R - GA) @sendavidperdue this guy looks like if mitt romney grew up poorer and in georgia and cared less about his looks. the account is very good at saying absolutely nothing while having the aesthetic of saying things.
45 Peters, Gary C. - (D - MI) @SenGaryPeters this guy I just know probably really likes Jeff Bezos "make the student a customer" idea.
44 Reed, Jack - (D - RI) @SenJackReed another old dude who knows better than to run his own twitter. i can tell a millennial wrote this stuff though. you can smell it. it smells like my generation.
43 Risch, James E. - (R - ID) @SenatorRisch this dude doesn't run his own twitter, naturally. he definitely wants a sequel to the cold war.
the more senators i rate and follow the more i can see which ones hate each other https://t.co/1e54t6eUpc
42 Roberts, Pat - (R - KS) @SenPatRoberts this dude hired someone who knows how to write clickbait to run his twitter. like i wouldn't expect him to do that, because most of the republicans don't. he wants that image pristine tho. walking that line of hating yet needing the poor
41 Rounds, Mike - (R - SD) @SenatorRounds this dude really likes @tedcruz is ted cruz like the republican's bad boy they all look up to? he also really wants to destroy the environment but i mean he's a republican from south dakota that's like saying water is wet.
40 Sasse, Ben - (R - NE) @SenSasse well like... he sure puts the sass in sasse. https://t.co/tkJFHBZrtp
39 Shaheen, Jeanne - (D - NH) @SenatorShaheen i just really like how many other senators are basically like "haha wow climate change and poor infrastructure are really hurting my state" and new hampshire is like "that's wild. yall take care now"
38 Smith, Tina - (D - MN) @TinaSmithMN is one of those democrats that would say something like "we need more female CEOs" and i think that sums her up.
37 Sullivan, Dan - (R - AK) @SenDanSullivan it goes without saying that this man does not run his own twitter. whoever does run his twitter does a real good job at being bland and takeless. like they're doing their job as they are paid to it's clear.
36 Tillis, Thom - (R - NC) @SenThomTillis looks like a football coach at a state university which feels fitting for north carolina. has some scary takes on prison reform i'll tell you that. he's a huge @MittRomney fanboy. calm down my dude.
35 Udall, Tom - (D - NM) @SenatorTomUdall was really on that #SavannasAct which is great, i'm glad both the new mexico senators aren't completely horrifying. @MartinHeinrich is still the senator i've found to have the strongest fear of climate change ill be lookin for a contender
34 Warner, Mark R. - (D - VA) @MarkWarner allegedly stunned that americans don't understand just how much our data is being collected but like my dude everyone pretty much lives under the haunting knowledge that mark zuckerberg will see everything we ever do.
we'd make fun of everyones makeup in the 1800s and before tbh and they deserve it. the hooligans. the things they put on their faces!!!
later today i will review all class II us senators
@_ryannyman of course i am, it's mandatory. it use to be called taxes.
alright, here's my mild take of the day, nixon didn't make hale boggs plane disappear, but in the drone images actually found the plane, and out of sheer pettiness because boggs hated him ... told them to say they found nothing and to lose the images that are lost to this day
instagram disguising fun new ways to manage and store your data as an accessibility feature. https://t.co/iId4vmdx64
@lottiesnips noo!!!!
social security: hey we noticed the cost of living went up substantially where you live. heres 2 dollars.
RT @amber_queercun2: elon out here with some praxis https://t.co/2Onm04unlh
they keep bolstering that defense budget because the united states cannot exist as wealthy as it is without stealing from somewhere.
33 Baldwin, Tammy - (D - WI) @SenatorBaldwin last of the class I senators, really health care driven in everything she does on twitter. she also cares about water infrastructure which yall know i'm a sucker for. i'm keen on anyone lookin to improve the infrastructure.
32 Barrasso, John - (R - WY) @SenJohnBarrasso this is like if nationalistic country music had a twitter.
31 Brown, Sherrod - (D - OH) @SenSherrodBrown this guys allegedly wants to corporations to pay for eating up tax dollars by relying on employees to receive state benefits instead of you know paying them a livable wage.
30 Cantwell, Maria - (D - WA) @SenatorCantwell wants people to have access to public lands, instead of keeping folks off land their taxes pay for....
29 Cardin, Benjamin L. - (D - MD) @SenatorCardin this guy he's real frustrated congress can't get anything done. he's hoppin mad. forreal tho that's his thing. he's not happy with congress.
28 Carper, Thomas R. - (D - DE) @SenatorCarper he's really sad Delaware isn't considered that important by most folks and a lot of people can't really point to it on a map.
27 Casey, Robert P., Jr. - (D - PA) @SenBobCasey on george h. w. bush "As President, he promoted democracy in the former Soviet Union" and i just think that's a hilarious thing for a democrat to be saying. you know they're scared.
26 Corker, Bob - (R - TN) @SenBobCorker unusually large head. afraid to talk about legitimate issues. no guts.
25 Cruz, Ted - (R - TX) @tedcruz i'd believe this dude actually runs his twitter sometime because you know he's a bitch for the drama. he is ... to make an understatement: a bad person, yes.
24 Donnelly, Joe - (D - IN) @SenDonnelly pays folks to run his twitter but they do a shit job at it.
23 Feinstein, Dianne - (D - CA) @SenFeinstein the dude from new mexico @MartinHeinrich is way more afraid of climate change than her. both are still very scared of climate change. but if it were a competition we know who won.
22 Fischer, Deb - (R - NE) @SenatorFischer she's definitely fallen for one of those chain emails that ask you to give them money for some cause, and then she found out it was fake and has never trusted again.
21 Flake, Jeff - (R - AZ) @JeffFlake do you think jeff flake knows the usa killed Martin Luther King Jr. ? With this dude I legit don't know the answer. You can just tell @tedcruz knows it, but doesn't talk about it.
20 Gillibrand, Kirsten E. - (D - NY) @SenGillibrand she wants more women in politics. all these old male republican senators have garbage twitters they don't know how to use because they don't care about interacting with legitimate people. from looks she tries.
19 Hatch, Orrin G. - (R - UT) @senorrinhatch aesthetically speaking, this is the dude they designed house of cards after. he does not run his own twitter. i think you all know why.
18 Heinrich, Martin - (D - NM) @MartinHeinrich I feel like he's the first senator I've seen that appears to legitimately fear climate change, which I mean at least we know he's not dead inside.
17 Heitkamp, Heidi - (D - ND) @SenatorHeitkamp I feel like she's doing what people wanted her to do when she was elected at least from a twitter glance. driving home violence against native women is an epidemic.
16 Heller, Dean - (R - NV) @SenDeanHeller i feel like this dude doesn't know how to use a computer and i just want you to know he served on the commerce, science and transportation committee.
15 Hirono, Mazie K. - (D - HI) @maziehirono "because of Republicans‚Äô refusal to confirm qualified minority women, and their insistence on filling it with a man whose career is filled examples of his using the law to advance a racist, obstructionist, plainly un-American agenda."
14 Kaine, Tim - (D - VA) @timkaine this sums him up: ‚ÄúThis president has a very dangerous belief that he doesn‚Äôt need Congress for anything and he can do whatever he wants,‚Äù Kaine said. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to war making, I think that should scare everybody.‚Äù
13 King, Angus S., Jr. - (I - ME) @SenAngusKing on that FCC map again @AjitPaiFCC why are you like this? everyone is out here telling you your every mistake, and you're still like this. is the money that good? is that all you care about? you cannot feign ignorance.
12 Klobuchar, Amy - (D - MN) @amyklobuchar she's out here trying to remind folks that vaccines stop people from dying. because you know... people keep forgetting that....
11th Manchin, Joe, III - (D - WV) @Sen_JoeManchin he's challenging the FCC I like that, hearing again about those sketchy bad maps. what's good @AjitPaiFCC
10th McCaskill, Claire - (D - MO) @clairecmc I'm just going to leave you with this quote to sum her up "I support securing the border. I think some in my party go too far when they scream at people in restaurants and advocate violence against Republicans."
9th Menendez, Robert - (D - NJ) @SenatorMenendez bob has his hand at comedy, doesn't like mark zuckerberg. hates offshore drilling, good. Kind of looks like @JebBush if you squint.
8th Murphy, Christopher - (D - CT) @ChrisMurphyCT uhh antigun, talking about yemen, thinks the US shouldn't pull out. actually talking about the exploitation of student athletes. https://t.co/gCTWGlfDSr people didn't like his joke as much as his other posts.
@theomegajojo purgatory.
7th Nelson, Bill - (D - FL) @SenBillNelson lmao ... i mean theyre all gonna do it but here they profess concern for the environment while they gotta' honor and respect the folks who destroyed it. oh he also has some sketchy stuff on drug control keep an eye on him üîçüëÄ
6th Sanders, Bernard - (I - VT) @SenSanders all i want to do for bernie sanders is post this map, folks go hog wild for bernie. https://t.co/WFa8UTOni4
5th Stabenow, Debbie - (D - MI) @stabenow yikes we got her praising bush and mccain and saying how we need to learn from them and then being like "i don't want people making careers out of destroying the environment" like... lol okay mixed signals here.
4th Tester, Jon - (D - MT) @SenatorTester who is literally telling the USA people need to actually do their jobs when it comes to native women calling for a hearing on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women epidemic on December 12, 2018.
3rd, Warren, Elizabeth - (D - MA) @SenWarren this senator everyone knows and she hasn't forgotten puerto rico, that's good.
2nd: Whitehouse, Sheldon - (D - RI) @SenWhitehouse he's got the usual democrat stuff going on professes concern about the environment, frequently talking about climate change and likes fancy cars. sounds like a democrat from rhode island, yeah.
alright first man up senator Wicker, Roger F. - (R - MS) @SenatorWicker we got him talking over here about gettin rural folks some internet. apparently the FCC was letting some intentionally sketchy mapping slide out here allegedly screwing over the rural poor. cool so far.
im gonna follow every single US senators twitter. because thats a thing i can do. then i can see what terrible shit they're saying.

it‚Äôs always ‚Äúwould you go back in time and kill hitler to stop WWII‚Äù as if that would have stopped it. hitler could have been anyone because of the vehement hate for the jews. blamed for every problem capitalism caused every problem nationalism caused. and look what happened.
this is why we‚Äôre coming up on repeating what we all said we never would repeat. mark my fucking words. they know people are angry don‚Äôt let them give you a scapegoat that defies material reality once again.
when the holocaust is taught to children in the usa they dont tend to talk about the horrors of nationalism or the destructive nature of capitalism. they pin everything on a singular evil person. completely ignoring the material conditions leading up to his existence.
more young people in america are against capitalism than for it. this barrage of antisemitism is intentionally constructed to preserve the suffering of all. they want people to hate the jews so everyone can ignore the capitalist knife placed in our collective chests.
before the holocaust happened anticapitalism was reaching a peak, people were thinking critically about its flaws and to cover it up they blamed all the horrors of capitalism on the jews to pull attention from their capitalist transgression and thats exactly what theyre doing now
in fact it would make it even less accessible to the poor and marginalized because if it were made into a national holiday capitalists wouldnt stop themselves from monetizing it forcing all their laborers to further cater to the upper classes just like labor day.
they say that voting should be a national holiday so that more people can vote but when have the poor and marginalized ever had a national holiday off.
republicans in north carolina actively make attempts to hide their partys voting decisions because they know if people saw how despicable they truly are they could never get enough votes.

which i mean you know is to say no matter how rich the entertainment class gets they only have their labor to sell, and therefore have have much to gain in the abolition of capitalism as the rest of the proletariat do. at least i'm pretty sure thats what it means. like i said idk
I'm just taking a shot in the dark here, cuz idk anything, but in neo yokio the magistocratic class are to the rich of neo yokio, as the wealthy entertainers are to our rich. which is why the constant theme is that they'll never be truly accepted by the rich: only a passing fad

if you can commit a crime and the only penalty thereafter is monetary ... it's classist. i don't care if there are adjustments, i don't care if their are monetary ratios based on the people's incomes or wealth ... it's always going to be classist. there's no way you can remedy it
cash bail systems as punishment for crime while one waits for trial in america are notoriously classist. the law is literally stating ‚Äúyou can commit the crime and wind up without consequences if you can afford it.‚Äù

capitalism: murders hundreds of millions every single year without fail	neoliberal: you see like they were just lazy and had to go like it's not capitalisms fault that capitalism murdered them and that they wouldn't have died had capitalism not been the commonly accepted ideology
america: murders over 250,000 people in the name of capitalism	neoliberal: no you see the vietnam war is different we're trying to liberate them
all of these men are out here saying mollie tibbetts is to blame for her own murder and we're going to pretend this is a problem with immigrants? give me a break, men will do so much to avoid facing responsibility for the structure of misogyny they build and enforce.
i'm just throwing this out there but deportation is literally never the answer and it will never be the answer, regardless of who is being deported. that goes for anyone. its a method of violence currently reserved for the state, a power they should not have.

@AdumB_456 what happened?
then add in the fact that these doctors are the very people from the upper class viewing the poor with such disdain.
everything poor people do to maintain their health is seen as frivolous extravagance by the upper classes
it's considered a grave social more breach when you go to the ER or see a doctor for something you're pretty sure wont kill you immediately.
poor people are quite literally expected to shorten their lives, and worsen their quality of living instead of asking for help to alleviate their pain and suffering.

@XXVmusic poll closing....... i can go on for a long time.
@XXVmusic it's when you enact a law have infrastructure that exists in a way that inhibits people's ability to vote. 	see: voter ID laws [where you can't vote unless you have an ID] or.... you can't vote for someone unless you put that you were a member of their party. gerrymandering
love how politicians are using one oppressed group to marginalize another. georgia closing down all its polls in areas that consist of mostly black voters and claiming it's just because polling places don't comply with some disabilities act like shut the fuck up. u never cared.
voter suppression is so normalized in the usa that americans don't even notice voter suppression laws for what they are. we just consider it a fact of life. 		folks from other countries lookin inward are always shocked when I tell them about common laws here regarding voting

cantor was honestly such a mood. he's this famous mathematician right. came up with the continuum hypothesis anyway every time people would try to discredit his work he'd take it as a huge personal offense and go into depression spirals.

@Anarchoadam2 oh you think? whys that

me to the nazi that told me to kill myself: the world would be better without you		twitter: We just revised our policy on dehumanizing speech and have found you guilty of breaching it. your account will be suspended for the next month.
so twitters drafting some policy about "dehumanizing speech" not being allowed, and how much you wanna bet they're just going to go hard after all the marginalized people defending themselves.

people are losing their lives getting caught up in and fighting the wildfires in california, but instead of helping donald trump would rather bicker about how wildfires work despite his complete and total lack of knowledge in this field while refusing to listen to anyone else.
california firefighters: hey, we've never complained about needing more water	donald trump: that's because you're ignorant and don't understand fires like I do.	california firefighters: yes, us who work with fires daily don't understand them unlike you and your 0 fire experience https://t.co/fXNXuZD50M
make no mistake, the fires in california are as bad as they are because of how politicians handled policies leading up to this fact.
justice system: we need to punish criminals for their wrongdoings	people: but arent you kind of just going around making up reasons to criminalize people which is why our prison population only increases instead of decreases proving you're either worsening or causing the problem
at the end of the day you have to decide whether or not you want to punish someone who commits a crime, or fix the fucking problem. Cause punishment for punishments sake ain't goddamn doin it and it never will
No officer should ever have sex with an inmate in prison, this shouldn't be a fucking controversial opinion. It's rape. Straight up. Under any context. It always is.

tell me how fucking frequently you hear for the calling of the elderly to no longer be able to vote. it's cannibalism of the poor and they goddamn well know it.
seriously tho blaming all baby boomers for socioeconomic decisions made by the ruling class is absurd and displaces where the blame should properly be appointed. youre going to tell me millennials like zuckerberg are innocent? give me a break.

these people have learned about the holocaust, these people have heard from holocaust survivers, these people have seen images of the holocaust, these people are grown fucking adults with similar knowledge on the holocaust to everyone else

everyone in naruto after they watch him exhibit godlike powers: haha, wow cool, anyway, whats going on with sasuke
@ren_bacchus in the very beginning he literally exhibits GODLIKE POWER with the sheer amount of /shadow clones/ he makes NOT CLONES, but shadow clones, which again is something not even any of the hokages could have done. and they just look at this and they're like "wow neat, anyway"
@ren_bacchus like how are you suppose to appreciate just how wild they are when ALL YOU EVER SEE IS THE VERY BEST. like at least in boruto they show that no.. literally no one can make clones like naruto and ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE WITH NARUTO IS THE FACT THAT
@ren_bacchus they didn't play it up at all and tbh i think it's because the writing was bad in naruto lmao, and IMO THEY PLAY UP THE FACT that sasuke and naruto just aren't human [basically] in boruto much better like in naruto all you see is god-like ninja and you never get a feel for norms
how. https://t.co/A9RJGY8EwT

who else‚Äôs last name will be erased from history because of this chain of events involving justice kennedy? 		how many more families are going to be destroyed ‚Äúdemocratically‚Äù
great grandmother‚Äôs last name was wiped completely off this planet because of the holocaust, 		because of a man who was democratically elected, 		because of a political climate that allowed such horrific injustices
how can we possibly change the way the supreme court justices are chosen when even when we work together as a massive collective we still can't sway the allegedly representative government to side with the people?
people fought HARD for net neutrality and they still fucking repealed it, everyone was working together trying to stop that, that was a group effort by the american people, and it, thus far, has failed. put that into consideration when talking about the supreme court
how will you use the government process to take down the government? they say to let the american people choose the supreme court justices and do any of you truly believe that will be allotted?
the retirement of justice kennedy means what we all know and have known was going to happen ... is about to happen.

being friends with all the previously gifted kids in college and them thinking i'm one of them bein all like "you know what I mean?" No, I do not know what you mean. They thought I was STUPID. until I was 16.
I'd have friends in college be like "oh don't you ever just feel the pressure of having to always be the successful kid you were in childhood" and I'm like lmaaaaooooo childhood me would look at current me as if I were a god.
see professors at my university, they thought i was smart as hell [some of them] and they'd be like "oh you musta been told you were gifted all your life" and i'm like "nah they thought i was stupid as bricks" and they'd be fucking floored.
they also thought i was stupid as shit when i come up to them not knowing which hand i wrote with because i just wrote with both equally and instead of being like "oh this bitch is ambi" they were like "you're stupid as hell what the fuuuck"
they also did this when i couldn't tell the difference between my colors, they didn't think "that kids colorblind" they thought "wow what a complete and total waste of stupid space" thanks kindergarten teacher
lmao i had to go to summer school in 2nd grade to learn how to read because i'm dyslexic and they never figured out i was dyslexic until i was out of college so they were just like "that kids just an idiot"

california has 124 billionaires living within its borders, for scale, the usa has the most billionaires in the world at 585, China #2 at 476, and India #3 with 131, and then California comes in 4th in the world, but still has the highest poverty rating in the usa
thats an economy bigger than the UK, France, India, Italy, etc.

@xchinmay well technology isn't a monolith, and not all aspects of it are profitable, ergo not all types of technology are invested in. 		i mean it would be ideal to automate a lot of things, but it's just too expensive currently, and isn't looking like it'll be feasible soon.
the threat of automation is nothing but a scare tactic meant to stop workers from fighting for a livable wage because the capitalists want to squeeze every penny out of the working class. https://t.co/dNdWjCGK8Q
even when you pay minimum wage workers a livable wage they're still cheaper than automating their jobs lmao.
technology necessarily needs capitalists to pay the exact cost of its worth, less it no longer be functional. 		capitalists know human workers do not need to be paid their full worth to be productive.		hence the threat of automation being all pointless posturing.
