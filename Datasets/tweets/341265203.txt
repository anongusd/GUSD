I strongly want the #ElectoralCollege to remain in place. I don't want populous liberal/leftist states like California deciding elections.
I will not shed any tears if @TheDemocrats select the radical Keith Ellison as DNC Chairman. It means more victories for #Republicans.
Further, @TheDemocrats came across as arrogant and elitist to many voters, including me. Elitism is one thing Americans historically hate.
The reason @realDonaldTrump won was that he tapped into voters' disgust with the current political class. #draintheswamp makes this clear.
According to @thehill, @TheDemocrats lost another 46 legislative seats in 2016, slipping to the lowest point in modern times.
@AdamComedian You might want to check Colorado. The GOP has a 7,360-vote lead in early voting there.
Do not let the #MSM depress you with early vote analysis! Get out and vote for @realDonaldTrump tomorrow!

Despite the 32,000-early vote cushion Hillary has in FL, this is nowhere near the 104,000 margin Obama had in 2012. He won by less than 1%.
@mitchellvii I agree. Also, the announcement is too close to Election Day to sink in and have an impact.
GOP will hold the Senate 51-49 thanks to @realDonaldTrump's surge in NH and @EvanBayh's epic collapse in IN. MO and NC will also go GOP.
@kncmcd007 I think that's mostly right, except for NC. Dems are underperforming their 2012 totals, so Trump will win there and in EC vote.

@NateSilver538 Is it possible that pollsters are completely stumped and just have no idea who will turn out this year?
@NateSilver538 Is there a truly conscious effort by a significant number of voters to split their tickets this year?
@NateSilver538 The two polls were conducted around the same time, so there is no recency effect to account for the large difference.
@NateSilver538 Shouldn't the Monmouth poll showing Heck up 3 in NV carry more weight than the CNN poll since it has a higher grade?
@NateSilver538 I think 538's model still strongly underestimates GOP chances. The low to mid 20s seems too low. HP's model puts GOP at 59%.
