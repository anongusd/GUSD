DID THE DOGS DO IT?		We're on verdict watch in Ionia Co		3 dogs accused of slashing the necks of 3 goats		If convicted, will be put to death
Closing arguments JUST wrapped up in the case of dogs v. goats (timecheck- 10:45pm 😱)		Judge MAY come back w/ a ruling tonight!		@wwmtnews
@Darcy_ISS @wwmtnews Believe it or not, we're still here!
Dr. VanSteenkiste: Very classic of a wild carnivore kill, particularly a coyote.		@wwmtnews
Dr. Andrea VanSteenkiste, vet assessment expert: The goats were mutilated, really torn up. The lesions are consistent w/ a skilled carnivore https://t.co/fJoI1o6r8O
It's 8:30pm &amp; we're still at it in the case of dogs v. goats in Ionia County		@SideCG @wwmtnews https://t.co/VZKinQITP2
Dr. Cavender: To perform such intense acts &amp; then be cool as cucumbers, I do not believe these dogs could have done it.		@wwmtnews
Dr. Ann Cavender, veterinary forensic expert: Dogs typically chase, then kill. If they killed the goats, they should be tired. They weren't. https://t.co/LfzEptNDs3
Defense: Lack of blood on dogs is direct evidence these dogs didn't kill these goats, is that correct?		Dr. Howenstine: In my opinion, yes.
Dr. Julie Howenstine, forensic consultant/blood evidence expert: I wondered where the blood was that should have been on the dogs?	@wwmtnews https://t.co/87xDMCfnGC
False alarm -- Judge says there's evidence to support the complaint and we will press forward with defense witnesses. Testimony continues...
Defense: Your Honor, we have not heard testimony from anyone that these dogs- Mario, Luigi &amp; Major- performed these kill bites!		@wwmtnews https://t.co/wX87rokdN0
Looks like we're headed into closing arguments... in the case of dogs v. goats		@wwmtnews
Bump: You may not see a significant amount of blood on the predator after these types of bites. The blood may ooze out postmortem.
Judge appears frustrated		"Let's get to the bottom of this! I want to know the truth about what happened to these goats."		@wwmtnews https://t.co/QEVs6m13a6
Bump: My conclusion was it was dogs that caused the death of the goats.		@wwmtnews
Bump: A throat-bite kill is typical of a coyote. However, there was no feeding on the animal. With coyotes, we almost always have feeding.
Adam Bump, @MichiganDNR furbearer specialist: There's not a case similar to this in the state of Michigan done by a coyote.		@wwmtnews

As Rowley's being handcuffed &amp; taken out of court, her mother yells: Trust in Him, baby! We love you.
BREAKING: Rowley sentenced to 10-20 years for superdrunk driving crash that killed a jogger
FYI- we are still in court, waiting on Rowley's sentence
Both sides are done speaking		Expecting sentence any minute		Superdrunk driving causing death &amp; leaving scene, w/ a prior DUI is 20yr felony
Holly Heil: Her choice that night should have been 4 simple words put any way you like: I need a ride. Take my keys please. etc
Holly Heil: Everyday you will open your eyes &amp; I hope the 1st image you see is hitting Nic. I will never forgive you for what you have done.
Holly Heil: YOU decided to get drunk w/ your friends. YOU decided to get in a car. YOU decided to run away after you hit Nic. You &amp; only you
My heart is pounding		The pain in this courtroom is palpable
Holly Heil, through tears: I'm not the same person I was and I never will be again. A piece of my heart was taken by a drunk driver.
This is incredibly intense		There is crying coming from all corners of the court		You can feel the emotion weighing on everyone in the room
Holly Heil, Nic's mom: It just breaks my heart. The woman sitting over there gave me a life sentence just like she gave Nic a death sentence
Heil's sister: Morgan wrote- 'I don't understand how his happened but I think God has a plan.' You drank &amp; you drove! This was not Gods plan
Dan Heil: You make choices &amp; you pay the price. I feel she deserves the maximum sentence.
Dan Heil: Everyday he is gone it's like a hole in my heart. For my family, I don't know if there's ever healing for that.
Dan Heil, victim's father: There isn't a day goes by I don't wake up in the morning thinking this is a nightmare. But it's not. He's gone.
Rowley turns to Heils: It weighs on my heart so heavily. I wish I could take away all the pain. I'm so sorry from the bottom of my heart.
Rowley, still in tears: I have a problem w/ drinking &amp; I want to seek help. It disgusts me when I think about it.
Can hear crying coming from both sides of courtroom audience
Rowley, sobbing: I wish I could take it back but I can't. I wish I could switch places with Nic but I can't.
Rowley in tears, approaches judge https://t.co/0CzHnbooeK
Judge denies motion to withdraw guilty plea		Getting ready to proceed with Rowley's sentence
Mediator: session was terminated bc it wouldn't have been productive to continue, everyone very emotional &amp; upset
Only witness so far= healing session mediator		Said victim's family was "inevitably" angry but respectful &amp; participated in 45min session
In Michigan, it means your BAC is more than twice the legal limit https://t.co/oX9MZFrGmo
Very unusual court proceeding		Defense unexpectedly asks to call Rowley's mother to the stand		Judge calls recess
Appears the defense is trying to argue that although victim's family did attend the healing session, they were not receptive to its purpose
Rowley's attorney filed an emergency motion to withdraw 1 of the guilty pleas		Has a witness on stand to explain why plea terms weren't met
Rowley's plea agreement was unprecedented in Kzoo criminal court		She pleaded guilty in exchange for a 'healing session' w/ victim's family
Morgan Rowley back in court		She is charged in a superdrunk driving crash that killed a jogger in Oshtemo https://t.co/KrzRZfogS6

Judge finds probable cause for murder charges		Brent Bogseth bound over for trial		Denied bond
Prosecutor: Brent seems to have a series of convenient excuses &amp; he tried to frame someone else by planting Kim's purse
Defense: no evidence of murder weapon, purely circumstantial case, Larry Brink was one who found body, nothing ties Brent to her death
D/Lt McCulfor: Brent said- "I know! It's always the husband."
D/Lt McCulfor: Brent- "This is becoming a Jerry Springer show." I said- "Who do you think he'd say did it, guy having affair or husband?"
D/Lt McCulfor: when we found the purse, it was soaking wet, which stood out to me as strange
Det Lt Mark McCulfor: before body was found- Brent said he found Kim's purse in yard of Larry Brink (alleged affair) https://t.co/P68no5lCmn
Barista @ coffeeshop Brent frequented: He asked me to call the cops pretending to be Kim and tell them I was okay		Says she refused
Evans: Brent found a suicide note in his pocket that he didn't remember writing, so they took him to the hospital (day before body found)
Police: Larry Brink found Kim's body
Defense: Brent believed Kim &amp; neighbor Larry Brink were having an affair
Evans (roommate): Under the impression that Brent &amp; Kim were splitting up
Brent/Kim's roommate Jon Evans on stand: Brent washed his clothes w/ so much bleach, when we did our laundry after it ruined our clothes
Det Lt Macyauski: Kimberly's remains, specifically her skull, showed signs of blunt force trauma
Det Lt Macyauski: Kimberly's body found a block &amp; a half from Bogseth home		Police found additional black trashbags &amp; hammer near porch
VBC Det Lt Macyauski on stand: "Very strong smell of decomposition" on trail. Body found wrapped in black trashbags. https://t.co/CylpCrOdX8
