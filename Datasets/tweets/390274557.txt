@FatimaSHusain By the way u ever seen a 250lb crackhead?
@FatimaSHusain Assumptions and deeogatory comments are not something educated people continue to do
@FatimaSHusain Did i say you did? No, i asked if you did. You keep making assumptions about me. I ask before i make assumptions.
@FatimaSHusain So you would like to see an American downfall?
@FatimaSHusain Is glad you think im uneducated. Males it easier for me to educate you and your misinformation campaigns.
@FatimaSHusain Yes they do. But still no muslim@out cry. Just as no condemnation from you
@sista_nah @IlhanMN Condemnationbu token groups lile CAIR doesnt mean anything.  What if a representativeor senator spoke at a banquet with a say a nazi group, or any terrorist group ? Their would be outrage. Almost silence on Ilhan speaking at CAIR banquet. And CAIR is terrorist affiliated Org
@sista_nah @IlhanMN They should be on posters Until mass condemnation by everyday muslims against jihadist attacks and teachings of imams that promote attacks then they are suspect of agreeimg with the attacks You have to see that. Everyone condemns violence for the most part, except muslim majority
@Fight4PublicEd @IlhanMN Look at this conversation please...the lady Fatima only replied to me not you as well. And maybe you will see what im saying. Read what she aays and my replies to her..They want condemnation of everything except the actions of thir own religion/ideology etc..
@FatimaSHusain Never said there werent American Muslims. But i do not see them mass condemning Muslim Jihadist attacks. Just as i see that you are not condemning them. Why is that fatima? Maybe because you like most muslims want a caliphate? you want muslim controlled world? Condemn them Fatima
@FatimaSHusain We can do this all day. Bottom line 99% of America  comdems any violence, but you never see muslim’s mass condemnation of  any terrorist attacks. Why is that Fatima? You want to debate this, then im your huckleberry
@FatimaSHusain i Definately condemn Gregory bush’s attacks . And yes keep namimg Fatima.  Are you going to comdemn the january Kenya muslim attacks? Or the ones that happen every damn day?? Lets hear it Fatima
@FatimaSHusain First of all no one orders me to do anything. Secondly i have condemned ANY and ALL white supremacy murders and again condemn them. But you have yet to show me any attacks. Are you going to condemn jihadist attacks against the world?
@Fight4PublicEd @IlhanMN Explain ask the same? They do condemn violence en mass. Im not sure what you are asking
@FatimaSHusain Show me all the white supremacy terrorism every day? Show me?? You cant!!! End of story. There are some ..but not every day ..not every month..just cuz a white person kills does not make it white supremacy.
@Fight4PublicEd @IlhanMN So what im asking of Muslims, Not tolen groups like CAIR or similiar, but everyday muslims to denounce jihadist attacks openly! To defy the imams that promote these teachings. By stayimg silent they supoort the actions of jihadists. There is no grey area in that.
@Fight4PublicEd @IlhanMN Sigh, no sir you as as well as many others refuse to acknowledgethe lack of condemnation of jihadist attacks by every day muslim people. That is a red flag sir. Their are extremists in every walk of life, but only one group beheads people on tv, only one group chamts desth to US
@sista_nah @IlhanMN Im sick of this—How many every day muslims condemned 9/11? How many everyday muslim people condemn continued jihadist attacks? Their silence speaks volumes. Can you not see that? Can you not see in other countries the issues they have attempting to settle muslim refugees? Wake UP
@Fight4PublicEd @IlhanMN Then debate this—How many every day muslims condemn 9/11? How many everyday muslim people condemn continued jihadist attacks? Their silence speaks volumes. Can you not see that? Can you not see in other countries the issues they have attempting to settle muslim refugees? Wake UP
@UserNameBlank24 @IlhanMN How many every day muslims condemn 9/11? How many everyday muslim people condemn continued jihadist attacks? Their silence speaks volumes. Can you not see that? Can you not see in other countries the issues they have attempting to settle muslim refugees? Wake UP
@RandyLawson2 @IlhanMN How many every day muslims condemn 9/11? How many everyday muslim people condemn continued jihadist attacks? Their silence speaks volumes. Can you not see that? Can you not see in other countries the issues they have attempting to settle muslim refugees? Wake UP
@RepDebHaaland @Ilhan Isn’t hate speech when it is the truth When will you politicians learn to stop allegiance to party and begin allegiance to the American people. How many every day muslims condemn 9/11 How many everyday muslim people condemn continued jihadist attacks? Their silence speaks volumes
@jacalyn567 @AmericanaHart @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN If you will study history you will see as I said above Islam isnt what you want to live under. We are fast becoming the modern day version of a declining Rome. Islam is our going to our Carthage/Hannibal, whom will step up to be our Scipio?
@jacalyn567 @AmericanaHart @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN That americanahart blocked me. Why are leftists so against any dialogue that does not fit theor view? I said nothing derogatory, or untruthful. If we allow more muslim believing people into power we will look like london or worse. Islam is NOT compatible with western views.
@donaldball @rayd1475 @sand57_jan @RashidaTlaib @jaketapper @IlhanMN What did the muslim silence about the 9/11 attacks and the continued muslim silence on jihadist attacks across the world say?

@CharredMC @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump I do not watch fox news. And i am duped by no one. Yout liberalism has caused the stste yhis country is in. And its going to stop.
@ProudResister @robinslj @HowardSchultz What we need is LESS politicians They do nothing Ryan. They are all rich and have no clue about the true people of America. The back bone of America is the 67% of us that make less than 100 grand a year. Keep on pushing liberalism and that 67% is going to resist is a severe way.
@ProudResister @robinslj @AOC Smh ...only people not terrified are the ones that support taking care of everyone and every place on the planet except your own country. She is a disaster and if you cant see that then you sir are blind.
@ProudResister @robinslj LOL...are you proud of the fiscal stand in you proud liberal state of Cali? How do you even speak with feeling stupid with what liberalism is bringing upon this country?
@DjalloDjiwo @GovBillWeld @realDonaldTrump Violence? Your a moron
@GovBillWeld @realDonaldTrump Well mr politician. Until you elected leaders get your heads out of your asses and realize you work for us, and learn to spend within your means nothing will change. And you are one to talk Governor- Massachusetts isnt in best shape fiscally. You are like 47th in that category
@CharredMC @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Are you seeiously that brainwashed that you believe the president of the US is under putin’s thumb? Smdh why dont you do some real research instead of believing everything you hear from MSM. Seriously quit beimg so gullible
@johntalavera47 @RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!! People cant seem to understand that basically every major media—print, cable, or internet—-is owned by 6 big conglomerates. And they have an agenda. You never get the true story from any of them anymore. Its bias from the start.
@RattusBaroness @Jordanfabian Did i say it was wrong? No i didnt. I was alluding to the media’s and the left’s hypocrisy.
@chrisG987 @TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian The ocean is of course by far the largest carbon sink we have. If we lose that we are going to extinct. Rain forest destruction has globally halted. Thats not want its a have to. They are the purifiers of the planet. Outside phytoplankton, they produce most of our oxygen.
@chrisG987 @TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian It does matter what we think. People have to change. Change starts with one person. We have to quit tearing the jungles down and destroying the ocean. Jungles absorb 8.8 billions tons of co2 annually. Our oceans are not absorbing co2 like it was. We are killing the phytoplankton
@mrthunderst1ck @hunkerdad @Jordanfabian Not sure what polls you read. Seems as if the majority wants a wall. Maybe the majority of people in liberal cities do not, but they do not represent the thoughts of most Americans
@TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian Imagine if that 1.6 trillion were to be used to defeat droughts, to defeat hunger, to defeat HIV, to defeat cancer?? Those are the real wars that need fought, not petty religious or greed driven conflicts.
@TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian If we never throw the yoke of money off but can get past the need to fight over religion, resources, race etc..humans could save about 1.6 trillion each year.. The US alone soends a third of that 1.6 trillion on military. https://t.co/waKm9duh9c
@TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian The african countries that are inundated by hunger and famine could all be reversed if people would get over their religious/bias’s and get past the greed that drives them. BUT until we throw the yoke of money, the true enslaver of people, we will never reach our potentials.
@TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian We humans waste waste waste. Every day you see these big businesses amd home owner wastimg waters by the millions of gallons just to feed some grass for asthetic reasons. We millions if not billions of@pounds of food wasted every day by restaurants and individuals. Thats terrible
@TheLoveBel0w @AOC @guardian Do not get me wrong i know and understand we are destroying this planet but but Eight million people die each year from poverty related issues already. That is 22,000 people a day. But conflicts, poor education, lack of coherent government, lack of jobs, are main factors.
@AOC @guardian The media and the left say trump is using fear mongering to promote his agenda. Seems like you are doing the same thing you accuse him of.
@stev702 @lancecampbell16 @PassionSurfer @zumabeach78 @PalumboKat @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I have had about enough hearing the white privilege bullshit I am white and i do NOT remeber any privilege given to me at any point in my life I have cleaned stalls, cut grass, picked crops, roofed, steel work and computer/network, during no time did my skin color help or detracr
@mrthunderst1ck @hunkerdad @Jordanfabian The media NEVER used the words national emergency with Obama
@antf0lks @Jordanfabian See that dude at top. He sent that and then blocked me. This is what the media has caused!! Complete lack of discourse.    I dont mind talking and im not always right. But i do know the dofference btween right and wrong. https://t.co/jNV6zmQBql
@antf0lks @Jordanfabian Media never once called those 13 times out to the american people. Cant you see the double standard? Cant you see how they try to manipulate you and I to favor something but not favor something else??
@antf0lks @Jordanfabian Dude what is the difference in what obama’s national emergencies where for and trumps? Obama called narional emergency 13 times Most of them where to take unilateral samctions against countries to freeze assetts of individuals of said countries..how in hell is that not frivolous?
@antf0lks @Jordanfabian And im just saying the media never once aaid the words national emergency when obama did it.
@JustinAllen127 @Jordanfabian Im not tribalistic, boths sides are crooks. But i am tired of media having an agenda and NOT being honest.
@antf0lks @Jordanfabian Nooooooo dont even. 99.9 percent of obamas natioanl ergency declarations were for other countries issues- so better try again
@wroberts316 @Jordanfabian For makor legislation their should be a vote of the people every time. Thats a true check and balance and a true way for the people to keep control of spending, immigration, etc.
@wroberts316 @Jordanfabian It doesnt matter which side is in control. All they do now is fight and try to make the other side@look as bad as possible sometimes with outright lies. They are all corrupt power hungry megalomaniacs. Its the whole premise they know whats best for the the people.
@wroberts316 @Jordanfabian I know what has and hasnt been accomplished But you and i are definitely in agree on government, It doesnt work anymore. We need it rebuilt from ground up with no lobbyists,  no corporation input, Term limits on every elected position and restraints on whom can hold position.
@Chris_R_Pierce @EnoughImpeach45 @Jordanfabian @GOP Yes!!! Obama declared 13 national emergencies just so could freeze money, bring sanctions etc ..did the media or the left cry foul then?

@copperally @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins I guess im straying, i just feel that as long as .5% of the worlds population controls the world nothing will get better. Money as ive said enslaves us, we only seem to gravitate towards making as much as we can i stead of bettering ourselves and fellow man. Just my two cents
@copperally @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins We are enslaved to the dollar, people want everything they see sonthey put more emphasis on looking good than family quality. TV, computers and phones  have become babysitters and how children learn about the world and how to act. Parents more concerned with hollywood than homw
@copperally @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins the determining factor in most of our issues is the declind and destruction of the family unit. That is the key to a majority of problems we face. Since the 50’s, especially the 60’s we have had a decline in families stayimg together, why? Im not certain, but it is the root cause
@copperally @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins we treat animals far worse, ever seen a feed lot? I can understand the quLity of life issue, i really can..but not the state of the mother..the child can be adopted..that is the issue i have
@copperally @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins So just kill it? Is that your answer?
@outguy @mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins When you realize the distriuction of the family unotnis responsible for the killing we see today we can talk. Until then you stay on ur path and walk off the cliff that everyone else seems to do. The family unit is the key. When that issue has been corrected then it will stop
@mistressmatisse @SenatorCollins You have no rights tonyour body when you have another life inside it.  that life didmt ask to@be made. So therefore its your duty and moral@obligation to make sure its lives. If people can be found guilty of murder for telling someone to kill themselves, then you ahould be too.

@MeaghanML @Braynnoise_com @SpeakerPelosi @AOC Was being intelligent. They pander to the people to stay in power. Tgey say what makes you feel good then do whatever. Government is broken and needs rebuilding from top to bottom. Until that happens we will be slaves to the .5% people that truly run things. Thats straight fact
@MeaghanML @Braynnoise_com @SpeakerPelosi @AOC Liberalism isnt the answer. Socialism damn sure ismt either.
@MeaghanML @Braynnoise_com @SpeakerPelosi @AOC Not all american people, just a few states..you need to get your head out of your ass. If you believe a 1/4 of the shit that comes from these politicians. Seeiously are you so dense that you beleieve they give two cents about what americans want? Smh

@JustBrittany76 @GeoffJohnston16 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump If we do we will look like india, some ither place that has toooo many people. Resources only go so far. People live a little longer than they use to. We as a nation need to keep in mind that if somwone wants to here then they need to assimilate. You do NOT see that now
@JustBrittany76 @GeoffJohnston16 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Also the border needs truly securing in thatose years as well. Then when the doors reopen we can manange immigration in a coherent fashion and keep track of whom is here and where they are. We have 350million american  citizens here now in US.  we cant accept everyone
@JustBrittany76 @GeoffJohnston16 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Immigration has to stop for at least 3-5years.  The people on overstayed visas need to be found in that time period and sent back.  Anyone else here illegally in that time period needs to be foumd and sent back. A true immigration system needs to be put in place in that period
@JustBrittany76 @GeoffJohnston16 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Your so gullible. Name One thimg in the sotunthat was false

@DieselMeth0d @katcald @RashidaTlaib @mimuslimcouncil Sister pie middle of next week
@DieselMeth0d @katcald @RashidaTlaib @mimuslimcouncil Brother im in detroit 4-5times a year. Between there and kalamazoo. Detroit is a shit hole. You should be more worried about your city than some furloughed workers. Its needs much more help. Will be at Sister Pie on Kereval bout the middle of week
@jpmomof5 @therealmrjones3 @RashidaTlaib @mimuslimcouncil People lose jobs everyday. People are homeless everyday.	Where is the organized help then? Where are the senators and representatives crying then? Where are the restaurants offering meals then? Yea this is just showmanships from both sides. yall fall for it hook,line, and sinker
@DieselMeth0d @katcald @RashidaTlaib @mimuslimcouncil Anyone can pretty much say whatever they want. They are right, it is bad these workers have lost a check, but people get laid every day. Are homeless every day. Where is the organized help for them? Where are the restaurants offering meals? Come tell me to stfu, To my face
@MSROSALYN @jamespn72 @OMAPROUD @GDolinko @CNN It is because you have no explanation. You believe in a false narrative. You are blinded by a visceral hate that has no basis other than lies and half truths portrayed by the MSM and social media

@MSROSALYN @OMAPROUD @jamespn72 @GDolinko @CNN LOL your so gullible to believe that nonsense
@OMAPROUD @jamespn72 @GDolinko @CNN Pelosi is an out of touch representative just like the rest. She has no@clue what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck.  And explain why shelives behind a wall? Why she costs taxpayers millions flying back and forth to@california?
@keithboykin @OMAPROUD Trump didnt lecture anyone in getting a loan. Quit lying
@OMAPROUD @seg_organa @CNN And democrats refused a two year plan put forth by pubs in november splitting the 5billion into 2.5 billion in 2019 and 2.5 billion in 2020.  It is all showmanship so that one party can@look better. It has nothing to do with whats best for the people. Are yiu truly so dense??
@OMAPROUD @seg_organa @CNN Its not about what it will buy its about each side blaming the other. It is .175 percent of the whole damn budget- that .175 percent is being used to hold up opening the government. Period. Neither side cares- when you can admit that we can move forward.
@electyoungdems @RashaMK @RashidaTlaib she was the one being disrespectful. She is the one calling people bigots. 	These people were NOT bothering anyone. YET you claim she was harrassed? why do you lie? why spread false narratives?  Hope all of you watch the video link so you can see the tweet headline is misleading

@whats_inaname_ @TTMAB_8s @NwynTom @Vertildr @JSmallz92 @LowlightImages @Jamie1074 @AOC @RANDCorporation truth is Almost all mass shootings occur in gun free zones. Unless you count the the mightly killings of the inner cities. And yes some of those go in the mass killings category.  no gun zones do not work. What works is parents raising good empathetic children—key word PARENTS.
@whats_inaname_ @TTMAB_8s @NwynTom @Vertildr @JSmallz92 @LowlightImages @Jamie1074 @AOC @RANDCorporation Well guess what, since you seem to think so much of this website. Here you concerning your second link of thinkprogress, which according to YOUR website here, is not a reputable source. Try again sir. 	https://t.co/bakkJoNjyw
@ht0wn11 @CNN sir do you think the previous administration, or the one before that, or the one before that was any less decietful? It is time to call a spade a spade sir. They have all failed us, they do not govern, neither side. They get all the perks, enrich themselves while we just get poor
@seg_organa @CNN Well the Democrats surely think that .175% of the whole budget is worth NOT giving. So in effect, the wall is more important not to fund than to fund paying the people out of work. You spin it any way you want, but .175%? is exactly what 5 billion dollars of 4 trillion dollars is
When will the people actually hold our government accountable? Why do we seem so tribal when it comes to Government? We fight over politicians that truly do not work, is SO out of touch with common people, and only enrich themselves. #GovernmentShutdown #realdemocracy
@SpeakerPelosi If any like the above post, then please retweet. I want broad coverage for the poll. Thank you,		C
@QueVivaLibertad I have issue with the Racial moniker they used. White Radical??? seriously? It makes white people seem as though we are terrorists. Kind of like lumping all muslims into the they are terrorists grouping.
@SpeakerPelosi NO Representative Pelosi,	what America needs are the people we elect to actually work, to actually govern. We need them to quit trying to make the other side look as bad as possible while seemingly making their party look like a bed of roses when in reality both sides are guilty

@r0ck3rgirl81 @Vikcloud @wolfsettler @DavidDTSS Never said he deserved to die. Thugs are white and black you again are grouping. The bottom line is quit blaming the people that do@not need blaming and put the blame squarely wherenit belongs- his upbringing
@r0ck3rgirl81 @Vikcloud @wolfsettler @DavidDTSS I never once mentioned color, you did. I looked at from a truth stand point you looked at from a race stand point and that is the problem today. Everyone is grouping people. Its becoming tribal to a large extent. That is an issue that needs taken care of. And media is big culprit
@KrysyndaDay @TrumpinTheShark @jbrooks33 @MsMoxyNYC @McCormickProf @amconmag I saw no physical violence. I saw a kid take his shirt off and act silly. But i saw absolutely no violence. Any way are you@going to condemn that black group as racist or not? Black supremacists or not?
@johnpavlovitz @NicRossier You mean your hatred Mr. Pavlovitz. You and those like you stoke these narratives to sell your books and get you few mins of self importance. Iyour narratives are filled with massive exaggerations, oversimplifications and in a few cases outright untruths.
@dliang22 @johnpavlovitz What did your heart feel when you heard the racist rants of the black hebrews against the native americans and kids? Or did you not find that offensive.
@KrysyndaDay @TrumpinTheShark @jbrooks33 @MsMoxyNYC @McCormickProf @amconmag Yes that happened. But after being insulted and screamed at and threatened. Do you condemn the black hebrews  as racist? Mocking? Lets hear it..say they are racist. You heard what they said
@r0ck3rgirl81 @Vikcloud @wolfsettler @DavidDTSS Because he idolized thugs and killers. Blame his violent father with history to abusing women. Blame his drug trafficing and violent mother, but do NOT blame police for this. Just because you refuse to see and speak truth doesnt mean all of us do. You are a coward.
@DavidDTSS Brown had been charged with Burglary, Armed criminal action, Assault with the intent to do great bodily harm, and again Armed criminal action. He was scheduled to go to court in Sept. 2014. how is he comparable to Catholic kid? How in the hell is even remotely close to compare?
@r0ck3rgirl81 @DavidDTSS What point? Brown had been charged with Burglary, Armed criminal action, Assault with the intent to do great bodily harm, and again Armed criminal action. He was scheduled to go to court in Sept. 2014. how is he comparable to Catholic kid? How in the hell is even remotely close
@johnpavlovitz What about poor behavior and rCist rants and threats by the black hebrews? Why is media silent on that? I will tell you why, because anyone that reports the truth and it makes a black group look bad they are called racist and their sponsors flee. Shame truth isn’t important
@sam2fabu @keithboykin Then how about moving over to some west African country, or say pakistan, or Imdia where you can fee real injustice. Your hatred for Caucasians and their past clouds your mind. Show some damn sense.
@sam2fabu @keithboykin You know damn well sports teams do these  every weekend. Sometimes its black body paint sometimes its green red yellow. Quit causing issues. Just because your black doesnt mean you are right. Quit causing racial strife over non existent issues. You think its nad here?
@brodouche @ChaseHFisher35 @TheSpurling @Reuters Because he has no mental issues. He doesnt live in a fantasy land where he is a woman. If you are on a battlefield yiu really do not want delusional people next to you.

@kmishida2 @AnnCoulter Those were 2011 games and it was a blackout game. Yes kids had full body black paint on. It happened every weekend in sports.

@brandenberger @AnnCoulter Show me
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes Yes military. Entertainment industry huh...that explains alot. Since it was the entertainment industry that promoted black face in first place..that and minstrels
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes And for you to Not be offended with what the hebrew Israelites said and did must make you a racist, correct?? And you obviously werent because you will not admit to it one way or the other. RACIST you are
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes Not offended by this. Its a black out game. It happens almost every weekend at some sxhool somewhere...sometimes it is red or green or yellow..its not racist. You are just easily offended.

@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes Show me proof they encourage black face and i will condemn the school morning noon and night
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes We obviously watched two different videos because thats isnt remotely what happened. And phillips has a history of this. And phillips’ story keeps changing. Have a good evening.
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes And if you watched the whole video you had to hear the Israelites mocking the natives americans. It was in first minute of two hour video. Condemning their beliefs, how in the world is that more unjust than anything those kids done? But no one will call them out on it.
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes The black muslim tweet? Yes i saw that one, but it wasnt racist she thought they were black muslims harrassing her kid. But you still will not condemn the israelites will you? Did you not hear them? The only behavior i saw the boys do thst was in question was tomahawk chop.
@LauraPaige2 @KellanMartz @mommy97giraffe @macduckworth He is 13 and in 8th grade now. He has hardly any issue with bullies anymore. He loves getting up and heading to school. Im sorry but sometimes you have to stand up and fight for yourself if you want to have peace and happiness. Just my two cents. Aspergers can be a nightmare
@LauraPaige2 @KellanMartz @mommy97giraffe @macduckworth Guess what? My 13 yr old also has aspergers. Kind hearted to point of upset if you kill a bug. When he was 9 he came home said daddy i wanna die, i dont wanna be me  anymore. At that point i taught him how to strike to the face as hard as possible to any bullies.
@LisaPulitzer @macduckworth Bravo? Sounds like a rehearsed story to get some attention to me. You are quick to believe this individual and others with stories like this but yet SO quick to condemn any kid that shows an ou@ce of conservatism. How do you know he isnt lying? Where is his proof?
@RedVinesRedWine @Bcorn62 @4everNeverTrump @jaketapper @reason @robbysoave Are you being serious or are you just stupid? Doctored video caused all these retractions and apologies by journalists? You want it to be true Bout these kids. i hear anyone calling out the hebrew israelites?They spouted the true racist hate speech there. You all Scared to do it?
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes Of course you would. You are like rest of liberals, you call a spade a spade in fear of being labeled a racist. That fear stifles communication and advancement for every one. Did you see the video? If so, do you not think the things they were saying were abhorrent?
@StormyDaniels @Ponygal923 @MichaelAvenatti Was he sleeping with you when he asked? Or did he just tell you to tweet that as u sucked him@off? Or did he drag you down out the door like he did his gf??
@CuriousGreg @darnelldepalma1 @giacomonyt @nytimes Its 13 1/2 mins not good half hr. And NOT once did those racist israelites say get@out of my space. I did hear one say he was foing to bust his ass if he got close. Threatening a minor, real adult like and your defending them
@darnelldepalma1 @waltshaub @SangHeffa @giacomonyt @nytimes Marlon james only explains his double standards by that post. Did he or anyone else call out the true uncouth racists in all those videos? none condemn the words and actions of the black Israelites that we see spewing hatred left and right at both the native americans and kids
@SusanHulett He was smilinh thats not a smirk. You are going to be part of a slander lawsuit
@SusanHulett @Rob66582200 @McCormickProf @jaketapper @amconmag Didnyou know that phillips said same thing about a group of frat boys as well Do you not think that maybe those ADULT black Israelitesmay have already had those kids intimidated to point of not sure what to do? Blame the kids yep thats intelligent. But dont memtion racist blacks
@MsMoxyNYC @McCormickProf @amconmag Are you condemning the black Israelites for being completely racist, obnoxious, and threatening people? Come lil Annie lets hear you condemn them..you heard the things they were saying. Yea didnt think so. You are a joke
@TrumpinTheShark @jbrooks33 @MsMoxyNYC @McCormickProf @amconmag Maybe they were intimidated by the black Israelites slinging racial epithets at them before phillips walks into them Maybe it was the black Israelites mocking the native Americans and everyone else BEFORE  phillips walks into them? Blame everyone but the truly uncouth in that vid
@TootsL1n @milkchaser @kemettler @washingtonpost Sooooo blame the kids, not the adults. You have real intelligence
@ParrettJim @FrankHumphreys @kemettler @washingtonpost The only ones being racist and obnoxious were the black israelites. Too scared to condemn them? Afraid you will be called racist and slandered?? Your a coward that believes any narrative that demonizes white males
@DataDivaFL @trilingual1946 @kemettler @washingtonpost And now you feel like an idiot dont you? Since they have been exonerated.
@cptrsnahs08 @PikePlaceTechie I wish you were my neighbor. So I could come have a chat with you. Your hatred for trump has completely eaten your brain. It was the black Israelites that were slingin racial epithets every at everyone. Yet you those kid(s) trash and racists? It wasnt even his brother. Wrong kid

@AOC  Call out both sides for thier idiocy. Going to@puerto rico in midst of shutdown with lobbyists is just plain idiotic. Call them out. Call out @senatemajldr for going home. Just miss cortez do not be for party over your people, us, we are now your people. Be a real change!

@YourBadTake @ronlawton52 @talkcric @AnnCoulter And as for as trade deficit. .. The flow of dollars out of the country leads to a weakness for the currency As the dollar weakens, it makes imports more expensive and exports cheaper leading to some moderation of the trade balance. Dollar is stronger now.	https://t.co/eRdsIlyr0I
@YourBadTake @ronlawton52 @talkcric @AnnCoulter How do@you figure none of it is based on fact? Farm sunsidzing started in 1922 with the grain futures act..then ramped up during the great depression and the dust bowl.  In 2009 obama’s budget deficit was 1.55 trillion dollars and was over a trillion dollars for next three years.
@ronlawton52 @talkcric @AnnCoulter Subsidizing farmering has been going on for decades. not trump’s doing.  If you knew econmics you know reason the trade deficit is higher now is because the dollar is much stronger. nothing close to previous admins 1,6 trillion deficit. 4 years in a row of a trillion plus deficit
@EAChrisMiller @nprpolitics @NPR Your refering to the 21st century media model of not being accurate, using he said she said facts and basically just covering one side of a story?

@BrownBergan @SykesCharlie Michael Avenatti??
@clubbing_guy @babyface_shane @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump Are you SO naive to think they all dont put their interests ahead of the country? Look at how many trade stock during their terms..how many get business deals for their family or close froends dieing their terms. The whole lot of them are corrupt. Its not just trump
@Clair04870050 @EdKrassen Of course you cant. Because 95% of all people in either party only see the sins of the other party. Why can none of you see both parties are corrupt power hungry megalomaniacs that do not care about the welfare of the country. They care about pandering to us  to get a vote.
@Clair04870050 @EdKrassen And the democrat felonies???
@jenrice09 @SerenityFoods @Ocasio2018 @nynurses Same thing trump does daily but is criticized for
@TheOlBucsCoach @OldTakesExposed Will take that bet
@Ilive4saturdays Thinks this is a little more accurate https://t.co/asoIFSoQ5E
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football well we did you no favors...
@49d28432aed34e4 @Jerry4day @UGAAthletics Well obviously your an idiot...so go back to ur moms basement and quit making a fool of urself.
@prashm07 @RadiNabulsi In the last two games Georgia was in the lead or was tied  with bama for 119 of the 120 minutes...let that sink in..last 30 secs of both games ...sigh...
@49d28432aed34e4 @Jerry4day @UGAAthletics Proves a hell of a lot more than losing to a 4 loss team. And that 4 loss team beat OU...
@WUWF_Dave @UGAAthletics @KirbySmartUGA If your a Ga fan i know we are disappointed. BUT how ling has it been since we were truly relevant? Over multiple years?? So stfu. We are on the the right track. Mistakes and bad play calls. happen. but it doesnt hPpen nearly as often now.
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football If not for the gift we gave bama ud be playing us again.
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football And if we hadnt of ran a fake pumt yesterday we might of beat bama
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football We also put up over 500 hundred on you. And as i say i have the tape. How many sacks did we have? Oh yea 5 https://t.co/puoIIwt0E3
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football If you wanna argue we didnt i have the game taped. I can show you..how many times did we sack baker??
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football You do play well but we shoved your O Line all over the field last december..
@tscharff88 @larryjamad @sean_rielley @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football OSU SOS wasnt better than hardly any trying to get in.  So stop with the non sense.  There is the 2018 SP and SOS rankings at all games https://t.co/INYrIYmjXG
@jenhendershott @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football UGA would maul OSU’s O and D lines. OSU would be treated like this.                                                                     https://t.co/EjOLYemzEz
@ToddMcKinsey @Deb66117901 @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football Yea said you wanted UGA last year if i remember correctly. Bama will maul your O and D line
@rdbiglove23 @tscharff88 @sean_rielley @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football And no conference game. Thats not fair
@tscharff88 @sean_rielley @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football OSU will be manhandled by Bama..just like they would be by UGA. Sooners got a taste last year...OSU isnt top 4 team period..damn cfp needs to be 8 teams..
@Noble_K_Thomas @cbfowler @KirkHerbstreit @AlabamaFTBL @ClemsonFB @NDFootball @OU_Football Two ges we lost ro Bama, both by a touchdown..so bama hasnt brought their A game either time huh? UGA manhandled Alabama saturday...but couldnt close it. OSU isnt on par with UGA or bama..ND certsainly isnt..and since conference titles matter wtf is ND in the cfp?
@brendon_polm @mspears96 Thinks osu lineman would get alot of this.                                                  https://t.co/UYEQFommgM
@brendon_polm @mspears96 Uga was beaten badly by a then top ten team..now top 11...osu was rocked by purdue...big difference
@D5rAy2 @mspears96 https://t.co/UYEQFommgM
@JohnFis87569576 @MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC I can agree to that as well. Its has been broken for a long while. But we allowed it@to become broken. We for the most part have allowed a namny state to arise. We have allowed lobbyists/corporations to control the people we elect and its HAS to@stop
@MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC Thats all that gets done i. Washington DC now. They use their position to enrich themselves and say anything to get yours and my vote. Its a broken system on every level. And until we take to the streets en mass (50 million at very least) nothing will ever change.
@MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC 30-40 years ago the senators and represenatives actually worked and wrote their bills/laws themselves Now they have people do it and just add theor names to it They have NO clue what is really in it to be honest  one side attack the other trying to make it look as bad as possible
@MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC That is very true sir. And until we stop fighting over people whom only care anout party line we will stay divided and accomplish nothing. I am a conservative on many issues but there is wiggle room in my mind. It seems party line allows NO wiggle room. Neither side governs
@MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC The truth is an attack? If she is voted as house leader again those “attacks” would be true, correct? and maybe just maybe you should pay attention to the attacks on GOP members painting them all racist, white supremacists, crooks, etc. It works both ways sir.
@MarshallDTucker @JanetOhanis @Ocasio2018 @LindseyGrahamSC Its because of the media that she is such a big topic. She needs to retire. Along with 99% percent of the rest
@jacobsoboroff @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen They were in cages during Obama term... didnt hear you crying then
@boldknight1 @DogginTrump @davidpsdem Lmao and cnn msnbc are any better. You poor indoctrinated fools
@TenaciousTwitt @AllanJGuty @hollerella @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl Sigh obviously you havent read her ststement that he drug her out the door into a public hallway in only her tshirt and panties die to a fight about money. But thats ok with you huh?
@hollerella @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti @DavidWohl @JacobAWohl Yiu obviously didnt see the ladies ststement that he drug her out the door..is that ok with you?
@TheDaniel_Ray @EdKrassen How so?
@andersondavid92 @DeeDeeSchwartz3 @MichaelAvenatti @GOP She blocked me for the truth. sigh never fails the left only tolerates there view
@DavidWelker2018 @avenatticarlin @MichaelAvenatti Same as trying to frame kavanaugh? Same as bringing bogus victims? Same as lying repeatedly? Same as not paying taxes?? And you still believe in this moron?
@DeeDeeSchwartz3 @MichaelAvenatti @GOP Hmmm seems its a Dem tactic..remember Kavanaugh moron??
@MelissaPeckinp1 @sjwflying @MichaelAvenatti @LAPDHQ Lol ok..you will see Avenatti for what he truly is ..at some point i hope
@MelissaPeckinp1 @sjwflying @MichaelAvenatti @LAPDHQ Point is as long as its a democrat he get benefit of doubt, unlike kavanaugh. Its been proven Avenatti is a liar yet you continue to support his bullshit.
@ibjukin @ForeverBeloved1 @MotherJones @mydoggyruss Its a privilege, right, and DUTY to vote..you should have proper identification to vote. Its not voter suppression to want to know who you are
@ibjukin @ForeverBeloved1 @MotherJones @mydoggyruss Its not about voter suppression..its about knowing where you are and exactly who you are..most hadnt voted in ANY type election in many years..they can still vote as long as they re-sign up to vote..and EVERY citizen should have voter identification.
@Borowczyk76 @the_triumphs @TidalWave2018 @joshmerbitz @realtonydias @szientarski @AnnCoulter Well its funny i find no other source but this was days ago i hear no calls for a retractment
@the_triumphs @jjmullen42 @TidalWave2018 @joshmerbitz @realtonydias @szientarski @AnnCoulter Finally open ur eyes and realize neither side truly gives a damn about you and I. Both sides are corrupt and only care about making the other side look bad. No governing or true work gets down. All effort and rrsources used to enrich themselves and their masters.
@the_triumphs @jjmullen42 @TidalWave2018 @joshmerbitz @realtonydias @szientarski @AnnCoulter Your logic isnt above bery many horizons my friend. But your ability to seenthe big picture of whatnis happening must be very limited

@joshmerbitz @realtonydias @szientarski @AnnCoulter Matters when a non citizen voted..and the lawyer for Democratic Nelson said it shoud count
@luv24smilee @Ocasio2018 Seems none of you appreciates trumps transparency. We know more about what is going in in our government today than we ever have due to his transparency. Seriously we know exactly whats happening multiple times a day..
@Dbbcfc @MKEthelife4me @SethAbramson And rome falls. Is that what you want? America as a modern day rome?
@SethAbramson Many state have use it or lose policies. Only 107,000 were purged in july. And the supreme court upheld that policy with a 5-4 decision saying it was legal to do so this past June.
@SueRic2 @brycetache Your misinformed
@VoodooBunny1 @KizzyUSA @kaytwo5280 @technochicgeek @brycetache Lmao again at you misinformed fools. They are ALL corporate hacks. They all tale money from them. They all lie. Your just choosing a different poison to die from moron
@VoodooBunny1 @technochicgeek @brycetache LMFAO you misguided fool. You think democrat candidates are better? OMG you people people want change but yet you vote for party politics. Show up@in the fucking streets if you want change! No party will ever change. They both lie to us . The pander to us thats it!!

@26RJeremy @MichaelAvenatti @Bethnonobadkitt @realDonaldTrump Mr. Reid ive been awake for almost a decade. Its both sides that put family, friends, and other countries ahead of the American people. And until all are gone and we start over we will be the Rome of the modern world..as in the Fall of Rome all over again
@26RJeremy @MichaelAvenatti @Bethnonobadkitt @realDonaldTrump Sigh ... no sense in me trying because you are to set upon hatred of a guy that wants america put first.
@26RJeremy @MichaelAvenatti @Bethnonobadkitt @realDonaldTrump Seems he get more done in less timw than last president or the one before him. If he was getting nothing done, democrats would not be so upset
@weswwmvip @electra_highway @chrisvt @DrErinkate @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump You are a brain washed moron.
@Samanth90229396 @Balmoralmorning @jpaceDC @TheViewFromLL2 Funny you say dont lump them all together. I wont lump them all together when the so called moderate muslims start turning the extremists in. Until such a time they are just as guilty as the extremists. When they stand up to the radical imams and stop them i will lump them as one
@Samanth90229396 @Balmoralmorning @jpaceDC @TheViewFromLL2 Then you are a damn fool
@Samanth90229396 @Balmoralmorning @jpaceDC @TheViewFromLL2 And stop blaming the president. Why dont you put the blame where it belongs. Islam, Islamic government
@Samanth90229396 @Balmoralmorning @jpaceDC @TheViewFromLL2 And you all think its ok to let more of those animals inside the US
@FinishLineScrip @EdKrassen So your gonna vote for a drunk and a burglar?

@ginsengity @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins @KamalaHarris OMG of course kamala harris saw it diffferently. Geez you are a simpleton
@lisamayo19 @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins And you think the left doesnt? Where is you fake ass outrage over that?
@mlwalz @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins You are seriously delusional. You think the ones in left are any better? If they were Feinstein wouldve come foreward the moment she had the letter and NONE of this wouldve happened!! Learn to see beyond your blind anger
@ggtoall @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins Them feinstein and her husband need investigating. So does Keith Ellison..so why arent yiu calling for that as well?
@angeni @MichaelO1711 @MichaelAvenatti @SenatorCollins Then what was it?  Lets hear it then, come on spit it out young lady..
@kalpenn Tacos RULE
@wwredpepper @MichaelAvenatti How do you know beyond a reasonable doubt that she is a victim?
@JulesNYNY @ipublicobserver @Parisisbest1 @Hazel_River12 @LEBassett @SarahKSilverman You will continue to be owned by the 1% that truly run the world. Sad as hell that fighting over skin pigmentation, religion, and money is more important than truly running your country, not theirs ..YOURS!
@JulesNYNY @ipublicobserver @Parisisbest1 @Hazel_River12 @LEBassett @SarahKSilverman You will never get it by voting..unless maybe it was a law..mandatory you had to vote.  You will have to shut down some things to be heard, to be seen, to let them know enough is enough! But until you all get thru fighting over these worrhless bumbs that are basicall HAND PICKED!
@JulesNYNY @ipublicobserver @Parisisbest1 @Hazel_River12 @LEBassett @SarahKSilverman Sigh...i usually play devils advocate just to stimulate conversation.. But the honest truth is, you people make me sick. You all squabble over individuals that absolutely give zero fucks about you or I. And until you march in 50-100 million range you will accomplish nothing.
@LodeStorm @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Call it what you will. But why would you trust a crook?
@CoryTaylor420 @SzalmaLiz @MichaelAvenatti Occassionally.  Spreading hate? And lies? Seriously? How many times has fox had to retract something they reported?
@CoryTaylor420 @SzalmaLiz @MichaelAvenatti Never said you did. But the media has a complete double standard thier hate of the right.
@matthewafrank @SethAbramson Seth is a moron an atrention seeking prat just like Avenatti. Yall’s hate for trump, and the absolute denial of anyone else to have a different view is disgusting. You believe anything if it fits your narratives regardless of proof.
@CoryTaylor420 @SzalmaLiz @MichaelAvenatti Oh so thats it then huh? Nothing to see there right? What about the one from 2005?  smh. You can smear one person because he is a conservative but not the other due to him being a liberal correct?  Double standard

@CoryTaylor420 @big_blue56 @MichaelAvenatti It is half the country at least young lady. Alot and i mean alot of@people wont admit to liking his policies due to the lefts extreme name calling and insulting. Tge media has done a good job indoctrinating you on the left
@frederickhiller @CoryTaylor420 @MichaelAvenatti Omg you people are so clueless.  There was no collusion. Geez
@SzalmaLiz @CoryTaylor420 @MichaelAvenatti You think democrats are any better?? Seriously?? Are you that damn stupid? If they were so much better, so much more moral..why didnt feinstein come forward as soon as she heard? Why ismt Ellison being drug thru the mud? A vote for the left is no better than a vote for the right

@Tawny2222 @diva_rebel @tamyf8 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So true. Liberal policies of paying people l, especially the one of paying women as long as no man was in the house has created a society that thinks the government is there to provide everything! Its not, but after decades of being cottled, the cycle is hard to break.
@diva_rebel @tamyf8 @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You want solidarity? Quit playing a victim. You have the exact same rights as anyome. You want to blame someone blame the LbJ regime for all poor people’s issues. When they started handing out government checks everything went to hell
@drosesmith2 @LiraKarri @MichaelAvenatti You have a double standard when it comes to truth! You suport a conman and condemn another. That is complete idiocy. And i have plenty more information compiled against your hero.                                                     https://t.co/stuXbA6QYQ
@Liberty28418078 @guypbenson @seanmdav The sad thing is...the republicans would do same thing if circumstances were reversed. Neither side works any more.

@caliwildflowers @ladyhawkerfinds @Bornabrit1 Corroborated huh...show me that proof
@Unionjeb67 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti You think its just one side? Such a delusional sheep you are
@tigiffany @eagdvm @skantrow How do you know for sure they are victims? Innocent until proven guilty or has that changed? Or is it only for conservatives that they are gulity till proven innocent? Double standard since ellison isnt being investigated yet. You believe his accuser as well?
RT @pjm7245: Let's make this go virile for ole Uncle Joe.  Sticking his foot in it again.	https://t.co/HuAYYYuSnA
@Hale03Hale @EWErickson @riotwomennn Maybe you all should check out keith ellisons accuser as much as kavenaugh’s.  Double standard maybe?	https://t.co/973dpmGmjC
@IgneousViewcam @jimnathan @DLoesch @MichaelAvenatti He is doing just fine at not oaying taxes, not oaying his business partners, not paying land lords and lying ..so yea he is a real stand up guy. Why are yall so quit about accusations against Ellison? Oh wait he is a liberal so the woman must be lying!! Double standards..smh
@LennyBruce22 @ladyhawkerfinds @GOVTWINE @Bornabrit1 Again where is your outrage over ellison’s accuser?
@ladyhawkerfinds @Bornabrit1 Seems none of you are concerned about Ellison’s accuser. Double standard much?
@Bornabrit1 @cheezwitham Why arent you concerned about Ellison’s wife/gf?
@oskar_funes @RafaelBNunez @TheDemCoalition @MichaelAvenatti You are pretty much 100% correct it would be easier to move away from that if people realized neither side is better matter if they support your or you support their views they are all in for themselves they do NOT care. Corrupt putrid cess pool that needs disbanded and reformed.
@jacksonorleans1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Who cares? You should..why should an immoral man/woman condemn another person whom is also immoral? Where is the sense in that? Yall keep squabbling over these putrid pieces of garbage that gives exactly zero fucks about you and ignore the bigger problem
@LilithHelborn @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti And how instead of the people, not the top 1%, allow these shysters to rule over us. We squabble over scraps and they own us when we allow it. And bygod we SO allow it!
@LilithHelborn @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti proof court ordered proofs. Im not right or left wing. I’m just the dude sitting back and laughing at how you all squabble over people that do NOT give one single fuck about you or I. The things i post may seem right wing bit its to show you the immorality of both sides.
@thepatriotbelle @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Who me?
@oskar_funes @RafaelBNunez @TheDemCoalition @MichaelAvenatti Bickering competing splintered movements, groups, whatever will not make a change. So yall keep fighting over this media, make myself look important shysters...and you, your children, your grandchildren will still be owned by the 1% . Its time for a real change  we are broken
@oskar_funes @RafaelBNunez @TheDemCoalition @MichaelAvenatti He is doing the same things the party he is accusing is doing. Cant you see the ridiculousness of it?  One side fights for Avey one for righty.. all the time that 1% absolutely owns you..with nothing really changing no matter which side is in.
@oskar_funes @RafaelBNunez @TheDemCoalition @MichaelAvenatti you just do not get it he speaks of morality and harming the american people, yet lies himself, doesnt pay business partners, land lords or taxes for a business he said he didnt own. Its not about him doing a job. He is obviously intelligent.
@Unionjeb67 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Why is he not going going after Ellison? why is no one going after Ellison?
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Funny how the employees only saw his name on the checks. And funny how you claim defamation media reporting when they do it wvery day to djt, kavenaugh and others with way fewer facts
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti You cant divulge your the chairman of comapny and not know whats foing on. You cant divert 100,000 from a company for lawyers and not know whats going on. Sorry but is not better than the liars we have in the government. Both sides are liars. Greedy power hungery liars
@Lodesta35587655 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Find me one iota of evidence there is one. I cant find it.
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti What about his untruths? How can one liar condemn another liar?
@LilithHelborn @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti https://t.co/619owVdqLJ
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Allegations? Its court orederd fact he is a tax evader, didnt pay business partners, didnt pay land lords..its on court record you idiot.
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Again you are a sheep. And a war is coming.. i hope your ready
@LilithHelborn @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti He is a liar, tax cheat, and has to be court ordered to pay his debts.
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Lmao.  Your a moron. Good bye
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Isnt a conspirator.. i believe Kavanaugh did it. But whom is paying for it alm to come out now, and whom is paying Avey boy?? Come on you have to want to know those answers. If not your a sheep!
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti You cant fight injustice when you yourself are not worthy. How can anything said by him be believed. He is only doing it to be in spotlight period. He is a hack
@Lodesta35587655 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti No no no!!! Dont you dare lie! There is NO investigation at this time and the hawaii senator only said a probe was appropriate!!! Quit lying!!!
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Where is the money coming from? Seriously..Avey boy has to be court ordereed to pay a business partner, he has to be court ordered to pay back taxes that he told the public he didnt owe nor did he have anything to do with the company that owed them. So sir, would you trust him?
@darkknightfore1 @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti https://t.co/619owVdqLJ
@realMaryTuna @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Do you believe ellison’s accuser?
@realMaryTuna @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti https://t.co/619owVdqLJ
@Lodesta35587655 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Yes she did. But where is the media frenzy? Where is the social media frenzy? Its non existent and you know it!!! all the airtime on this is due to fact Kav is a conservative and lack of airtime for ellison is because he is liberal.
@Lodesta35587655 @joelytrumpshate @EdKrassen @MichaelAvenatti Yes they ordered and ordered him to@pay the taxes which he hasnt done by the way.

@MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson Yea you go ahead spew that misinformation. Your a lawyer and ur a practiced liar like all lawyers. Bending the law and interpreting it to suit your needs and views. All of you praising this man are evidently blind. He doesnt care about you or this country.

@Sarah_SKG_1983 @AquarianTiger @MichaelAvenatti Are you so stupid that you believe the democrats are any better? Seriously?? They are all  in it for power and greed. Both sides are worthless. And if you think@this Avenatti is any better you are truly delusional. He is a lawyer which is just anither word for crook.
@WandaSpeaks67 @VonBurglestein @MichaelAvenatti Seriously? It is a bloated mass of greedy power hungry sycophants that do not care about you and I anymore They are controlled by cooperations donors big interest and banks If you cant see that then i feel sorry for your lack sight.Cut it by 60% and make them fiscally responsible
@WandaSpeaks67 @VonBurglestein @MichaelAvenatti Thats the issue ...government should be slashed by 60%.

@dukewindsor388 You poor misguided souls. Stereotyping is wrong.
@dukewindsor388 You hate a group of people you have never met personally? Sounds like narrow mindedness to me.  Because that is the basis of why nothing is ever resolved. Their are merits to each sides arguments, the ability to see that is progress. No one gets everything they want.
@dukewindsor388 @Ccq714Tom @MichaelAvenatti @kimmie8264 He sounds like he has heard family talking. You want to a role model then@point him@toward astronauts, doctors or scientists. World needs more of those and less politicians. We do not need over hyped power hungry out of touch individuals governing the world They are all the same
@JohnQPublicz @Kris_Sacrebleu Every single peice of media you read, hear or see is owned by only SIX mega corps. Those people sit or have family that sits on the central bank boards. Those same people or family sit on the boards of the biggest corporations in the world. 150 people gove or take run this world
@JohnQPublicz @Kris_Sacrebleu Lmao nwo? Lol lol lol boy you really need an education in how tge world is controlled. The in fighting and distractions by both parties is orchestrated by a group that controls 75% of the worlds economy. Central banks finance BOTH sides of a war. They finance both sides of media
@Wolfelink @bryanbehar America does it every day of the year..change the outcome of another countries future..and we have been for decades..

@CVaine @John3_and_16 Yea but i dont think the forefathers invisioned people xoming in droves just to have a baby here. Its being exploited
@versacetie @with_an_eff @the_sidecarist So if by her words im a racist saying it is t right for people to goto another country and demand things, then every person is a racist. How would i be received in france if i showed up demanding things from the french? Or how about i show up in cuba doing that? Or mexico?
@versacetie @with_an_eff @the_sidecarist So with an eff pulled the racist card then blocks me. I find it hilarious to be called a racist due to fact that one is proud of their culture. Proud of the achievements said culture has made And then told people have the right to demand things in a country they do not belong to
@versacetie @with_an_eff @the_sidecarist Sorry but you read mainstream media, as i do as well but i read latin papers, i read the manifestos of reconqista orgs and La Raza. Maybe you should too. You think@it cant happen but its already happening
@taurusangel26 @nytimes They shouldnt have come illegally. And dont give me the asylum bullshit the media is feeding you morons
@katlovesflowers @ProfDeutsch @nytimes Lawsuits from criminals? LOL you truly live in a fantasy
@versacetie @with_an_eff @the_sidecarist They brought them they should pay. Why should we pay? Id rsther my money is sent to homeless veterans instead of invaders

@free2bhuman @EWErickson And cnn abc wasnt for obama? Grow up
@Cribbis @EWErickson Neither is any of the others. 90% of all media is owned by only 6 companies. Those companies have agendas. Those news is reflects those agendas.
@SIXXCROWS What most do t get is we cant hold the children more thsn 20 days due to the flores law enacted in 1997. And also most dont know because liberal media wont report it a very very very high percentage of the kids arent actually coming with the parents but were loaned out by parents
@StevenBritt13 @realDonaldTrump Funny non of the indictments have anything to do with collusion. Poor flynn lied..hillary lied but got away with it. prosecutor ALLOWED two witnesses to sit in on his questioning of her!! Tell me there isnt collusion there to protect the left.
@SIXXCROWS Well i can and it goes back to the meida propaganda machines. Sir i honestly believe the media is working for a common goal to keep the people divided so a new global community can really arise. I dont consider myself a nutjob but i see things on the world stage that suggest this
@SIXXCROWS That is the problem, you and i cant get elected. I see no way a common man could ever be president. BUT you are absolutely right in the fact that same greedy power hungry lip service people keep getting elected over and over. I cant fathom@why pwople cote them in term after term
@SIXXCROWS That may be the case i admit i have an issue with so few running things across the world i feel its a flawed system. Because how can someone whom has never went without or ever had to chjose between paying a bill or eating understand what a person in that situation needs or wants
@SIXXCROWS Nor I sir. I just cant see why people cant see that.
@SIXXCROWS Until we all get our shit together and realize we are headed rowaeds another civil war nothing will change. Most care more about what goes on in hollywood than what happens in their own communities. Its a shame people cant see the government is broken. It needs aboloshing
@SIXXCROWS Its bad behavior all around sir. At this ooint and time we the people are we the sheep herded by media. Almost all media we see, hear, or read is owned by 6 big coorparations. The rest are owned by billionaires whom are way out of touch with general Americans. .
@AynRandPaulRyan @realDonaldTrump Its time the borders are closed until we fix our internal issues- politicians, infrastructure, and education. And allow the immigrants here to settle and  and actually assimilate. Then by that time there should be a nice robust economy and a good immigration plane in place

@GitaravadakaJim @harlowismyalias @TIME Your funny. Like i said just not@lest thy be judged
@GitaravadakaJim @harlowismyalias @TIME Im not arguing with you. There is NO scripture that says what you put in your first post. Those sentences are from mulltiple paragraphs in Mathew as i said before.
@A_Mixolydian @TIME Well why arent people suing mualim cabbies whom refuse to all patrons inside die to having alcohol on them? Or why are people only targeting christian stores? There were more around. A person has freedom of choice. He built that business and no one has the right to force him
@GitaravadakaJim @harlowismyalias @TIME And you are adding different scripture together. Thats NOT a bible scripture unto itself. That is multiple parts of multiple areas within Mathew.
@GitaravadakaJim @harlowismyalias @TIME Maybe so but im not his judge nor is anyone else. Thats between him and the maker. So should he be targeted?
@A_Mixolydian @TIME Should muslim bakers have to make cakes for gay couples as well? Or cook bacon and ham if customer ordered it?
@harlowismyalias @TIME Their were a few around the couple specifically chose this one because of his religious views.
@Michael71858503 @AlexMorash @soledadobrien Why doesnt a gay couple attempt to get a cale from a muslim bakery and see the reaction. I bet it wouldnt be as nice as the this guy was. You cant force people to something that goes against their belief system. No different than you saying screw them. Absolutly none
@Mikejku @AlexMorash Oh they wont be forced to. If so their would be anarchy from them.
@MelissaRoseanne @FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy Its time. They do not work anymore for the people they work for whom has the most money. Its just crazy how the same people say the same things every few years and we elect them over and over. And they know this amd u til we quit bickering over them and unite we f’d
@MelissaRoseanne @FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy You absolutely have the right to voice your concerns. The point im making is there are NO differences between gop and dems. One caters to liberals and one to conservatives but all they do is give lip service to both groups. They are all corrupt and need replaced
@MelissaRoseanne @FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy Yall whine and squabble over these people in charge like they give two cents about you. Its not trump, its not republicans, its not democrats, its the whole institution! They need abolishing. And until you sheep can stop bickering nothing will change
@MelissaRoseanne @FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy Well my family settled in mtns@of north carolina in 1720. And we have went from a nation that held personal freedom and choice in high regard to a nation controlled by big business  big donors and where personal freedom has no meaning anymore. With corrupt government on both side
@MelissaRoseanne @FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy Then move.
@strong151 @SouthernLady328 In the real world words mean every thing evidently. If they didnt why you on twitter? Nothing but a sounding booth for words that start ideas that become movements. You lose jobs over them you become famous from them you live by them and you die by them.
@strong151 @SouthernLady328 I know this...you and i are the same..yiu bleed i bleed yiu breath i breath u need water i need water. If we dont get past transgressions from the past  and quit bickering over pigmentation and religion we are ALL doomed.
@marclamonthill You so know the 3/5 was a way ro stop counting slaves as a whole right? In hopes of stopping the import of more. And another thing drop the african american bullshit. I have a friend thats white as mayonnaise and he is more african american than 99% of people claiming it.
@strong151 @SouthernLady328 Has a degree in history. So again explain how? Even fredrick@douglass and MLK saw the constitution as a glorious document. So explain it if you can..
@TalbertSwan @SouthernLady328 And clinton wasnt a serial adulterer? Even after elected president, IN THE WHITHOUSE ITSELF??? Your fake outrage is laughable

@strong151 @SouthernLady328 Explain how america was founded by racists?
@SouthernLady328 @JustinTrudeau Because im tired of people squabbling over a petty things. Things they read and fail to actualy research to see how the@media spins it. This an article written by an obama administration democrat.  Read it                        https://t.co/pEgQgOLvpy
@photonjeff @JustinTrudeau No your a moron kissing another countries ass and maybe yiu should read this wrote by a democrat of the obama administration.                  https://t.co/pEgQgOLvpy
@heisadisgrace @JustinTrudeau @RedTRaccoon Uh just leave now because their will be no indictments
@SouthernLady328 @JustinTrudeau Its both parties that have turned on the people. Are you so dense that you cant see it? So dense that no matter what you stick to@party limes?
@elephant1417 @JustinTrudeau Obviously millions upon millions support him.
@FckTrmp1 @JustinTrudeau @Jojo_Lovejoy If its a shithole then leave. Move to canada and see how that works for you, or sweden or even england france or germany. Then tell is in a year if the US is such a shit hole. For a lawyer you seem rather fragile
@BernsteinVicki @JustinTrudeau @CObywayofME The greatest threat to America is whinning morons like you that think the other side of the aisle is better than this one. Your a sheep and you all squabble over perty party lines when neither side cares about you or i or this country anymore. Quit believing lies
@ITMFA17 @IvankaTrump I feel for these people, I do, its not a lack of compassion its more of a common sense and not wanting to re live historical proof that mass immigration is bad. Proof is in our own land, look what mass immigration did to the native americans lives and culture.
@ITMFA17 @IvankaTrump I know we are a country founded on immigration.BUT that was centuries ago..We can allow everyone in anymore. Its a population, infrastructure, and cultural nightmare waiting to happen We have to shut down the border for at least 4-5 years and let everyone get assimilated/settled
@ITMFA17 @IvankaTrump This link here is from Senator Mccaskill and Senator Portman explaining how immigrant children were turned over to traffickers in 2014 Like I said media doesnt report on this like they do when someone is in office they don't approve of. its a doublstandard	https://t.co/AKEHM8Zo1O
@ITMFA17 @IvankaTrump Picture is Generic from 2016. Down almost ot bottom they reference an Inspector General report that says 4000 were lost in 2016. I just wanted to show the hypocrisy of the media and social media. This isnt new of losing track of the kids.	 https://t.co/tT3HQV6etX
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost https://t.co/xBUa5HBsmY
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost Thats what i cant understand..every administration for last 5 decades hasnt cared about you and I. They are about greed and money amd power. And the media is their propganda machine. Do you realize every media you read see or hear is owned by only 6 mega comapanies with agendas
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost The phote was one i grabbed with 2016 headline nothing to do with 4000 kids missing but juat to say no out rage of him posting pic with his child as there was these last few days. It is atrocious but why condemn one administration when it happens in every administration
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost Its at the bottom of article by the independent. The link to memo by senator is about the kids being handed over to traffickers in 2014
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost It wont be because media is too politicized now.
@EWErickson according inspector general report says obama admin lost 4000 in 2016 alone
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost Another from senator mccaskilll    https://t.co/AKEHM8Zo1O
@tinfoilasshat @washingtonpost https://t.co/a430ClwFPS
@IvankaTrump Maybe you all should see the media gave obama administration a pass on losing kids and giving them over to traffickers https://t.co/AKEHM8Zo1O
@JustAGrummp2 @morecaityplease @IvankaTrump If you wanna know more here is report from Senator McCaskill from like 2016 as well.		https://t.co/AKEHM8Zo1O
@JustAGrummp2 @morecaityplease @IvankaTrump Either way its not good to lose kids..but the double standard amd the press refusing to make one administration look bad while excusing another isnt right. The media is just crazy now a days. So politicized they cant be trusted..no matter what side they are on ..imo
@JustAGrummp2 @morecaityplease @IvankaTrump Hard to find in american@press because they wont ask the question or@publish it due to making obama look bad.  I meam the pic of kids slwwping in cages was feom 2014 but hardly anyone questioning it. Complete double standard in my opinion
@JustAGrummp2 @morecaityplease @IvankaTrump Read down to almost the bottom and you will see the figure feom 2016	And this is a left of center publication mind ya.                                          https://t.co/a430ClwFPS
@Janmoon1964 @AlexandraMcG @The_UnSilent_ @IvankaTrump Where was the outrage when this picture surfaced of obama and his kids in 2016 after they had lost 4000 children—-yes 4000 unaccompanied children! Didnt know that did ya? Why, because media wouldnt report it because it would of made him look bad. #WhereAreTheChildren https://t.co/nB0qqMh1qQ

@ITMFA17 @IvankaTrump Double standard to the Nth degree. You all let the media divide you and believe anything they write. You never actually research the truth of the matter. You just accept it. Makes me sick how contolled you all are. If you are so outraged get off your ass and do something.

@shirleytang_ny @argonlord @RawStory And where is the outrage that 4,000 were unaccounted for under the last administration? Seriously where is outrage of pic of obama with his kids? Its a double standard with most of you.
@shirleytang_ny @argonlord @RawStory i know we are nation of immigrants But now have a population of 300 million plus. Where will we keep everyone? Feed? Seriously think about it like that. Or realize mass immigration doesnt work and destroys culture case in point european mass immigrarion destoyed native Americans
@shirleytang_ny @argonlord @RawStory We have enough issue with children norn here not being cared for and our social services cant handle that. So where is the outrage on that? Oh wait there is none. When does this lunacy end with you people? Younthink we can accept everyone?
@shirleytang_ny @argonlord @RawStory First off what type parent sends their children unaccompanied to another country theough all that mess thats below our southern border? Secondly they were released to vetted family and friends. Thirdly how is it that we are responsible for them? We cant make them answer the phone
@ChollaChubby @mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Ok you people have let the media let control your beliefs. First off these missingchildren were unaccompanied to begin with. So much for parental caring huh? Secondly there were give over to vetted family members or vetted friends of family members Those people didnt answer phone
@circlestarSC And another thing you lefties have gotten so bent out out of shape over trump you believe anything you hear. Give the man a chance! Most 95% of those kids came under obama. Look it up. And we do not need anymore people here till the ones here assimilate
@circlestarSC I wasnt trying to be nice if you talk down to me and my country you can goto hell. I didnt spend time in that god forsaken desert to have liberal fools talk down to me. Dictionary? Why would i need that? Dont jump to conclusions about a persons education level due to one outburst
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 So why condemn them as a whole? Because history shows time and time again that if the so called peaceful majority doesnt get involved them atrocities occur at the hamds of extremist! 300 million people dedicated to destruction of any culture that does t submit.   Thats scary
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Most russians were peaceful uet again stalin  drove  the agenda and killed 15-20million. The silent peaceful majority again irrelevant. Most japanese were peaceful yet they allowed the radicAl to butcher their way across SE Asia killing 12 million people with bayonets and shovels
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Most germans were peaceful uet the nazi’s drove the agenda amd killed 14M people, the moderates were irrelevant. Most chinese were peaceful yet the communists drove the agenda amd close to 50million were killed by them. The peaceful majority again irrelevant.
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 So why should we worry about islam? Because it is the radicals that massacre and behead. Because it is the radicals that drive the agenda. All the lessons of history show that the silent majority are irrelevant.
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 There are 1.2 billion muslims in the world. By all accounts of multiple intelligence agencies of multiple countries the consensus is  that 20-25% are radicalized. That means their are 250-300 million radical muslims in the world. That is the size of the US population
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 This will be long and i apologize if its gets out of order. We talk about peaceful muslims and radical muslims. We say we cant condemn a group of people because of the actions of a few. I say that is bullshit and will explain exactly why its bullshit now and bullshit historically
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Its a fact. All races amd religions have their crazies without a doubt.  But what other ideology can you name in modern society that will not adapt to changing of times? What other ideology keeps wen as virtual slaves? Thinks that it is ok kill women whom ha w been raped?
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 No i havent its the basis of my whole argument..Look at what mass immigration did to native american culture..
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 And by the way—how can one be racist against an ideology? Seriously how??
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Maybe you should meet a few egyptian Coptics or an older iranian born before 1979  and share a cup of tea..and become very afraid
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 What have i said that is racist? I stste facts period. Every fact i can back up. Its always the same..your against immigration you are a racist..if your against islam you are a racist. Its all you lefty loons can say. You cant debate because the fact best you everytime!
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Prosecuting them AFTER 20 damn years of it happening!!! Because people like you turned the other cheek!! You allowed it and your still making excuses
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Why are they bigoted? Im a stident of history mass immigration does not work!!! It will change the fabric and essence of a country. Mass immigration doesnt allow assimilation. So the people thats been here generation after generation should have to assimilate to aNother culture ?
@worldflood1 @myeucatastrophe @debv219 And another thing candy ass....95% of the kids came across under obamas watch! Get your facts straight
@poozwah @myeucatastrophe @rjoseph7777 Decent? Seriously?? What are they going to do? You cant beat us, you suck our hind tit when the world meeds us..the curse is when we stand up for OUR laws. Go fuck yourself
@worldflood1 @myeucatastrophe @debv219 They should have stayed in their own damn country. Quit trashing ours. People like you are such pussies
@myeucatastrophe @DaveLisney First of all they shouldnt have been here. Second of all they were turned over to family and now they arent found due to family. Thirdly you should be more worried about your daughter or granddaughters being raped by that muslim horde your leaders have embraced
@lemming128 @ThomasAtcheson @gandofliqueen @KTHopkins @NickScan92 You lefties talk about inclusiveness, but it meams- we are inclusive as ling as your ideas and beliefs are the same as ours . Biggest hypocrites on the planet. Long live TOMMY ROBINSON, when you are all at the mercy of sharia law i hope you realize he was right
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 The truth is they are scared of muslim back lash plain and simple. To politically correct to actually care about your own people that have been there for centuries. Same is happening here across the pond. Islam is not compatible with civilized society
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Vulnerable? As in they are afraid of retribution by muslims? You and your ilk are a joke. You and your ilk are the reason the great country of my forefathers has turned into the poster child of why mass immigration doesnt work! So you believe what you want. I know the truth
@lemming128 @ThomasAtcheson @gandofliqueen @KTHopkins @NickScan92 For what? Telling the truth? You lefty lil bitches are such pussies
@john196201 @AprilGaladriel @RayGorman11 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 His base are the only ones that seem to care that europe is being overrun by the muslim hoardes. Just like they over run everything in their path till the crusades..again learn some history about your beloved friends that you are so sure need to be included imto civilized society
@_Shourie @Imamofpeace They mean muslims from pakistan afghanistan and that area which are located on the asian continent. To scared to say muslim
@john196201 @RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Goats bleat, im a human. You keep drinking the koolaid friend.
@ThomasAtcheson @gandofliqueen @KTHopkins @NickScan92 So your going to stand for the muslims over your bretheren? Seriously thats the reason UK is being over run by those filthy maggots. You should read history..they destroy every thing they xome into contact with moron
@RayGorman11 @AprilGaladriel @john196201 @SimnaniIqbals @KTHopkins @NickScan92 They silenced reporting afraid of british reaction. They silenced the reporting because of muslim pressure. Grow some damn balls or you better learn arabic
@Phil_Gwilliam @KTHopkins @NickScan92 Law to just protect muslims. They do t want it reported on because it might influence the jury? Are you that dense? That gullible? Desr god they dont want it reported on because it will stir nationalism up. They dont want it reported on due to pressure from muslim groups.
@flyaway_k @JamberryTaft @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts Earth 2 was a decent show by the way..one season such a shame..even after an emmy..when we learn to get along and spend our resources correctly and fairly we can visit distant worlds, harvest our resources from asteroids, i stead of killing this world.
@flyaway_k @JamberryTaft @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts Im not a lefty or righty or central im a realist People kill people. Fix the issue with people. Kids have No empathy any more. They are raised by peers and social media.When we still squabble and kill over the pigmentation of a persons skin, religion and greed, what do u expect?
@flyaway_k @JamberryTaft @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts I used facts from multiple sources..there have been ten shoorimgs at highschools since january 1st. The others are on college campus and includes suicides which actually contibutes to over half the total gun deaths in The US. Guns and knives and bombs are inanimate. Fix the human
@JamberryTaft @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts @flyaway_k There has been 10, and ues that is way way too many. Your using statstics that include college dorm rooms and accidental shootings
@Shay45 @InfamousK48 @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts @flyaway_k The reason is parents do not raise thier children. Tv, social media, and video games raise them. They have no empathy raised like this
@Shay45 @InfamousK48 @ChristineofCA @BreakingNAlerts @flyaway_k Your wrong
@TweetNathanRich @CaptainsLog2O18 @NoraBAmes Yes thats the issue!! Guns and knives are inanimate objects till a human touches it and uses it. Fix the real issue, the human!
@Clear_Critique @bigfranky75 @ShaunKing Its relevant die to the fact that cars nor guns cause death without a human. They are inanimate objects controlled by humans.  Fix the human and you will stop gun violence and car accidents.
@Clear_Critique @bigfranky75 @ShaunKing Yes i am in the context that being scared of something isnt the answer
@VeeCee30 @LCardwel2 @20committee Explosive devices?hamas in middle shooting? Tge even admitted  it
@MiriamShulamit @20committee @Ukrainolution Lmao god you are dense
@SDSF3333 @jimmy_thistle @20committee No trumper but the US has been meddling in foreign elections for YEARS even installing whole governments.
@repeet95060 @20committee Lmao. Goid clean hands? There hasnt been goid clean hands since the the 50’s maybe. Both sides are complicit in greed and corruption. Quit bickering over party lines amd wake up! They are all worthless lip-service charlatons. And you all figjt over them like they actually care
@Royalstar2363 @20committee Tell me the diuference between this admin and any other since the 60’s. And before you go off the deep end..im no trumper
@LCardwel2 @VeeCee30 @20committee They werent unarmed..and Palestinians have had opportunity after opportunity for a two state solution starting under the league  nations were the first plan was developed in ‘45-‘46..
@itsreallymyrna @telepastor @LitsaDremousis @SherryTiff @ShaunKing I have a problem with the islamic religion as well. I do not want to be near it due to 250-300million islamic radicals in the world. You do realize thats roughly equivalent to the population of the US, right? Does that make me a racist? The mN said religion not a race of people
@LitsaDremousis @ShaunKing What is racist about his comments? So  your a racist now if you do not like another’s religion? Your a racist ifnyou do not except anothers vies or beliefs? Seriously? You all are morons using the race card. Shaun king is just the new jesse jackson and al sharpton. Most racist
@MrOdinga @FoxNews @TomiLahren @WattersWorld It truly doesnt matter
@MrOdinga @FoxNews @TomiLahren @WattersWorld Not exactly...forefathers pictured it as being european immigrants..we have 300 million plus population..its time to close borders for a bit and let those here fully assimilate amd see how birth/death rate is affected ..then see how many per year is feasible.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Well mine come from scotland in 1720 and 1728. In what was then just backcountry of NC. I live on part of same land my family ancestors moved cleared and worked and prospered. Exact same land where the ulsters GOT along with the cherokee. Until the english ruined that.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump I said egypt had the largest population of christians Not that christianity was the majority in the region St mark brought it to Alexandria egypt, around 33AD Then the savage muslims destroyed anything in their path Quit picking a few words and turning them around. Clueless u r
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Sigh you are nothing but a complete ass. You are not worthy of conversation because you are of the mindset of “im right” no matter what you say. Your not right or wven closely right. Just to set record straight, i double majored in college- comp science and ancient history
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Babbling? Lmao yes we use numerals referred to as Arabic numerals. They actually came into being in india, after brahmagupta first added the numeral of zero.  I said muslim anyway never mentioned Arabs. Most arabs were christian, egypt had the largest popuplation before Muhammad
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Our founders didmt mean immigrants NOT from europe. Thats the key all of you overlook. Show me one pamphlet, one speach, one book that contradicts my statement and i will say im wrong. And im a voracious reader of history and biographies
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Frame. Large influx of  immigrants yearly changes the fabric and very nature of a country in the wrong way. And until people learn that pigmentation of a person deosnt define them then it wont work. Until the masses quit squabbling over religion it wont work.  Slow it down
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump They need time to assimilate. You cant let masses in amd expect assimilation it womt happen. And you cant expect americans to assimilate to immigrants culture because we arent in their country. Your ideas are great but wanted to quickly. I can agree to probably most but not time
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump They do not try to assimilate especially muslim immigrants. They try to change our lives to fit their beliefs. And again do NOT say that isnt so. Its been their way simce 647 A.D. we need to close the borders and fix our coumtry before taking more people in for now.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump From land owners? We have a population of 300 plus million that we have to take care of now. And have you noticed the large majority of immigrants now we have to assimilate to their cultural beliefs. Why is that? And sont you DAREsay we do not becuase that is lie if you do
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Sigh..our diversity is killing is at the moment.we cant tske in everyone..and not st the rste we do..its a matter of population density. There is only so much land food and water. What are you going to do? Create another disaster like the inner cities are? Take land away?
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump America’s greatness comes from American inginuity, leading im education, and its people. Plotics has NO place there. Economically we can still lead but the feild has to be leveled for us to do that now. And people need to worry about thier own country more than someone elses
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Read between the dang lines. They want Israel removed.  Period end@of story
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Do you think Iran outting troops on the ground, not just any troops but  their-elite troops in Syria is caused by DT? They were in process of moving them before he was electrd. They did it to bolster Assad and the russians encouraged it. Stop letting headlines dictate to u.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump I do not care what happens in the middleast. They will never stop fighting.  What i care about is that you and i live in a country that has given and given and continues to give to others but doesnt take care of its own. Its time for a little america rebuilding imo.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump I wasnt defending him. I do like some things about him. But again your missing the point. It is all of them congress senate the whole lot. Its not just one man or one woman . They all are guilty. When is it ok to do what is right for america? Why do other countries come first?
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Seriously its like all@of you have blinders on and cant see it for what it truly is., the government has become a bloated mass of cancerous people whom are disconnected with reality when it comes to our country’s well being no matter which side it is. They are all guilty.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Our governent is broken. until you sheep realize it and quit bickering over petty things, stop paying more attention to what happens in hollywood thn you do your own communities nothing will change. If its a nation changing peice of legislation, then it should be put to pop vote.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Reminiscent of Rome in its last decades The “elected” rulers of both parties are living like kings and queens, hence the lack of understanding of what the common masses actually want and need. Nownits what the big corps and donors want and need.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Your missing the point maam. Im not saying the man isnt any of those things our government doesnt work..it doesnt matter whom is president. One side tries to make the other side look as bad as it can stalls any legislation It has become a stagnant cesspool of greed and corruption
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump The problem is we have become sheep instead of shepherds. Both sides are to blame. Both side are crooks. They all use theor position to better themselves and family instead of country. Onama was weak and other leaders knee he was an apologist. Trump@has balls but has no help
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Lol ur joking right? You blame him@for all the@problems in our country?
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Lmao yall are morons. Aggression in that area has been going on since time immortal but yest you blame america
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Israel has had enough. Its time to quit appeasing.  They now know they have friends didnt know that under obama. Just like new saudi prince told palistine  either come to the peace table or shut up. Strength stops aggression everytime.
@ItsMeCathi @sandraram98 You are a liar. Ling  and lee weere released after bill clinton  went iver and asked. Alm the others were released due to another country asking since obama wouldnt have talks with NK. Sweden got several released. Jimmie carter got ajones released crazy Miller went to get arested
@ThePlumLineGS @sandraram98 @PeterHamby WhT about obamas history with bill ayers?
@EdKrassen @sandraram98 Lmfao at 72. AGAIN Ed “wirefraud” Krassenstein, you and your brother post false statements. 22 people indicted, most of them russians 4 americans indicted two under dubious charges.
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump Cant be trusted? Most smericans didnt want the Iran deal. But of course your liberal apologist president obama went through with it anyway. So quit complaining about America standing up for itself finally. We have been on wrong end@of SO many deals its time we got it right
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump That region has been unstable since the rise of islam in the 6th century. Learn histroy before you start flappping your gums and saying nonsense. You have no clue at all. Reason the US is where its at now because of dimwitted, apologists. Sorry for their european heritage
@TheKudzuQueen @PeterSweden7 @realDonaldTrump They had already been firing At each other dimwit.
@EdKrassen @PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump And you should admit that you and your brother are crooks. Wire fraud specialists that still work in MLM websites taking money from@people with false promises. You and your brother only care about followers so you sow discord with all of your retweets. You are an utter moron
@clevelandrager @realDonaldTrump That distiction has already been acomplished by former president
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Wake up and realize the more divided we are the more power they have. Yall squabble over the most petty stuff. Most of you care more about the hollywood scene or pro sports figures than you do your own communities You think people want open borders?Hell even cali cities rebelling
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You can believe russian interference or aliens but its the before mentioned reasons as to why. Yes russia tried but they didnt throw election to him amd he did not@collude with them. And when muellers waste of time and resources is over you will see no@indictment nor impeachment
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Thats why 90% or higher of them have no@clue about how most americans live amd what most want. You would be shocked at the people whom are afraid to voice their real feelings about immigration foreign policy due to being ridiculed and called racists. Thats why trump won
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Neither side of the governmental aisle works anymore. Its a disgrace that the same ones get voted in due to lack of options. No normal american can be president nor senator nor represnative anymore. It take money and lots of it to be that now.
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Im no trumper im no retarted repub nor am a loony lefty..im american period. I believe in values of americans. I do not think we should change our values to suit people whom@come here. If they do not want to accept them@then leave. I@do mot believe in government always in ur face
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews No you are tge sheep
@MyInfoTiffany2 @SRLoy2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews And the rest isnt? Grow up they are all liars! Geez yall make me sick fighting over people that do not care about you! At least he says what he thinks true or not. He says what most people are too scared to say. The rest just say. It behind closed doors.
@flipsville @realDonaldTrump They never stopped. Damn do not be so gullible
@SRLoy2 @MyInfoTiffany2 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Why do you think the left is any better? Seriously? Neither side gives a tats butt about you or I. They pay lip service st election time then soend all the term of trying to make other side look bad. Geez wake the heck up
@eloiseat6 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Lmao do you think the persians actuallystopped working on their nuke program?
@AzimiKeyvan @bevroley703 @realDonaldTrump Actually only 100billion of it was frozen assests, we handed you 60billion. And now we will take it back. Since you only funnel it to groups like hezbollah and hamas.
@Col02177 @realDonaldTrump You think it was smart to make that deal? You think they have stopped thier nuke program?
@mjmarquardt @cnelson920 @SteveSchmidtSES You should be worrying about morion M-103. First step in implemering the UN decree against  Islamaphobia .
@Jsauer54Tm @mjmarquardt @cnelson920 @SteveSchmidtSES Somis the left’s. Desr lord wake the fuxk up and throw all of them out. Quit being a party line person. They dont give a rats ass about you or eye. They have NO clue the issues normal everyday peope deal with They all live in gstes communities and are catered to like kings/queens
@Ehrest @mjmarquardt @cnelson920 @SteveSchmidtSES Lmao dear god all of you left and right party people are so far down the rabbit hole. All you all do is defend and fight slong party lines. It sickens me to know my fellow countrymen have become so indoctrinated by one side or other that they cant see niether side cares anymore.
@mjmarquardt @cnelson920 @SteveSchmidtSES You think the left doesnt do the same to promote its ideologies? Come people wake up and realize neither side works. Its time to start over. Their is too much greed and selfishness now. They do nothing but try to make the other side look bad
@SteveSchmidtSES And the left isnt when it owns the administration? Wake up and realize neither side cares. Its time to abolish this cess pool of greed and big donors and start over
@jamescando @FMoniteau Im guessing your ok with letting all the muslims in the world come on over? Correct? I suppose you have no issues with anything the left does ami again correct? You want to belittle because you dont have the ability to debate anything other wise.
@jamescando @FMoniteau Trump wasnt elected when he fucked the whore. What more do you meed yiu small mimded liberal fuck
@jamescando @FMoniteau Still wasnt elected so has no bearing. Go back to your balloon lil james. Let the adults talk a while
@FMoniteau @jamescando Least he didnt commit adultery while elected and in the Whitehouse...hmmm you librards have very short memories
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Ohhh did lil james get his feelings hurt? Poor baby...did the big bad man bust your closed off balloon? ..
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Yea sure u would James. Bye bitch
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill You know i bet you wouldnt say that to my face. Easy to spout belittlements safely in your small closed off sounding booth world..And by you saying no@to@call you sir cuz ya work for living. Thats something a sergeant would say. That comes from a former 3-505 PIR A comp
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Yes . Close minded people dont accept the reality they live in.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Calling me an idiot but ur the one that retweets posts from one of the brothers being investigated for wire fraud and ponzi scheme
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Its not conspiracy..how isnit conspiracy to look at the board members of a corporation then look at board members of central bank and see that they sit on same ones? How isnit conspiracy to see the policy the banks throws out helps said corps? You have a closed mind
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Yea ok. Its obvious you are entrenched into your complete famtasy world. Nice talking with you.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Others? Its called research into board members . Where are they sitting, what family members also sit on boards of huge corporations ..what baord members ALSO sit on central bank boards. Central banks enslave every nation to debt. It in black and white.   Just DIG
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Nope but bery few of us have the strength to@continue to serve little man. You better get prepared for what is coming. Laugh and belittle all you want if it makes you feel better
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Yea im@the idiot. I feel sorry for you that your delusion has carried you so far from reality. You@keep believing that garbage your fed by the media. Did you know that six big mega corps own every peice of media you read watch hear ..i meam movies music news whatever
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill I spent time in military and ive been around the world i see it for what it is. The world is controlled by by maybe few thousand. And if you follow the evidnce you will see it as well. Central banks fund both sides of a war. Its lucrative. Its all on paper just do the digging
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Nutcase? Lmao
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill And you wont recognize the double standard at all. You wont criticize anyone on the left just like most wont critcize amyone on the right if the are on the right themselves. Its 2018 and we still fight over religion and a persons pigmentation. So what can i expect..sighs
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill I do vote have for 31 years but no matter whom we vote in they lip service and never donthe right thing
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill @Comey Omg thats the lie inwas referrimg to at the beginning.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Its both sides and i do see it sir. Trust me more than most evidently
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Nope same subject. You are blind and will not accept both sides are crooks and people defend them along whatever party they are affiliated with. Comlete idiocy on both sides
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Im not a trump supporter why cant u see that? I could care less about his orange idiot self. Im more concerned with our senators and congressmen. And the double stands in place
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill @Comey Wasnt dossier it was memos from his meeting with trump. Comey that is
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill I am appalled that so many cant see the simple truth that its not one administration its all of them. They do not work anymore. Its time to start over
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill No im not n the past im here and now. You are deflecting the truth of the situation we find ourselves in. Its a pattern that started decades ago and its gotten worse every cycle
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill This while thing has been just another waste of money and resources. Just to@make one side look bad. Thats all wither side has done since the 60’s. They do@not govern anymore. Greed power special imterest groups and central banks rule america now
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill There will be no@imdictment of trump. Period. Wont happen just like. Othing will happen to the others mcabe comey . Point is he lied under oath thats a crime.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Every time you try to have discourse with people on the left they always try say nothing there nothimg there But if its something against the right then by fod its complete fact Same with oeope on the right anout the left. Its crazy  that all of you are so far dowm rabbit hole
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill https://t.co/XwP9loFoqt
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill He lied . Comey even SAID that he predicated the outcome of the hillary email investigation on her chances of winning election ..how in the world is that legal? How??
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill How do@i have nothing? I just told you nothing but truth. Words from their@own mouths. You are a sheep following party line bullshit. Period. There is a war coming you and others of your ilk will not fare well
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill @Comey He leaked material thats a damn crime. He admited to doing so after ue lied about it.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill @Comey Omg im an ignoramusbut yet you pick and choose when same behavior is either criminal or it ismt. People like you jave ruined this country. Grow some damn balls
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill I read the article and had read it previously as well before you threw it@out there.  WhT anout Mcabe? He lied 3-4 times to@prosecutors. And Meuller has said even the appaerance of false testimony id felonious behavior
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Dude are you seriously that dense??? He damn well knew they did and if younwill ne honest with yourself you know it to! Quit being a sheep to a govermmet that soes mot care about us. So what about Comey? Any of defense of him?
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill So why is their a double standard for some? It orevelant on both sodes of the aisle. Im no trumper im an american that sees my coutrymem and women swuabnle and defend people, that do NOT give 2 cents for any of us, along party lines. When will any of you wale up.
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill Clapper lead under oath to the senate. He was asked does the NSA collect ANY data at all on millions of americans ..he flat out said NO. Thats perjury and a chargeable offense. Comey same thing he said under oath he had never been an anonymous source for leaks.  then admitted it
@rhonda_harbison @thehill Muslims are terrorists and bombers. Quit posring pictures of different people and claiming them to be one and the same Muslim silence on terrorists actions speaks volumes. You know most germans were peaceful in WW2 but hitler still killed 6-7million. The peaceful were irrelevant
@TomWellborn @thehill If rule of law matters why are comey clapper and few others beimg indicted for lying just as flynn was? You want rule of law carried out yet you only want it done to a select few am i correct?
@jamescando @DavidScholt7 @thehill If rule of law matters why are comey clapper and few others beimg indicted for lying just as flynn was? You want rule of law carried out yet you only want it done to a select few am i correct?
@Pun_Starr @ShefVaidya Most of the world despise muslims Its ideology is warped amd the people whom claim its peaceful will not stand up to the ones warping it You reap what you sow You hold down women, you kill your own for not being dressed properly, you riot at any derogatory comment about mohomed
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Not if the people getting elected are of the same cloth thats ran since the 60’s.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Ive lost faith in americans willingness to change. Its 2018 and we still squabble over the pigmentation of a persons skin. We still fightnover religion. We went to the moon 5 1/2 decades why are we not there using its resources instead of building tanks and planes? Agenda
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump The solution is 100million marching on DC. That is the only solution. Anything less than that wont work. There is more factors in this than just America. Its global and its an agenda to every country and person enslaved to debt.  Good night and i enjoyed talking with you
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Ive lost all faith in our system
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Plus to get elected what hope does a decent good caring individual have? Money is the ruin of all. How much does a person need?? If you had a billion dollars in cash. No interest or snything and spent 10G a day. How long wouldnit take to spend? ..............273yrs
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump But they cote the same ones in Jessie. I could never ever be senator or the president. And thats whT is needed not businessmen/women not career politicians but some common people that give a damn. But that cant happen now. At least i cant see it happening. When it costs a billion
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump They are taught to@let others handle their problems.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump When younare taught in schools thats its wrong to@oppose the government and oppose any authority it is basically raising indentured servants to th flawed system. People would call the cops if a neighbor is loud instead of just going over and tslking to them.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump People have lost empathy towards each other. They are so insular now. Hey that guy needs help..but he might kill me if i stop to help. Scared of their own shadows no a days. Afraid of what people might say if they stsnd up. Its a cycle im not sure can be broken.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump They may have the courage but how can they act without the means to do so? It comes back to caring. You have to help your neighbor in order to acheive the goal. Poor people cant stand and resist when they lose their homes or cant buy food because they took off work
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump People have to care in order to make a difference Todays society of kardashians and reality tv means more than your neighbor needin help When people cant afford to be out of work to stand up and resist the govenmt wins hands down and can do what it wants along with corporations
@jonseamans @Vigorous_24 @Jell0wYell0w @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump No scandals? Seriously are u delusional? Every president has had scandlas since the 1960’s
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Tske weeks of time off while the worker gets nothing. Ceo is payed millions but the people doing the actual work is fed scraps and looked down upon. Why would they care? They have no hope. Again stagnation, greed and corruption ..the fall of rome
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump When people work and can actually just barely make it and have to goninto debt to just live and when i say live i mean just food and shelter why would they care? They see no hope at this stage. They work see the executives drive fancy cars live in fancy ridiculous homes
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Goes back to feudal and medieval times. People are classes mow amd are basically forced to stay in that class by flawed unfair hierarchal system. The lower class and most populous usually will only care enough to get by. Thats brings on stagnation thats hard to reverse
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump If the people care then they will tske action. What reason do they have to care now? When 1% of the worlds population controls the world people feel useless. Grsnted some of them bring their troubles on themselves.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Start caring
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump If things arent stopped now your children will live in a xomplete orwellian society. Its almost that today
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Im trying to make all of you see you are arguing over stuoid perty things when the problem lies with our government and the unwillingness of the people to stop it. Dont believe everything the media says. It is controlled by one side or the other period. Its NOT true journalism
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Im NOT disputing that statistic never was and never said i was.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Institutions and see what a huge difference their is. Cows have 4 stomachs to digest grass and roughage. Its not meant to eat corn and other cheap grain. It changes the nutritional value in it. Thats just one example
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump They conduct thier research by being told how to. By who funnels the most money. Look at research on the difference between grain fed and grass fed beef. That research was funded by the beef industry and the huge ag grsin consortium. Then look at a the many studies by indendent
@scottcalli @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump You think im crazy just do some digging if you care too. Thats the mIn problem now people tske what they hear oe read in media at face value. You think those big board members do not have an agenda?
@scottcalli @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Those six are owned by or have board members from 154 megacorps that control over 50% of the worlds economy.  Those same megacorps owners also have seats on every central bank in the world. They enslave every country to debt. They finance BOTH sides of all major wars
@scottcalli @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Im not right wing  nor am i left wing. Im for the people not a party.  Do you actually know how many media companies thier are? 6 everything you read hear or watch is comtrolled by 6 companies with agendas. Im tslking movies news music you name it. Guess who owns those six?
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump The 17th amendment needs repealed. The senators need to be elected by the state governments that were elected by the people. They need term limits just like president. Judges need to be electrd not put in@place by one party or the other. Cant you see how bad things are?
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump founded as a republic But now are democratic republic Key difference is a democracy can take away certain unalienable rights that every person has and keep the minority downtrodden And we are seeing that today where huge oopulation centers want to tell everyone what to do.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Those stats maybe close to true. But its the point that you mention the USDA as if it is infallible. The USDA is the problem as to why we have to import so much. That and idiots that waste SO much. Dont grab an article and throw it out there like its the absolute truth
@LeighCardinal @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Instead of your own eyes! Almost as pathetic as the fsct most people csre more about what is hapoening in hollywood than their own communities.  Its time for a damn change or we are Rome all over again. Corruption stagnation, irresponsibility all the same things rome died of
@LeighCardinal @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump We have become sheep instead of the sheperds we are supoosed to be. It disgusts me to to SO many of my fellow countrymen sqabble over and defend politicians that could care less about our welfare. Its pathetic that you allow a very controlled media influence you
@LeighCardinal @Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Im not a trumper. Im an American that sees how you all fight and squabble over scraps. Yall fightnover party lines. Neither party give two cents about you or I. They care about power greed and making the ither side look bad. They do not govern anymore. They need abolished
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump Its the stance they take that keeps  small farms out of the way. Its the stance they take and that is supoorted by greedy politicians that requires us to import food.  And you do not get true reports from NY times and packer. We pay big ag farmers not to grow
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump You want to debate all this and your snarky comments about red states and welfare im your huckleberry young lady. I will demoralize you in fromt of this sounding booth audience. You have no clue how this country was founded and is supposed to actually work.
@Jell0wYell0w @Vigorous_24 @MunnRlmunn @PaulJames1970 @rainmakermays @alyboger2227 @realDonaldTrump The same usda that will support compNies like monsanto ? The same usda that send armed agents to farms that kill or tske all livestock that are being grown naturally just because some big ag coorp complained? The same USDA that suportd feed lot operstions that feed you nasty food
@Frances_Fisher @realDonaldTrump That was true then. Where will we house everyone when they start having more children and then when more come and they have children? How will we feed them? Clothe them? Seriously over population will an issue. We have 300 million plus population now. Will government take land?
@WhiteTrashGal @sturgeongal @4everNeverTrump The essence of Lord Byron’s speech to the house of lords in 1812 concerning the luddite uprising applies to SO many things happening today here. You people better wake up amd quit squabbling over petty ideologies or we are ruined
@WhiteTrashGal @sturgeongal @4everNeverTrump We have millions dealing with hardships yet our government sends money abroad to help others in that country. Why? Why is that money not used for our benefit? For infrastructure, better food than the swill most eat, better medical, better community projects?? Why?
@WhiteTrashGal @sturgeongal @4everNeverTrump It is all our fault period. We have let our governing bodies, from local to central become puppets of money and greed. They are told what to do when to do it and how to do it not by the people but by party line leaders, corporations and interest groups.
@WhiteTrashGal @sturgeongal @4everNeverTrump You have no clue what fascism really is. You all spew the trigger words but yethave never seen it first hand is my guess. Because if you had you wouldnt use it to describe this administration. People seem to think it ls alm repubs or all dems fault, never that its our own
@curi0s @DLDAlisa @NickMerrill Legitimate? Laughs
@Suzyqfit4u @realDonaldTrump Why do you think donald is so much worse than other presidents? Seeiously neither party cares about you or I anymore. At least he says what he thinks instead of beimg two faced. And i promise you if he is impeached or indicted a civil war will ensue....there is too much division
@noelpaul69 @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Shaf is a british canadian, and muslim. He @ShafPatel will block you when you confront him with facts. His claims all kinds of racism and bigotry against people butnuet isnt open to anything outside of his views and beliefs
@robbabcock3 @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Oh and muslim
@robbabcock3 @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump Shaf is a british canadian, not american

But if u think this company that organizes them is doing so out of pity amd good hearts your very naive. See who funds said organizers and you will see that its in the best imterest of a voting bloc

@treshaus @freeandclear1 @Anootchka Diane is a damn crook. She made huge sums off solyndra scandal. She helped her husband get comtract for cali highspeed rail by using her position. And tou morons keep supporting these people thinking they care about you! Wanna be hip quit listening to their lip, its my tip.

@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Just might wanna be really “woke” thanks for what turned out to be one of the nicer conversations ive had on here.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Do you honestly think that chummy meeeting place is just to have drink and kick back? Lol remeber they own the media. Rothschilds were financimg both sides at waterloo.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller The info is out there..you have to break it down by names, both of people and business- and family ..financing both sides of a war is pretty rewarding for the greedy. Dont let the second paragraph throw you off.              https://t.co/NjtaAM62gU
@queeenboujee @SeaWolv Yes maam you did. But the guy never gave you a solid link . I did.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Has already started that procedure. Its time if they will listen. Most now only care about reality tv or their most loved stars and athletes. Real world issue do not seem to matter as long as the kardashians are safe..ya know
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller If not then oh well. These greedy people make millions and millions from their position. Look at solyndra and the cali rail system and see who and how they made millions from. Very well known long long time senate memeber. Butnits not just her ..its pubs doing it as well
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Mainly to make sure my family is prepared if really turns to crap i suppose. I believe in what the US used to be about. I dont anymore. Its greed greed and greed. a big start would be term limits on house and senate. If that could happen the people might regain some control
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Yea. Maybe but it will be same no matter whose in office. People will fight still over party affiliation believe every pundit and which wver left or right leaning media they live by. and the MSM media will NOT run anything on the central banks. They will shut it down quick
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller You will see the trail if you do..and it may not be obvious..stsrt looking at board members of the corps and https://t.co/kEYhG0hBmA the connections they have to each. Its scary as hell
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Cuz i get frustrated because it seems only a few can see through the bullshit the media feeds us They beleive any half ass story they read and run with. You dont seem to be stupid maam Surely to the lord you can see the truth. If not research. See who owns waht then who owns that
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller But a march of a few thousand a hundred thousand a million wont garner results..30million will..but see how can you get that many to march when hell you fight over party politics. Thats the whole plan is to keep you divided. Enslaved to debt where you have to work and not march
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller I think if they lose the US it sets them WAY back. If they get the us via russia whoever they march onto a one world currency and domination.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Lmao no i dont think the man is normal. But you have to stop the hate for just one side Pam. They are all in it together. How can you explain why if democrats really wanted gun control amd immgrsrion reform that they didnt do it between 2008 and 2011? Obama was new and pwerful
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Its not conspiracy Have you not seen the article and interview of the woman that workd at world centeal bank? A harvard honor graduate. She has beem trying to tell everyone. Scared for her life due to the article she wrote about how they controll all the countries.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Member that isnt wealthy and continues to be in office term after term after term? Even whn they do nothing? unless 20-30million of us march on washington and make some severe changes we are screwed. Its only going to get worse.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller This isnt conspiracy its fact.  They want the biggest player divided, thats us. And they are doing great job. One side blames dems, other side blames pubs. Its all of them. Why do you think no normal man can be president? Or when do you ever see a high ranking senate or house
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Now we get to the media There are basically just 6 huge media conglomerates guess who owns them? Yep same people whom run the Bank of imternational settlements or at least they are part of the 147 super mega corparation entity of the world. They are what we hear and see and think
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller The people that run this are members of banks/financial institutions like goldman-sachs, AXA, Mitsubishi MFJ financial, Deutsch bank, jp morgan, etc. they are the world economy. The funnel HUGE sums of money into big player country’s politicians pockets. The set courses for all
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller This bank is controlled by no government, no country just the top wealthy elites from other central banks, imf and reserve. The control 40-50% percent of worlds economy. Their future is enmeshed in keeping every country ( big player countries) enslaved to debt.
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Trace the money. There are a 147 mega corporations that control almost all big business Those 147 are under one large entity comprising of basically 50 members All those memebers are on board of the Central bank of all central banks- The Bank of International Settlements
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller There is no good in either the senate or the house anymore. Neither side really wants to get any thing done. Due to just wanting votes to stay in piwer and receive ALL that money from the elites that control the central banks. Congress and senate at leat id say 95% , are owned
@PamFromPHMI @GlieseNH @matthewamiller Now i am getting a lil aggravated with him not implementing sanctions for sure. But i do not believe he colluded. But what really pisses me off is that non of you see the whole picture or at least you act as if you dont. NEITHER side gives a rat’s ass about you or I anymore
@nlm53 You want a namny state with unicorns and rainbows. But all you donis tweet from saftey of your home. Peope like you are a dime a dozen. Your no patriot
@nlm53 Democrstic party does the same do they not? Wake uo lady neither party is worthy. They are both out for themselves. Not for you and i. Quit being a sheep
@nlm53 Same as dems usimg immigrants for votes. If dems care why they not pass immigration reform between 2008 and 2011 when they controlled the house and the senate?
@willgregg6 @SeaWolv @shannonrwatts Lmao if you believe anything you just said. Its more like 50-70% percent
@queeenboujee @SeaWolv So we make up 4.4 percent of the worlds population which is about 7.2billion. If your in college studying globaliztion and economics your failing. And you should look up The Bank of Imternational Settlements and learn how they enslave every country to debt.
@queeenboujee @SeaWolv We are third according to united nations.	https://t.co/HINAwraffL
@pescawhatever @julbau68 @SenFeinstein They had the majority when obama was electrd in both congress and in senate. No immigration reform, no gun control, no nothing. So whats the difference now? Wake up people. Our government is broken and owned by big interest groups and corporations! BOTH sides are complicit.
@julbau68 @SenFeinstein Those 50 jump to the tume of the central of ALL central banks - the bank of international settlements. Which enslaves EVERY country to debt. No country has control over it. They funnel huge sums of money imto politicians pockets. Why do none of you ever actually investigate
@julbau68 @SenFeinstein Lmfao! Take away your civil rights?? Are you serious? Both sides are trash. Why any of you supoort either is beyond me! They are all controlled by big interest groups and corporations. Which in turn are all controlled by about 50 central banks of the world.
@The_Mike_D @jaketapper Armed pilots after 9/11. Seemd to have worked pretty well. Whats the difference?
@krassenstein @ctrandolph Get you a lawyer. Wire-fraud mam. This man is a crook him and his brother. He has NO right to be giving advice or speakimg to anyone. He TOOK peoples money knowingly in a Ponzi scheme!!      https://t.co/3vqIwz1693.                     1.             https://t.co/yLMHmahbM1
@nlm53 @PamFromPHMI @matthewamiller Lmao..seriously thats all ya got? With the shit going on and you reply with that? No womder we are are in shape that we are in. Fucking moroms
@GlieseNH @PamFromPHMI @matthewamiller I think the simmering anger among the people is not being addressed. And that powder keg is going to blow. Its coming. We see it it other nations but for some readon are blind to it here
@GlieseNH @PamFromPHMI @matthewamiller It wont go down that way. Look he didnt collude in the interference imo. But yes russia did it and they are still doing it to divide america. why divide? Social break down will bring martial law whixh isnt going to go over here. That will lead to UN involvement and foreign troops
@SenBlumenthal Your so mad at trump where is the outrage at twitter and fb? You think they didmt know with the amount of analytics they use to see whats trending?
@PamFromPHMI @matthewamiller He speaki for vadt majority. You think these few thousand tweets you see are am indication of non support by the majority. Most wamt show support due backlash of family members or work peers..as ive said if he is impeached civil war will consume america.
@donniebnunley @matthewamiller If he’s impeached civil war will ensue..most military enlisted people are conservative. Impeaching him will end bad with foreign UN troops with boots in USA. Mark my words it would result in anarchy.
@TamiD1212 @rudepundit Its not just the wash elites u need to worry about..its the true wealthy elites the ones that control about half the worlds economy..the Bank of International settlements..they run the world..UN woupd be called in after the disaster of trying to take the weapons..come on i say.
@rudepundit @genericrich Most of the enlisted army and good chunk of officers..especially marines and army..are conservative. They will not fire on US citizens if this was tried. Do you realize how impossible it would be to take weapons from a hundred plus million? Without military?
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Im not naive or unaware. I realize what is going on more than most. But that big picture tells me it going to get very very bad soon. World is powder keg..and who or where will the next archduke Ferdinand? its coming im afraid
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Those few control 40-50% of worlds economy. They own  the media which is six major media coorps in the world that controll what we see hear and think. They funnel so much money into the politcal scene in big player countries that those politicians are addicted to the power. Owned
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin 147 mega corps are which are in turn controlled by an even more dense super entity with Members like goldman sachs, AXA, barclays,Mitsubishi UFJ financial group, Deutsch Bank.. they pull the strings at the central of central banks-The Bank of International settlements
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Yes ...oil ...damn scots causing trouble again ..yes we prop up those but it is  not just america..its every nations government to an extent..but every nation and 99% of its citizens are enslaved to debt.  This is how the central banks have orchestrated it and want it
@jmevdz @IAutore @car_nove @BarackObama Not all of those were in 2013 And those are gun SAFTEY not gun control neither side will pass real gun laws for same reason we eat swill that knowing causes issue Big interest groups and coorporations donating to politicians pockets. Why you think cigarettes are still smoked
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Pretty well read. Amd the no sense comes from how do you vet wahhabism? Seriously how? Its nonnegotiable with that sect. If your educated as u seem be then you have to see that. I saw it first hand in 1992-3.
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Again i know that if we spent as much time and money on science instead of athletes and movie stars we would be in the outer solar system harvesting resources instead of killing our planet.m and ourselves. But America isnt all bad. Most would give you the shirt off their backs
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Most of those were british indian and fr french algerian. Some subsaharan and chinese muslims. Im not uneducated probably more well read than most you know. I know russia lost 8-10mil. Brits around 400Thou like US. But i am easy to temper when you disparage my country.
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin No just saying if americans are so bad dont bother coming. Stay put we dont need you. People like you are are weak easily deluded into thinking unicorns and the faye are real. I do not need a lecture from someone who seems to ha e no grasp of reality
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin The worst huh? Then why bother associating with us? Stay the fuck out if you dont like us. We didnt ask you to come. Geez the world views americans as terrible but yet cant seem to stay away. Move to north korea, or congo or sudan ...see how bad americans are the
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin My grandfather and parents taught me that debt makes slaves. I owe nothing to any creditor. Thank god. But you do have a hugel point about people trying to keep up with the jones’ its a sad fact people buy more than they can afford on credit.
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Lol you and people like you forget islamic history. you go ahead and accept who you want into your country. I for one see it for what it is conquering through subtle migration until the population is enough to demand islamic rights in the governing of affairs. Its a proven tactic
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Do you even live in America? I cant decide from your posts. If not why be so worried about our internal affairs?
@Tenten_Shijo @TheFunkyBuffalo @ClintSmithIII Quit talking out your ass. He bottom line is that whites are tired of hearing how bad they are. How racist we is. Grow the fuck up and quit whining. If you think its better in west africa move back. If not then stop the bullshit. You have every right i do. End of fucking story
@Lauren__Bennett @TeezyMak @Niiicolaaaaa @ctrandolph @grietsema23 @ClintSmithIII @jonnysun That was then. Show me one case of systemic racism now. You have same chance i have period. Quit your fucking whining and if you think west africa is better move on. Im tired of hearing how bad us whites are. Seriously we are tired of it. Quit poking the bear
@TeezyMak @Niiicolaaaaa @ctrandolph @grietsema23 @ClintSmithIII @jonnysun Yet you keep voting in democrats. Whose policies are detrimental to all
@JoelRubin_ @MichaelGamache YES! If we spent as much time and money on science as we do on athletes and movie stars... we would be harvesting our needed resources from other moons and asteroids instead of killing the place that gives us life.
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Yea well seems my brave ancestors kicked you fish and chips mfkr’s OUT of north america Militia being a huge factor farmers with a backbone  against those mighty british regulars, mate. Seems the USA is condemned for staying out or jumping in See ya when ya speak Arabic,
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Again read before you speak moron. A huge portion of people who enlist in US military, especially army and marines are of scottish descent.  Its well known england had a hard time with scotts .
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Did you not read what i wrote at all? I said some of our grandfathers came BEFORE the US entered the war which is fact. Especially helped in the RAF.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Over population wouldnt be an issue. Obesity wouldnt be an issue. Cancer wouldnt be an issue. Gun ciolence wouldnt be an issue. Greed kills us all
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Then donit in a fashion to where tue money flows to those that actually makes a difference. Not to entertainment. If we did we would be harvesting resources from moons and asteroids instead of killing the place that gives us all life.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove I see the nfl, hollywood as one of the biggest issues around. We glorify athletes and stars when we shoul be glorifying doctors, scientists, teachers, astronauts etc
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Its is a never ending cycle. How much money does a person really need? If you had a billion in cash and spent 10G a day it would take you over 265yera to spend it all
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Finally back to why i said no change wll happen without marching in 10millions They never will because if they set corporate taxes tooo high they just move to another country and the ones living here making all money will keep it in another country We sre all slaves to the dollar
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Please tell me you are being sarcastic.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove This the link i wanted you to see i was wrong its 24%.   https://t.co/CExyW3qvO7
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove I see both sides but i also see poverty in the usa that needs fixd bforemexicos or central americas. Bottom line is i realize 1% of people control all the worlds money. I get that.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove https://t.co/CExyW3qvO7.  https://t.co/5bu0aehyIj
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove What supposed facts are you speaking of? I can provide the documentation Ibarra..
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Thats not conservatism its beng smart and seeing what will come of mass immigration. If you want to see the effects got london, or paris.. look at the jobless rate.. you think LA has a homeless problem
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Constitution doesnt. No fallacy n my statement. We cant affod to take care of our own here. We cant let more in till we fix the damn issues here. Have you ever been to an overpopulated country? If so do you want it here? Only a limited amount of resouces man
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Progressive conservative whichever they spend what they do not have to spend and the lower middle class always pays for it. The rich will always fuck over the poor because the poor have to work Every day to feed their families. Do you realize that 25% of our budget is for SS?
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove And how do you see that i am clearly conservative? Enlighten me
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Im clearly a constitutionalist that tries to show people on BOTH sides thier group doesnt care about them anymore. I point out facts when. See one side beng blamd for something that the other did nothng about. System is broken
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove They dont care! Damn dude how the hell can you not see that! You think the care? Obviously you do. You think the system still works? Are you so indoctrinated by the bullshit you hear that you cant think for yourself?
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove You claim to be “woke” but you arent! Your a party zombie that cant see whats in your face sir! They (both parties) are for greed and power! Big interest groups and corporations run our country now due to us being sheep instead of the shepherds we were supposed to be.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Omg shut the drivel! Its not the gop its both sides! They pander to you just enough to get a vote. And for the record democratic has done more harm to black americans than anything . They have destroyed the family unit since the 60’s making it a welfare nanny state.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove Obama had both the house and the senate from 2008 till 2011. He nor them passed any gun control. Obama is like the rest he doesnt give two shits about you or I. Grow the fuck up and realize they dont care! Neither side! Change comes from 10million or more marching on washington
@MichaelGamache @SherryLynnhend3 @genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Those fucked up values made alot of our grandfathers come to englands aid long before US officially joined the war. Guess they do not teach that anymore. Figures.  Seems that Scottish blood makes it hard for us to tske being overrun lying down. Just ask Edward.
@genericrich @dutchess_becky @Possessionista @SenatorDurbin Not just his but the 300 million plus that also have weapons. The do not teach you to think anymore do they? Just sit back and the government will take care of you mentality. There will be another civil war before the weapons are tsken away from us.
@Ibarra23594133 @car_nove clinton bush nor obama passed any gun control. And the Big Agriculture interest groups gives 10 times that amount to our politicians so they can feed us poison. Many many many more die because of the swill pushed on us by big Ag. Let that sink in
@kemic9858 @car_nove @POTUS As spineless as obama? Or bush? Or clinton?? None of them passed any gun control. Its not the guns its the damn culture we live in now. Media makes it seem cool to shootup a place. Gives them thier 15min of fame. Quit blaming trump if you cant blame those before him.
@jmevdz @IAutore @car_nove @BarackObama Your from england. Worry about your own countries problems.
@SCloudcroft @WilliamNSmith3 @DonnaWR8 @jeffsessions @POTUS @GovMikeHuckabee @SebGorka @TomFitton @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Well we were told to be vigilant by forefathers. If the government is broken it should be done away with period. And trust me the government is broken. They do NOT care about you or I . Better wake up, its not just dems its repubs as well. All of them are complicit.
@jmevdz @IAutore @car_nove @BarackObama Executive order list for early 2013 and link to all memorandas, exec orders and decress:      https://t.co/MPafIETH10. https://t.co/7B2BQRTTUS
@jmevdz @IAutore @car_nove @BarackObama No he didnt. He made 0 executive orders on gun control period. There werent ANY executive orders of any kind in Jan. 2013.  He gave 3 presidential memorandas in Jan. 2013 concerning gun violence. And from day he took office untill Jan. 2011 dems controlled house and senate https://t.co/tBQuhDwSsP
@williamlegate @ucntmkthshtup @FoxNews I do t deny the Russians meddled. I do not think trump colluded. That said, russia wants its people divided so our system breaks down to the point of us having a civil war...where at that point the UN will call for outside troops to restore order. Guess what troops will show?
Fresh Ginger tea...excellent for helping with digestion. Started a regimen of one cup first thing in the morning. #HealthyLiving #reducedcalorieintake #rawfood #herbalmedicine
@williamlegate @ucntmkthshtup @FoxNews If they even wait on the UN. Im telling all of you to wake up and for the love of your country please read behind the bullshit MSM serves up to you. Its happening in front of you- they will destroy us from within. And it seems to me facebook and twitter are damn compliant.

@greenteapain @karengeier Constitution gives no rights to illegals. And its not violating human rights to sweep wher they hide them. You should wake up from your delusional world and see that we cant keep@letting immigrants in. There will be overpopulation with the way life expectancy range now.
@Fronterakid @karengeier We do not need any more immigrants. We do not want over population. There is a finite amount of land and resources. Do that even register to you people?? Keep on and there will be another civil war. Letting illegals divide a country is just stupid. Tell them to fix theirs.
@karengeier @CaseySteven7813 @IKaighn Whats wrong with keeping pwople out of a country they illegally came to? You mind canada’s business, not USA’s. You have enough issues up there with muslims.
@karengeier Worry anout canada bitch
@karengeier So now ive cropped your tweet and your webpage. Will be sending it to the palces you claim you have written for. Stay in canada—oh by the way it was founded by europeans as well dear
@karengeier Your a moron. Show me one country that is NOT run by white majority that is actually functional? Not a third world shithole. And hey what about chicago? LA hell any city—the murders are by blacks. Get a grip on your racist self
@TrapMilan @ilikepaola And you condemning her by calling her a slang term for female dogs is basically showing you are no better than her.
@TrapMilan Nothing racist about telling a fat girl she sold her body for kfc.
@callme_mojo @_Carmen_Jones @EvRy1nVzZ @TheMissWare @TrapMilan Whats racist about telling a fat chick she sold her body for kfc?
@katerbrts @mayobabys @GlogloWilliams @Lunsford_Landon @realjb1386 @TrapMilan What is racist about tellin a fat girl she sold her body for kfc?
@ilikepaola @MindOfXTC @ShaunKing Oh Yea i see that in the senate and congress every day. Seems thats all they do is talk..then if and its a big IF they take action there is 99% chance its the wrong one. If you want something done then just do it- no debate necessary
@HermanGutenbur1 @animallama @ShaunKing @LawrenceGridin They all do basically. Corporations and big interest run this country now. And the one big interest that no one seems to be aware of. They are a huge force in the swill we now eat. And governent pays farmers to not grow food. Its terrible what greed has done
@HermanGutenbur1 @animallama @ShaunKing @LawrenceGridin They keep voting in the same people yesr after year. They do nothing anymore- then whoever is president take the brunt of the backlash. Its time to redo the government and this time around we put term limits on senate and congress.
@TriGz__ @tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative I have all 3 xbox versions- but when i was a kid we watched tv togeher as a family not me alone in front of tv with it raising me- bith oarents their to say hey what you see isnt real life- thats wrong, etc etc. i didnt soend hrs alone in fromt of game console. Its linked preston
@TriGz__ @tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative Omg preston its all@of it combined with the lack of famliy unit. Look back over the last 20 years and what has changed that has effect on everyone . Seriiusly look@and think prrston. Im not naive friend.  I watch tv, i played the bery first vid games to ever come out.
@TriGz__ @tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative If it didnt have influence then why do companies soend billions on marketing with TV? For someone with such a low opinion of facts you will of course not take the time to look for yourself
@TriGz__ @tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative Really preston? Donsome research and see how since the 60’s policies put in place have had a detrimental impact on family. Do you think TV or Movies, or music videos jave no influence on a persons judgement? Decision making?
Its funny how people block you when you prove their narrative is wrong by providing real documented facts. Even when youndonsomin a cordial manner. Why cant peope handle the truth? Are lies just easier to believe? #truth #FamilyValues #Constitution #Conservatives
@aDeity2You @ShaunKing Quit voting democratic if you want racism gone. They have done more harm@to black americans than any other group sir.
@11Greengirl @ShaunKing @NastyWomenofNPS @SenSanders Ummmm there were several mass shooyings under obama as well. So out a sock in it
@NicoRiona @bigfranky75 @ShaunKing If you are that scared i cant possible see how you can drive. Since many many many more people are killed in car accidents than mass shootings.
@ilikepaola @MindOfXTC @ShaunKing No amount of talking will fix problems. Action fixes problems. And the issue is the broken family unit. Gun violence glorification in hollywood rap videos and video games
@IamJustinLive @ShaunKing What about the food industry lining the pockets of our government? More people die from obesity complications than any amount of gun violence in every year. Where is the out rage? NRA money is miniscule compared big agriculture and the food industry gives.
@JackCactacus @mjhowrad @ShaunKing What about the food industry marketing? Marketing poison daily. More people die from obesity complications than any amount of gun violence in every year. Where is the out rage? NRA money is miniscule compared big agriculture and the food industry gives.
@dink_182 @ShaunKing @whatevergrandpa Uou do realize that social security is 25% percent of our expenditures right?
@HermanGutenbur1 @animallama @ShaunKing @LawrenceGridin You honestly think democrats are any better than republicans? Seriously?? If you want real change marching on washington in thenmillions (10’s of millions) is the ONLY solution
@tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @TriGz__ @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative People see celebrities as heroes instead of doctors astronauts scientists has warped the minds of people born in last 30-40 years. Why cnat any of younsee the correlation. And the studies that have been done on this and pharma were paid for by the groups those studies concern
@tomkarlo @Hank_Kaufmann @TriGz__ @_brandonjm @daryamakiyenko @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative Omg how delusional can you be? The problem is progressive policies have dstroyed the family unit. Hollywood movies, music videos, video games all glorify gun violence. The rap videos promoting gang glory, violence against women. . Damn it doesnt take a genius to see that.
@_brandonjm @Hank_Kaufmann @daryamakiyenko @tomkarlo @Nutty_Rob @vanmey2000 @ShaunKing @SoFlaNative There will be another civil war if you attempt to take guns away. A civil war that the gun control people will lose.
@krassenstein Shouldnt you and your brother be worrying about the wirefraud case against you? Your a crook and yet you have the gall to spout out this nonsense?
@NancyUr1 @krassenstein Even when they spy on american citizens? When they wont even turn over documemts to the people we elected to over see the country?
@Isa_ichi12 @FLOTUS There will be a civil war again before you take tje guns away. Place the blame where it lies...no family values, social media, hollywood, tv, and video games.
@odaraia @SenFeinstein @PattyMurray @SenatorCantwell Feinstien is a crook..uses her power to make money ...check solyndra connection
@120949 @AnnieLowrey Hispanics at 20%, blacks at 23%, asians, at  5%, native (indian) americans at 24%. So the figures you throw out are baseless. Quit being a sheep and supporting welfare state policies. Do you realize that 25% percent of US budget is for social security? Its not sustainable.
@120949 @AnnieLowrey Then the businesses should be shutdown. Its a crime to hire illegals. Am I correct? And quit deflecting my statements. I know the majority of people gettimg them are white and black. But if you go by percentage of population of said ethnic group whites come in at around 2.4%
@120949 @AnnieLowrey Quit spreading false information. And quit being gullible if you actually believe it. Open your eyes and realize democratic policies have made us a welfare nanny state
@120949 @AnnieLowrey Omg you people and your meme’s. You honestly believe that?? Its roughly 1.8mil a month which granted is slightly higher than obamaswhich was 1.1mil per month and lower thsn GW bush’s which was 2.2 per month. But the point is we do not need to be pay illegal aliens money period
@120949 @AnnieLowrey And how many of those children are from illegal parents? Yea im sure i will get no response
@SomeCallMeCoach @AnnieLowrey It is a solution to most issues. Get a job be responsible and quit thinking the government is there to support you. The central government was NOT created to make america a welfare nanny state. But through democratic policies starting mainly in the 60’s thats what its become
@Reclaimtheflag @real_ctrlaltdel @brianschatz Actually this country was founded by only european countries. Get your facts straight.
@mrs_pinky85 @SIXXCROWS @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku We are on the precipice if not already over the edge of being ruled over by a tyrant. We allow the government to teach our children nonesense. To divide them at an early age. We have got to come to our senses. And see its them dividing for their own gain.
@mrs_pinky85 @SIXXCROWS @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku That division gives them votes. And untill we all come together and march on washing in the millions nothing will chamge. We will be downtrodden more and more. I cant understand why the majority of people are so insulated in their lives that they cant see this.
@mrs_pinky85 @SIXXCROWS @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku Neither party cares about the people. Its about votes and furthering their agendas. We the people have become sheep instead of the shepherds. Government is owned by big business hands down owned! Greed rules their lives along with lust for power. They use the media for division
RT @w_terrence: Can y’all guess which of @NancyPelosi grandkids made the wish to be “Brown” like Antonio? You sound like a #racist &amp; Where…
RT @mrs_pinky85: @Calvintoddsmith @SIXXCROWS @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku We are not unicorns. Blacks very 1st politicians were…
@SIXXCROWS @mrs_pinky85 @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku We split the jobs and wveryone worked together and laughed and str sunday meals together. We were all the same..poor porr and more poor..but there was no animosity that i see now..maybe i just didnt see it or was blinded and couldnt see it. I dont inow but something has to change
@SIXXCROWS @mrs_pinky85 @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku No apology needed.because im dumbfounded by whats going on for last several years. I grew up on a farm out in middle of no where. We had black and white neighbors and i never saw an instance of one  color being treated differently in all that. We killed hogs and hunted together
@SIXXCROWS @mrs_pinky85 @ClarenceWhorley @erinbiba @KamuiHiryoku May i ask you a question sir. Because you just said something i dont see many black americans say.  Liberal policies have done more damage to people than anything imo. Its created a welfare state and people that wont help themselves. Why cant any other people say what u just did?
@Rahman18171230 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Well if you think viting democratic will do tue country better then take a look at hiw democratic sicialist@policies have helped you. Grow the hell up and accept responsibilty for yourself. Quit crying about the past and embrace the future.
@KlassenL @realDonaldTrump He is a global business lman of course he has russian connections. BUT russia did not win his election. People tired of politicians did. Quit being a sheep
@saralynne65 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS No dhs has NOT said our election was compromised
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump And people like you that coomit wire fraud and cheat people out of tgeir money Ed?
@candrewjohnson @mnbfrq @AnneHamilton01 @realDonaldTrump @elonmusk @SpaceX @NASA No he said countries not continent
@AnneHamilton01 @realDonaldTrump @elonmusk @SpaceX @NASA No he is from south africa the shitholes are the countries above that. If you want them here just move to africa and be with them. Much more simple
@agencyorion @ManhattanMango @Rachelv1063 @RenaDescartes @ShafPatel @realDonaldTrump How he fuck is it racist to assume someone is from a country because of theor name? You fucking morons and your racism. Grow a set of balls and quit being so politically correct. It is killng the world. Piss some people off it is good for them.
@EdKrassen @Comey Shouldnt you be getting a lawyer for wirefraud?
@RepAdamSchiff @DRomaround2 And you adam whining about release of memo today but in 2013 you where championing more FISA transparency. You politicians flip flop when it serves you
@krassenstein @DRomaround2 Seems you and your brother should be worrying about the wire fraud case. And you people want to call trump a crook but yet praise two brothers scheming money through ponzi system

@CestlinstantX @suiteplat @IvankaTrump @DONNABELLINI1 I can agree with you on that. I can see eager people allowed in. very small numbers. But there are ideologies that rule certain countries that is in no way compatible with civilization. We cant take a chance on them. Not imo. Nice name by the way..
@CestlinstantX @suiteplat @IvankaTrump @DONNABELLINI1 Look why do we need more immigrants? I mean seriously why? We have a oopulation of 300 million plus. Have you seen how people live in countries that are over populated? And yes this country was built on immigration, bit that was was 2.5 centuries ago. The pace has to slow now
@darkshadow667 @suiteplat @IvankaTrump @DONNABELLINI1 Correct—- now if i create WET station- white entertainment television— it would cause a complete uproar! And i swear the descriptors need to go away— african american?? Seriously unless you lived in Africa before u came to america its idiotic to call yourself african american
@Comey We depend on ourslves. You along with rest of government feed off the people
@bertwilmom You are lying md you know it! Local law does not rule the land federal law does. And your hero obama had immigrants in detention centers. He made an unconstitutional executive order in 2012 and this is the result of that order. Try being an american instead of an elitist.
@THEDEREKisHERE @TxBornSooner @djf510 @adiliamolina @WvTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Derek it doesnt matter who wins any more Our government has become a cess pool of over indulgence and self centered greed We have been sold out to the highest bidder Its not about we the people any more its we the special interest groups Why? Because we became sheep not shephards
@VitoSlice @PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin Yes it was. And i cant see how pwople cant see that. I cant understand why they wont fight to take thier own country back. Hell we fought the british empire with 50% of our forces being regular citizens!
@VitoSlice @PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin Why cant the see the truth Vito? Why is it so hard for them to see that overpopulation will destroy us. There is only a finite amount of space here. Not to mention resources education medical etc.
@FoxNews @POTUS No we need to shut down immigration period! We cant take anymore people. Where you going to house them? Feed them? Employ them? Educated them?
@jpfoster65 Yea we keep letting people in and we will be overpopulated and whole country will be like california. We have a population over 300 million. We cant keep letting more people in. Fix thir own country and do not make mine look like the one you ran from. Geez its simple math
@rmayemsinger Those stores where already in planned stages of closing before tax overhaul. Quit making it look different than it is. People like you are the problem.
@VitoSlice @PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin Lmao..people are replying then blocking me from seeing it. What is up with that? Am i being nasty? im having a conversation. Im not calling names or anything. Why do some people refuse to see the truth??
@VitoSlice @PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin He did because as usual the senate/congress only care about gree and oower and making the other side a scape goat. Surely you see thst. Obama did not legally have the power to enact DACA. Said so himself in 2010 and 2011. Immigratin is congress’ area
@PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin I mean if your from cali ( guessing maybe from name?) then you see the drives of oeople and businesses leaving that stste due to its over crowding no jobs etc. it will happen nationwide if we keep the doors open. They should fix their own country not destroy ours!
@PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin He didnt have the right nor the legality to do it. Its called separation of power. Everyone does not have the born right to be in this country. How will we house them? Employ them? Medical? Education? Seriously how?? We cant over populate our country it will crash
@olgaNYC1211 @PacificBerry @nytimes How could they normalize a president that had ties ties to terrorist bill ayers? Or stuck his swaying opinion in on doj investigstions, or one that lied to wife of slain agent knowing the guns came from their own operation. So quit being a sheep!

She was bills enabler, she tske money from countries and people that view women as non entities and yet you support her. Why? She doesnt give two cents worth of care for you. Quit being a sheep
@Asmi1121 @10MinutesaDay4U Sure their is- cair and other islamic ors will come out crying anti muslim racist blah blah blah so why would they goto the trouble? And it would also further the keep islamics out of US which i believe is what needs to happen. The ideology is not compatible with civilization
@PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin No obama created a two year renewable program. Trump chose not to renew it.  in 2010 and 2011 obama explicitly said he didnt nor did any president have the power to create  immigration law that was congress’s job. BUT he did it anyway in 2012. So id say it was an illegal order
@PacificBerry @mimix3 @NathanHRubin Obama set a time limit on DACA not trump. Why are you blaming him? And obama housed illegals in camps as well. Didnt you know that? https://t.co/182qLgsGBQ                                      https://t.co/sAvJMrT26U
@COACHG13 @NathanHRubin Obama built mew camps during hos terms
@PopularPres2016 @NathanHRubin Do you not realize obama had them in camps long before trump? Damn wuit blaming trump
@ConfoBob @NathanHRubin Obama had them in camps. So dont put this on DT
@raider_deb @NathanHRubin How does a criminal have the same rights as a citizen?
@novablue18 @NathanHRubin Ummmm obama help them in camps as well during 2012-14
@JacquiYoungL @NathanHRubin @oufenix What is not normal? Keeping the law? Not letting people just come here anytime they want? We have natinal borders lady. Try walking into canada, or lol mexico and see where you end up! We cant take everyone. Overpopulation is going to be an issue!
@gili92107 @NathanHRubin What core principles? Immigration was ok at first. But now over population will be issue. Resources are an issue. Hell stamd up and fix your own country and do not destroy ours! End of story. You do not have the right to just come here. Its called national sovereignty
@BrandonSweany @MunchkinFunk @NathanHRubin Why is deporting illegal immigrants such a big deal? Evry countr does it and some do it to the extreme Ex- mexico will lock you up. We cant house feed provide jobs med care for the world. Immigration needs to stop for a while. We have over 300 million people here now.
@NikitaKitty @mataliandy @NathanHRubin @search4swag Lmao you are SO brain washed. You actually think the dems are better? Tou actually think they care about immigrants? How the heck are we going to keep lettimg people come n? How we going to feed them? House them? Classroom space Medical? How? We cant. We already have 300mil peeps
@THEDEREKisHERE @TxBornSooner @djf510 @adiliamolina @WvTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS None
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Omg enough with the racist bullcrsp. You are racist for even saying it you fucking moron
@Neonkenny @DanConrad24 @marianne5280303 @realDonaldTrump Why do you reference people with that nasty word? Have some respect for your ancestors. If it werent for them youd be over in west africa right now being slaughtered. So be thankful you are here
@THEDEREKisHERE @TxBornSooner @djf510 @adiliamolina @WvTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You believe the same polls that said hillary would win. Id say 37 out of fifty states is pretty good.
@TxBornSooner @djf510 @adiliamolina @WvTrump @realDonaldTrump @POTUS One state that has a population of illegal immigrants voted for her more. Which is why why have electoral college. So that one state can run it all
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Fair enough sir
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Joseph do you think we should allow immigration to continue? This is a huge point for me. Its not about not likng people its about ability to keep resources available and money we do not have nor jobs. Democrats only want them here for votes. Its not that they care
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike I know all that Joseph. I am just tired of of it all and i only see one solution but that would require at least 10-20million giving up their time to march on washinton. or a 150 million staying home   And refusing to work to bring change. And people wont do it
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Has to stop. Congress/senate members using their power to financially profit from.  Stripping the rights away daily. Immigration has to stop. All of it Joseph. There are 300 million plus people here. We cant provide for them all. Its time to start over.
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Im sorry Joseph but i see it as both sides doing it everyday and every chance they get. I throw up the past not to deflect trumps transgressions but to hopefully get sheep to have an epiphany and say oh wow yes i see now. Presidential orders side stepping congresses power
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike I am a constitutionalist. And since the 60’s its has been maimed by president after president after president. Congress/senate do nothing but try to make other side look bad. Its time to stsrt over Joseph. We cant let central power to become more powerful than it is now
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike No no no..its both sir. To an equal degree. Tell me where you stand on immigration
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Then how can you sit by and watch these politicians on BOTH sides destroy us? I wont not any longer.
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Lynch pressuring comey isnt abuse of power huh? Firing americorps guy because he was investigating obamas friend because of missing 830,000 bucks isnt abuse. U r a moron
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Lying to slain agents family knowing the truth that guns came from messed up operation ismt abuse of power? Your delusional. My family has been here since 1757 and im telling you that a war is on the horizon you best get your prioties straight friend.
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Dude i just gave u multiple times that he did! How can you say he didmt. The president saying trayvon coulda been my son— you think that didmt sway doj at all? Come on man dont be a sheep
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Lmao you wont get into them because you know nothing about them because you wont look at liberal politicians the same way. But hey its ok for obama’s doj to@pressure fbi but not trump huh?
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike I can go on and on— zimmerman investigation, black panther investigation, firing of americorps investigator, micheal brown investigation,
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike The fast and furious operation. Obama lied to slain agents family about what happened. Thats outright justice coverup. And comey testified that doj lynch pressured him into calling hillary investigation a matter not an investigation thats besides what obama said about it
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike Hmmm lets see...Appointing bossermannto oversee a criminal investigation. Ali fayed captured in Czech but obama said no@to extrsdite and agents protestrd were told not to rock the boat. Tell fbi that hillary’s  emails were just carelessness and in scheme of things not importsnt
@MsBun2 @RLR58 @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike So your mad he wont enforce samctions on russia. But its not ok to enforce immigration laws? Make your mind up. What laws should he enforce and which should he not? Geez you people are so stupid
@Average_Skeptic @mamabearyealey @Imperator_Rex3 @drawandstrike So by your reasoning obama obstructed mamy investigations by doj. Didmt hear you complaining then. And im guessing you believe DACA should happen as well?
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld @nbcsnl Id still like to see them big tits your showing thru that sheer top
@MaxChgo123 @lazedazee @000april000 @Amy_Siskind You are a racist! #racist #blackracist
@ShaunKing You are a racist! #racist #blackracist #StupidPeople
@krassenstein @limajoe2 You mean obamacare. That hasnt been rescinded brian.
@cooldog95228 @JoyAnnReid Yea amd your stste is a cess pool because of liberals and their policies which includes immigration
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld See you cant answer the questions because you think government is there to give you a handout and it is NOT. Thats why they come here because they are too scared to work and make your coumtry great. I will fight again if i have too
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld I have 250 acres a house college education and i served in military from 1987 to 1993 ive gave for my country amd ive worked my whole life. Have u?
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Lmao girl im not a racist. But i dont believe in welfare unless your handicapped not because you have 10 babies by 10 different men/women. Yall use the race card because its easy and keeps people from admitting their own failures in life
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld That was in response to my family benefits that u said. No we dont meams my family..how idls that racist? Damn pay attention or are you to illiterate to comprehend the subject matter?
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld No people that give and give and give them see they cant give anymore and them are called racist is what we do not like.  We cant accept them all. How we feed them? Where will all the food we need come from? Where will the jobs come from? Classroom space? Medical? Where??
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld No we dont. We get nothing except what we work for. I promise you immigration is going to end one way or another. If civil war has to happen@so be it. We cant support everyone wantimg to come. How can you possibly not see that young lady? Look at the numbers and the resources
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Racist? Im tired of the racist card thing and most whites are tired of hearing it. Migration from european countries is what made this country. Need to learn your history
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld My family uas been here for 275years. I will not see my country overtaken by government stupidity. Fix your own coumtry amd leave mine alone.
@limajoe2 @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Yes that was before there were 300 million here. And my family fought to be rid of a tyrant king. So why cant they fight for thier country? We cant support more people. Im sorry but the resources arent available.
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Yes phytoplankton does make most of our oxygen. I was making a point of people not realizing and not caring about the only home we have. If we destroy by pollution and over feeding them we ALL die
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Sigh..i am not sayng helping is wrong. Im saying your energy is better spent educationg your community so they do not have to resort to beimg animals when it crashes in. Make  them see that large like minded groups can survive and be more helpful than as indviduals
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld They do not learn this in school. They learn of names amd places with no critical thinking of the why and how of anything anymore. The dumber the population the easier to control and manipulate.
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld I bet you can not go out anywhere and ask one this one question amd get 10 people out of a 100,000 give right answer. What happens if we cut the rain forests down completely? Answer is end of the world Jungles are the heart of the planet. The purifiers, the westher makers, oxygen
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld How? I can not find a common ground that will make people see the planet is all we have. They will not stand for themselves but will fight over something that the government tells them too or a religious leader tells them to. They for some reason cant see the big picture.
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld I know you will be killed for trying to help. People are animals and their base instincts will resurface when hungry and thirsty. It will be a nightmare the likes of which keep me up at night planning and trying to convince others that its time for revolution across the world
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld I have a large family and large circle of friends that would push the limits of my land. Most of these people are educated. Economists, docotors, scientists you name it we probably have one or two. Im not cld hearted but i know what will happen whem it crashes.
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Do you understand that we should already be living on the moon and mars? We should be harvesting the asteroids and the moons of other planets for our resources. But no we let ideologies and greed run our world. We fight over oil and wealth. Instead of bettering humanity
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld Lmao! You are delusional! Until money is wiped away we will never make the gains in life that we can and should make. Money is the problem. Its tentacles wrap so deeply into what is wrong with the world im mot sure it can be wiped away
@Hawkins110grn @FoxNews @RajShah45 @WattersWorld I dont need a wall. I have 250acres that no one but family and friends will access for food water and living space. So you inner city and suburb peeps deal with it.

@DomelaN @EdKrassen @Amoney666 @GOP Along with the whole Domocratic party. Open your fucking eyes
@PinkeJohn @scmaestra @TrashyChic @NatashaBertrand @maddow Look dude unless ur just stupid.. neither side gives a damn about you or I. And the white thing is starting to get old. Use your fucking brain for once
@PinkeJohn @scmaestra @TrashyChic @NatashaBertrand Democrats do not give a shit about those dreamers either. They just want the votes, period. If those dreamers voted conservative democrats would scream to send them home. I hope you know that.
@cher God id love your lips wrapped around me..
@Monctonsnowman @scmaestra Generations? Daca peeps havent been here for generations
@PinkeJohn @scmaestra @TrashyChic Soooo its more important that those dreams have those jobs over american citizens? Seriously?
@EdKrassen Yea Ed solyndra and the other Obama green initiatives cost tacpayers 2.2 billion. They wer all failures. And Feinstein’s family made a bundle off of solyndra. You sir are dispicable
@jensdatter @jeremyscahill @ShaunKing Do some damn research people! Quit being fed bullshit from your media! Dig into it and see for yourselves. If you have time to be on social media you have time to do some research into your electrd leaders. Its your job to be shepherds of this country, not sheep!
@jensdatter @jeremyscahill @ShaunKing And you will find they all reap huge rewards from business desls they steer towards family owned businesses, or they set up a friend to make huge windfalls from their knowledge of what is going to happen in that area. And tell me why the most powerful (IE-feinstein) arent in jail
@jensdatter @jeremyscahill @ShaunKing Havent any of you noticed how since the 60’s each year less and less is done in congress and the senate? They just try to make the other side look as bad as they can and thats all the media covers and spoon feeds ya. Do some actual research into the senate and congress members
@jensdatter @jeremyscahill @ShaunKing Do you all honestly think either side is any better than the other? They are all corrupt to the core people! Both sides are there for money and power! They are all owned by lobbyists and donors. How the hell can people not see this? Its time disband the crooks and start over.
@jensdatter @jeremyscahill @ShaunKing Lmao at all of you. The media is all propaganda now.  All main media outlets are owned by people with agendas, either they push leftist propaganda or rightwing propaganda. The owners spoon feed you sheep bullshit and most of you swallow it like medicine from a doctor
@kami2thesky @krassenstein You mean 8 years of making the US look weak. 8yrs of apologizing to countries for US dominance. 8yrs of gutting the military. 8yrs of turning america into socialists. 8yrs of letting Islam run wild. Yea thats real love
@LiveinAntwerp @realDonaldTrump So my family has been here 250yrs roughly and you say im a foreigner? Yea ok
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump They did at one time..im not against immigration..but i am against immigration in mass. Im against immigration from countries whose ideology is incompatible with western civilization or basically modern civilization. It will never work. Its proven time and time through history
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump Yes they used too. But now no they do not. Now they consider themselves mexican, haitian, nigerian or whatever before american. And the descriptors assigned doesnt help that mentality. Asian american, african american etc. thats not accurate. If you wanna be american embrace it
@MarkArum  Frack! Frack it!  Via Battlestar Galactica
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump When a group of people stay in one spot they keep same values as the country they came from had.  That causes problems and resentment. American values is what made this country great if people coming here do not have those values then america declines young lady.
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump It seems liberal influence in american education has watered down the facts.  We strictly controlled immigration in the past and it works that way. Lets people assimilate and become american. Mass immigration causes enclaves of people that never assimilate for the most part
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump The us exists due to people standing up to a king. Colonists revolting on a king that sent them there in 1600’s. Learn your history. And again have u been to london?
@EatTweeetRepeat @janetoegel @Carolin17951107 @realDonaldTrump Why dont you support your country? We cant take everyone in and we cant help everyone. Those countries are shitholes due to being robbed by leaders or ideologies. When was last time you were in london? Was tgere in 1990 and 2015. It going downhill because of mass immigration
@TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump There will be a war in this country if he is
@fatimekal @Kedam0no @PamelaGeller Then chapt 17 100-104 should interest you since Muhammed was told that Israel belonged to the Israelites. I mean it plainly says before the last judgement jews will return to their homeland Israel.
@MarkTafolla @krassenstein @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @CNN @CNNPolitics @MSNBC @maddow @ABC @CBSNews @NBCNews Well what about lies from Hillary? DNC, etc..you support teporting those as well?
@MarkArum hell no they better not fire chaney!
RT @PreppersGuide: 'Pioneer' US astronaut John Young, dead at 87 - John Young, a legendary US astronaut who went into space six times, orbi…
@rashidaldosari @nytimes @nytimesworld They are going to accept it. Egyptians arent arabs. Hell before muslims conquests startimg in 6th century, egypt was mostly christian. And for muslims, doesnt the koran say israel belongs to the  israelites- chapter 17 “night journey”
@Free_Somaliweyn @RT_com Why didnt they fight jordanian occupation? Or hell turkish occupation which lasted 400 yrs
@queenwaldorff @Jerusalem_Post They brought occupation upon themselves Hell they were occupied by the turks in 1517 had a chance for a Palestinian state in 1947 but of course the arabs rioted Then attacked israel numerous times from 1948-1967 before israel occupied east jerusalem which was occupied by jordan
@saracen0007 @bongobango555 @AJEnglish That agression and conquering continued until Charlemagne stopped it temporarily in 800. Then it resumed and is what broought the first of the christian crusades about in 1095. Get history right! Islam was violent from it’s very inception!
@saracen0007 @bongobango555 @AJEnglish Your the one that needs a history lesson. In 632 At the time of the muslims beginnings lebanon kuwait iraq syria llebanon spain north africa southeast turkey egypt was predominately Christian By 732 egypt , syria north africa, spain, most of asia minor was lost to muslim conquest
@AJEnglish Egytpians aren’t arab, therefore they can be flexible when they see the big picture.
@sistercrow @realDonaldTrump Again what does this prove? Seriously nothing. Geez read the whole article. They were trying to get dirt on hillary so what?? Dems were doing the same with fusion. Give me a break. I believe russia tried to interfere but there was no collusion
@sistercrow @realDonaldTrump Lmao- again using one sentence from a long article to sway people. Read the whole article! There was no evidence sater had the pull he claimed, times says as much. So he wanted putin to say trump was good for america. That is collusion? Lmao
@LisaMoraitis1 @realDonaldTrump Show the proof that it isnt a hoax. Show mw one thread of evidence that collusion happened.
@seldo @realDonaldTrump Name the evidence. Come on lets hear it. Yea thought so.
@SomRecordsDC @realDonaldTrump America interferes in other coutries election processes all the time. Do you not realize this? If there was collusion it would have been brought forward with charges by now.
@diasporaspear Sigh im not going to argue with you over what your implying. Just show me the so called science of this please. Because to be oppressed you need laws and government support of said laws to oppress people. Racism is real i  know this. But POC are not oprrssed in US or Europe
@diasporaspear Science should always be re examined.  I just want to learn. Face it you are a racist. You have no urge to to do anything but disparage whites.  Its a shame because divided the government owns us
@diasporaspear No victim here. And im pretty well read so id like to see the research your talking about and the ones sponsoring the research
@diasporaspear There is no oppression. And NO racism is not ok at all.  But you seem ok with it as long as it is directed to whites
@InLibdingColor @AsteadWesley HRC is one of the reasons we are still having to deal with NK
@diasporaspear You moan and gripe about how things keep you down. When itnis your attitude that does it.  Fix the issues within your community. Tell women not to have kids by six different dads tell men to quit beimg lazy ass bums and take care of their families.Thats black and white men/women
@diasporaspear I dont need anything. But you are the epitome of racist. You blame others for past mistakes and your problems of today. when in actuality the problem lies in your own house. You are the one that does nothing to change your future. Dont blame others for the mistakes you make
@diasporaspear Racism isnt same as oppression which is what we are talking about. And you should get educated on the difference. People like you are the problem because you offer no solutions
@SodomWhoson @diasporaspear it is exactly how i think. It is you whom should come forth from@the basement
@diasporaspear White people as you say it, meaning european peoples am i correct? They came to top of the world and conquered alot of lands and yes did awful things..that is in the past. You are not oppressed in the US and most european countries at this time in history.
@KingCEO_sopoco @reganxleighx @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame.
@funder @KingCEO_sopoco How is it treason? If we had of had leadership in late 80’s and early 90’s north korea would be a nn factor. Your more worried about our president saying hia button is bigger than the millions of starving, brain washed people in north korea?
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB I believe and teach my child that people are people with same needs wants and dreams There are major problems in the US and letting the media pimp out hot button issues and wording them to incite division needs squashed You never get the whole story just the decisive part.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB By conveniently labeling a person a racist by them being opposed to actions or beliefs of someone of a different race is the true definition of racial stereotyping.  Which means no matter the sociopolitical forces whites experience racism just as much.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB In other words, a racist asshole is a racist asshole…no matter how much melanin they were born with. Everytime a person of lighter skin has a beef with an action of someone with darker skin that lighter skinned person is labeled a racist immediately!
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB Sometimes it can more serious, such as someone refusing to hire you or not giving you a promotion, cops profiling solely on skin color. When your treated like crap because of your race, thats racism but not systemic oppression.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB Racism does not require systemic oppression to occur It happens in day to day interactions usually in subtle ways that rarely affect our lives or our state of mind A glare here a nasty word there, someone cutting you off in traffic they can but aren’t always be motivated by race.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB There can definitely be race based systemic oppression but there are no laws keeping a black man yellow man green man whatever color man from doing anything at all in the US. Now racism is another story, there is definitely racism in America, and its not just whites.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB Do you even know what systemic oppression is? Apartheid is sytemic oppression. Why? Because it is enforced by laws backed by he government. Lookng at someone different because of the amount melanin in their skin is racism, not systemic oppression. They are different things.
@reganxleighx @KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB Explain Regan? If you want a debate on this then,  i am definitely your huckleberry.
@lpolgreen In the inner cities you are right, on their back making babies to get a check. Call me a liar and i will make you look stupid with facts. Its time for people to take on the inner city nightmare- and liberal policies caused the nightmare
@LazialeaNY @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB Nope wont happen. People let hot button issues stir them and divide them and thats what keeps us down.
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB If you want change like i do..then we have to march on washington en mass. Like millions of us or we might as well sit at home. But the division amongst us wont allow that to happen. Im not your enemy most people arent your enemy. The damn crooks in charge are thr enemy
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB I have falls on deaf ears You have to see the light the media which is the government propaganda machine put up stories and words them in a way that just causes division among us You have to see that sir. If we dont stop it they will eventually tell us when to eat sleep and shit.
@diasporaspear Quit acting like a damn victim. You have as many rights as i do. Grow the fuck up and stop the race card bullshit. U wanna stop something stop blacks from killing blacks every hour of every day. nothing to say on that huh? I didnt own slaves, you werent a slave so grow up
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB Why? Because like you i was born in america. Im american, not european american, not asian american not african american just american, just like you. You are not african american, you are american. Stop using descriptors that do not describe honestly
@CheckOutMyMelo Less than are killed yearly by black on black crime. Stop living in the past and concentrate on your future. It would be more productive
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB Its time to regroup. Its time to come together as a people, and sir there is only one race in this planet, its called human. Time for all the petty in the past shit stop. Cuz the government has us by the balls and i for one am tired of it. But as long as we have division they win
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB Tell these young white and black males that the life of an uneducated person isnt worth shit. Quit spending money on bullshit and organize in the city to get the damn schools under control. Every democrat has promised to help but have they? No they just shove a monthly check at u
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB I for one am tired of the race card beimg played. You want to fix things then stop men/women  from having umpteen kids by umpteen men/women just to collect money. See that is the issue. Grow the fuck up and quit acting like a victim. Stop that inner  city bullshit
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB Hell why dont you go into chicago, atlanta, detroit, etc and stop the black on black violence? Yea no voice on that huh? Its always the white man huh? Go back to west Africa and see how well you like it. See if u can protest..lol see if u can drink the water.
@datniggaFa @JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB I like America. Its funny how people claim racism anything white now. Seems ironic that the racists call others racist. If you want to make thungs better quit voting democrat. They have done nothing but exacerbate problems. They want to hand out money but no solutions.
@LazialeaNY @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB https://t.co/Pq6YwUnans
@MrDirkMcQuickly @angelmouse4 Same goes for you peewee herman. If you wanna argue the point,not the grammar issues,  I’m your man. If not then shut the fuck up.
@angelmouse4 If all you have is grammar phobia then fuck u. You got the point and it was spot in. If you would enjoy debating it, im definitely your huckleberry.
@JTRJules You need to be pissed but not at just gop or trump. Do you sincerely believe the left is any better? Seriously? Its the progressive policies started by johnson that have put black americans in the hole. They hand mainey to them for a vote but give no solutions. Thats a fact!
@JTRJules @willgriffinnig @ShawnHayes_Real @JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB If you think younwill have a better life in egypt, china, bolivia, mexico then please move and see how you like it. Quit blaming coos and using race card to cover for criminals. They were disturbing peace at 2:30am! Coos found pot and cocaine in plain view after smeeling the pot
@JMcJohnson @_youngloco @Joe_V_ @kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB This happened because it was 2:30am and the were shooting fireworks disturbing neighbors Police came and the odor of marijuana was heavy When they searched they found pot and cocaine in plain view along with semi-automatic weapons in plain view Its predominately a white area also
@kathleenhussein @TyishaWSB It is a largely white area 70% to be exact. 16% black 14% asian.
@KingCEO_sopoco @mihduncan @Elfman57 @TyishaWSB BLM is a racist organization. DeRay is as racist a person as you will ever meet. If you think blacks are still in midst of systemic racism then you are completely delusional. How about putting the blame where it belongs for once. The people committing the crimes. Geez
@ou97cpa @baker_mayfield6 Not knockin baker cuz he is a hoss..but in context of the 36yr comment Aikman was as good or better

@Ellis19Johnny @OURoadWarrior @Sooner_Source Winning the rose bowl and going to a national championship game makes one overly excited and prone to grammatical errors.

@804StreetMedia @realDonaldTrump Lol butnyou believe the liberal lies and support their policies, correct? Ploicies that hbe sone more damage to black americans than@any other. They tell u what u want to hear to get your vote. It started with Johnson in the 60’s. They kept you bundled and down trodden
@1987Exoticness @TheCrowbar09395 @scodogno @jogibwa @JerryKeirns @ttrestler @Pollueloenfuego @realDonaldTrump Stupid? So your one of the let everyone come to America people? And for your info, im pretty certain you would lose a battle of the wits. But you keep on letting others think for you you.
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump Your delusional Ed. We wanted change and we got it finally a non politician. And you sheep go crazy because he is unscripted. Makes me laugh at how many globalists there are in America. How soon you forget you in a minority with ur opinion. But u keep believimg you arent

@ciccio4188 @RonestesRon @dcexaminer Ues they, trans-jordan at the time, invaded on 1948 AFTER there had been a two state solution agreed to by israel and the arabs riot of course. Then jordan annexed it in 1950 and world doesnt go ape shit. Israel invades east jerusalem in 1967 after mamy attacks and world shits
@JasonHalle Bottom line- we have to march on washington in the millions. I mean by the 10’s of millions. Other wise it will garner no results.
@JasonHalle Button topics and get viewers/readers.  They all slant their stories to make one-side or the other look bad. Half the couuntry wants this the other half this. We are too PC. We care more about stars., sports figures, and our standing on social media than we do about the truth
@JasonHalle We become shepherds instead of sheep. How to do that Ron? Hell i don’t know.  We the people are so divided now. And for the love of all do not put that division on trump and gop its not a fair judgement. We are divided because of the media Ron. They are there to push the hot
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews But we have to stop what goes on in wahington. Them fools think they are untouchable. Amd they do NOT care about you and i anymore. We have forgotten to be shepherds and become sheep. We care more about sports tv and fb than the running of our nation. It has to stop
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews As i said i have no answers. It would incense hatred im sure. But why does no one try to stop the violence in big cities? I mean you see the race baitors jackson sharpton d eray mckesson come out when a white kills a black bit they are silent on the everyday muder of black men
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews I listen to it everyday from co workers. Stories of growing up in inner city conditions. I do not have answers except that divided we are conquerable but united we are unstoppable. I cant wrap my head around the differences and the perceptions of politicians from people
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews I can design your network from top down and bottom up. I can write novels and write poetry. BUT i am a hillbilly at heart. I can live from the land and never look at a store or i can stay in the city and enjoy art culture and theater. Im me and if that is peasant so be it
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews Peasant? Seriously? I live like i want why? Because i grew up poor, i gree hard scrabble. I joined the military and served for 6 years 87-93. I got out and get edumacated at one local college and two universities in the state of georgia. But i will never forget my roots
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews If the pigmentation of skin divides us. I think the real dividing part is hearing day in and day out how bad whites are. Every day i wake up and hear white privilege white privilege. Im sick of it and so are millions of others. Were is the privilege? Please id like to see it
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews What you do not get is people are tired of the race card bullshit. You are no more oppressed than i am.  History is history thats it. Let die but remember the reasoning behind it. Don’t let hate for past transgressions fuel your goals. Its time for a reckoning and it cant happen
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews U judge a book@by the cover? Isnt that the epitome of racism?
@poohalva @AlbertJ03 @FoxNews Were u born in america? Ever serve in military? If not shut the fuck up
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews And if you think you have it bad here, go back to west africa and see how you like that. And you will see again your own people will sell your ass back into slavery just as they did in the 17th-18th centuries. Dont keep picking at a sleeping gaint my friend.
@AlbertJ03 @poohalva @FoxNews Our progression? Who is our? The south believed in states rights that couldnt be swept aside by federal overreach. That simple. And from looks of things its going to happen again..with much different outcomes. and so that you know, the military is hugely populated by southerners
@JasonHalle Thats not true. In bill clinton’s administration alone there were 4 convictions of democrats. Its foing to be about a 50/50 split. When will you people wake up and realize both sides of the aisle is completely crooked and could care less about america and its people
@kurteichenwald Well thats because they are the problem that needs to be gone. Both sides of the aisle. And if you for a minute think one side is better than the other your in a fantasy world. Its time to rid ourselves of all of them and start over.bit that takes commitment from we the peoplw
@LivLife_Write @deniseasamoahx @faguettte @tanamongeau Oh shut the fuck up correcting ok? Transgendered neutered same fucking thing. and honestly its bullshit. You are born man or woman and thats what you are supoosed to be. Quit believing the liberal psychologists and wasting resources
@victoriangraham @faguettte @starbakhs Exactly!!!
@ISTANGRETHAN @faguettte One has been around for ever and the other is just created due to the fact that people are stupid. .0025% of the population forcing their views on everyone and the PC police enforcing it
@KnitWiseMLP @StuporAndy @faguettte @prfm4lyf OMG your either a man or a woman. If your born with a dick your a man, if your born with a vagina your a woman. All this bullshit to accommodate .0025% of the population is a fucking joke. Get a life and quit forcing this bullshit on the majority
@jesusisgroovier @FoxNews Lol feels really stupid now.
@Edgutk @riseandresistny You need to wake up. People like you are the ones destroying america. God you people are so stupide
@catcatdean @dr_jhbowers @riseandresistny @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @CNN @CNNPolitics Lmao at mueller getting closer. You are living a pipe dream
@damiangm1974 @FoxNews That race card thing is getting really old. About as old as the war that statue represented as a remainder of a terrible history. If you want to pull the race card use for the liberal policies that said a woman who had a child got a check as long as no man was in the house.
@B9lyEquivocal @FoxNews Why do you call people african american? Why set apart? Ifnthey were born here then shouldnt it just be american? Why use a descriptor that is all essence a lie. If they perceive themselves as more african than american, maybe it is time for those that do to move to west africa.
@LepusPunk @joeybeitel23 @FoxNews Traitors? Non of you truly understand how United STATES of America was established do you? You learn no real history today. You leanrn specified and truly cherry picked facts with no critical thinking or the whole underlying reason why those cherry picked facts occurred.
@poohalva @AlbertJ03 @FoxNews Traitors? They fought for their state against centeal government overreach. You need to learn history. Slavery was a catalyst but not the overpowering reason. And if the south had of had as many factories as they do today, outcome would have been much different.
@TimTweetless @clubodaddy @FoxNews Lmao at fighting to own slaves. The school system is such a joke now. It was about states rights versus central government over reach. You know seems everyone forgets we are the United STATES of America. Yes slavery was the catalyst but it was much deeper than just that.
@jesusisgroovier @FoxNews That isnthe most moronic thing I’ve ever heard. Forgetting mistakes means repeatimg them over and over. History is a guide of what to do or what not to do. Why in the hell would you wanna forget?
@SladeMendenhall @EWErickson Britain took that aree over in 1917 after what 483yrs of Ottoman rule And GAVE the arabs a chance for two states in 1947 and israel was agreeing and what happens the arabs riot as always. So they have been the issue this whole time Why didnt they riot when jordon invaded in 1948!
@kevintripp @EWErickson No he made a choice. That choice needed to be made. If UK wants to disgree with that choice that is their perogative. We do not have to agree with what everyone else wants nor do we have to go along with it. Finally we have someone with enough intestinal fortitude to say it.
@GuyEndoreKaiser @nikkihaley America is tired of sending money to other countries that then condemn everything we do. So if u want to hate on the US just leave. See how well you fare in egypt or bolivia
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump Its time to wake up and realize unless we fix the inner city issues which again are controlled by liberals Cant you see thier policies do not work. Its time for women to quit having 10 kids by 5-6 fathers There is no sense of family or community and that is blak and white problem
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump They never followed through but started giving handouts and that has destroyed American way of life. Everything is divided down racial lines now and for the most part its people like Al Sharpton, Jesse jackson that keep it going. You think them fools care about you?
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump What has gotten better? Seriously what? There are more destitute blacks now than there ever was previously. There are more blacks killing black today than then. See they passed that to get your vote. But yet they intentionally crafted it so no change was really done to situation
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump Its time to quit beimg PC to the world. We led the world in every aspect until progressive policies took hold in our schools and daily life. Again progressive policies has made you and slaves again. I can prove it. After johnson signed civil rights act and voting act in 64
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump No the world understands we have a leader that will not put america last and other countries first. It has a leader that sees the issues and isnt going to be PC about them. If you had the balls you be saying something about chicago, detroit atlanta. Blacks killin blacks daily
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump Everyone wants to blame white americans for everything now Thats bullshit and you better get a off it or its going to get bad. You want respect them stand the fuck up and tell black fathers to be men instead of piss ass inner city thugs and quit blaming white people for ur issues
@TalbertSwan @thetrumpwatcher @realDonaldTrump No america should be ashamed for letting the progressives set the country back 100years with their racist policies Do you even have the power to actually read what progressive policies has done to the black community? Not to mention the rest of the country?
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Do u know for a favt he is a traitor? If not then you shouldnt spread rumors. If u want to believe everything you hear from he media go ahead its ur right and ur stupidity.
@1945rkn @realDonaldTrump No he made sure those coutries understood america is not the push over everyone came to see us as for 8yrs before him. Studies show coutries decline when they uave weak leaders..europe is prime example.
@janetheimlich @realDonaldTrump Everything the media says is propaganda for one side or the other. Tell me, do you think America is best country on earth?
@WastedTime240 @realDonaldTrump Lol you think he embarrasses? The 8yrs before him saw almost everybworld leaser see the US as weak and not willing to confront them. That has changed. They may not like the stance he takes but they respect the fact that he isnt a pushover.
@lsarsour  if you believe islam is so rightous why are you not with your #Palestinian brethren helping them? Oh yea i forgot, tour fake and comfortable with yournoower water, internet and cable. Oh and your little band of followers who will soon see you as the snake you are
@lsarsour you are not a feminist. You are not a feminist. You are an enabler of men that abuse women. You want islam to rule then you need to move to an #Islamic country and see how well your marches go. See how they take your activisim Linda.  #Jihadists #Muhammadsucks

@benshapiro True
@Partisangirl That picture is from like 2009 in an israeli settlement called havat gilad and its actually an israeli settler being pulled by two factions one trying to keep him the other trying to take him away. After they were stopped from moving mobile home into settlement
@tribelaw @Doc987654 How can you not see it? There is enough corruption on both sides to warrant a complete overhaul. You wanna take to the streets over it? Shit the country down? Im game..BUT it will be about the whole system. NOT party bullshit. They all deserve to go and lets start over
@tribelaw @Doc987654 Think or know? Seems everyone keeps breaking this down along party lines. When the common ground is staring everyone in the face but they wont acknowledge it. The whole governmental system is broken. Both sides are crooked and only there for greed and power. BOTH SIDES WHOLE GOV
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Thinks you have the wrong idea..im beholden to no deity....i like science
@kweaghington @EdKrassen I hate no one and i know that their is only one race upon this planet. I do not spread hate or lies. But i will not submit to an ideology like Islam ever.
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Islam means submit! Submit to god. If you want to believe in a religion that treats women as slaves and beings with no say so@in anything you go ahead
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Omg ...all about peace by the sword maybe. Submit to Allah or else is basically the gist of the whole book. Any non muslim is an inferior being, an animal.
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Open minded? Open minded about what? We accepted him into country and then he tries to kill us few years later. Im pretty open minded but not at expense of plain sight truth. If an immigrant will not try to assimilate then that is a bad thing. It only causes issues down the road
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Seems he was upset over israeli actions last fee days so he tries to hurt us citizens. Until tou actually read the koran and actually visit a muslim country you cant tell me anything. Their ideology will never get along with western culture
@kweaghington @EdKrassen Your naive little girl
@kweaghington @EdKrassen He had lived here 7yrs. And obviously had no intentions of assimilating into this country. He came in on an family visa-F4 visa to be exact. So he came in around 2010 which would be two yrs after obama was elected. when he pushed for visa increases
@akatinydancer1 @EdKrassen So everyone has a right to come to the US at anytime they like to work or live?
@sarihan69 @Israel @IsraelMFA @IsraelinSpanish @IsraelRussian @IsraelPersian @usembassyta @IsraelinUSA @USAmbIsrael @Jerusalem_Post First of all. There is no palistinians. They are Arab. Secondly they have had many chances for a stste but yet they will not accept.  First time was in 1947– but again they rioted. And YES it is a muslim -jewish thing.
@sarihan69 @Israel @IsraelMFA @IsraelinSpanish @IsraelRussian @IsraelPersian @usembassyta @IsraelinUSA @USAmbIsrael @Jerusalem_Post Why can you not accept jewish people?
@tkdmike @malialavender @funder @realDonaldTrump You have no clue what you are talking about. You offer no words so there can be no dialogue. Without dialogue there can be no solutions. With no solutions there can only be misery, anger, and misguided actions
@sarihan69 @Israel @IsraelMFA @IsraelinSpanish @IsraelRussian @IsraelPersian @usembassyta @IsraelinUSA @USAmbIsrael @Jerusalem_Post Where are u from if i may ask
@sarihan69 @Israel @IsraelMFA @IsraelinSpanish @IsraelRussian @IsraelPersian @usembassyta @IsraelinUSA @USAmbIsrael @Jerusalem_Post Im sure this isnt all but i do believe the blame falls on both sides. Jews have been slaughtered throughout history. Im sorry you cant accept them as a people.                                            https://t.co/PHoQYgUb30
@sarihan69 See it hasnt ever belinged to you...its belonged to canaanites jews,romans, turks, british, and now again isreali’s. So its time for arabs to grow up and stop letting cartoons upset them into rioting. Muslims do not run the world and never will
@sarihan69 @Israel @IsraelMFA @IsraelinSpanish @IsraelRussian @IsraelPersian @usembassyta @IsraelinUSA @USAmbIsrael @Jerusalem_Post Why do u not accept Israel as a State/country? And do you accept palistine as a country?
@caliwildflowers @hersheydenise1 @BussmanMuriel @realDonaldTrump @DeplorablesShow How exactly did trump make it easier for mentally ill to get weapons? And how did he cause death be recognizing a city as the capital of the country it is within? See you are spreading lies and that gets no one anywhere. Stick to the truth it will be easier on u
@DonnaPoore5 @Crazyginny @funder @olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump Oh really. Well if its so safe how about moving there and helping our counrty dispose of the loonies
@JacobLabe @charm__8 Exactly! Jordan invaded in 1948 then annexed it soon after no outrage then huh? Israel took it in 1967 after years of being attacked by arab countries. Even 1880 the jewish population was twice that of arab in jerusalem. Countries of the world had consulates in jerusalem then
@DaysofPalestine Yes when muslims kill or attack its ok cuz well they were offended. Rolls my eyes. Time for islam to grow up or be shut down
@DaysofPalestine How did he make war on palistinians? See thats a blatant lie. He recognized a city as a capital of the country it resides in. Arabs lost it in 1517 when the turks invaded. Turks lost it in 1917. Brits tried to seperate it into to states- palistine and israel. Arabs rioted so..
@DaysofPalestine Seem arabs teach kids to hate jews
@DaysofPalestine https://t.co/FCN1mgOLUx                      	                                                           https://t.co/FhQ0LaNiIo
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump You cant win by activism unless a group that large actually comes together. See people are used to being taken care of now. They like their tv and their social media and their big box stores and god forbid that routine is interrupted. It will take millions people to make a change
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump No maam not even remotely. But until at least 3-5million come together and march on washington nothing will change. We only get a select few candidates to vote for and they are all worthless last few decades. So until washington is over run by us, nothing will change. Ever
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump The. Why did cnn and msnbc fact check trump but didnt climton. Surely that is not ethically the thing to do. Bottom line is this our government on bot sides of aisle and down the middle is corrupt. They all are only about greed and power. They only try to make the other look bad
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump Omg they are all owned by billionaire investures with either a left or right agenda
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump So raising the countries debt by 9 trillion in 8yrs is gutting, correct?
@Almaz001 @TheGovernor84 @StardomRicha @AJEnglish They did and it onlt matched some lebanese
@Almaz001 @TheGovernor84 @StardomRicha @AJEnglish No tge canaanites were not arabs
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump Cnn msncbc fox they are all the same. And id imagine im probably more educated than u. Statistically that would be the case
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish I like being able to have a converstion with someone who doesnt call names and insult when they arent agreed with. Thank you for that
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish There is only one race on this planet as i see it, the human race only differences is pigmentation and unfortunately religion and ideologies. People cant see we all have same basic needs and wants. The world’s governments are all corrupt and only care about money and power
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish I agree to a degree about your statement. If we would spend resources on science and bettering ourselves instead of on war and things that are used in war..we would have colonized mars the moon and whole solar system now. Instead of fightimg over land on this rock
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish No you dont understand the history. There were Never any arabs in this land until 640ce. It was never palistine, thats a perversion of the word Philistine. Im not bashing muslims but you know its true if they are offended they burn riot and pillage
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish Until people stand up say enough of this tiptoeing around muslim sensibilities there will never be peace. And if you are an Atheist  how can the bible have predicted what would happen centuries upon centuries before it happened? Seriously whether u believe or not Just read it
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish There were even consulates from other countries there as well. i do agree its a complete atrocity so many are maimed and killed over a soot of land but the problems a caused by both sides- “we will sweep the jews into the ocean” Azzam Pasha head of Arab League 1947 quote
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish What about the generations and generations of jews that lived there and  that was massacred since time immortal, by the egyptians, romans, turks, arabs. Did you know that eevn in 1860-80 the jewish population of jerusalem outnumbered the arab population 2-1
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish Why do 1.5 billion people get to cause so much strife for the other 5.5 billion in the world? Why do we have to hold our breath and god forbid say anything that might upset the muslim world population? Why is that ok? And why is it ok israel is lambasted constantly?
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish Where was outrage in 1917 when brits took control from turks whom had invaded and controled area since 1517? Brits controlled ot and decided to give boths arabs and jews states but as i said before muslims rioted and burned.
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish Then almost all arab nations attack israel and jordon invades esst jerusalem in 1948 and annexes it. Then they lost it in 1967 to israel whom had been attacked multiple times over the years between. Seems fair israel keeps its just as jordon did and every other country in history
@akatinydancer1 @AJEnglish First of do you even know the history of the area? Because the comment seems to indicate otherwise. There was a chance in 1947-48 for a two state solution that everyone agreed upon except of course muslims. They rioted and pillaged and so plan was shelved
@TheGovernor84 @StardomRicha @AJEnglish How so? Why do you believe arabs have the right to be their?
@AmarAlHtharia Do you even know the history there? Funny how jordan  annexed part or jerusalem then evicted all jews and razed all synagogues and world said ok. Israel recaptures it in 1967 and world has a fuckin meltdown. Hypocritical at the very least.
@AmarAlHtharia @wurzel260654 @Akfazz47 @Isramitch @AJEnglish Oh really? Seems arabs can only trace their roots their from 640ce. Id say that was many centuries AFTER Abraham
@AmarAlHtharia @wurzel260654 @Akfazz47 @Isramitch @AJEnglish Bot
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump Well first off i do not watch mainstream broadcasts. Secondly this the evil side of history? Didnt realize history had an evil side. Thirdly do you nelieve the left is any better than the right? Seriously, so you? The left is just as corrupt, greedy, and power hungry as the right
@JeanMarcV @olgaNYC1211 @funder @RepWillBailey @realDonaldTrump Ummmm bot?  Seems thats what everyone says when they hear what they do not like
@kikilea_kiki @funder @micklirish @realDonaldTrump No all of this is fact that muslims will never accept israel. Both palistians and jews could have had states in 1947-48 jews agreed to plan and arabs rioted and burned and plan was scrapped. Its time for muslims to grow uo
@lizlogan76 @funder @realDonaldTrump There were negotiations in 1947. With a two state plan butnof course the arab islamics rioted and burned and the plan never got implemented. So they have only themselves to blame
@LauzetaVentador @funder @realDonaldTrump What consequences? Some mad muslims? Why do we hold our breath everytime we might offend their sensibilities? Seriously why do they get special treatment in that regard? Did you know that even in 1860-89 period jews outnumbered arabs two to one almost in jerusalem?
@soleilbrille18 @funder @realDonaldTrump So he recognizes a city as capital that the country its in has always said it was capital and that gives islamists the right to start violence? The whole world holds its breath anytime muslims might be offended. Time for them to grow up and get the fuck over themselves.
@malialavender @funder @tkdmike @realDonaldTrump Lmao have u even been reading the news last couple of weeks? Things dont look so good for mueller
@MakeANoteOfThat @funder @realDonaldTrump Ur worried about millions on a move when the left rose the national debt by trillions over last 8yrs?
@Crazyginny @DonnaPoore5 @funder @olgaNYC1211 @realDonaldTrump U think europe will be safe in three yrs? There will be even more islamists there by then.
@Paddysgirl5 @funder @realDonaldTrump We were laughing stock@of world under obama
@vtaylor9188 @funder @realDonaldTrump U r a moron if u think that will happen. Dems have done more to curtail civil liberties than any party. you so blindly follow the sheep
@JeanMarcV @olgaNYC1211 @funder @RepWillBailey @realDonaldTrump Where has it been reported? Show the reports...yea thats what i thought
@Toffinatortoff @Dozingstocks @OceanBreeze1977 @LaChicaCleavest @funder @realDonaldTrump There were more jews in jerusalem in 1860-80 than arabs and there were consulates from across the world in jerusalem in that time period as well. Hell its changed hands 44 times throughout recorded history..
@Toffinatortoff @Dozingstocks @OceanBreeze1977 @LaChicaCleavest @funder @realDonaldTrump Hmmm..seems there have been jees there as long as time remembered. And it seems the world was ok when britian took control of land after tuks lost it in 1917..but israel takes control of it in 1967 due to being attacked multiple times from 1948 till then and world has meltdown
@LaChicaCleavest @Dozingstocks @funder @OceanBreeze1977 @realDonaldTrump World leaders had a plan in place in 1947 but as usual the arabs rioted and revolted so it never got put into place. Why does 5.5 billion have to hold their breath when something might upset 1.5 billion. Time for islam to grow up
@KareemFarid @realDonaldTrump @USUN @nikkihaley They were supoosed to have their land along with the jewish people no later than october 1, 1948 but arams rejected the division and rioted so it was never implemented. They didnt want Jews to have their own state and wanted to “sweep them into the ocean”—Azzam Pasha arab league
@paul_collier1 @isupportisrael_ @TRobinsonNewEra @rogerwaters @OwenJones84 @yankifarber @kishkushkay @redbrasco @coinabs @ThisIsPalestine @israel_shield @BDSmovement And everyone is up in arms. Out of all the rulers since Mamluks only the jewish people truly have roots there. Part of that land for centuries upon centuries
@paul_collier1 @isupportisrael_ @TRobinsonNewEra @rogerwaters @OwenJones84 @yankifarber @kishkushkay @redbrasco @coinabs @ThisIsPalestine @israel_shield @BDSmovement There was a jewish population majority in jerusalem even in 1880 and there were consulates from other countries in jerusalem at that time! So you go from land being ruled from Constantinople (istanbul today) to being ruled from Britain to now Israel.
@paul_collier1 @isupportisrael_ @TRobinsonNewEra @rogerwaters @OwenJones84 @yankifarber @kishkushkay @redbrasco @coinabs @ThisIsPalestine @israel_shield @BDSmovement Israel is attacked several times, unprovoked, and were about to be attacked again in 1967 when they preemptively attacked and gained control of eastern Jerusalem and more. But the world isnt ok with them keeping land they win in WAR. Seem hypocritical to me.
@paul_collier1 @isupportisrael_ @TRobinsonNewEra @rogerwaters @OwenJones84 @yankifarber @kishkushkay @redbrasco @coinabs @ThisIsPalestine @israel_shield @BDSmovement The british are given control..now the world was ok with that land being kept i mean it was won in war right? Brits  hold it until dividing it up giving palistinians and jewish their own land..israel is attacked basically the moment they announced it!!
@paul_collier1 @isupportisrael_ @TRobinsonNewEra @rogerwaters @OwenJones84 @yankifarber @kishkushkay @redbrasco @coinabs @ThisIsPalestine @israel_shield @BDSmovement First off in “recent” history turks took over that land in 1517 from Egyptian mamluks. Even at that time there jewish settlements in #jurusalem that had never left from time immortal. Its history read it. Back to the point. Turks rules until they lost that land to the allies
@Muckingfoggy @AJEnglish @popianwar1 So you tell me why after being ruled by turks since 1517, and turks got their land taken after WW1 after losing to allies and world was ok..but Israel takes a little land after being attacked multiple times and its being criticized and ostracized? Hypocritical world.
@Muckingfoggy @AJEnglish @popianwar1 And was going to be attacked again had they not made a preemptive strike. Seems everyone was ok when britain got control of the area in 1917 . They divided it to where #Israel and Palestinians each had their land and what happens?? Israel is attacked as soon as it was announced
@Muckingfoggy @AJEnglish @popianwar1 So, Recoginizing a city as the capitsl, that is aready considered to be the capital by the country it is located within, is breaking international law?  why should israel give up land that it took after neing attacked unprovoked by many times by arab countries before 1967?
@hammad2090 @EdKrassen Palistinians had a chance for a state in 1947-48 but of course said no and arabs attacked
@juanmedina237 @EdKrassen No president has ever recognized it. 4 have said they would during their respective campaigns but never follwed thru
@fnpcaz97 @EdKrassen He won election so id say he united a fee million then
@Real_JohnQ @EdKrassen And palistinians had a chance in 1947-48 to have their own lands but NO they attack
@Real_JohnQ @EdKrassen They were attacked the moment they were declared a country by every arab country surrounding it. They were going to be attacked in 1967 before they preemptively attacked egypt. That area had been under turk rule since 1517 up to end of WW1. Then brits got it.they divided it
@juanmedina237 @EdKrassen Moron..israel has always claimed Jerusalem as their capital.
@juanmedina237 @EdKrassen He recognized it as the capital mor
@EdKrassen First of all do you even know the history of that area...i will give u a break..just the history since 1517..
@funder The world is afraid of upsetting muslims due to there propensity towards violence. you always want to blame the person for the cartoon, or article or their beliefs instead of blaming an ideology of violence, the ideology that women are inferior, and the ideology of non acceptance
@funder Seems to me you would put the blame were it belongs on muslim clerics. So what if say iran didnt reconize washington dc as capital of US? But atlanta or san fran instead.. would that give us the right to riot, torch, amd kill innocents? No it wouldnt and it wouldnt happen here
@funder Geez all of you are such dimwits. Why blame him if violence erupts? At no point didnhe denigrate a group of people or individual. He said what he believes and yet everyone will blame him when the violent muslim  population burns and riots in streets
@MintMania2DX @rjlaya @JuddLegum @joncoopertweets No, It doesnt count in a court of law if no records were found that said the mall banned him. Your opinion and my opinion only matter to us as individuals.
@MintMania2DX @rjlaya @JuddLegum @joncoopertweets No records were found of that at mall. Im not defending him. I was just saying in ocent until proven guilty. There isnt one single person in our government that i trust to donthe right thing. They do not care about the people. They care about the almighty dollar and power
@IfatokunAwolola @Resistance_Feed @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP You do not think Jerusalem should be capital of Israel? Why?
@canelli_lisa @JuddLegum @rezaaslan And until a few million of us really stand together it will only get worse. We went past a pivot point in the 60’s it is too late to vote in the right people because the media’s propaganda for both sides is believed by the masses. Its like no critical thinking is done by us.
@canelli_lisa @JuddLegum @rezaaslan I have lost all faith in our government period. It all about greed, power, and making the other side look bad. Nothing gets done on either side. You or i do not matter to them. You have to see that. Its time for a change a big big change.
@canelli_lisa @JuddLegum @rezaaslan No i want an answer. Do you think she is honest
@richielovall @BabyJHudson @QueeniesSoapbox @Imamofpeace They lost the land in 1967, just as it had changed hands 44 times throughout history
@RenaSofer @funder @realDonaldTrump Obama recognized Jerusalem as Israel capital. And do you truly believe Hillary is an honest trust worthy person?
@simplyemc @RenaSofer @funder @realDonaldTrump Why should he not? Jerusalem is capital if isreal. Why is that bad?
@WholePlateWay @funder @joehilley You care what hamas wants?
@canelli_lisa @JuddLegum @rezaaslan Omg! Didnu just seriously say that?? So pelosi didnt condemn conyers, hikkary didmt condemn weinstein. Vetting people from other countries or sending them back to their country is not bigotry! Wake up and quit believing fairy tales. Do u think hillary or dems actually care?
@slimgirl5000 @JuddLegum Both parties are crooks. Wake up!! Only reason you live the obama’s is because he wanted to give hand outs to the whole world. Grow up and realize that cant happen and its time to redo the government from the ground up. It doesnt work anymore
@John_M_Lally @JuddLegum Both sides pretend!! Damn when will you #sheep see that? Quit being brainwashed! Neither side gives a damn about you or I. Its time to get ride of them all and stsrt over. But wait that will make people have to miss favorite tv shows or sports events wouldnt it? #lazysheep #
@Luther_Baldwin @JuddLegum @joncoopertweets And clinton was innocent huh?
@tthmember @JuddLegum @joncoopertweets Show me the paper that says 75% of americans hate the tax plan?? Waiting.....yea u cant because its not teue
@americalastnite @JuddLegum He left is as guilty as the right. Choose truth over you political leanings. I guess u believe hillary did nothing wrong. Or what about bill? Do not see anyone condemning him and he ws actually proved guilty!
@crlbe @JuddLegum How do you know he is guilty? How?? Bet you think conyers is in ocent though, correct?
@cherokeesher2 @JuddLegum U honestly believe he is a traitor? Seriously?? What do you believe hillary is? A good honest american lady?
@MsTeeRenee @JuddLegum And you think the left doesnt? Seriously?? The democratic party has done more damage to black Americans than any party in history. Period! If you would read what the true outcome of their policies were you would see tue same thing. Quit believing the media, both left and right
@marconiplein @JuddLegum Why is he guilty and not innocent until proven guilty?
@canelli_lisa @JuddLegum @rezaaslan You think dems are any better? I see the media propagation machine has another sheep in thir herd
@rjlaya @JuddLegum @joncoopertweets So he is guilty until proven innocent, huh?
@MoneyIsSpeech @JuddLegum I thought people were in ocent until proven guilty in America? Has that changed?
@karenzach @JuddLegum I thought in America you were innocent until proven guilty
@Uju_collins @BillOReilly YES!!! On both sides. They are for greed and power not the people. People have become sheep to the media propaganda machine that feeds both aisles. We should be shepherds! Yet we allow the government to eun our lives instead of us running our country
@merrykachow @BigNish20 @SN_Ohio They had one
@somadenizen 0-2 since when? https://t.co/A5mh2rLGUo
@spookyoverlord @Fresh_Manny2 @TheBuckeyeNut Dominated? They won by a touchdown thats not dominating. Dominating is having a double nickel dropped on you by unranked iowa.
@spookyoverlord @Fresh_Manny2 @TheBuckeyeNut I believe bama owns that distinction. And OSU record vs SEC teams is 5-11. You dont know what physical football is.
@spookyoverlord @Fresh_Manny2 @TheBuckeyeNut And remember the whoopin they took from clemson. And it wouldve been a repeat whoopin this year. They need top 8 teams in cfp to be true playoff with great chance of getting at least the top best 5-6 teams in then
@spookyoverlord @Fresh_Manny2 @TheBuckeyeNut Hey osu gotnn last year when psu should have so osu fans meed to remember.
@MaxwellB69 Osu wouldnt stand a chance this year against a defense lile clemson or uga. And osu got in ladt uear when psu shoulda been in so shut up
@somadenizen @arouxBTN Uga played notre dame, miss state and lsu played byu, ole miss played ucla, fla played michigan. Soooo ur statement is false
@JoshMacuga Then how come college hoops play so many games if school matters? Yes top 8 teams should be in cfp
@spookyoverlord @Fresh_Manny2 @TheBuckeyeNut Osu doesnt stand a chance this yesr against any credible defense. Clemson or uga would let them score once maybe..
@surebetkeenan You may be correct, but i think OU will be surprised at the speed and ball swarm strategy GA has
@surebetkeenan You think OU ‘s D can stop UGA? I know that works both ways..but im not sure mayfield has ever met a men like Roquan and company.
@benjaminwolk I agree as a ga fan..auburn is top 4 team..last nghts game was a lil closer than score showed..clem, ou, uga, auburn should be the 4
@SenWhitehouse @SierraClub They are for sure. Not just dems and not just pubs allowing it. they all let the lobbyists run the show. Greed and power run the government mentality now. Its not whats best for the people any more And quiet honestly its our own fault. Became sheep instead of instead shepherds
@LouisatheLast @Noce82 @Marmel @Lyricoldrap Do you honestly think the left is better than@the right? If so please tell me why
@LouisatheLast @Noce82 @Marmel @Lyricoldrap U r so wrong. It was created so no one state had the abilty to elect president
@seanhannity put the thor laser on a ship park off nk coast. No visible light no trail no problems
@squallluis @realDonaldTrump Well diplomacy doesnt work. So whats left? Wait till he uses one on us? Or sales one to terrorists to use on us? Seems your logic is the joke
@LittleSprout26 It doesnt really bother me...people who say nothing but nice things about people they do not like are the real snakes. I like hearing whats on our president's mind. Yes some of it bullshit, but some of it is truth and its time we learn the government isnt here to take care of us
@LittleSprout26 Would it be condemned if he had of said warren was as old a methusela?
@RBReich @GardenLarge Bet u wouldnt say that if it was a dem tax cut
@GwenHarris5280 @EfanaticAnn @krassenstein @kbvette93 Why is the truth unkind? Explain how calling minority, "minority" is unkind. The truth is never unkind or wrong. The side stepping of the truth because it may make somene feel uncomfortable is ridiculous.
@EfanaticAnn @krassenstein @kbvette93 Do you honestly believe the left is any better? Seriously, do you? Quit being blind Both sides are full of worthless self centered greedy people. Money, greed, and power drunkenness drives the government now. They only listen to themselves they do not truly listen to the people.
@kbvette93 @krassenstein Do you honestly believe the left is any better? Seriously, do you? Quit being blind Both sides are full of worthless self centered greedy people.

@shaltsch @krassenstein @KimSanCartier Do you honestly believe the left is any better? Seriously, do you? Quit being blind Both sides are full of worthless self centered greedy people.

@CKDesG @Lee_in_Iowa @GiGicmka Yes! And with the advent of cable news, everything became slanted. You watch old news broadcasts and then tell me slanted/biased big money does not run media. Its a world of difference. Between then and now.
@CKDesG @Lee_in_Iowa @GiGicmka Most people do not realize BB was founded in Jerusalem, nor do they realize the scope of BB  With the addition of radio in 2015, it hs pretty long tendrils that definitely slants hard right. Most do not know Andrew was an intern for Ariana Huffington. He Helped launch HP website.
@CKDesG @Lee_in_Iowa @GiGicmka She is a nobody. Big media slants its stories to which ever side of the aisle the ownes/investures lean. They provide the best coverage for that which ever  side of the fence they stand. They influence elections with their coverage, they foment anger and hostility as well
@CKDesG @Lee_in_Iowa @GiGicmka You honestly think the big donors are not influencing the stories of most major news corps? Come on CK you seem very intelligent, you have to see the connection. And dont even get me started on the government and how they are all owned by big interest groups, both sides of aisle
@CKDesG @Lee_in_Iowa @GiGicmka All media creates division It drives their sales, advertisment and thr power Sheep do not realize this and thats when people become divided That type of division brings nations down or brings them to tyranny Shepherds on the other hand realize not to believe half of what u read.
@Lee_in_Iowa @cheezwitham Do you think the left is any better than trump? Seriously do you? Are you such a sheep that you think the left actually cares about you? Or the country? If you do i feel sorry for you. Neither side cares anymore. Its all money and greed now. Tou should be a Shepard not a sheep
@DDHart52 @kyungkarenmend1 @h2ofizz @realDonaldTrump All pardoned turleys spend night in high priced room. Obama did same, 350 a night rooms on his watch. So it isnt just trump doing it.

@NicciLynn1993 @AmericanVoterUS @realDonaldTrump Destroying? Explain how he is destroying? and before you think wrong, i didnt vote for him. But pleaee explain how he is destrying our country. you said he was and i want you to tell me how. If you actually can
@chrisasabutton @krassenstein Lmfao.. and you think the left is any better? When will you poor sheep wake up and realize you have allowed the government to take your life from you?  You do. Ot have free will anymore. You do not really choose your leaders amd your fed propaganda from both sides
@khimmelfarts @krassenstein @floydskers I have read hitlers books. Its a good thing to see the mind of people such as that. Hopefully you will learn something. Doesnt mean im a Nazi. Means i enjoy learning and understanding. Means i do not resort  to knee kerk reactions at things
@krassenstein @cheezwitham Show me where its been said about 12yr old and the 17 other women. Ex wives say alot of things from fantasy island

@kansasfemale @WSJ And your saying former left wing admin had NOTHING to do with any division in the US? How can u possibly say that? im a realist and believe BLM is just as hate filled as kkk. Do you not? Come on guy open your eyes and see both sides for what they are
@kansasfemale @WSJ Omg you are delusional on some of that. Those rallies were peaceful until the antifa/leftwing started violence. Been proven and videoed.  Russian collusion? Not from trump, but russia did tey to interfere for sure. But you can not believe the hate was his fault. Not possiblw
@kansasfemale @WSJ How so? Could it not be former administration's lack of denying that micheal brown was a thief and a menace, instead of letting media use race baiting articles to foment strife among people? i mean come on guy you can see this as what it is not what u want it to be.
@jaxspenser @WSJ In 2016? Really? You sure it wasnt because of former administration? And their refusal to stand up for what is right? Like not saying micheal brown was a crook and was attacking a cop? Letting the media run with mews casts that race bait on things like that? Get your head on
@kansasfemale @WSJ Yea his fault in 2016? Try again.

@knittaphd @GardenLarge #doctors  #BigPharma and #politicians  lie to you every day 24/7/365. From both sides of the aisle. They are to swayed by money from #lobbyists of outside big interest groups and companies. But you sheep argue over them everyday 24/7/365. See a pattern here?
Time to take a stand against #BigPharma and our American #Healthcare institutions. #processedfood is destroying our #health. We do not have to be obese and sickly. Just take some time and do some  research into food, excercise, and health go hand in hand
@EWErickson But one is accepted  the other isn't. Should be outrage at both
@EWErickson Cant you see neither is right--no way my three year old can determine his grmder without adult influence which is both cases is an outrage
@EWErickson But people areok with it but someone older who gives consent to sex is seen as taken advantage of and god im not defending moore piss on him
@EWErickson Every negative poster missing the point trying to be made--how does a three year capable of determining his sexuality? Seriously?
@eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ Doctors are the pimps of pharmaceutical companies! Almost Evry damn one of you practice reactive medicine instead of preventive medicine
@kennyclark567 @eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ To our government now. Their is too much big interest involvement. They do NOT care about the people, only select few. Surely you see this
@kennyclark567 @eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ Do you honestly think the left is any better? you need to wake up and realize neither side is worthy to lead. Its all money and greed
@GentzschPam @geman5212 @eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ You think healthcare is a right?
@Rachelc888 @SneakypNJ @AngelaBelcamino @eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ If you take electoral college away, then policy could be set for all states by very a few states
@SneakypNJ @AngelaBelcamino @eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ Only because of cali did he not get the majority. Thats why you the electoral college. So no one state or just a few can make policy for all
@eugenegu @BarackObama @RalphNortham @PhilMurphyNJ Funny how just the eastern side of the state, and i do mean the very most eastern of the state gets to set policy for the whole state.

@MOpoliticalguy @jim_hontz @stormynormy42 @DavidLimbaugh Oeople do not have to call names and belittle to state a point or belief
@MOpoliticalguy @jim_hontz @stormynormy42 @DavidLimbaugh And asking to be quiet. Correct? You think the government is there to babysit. Its NOT When younrely on others to babysit you u become sheep
@MOpoliticalguy @jim_hontz @stormynormy42 @DavidLimbaugh you have been conditioned to let others take care of your problems. You would call police if ur neighbor is too loud instead of walking over
@MOpoliticalguy @jim_hontz @stormynormy42 @DavidLimbaugh You just proved my point on media telling you what to do sir. And its one of main problems in America today. Follow along young grasshopper.
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh Now find me the studies and i will find you a money trail leading to funding by the people making vid games, tv media etc..
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh Omg name them sir. There were many many studies saying cigarettes didnt cause cancer as well--those turned out to be true, huh?
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh I do not argue that point. I argue the cause of all the violence. guns have been here long before all these mass shootings. But other hasnt
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh Says who?  What studies?? You think its just coincidence that all this came about at around the same time? Come on now
@TheRealMadGib @ghanyathomas @Jakemusc22 @Radpolitik @markmobility @MichaelOReilly_ @POTUS And until you all get off the elephant and donkey hayrides nothing will change
@TheRealMadGib @ghanyathomas @Jakemusc22 @Radpolitik @markmobility @MichaelOReilly_ @POTUS Soros, buffet, koch, omidyar and few others tell you exactly who to vote for and why you should. Mass media contols most of you
@TheRealMadGib @ghanyathomas @Jakemusc22 @Radpolitik @markmobility @MichaelOReilly_ @POTUS Are you fucking stupid? Tyranny has been present since the government started overstepping their boundaries and lying to get votes.
@livingstondj @TheRealMadGib @Jakemusc22 @Radpolitik @markmobility @MichaelOReilly_ @POTUS My dick is bigger than both of yall's So lets start a pissing contest shall we? Bottom line is this neither side gives a damn about u or I
@Jakemusc22 @Radpolitik @markmobility @MichaelOReilly_ @POTUS And hillary shouldnt? Or fbi head that knew the truth in 2009? You wanna debate im ya huckleberry, my friend. And i do not like either side
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh Which coincides with video game violence, tv violence, music violence, the glorification of thug life and a plethora of other violence media
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh There have been auto weapons for the masses for many  decades and this mass shooting thing didnt happen like itnis now till last few
@MOpoliticalguy @DavidLimbaugh No the issue is how people are desensitized to@killing by today's media and families not raised right. Thats the issue!
@OhHelmNo @GodsnameIam @Astros_gal @StephenKing Until last few decades
@OhHelmNo @GodsnameIam @Astros_gal @StephenKing Seriously why the hell cant any of you see that? Their has always been weapons and auto weapons for the masses. But not mass shootings
@OhHelmNo @GodsnameIam @Astros_gal @StephenKing How video games has completely unsensitized killing? How people have walked away from responsibility to raising their family right?
@OhHelmNo @GodsnameIam @Astros_gal @StephenKing Ever think that the real cause of all this is how media is bombarding people daily with violence? How thug life is glorified?
@MichaelSkolnik @lisaannr The 1520 is misleading
@lisaannr @realDonaldTrump And obama wasnt? Nor bush? Nor clinton? Get a grip and finally realize neither side cares anout you or I anymore. The system is broken
@TravisKepler28 @realDonaldTrump Many most likely, until you all realize the truth The government does not care about you or I anymore. Its about business and money PERIOD!
@ggary59 @brendangberry @N3v3rhillary @klubbkiddkl @realDonaldTrump Why wouldnt they? Pubs do the same when its convenient for them. None of you realize the truth--- they ( pubs or dems) care about u or US
@brendangberry @N3v3rhillary @klubbkiddkl @realDonaldTrump And obama didnt? Or bush? Or clinton? Or bush? Seriously, all this dems and pubs bullshit needs to stop. Every damn one of you need wake up
@JCor49 @DanielleR510 @DavidHudson04 @SenSchumer People are naive especially young people today Social media Sounding boards are a huge factor in the problem with blindness to our situation
@JCor49 @DanielleR510 @DavidHudson04 @SenSchumer Tell multiple lies and the media pushes it hard. The Koch brothers, soros,  buffet, omidyar, and their respective left/right media that is
@JCor49 @DanielleR510 @DavidHudson04 @SenSchumer Lmao! They tell you who to vote for now, multiple lies every year from every single one of them on both sides and in the middle
@JCor49 @DanielleR510 @DavidHudson04 @SenSchumer OMG! Are all of you people, on BOTH sides, so unaware that neither side is better than the other. And your vote counts now? Seriously?
@notthe12 @NathanFinegan @yankifarber @realDonaldTrump I agree.... but..if the world leaders had to fight along with the troops..we could save a lot of lives...and money
@notthe12 @NathanFinegan @yankifarber @realDonaldTrump Same to u
@notthe12 @NathanFinegan @yankifarber @realDonaldTrump 3-505..fat fingers
@notthe12 @NathanFinegan @yankifarber @realDonaldTrump But we see alot of people bashing people that havent served yet neither have they
@notthe12 @NathanFinegan @yankifarber @realDonaldTrump B-Co 5-505 87-93 and i understand

@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel Just so you both know i di not support pubs or dems. I think both well actually all parties are corrupt beyond redemption
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel No rest for the weary. Thats why our country is being eaten by cancers. People sat  on their ass for too long
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel Like the columbia journalism school is headed by Lee Boilinger. Well he also sets on PPB and on washington post board of directors.
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel Lmao....thats a drop in the buck to the amount he gives..but the power comes from the connections on his funded journalism boards
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel He has major connections to 30media organizations. Many many main stream journalists sit on his funded journalism boards.
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel Quit being a sheep and be a damn shepherd for once in your life. They all have agendas and its not the american peoples' best interest
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel His open society foundation network's many ark give soro more media power than evidently you know. Maybe u should read and comprehend
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel Omg are you that naive?? Seriously????
@SpryResume @PatriciaJean00 @WSJ @KimStrassel Replying to patricia's commemt about WSJ and koch brothers
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel So left wing prop machine is much bigger than the koch brothers prop machine They divide us and let us fight while they move agendas forward
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel The Columbia School of Journalism, which operates CJR, has received at least $600,000 from Soros, as well.
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel ProPublica, there are the Center for Public Integrity, the Center for Investigative Reporting and New Orleans' The Lens.
@PatriciaJean00 @SpryResume @WSJ @KimStrassel And Soros doesnt fund abc, nbc, WP, and the times. At least 7 major projects funded by Soros' Open Society Institute.
@IrinaMikhale @KeithOlbermann @1oneclone Tell me how you know its bots. I wanna see for myself. You know the billionaire funders of left and right divide us to further their agenda

@KeithOlbermann You are a lying piece of shit. And you know this. Why do u lie to the american people? Why push ur agenda on people that do not want it
@complxgrl @HighPlainsGirl1 @SeattleJen42 @BillyMav3 @SamAustin2103 @Alyssa_Milano You think either party is honest? Your a sheep. Neither party cares about you or I. Power is what its all about. Quit being sheep

@RiveraGrrl @tgconsolidation @dyannleroy @kylegriffin1 Its time the sheep become the shepherds again. do we need people acting like kings and queens, out of touch with us, telling us how to live?
@RiveraGrrl @tgconsolidation @dyannleroy @kylegriffin1 They keep us fighting and giving them votes by the media being the propagandist arm of parties. They want us divided, why cant yall see that
@RiveraGrrl @tgconsolidation @dyannleroy @kylegriffin1 Both parties are funded by billionaires. Do you honestly think they do it to spread liberalism or conservatism? If you do , then please stop
@RiveraGrrl @tgconsolidation @dyannleroy @kylegriffin1 It doesnt matter what which group lights ur fire, they both have the same flaw. Its not about the people, its about the agenda.
@RiveraGrrl @tgconsolidation @dyannleroy @kylegriffin1 Geez. when will all u wake up out of ur delusions?? No political party cares about you or I. It cares about power money, and fame.
@taxvictim @RogueSNRadvisor @theCrimsonCello Yea the prize u seek is the wrong one. Geez you people fight over dems and pubs and dont have the sense to realize neither cares about u
@impeachthepos1 @bankrlawimp @RogueSNRadvisor Be funny if its the podesta group indicted
@ChyrllMcdonald @allisonceppi @RogueSNRadvisor Do u not think mueller should step aside?
@sam2fabu @deray @FoxNews Humans are the same, we have basic needs and wants. Why do we need a huge group of people sitting on thrones telling us what to think?
@sam2fabu @deray @FoxNews When we fight they get votes. We have to stop being sheep and become the shepherds again. They are our employees and need to be taught that
@sam2fabu @deray @FoxNews They do not care about you or I or any other normal everyday citizens, Sam. You have to know that. They divide and make us fight
@sam2fabu @deray @FoxNews Well i get that, but all the others had the opposite slant obama/hillary good repubs bad. But bottom line is sir that neither party cares
@matthewpcharles @deray @kswills Lmao and u think their is no whataboutism on cnn, abc, nbc, msnbc or cbs? Seriously are you all that damn stupid? Quit letting them divide

@AllenWeiser58 @UnitedRUS2016 @ananavarro @SoSofieFatale The real issue is why a very tiny power contractor (4-6) men, got a huge multimillion dollar contract to do. They dont have the resouces
@AllenWeiser58 @UnitedRUS2016 @ananavarro @SoSofieFatale You are completely delusional...you cant restore oower to a moutainous island in 36 days. Everything has to be brought from mainland

@pithypacky @JeremyinAkron @ZaneInTheValley @AtticusGF That said, quit blaming people for other peoples mistakes! Start cleaning the inner cities up, stop all the broken homes across america
@pithypacky @JeremyinAkron @ZaneInTheValley @AtticusGF Racism happens because you label people due to skin pigmentation, and geographic location..there is only once race, the human race..

@GaviLazan @danielmarans That said neither party works. They are for power only and not the people anymore. The government  system is broken. time for a major change
@GaviLazan @danielmarans People cause a lot of their own issues. By how they act. The left has been the absolute biggest factor in problems the poor have.
@GaviLazan @danielmarans The only difference is where you fall on the wealth scale. That scale is what determines how you live vs. how you struggle with life
@GaviLazan @danielmarans Oh i get it sir...more than the 95% who do not. There is NO systemic oppression or racism anymore. Everyone has same chance as anyone else

@danielmarans Tell me Daniel Do you honestly see systemic Racism in America And why do we use descriptors for humans? Black Asian African We are all human

@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 Point taken- imo the problem for humans is Greed. Nothing holds us back as a species more than that
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 LMAO. No, information is a wonderful thing, un-corrupted knowledge is the cure for all.
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 What is the main problem within the human race james? One word answer. Seriously, please answer that
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 See???? White/Caucasian, asian, african, etc--those are NOT races! there is the human race period. One race on oe planet
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 There has always been just a few running things behind the scenes they use racism as a way to keep people apart so they can herd them easier
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 u sir are the racist not me im a realist. I see things for what they are..there are no grey areas for me. And the racist card is getting old
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 And see how u r treated compared to people of the same ethnicity and there is only ONE race, the human race. The descriptors need  abolished
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 U r full of crap..i promise you that you have been subject to racism.. go into any store owned by indian or pakistani or black or hispanic
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 Plus where would they rather be right now? Nigeria? Senagal? Guinea?  Angola? I believe they enjoy a much better chance here than there
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 Blacks bring about most of their problems by seperating themselves with descriptors such as African American, they are american not african
@James_Tanner123 @truthfulvoice61 You are entrenched into the idea of systemic and structural racism. Just a way for the rich to keep us all in place. Grow the fuck up

@hippiechickgrrl @H_Combs @Trumptactics @realDonaldTrump Seriously??? Sooooo in your opinion its ok to be twenty million in debt instead of balanced budget and having a surplus?
@cacaophilix @H_Combs @Trumptactics @realDonaldTrump I honey sweety and i mean nothing by it. Now feminists  im sure are offended. But i do not mean it that way. Its habit to me
@hippiechickgrrl @H_Combs @Trumptactics @realDonaldTrump Why block? You cant handle that most american workers are tired of being second rate to other countries. We are overwhelmed with debt.

@jimgardner @bncrrll @sarahljaffe Only 4 states gave declarations and you are correct about about them standing with slavery. BUT lincoln did NOT goto war for slavery
@bjsmu @amberw790 @ShaunKing No as with most peope he care about money, the one great divider among all humans.  Worthless paper--greatest evil ever
@amberw790 @ShaunKing And again rich  celebrities and sports figures get more attention than do real issues facing our country. Everyone lets pettiness divide us
@BBTNEastbias @lil_yenta @bncrrll @sarahljaffe To Whom are you refering to?

@atom_cable @roqchams @sarahljaffe I have many problems with that..from having been there and just the morality of it period But a monetary system will always have same result
@bncrrll You people seriously have no clue. You should be more worried about black on black crime.  Its a LOT more of an issue
@bncrrll @sarahljaffe If civil war was  about slavery why did  Lincoln wait till 1863 to give emancipation proclamation?  And why did it  ONLY to rebel states?
@bncrrll @sarahljaffe You want to topple historic monuments? Seriously?? Its history get over yourselves.
@roqchams @sarahljaffe The reason. Being everything is based on a worthless piece of paper. You want equality? Get rid of currency and goto a different system
@roqchams @sarahljaffe See that is all liberals can do..you willl. Ot face the reality that this country can NOT support everyone in the world.
@roqchams @sarahljaffe Maybe he is illegal? Or maybe he shouldve had  a license...why dont you stand up for people that actually need it.

@tk421421421 @MetalMilitia74 we sre lucid. We aren't sheep waiting in the slaughter line like so many disillusioned liberals
@tk421421421 8. Occam’s razor: the simplest explanation for the “Russian hacking” story is that it isfake news that suits the leftwing media
@tk421421421 7. Foreign interference in elections is nothing new — and the Obama administration is a prime culprit.--money given to isreali
@tk421421421 6. Julian Assange and Wikileaks have vigorously denied that the Russians were involved in Wikileaks’ disclosures.
@tk421421421 5. The Obama administration has a history of manipulating intelligence for political gain--centcom report on isis fught
@tk421421421 4. Despite left-wing “fake news,” there is no evidence Russian hackers actually distorted the voting process.
@tk421421421 3. The CIA is not making public claims that Russia hacked the election.
@tk421421421 2. The “evidence” that the CIA has gathered is inconclusive.
@tk421421421 1. There is actually no new information leading the CIA to its conclusion.
@tk421421421 libs always resort to name calling and derogatory comments when they can't answer logically or truthfully. It is a pattern.
@tk421421421 then explain why out of the 48 reports on that site only 6 have that disclaimer? Explain why sir come on boy lets hear it
@tk421421421 read the disclaimer at top. https://t.co/pk6qjwXgn1
@tk421421421 no because why would foreign intelligence want us to know they had hacked it?
@tk421421421 where do u get ur news from? Cnn fox nbv washinton pots times? Where? Lets hear it mr know it all
@tk421421421 no sir i am not. Carney's report from september 2016 say multiple times it was shut down due to attacks. Damn you libs are slow
@tk421421421 the fbi claims chance high of at least 5 foreign intel agencies hacked her server. So you believe them now but not then.
@tk421421421 dont you?
@tk421421421 no they dont but email files etc can carry them after server has been breachec
@tk421421421 if true that dnc was hacked by russsians. Ever think maybe the malware infiltration came from unsecured server in basement

See you cant offer a shred of evidence just your opinion same as mine..
@tk421421421 when the rolling stone, the bastion of conservatism, even says the report is fishy
@tk421421421 intel community do not even agree! Damn what part of that cant you see? How many times has intelligence been wrong??

@yvostik I've tried elk lasagna a few times and was excellent every time.
Greens like nitrogen to grow their best. Use Composted chicken, cow or Horse Manure, fresh rabbit manure or worm castings. Work it into soil
Growing Salad Greens - Don't just plant lettuce, use Arugula  bokchoy endive, spinach radicchio escarole, kale, they all grow well together!
Today's tips are on Salad Greens and how to grow them year round no matter where you live...first tip, Greens like well drained, rich soil
@McDonalds  promoting diabetes and obesity with your preservatives and empty calorie food....
One last tomato tip for today, put down black or red plastic a week before you plant, those extra degrees of warmth makes earlier tomatoes!
If you will prune the suckers off you indeterminate tomato plants, and trellis them up, you will garner larger tomatoes.
furrow or drip irrigation is preferred for tomato plants. This decreases surface wetting which could promote fungal issues, like black mold
Blossom end rot on tomatoes is calcium deficiency brought on by water stress.water consistent, evenly, and mulch. One inch of water per week
@LondonJulia31 if stem wilts in middle and dies, its not getting enough light. Becoming too leggy, stretching to reach light. 7-8hrs light
@LondonJulia31 also if your using artificial light, put it about 2in above your seeds.

Prop 37,the CA.GMO labeling initiative was defeated due to the more than $45M that Monsanto, Kraft,and dozens of  others spent to get a NO

Have a dream with the goal of living off your own land Selling your own produce/meat products? I am here to help you, ask and get answer
Can't seem to get your plants to grow properly? Check PH level of your soil,  keep as close to 6-6.5 as possible. Your veg's will thank you!
Phosphorous is very important in root development, it's best to incorporate it into soil before planting.
Potassium increases water efficiency, helps stress tolerance, and improves seeds and fruiting.

@Mylilgarden Me too, it's geared to control food borne illness...but almost all food illness comes from big agribusiness...NOT small farms
