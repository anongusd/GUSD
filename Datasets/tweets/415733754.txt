@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine These Are MY KIDS  - Army Navy Airforce Marines-  My 19 yr old Died in Afghan-2010- our Second born was wounded in Afghanistan in 2011-Our Daughter (Navy) our Daughter in Law Marines-  Non of them would EVER wear a MAGA hat. Just saying https://t.co/ip5klXHkjl
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Seem you don't actually have a grasp on this stuff- So maybe YOU need to define Conservative &amp; show me EXACTLY how that applies to Trump- PS I was a Baptist Missionary- I'm a Gold Star Dad with 3 other kids that served-3 kids have been to Israel-Self employed since I was 19
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine So- Locking up Children- Tax Fraud-Screwing Porn Stars- Lying 8000 x-  Siding with Dictators- would Make Ron Reagan roll in his grave! I took that Pic at Value Voters 2015- when those Fundamentalist Christians LAUGHED at him and his Bible https://t.co/bcBDlfTgEM
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine The first pillar of conservatism is liberty, or freedom  The second pillar of conservative philosophy is tradition and order The third pillar is the rule of law. The fourth pillar is belief in God.
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Really?  LOL   George Will served as an editor for National Review from 1972 to 1978.	 Brent Scowcroft National Security Advisor under U.S. Presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush.  Ollie North?  Worked for Ron Reagan-- CONSERVATIVES
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Okay let us take that to an extreme- Because that is always the test- If a kid wears a Swastika to school - do you feel that's Free Speech and no one should say anything?
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Stop for a moment- You are complaining about Bigotry-intolerance- when the Hat you want her to wear REPRESENTS Bigotry-intolerance? You do know that right?  You see who is wearing it right?  The Alt Right-  If you want a hat that promotes good values- America is Already Great https://t.co/APmBJjEk7x
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine @marcorubio PS you do know there were ZERO classified emails at the time (Some were later UP Classified) but ZERO at the time- FROM THE COMEY HEARING July 7th 2016 CSPAN  https://t.co/AATGQt7Rug
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine @marcorubio Here so you won't be confused on the EMAILS- So you get your facts straight-  So you don't go through life spouting misinformation-  Please take the time to actually hear what the FBI report said  https://t.co/AATGQt7Rug
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine @marcorubio Really?  Then why didn't Trey Gowdy find any guilt?  I'm sure your concerned about "Dead Americans"  2 dead Contractors  A Dead CIA Agent and a Dead Ambassador- right?   How many soldiers died that week in Afganistan?
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine No not CONSERVATIVES- I know CONSERVATIVES-  Trump is not one- THAT's MY POINT-  You might be- BUT HE'S NOT-  You know who is CONSERVATIVE?  Can you Identify these men? https://t.co/oq488SkUfg
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine it doesn't protect u from opposing opinions-That's my point-So if your daughter wants to support a man that Cheats on his Taxes, wives, business associates- mocks handicaps POWS Gold Star Families  Well, send her to school in that hat. But remember FREE SPEECH comes with a PRICE
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine LOL you mean Trump Supporters are Conservatives?  I think you're confused- Conservatives don't increase the national debt $2 Tillion Conservatives Don't Screw Porn Stars-Cheat on their Wives- Don't hate immigrants- now do they? So these folks are Conservatives? https://t.co/0b42oFyKR5
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Really? Benghazi?  Seems TREY GOWDY found ZERO FAULT for her.  You know that right?   Her Charity has a A+ rating with the People who grade Charities-  You do know  @marcorubio orignially funded the Dossier and Much of it has been proven correct.
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Maybe you should listen to this again and decide if this is the ROLE MODEL she should be promoting- Trump Gets Caught Saying "Grab Her by the Pussy" - YouTube	https://t.co/n8spYca0W7
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Do you not see that BUYING it supports a guy that STOLE from his own charity- that lied 8000+ times- that mocked a Handicap- called a Gold Star Wife a liar-Shame? Well if you're for those things- wear the hat- but I doubt you are for those things or is your child #GoldStarDad
@Jennife08590366 @JudgeJeanine Yes wearing a hat that buying it supports a guy that Cheats on his Taxes- Cheats on his Wife-Was sued for discrimination-Paid $25 Million in FRAUD for cheating old people-Barebacked a Porn Star while his 3rd wife was home nursing a newborn- Great Role Model for your child

@Navylife84 @LouDobbs You're  funny but wrong. Do you believe you need your gun to protect yourself from "Tyranny"?
@NavAirVet That's How- If you GIVE SELL OR TRADE A GUN with anyone-they should be able to pass a UBC- It won't stop Crime but will cut down on people that shouldn't have guns.  It's not an inconvenience-Seems you had to pass one- why should you decide you can give/sell to someone that can't
@NavAirVet Another 11% of the time, someone else bought the gun for them, either as a gift or as a straw purchase (situations I wish the survey separated). Roughly 15% got guns from family and friends (buying, renting, trading, borrowing). WITHOUT A UBC
@NavAirVet PER DOD- Among prisoners serving time for a crime during which they possessed a gun, about half got their weapons either on the underground market (43 percent)  You mean Private Sales? Without a UBC-
@NavAirVet It's "Law Abiding Folks" that don't secure their guns- Give them away to other people without a Background Check- Sell them to Strangers without a background check. You know that, so just stop- No one without a UBC should have a gun.  period
@NavAirVet Well if that stranger can't pass one YOU GO TO JAIL if you sell it to him?  You going to sell him the gun?  I doubt you would. ALL GUNS FROM LEGAL GUN MANUFACTURERS Start with Legal Transfer- It's the (Good Guy with The Gun) that puts it in the criminal's hands https://t.co/5gg92mNcY4

@GOP Socialist like Canada?  Compulsory Universal Healthcare, Liberal Abortion Policy, Strick Gun Laws, Subsidized Colleges, 30% Union Membership, 33% Top Tax Rate.  But you folks LOVE Canada right?
@GOP Socialist like ISRAEL?  Compulsory Universal Healthcare, Liberal Abortion Policy, Strick Gun Laws, Subsidized Colleges, 30% Union Membership, 47% Top Tax Rate.  But you folks LOVE ISRAEL right?
@NavAirVet Really- LOL we have Background Checks?  Can you sell a stranger a gun without one in a private sale?  I already know the Answer  - I was an FFL Dealer- So unless you make it that NO GUNS are SOLD to ANYONE without a Background check it's all worthless
@thehill Nothing Says "Born Again Christian" like barebacking a Porn Star while your 3rd wife is breastfeeding your 5th child by 3 women- #GoldStarDad https://t.co/hBOlumkbtL

@carol_dacanay @JohnCornyn Canada and Israel-  Gee you'd think since they are so in love with Israel- they wouldn't talk such trash about socialist.
@JohnCornyn You don't like Canada? Canada- Compulsory Universal Healthcare- Abortion in Canada is legal at all stages of pregnancy-Mandatory Background Checks- Colleges are underwritten by Gov to keep it cheap-30% of Canadian workers belong to a union- 33% Tax-So Canadians are Socialists-
@JohnCornyn So you don't like Israel? WOW-Israel-Compulsory Universal Healthcare- Israel’s abortion law is among world’s most liberal-Strick Gun Laws- Colleges are underwritten by Gov to keep it cheap-29% of Israeli workers belong to a union- 47% Tax-So Israelis are Socialists- WOW-
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Yep- because they keep making it so not everyone has to buy in-  You do know that- The reason the prices keep going up-  The more people that pay in the cheaper it is.  But clearly they keep saying you dont have to have insurance so the healthy ones DON'T
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump But if Insurance companies had their way THEY WOULD NEVER cover you.
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I get it- but if everyone had it , EVERYONE would force it to work better- You see you'd be covered no matter how much you make.  That how it works- It's like making Rich kids go to crappy schools- their parents will make the schools better, Really ask a Canadian

@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump then they could deny you coverage
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump that's on the insurance company. Not the Gov. They are ripping folks off and if EVERYONE was in- it would collectively be cheaper- The GOP keeps making the prices go up by pulling out important parts- You would be screwed if they take away Preexisting
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump you're still using a private insurance company- do you get medicaid? because is not you aren't using government insurance
@89Ramcharger360 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Healthcare in Israel is universal and participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right Israelis can increase their medical coverage &amp; improve their options by purchasing private health insurance

@jaljll77 @FullMeasureNews @SidneyPowell1 The special counsel's charges involve Stone's House testimony about WikiLeaks and its release of hacked material from the Democratic National Committee and, later, from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta during the 2016 campaign.
@jaljll77 @FullMeasureNews @SidneyPowell1 Do you have a clue what you are talking about? On Thursday, the grand jury indicted Stone on seven counts of lying to Congress, witness tampering, and obstructing a congressional investigation. So what, specifically, is Stone charged with doing?

@TomCottonAR Healthcare in Israel is universal &amp; participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right.Israelis can increase their medical coverage &amp; improve their options by purchasing private health insurance.

@patrici26405014 Patricia I 100% agree-  I pose this question to you- If a truly sterile male has sex with a fertile female will he impregnate her?

@LanceEdwardsChr @xbolt225 @BuckSexton You mean the woman that lived in his area- that has been talking about it for years- named his friends described the one she couldn't name. Her father belongs to the same Golf Course as his dad. Oh they found her out of nowhere- Right.

@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats Tax Rate in Israel is 47%     So they are Communists?   Wow don't tell; that Right Wing Zionist government?  And Don't tell that Liberal Canadian Government?  You were homeschooled huh?
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats The tuition is also subsidized by the Federal government to keep it affordable. Top Tax Rate 33%
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats Canadian law separates guns into three different categories: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. A license, obtained through a process that includes background checks and safety training, is needed to own any type of gun in Canada.
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats Healthcare in Canada is delivered through thirteen provincial and territorial systems of publicly funded health care, informally called Medicare. It is guided by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984.
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats Healthcare in Israel is universal &amp; participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right.Israelis can increase their medical coverage &amp; improve their options by purchasing private health insurance.
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats All of Israel's nine public universities, and some of its colleges, are subsidized by the government, and students pay only a small part of the actual cost of tuition.
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats Abortion in Canada is legal at all stages of pregnancy, and is governed by the Canada Health Act. While some non-legal obstacles exist, Canada is one of only a few nations with no legal restrictions on abortion.
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats https://t.co/3VJW5VPijv
@BrianSOLeary @TheDemocrats LOL- Is Canada Communist? Is Israel? They both have Compulsary Universal Healthcare- They have Strick Gun Laws -They Have LIBERAL ABORTION POLICY-They Have Colleges underwritten by the Government- Maybe you don't have a clue what DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISM is.
@LanceEdwardsChr @BuckSexton Still don't- But of course, you think it's unlikely a known drunk 17-year-old with his drunk friend would never try to molest a pretty 15-year-old girl at a drinking part with no adults- LOL you really are Naive-https://t.co/LeCGWeCbtO

@WalshFreedom Joe- do you wake up that stupid or is it a Drug thing?  Did anyone force these women to have abortions? Or was it their choice. Maybe access to birth control- better education to support their children- better opportunity for success- Of wait all those things the GOP is against.
@ToddTho98583356 @KatrinaPierson @RalphNortham @GovernorVA Boom what?  Were any of those women FORCED to have an abortion or was it their choice? Maybe if there was more access to Birth Control- Better Education- higher paid jobs- Women wouldn't see it as their only choice?  https://t.co/e27XyxmG0Z
@KatrinaPierson @RalphNortham @GovernorVA Were the women FORCED to have abortions?  Or was it a matter of Choice?

@AFutureFree @ChrisSalcedoTX @KSEV700 @VidaTVNet Seems you think Rich Oligharchs should tell you what you deserve? Maybe YOU should live under PUTIN? Since you obviously are a fan.

@buckeyes1980 @blanken01 @marklevinshow I guess the 13 Russian Indictment- The Sharing of Polling Info with the Russians by Manafort- The Contact by Roger Stone with Assange- The endless lying (and on Tues-Mueller- will have the Congressional Testimony of 50 witnesses) We haven't heard what Flynn-Gates-said yet either
@buckeyes1980 @blanken01 @marklevinshow Again- answer the question-Why didn't he do the speach he said he would. Don't attack the source-just provide facts that say they are incorrect

@buckeyes1980 @blanken01 @marklevinshow Sheep?  LOL- really?  Well again- What Dirt did he have on the 7th since the Dirt didn't come out til after that?  Please tell me why he didn't produce it?  Really answer that question?

@littlegirl108 @gatewaypundit @michellemalkin @seanhannity Hey, easy question- Do Sterile Men cause pregnancy?  If no, it proves it's not the Sex that does it, but Semen (you get that right?)  Isn't semen 100% in control of the Male?  Gee - Seems If men stop leaving their Semen in women that don't want their baby- Abortion would end.
@mtracey @littlegirl108 LOL- Oh you mean the ones that talked Trash about @BarackObama for not doing it? (Red Line) and him working to get the Chemical Weapons out?   That bunch of "GOP" cowards? #GoldStarDad

@bigleaguepol @gatewaypundit This is not infanticide. It is the standard of care for any terminally ill patient. If a person is dying, the parent, spouse or next of kin decides with a doctor at what point to discontinue extraordinary measures to save them. If your argument against a law is solid, why lie?
@bigbadant Your assumption is she wants it at all- You might find that she doesn't-hence the abortion.

@bigbadant Well if he can't then it proves that the Act of SEX doesn't cause pregnancy- So it's not the Sex it's the Semen- Right?  So if a male doesn't leave his Semen in a woman that doesn't want his baby- We can end Abortion- It's really that simple- Not Sex but Semen 100% inside the Man

@RepRepublic According to the 2017 tax statements, Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, reported an adjusted gross income of $913,000. Together, they paid $302,000 in taxes that year and are eligible for nearly $34,000 in refunds.  That's 1/3 of her income paid in taxes- How much did you pay?

@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 No I don't actually care about what gun u own Really- Don't be a Criminal or a Nut- That's my point- CHECK EVERYONE- You shouldn't be able to get your hands on a gun if you can't pass a Background Check- These are my kids-I get ugly Guns- I also get burying kids too #GoldStarDad https://t.co/pJguFyOZKL
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 LOL- THANKS
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 You see you said KIDS can't have GUNS- Yes they Can- and you can legally sell a felon your gun if you don't ask him if he is a Felon- That's the thing you seem to be avoiding- It's only illegal on YOUR PART (the Gun Owner) if you ask and they say YES. So let's make that Illegal
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Cute- The Conversation was about Assualt Rifes- Can I sell a hand gun privately to a stranger legally- If YES you make my case- if No then you are right?  Which is it?
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 But since GUNS start Legal and move to illegal through Private Sales- Theft- gifts- then The LEGAL GUY becomes the original source- Stop that and we stop a lot of transfers
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 we are talking about "Assualt Rifles" So I guess the GUNS we are talking about here are Rifles-Right? Assault Rifles Are Linked to 25% of Active Shooter.  25% isn't RARE-especially when they account for the highest Death Toll-As access becomes more widespread does increase use
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Federal Law- https://t.co/CAew0cyxrB
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 So clearly you don't actually know what you are talking about- So really you might fact check yourself before you pretend to have a clue.  https://t.co/rKsHCTp7tF
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Really?  You don't actually know the law huh? Unlicensed persons may sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a long gun or long gun ammunition to a person of any age.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 So i can buy 50 guns in one day and sell them all to a guy in the parking lot who could be a felon and as long as I don't ask him it's all legal- you do get that right?
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 WRONG- You have admitted that you can buy or sell a gun Legally without a background check- you can sell a Felon a gun if you don't know he's a felon legally- you can will a nutty kid your guns Legally- You can give a stranger a Gun legally if you don't ask him if he's a felon-
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 You See it's then on the seller-  That's where the responsibility SHOULD BE-  It's on the Gun Shop- so should it be on the Owner-
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 So if you sell a stranger a gun- how do you know he's not a felon?
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 LOL  Guns in the Hands Of Criminals-  that's the Problem- and clearly you think forcing Unversal Checks in EVERY STATE- For EVERY TRANSFER would deter that- except we know that's not true. Statistics prove that.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 About 1/2?  You have that stat?
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 The federal government and the majority of states  do not require background checks for private gun sales, and an estimated 22% of all firearms transferred in the US are acquired from unlicensed sellers without a background check.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 NOPE- Legal Sales BUB-  I can buy a gun in walmart walk out and sell it to a guy in the parking lot legally in some states- Hell I can sell it on the radio on the swap shop- I can legally give it to a stranger- PRIVATE SALES in Most states
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 Really?  You ever sold anyone a gun without a background check?  To a friend? A stranger? I know lots of people that do- If you were going to go to jail for a year if you did-would that stop you?  The first sale of most Guns is legal- what happens after that might not be tracked.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 I think you answered that- you don't speed and MOST PEOPLE DON'T because we have those laws- Did drunk driving laws reduce Drunk Driving- YEP- and when you get caught- the penalty is steep.  Gee this blows your argument huh? https://t.co/CJ09LBjRYS
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 STOP- can you injure 400+ people from 20 floors up and 100s of yards away from them with a Hammer?   We all get that even an AR15 with a Bump Stock is way more lethal than a Hammer- or we'd be arming Police &amp; Military with Hammers
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Here-  Can you sell someone your gun without a background check in Most states?  Can you will your children your Gun in most states? Can you give a friend a Gun in most states without a Background Check?  If the answer is yes to ANY of them- That's a Problem
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 FOCUS--  PRIVATE SALES- make up where most criminals buy GUNS- PRIVATE SALES- there should NEVER BE A BRIVATE SALE EVER TO ANYONE!
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Laws actually work- Note the decrease in Crime since the 1990s-  Most Crime is done by a few people in a community- Selling Guns to Strangers out of your car isn't illegal in LOTS OF STATES-  Stop that and you'll cut down on Bad Guys with Guns
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 So if there wasn't a speed limit you'd drive fast right?   But if you knew it was a year in Prison if you drove over 50 you'd probably not huh?
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 Do you Speed?  Do you ride without your Seat Belt?  People do until they are caught- Currently I can sell a gun to someone that I don't know without a background Check- But if I was going to do a Year Manditory- I wouldn't do it- See that's why we have Laws.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 In the case of guns, diversion from licit possession and exchange can occur in a variety of ways: theft, purchase at a gun show by an interstate trafficker, private sales where no questions are asked, straw purchases by girlfriends and so forth.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Evidence-https://t.co/F8hP9oKveK
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Facts Matter- About six in ten “crime guns” seized by Chicago Police originated from gun shops outside of Illinois, according to a 2017 report issued by the department.
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 No Actuaully they don't and there is LOTS of evidence that the guns get to Chicago from outside the state- The Private Transfer is the real issue- NO GUN should be sold to ANYONE that can't pass a background check-Period- https://t.co/7vIlJmDdoL
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 The concept of Bayonet Lug vs Not was just BS the NRA wrote in.  I'm less concerned with What Weapon vs Who can own it.
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 Stop- the Definition was created by Gun Lobbyist to intentionally be confusing- Any Semi Auto Pistol or Rifle- it's really Simple- You hunt?  Well States that don't allow Semi Autos- you aren't confused by that law- so That's pretty obvious- we all get the point.
@89Ramcharger360 @charliekirk11 Nope- yep- NO PRIVATE SALES- NO TRANSFERS without a Background Check not even to your kids-  You see the guy in the Alley can legally sell that gun in a private Transfer- So that too must end
@Cerus98 @charliekirk11 Yes they get them from your neighbouring states that have lax laws- But you know that- So if it isn't actually Universal it doesn't work- and If the law was -if you get caught with a gun without a Background Check it's a year Mandatory- U couldn't sell to strangers.
@realDonaldTrump U.S. to permanently lose $3 billion due to shutdown		What are your thoughts?		Join the discussion here: https://t.co/MgcDTvf5a2
@charliekirk11 And I bet you know exactly which guns she's talking about- with that Term too- Huh?  You really aren't confused- It's like Q Tip- Kleenex-  we all get what she means-  But you're for Universal Background Checks for ALL GUN OWNERS right? Not just new purchases. Right?
@_Proud_American @charliekirk11 Well- maybe only people that can actually pass a Background Check can have ANY GUN at all- we'll weed out some of the "Bad Guys"  and rerun them every three years-to keep them up to date.  Bet that would slow down the number of dead some.  You are for Background Checks right?
@charliekirk11 Gee Charlie- maybe we can first start with Universal Gun Checks- not only to purchase a Gun- but to own one? Re run them automatically ever 3 years to keep it. Oh wait- it's not the Gun that kills it's the ex Good Guy that turns Bad Guy- So No-one gets a gun without one.

@73SNAngel @MrsRobe21241883 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No she was talking about the FLOTUS
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No they like no health care working for less money watching the POTUS get caught with undocumented workers in his homes and letting the rich avoid paying their taxes. You're an idiot
@CharlieDaniels Hey Charlie if your house catches fire will you be calling that socialist fire department? Did you complain when you went to public school? Oh Charlie you're against unions? Like cops teachers firefighters they suck too right? You're really a fascist right?
@CharlieDaniels Did you read that in your "public library"? You getting your Social security check and using Medicare? You writing off that Mortgage interest Charlie? You're a Socialist
@CharlieDaniels Holocaust Remembrance day  hey Charlie repeated after me "First they came for the Socialist and I did nothing" you'd make a great white nationalist Charlie. #goldstardad
@h8Wankmaggot45 You keep thinking that Trump will be running after they indict his kid?
@MarkSalter55 Just remember on Holocaust Remembrance day. There will always be a group of people too stupid to spot the con. You just prove every day that killing off the intellectual, the educated and the Socialist leaves the morons in power.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Nope. "I'll take the Mantle, Chuck" Donald Trump
@SteveScalise Yes and you support the white nationalist POTUS  remember Sir. First they came for the Socialist and you did nothing.
@CatFanRod @FULtiltBoogIE @MJGBoston @EricTrump Or they could have brought the bipartisan immigration bill to the floor years ago and this all would have been done with in 2010. You do know that right?

@JudgeJeanine If you're so good at spotting liars explain this https://t.co/Kr6FyvKdkS
@bamahoney62 @JudgeJeanine Yes did you know her husband went to prison for tax fraud and she was spending the money the whole  time. If she is so smart you'd think she would have noticed her husband lol https://t.co/Kr6FyvKdkS
@yellar12 @JudgeJeanine Really what was it that Trey Gowdy and Chaffetz found? Please provide the crime that wasn't investigated that they are guilty of?
@TewTerry @Nepiddd @JudgeJeanine Except she got 3 million more votes. Only 70k over 3 states targeted with info provided by Manafort and the Mercer's Cambridge Analytica to the Russians were actually swayed because they were obviously stupid.  You do know that has already proven. Try to keep up with indictment
@JudgeJeanine Really? That's funny coming from someone whose husband went to prison for tax fraud.  So judge what exactly did Hillary lie about? Seems you know something 30 yrs of tax returns and investigations didnt find.
@SenToomey Yep and you support that white nationalist potus. Remember first they came for the Socialists. And you did nothing.

@IanPark64237861 @ChrisSalcedoTX @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Oh I get it- but since Trump pretty much followed Obama's plan- by letting the People in the Region fight with our Training and Air Support- Seem my point is 100% valid-  We saved 100s of Soldiers lives 100s of WIA just by forcing people to fight for themselves.
@IanPark64237861 @ChrisSalcedoTX @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Hey you read this?  Turns out Orange Man is actually bad-  https://t.co/B2hmcp0AcL
@IanPark64237861 @ChrisSalcedoTX @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Yep- except NOW because we left- They took responsibility for fighting for their OWN Country-  I know that because I actually asked the Iraqi ambassador on live TV. and he actually admitted it. https://t.co/j11MAUx8Qh
@IrelandMichael @Dave_in_LA @ChrisSalcedoTX That's why we fight- because, somethings- Anything that validates Trump's Presidency is likely to be a criminal act- If u support Trump- then you support a Criminal Felon. Not much middle ground after 2 years- If ur on the Trump team now-ur wrong

@IrelandMichael @Dave_in_LA @ChrisSalcedoTX Michael- it's an easy question- My point is you want people to get along treat each other nice- Yet one side believes Brown People are Rapists Drug Dealers and Job Stealers- One side believes if you don't follow their God you don't belong here.

@IrelandMichael @Dave_in_LA @ChrisSalcedoTX LOL- yes and polls say that 90% of the GOP support a Felon -Self Admitted Sexual Predator-Pathological Liar as POTUS- that knowingly worked with a foreign power to subvert our election-  So we should agree with them so we can be nice?

@bigbadant LOL- yes and that included everyone she emailed and what they recovered from other places- Funny- If there was a real issue- they would have found plenty- But NOPE-  So unless you have different Evidence- seems there were ZERO.

@BuckSexton The median, or middle, income in 2016 for all households was $59,039, according to the U.S. Census Bureau - family plans averaged $833 per month. average deductible for family plans was $7,983." ($18,000) - Now look what 45% (what average Danes pays) does. https://t.co/ppLuE8MoKV
@BuckSexton "Broadly speaking, "single-payer programs abroad are far more cost-effective than American medical care and cost much less," Oberlander said."  https://t.co/nqZtkLcNWc
@BuckSexton Math isn't ur thing?-When we add in the costs of obesity and the drug costs listed above, we land at around $6,862 per person on average in the United States. That's a total savings of around $1,851 per person; $600 billion overall, or about 21.2% of the total cost of healthcare
@BuckSexton the United States is projected to spend $7.65 trillion annually on health care by 2031, according to the Mercatus study. That number would drop to $7.35 trillion if Sanders's plan were implemented, the study found. Over time, that adds up to a net savings of about $2.1 trillion.

@ric_stanford @SteveScalise @POTUS Yes-  So The Dems are all on with two bills that will open the Government- doesn't seem like much of an emergancy on their part- Seems it's the GOP that want's it closed. Not the Dems.  Just vote to open the Government
@mikeyj4460 @gatewaypundit So how many companies have you owned? How many employees have you employed? Since you can't afford your healthcare you think your grandparents are just sucking off the system.  You must be a success

Got it.
@mikeyj4460 @gatewaypundit So again-do you have Health Insurance and who pays for it?  You do understand the question? Clearly you have studied these things in your many years of life.

@RaptureGlory @brithume LOL  that's it -LOL  Bahahaha  https://t.co/PpRP9GcjOJ
@brithume Hey Brit- will you find the time to mention-that the POTUS is underinvestigation for hiring undocumented Immigrants at his Golf Course?  Come on you were going to skip over that right?  https://t.co/PpRP9GcjOJ
@DeplorableTrump We owe these kids action but you didn't do squat for them- You're a Coward-a Liar and a Tax Fraud- We'll be doing something Soon enough- locking you and your grifter kids away- https://t.co/xy4NWS22QT
@Sen_JoeManchin @SenCapito @MarshalluPres @SCClemons @SenatorSinema @SenatorRomney @facebook Hey Joe- did you actually apologize for that Congresswoman?   Because that is just BS- I don't remember you saying a word about thes coments?  https://t.co/npFtXNQwGQ
@jordanwfisher_ I think they are busy hiding the Undocumented Workers that stole the Jobs of Americans at his Golf Course  https://t.co/PpRP9GcjOJ
@realDonaldTrump LOL- Sure prove the Documents
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump They Live Rent Free in the Empty Room in his head
@ChrisSalcedoTX @MittRomney @TheDemocrats LOL  - But it's okay in a Pathological-Lying-Tax Fraud Felon does it LOL- Hey have you noticed even ONE LIE yet from him?  https://t.co/npFtXO885q
@seanhannity Hey Sean- Your worth Millions- what do you care?  It's Trump's Shut Down- At least she's doing her job and likely pays her Taxes- Hey wil you be discussing this on your show? I guess the dirt bag POTUS- is okay if the Undocumented workers work for him huh? https://t.co/PpRP9GcjOJ
@JohnCornyn I do believe that there wasn't a WALL in that discussion- But you can pretend that there was and continue to compare Oranges to Apples- but that just makes you look stupid.
@SamSteffen4 @SabrinaCath @MichelleMcC2353 @WilliamR1961 @LindseyGrahamSC @TuckerCarlson @MichaelAvenatti Okay- but that is based on opinion- not what the investigation found-

@JackKingston Seems a bit hypocritical to be talking about the Dems and the Problem with Undocumented Immigrants when the POTUS routinely lies and breaks the law? https://t.co/zPhZLyTmeF
@JackKingston Hey Jack- What laws stop this?  https://t.co/jSeaRVN3Rr
@JackKingston Here Jack- https://t.co/VMTmWKEig8
@JackKingston Lol- You really are clueless- and the funny thing about "Kate" they proved it was an accident- But if the GOP actually cared about kids being killed maybe Univeral Background Check?  Hey Jack- explain this okay? Because we already have a law for this- https://t.co/oFEcJUkFI9
RT @ChrisMurphyCT: This is SO confusing.		The wall's already built?		Or do you still need $5B for the wall?		Is Mexico still paying for it?…
@nanking2100 Yes giving more to the rich has historically made the Poor better off-right?  You had to have learned that in your homeschool class right?
@nanking2100 Well- I must be the indoctrinated one you are talking about- did you figure that out yourself or did you read about it in your "Public" Library?
@nanking2100 So it's the Dems that want power by giving state-sponsored education for 16 years vs 12?  And Universal Health Care to the citizens of the country? And funding infrastructure?  So when we let Millionaires skip paying taxes that gives the"People" power?
@don_lemmond @Jim_Jordan @POTUS PS  You don't know me well enough to know where my head is- but clearly, the concept of going upstairs to turn the water off in the tub instead of staying downstairs mopping as the water pours out of your ceiling light has escaped you.
@don_lemmond @Jim_Jordan @POTUS Don, are the poor hungry brown people taking your Job and your stuff? Hey did you see this?  https://t.co/3Zq2sI2SRy
@don_lemmond @Jim_Jordan @POTUS Gee is there a Bill waiting for the Senate? Oh yes that's right- the Senate is not voting on it? Who runs the Senate again? hmmm https://t.co/kIhA0V71Bs
@SenatorRomney Sir,  We get you find such language over the edge. But- sometimes the best way to deal with a Bully is Punch him right in the face.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey Huck- did you call this a lie? YET? https://t.co/FjThiHfb84
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey - you mean being an unindicted Conspirator in a felony and Tax Fraud- isn't enough?  Don't worry - we can count on him lying on his (In his own words) answers to Mueller's Questions.  and when they subpoena Don Jrs phone call to him about the Russians-
It's all right here where you left it https://t.co/sn6YWEpcDs

@SamSteffen4 @SabrinaCath @MichelleMcC2353 @WilliamR1961 @LindseyGrahamSC @TuckerCarlson @MichaelAvenatti So I guess he didn't actually Beat anyone.  So I guess you are mistaken-
@bigbadant So can we do it better for less? Are there too many Middle Men?  Are the Law Suits just increasing the cost?  Do we spend too much on end of life?  Does money from Big Pharma and Law Firms cause us to pay more for less?

@JackKingston @RepSwalwell @CNN LOL- Really?  I guess being an unindicted Conspirator to a felony and Tax Fraud isn't a good place to start?  Well, Let's get him under oath and see if there is something he'd like to Lie under oath about?   Seems Fair.

Gee u don't even know what exactly you want or how much it costs?  But you sure want it-because you're afraid of Something? https://t.co/xbvaUYVDFO
@Linda45982799 @LouDobbs Invasion LOL  I guess math and logic aren't actually important when you get that old huh?   First he continues to lie that he's actually built any wall-  Does it matter that Trump has only spent 6 percent of the ‘wall’ money?https://t.co/gg0sdCnAuA https://t.co/llPUfBBmLf
