Hearing is over. It was excellent. Hopefully this will continue progress to make this bill a reality /end
‚ÄúIn Kentucky, you must wear the scarlet letter of F. We can remove that scarlet letter with this bill.‚Äù @jmnemes 19/
.@jmnemes notes that on cost, the bill should actually help the state. With former felons able to vote, they are also more likely to work and generate tax dollars. 18/
Discussion about it will take to convince KY Senate to pass the bill. It‚Äôs passed the House previously. Rep Meeks notes that it will take grassroots support. 17/
Sponsors now taking questions. As for exceptions to who receives vote back, @GeorgeBrownKY77 says he wants to come back with clean bill that wouldn‚Äôt exclude anyone. 16/
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt model democracy and good citizenship to my daughters.‚Äù 15/
‚ÄúWe should rephrase the question: it‚Äôs not why do we have the right to vote. It‚Äôs why do we have the power to take away the right to vote.‚Äù 14/
Notable: the former felons testifying are people of color. Makes sense given the disproportionate impact felon disenfranchisement has on minority communities. 13/
‚ÄúI ask this committee to consider what a second chance really means.‚Äù 12/

Finally, we must include *everyone* in that process. Ultimately, I still want to convince that person to look at facts and embrace expanded voting rights. Maybe it's naive, but I still think I can convince him. And I won't give up until I do. /end
That, in turn, requires sustained advocacy. I still fundamentally believe we can change minds. Maybe it won't happen during a short exchange while standing in line, but that doesn't mean we should give up. A stronger democratic process *is* possible, but we must work for it. 17/
Let's let ideas, not election rules, dictate outcomes, with all eligible voters participating. Isn't that what democracy is supposed to be about? 16/
This is a problem that doesn't have an easy solution. Election law policy is all too partisan. But to fix our system, we need people like this nice gentleman to understand the real facts and the power of making easy for every *eligible* person to vote. 15/
Fourth, we should look for positive voting rights policies that cross the partisan divide. Felon re-enfranchisement and independent redistricting commissions generally have bipartisan support. Sure, there's still politics involved, but let's take wins where we can. 14/
Third, of course we need to continue calling out the lies about voter fraud with truthful statements. We can't let up in the effort to offer truthful information. We also must engage young people in this effort, who can be true change agents. 13/
This person may not have believed me, a stranger, but maybe he will listen to a family member or friend who has felt the impact of voter suppression or, even better, seen the benefits of positive reforms that open up the system. That's why my book focuses on stories. 12/
Second, we need to tell more stories of individuals impacted. Stories of everyday Americans can be so powerful. This also means that we need to encourage likeminded people to tell their own stories to spread the message. 11/
This way my friend in line can't plausibly claim that my viewpoints are driven by partisanship. 10/
This is why I've stopped donating to candidates and generally try to stay nonpartisan in my public commentary. Of course, people will see my support of policies through a partisan lens, but the scholarship and commentary itself should stay politically neutral. 9/
Although I don't have the magic answer, here are some thoughts:		First, though some may disagree, I think experts should stay as politically neutral as possible. We should embrace and promote policies that are good for the election system regardless of which side might benefit.8/
He wasn't willing to listen to the actual facts from someone who has studied this area. So what can we do to convince the general public to embrace positive voting rights reforms and not lies about voter fraud? 7/
What can we do to reach people like him? I confess not to know the answer. Facts didn't seem to matter. He had his own version of the truth in his head, no doubt informed by what he hears from @senatemajldr and others (not to mention lies from @realDonaldTrump). 6/
I again said this wasn't true and suggested he read the bill itself. Thus ended our exchange.		I've been thinking about this conversation ever since. This person was clearly educated and smart, yet he had fallen into the "voter fraud" trap. 5/
Then he said "and did you see that the Democrats want to let *anyone* vote with their new bill?" I responded, "well, they just want to make it easier for all *eligible* people to vote." He said "no, they just want anyone to vote." 4/
I asked what he meant. He said, "well, didn't you see a few years ago that kid in North Carolina who went on TV and said he voted 17 times?" I assured him that that couldn't be true and if it was, he would have been prosecuted. The man just shook his head. 3/
I was in line at the @KentuckyMBB game (that loss is another story!) when an older gentleman asked what I did for work and I explained that I'm a law professor specializing in voting rights and election law. His immediate reaction was "so you see how much voter fraud there is."2/

@imillhiser @DouthatNYT Exactly. There‚Äôs probably a small impact on turnout and none on fraud prevention given lack of in person impersonation. So real question is why we should impose any burden on fundamental right to vote with no justification.

I did a thread for @senatemajldr. Please read and share if you're interested. https://t.co/X25dQ1VdbG
For those who really want to read it, here's a link to McConnell's Op-Ed. 		And here's a link to my @CNN @CNNOpinion piece inviting him to my class: https://t.co/XMgwXeOYsn		/end
So, Senator, I say it again: please come to my Election Law class. I recognize that it's politics-all-the-way-down for you, but at least come to the debate with some actual facts, not falsehoods and misrepresentations. 17/
Finally, Senator McConnell ends with a nice sounding phrase: "I hope every eligible voter exercises their fundamental right to vote at every opportunity." If you did--if you *really* wanted to expand voter participation, you would support H.R. 1. 16/
Is there any *principled* argument against that provision of the bill? I'm asking a serious question, Senator. I haven't heard one. "Letting Kentuckians decide" might make sense if our elected leaders would actually do so. 15/
It also found that Kentuckians, by a 2 to 1 margin, favor felon re-enfranchisement.		The problem is that entrenched and partisan interests won't change the rules. They are afraid of losing their political power and doing the right thing. So H.R. 1 would do it for them. 14/
As @LWVKY recently found, KY disenfranchises 1 of every 4 African-Americans in the state: https://t.co/jzoOrWKziu 13/
After reforms in other states (including FL this past November), only Kentucky and Iowa disenfranchise felons for life. Felon disenfranchisement takes away a fundamental aspect of citizenship, disproportionately harming African-Americans in particular. 12/
Then we reach the issue of felon disenfranchisement, where Kentucky is one again an outlier (not in a good way): He writes, "Washington Democrats would also take away a state‚Äôs ability to decide whether and how it may restore voting rights for felons." 		Yes, thank goodness. 11/
Plus, as anyone who has studied the issue knows, bloated voter registration rolls do not equal voter fraud. Far from it. 10/
Senator McConnell repeats the claim that automatic voter registration would lead to error and duplication. But let's not forget that the Wash Post had to issue a major correction to your Op-Ed about the amount of fraud in CA from AVR 9/
He notes that H.R. 1 "would determine when and where Kentuckians vote." Considering that Kentucky has no early voting and the polls are open for only 12 hours, from 6 am to 6 pm, why is expanding convenience for voters such a bad thing? 8/
Plus, as anyone who has studied the issue knows, voter ID laws simply don't root out any kind of voter fraud. The examples of voter fraud the Senator mentions involved absentee balloting. Would he like to make the rules for absentee balloting stricter? I didn't think so. 7/
He says that "Washington Democrats would overturn our voter ID requirements." Actually, Senator, this is one area where Kentucky isn't that bad; it does not have a strict voter ID law and numerous types of IDs suffice. 6/
Next, he writes that the Democrats, including @SpeakerPelosi, "believe San Francisco and Washington D.C. know better than Kentucky how to run an election." Well, given that Kentucky has one of the most restrictive election laws in the country, maybe they're on to something. 5/
Senator McConnell writes: "I‚Äôm sure that in some corners, I‚Äôll be derided for referencing the Constitution at all.‚Äù No, Senator, you're derided when you don't accurately quote the Constitution and leave out an important phrase to make your one-sided argument. 4/
That is, the Constitution *explicitly provides* for Congress to regulate elections. It's how Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act (Motor Voter) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002. 3/
He says Framers of our "Constitution... gave states the responsibility to administer elections." He's leaving out a crucial part of Article I, Section 4: states determine the "Times, Places and Manner" --&gt;"but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations"2/

@ProfTolson Fair enough. But Murphy's dissent in Korematsu is just as strong (if not stronger), and even more so given that the majority's opinion in 1944 is perhaps even more galling than Plessy given the times (though both are equally reprehensible).
We hear lots about Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy as a great example of foresight and anti-discrimination. But why isn't Justice Murphy's dissent in Korematsu similarly revered? It's also prophetic and enlightened. 		"I dissent...from this legalization of racism."

@Profepps @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA I guess. She was making a very specific point to say that it was a ‚Äúlegal‚Äù win and nothing more. But the entire interview was part of her ‚Äúrhetoric‚Äù on this topic.

@joshchafetz Again, then she should take legal actions to challenge that legitimacy. If she loses that battle, then perhaps she has an even stronger argument. But this was done essentially as part of her concession a day after the election was resolved. Cf Al Gore, Dec. 13, 2000.

@Profepps @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA I think so given that she was asked directly.
@joshchafetz Because it undermines people's perceptions about the legitimacy of our elections. I find that normatively problematic for the loser not to accede to the winner legitimately holding the position. But now I'm just repeating myself so we may just be talking past each other.
@joshchafetz Again, for me it's not as much about the message itself as the messenger delivering it. I think that makes a big difference.
@joshchafetz Then she should contest the election result.
@ssamcham @joshchafetz Perhaps that's right. It still doesn't mean I have to like it. :)
@joshchafetz Many people can question the legitimacy of the electoral process. I do it all the time! My point is that it's harmful for the *loser* to do it and not recognize the legitimacy of the winner.
@joshchafetz True, not a lie in the same way. But it still undermines the legitimacy of our democratic processes. And that's just as harmful no matter who is saying it.
Look, I speak out against Trump and many other R's who use false claims of voter fraud, which undermine the legitimacy of our democracy. 		I'll do the same if Dems use rhetoric I find inappropriate for democratic legitimacy, even if I may agree with the underlying point. https://t.co/kDiJtC0Kop
@joshchafetz @staceyabrams @BrianKempGA So the answer is to claim the victor is not a legitimate victor? 		No; the answer is to fight back against the rules that you think made the outcome undemocratic.
@rickhasen I also may be writing something on this precise point from my tweet regarding Abrams's statement. Was curious what the initial reaction from twitter world would be. 		It's as I expected.
@ssamcham @rickhasen If that's so, I still find it unfortunate. I'd prefer "he's the legitimate governor-elect of Georgia under the rules of this election. But those rules are morally wrong and we must change them."		As she said in that interview, words matter.

@DLeonhardt @YesMomsCan Couple that w/ same day registration/automatic voter registration &amp; Vote Centers for those who want to vote in person on Election Day (anywhere in county), and you have recipe for much higher turnout.

@RevDrBarber @BRepairers Yes! We must work on voter expansion for all voters, not just combating voter suppression (though that obviously is extremely important). Both are vital to a well functioning democracy.
Here's @staceyabrams lawsuit in Georgia asking for (1) counting 1,095 absentee ballots that were rejected in Gwinnett County and accepting absentee ballots in other counties and (2) extension of deadline for voters to cure provisional ballots to Nov. 14		https://t.co/SUByzXr6jr
@YesMomsCan @DLeonhardt Early voting is fine, but studies show that it hasn't drastically improved turnout (yet). A better idea is universal vote-by-mail/vote at home. The places that have it show the highest turnout rates.
@DLeonhardt Great column. One addition: it‚Äôs sometimes best to start with local laws &amp; local grassroots movements‚Äîas many of these reforms have already. With apologies for a self-plug, we need to hear these stories of local democracy champions, as I tell them here https://t.co/YFaZBKIoTR
This is an incredible column, including this gem about AMI's actions: "But when the media duck does not quack like a duck and the actions taken are distinctly not ducklike, those legal protections fall away." https://t.co/hWWncuCUFO
All of these post-election processes show again the absurdity of having election officials who are elected &amp; explicitly partisan. Even when they do their jobs fairly (as most are), it opens door to argue bias in a process that both sides must see as fair to maintain legitimacy.

@ForecasterEnten And Crawford was a consequence of Kit Bond claiming voter fraud caused John Ashcroft to lose to Mel Carnahan in the 2000 Missouri Senate election. Bond pushed voter ID bill into HAVA, and states like IN and GA then followed suit. Modern ‚Äúconcern‚Äù amplified by SCOTUS allowing.
@ElectProject @ForecasterEnten Well, sure. But in the modern era of voter fraud claims a lot can be traced to Crawford.

"Nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue &amp; corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican gov't might naturally have been expected to make their approaches...chiefly from the desire in foreign powers..."
