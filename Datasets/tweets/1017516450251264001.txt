@EllenPage You're another 'Celebrity' using the LGBT Community for monetary gain. You talk about 'Love to all!' But, where'd this attack come from? I'm a Christian,  I go to church. That doesn't mean I support Hatred.  Or, that I'm somehow responsible for how the Church operates.
@EllenPage To be honest, I've never heard of you. You're piggybacking off Chris's success. I don't know what his religion has to do with him. Do you have proof of Chris physically saying or doing anything towards The LGBT Community? I don't think you do.
