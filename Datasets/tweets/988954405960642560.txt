Brimstones past the clouds 	Highlight against the ocean line	Beautiful sunset, warm texture	Warning, the rooster's asleep!		Glorious yellow and orange mixture 	My source of great inspiration	Unmatch - beauty mark In the sky	The horizon is ready for nightfall ,
Standing firm 	we live 	we give 	we take 	we learn 	we make sure 	every day enlightens us 	and brightens us 	as each day takes its turn,
Just when situations arise 	flooding us with pain we despise	and just when it seems like	our tear ducts are dry 	from ongoing cries	we may think 	things are on the brink of ending	then God shows us the ways of faith	by way of love that he's sending,
I am knowledge beyond measure because that is my right	So I continue meeting the different parts of me	when I meditate and write	Who am I?	I AM, THAT, I AM
I am the rhythm that the wind blows	I am the beginning and the ending of stories told	about the universe and how miracles unfold	I hold the power to accept judgement from those who will do just that	Not knowing that I am them in the absolute reality of me	Judge that
I am the green you get when you mix too much yellow with the blue	That shade of gold you get when the sun resides into darkness	and when it ascends in the dawn burning dew	I am the transition between the third and fourth dimension of time;	the love you feel when you realize how,
I am constant energy	Translating personal experience into imagery 	Vulnerable to tyranny,	yet i continue attempting to share some truth	through this abstract language of poetry		I am the core	I am that I am more	I am the Divine Presence that is the Source of my rewards,
I am the heir of omnipotence,	born with a direct connection to profound abundance 	The one whose words will age, yet still have substance;	since there are no boundaries attached to my pen,
I am the ring around Saturn	spinning words as particles of ice and dust	with the power to transcend,		I am the original chosen to be right here right now	transmitting verbal frequencies 	through speaking my thoughts into existence
Man has differences	Man has opinions.	That is the way 	The human race is run.	God is only ONE GOD	However we see him.	He's one for all,	So that all can be ONE.
So why all this predjudice	Because of colour?	Why all this thinking 	There's a chosen race?	Why are we fighting 	In the name of religion?	When surely God wears 	Every human face.
God is all creeds	And he is no creed.	He lives in the Muslim	And He lives in the Jew.	He's there in the Hindu,	The Christian, the Buddhist.	In all true believers	And the doubters too,
God is all colours	And He is no colour,	For He lives in the black	And He lives in the white.	He lives in the mixed,red	Olive, brown and yellow,	For He lives in the heart	Where colours out of sight.
A world,	Of acceptance 	Of respect 	Of justice 	Of equality	Of love	And 	Of universal brotherhood		So as 		With peace in our hearts, liberated we 	Would be from	Past’s deleterious tribulations	That 	For myriads of years, have kept us, fighting	One another!
Obliterating harmful beliefs 	Demolishing injurious divisions	Destroying detrimental distrust 	Annihilating racism and	Eradicating the erroneous feeling of	Poisonous superiority 	For to
Listen to me, my other self,	It is up to us to change this world, we	Have inherited, with its:	Virtues and vices	History and culture 	Flaws and merits 	And	Try to make it 	Better	Nobler 	Kinder and a more	Caring world🗽🌄🎇
So thankful am I that these brown eyes can see.	This heavenly picture God has painted for me.
When the storm clouds boil around me, 	And the lightning splits the sky--. 	When the howling wind assails me,	And life's sea is rolling high--	When my heart is filled with terror,	And my fears, I can't allay-	Then I find sweet peace and comfort, 	When I simply stop and pray.🌅
When the things of life confound me,	And my faith is ebbing low--	When my trusted friends betray me,	And my heart is aching so--	When the night seems black and endless,	And I long for light of day--	Then I find a silver dawning,	When I simply stop and pray.🌈🌈🌈🌈
There are things beyond the heavens	I can't begin to understand,	But I know that God is living,	And I know He holds my hand.	Yes, I know He watches o'er me	All the night and all the day--	And He's always there to hear me❤️🧡💚💙💜🖤💗💖	When I simply stop and pray.
