Mark Meadows just doesn‚Äôt get it.  To use a black woman essentially as an exhibit was, at best, insensitive.  Jim Jordan‚Äôs focus on Rod Rosenstein is classic obfuscation. Yes, Cohen has lied. He‚Äôs a criminal.   But he was a chief aide to your President. Awful day for Republicans
And by the way.  Another reason to fight partisan gerrymandering. https://t.co/jtWIuzifFg
Jordan feels he has to attack the FBI and federal law enforcement to defend Trump. When it comes to credibility the men and women at the FBI/DOJ are far more believable than Trump, Meadows, Gosar or Jordan. They did NOTHING for two years. They can‚Äôt handle the truth now

The power, tenacity and patriotism of West Indian Americans.  All of my grandparents and my father were born in Barbados.  All of these immigrants helped to make this nation better. My relatives helped build the Panama Canal and served in both World Wars. https://t.co/JrgQR9jV0S
Time to make Electoral College a vestige of the past. It‚Äôs undemocratic, forces candidates to ignore majority of the voters and campaign in a small number of states. The presidency is our one national office and should be decided - directly - by the voters https://t.co/OyRbXOiBpz
A good reform measure to support. Change the Electoral College by having a state‚Äôs electoral votes go to the national popular vote winner - not the person who won the state. The candidate who gets the most votes - nationally - is elected. Real democracy.  https://t.co/tPfNWdKQ46

A resignation here would be correct but is not an appropriate end to this matter. We still need to have a difficult and necessary conversation about how racism and racist symbols still pervade too much of our society - and the pain they cause. What have we learned as a nation?
I have come to know Ralph Northam as a good, very decent man.  I regretfully conclude that he does not now have the ability to effectively govern and effectively stand for the issues - moral and political - that Virginia and the nation must confront. The Governor should resign.
Wrong. HR1 fights corruption, restores voting rights, and takes on gerrymandering. This tells you all you need to know about the two parties: Democrats want THE PEOPLE to decide who serves in government. Republicans favor special interests &amp; want to make it harder for you to vote https://t.co/ADtROem55k
A person who is pardoned can be put in a grand jury and asked about everything, including the acts for which he was pardoned.  Obliged to tell the truth-or perjury charges. A president - through use of the pardon power - cannot therefore insulate himself.
We simply don‚Äôt know when Mueller probe will end. Congress doesn‚Äôt have to wait-Coordinate with special counsel so as not to harm inquiry. But start oversight hearings (not impeachment) on all the issues Republicans ignored. See where the evidence takes us-The people need to know
