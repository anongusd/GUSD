I think the 2 people who guessed 10.4 °F are feeling a little foolish for not checking out the NASA website. Keep in mind that in 1880 the Earth had just come out of a mini ice age; so we would expect the next cycle to warm a little: 1.4 °F in 138 years 🔥 #GreenDeal #climatescam

@Lrihendry Thank you, Lori @Lrihendry. The President had no choice is ending the partial shutdown. Once RINO Republicans like Mitt Romney caved and began voting for the Democrat bills, there was no other option. The President is giving #NanChuck 3 weeks. We WILL get the Wall.
It’s amazing when low information Leftists call support for the Venezuelan opposition a “coup”. 🤔 Does @AOC understand that the corrupt Maduro government is completely illegitimate? The opposition wasn’t even permitted to participate in the last election. https://t.co/VSLgSv7qpX
I have some questions for Comrade Bill de Blasio: If the money in the U.S. is “in the wrong hands”, who exactly are the “right hands” and how does he propose we get it there? Comrades Chavez &amp; Maduro confiscated wealth in Venezuela. How is Socialism working out there? @NYCMayor https://t.co/IFoTPih0CO
In the Country with the World’s largest oil reserves, 8.2 million Venezuelans can barely afford 2 low nutrition meals a day with little protein; 6 in 10 have lost 24 lbs of body weight; and one child dies of malnutrition nearly every day. THIS is Socialism https://t.co/zYv9gNtuHN

Guess who’s Florida Senator Ben Nelson’s lawyer for this Vote recount? Marc Elias of Perkins Cole, who secretly handled payments for the HIllary Campaign to Fusion GPS for the infamous Steele dossier. He’s also behind a multi-state lawsuit fighting Voter ID Laws. Surprised? https://t.co/a7KyyNJk8E
The South Florida Sun Sentinel reported 24,700 ballots in Broward County had the Governor’s race selected but nothing for U.S. Senate. Putting aside voter ignorance, is anyone making certain that no election officials are illegally filling in those blanks? https://t.co/3DQGndmtQG
Just read an article on Left- leaning https://t.co/h65dkhfG10, which called the Voting scandal going on in Democrat- controlled Broward, Palm Beach &amp; Miami-Dade Counties “shenanigans”.

@ChrisCuomo Speaking of my parents: my Dad, when he was stationed at Fort Benning, GA, during the Jim Crow era, refused to sit in the front of a bus w/ other white passengers. He was severely reprimanded by his CO. He spoke w/ pride of the incident. So your comments are personally offensive.
@ChrisCuomo By the way, the Unemployment rate for Hispanics &amp; Latinos in the United States, aged 16 and up, is now 4.6%, the lowest on record. That’s what people want to hear about. Please try use your very public position to bring people together, not divide them.
@ChrisCuomo Dear Chris: how do we create a color-blind society if you continually race-bait? I’m the grandson of legal immigrants on both sides of my family from Ireland &amp; Eastern Europe. Your comments suggesting that people who want LEGAL immigration are somehow racist is beyond offensive.
Chris Cuomo suggests that Republicans want to stop the Honduran migrant “caravan” because they don’t like people who “don’t look like them”. Newsflash: @chriscuomo The GOP includes many Latinos whose lives have been greatly improved under this President and want LEGAL Immigration https://t.co/xJpQ2gO6Dk

If it were only the uneducated “resisters”, who never studied the Founders or the Constitution, disrespecting the Brett Kavanaugh hearing, I could cut them some slack.

Wow: Democrats get on a talking point &amp; sure stick with it. Despite receiving over 1 Million pages of documents on Brett Kavanaugh, more than every Justice on the current Supreme Court combined, it’s not enough. Dems don’t care about his Legal opinions. They just want dirt. 😩 https://t.co/qB7lALr9UW
For years we’ve been told (with no evidence) that the Democrat Party was the Party of Civility, Kindness &amp; Thoughtful Dialogue.

With potentially Millions of Non-Citizens ILLEGALLY voting, do you see the irony of spending $$ millions and countless media hours on this phony “Russian” election probe that didn’t change one Vote, but ignoring the REAL foreign election meddling? #StopNonCitizenVoting
We KNOW Non-Citizens are ILLEGALLY Voting. What would stop them? It’s a simple check on a box “I’m a Citizen”. Couple that with Activist Liberal Judges stopping Voter ID Laws, this could be MILLIONS of Illegal Votes. That’s why every Republican has to Vote https://t.co/QrH2uszW9G
The Voter Fraud just uncovered in Ohio’s 12 District is the tip of the iceberg. Without Voter ID laws, Democrats’ illegal activities such as busing people from other Districts go unchecked. But the biggest scandal is non-Citizen voting. Every Republican MUST VOTE this November! https://t.co/PDOavVw11N

The Media is going apoplectic over the President’s rejection of Robert Mueller’s request to do a face to face interview. Seriously! Mueller, who can’t find any evidence of Russian “collusion” wants to focus on “obstruction of justice” regarding a crime that didn’t take place. 🤣

Democrats say the radical Left has not taken over. Then how do you explain (1) Elizabeth Warren’s call to abolish I.C.E. (2) Why @MSNBC fawns over Congressional nominee Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? She belongs to the Democrat Socialists who want to abolish Borders, Prisons &amp; Profits https://t.co/Qwo6QBSvcF

MUST WATCH! Perhaps the most powerful video on YouTube today. Brandon Straka @usminority, the Gay hairdresser who founded the #WalkAway movement, eloquently &amp; powerfully explains why he left the Democrat Party. Share with your Liberal friends &amp; family. https://t.co/wGJMvKqcLU
David Tuck was enslaved by the Nazis &amp; is a concentration camp survivor. He has a message for those comparing US illegal immigrant facilities to the Holocaust: “They know nothing of the Holocaust... You can’t compare. Every time I hear it, it’s sickening.” https://t.co/gCP6oVNnXu

In a very little publicized ruling from the Supreme Court, a crazy California law that forced licensed pregnancy centers to advertise for state-funded abortion clinics, has been struck down as a violation of the 1st Amendment. #SCOTUS Hallelujah! https://t.co/QFNcqGh3PE

In spite of the fact that more Americans identify as Conservatives,  Liberals get elected because 95% of the National TV Network &amp; Local News, Cable News, Internet &amp; Radio News, plus Newspapers are biased toward Liberals. It’s amazing Conservatives are elected at all. #FakeNews https://t.co/doa5nOUkoc
Michael Moore told Stephen Colbert that “The majority of Americans are very liberal.” Sorry, @MMFlint: Polls taken by Gallup since 1992 show that more Americans identify as Conservative. Only 26% identify as Liberal. If they changed the Poll to “VERY Liberal”, it would be less. https://t.co/TAVeS87U2B
To our lunatic Leftist friends: keep screaming about abolishing ICE &amp; “Impeach 45”. Keep pushing for Open Borders. You will ensure that nearly EVERY Republican &amp; Conservative goes to the Polls in November, and the few remaining moderate Democrats will stay home. #RedWaveRising https://t.co/hBTb9bATlj
Federal Judge T.S. Ellis Slaps Down Robert Mueller AGAIN, Accuses him Of “Distasteful” Tactics &amp; Being a “Political Weapon”. “Even a blind person can see that the true target of the Special Counsel’s investigation is Pres. Trump, NOT [Paul Manafort]”. Yep. https://t.co/CI1gcbZirk
The Results of my Poll with 2,453 Votes: only 4% of Republicans would even CONSIDER voting for John Kasich @JohnKasich IF Pres. Trump did NOT run again.

I had hoped, for at least a day, Leftist Politicians &amp; media elites would focus on the victims &amp; families who suffered from the terrible shooting tragedy in Annapolis. 🙏🏼 Sadly, they can’t help themselves &amp; are already trying to blame the President 😩. https://t.co/LylcmLjE2L
John Kasich, who boycotted the GOP National Convention in 2016, held in his own State of Ohio, where he was Governor, is considering a Presidential run in 2020. Even in Donald Trump decided NOT to run again, would you Vote for Kasich in the Primary? Republicans Only. #JohnKasich

Many Democrats voted for Donald Trump. Many are now changing Party affiliation to GOP. In Calvert County, MD the # of Republicans has increased by 2,700 in 4 years, and now surpass Democrats. If Democrats continue their Left turn to Open Borders, they will become a minority Party
