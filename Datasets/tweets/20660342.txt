Trump, in call with supporters, also said he's received no calls pressuring him to abandon the wall fight. "In fact, if anything, people are very impressed with how well government is working with the circumstances that we're under," he said.
More Trump from today's call: "We're going to win. We're not going back until it's over. We're going to build this wall. It's going to happen. I've been promising. It has nothing to do with a campaign promise. It has to do with the fact that we need this for our country."
Trump told supporters on an afternoon call today that what he needs is unity. "Stay together. Be unified. We’re not going back until we get what we have to get." He said state and local leaders, grassroots activists, faith leaders and law enforcement officials were on the line.

If Trump ends up using an emergency declaration to try to build the wall, it is sure to draw a flood of legal challenges. Here’s a look at one of the statutes they’ve been eying and what it would allow him to do:  https://t.co/JYVLF1813c
Pentagon budget officials are currently analyzing the 2019 construction budget to determine how many unobligated dollars would be available to use for the wall if Trump settles on an emergency declaration to try to circumvent Congress  https://t.co/JYVLF1813c
“Absolutely it’s an abuse of power for the president to declare a national emergency when none exists and to use it to try to get around the democratic process,” she said. “But.... our legal system for emergency powers almost invites that kind of abuse.” https://t.co/JYVLF1813c
