@smalllights @geeesman Yes, he did downsize and move to a smaller location. But you can still find some gems :)
@smalllights @geeesman It's still open, but he keeps weird hours. My family has known him for over 30 years.
@smalllights @geeesman Oh and most importantly, my favorite used bookstores: https://t.co/gjUP5ocuH9	https://t.co/4Ipp3Qs4q9	https://t.co/hkFcqhZpus
@geeesman For a nice view of Santa Fe walk to the top of the Cross of the Martyrs.
@geeesman Hiking: Tent Rocks is incredible (45 min south of SF); Aspen Vista or one of the many hiking trails off of Hyde Park Road, which leads to the ski basin. After hiking you can stop here: https://t.co/E2Dgec5rIJ
@smalllights @geeesman As someone from Santa Fe, I agree with your recommendations 100%! For art, I also recommend checking out art spaces at the Santa Fe Railyard, and/or wandering around Canyon Road to check out galleries. Oh, and this lovely tea spot: https://t.co/wu6IN7Yolh
@geeesman For coffee: https://t.co/xEz9cRsPBN (Lena st is my fav - they have good food too)
@geeesman For drinking, Santa Fe Brewing Company or the Cowgirl
@geeesman Food: Cafe Pasqual's, La Choza, The Shed (I love sitting on their patio for lunch), Chocolate Maven for brunch, Tune-Up Cafe, Counterculture, Harry's. So many yummy options!
