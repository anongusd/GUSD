Watch for glysophate resistant weeds when planting soybeans. Common weeds to monitor are pigweed, waterhemp, Palmer amaranth, giant ragweed, kochia and horseweed. https://t.co/9DmUZV0gWk https://t.co/VyWtvkuDr8
Growers can increase side-dress rates if wet conditions and nitrogen losses are prevalent, or reduce side-dress rates if warm temperatures and less rainfall occur.https://t.co/HCzxxuAW7m https://t.co/zh9FvlNgf0
Weed herbicide resistance is a numbers game- the more plants exposed, the more chance of resistance developing. Crop rotation and herbicide rotation can help. More info available at https://t.co/iZNUM5w4HP https://t.co/FR9yuC6wlc
If nitrogen deficiency occurs during vegetative growth, yield losses may be severe. Side-dressing nitrogen by V4 to V6 is a common practice to help ensure that enough N is available to support rapid growth. https://t.co/YpJTb1B56h https://t.co/zEdTZecVGu
If weather interferes with the originally planned in-season nitrogen application, a quickly implemented backup plan can help avert significant nitrogen deficiency and yield loss https://t.co/qo6aEYvObG
