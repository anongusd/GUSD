REPEAT AFTER ME: #JUSTICEKAVANAUGH...!
#WeAreKavanaugh
Abuse no one and nothing, for  abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the Spirit of its Vision. - Tecumseh
Show respect to all  people and bow to none. When you arise in the morning, give thanks for   the food and for the Joy of Living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself.
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the Great  Divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a  Friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place.
Love your life, Perfect your life,  Beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its  purpose in the service of your people.
Live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart.  Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours.

I WILL GO AFTER SOMEONE YOU KNOW...!  THEY will destroy you and ANYONE you hold near and dear. Chinese social scoring and control. THINK hard about the digital footprint of yours and those near to you.
And we won’t ALONE destroy you BUT EVERYONE near to you. This is tactic #2. You might not care what THEY do TO YOU. BUT remember how Kavanaugh responded to when Blumenthal mentioned a girl Kavanaugh knew?  Blumenthal decided , I might not get thru to you on an attack on you , SO
If you do NOT do ‘as we tell you’ we WILL DESTROY YOU...!  With your own digital footprint. LEARN. Talk to your family about footprint reduction. Start to teach yourselves tough skin and your children TOUGHER skin. Learn the counter to the inevitable.
What jokes have you told. Did you lock your sister in a closet when you were younger?  Is it all captured in the age of tech and the selfie?  Learn and think HARD about digital footprints. Think about the Chinese social scoring policy being rolled out.
If there is a lesson at the slaughtering of Kavanaugh (lamb) is how to prepare ourselves and kids to the control the powerful have in a digital age. What Halloween costumes were worn at a party you attended?  Did you stumble and fall in the bushes after too much beer?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?  What has been witnessed as an attack on Kavanaugh will be an attack on anyone with a digital footprint?  EVERYONE with a digital footprint. Children, teens, young adults, EVERYONE is not safe. Why all the hacks and data breeches?  Who has all data?
