@stopthenutjob @realDonaldTrump Your patriotism to our Country is questionable. Seems like your loyalties are with others rather than America. You can leave and go live elsewhere as far as we are concerned.
@realDonaldTrump Simply awesome!!!
@Paul_Bornowski @ahart4allppl @realDonaldTrump Disrespecting the President is showing disrespect to America. What a shameful exhibition of patriotism.
@Paul_Bornowski @ahart4allppl @realDonaldTrump Or the most admired. Depends on where your loyalties fall, or fall out. Traitors and dissidents of the will that the Constitution affords the American citizens by way of the electorate process should be punishable by capital levels of punishment.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump The GOP agenda needs to evolve to embrace one of the most important issues that the survival of human race is contingent upon, the environment and global warming. Although it seems impossible and contrary to many GOP political interests, it would gain much cross party support.
@realDonaldTrump WE CAN AND WE WILL!!!
@realDonaldTrump The Democrats are hypocrites. And hypocrisy always results in ridiculousness and idiocy.
