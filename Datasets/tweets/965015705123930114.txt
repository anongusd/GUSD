BREAKING: The House just passed #HR1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act, to close the Charleston Loophole.		Since 1998, the loophole has put over 60,000 guns in the hands of prohibited gun owners.		We must now call on the Senate to pass this life saving legislation.
During the #RoadToChange Tour, we discussed the Charleston Loophole with survivors from The Emanuel AME Shooting.		Today, we have an opportunity to remove this arbitrary wait time from the Background Check System.		Ring Your Rep @ (202) 224-3121 &amp; tell them to vote yes on #HR1112 https://t.co/BehVsoOEAt
Here's the deal:	1. The background checks bill passed the House yesterday.	2. Now it's headed to the senate.	3. We need EVERYONE to call their senator to get this bill passed.		Text SENATE to 954-954‚Äîwe'll connect you to your senator so you can demand they vote YES on SB.42. https://t.co/jOAcE0wQdt
