Trump: “When I can, I tell the truth.” 		That’s a lie. 		@TheLastWord 10pm
Trump says “a rock” will “be considered a firearm.” 		He is encouraging border agents and soldiers to commit crimes. Shoot to kill anyone who throws a rock at the southern border. No commander at southern border will allow shooting anyone for throwing a rock.
Trump just said “very very hard for the military to stop. And our military will have no problem.”		Nonstop incoherence.

In Committee @JeffFlake suggested sending a formal request to Trump requesting FBI investigation signed by all senators who want FBI investigation. 		Now FBI investigation is all up to Trump.
Grassley mention of 2 hour rule refers to Senate rule that does not allow any Committee business to continue 2 hours after the Senate floor session begins. 		That rule is violated sometimes and the Senate often grants exceptions to 2 hour rule for important Committee business.
Democrats should now send letter to White House formally requesting FBI investigation co-signed by Jeff Flake and every senator who wants FBI investigation.
There is a large conference room through that door behind the chairman. There is enough space in that room for multiple separate private conversations. It’s where all the real drama in a Committee takes place.
The picture of Grassley and Hatch sitting there helpless and silent and grim says it all.
Republicans suddenly went from 100% confident and jovial to silent and grim and now delaying the vote.
Grassley doing nothing is a bad sign for Republicans. It means he believes there’s nothing he can do to solve this problem.
We have never seen a sudden cliffhanger like this in a Committee vote after all senators publicly declared themselves.
Vote was scheduled for 1:30pm. Every senator is present in hearing room and adjacent conference room. There is definitely a problem.
Republican faces look worried right now. 	Something has definitely gone wrong at the last minute for Republicans.

“Republican prosecutor” has only 5 minutes left to deliver the knockout punch she was hired to deliver.
The “Republican prosecutor” is asking the questions Republican staff &amp; senators want her to ask. That’s how this works. Staff provided the map etc. It’s possible none of the questions originated with Mitchell.
@jmeacham Sasse has not reportedly expressed the kind of doubt Flake has.
@jmeacham Flake is on Judiciary. So he has superpower now. But any Republican Senator demanding FBI investigation would immediately be supported by at least a few others.
Potential Republican presidential candidate @JohnKasich says delay the vote. 	Potential Republican presidential candidate @JeffFlake has the power to delay the vote. https://t.co/cMRESVrYwC

Lying under oath to a Republican controlled senate is only investigated as a crime if the senate wants it to be investigated. 		Lying to an FBI agent is a crime that the FBI can pursue even if the Republican senate doesn’t want them to. 		Kavanaugh can’t risk talking to the FBI.
