@noinvasionusa @RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov This is the only way u can expose any Muslim who camouflages in white robes! By forcing them to condemn Muhammed’s invasion of Mecca. They will never ever do that and desperately try to shift topics. Once they are forced to stick on the topic, they will eventually melt!
@noinvasionusa @RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Did u find that weird while she was drumbeating ‘peace, love, understanding’, she always dodged while asked to condemn Muhammed’s Mecca invasion? At one point she was even cornered to admit that ‘a few hundreds’ was ok!!!

But definitely that is the only safe option she got when she herself completely exposed her ideology with the words ‘a few hundreds’!!!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov LOL! Any idiots here please? 	Wow! I like your intellect! So special! Fine keep your eyes shut if that soothes u! but never scream ‘darkness’!!!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Yep their lives were, once they were raped by the very butcherers who killed thier loved ones!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov If a ‘few hundreds’ is not a flaw, then what else is? And u want the world to believe ‘Islam is peaceful’?? Yeah the worst of idiots will! Dont expect anyone else!	For nth time, 	Learn enlighen yourself and Take care!	Bye!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Muhammed did a ‘few hundreds’! Christ a zero! 	Source: @RumiCat99
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Christ asked to love your enemies! What did Muhammed do? ‘Invade Mecca and kill innocents’!! Feel the difference! Read a lot! 	Cheers!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Well u seems to keep ur eyes forcefully shut and love to dwell in ignorance inspite pf overwhelming evidence that Muhammed invaded Mecca, killed innocents and took sex slaves ‘right hand possess’! Anyway enlighten yourself! Good day!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Its not what u think, but others! I can easily form an opinion what happened then just seeing how Saudi executes ur divine rule even today! If they behead apostates and blasphamers today, what be condition of then local inhabitants right over the epicentre of time under Muhammed
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Well your king is already in checkmate once you tweeted a ‘few hundred’!!! Now u may please visit your local mirror draped in light!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Anyway! Research yourself thoroughly! Ask your imam or your friends and form an unbiased opinion. Good day to you! Take care!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov ‘A few hundred’ Wow! And u call Muhammed a prophet! U say Muslims are peaceful???
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov By ur words even historicity of Muhammed is debated when Spencer says that there is no proof that Muhammed ever existed!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Again! Muhammed invaded Mecca and no historians no kids dispute that! A war and casualities resulted! Its ur historians who say genocide was committed against ‘humanity’	U still want to keep eyes shut and scream ‘darkness is truth’! come on
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Well whatever! Many were beheaded after Muhammed invaded Mecca by his army under his watch! You never will condemn the satanic act! Says who u are!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Come on! Even Saudi beheads people this day for apostasy! And u want the world to beleive that Jews are running Saudi??	Ridiculous!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You heard from the wrong source! Its your historians who are quoted!

@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Jamie is well researched! But not you!
@noinvasionusa @RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I am just observing her thought process.
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov “A large arsenal of the Banu Qurayza which consisted of 1500 swords, 2000 spears, 300 armours and 500 shields, were confiscated by Muhammad. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of Madinah and a number of Jews between six and seven hundred were beheaded therein.”
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Really? Then pls read ur own trusted source where Muslim historians are quoted extensively!	https://t.co/srl8aKuUS8	Now pls never ever try to conceal your satanic heart!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, Wikipedia is not absolute truth! But still what was Muhammed’s business with sword? Did Christ ever took sword? 	The fact is even ISIS will let the world know that all their activities are peaceful if they were the ones writing history and idiots will beleive!

@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Sure he invaded and killed innocent Meccans and wanted everyone to follow his example! That is the law he set!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Os he rejected Muhammed’s law?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Ask your Imam
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Because Iran once rejected Muhammed!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov None! Even Turkey and Indonesia have official shariah courts!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Exactly! Now they are returning to Muhammed’s ways!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi! You are ‘ignorant’! So do u believe Saudi is an evil nation for  following Shariah as it is! Do u condemn apostates being beheaded in Saudi?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Because Muhammed is historical figure and all ur brotherhood shit nations follow the violent rule! Tell me a single Christian majority nation that is run as per Bible?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, u dont have the right to question Israel if you believe Muhammed did a great thing by killing innocents in. ecca while invading it!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I condemn whatever is bad! But Christ did too! Christ never kept a dozen wifes and countless sex slaves, he never invaded and killed poor people!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I am sorry for u Rumi!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You never have a problem with anything Muhammed do! Even invading and terrorizing Mecca! You are evil Rumi! You are!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov That shows how literate you are about Islam!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, you are beating around the bushesa lot! you never condemned Muhammed for his offensive war on Meccan yet! If X did so Muhammed can do is not an answer!

@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, I hope you had some thought. Any chance you do condemn him now? I accepted that I condemn whoever in OT who wronged. Even Jesus was a rebel when he asked to love your neighbours as your own!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So now you are a rape apologist? Well cinally you accepted that there were beheadings and rapes during Muhammed’s reign! How low you are stooping?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Think deeper! Good day!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Still you did not condemn Muhammed for ‘slaughtering innocent Meccans’ by invading Mecca! I am just studying your psychology, perhaps of the entire Muslim community!! Yeah seems super complicated mess!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I know you agree with me!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I am different because I do not slaughter all the males from a non violent trible like Banu Qurayza all day for not accepting my rule and then allow the butcherers to rape their innocent women! Hopefully the worst of hell is reserved to all those who condone this brutal act!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Come on! How can I? I am just a humble living being in this planet. I condemn all genocides!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Oh come on! You a while before said he was ousted from Mecca and had every right to take it by war! Dont take me to an idiot! Stick to what you said please. U cannot take a u turn now and say all that was imaginary!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Thank you anyway so much for taking some time to condemn your prophet Muhammed because your book says so! Good day! Bye for now!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Oh finally some light!!! So that means you now are willing to condemn wars in past too and you CONDEMN Muhammed! Is that fine?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Comon! Evolve!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Be a human being! Be kind hearted! Have mercy! What takes it for u to condemn an act of barbarism? I dont know! This is why I believe you all are evil! You tend to act good,  but when pressed cries victim and defends barbarism by Muhammed!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov And still you dont condemn Muhammed for slaughtering innocent Meccans taking his army all the way from Medina! Irony?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Absolutely if that makes me condemn a barbarian!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Well you see however hard I try to convince you that what Muhammed done was epitome of sin, you keep shifting goalposts! Initially it was ‘present wars’, then ‘he was thrown out’, then it was ‘this that in revelation’. The fact is nobody believes you are genuine. You are a witch!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I dont care! It has nothing to do with teachings of Christ!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov For condemning a barbarian invading Mecca and slaughtering innocent victims?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Muslims may mass convert to ‘Virtue’! Yeah hopefully one day for sure and condemn Muhammed en masse for killing the innocent Meccans while setting his example to be followed!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Revelation was not written by Christ! doesnt matter!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov What on earth will it take you to condemn a barbarian killing innocents as sin?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Yeah perhaps virtue is strong too! Thank providence that evil is still playing catch up!!!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So again now you are condemning Muhammed! Stick to your principles, morals, beliefs, whatever! Dont waver! You then look so pathetic!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Evil is always strong perhaps
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Which is exactly what is not possible as long as Quran is there. Just look east to Saudi Arabia where Shariah is followed tip to toe!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov What makes it so hard for you to condemn the wars be it by anyone at any age?Again, aren’t you a hypocrite?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Nope! you are tumbling again n again. Quran for u is the absolute word which has never changed and which will never. Any attempt by u, u will be shown the door! Your perfect example is Muhammed and u know what he did to innocent Meccans!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov What is there to get upset when you just need to condemn a barbarian killing innocents and wrote in his book his example should be emulated bringing misery to hundreds of millions through out the centuries?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So you dont condemn past wars? All the wars where your doctrine brought suffering to millions! But now when you lost it and can no longer win, u r condemning all wars? Am I right?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Seems some resemblance with Jews in Israel!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Would you have lectured Muhammed likewise before he set out to plunder and invade Mecca?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Oh so now you are defending wars? That is a sea change!!!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So what?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Does that confirm that Muhammed is as worse a sinner as he invaded Mecca killing many? Did I tweet a lil before about this? So now do u again confirm Muhammed is bound to hell?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I would have rejected Christianity if Christ ever said so! What about you?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I repeat you a hundred times! Muhammed invaded Mecca! And no sane Muslims ever doubt it! Whats wrong about my interpretation when I say that it was epic terrorism?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov It is! How can I trust someone who bangs in the loudspeaker that she is “the greatest ambassador for peace ever” and then completely vanishes from scene when asked about Muhammed invading Mecca!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov In a way you are saying that your prophet is bound to be in hell?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You are running away! This is why the enlighted world believes you to be hypocrites!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Nope you are more dangerous than Nazis! You just said it now! Because as long as you dont condemn him, you are supporting him and ‘you are supporting ISIS’!!!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Yep I know! Thats why we dont see Muslims the way they like to be seen!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I know! But where is your condemnation? Is your love to me fake too?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Ok here it is! I condemn them with all my heart!  Now its your turn!	And thanks for calling me honey! I love you!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You will burn in hell? hopefully not! for time is plenty for you to stand firm and say what Muhammed did to innocent Meccans and Banu Qurayza was epic terrorism or atleast he sinned while using weapons against innocent people!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Muhammed did too what the ISIS did to innocent Meccans! How long will you run from truth?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Its not media and nothing to do with 9-11! But the internet exposed your Quran and Muhammed to whole world! Why the whole world fears and hates you is because of the dotcom revolution!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov but your prophet did! Banu Qurayza! Why do you think Saudi still to this day beheads people for apostasy? Its because they follow the shariah tip to toe! Do you now say the Saudis who follow Quran and your prophet are all sinners?
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Thats what you think and is not true. It was the invasion of Mecca by Muhammed all the way from Medina! It was brutal! It was not defensive but offensive! Please Rumi, be human for once and condemn Muhammed. If not the world will never ever believe your sincerity! Never ever!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov U see it that way Rumi if u are genuine! Its you who said that you condemn all offensive warfare. So obviously u condemn Muhammed! It doesn’t matter who or what I condemn or not.  	Or else if you want to back Muhammed you have to shout that you are for terrible wars! Pick a side!
@RumiCat99 @noinvasionusa @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Ok thats all I want and I accept you to be genuine and truthful at heart for now you do condemn the offensive war carried out by prop. Muhammed on Mecca! And you condemn Muhammed!

@RumiCat99 @UncleVladi @JamieGlazov @ScottRMiller711 This is the most “ironical” tweet that will ever hit your timeline because it comes from a “Muslim”!	She says this inspite of her prophet engaged in many offensive wars! 	Rumi is the among the worst hypocrites in twitter! How subtle she takes idiots for a run! Period!
@AnteMemoriam 👍
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov If you really believe your God to be truthful and smiling that might be because he is willing to make you walk the path of those destitute ones in Mecca while they were slaughtered by your prophet. that is justice. If you defend tyranny, your God will make you walk the same path.
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov It is contested by historians  though your own sources say that  Quran was compiled at the time of your first Caliph. But the larger issue is the violence advocated by your religion!
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You accepted since you defended the war of Muhammed on Mecca, all his terror icluding behaeding of Banu Qurayza and raping thier women under his watch by the very people who beheaded their loved ones!
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, have a good day! Perhaps your God was smiling and enjoying while thousands were slaughtered by Muhammed! And you want to beleive that your God is not Satan! Irony!
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Quran is definitely not the word of prophet because Quran was written a hundred years after your prophet died! you are an expert in shifting goalposts. Anyways you accept now that ur prophet is himself an ‘Hitler’ which is nice!
@RumiCat99 @UncleVladi @JamieGlazov @ScottRMiller711 If the hadiths are contested you are very well accepting the fact that Muhammed’s historicity is contested! Which means that you are a Muslim who believe that Muhammed is fictional!!!
@RumiCat99 @AnteMemoriam @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi, u put up a very pathetic defense! have u ever read hadiths and surahs?
@RumiCat99 @Spencer_MOOD @UncleVladi @JamieGlazov @ScottRMiller711 Well she now says Prophet Muhammed is not a Muslim after all. So where is she heading?
@Madhura_2098 @Spencer_MOOD @JamieGlazov @RumiCat99 @UncleVladi @ScottRMiller711 Can you please define me ‘ignorance’?
@RumiCat99 @UncleVladi @JamieGlazov @ScottRMiller711 Nice way to run away! So u just said that u beleive ur prophet is peaceful and if all what is said in the hadiths n suras are true then u condemn him with all ur heart. I do not force u to look outside Quran anyway. Perhaps one day u will hate him bcse u r a good. Goodnight!
@RumiCat99 @TitanicQueen @JamieGlazov If you need reform, you need to reject your prophet atleast all his acts of war! Which is impossible! Islam can never ever be reformed! Period!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So are you now saying that you are fooling people while you say that you have no idea that your prophet killed Jews and you are allowed to do it as per your laws??? I wish to be civil anyway. Thats all my point.
@RumiCat99 @UncleVladi @JamieGlazov @ScottRMiller711 Oh comon!perhaps 99 percent of Muslims are ignorant like you. You can only help yourselves. Here is a webpage run by your people that is defending the slaughter	https://t.co/FIb6fkCVua	I fail to understand what makes your prophet so violent?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Exactly why the reason you people can fool anyone u wish. But it is thier in your hadiths and no sane imam will ever deny that. Rumy, why dont you be a human for once?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov That does not mean he need to invade his home back and slaughter the inhabitants! How divine are the terrorists then by his standards!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov That is your belief Rumi.Unfortunately you book says almost as many 700 innocent men from Banu Qurayza tribe were beheaded after invasion from dawn to dusk by Muslims under the watch of your prophet!This is why the world fears u Rumi when you try to defend him and wish him peace!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Do not be a clown Rumi. It is a well affirmed fact that Muhammed invaded Mecca. Do you deny that?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So u say it is ok to kill innocent men which is weird!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Thats a pathetic statement. But if you want to run away when you finds your prophet standing undefended, so be it!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So I am asking you again, does that mean that you and Muslim community reject your prophet as it implies so that your book condemns his war on innocent Meccans though not sure what punishment he will get for his atrocities.
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov So do you mean first caliph rejected your prophet?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Comon Rumi! You stand exposed! If you dont condemn this you have absolutely no right to condemn Israel for whatever it does to Palestinians!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Whatever! If you dont condemn, it implies that you back violent atrocities and it is exactly what Islam is all about. Now do you know why world fears Islam?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov That just means behind your peaceful headscraf you defend the barbarians! Arent you exposed now?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov You are aiming your goalpost Rumy! Lets play again!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov If you condemn Peter for his brutality that implies you condemn Muhammed too for the same reason!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Thats it! It was a war lead by your prophet. It was an offensive war as Mecca was being invaded by Muhammed. Perhaps there was an innocent girl like you who might have brutally tasted sword because of your prophet. And irony is that now you defend the aggressor!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Did Jesus ever take sword? Thats why Christianity can be reformed but Islam will never be. Anyway you just condemned your prophet once in your life. Thank you.
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov I hope you have the bones to defend your prophet and not run away.
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Its exactly not about charity Rumi, but violence. Can you please explain me why Pro Muhammed conquered Mecca by sword? Did you ever find any other prophets in other religions doing this? Pls reply.
@JamieGlazov Can only hope she educate herself!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Calm down Rumi. Why dont you please educate yourselves patiently and try forming an opinion without any bias?
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov She seems to get the facts completely wrong. She might not have heard about ISIS!
@RumiCat99 @ScottRMiller711 @JamieGlazov Rumi you are wrong. Facts are misleading. Islam is a violent ideology. It does not seem compatible with charity.
If I am so are you Rumi. Lets keep it civil please. How can a violent ideology practice charity? https://t.co/IgOB6FsVnj

@politico Minnesota is doomeD!
@thehill Replying to you in advance! I will not give you Trump peacheS!
@guardiannews Perhaps what Guardian would never ever say is that 90 percent of anti-semites are Muslims! It is definitely islamophobic to speak about antisemitism these days. Briton has its hand tied while plunging in the ocean. Rest In Peace BritoN!

@MayorofLondon Don't worry hypocrite! Hitler now has a million followers in Mid-east who are salivating for the blood of Jews thanks to the superior Israeli military power. Dream for the day when Briton and EU will be fighting for the evil JihadiS!
@MayorofLondon Now you know why I hate visiting London? The air is so filthy there! It really suckS!
@VP @netanyahu Welcome back to US Pence! We will play shutup and shutdown herE!
@CNN 'Voters' is not a FNN trademark! Did ever a single FNN fake pole ever say me to be president in 2016? FNN should instead use '#Foters'
@keithellison Fighting the shutdown? Seems the phrase of the year! It should have been 'fighting the USA'. Good that you enjoy a sweet home in US while sabotaging the country from withiN!
@EmmanuelMacron Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, how I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high like a diamond in the skY!
@GOP Perhaps they were all lured by the gravity of hundred thousand Women marching that they decided to shut down the system to occupy their seatS! At the end of day the only real thing a Democrat carves is the attention of opposite sex even at the cost of sinking one's natioN!
@keithellison Now we all are happy to accept that Keith knows 1+1=2! Congrats Keith! You passed the Kindergarten! Keep learning and perhaps one day you will be amazed to learn that E=mc^2! Hopefully your Muslim faith doesn't not gravitate you to terrorism mid-way! Keep working harD!

@thehill Everytime a Muslim American tries to convince a non-Muslim American, I win a votE!

@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS It is not that a big deal! I just asked Schumer if he loved a one degree raise in temperatures by the falL!
@CNN CNN is islamophobiC!
@PamelaGeller I now doubt Obama is a Russian agent and we never knew even after eight yearS!
@TheSun No wonder Islam is on a roll in BriT!
@EmmanuelMacron The French is affected with amnesia that they fail to recollect how to produce! All production is now outsourced to immigrant Muslims from AfricA!

@RoyalFamily I see Jack embracing a spit out cud by Muslim Rape Gangs! Briton should be ashameD!
@RoyalFamily Hope their progeny never ask Eugene how was her experience while she was being raped so young by Muslim Rape Gangs, why she kept it a secret fearing of being labelled an Islamaphobe, and does she really have another bloodline exclusively for the Muslim Rape Gangs!
