@RethinkThePink1 @monaeltahawy Bye. Spin silly wheels in a corner by yourself.
@RethinkThePink1 @monaeltahawy Doubling down on the deflection?  Lol. we are discussing women upholding the status quo of white male dominance in government against their own interests. So we are talking about how women vote.  We. Are. Talking. About. Women. See?
@RethinkThePink1 @monaeltahawy I seem to be missing why expecting women to be informed and responsible voters, not voting against their own rights and interests, is somehow asking them to save the world and not themselves. Also, nice deflection and finger pointing.
@RepRWilliams Y’all have added trillions to our debt and now borrowing money from China to pay off farmers hurt by our feckless President’s trade wars because the billions of tax dollars you’ve squandered already wasn’t enough. Fuck off with your bullshit little 2nd grade level animation.

@asmMelendez Still ignoring my main point. Infuriating!
@asmMelendez Nice try, I’ve read this article and agree with many points. I’m also tired of being overtaxed. Once again - no solutions except to point fingers and ignore the fact that red states have similar issues. RED STATES have the same problems!
