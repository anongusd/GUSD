Right, no justification for investigations...		✅ Trump Advisor Roger Stone Indicted 	✅ Trump Chair Paul Manafort Convicted	✅ Trump Lawyer Michael Cohen Pled Guilty	✅ Trump Aide Rick Gates Pled Guilty	✅ Trump NSA Advisor Michael Flynn Pled Guilty		#ThursdayThoughts

@RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump There was plenty of evidence for an investigation. Trump Tower meeting, which wasn’t about adoptions and Stormy Daniels Payment. Both justifying investigations.

@realDonaldTrump That all sounds great except you stymie innovation with Republican policy of dirty energy preventing technological investment in clean technologies like high-speed rail, solar farms and a 21st-century power grid. All while letting our infrastructure crumble

Republicans don’t care about your struggles, I promise you. Trump isn’t the least bit interested in solving them. They’re interested in two things and two things only. Making you afraid and telling you who's to blame all while lining the pockets of the 1% #ThursdayMotivation
@Bklyn_Voters Your advice is pretty ignorant
Dear Republicans. Let’s make this crystal clear. NO ONE WANTS YOUR GUNS. We want you to keep them safe in your home and stop using them. We need to hire more police with better training pay and benefits; not have a careless military armed populous. Again, NO ONE WANTS YOUR GUNS!

@SenSanders America isn’t broke, we’re being robbed. Top 1% own 40% of net worth, earn 20% of all income, pay effective tax near 15% and each have $10+ million. I’m not opposed to capitalism. I’m opposed to wealthfare. Don’t tell me taxpayers needed to give them a huge tax cut
I have more solutions than Washington has problems. Corruption of political and journalistic process by the 1% is the issue of our time. Legislators cannot govern for the people when they are beholden to their donors and journalists cannot report when worried about advertisers

@realDonaldTrump When Donald Trump talks about military service remember in 1968 he was a 22-year-old Univeristy Of Pennsylvania athlete who played football, tennis and golf. He avoided service after receiving a 1-Y medical deferment, which was due to "bone spurs in his heels." Cadet Bone Spurs
Pelosi was right. Statue of Liberty should be the symbol of American values, not wall along our southern border. We have plenty of room, available housing and need for an influx of labor with an aging population. Give us your tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free

Liam Neeson made an extremely poor judgment call in sharing this racist story to try and promote a movie. What we can really learn from this is that racial tolerance is not something we can go to sleep on, ever. We can never let this behavior become normalized or profitable
No one likes abortion. Everyone wants to prevent. Problem is Republican policy of ignorance. If you want to prevent needless abortion you offer free birth control, sexual education and healthcare access. Not the exact opposite. Abstinence is not an effective policy #MondayMorning

@realDonaldTrump News isn’t fake just because it’s critical of you. Alternative facts are not real unless supported by evidence. Trump’s war isn’t with the MSM, it’s with the facts. Fox News is the fake news you seek. It rots your brain. Shut it off. Ask public businesses to switch the channel

@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr (4/4) Donald Trump is forcefully manufacturing crisis keeping government closed and held hostage to his demands. American people spoke during the mid-term election. We don’t want to pay for a useless wall, we’d rather hire 50,000 teachers, 90 VA hospitals or universal childcare
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr (3/4) Democrats already tried to secure border and reform immigration system with S.744. Republicans don’t want to solve illegal immigration. You don’t fix a leaky ship with the passengers inside. Fix Quotas, VISA’s, Refugees, DACA, then you build your wall
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr (2/4) Donald Trump and Republicans need to stop lying to the American people. Democrats don’t want open borders, terrorists are not crossing the southern border and we have a barrier in place already. We need more monitoring security and personnel, not a wall
@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr (1/4) We already have a barrier. Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s the legal immigration system.

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump fails to neglect he is -13 on average with his approval rating, majority of voters blame him for the government shutdown and 2/3 do not want a wall to begin with. Keep on spinning Donald. Your time is running out.
Government is not Trump’s bargaining chip to build his useless wall Mexico was supposed to pay for. American people spoke in mid-term elections. With 9 million mixed citizenship households and broken immigration process walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem

@realDonaldTrump (4/4) Donald Trump is forcefully manufacturing crisis keeping government closed and held hostage to his demands. American people spoke during the mid-term election. We don’t want to pay for a useless wall, we’d rather hire 50,000 teachers, 90 VA hospitals or universal childcare
@realDonaldTrump (3/4) Democrats already tried to secure border and reform immigration system with S.744. Republicans don’t want to solve illegal immigration. You don’t fix a leaky ship with the passengers inside. Fix Quotas, VISA’s, Refugees, DACA, then you build your wall
@realDonaldTrump (2/4) Donald Trump and Republicans need to stop lying to the American people. Democrats don’t want open borders, terrorists are not crossing the southern border and we have a barrier in place already. We need more monitoring security and personnel, not a wall
@realDonaldTrump (1/4) We already have a barrier. Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s the legal immigration system. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem https://t.co/z6pZ8JAyyr
What Republicans neglect to inform you of is undocumented immigrants create ten of billions in revenues through state, sales and property taxes and commit crime at a lower percentage than citizens. We also need the labor force with an aging population #TrumpShutDown

Speaker Pelosi says the "Trump shutdown" undermines security: "We're not paying people who keep us safe," including TSA agents "who stop bombs from coming on to plans," FBI agents, who track down terrorists and immigration officials who patrol the border #TrumpShutdown
Remember people like Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are the people Donald Trump gets his news, advice and political marching orders from. Want to talk about Fake News? Fox News is the fake news you seek. They prey on the weak for their own personal gain and influence
Donald Trump and Republicans are ruining the economy. First the 1% tax cut exploded deficit with little growth, then trade wars exploded trade deficit, now the Trump shutdown is going to contract the economy. The 1% got a huge tax cut and will buy everything cheap #WheresMitch

@realDonaldTrump News isn’t fake just because it’s critical of you. Alternative facts are not real unless supported by evidence. Trump’s war isn’t with the MSM, it’s with the facts. Fox News is the fake news you seek. It rots your brain. Shut it off. Ask public businesses to switch the channel

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends It’s funny that you say that now but Republicans didn’t give President Obama when gas prices dropped. The fact of the matter is US energy policy has minimal impact other than taxes with the primary factor overseas oil production. Obama increased refineries and output

My suggestion to all Democrats for this primary is... Pick three candidates. Support 1st until they drop out then move to number 2 and then number 3. We can not afford to stand on the sidelines in this election in a brutal expensive primary. Remember the focus, Trump and Senate
@BelgumDonna Whoever wins this primary will have my full support. I’m going to support three candidates in the primary
@ianhurrell57 That’s what a primary is for. If you win this primary in the democratic state I’ll support you over Trump no matter who you are

We have so many problems that need solutions and our government is asleep at the wheel. Where are the brains of the 21st century. The scholars. The teachers. We need to become passionate for life and our fellow man. Inspire each other. If we don’t, we will fail #SundayMorning
Trump and GOP don’t care about your struggles, I promise you. Donald Trump isn’t least bit interested in solving them. They’re interested in two things and two things only. Making you afraid and telling you who's to blame; while lining pockets of the wealthy and well connected
Julian Castro is just trying to nail down VP consideration. He knows he has no chance of winning primary. Has to show he can put on a professional campaign. My favorite ticket still is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris; but I’m considering Beto as well. Need to see more of him

@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump (1/4) The real problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s the legal immigration system. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem

I really don’t think Joe Lieberman has any room to talk. He is a closet Trump supporter. He singlehandidly sabotaged the public option, campaigned against Obama and was on the Republican short list for Vice President with McCain. I’d stand with Ocasio-Cortez long before him
@realDonaldTrump Mitch McConnell used nuclear option to tamper with Supreme Court, ram through 1% tax cut, refused to open the government and obstructed President Obama. He’s up for re-election. If everyone who read this chipped in $5 we’d flip Kentucky #MitchMustGo❗️https://t.co/cW0t99ZRtV
@realDonaldTrump (4/4) Donald Trump is forcefully manufacturing a crisis keeping the government closed with 800,000 workers furloughed. The American people spoke during the mid-term election. We don’t want to pay for a useless wall, we’d rather hire 50,000 teachers

@realDonaldTrump (3/4) Democrats already tried to secure border and reform immigration system with S.744. Republicans don’t want to solve illegal immigration. You don’t fix a leaky ship with the passengers inside. Fix Quotas, VISA’s, Refugees, DACA, then you build a your wall #TrumpAddress
@realDonaldTrump (2/4) Donald Trump and Republicans need to stop lying to the American people. Democrats don’t want open borders, terrorists are not crossing the southern border and we have a barrier in place already. We need more monitoring security and personnel, not a wall #TrumpAddress
@realDonaldTrump (1/4) The real problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s the legal immigration system. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem #TrumpAddress

Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden, Beto O’Rourke, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders. Doesn’t matter to me. Any of them are 100 times better than Donald Trump and this draconian administration
Retweet this if you think Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer should have the same airtime to respond to Donald Trump’s Oval Office national emergency address on the major news networks like @cnn @msmbc @foxnews
National Emergency we have is the manufactured crisis after crisis of Donald Trump and the Republican party. Trade wars, 1% tax cut and #TrumpShutdown are threatening our economic stability. There are no terrorists crossing the southern border. We need more security, not a wall
Tonight Donald Trump will the disgrace the Oval Office using it as a propaganda tool to lie to the American people. Terrosists are not crossing the southern border, Democrats don’t want open borders and we have a barrier. We need more security, not a useless wall #TuesdayThoughts
We should have an #Amendment4 passed for the entire country, not just Florida. Voting is an integral part of service to your country. Thomas Jefferson warned us the key to a lasting nation is a well educated population. We should always offer a path for second chances
Gabby Giffords knows Republican philosophy of more guns creating less civilian gun violence is just asinine. Don’t let criminals, domestic abusers or mentally ill pass background checks. Limit high capacity military style weaponry. Invest in medicaid and social service programs
Another huge failure by Donald Trump and his administration. This is what happens when you suddenly announce withdraw from Syria with no communication to our allies. This move alienates the Kurds who will turn to Assad for protection from Erdogen. Kurds are terrorists to Turkey
Retweet this now if you pledge to #BoycottTrumpPrimeTime. There are systematic problems in our journalistic process. We have to stop giving inflammatory speech ratings, which is what Donald Trump thrives on. Light your hair on fire and run around screaming the end is coming

@realDonaldTrump But I thought Democrats winning the House Of Representatives was going to make the market crash. Looks like it did the exact opposite, giving consumers some confidence that your administration won’t last forever #DumpTrump 2020
@realDonaldTrump News isn’t fake just because it’s critical of you. Alternative facts are not real unless supported by evidence. Trump’s war isn’t with the MSM, it’s with the facts. Fox News is the fake news you seek. It rots your brain. Shut it off. Ask public businesses to switch the channel
We need to make elections more fair and comprehensive to make sure popular vote loser cannot lose presidency. Make popular vote winner get number of electoral votes. Imagine Donald Trump won popular vote but lost electoral college. He never would've accepted the results
Been saying this for years. Eating less beef is good for your health and the environment. There are over 1.5 billion humans that suffer water insecurity. It takes 1,779 gallons of fresh water to create one pound of beef. We must make better food choices https://t.co/rIDV4wR4ah

@realDonaldTrump Walls won’t prevent problem without reforming immigration system. That includes VISA’s, Refugees, Asylum, DACA, Quotas. The problem? Republicans don’t want to fix these issues. Democrats do. Reform then secure. Maybe they wouldn’t need to be at border with effective system
Nancy Pelosi has announced as the new Speaker of The House Of Representatives Democrats will be passing a bill with $1.3 billion in border security, plus the previous $2 billion, to re-open the government. Now up to Donald Trump and Republicans if they keep government shutdown
@censorshipIs I’m sorry for your loss but walls wouldn’t have stopped it. We need more police with better training, pay and benefits. If that illegal would have been registered with the government maybe he would have thought twice knowing he’d get caught
@Opy1963 No one gave Iran $150 billion. It was money seized FROM THEM originally.
Maybe @realDonaldTrump doesn’t understand. Republicans don’t want to fix the immigration system. That’s more votes against them. You want wall funding? You have to completely fix the immigration system first. Quotas, VISA, Refugees, DACA. Then you build a wall with entry points
@Leftsucks2 #ReformSystemThenSecure
#SpeakerPelosi has announced the #116thCongress House Of Representatives will be passing a bill with $1.3 billion in border security to re-open the government. It’s now up to Donald Trump and Republicans if they will keep the government shutdown and 800,000 workers furloughed

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump's southern border wall is complete waste that won’t solve illegal immigration. Secure the border technologically. $25 billion could hire 50,000 teachers for 10 years or build 90 new VA hospitals. Wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this wall?
@realDonaldTrump Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s legal immigration system. Not illegal by choice. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump's southern border wall is complete waste that won’t solve illegal immigration. Secure the border technologically. $25 billion could hire 50,000 teachers for 10 years or build 90 new VA hospitals. Wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this wall?

@realDonaldTrump If he was a registered immigrant with a path to citizenship who had to be registered, verified and paid taxes this wouldn’t be a problem. Problem with illegal immigration is the legal immigration system, not the immigrants

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump's southern border wall is complete waste that won’t solve illegal immigration. Secure the border technologically. $25 billion could hire 50,000 teachers for 10 years or build 90 new VA hospitals. Wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this wall?
@realDonaldTrump Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s legal immigration system. Not illegal by choice. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem

@stillchip Bored or to distract from bone gate
@Wo_rld_Pea_ce Obama did it in the first 6 months
Don’t be fooled. Donald Trump finally visited our troops in Iraq because he had nothing else to do, not because he wanted. Only took him two years, shutting the government down and being forced to cancel his vacation to Mar-A-Lago over the holidays because he shut it down
@Shanny_resqchi @netflix You must not have taken the time to read the tweet, fix it or lawsuit

@WillemSimonis @netflix Valid point but that’s why he’s not my president
@jamiehex @netflix Could you imagine a 7 year old watching this movie? That’s what this mistake has allowed to happen to millions of children. I’m trying to get it fixed ASAP. It’s to increase viewership of their original series
@Sassymami1981 @netflix The reason I threatened the lawsuit is to get it fixed! Hence the tweet was worded fix this or else
@jamiehex @netflix Have you watched the movie? This is a big deal
@Sassymami1981 @netflix Corporations only respond to lawsuits

@realDonaldTrump Republicans don’t care about your struggles, I promise you. Donald Trump isn’t the least bit interested in solving them. They’re interested in two things and two things only. Making you afraid and telling you who's to blame; all while lining pockets of the 1%

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump's southern border wall is complete waste that won’t solve illegal immigration. Secure the border technologically. $25 billion could hire 50,000 teachers for 10 years or build 90 new VA hospitals. Wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this wall?
@realDonaldTrump Problem with illegal immigration isn’t immigrants, it’s legal immigration system. Not illegal by choice. With 9 million mixed citizenship households, $7,000 process, 10-20 yr. wait and 60% from visa abuse; walls won’t solve problem. Fix the system, fix the problem

@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Let no one get it twisted. Donald Trump is pulling out of Syria to let Russia have their way with the region.

Christmas is a celebration of the #WinterSolstice, not birth of Jesus. Ancient pagan’s celebrated Roman midwinter festivals called Saturnalia and Dies Natalis Solis Invicti for changing of the seasons when the sun won over the darkness of winter. We must fight this war on history
#WinterSolstice has roots in Egypt. As days went shorter they said Horus (the sun) was dying. As the days began to lengthen again, they said that Horus was being resurrected and rose in the sky. The day was celebrated as the rebirth of Horus, not Jesus. Stop this war on history

Let no one get it twisted. Donald Trump is pulling out of Syria to let Russia have their way with the region. This is a blatant power grab by the Russians for influence and Donald Trump is laying out the red carpet for them. Middle East is in no way safe from militant extremists
President Obama defeated ISIS with 26,000 air-strikes crippling their financial network, not Donald Trump. Syria is a vacuum for terrorists. We must support the people of the Middle East in their fight for freedom against totalitarian dictators and oppose nation building for oil

Stock market on pace for worst December since Great Depression. Republicans put us on a path to recession. $1.5 trillion Wall Street tax cut went to stock buybacks inflating value, exploding annual deficit, providing no YOY wage growth all while engaging in trade wars with allies
Republicans want you to think the big economic problem is 140 million are lazy, not 400 greedy. When working full-time at minimum wage brings home $250 week; problem is wages, not workers. Tax Cut wasn’t about helping the working class, just Wall Street tax cut #TuesdayThoughts

@realDonaldTrump You fired James Comey because he wouldn’t pledge his loyalty. You’re not fooling anyone. In review Donald Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting and that it wasn’t about adoptions. He also knew about hush money payments to stormy Daniels. These are the smocking gun facts
Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and America knows this would be a Donald Trump government shutdown. Wasn’t Mexico supposed to pay for this useless wall? Problem with immigration is the system. Not the immigrants. We must reform our broken system, then focus on border security

@realDonaldTrump Does #TariffMan realize his trade wars are costing the United States trillions? Between tariffs and the stock market drops his trade wars have cost us trillions in value and growth. Could you imagine what Republicans would have been saying if this was President Obama?

@Grumpa This is my wife’s land. My parents, parents, parents, weren’t born here (that happens to everyone) but Native Americans were. Your xenophobia is showing.
@Grumpa That was the point. We are a nation of immigrants, not walls.
@Grumpa Do you kiss your mother with that mouth. There were 50-100 million native Americans in North America when we arrived. Disease and war forced them to be generationally destroyed. My wife is Native American

@SenSanders America isn’t broke, we’re being robbed. Top 1% own 40% of net worth, earn 20% of all income, pay effective tax near 15% and each have $10+ million. I’m not opposed to capitalism. I’m opposed to #wealthfare. Don’t tell me taxpayers needed to give them tax cut

@realDonaldTrump You obviously have no idea how government or elections work. This is what happens when you don’t invest in the electoral system. Not all votes are counted on Election Day because of an antiquated system. Fact is, you don’t care and are not interested beyond your fear-mongering

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump using refugees as a political punching bag is morally repugnant. Caravan is over 1,000 miles away from the border. They’re going to mow your lawns, pick your crops, mop your floors, vacuum your office and pay taxes. Be afraid, be very afraid #DumpTrump
George Washington warned party extremism would destroy our country. Republicans have gone far-right. We have real problems, that need real solutions. Time to purge this administration and give Democrats a real governing majority. 2020 starts today #FridayMotivation
Remember when Donald Trump said he was going to be way to busy to play golf and criticized President Obama 27 times for doing so? Well, he has golfed more in 2 years than Obama did in 8. Guess the saber-rattling was just that, like everything else, hypocrisy #FlashbackFriday

Democrats have taken the House. This is a huge win for America. We’ve sent a message to Donald Trump and Republicans that their hateful, divisive and fact-less rhetoric is not what makes America great. Our job isn’t done, we’ve just started. 2020 starts tomorrow #ElectionNight
