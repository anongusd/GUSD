How can the Dems not stand and clap for all the great things that are happening to America?  They look bitter and stupid.  Nancy Pelosi looks like she has a stick up her butt  (I know that was crude-sorry)
Guess why the Dems don't want the wall? It will keep out potential voters. Anything to do with illegals Dems will fight against because they look into the faces of mostly Latinos and see one big fat vote for themselves.
Why wouldn't the dems stand up for the fact that wages are higher? Or  don't they want those things for the people of America? Also lower taxes? It's happening all around them and they have no windows in the bubble.
Whose running the democratic party?  I'll bet there are plenty of dems who would work with Trump on issues.  It's Palosi and Schmuer that are the keepers of the gate eyeing all the prisoners to make sure the name Trump is not heard.  NP &amp; CS-set the democrats free!

@harrdtimes John has made it clear that he is done with that part of his life. I'm a 1970's fan and it's hard to not see him when the other members preform. But for John, when Freddie went, the original Queen would never be the same. And that's ok. We each gotta do what we gotta do.
@THEcorinashley Freddie said once,"Every band needs a bass player and we wanted the best" I think that the fact that John was such an introvert gets mistaken for him being weak in some way. He wasn't a showman like Freddie but any Queen song could not be as spectacular without him. #jfbr

@aida_zarifian I wonder what it would have like to have twitter when I was your age. My life was defiantly simpler then.
@aida_zarifian None of my family or friends are into old rock n roll. This is why I'm on twitter looking for people who love it like I do.
@aida_zarifian Why is it so important to get so many followers on twitter?
@aida_zarifian  I do have some fun people to follow if you want me to pass them along-mostly music
@georgeellias I can see that. And I can also remember how fun it was to flirt!! :~P
@aida_zarifian I only have 32 followers. It's my choice-I like to talk to my followers and keep up with what they are doing.
@georgeellias I like it when you take pics, talk about your music, show us stuff etc.  I forget you're young.
@aida_zarifian They are just lazy and uninteresting.
