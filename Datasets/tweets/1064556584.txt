@SpeakerPelosi Why don’t you tell the media the truth!!  You do t care about American safety!!

@SpeakerPelosi The President sent aid to Puerto Rico and it was refused!!!  Maybe you need to find out why!!
@RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi You can stop the shutdown by funding the wall!!  You were all for it when your King Obama was wanting it!!  You are so transparent!!  And it’s really sad that you care so little about American citizens!!
@SpeakerPelosi So Nancy, you keep trying to run away from your responsibilities of protecting American citizens by funding the wall! It’s not working! The more you try to run the more we know just how little American safety and American lives mean to you! Stop the Dem  shutdown.
