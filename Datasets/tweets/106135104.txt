Ryan's demand that Senate vote first on a final conference report might be closest he's come to acknowledging repeal is a political loser
But Ryan's statement includes no guarantee that House will never pass skinny repeal—if, say, the conference committee fails to get deal
Ryan relents to Graham/McCain/Johnson's demand, reluctantly — says House willing to conference but that Senate must act first on final bill

Heller votes against BCRA amendment while Capito and Portman vote for it

Paul Ryan waited until John Boehner had left the chamber. Then he said: "Let's be frank: The House is broken." https://t.co/q7YmJ63RYZ
In his first act, Paul Ryan leads the House in unanimously approving a resolution to let President Obama know that he is speaker.
Ryan's pledges here to 'return to regular order' are received well. But Boehner promised the same thing and couldn't deliver.
Ryan: "Let’s be frank: The House is broken. We’re not solving problems. We’re adding to them."
A weeping Boehner makes a big wave of his white handkerchief as the applause dies down. Choose your own metaphor there.
Ryan embraces Boehner and tells him, "Don't cry!" Nice try, Mr. Speaker
Speaker-elect Ryan enters the House chamber through the center aisle just like the president at the State of the Union. Both parties applaud
A big, bipartisan cheer erupts in the House as John Boehner announces the election of Paul Ryan, with 236 votes, as speaker.
John Boehner, in his final moments as speaker, casts a loud vote for Ryan to replace him
Paul Ryan easily wins the speaker's gavel, suffering only 9 defections—fewer than Boehner lost each of the last two elections
Ted Yoho of Florida becomes Webster's 9th vote
Daniel Webster gets his 8th vote from Weber of Texas. Webster himself doesn't vote when his name is called.
Kirsten Sinema, Arizona Dem, votes for Civil Rights icon John Lewis, as she did in January.
Paul Ryan is not in the chamber and doesn't vote for himself. Boehner didn't either.
Tim Ryan, Democrat: "While I love the name Ryan, I vote for Pelosi."
Another Floridian casts a favorite-son vote for Webster: Bill Posey. 7th vote for Webster
Markwayne Mullin's kid breaks all the rules and votes for Ryan in place of his dad, who stands to make it official. The House laughs
Mark Meadows, who initially introduced the resolution to oust Boehner, votes for Ryan.
Libertarian Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, big Boehner foe, votes for Webster
Steve King disappoints his allies in the anti-immigration reform camp, votes for Ryan
Walter Jones, as anti-leadership as they come, votes for Webster
Gwen Graham of Florida, Democrat, votes for Jim Cooper, who voted for Colin Powell. Got it?
Louie Gohmert always goes against the grain. He votes for Webster, as does Paul Gosar of Arizona
Kevin McCarthy yawns in his seat. Oh, what might have been…
As usual, Democrat Jim Cooper votes for General Colin Powell. Third time in a row, I believe. Speaker doesn't have to be member of House
The first Republican to vote against Ryan is David Brat, who defeated Eric Cantor. He votes for Daniel Webster.
Boehner now has one more job to do: Preside over the election of his successor. Takes a deep breath and retakes the gavel.
The single key to Boehner's famous emotions is children: He begins to tear up as soon as he begins talking about efforts to expand education
The speaker came prepared: John Boehner is standing in the well of the House holding a box of tissues. Expect waterworks as he bids farewell

24 Republicans voted against Boehner, half of them for Daniel Webster, ex-speaker of Florida House. One Republican voted present
…others receiving votes: Gowdy, Rand Paul, Jeff Sessions, DeFazio, Powell, John Lewis, Jim Cooper, Jeff Duncan, Kevin McCarthy
The official speaker tally: Boehner 216, Pelosi 164, Webster, 12, Gohmert 3, Yoho, 2, Jordan 2
Matt Salmon votes for Boehner on the second pass, was silent before
John Boehner returns to the House chamber as it becomes clear, despite significant defections, that he has won a third term as speaker
At least 25 Republicans have refused to vote for Boehner for speaker, twice as much as in 2013
Matt Salmon is in the House chamber, but sat silently as his name was called, wouldn’t vote for Boehner

Ted Yoho gets his first vote, from Thomas Massie, who nominated him
Jim Jordan, a conservative who has gotten a couple votes for speaker, votes for Boehner
Boehner now has 13 Republican defections -- 1 more than two years ago and about halfway through the vote
Kevin McCarthy did not look pleased to get a speaker vote from retiring Rep Chris Gibson
er, Clawson
Rand Paul gets a vote for speaker from Rep. Claussen of Florida, a freshman. Speaker doesn’t need to be a member of House.
Mo Brooks, Alabama conservative and immigration hardliner, predicted last year Boehner wouldn’t run for another term. He just voted for him.
Cantor’s replacement, Dave Bratt, votes for Rep. Jeff Duncan for speaker
Boehner revolts against himself  (is absent from floor when his name is called)

Scalise win puts a red-state conservative in GOP leadership for first time since Hensarling
Announced by riva Litman of house GOP
Conservative Rep. Steve Scalise (La.) has been elected House majority whip, defeating Reps. Peter Roskam &amp; Marlin Stutzman on 1st ballot
The votes for majority whip are now being tallied, aide says. Second ballot needed if no majority. Scalise favored if only 1 ballot
McCarthy is now Boehner's potential heir apparent, but conservatives will have another shot in a few months http://t.co/3mYD8IsKzh

Kevin McCarthy has been elected the next House majority leader, defeating Raul Labrador, to replace Eric Cantor

Can Scalise win whip on first ballot? 2 key undecideds are Justin Amash &amp; Walter Jones, who say they won't vote for Roskam

@JTSTheHill @ruckusdeleon I support only peaceful robot giraffes, well-named or not.
RT @MEPFuller: Gohmert also says he's supporting "Steve Scalia" for whip. Probably a bunch of Republicans supporting Scalia for whip.
McCarthy just left House GOP meeting before press conference, says "feeling good." Vote count: "You know we don't talk about vote counts."
Rep. John Carter, outside GOP meeting, was just pressing a top McCarthy aide on border security. Aide said, "You know where to find me."
Scalise on Roskam/2nd ballot strategy: "if your opponent's goal is to come in 2nd, I'm here to help make that happen."
Eric Cantor just got another big ovation inside House GOP conference meeting, member says. He will not be at the leadership press conference
Asked about Hastert rule, McCarthy joked that he has "the McCarthy Rule: Get as many votes as you can!" says Peter King
RT @costareports: Issa left mtg thinking whip speeches would be later this AM but 2 mins later, those inside said, what the heck, do 'em now
McCarthy and Labrador have been asked by members about Hastert rule, committee power, Ex Im bank, other issues, Issa says
Darrell Issa said candidate forum is being drawn out-- members now asking questions of McCarthy and Labrador, whip candidates speak later
RT @thehill: Scalise as whip? From antagonist to enforcer http://t.co/FwGH7mYKWX by @cimarcos
Labrador will also meet with PA delegation soon about his majority leader bid, but not McCarthy. Why? He met with them last week.
Scalise says 2/3 of Texas delegation committed to him after Sessions declined to run for whip after dropping leader bid
Steve Scalise brings shiny campaign cards to hand out to PA delegation. "Steve Scalise for majority whip ... Together we will succeed."
Labrador: "Everyone who complained about leadership for the last 4 years has a clear opportunity …to send a message." http://t.co/nRSterYrd6
My feature on Rep. Raul Labrador, who has beaten the GOP establishment's pick before http://t.co/nRSterYrd6
Labrador writes to colleagues, says "promoting…member of the DC establishment …struck me as exactly the wrong response" to Cantor defeat
More from Labrador: He won't give a # of supporters ("I'm not playing that game"), says he could work w/Boehner, pledging full 72 hr rule
Raul Labrador says he's telling members he will NOT run for Speaker in November, whether or not he defeats McCarthy for majority leader
Cantor clearly thinks this is merely a break in his political career, not the end. Still very much on message, not closing 'any options'

Virginia has an open primary system, and because Dems didn't have candidate, Brat was encouraging them to vote against Cantor
As @beschlossdc points out, Senate majority leaders lost in 1950 and 1952, but those were general, not primary, election #cantor
Democrats did not field a candidate in the 7th district. Brat will likely be elected to Congress in November.
