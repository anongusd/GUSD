In June, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill that would provide $1.6 billion for 65 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. Language in the bill limits funding "to currently deployed fencing design along the southern border, such as bollard fencing." https://t.co/eRaPUfn4O4
- Imho it's really important to make a distinction between border barrier funding and border security funding. Trump often talks about a physical "wall," but when lawmakers use the phrase "border security" they usually mean more than just a barrier.
- In July, the House Appropriations Committee approved a bill that would provide $5 billion for "physical barriers and associated technology." That would allow for 200 miles of new construction along the U.S.-Mexico border.
- In June, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill that would appropriate $1.6 billion for 65 miles of ‚Äúpedestrian fencing‚Äù in the Rio Grande Valley. 	- Later that month, during a meeting at the White House, Trump asked for $5 billion.
- In February, the Trump administration's fiscal 2019 budget request asked Congress to appropriate $1.6 billion for 65 miles of new construction in the Rio Grande Valley.
- The fiscal 2018 spending package, which became law in March, included $1.57 billion for border barriers and technology. That included 47 miles of new barriers and 48 miles of upgraded barriers.
And now for a history lesson on Homeland Approps and "the wall":	- The fiscal 2017 spending package, which became law in May 2017, included $350M to replace 40 miles of existing fencing with higher steel structures. 		[There was a lot of debate about whether this was "the wall."]

- But that wouldn't affect the Army Corps of Engineers, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor, Legislative Branch, or Veterans Affairs because they have full-year spending bills that last until Sept. 30, 2019.
- If some type of spending package isn't signed into law by 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 8 there would be a funding lapse at Agriculture, Commerce, EPA, Homeland Security, HUD, Interior, IRS, Justice, NASA, State, Transportation and Treasury.
Time for Approps 101:		- Congress has passed and Trump has signed five of the 12 spending bills for fiscal 2019, which began on Oct. 1.	- Those five bills total about $1 trillion of the $1.244 trillion spending cap.	- Lawmakers are trying to finish up the final 7 before Dec. 8

Obey says if the select committee wants to propose fundamental changes it should do four things. 	- Abolish the Budget Committee	- "Recognize that in the last 50 years the budget has never approached balance with revenues as a percentage of GDP."
Panetta also suggests	- Getting rid of budget gimmicks	- Having CBO and OMB use a common baseline	- Have better control over emergency spending	- Have "some checks on mandatory spending"
Panetta suggests Congress	- look at biennial budget	- make the budget resolution a joint resolution	- move from fiscal year to calendar year 	- Set "a price to be paid for failure to pass a budget resolution"	- Look at bringing back the Gephardt Rule for the debt limit
Panetta: "One of the fundamental messages that I have to stress is the importance of bipartisanship to making this process work... It‚Äôs difficult to do when you‚Äôre working together, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do when you try to shove this stuff through the process on your own."

So, if there is not time agreement and Sen. Rand Paul is the only one who uses the full hour, the earliest the Senate would vote on passage is around 3 a.m. on Saturday morning. If senators use the full 30 hours, the latest is 8 a.m. Sunday morning.

Mulvaney ends the briefing with "Honestly, I'm just whipped. I've been doing this for four days." 		Directs additional question to press staff and reminds reporters he'll be testifying in front of Senate Budget tomorrow and House Budget on Wednesday.
Mulvaney says the administration wants $1.6B in fy18 and $1.6B in fy19 for a border wall regardless of a DACA deal. If there is a DACA deal, WH wants the $18B-$25B figure.
Mulvaney says the budget proposes reducing federal spending by $3 trillion during the next decade, $1.7 trillion of which is from mandatory programs. 		My story on those mandatory changes: https://t.co/PNPHwaLo9X
Mulvaney notes that the WH's fiscal 2019 budget request doesn't balance during the 10-year window. 		"I probably could have made it balance... but it would have taken funny numbers."
Really interesting he's citing the CBO baseline here and not the OMB baseline. https://t.co/l7aYfOcXDQ
Mulvaney says "you are going to see a spike in the deficit" because "tax revenues are going down." But adds that during "the 10 years we are generating more money for the Treasury than the CBO baseline that was written before the tax bill."
