On my walk to work today a deer charged me...stopped like 10 ft short then followed me for a lil way it was dark, well I think it was a deer
@krystyl is that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act?
RT @barefoot_exec: TODAY...I lept up, ready to embrace & wrap up some things. I feel like...I'm on the surfboard about to stand up : )
goodnight twitterverse!  I hope you enjoyed the #superbowl now its time to look forward to the upcoming weeks, make it a good one!
@soyjournalista http://www.linkedin.com/in/richardlobb good luck, may the buffalo wings flow freely when you are in charge...
@douxpluie yeah, maternal instinct is a terrible thing...its alcohol, cleans and disinfects or something  ;)
@douxpluie I guess it wasn't a #superbowl commercial, just showed right afterward...here is the link though:  http://bit.ly/w4fT
@mediaphyter thats not lazy thats efficient   ;)
@douxpluie I guess it might be a regional commercial, not sure if they do those for superbowl...I'll try to find it for you
that commercial for Clear wireless internet, the one where they use the beer analogy...is brilliant.
@Matman you get a phone call and a meal, I vote that you go for it...
@thatgamergirl I am most definitely NOT watching the superbowl, I think we should concentrate on CAL events more than football   ;)
@peggyolson play along today, but let him know the truth tomorrow...it makes people feel good to celebrate other peoples birthdays
@soyjournalista Jon Stewart had a reliable source in the chicken industry on his show that mentioned a reserve of chicken wings :D
@bethkorn when do I get to try them out Beth?  I love me some tortilla!
@mediaphyter I can't make any sense of it, I would much rather have people follow me because of the content of my discussions, not some spam
@soyjournalista smart thinking, you want to get your wings before the great chicken wing famine of 09' kicks into full gear!
@LividUndead I'm not sure if I love hating them, or hate loving them more...it will all work out in the end though!
@crumcake An upgrade, and yes time has already told that he's done more for diplomacy than bush did in two full terms of failed policy
@beckycosta thats like calling Obama the new Bush...when its an obvious upgrade   :P
@kwells2416 I was really impressed with the fact that instead of receiving presents he let people spend millions on commercials instead
@Katrina1064 Well maybe its time to start doing something...
@crumcake you seem quite active to me I guess its all perspective though, I perceive you as interesting without the need to view your poetry
@douxpluie do you treat her like a puppy also?  I et if you did that, and had her fetch some stuff she would be a lot more lazy
@crumcake I've never been to your site probably never will I don't care for poetry, but that doesn't mean I'm not interested in what you say
I took the day off work again today, productivity will be high...cube life is soon to be a bad memory rather than a bad reality #whoami FREE

RT @paulgram Just had someone DM me to ask who they should be like on Twitter. I told her to be authentic, be yourself. It's a must!
@kwells2416 It would be managable without I assume, but there are some nice features of tweetdeck that you'll love no matter what  :D
@kwells2416 I wish I would have started using it as soon as I started, its a great program!
@douxpluie I hate people having too high of expectations, which I'm sure is the case  ;)
@garyvee I think in that scenario people would be more like to find other means of disposal rather than let loved ones clean it up for money
I love the #warmsmile of @PRsarahevans, @plato1123, @douxpluie, @bethkorn, @mrsocial GO SEE!!
@plato1123 you should come out to sw and check out the shrubbery...
