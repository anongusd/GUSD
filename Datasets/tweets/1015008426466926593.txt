We can talk, share a laugh, a cry, or just listen. If you're hungry, I'll feed you. I will always do my best to be available... you are always welcome!! This is an old school value that has been lost to technology...a text, facetime, gif or emoji is NOT the equivalent.
My house is a safe zone. Firearms are welcome. Coffee can be on in minutes, and I've always got cold water, a glass of wine, a shot of Something, or a cold beer. My table is non-judgmental. Any family or friend who needs to chat is welcome....

@Rise_Soar_BFree No religion belongs in our schools or our politics..   people came to America to escape  religious persecution.  It is just as true today as it was 250 years ago.  No religion is different from any other.   People have their own believes and have a right to them.
@BoomalayBoom There isn't a fix for that, if god loves you he hooks you up.  No love for a Trump and no cards to play.  He was lucky his grandpa was a pimp in the early 1900's and didn't pay taxes either and hid it with a few  dummy places he "owned"..  the family tree of corruption runs deep.

Right down to the district of where your home is.  Its impossible to have voter fraud if things are done properly.
@jimmyvegas337 @Justsaytruth18 @steph93065 @POTUS @VP @FoxNews Thank you for actual facts.  Maybe the next election will be done more like American Idol..  Trump would love it to be more like a tv show.

@thebigjman57 @KashJackson2018 All I'm thinking is how can I fix everything and make a better world for my family, friends and you and yours.
@thebigjman57 @KashJackson2018 I agree..  but he just answered every question as if he was guilty.
@floppusdikahkus @KashJackson2018 He's a weirdo but I liked the post.  Sorry.
@NoOneEveryOne2 @KashJackson2018 I was too busy working and playing football and didn't have time to date or party.
@DLoesch None of it matters..  he doesn't deserve to be on the bench for 35 years.
@lucylurichards @KashJackson2018 I was dating my oldest daughters mom at the time and living together.   I don't even know you.  Why would you even want to say such things. At least the people with false allegations ligitamettly went to school with him.  I care about womens rights and would appreciate thoughts.
@xmisterwatsonx I didn't even date anyone in high school and only been with 5 girls most of them for years and proud to say I am happily married to a beautiful, smart and talented woman. https://t.co/lglGK13zm0
@MRoseDFBailey @KashJackson2018 I would never do anything like that..  I don't think his name should be dragged through the mud like it was today but all I see is a he said she said match on stage..  reasonable doubt is all I need to know he shouldn't be sitting on the bench for 30 or more years.
@xmisterwatsonx @KashJackson2018 I'm squeaky clean..  unlike our president and people he nominated I don't treat women like that.
@juliannemarken Yes..  Democratic.   But all parties are corrupt.   I would like to fix things.
@KashJackson2018 All I know is just because of reasonable doubt I would prefer not to have him be on the court of justice for the next 35 years .
@KashJackson2018 People like him are the reason I have to run in 2020.  I don't care how flimsy the allegation is.  You know he did these things. His high School calendar isn't going to save him.  3 women claim he was drunk and did crude things.

Most of our country has just been touched up a little over the past 40 years. Americans deserve a massive overhaul and Trump and rich people like him should help pay. it creates lots of jobs. Stimulates the economy and makes for a nice safer drive to work in the morning
The rich will have there tax cap removed and actually start equally pitching in to help save this country.  I don't even know a single road I can drive down without hitting a pothole..   little things like that need to be fixed immediately.   Bridges aren't safe either.
I'm not an elite..  I'll bring back our middle class..   the lower class won't exist and the 1%'ers that are rich ..   whome of which Trump just gave a massive tax cut while screwing over the other 90 something % of our country.
@realDonaldTrump so you make really bad decisions and are not a smart person.   Can't wait to run against you in 2020 if your not already in jail for being a moron. https://t.co/EbgAEXAmtq
