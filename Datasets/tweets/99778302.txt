@essenviews Birds of the same feather flock together &amp; we shouldn’t be surprised of the New England Patriots owner being caught on video visiting prostitutes. Wasn’t Trump caught on Access Hollywood bragging how he grabbed women by their Pussy?  So it’s no secret.This’s what they do everyday
@Vicster1234 @realDonaldTrump Trump has fed you all with corruption Kool-Aids and you all will believe anything he says. Just like when Trump said he can shoots and kills anyone from 5th Avenue Apts &amp; he will still not loose his fans. The media’s are doing their jobs by being transparent and telling the truth
@realDonaldTrump @Vicster1234 Trump is a shady president because he is incompetent and deceitful and dishonest person.
@realDonaldTrump @Vicster1234 Whenever the truth of your corruptions surfaces you always called it fake news just like you’re so bad to the country. Russians helped to elect you. You’re the enemy of the Truth and you’re a disgrace to humanity. Shame on you for not allowing Barr to release Mueller’s Reports.
@realDonaldTrFan Did Trump just say someone is totally dishonesty?  Was he looking at the mirror to see himself as the biggest liar and the most corrupt president America has ever elected?.  Trump is deceitful, crooks and he is worse than Richard Nixon.

@joncoopertweets Let’s face the truth here. Don’t you feel like we’re living in Banana Republic or third world countries considering what has happened since 2016 and what’s is happening now with our democracy?  Looking back to people who pleaded guilty for lying and those who were convicted too.
@joncoopertweets Trump’s name will not only be taught in history books for future generations but also become synonymous like Judas. His treasonous acts was enough to charge him after he leaves office.  It saddens me to know that GOP continues to support him after what he had done to our nation.

@60Minutes @givemepie360 I truly believe McCabe that Rosenstein did raised the questions.  I believe Rosenstein will cites the same information in his future book because all of them who were in trump administration during this chaos will definitely write a book to tell their sides of the story.
@human___design @BSkylstad Omg- can H&amp;M trust him with their customers information?  Just saying?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe if you didn’t seek the aides of Russians to win the election and betrayed our democracy, Mueller investigation wouldn’t have started.  In the history of America you’re the only president that has ever invited a foreign adversaries to rigged our election to benefit you.
@realDonaldTrump @KimStrassel @WSJ We hope Trump don’t infuse William Barr to accept his loyalty pledge.  As soon as Barr cites the rule of law and say no to to Trump’s request that’s when trump will starts calling him a weak and low level person.  There we go again and it’s a matter of time.
@realDonaldTrump Trump using this border wall emergency to defused Russians investigations coverage.  You’re a master of manipulation. You’re taking money from our Military families to build your fancy border wall. Our military men and women are putting their lives on the line for our freedom.

@SheviStories There was no emergency. Trump is the master of manipulation and he is using Emergency declaration to build wall to cover Russians investigations.  He is a liar because he said he didn’t need to build Southern border wall which appeared to undermine his claims of an urgent problem
@1reddragon696 How can his wife have the audacity to say she fears her husband is in danger when her husband shot another human being 16 times and put him 6ft under?  I’m sorry to say your husband deserves whatever comes on his way.  That’s Karma.
@ChinaUSFocus Trump has no idea what kind of relationship existed between China and the United States.  His presidency is like a Reality Show.  He can’t read or write correctly without misspelling the words. Trump is an incompetent president whose leadership sucks.
@Helenhs Trump said Southern border wall was an emergency.Then he claimed he didn’t need to this which appeared to undermine his claims of an urgent problem on the southern border.  This is to show that he is using border wall to create news that will superseded Russians Investigations.
@realDonaldTrFan What kind of a President would called teachers “dum” when he wasn’t able to spell “One”? Trump is the dumbest of all because he didn’t know that February has two R’s. The month of February has always have two R’s.  Go back to school Trump because you’re a disgrace to the nation.
@Helenhs I can’t put anything passed him because Trump has no truth in his DNA. You wondered how such a person becomes our president.  Thanks to Russians.
@atrupar What a shameful moment for Pence.  They refused to clapped for a corrupt president. I think they hate to hear his name and for that reasons they refuses to acknowledged Pence’s presence.
@nickiknowsnada Bullshit because he is a liar.
@LawWorksAction William Barr has already been confirmed.  But If he refuses to disclose the Mueller final reports, then American people should take to the streets to demand the final reports be disclosed.  This is not Banana Republic but United States of America where we abides by the laws.

@onlykellyclark @politico None of them should resign.  Trump was caught on Access Hollywood tape bragging how he grabs women pussy and yet he won the presidency.  Cavanaugh got confirmed to the highest court of the land. I am sorry people are out seeking attention that they didn’t get  at home.
@onlykellyclark @politico Why do you report a car accident right away?  The same thinking should apply to anyone whose body was violated without consent.  I will NEVER keep such a horrible crime without reporting it to the police. I will have a police report in my hand to prove I told the authorities.
@onlykellyclark @politico Kelly, I agree with the statistics but let’s wait for the investigations. I’m not believing anyone in this matter.  I don’t believe Mr. Fairfax and I don’t believe these women either. The truth will come out one and other. As a woman I would have reported this incident to police.
@onlykellyclark @politico I highly support a thorough investigations in this matter.  I’ve 3 sons and 2 daughters and I wouldn’t want my sons to be in this situation when they rises to power &amp; some woman or women would ruined their lives 4ever.

@onlykellyclark @politico I absolutely know exactly what I will do when something terrible such as (RAPE) happens to me. I will call the police regardless of the situations surrounding it.

American people deserves to know Mueller Investigation Reports.  I’m afraid Trump will ensure that the Reports wouldn’t be released to the public. As Americans the Justice Dept owes us the obligation of releasing Mueller investigation reports.  It’s 21st centuries Investigations.
If Trump has nothing to hide why was everyone that has worked for his Campaign lied about Russians?  Why did all of them decided to lied to protect Trump &amp; damage their reputations?  There’s enormous of evidence Mueller investigations have gathered about Russians investigations.

@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson You’re here worrying unnecessary things while ignoring federal workers who haven’t paid their rents or feed their children.  This shows how incompetent you are.  Why can you Resign and call it day?
@realDonaldTrump Just reopen the govt &amp; then negotiate the funding of the Wall. Middle class people are hurting. This Shutdown is how you'll be remembered as the worst President in the History. I understanding you're a billionaire &amp; you've no idea of trying to buy gas &amp; no money in your bank acct
As Mueller investigations approaching the end, I’m	afraid we may not see the Reports. Russia investigation is the most pressing	national security investigation of our time and history will judge Justice	Department harshly if the they failed to release the Reports to the Public.
@thomaskaine5 By the way America, why is Trump getting away with all these criminal things he is doing?  What is going on that Republicans are so scared of him? They need to say something because Trump has broken every law in the book. United States is looking more like 3rd world countries.
@thomaskaine5 What does Michael Cohen got lose by testifying what he knows about this Mob Boss that America elected as our President?  Trump is using a scare tactics on Michael and he has fell for it. Trump knows that Michael's testimony would definitely bring him down to rubble. This is crazy
It is a shame that Michael Cohen postponed his testimony Trump witness tampering.  It looks like we are living in a different United States of America considering what is happening, https://t.co/XiOlTdrCj0
@business DONALD TRUMP IS A REAL MOB BOSS. INTIMIDATING A WITNESSES IS WHAT MOB BOSS DOES.  MICHAEL COHEN TESTIMONY WILL BRING TRUMP DOWN “BIGGLY” IN TRUMP’S OWN WORDS.  AGAIN  DJT WILL GO DOWN BIGGLY. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
@CNNPolitics What does Micheal Cohen got to lose?  He is going to prison anyway?  He will be an idiot if he let Trump’s intimidation stops him from testifying.  What is happening in America is outrageous.  Are we living in the 3rd world country now?
@CNNPolitics Trump is scared of Michael’s testimony because Trump knows Michael knows where all the dead bodies are buried.
@CNNPolitics 18 U.S. Code 1512 - Intimidation &amp; Tampering with witness.  President Trump has violated every single law in the book and he is still sitting in the White House as a President.  This is really crazy!  Is this United States of America?  He knows Mike testimony will bring him down.
What’s going on with our Nation?  Our Democracy is a limbo when a President is threatening a witness (Michael Cohen)and his family and GOP continues to turn their blind eyes on what’s happening.  This is unacceptable America.

it’s unacceptable that DJT &amp; his Yes Men GOP haven’t stepped up to end this unprecedented shutdown. The longer this drags on, the more middle class Americans feel the consequences. Fed employees are missing the paychecks they count on to pay their bills while GOP are getting paid
@2020fight That stupid kid was so disrespectful to the Native American protestors.  Damn idiot.
@realDonaldTrump : it’s absolutely unacceptable that DT and his GOP cronies haven’t stepped up to end the unprecedented shutdown. The longer this drags on, the more everyday Americans feel the consequences. Fed workers are missing the paychecks they count on to pay their bills.
@realDonaldTrFan I AM SURE YOU ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE YOUR COOKED UP LIES AGAIN.  I HOPE YOU RESIGN SO AMERICA CAN BE AT PEACE AGAIN.
@realDonaldTrFan TRUMP RESIGN!  RESIGN!  RESIGN!!!
@realDonaldTrFan You are no good for our country democracy and you should announce your resignation please!
They’re really 100% Party of Putin and shame on them! https://t.co/UjQ2qdGxG7
@LunaLuvgood2017 Glad to know he doing much better!  God will hear our prayers and he will continue to do better and better!  Thanks for the update 💙
@realDonaldTrump Why can’t you talked about your deception of taking the Interpreters notes and encouraging Michael Cohen to lie to the Congress about the Moscow Tower Project?  You’re a liar and you need to Resign because you’re not fit to be a President.  You sold our democracy to benefit you.
@LunaLuvgood2017 @MzLisawilliams I’m sorry to hear you and your family are going through this painful ordeal.  I will be praying for you and your family
@tomselliott Hold on for a second, did you say over Senator Graham homosexuality?  Oh wow!
@mkraju Trump has to worry about Michael Cohen the fixer who paid a Tech Company to Rig Online Polls in favor of Trump.  This is really crazy.  Donald, please Resign now because you’re disgrace to the entire country. Shame on you.  Trump, you’re a Mob Boss no doubt about it.
@BrianKarem Trump’s letter to Nancy Pelosi shows us his level of experience in governing the nation. Trump is acting like 5th grader.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, do you really understand that this shutdown is hurting our economy and the financial security of hundreds of thousands of families?  Pls do America a favor and Resign.  Let someone rebuild the damage you have done to this nation.  You’re a disgrace to USA 🇺🇸
@AdamParkhomenko Kushner’s advice was Trump downfall.  Firing Comey let to Mueller investigations. Trump and Kushner lack governing experience.  They knew what transpired during Trump Campaign and they thought they could cover it up by getting rid of Comey.
@JohnWDean @CCourtneyclift Trump has to pay Russians back for helping to elect him as a president.
@essenviews The GOP has become yes men to Trump Administration and I have no doubt that Trump was a Russian’s agent.  Trump may have been their agent long before he became a President.
It’s a shame to see our Civil Servants flooding the Food Banks looking for food to feed their families while Trump thinks this is a joke.  This Shutdown was unprecedented and Trump knows it.😭😭😭😭
It is obvious that America is a chaos when federal employees are standing in line for hot meals at shelter homes across America.  Make no mistake that every American will feel this mess one way or another that Trump has created for middle class people. DT Reopen the government!
Chaos in America due to symbolic nonsense like the border walls.  It’s what happened when we elected inexperienced President to govern our nation. People are hurting without their paychecks! Members of Congress are carrying on with their lives while getting paid. Reopen the govt!
@CNNPolitics You are absolutely right about going to prison because Mueller will soon come up with his final reports, then you will charged and sentenced to prison for collusion

@GovIfeanyiOkowa Mr. Okowa, I’m hoping you’ll put infrastructure in your 2019 agenda. I visited Agbor this past October and I was disappointed how little the town has improved.  Hopefully, you will be elected for a 2nd term and do better jobs for Deltan people not just Ika South, North or East.
@TrendsOfNigeria @GenneyU @OlisaOsega @ani_nomso @OsasCruz @UcheDandyMUFC @DrOlufunmilayo @Uchekush_ @LadiSpeaks @mp_maniac Who is she?
Mr Okowa was this video your campaigning platform in moving Deltan forward?  I would have loved to see video of you on the Podium telling the Deltans what you had done for them and what you will do if elected again. https://t.co/AvkBGlXPkh
DT is clueless how Americans nationwide have been impacted by his reckless leadership.  People cannot pay their bills dues to Shutdown.  Trump is incompetent to lead and he should be reading the Constitution instead of watching TV to relying on governing.
Trump has inflated economic hardships on federal employees by his continuous Shutdown of the government.  It’s easy for him to say he will continue the Shutdown way beyond months or years because he is a billionaire and he doesn’t care about these employees welfare.
Impeachment is the right word.  Resignation is the correct word.  You have done enough damage to our nation and people across the globe are watching this reality show taking here. Resign now Mr. President. Thank you! https://t.co/5FoErsRw40
DT is hallucinating &amp; he says Dems impeachment talk is 2020 ploy.  DT called himself the most popular president in history?  Wow!  DT, you’re the worst and most corrupt mob boss America elected with the help of the Russians interference as a republican president in party history.

@DogmaFree71 @realDonaldTrump By the way, did Trump not campaign that Mexico will pay for the Wall?  So what happened?  He will not get the Wall.  You’re all dreaming!
@DogmaFree71 @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn’t know much about this so call Mexico Border Wall.  The cost of the Wall is still unknown — $5 billion is an estimate not including how much of it will be a wall at all. A barrier stretching from coast to coast is “unlikely,”
@jokerwhite04 @realDonaldTrump Joker White, please bear in mind that Wall or no Walls Immigrants will still come into this country.  Would Trump build Walls in the air and stop flights from bringing in Visitors?
@realDonaldTrump 5 Billion dollars is enough to help homeless Veterans.  These are the people who fought for our freedom and they have continued to fight to protect us.  Boarder Wall is not the solutions.
