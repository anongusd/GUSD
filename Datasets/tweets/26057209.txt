It is my goal, my hope, and my aspiration that all the women in our Congressional district feel appreciated, feel that their opportunities to contribute are commensurate with their abilities, and feel that Utah is the type of place where they can flourish and make a difference
I come from a long line of strong women. My mother held elected office and was, among other things, the first woman President of the Granite School Board. Throughout my life, I have witnessed women leading in meaningful and powerful ways.
Let's ask these candidates meaningful questions, listen to their best ideas, give them an honest and open-minded chance to make the case that their qualifications, skills, and policy positions make them the best candidates for the offices they seek.

How cool it is that on a Saturday night you are all here talking politics. I have a feeling that if more people were doing this, we'd have a better chance of holding our elected officials accountable. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Sometimes we are unfairly critical of coal, especially clean coal. I'm concerned about the parts of our district whose economies are dependent on coal. We need to invest in diversifying these economies. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Without the individual mandate, I think we will start really dealing with things that are driving up the cost of health care. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
You should never buy insurance for things you can afford to pay for. That's the point of catastrophic care. But under the individual mandate, this model didn't work. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Individual mandate: some people were paying a penalty rather than sign up for health insurance because they couldn't afford it. How does that make sense? They can't afford health insurance, so we penalize them? #utpol #CurtisTownHall
I can't imagine a bill passing that doesn't resolve the DREAMers issue because that's why we are having this dialog. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
We need to talk about border security. We should secure the border in the most cost-effective, efficient way. In some sections of the border, that may be a wall. But we would need to know that this is the best, most cost-effective solution in this spot #utpol #CurtisTownHall
There is a very conservative immigration bill moving through the House. It will probably not pass the Senate. I will support the bill. We have to pass a bill in order to pursue the process of finding the right solution that can pass both bodies. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Immigration system is broken. We have jobs here in Utah that we can't fill. There are people who are willing to come here, obey the laws, work for a time, and return to their countries. I hope we can make progress on that. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Two major ideas on immigration: 	Do something for Dreamers.	Improve border security. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
There seems to be momentum in Congress for finding an immigration solution. There seems to be the political will to make something happen here. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
My legislation increases law enforcement to protect the antiquities in Bears Ears area. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Most people agree that we shouldn't mine in area of original Bears Ears designation. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Regarding Bears Ears. Everybody wants the same thing: to protect this area. The disagreement is about how best to do that. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
UT Legislator: Can you make sure the federal government doesn't tell us what to do?	Response: I know what you mean. I was a mayor. I appreciate the problems of taking away local control. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Taking federal money increases the price tag on infrastructure projects by 30-40%. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Utah has done a much better job than most states on keeping infrastructure current. So I feel protective of Utah. I am not in favor of giving money to states who have not done that.
Elections matter. Only 30% of Provo residents voted in the last election. You will never hold elected officials unless you hold them accountable. People need to be engaged. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Those of us in the gun industry need to show leadership. Fire arms experts know guns better than anyone. We don't have all the answers, but we do have many. We need to present solutions to the problem of gun violence. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
We protect sporting events, concerts, airports; politicians get body guards. If we put a fraction of that security in our schools, it would be an improvement. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
Most teachers are not qualified to carry a fire arm. Some may be. Those who are willing to go through training could be valuable deterrents. It's time to at least have a debate about it. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
It's a mistake to say gun violence is totally a federal issue. Every area should be accommodating to their specific needs and threats. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
In the gun debate, we cannot retreat to our typical positions. We need to talk about every idea and debate it. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
We need to talk about the security of our schools. It's time to talk about single-entry schools. #utpol #CurtisTownHall
We need to train schools, community officers, etc on warning signals for potential tragedies. #utpol
We have been unable to pass legislation to ban products that make a legal weapon illegal. We need to pass that. #utpol
We have to enforce our current gun laws. #utpol
My professional background is in the firearms and shooting range industry. I'm a gun guy. #utpol
I've learned that when something happens, people expect me to respond immediately. I like to take time to give a thoughtful response. #utpol

@elforesto @UTOPIAFiber Not surprised. BTW, what's your opinion on Net Neutrality?
@elforesto @UTOPIAFiber Still think we should have gone with Utopia over Google Fiber?

Q: how can you help rural counties?	A: rural areas HAVE to have good reps. I can help with econ dev, plublic lands and federal overreach.
Q: what will you do for public outreach in the district?	A: this is very important to me, social media, blog, townhalls, we have good ideas.
Q: who has endorsed your campaign?	A: @GovHerbert, 23 mayors in the area, and Utah legislators and senators.
Q: what would you do to bring econ dev to Utah?	A: entrepreneurial spirit has been paramount to Provo-we can bring that to the district.
Q: where do Dems and Repubs have common ground?	A: I think we have more common ground than it seems. Good principles have no party lines.

Thank you for the great discussion today. I really enjoy this exchange. We'll be having another AMA next week same time.	#curtisforcongress
Q: what have you failed at?	A: tried bringing conservative principles to the Democratic Party and it was the wrong move. I learned a lot.
A: what advice do you have for President Trump?	Q: stop the tweets. üòÇ Keep working hard over seas. Keep working on getting healthcare right.
Broader sense: work to secure borders, tough on repeat criminals, reform system, restitution and a way for folks to become legal. https://t.co/cuAYYUaWxJ
Q: what is the role of the fed gov in public lands?	A: I believe local control is important. We need to find the right combo of resources.
Q: why congress and not Gov?	A: it's not what my heart is telling me to do. üòâ
Q: how will you work with Gov. Herbert?	A: I have a great respect for our Gov. They've worked hard to work on fed mandates. I want to help.
A: what did you learn on our rural tour?	Q: so impressed by people we met &amp; their great desire to preserve &amp; protect their land &amp; heritage.
Q: how will being a executive mayor help you as a legislator?	A: my experience helps me to understand complex problems. Both jobs need this.
A. What can you do for small businesses?	Q: I understand what regulations do to small biz and how the fed gov needs to get out of the way.
Q: how will my influence help the divisiveness in D.C.?	A: my work in Provo shows that I care about diverse opinions &amp; can be effective.
Disappointed in what is happening back in D.C. on healthcare. Was it the right answer? No. We cannot give up on this-refining is the answer. https://t.co/aubsG8JuMV
Q: Why are you running?	A: I have skills that are needed in Washington. I hope to impact what we're doing fiscally as a country.
Just came back from a rural tour. To be frank it was one of the best times we've had on the campaign so far. Heard 1st hand from residents.

That's a wrap! Thanks for following along! For more information please visit https://t.co/YCgaRY1Dcw. Thanks!
These trees will help us clean up our air here in Provo and encourage a more diverse bird population.
Ryan Stewart from BYU horticulture is leading a team of students who will hopefully propagate the tree-so in a way it will live on.
Some of the trees are healthy but will have to be removed, one tree in particular at 700 north and 300 east-a 100+ yr tree must come down.
Many of the maple trees along University right now are diseased and dying. They will all be replaced.
The route does necessitate the removal of about 300 trees. But about 800 trees--in addition to replacing 300--will be planted.
Pinwheels represent all the trees to be planted. 1,017 total! https://t.co/q7SStuvSRs

Downtown is enhanced by the new City Center Temple. Parking can be tricky downtown, but we feel that Temple parking seems to be good.
We want more airlines servicing our airport in the future. It's a complicated business. But we feel confident the airport will be expanding.
@darling_darla the shaking isn't solely about the speed, they're going pretty slow. But we will continue to have discussions about trains.
We believe when the mall does well East Bay does well. The new ownership is working hard to revitalize &amp; bring new restaurants to the area.
If you need specific help in getting on the bus from your bus stops please let the city know so we can engineer easier access.
We're working on all our railroad crossing to eliminate the horns.
Utah Lake has a fast evaporation lake. We need more rainfall for Utah Lake to rebound. The harbor will be dredged this winter.
Talking about what's next: I suspect whatever I do next after being mayor will be exciting and I look forward to it.
We don't expect any problems with @googlefiber's announcement. SLC getting fiber is good for us too.
We need about 3.5 million to finish bicentennial park. Still work on that.
Status of bike park? It's funded and well-under way. Thanks to the residents and their sweat equity.
ETA on 3rd South? We are getting close to a completion date. We believe it's before the end of the year.
New Offspray development in south Provo, we were able to meet with developers to meet demands of residents.

What are we doing for tourism in Utah? @SpencerJCox: we're doing an excellent job. (Maybe too good.) Some of our Nat'l Parks are saturated.
.@SpencerJCox: We have a problem with criminal activity in our homeless pop. SLC bears the brunt of homelessness but this is a state prob.
Questions is about homelessness. @SpencerJCox: Utah is leading the nation in getting the chronic homeless into housing.
Will we ever have a major airline come to Provo? @SpencerJCox: growth can breed this kind of success. We are projecting a lot of growth.
Question abt refugees, what's the state doing?@SpencerJCox we see refugees thriving and giving back to the community. Programs are helping.
We took @SpencerJCox on our new Lakeview Parkway this morning which we hope will help build up our west side in a smart, sustainable way.
Provo City is working on solar farms.
To add, @SpencerJCox says our pollution is coming out of our tail pipes. We will have Tier 3 gas in Utah soon.
First question is about the solar panel veto. We need to find a way to protect the grid and encourage solar use.

Let's work to make this a city where our children flourish &amp; our grandchildren inherit the spirit of this great place. #stateofprovo

Thanks everybody. We'll do this again on May 18th 11:00! Of course you can always email me. It's not as exciting though.
@lancehnsn stay tuned with us. We will let you know.
@lancehnsn we continue to encourage Smith's to build a grocery store there but we're actively talking to others as well.
@SamOrTron you name the place and the time. Btw nice avatar. We're a handsome group aren't we?
@DavidTaggart we can have Energy do an analysis on that road. We're sending an email to them right now.
Thanks for your questions! Ten more minutes to answer any others you have for me.
@keatonjolley long term we'd love to see stronger investment in the area.
@JoshDance this is interesting. We're open to all solutions.
@keatonjolley don't have any to announce. Where would you like to go?
@DavidTaggart it's way the law was written--only homeowners get permits in the Seven Peaks neighborhood.
@keatonjolley yes exciting plans are underway for that development. Stay tuned...
@codyphill you're pretty cool too Cody.
@Gopropop I'd rather tell you my favorite child. And my fave pastime is answering Twitter questions.
@shan_sor it's as fast as it can go but we're working on frequency.
@shan_sor no that we're aware of. It's subsidized by taxpayers.
@j_heat1 Zane still can't beat me in basketball.
@DavidTaggart overnight parking encourages over occupancy in the units.
@jordanp311 yes! We've been working hard behind the scenes and have significant progress underway. Stay tuned!
@shan_sor in an upcoming election we'll be voting for an increase sales tax for transit. This will help increase the efficiency of FR.
