The attack on #JussieSmollett is nothing new to folks who are #LGBTQ and black and experience hate &amp; violence daily. It is our duty as a society to end violence against all queer people, especially queer people of color, and increase resources to support them.
We are also here to remember the at least 26 trans people who were murdered last year in the U.S. We are here for Dana Martin, a Black trans woman murdered in in Alabama last month &amp; for Candice Elease Pinky, a Black trans woman shot last week in Houston.
Standing in solidarity w/ #LGBTQ survivors of violence, including #JussieSmollett. Black LGBTQ communities, particularly black trans women, have been assaulted, murdered, and face violence every day. The normalization of violence against queer POC is UNACCEPTABLE. https://t.co/KHeEBdtOnW

The passage of this bill is especially meaningful today because @CatalinaCruzNY, the first DREAMer ever to be elected to the NY State Legislature, is there to vote for it. Catalina, you are an inspiration to us all and I am so proud of you. #NYDreamAct
I applaud the leadership of the youth who organized to pass the DREAM Act and the NY State Senate and Assembly for finally making this dream a reality. Incredible work @theNYIC, @MaketheRoadNY, @NYSYLC, @DRMAction, @LaColmenaNYC, @CUNYDREAMers &amp; @SUNYDREAMers!! #NYDreamAct
Not only is this legislation humane‚Äîbringing much needed relief to students &amp; their parents‚Äîit's also a common-sense investment in our collective future. #NYDreamAct
Today is truly a historic day for all New Yorkers, &amp; especially for our DREAMers. The passage of the DREAM Act in New York State reaffirms our values as a community that embraces all our immigrant brothers and sisters, regardless of their immigration status. #NYDreamAct

Another result of the #TrumpShutdown: funding for low income Americans at nutritional risk is running out. That means millions of children and vulnerable adults risk going to bed hungry. Horrific, but unsurprising from a man that separates families and cages children #NoWall https://t.co/iffY7Wd0to
As Speaker, I passed IDNYC, kicked ICE out of Rikers, and funded lawyers for undocumented immigrants. Did the city implode? Far from it. Violent crime is lower than ever in NYC and undocumented immigrants are more protected. Trump‚Äôs racist wall is based on LIES. #NoWall
Trump cannot hold our government hostage in order to build his racist wall. We must remain a country that offers shelter and refuge to all people regardless of immigration status, income, race, sexuality, gender, religion, ability, or country of origin. #NoWall #TrumpShutdown

This is no way to run a transit system that 5.5 million New Yorkers rely on daily.
Subway riders are sick of being lied to &amp; jerked around. After two years of being told one story, New Yorkers deserve to know what systematic failures led to a shutdown being deemed necessary before all options were explored.
Um, what? Of course everyone wants the subway fixed quickly &amp; running smoothly, but the MTA and the Governor owe New Yorkers the truth about why this new plan came so late in the game. Families moved neighborhoods, businesses suffered, &amp; suddenly the Governor says‚Äîjust kidding?

Nuestras voces son nuestra fuerza. No importa cu√°ntas veces los que est√°n en el poder intenten silenciarnos, DEBEMOS seguir hablando y exigiendo una ciudad m√°s justa, y m√°s equitativa.
Our voices are our strength. No matter how many times those in power try to silence us, we MUST keep speaking up and demanding a more just, more equitable, more fair city. https://t.co/meESrVv99t
We now have 3 white men occupying all citywide positions of leadership. In a city as diverse, as progressive, and as fierce as New York‚Äîthis cannot stand. https://t.co/UQ8FHizqng
There is a leadership vacuum in this city. Our elected officials are churning out tired excuses and defending the bureaucracy‚Äîinstead of fighting for us.
I will speak up for New Yorkers who are sick and tired of the city giving billions in tax breaks to @amazon. They deserve tax breaks about as much as Donald Trump deserves a medal of honor. #HQ2
Como su Defensora del Pueblo, hablar√© por los millones de usuarios del subway que est√°n siendo ignorados * que se le est√° mintiendo. Es hora de que los funcionarios electos asuman la responsabilidad, cesen las disputas * y arreglen el subway descompuesto.
As your Public Advocate, I will speak up for the nearly half a million NYCHA residents whose houses are falling apart, and for the millions of renters who are being pushed out of their neighborhoods. https://t.co/zLawsGr9G4
As your Public Advocate, I‚Äôll speak up for the millions of subway riders who are being ignored &amp; lied to. It‚Äôs time for elected officials to take responsibility, end the bickering &amp; fix the broken subway. https://t.co/ovweVxfy3C
Long before Trump arrived, when Obama refused to help undocumented immigrants stay in our country, I called him out for tearing families apart‚Äîand then led the fight to ban ICE from Rikers.
Cuando los inmigrantes indocumentados de nuestra ciudad enfrentaban la deportaci√≥n, exig√≠ abogados para todos los inmigrantes detenidos. Los reaccionarios dijeron c√≥mo nos ATREVIAMOS a financiar esto, pero lo hicimos realidad.
When our city‚Äôs undocumented immigrants were facing deportation, I demanded lawyers for all detained immigrants. The reactionaries said, how DARE we fund this‚Äîbut we made it happen. https://t.co/nTZT78aEfn
When black &amp; brown New Yorkers were being charged as criminals for staying in a park after dark, I said we must decriminalize low-level offenses. Commissioner Bratton said it was too dangerous‚Äîbut we got it done.
I was the first citywide official to call for closing Rikers Island‚Äîand Mayor de Blasio said it was a ‚Äúnoble idea.‚Äù But we brought community activists and elected officials to the table‚Äîand now Rikers is closing for good. https://t.co/roqnXql30z
When women are told to be quiet, it‚Äôs meant to silence us. Because when we speak the truth, loudly, aggressively, we can change the world. https://t.co/HTEcyVGPaW
I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm too loud, too aggressive. What they mean is that as a woman, I should be calm. Should be tame. Should apologize for who I am.
Nuestros funcionarios electos siguen dici√©ndonos que el subway est√° mejorando. Siguen diciendo que las reparaciones de NYCHA se est√°n acelerando. Pero no vemos los cambios. ¬øEstamos locos o est√°n mintiendo?
Our elected officials keep telling us the subway is getting better. They keep saying NYCHA repairs are speeding up. But we don‚Äôt see the changes. Are we crazy‚Äîor are they lying?

So the $300k+ taxpayer funded @GWtweets study is out. #1YearAfterMaria. And surprise, surprise (NOT), it confirms what we already knew &amp; what the @ricardorossello admin refuses to publicly admit/recognize. THOUSANDS, yes THOUSANDS dead. We deserve better.	https://t.co/xnPwDaVe3G

Add your voice, join the call. 		Log onto https://t.co/B6SbAfWkPa to find an event near you marking #1YearAfterMaria. Puerto Rico nos necesita. Puerto Rico needs us.
@Pwr4PuertoRico's position is that none of the federal funds allocated to address the devastation caused by #HurricaneMaria can go to paying the debt AND that designation of funds must have authentic community input/planning. We cannot allow #DisasterCapitalism to take hold.
And many of the proposals presented (during the rushed &amp; inadequate public comment period) would displace ‚Äúhistorically vulnerable communities who have been unable to access any information around CDBG-DR processes or the projected plans‚Äù
"@HUDgov has set aside $20B in Community Development Block Grants‚ÄìDisaster Recovery (CDBG‚ÄìDR) funds to help the island recover. On July 30, HUD approved an action plan that will determine how the island will spent the first $1.5 billion in CDBG‚ÄìDR funds it received."
‚ÄúThese are the funds that are going to determine how Puerto Rico is going to look like in the next 20 yrs,‚Äù Ariadna Godreau-Aubert Ayuda, Ayuda Legal Hurac√°n Mar√≠a.		Advocates say vulnerable Puerto Ricans left out of $1.5B recovery planning process https://t.co/O4qF1zDvYJ

Let's continue to agitate, tell our stories and demand justice for every person whose humanity is being stripped by this bigoted &amp; racist admin. I am committed to this. It's my moral obligation. I hope you feel it is yours too. 4/4
No child should be seperated from their parents PERIOD And nobody should be ok with it happening to others just because you think it can't happen to you. Alexandra needs to be reunited w/ her family. Here. In her home. 	#FamiliesBelongTogether 3/
I treat others how I want to be treated. W/ dignity &amp; respect. Anything other than that is unjust &amp; manifests into inequality. We must demand justice every day &amp; demand better from ourselves and our government. 2/
This admin's inhumanity is inflicting long-term harm on thousands. This story, though, has me struggling to reconcile the indifference those who choose to support this tyrant show to lives of others because they see themselves as privileged class that will be held harmless. 1/ https://t.co/UKOPsBq7Wx

It's shameful that New York State is at bottom when it comes to election reforms and facilitating voting. Listening to @AlexPadilla4CA @SOTSMerrill #JimCondos at #NN18 panel on Protecting the Vote I am inspired by what can be achieved. https://t.co/41JBOlyDGz

@AlexPadilla4CA is fighting the good fight. Secretaries of State have a responsibility to protect our voting rights &amp; facilitate greater voter engagement, not suppress our vote.
