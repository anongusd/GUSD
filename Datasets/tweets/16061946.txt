Let’s say these future executive moves even get congressional reprogramming approval. Doesn’t take away that it was a reverse move by the executive that weakens the power of the legislative branch. And it could lead to billions and billions in government spending.
Oh yea maybe, also, the argument is made that school shootings due to lax gun laws and weak school security largely due to a lack of resources have left kids at risk. It’s an emergency, they say! And the accounts are raided.
So #POTUS whomever they are say hey, the dilapidated state of the nations’ public schools &amp; the unequal burden we have placed on distressed communities including those impacted by recent disasters in the last decade have left the public buildings a danger to students.
Let’s say Democrats take Senate and keep House for simplicity’s sake to show what Trump could have done with wall earlier in the game and theoretically go unchallenged.
Ok but hear me out for a second on the emergency declaration and what GOPers may face in the future for those who believe the wall move was something of a Pandora’s box. This is a good exercise.

@PapaSwamp @MicahGrimes @CQnow Floor procedure where minority can change the bill. When GOP change won, House then voted on passing it with the Republican amendment added. 		Why "recommit"? GOP action sent the bill ~theoretically~ back to a committee for a SPLIT SECOND before Dems got it back on the floor.
Wondering if Democrats believe this, or whether they thought they lost today. Because Republicans are definitely celebrating this as a victory against majority. https://t.co/KUJvBzoZNF
On appropriations SPECIFICALLY, Republicans made a BIG DEAL in the last couple years in some groups to commit to vote for legislation if their amendments were adopted. So vote against the bill by Republicans, after MTR adoption? Somewhat ironic.
This is twice in less than a month now that a motion to recommit has passed from Republicans in the Democratic House, in less than a month. Just procedurally, this is VERY UNUSUAL! Typically motion to recommit is made by minority party w largely partisan, ceremonial intent.
Omg! Republican motion to recommit on the gun bill in House passes, which adds notification if an undocumented immigrant purchases a firearm. @CQnow
"I think there's talks, you know, of trying to figure out what would be the easiest way to actually get all those things done," @JohnBoozman said today when I asked if lawmakers were talking about this being a vehicle for things like debt limit and budget deal.

Now I happily live in my rent-controlled little box and can proudly say I've managed to shave down the cost of my roof to ~33 percent of my income after taxes. One day.....EQUITY!
Then there was that one time I paid nearly $1400 to live in one room of a rowhouse where I shared a bathroom with four people on 25th and H. Give me a break, I had just moved here.
People don't realize how much we bust JUST TO MAKE RENT. One time when I wasn't making a living wage I shelled out just for a twin bed of a 4-person family's house they inherited from their parents, and had another roommate who was not related in a room down the hall.
RT @tatecurtis: That could pay for 12 junior reporters or six senior ones every year. Just saying. https://t.co/6p4ql5eAQj
Housing stipends for senior staffers, as the news is ruminating over today, are one of the more stinging aspects of inequalities in the journalism industry.
tonight is going to be interesting, that's for sure.
National debt: 	*78 percent of GDP this year	*93 percent of GDP by 2029
*$383 billion on interest on the national debt this year.	*Interest, fastest-growing budget category, will be 3rd-largest by 2025 &amp; totals $7 trillion over 10 years.
Interesting #s to consider with the State of the Union today, per @PIIE: 		*deficit this year: $897 billion — $118 billion more than last.	*$1 trillion annual deficits by 2022 and $11.6 trillion in total deficits over 10 years.
Yes, blowing on the charger port and plugging the thing back in still works for troubleshooting
*aka hamburger lettuce https://t.co/OzwA0ifIRQ
RT @JenniferShutt: icymi: In this week's CQ Budget podcast, @kelmej and I talk about the conference committee, the National Emergencies Act…
TL; DR: I asked for hamburger lettuce because the shredded lettuce was lame. It was a HUGE MISTAKE.
I had asked permission, but he didn't realize how GREEDY I WAS FOR THE GREEN LEAF. "THAT'S FOR SANDWICHES!" he bellowed. "YOUR HANDS HAVE TOUCHED THEM!" he cried. 		I had failed him. 		I apologized and left the carryout in shame, but it was a tasty salad. Beware!!!
MISTAKE 2 was grabbing an inordinate amount of hamburger leaves for this glorified gooey bean cheese rice cheese dip that I find consuming with Cool Ranch Doritos to be the optimum way to eat this big ol mexi treat.
So there's a lot of permutations now. You can have chips. You can have a big fry shell. You can have INDIVIDUAL CLAMSHELLS NOW. But I wanted a no-bowl salad. I wanted a SALAD. And asking for that green leaf, the one from the hamburger station, was mistake one.
One must comprehend how high the bar is for the taco salad man's patience. Or woman. It tends to switch from chamber carryout to taco day. They're all good souls.
It's my four year anniversary in DC and I think that means it's time for me to report on a historic moment today: I managed to anger the taco salad man.

What’s odd is how the CR devolves in shutdown talks to some kind of messaging in support of one side. It prolongs the shutdown by making the basic mechanics of funding government the defining terms of debate. instead of debate advancing or not, along with overall funding. https://t.co/18Oz72YXTF
Also of note will be telegrams members send about how the shutdown is hurting their constituents and what they’re willing to do to end it from senate lunches and votes. Oh and Hoyer Pen &amp; Pad at 11 gives more insight into dem messaging in House/broader strategy.
#teambudget also tracking the lunch rigamarole in the Senate today. Expect messaging from both sides about how the other side isn’t doing the right thing and their plan the other side has rejected is the solution. Look for anything that’s not a version of that.
There’s Rules on disaster aid today at 3, which is a must-follow for those gaming out a broader wrapup when the shutdown dysfunction is dealt with. at this point lawmakers are trying to parse the state of shutdown from conflict that caused it. But ultimately seven bills waiting.
House action on messaging bills to fund govt though the D majority would argue with you vociferously they are in fact bills to fund government (they are “clean” CRs, but that’s not the baseline anymore to resolve last minute funding.) follow @JenniferShutt for today’s action.
So today there’s a multitude of little screws turning on the shutdown, but nothing really akin to light at the end of some tunnel yet, if that somehow exists. Sometimes it feels we are in fact on a conveyor belt to a cliff.

"We can solve this in minutes, and these workers should be able to be paid. It only takes a few minutes inside the meeting, but when Democrats will not even make a  counter-offer, it's unacceptable," McCarthy adds on @FaceTheNation.
"We can't have this government reopen, the president is correct,"  @GOPLeader said when asked directly why government can't be opened while negotiations continue. Wants a broader deal or at a minimum: "I would take the language that we had before," (House approps bill w/ $5B).
But the caveat is that Graham also supports declaring a national emergency if and when that CR expires and there's no deal. It is, however, a discrete opening of an R saying, let's just open back up government now and deal later. https://t.co/S2lLlQBC6D
Was actually quite significant today that @LindseyGrahamSC floated a three-week CR directly to @realDonaldTrump on @FoxNewsSunday. It's an actual change in position of a top Republican appropriator who's saying, let's end shutdown since you agree we need a bigger deal. @CQNow

Put another way if the president were to make good on his threat to veto spending legislation without WALL - which he didn’t even do and the government has shut down - the Congress then would get an opening to overrule him.		Right now process doesn’t allow for this possibility.
If #POTUS vetoed a stopgap -simple date change to fund govt- the Congress could then override his veto.		The government can open without the executive.

It's the law that if the shutdown lingers into late January, under current law the OMB would force $839 million in cuts from nonexempt programs.	That's what's left on the pay-as-you-go #PAYGO "scorecard" for 2018.

One other key @SenatorDurbin quote from @FaceTheNation  interview: "We’re  in a position now when  the  president makes these  claims and promises, a  lot of us ...are a little bit  skeptical."

It’s not like I ENJOY cleaning under my kitchen sink I mean what do people even think
@jbarab @CQnow Ease your mind, sir
.@davidcicilline on @FoxNewsSunday boils down a Democrats' view I'm hearing a lot in the House: "The govt will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate &amp; the president come to their senses &amp; recognize they shouldn’t be shutting down the government if they don’t get their way."
Interesting wrinkle from SHS: "We’ve been having this debate for years. At some point  we have to say  enough is enough until we can come together we can be reasonable." Can you force debate - that results in billion$ - through a shutdown? History says nah, not really.
#WH Press Sec. SHS, cont., re: shutdown endgame: "I think at some point they [Democrats] have to decide that they care more about Americans than fighting the president. And so far, we haven’t seen a willingness on their side to fully do that."
SHS continues re: POTUS threat partial shutdown could go on 'years': "Absolutely the president means what he says when he says that."	At fault? Democrats: "They agree with the president, they agree that we need border  security, they just are unwilling to let this president win."
WH Press Sec. SHS: on the shutdown overall: "I think that’s one of the things that people misunderstand. The president’s not fighting for the wall. He’s fighting for the protection of American citizens."
.@SHSanders45 set the tone from the WH POV, along with @MickMulvaneyOMB who made separate appearances this AM on separate networks.
OK so there were a whole lotta castles in the sky today at the shows, a whole lotta well-worded assessments of what's going on, and a whole lotta NOTHING as to how the heck the government gets out of this wormhole it's fallen into w/ the #FY19 shutdown. Key quotes:

The idea they could consider a wall an anomaly and maybe more anomaly funding for HHS to do the shelters? Maybe there’s a compromise. But arguing for either of these packages dems and Republicans currently say they want are really from both parties getting nowhere new.
There’s an entire argument being waged between staff actually involved that giving money for the wall, at some agreed to level, is possible when a wrapup is included of the six other unfunded bills. Sticking $5b on top of a CR isn’t something that’s being agreed to.
Ugh, seriously ppl if you’re gonna argue approps please appreciate the fact that putting extra money for a certain project on top of a CR is not REGULAR ORDER OR EVER REALLY DONE.

Aaaaaand the winner goes to 		VICE PREZ TIEBREAKERS: 		2018: VP Pence breaks 6 (!!!) 	2010 (and the entire Obama presidency): VP Biden breaks NONE
@lex_samuels ALL MASSIE NO PASSIE
There were fewer Public Laws (PLs) created in 2018 than 2010. 	  	2018: 125 House bills get PLs. 54 Senate. 	2010: 178 House; 80 Senate.		Total bills passed lower too: House passed bills = 922 in 2010 vs 717 in 2018. 	Senate bills passed = 569 in 2010 vs 481 in 2018.
2018 also saw fewer votes in the House &amp; Senate.	House: 500 recorded votes in 2018, 664 recorded votes in 2010.	Senate: 274 recorded votes in 2018, 299 recorded votes in 2010
@clouddottir I'm broken inside
And we have the 2010 Senate Democrats winning with working days in the Senate too, with the pro formas taken out: 	2018: 189 days w/ 41 pro forma (Rs)	2010: 158 days, w/ 8 pro forma. (Ds)
House session days = 172 days	# that were pro forma, meaning no legislative business took place = 61 	Compare to 2010, where just 7 of 127 days = pro forma. 	(which means technically Ds had more working days than Rs in this comparison)
So CSPAN decided to compare 2018 to 2010 since they were both second years of a presidential term where the president's party also controlled both houses of Congress. Here are some of the factoids that stood out to me.

So now, per multiple GOPers at the #WH meeting, House is coming up w/a combined package of a CR along with wall money and disaster aid. Awaiting 	-what that looks like 	-where it comes from.
Now that House Republicans have said #POTUS wont sign the CR, there’s two explicit possibilities I see:	-Trump told McConnell he’d support the CR and is now changing his position	-McConnell put the Feb. 8 CR on the floor without knowing Trump’s position.
RT @MEPFuller: Doing a little math here.		We had 380 members vote this morning. A two-thirds majority to override the veto would be 255. We…
Now the question is - does the House precipitate a shutdown over wall, still? When there are nearly 20 Republicans who aren't coming back - at least 17 according to today's count. Is that even possible? This may all evaporate as a bunch of sound and fury in a matter of hours.
It's not like McConnell didn't figure out what the White House was willing to accept before he put it on the floor. In fact, he told us all at lunch Tuesday that's exactly what he was doing after his offer of fiscal 2019 Senate Homeland levels + $1 b fund was rejected.
KEY: what Republicans can convince Trump to do. Major issues remain: 	-The Senate will not fund the wall. 	-McConnell tried to knock down Trump's $5 billion to $1.6 billion plus a $1 billion "contingency fund." No dice. 	-McConnell went to Trump, he told us, and found path fwd.
Then lawmakers went home to sleep, I guess, and came back this morning to a very ANGRY House GOP conference, who all were rallying around attaching something to this stopgap. So now conservatives - and leadership - went down to the White House to meet with Trump about this.
Burgess even said at Rules he thought Republicans had the votes to sustain a presidential veto of a "clean" CR (what the Senate passed). That was kind of an odd moment that barely anyone in Washington heard, because it was around midnight. Then they recessed, debated about an hr.
At @RulesReps LATE Wednesday, Republicans on the panel expressed sympathy for conservatives' desire to put wall $ on the CR. Some, including Rep. Burgess, R-Texas, said that he wasn't sure what would happen with the stopgap vote on the floor, as did @PeteSessions.
This gave conservative Republicans leverage to again push for having a fight about the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Also, the Senate passed the bill Wednesday, which is pretty early when there's a shutdown brinksmanship fight, so there's time here. So they went to @RulesReps.
LEMME GIVE YA a little rundown of what's going on. The House Rules Committee wanted to pass a rule to consider a CR to Feb. 8 last night at 11 p.m., shortly after the Senate passed it by voice vote. But the whip count on the CR among House Republicans was BAD. @CQNow

"There are circumstances that we find ourselves under that we have to take into account," Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, says to border security amendment proposals before recessing shortly after midnight in @RulesReps.
So the Rules Committee recessed subject to the call of the chair, just after midnight.
"I'm just a humble backbencher toiling here in the Rules Committee," Rep. Burgess, R-Texas, says at @RulesReps meeting. Burgess says "we have been here before." 	"We thought we could jam the Senate at Christmastime and they just all left town," he says of Senate.
What they're trying to do is get a vote on the U.S.-Mexico border wall on the rule that lays out procedures for consideration of stopgap government funding to Feb. 8. "This is the last train out of the station, this is our last opportunity," Perry said. https://t.co/xqWyf0DXwr
Have a feeling Trump isn't watching Rules.

"I have no clue what is going to happen tomorrow with this bill," @PeteSessions says of the stopgap to Feb. 8 (HR 695). @CQNow
Noo-kyu-ler.
The waste is "in your freakin states," @RepShimkus says in @RulesReps. "This is your choice, and I'm not letting you off the hook," re: Nuclear waste amendment on the #CR.
"The basic thing is we have to pass the legislation in front of us to keep the government funded," @TomColeOK04 says, questioning the need for an amendment related to this nuclear issue on the CR, which needs to pass and be signed into law on midnight Friday.
There's some FUNDAMENTAL appropriations debate going on right now. @PeteSessions and @RepShimkus say that the Senate hasn't agreed to appropriate up to authorized levels for nuclear waste cleanup.
"Y'all have nowhere to hide, the waste is in your states,” Shimkus says of need to deal with nuclear waste.
Rep. Shimkus is talking nuclear waste right now in Rules. He's got amendment 10, and he wants more money to deal with it.
The House Rules Committee has reconvened (just after 11 PM EST) to consider a rule for a continuing resolution that keeps government funding on autopilot until Feb. 8 (HR 695). https://t.co/GpYmTSSwAj

“...They just have to have the guts to tell President Trump he’s off on the deep end here and all he’s going to get with his temper tantrum is a shutdown. He will not get a wall.”
Key @SenSchumer quote on @MeetThePress:  “When you talk to them privately, even publicly, a lot of [Republicans] have said a CR is much preferable to a shutdown....” 1/2
“...Even in the House which is a Majority Republican, they don’t have the votes for his $5 billion dollar wall plan, in fact [Speaker Paul D.] Ryan, afraid of what’s going to happen, sent all the House home till Wednesday night, a day and a half, two days before the shutdown.”
“President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form....”
Tiptoed around a direct question as to whether there was any “wiggle room” on the two proposals Democrats have offered to prevent the shutdown. But he said what Democrats have presented are what Republicans have supported in the past.
.@SenSchumer on the appropriations endgame on @MeetThePress means possibly not much has changed over the weekend w leadership talks on continuing govt funding, or they’re keeping it under wraps.

Questionable chyron choice: using the phrase “fake news” at all
The tone on the shows so far (granted, it’s the first hour block), is very very tired, from both Republicans and Democrats. It’s like they’re too winded from the campaign to start any new debate on tv....or maybe they don’t want to.....
DNC’s Tom Perez: “Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, they’re on the ballot.” On @CNNSotu
Confronted w/ ad that incorrectly blames Democrats for letting cop-killing immigrant into US (Clinton deported him, he came back under Bush II), #RNC’s Ronna McDaniel on @CNNSotu says immigration is a “systemic problem.” Debate didn’t really advance by pinning down error.
.@SenThomTillis on @FoxNewsSunday on preexisting conditions protections in @gop healthcare legislation: “even if some states opted not to cover or cover them in a way we didn’t want them to,” those officials would get “unelected very quickly.”

I always have thought approps is the kinda holy grail of congressional coverage bc it’s literally everything they spend. You can write about anything. But it’s discussed in these terms that put people to sleep and make them assume it doesn’t affect them. Striving to change that.

Funny how when people who happen to work in government learn you know appropriations they immediately ask about x or y program that affects them like you possess treasure knowledge		And yet members of Congress talk glibly about how “no one cares” about appropriations.

“The Senate is doing a pretty good job in its problem solving capacity,” @SenAlexander says, lauding more appropriations for military and scientific research on @MeetThePress. Says political climate much worse than it was before, though.
.@SenAlexander on potential for lack of public confidence for #SCOTUS Justice Kavanaugh on @MeetThePress : “it would be hard to have public confidence if you went through an inquisition like he did arranged by the Democrats.”
"A pox on both houses for the way that this was conducted," @JohnKasich says on @CNNSotu re: process to confirm Kavanaugh.
.@JohnKasich on @CNNSotu on GOP in the wake of Kavanaugh: "they can have a victory, but they cannot leave the person who loses vanquished."
.@LindseyGrahamSC, ping-ponging off a Roy Moore/Kavanaugh discussion between Wallace and McConnell, describes Judge Kavanaugh as "a man who's never been banned from a mall."
Pressed, McConnell won't speculate on how he'll act if Trump were to nominate a judge on the cusp of a general election, instead just points to "history" of no confirmation of a nom when the #POTUS and Senate are controlled by different parties.
Interesting moment that Chris Wallace tried to pin down here: McConnell suggests on @FoxNewsSunday that lack of confirmation of Merrick Garland was due to opposing party controlling the Senate when #POTUS sent nomination down.

Small clarification, while this is a vote to “proceed” to the nomination its by definition a vote to limit debate on the nomination. Essentially just saying a senator can agree to limit debate so that you can vote something down.
NOTE: vote to proceed can be indicative, but not necessarily, of a final vote tally on actual confirmation. For party purposes, as we saw Flake vote BK out of Committee despite “concerns,” majority requirement votes can be whipped differently. Similar to House rule vote.

This caps off, before the election, a robust spending process in both the House and Senate, with five bills enacted: a three-bill conference report first, with the Military Construction-VA, Energy-Water, and Legislative Branch bills (#HR 5895) which was signed into law Sept. 21.

If you think you’re going to cut off a @wmata bus downtown near the White House, you’re sorely mistaken. They’ll just nearly scrape your car as I saw outside the bus window 😂
And to predict that CBO would account for that in a scoring of a bill is also quite a stretch. That’s why appropriators changing mandatory spending programs is so confounding. The end result keeps the average Joe from even remotely understanding the actual budget.
How does this happen? Because money is AUTHORIZED for one purpose- and CBO assumes that if you’re going to spend it, it’ll be on the programs in law.		CBO can’t keep Congress from taking that money, pointing to the fact it won’t be spent, and using that “savings” for other stuff.
Which makes the “6y CHIP reauthorization would save $6 billion” headline from January really a great example of just how confounding budget scoring is, and how little it shows - bc the contingency fund and allotment funds being raided here remain in the reauth- which is now 10y
