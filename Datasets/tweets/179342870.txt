"Sex is nice and pleasure is good for you." #TES
questioning is the first step toward generating a new paradigm, your own paradigm of how you ought to be. #TES
Questioning "what everybody does" can be difficult and disorienting, but we have found it to be rewarding
...our values, our desires, our myths, our expectations. We don't notice them until we trip over them. #TES
We operate on these beliefs without even knowing we believe them. They're under our feet all the time, the foundation for our assumptions...
We have a problem with this. #TES
When you ask about a woman's morals, you are more likely to hear about whom she shares sex with, and under what conditions. #TES
