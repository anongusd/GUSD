@candicesahara This is also a common thing for many marine animals: manatees can be super mossy, &amp; baleen whales almost always have barnacles growing all over them. The only critters that don't have hitchhikers either swim super fast or slough their skin constantly. Sea turtles do neither. 2/2
@candicesahara Yes! Its suuuuper normal for moss to grow on sea turtle shells. These guys are crazy slow! So it's really easy for plants and animals to grow on their shells. 1/2

11. Take action: Tell your Governor to uphold the standards of the #ParisAgreement. https://t.co/UEwieIB5wk
10. Progress on climate is inevitable. We can get there. And so it moves. #ParisAgreement https://t.co/HGPRNEOdZv
9. @OurOcean will work with decision makers in Congress–Rep &amp; Dem–on the West Coast &amp; worldwide. We need action now. #ParisAgreement
8. @POTUS's inaction leaves a vacuum of leadership on climate. West coast states like CA, WA &amp; OR will lead the charge #ParisAgreement
7. But we have a chance. The pace of tech development in energy, transportation &amp; industry can make up difference in the US #ParisAgreement
6. The ocean’s ability to function, past a 2 degree warming threshold is in question. We can’t afford to find out the answer #ParisAgreement
5.From an ocean perspective, there’s no such thing as “America First.” The ocean is a global system of water, energy &amp; life #ParisAgreement
4. The ocean provides the air we breathe &amp; the food we eat. Adding heat &amp; acidity is the world’s biggest science experiment. #ParisAgreement
3.Sea level rise will impact our coastal communities and warming waters will impact our coastal economies. #ParisAgreement
2.This is personal: My home in New Orleans will be underwater and 500K residents will be displaced over the next 80 years. #ParisAgreement
