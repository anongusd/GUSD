Politics aside, its shameful that @SenateGOP @ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr are terrified to talk to or hear about issues women face daily; nor do they trust themselves to be respectful when questioning Dr. Ford. Their incompetence has been damaging to Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford.
Dear @realDonaldTrump given your own history as a known pu**y grabber you are in no position to lecture or judge whether or not a woman should be believed.  As leaders from around the world made clear today, you are a laughingstock.
Just now @SenateMajLdr said Dr. Ford allegations are unsubstantiated, he‚Äôs playing fast and lose with the facts and sure sounds like he doesn‚Äôt believe Dr. Ford or willing to consider legitimacy of her allegation. @gop has again abandoned decency &amp; fairness
