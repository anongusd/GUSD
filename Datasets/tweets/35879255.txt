@marcivgr @EdKrassen @BGraham_MA The president does not need the Supreme Court to federalize National Guard Troops. In the Civil War the South is known for wearing the greys and the origin of that lies in the fact that the army of the Confederacy was comprised National Guardsman.
No one talks about the crisis in YEMEN but it is was worse than Venezuela. We in NYC have many immigrants and refugees from there and no one has addressed this issue. These Yemenese in NYC are some of the hardest working people who own many Deli and Candy Stores. https://t.co/Xyt6XRA2wA
@EdKrassen @BGraham_MA In the Civil War most of the Southern Confederacy Troops were National Guardsmen so since then their colors were grey. That is why the SOUTH eventually decided to go all GREY with their uniforms because their ARMY was the NATIONAL GUARD. GO READ ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR.
@EdKrassen @BGraham_MA Read your history ... during the fifties the states used those same rights to oppress black people and they used the national guard. Presidents simply Federalize them and then they come under presidential control. SO GO READ A BOOK ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IT GOES BOTH WAYS,

This all part of the left vs right political game that if it continues is not good.
