@CollegeFix @douglasernst but, as a major, who meets with my advisor and have access to advising site i know that its needed for my major
@CollegeFix @douglasernst I agree with you there, that's why I reached out to let y'all know. They are slacking on clarification of reqs.
@CollegeFix @douglasernst can't speak for them... once again, just informing you that i need a US course for degree.
@douglasernst @CollegeFix yes, hatchet did report, but viewed same misleading website as u. DM me and I can explain.
@douglasernst @CollegeFix Merry XMas to you as well!
@douglasernst @CollegeFix agreed-admin messed up on website. just informing u,I can see my reqs. thru advising&amp;have to take a US course.
@CollegeFix @douglasernst just wanted to inform y'all that majors do still take s U.S.  class,even tho the Dept.'s wording is unclear (2/2)
@CollegeFix @douglasernst ur link to Hist dept. website,which doesnt list official degree req. not sure on 2nd part. (1/2)
@CollegeFix @douglasernst https://t.co/vNSOC87rSf this links to the uni. bulletin,which contains offcial major reqs&amp;is final say-so for reqs
@CollegeFix @douglasernst the link is the university bulletin with every major's req. if it says we have to take a US course, we do,&amp;it does
@CollegeFix @douglasernst article is misleading. as a major, we still are req. to take at least 1 Us course to get degree. (1/)2
@CollegeFix @douglasernst the phrasing is not good-but 3 categories are Europe,Us&amp; world-at least 1 upper lvl course must be taken in each https://t.co/DXcriXtLAK
@douglasernst @CollegeFix can easily be checked @ https://t.co/vNSOC87rSf , the departments major requirements(2/2)
