@RoKhanna Anyone who supports a Green New Deal has to tell us how they will pay for the Green New Deal. Last I checked a national tax on carbon dioxide would cost the U.S. economy $4.21 trillion to $5.98 trillion. Last emergency disaster bill was $12 billion.

@ajcalac @lawrenceamyc @indianz @RepMullin @IHSgov Or we could remove IHS from political fights all together by giving it advanced appropriations. Gov't shutdowns happen regardless of the political party. We hope HR 195, which funds IHS, will help build momentum towards advanced approps
