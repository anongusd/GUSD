Instead, let's push for permanent structural reforms (REINS, Mike Lee tariff bill, affirmative approval for emergency declarations, etc.) and make Democrats put up or shut up on abuse of executive power.
Republicans should not help Democrats undermine executive power of Republican presidents on an ad hoc basis while keeping intact sweeping statutes to be used by Democratic presidents.
But it is a strategic error to vote yes if you agree with the president on substance but object to the underlying statute that delegated this power to the president, because this vote does not change the statute.
The right way to think about the border emergency vote is as a substantive vote, not a process vote.		If you believe there is no emergency on the border or oppose the wall then vote yes on the Democratic resolution.

If Democrats actually cared about net neutrality they would support the bills offered by Republicans to ban blocking and throttling but NOT authorize taxes on your Internet bill.		They don't.
The Obama FCC was set to expand universal service fund contributions (presently a 20% tax on phone bills) to Internet bills right after Hillary won.  She didn't.
Right now, federal, state, and local governments are banned from taxing your Internet bill under the Internet Tax Freedom Act.		But reclassification creates a loophole allowing federal, state, and local fees to be added to your Internet bill.
This has nothing to do with the imaginary parade of horribles that hasn't actually happened in the absence of regulation for the twenty years before the Obama order or in the year since it was repealed.		It has everything to do with taxing your Internet bill.
House Democrats today are introducing legislation to reclassify the Internet as a Title II regulated public utility, the same mangled form of net neutrality Obama briefly imposed.

And go on offense against the Democrats, who want Obamacare to be made mandatory again -- or worse, want to impose single-payer and terminate everyone's private health insurance including employer-sponsored insurance.
And for people who want something else, there are now vastly less expensive options available that can be chosen without penalty.		Republicans need to tout this record while promoting their next steps to bring even more choices and competition to boost quality and lower cost.
They had a great story to tell this last election... a Republican Congress repealed the mandatory nature of Obamacare by ending the mandate penalty.  Obamacare is still there for the people who want it or need it, with all the subsidies and pre-ex guarantee.
GOP needs to stop getting into the fetal position to be beaten on the failure to repeal and replace Obamacare from the right and the accusation they want to end pre-existing condition protections from the left.
Republicans need to stop sitting around dreaming the courts will save them from Obamacare and start making the case to voters that their health care agenda offers higher quality care at lower cost than the what the Democrats want to do.

BTW the post-merger AT&amp;T could become a real advertising competitor to Google and Facebook.  Obama's rules would have prevented that.
But the Dems/media are shameless. They said putting the ISPs back under the same rules as the edge giants would mean your browser history would be for sale.  They even did crowdfunding campaigns to buy browser histories of members of Congress.  Who got that money, anyway?
The Obama rules also imposed totally different and far more stringent privacy rules on ISPs than on Google and Facebook, effectively protecting the tech giants from competition in the advertising space.  That was simply corrupt.
What was true?  The Obama rules had a significant negative impact on investment that has since returned to trend, which is great news for deployment and closing the broadband gap.
The Dems/media told us without Obama's regulations -- which were adopted in 2015 -- the evil phone and cable companies would ruin the Internet.  It was totally false.

@SharylAttkisson Or miss them, when doing so benefits your preferred candidate.
@bartholomewtali Apparently they think they do.
Rick Scott gained 779 net votes in Broward and 146 in Hillsborough in completed recounts.		Both of these Dem counties then ditched their recounts and resubmitted their original counts instead. Blatant.
@BrentScher Only because Broward and Hillsborough got R friendly recounts and then ditched them and used the original counts instead.
@brooklyncowboy1 @LisaDeP It favored Scott by 779 net votes.
@DonnyFerguson It's a shame he was corrupt.
Broward counted 80K votes in secret after the election, refusing to disclose numbers of uncounted ballots or disqualified late ballots.		Scott won court order for transparency and whaddya know they were done.		Vote count dropped in recount with observers.		They used first count.
Count every vote! Especially the erroneous ones in the initial count that were not in the recount.

@grantbosse I get the institutionalist position but it is in tension with constant complaints about Dem obstruction of noms, and other practical policy objectives.		Also, it seems like if the Senate position is no recesses ever somebody should say so.
@grantbosse They could negotiate a list before agreeing to recess.
Democrats will control the House on January 3, so if the Senate doesn't adjourn without pro formas, we're looking at a full presidential term with zero recess appointments.		On the other hand, if they recess, Whitaker legal cloud is lifted and a lot of others get on the job.
Except for two years, Republicans have in fact controlled the House, Senate, and president.  And yet, the Senate has never recessed.		Is McConnell blocking Trump for his own strategic reasons?		Does he lack a simple majority to adjourn without pro forma sessions?
So Obama was blocked from making valid recess appointments for six years by Republicans.		One might reasonably expect no president will ever get recess appointments again except when the same party controls the House, Senate, and president.
When Republicans took the House in 2011, they denied the Senate consent to recess.  This forced Senate pro forma sessions, to block Obama recess appointments.		Senate Democrats had used the tactic, pioneered by Harry Reid, to block Bush recess appointments his last two years. https://t.co/dzqstje3Dh
On January 4, 2012 Obama attempted four puported recess appointments that SCOTUS struck down 9-0 because the Senate was not in recess.		Obama made 28 valid recess appointments in his first two years in office, when there was a Democratic Congress.
It has been nearly eight years since the last Senate recess, when Obama made these recess appointments. https://t.co/7IuwsAGBp2

@arikarikari Of course, not to mention even the WaPo description of those notes was exculpatory: four attackers in her late teens.
New Dem/media strategy is to just lie, memory hole Swetnick, pretend boat rape and car rape were never leaked, and say it's all just Ford.		Except Ford's story changed in every particular and was refuted by her own alleged witnesses - one of whom her "beach friend" begged to lie.
And Ramirez was rushed out by the New Yorker in a self-refuting, embarrassingly half-baked rush because Leland Keyser's statement had just collapsed Ford's accusation.
The whole thing was a smear campaign, which is why it all disappeared as soon as the gavel was down.		And the Dems/media used the plainly false CPL/Swetnick drug-running gang rape impresario smear as the attempted coup de grace, calling for Kavanaugh to withdraw based on it. https://t.co/kfwgvyM1RX

New Jersey voters: we're counting on you to hold this man who lived an international life of luxury on money stolen from Medicare in a fraud scheme he tried to excuse accountable.		This man who actively undermined international security must not chair Senate Foreign Relations.
These are the unanimous findings of the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee when it "severe admonished" Menendez.		But every Senate Democrat supports him for re-election anyway.		Democrats will not police their own and bribery convictions are not going to happen post-McDonnell.
Menendez also tried to block a CBP donation of cargo scanning equipment to the Dominican Republic because Melgen, an eye doctor with no security experience, had bought a port security company and Menendez was trying to force the Dominican Republic to use it to enrich his friend.
That's how he paid for those "gifts to cultivate a friendship" with Menendez.		And what did Menendez do for his friend?  Tried to scuttle the Medicare fraud investigation, escalating all the way to the HHS Secretary to ask her to allow Melgen's rampant overbilling.
Melgen is now an inmate at the Miami Federal Correctional Institution, convicted of 67 counts of fraud.		Melgen looted Medicare for about  a hundred million dollars. And he subjected seniors to totally unnecessary, excruciating procures for some of his scams.
But who paid for those gifts, including private jets, luxury resorts in the Dominican and Paris, and $600K through the Senate Majority PAC, the same Super PAC rescuing Menendez this year?		You did, taxpayer. Palm Beach eye doctor Sal Melgen stole the money from you.
Bob Menendez avoided prison because his defense lawyer hung a jury with the argument -- and this is a real quote -- that "gifts to cultivate a friendship are not bribes."

@Montco_Nast_Tom @seanmdav There was a trend toward defined contribution health benefits via HRAs the Obama IRS essentially banned with IRS Notice 2013-54.		That was reversed for small employers in 21st Century Cures. Now they propose reversing more broadly, with guardrails to prevent adverse selection.
@KingBroly No, but they are the two tested in that poll.
The Trump administration has proposed a rule to allow large employers to offer reimbursement of individually purchased Obamacare policies.		Up to now, this has only been legal for one large employer: Congress.		https://t.co/ouk7Uu24b0

The only legit complaint about Trump/GOP on Obamacare at this point is from the GOP base disappointed that they fixed it and made it optional instead of repealing as promised.
After increasing every year under Obama, in 2019 Obamacare premiums will go DOWN for the first time.		Only 39% of counties and 5 states will have just one insurer, down from 56% and 10 in 2018.		AND short-term plans for 50-80% less.		Worst sabotage ever?		https://t.co/0JKfdWAWd2
