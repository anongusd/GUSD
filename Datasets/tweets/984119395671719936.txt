Rod Blagojevich the former Governor of Illinois when he sold Obama's senate seat and he got this long sentence did he pick up that income on his income tax return federal and state if he committed massive tax evasion it's a problem (big)

@DailyCaller Yeah in the indoctrination about your liberal causes taking away our guns and everything else and all our other Rights
CNN article about why gas prices are so high they make it sound like it's crude oil in Iran and Russia I'm in California you have any idea how much they're raising the taxes on gasoline in California it is the taxes
2nd Amendment people please go not guilty on jury duty if you're in a gun control State you're allowed to do it brelsford versus Georgia 1794 fight tyranny don't explain anything
You have to fight tyranny going not guilty is the best way to do it unfortunately these tweets don't leave enough room I wish they'd leave another 30% more room
It illegal orders you don't have to follow it illegal orders on jury duty putting shoplifters in jail for 25 to life jury nullification is legal brelsford versus Georgia 1794 United States Supreme Court if you're a second amendment person in the gun control state go not guilty
Brailsford versus Georgia US Supreme Court  1794 you don't have to keep your promise on jury duty you're allowed to break it it's a lot like the Nuremberg defense you don't have to follow it legal orders the case is still good and keep your mouth shut don't explain anything
if you're in a gun control State and you're  a second amendment person just go not guilty on jury duty and don't explain anything you don't have to keep your promise  on jury duty you have to do something to stop this tyranny
California once you when you died is Surrender Your assault weapons within 90 days your heirs however they got to pay you for the assault weapons but it hadn't made it to court yet the magazines didn't make it to court they got to reimburse us for them

@MarkDice @covfefeartist @jack yeah but what about your first amendment rights to wear a trump hat judges say that you can be kicked out of a restaurant
@FirstFlag1776 @POTUS Federal judges say people can be removed from a restaurant though for wearing a trump hat no First Amendment rights for political but it's still freedom of speech double standard for the federal judges
@kwilli1046 They got to have a trial
@RichardTBurnett We shouldn't export oil
@judizydeco @ChrisHa89673663 @charliekirk11 Hitlary is a lot worse
@RichardTBurnett my understanding is that Travis Allen has a better chance and Cox but mr. president you may have split the vote which means the Democrats both of them running will be Democrats in the general election
@RichardTBurnett Gala Lawrence thinks you may have split the vote on our Republican governor candidates we kind of have a mono political system here the two top people run even if they're both Democrats for the general election this is a problem
@RichardTBurnett I understand that your for John Cox in California however I've heard he doesn't have a chance so we maybe have you support Travis Allen Gala Lawrence like they head of the Trump team around here so this is what she says that Cox doesn't have a chance
@RichardTBurnett Even if we have a lot of oil we don't want to use all of our own oil for daily use we would rather import some of it to preserve our Reserves
Don't have anything to do with Netflix George Soros from what I understand is the biggest shareholder

@charliekirk11 We can't afford to pay for all these babies and they destroy lives meaning the parents
Continuation political views don't have first amendment rights no freedom of political views but also freedom of speech to wear a trump hat the judges are playing both sides of the fence
Some federal judge block Trump from blocking on his Twitter liberal views he can't do that but up some other federal judge allowed or restaurant to kick somebody out because they're wearing a trump hat everything on the First Amendment political views don't have First Amendment
Should we avoid Starbucks now because it's such a liberal Haven the new policy allows just anybody to sit around complete bums and everything else

@freedom_moates It's a perjury trap and Mueller knows the answers to the questions that he wants to ask in advance or has a pretty good idea
@USAloveGOD And if Rosenstein in the new director of the FBI want to quit let them
@RealMAGASteve Mueller is basically not going to ask a question he didn't know the answer do I have a pretty good idea
@RealMAGASteve Mueller pretty much knows the answers to the questions he wants to ask but maybe not 100 percent

Drug laws in the United States They seize all your property put you in jail for slave labor and try to gas the dealers Germany the Jews They seized all their property put them in jail for slave labor and they gassed them
I want the judges confirmed do the nuclear option the Democrats would use it on us
the big reasons why drugs are illegal is going to tax evasion from dealers don't pay taxes
Obviously Mueller wants to follow the money try to get people for tax evasion if they can't get him for anything else
@TrumpPence45 I love this comment
The drug laws in the United States in the Jewish laws in Germany it's the same law punishments of the same continuation of previous tweet

No Supreme Court Justice shouldn't have term limits because also they would just screw up their votes they do it now
There shouldn't be term limits on Supreme Court Justices they already encourage them to quit because if their age and their time of service adds up to 80 they get a pension equal to their salary
There shouldn't be term limits for Supreme Court justices they can retire at full pay literally they've got enough time and it's their age plus their time of service have to add up to 80 if they knew they were going to lose their job they could just screw up their votes
