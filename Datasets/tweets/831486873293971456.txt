@ABC7TimBarber Why do cops have to come when we call 911 for paramedics? @FairfaxCountyPD officers are NOT trained EMS providers. They cause more harm than good, and this time they probably killed this man. They should face criminal charges and thier boss should to if this is his policy
@jjouvenal @ffxfirerescue @FairfaxCountyPD You should ask how long the police mistreated him before they let the #paramedics in to treat him. I pleaded w/ officer for my husband but they are arrogant &amp; think they know all. The Fire Dept is total opposite. Well trained, treat with respect. @johnfoustva problems in our PD
@jjouvenal This is EXACTLY why we won’t call 911 for my husbands diabetic crisis. He can become combative with low blood sugar and police treat him like a criminal and refuse @ffxfirerescue to come in and help. If you call 911, @FairfaxCountyPD comes too and they a poorly trained.
