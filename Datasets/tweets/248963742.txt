@HuffPostPol READ ALL ARTICLES WORDS SPOKEN BY MIKE PENCE SINCE 2001 MIKE USES THE WORD IN HIS VOCABULARY ‚ÄúLODESTAR‚Äù,. ITS THE VERY WORDS USED IN OP-ED NYT ANONYMOUS LETTER TRUMPS SENIOR OFFICAL IN WH.
People are speculating the word "lodestar" may be proof that Mike Pence wrote the scathing New York Times op-ed against Trump. https://t.co/BsnrF00TRp via @HuffPostPol
@JeridKru @adeibiza @TheCut CON- THE FOSTER CARE N ADOPTING PROGRAMS ARE SO LACKING IN COMMUNITIES...	LACK OF WELL FUNCTING FOSTER OR GROUP HOMES	I KNOW FIRST HAND BECAUSE I HAVE WORKED IN PRIVATE SECTOR N GOV...	SO GOV WONT GIVE WOMAN THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE BUT GOV DOESNT TAKECARE OF THE CHILDREN EITHER......
@JeridKru @adeibiza @TheCut HOW CAN U DEBATE A FRIEND OF MINE WAS VIOLENTLY RAPED BY A MAN AND WAS PREGNANT?  ARE U SAYING ITS OKAY TOO CONCEIVE THE BABY OR GIVE UP ADOPTING OR PUT INTO FOSTER CARE WHERE THERE IS CONTINUE NONE GOV HELP....
@KamalaHarris THIS MEANS ALOT TOO ME IM A GAY WOMAN....	IF LGBTQ RIGHTS ARE TAKEN AWAY.... CONTINUE HATE CRIMES N FURTHER HUMAN RIGHTS WILL CONTINUE...	BECAUSE OFF MAKING GAY MARRIAGE LEGAL SOCIETY IS MORE ACCEPTANCE BUT THERE STILL NEEDS MORE ED IN SOCIETY ABOUT MINORITIES AS EQUALITY...
@KamalaHarris YES PROCEEDINGS WITH NOMEE KAVANAUGHS SHOULD BE DELAYED AFTER 	TRUMPS INVESTIGATIONS.
@KamalaHarris HES NOT GOING TOO RESPOND BECAUSE LATER WHEN TRUMP IS HAVING IMPEAH HEARINGS HOUSE N SENATE IT WILL GO SUP COURT N HE WILL NOT RECUSE HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WILL VOTE NO ON IMPEACHMENT.... I THINK TRUMP WILL RESIGN BEFOR THAT HAPPENS ANYWAY....
