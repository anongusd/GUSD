Most SOTUs are boring hype but this one is uplifting, precisely because we haven‚Äôt heard much about any of these positive things. In that sense it‚Äôs kind of different.

@LostSailorNY So you‚Äôre not apologizing after all. OK, that‚Äôs fine. I mistakenly assume that people reading my tweets understand that I am a defender of Trump and frequently battle with NeverTrumpers. Therefore, I using Twitter shorthand to characterize their position ‚Äî not mine.
@dennis11 @BearingTruth Do you infer from my tweet that I support or oppose Trump? I think you totally misunderstood my tweet.
@LostSailorNY You are so way off base you don‚Äôt deserve a response here. I was characterizing the Never Trump position ‚Äî and condemning it. Not my position.

Some Never Trumpers manage to make everything about Trump &amp; his supporters. They are criticizing Trump supporters who are calling out Northam as hypocrites. So, wise up people ‚Äî your support for Trump means you forfeit the right to pass any moral judgments ‚Äî period.

@RadioFreeTom @ecmprint @baseballcrank I didn‚Äôt imply that. In my experience they preach and practice racial harmony. Yes, it‚Äôs anecdotal, but I‚Äôve visited many churches &amp; read quite a bit in this area. The message is consistent &amp; unequivocal. But I can‚Äôt prove a negative so you‚Äôre right, this is pointless.
@ecmprint @RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank Come on. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt associate with people you guys apparently do. Must be some real racist A-holes in your orbit.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank I really don‚Äôt think he does and I don‚Äôt think we have. Trump supporters I know certainly don‚Äôt believe he thinks that way.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank It might be a meaningless metric except that I run in those circles and I read a lot from pastors and the messages they are preaching in their churches.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank And seriously, who makes race-based distinctions? Who the hell do you talk to that thinks like that? By safety net I we don‚Äôt want welfare to be too great a disincentive to people getting back on their feet or too expansive. Nothing to do with race.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank Conservative evangelicals are Gospel oriented and racism is as foreign to the Gospel as it gets. Call me naive, but no evangelicals I know think or talk like that and pastors in my church and others promote racial harmony and outreach and the rest of it.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank I am a conservative evangelical. Are you? What you‚Äôre talking about is not grounded in reality. ‚ÄúBrown people?‚Äù Who talks like that, except for people projecting their own racism? I live in the Midwest, bordering on the south and we don‚Äôt think that way here.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank This is such a jaded perspective that we have no common ground here. I don‚Äôt know who what racists you know but I don‚Äôt know any conservatives who think like this. Evangelical opposition to an expansive welfare state (as opposed to a safety net) is emphatically not race-based.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank I am well aware you believe that, Tom, but not sure how that pertains to the three issues you raised ‚Äî because regardless of what faults conservative evangelicals have, they aren‚Äôt selective about their pro-life advocacy  as far as I know and it‚Äôs NOT racial.
@RadioFreeTom @baseballcrank OK, I‚Äôll shut up after this, but Tom, this is absurd and insulting on its face. You can‚Äôt really believe what you are saying here. I know you believe the last point, so I‚Äôll get that go, as ridiculous as I think it is as well, but the other two are just outrageously wrong.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom And I am hopeful that under Trump or other Republicans we will eventually make headway on spending, even on entitlements. I know he‚Äôs shown little interest in entitlement reform so far, but I hear he‚Äôs more open to it now. I know Democrats will never do it &amp; it‚Äôs critical.
@baseballcrank @RadioFreeTom Please excuse the intrusion, but it‚Äôs also not just about judges and erosion of the Constitution, though that‚Äôs plenty enough, but taxes, the economy, the military, other social issues, including religious liberty, immigration, law and order, and a billion other things.

Once I wrote a column about the emotional/psychological damage to women who abort and the left attacked me, saying I was a liar, though I cited studies. This is another areas, though, where the left has politicized the science &amp; research. Damage is way worse than some claim.
I like this idea. https://t.co/HxEpsU2jZR
Query: If pro-abortionists are primarily motivated to protect the mother‚Äôs health and freedom why do they deny or downplay the known psychological and emotional damage that often occurs to mothers who abort their child? By suppressing this info they also deny informed choice.

@Ibedodie Completely agree, Trudy.
@BUNKEN1 Good question.
Not intending to be dramatic but in some places we are approaching the kind of culture God ordered the Israelites to wipe out when He allowed them to enter the land He had given them. Rampant baby sacrifice and idolatry. Abject, pervasive, irreversible evil.
Note, with these abortion laws, we‚Äôre not talking about someone committing a heinous act and then begging a court for leniency; we are talking about a deliberative body making a conscious decision to LEGALIZE murder in the first place.
If showing pictures of aborted babies is insensitive and disturbing, how much more disturbing is the reality these photos depict? Why are we always concerned with protecting the non-innocent and lax about protecting the innocent?
I‚Äôm not trying to be outrageous or provocative. I am incredulous that our society has such difficulty calling a spade a spade. So much hesitancy in calling murder, murder. So much fear of offending sensibilities that they‚Äôll mince words about this. Not acceptable IMHO.
The radical pro-abortionists are either death-cultists or are so paranoid about men taking away their freedom (freedom to murder their own babies) that they can‚Äôt cede even one inch of ground. They have to preserve the right to kill even at birth. Astounding evil.

I understand the notion that any party needs to concern itself with appealing to younger voters, but I don‚Äôt get the increasingly popular idea that older generations need to abandon their principles to win younger voters instead of trying to persuade and lead them toward wisdom.

@rickungar It‚Äôs not intended to be a trick. If I didn‚Äôt believe this was the basic position of the party and the liberal establishment I would be far less concerned.
Could we have a show of hands from those who believe the Democrats support open borders and sanctuary cities and facilitating paths to citizenship and welfare for illegals and relaxing asylum laws and enforcement of those laws because they are loving &amp; compassionate.
It‚Äôs easy to be a ‚Äúgood negotiator‚Äù if you‚Äôre like Pelosi and Schumer and don‚Äôt give a damn about border security and the national interest. In other words, they really didn‚Äôt have skin in the game ‚Äî except for their desire to humiliate Trump &amp; that means never compromise.
not ‚Äúwhisperer,‚Äù ‚Äî shouter. https://t.co/NfHhFfONva
10) Finally, let‚Äôs not forget, in words that Yogi might say or might have said for all I know: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over til it‚Äôs over.‚Äù Or, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt count your chickens prematurely.‚Äù
But you are conceding my point. This assumes Democrats are not in good faith and don‚Äôt really want a compromise and will exploit anything they can to avoid border security and a Trump victory. So regardless of whether Trump blew it in negotiating, Dems are culpable on the merits. https://t.co/YsXcDvQm1U
9) I don‚Äôt deny that yet another question is why Trump and the GOP didn‚Äôt pursue the wall way earlier in the last two years. You can blame Trump for that all you want as well, although I think a lot of other factors are at play. Regardless, let‚Äôs focus on today‚Äôs negotiations.
8) So just for once quit viewing everything through a Trump-dominated perspective and evaluate this in terms of what‚Äôs good for the nation and which of the two parties is actually pursuing the nation‚Äôs best interests on this fight. It‚Äôs not even a close call.
7) So, after you‚Äôve had your jollies slamming Trump again, now do Pelosi, Schumer, the liberal media, and the rest of the liberal establishment. They are opposing border security and harming the nation‚Äôs interests (while falsely claiming they support it), for political purposes.
6) So if it makes you feel better to say Pelosi snookered Trump, have at it but accomplishes nothing except to satisfy those who want to find another reason to pile on Trump. This shouldn‚Äôt be a negotiating contest. it‚Äôs not a game. We‚Äôre talking about national security
@debitking I hope I answered your question in my thread. Losing leverage only matters if we‚Äôre treating this as a game. It‚Äôs not.
5) The truth is that regardless of Trump‚Äôs initial statement about taking blame for the shutdown, he‚Äôs the only one who negotiated in good faith throughout this ordeal and kept offering to meet and to compromise &amp; the Democrats only spit in his (and our) face. That‚Äôs what matters
4) So for the sake of argument let‚Äôs say that Trump badly mis-stepped in his statement re taking blame for the shutdown. So what? So call Trump names for it. That doesn‚Äôt change anything about which side is really at fault for the shutdown.
3) The issue shouldn‚Äôt be evaluating who is the better negotiator. This isn‚Äôt a game. It doesn‚Äôt matter that people constantly talk about Trump‚Äôs negotiating prowess or lack thereof. What should drive the evaluation of the shutdown question is the reasonableness of the parties‚Äô
2) I don‚Äôt deny it was an inartful statement but I think people are being intellectually dishonest to pretend that his statement means that he actually should be blamed, regardless of the merits of the parties‚Äô respective positions. Dems own it no matter what Trump said on that.
1) I‚Äôll be accused of shamelessly defending Trump on this but I believe people know Trump by now and know he did not mean literally that he should be blamed for the shutdown no matter what. He meant that he felt so strongly about the border that he was willing to die on that hill
Here‚Äôs a point ‚Äî If Trump had never made his infamous statement about accepting the blame for an eventual shutdown, Democrats, Never Trumpers, and the liberal media would be blaming him just as much for the shutdown, and whitewashing Democrat culpability.
Why do people pay homage to this guy? https://t.co/4ZR5pMXZe8

@shawnblk Shawn ‚Äî I think you‚Äôre a good guy, despite your constant insults, but I also think you‚Äôre blind, including to your own biases. I am not, you should note. I fully admit my biases and try to take them into consideration.
Of course I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why the media had him own the shutdown. They had him own it because they love Democrats and hate him and want to destroy him. That‚Äôs not debatable. Trump‚Äôs statement is a convenient excuse.  That‚Äôs my good faith answer. https://t.co/nFGgb9NsBc
I‚Äôll never understand why Democrats don‚Äôt get the lion‚Äôs share of the blame for these shutdowns. Their position was far more unreasonable than Trump‚Äôs and the entire MMS spin is that Trump is being a tyrant. Are we all just sheep? Democrats don‚Äôt care &amp; so have nothing to lose.
@debitking @cnsnews I think Trump is bending over backward to prove he is willing to negotiate and act in good faith and that Democrats will continue to rebuff him and continue to escape blame, inexplicably. So, after the three weeks passes, who knows but I would imagine it will end up in the courts

Those of you who disagree with my assessment of beloved RINOs are probably RINOs in denial. Indeed, denial may be inherent in the condition. LOL.

The left, bolstered by the media, acts as though they have a license to treat Pres. Trump as disrespectfully as they choose because they can‚Äôt stand him. Having demonized him as the worst human being in history, they think they get a pass for their malicious, adolescent behavior
Democrats and liberals, far more than Republicans, make the case for bipartisanship, and so they ought to be held to at least the standard they demand of Republicans. Under that standard they fail ‚Äî as the most militantly partisan entity in decades.
Honestly, it‚Äôs hard to remember a more persistent case of rank, spiteful partisanship than how Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic Party are treating President Trump both in flagrantly refusing even to negotiate on the shutdown issues and in trying to block his SOTU from the House.

And ‚Äî on top of all this ‚Äî since this fiasco started circumstances have changed, including the new caravan, making border security measures even more urgent and exposing Democrats even further for the charlatans they are.
Trump, ‚ÄúHey Dems, I‚Äôll give you a couple of things I don‚Äôt really agree with in exchange for something you claim you support.‚Äù Pelosi, ‚ÄúNo. We will never compromise with you because you are unwilling to give any concessions.‚Äù
Just a couple of days ago the Dems and media thought they had pushed one of Trump‚Äôs feet into the grave. Last few days haven‚Äôt been real rewarding for them, huh.
It‚Äôs like the Democrats know they can be as blatantly unreasonable as they want to be without being called out on it by the media ‚Äî I wonder where they got that idea.
Assuming, arguendo, that this was originally ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs shutdown,‚Äù which I wholeheartedly reject, Democrats are like the guy who refuses to take an injured automobile passenger to the hospital because someone else caused the wreck.
Democrats even have less credibility ‚Äî if that were possible ‚Äî when you consider that they are the ones who are so adamant about how horrible it is to allow the shutdown to continue. In reality, they don‚Äôt care. All politics all the time.
Memo to self: ‚Äúan‚Äù not ‚Äúa.‚Äù
President Trump has now systematically built a irrefutable case that Democrats have no interest in compromise. None. Zero. Not a hint of it.
Thank you, Democrats, for forfeiting any prospect that people might still find you reasonable and motivated by anything other than to 1) embarrass and defeat President Trump and 2) keep those border floodgates wide open. Your game is open for all to see.

As with so many other examples of projection from Democrats, the condemnation of GOPs for partisanship and their calls for bipartisanship are merely a reflection of their own militant partisanship and disingenuousness about bipartisanship ‚Äî except when it means the GOP caves.
How long before a hyperventilating liberal media starts gasping about Trump‚Äôs Star Wars ‚Äî knowing Reagan‚Äôs SDI was always about defending the US, not for the purposes of aggression against other nations.
I didn‚Äôt come close to coming close to saying that. Don‚Äôt confuse me with your man, Beto. https://t.co/WwwQ9HPusQ
No, the framers wanted liberty, through limited government, pitting the branches against each other so that none would become too powerful. The Constitution itself was a result of compromise but that‚Äôs a different matter. Compromise today almost always advances liberalism. https://t.co/uueZS3Zc9q
@shawnblk Conservatives didn‚Äôt want Boehner to be partisan for the sake of it, but to stand up for conservative principles. Pelosi is not standing up for principles on this border fight, at least not the principles she claims to be ‚Äî border security. She‚Äôs trying to emasculate Trump.
@shawnblk I don‚Äôt celebrate bipartisanship, Shawn. It‚Äôs a myth used to lull Republicans into capitulating. So no hypocrisy from me on this, although the Boehner analogy is kind of weird, IMHO.
Isn‚Äôt it interesting that the liberal media that always promotes ‚Äúbipartisanship‚Äù is glorifying Nancy Pelosi for showing Trump that Congress ‚Äúis my House,‚Äù and giving him ‚Äúa reminder to Mr. Trump that ‚Ä¶ she has the power to frustrate his agenda and upend his plans‚Äù?

Actually it‚Äôs probably an understatement to say the left doesn‚Äôt care about border security. Their position with open borders, sanctuary cities and the like could fairly be described as promoting border insecurity. Am I exaggerating here?
If Democrats hadn‚Äôt been breaking their promises on border security since the Reagan years drastic action wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. But this is the last chance we‚Äôll have for 2 years ‚Äî and maybe forever ‚Äî &amp; it‚Äôs only for a fraction of the wall, anyway . So, yes, it‚Äôs important.
In a sane world, circumstances wouldn‚Äôt have made his unlikely election inevitable. But the left just kept pushing the envelope and the right just kept bending over and asking for more. So here we are. https://t.co/NTasRWDafm
Schumer and Pelosi mouth ‚ÄúTrump shutdown‚Äù as if the average American voter is 5 years old. They know better and are toying with Trump and the people. Just imagine what these cynical players say to themselves behind closed doors.
In a sane world true journalists would be reporting that Democrats are playing games with border security and are not negotiating in good faith. this is darn near objectively true. But with the liberal media spewing the opposite many Americans are duped.
In a sane world there wouldn‚Äôt even be a debate over border security, but since the left doesn‚Äôt care about border security and also wants to humiliate Trump for sport,  any deal is exceedingly difficult ‚Äî in absence of an abject GOP surrender. Not this time.
Democrats cynically refuse to negotiate. They have flat out refused to budge. This cynicism is one way. I reject moral equivalence here. https://t.co/MhrASLxZZe

Also, have you noticed how nasty, mean and hateful so many on the left are, especially in their treatment of Trump, for allegedly being nasty, mean and hateful. This is far worse than your garden variety hypocrisy. It is a colossal lack of collective self-awareness.
If we were revenge-oriented like the left we would be scheming about how we could emulate their abominable behavior as the party out of power if they regain the presidency. We aren‚Äôt &amp; we won‚Äôt, but I mention this to highlight how they exempt themselves from their own standards
Have you noticed that leftists act as though they are being abused because Trump is in power and they can‚Äôt stomach him and they can‚Äôt wait to get back into power and exact revenge. Not only is that a sick mentality; it ignores that they‚Äôre the ones inflicting the abuse NOW.

If we want dispense moral judgments about the current political scene we might start by pointing out that, other things being equal, it is immoral to support or oppose policies or policy makers when such support or opposition will advance America‚Äôs socialism or cultural Marxism.
I might question the judgment, or the discernment of Christians who insist on reflexively and consistently opposing Trump at the expense of advancing the destructive leftist agenda, but I don‚Äôt presume to judge their authenticity as Christians or their moral rectitude.
It blows my mind that some Trump haters actually believe that we Christian Trump supporters ‚Äî and there are tens of millions of us ‚Äî have sold our souls, as opposed to searching our souls and realizing supporting him and his policies (mostly) is consistent with our values.
Many say the Democrats are more interested in defeating Trump politically than in securing the border. That‚Äôs true, but it obscures the fact that they actually don‚Äôt want to secure the border. They have become an open-borders party. Open-borders is incompatible with security.
So supporting Trump instead of the utter demise of the Republic is apostasy? This makes sense in some circles, but I‚Äôve yet to be able to wrap my mind around the logic. So many of you sermonizers are painfully blind to the magnitude of the struggle and what is at stake. https://t.co/UoTVP8zc4D

@LADowd I‚Äôm just kidding I just think it‚Äôs funny that bots always appear as young sexy women announcing they are unmarried. Is there anyone in the history of the world stupid enough to fall for it? I also don‚Äôt even understand what the purpose of these things is.
I have a question that is most relevant for our times: Why are most bots unmarried? LOL. And why are they all so flirty? When I was a kid I never imagined the day that robots would be sexpots. I guess like human beings from the primordial soup, they are just evolving :-).

@CalebHowe Good ‚Äî that‚Äôs what I thought upon reread.
@CalebHowe So maybe if I hadn‚Äôt modified ‚Äúentrench‚Äù with ‚Äúfurther‚Äù in my original tweet, you would agree with it? LOL. Twitter is too much trouble sometimes.
@Conservamator Thank you. And same to you.
@CalebHowe When I opposed Trump adamantly during the primaries, at one point I mistakenly believed the bulk of his supporters were not constitutional conservatives and later came to realize how wrong I was about that. I think some of you guys still make that assumption or similar ones.
@QuinHillyer Totally agree. There has to be something inherent in the criticism that either directly applies to his supporters - which much of it has ‚Äî or that gives rise to a reasonable inference that it was intended as a slam to Trump supporters as well.
@CalebHowe Trump is sui generis. The next successful GOP presidential candidate, by definition, won‚Äôt be another Trump IMHO. This is a fascinating topic, not suitable for Twitter though. Happy New Year to you, your brother and your dad.
@CalebHowe Oh, sorry. I didn‚Äôt remember I‚Äôd used the word ‚Äúentrench‚Äù in my original tweet. Let me try it another way ‚Äî many Trump supporters are constitutional conservatives as they always were. These types will continue to support people like Ted Cruz, for example, in the future.
@QuinHillyer Quin ‚Äî what you say has always been true of you, but I think it does not to many Trump critics on the right. Yes, maybe I‚Äôm a bit too defensive on this, based on my own observations, so I guess it‚Äôs a mixed bag, depending on the Trump crtiic.
@CalebHowe It seems you have the notion that Trump supporters are monolithic and irredeemable politically. Not sure if that‚Äôs what you think. But for any non-Trump Republican pres candidate to succeed in the future he‚Äôll have to appeal to current Trump supporters absent a major realignment
@StanGuthrie You too. BTW, I wasn‚Äôt being flippant. I typed two tweets in response to yours, trying to answer in good faith and then I deleted because I don‚Äôt want to be snarky and I also don‚Äôt want to be misunderstood. But I don‚Äôt agree with your criticism. Happy New Year.
@CalebHowe I admit I can‚Äôt be sure of Romney‚Äôs intent, but one would think he is trying to influence opinion in his opinion piece. He may just be sucking up to liberals, granted, and he may just be preaching to the Never Trump choir. But I assume he also hopes to sway some Trump supporters
I have no way to explain your second incorrect inference. https://t.co/zsLyjdzHm6
I don‚Äôt see outrage. I don‚Äôt want to expend the energy to be outraged. In fact, I don‚Äôt want to expend the energy to thoughtfully answer this tweet, so please never mind. LOL. https://t.co/Ac9Dy4afAc
@RichLowry Perhaps so, Rich, but I don‚Äôt think the major complaint against Romney for this op-ed will center on his inconsistency ‚Äî not that you are implying that.
This IS an obvious, but important point. I‚Äôm sure the stock answer will be that we‚Äôve changed ‚Äî that we sold out; that we know longer care about character and constitutional conservatism. That answer will be wrong on all counts. https://t.co/H6s8QuDgg3

I have long seen the immigration issue as a key part of the Trump/Never Trump schism. Why? Because I‚Äôve seen so many Never Trump statements implying that Trump and his supporters are nativists. That really rubs me the wrong way.
Also, Romney says he‚Äôll call Trump out for ‚Äúdivisive‚Äù tweets. Does he think Democrats are divisive? Did he think Obama was?
During a government shutdown battle over a border wall and border security why would Romney seek to undermine Trump as a nativist? Does he believe Democrats are being more reasonable on this budget impasse than Trump/Republicans?
Concerning Mitt Romney‚Äôs op-ed, a few things jump out at me: 1) Why the need to write a piece on Trump at all? 2) He published in the Washington Post. 3) He says he‚Äôll call Trump out for racist &amp; anti-immigrant tweets, implying, IMHO, border hawks are racist. #Infuriating

@steph93065 Yes, which is the main goal.
In a more reasonable culture ‚Äî not further polluted by a monolithic mainstream media ‚Äî Trump would have already won the PR battle over the shutdown because he‚Äôs made reasonable offers of compromise and Democrats have continued to spit in his face.
Democrats have been stonewalling border security for at least 3 decades so let‚Äôs not be so naive.
Let me ask you ‚Äî in these ‚Äúnegotiations‚Äù which side has demonstrated a willingness to move its position? What does that tell you?
Democrats oppose a wall precisely because they know it does work ‚Äî that‚Äôs the only explanation ‚Äî that, and the fact that they would love to humiliate Trump.
Common sense tells you that Democrats aren‚Äôt being this uncompromising because they all of a sudden have become budget hawks ‚Äî let me try to quit laughing to catch my breath. Their intransigence proves they not only don‚Äôt prioritize a wall ‚Äî they affirmatively oppose it.
@jjauthor Exactly, Janie ‚Äî and Merry Christmas.
Look at it objectively: the Democrats actually WANT the government to remain shut down because they care more about damaging Trump politically (which they believe will happen with a continued impasse) than about alleged damage from a shut down. Consummate cynics.
Democrat leaders insist they want border security but won‚Äôt give a dime for a border security wall, knowing that 1) their base doesn‚Äôt care about border security anyway, and 2) even if they did, they have convinced them with their lies that walls don‚Äôt work.
Notice that it‚Äôs liberals who complain most loudly about government shutdown and yet these same liberals are the reason the government will remain shutdown. Schumer and Pelosi know they risk nothing with their base if they continue to refuse to compromise one little bit.
If liberals like Tom would spend half as much time doing something constructive as they do virtue signaling, the world would be a much nicer place. https://t.co/XVyBNo29q6

‚ÄúPolitics is downstream from culture‚Äù is a nice cliche, but it‚Äôs worse than that. Culture is culture and sometimes subsumes politics. ‚Äî So much of the tyrannical, autocratic, and freedom-suppressing behavior is coming from the private sector, e.g., social media empires.
As impotent as we seem on the political front I‚Äôm even more concerned about the culture &amp; our apparent inability to do much about it &amp; the leftist indoctrination in our schools &amp; universities &amp; our apparently inability to do much about it. Otherwise I‚Äôm pretty sanguine. :-)
By the way, the main reason Schumer opposes the wall so adamantly is because it WILL work, precisely the opposite of what he claims. But you know that.
@debitking Won‚Äôt know until it fully plays out.
No one can ever rationally accuse me of proofreading my tweets. LOLOL.
Illegal immigrants won‚Äôt just vote Democrat because Democrats demonize conservatives, but because the left doesn‚Äôt want them to assimilate and embrace our system ‚Äî as founded ‚Äî a system that conservatives are trying to preserve and liberals aren‚Äôt.
How can any conservative ‚Äî any American, actually ‚Äî look at what‚Äôs happened to California and think that American can last into the future if we don‚Äôt get control of the border? It will be blue from see to shining sea. So blue you won‚Äôt be able to distinguish it from the oceans.
Why should we fund Central America so they won‚Äôt come here in caravans when we‚Äôre saying we don‚Äôt have the money to build the wall to keep them from coming here? Might as well save the money for the welfare they‚Äôll receive when they get here. I‚Äôm only being partly facetious.
Congress can pat itself on the back all it wants for the criminal reform bill, but please don‚Äôt do it on the basis of the illusive ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù of bipartisanship. Who cares about bipartisanship, which is only a rhetorical tool to help Democrats.

@EEEHSE Ok. Thx
Not only does the mainstream of the Democratic Party effectively oppose border security; they demonize border enforcement advocates as racists. We see it constantly.
@EEEHSE @marthamaccallum @ChrisCoons No, this was not a criticism of Martha. I am just taking issue with the notion that Democrats want to secure the border. It‚Äôs not personal.
I like and respect Martha a lot, but I was just surprised to hear her say that both parties support border security. Not that Republicans have excelled on this issue either, admittedly. But with Dem support it would be a done deal.
Hello ‚Äî @marthamaccallum ‚Äî Did I hear you say to @chriscoons that both parties want border security? I may sound cynical, but I REALLY don‚Äôt believe Democrats want border security. They‚Äôve perpetually broken their promises to support border security. They are now open borders

Which policy ideas of Donald Trump are extreme ‚Äî especially compared to those of mainstream Democrats? What are people so afraid of with Trump re policy?
Do Democrats believe the Social Media mega-giants should selectively sensor conservative speech as ‚Äúhate speech?‚Äù Do they believe any political speech they disagree with is ‚Äúhate speech?‚Äù
Do Democrats think it‚Äôs outrageous that Princeton group won‚Äôt sing Disney after being accused of ‚Äútoxic masculinity?‚Äù Which of these perverse ideas do Democrats reject, I ask?
Does the Democratic Party believe people like Kevin Hart should be permanently shunned for making hurtful jokes in his past? Is even his apology enough, or does he have to go out and make speeches spanking himself?
Does the Democratic Party believe whites are intrinsically racist because of their privileged position and believe that racism should be redefined, not on the basis of our behavior toward minorities, but on the color of our skin?
Do Democrats agree with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand‚Äôs statement that our future is female and intersectional?
How many Democrats believe that all women must be believed if they make an allegation of sexual assault and that the accused‚Äôs due process rights be effectively suspended?
Does the Democratic Party sympathize with or oppose the outrageous expulsion of Chik fil A from college campi because its founder believes in traditional marriage?
How many Democrats disagree that there is moral equivalence between the Israelis and Palestinians?
How many Democrats oppose forcing Christians bakeries to bake a cake for a same-sex marriage celebration?
@stupiferodious Thank you.

Which of these believe the Constitution ought to be interpreted as written? As intended by the Framers? Which of these oppose the radical leftist indoctrination in our universities? Which would not gut the Second Amendment? Which would EVER support entitlement reform? https://t.co/UIxBnUeJyA

To me it is hardly unAmerican to want (and try) to save the country from those who would eradicate its founding principles ‚Äî the very things that have made it the freest and most prosperous nation in history.

@BoSnerdley James, you are a great guy,. Thank you so much. But I‚Äôm 66, not 65 ‚Äî LOLOL. He‚Äôs slipping in Math :-)
That‚Äôs my point. You consider yourself morally superior to the overwhelming majority of GOP votes who voted for Trump. These people are the same they‚Äôve always been. They believe in America as founded and realize it‚Äôs under severe assault and want to save and revive it. https://t.co/amdjJ6Yqr4
@SteveMcCannAT Or that non-voting isn‚Äôt enabling the same way.
How about abortion on demand, unlimited borders, full blown socialism, insane extreme surrender of our sovereignty on environmental issues if they had a chance, judicial activism, stacking the court, suppression of speech, assault on Christian liberty. Oh, no, but Trump‚Äôs gross. https://t.co/z8lACjZFKT
This is the point of most Never Trumpers. You casually condemn the whole category of Republicans and Trump supporters. According to you they don‚Äôt have principles anymore. Such hubris. You have no idea how we think ‚Äî it‚Äôs obvious. https://t.co/xAcwg7SQyi
There were not better choices in the general election. So what are you talking about? https://t.co/xAcwg7SQyi
Short term gains? Do you not realize how extreme the left is &amp; how close they‚Äôve come to destroying the country?

@ecmprint @sdevil84 I don‚Äôt need to categorize it as ‚Äútransactional.‚Äù It was mandatory. The left is destroying the country. Trump is trying to stop them. This is an existential struggle. I have to be on the right side of that. There are also a lot of positive things about Trump and his approach.
@ecmprint @sdevil84 According to your position nearly 100‚Äô% of Republicans sold out their principles. That‚Äôs just absurd on its face. It ought to tell you how unreasonable your position is.
@ecmprint @sdevil84 You apparently think you can shame us for doing what we believe is right for the nation. You don‚Äôt get it. We don‚Äôt feel the slightest bit of shame. We do what we believe is right. Your purist position is borderline irrational.
@ecmprint @sdevil84 The main problem with the Never Trump position is that condemn us for voting for and supporting Trump yet your position is much less defensible. You are enabling the advancement of an outrageously godless agenda. Even John MacArthur said there was no choice but to vote for Trump.

@EarlEaton I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs right, but I wish they‚Äôd at least push these things to a vote.
@EdLatimore good job in distinguishing those two words.
One thing I‚Äôll never understand is why the GOP didn‚Äôt at least try to make the tax cuts permanent and pass border wall legislation here while they still have their majority. Maybe too many squishes, I don‚Äôt know, but why no real effort?

In fact I think one of the greatest antidotes to the spread of leftism is for young people to observe the violent contradiction between the left‚Äôs professed beliefs and attitudes and their actual behavior toward others. They are their own worst witness.
The left‚Äôs primary recruitment tool has always been their professed kindness &amp; compassion. It supposedly underlies their agenda on taxes, healthcare, race &amp; gender, welfare, even abortion, which is laughable. So why are so many of them just nasty, vicious, intolerant &amp; hateful?

@MrBully67 Michael, I enjoyed your patient exchange and learned replies to Keith. Just wanted you to know that I noticed and appreciated it, even though the thrust of our respective exchanges were with Keith. Take care.
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic Finally  ‚Äî for now ‚Äî I would ask that you consider looking at the grand story of the Bible and quit quagmiring yourself so much in the trees. Try the forest every once in a while. I see God‚Äôs hand every on every page ‚Äî every time I read the Bible. Mind-blowing for me. Living Word
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic So in the meantime, God bless you, and consider turning that fertile, sharp mind toward the God of the Bible and ask him to come into your heart. :-)
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic My goal is not to win debates ‚Äî that‚Äôs not going to happen anyway, especially not with you. I get no joy out of rhetorical conquest, except sometimes with nasty leftists, but even then, not so much. I would get immense joy if you would get over your grudge and accept Christ :-)
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic Some fellow Christians constantly criticize me for engaging with nonbelievers/atheists, saying I mustn‚Äôt throw pearls at swine. I don‚Äôt look at it that way. I believe I have a duty to be winsome in my communication of the Gospel and I also am motivated to be. (more)
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic This is also no effort on my part to cut off communications with you, Keith, but these discussions have become counterproductive. I‚Äôve got way too much to do to do this recreationally, other than every once in a while. I wish you the best.
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic I truly pray for you, Keith, that you could come to see the Bible as the Word of God but at this point you seem to get too much amusement out of demonstrating the problem areas. That‚Äôs your prerogative, but it‚Äôs off-putting to me, which is not to say, faith-shaking.
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic Being a believer doesn‚Äôt mean all difficult passages just magically disappear but I do view them differently than I used to. I also think that if you read the Bible with an open mind &amp; seeking heart you‚Äôll experience its majesty and divine nature, it‚Äôs mind-blowing unity, etc.
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic As I‚Äôve told you, Keith, I am not smug or indifferent to difficult biblical passages but I believe Christianity‚Äôs truth claims are demonstrated by powerful evidence and came to that conclusion starting with a skeptical, but hopeful mind and heart.
@keithknutter @lisaradio99 @adhalejr @MrBully67 @SweetMewsic Hey guys. Please take me off this thread, not that it isn‚Äôt fun, but it‚Äôs too time consuming and distracting.

@keithknutter I think you did make the point about foreknowledge too, which is a much tougher case to make. Put aside words for a second, I don‚Äôt believe even Calvinists believe Adam didn‚Äôt have a choice, though realistically man would inevitably sin with that choice. That‚Äôs why Christ came!
@keithknutter You made the statement, did you not, that foreknowledge is inconsistent with free will? That is not true. If you are saying that the Bible message goes beyond foreknowledge to full-blown predestination, that‚Äôs another matter and we‚Äôre both well aware of both sides of that debate.
I didn‚Äôt consider it patronizing at all, just wanted to let you know what I have written about the very point you make. Here is a screenshot of a page from Jesus on Trial in which I make the point. https://t.co/0FU5aOusXU https://t.co/LISvOYxHsP
@str8tawk I make this very point in several of my books, so yes, I have strongly considered it.
Keith, it‚Äôs hard to believe you are really pressing this point. I doubt that even hyper-Calvinists believe Adam didn‚Äôt have a choice. Of course he wouldn‚Äôt be responsible if he didn‚Äôt. And contrary to your argument, there is nothing inconsistent between foreknowledge &amp; free will. https://t.co/QnCtJmh0Hb

@beboldman Thank you so much, but you haven‚Äôt seen my bad side :-).
@keithknutter @DougGroothuis As much as I love debate, especially in politics, I prefer discussions on theology and apologetics because it orients us toward learning from one another rather than one-upmanship, which only serves our pride and doesn‚Äôt advance the cause of the Gospel, IMHO.
I don‚Äôt know if this is a semantic issue, because I don‚Äôt know how loosely you‚Äôre defining theocracy, but I think it‚Äôs absurd to say most Christians, or even a significant %, advocate theocracy. For one thing, Christian conservatives subscribe to 1st Amend., which prohibits it. https://t.co/EWIXW9Yy49
@ErikGaston6 @MrBully67 @keithknutter I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the primary message of rendering unto Caesar. Laws establish order in society, among other things, &amp; should, in my view, be based on moral principles. Advocacy of laws consistent with Biblical principles and voting for people supporting them is not theocracy
@ErikGaston6 @keithknutter @MrBully67 Of course not, but I would argue that almost all laws are based on someone‚Äôs idea of morality, from traffic laws to capital murder.
Hey @keithknutter ‚Äî if you are not familiar with him, you should check out @DougGroothuis ‚Äî another brilliant apologist.
@ErikGaston6 @keithknutter @MrBully67 And yet, laws can and do affect moral behavior, e.g., Roe vs. Wade ‚Ä¶ I think some people use liberalizations of the law to rationalize their behavior. ‚Äî Another example, though I have no empirical evidence on this one: legalizing weed.

Yes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs always easy to understand. Even Peter said some of Paul‚Äôs writings are difficult to understand. Part of the beauty of it is that we grow when we make the effort to study through difficult passages IMHO. https://t.co/yWRNvyPd6z

@keithknutter OK, we‚Äôre getting closer to an agreement. :-). I don‚Äôt think a third party is NEEDED, but I do think believers benefit immensely from learned and inspired teachers, pastors, etc. Our Christian duty is to help each other along as part of our community.

@Hecate40 Please DM mailing address.
@keithknutter No reason to continue beating this beleaguered horse, but I don‚Äôt subscribe to circular reasoning either. I will say, however, that internal evidence in the Bible, is also faith-enhancing. But we must look elsewhere for validation of the reliability of Scripture, and it exists.
@soledadobrien Do you disagree with this, Soledad?
@Hecate40 Self-deceived IS delusional. He is the Son of God AND God incarnate. Will be glad to send you my book, Jesus on Trial, if you want.
@msinex I suppose that‚Äôs true if you are 5-point Calvinist, which I don‚Äôt happen to be. But I strongly respect those who are. In any event I believe we are called to evangelize with whatever gifts or tools we have, including reciting our experience, if helpful, and most of all, the Bible
Another unintended sliver lining of the Trump presidency ‚Äî the left now loves all former past Republican presidents.
@Hecate40 Because He claimed to be God, which means He was God or He wasn‚Äôt. If He wasn‚Äôt, He was either self-deceived or trying to deceive others, but He cannot be a moral person if He emphatically claimed to be God and wasn‚Äôt.

Why is it morally repugnant? It‚Äôs an opinion grounded in reason. If people are untethered to absolute moral principles then what restrains them?

I think Deism was always a theological copout. It allowed people who couldn‚Äôt reconcile the Christian God‚Äôs allowing evil and suffering &amp; so opted for a religion that supposedly wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with that. But it‚Äôs a fraud because a God who creates, then abandons is horrible

You seem like a nice guy and not unduly contentious so I don‚Äôt want to sound harsh in my responses, but You keep attributing positions to me that I don‚Äôt hold.

Horrifying. https://t.co/2H95Jozp4y
@keithknutter @Brian_Bokenyi @jimbearNJ It‚Äôs not a philosophy; It‚Äôs a Person. Jesus said He is the way, the truth, and the life, and there is no way to the Father except through Him. ‚Äî If any person rejects that I don‚Äôt see how you can call that person a Christian. But we don‚Äôt have to agree on everything.
@keithknutter I understand but I don‚Äôt think you should allow errors on the part of fallible Christians (and we‚Äôre all fallible, like all other people), to sabotage your faith journey, such as it is.
@StephenLimbaugh I do remember he was not a fan of either book, but lest we offend our brother Lutherans I‚Äôm not touching this one. When are coming home?
Even if you believe Jefferson was a unitarian or Deist or something else, he still, by his own telling, drafted the Declaration as an expression of the American mind, and the Declaration recognized a providential, superintending God, which is not the God of the Deists, to be sure
@Brian_Bokenyi @keithknutter @jimbearNJ There you go.
@hammondpolitics Well, that is kind of what he meant.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible but if it is I would assume it will be a simulation and not actual consciousness, but in any case it would not shake my faith because it would have been developed by creatures made in God‚Äôs image with a glimmer of his intelligence &amp; creativity. https://t.co/cyoBUuQYkO

I think it‚Äôs lamentable that some people hate the God they purport not to believe in &amp; have such misguided notions about the God of the Bible and so really don‚Äôt quite grasp what/Who they are rejecting. They may say it‚Äôs the pious Christian they abhor, but I think it‚Äôs deeper.
BTW, I don‚Äôt believe people come to faith through reason, though it can remove doubts that are an obstacle or mask other obstacles. And I don‚Äôt believe people can be argued into the kingdom, excuse the cliche. It‚Äôs a matter of the heart and the will and, in some cases, rebellion https://t.co/XouH3vaKKr

@DavidBahnsen David -- To be clear, I'm not dismissing the theory, but I'm not its proponents aren't oversimplifying. But I also don't see how California is analogous. That trend has long preceded Trump and the so-called alienation of the suburbs.

We don‚Äôt abandon moral standards just because we‚Äôre all sinners. That‚Äôs indescribably evil.
@pammy3006 Yes, everything is within a micro-second‚Äôs touch.
And understand this: I‚Äôm hardly the kind of Christian scold that used to turn me off to the faith. I am not saying I‚Äôm any less of a sinner than anyone else. What I‚Äôm saying is we dare not close our eyes to the fact of sin and allow our standards to be blurred. Very dangerous.
@Hope4Caregiver Thank you, Sir.
@debitking Yes, but boy do parents face stiff competition from every other influencer in the culture.
@Hope4Caregiver OK. Good for you. Keep it up. Props to you.
And apart from these issues, do liberals ever leave politics out of anything? I was enjoying Designated Survivor for a while until they just made conservatives look like evil ogres one too many times. I could handle it 100 times in a row, but not 101.

It‚Äôs not that I care what other people do in the sense the libertine might think; it‚Äôs that I am troubled that we are desensitized to right and wrong, moral and immoral ‚Äî to sinfulness. It‚Äôs disturbing that we‚Äôre pressured not to even believe things are sinful that we know are.
@Hope4Caregiver Yes, we certainly have to try.
When we reduce these kinds of questions to the euphemistic formulation: ‚ÄúWho cares what others do in our bedrooms?‚Äù ‚Äî we show how insidious sinfulness creeps in. It darkens people‚Äôs hearts. Hell yes, I worry about society under these conditions.
@OldSaltCityAce @PatriotforeverU You‚Äôll have to read my previous tweets. Easy to do ‚Äî I‚Äôm talking about the show SWAT and how they‚Äôre pushing a polyamorous relationship on it.
@pammy3006 I know, thus the lament.
My concern is not what people do in their bedrooms, but that they are proselytizing and trying to normalize perversion. If you don‚Äôt see the danger to society in that, then we‚Äôll have to agree to disagree. https://t.co/S55Q8Ekq1F

You‚Äôd think the feminists alone would crucify the ‚Äúlucky‚Äù guy who gets two hot chicks ‚Äî one he‚Äôs married to and the other he‚Äôs has a consensual relationship with. But liberal amorality is nothing if not inconsistent.
I‚Äôm glad to have you on board the conservative voting coalition but I think you‚Äôre quite wrong if you don‚Äôt see how this kind of post-modern. moral relativism-insanity is not ultimately going to be the destruction of our society. https://t.co/Jb7yIYnIwV
I‚Äôm serious, people are afraid even to call these people out on such depravity ‚Äî for fear of ridicule or worse by the thought police.
And this polyamorous relationship is shoe-horned into the show. It has nothing to do with anything. In fact, it‚Äôs a distraction, which is why I say they‚Äôre cramming their views down our throats.
Don‚Äôt the New Atheists or whatever they call themselves say they don‚Äôt need the Bible or any other source from which to derive their moral standards? Yeah, then on what basis do you say such polyamorous relationships are wrong?
2) What is just as disturbing as what I described in my previous tweet is that I actually wondered, before tweeting, whether many people will even agree with me anymore? How many people believe these kinds of things are wrong anymore. Do they have any moral anchor at all? Bible?
1) It‚Äôs hard to believe how hard Hollywood is pushing cultural licentiousness, or whatever word describes polyamorous relationships. On a cop show, no less, an engaged couple has invited a female to join in their relationship. What kind of world are my kids going to experience?

One could argue that preventing the White House from banning a perpetually hostile, combative, and disruptive snark-agent like Jim Acosta could abridge the WH‚Äôs freedom of speech because Acosta won‚Äôt ever shut up. I wouldn‚Äôt argue it but it‚Äôs no less absurd than Acosta‚Äôs claim.

These liberals, American and otherwise, comparing Trump‚Äôs nationalism to Hitlers are just ridiculous. Nationalism, especially in the sense Trump uses it, doesn‚Äôt cause wars. Imperialism ‚Äî the quest for world domination (hardly something Trump can be accused of) does.

2) Florida Democrats are cheating in broad daylight again and already accusing Republicans of falsely calling them out on it. If they are finally shut down they‚Äôll once again claim the good guys stole the election. They are unscrupulous.
1) Don‚Äôt EVER forget the overt cheating FLA Democrats engaged in 2000 and that when the Supreme Court finally shut them down, Democrats began the narrative that the conservative Supreme Court stole the election. No, the Court returned the stolen goods.

What kind of people go to celebrities‚Äô homes and threaten them? This is the opposite of a small matter. This is a dangerous and growing mindset on the left.
Can you conservatives imagine any Republicans thinking Trump is worse for America than Democrats? How can anyone make such a calculation? And yet many Never Trumpers have. Look at FLA. Look at their cheating out in plain sight. And this is without even considering their policies.
I also love that President Trump slammed Obama for what he did to our military. That‚Äôs something that needs to be said and so few say it.
Open borders policy will result in the Californiazation of Arizona, Texas, on and on. When will this madness stop?

Am I crazy to believe that the left patronizes minorities when they act like they‚Äôre so hypersensitive and weak that they‚Äôll be emotionally devastated if you don‚Äôt treat them like emotional invalids? Give them some credit. Quit imposing your soft bigotry, phony do-gooders.
The Trump phenomenon is in part a long-overdue response to the totalitarianism of the Left. People on the right who are complacent about this should understand that most of us aren‚Äôt. To achieve bipartisanship with totalitarian libs is only possible if you wholly capitulate.
People should keep this in mind when they vote. The Left is simply totalitarian in their mindset. They do not tolerate dissent from their dogma. I can‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt view that as the horror it is.
You can‚Äôt even have a different opinion from the Left. If they say it is racist or forbidden cultural appropriation for you to dress as one of another race or using their customary dress, then that‚Äôs the equivalent of a divine decree and you will be destroyed if you disobey. 1984

@maggieNYT It seems a logical inference from your statement that he is using it to stoke his base. Are you not implying he doesn‚Äôt care about the issue as much as he wants to capitalize on it politically? I believe he‚Äôs sincerely frustrated that he‚Äôs been thwarted &amp; we have these crises.

@BibChr Well, you got me there :-)
Is it true that MAGABomber is the 2nd most trending hashtag right now? Has a Trump supporter confessed? Do they have one on video committing the act?
Don‚Äôt you see: what we have here is Trump issuing a statement condemning violence and Democratic leaders lambaste him for not condemning violence. I wonder if they‚Äôd praise him if he converted to their party.
This beats anything I‚Äôve ever seen. So how about their condemnation of their own? Are you kidding me? There is no satisfying these people because they ALWAYS want an issue ‚Äî they DO NOT want to be satisfied.

@DavidAFrench David, I don‚Äôt doubt your good faith and am sorry for anything you and your family have experienced. I don‚Äôt see the nexus you apparently do between genuine racists and Trump. I live among strong, Trump supporting Americans. I don‚Äôt know a racist among them. So I reject the taint
Trump is not trying to alienate minorities. In fact, he‚Äôs trying to attract them. Some virtue-signaling liberals actually think conservatives need subliminal appeals to racism to be energized to vote? How sick are your minds? Speak for yourselves because you don‚Äôt speak for us.
My honest take: Trump believes in a strong, exceptional America. He‚Äôs not a political scientist. He doesn‚Äôt speak in code. When he says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nationalist,‚Äù he‚Äôs not winking at Neo-Nazis. He‚Äôs saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a patriot &amp; you PC people can‚Äôt make me quit using the word ‚Äúnationalist.‚Äù

There‚Äôs another thing that should frost Trump supporters. When people accuse Trump of talking in some racist code speech, they‚Äôre actually, by extension, and in some cases even more directly, accusing his supporters of racism as well. And that is really offensive.
Also, I‚Äôm might proud of my main man @SenTedCruz @tedcruz who is running a great race against a well-funded nationally supported leftist. And he‚Äôs ahead handily because of the great leadership he‚Äôs demonstrated in the Senate in advancing a substantively conservative agenda

Methinks some people are scared blank-less than Trump is making inroads into minority voters. Oh my gosh could that be electorally revolutionary. Oh yes, the stakes are high so let‚Äôs just slander to our hearts content. We don‚Äôt care that these lies also hurt race relations.
If Trump is so evil why do his rabid opponents have to fabricate tales suggesting he is a racist? It is a despicable tactic that is recklessly deployed with abandon. And it hurts more than just Trump. It is societally destructive.

The science-denying Democrats are outraged that Trump insists on restoring biology to gender definitions. Imagine the state of the soul of a party whose center of gravity is on 73 different genders. No, liberals and conservatives don‚Äôt share the same goals ‚Äî not even close.
Democrats love to frame every political issue (with the notable exception of abortion) as being about the children but you don‚Äôt have 5000 children driving this invading caravan. The question should be asked: do Democrats care a whit about American sovereignty? Any at all?
The Dems overplayed their hand with Kavanaugh but their zeal makes them either oblivious to their excesses or incapable of restraint. The same thing could play out with the caravan, which can‚Äôt be just serendipitously timed. It will also be a pivotal issue in the midterms.
@BibChr Yes, aimlessness in substance and messaging.

Ah, the left, so loving and compassionate and tolerant and pro-gay. Oh wait, they‚Äôre not pro-anything or anybody if that anything or anybody doesn‚Äôt march in lockstep with the twisted ideology. You people don‚Äôt even bother to pretend to be consistent or principled. https://t.co/AGHoCaE3Gq

@DailyTrump2 I agree with your greater specificity but the effect is often tensions both ways. But they also demonize minorities that deviate from the liberal orthodoxy.
They are scared to death because if more blacks stray from the liberal orthodoxy and Democrats lose just a small percentage of blacks they will be in heap big trouble. So they continue to agitate and pit the races against each other. It‚Äôs despicable, actually. https://t.co/C9f9HuFm3z

For an insider Republican to join leftists and go on their shows to participate in a mutual dishonest slobber fest against ‚Äúevil‚Äù Republicans is like a renegade pastor‚Äôs son abandoning the faith and racing to a public microphone to tell dirty secrets on his mom &amp; dad.
Is this an intended slam? If he was crying it would show the utter reverence he has for the Constitution, the law, &amp; the Court itself. Such respect should comfort you that he will honor the law, not politics. But honoring the law and the Constitution is not in the left‚Äôs interest https://t.co/M6WPuIGaQw

To falsely accuse people, let alone entire swaths of them, as racists, is a sin that rivals racism itself. It is not an insignificant matter and mustn‚Äôt be taken lightly. If it weren‚Äôt for the success of this Democrat slander, Democrats would already be in dire electoral trouble.
The Republicans I know ‚Äî and I‚Äôve been steeped in Republican politics for six decades ‚Äî are not racists and the rest of these epithets some people are saying &amp; Democrats are scared to death their story line is finally falling flat and that they will lose their lock on minorities.
It‚Äôs different when card-carrying Democrats slander Republicans. That‚Äôs what they do and they have no credibility beyond their ranks. But when someone who was once a GOP insider tars us as racists he legitimizes the lies and slanders of the left and it‚Äôs outrageous.
It‚Äôs not my intention to start a debate with any Never Trumper, including Max Boot, &amp; I would probably ignore their stuff except that it really bothers me when they pile on with leftists in slandering Republicans as racists etc. I strongly reject &amp; resent it. https://t.co/oP7Hpnl0bt

@QuinHillyer I have no doubt about you. But some of these guys are full-on advocating for the Democrats in November. No matter what they think of Trump, they can‚Äôt possibly see the left as I do and have that position, IMHO.
@QuinHillyer That‚Äôs what I mean, yes.
I find it amazing that anyone who claims they used to be conservative could be moved away, rather than toward the Republican Party after witnessing the despicably lawless behavior of the left during and post-Kavanaugh. If you are less GOP post Kavanaugh you are not conservative
These types are saying that Kavanaugh should have just rolled over &amp; not only doomed his own nomination but encouraged the left to attack all perfectly qualified nominees in the future? Sorry, we‚Äôre not that self-loathing and we don‚Äôt care that little about the future of America.
@rorycooper That used to be the normal daily training distance for a marathon as I recall, no?
This kind of Never Trumper parrots leftists who say Trump is imposing authoritarianism, the current GOP is racist and nativist, we have all sold our principles, etc. Are they so desperate to find a home that they have convinced themselves of a grossly false narrative?
The point is that this type of malcontent Never Trumper can no longer be taken seriously as a conservative because he is openly opposed to the advancement of conservative ideas ‚Äî and he grossly distorts what the Trump era represents.
The type of Never Trumper I‚Äôm talking about has now adopted the leftist mindset, such as believing Kavanaugh proved himself unfit in his indignant testimony concerning Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations. Well, if he hadn‚Äôt reacted indignantly many of us would have wondered why.
@KyleRee86849765 Yes.
Some Never Trumpers have now, thankfully, come to see the left for the extreme menace it is, but others are becoming even more entrenched, post-Kavanaugh. (Correction, there is no post-Kavanaugh because the left won‚Äôt let it go). Some NTers are getting angrier &amp; more alienated.

That the American Bar Association is turning on Judge Kavanaugh is no surprise ‚Äî this group is flagrantly liberal. And liberals politicize everything. It‚Äôs who they are; it‚Äôs what they do. The ABA, above all, should love his constitutionalism, but they don‚Äôt, which speaks volumes
It bothers me greatly that people are impugning Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs character because he fought back aggressively &amp; emotionally in his congressional testimony. His 12 years on the DC Circuit Court alone are direct &amp; superior evidence of his exemplary judicial temperament.

@LarrySchweikart I know but Flake holds a big card.
@artnthesoul No Flake can still vote no in the vote of the entire Senate
There would be less blowback to Republicans if they had just voted this morning than there will be by allowing this further investigation and then the full Senate voting to confirm. Delays embolden Dems and make them more rabid and also infuriate grassroots Republicans.
Don‚Äôt miss this: The Dems don‚Äôt want further investigation &amp; due diligence. They‚Äôve all pre-announced their unwavering commitment to vote against him. So this is not about due diligence but another delay designed to defeat Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation.
They act like the FBI has some infallible and immediate line to truth ‚Äî one week? Right.
Once again, Sen. Flake makes himself a hero of the left in the name of some high honor.

I realize they might be limiting each questioner‚Äôs time to 5 minutes so they can go back and forth every 5 minutes from GOP to Dem, but if so, that‚Äôs ridiculous too. Doesn‚Äôt enhance fact-finding to split questioning in such short segments.
I have 1 evergreen complaint about congressional hearings ‚Äî too many politicians have to get their face time so they divide time &amp; fracture the questioning instead of having future questioners. In this case GOP senators aren‚Äôt using their own time so I wish they‚Äôd consolidate 1/2
@Crestal I‚Äôll mention it. I think she is too, but still quite unsure.
No matter what else emerges, the Democratic machine choreographed this whole series of events, from handling the polygraph to blocking Grassley from interviewing Dr. Ford and who knows what else. I doubt Ford‚Äôs welfare was their driving concern.
RT @MZHemingway: Despite the public nature of Senate GOP's offer to fly to California to meet with her, Blasey Ford claims she was unaware‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs completely dishonest Sen. Feinstein. This has been anything BUT a rush to judgment. GOPs have been over backward to accommodate your manipulative, bad-faith delays. Judge Kavanaugh has been ready to testify from the beginning of the allegations. Please be fair.
@AlanJSanders Agree.
I know we are supposed to withhold judgment but let me confess as Sen. Feinstein begins ‚Äî I am not real objective where she‚Äôs concerned.
Sen. Grassley‚Äôs opening is good ‚Äî but he could use a little better eye contact :-)
@StreamUrchin Thank you.
@Stevenwadcock @wsheeder I think the first accuser probably believes her story, but I don‚Äôt believe if it happened that Kavanaugh is the perp.

Kavanaugh‚Äôs fate is hardly the only thing at stake here. This is about way more than him.
Also I‚Äôm sick of this mantra that Kavanaugh is applying for a job promotion as if this is about rewarding Kavanaugh. The issue is much larger. It is about what is best for the nation and who will best serve its interests as a member of the highest judicial body in the land.
The attitude of some Democrats and their enablers that the accused male is guilty (not just presumed guilty) based on his and his accuser‚Äôs gender, which would be outrageous enough, is significantly worse than Orwell‚Äôs, ‚ÄúSome are more equal than others.‚Äù
The idea that these Democrats could, with straight face, suggest that the accused should testify before the accuser is so outrageously unfair that one must assume they are acting unreasonably and in bad faith.
Give the left a chance and they‚Äôll rarely stop short of extremism ‚Äî if ever. They are revealing themselves more with each passing day and they are arrogantly confident that it will not cost them politically. They are relying on the militancy of their base. So we fight.
The Democrats‚Äô main case against Kavanaugh being confirmed is that he would uphold the Constitution and rule of law even if that means voting to overturn Roe ‚Äî though it‚Äôs hardly clear it would come to that because of his reverence for precedent as part of the process.
@rickungar LOL
Yes, I accidentally said ‚Äútheir‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthere‚Äù ‚Äî but it‚Äôs too late to delete.
It is nothing less than chilling to hear prominent Democrats and liberals say that an accuser should be believed based on gender. Their willingness to condemn without any evidentiary hearing is astronomically revealing of their bad faith.
Their is a fundamental difference between the political left and political right in terms of respect for our Constitution, our rule of law, and a commitment to fairness and basic rights to all irrespective of their political views.
I‚Äôve often wondered if certain leftists would put us in concentration camps if they had carte blanche power. Their presumption of  Kavanaugh‚Äôs guilt  based on uncorroborated allegations in furtherance of their political ends validates my speculation.

It is quite rich for this Dem senator‚Äî Hirono‚Äî to lecture Judge Kavanaugh for HIS alleged partisan activism when that‚Äôs her (and other Dems‚Äô) litmus test for confirmation, provided it‚Äôs liberal activism.
Sen. Durban says he‚Äôs often asked whether we are going to be alright. Well, we won‚Äôt be if he and his radical Democratic Party has it‚Äôs way. So we must continue fighting to defeat them.

Yes, I think some people are suggesting that support for Trump is tribally or racially based or has some nativism, or alt-right component. I reject that. There may be some small percentage element of that, but Trump‚Äôs support is mostly grassroots conservative. https://t.co/9uiJ0zPVxR
@carmenlaberge I am well aware.
But the implication from many who decry tribalism is that there is some kind of cultish unity on the right around Trump. I don‚Äôt think so at all. I think he just is the person leading this movement. Perhaps he is the only one who could have done it this way, but still no cult.
Nor am I suggesting that uniting to oppose the left‚Äôs war against the American idea, etc. requires abandoning other principles or values. I‚Äùm just saying that many Americans have recognized that we have to fight back or the country is lost. And that‚Äôs what Trumpism is about IMHO.
To be clear ‚Äî I‚Äôm not suggesting that two wrongs make a right, rather that if there is no other way to preserve our institutions than to unite in opposition, shouldn‚Äôt we do so? This unity is not based on race or any ‚Äúism,‚Äù except a commitment to the American idea.
I have a question, especially for those who regard ‚Äútribalism‚Äù as a curse word: If the Left is inherently tribal &amp; intolerant, tyrannical, &amp; at war with its opponents, are those on the right ‚Äútribal‚Äù for joining together &amp; fighting back, or just doing what prudence requires?

@McAllisterDen @BibChr When does the book come out, BTW?
@BibChr I‚Äôve always been fascinated between the interrelationship between repentance and faith ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a condition precedent, integrally part of the saving act, or a byproduct of justification. I have read many different views on this and I think there is much confusion on it.
@McAllisterDen @BibChr Dan is a well-grounded and learned Bible scholar/pastor. He is just distinguishing between real faith and an imitation of it, IMHO.
@BibChr That‚Äôs exactly my point. Thank you. Not to diminish those cases where the person is absolutely sincere and his trust is real, but there has to be some intellectual understanding ‚Äî your‚Äôe not just trusting in a chimera.
@BibChr Yes ‚Äî I realize, BTW, that my reply re Promise Keepers didn‚Äôt directly address your point, but I‚Äôm just making an analogous point that the appearance of a saving act doesn‚Äôt always constitute one.
@BibChr That clarifies it. In this context, I‚Äôve often wondered whether those massive altar calls, at Promise Keepers, for example, are over-hyped. In some cases they seem emotionally driven to me ‚Äî and not really grounded. There‚Äôs no way to know, of course, but I‚Äôve wondered.

Did I post videos from this group before, i.e., #foxesandfossils ? I think they are extraordinarily good. https://t.co/faCSd6c5qc
@claudiascompan1 Same to you. Yes, doing great. How are you?
@t_murchie My point is that I don‚Äôt know what you are saying, yet you seem to be criticizing something I said and I can‚Äôt discern what your objection is. Maybe I‚Äôm obtuse. You said I‚Äôm either optimistic or naive. I don‚Äôt see how the tweet your responded to indicates that.
@thebigjman57 I tried to engage, failed, and then blocked.
