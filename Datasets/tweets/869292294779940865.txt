@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP But the alternative is unregulated firearm transfers which is very unsafe. Yes, you and I would not transfer weapons to dangerous people, but plenty of people do. That‚Äôs where my whole issue with responsibility comes in.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP Most of those programs already exist. They‚Äôd have to figure out how to make them more effective. Why do you find UBCs to be such a bad idea? I‚Äôve always had a background check when I purchase firearms. I think it‚Äôs a good initial screening tool.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP I think it would be great to keep government out as well. I see a major part of the problem as a responsibility issue. Possibly more firearm education would be helpful. I grew up shooting, but many people didn‚Äôt. More training might increase safety.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP https://t.co/Wu1t0nazIg
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP The one from 2016 has some great information and is very relevant. So how do we address the issue? That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm seeing the let down by our politicians.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP As far as I can tell, all the @GOP does is avoid doing anything. Can you be more specific as to the cultural and socioeconomic issues that cause gun violence? Do you have any data?
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise So what is it and what is the @GOP doing to address it?

@Rychkidz16 @ipersevere34 @GOP Right? We know Trump‚Äôs a liar and philanderer, but it‚Äôs not illegal unless he lies to law enforcement and/or under oath. Paying your lawyer for his services or to pay off a hooker is not a crime.

@fluff_sophie @sciblu27 @SteveScalise Many of them get them from people who purchase them legally and then sell them into the black market. Not sure why people think background checks are so intrusive. It‚Äôs really strange. If you‚Äôre a criminal, you shouldn‚Äôt have a gun.

@parscale How is something that is decreasing in frequency and has been going on ‚Äúfor 40 years‚Äù an emergency? And no ‚Äúemergency‚Äù justifies violating the Constitution.

@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman Calm down. I spent years in Venezuela. My friends are starving too. I hate Maduro. But Trump is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
@GOPChairwoman As the Trump Administration seems to think it‚Äôs their duty to pick a new leader for Venezuela, who was not elected or a true part of the resistance, and install them. Seems a lot like US action in Latin America in the 80s.
@realDonaldTrump This is some Kim Jung Un shit right here.
@NRA You mean just like illegal immigration?

@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz I appreciate that, and our earlier discussion regarding a joint CBP/DHS committee to recommend border security measures was great. However, I don‚Äôt think we need to have further discussion on how quickly I could climb over the wall.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz Likewise

@JJussely @VOTEMAGA2020 @RepMattGaetz You need to get over the idea that what you think is somehow reality. It‚Äôs not.
@JJussely @VOTEMAGA2020 @RepMattGaetz That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. You‚Äôd be a shitty drug smuggler. The data proves it. 85% through ports of entry. People can‚Äôt carry enough to be worth it. Also, I could be over that wall in 30 seconds with a bit of climbing rope. It won‚Äôt slow down anyone determined to get in.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have a voice. Our @POTUS decided to ignore our elected officials and our Constitution when he went around Congress to secure wall funding. That‚Äôs an autocracy and that is much more a danger to our nation than illegal immigration.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Personally, I‚Äôd recommend a joint commission, on public record, comprised of non-appointed staff including, at a minimum, 50% front-line agents with practical experience.
@parscale #SupportTheConstitution #FakeNationalEmergency I can‚Äôt wait for this to go to the SCOTUS
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz I don‚Äôt care about Beto. They have not conducted a joint formal study. If they did that, I‚Äôd go with their recommendation. They‚Äôre the experts, not me, you, or @realDonaldTrump. So far, both sides just interview random members of those departments who agree with wall vs. no wall.
@realDonaldTrump Build while you can, idiot. The SCOTUS is going to shut down your unconstitutional ‚Äúemergency‚Äù.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz That‚Äôs stupid. There‚Äôs better ways to secure the border and reduce crime than ‚Äúa wall‚Äù. The new spending bill was a good start, it just needs more funding. The best way to figure this out would be to have CBP and DHS do a study and make a formal recommendation.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz That may be true, but you‚Äôre one person. That‚Äôs like me saying that because there‚Äôs a mountain lion in my backyard, there‚Äôs mountain lions in everyone‚Äôs backyards. It‚Äôs just not the case.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz You‚Äôre not familiar with the scientific method or statistics, are you?
@Elizabe81542283 @chiproytx My point is that none of these people want to discuss the FACT that the number of Americans killed each year by illegal immigrants is a very small number.

@MsAvaArmstrong @TeaPartyRodT The CBO
@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz A) Don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs about security. If that we‚Äôre the case, they‚Äôd be asking for a wall on BOTH borders.	B) Both sides support funding for security that works: technology, staffing, SOME additional strategic walls or barriers.	C) Trump‚Äôs emergency is unconstitutional.
@MsAvaArmstrong @TeaPartyRodT They also pay $10.64 billion in taxes annually for benefits that many are unable to access. That‚Äôs $106.4 billion in 10 years in revenue. Numbers are fun.
@EdMcNeal @cologop No, they do not. Not even a little bit.
@cologop So we shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome together to stand up against homophobia, racism, and all forms of hate‚Äù? Seems like an odd platform.

@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz I lose interest when you start making things up. They can‚Äôt even secure 1/10 of the funding they need for the wall alone, but do you think they‚Äôre going to secure funding for increased technology along the wall they‚Äôll never build?
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz The majority of people don‚Äôt have fences in their yard. And our own homes are very different from an entire nation. I‚Äôm not paying to put a fence in your yard.
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz If they are pretending this is about stopping drugs and they know that 85% of the drugs come through ports of entry, why build a wall where only 15% of the drugs are coming through?
@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz So you really think that people won‚Äôt just climb over the wall if no one is there? I could be over that wall in 30 seconds. We just authorized billions of dollars in spending for the specific purpose of reinforcing ports of entry.

@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty @realDonaldTrump Dude, this isn‚Äôt about the law, it‚Äôs about constitutionality. These are not synonymous. Yes, I‚Äôm aware other POTUS‚Äô have done this. They have not done it in this way. By specifically using this to procure funding, he bypassed Congress‚Äô Constitutional mandate. End of story. Bye üëã
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty I bet the Japanese-Americans who were forced into internment camps had the same idea.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty I‚Äôm not debating @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs truthfulness, he‚Äôs a proven habitual liar. If we allow this to stand, we‚Äôre setting ourselves up for the next Democrat POTUS to take all military funding to address the ‚Äúclimate change emergency‚Äù. That‚Äôs how it works, it‚Äôs reflexive.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty He also DECLARED unequivocally that Mexico would pay for the wall. When it comes to safeguarding the Constitution, no one‚Äôs ‚Äúword‚Äù is good enough.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty And if our military was building the wall, that argument MIGHT pass muster.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty Interment camps were a (horrible and reprehensible) policy decision. This ‚Äúemergency‚Äù is solely fiscal as the spending bill provides plenty of funding for border security. I‚Äôm not sure why you want to argue against the very clear distinctions made in Article I. Take care.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty The unprecedented part relates to requisitioning funding that was already denied by Congress. Fiscal duties are specifically granted to Congress in Article I. To go around them by declaring an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù is unconstitutional.
@RealMGrimm @realDonaldTrump Try reading Article I

@TeaPartyRodT He should concede that ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù was oversimplified in his campaign and he really meant overall border security that includes barriers in strategic areas. That‚Äôs what he‚Äôs getting by signing which is good.
@TeaPartyRodT Watch: Next Dem POTUS is going to declare emergencies for gun violence and climate change and bypass Congress completely. If the SCOTUS supports Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúemergency‚Äù we‚Äôre boned.
@TeaPartyRodT Considering illegal immigration has been continually decreasing for almost 20 years, it‚Äôs not really an emergency. This just opens the door for Presidents to declare emergencies to bypass Congress and fund any dipshit idea that pops into their heads.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yeah, there is. Considering illegal immigration is 60% lower than it was in 2000 and most illegal drugs come through ports of entry, the @POTUS has no valid reason to declare an emergency. It‚Äôs unconstitutional.

@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Got any data on that?

@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse The Sandy Hook shooter used his mother‚Äôs firearms which she obviously failed to secure properly.
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Guess what, firearms are deadly weapons. They cause tens of thousands of deaths a year. Whether you like it or not, regulations will be increasing until gun violence goes down. Personally, I don‚Äôt mind more in depth background checks.
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse I had to go to the shop to buy the gun and my shop covers the cost. And yes, I expect responsible gun owners to be responsible for their guns. You act like a firearm isn‚Äôt a deadly weapon. I see no reason why I should be able to get a gun easier than I get a driver‚Äôs license.

@RepGosar @townhallcom While I agree this is (and has been for years) a national emergency, it is NOT an excuse to build a wall. These drugs are not being walked over the border, they are coming in on trucks and ships. Put the $5 billion for the wall towards detection technology and CBP staff.

@grandmacindy77 @WhiteHouse @POTUS True. But that‚Äôs not stopping our gun violence issue. Something has to be done and more guns isn‚Äôt the answer.
@KenF74921261 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sure, but how do you effectively keep firearms out of the hands of ‚Äúderanged‚Äù people? The laws we currently have obviously aren‚Äôt working.
@JoanneEggli @WhiteHouse @POTUS I‚Äôd support a law requiring all gun owners to attend annual training on firearm safety. I‚Äôd do it. Also, that Switzerland comment is false. I lived in Geneva for 2 years.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Well, it means your claim that people aren‚Äôt buying guns legally and trading them for drugs is, in fact, false. It is a common occurrence. And your assumption that I condone taking firearms from law-abiding citizens is ludicrous.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Great whataboutism üôÑ I own 6 Glocks, 2 Daniel Defense ARs, numerous hunting rifles, and dozens of shotguns. I‚Äôve got my CCW in 46 states and have carried for work when I worked in federal law enforcement. I‚Äôm definitely more familiar with illegal firearm trafficking than you.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS I don‚Äôt know why you can‚Äôt make the distinction between were and we‚Äôre. The issue is that in many cases, legally purchased firearms are put on the black market and become illegal. For instance, these weapons are likely being traded for drugs and heading south.
@Ray67030602 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Yes Ray67030602 (as if I‚Äôm talking to a real person) üôÑ I own many firearms. I agree that people should have access to them. But we need to do more to make sure shit like this isn‚Äôt happening.

@Q2x17 @cthalpin @Janisslee @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sounds like you‚Äôre a #MAGAt Realistically, the chances are good that these weapons were purchased legally in the United States and were destined south in exchange for drugs. There‚Äôs no need to bring guns to Texas.

@deathdragon007 @NRA ‚ÄúGoogle it‚Äù üôÑ
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA That‚Äôs fair.
@deathdragon007 @politiKutie @NRA A restraining does not necessarily have anything to do with a crime. Anyone can request a restraining order for any reason. The judge decides if it‚Äôs warranted. And being drunk isn‚Äôt a crime, but being drunk and in possession of a firearm is.
@deathdragon007 @NRA Do you have data to support that? I checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics and I‚Äôm not seeing anything that supports your assertion. Private sales are the easiest way to skirt background checks. That‚Äôs the so-called ‚Äúgun show loophole‚Äù.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Drug use (self-professed) and restraining orders/history of stalking can both result in failed background checks.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Untrue. There are other ways firearm ownership is already legally restricted beyond felony conviction: drug use and misdemeanor domestic violence violations. The current #2A interpretation does not rule out other means of restriction either. It would likely go to the SCOTUS.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Hence ‚Äúexpanded background checks‚Äù. I agree our current system is inadequate. My last background check took less than 5 min. That is not thorough.
@realDonaldTrump @AP4Liberty Could that be because you storm out of the room like an angry child when you don‚Äôt get what you want?
@deathdragon007 @NRA In how many of the mass shootings over the last 20 years did the shooter(s) fail to procure their firearm(s) legally? How many of them procured them legally?

@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Who quotes themself on Twitter? You can just Tweet your idiotic thought.
@kellyberry404 @GOP There is no country on the planet similar to ours that has attempted a wall along an entire border, so your assertion is spurious. Yes, the Vatican City and Israel have walls, but they do not have illegal immigration issues. Take care, I‚Äôm not going over the same point ad nauseam
@kellyberry404 @GOP Numerous estimates place the total costs at up to $50 billion. Regardless, $5 billion does not complete the project and will not be effective, assuming a wall by itself would even be effective, which is unlikely.
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Isn‚Äôt he the one who walked out of the room? What a petulant child.
@kellyberry404 @GOP But $5 billion is only 10% of construction costs. That doesn‚Äôt even consider maintenance and staffing. Improved legislation can stem the flow of illegal immigration more quickly and cost effectively.
@kellyberry404 @GOP I completely agree. However, the current Administration has shown no interest in comprehensive immigration reform, only a wall. I can‚Äôt get behind that as a rational method of addressing the issue of illegal immigration.

@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Usually, yes, you do. Not here. You‚Äôre making assumptions to validate your point of view rather than following facts.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu There‚Äôs something I‚Äôd vote to spend my tax money on.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu I‚Äôm over this discussion. You‚Äôre purposefully being obtuse to promote this wall agenda. I‚Äôm sorry, but you‚Äôre usually more logical. Have a good night.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Those are lots of questions. Did his camera show them carrying drugs? We KNOW they come through the ports of entry.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu And any farmer who lost 80% of their crop in transport would go out of business.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Lol. C‚Äômon. You know that‚Äôs no argument. If we‚Äôre concerned about drugs and we know exactly where a majority enter our country, why would we redirect our enforcement to an area that is admittedly unsubstantiated? It‚Äôs completely illogical.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu If 80% of their product were intercepted, cartels would not be in business (estimates are 20% intercepted). Also, heroin and cocaine are not produced in the US. Regardless of who created the prescription drug epidemic, much of it is smuggled into the US from Canada.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu So if we can‚Äôt know, how can it be a primary reason they say we need the wall?
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu How can you say that when there is no lack of drugs? Heroin, cocaine, and meth are cheaper now than in years. Millions of illegal prescription drugs are available in every community.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu The fact is that which enters via land comes through the ports of entry like Tijuana or Juarez. There aren‚Äôt trains of migrants hiking tons of drugs through the desert.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu The amount of drugs consumed annually compared to the amount intercepted shows that our mitigation efforts are woefully lacking. That‚Äôs where the $5 billion (and more) should go instead of building a dumbass wall.
@UtahTeaPartyROD If they‚Äôre going to pretend a wall will slow the import of drugs when it is well-known that the vast majority of drugs enter the US through ports of entry rather than unsecured sections of the border, then @tedlieu‚Äôs criticism is valid.

@armandlaurin48 @grilledcheez @SecNielsen @GOP Awww, is the Canadian mad? I‚Äôve spent time on both borders and if you wanted to get into the US undetected, the northern border is much less protected. Illegal immigration has very little to do with security.

@Frankie92300 @NRA That‚Äôs just ridiculous. If you own a firearm, you‚Äôre responsible for how that weapon is used. If you don‚Äôt believe that, you shouldn‚Äôt own firearms.
@thedeeraddict @NRA Dipshit. Name one time I‚Äôve called for a gun ban. I own guns, but my guns will never fall into the hands of children. A ban is no answer. Saying children dying from gun violence is ‚Äúshit happens‚Äù is heartless and just fucking pathetic.

@AndySmith9999 @NRA Put your guns in a damn safe. That‚Äôs where mine are when I‚Äôm not carrying. It‚Äôs not much of a sacrifice to possibly save a life. Owning a firearm is a responsibility as much as it‚Äôs a right.

@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Here, for the 2nd time, is the Texas statute defining manslaughter:		Sec. 19.04.  MANSLAUGHTER.  (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.		Driving without a license is not ‚Äúreckless‚Äù.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden 3) Yes, they could have and should have deported him.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden 1) You didn‚Äôt link a statute, you linked to a Google-searched law blog.	2) It doesn‚Äôt say what you‚Äôre saying. It says if negligence is determined in the accident, it can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor based on circumstances. This was never the charge in this case.
@AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic Sucks when businesses run their business, huh?
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden And there is NO American law that says an illegal immigrant who hurts an American must be deported. You‚Äôre just making things up. Deportation is a policy, not a law, and it is solely related to immigration status.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden There are laws to deport regardless of whether a crime, outside of the misdemeanor of illegal entry, has been committed. You are trying to place fault strictly based on immigration status. Do you not understand what ‚Äúnegligence‚Äù or ‚Äúfault‚Äù mean?
@mercedesschlapp What‚Äôs the border crisis? Illegal immigration is down. Mass hysteria is not a crisis.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Sec. 19.04.  MANSLAUGHTER.  (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.		Driving without a license is not ‚Äúreckless‚Äù.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Manslaughter relates to the outcome (death of another human being), fault, and intent. Without outcome AND fault, manslaughter can‚Äôt be charged. It was determined to be an accident.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden There‚Äôs nothing to rebut, you‚Äôre just wrong and obviously prejudiced against illegal (brown) aliens.

@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Involuntary manslaughter involves some finding of fault. The police found the driver not to be at fault. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre right, we don‚Äôt know that, but that‚Äôs the law. The law exists to protect as well as punish. Driving w/o a license does not automatically confer guilt.

@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden I did. I read every word before I commented. And I never referred to your daughter‚Äôs death as ‚Äújust an accident‚Äù. Regardless of how horrible the circumstances, police and judges are required to follow the law as written.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden My perspective is that if the federal government wants to treat illegal entry as a serious crime, they should make it a serious crime. Make it a felony with mandatory minimum sentences. I‚Äôll support that. That‚Äôs not the law now though.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. I‚Äôm just referring to the information you have on your web page. Entering the US illegally is a misdemeanor. The police, according to you, found he was not at fault. If I‚Äôm wrong about that, I apologize.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden What violent charge? The charge was driving without a license. The driver was sober and found to not be at fault. A tragedy, but an accident.

@3Therealgio Or giving tax cuts to the wealthy who then buy back their company‚Äôs stock, artificially inflating the market when there‚Äôs no actual growth, and then the inevitable crash when the money is spent, there‚Äôs no capital investment, and no more tax cuts to be had. You know, reality.

@UtahTeaPartyROD Numerous countries with single payer systems still have private insurance that supplements the state-funded system if people want additional coverage. We all pay in already, with single payer, we‚Äôd actually pay less.
@EricHolder If you just call it the ACA, Trump supporters wont know what you‚Äôre talking about and quit caring. Or, they might finally realize that‚Äôs how many of them were able to finally get insurance...
@UtahTeaPartyROD Single payer doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs only one choice, it just means all Americans have a basic level of coverage that gets them cost-free access to healthcare. Almost all single payer systems still have a private insurance sector.
@UtahTeaPartyROD As long as it‚Äôs a pass-through, I‚Äôm ok with it. There‚Äôs no hands-off approach the healthcare for the government.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Single payer also makes it easier to push pharmaceutical companies to lower prices to those that are paid by...other single payer systems. One payer for ALL of America gets a really good deal on prescription drugs.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Yes. And we need to eliminate the excessive admin costs (reduce number of insurers). 30% of medical costs are administrative. This is why single payer makes sense.
@UtahTeaPartyROD that drove up the costs in the first place. 2/2
@UtahTeaPartyROD Such as? And do you remember the first drafts of the ACA? Before all the concessions were made to get it passed? Bottom line is: Millions of Americans have access to healthcare that the current Administration is trying to take away while giving tax cuts to the corporations.. 1/2
@UtahTeaPartyROD We could ALL afford healthcare if the Feds didn‚Äôt allow prescription drug companies and private insurance companies to run amok.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Access to healthcare is a ‚Äúfeel good social reform‚Äù? It‚Äôs also a fiscal benefit: preventative medicine leads to lower incidence of chronic disease and major health issues that cost many times more than the preventative measures.

@CrimeResearch1 @Slov819 @NRA @FoxNews I can see why you‚Äôd want to take that out. Has the same been done on your world statistics? Are you excluding military action and gang activities from, say, Mexico‚Äôs data?
@CrimeResearch1 @Slov819 @NRA Maybe it would help to know your definition of mass shooting event.
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA I studied Constitutional law at Hopkins, so don‚Äôt try to pretend this is over my head
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA Yeah, like I said, I‚Äôve read it. Regardless of the background, it became the defining decision for #2A interpretation. The @NRA is asserting in their article that it was incorrect to venture outside the bounds of the case. What about that don‚Äôt you understand?
@CrimeResearch1 @Slov819 @NRA Would you like the CSV file with the list of mass shootings in the US in 2018 to cross reference? Send me your email, I‚Äôll get it right over to you. It has dates, locations, and # of victims. All verifiable from multiple sources. Yes, even @FoxNews.
@NRA Certainly not defenders of factual information.
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA I‚Äôve read Heller plenty. I agree with Scalia‚Äôs interpretation on the #2A. The @NRA article claims that the SCOTUS went beyond its reach in ruling on issues besides firearm storage in DC a specifically called out their provisions on limiting firearm access to felons &amp; mentally ill
@Slov819 @NRA @CrimeResearch1 Not questionable, it‚Äôs patently false information. In 2018 alone there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in which 5 or more people (per incidence) have been injured or killed.

@AverageDave1 @DonJT_be_a_dick @NRA @CrimeResearch1 How about the FACT that in the US in 2018 there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in which 5 or more individuals have been injured or killed? @NRA says it‚Äôs only 53 in 18 years. How about the 25 instances THIS YEAR in which 3 or more people were shot to death?
@NRA @CrimeResearch1 25 in 2018 in which 3 or more people were KILLED.
@NRA @CrimeResearch1 If you‚Äôd like an actual, verifiable fact, there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in the United States in 2018 in which 5 or more people (per event) were injured or killed.

@TJ_TacoJack @NRA Explain how a Justice writing a dissenting opinion can ‚Äúsubstitute his opinion for law‚Äù. Have you read Heller? I have. I agree with Scalia. Regardless of how Scalia came to his decision, it was the majority opinion and therefore the current judicial interpretation of the #2A.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA So then how did Justice Stevens ‚Äúsubstitute his opinion for law‚Äù?

@TJ_TacoJack @NRA The majority opinion in Heller was written by Scalia, you idiot.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA No. All I said is that more people were killed in the same year that CCW permits increased. The fact is that residents of DC (higher chance of being killed) with more people carrying concealed weapons. Present your data liar.
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA So you can‚Äôt read. Ok. Did you miss the part where they said the SCOTUS overstepped their bounds in Heller declaring that felons and people suffering from mental illness should have limited access to firearms?

@FruitJaw @TJ_TacoJack @NRA And this is just an ignorant statement.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA What are you talking about? Homicides (people who were murdered) increased by 50% when CCW permits (good guys with guns) increased exponentially. I thought more people carrying guns legally was supposed to make us more safe?

@thedeeraddict @NRA @DCPoliceDept Right, but the homicide rate increased drastically.

@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 As I told your friend, what you perceive doesn‚Äôt matter. They are well within their legal and Constitutional rights. If they said or made any actions to use their fire arms against someone, that would be a different story.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD Fortunately, what you think does not matter. They are well within their legal and Constitutional rights. End of story.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 I‚Äôm not missing anything. The two of you are trying to place meaning on someone‚Äôs actions simply based on their political party. Until something illegal has happened, there‚Äôs nothing to be done.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD You appear to be confused as to the meaning of the Second Amendment and our Constitution. It applies to everyone. It‚Äôs because people have done something illegal, I would wholly support their arrest.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 There‚Äôs no point in citing a case where the charge was brandishing when these people are not brandishing a weapon. This is just political posturing.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 They are not brandishing a weapon. They‚Äôre carrying their weapons at rest. Completely legal.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD How is walking with a firearm at rest intimidation? And since when do I have to demonstrate the need for protection to carry a firearm?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 Then what‚Äôs your issue with them? That they‚Äôre supporting a Democrat? Or that you think they‚Äôre trying to intimidate people?
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD Well, you‚Äôre criticizing people for bearing arms legally...
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 Seems pretty clear that they‚Äôre excercising their Constitutional rights. Not sure why it‚Äôs got y‚Äôall so twisted up. Is it because they support a Democrat?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 So what‚Äôs your point? It looks like, to me, that they are legally expressing their right to bear arms, right?
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD So you oppose the #2A?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 What it looks like to you or me doesn‚Äôt matter. They have the right to carry those arms. Period.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 It doesn‚Äôt matter what anyone thinks. #2A gives us the right to protect ourselves and, in some states, open carry. As long as they follow the law, it‚Äôs their right to carry their weapons.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 And? I open carry all the time and I‚Äôm not trying to ‚Äúintimidate‚Äù anyone. It‚Äôs stupid to say a party supports the #2A, but only for their own party.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD So how is this intimidation vs. protection? Seems suspicious that they‚Äôre using a screenshot of a video rather than the actual footage ü§î What‚Äôs the actual context?

@DonaldJTrumpJr @SenatorBrakey And who the fuck are you? Some trust fund baby? GTFOH. You represent .01% of the population you nationalist asshole.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Lol üòÇ It‚Äôs already on the downswing. You can only prop up the economy with tax cuts for so long. The last two years of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs presidency are going to see more losses than the gains we‚Äôve seen.

@SeemaCMS You seem pretty absolute for something that is theoretical. There are numerous ways in which a single-payer system could be implemented that would actually decrease costs. But that would cost profits for private insurance and pharmaceutical companies üò≤

@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany The free market is what led to the issue of skyrocketing drug prices and private insurance premiums. There is no competition with pharmaceutical drugs due to patent restrictions.
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany That‚Äôs not a factual response. Comparing the ACA to a single-payer system is incongruent. Repeating it does not make it real.
@GOPChairwoman State-run media is super creepy.
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany Why don‚Äôt you try reading what I wrote and THEN responding. I‚Äôd love to see how you could factually contradict any of my points.
@kayleighmcenany Let‚Äôs see, the risk pool would be more diluted which would drive down costs. The federal government could bargain with providers and pharmaceutical companies to drive down prices. Increased access to preventative medicine would further decrease costs...
@SeemaCMS #NotWinning https://t.co/FI6nU7r7hH
@SeemaCMS The fact that in your position you are unable to even contemplate the possibility of some form of single-payer healthcare system is what‚Äôs truly scary.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I like how you don‚Äôt @ him since you‚Äôre a punk.
@realDonaldTrump Weren‚Äôt your kids born before Ivana became a US citizen?
@AntonioSabatoJr How about you ‚Äúlearn the language‚Äù? Your grammar is atrocious. Also, the US has no formal language. The Founding Fathers were intelligent and realized that immigration and diversity add to and strengthen our country.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because Mexico is dangerous and they speak a different language. If @realDonaldTrump ends birthright citizenship, will you move to Czechoslovakia since your mother wasn‚Äôt a US citizen when you and your siblings were born?
@realDonaldTrump No, It‚Äôs you.

@SesslarMark @dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl You do realize that this many people enter our country illegally every week already, right? Probably not. What we need is immigration reform, but all our politicians do is talk.
@SesslarMark @dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl I‚Äôm sorry, are you housing homeless American citizens in your house?
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl @realDonaldTrump 1) There‚Äôs no wall and no immigration reform. @realDonaldTrump failed. 	2) Noncitizens are not voting in federal elections, the only elections in which citizenship is required. States/counties/cities are allowed to let whomever they like vote. 	3) Take care, you‚Äôre dull. https://t.co/6iO0ILSFVp
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl If @realDonaldTrump ever introduces an immigration bill that doesn‚Äôt hinge on wall funding, his claims that he wants immigration reform would be believable. And his own commission found no evidence to support his claims of noncitizens voting, so just give up that tired nonsense.
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl the penalties for illegal entry since it‚Äôs currently only a misdemeanor.
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl Volume of script? I pay my taxes. I‚Äôd rather have it go towards helping people fleeing violence than towards building a pointless wall.

@InFrontUS01 @DawnDavis64 @vjoycejkl And as I already let you know, that is a lie. Tell the truth or go away.

@rolandscahill Because it‚Äôs all about money.

@JohnCornyn We have Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, subsidized plans (ACA), and private insurance. How would you suggest we make the market more competitive? ACA coverage is optional already.

@KatrinaPierson So you‚Äôre comparing baby powder to actual bombs?
@uttppROD @GOP @POTUS Most (on both sides) are not instigating or proposing violence, but I would say that anyone generating or propagating #FakeNews has played a significant part in actions like these.
@uttppROD This is infuriating. He‚Äôs no more a representative of the @GOP than the guy who shot Steve Scalise was of the Democrats. But everyone is either trying to say it‚Äôs the @GOP‚Äôs fault or it‚Äôs a false flag. IT WAS ONE CRAZY ASSHOLE and our @POTUS needs to tone down his violent rants.
@Cassidy1726 @SchlaflysCorpse @GreenET1832 @dannycarson4 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You realize you are just rattling off @GOP buzzwords when they go into defense mode. Are you a bot?

@Cassidy1726 @SchlaflysCorpse @GreenET1832 @dannycarson4 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Is there something unclear about sending live bombs to people‚Äôs houses? No. You‚Äôre trying to insinuate that this is some political move by the Democrats to evoke sympathy for the midterms. It‚Äôs like accusing Steve Scalise of hiring a hit man to shoot him.

@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/12Qnk8202R
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @POTUS He also insinuated that Democrats sent the bombs to take attention off the Honduran migrants.
@AntonioSabatoJr https://t.co/jv9VTvhx0D
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TPUSA @realDonaldTrump What was that? 300 people?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Wasn‚Äôt it a book review?
@RealJamesWoods So you bang people who live under overpasses?
@bennyjohnson Baby powder and bombs are very different. Maybe you learn that at 4 months old.
@BrentScher @CNN Why would they say that? It‚Äôs definitely in part his fault.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump You mean the book review?
@DonaldJTrumpJr So by referring to it as white powder, we know that it was not harmful. So she got baby powder in her face that was meant for you.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty No one is failing to condemn the violent or threatening actions taken against anyone else, simply pointing out that there is a vast level of difference in severity between bombs and beans. Attempting to normalize these bombs is exactly what you‚Äôre condemning.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty Interesting you put beans in quotes but not ricin as if saying beans is somehow questionable when the fact is that it was beans, not ricin. You‚Äôre essentially saying that sending an threatening email is the same as putting a bomb in a school. Not the same regardless of intent.
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD Yes, causing harm to anyone is bad. Sending viable bombs to people‚Äôs homes is much more severe than sending ground up beans. There is no comparison.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Yes, that‚Äôs the travesty üôÑ
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD You‚Äôd need to eat pounds and pounds of castor beans to achieve a lethal dose of ricin which is synthesized from the oil. It was not any kind of danger to the recipients. Using multiple !! is akin to yelling online.
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD They were Castor beans, not ricin. Ground up beans. And you‚Äôre the one yelling.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty You mean the Castor beans? It wasn‚Äôt synthesized into actual poison. They were ground up beans. üôÑ
@uttppROD Empty buildings vs. attempted murder
@uttppROD No, not really. Yelling at McConnell is not the same as sending 10(?) people pipe bombs.
@uttppROD Broken windows are less severe than viable bombs. Period. Yes, it‚Äôs all awful, disgusting behavior which has unfortunately become the norm, but these attempted bombings are a significant escalation.
@uttppROD You‚Äôre better than this. Seriously.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD Well, considering the @GOP is in control of all 3 branches of the federal gov‚Äôt, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs currently up to them. As of right now, illegal entry is a misdemeanor. Hence my suggestion of immigration reform.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD So you are advocating that the US should drop everything and focus ONLY on US gang violence? What about the opioid epidemic? Or illegal immigration? Or our exploding debt? Maybe we should put a little time towards immigration reform instead of just whining about it...ü§î
@uttppROD He‚Äôs already attacking the media again, so that whole unity farce is pretty much out the window already. It makes for nice sound bites though.
@FoxNews @PressSec Lol. They‚Äôve already got that dude in Gitmo. We‚Äôll never hear who he was or see pictures of his bunker full of @realDonaldTrump shrines.
@SurrattPam @FoxNews A) Illegal entry is a misdemeanor. If they really cared, it‚Äôd be a felony.	B) More people enter the US illegally every 4 days than there are people in the ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù.	C) It‚Äôs mostly women and children fleeing one of the deadliest countries on earth.
@SurrattPam @FoxNews News update: The ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù is a bunch of people walking across an entire country. They‚Äôre about 10 miles closer than yesterday. Update complete.
@haakemom @FoxNews https://t.co/ul2yyX9lSF
@akvawe66 @uttppROD That‚Äôs not how averages and rates work. If that‚Äôs how you want to compare, the murder rate in Honduras is 12 times higher than that of the US. Honduras is one of the deadliest countries on the planet.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD I‚Äôm guessing the fact that the murder rate in Honduras is 3 times that of Chicago probably plays a part in the mass migration.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Each time you say something it is ‚Äúthe dumbest statement in the history of both politics and economics‚Äù.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Once again, you‚Äôve failed miserably in your charge.

@ida_skibenes He already called them good people.
@Jordanfabian @PressSec Will he pay the legal fees once a suspect is detained?
So how long until the @GOP stops pretending to be horrified about these packages and starts saying it was #Antifa or Soros trying to sabotage the midterms?

@DonaldJTrumpJr Probably people who don‚Äôt want other people to starve to death. So obviously not the @GOP.

@realDonaldTrump Remember when your family pretended to be Swedish? üòÇüòÇ
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump Anyone who believes that some god gives them rights over the written law of the land known as our Constitution is stupid. I stand by that. I also stand by their 1A right to practice their religion, but those rules do not supersede the Constitution. Take care Doug.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump With your ‚Äúlaw degree‚Äù, I‚Äôm surprised you weren‚Äôt aware that the defamation simply referred to Ms. Daniels‚Äô claims that @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs statements were injurious to her character and reputation. It has nothing to do with her claims about their alleged affair.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump That‚Äôs cute Douglas. Yes, I‚Äôm an actual lawyer, not just someone pretending to ‚Äúhave a law degree‚Äù on Twitter. I specialize in Constitutional Law. Awarding attorney‚Äôs fees is standard practice when frivolous suits are thrown out. It has nothing to do with Daniels‚Äô claims.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Having jobs that cant be filled and stagnant wages is not a good thing.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump When you have to preface your point with ‚Äúbasically‚Äù, you‚Äôre already wrong. People unfamiliar with the law try to read in their own opinions with the judge‚Äôs. All this judge said is they did not see @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs comments about Stormy Daniels as defamation.
@SeemaCMS So what are your solutions to combat rising health care and prescription costs? Cut funding and leave more people to fend for themselves? Yes, simply ‚Äúgiving‚Äù everyone Medicare is not the answer, but there many variations of the premise that could work.
@SarahPalinUSA It has nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump being right. It‚Äôs a defamation case. The case was regarding whether Trump defamed her or not.
@RepMullin @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr So @MichaelAvenatti proposing a fight is ridiculous, but you doing the same thing is...?
@KatrinaPierson Remember when right wing mob members plowed their car into a crowd and gang-beat people on the street in NYC wearing #MAGA hats? Sorry this guy‚Äôs brother had to walk around some people though. That‚Äôs tough.

It‚Äôs fun to mute #MAGA morons and let them go on ranting nonsense thinking they‚Äôre winning an argument.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Lol. Nice try. It says nothing about taxes. It also fails to account for the fact that these are jobs Americans don‚Äôt want and won‚Äôt do for the most part. Anyway, there‚Äôs no point arguing with someone who‚Äôs already made up their mind. Have a good night.
@RudyGiuliani You‚Äôre the one Tweeting the word ‚ÄúRAGE‚Äù in all caps, Rudy.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse Except in Saudi Arabia...or Russia...or North Korea...
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Also, the whole point @RepAndyBiggsAZ is trying to make is that illegal immigrants are bad because they cost taxpayers money when, in fact, there is a net gain and the work done by illegal immigrants stimulates our economy and supports numerous industries.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Shit, sorry. Does the money not go to the feds? It gets credited to the account of the SSN being used. Regardless of which ‚Äúaccount‚Äù it‚Äôs paid to, it‚Äôs still paid out to beneficiaries who are currently drawing from Social Security.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ In most cases, it‚Äôs deducted directly from their paychecks so they don‚Äôt even file taxes. The $12 billion is the net input. And like I said, the employers are typically the ones providing the false SSNs yet no one seems to care about that.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Whomever‚Äôs their employer gives them in most cases. Either way, they can‚Äôt claim it so it‚Äôs actually helping the Social Security program.

RT @TomthunkitsMind: 2 Historical Moments:		1st time in 30 years Washington Post has said a nominee should be rejected		1st time in HISTORY‚Ä¶
@GovMikeHuckabee So the entire @GOP belittling Dr. Ford from day one, how does that fit into your strategy? You can believe in a woman‚Äôs right to choose and not be violent towards other people. Millions do it each day. Just like most Christians are good people, but some are politicians.
@GovMikeHuckabee Whereas, you could try to confirm a SCOTUS nominee who has been accused of sexual misconduct without bothering to look into the accusations at all. Lesson: ALL politicians put party over people.
@JohnCornyn That‚Äôs interesting. Do you have ANY proof or are you just talking shit? Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs a rhetorical question.
@KatrinaPierson You need to learn the meaning of ‚Äúdue process‚Äù. Kavanaugh is not owed confirmation by virtue of his nomination. Each Senator has the duty to vote based on their belief regarding the nominee‚Äôs suitability for the position. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúrepresentative democracy‚Äù.
@CBNNews Keep your faith to yourself. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs YOUR faith.
@uttppROD The philosophy of socialism, much like democracy, is virtuous in theory, but generally bastardized and abused when put into practice by greedy egoists known as politicians.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ No, no he doesn‚Äôt.
@realDonaldTrump keeps holding these rallies because they‚Äôre the ONLY place he can go where the majority of the people in the room DON‚ÄôT hate him. #MAGA üòÇ
@FoxNews @POTUS Eww, he‚Äôs close to my farm. Go away!
@BillOReilly What does this have to do with due process?
@kayleighmcenany @kevincramer Sounds like she should vote with her conscience since she‚Äôs not getting re-elected.
@AntonioSabatoJr @BobMenendezNJ Why don‚Äôt you get voted in first. (Not going to happen)
@realDonaldTrump No. I‚Äôm not. Don‚Äôt ever speak for me.
Have you seen some of the right are tagging their posts with #mestupid to mock the #metoo movement? I like that they‚Äôre not only not creative, but they are now identifying themselves as morons.
@KatrinaPierson You get how tagging your post with #mestupid makes you look, right? Maybe you don‚Äôt. üòÇ
@senorrinhatch The main takeaway was Kavanaugh‚Äôs inappropriate temperament to hold a judgeship.

@GOPChairwoman Same thing @LindseyGrahamSC said. Key point: Democrat AND Republicans are party first, people second.
@AntonioSabatoJr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Nobody is trying to bully or scare you. Nobody cares about you. You are irrelevant.
@AntonioSabatoJr Says the failed actor...
@kayleighmcenany You seem to forget the fact an investigation was conducted and he was cleared. That‚Äôs the same treatment Kavanaugh is receiving. He‚Äôs just in the news more because he is up for a position on the SCOTUS rather than a state AG.
@GuyGriesmann @NRA Right. Obviously. So why bother? It‚Äôs just a publicity stunt. If the @NRA cares about school security, why don‚Äôt they donate some of their billions to schools to pay for better security? Start a grant program.
@NRA Superintendents are actually in schools very rarely. Most of their time is spent in meetings out in the community.
@KatrinaPierson You mean AFTER the investigation was conducted and no evidence was found, they cleared him? Crazy üôÑ
@CB68spc @NRA International sales of small arms and light weapons that aren‚Äôt legal in the US account for billions of dollars of revenue annually, much more than the US market. I tend to think people will go for money over morality most of the time. Sad but true.
@CB68spc @NRA You‚Äôre commenting on an NRA thread on Twitter. The government knows you have guns. Also, the US does not have to sign on to the treaty. The only reason to sink the treaty is profits. Anyway, thanks for at least bothering to look over it. Have a good night.
@CoolHandLuke124 @mdobbs1316 @Liz_Cheney https://t.co/XWOOwsNqX4
@CB68spc @NRA https://t.co/HeSPPZnjl5 		The @NRA lobbied particularly hard against these treaties. Land mines passed no problem, SALWs not so much.
@CB68spc @NRA Are they having trouble selling their wares? No. But the @NRA works outside of the US to influence policy that leads to more weapons in war zones. That‚Äôs where the real money is and it‚Äôs not in America. Hard to defend the #2A in countries without one.
@CB68spc @NRA Is the Elmer Fudd thing something the Russian bots came up with or did you @NRA dipshits have a little clan meeting about it? You‚Äôre the third one of you that‚Äôs called me that. I absolutely support the #2A. The @NRA supports profits for firearm and ammunition manufacturers.
@thehill How unfortunate they won‚Äôt be able to grope women like their grandfather did back in the good old days.
@CB68spc @NRA That‚Äôs why I own firearms.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Historic? It‚Äôs NAFTA 2.0
@Jim_Jordan And you would rather rush the confirmation of a possible sexual predator than take a week to have the FBI look into the accusations. I guess the moral is that Congress is full of scumbags.
@CoolHandLuke124 @mdobbs1316 @Liz_Cheney Sorry, I had two of you bots replying on the same thread. I guess your handlers didn‚Äôt coordinate well. You hire lawyers because you are not an expert in the law. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre good at things too, like speaking Russian. üòÇ And yes, you‚Äôre still wrong. Filing a suit is easy.
@SpeakerRyan A trilateral trade agreement...	That sounds familiar...	What are they going to call it?
@LindseyGrahamSC I‚Äôd respond with a defamation suit. But I‚Äôd be innocent, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôd do what makes sense when falsely accused. I guess that‚Äôs not common knowledge for a...judge. ü§î
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your father is a draft dodger. Nuff said. Sit down Baby Bone Spurs.
@NRA I love America, I‚Äôm a hunter and gun owner, and I despise the @NRA.
@KatrinaPierson This is why party loyalty is stupid. Yes, the Republican Party was different 50 years ago and did great things. That has changed. Vote based on a candidates actions, not party.
@KatrinaPierson Are you accusing @SenBooker of this crime @KatrinaPierson? Should we loop the @FBI in on this?
@McAllisterDen @uttppROD It‚Äôs called disassociative speech. Many trauma victims speak like that when reliving their experiences. It helps them to speak about it from outside the event.
@FoxNews @edhenry I thought NAFTA was the worst deal ever made?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Sorry life has been so unfair to you.
@CoolHandLuke124 @mdobbs1316 @Liz_Cheney It absolutely makes me more of an expert in the law than you. And I claim you‚Äôre a bot because you‚Äôve been on Twitter for six years and you only have 30 some followers. Those are bots. Take care.
@mdobbs1316 @CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney I practice law ‚ÄúMarti‚Äù, how about you?
@GOP @mercedesschlapp But it‚Äôs totally cool to belittle a woman who‚Äôs dedicated her life to teaching, right?
@SteveGuest @kayleighmcenany Considering it IS happening while the @GOP holds all the power, this statement is simply idiotic.
@JohnCornyn Really? Just the Democrats? Don‚Äôt hurt yourself falling off your high-horse up there on the high road. You politicians are all fear-mongering, power-grubbing traitors. You are supposed to represent the People, not your Parties.
@senorrinhatch Y‚Äôall fought tooth and nail to avoid either a hearing or an investigation.
@Liz_Cheney He‚Äôs a SCOTUS nominee. They need to be held to higher standards. We can vote Feinstein out; Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment.
@NRA Any evidence to correlate those two pieces of information?
@KatrinaPierson It‚Äôll be interesting to see what she tells the FBI.
@AntonioSabatoJr @FBI @HillaryClinton @BarackObama For what? Are you making false accusations @AntonioSabatoJr? Good thing you were stupid enough to loop the @FBI in on it from the get-go.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Have I advocated for Kavanaugh to resign? No. Do I support investigations into the accusations against both Kavanaugh and Ellison? Yes. Is that happening? Yes. I‚Äôve not seen anything about Booker and I was 16 when Clinton was in office. Stop being stupid.
@carysimond @uttppROD https://t.co/tzVO7qYkfL
@DavidAFrench FFS, nothing is black and white. If you‚Äôre falsely accused, you have legal recourse. They can be charged with filing a false report or defamation. The only reason not to utilize these routes is if you are guilty, because they do demand an investigation.
@newtgingrich Did he finally take his Xanax? Wouldn‚Äôt want him stroking out in rage while defends men‚Äôs rights to molest women.
@RealCandaceO @kanyewest Does he have anyone to corroborate his accusations?
@GOP @PressSec That‚Äôs like calling someone disgusting for sneezing next to the salad bar as you piss in the soup.
@AntonioSabatoJr @jack You can have a liberal bias or be liberally biased, but I don‚Äôt think that you can actually be a liberal bias. Also, you‚Äôre whining about censorship as you freely post on their private platform.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Are you insane? No one is talking about abortion. And if you mention political party when discussing the SCOTUS, you‚Äôve already lost the idea behind this legal body which is supposed to rise above partisan politics. Another reason why Kavanaugh is unfit for the Court.
@AntonioSabatoJr You‚Äôre not even well-known in your first profession. Losing your election will simply twice confirm your irrelevance.

@GOPChairwoman You are defending the idea that victims of rape and/or molestation should be ignored. Don‚Äôt talk about low.
@BillOReilly People speaking out and contacting their representatives IS America‚Äôs political system. At least that‚Äôs the principle upon which this country was founded.

@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney P.S. Bank*bot, in what sense is Kavanaugh not receiving due process? Please detail that.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Well, it bears enough weight for an FBI investigation. And if I were accused and I knew it to be false allegations, I would bring a defamation suit against my accuser and sue them into bankruptcy. Why hasn‚Äôt Kavanaugh done that? Right, that requires an investigation.

@DaniForAmerica @uttppROD https://t.co/2ZARg7iQHm
@LauraLoomer @uttppROD @keithellison @doug_wardlow @KarenMonahan01 So a MN AG who hurts women is unacceptable, but a SCOTUS Justice who molests them is cool? Personally, I‚Äôd say neither is fit for office.
@TheJordanRachel @uttppROD It‚Äôs kind of WEIRD no one attacks men for reporting sexual abuse by priests that happened 40 or more years ago.
@Liz_Cheney Right. It‚Äôs much better to teach girls any women not to speak up about sexual abuse because they will be disbelieved and ridiculed. You all don‚Äôt even know what due process means. Kavanaugh is getting due process right now.
@AntonioSabatoJr You‚Äôre not even going to arrive, loser.
@SteveKingIA So you have a lot of experience dealing with the emotional aftermath of sexual assault? You sure seem willing to comment on how WOMEN who‚Äôve experienced this SHOULD process the event(s).
@RolloofRosslyn @RepMattGaetz I see English comprehension is not your strong suit. Me first what?
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Serious accusations were made. An investigation is being conducted to ascertain the available facts. A judge should understand and agree with this process.
@Conservativeind That‚Äôs one of the more ignorant statements I‚Äôve seen today.
@Mikejon88233155 @uttppROD @realDonaldTrump It helps if they don‚Äôt start out that way. Also, term limits. And a ban from lobbying after leaving office. We also need campaign finance reform and a reversal of Citizens United.
@WalshFreedom @AP4Liberty It should be more popular. Not sure why the @GOP is fighting it so hard.
@LibertyCliff @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake Well, there‚Äôs always the enormous budget deficit we‚Äôll see next year.
@uttppROD @realDonaldTrump We need politicians who aren‚Äôt politicians: teachers, business owners, farmers. People who‚Äôve worked for a living and aren‚Äôt beholden to corporations or lobbyists.

@uttppROD @realDonaldTrump Our government is incompetent. We are going to be dealing with this fiasco for 10 years or more.
@charliekirk11 Due process? I‚Äôm sorry, did I miss when Kavanaugh was charged with a crime. If he feels he has been defamed, there are manners of legal recourse available to him. As a judge, you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd be aware of that fact.
@marcorubio @nikkihaley @UN Not doing much good since things just keep getting worse there.
@WaysandMeansGOP Stock market stalled out. Better fluff it back up with a quick infusion of cash that just puts us further behind. #MidtermsAreComing
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC It‚Äôs cool. Talk away. We‚Äôll ignore you. Hack.
@KatrinaPierson You are just an absolutely horrendous person.
@ErikFritts75 @TheAmadisKay @LindseyGrahamSC Interesting how no one questions the accusations against priests who molested children, sometimes more than 50 years ago. It‚Äôs as if it only makes a difference here because of politics...ü§î
@kayleighmcenany Why not? Seriously?
@JohnCornyn You‚Äôre all crooks. The @GOP doesn‚Äôt care about the accusations and the Dems wouldn‚Äôt vote for any Justice nominated by the GOP. Most Americans just want to be sure our next SCOTUS isn‚Äôt a molester.
@uttppROD It would be a shame to learn that these allegations were false. I think that seems unlikely. The probability is that it will have been too long to find any definitive evidence and the nomination will move forward.
@pastormarkburns Rarely do I agree with you, but in this belief we concur.
@RepMattGaetz Right. The ABA and even Dershowitz say we need to delay, but we should trust you jackals (politicians)? GTFOH
@uttppROD If they come back with information backing him, he‚Äôll get confirmed. I‚Äôm not sure why this is such a problem. The only way this hurts Kavanaugh is if the FBI finds factual evidence against him.
Let‚Äôs just get this off to a start... 	#ImpeachKavanaugh
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC You will go down in history as a partisan fraud. The @GOP will lose power and Kavanaugh will be impeached. When the ABA and even @AlanDersh says you should postpone, you political hacks should listen up.
@katshouse85 @AntonioSabatoJr You don‚Äôt even know the meaning of intuitive, do you? Sad. Intuition has nothing to do with my assessment of @AntonioSabatoJr‚Äôs intelligence, or lack thereof, and his definite upcoming defeat. Go back to your thesaurus.
@KimStrassel Even Dershowitz says they need to postpone.
@uttppROD Even Dershowitz says they need to postpone for an investigation. Kavanaugh is going to end up getting impeached. They‚Äôre never going to stop going after him and there‚Äôs obviously dirt somewhere.
@AntonioSabatoJr *You‚Äôre an idiot and are going to lose your election.
@RudyGiuliani You seem to forget our representatives should represent their constituents, not their party.
@uttppROD Did you see the ABA is petitioning the Senate to delay the hearings until an investigation has been completed?
@SenBobCorker @senorrinhatch @SenBobCorker why can‚Äôt the hearing process be put on hold while an investigation is conducted? It was alright to leave the Court with only 8 Justices for a year when the @GOP simply wanted to steal the nomination. An investigation would only take 2-3 weeks.
America lost today. Our politicians are clowns. The world is laughing (sadly) at us. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
@RealOmarNavarro @PressGop @Alyssa_Milano Rumor has it you‚Äôre running for office. Have fun losing.
@FoxNews If you want due process, ask for an investigation. I thought you were a judge?
@uttppROD Too much emotion for a SCOTUS Justice. He doesn‚Äôt have the temperament. That man has rage issues.
@RealOmarNavarro You are nothing.
@kayleighmcenany You are absolutely insane.
@kayleighmcenany You‚Äôre quoting Joe Biden. That‚Äôs how you know the @GOP is lost, @FoxNews entertainers like @kayleighmcenany are quoting Joe Biden.
@Tlross12Theresa @FoxNews Google translate seems to be off. üòÇ
@DLoesch You act as if you KNOW the truth. It‚Äôs just ignorant. Put the nomination on hold, conduct an actual investigation, then proceed. It‚Äôs not complicated and there‚Äôs no sense of urgency for a nomination. We went a full year with just 8 Justices not so long ago.
@NRA The SCOTUS protects our #2A rights, not a lobbying firm like the @NRA.
@GOP @PressSec How about you just come out and say it then? State unequivocally that Ford is a liar. Instead you insinuate to cover your ass. It‚Äôs pathetic.
@GOP Y‚Äôall should back away from this train wreck ASAP. @realDonaldTrump has already started hedging his bets.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs not the case. We won‚Äôt know until there is a law banning AR-15s, or some similar law, that is challenged in court. It‚Äôs all hypothetical. That‚Äôs why we have a justice system rather the governance via Twitter. Have a nice day.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA That has been extended to fully-automatic weapons as well. It‚Äôs not up to you or I to decide what constitutes a weapon ‚Äúnot typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.‚Äù That‚Äôs up to the courts who should use reliable data to reach a decision.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA The language reads, ‚ÄúWe therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, like short-barreled shotguns.‚Äù
@DonaldJTrumpJr You really did not have to clarify that you are not a psychology professor. Nobody thought that. Nobody.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Scalia himself agreed that certain weapons that pose a great risk to the general public must be controlled. Many firearms are currently illegal for public possession. I agree with that assessment. Im not saying their ‚Äúshould‚Äù be an ‚ÄúAR ban‚Äù. Research is needed.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @Devildorff @uttppROD Kavanaugh has the means. He could start a GoFundMe if not (he certainly seems to have a lot of supporters). The idea that your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is to immediately disbelieve people who come forward with claims of sexual abuse is abhorrent.
@Jim_Jordan How about you act like decent people?
@charliekirk11 @AntonioSabatoJr Standing for truth would mean calling for an investigation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So Ford accusing Kavanaugh seems suspicious to you, but two guys admitting to a crime that they were not accused of is legit? I guess growing up Trump leads to a skewed view of reality.
@GOPChairwoman I good public image does not preclude someone from committing heinous acts against individuals, it actually enables them in many cases. Look at Bill Cosby, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Dad‚Äù.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA of firearm owned. Magazines and other gun parts are not ‚Äúarms‚Äù either in the historical or conventional sense. As an originalist, Justice Scalia would undoubtedly support that interpretation.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Because I can read and think. The decision in Heller was very clear in that the state and federal government cannot dictate in what state you possess a firearm within your own home. However, there is no question that there can be limitations to the type...1/2
@realDonaldTrump His accusations against you were true by your own admission...ü§î
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I agree with Justice Scalia‚Äôs interpretation of the 2nd Amendment from Heller v. DC.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I practice Constitutional law, but thanks for your insight.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Doesn‚Äôt matter how I, or you, feel about eminent domain, it happens regardless. Hence ‚Äúeminent‚Äù. We have the mag limit too. We just ignore it. Most of the Sherrifs in the State refused to enforce it.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Sure. I don‚Äôt NEED them. I like them, but they‚Äôre just for fun. I‚Äôd need to be reimbursed of course.
@uttppROD It‚Äôs only appropriate if the accusations are false. That‚Äôs what leads me to question the entire situation. While the details from the accusers, to the public‚Äôs general knowledge, appear vague, the accused seems hesitant to bring suit. Why?
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Oh the dread! I live in a state where I can legally open carry or carry concealed, own fully automatic firearms, and have a ‚ÄúMake My Day‚Äù law. How restrictive! GTFOH whack job. Btw, how are you ‚Äúfighting‚Äù? Twitter warrior üòÇ https://t.co/f8SOhjN07B
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA And can I still buy a 20 round mag in almost any gun store in CO? Absolutely. Take off your tin foil hat. Like I said, when we‚Äôve got legislation introduced, I‚Äôll take action. But I‚Äôm not giving money to the @NRA. Take care.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Good luck with that.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Also, I have a shotgun in my office. We have open carry here in Colorado. Much like with marijuana laws, our state would ignore federal law if it impeded our right to carry weapons.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA This is a stupid conversation. Is no legislation introduced to restrict our ability to own firearms. I‚Äôll worry about it when it‚Äôs a problem. I‚Äôm certainly not giving one damn dime to the @NRA to pay for asshole politicians with an A rating and F-level intelligence. Take care.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA By out in the boonies do you mean a location where the majority of the population owns firearms and there are high levels of crime due to opioid addiction? Oh yeah, and bears.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I can and have protected myself with a shotgun.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Lol. I‚Äôve got no problems. I‚Äôve got a very definite line: I don‚Äôt care about handguns and semi automatic rifles, but come after my hunting weapons and we‚Äôll have a problem.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I own 6 ARs.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I use my .243 for small game. The fact is even Scalia recognized the right of the federal government to restrict access to certain kinds of firearms for the protection of the public. Until some insane person starts trying to ban hunting rifles and shotguns, I‚Äôm out.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Who exactly is calling to ban hunting weapons? And no, AR platforms are not hunting weapons.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA It‚Äôs called bow hunting. I get an elk, deer, and antelope almost every year with my bow.
@NRA I bow hunt too.
@KatrinaPierson @ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr Or, someone being falsely accused would immediately bring a defamation suit against their accusers...you know, if they were innocent.
@BetoORourke Don‚Äôt chase him out of restaurants, vote him out of office.

@cologop @jaredpolis https://t.co/h3VinIBE7G
@Devildorff @uttppROD I would bring a defamation suit against my accusers. That‚Äôs what an innocent person would do.
@uttppROD What I find interesting is that all of these guys deny the claims yet not one has brought a defamation suit against their accusers. That would be step 1 for an innocent person.
@AntonioSabatoJr @realDonaldTrump JFC, did he really say some dumb shit like that? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@kayleighmcenany Well, they are investigating Ellison. Let‚Äôs do the same with Kavanaugh.

@jeffhunt @PolisForCO If he‚Äôd have shot her in commission of a crime in his place of business after she assaulted him, he‚Äôd probably have gotten an A rating from the NRA and stolen some @GOP votes.
@DLoesch Sure. The difference is we have a say (vote) about whether Beto takes office for 6 years whereas 100 people get to decide if Kavanaugh gets a lifetime, and infinitely more influential, appointment.

@cjcatz4618 @staceydash ‚ÄúIf‚Äù. And yes, I have a law degree. Due Process would be applicable IF Kavanaugh experienced any loss or was deprived of the right to Due Process. None of those things have happened. Stop being insane. It‚Äôs a delay, not a withdrawal of the nomination. Goodbye.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash Unlike you, I‚Äôve read the Constitution and studied law. Quoting something you don‚Äôt understand does not strengthen your argument. How would delaying the confirmation to investigate these claims deprive Kavanaugh of anything? This does not involved due process, there‚Äôs no charges.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash You can‚Äôt simply imply ‚Äúrights‚Äù when you don‚Äôt like a process. That‚Äôs not how rights work, they are extremely specific. Your reference to Feinstein‚Äôs letter, if false as you claim, would fall under protection by laws (libel, false accusations), not the BOR.
What? Undeniable that there will be only one opinion on something that will happen in the future? https://t.co/OuUp092RjH

@GeorgePapa19 Look who wants to be a part of things now...
@Jim_Jordan Never forget, our @POTUS cheated on multiple wives, bragged about groping women, lied about paying off a porn star, looted our coffers to give the ultra-rich a tax break, and lies ALL the time. And almost everyone in the @GOP is complicit.
@charliekirk11 Ellison is under investigation.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash The Equal Protection Clause? How does that apply to this scenario? No legal action is being taken against Kavanaugh. Simply asking for an investigation and delay of confirmation does not deprive him of any rights.
@senorrinhatch Yes, TIMING is the problem. FFS ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@AntonioSabatoJr How much longer until you lose your election and you can go back to being a D-list TV personality?
@staceydash Constitution is capitalized when referring to our specific Constitution. And exactly which portion of the Constitution are you referencing? Wait, was it just a buzzword?
@DanielRand34744 @NRA Right. Open public records are sooo much more questionable than unsupported claims by a partisan lobbying organization. üëç
@NRA I would LOVE to see your membership roles to see how many of the ‚Äú6 million‚Äù are: dead, felons, or gift memberships for people who are unaware of them. My guess: 20% or more.

@KatrinaPierson It‚Äôs so nice that you‚Äôre irrelevant.
@GOPChairwoman What‚Äôs wrong with eliminating private insurance? We can‚Äôt afford it anyway. Medicare is already administered by the federal government and is doomed. The $32 billion figure depends on current costs. In reality, single payer would drive down costs exponentially.

@KatrinaPierson Riiiiggghhhttt..... https://t.co/n51gD8wuYV
@realDonaldTrump Probably because the @GOP is trying to continue to rush the confirmation. By not involving the @FBI, they can keep the matter as a ‚Äúhe said, she said‚Äù incident rather the allowing the FBI to interview multiple witnesses and formally investigate what happened.
@GOPChairwoman Yes, the problem is how the information came to light, not the information itself. üôÑ

@DarkDanian @MagnusonThad @staceydash If you can‚Äôt have a discussion without mentioning political party, you‚Äôve got a weak argument. Poverty in the US is not created by politics.

@mvpschief @NRA @OliverLNorth This whole debate is ridiculous. You can be pro-2A and anti-@NRA. I own dozens of firearms and have been a lifelong hunter.

WTF?!?! https://t.co/yvuVGmAiDT
@JamesHoulihan @SeemaCMS Look who‚Äôs still creeping. Hadn‚Äôt heard from you in a while. Our rising healthcare costs cannot be solved by a fractured system. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries are too powerful to be opposed by anything other than the government.
@SeemaCMS Really? Or would it help drive down administrative, procedural, and pharmaceutical costs which would increase savings?
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump You shouldn‚Äôt refer folks to a dictionary when you obviously don‚Äôt understand the words you are using. @realDonaldTrump is ‚Äúelite‚Äù and a Republican cutting taxes to benefit the rich is ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù.

@GOP Being at full employment with stagnant wage growth is not a good economic indicator. It shows the truth: the rich have gotten richer from the tax cuts and the rest of us are staying about even (inflation eating our ‚Äútax savings‚Äù). The recession is going to hit hard next year 1/2

@uttppROD People seem to be losing their shit over it. It‚Äôs ridiculous.
@uttppROD So why is this an issue?
@uttppROD If anyone makes any move to outlaw kneeling before the flag, I would certainly begin doing so openly and proudly as a true American standing against oppression. Until that day, the whole point is moot as it‚Äôs just a bunch of people bitching about a nonstarter.
@uttppROD Define ‚Äúrespect‚Äù. I‚Äôd certainly kneel before the flag if it served my purpose in protesting an injustice. I‚Äôm not sure what situation would call for that, but I put the Constitution before any symbol.
@uttppROD I didn‚Äôt ever say I‚Äôd leave, but I support people‚Äôs right to express themselves and protest. I don‚Äôt give a shit about Hollywood movies misrepresenting history because I read and study history. Should I be ‚Äúmoved out‚Äù then?
@uttppROD that‚Äôs a different story.
@uttppROD The root of the issue is that it is only an opinion that people are ‚Äúdisrespecting‚Äù the flag. Even if it is disrespectful, the right to expression and free speech certainly supersede any unwritten guidelines about a symbol. If their employer forbids it during work hours,...
@uttppROD How so?
@uttppROD So the quasi-threats to people who don‚Äôt concur with your view of the American flag are...? Fact that it is a symbol means it does not actually represent our country. That‚Äôs why we have a constitution.
@uttppROD So you don‚Äôt believe in the right to freedom of expression?

@uttppROD What‚Äôs wrong with sex if both parties are approaching it safely and consensually?
@uttppROD Since the dawn of time, the attempts to enforce abstinence have been entirely futile. Teaching people about the consequences of sex, on the other hand, and giving them access to birth control has produced measurable results.
@charliekirk11 Are you confused about how abortion funding works? It‚Äôs not funded by the feds (Title X), it‚Äôs funded by donations and private pay. So any money you pay for abortion is your choice.

@GOP By focusing only on Americans murdered by illegal immigrants, which is a minuscule portion of all homicides, you are putting illegal aliens in front of American citizens by diverting the resources needed to solve the 48 murders each day in the US.

@charliekirk11 Or...we should just defund that line item and they can pay them out themselves.
@diffinleslie @RandPaul Sorry, cancer screenings and pelivic exams. Also HIV testing and prenatal services. These are all services funded by Title X.

@diffinleslie @RandPaul Can you not read? Removing Title X funding does not make abortion illegal. It simply defunds women‚Äôs health clinics and limits their ability to do regular preventative care like mammograms and offering birth control. Abortions will still happen as they are funded by donations.
@RoderickThreats When there are millions of people like that, it‚Äôs a cultural issue, not a random or sporadic occurrence. Change the terminology if you like, but it‚Äôs something that has to be addressed beyond the confines of the home.
@RoderickThreats I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs ‚Äúfaux‚Äù when courts let rapists like Brock Turner off with a slap on the wrist, high-profile actors molest women for years with no consequences, and a man who brags about groping women against their will becomes President.

@RandPaul Well @RandPaul, as you well know, Title X funds, those you are attempting to cut, cannot be used for abortions. Abortions are funded privately or through donations. You are trying to defund one of the largest providers of women‚Äôs reproductive health care.

@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Seriously? I tried to ask for information to support your position and you give me a quote about how science is flawed? Goodbye.
@whatsyourtheory @RoderickThreats What blows my mind is how people are just figuring this out now. Growing up on the farm, my mom always said to be careful with the RoundUp, it‚Äôll give you cancer. Hell, it gives plants cancer in a day or two, it can‚Äôt be good to get on your skin. #CommonSenseNotSoCommon
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Bitching about it doesn‚Äôt fix the problem. Nobody is doing anything to help. The current plan is to make it worse just to try and repeal the ACA with no feasible replacement.
@realDonaldTrump We were great. We might be great again once you‚Äôre out of office. It‚Äôs going to take a lot of work to repair the damage you‚Äôve done.
@dvorakoelling He‚Äôs 100% reactionary and has no foresight whatsoever. He plays for short-term results to keep his supporters happy. The long-term effects of his policies are going to be devastating. I think the plan this whole time was just to increase his family wealth as much as possible.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Medical results are facts. Manipulating statistics to fit your narrative is not. Why don‚Äôt you provide me a link to your data and I‚Äôll have a look at it? I‚Äôd be interested to see their methodology and where they draw their data from.
@EricTrump So you hate your dad? Sad.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS I‚Äôm well aware of what safety data is (besides a buzz word anti-vac advocates use). As I said before, the facts are that mortality rates for numerous deadly diseases dropped to almost zero post widespread vaccine use. But feel free to not vaccinate YOUR kids and homeschool them.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS The ‚Äúsafety data‚Äù is, after the use of vaccines became standardized, millions of people stopped dying from preventable disease. It‚Äôs not some conspiracy. I‚Äôve seen these vaccines safe lives firsthand in third world countries. Go see a child dying of smallpox and then come preach.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS You‚Äôre going to try to say that there‚Äôs more evidence to harmful effects of vaccines than benefits? I may be sarcastic, but at least I‚Äôm grounded in reality. Take care.
@DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Polio can present as transverse myelitis. Polio is a disease, transverse myelitis is a symptom. There have been no cases of polio originating in the US since the early 1980s due 100% to...vaccines.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS If vaccines killed anyone, that would be a sad thing. However, vaccines safe exponentially more lives than they harm. That is a fact.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity So he‚Äôs admitting the truth about your Administration? I‚Äôm surprised he was able to handle the transition back into reality.
@DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt it be sweet if polio became a thing again? Or measles? Measles were awesome! Let‚Äôs get back to the days when 1 out of 10 babies died from preventable disease.

@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Are you going to keep playing dumb? My comment was in regards to President Trump and his disrespect for the constitution. You then asked about President Obama which has no bearing on President Trump‚Äôs actions. I‚Äôm done with you. Take care.
@RoderickThreats Voting in local elections Falls to municipalities and states. I strongly believe in states rights, so I support their ability to make this decision. I would not support it at the federal level.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO What question did I not answer? I stated that I believe that all presidents have disrespected the constitution. You try to deflect from President Trump to President Obama. President Obama is no longer in power. Please make relevant comments or go away.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Please stop trying to deflect, it‚Äôs pathetic. But to be clear, I believe every president has pushed the bounds of their powers with regard to the constitution. In my mind, that constitutes disrespect.
@RoderickThreats Who has outwardly advocated to allow illegal immigrants to vote?
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO I studied constitutional law, how about you? The powers of the president have always been highly debated and are not clearly delineated in the constitution. Executive powers have generally been unquestioned in areas regarded as ‚Äúnational security‚Äú. I trust no president completely
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Lol. Cute. You‚Äôre mistaken if you think anyone is safe under a POTUS who has no respect for the rule of law or the Constitution. Also, simply attacking ALL liberals is not a debate, it‚Äôs propaganda. If you want to attack an idea or certain people, call it/them out directly.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Ridiculous attempts to vilify entire populations typically result in punitive actions against the minority.
@RoderickThreats So not really much of an issue then. Illegal immigrants try to avoid detection. Trying to vote illegally would probably not help with that.
@RoderickThreats And how many confirmed cases of voter fraud were there in the last election? Of those, how many were illegal immigrants attempting to vote?
@RealCandaceO @GaviShapiro Right. You should make them wear something that distinguishes them from the true #MAGA patriots and make them all live in the same place so they‚Äôre easier to track.
@realDonaldTrump You know it‚Äôs a bad sign when @realDonaldTrump uses the word ‚Äúmerely‚Äù when discussing something he participated in.

Have you ever noticed that anyone who ends their Tweet with #MAGA is an idiot?
@charliekirk11 Right. Because ‚Äúthe people‚Äù control the government. Sure, we elect our representatives, but they act solely in their own interest. Hell, the SCOTUS Justices are appointed, no vote at all.

@parscale Really? Because consumers are the ones who lose in this trade war. Pretty much cancels out any gains we received from tax reform. Low unemployment and a trade war is going to lead to major inflation.
