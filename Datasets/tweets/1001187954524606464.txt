@kathy4united This corruption everywhere but that's why you have a shop steward and that's why you go to Union meetings you definitely have a voice with the Union just got to know how to do it
@kathy4united All you care about you and you lose but you pay extra taxes for illegals to come in this country though everybody's priorities are in the garbage can I rather pay dues and make sure my job is secure and I've been in the union for many years and and now I'm retired with a pension
@kathy4united You have a pension and a good medical plan with the Union what do you get with a right-to-work state a 401k that you pay into I rather Paid Dues and know that my job is secure
@kathy4united I'll see you don't understand Union is job security that means that if your boss has a hair up his ass one day he can fire you if you're in the union they can't do that so obviously have to explain it to you like a baby
@kathy4united Yeah if your communist you want to keep it a right to work state so nobody has rights do you even know what a right to work state means
@Alyssa_Milano I think you should Channel your focus on other things like how American people don't have proper Health Care majority of our veterans are homeless we need better border security those are the things you need to focus on
@AOC By the way stop and think before you open that thing you call a mouth
@AOC Won't you stop the city from stealing cars from people that old tickets do you know that theft the city's been stealing from their people for years. stop the chaos in New York City

@FOX13News I think you mean it's the Democrats fault
If you go to American Embassy in your country and apply you will not be able to enter the country until you go through the proper steps through the US Embassy
Using our embassies overseas for illegals to apply for citizenship or green card no visas.
We should use our embassies for our advantage it's simple you want to be an American citizen or hold a green card you need to go to an American Embassy in your country and apply you will have to learn the American culture and our language before entering our country

@marcorubio And if you come here illegally with your child for the first time you are band for 10 years so is your child and if you get caught the second time you will be in prison for 10 years and your child will be put up for adoption
@marcorubio if you're here illegally and have a child your child will not be an American citizen it will be Null and void and you will be deported with your child
@marcorubio  https://t.co/DqrPqU0XTF
@marcorubio And if you get caught coming into the country illegally you are banned for 10 years and if you get caught the second time you will be in prison for 10 years wake up America
@marcorubio Why can't we use our embassies to work for us you want to come to the US go to the Embassy in your country and apply for citizenship not allowed to come into the country until you get the okay by the embassy in your country

@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump you need to reevaluate your game plan cuz what you're doing is not working maybe if you grow some balls that's a start
@marcorubio Marco Rubio you're going to hell
@realDonaldTrump Why can't we use our embassies to deal with the immigration problems Embassy should be used for a intake to apply for green cards for citizenship. You will not be able to enter United States without a green card from our Embassy in that person's country
@firemandon68 @FOX13News What's the definition of insanity doing the same thing day in and day out and expecting different results that's what we've been dealing with for centuries with these wealthy politicians they don't know our pain
@firemandon68 @FOX13News Sorry to say but I believe that Trump will not make it to 2020 you can't run the country like it was Trump Towers
@CNN I have nothing against the elderly but when you get to a certain age it is time to retire this guy is senile and old he just called Trump Obama he doesn't even know who's president right now this is what the Democrats are working with

We are varying away from the truth what about us there are people dying every day from Hunger and the elderly dying because they can't pay for the medication we are going down the wrong path
@realDonaldTrump Obviously you're never did hard labor in your life so what is fixing it to you putting a Band-Aid on it and call it victory we're going down the wrong path
@realDonaldTrump when are you going to worry about the American people we need a good health care System you need to raise wages and some states people can survive on what they're making what happened to us it's all about you and your agenda that doesn't pay the bills
@realDonaldTrump @PeteStauber Trump I have a question you worried about the embassy in Israel to be built do you know there's people starving and dying every day in our country because we have no Health Care
