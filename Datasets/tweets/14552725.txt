It’s always amazing to me that @realDonaldTrump continues to insist that when immigrants come into the United States they are “sent” by their home countries. “They are not giving us their best people.” That’s not how immigration works. People mostly leave on their own.
If there was any doubt that @realDonaldTrump will make immigration and the border and the wall a centerpiece of his campaign, just listen to this speech at CPAC. He’s been on a long rant against murders, drug dealers and rapists for a while now.
@realDonaldTrump laments that his criticism of the green new deal might have talked Democrats out of running on it. "This speech should have been delivered one year from now rather than now, dammit!”
@realDonaldTrump tells story of having to turn off lights on AF1 for security reasons when landing in Iraq. "We spent 7 trillion in the Middle East. And we can't land a plane with the lights on. How bad is that? No seriously, how bad is it?
@realDonaldTrump says that Gavin Newsom, new CA gov, called him a few weeks ago and said he was a great president and doing a great job. Said Trump was smartest ever.  Trump said: “He'll deny it. But check the phone records. Everyone else does!"

Good point. Wonder whether it will go unmentioned. https://t.co/Z5BnPyFrBt
Think @realDonaldTrump has gotten over having smaller crowd size than @BarackObama during his inauguration? Nope. At #CPAC2019 he is once again on a long diatribe about how his crowd was actually bigger. Still obsessed. “I care,” he insists.
@realDonaldTrump, 2019: 		"One of the great inventions in history. It's called Tivo.”		Date Tivo invented (incorporated): 		August 4, 1997
@realDonaldTrump about the effort to investigate him: “All off a sudden they are trying to take you out with bullshit."
@realDonaldTrump loves his clever phrases.		So far today: 		“Little Shifty Schiff.”		“Collusion Delusion.”
Days after Michael Cohen said that he heard Roger Stone tell @realDonaldTrump that Wikileaks would dump Clinton emails, the president tells CPAC that his famous rally plea to Russia to find Hillary emails was … just a joke.

Tomorrow, the Sunday shows will be filled with calls for Northam to resign. But if he doesn't resign before Monday, Richmond will be a huge circus -- the legislature is in session and it's hard to see how he just goes on as if nothing happened.
This. https://t.co/UBxWsBqit3
@Mattaponi280 Yes they have. About an hour ago.
@ericgeller Yeah. Terrible. Though in our defense, that doesn’t begin to capture the seriousness with which the paper took it. I literally wrote dozens of stories on the front page during the campaign.
Great panel. (Especially J-mart. No one knows more about Virginia politics.) https://t.co/6E84LwWpuP
Historical Context: Here is the initial story about George Allen’s “maccaca” comments. https://t.co/X7xCMYDu09
As a political strategy, Northam clearly hoped that today’s press conference would stem the time of calls for his resignation and give him space to recover. That has clearly failed. Instead, calls for him to go have accelerated.
The pressure increases. The first African American governor of Virginia changes his tune and calls for Northam to go. https://t.co/7Gz0GNMlKc
Inevitable that @realDonaldTrump would weigh in on this. Hard to know whether this helps Northam or hurts him. But it may not matter, given the weight of the Democrats already calling for Northam to resign. https://t.co/CL212UeLhT
The last time a Virginia politician so badly mishandled racial accusations was senator George Allen responding to video of him calling an Indian-American young man “Maccaca.” Allen lost re-election. No one I’ve talked to today in either party thinks this is survivable for Northam
@jonathanweisman I dont think I agree. This appears to have been his personal page, not just a page in the yearbook with random photos. So seems to me that its existence is news. But I do agree, as I said, that there are lots of questions.
The big question: is Northam one of the two people in this picture? Either in blackface or in a KKK robe? Assuming this is real and hasn’t been doctored, I t’s damaging enough that the picture is on his yearbook page. But if its him in the picture... https://t.co/AdMDrCRCnt

This comment from @realDonaldTrump in a tweet this morning is exactly why his most conservative base is afraid of comprehensive immigration reform: “Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else.”
@JohnKingCNN @elianayjohnson @seungminkim @Phil_Mattingly Looking forward to the show. See you tomorrow, John.
The deal ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ offered Sat “pleased neither the Democratic congressional leaders whose buy-in he needs...nor the core supporters whose backing has always been at the heart of his insistence on a border wall,” writes ⁦@juliehdavis⁩  https://t.co/uJ56GOww79
Speaker says House will counter with their own border security package. https://t.co/ZgkTFroPme
@DLind It's certainly possible that SCOTUS could set for argument and decide earlier. But a case like this, with so much riding on it, would very likely be argued later in the term and decided near the end. Either way, it's a long way off.
The conservative reaction is ratcheting up. Here's https://t.co/X1Hv5cJ6hJ's new headline: Three Year Amnesty, Most of the Border Remains Open https://t.co/5KWa2CLcDM
@seungminkim @newman_chris Yes, you're right. I forgot that not all qualified. But the broader point is still true: the 2013 deal was much bigger than what's on the table now.
@newman_chris Ok, point taken, Chris. I was using shorthand. There were definitely exceptions and you're right that some wouldn't have qualified. But millions would have, and my point is that the deal on the table now is much smaller.
One big development in the last 24 hours was the Supreme Court deciding not to take the DACA case. Trump has said he was waiting for the court to uphold his decision to terminate DACA. Now, looks like that leverage gone until at least summer, 2020.
Worth remembering: It was only five years ago that the offer on the table in the Senate was a pathway to citizenship for 11 MILLION immigrants, not just DACA / TPS recipients. Democrats remember, and seem unlikely to cave for so much less now.
Remember "Amnesty Don"? That was what conservatives called @realDonaldTrump the last time he contemplated a deal like this. Here's the email I just got from the Heritage Foundation. It begins again. https://t.co/GVBenSlZb8

So, the border wall advocates are angry at Trump; the hardliners who want to cut legal immigration won't be happy; the Democrats say the protections for DACA/TPS are too weak and they still hate the wall. Not clear that this is the way out of shutdown. But dynamics are fluid. https://t.co/miW1JahDCL
Trump appears ready to offer a deal, says @anniekarni. But will it work? Dems say they still want government open before negotiations begin. https://t.co/0udaOeFQcJ
@DanaPerino But it all depends on the details. Is it permanent relief for TPS? Or just another temporary extension? Is it one-time extension for DACA? Only for those who applied? What about the ones who qualified but didn’t apply? Are there other provisions? Chain migration? Visa lottery?

@jonathanvswan @samstein Hey Jonathan, you didn’t get any timing out of him, right? Like when he intends to try to do this?
@samstein I agree with this. I have talked to so many conservatives who blasted Obama for an abuse of power by attempting to “legalize” 5 million illegal immigrants with an executive order. You would think that using an EO to wipe away an amendment would be even more offensive to them.
@samstein Not sure what you mean, Sam. True, any coverage of this should include the obvious analysis that it’s not at all clear how he could do this. But you’re not actually asserting that his declaration of intent is not a story, and should be ignored, right?
The 14th amendment is pretty clear: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” But @realDonaldTrump wants the political  and legal fight if nothing else.
CLOSING ARGUMENT: Build tent cities for migrants. End birthright citizenship. Fear the caravan. Send active-duty troops to the border. Refuse asylum. If you ever doubted that immigration is the animating force of the @realDonaldTrump presidency, just look at the last few weeks.
ALERT: @realDonaldTrump tells Axios he plans an executive order ending birthright citizenship for babies born in the US to non-citizens and illegal immigrants. How he thinks he can sign away a right conferred by the 14th amendment is unclear. Legal fight is guaranteed if he does
Court orders prohibit the government from indefinitely holding children and families -- many of whom are in the migrant caravan. Yet @realDonaldTrump appears determined to keep all migrants in vast "tent cities." Not clear if he intends to ignore the courts.
On Fox News, @realDonaldTrump vows to build vast "tent cities" along the southern border to indefinitely hold anyone who seeks asylum in the United States. "We are going to put tents up all over the place," the president says.
“There is no invasion.” Fox News anchor disputes ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ claims about the migrant caravan as the president orders thousands of active duty troops to the border a week before Election Day. “It’s troops as props,” a former Army officer says. https://t.co/jOv3QXci4e

Senator Collins has said she will announce her decision on final passage at 3 pm today. If she were to flip, Kavanaugh would still be confirmed unless someone else did, too. That would put lots of pressure on Dem. Sen. Manchin, who would become the deciding vote for Kavanaugh.
With a 51-49 vote, Kavanaugh nomination moves to final passage. In order for there to be a different result, two senators would have to change their mind before Saturday’s vote.

So far, the camera has been glued (appropriately) to Kavanaugh. But soon, we will see how the Democrats and Republicans on the committee handle the questioning. It will be a fascinating test of a situation that few have any experience with.
In a city where true emotion is often completely covered over by political artifice, the testimony of Dr. Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh has been a remarkable departure, and a reminder that Washington combat involves real people.
The most memorable angry moment was this: "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace...you have replaced advice and consent with search and destroy."
The most memorable tearful moment of this testimony has been Brett Kavanaugh relating his 10 year old saying they should pray for "the woman." Kavanaugh noted: "It's a lot of wisdom for a 10 year old." That was when he started to cry. He has continued to cry since.
@jackiekcalmes I watched it. And yes, that would qualify as one of the most riveting too. But this is amazing.
I've been here in Washington for 26 years and I just can't remember a day like this. It has been one of the most riveting displays of testimony on Capitol Hill in modern times.
Wow. Just minutes into his statement, and its clear that Brett Kavanaugh is delivering one of the most remarkable public statements in a long time. He's clearly furious and willing to say it.

@ai002h Well, I was relating the theory of a conservative I talked to. I think he would say that in the eyes of voters in deep red states, a vote by a democratic senator to reject a trump SCOTUS nominee could be seen as going “hard left.” That’s his notion.

What are the implications of @realDonaldTrump blowing up the G7 joint statement? Can negotiators for the US represent they are empowered to cut deals on behalf of the president? NAFTA? North Korea? The long-term questions are profound, I think.
The thing is, I was at the @JustinTrudeau news conference, and he went out of his way to try to downplay tensions. He didn’t attack @realDonaldTrump in any way, other than restate Canada would retaliate for tariffs. Not sure what @larry_kudlow means re: “stabbed” US in the back

I really wonder what @realDonaldTrump will say (on Twitter) if the commentary about the strikes tonight is that they were much smaller — more like a pinprick — than people expected.
The rhetoric of @realDonaldTrump often doesn’t match reality. In his remarks, he said: "We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.” In fact, the strikes tonight were very limited, and are already over.
Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, says @realDonaldTrump
Message to Russia and Iran: The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep, @realDonaldTrump says
We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of chemical weapons, says @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump says a “precision” attack on Syrian chemical weapon sites is underway

A little more on the @realDonaldTrump joke about whether Melania would leave the WH before Steve Miller.		He referenced #FreeMelania and at one point said: “She’s actually having a great time,” referring, I think, to being First Lady.
Maybe the most controversial joke by @realDonaldTrump tonight:		"I like turnover. I like chaos. It really is good.  Who is going to be the next to leave? Steve Miller or Melania?”		He did turn to his wife, who was in the audience, and ask if she still loved him.
I’m also not sure which was funnier: That @realDonaldTrump jokingly claimed credit for the large crowds at the Winter Olympics, or that he closed by saying, seriously: “I want to thank the press for all you do to support and sustain our democracy.”
This may be my favorite of @realDonaldTrump’s jokes at the Gridiron. He said that he had offered Jeff Sessions a ride to the dinner, but that Sessions had “recused himself.” #gridiron
@realDonaldTrump took a shot at the recently retired publisher of the Times, Arthur Sulzberger. “I inherited millions.  Arthur inherited billions of dollars and he tuned it into millions.” #gridiron
Of Steve Bannon, @realDonaldTrump said: “He leaked more than the Titanic.” #gridiron
@realDonaldTrump joked that he was late to the Gridiron Dinner because Jared had trouble going through security #gridiron

Wow. @realDonaldTrump goes hard after @SenJohnMcCain for his health care vote. Remarkable criticism of a man struggling for his life with cancer.
Not clear what he means by “comprehensive” background checks. If that were “universal background checks,” with no gun-show loophole, it would be a major shift. But if he’s just talking about better data for existing check system, it’s less dramatic. https://t.co/Hv7YjdvFis

The @WhiteHouse has not said anything about whether @realDonaldTrump might still go down to Mar-a-Lago tomorrow (he's got a big RNC fundraiser scheduled in Florida.) All we know is that he won't head down today, as had been planned.
Also -- with there be more "tough" language in the Oval today? If so, that could derail any deal that might otherwise emerge.
One big question: Will @realDonaldTrump have Stephen Miller, his hard-line immigration / domestic policy adviser, and his chief of staff, John Kelly,  in the Oval with @SenSchumer? They usually bolster POTUS's hard-line tendencies.
Pictures show that @SenSchumer is already in the Oval Office with @realDonaldTrump. (with Marc Short, the president's legislative director, there too.) The balance of this day will be shaped by what happens in the next hour or so.
If that holds, such a meeting is likely to cause conservatives to pull their hair out, worrying about what @realDonaldTrump might agree to at this very high-stakes moment for both parties.
Am told that the meeting with the president is supposed to be just @realDonaldTrump and @SenSchumer — a one-on-one between the two of them.

@maggieNYT That was a good one, Maggie. But I kinda preferred when he said Democrats “don’t want to help the DACA people.”
“No. I’m not a racist.” Here’s my story on @realDonaldTrump’s brief comments to the press pool tonight. https://t.co/sKPqlEaITF
I also asked about DACA sticking points: “They are all Democrat sticking points...we are ready willing and able to make a deal, but they don’t want to...they don’t want security at the border, they don’t want to stop the drugs...they want to take money away from our military.”
@gregorykorte @realDonaldTrump You know it!
I asked @realDonaldTrump whether the comments he made about Africa and Haiti would make it harder to get a DSACA deal. His answer: "Did you see what various senators in the room said about my comments? They were not made."
@PressSec Ok. That is a problem. Though if I remember those days correctly, I think there could be worse things that a two-year-old might yell. And then imagine what Alexa might deliver. Count yourself lucky!
@OnThisDayNYT There are definitely some stories that I wish I had written. This is definitely one of them.
@TonyFratto Apparently, if you lived in Hawaii today it wouldn’t be that hard to fathom.

This is a very careful statement by @GrahamBlog that stops just short of confirming the president’s words. I suspect it will not be enough and reporters will rightly keep asking him the question about what was said until he answers directly. https://t.co/NOaWUsefzf
@jaketapper This is exactly how we reported the meeting, too. The remarks about Haiti involved the president not wanting to include them in a deal. The comment about “shithole countries” and a desire for people from Norway was in reference to African nations.
Not 100 percent sure I understand this. After the White House steadfastly refused to deny that he made the “shithole” comment, is he now denying that he said it? https://t.co/KQGiQwNT4S

@ZweedenEddie @WhiteHouse @juliehdavis @realDonaldTrump You don’t think that some of these statistics might be affected by an earthquake that killed 220,000 people, injured another 300,000 and displaced 1.5 million? Not wishing such a thing on Norway, but that would make a difference, no?
@ZweedenEddie @WhiteHouse @juliehdavis @realDonaldTrump And these statistics mean what, exactly?

The @WhiteHouse denied the “Haitians have AIDS” story that I wrote with @juliehdavis. They have not denied today’s “shithole” story. The difference? @realDonaldTrump made the AIDS comment to his own staff; the “shithole” comments were to others he doesn’t control.

And even more interesting is the potential political impact -- if courts order the DACA program to be started up again, does that take pressure off Republicans to act legislatively? What do Democrats do?
It's not clear what the legal impact could be, but at least on its face, we could be headed for more intense legal wrangling like the kind that happened in the wake of the president's travel bans.

The danger for Democrats is that their takeaway from tonight is that they can simply be anti-Trump and be guaranteed victory. Candidates still need a message.
The key part about this tweet that is wrong is the part where he says “or what I stand for.” Gillespie tried to embrace Trumpism without embracing Trump. It didn’t work. https://t.co/aJ1W7BmgsD
And there’s the @realDonaldTrump response — just what I thought it would be: downplaying his connection to Gillespie.
Uber-conservative GOP delegates Bob Marshall and Scott Lingamfelter — both from exurbs outside DC — were swamped by anti-Trump sentiment wave tonight. The House will be far different after this.
Tonight is also the starting gun on the 2018 midterms. Now that the off-year races are over, all eyes will be on how the rest of the country assesses the @realDonaldTrump presidency.
What will @realDonaldTrump say? Maybe note that he didn’t campaign very hard for Gillespie?
Virginia proves immune to Trump-style appeals. The @nytimes story on the #vagov race, by @jmartNYT and @alexburnsNYT.
This is also a victory for Va. Democratic establishment, all of whom backed Northam over the progressive favorite, Tom Perriello. Some questioned that choice, but seems to have paid off
Is Virginia really still purple? Northam wins mean that last five gubernatorial elections have seen four Democratic victories and one (Bob McDonnell) Republican victory. Combine that with US Senate victories, and its probably time to just call it blue.
Chesterfield is the big indicator here. Dems usually lose there big. Northam is within striking distance and could end up winning. Don’t need to see anything else to know how badly Gillespie lost.
Not sure it’s a huge surprise that an ex-Washington lobbyist who was in Bush’s WH doesn’t really connect with Trump voters. He won in Trump country, but not by overly huge margins.
AP calls it for Northam
If Northam wins big, it will cement Virginia as one of the biggest anti-Trump states. It voted against him in 16 despite the rest of the south going the other way.
According to the @nytimes site, Northam is leading in 9 of the largest 12 counties or cities in VA. Some by very wide margins.
Bob Marshall has been a controversial and divisive fixture of politics in Richmond for a long time. If he loses tonight (as seems likely) it would be a big blow to the anti-abortion activists in the state.
To be fair, though, there’s still a fair number of rural counties with only one or two precincts reporting. That will add some to Gillespie’s total.
Henrico Co. (outside of Richmond) used to be the ultimate bastion of establishment Republicans (like Gillespie.) Now, Gillespie is losing it 62-37 with about 2/3 reporting.
If Gillespie loses, @realDonaldTrump will be angry, on the other side of the planet. Will be interesting to see what his (Twitter) reaction could be.
Gillespie’s (and GOP’s) basic challenge: He wins Carroll Co. 70%-30%. But only about 7,000 people vote there. He could lose Fairfax by same margin. Could be 300,000 people voting there.
When places like Caroline County, Prince Edward County, Brunswick County and Greensville County go for the Democrat, it’s a good night for that party in Va. Not done yet, but all have most precincts in, and Northam is leading.
You never know what could happen, but most of Northam’s vote in NOVA and Henrico isn’t in yet, while some of Gillespie’s big counties are 3/4 in. That could foreshadow a big night for Northam. #vagov
@maggieNYT But now 4 can be four; &amp; can be and; and w/ can once again be with. I just want to say (for real): oh my god!

@realDonaldTrump wanted to “lift the cloud” about reports that he had “been involved with hookers in Russia.” Told Comey that he had not.
It’s hard to read Comey statement and not come away struck by the repeated intervention by @potus into an ongoing FBI investigation.
What to make of this from Comey: @potus: “we had that thing you know.” Comey: “I did not reply or ask him what he meant by “that thing.”
Comey response to “loyalty”: I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed.”
Comey statement is remarkable, even though much of it already reported by @nytmike and others. @potus: “I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.”

@danpfeiffer @grilodan And that is still the question. But tweet said story about how he plans to leave. Questions about divestiture remain
@danpfeiffer I agree that the tweets are important, and increasingly viewed through intense, ideological lenses. People see what they want
@danpfeiffer @grilodan not comparing that. But you can't say that leaving a company is meaningless if you have a stake in it.
@grilodan @danpfeiffer then why do we often write big stories about ceos leaving companies they found, while keeping their stakes?

In terms of winning Va in the fall, acquiring @timkaine means getting the strategist who knows Va. best: Mike Henry, Kaine’s chief of staff
Another admission. Many years ago, I would have bet money that @MarkWarnerVA would be first Dem. Va. gov on a nat’l ticket. @kevindalehall

RT @benpershing: Friday Night Jamboree at Floyd Country Store is also a good campaign stop. I have video of Kaine playing there. https://t.…
Keep in mind that when @timkaine talks about working across aisle, it's not that easy. Strong Va. GOP legislature often blocked his plans.
Former staffers to @timkaine all still hugely loyal to him. @delastarling @MoElleithee @kevindalehall @henry_mike. Mike Henry now Kaine COS
It's funny, though, because despite his success in Va., I don't think many people would have called @timkaine charismatic like Clinton.
For more on the political history of Va. that @timkaine talked about today, I recommend "Virginia in the Vanguard," by Frank B. Atkinson.
1 time @timkaine flubbed politically was 2006, when he appointed labor leader to cabinet. Made him look partisan. https://t.co/LlKaLtcnr8
Will be interesting to see how the GOP decides to attack @timkaine and what they use to try to undermine his schtick.
@timkaine just demonstrated what confounded Va. GOP for years. He mixes biting partisan rhetoric with an "Aw shucks" attitude that disarms.
Indeed! https://t.co/AnBzalruVm

This ad about Hitler from Kaine’s 05 opponent. Jerry Kilgore, backfired: https://t.co/2EQO44MXLi
In post-election analysis in 05, Pete Brodnitz, the Kaine pollster, also found that “Honesty and Integrity Were Top Qualities.”
Pollster for @timkaine in 2005 concluded he won VA Gov race in part because: “Focus on faith confounded GOP ‘liberal’ attack.”
At a roast of VA reporters in 2006, @timkaine joked that being a VP is “a tough job. Its easy to get lost in the mix as the number two guy”
One of biggest challenges for Kaine in 05 race: explaining opposition to the death penalty and trying to defend death row inmates as lawyer
Tim Kaine told me the week before he won the governor’s race in ’05 that he couldn’t imagine doing anything else in politics #thingschange

Obama likes Kanye West's music, but told Kimmel that he doesn't have the hip hop artist's home phone number. #ObamaKimmel
Obama appearance on ABC's Kimmel was embargoed until 11:35, but was lifted after ABC president @bensherwood broke the embargo with tweets.
Did Obama see Sean Penn portray iconic HS stoner in “Fast Times at Ridegmont High? “I lived it. I didn’t just see it." #ObamaKimmel
Why doesn't Obama drive anymore? "In Kenya, we drive on the other side of the street," he JOKED to Kimmel. #ObamaKimmel
Kimmel asked Obama whether he wanders around White House late at nigh in his underpants to get a sandwich. "I could. I don’t." #ObamaKimmel
Obama read Mean Tweets on Kimmel:"Fly Obama to some golf course halfway around the world and leave him there." Good idea, he said.
Kimmel introduced Obama as "The first Kenyan born, Muslim socialist president" Or as 1 reporter joked: the way Fox does it. #ObamaKimmel
Asked by Jimmy Kimmel if he has Hillary Clinton's email, Obama said: "i can’t share it with you." #ObamaKimmel
Obama said on Kimmel that his daughters are "doing all the things that the teenagers are doing." Kimmel's response: "Uh oh." #ObamaKimmel

Will there be "angst, discussion and hand-wringing" as GOP uses debt ceiling as leverage and Obama refuses to deal? http://t.co/v5ZXcejP
Obama had said, "I want a big deal." He didn't get one, as @DLeonhardt notes. But his agenda is moving ahead, slowly.  http://t.co/iuzL8dSU
WH just announced POTUS will return to Hawaii tonight. Was scheduled to be there until Jan 6. His family is still there.
Not sure that rallying cry works with many people. “@guycecil: Free the Capitol Press Corp and vote!”
Maybe in short term. But next election, Dems can claim to have pushed thru big tax cuts. “@NKingofDC: This is the Dem high water mark”
But is that political victory for GOP? Now Dems own popular tax cuts too. “@NKingofDC: Rs...gloating over making...Bush tax cuts permanent.
Here we go. They are reading the bill.

Rice’s decision to withdraw leaves a lot of questions to be answered: Who made the call? Will she get another job? (NSA?) Who gets State?
Obama calls Rice “extraordinarily capable, patriotic, and passionate public servant” and says she will continue as UN ambassador
Obama on Rice: I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice... her decision demonstrates the strength of her character
