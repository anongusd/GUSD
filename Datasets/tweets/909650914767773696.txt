Humans think we are the smartest species, but in reality we are the dumbest because we are DESTROYING EVERYTHING. Live on the Earth not off of it.
I've been an analyst for over 36 years. The US does not want a friendship with Russia, this President did. The DEEP STATE would never allow this. WHY. Its all about money and power. Corporations make huge amounts of money on the war machine. We must have an enemy.
With ALL the attention on President Trump..... Have we forgotten about Hillary and all her wrongs, including pay to play....emails....etc the list goes on and on and on.... corrupt....with all this nonsense directed at this GREAT President , he still will MAGA. 100% Guaranteed !!
The only thing this President is GUILTY of is trying to do too much good too quickly. In the end it will all come out PERFECT. Just WATCH......Sincerely John Henry Ruminski. The Best President EVER &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1437
Lets show some respect my fellow AMERICANS. We are talking about the President of this great country. The news needs to speak the truth. I have never seen any reports on the great things President Trump has done. Believe me he is 100% for this country doing great things.
The news outlets need to report the news. Instead they seem to report what they are told by their owners. For example The Washington Post owned by Amazon owner Jeff Bezos has direct influence on what is reported. This newspaper never says anything good about President Trump. WHY
