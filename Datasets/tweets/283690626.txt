Love often than being not.
We become numb if we allow to be numb by things that made us numb.
Forgive someone who makes mistakes because you also did mistakes and yet you are being forgiven by that person too.
We don't need fancy things to be in, we just need to be true to your self to be in with real people.
A true friend is there with you in your most worse days, not the ones you've just met and think she was more better because she makes you happy. We don't weigh people how many times they can make us happy but how many times they were there for you when you were nothing.
Never forget who was there with you from the beginning.
Don't flirt to someone else if your not happy anymore with your partner, instead remember how happy you were when you both fell in love.
The best gift you can give is to be honest more especially when your away from your partner.
The best break through we can do in our life is being selfless and love unconditionally.
Never judge someone by how mad they are but instead understand what they're going through.
Be inspiring to those who are un inspired.
If we always say life is unfair because we are unfair.
The most hated thing we do is where we have to accept we hurt someone badly and yet we only see our selves being hurt.

Never let someone beg for you. God didn't let us beg when we needed him.

Anything that hurts you teaches you to be strong.
Anything you hate is teaching you unconditonal love.
Anyone who abandons you is teaching you how to stand up on your own two feet.
Anything that annoys you is teaching you to be patient.
Love as hard as you can, and leave a mark that you will never be forgotten.
Life is worth living if you know how to value yourself first before anyone else.
We dont need to chase someone who doesn't want to be chased. Time is precious to waste effort for someone not valuable as your time.

I was hiding from a dark place as i i was hold on to the pain that was struggling me for quite sometimes. I had  questions on my mind that couldn't find an answer. Suddenly i was just watching a podcast from victory that made me realize, God was just making me stronger to let go.
I started cleaning all the old things i been keeping and it was a great feeling that i was able to let go of things that i have fully accepted, that it has to go for good. It is a great feeling really. Thank you Father God for showing me the real life you want for me this time.
Everything that i was holding on to was removed, i thought i was misplacing it but this time i know that God wants to restore a new life for me.
My phone was dead, broken as in no more hope. Because all the things i have there were all the memories that hurts me, reminding me the pain ive been going through. Now i understand why it was broken because God wants me to have a new life, a new beginning. Thank you Lord!

Don't use people who have to get what you want!
The real triumph of a person is not by attaining money and wealth, it's through keeping a good dignity to people who knows how to respect not for those whose rich but those who are living humbly.
Never under estimate the one who suffers in silence, for the time will come the sufferings will end and the silence will turn to a strong roar!
Do all things with humilty, stay humble to all the blessings that comes and never use it to boast it with anyone. Always remember God blessed you not to show off but be grateful for it.
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. - Martin Luther King Jr
There is nothing impossible to him who will try. - alexander the Great
Things do not happen. Things are made to happen. - John F. Kennedy
To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom. - Bertrand Russell
Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom. - Thomas Jefferson
If you have a choice to keep what will you choose the one who hurt you but you still love or the one you left because you chose someone to be with and still willing to accept you?
The world is struggling with so much battles and if we continue making things thats adding to those struggles were not making life more easier.
Time will come that whatever is hurting us will end and everything will be fine again.
Dont make a decision in life and end up in a wrong situation! You can never take back what you have broken for that decision.
Sacrifice is making someone happy and making your self happy too.
We all struggle with our own different pains in life. But always remember that God is always there for us! He is just waiting for us to come home to him and rest all your pains to him.
Its ok if until now your still struggling to let go of what you feel your not yet ready to let go but you need to learn to move on to learn to be happy even if your not yet ready to let go.
You dont get your worth if you will not stop hanging on to someone who made you feel unworthy.
RT @JodiStaMaria: All of us are broken by something. We all have things fall apart in our lives but let me encourage you with this - there‚Ä¶
Dont sacrifice someone for your own benefit. Its hard to see someone sacrificing to be hurt because you want something in your life suddenly and yet you dont even care what the person feels about your decision.
Pain is the most difficult battle in our life either pain in love, lost someone you love, grieving for someone who past away or ending up a relationship where your still in love. Pain is something that we all need to be ready if we will share our heart to anyone.
You dont love someone if you will just hurt her because you decide one day to fall in love to someone else.
Dont make someone fall for you if you dont ment it, never hurt someone for the sake of your interest.
You never know the idea of someone getting through battling pain to be able to survive everyday until it happens to you.
When you commit your self to someone make sure to commit seriously, you dont know how someone gets through of being hurt.
Never fall in love if you dont want to get hurt. Its a choice of putting your self to pain or putting your self to be happy everyday of your life.
Learn a lesson that love is not all about love, it's a commitment to share your life to someone who will be there for you in the most worst times in your life.

You dont change your life if you know your going to hurt someone very bad. You change your life by not hurting anyone and changes becomes more better in your life.

The first love you have will always remain the first no matter how many woman comes in your life. The first is always be the unforgettable.
Remain loyal no matter what!
No matter how many women comes in your life, there is only one that remains in you, the one who remain in your heart, loyalty is one of the most important in a relationship.
A material person will always see things first than her self.
Try to love someone who prioritize you over money.
Never go back to the person who belittle you. You will always feel belittle  by that person.
Never love someone who reminds you what she has done to you especially when she's angry. Love someone instead who reminds you how much she loves you in spite how angry she was.

With all our brokenness God is always there to heal us, to make us whole and make us new again.
Just trust God in your life and you will never go wrong!
Love God with all your heart, he will never hurt us, we will never be broken and we will never be alone.
We all have our own struggles in life but we will never feel alone once you entrust everything to God!
Why do we need to be afraid of someone we love and left us for someone else? Always remember they're also human we are all the same. Be afraid when we lost our faith in God, always seek him in your life, you will never be afraid, you will never be alone.
We can never hide anything from God. Either we pretend or keep it as a secret, God always sees everything even if we hide it in the bottom of the sea.
Every impossible things are all possible to God.

The best moving on is accepting every pain and understanding why it all happen to you. Then, forget all the pain and remain the good ones. And you will see in the end you made your self more happier.
To be whole, you need to accept few things in your life that it will never be the same way again. Accepting that fact will be more easier to fix what will set you free.
It becomes unselfish when you know what really love is. That even your not together anymore, your love is still there for that person without any gulit or anger, just the memories is all it matters to you.

Money change people easily. Because money rules the wrong way if you allow your self to be ruled by money.
Obey what your heart desire not what your pockets desire. Most of relationship failures is they mix what the heart and personal needs at the same time. And ending up mixing what you really want to prioritize in life and blaming each other that both of you didnt support each other
Some people are mixed between love and priorities. Know your priorities first and then learn to connect love with your priorities.
If you want to be rich then never love because you cannot be rich while your in love. It is better to be in love because if you have love you are rich!
I remember what my mom told me if you get to choose between a man who can give you everything you want and a man who can give you all the love he can for you, just be more wiser to choose love over money.
Most of the times we dont see that happiness is more important than material things, sometimes love is more valuable than making money because happiness and love cannot be sustained with material things and money.
Never make a short, quick decisions in your life if your not even sure you really wanted it. Most of the times you end up loosing so much of things that were more important than the decisions you just made.
It‚Äôs okay not to rush your feelings to be able to show you‚Äôve move on. Sometimes those who rush their feelings ending up realizing more of what they have loose and even if you wanted to go back to where the things you want to will never be that same way again.
Moving on is not really easy to battle. Sometimes it takes years to learn you have moved on. What‚Äôs important is everyday you take one step at a time to accept nothing in this world is permanent.
Release all the grudges in your heart, you cannot go on living your life taking care of grudges. You will not live longer if your heart is not healthy.

When you finally stop being hurt, it means your choosing the right way for you to be happy again.
Dont cheat! Nothing wll change even if you do it. It will just make it worst in you by feeling more guilty and regretful when the relationship your cheating ends or not.
Don‚Äôt hurt someone who love you so much. Hurting someone who love you is like stabbing on her back.
Love someone with all your heart, you don‚Äôt have any idea for someone who is willing to love you more of what you can only give.
Love is not just a word. Love is making effort to maintain it until the end. If you will just hurt someone because you cant handle your own issues then, better pull your self first before loving someone who is ready to give everything for you.
You don‚Äôt leave a long long term relationship just because your not happy anymore, in stead make something different for each other to spark again the relationship. Always remember how you made all the effort winning her heart when you were both starting a relationship.

Failure. Perhaps the worst source of emotional pain of them all. We experience failure when we put our whole heart into something, only to have reality hit us with the truth: we‚Äôre not good enough.
You must learn to reach out to people emotionally; feel the pain of others, and realize that the pain that you are feeling is not as unique as you might think it is.
Apologize to others and to yourself‚Äîaccept that what has happened has happened, and convince yourself that the only way to move forward is to forgive yourself.
The healthiest way to live life is to learn how to deal with this emotional pain and injury, or figuring out the best way to remain ourselves when all the world seems to be pounding against us.
A life without pain is a life unlived, and pain is just the unfortunate byproduct of living a full life.
Be useful to others but don‚Äôt fall into the trap of trying to make the people you‚Äôre being useful to happy along the way.
You can be useful by being a role model, living a life of virtue, having good values, being friendly, acting with kindness and generosity.
Don‚Äôt focus on yourself first, focus on other people first. Find yourself acting in service to other people.
When you want what you already have, happiness becomes a regular condition in your life.
When you value your relationships and treat people with respect, you will find yourself becoming happier much more spontaneously.

RT @The_Gospels: Some say: God loves us if we change. The Gospel says: God's love CHANGES us.
Life becomes most fulfilling when you create value for other people around you. When you put other people first.

There is no such thing as happy all the time, most of the time it has more sadness than being happy. It makes us see the reality of life that nothing is perfect in this world. We should accept that everything in this world has no permanent thing that we can expect and rely on.
Relationship are not only to make us satisfy but to make is whole.
We don‚Äôt look for someone who will only be there to make us happy but who will be there for you when you feel your not happy at all.

Why are we so stubborn enduring pain? It‚Äôs because we are very stubborn to let go what‚Äôs hurting us.

Love has no end, as long as you can love more do it coz when time comes you can no longer love, regret is the most painful feeling you will ever feel.
We only have one chance to have something we really want especially if God gives you what you were really asking for. And if you get that chance never waste it.
Patience is a virtue, so try to wait for better thing to come just have faith in everything you desire.
Never uderestimate your prayers, God really hears you and he will answer all your prayers.
Never stop praying, it‚Äôs the only way to feel safe.
The only way to hold on is pray always and believe you will survive.
Take every chances a day to be happy coz you deserve to be happy after all.
Friendship is only offered after a pass relationship when you still believe there is still hope for a new better relationship for the both of you.
I don‚Äôt believe friendship can save a very broken relationship especially when trust was over used so much that you can no longer offer another trust for that same person again.
Stop longing, hoping, expecting things will still be ok. Stop trying when you feel there‚Äôs no more effort to be done. Just try to walk away and accept that things will never be the same way again.
Sometimes too much love has an ending especially when you‚Äôve been hurt coz you‚Äôve been pushed away many times.

You don‚Äôt need to stalk your ex just to find out the truth behind your doubts. Our eyes doesn‚Äôt lie, what you see is what you get! Once you doubt and once you‚Äôve been lied for so many times, learn to say enough and walk away, just walk away and never turn back!
Don‚Äôt hesitate to fight back most especially when your fighting for is what will set you free!
Your future is more better when you know you have a future that holds you to be more better.
Don‚Äôt stay too long what is hurting you, but stay to what will makes you more happier!
If it‚Äôs meant for you it will stay! If it‚Äôs not meant for you let it go!
Let go! And make room for a new beginning in your life.
It becomes more painful when we still allow yourself to be attached on something that you shouldn‚Äôt be holding on for too long.
Sometimes all you need to do is learn to accept what is not for you anymore and what is meant for you now!

If you want to destroy your relationship lie and cheat!
Lie is the most painful thing you can do to someone who was true to you from the start.
Don‚Äôt love someone who lied at you from the beginning, for sure he will continue lying to you until you get hurt badly.
To those who loves to cheat and lie, Good luck for the karma that will hit them hard!
Spend your time to someone who will give up everything his doing just to be with you! Time is worth it for those people who will give so much effort for you!

If from the start of your relationship you were hurt and betrayed, don‚Äôt take risk of believing that person will never do it again. Always believe if she was able to do that to you in the beginning she will do it again and again and again!
Every one needs a second chance, esp. When that person deserve it because she was always good to you.
You dont need to struggle all alone. Always remember you always deserve better in life.
Don‚Äôt take chances for those who really hurt you! Make a choice to stay away to them for good! They will always hurt you over and over again.

Be strong enough to forgive without hearing an apology.
We have to understand that whatever were going through right now will take a bit of time to endure it, just don‚Äôt rush... even if you wanted to move forward it will still need more time.
Being alone while facing your struggles makes you more stronger each day.
Take time... just take time all you need to flourish your whole self.
If you learn the real purpose of life, you will learn to accept everything that comes your way, and you can easily accept what is really ment for you and what is not by not fighting against it but accepting everything that comes and go in our life.
It is very difficult to endure anxiety but once you learn to embrace it and accept whole heartedly the things that made you feel hurt, anxiety becomes a feeling of reality, of making you more stronger and makes you more a newly renewed person. Take anxiety in a positive way.
Once you were broken things will never get back the way it was before, but it will make a new beginning, a new start for you to make new memories again that will give you more hopes and real happiness once again.
Sometimes you have to face being bitter, being full of hate coz sometimes it‚Äôs the only way to accept everything that hurts you, that made you broken and able to move on with a new you, a better you and a stronger you with a bang!
It feels great to see how someone hurt you badly also feels the same way he did to you. Not because you wanted to get revenge but its the way to make him feel what he exactly done to you. So that he will have the idea of how‚Äôs the feeling of being cruelly he was to you.
Sometimes those who easily move on are the kind of people who easily fall fast coz most of people who easily move on didn‚Äôt actually felt the feeling of struggling and facing pain strongly, but instead they hide and deny the process dealing with it.
The difference of looking like he has moved on quickly and while you still in a broken stage is he pretend everything, while you endure the real process of healing as you really move on. There is no such thing as moved on quickly, a feeling of being hurt is not as one day process
It doesn‚Äôt mean when he is happy and laughing he is really happy, sometimes he hides the most saddest feeling that even himself cannot endure.
Never forget to give more respect to your self, never feel so little, never beg for love and never allow your self to feel pity.
Sometimes what you always think doesn‚Äôt really come out as it expected but surprisingly it turn out more better.

Always trust your gut, if you feel something is wrong it‚Äôs because it usually is.
Find someone who really loves you even if you cant love her the way she does coz it‚Äôs more difficult loving someone who only love you less.
We only get one chance of finding someone who will really love you even if she goes through tremendous pain and still willing to love you once again. Coz you will regret it for the rest of your life if one day you realize she‚Äôs the one and you pushed her away so bad.
Missed being real happy, missed the sound of laughter, missed the feeling of love and most especially missed all of me back then.
It is ok to think he has moved on while your still in pain, it‚Äôs ok to cry all the time to make you feel better, it‚Äôs ok if your still in process of trying to heal coz one day life will turn the other way around when your already healed and he wasn‚Äôt all along.
It was never easy going through in a very bad break up especially when your whole life felt so broken. You don‚Äôt know how to start again and how you‚Äôll be able to be whole again. One thing that you might feel is endure all the pain and just let time heal you day by day.
Sometimes people doesn‚Äôt seems to really care what other people are going through until they exactly feel what they‚Äôre going through.
When everyone seems to say everything will be ok, i guess in some ways, but in reality there is never been really ok but it‚Äôs how you will face it strongly every day.
I miss that smile, the smile that makes you feel better.
When you are trying to fight back everything you have lost and trying to regain lost time too, it‚Äôs really hard though, but i know when you find the strength again, you will be whole just like before.
Someday i know everything will get back normally and tears will be over and smile on my face will be back once again.

Memories are things that can make you feel weak but if you accept that it‚Äôs all just old memories, it wont even hurt you but you need to learn the steps of facing it whole heartedly and try moving on positively.
You need to hold on stronger for yourself, you need to be persistent to stand up on your own to be able to survive to stay strong as you face the reality of moving on all alone in that process! Nobody will help you but yourself.
The hardest thing to feel is when your trying to move on and yet you can‚Äôt coz all his stuffs are still with you coz he told you he still coming back but he didn‚Äôt. Instead you hold on to it when ever you miss him and all you ever did was keeping it to remember him time to time.
Do you ever felt missing someone terribly that the only thing you can do was just cry over and over every time you feel you want to hold her and kiss her like you did when your still together? That‚Äôs really sucks!
Love is difficult to handle esp. when you are still in a moving on situation then the other one was already having fun! Maybe it‚Äôs a realization that you fell in love to a wrong person whom you thought loves you like you did.
Sometimes distance is better when you trust each other, but when there is already trust issue that was broken it is the most difficult thing in a relationship. But if the relationship ended in a hanging situation it is more painful simply coz you don‚Äôt know   Where u stand.

Protect your self, defend your self, and most especially fight back to those who are putting you down!

Sometimes when we get hurt we become vulnerable, we thought it's the end of our life, but what we don't see is that it gives us a new start to begin a new better you, this time its all you now.
We give love because we love the person we want to love.
We often think that love is the only reason we breathe, but unfortunately we live because we believe in life and faith in God to take care of us as we entrust everything to Him.
There is no such right timing but there is always time to make things right.

Life would be more easier if we only learn to love your self more before loving someone so much. Less hurt and less expectations!
Why is cheating is one common factor of a broken relationship? Because most of cheaters never learn, they become more aggressively conceited when you feel someone‚Äôs flirting on you and not thinking of what your partner feels. Most cheaters are selfish and insecure people!
Cheating is a choice not by accident! The more you react with someone whose flirting at you and you enjoyed it even a few minutes means you chose to comply on flirting too!
The more you hide so much of what your doing and the more you become so defensive covering up all your lies with your partner, the more your proving that you are in deed cheating!
Always believe in karma! Never take revenge just pray and Let God do what is ment for those people who hurt you.

You don‚Äôt just say sorry to the one you really hurt so much and then just walked away like nothing really happen. You don‚Äôt know what it feels like a person who was really hurt and broken badly because of what you did.
You don‚Äôt sacrifice someone over your dreams. Because if that happens to you, you will feel exactly how you made the person feels when your the one whose being sacrificed over her dreams too.
We cannot control anyone who wants to stay with you till the end, but that someone can choose to stay with you no matter what your facing in life and help you go through it together.
Endings are the ones it causes us so much pain but at the end of our pain a new feeling grows and it gives another chance to start a new door to make new memories that it will last more better.
An end is not always a bad one but an end can start a new better one.
When it‚Äôs over, then it‚Äôs over. Who knows one day it will open another new beginning, a better beginning.
