Beto O'Rourke told me in Madison he hasn't talked operational roles on a campaign with anyone.		BUT, conversations are happening. He said he's “definitely listening to people who are far smarter than I am, far more experienced than I am, to gain the benefit of their wisdom."
.@BetoORourke: “I understand @AOC’s case all of this stuff is connected -- it absolutely is. But I think of all of the challenges that are trying to be met in that legislation, the greatest and the only existential challenge is climate.”
.@BetoORourke said he broke with Ocasio-Cortez on the notion that universal health care and universal employment should be seen as central elements of a Green New Deal, saying he “would probably respectfully say, keep the focus on climate.”

O'Rourke on Trump declaring a national emergency: "It’s hard to make a rational case for an emergency declaration or troops on the border or any amount of additional border walls or border fencing or steel slats."

@ltblaize Like it doesn’t even make *business* sense to not pursue one of the most marketable players in recent baseball history. If you can’t see the opportunities to make more money with Bryce Harper on your team, you’re doing everything wrong.
@ltblaize So here’s my thing: Given the $ that falls off the payroll next year, it seems the crunch is only this year. Are they seriously saying they can’t, over the life of a contract, make more than this year’s extra $30 or $40 million or whatever marketing Bryce Harper?! Or Machado?!

@MaggyW5 @Wilson__Valdez @WalkerBragman Well but that’s what I’m saying: People who read this story could very well come to the conclusion that Beto was right. And the firefighter union’s quotes give him some credibility to say he didn’t by any means support some Wisconsin-style public union-busting effort.
@Wilson__Valdez @WalkerBragman What was disingenuous about it? Assuming my tweet was right about the central tension here, he quoted the firefighters’ union, Beto’s spox, Beto’s own comments from the time of the fight and others. It seemed like a fair exploration with the relevant sides pretty fully aired out?
Good story on Beto’s city council fight with the police union from @WalkerBragman.

You hear him over and over talking about telling human stories about life on the border. Highlighting regular people there has been his obsession since #TXSen. And he knows if he throws in a gross shot from a dentist chair, we'll cover it more or less in his frame -- not Trump's.

Beto himself is showing he’s not ready to leave politics behind. Exhibit A: Last night’s Facebook Live responding to Trump on the issue that most fuels O’Rourke’s old friends’ desire to see him run. https://t.co/C5U0Cod8kH
O’Rourke returned some messages over the holidays. He’s sought his friends’ advice. His Senate campaign staffers all want him to run. An unaffiliated draft movement thinks the signals are there. 		But early-state invites are piling up, unanswered. https://t.co/C5U0Cod8kH
Other 2020ers have been calling since the midterms. Kamala Harris spoke with Beto. Elizabeth Warren left a voicemail. https://t.co/C5U0Cod8kH
About that @DMRegister op-ed ... O’Malley and O’Rourke met in December. And O’Malley checked with David Wysong before publishing. He wanted to make sure he wasn’t going out on a limb that was about to be sawed off — and got the green light. https://t.co/C5U0Cod8kH

@MRasconCPA Yeah, I'm focusing on the one who's a viable potential candidate for president, Melissa.
@MRasconCPA @BetoORourke They all entered politics as Caballero followers and supporters, and several were elected to the city council the year after he lost.
Anyway: The potential candidate who’s one of the biggest question marks in the 2020 field is unemployed and is literally wandering his streets looking for a piece of the marquee political fight in the country at this moment. Read into that what you will.	https://t.co/zXNQZJCOoL
O’Rourke said on tonight’s Facebook Live he’d be disappointed if Dems capitulate on the wall to reopen the government. “Not only do we not need a wall by any measure, but that wall is bound to cause death and suffering and misery.” 	https://t.co/zXNQZJCOoL
O’Rourke on Trump: “If I lived in Michigan, Iowa, Oregon, the northern border, I wouldn’t know any better. And shit, the president of the United States just said there are rapists and criminals and murderers who will chop your head off coming to get us. Fuck yeah, build a wall.”
On tonight’s Facebook Live, he said Trump is able to “directly connect with fear and stoke anxiety and even panic, and keep it simple” – and that his job was to do “a better job of telling human stories.” 	https://t.co/zXNQZJld0b
That’s also what has motivated most of @BetoORourke’s political activity since losing #TXSen. Moments like this are what O’Rourke can do but most other prospective Democratic candidates can’t: 	https://t.co/3rixWH1Obg
Steve Ortega, whose house he's at right now on Facebook, was part of that group. So were now-Rep. Veronica Escobar, Susie Byrd, O’Rourke’s top aide David Wysong and some others. They see an O’Rourke run as a powerful response to Trump’s characterization of their home.
A little O’Rourke history: He’s part of a group that rose in the early 2000s in El Paso around then-Mayor Ray Caballero. That group includes a lot of his closest friends and political allies, pretty much all of whom want him to run for president. 	https://t.co/zXNQZJCOoL
Beto O’Rourke’s Facebook Live walk through Sunset Heights in El Paso -- part of a massive binational metropolitan area -- is designed rebut Trump’s fear-stoking about the Southern border. 		“It just doesn’t get much safer than where we are,” he said. 	https://t.co/zXNQZJCOoL

The downsides? He’s never won a tough race, for starters. And that's a huge downside! But the upside is pretty clear. So I’m glad @ForecasterEnten and @CillizzaCNN put him on their list.
He also clearly has weaknesses as a candidate, but room to improve on them. For example: Cruz absolutely clobbered him in their first debate. In the second, O’Rourke admitted he overcompensated. He’d probably keep improving, but ran out of time to against Cruz.
One thing that some Dems have pointed out: Being a young, thin, white man means people receive him on a stage sweating profusely, or eating guac while driving, or whatever, differently than they would other candidates. Not saying it’s fair, but it's a reality.
He successfully communicated a progressive vision in an aspirational, largely non-partisan way. He didn’t obsess about Trump (or Cruz). A lot of primary voters who want a Biden or a Bernie or an Obama type might all find something different to like in him.
Beto’s “superpowers” are unique in the prospective field. It’s hard to fake authenticity against a guy who livestreams his life. It’s hard to look anti-establishment when you reject "corporate" PAC money but he rejects all PAC money. He's younger than other "authentic" prospects.
Harry and I joke about Beto because we have different views. He says he’s not running. I did a Beto 2020 story last week (https://t.co/yN4I2YZPj4) but don’t know what he’ll do. We’ll see. 		Here’s what I do think... https://t.co/zjdN9RP97L

Dems went 6-for-6 in Senate and governor's races in MI, PA and WI. 7-for-9 if you add OH and IA. They won a bunch of House seats in those states, too. 		The rapid swing left sets up a 2020 battle royale. https://t.co/hgdLp2KZI5
On the statehouse front, Democrats are rebounding from Obama-era losses.		Democrats gained six "trifectas" Tuesday: CO, IL, ME, NV, NM, NY. They also busted GOP trifectas in KS, MI, NH and WI. 		Per @TheDLCC, Democrats as of 3 a.m. ET had flipped 333 Republican-held seats.
Much *closer*. Sorry. It's 5 a.m.
For all the whining about reporters/pollsters' focus on #TXSen, worth noting that Beto O'Rourke came much to winning than the Democratic candidates in Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota.

Democrats can't yet count on the Sun Belt, tonight's results so far show. But — with #WIGov the biggest question mark left — they are rebuilding the "blue wall" that includes MI and PA. Lots more on the 2020 ramifications to come. One big win tonight: https://t.co/271SAyZFap

Can Democrats rebuild the blue wall? 		We'll get a look soon as polls close at 9 p.m. ET in Wisconsin and Michigan, two states Trump won where Democrats hope to win the governors' offices.		Keep an eye on the Kansas governor's race too. Follow along live: https://t.co/Eahk9LE7td
Polls in perhaps the most important batch of states tonight for House control are closing NOW. 		Democrats expect to win four (and could win more) in Pennsylvania. They expect two (but could win four) in New Jersey. Follow along live: https://t.co/Eahk9LE7td
More polls just closed — with lots of early indicators of whether a blue wave is coming. 		In Virginia, Dems need #VA10. They expect #VA02. But if they get #VA07, a wave's coming. 		#GA06 and #GA07 and #FL06 and #FL15 are wave-makers. Follow live: https://t.co/Eahk9LE7td

This election is going to shape the 2020 Democratic veepstakes in a major way. A bunch of people on the ballot — Whitmer, Gillum, Brown, Abrams, Beto, etc. — could add diversity, philosophic or geographic balance, ability to carry a key state. But they’ve gotta win today first.

@vanityman I think this is very likely true. And stocking the bench is important for future races, no doubt. But I wonder if their wins would be a one-time byproduct of his candidacy or would signal a long-term shift. I don’t know the answer to that question.
@fabalasays Totally. And if I was a Texas Dem that would be a really big deal. But this was the problem with what was left of Obama ‘08. It was a movement built around a person that never translated to broader gains for the party.
Like, does everything collapse without Beto? Will he have rehabbed the dilapidated Dem infrastructure in Texas? Will he leave them with a better bench? Will the previously whiter electorate’s demographics start to more closely match the more diverse population’s? Etc.
I think this is maybe the most important #TXSen question of them all. We know why Cruz is likely to win and what Beto needs to do to pull off a stunner. But what will this leave for TX Dems after, other than one famous dude with a massive email list? https://t.co/llhDstg50b

Trump in West Virginia again concedes the GOP might lose control of the House. "I’m not saying that they won’t squeak it by, maybe, because they’ve got a lot of races, and I can’t go everywhere," he says of Democrats.
In West Virginia, Trump pronounces the Democratic #WV03 candidate's last name "O-hay-da." Richard Ojeda pronounces his name "O-jed-uh." 		He also calls Ojeda a vote for Nancy Pelosi. Ojeda has told me and others he opposes Pelosi.
Obama hits Trump on birthright citizenship, saying: "A president doesn’t get to decide on his own who’s an American citizen and who’s not. That’s not how the Constitution of the United States works."
More Obama: "When words don’t mean anything, when truth doesn’t matter, when people can just lie with abandon, democracy can’t work."		He says Trump doesn't "actually accomplish things," instead opting to "just make stuff up." https://t.co/21mMiFx7pq
Obama's going hard at Trump in Florida right now. Accuses him of "constant fear-mongering to distract." 		"What we have not seen is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lying -- just making stuff up. That’s what they’re doing right now, all the time."

Sometimes a journalist and a politician become linked. To me, that’s Matt and Mitch Daniels. During a time of fast, dramatic change in Indiana, Matt was a moral compass — he often told politicians what needed to matter, what they were missing, and they listened to him.

@randOmuos @CillizzaCNN As the stories say: "CNN invited Cruz multiple times to appear tonight in his own town hall, but he declined."
Wrapping up CNN's #TexasTownHall, two headlines: 		1. Beto O'Rourke's a "definitive no" on running for president. https://t.co/PDiKQ9HEjt		2. He says he'd vote to impeach Trump. He also regrets mimicking Trump's "Lyin' Ted" attack. #TXSen https://t.co/zM6ASCOrJz
The GOP’s Trump-era gains have been with white voters. But one interesting reality of the cycle is if they hold onto a narrow House majority, it’ll be in part because non-white candidates were really tough in Clinton districts: Hurd, Curbelo, Young Kim in #CA39, Salazar in #FL27 https://t.co/KMnqjYbkkJ
I suspect Cruz's campaign will be very happy about this impeachment answer. Cruz hit this again and again in their last debate. #TXSen https://t.co/cy1CeFCbBH
O'Rourke says he regrets using Trump's "Lying Ted" nickname against Cruz in Tuesday night's debate. 		"“It’s not something that I feel totally comfortable with, and perhaps in the heat of the moment I took a step too far," he says. #TXSen #TexasTownHall
@catawu Did you read the story? I'm referring to digital + organizing tactics, which the story gets into.
Beto O'Rourke says he would vote to impeach President Trump. “I would liken impeachment to an indictment. There is enough there to proceed to a trial,” he said. “I would not prejudge the outcome of that trial. ... All I am saying is, there’s enough there." #TXSen #TexasTownHall
Moving forward, what I'm wondering: Win or lose, does Beto's race change anything long-term for Texas Dems? They might get a boost in House races. But what about lasting infrastructure? Can Beto build anything that avoids the OFA post-2008 sort of collapse of momentum? #TXSen
Beto's campaign's organizing and digital philosophies are Bernie 2016, evolved. 		Read about how Beto's money machine works + "distributed organizing" in action. 		@MikeNellis says Beto's consultants "should be household names." #TXSen 	https://t.co/bU3lY1kz5v
Your pre-#TexasTownHall reading: 		Beto O'Rourke is running out of time. He's more aggressive in attacking Cruz. Where things stand four days before early voting starts — and a close look at the digital and organizing efforts he'll need to save him. #TXSen	https://t.co/bU3lY1kz5v

Alternatively: What if the Democrats in those races ran like Beto?		Political Twitter has this sense that attention and energy around a candidate ought to be tied pretty directly to how winnable that race is. I dunno, just doesn’t seem like that’s how people think. https://t.co/rjRky04KOw

@jdonohue04 I’m not missing that — it’s part of why I think the race is interesting. Heard a lot of “not since Ann Richards...” when I was in rural central Texas this spring.
@cb0321 Yeah, I hear ya. There are a lot. Did one myself. 		Also, just a thought for strategists working on other races: Part of why Beto gets profiled is he'll let anybody hop in the car with him and talk about anything. Most candidates are afraid to do that. Stop being afraid.
@ForecasterEnten That tweet was just for you!
@leahaskarinam Yes, totally. Me too! I'm probably even more interested in some of this year's gubernatorial candidates. But we're not really the general audience... and the Texas race obviously has significance beyond one Senate seat.
Anyway, I guess back to making fun of all the Beto profiles, everybody.
Two things are true: 1) It's pretty universally believed in both parties that #TNSen is a more realistic Dem pick-up opportunity than #TXSen. 		2) #TXSen is just a really interesting race. Beto's a compelling candidate and Cruz inspires passion. That's why people write about it. https://t.co/jXxklyYSZc

@mj_lee Thanks MJ!
@abigail_doull @jmpalmieri @AyannaPressley Yes. And Rep. Joe Kennedy II, too.
I put all this in a story: Who is @AyannaPressley? #MA07 https://t.co/4c3r0C2hOy
Any notion that this is a lefty ousting a moderate is silly. @AyannaPressley was a well-known figure in Massachusetts Democratic politics who just beat a congressman who'd been an early Medicare-for-all supporter, Iraq war opponent and critic of ICE's creation. #MA07
.@AyannaPressley talked about idolizing Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan. But it was a unique race. The CBC endorsed her opponent. One of their most glaring differences wasn't about policy -- it was about Colin Kaepernick. It reflected their different styles. #MA07
.@AyannaPressley talks openly about her father spending much of her childhood in prison, and about being a rape victim. She's a force on the campaign trail -- doesn't really need a microphone and can't use one anyway because she talks with her hands. #MA07
She was the first black woman elected to the Boston city council and has been on national Democrats' radars for a while. Here she is at @emilyslist in 2015, in a speech that opened some eyes: https://t.co/J4k4Ct1a1L
A little about @AyannaPressley: Her campaign slogan -- "Change Can't Wait" -- connects the hope of the Obama era to the urgency of the Trump era. Her go-to line is that "the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power." #MA07
Another House incumbent goes down: @mikecapuano concedes he's lost the #MA07 primary to @AyannaPressley. 		Pressley, 44, is a Boston city councilor and a rising Democratic star. This isn't @Ocasio2018: This race has been competitive and closely watched for months. https://t.co/yKJWZWCIk3
In NY, the arcane quirks wound up backfiring and helping @Ocasio2018 win. In MA, those outdated, protective laws -- which @BostonGlobe has long argued in editorials need updating -- could have the opposite effect on @AyannaPressley. I got at this a little in my story. #MA07 https://t.co/rXmRLCmREJ
A thought as we wait on Massachusetts results: As Democrats champion voter access laws like same-day and automatic registration nationwide, it seems hypocritical and problematic that some of the bluest states -- like MA and NY -- have such outdated voting laws. #MA07
Polls are closing in Massachusetts! As we wait for results, for a look at what's at stake, read my story on @AyannaPressley's bid to oust @mikecapuano, one of the nation's most progressive congressmen, in JFK's old district. #MA07 https://t.co/mFxo1sVgqF

@KeithLeBlanc63 @AyannaPressley @mikecapuano It's fine, I hear ya, just saying I think the reasons this isn't an Ocasio-Cortez situation are detailed pretty thoroughly in the story (and also my second tweet in the thread about the story).
@KeithLeBlanc63 @AyannaPressley @mikecapuano I hear ya on the likelihood that it wouldn’t tip general election outcomes in such a blue state, for sure. Where it makes a difference is getting low-propensity voters out, especially in primaries and midterms.
@KeithLeBlanc63 @AyannaPressley @mikecapuano I actually quote Capuano saying Pressley is generic! And restrictive voting laws: No same-day registration and no early voting, for starters -- which are WAY out of step with where the Democratic Party is on voting access these days.
@djlavoie @kyletblaine @PeterHamby He's compelling and has a lot of fans on the left, no doubt. But that's a big leap!
Sort of related to @PeterHamby’s Beto 2020 point... the Dem 2020 veepstakes could be filled with 2018 candidates. 		*If they win* and depending on the nominee ... Beto, Stacey Abrams, Gillum, Whitmer, Sinema, maybe others have to be at least considered, right? Who am I missing? https://t.co/phafZpEbBk

.@mikecapuano says @AyannaPressley "has an obligation to say what she would be doing differently" and "hasn't done that, except to say that she'd do it differently."		"I don't know what that means." #MA07 https://t.co/mFxo1sVgqF https://t.co/JgrZEqndrK
Is Pressley the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez? Some key differences:	— Pressley doesn't say she'd vote differently than Capuano. 	— She's a well-established Boston politician, not an unknown. 	— NY's arcane election laws helped Ocasio-Cortez. MA's arcane laws could hurt Pressley.
New: My look at @AyannaPressley's effort to oust @mikecapuano in Tuesday's #MA07 primary. 		Pressley casts it as a style clash "for the soul of our party." Capuano says she's campaigning on "generic comments." 	https://t.co/okfwS6waYd

It’s inaccurate but echoing @BenjySarlin — I’ve heard a lot of members of Congress, govs, presidential candidates, etc. say things that reflect weak grasps of policy.		I think about Pence’s early governorship: He struggled to transition from right-wing warrior to state executive.

Through the lens of 2020, this is a rejection of Clinton-era politics, the belief that Democrats should move to the middle to court moderates dissatisfied with Trump, and a while male nominee in general.
This portion of @KamalaHarris' #NN18 speech was important. In the same speech she said the Democratic Party has taken "those who helped build" it -- black women, in particular -- for granted, and that "in 2018, we should be electing women of color." https://t.co/nS9SfJa1OR

In Nevada in June, Elizabeth Warren told a crowd she's fighting Trump in "2018 and rolling on into 2020." Today in New Orleans, she said she's "going up that hill." Her staff put "PERSIST" signs on chairs here at #NN18.		She's playing it the least coy of Dems not named Delaney.
Her team came prepared. As Warren wraps up, "PERSIST" signs shoot up. #NN18
Warren winks at 2020: "We’re going to have to fight uphill. But me? I’m going up that hill and I hope you are, too." Then, she uses the refrain "nevertheless, we will persist." #NN18
More Warren at #NN18: "It comes in all sorts of flavors: Racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia. It comes in all sorts of forms: Nasty personal attacks.  Trolling on Twitter. Winking at white supremacists.  It all adds up to the same thing: the politics of division."
Warren: "Trump and his pals tell working people a story about what’s gone wrong in their lives."		"No, the problem is other working people. People who are black or brown.  People who were born somewhere else. People who don’t worship the same, dress the same, talk the same..."
Elizabeth Warren, calling Trump an expert at the politics of division at #NN18: "It might be the one thing Donald Trump is really good at -- that and kissing up to two-bit dictators."

On Brian Kemp’s win in the #GAGov GOP runoff: https://t.co/6I3I4lT5pe		Some Republicans already regret Trump’s intervention, believing it makes @staceyabrams more of a threat. 		November’s match-up has implications for Dems’ 2020 roadmap, too. Remember, GA was closer than OH, IA.
Those technical trade issues are often cultural — for example, Europe wants non-GMO crops; we don’t.		Also ... the United States heavily subsidizes ag. Especially sugar. Would Trump eliminate those subsidies?
The barriers to U.S.-EU trade are largely technical. As in, how do you test whether a car meets safety standards, or how do you vet the safety of new prescription drugs, chemicals, etc. 		Those differences can be/often are addressed in trade deals. But you don’t just “drop” them. https://t.co/K8QENiKqf4

I don’t really get the mockery of the “people will die” assertion. It’s clear that abortion rights are central to the Kavanaugh confirmation battle. Don’t all sides of that debate credibly believe that lives are on the line when it comes to Roe v. Wade’s future? https://t.co/VdkruJunOo

Good @alexburnsNYT story on Elizabeth Warren confronting Trump directly today, with Nevada as the battlefield.		I caught Warren in Henderson and it sure sounded like a 2020 stump speech. https://t.co/yrViSxhjvu
As she wraps up, Warren sprinkles in a mention of the fight against Trump in “2018 and rolling on into 2020.”
Another Warren line you might read something into as she makes her first visit to a 2020 early state: “This is a moment of great patriotism in this country. This is a moment when women come off the sidelines.”
Warren: “I gotta tell ya, I am in this fight and I am in it all the way.”
Warren is talking taxes. She blamed the GOP tax bill for lawmakers’ failure to move her 10-year, $100 billion opioid package. Republicans, she says, tell her, “We don’t have the money.”		“And why do we not have the money? Because they gave away a trillion and a half dollars.”
Warren on what it feels like with Trump in office: “You’re in a forest. You’re in a hurricane. You’re in an Alice in Wonderland novel.”		“Hurricane” had a Lucinda Williams twang, since apparently I’m tweeting about pronunciation.
Warren is pronouncing “Nev-ad-a” right, for what it’s worth. 	https://t.co/x4S8ju3Lef

A few things Mike Braun told me last week that didn’t make it into my #INSen story:	— He won’t self-fund for the general.	— He sees himself as the new Tom Coburn.	— His favorite senators are Ron Johnson, David Perdue, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee.	— He wants to be in leadership.

@AmandaDBeam A good bit more than a bit!
There was a lot of emphasis late in the #INSen primary on northern Indiana — around South Bend, in particular — because none of the candidates had any sort of base there, making Braun's money especially important. So I'm keeping an eye on St. Joseph County.

The winner of tonight's #INSen debate is Romeo Langford.
The former Indiana governor who's come up the most is Mitch Daniels — not Mike Pence. 		It makes sense: Daniels' influence and legacy is towering, and Pence's tenure was short and controversial. I'm not sure that matches the view from the national level though. #INSen
Voting for trade promotion authority now gets you attacked in a Republican primary. Amazing. #INSen #TPA
Messer just broke the news to debate watchers that Langford committed to IU! Must've snuck a look at his cell when the camera wasn't on him. The best possible line of the night and I'm not joking about that. #INSen

All the absentees are counted in #PA18, and @ConorLambPA is up by 627 votes. Provisional, military and overseas can trickle in until March 20, but here's the count right now:		Lamb, D – 113,813 – 49.8%	Saccone, R – 113,186 – 49.6%	Miller, Lib. – 1,379 – 0.6%

@ForecasterEnten So much waiting for so few ballots! We could have just driven to Pittsburgh and counted them by hand by now.
That said, Lamb defined himself early and bashed Nancy Pelosi in a TV ad. It worked for him.		Pelosi-bashing has gotta be appealing other Democratic candidates who were watching. Will they do it? Can they, with primaries? What about the tens of millions she raises for the @dccc?
@ZM1689 He’s pro-choice but personally opposes abortion — exact same position as Tim Kaine. 		On guns you have more of a point, though he supports expanded background checks.
Democrats have candidates in some competitive races who a) have similar profiles and b) don’t have tough primaries. 		#PA18 could be more replicable than Republicans want to admit. https://t.co/B7ulseNZp9
Conor Lamb wasn’t really a Republican-lite candidate. 		He ran a pro-union campaign against a right-to-work guy. He did direct-to-camera ads ripping the GOP tax bill. He toed the Democratic line on health care. 		It’s why Republicans spent the race latching him to Pelosi. #PA18

I was wrong about this earlier! Because it's a district, not statewide, recounts aren't automatic. They require petitions from three voters in each precinct, PA SOS spox says.
Right now @ForecasterEnten, @CillizzaCNN and I are Slack chatting through the results. Read along with us: https://t.co/8jYbvbbeEg
Polls are closing in #PA18. Some good numbers to know:	— 2016: Trump 58, Clinton 39	— Voter reg: 46.2% D, 41.4% R	— Ethnicity: 93% white	— Lamb raised $3.1M; Saccone raised $615K	— Automatic recount if it's a win of less than 0.5%

Also of note in the Monmouth poll: 96% say Trump's tariffs haven't affected whether they'll vote for Saccone or Lamb — who agree on the issue. Makes me glad I wrote this story: https://t.co/Zd5yoImCp2
New #PA18 numbers from @MonmouthPoll: 		Lamb leads 51% to Saccone's 45%, using a turnout model that anticipates a surge in Dem turnout like other previous special elections.		Lamb also leads 49% to 47% with a historical midterm turnout model.

@TheBickell90 Yes it was. Part of why I’m paying attention/did an early story!
Bad news for Dems: Unlike #PA18, another Trump-by-20 district, Dems are at a huge voter registration disadvantage. It’s also an older electorate.		Good news: Much of it’s suburban, and there are a lot of independents. That’s why the state and local parties are so invested. #AZ08 https://t.co/La6m1lGDj0
@cmahar3 Probably true — it’s a long-shot, as my story lays out. Then again they shouldn’t be competitive in #PA18. (Big difference, for sure, in party registration, though.)
Arizona Democrats say they’re all-in on the #AZ08 special election — another House race in a deep-red district.		What’s unique here: A) They’re not lowering expectations, and B) They see the West Valley race as a test run headed into a huge fall.	https://t.co/JkFiSlwS21

@Hero_Complex Branding. If she runs, opponents will portray her as an elitist, Harvard, ivory tower figure. She's telling a much different and more personal story about herself here.
@Fabionsays You're a comms professional, so I'm sure you're well aware I'm talking (in 280 characters) about how opponents will portray her bio vs. how she'll tell her own story and what she'll choose to emphasize. But sure, keep trolling.

@NicholasRyan84 Likely to flip R. Its current holder, Joe Donnelly, is a Democrat.
@ritarepulso Ha, I hear ya. I've seen it semi-often but you're right, it's about as obviously self-serving as it gets.
@jparise858 He lost re-election in 2016 by 13 points, in a county Trump won by 3. And that was BEFORE his conviction and pardon. So, like Roy Moore, he has his die-hards, for sure. But he'd also be toxic in a general election.
@ritarepulso Ha, welcome to fundraising solicitations. Trust me, they get a LOT worse than this.

Which GOP retirement so far is most valuable to Democrats in their pursuit of control of the House? 		Royce, Ros-Lehtinen, Reichert and LoBiondo seem to be the clear top four right now, right? Trott, Dent also key.
Royce had $3.5 million in the bank. 		The Democrats have one candidate who won a $266 million lottery and another who's already given his campaign $2 million. 		So backing a Royce replacement could be an expensive blow for the GOP. #CA39
Ed Royce's retirement is huge news for Democrats. It's an even PVI district that Clinton won by 9. 		Royce was a tough target. Now, the seat's a very clear pick-up opportunity. #CA39 	https://t.co/0xEWcr2met

@shelbinator Right?! I don’t even know where you get film canisters these days.
To put a bow on all this:		James Alcorn, the election board chairman, says Yancey is now certified as the winner.		Is a second recount allowed? It’s an “open question” for a judge to decide, he says.		VA House Dems say a statement on their next steps is forthcoming.
Simonds: “We offered a deal to my opponent that would have sorted all of this out so that someone could be seated on Jan. 10, and he did not take that offer.”		(She’d offered yesterday to let the lot draw settle the race; Yancey didn’t take her up on it.)
Simonds, the Democratic candidate in Virginia: “At this moment, I am not conceding. ... I am reflecting and taking a moment to thank my supporters.”
Simonds says “all options are still on the table” when asked if she might ask for a second recount.
Shelly Simonds calls her loss in the lot draw a “sad conclusion for me” and says “Medicaid expansion really was on the line here.”
In a few minutes, Virginia election officials will settle a state House race that could decide control of the chamber with a “lot draw.”		They’ll draw one of these two film canisters — each with a candidate’s name on a piece of paper inside — out of this blue bowl. https://t.co/iZPFMkgyaf
