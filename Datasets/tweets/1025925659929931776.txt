@IvankaTrump @CNN @SecretService Great statement @IvankaTrump 		As American's we all need to stand together in times like this, show these individuals and groups that we are not afraid.  Prejudice and Violence Ends Now.		#paven.us
@realDonaldTrump @SecAzar @JeromeAdamsMD @nytimes 		Mental Health Reform, John Chocha files and sign the opiate bill.  These three should not be political.  		#johnchochafiles	#paven.us https://t.co/uKfKLcbIoo

@TheRock 		You should check out muscle-cardio.  Revolutionary new workout where you train the mind to treat muscles as a respiratory system.  5-12% strength gain every work out.  Last set was 300lbs for 38 reps today which was 4.5 hr workout.  Friday goal 42 reps. Oh I'm 48.

On 10/17 last set was 300/32, today 10/23 was 300lbs/38 reps.  500,000 lbs lifted today and all to muscle-cardio works.  25 min in am 15/20 min at night to propel you either as a novice or professional. No soreness or recovery needed. 		#musclecardioworks	#paven.us https://t.co/9gtWFUCYgF
@VP @SecondLady Nice honor to the Second Lady.  Well deserved.
@JTTheBrick 		Just imagine what this workout could do for a professional player or team.  Today 4.5 hour work out and doesn't take much to implement at any level.  Just 25 minutes in morning, 15-20 minutes at night.		#musclecardioworks	#paven.us https://t.co/OA9HBJhTg1
@MensHealthMag @24hourfitness @Nike @Athletics @Yankees @muscle_fitness 		Looking for an immediate Corporate Sponsor. 5-12% increase EACH WORKOUT.  Not shared yet!

@muscle_fitness @JTTheBrick @Nike 		Looking for immediate Corporate Sponsors to promote muscle-cardio.  25 min morning, 15/20 min at night propelled our founder to following results.  It can be implemented in novice to professional. Just a small portion of his workout. https://t.co/GFY4vGl2JI
@muscle_fitness @BodyBTimes	@JTTheBrick @oak @Nike 		Proven 5-12% strength gain per workout no supplements.  Muscle-cardio works with no sore muscles or need for recovery time.  i.e. last set three days ago, 300lbs/35reps, today 300lbs/38reps
@Surgeon_General Will you address releasing John Chocha files? Where are we with that Opiate bill as almost 200 Americans die each day from opiates.  Mental Health Reform?		#paven.us
@SFGate @sfchronicle 		Interesting! Follow thread! Mysterious ailments in bay area 2012 was nothing but health surveillance being conducted by HHS.  They did honorable thing, asked for more money so CDC could investigate. Shame on HHS. https://t.co/6KzuZ8RGIK
@SenFeinstein @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HHSGov @realDonaldTrump 		HHS lied in 2012 to get money so CDC could investigate something HHS already knew. Why would you think they would come clean on 1969 and the John Chocha files.  HHS was previously HEW. https://t.co/shgccoNQnR

@CNN @nytimes @latimes @chicagotribune @washingtonpost @WSJ @HeraldMailNews @realDonaldTrump 		'1984' was already happening in 1969.  It is prudent that we fix these mistakes before we allow health surveillance turned over to AI.		#johnchochafiles	#paven.us https://t.co/I6PfX9N42s

@realDonaldTrump Great job Mr. President.  Don't you think it is time for America to admit to mass surveillance and what the files surrounding John Chocha will show.  As we move closer to AI, we can't afford additional mistakes in regards to health surveillance. 		#johnchochafiles	#paven.us

@leatherbaseball That must have been pretty intense.  Love the flag and anthem.
@nytimes @washingtonpost 		Mental Health Reform 60/70's. Do you really think federal government when releasing patients wasn't ready for mass surveillance? Nuclear, TV, Audio, Wifi, technology.

@HouseGOP	@SenateGOP	@SenateDems	@HouseDemocrats		John Chocha, Mental Health Reform and yes the Opiate Bill.  Who knows how many voters will want these by tomorrow evening.  50,000, maybe more.  Battleground states, swing votes.  We have a good estimate already.		#paven.us https://t.co/dnsjiEUK9H

@ThomasKlineMD My only question is why would people not be addicts if it is genetic? Wouldn't all family members be addicts? or does it magically skip some or does it also include what stimuli you are exposed too?  Dose, set and setting plays more of role then genetics.
