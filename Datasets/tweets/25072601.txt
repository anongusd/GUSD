@SenFeinstein @RepZoeLofgren Farmers throughout California struggle mightily to find workers, and we all know that backbreaking farm labor is performed largely by illegal immigrants. Today @RepZoeLofgren and you introduced legislation to provide illegal immigrant farm workers a path to citizenship.
@SenFeinstein More than 800,000 furloughed federal workers are struggling to pay their bills, but rather than reopen the government, Senate Demoncrat and Republican leaders are instead prioritizing legislation to attack womenâ€™s health. Itâ€™s unacceptable.
