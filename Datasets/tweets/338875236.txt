We need accountable border policy. Not baseless rhetoric. https://t.co/tYHqVjIqle
TODAY: Experts from across the southern border region discussed what common-sense, responsible and accountable border policy looks like when it comes to negotiations to protect dreamers. Listen to the full discussion below. https://t.co/vyqLFPUamw
Stripping citizenship away from naturalized citizens based on technicalities? They had faith in our country, but our country failed them. https://t.co/dDkIEggnIo
BREAKING: Judge orders Trump administration to accept DACA renewals.  Move is temporary. Congress needs to protect Dreamers permanently.  https://t.co/YzxC9TNLAM
People in the border region have made our communities beautiful. Don't harm border families, Congress.	https://t.co/21MedWWcwW
Bipartisan solutions for Dreamers that don't harm border communities should not be this hard to pass.	https://t.co/zSIlMxds4q
Thank you @HurdOnTheHill and @RepPeteAguilar for listening to the border communities and championing a bipartisan solution for DACA recipients.  https://t.co/i7dAJEcdKP
Our border communities are stronger because of the contributions of immigrants and refugees who call this place home. Ending TPS for Salvadorans would only further destabilize both the US and El Salvador. https://t.co/eLjNGaNz49

Increased militarization "creates an immense amount of fear" for communities under the boot of border patrol. Our colleague @Pedroconsafos shares his experience as a border resident in the 6th episode of "Solidarity Is This." https://t.co/YoB5eZa7hG
Attempts to deter asylum seekers with detention, and now family separation, are not only inconsistent with U.S. obligations under U.S. and international laws, they are also ineffective and cruel. 	https://t.co/MgEkeFExkB
"The truth on the ground is far different." Our border communities are some of the safest cities in the country. Presenting a distorted narrative about the border does not translate to rational policy. 	https://t.co/whHWo56PyU
PRESS RELEASE: This type of policy is cruel, senseless and unjustified. Separating families that are seeking refuge and asylum is heartless and goes against the most fundamentals values of a civilized society.	https://t.co/YG2nyB1VQK
