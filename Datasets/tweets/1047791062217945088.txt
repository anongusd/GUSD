@EdKrassen Facts!  Who cares about them!  Welcome to Trump World!
@LindseyGrahamSC Sure Lindsey, who cares about the will of the voters( more voters don’t want a wall by a minor margin) and who gives a damn about the Constitution?  John     McCain  must be turning over in his gravel seeing you grovel for Trump.
@chipcoffey That’s not a nice accusation.  If my  son called me and said he needed me I’d be on a plane yesterday.  Family and friends are important.
