@JohnAnzo Also, if we had won the focus of the story would be about how non-white the electorate was.
@JohnAnzo It is ludicrous to say Florida leans one why or the other.  When you have three statewide races decided by less than half a percent it's not leaning anywhere.  With these turnout numbers the difference between winning and losing is being 54% with NPAs instead of 53%.

Hey folks, return your ballot.  If you're in SD 8, 16, 22, 24 or 36 you're going to be hearing from us tonight.

@rnhawkins I think it‚Äôs solid messaging.
@PeterSchorschFL Yes we do.
It's not even Noon yet on Tuesday.  It's gonna be a really long October.
The team at #WinJustice will pass 35,000 knocks in SD 36 today.  They're hitting 4,000 knocks a day as we ramp to election day.
This number was +10 Republican in 2014.  +4 Dem is now a 14% shift. https://t.co/AijffJa3dl

Hispanic's are 16% of registered voters up from 14.5% in 2014
We here at @AmericaVotes just got an updated voter file.  Couple thoughts:  From May to Aug. 31st new registrants are 23% Hispanic.  That's 7% above their share of registration.  Black new registrations are 1% above their registration share since May - and 2% above since July

And statewide if 2018 mirrors the +1 rep vote share advantage that they had in 2016 there is a very small path for republicans given their under water support from NPAs.   +1 R is 2 points better for Dems than 2014 and 5 points better than 2010.
If this is accurate it‚Äôs very good news for Dems.  Debbie is doing better with 2018 likely voters than 2016 actual voters.  That would suggest the electorate is more democratic this cycle than 2016. https://t.co/lHhsSRZAyn

@PeterSchorschFL @SurveyMonkey 2010 +6 R 	2014 +3 R	Given what we‚Äôve seen from specials (including SD 40 and HD 72) a +1 R Vote share seems very possible.
