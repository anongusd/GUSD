@larryelder @AOC @EcoSenseNow The obsession brainless conservatives have with AOC is hysterically funny!
@CPAC @realDonaldTrump From a clown who wants to censor the media?
When did conservatives turn into a gaggle of whiny fruitcakes?  All these people do is bitch and whine!  		I have suffered through the CPAC stuff, and not one speaker says why conservatism might be good. They just cry about the left!  Such pansies!
@FreedomWorks Remember when conservatives at least used too pretend to care about deficits?

@KnowWhatEyeMeme That's nuts!
All @realDonaldTrump does is cry!  What a pansy!
@thomaskaine5 I dont care if its Donald duck and a grilled cheese sandwich!  Dont be butt-hurt if your candidate loses in the primary, just vote this trash out of office!
@jaredlholt All he is going to do is cry about Democrats.  We have never had a weaker leader!
@icodemath @RealCandaceO @AOC Wow, A "fixed it for you" response.  That's so original.  		Thank you for proving my point about brainless!

@larrygoolsby4 @AOC LOL, You're a weakling son, and a terrible troll.  You dont have the intellect for this!  Get back to me when you finish college (just kidding, of course)
@larrygoolsby4 @AOC You're the one trolling her twitter account.  Its because you're uneducated and brainless,.  You don't even know why you're obsessed with her, you just know that you're supposed to be!  		BAHHHHHh Bahhh lil sheep!
@larrygoolsby4 @AOC That's it, Prove you're not brainless by posting a meme!  		You ARE the average conservative! sheep
@AhearnTim @AOC @RepAOC @TheFive Brainless conservatives are obsessed with this woman and its hilarious!

@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC Yeah, so believing something different than you makes a person anti-american.  You have to be smart enough to realize how weak minded that is!  You post the least thought out fake patriotic drivel because you know a certain part of the base will love it!  Make a real point!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC pointing how how dim a point is does not amount to an insult!  When you spew this fake ownership of patriotism, you prove @aoc 100% correct about being mentally bankrupt!  		"Darrr...you communist anti amerukin...duhhharrr"  		Seriously, Do better!

@ZNEWSNET The Obvious problem with this is that it was not advertised that Michelle was going to be on.  It was a surprise appearance.  So the ratings have nothing to do with her!  		Conservatives just never stop whining!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC Back to my point though, You are obsessed with @AOC because you were told to be.  You're acting like a complete sheep!  This is being spoon-fed to you and you're lapping it up!  		You responded to her tweet just to rant.  How weak is that?
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC So now anybody who doesnt share your exact views is "anti-American"?  At what point did you first begin to hate freedom?  Mood?  Come on man, don't be such a drama queen and have an intelligent exchange		 Do you really have a show, because so far your banter is not very smart!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC So since i have your measured responses, what is the conservative obsession with AOC anyhow?  You clearly didnt care about the subject of her tweet, it was merely HER that got you, going  Why?  		It;'s not as silly as the right's  Soros obsession, but close!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC LOL, Are you actually trying to pretend that most conservatives on Twitter are civil? I can destroy that one by simply linking to conservative posts!  Yesterday i was attacked by a weakling conservative actor who even questioned my service!  		You'll get nowhere with that!
@ChrisSalcedoTX @AOC Yeah, that's some nice drivel right there.  It plays perfectly to the stupidity of the average conservative,, but had absolutely ZERO to do with her tweet.  You're trying way too hard with this one.

@RandomVet 8		Nick sure has lots of bot followers!
@yesnicksearcy HAHHAHAHAH, Wow, You're still crying?  You started this little guy, and you have nothing to show for yourself.  		You wanted to compare success?  You are half the man I am, and the B actor you are today will always be your greatest accomplishment in life!  		Sit boy!

@pauly_pashew34 @yesnicksearcy OOOH, NPC.  Did you come up with that on your own?  I've never heard it before.
@yesnicksearcy I don't have one!  In fact, I have exactly ONE professional credit to my name, and am hoping to hear about the second today!  		You seem a bit obsessed with me now. I am all your cowardly behind wants to talk about?  Why is that...Because i just owned you!  		Sit Boy, Sit!
@yesnicksearcy I have, and you're a coward!  		You, on the other hand, have not!  		It cracks me up when weakling conservatives challenge my service, when you never even considered the idea!  My service to my country does not need your approval, little weakling!  		What have you done?  Degree?
@bulliegirl1959 @yesnicksearcy I'm just a guy who saw yet another conservative post about AOC, and mentioned that it cracks me up!  that sure did send folks into a tizzy.
@JRManinthesuit @yesnicksearcy You're an angry bot!
@yesnicksearcy Honestly Nicky, do you REALLY want to compare our lives?		Where is your degree from?  How about your Master's?  NO?		Have you served your country in combat?  		Lets compare careers Nicky.  That'll be a fun game!
@yesnicksearcy That was the worst attempt at an insult in human history.  Seriously little guy, that was pathetic!  		Its adorable that you got upset enough that you needed to check out my profile!  So predictable and weak!

Pats are getting the equipment in order! https://t.co/lft2nmYJsI
@CGasparino If thats supposed to scare somebody off, you failed miserably!
@JeremyMcLellan I am a Catholic, and those kids are scabs!
@gatewaypundit @JackPosobiec What lie?  The loser made his own bed.  Personal responsibility matters  		It cracks me up how being an asshat is now a standard part of the conservative persona!
@julie_kelly2 Your children should be raised correctly.  If society shuns your child because he is an ass, that is his own doing, and possibly yours for raising such a prick!
@johncardillo HAHAHAHA, Conservatives are such mental weaklings!  		So if pelosi makes an offer and Trump rejects it, then he owns it again?
@annvandersteel @SpeakerPelosi Wow, Hildabeast.  Come up with that all by yourself, did ya?		You're whining for the sake of whining!
@sfdparis25 @eshap Bots should learn there from their!
@WalshFreedom Trump could be caught on tape saying it and his supporters still wouldnt care!
@robertinccnv1 Cleaning the bathrooms doesnt equal a degree!  We both know you're working with no more than a high school diploma, but I get why you lie.  You're right to be embarrassed!
@robertinccnv1 Seriously though, try college.  It wont hurt, I promise!
@robertinccnv1 HAHHAHA, Awwe, Lil guy has his panties all bunched up!  Look at you Cooter....you're having a hissy fit on the internet.  Typical conservative weakling!  		Ooh, Beta cuck, thats so original!  what else have you been spoonfed?  Simpleton!
@robertinccnv1 HAHH, You are the perfect conservative.  You're dumb as a post son!  you are my entertainment and nothing more!  		I'll see you when you're mowing my lawn!
@robertinccnv1 How?, the pansy Blocked me!  		Looks like i got under your skin huh little guy?  		Let me know when you finish college (just kidding, of course)!
@robertinccnv1 @GOP HAHHA, Like all brainless conservatives, the only response your feeble mind can muster is "Duhhhh, Hillary...duhhharrr"		Come on Cooter, you can do better than that!
@GWRepublicans @SteveKingIA @GOPLeader @HouseGOP @PresidentNPerry Are you actually trying to pretend @gop didn't know king is a racist, or that this is the first indication?		The people who voted Kin into office know exactly what he stands for, and that's why they voted for him!
@doughcollector @CR @ChrisCPandolfo What lie was told about King's comments?  The GOP cant suddenly pretend they didnt know King was a racist shidbag.  The people who elected him knew exactly what he stands fr, and that is why they voted for him! This IS conservatism!
@CR @ChrisCPandolfo Typical conservative cowardice!
Why are @GOP acting like they didn't ever hear racism out of Steve King in the past?		The people who voted for him know exactly what King stands for, and that is why they voted for him! Own your trash!
@matty_briggs96 @fungorio @Ihate_Airplanes @KurtSchlichter @GOP LOl, Sure you did,
@doubleiron @KurtSchlichter You didnt pay taxes under either one!  You dont make enough!
@fungorio @Ihate_Airplanes @KurtSchlichter No, You're not!  If you're bottom middle and voting GOP then you're not a bright boy!  If you're in NY like me, then you lose your Salt deduction too.  		You've been on the job 9 years and thankful to be bottom middle?
@jaredlholt Cernovich cant even handle tweets he doesnt like?  The boy is a weakling!
RT @ChuckBecker12: @KurtSchlichter If you supported tax cuts for the rich at the expense of your own retirement and health care, (SS, Medic…
@dustinpg11 @KurtSchlichter Ooh, another highly intelligent zinger from a deep thinking conservative mind.  		Did you come up with that one all by yourself, or did that require help?
@KurtSchlichter If you supported tax cuts for the rich at the expense of your own retirement and health care, (SS, Medicare) then you are a stupid person.		If you supported it at the cost of somebody else's, then you are an evil person.
@Ihate_Airplanes @KurtSchlichter BE honest, You arent benefiting from his Tax cuts, are you?  Most people arent!  		It aint rocket science skippy!
@dustinpg11 @KurtSchlichter And you thought this was an intelligent response?		try college and get back to me!
@KurtSchlichter Did that actually make sense in your head?  		You were desperate to post a response, but you didnt quite put forth an effort on that one.  That was nearly indecipherable
@KurtSchlichter It's called taxes.  Do you really need this explained?		Trump has taken far more from the working class and given it to the wealthy.  This is far more unacceptable!
@AngelaBelcamino Best fan sign ever! https://t.co/FNmGiFkpKp
@THR @billmaher The NPC thing is hilarious.  Conservatives were spoon-fed "NPC", and ran with it like mindless drones!  It's up there with "snowflake", Libtard" and "triggered"		Come on righties, at least be smart enough to come up with your own insults, FCO
@SenRonJohnson More brainless conservative crying!
@KurtSchlichter An honest tone, but we all know Trump is not capable!
What a weakling! https://t.co/zbTFH2I1zh
@freedom_moates It cracks me up watching conservatives lose their minds over this woman.  So funny!
@diamoundgirls1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @marklevinshow @seanhannity @qanon_truther @WeAreOne_Q @daniellauhlig @SaraCarterDC Its old news, and poof of nothing!  You're just a lowly educated rube who will clearly believe anything!
@diamoundgirls1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @marklevinshow @seanhannity @qanon_truther @WeAreOne_Q @daniellauhlig @SaraCarterDC So be honest, You only have a high school diploma, correct?
@diamoundgirls1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @marklevinshow @seanhannity @qanon_truther @WeAreOne_Q @daniellauhlig @SaraCarterDC Afraid?  LOL, Youre brainless if you think Qanon is real?
@diamoundgirls1 https://t.co/Nm3X4hrWd9
@diamoundgirls1 Yeah, that was stupid the first 4 times		https://t.co/DWWQKk4ybl
@diamoundgirls1 https://t.co/bOawxMTJQa
@diamoundgirls1 Yawn		Seriously, Try college!
@diamoundgirls1 @johncardillo No Cooter, I wont.  		Try college and get back to me!
@diamoundgirls1 @johncardillo HAHAHHAHAHA, Qanon?  You're actually that dumb?
@diamoundgirls1 @johncardillo And you suck at this!
@diamoundgirls1 @johncardillo is this the conservative version of comedy?  Keep your day job!
@johncardillo HAHAHAH, Terrible backpedal!  The new congress should subpoena Trump's interpreter.  The orange coward's performance in Helsinki is enough to make him very suspect!
@chuckwoolery Did that make sense in your head?
@johncardillo Well, we cant all be upstanding conservatives! https://t.co/RAOSj1YxV0
@NewsRadio930 Brainless conservatives are the only people denying this!
@RyanAFournier Your point?  I have never heard Chuck say otherwise?
@anita_cule You cant blame a guy for playing to the stupidity of his base!
@RyanAFournier After a school shooting 48 hours is too soon to talk about it!  Make up your weak mind!
@siano2020 Yes, but if he loses the primary his followers need to smarten up and not act like pansies!
@BillDaniel5 @themaxburns @TheRickWilson Trump rejected that, Why lie?
@culttture If you have to ask, you're probably a conservative!
@johncardillo @sethmeyers @LateNightSeth @realDonaldTrump I dont recall conservatives making a big deal of one of their own going on a killing spree in a Pitt Synagogue		Selective outrage is fake outrage!
@ChuckCallesto LOl, What alternate universe are you living in? Seriously, you're on twitter, its half of everything they talk about!  I get why you deny it, and you're right to be embarrassed.
@ChuckCallesto Conservatives are obsessed with race!
@RyanAFournier SOURCE?
@PoliticalShort You are just obsessed with this woman?
@ChuckCallesto I'm In at 32		https://t.co/yoxJYQjSZe
@TaxReformExpert Only a conservative would brag that 58% of America thinks their platform is useless!
@PoliticalShort @AOC Brainless conservatives are obsessed with this woman and its hilarious!  		I think women make conservatives uncomfortable!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @BloombergQuint You're both cowards!
@RobManess @AOC @BlazeTV @JackPosobiec Poor brainless conservatives are obsessed with this woman and its hilarious!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking No, You're actually lying, as is the conservative way.  Outside of their own churches, conservatives give next to nothing!  Giving to your own church is not charity, its self serving!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Who has stopped you from speaking freely?  What is it that you feel you cannot say?  		If anything liberals want conservatives to speak more often.  Be honest about who you are as a group!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Conservatism is absolutely a religion.  You have faith in something you have never seen work, and believe it will save humanity!  You ignore reality and science, like most religious zealots.  Conservatism is 100% a religion!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Conservatives donate to their own churches and nothing else.  Donating to one's own church is a self serving charity at best.  You're paying to keep the lights on and upkeep of the building.  It's not an act of altruism!  		Democrats support their tax dollars actually helping.
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking People might take conservative crying about abortion seriously if conservatives showed any concern for children outside of the womb!
@RyanAFournier Had a democrat president even suggested it you would have lost your empty mind!
@TomFitton @RepJoeWilson @realDonaldTrump @RashidaTlaib How many Republicans voted to admonish Wilson?   - ZERO		So they should have no problem with this?  See how that works?
@JoeKafka1 @TomFitton @LouDobbs @RepJoeWilson @realDonaldTrump @RashidaTlaib Fitton is not a bright boy!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Who mentioned Christianity?  You're all over the place!  		Secondly, if you're a conservative, then you're not really a Christian anyhow!  Jesus would never condone the hateful beliefs of the average conservative.
@madisongesiotto @thehill @realDonaldTrump condoms?
@yaitseric Toronto!  I stinkin' love that town!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Islamic Supremacy?  LOL, Wow.  What other nutter bog talking points do you have?  WOW that was plain stupid!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Where did I support anything?  Conservatives are obsessed with race.  Hatred is the very basis of the conservative platform!  Own your trash!
@songmuddywater @johncardillo @shaunking Who is posting this?  Seriously, dont be so cowardly!
@johncardillo @shaunking Conservatives are obsessed with race!
@JacobAWohl Are you actually this stupid?
Only a conservative could be offended by anti-hate signs!		https://t.co/XezYn5XWyq
@JDaIey Snow (which is so far absent this year), and idiots lighting themselves on fire while jumping on tables at football games!
@HdcTruth @johncardillo So you respond with "duhhh...I know you are but what am I?"		I am surprised you didnt post a meme!
@StefanMolyneux Yeah, because people regularly traveled outside their own cultures years ago...with all those ancient 747's and such!  		Dumbest post ever!
@KurtSchlichter OK, So when was the "woke" talking point issued?  All conservatives are using it now.		NPC passed quickly, snowflake is still out there, but righties are realizing what rubes they are for using it!  Triggered is still running its course.  How long will "woke" last? What Drones!
@realAliTweets https://t.co/VdazVhB50y
@chrispossible @johncardillo @SpeakerPelosi One tweet he's crying that liberals are mocking him for that tweet.  One minute later he is claiming to be some sort of God for it!  		Watching these freaks beg for validation is hilarious!
@johncardillo @SpeakerPelosi Do you ever post anything that isn't just a pansy conservative crying about liberals?
@marcorubio Oh Just Stop!
@HdcTruth @johncardillo https://t.co/G0JGMYsmL6
@HdcTruth @johncardillo Hell, Even pansy Cardillo made an issue of it!
@HdcTruth @johncardillo No, You are one person!  I get that conservative are susceptible to group-think.  Hell, you cant even think up your own insults, even those are spoon-fed to you (Snowflake, NPC, Libtard), but you are only one person!
@HdcTruth @johncardillo Who is we?  Why do conservative have a habit of pluralizing themselves?
@HdcTruth @johncardillo This as in the dancing, or this as in the pathetic conservative crying?  I can easily show both!  So can you, you're just to cowardly to do the google search yourself.  I will humor you though.
@RealJamesWoods @washingtonpost @GOP After all the asinine comment by the orange coward, THIS gets your panties bunched up?
@johncardillo So when brainless conservative cry about a girl dancing, it's intelligent?		You do not come across as a very smart boy!
It is very concerning that our Military leaders and advisers keep stepping down.  It seems to be getting very little coverage in relation to is seriousness.
@chucktodd @LeaderHoyer I am sure he has donors in mind!
RT @john_sipher: Just a reminder. There are diplomats and intelligence officers around the world in places like Peshawar, Baku, Kandahar, J…
@davidfrum While I am a fan of yours David, I can't say I agree with this one.  I knew Hillary had a likability problem from the start.  I remember having discussions with other well educated people considering how this factor would give a buffoon like Trump a chance.  It does matter!
@CNN Term limits are a fake solution to a real problem.  Limits are pointless unless we also change the way campaigns are financed.  Changing the puppet is pointless if the same people are left pulling the strings!
@SteveScalise This policy would change nothing for your voters, but you're not worried about voters.  This would effect your donors!
@realDonaldTrump We have a child as president.  What a sad and weak old man!
@krassenstein Devin Nunes is officially  POWERLESS in the House Intelligence Committee?		I will miss the secret memos!
@ESanderball Another conservative Pansy hiding behind another fake twitter handle.  What a weakling!
@JacobAWohl Says the party that gave us Palin, Bachmann and W?
@philosophrob Conservatives have convinced a large part of America that they should just shut up and accept that employers hold more power than labor!
@WalshFreedom Emergency order would require seizure of private land from ranchers along the border.  Isnt this the type of "tyranny" the militia nuts always cry about?  They should run to the border, locked and loaded, if this happens!
@Darlachic @KurtSchlichter I've thinking about writing a book for conservative audiences.  I simply have to sell them the fake talking points they want to hear and BOOM...Best seller!  		Hell, Sarah Palin did it!
If this is true, he would have to seize private land from ranchers.  Shouldn't our Tyranny hating militia loser type friends be rushing to stop this tyrannical government overreach fully locked and loaded?  		https://t.co/1Vao1Mi3Ky
@KurtSchlichter HAHAHHAHAHA, This is why you are so much fun to mess with!  OMG, are you actually playing down to your audience?  Awesome!
@KurtSchlichter So...... PT Barnum was right!
@KurtSchlichter Why would anybody buy your book after seeing your tweets?  Tweeting is not your friend where book sales are concerned!
@AOC This from the party that gave us George W, Donny, Michelle Bachmann, and Sarah Palin?
@johncardillo Conservatives are so obsessed with this woman and its hysterically funny!
@RyanAFournier Brainless conservatives are obsessed with this woman and its hilarious!
@TaoOfPooh @GrootResists Starting with a 200+ majority and losing it within 2 years is terrible.  She has not shown much spine in the past.  I will be happy if I am proven wrong this time, but I'm not holding my breath!
@prageru If you're dumb enough to believe this, then you likely wont be shamed by anything in the first place!
@GrootResists Yes, she was given the speakership by her peers.  This is regrettable based on her track record.
@realDonaldTrump Just Stop.  These are not the tweets of a stable genius!
@GrootResists I am as liberal as anybody on twitter, but giving the speakership back to Pelosii was weak.  Her track record is horrendous.
@MLeiter42 @LevineJonathan Dont be so cowardly!  All of these people vote republican.
@CurtisHouck @NickFondacaro I'm sure the real reason he was suspended is something different!
@MLeiter42 @LevineJonathan Some?  98% of that Crowd were Trump voters.  I get why you would deny it, you're right to be embarrassed!
@MLeiter42 @LevineJonathan Nobody wants to stop conservatives from speaking.  It's exactly the opposite.  We want conservatives to speak as much as possible.  Let the hatred flow.  Be who you really are without fear! Be open and honest!
@MLeiter42 @LevineJonathan LOlL OK, What planet are you on?  Did you see all the MAGA hats In Charlottesville?  		I get why you would lie.  You're right to be ashamed!
@WeFoundAmerica @LevineJonathan Another conservative genius!  Too easy!
@WalshFreedom Regardless of the topic, anybody who takes Hannity seriously is somewhat dim!
@krewemaynard @erikaho111 @JayCaruso @ErynMYoung Memes are great, they give a voice to people who aren't smart enough to use words.
@TFulk01 @Moose396 @madisongesiotto Yeah, it was pretty weak and pathetic!  I am dealing with it.  What a freaking trash comment!
@WeFoundAmerica @LevineJonathan No, as you well know that is the Trump base at the unite the right rally, right after marching while chanting "jews will not replace us"		You already knew that, so why be so cowardly about it?
@Moose396 @madisongesiotto I assume you're just playing dumb to make a point, it seems all conservatives do that!  		You cant pretend to be a christian when you support policies that directly harm the poor and kids!  if you're a conservative, then you;re not really a Christian.  You're just a conservative!
@Moose396 @TFulk01 @madisongesiotto Get back to me when you finish college (just kidding, of course)
@drawandstrike @HeshmatAlavi LOL, Hillary had no part in the deal.  It was approved by 11 different agencies, and would have happened even if they didnt approve!  Your talking points are just weak!
@AnnCoulter The orange coward get so riled up!
@WeFoundAmerica @LevineJonathan Unite the Right buddy! https://t.co/I2B5caOBOV
@TFulk01 @Moose396 @madisongesiotto Oh Cooter, When trying to insult people, do try to get third grade spelling right!
LOL, WOW, Talk about Narcissism. https://t.co/aUcku6gedQ
@TFulk01 @Moose396 @madisongesiotto You're only working with a high school diploma huh?
@TFulk01 @Moose396 @madisongesiotto How did you get to illegals out of that?  Weird!
@Moose396 @madisongesiotto Its pretty self explanatory.  What has you confused?
@TicoTarasco @LevineJonathan No, Running a car into a crowd and shooting at people with guns is far nicer.  		LOL
@madisongesiotto People will never take conservative crying about abortion seriously until conservatives start showing concern for children outside of the womb!
@JerryFalwellJr Hate preachers are funny!
@LevineJonathan I can give you lots of conservatives marching while shouting "Jews will not replace us"		You're peas in a pod https://t.co/PtBMhwyTir
@KurtSchlichter Oh Kurt, are you actually playing to the stupidity of the average conservative with that one?  That was horrendously weak!
@TaxReformExpert Running into an honest republican can truly be shocking!
