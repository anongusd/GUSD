@TheToddSchulte How likely do you think CIR is if dems get both senate and presidency in 2020?
@nybxniv @HMAesq Agreed, which is my point. If there was a moderate gop speaker of the house, they would have brought it to vote and it would have passed.		The demands the PSC made to vote for Pelosi were good for the country.		If it existed in 2013, theres a chance CIR would have been forced
@HMAesq @GOP @AOC @carloslcurbelo The reason I understand the importance of moderates in politics is that only moderate republicans and moderate democrats in congress were willing to even LISTEN to #E2VisaDreamers like me. 		And @carloslcurbelo, a republican "moderate" actually was the only one to help us.
@HMAesq @GOP @AOC The splinter group mentioned by @AOC is the problem solvers caucus, comprised of an equal number of reps+dem		@carloslcurbelo would agree that what she says about dems on it is same thing extreme reps said about reps who helped DACA and #E2VisaDreamers.		PSC is not the problem.
@HMAesq While what you mention is true, its important to recognize that immigration enforcement+border security aren't black and white,which some dems and @GOP make it seem.		We can't have 0 ICE as @AOC wants		To find the sweet spot and make talk turn into action, we do need moderates
@HMAesq Immigration reform has been worked on for decades to no avail because of drastic differences on both sides.Without moderates from both sides compromising, nothing will ever happen. 		For 60 votes in Senate, there will be some form of border security and enforcement (re:CIR 2013)
@mkolken @HouseDemocrats can no longer use @HouseGOP as an excuse to not add #E2VisaDreamers and #LegalDreamers to their #DreamAct.		https://t.co/vULWKyKwYf		https://t.co/qnv7Tjew0V
@RepYvetteClarke @RepRoybalAllard @NydiaVelazquez Will this new Dream Act include #E2VisaDreamers or #LegalDreamers? 		https://t.co/QrtMkbPto9		https://t.co/wBNtipbd0r
@HMAesq @MarkSKrikorian And also because if you don't let families come, you will lose out on foreign talent and investments that the majority of people support
@TalKopan @David_J_Bier #E2VisaDreamers		https://t.co/o1K0H8xWbw
@HMAesq Very well stated! However, it's important to note that merit based is good thing to have in addition to current family based immigration.		Current laws don't allow a path to citizenship for many deserving of a merit based path. 		No need for one or the other, but we do need both
@sillynotabsurd @CatoInstitute You should read the articles regarding legal dreamers		https://t.co/qnv7Tjew0V		https://t.co/mPyKp2klgs
These kids are #Dreamers too. 		To not include us in all Dreamer legislation is very hypocritical. 		How are we different than DACA kids? Why do we not deserve to stay?https://t.co/ckCbPfwIsl		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA 		@DickDurbin @LindseyGrahamSC @IndivisibleTeam @DefineAmerican https://t.co/Y6mUERQOQ1
@mkolken @clara_belle333 What about visas that are already renewable non-immigrant visas (such as E2)? It seems like a good law would be to allow anyone who has maintained lawful status for 10-15 years to get LPR. 		And if that isn't a part of a potential renewable visa,there will be many #LegalDreamers
@realLindholm @ruthiwest @Nice_Jewish_Boi @pitchfork The exact point of that article is that there are some immigrant children in the same position, without jobs, and path to citizenship.		I am actually worse off than someone with DACA.
@realLindholm @ruthiwest @Nice_Jewish_Boi @pitchfork Just read the article if you want to understand why.
@realLindholm @ruthiwest @Nice_Jewish_Boi @pitchfork Incorrect. Read the article.		I know because I am one who is affected greatly
@TheToddSchulte A great way to start increasing legal immigration is by helping the #LegalDreamers who are already here. 		Maybe create green cards via a merit based system (without other cuts) which allows a higher number of points if you were brought as a child and went to grade school here
@ruthiwest @realLindholm @Nice_Jewish_Boi @pitchfork So his situation was a little different than mine. However, the point is that Dreamers is becoming synonymous with "children of illegal immigrants" when in reality there are many children of legal immigrants who are in the same sotuation. 		Easy fix:	https://t.co/qnv7Tjew0V
@Sunny_Duggineni @mkolken @latinorebels Seriously no one seems to care about these issues (#E2VisaDreamers or #LegalDreamers). 		I don't understand how it ever made sense to require unlawful presence for DACA. 		I wonder if Equal protections clause can apply, since the legal counterparts likely won't be helped @mkolken
@vsabharwal @iSquaredAct It really isn't a poison pill either. The Dream Act had to add that people have to be deportable. What is the purpose of saying that. If u remove that part, everyone who is in the same situation can qualify.
@immlawACHall Ya it's just frustrating when we do get some attention, people just look the other way. It is a very hypocritical situation. Even @newtgingrich has supported us.  		But #UnitedWeDream, #IndivisibleTeam and others continue ignoring.		Protect ALL #Dreamers		https://t.co/vULWKyKwYf
@immlawACHall You know what's worse than a 13 year path to citizenship? 		Being in the same position as #E2VisaDreamers, but being ignored by all major immigration advocates. I qualify for all criteria and cutoffs in original DACA, except I am not undocumented.		https://t.co/qnv7Tjew0V
@ciriacisbeth To be fair, many large issues involving legal immigration are ignored by many immigrants rights activists who focus primarily on issues of undocumented immigrants. 		All immigrants should be treated fairly, and no one should be dehumanized. 		Example: #E2VisaDreamers #DALCA
@carloslcurbelo @HowardSchultz If only ranked choice voting existed, reasonable centrists would have a better chance
@E2VisaReform @newtgingrich Please include us in your discussions publicly as you did in your oped:		https://t.co/vULWKyKwYf		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA #LegalDreamers
@TheToddSchulte If they want immigrants to assimilate, why is it so hard to legalize/give path to citizenship to dreamers? They are completely assimilated.		Someome needs to ask this the next time it's brought up.
@NiskanenCenter @MLaCorte_ Please also push for the inclusion of ALL Dreamers,including those who did not come undocumented.		It shouldn't matter if a child was brought undocumented or not.They all grew up here.All are DREAMers and meet the same criteria. 		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA #LegalDreamers
RT @E2visaDREAMER: @SenatorDurbin Senator,	I agree with you, but when you finally solve this issue, you need to ensure that ALL Dreamers ar…
@TheToddSchulte She also thought immigrants on E2 visas creating a minimum of 2 jobs each doesn't help the economy and America would be better off without them
@SenatorDurbin Senator,	I agree with you, but when you finally solve this issue, you need to ensure that ALL Dreamers are given a permanent solution,not just the Dreamers who came undocumented. 		We are the "forgotten young people" who have been left behind by everyone.		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA
@chuy_A_S @MariaESalinas @UNITEDWEDREAM @DreamersMOMS And what about the #E2VisaDreamers like me who meet the original DACA requirements, but were ineligible because we were not undocumented?		Why does it matter that a child was undocumented when brought here. We have the same stories. We are DREAMers too. 		 #DALCA #LegalDreamers
@DavidJollyFL @armandodkos They should counter with permanent protections for Dreamers. Unfortunately, they likely want to save the issue for 2020.		Either way, it is frustrating as an immigrant in the same position as DACA kids, not being recognized at all. 		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA #LegalDreamers
@TheToddSchulte @samstein Even if it's something democrats like, at this point it'd make sense to say you pass it in the Senate and then we'll talk
@TheToddSchulte @FWDus Thank you for your efforts on this. But please keep pushing and educating them on #E2VisaDreamers, #DALCA, and #LegalDreamers that exist.		#Dreamers should mean ALL children who came at young age and have no path, not just those who came undocumented.		I see all of us as equals.
@ezralevin While I agree with your sentiment, "centrists" do help. Only centrists have acknowledged and tried to help #E2VisaDreamers like me. 		All organizations like @UNITEDWEDREAM or indivisible continue to ignore us. 		Some solutions do require a centrist to 	Look past the status quo
@FWDus @SpeakerPelosi Can we get her to also say that any bill must protect ALL dreamers, not just undocumented dreamers? 		It really does not make sense to exclude a child brought as a non-immigrant if they meet the date criterias		@TheToddSchulte @FWDus
@carloslcurbelo Let's get a national ballot measure for Dreamers
@Skyward_Link @carloslcurbelo @senatemajldr In 2020, they'll say they tried and then it'll be 2024 and so on.		Very few people actually want to solve it.
@TheToddSchulte I think the problem now is that even if WH agreed to the Rounds-King bill (highly unlikely), democrats probably wouldn't support anymore.		Do you think they'd do that anymore with 2020 coming?
@RocCityBuilt @DavidNakamura @Grei_sa @UNITEDWEDREAM, @Grei_sa and others would likely benefit from prolonging the issue. So they keep pushing for deals that won't realistically become law		Also, if they really care about Dreamers, they'd stop ignoring #E2VisaDreamers and #LegalDreamers like me. Very hypocritical
@RocCityBuilt @DavidNakamura @Grei_sa Completely agree.		@DavidNakamura, a small group of dreamers from activist organizations like united we dream don't represent everyone.They need to realize there won't be a "clean dream act" that becomes law. 		Most reasonable Dreamers and Americans would accept border security
@TalKopan @TalKopan		you can help us break this barrier of mainstream media ignoring an obvious flaw with the original DACA , which is being ignored again in a possible permanent fix. 		https://t.co/qnv7Tjew0V		https://t.co/mPyKp2klgs		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA #LegalDreamers
@TalKopan Everyone continues to ignore that there are thousands of "legal dreamers" who don't qualify for DACA. Solution is needed and for ALL children who came at a young age, not just undocumented. 		We don't have ANY time. Many self deport everyday. 		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA
@carloslcurbelo Thank you Congressman! But please use all #Dreamers who meet DACA cutoffs and not just those currently enrolled in DACA. We need to keep building awareness of #E2VisaDreamers and others like us who who meet the merits of DACA, but can't qualify.
@mkolken @David_J_Bier @CatoInstitute @anastasianylon It's alarming that there isn't more pressure on both sides to do an obvious Dreamers for Wall/border security deal.		Both sides will keep using these issues and play politics. If democrats want to help #Dreamers, this is the best chance. If Trump wants a wall, this is his chance
@DavidJollyFL @allinwithchris A good point to bring up would be:	Dems forced shutdown last year over DACA, Trump doing it for wall now. 	Why isn't there more pressure from everyone to solve both DACA and border security together, right now. Politics need to stop.
@gsiskind @terry_cor @iSquaredAct I assume this would me similar for a PharmD? So technically any doctorate-professional education?
@gsiskind Any idea if this would start immediately for the coming year or is it just a proposal?
@KHernandez_DC After 2020, they'll say 2022, then 2024, and so on
@CrisAlexJimenez Please recognize that there are young immigrants in the SAME situation as DACA kids who meet ALL requirements but don't qualify bc they're not undocumented?Please fight for ALL children brought at young age with no path. It is hypocritical to ignore us. 		#E2VisaDreamers #DALCA
@AdriW9 @carloslcurbelo @JuanSaaa @RepMarkMeadows Instead of focusing on "undocumented" who came at young age or "undocumented immigrants with no path," everyone needs to say "ALL children who came at a young age" and "ALL immigrants with no path."	Does it make sense to be ineligible bc you are not undocumented? 	#E2VisaDreamers
@AdriW9 @carloslcurbelo @JuanSaaa @RepMarkMeadows The problem with this is people don't recognize others in the same situation. To fix the broken system, we need to give a pathway to citizenship for ALL young immigrants who qualify (not just undocumented). Same with legal immigrants with no path.		#E2VisaDreamers
@ciriacisbeth And no organizations like @UNITEDWEDREAM want to acknowledge us, even though they know we exist. Similar problem with many democrats. Very hypocritical of them.
@ciriacisbeth I agree, but it's important to recognize that some laws like this+DACA allow undocumented young immigrants to qualify for in state tuition or to work, while a similar young immigrant that has legal status does not receive the same benefit. No work permit either. #E2VisaDreamers
@UNITEDWEDREAM Is there any way you guys could help #E2VisaDreamers?		Kids like me never qualified for DACA, even though we met all requirements, only because we were brought here legally.If the purpose is to help, protect, and allow children who came at a young age to stay, why are we ignored?
@RepLindaSanchez @USCIS Unfortunately, #E2VisaDreamers like me never qualified for DACA, even though I met all requirements, only because I was brought here legally. 		If the purpose is to help, protect,and allow children who came at a young age to stay, why are we being left out? 		We are DREAMers too.
@RepJimCosta @USCIS @HispanicCaucus Unfortunately, #E2VisaDreamers like me never qualified for DACA, even though I met all requirements, only because I was brought here legally.		If the purpose is to help, protect, and allow children who came at a young age to stay, why are we being left out?		We are DREAMers too.
@JuanSaaa @washingtonpost I want to add that there's no reason to leave out #E2VisaDreamers like me who were unfairly denied protection under DACA.		Everyone keeps saying DACA + TPS, but don't realize there are others in exactly the same position. DACA solution needs to include children brought legally

@NoLabelsOrg Please make sure the bipartisan problem solvers caucus recognizes #E2VisaDreamers along with DACA kids.We are in the same position as them.We were even included in three Republican DACA bills,including the compromise bill.Doesn't make sense for any bipartisan bill to leave us out
@ciriacisbeth @tonykchoi Completely agree, but it's even worse when you aren't even included in the conversation. I meet the original DACA cutoffs, but bc im not "undocumented," I can't qualify. While most democrats ignored us, 3 republican DACA bills recognized it and included us. #E2VisaDreamers #DALCA
@RebMiami @carloslcurbelo @rafealcuzr66 @zuckerman_susan @thesweetman33 @Bencjacobs @realDonaldTrump @RepDeSantis The bill's protections for Dreamers were better than the status quo. Congressman Curbelo even helped include forgotten dreamers such as #E2VisaDreamers like me. Almost all democrats have ignored us,even though we are in the same position. @carloslcurbelo's help will be missed.
@SenatorMenendez While DACA helped many young Dreamers, it unfairly excluded #E2VisaDreamers. 		We meet all requirements of DACA, except we're not undocumented,so we don't qualify.We have uncertainty too and are just as American. 		Republicans included us in their immigration bill, why can't you?

@DickDurbin Senator, please start the next Congress right by including #E2VisaDreamers and #DALCA kids along with DACA kids.		We should have been eligible for DACA from the start. 		ALL kids brought at a young age are DREAMers. It is hypocritical to ignore us.
@joannamrod @carloslcurbelo I have never rooted more for a candidate than I did today for @carloslcurbelo, and I don't even live in his district.		He was the only Congressman who listened to my story and tried to help #E2VisaDreamers. Your staff's willingness to help me will never be forgotten.		Thank you!
@julissaarce Curbelo was great for dreamers. He was the only congressman, Democrat or republican, who listened to my story as an #E2VisaDreamers.
@barimanalow @carloslcurbelo @realDonaldTrump The point was hypothetical, based on the assumption that Trump got his way.		Even if they got dual citizenship, are they really citizens if they're thrown out of America at age 21 to another country they've never lived in?
@petrahope156 @carloslcurbelo @realDonaldTrump Most of those other countries let those children become citizens quite easily if they actually live there. But here, those children would have a tough, nearly impossible path.
@barimanalow @carloslcurbelo @realDonaldTrump Just because some other countries have something different doesn't make it right.		How would it be ok to deny citizenship to someone who is born in and grows up in a country, and tell them at 21 to leave and become a citizen of a country they don't know
@JessicaV_CIS @kgcarney @CIS_org And why would any American who is not opposed to immigration at all, be opposed to a child born and raised in the United States having citizenship.		Senseless. Stupid.
@JessicaV_CIS @kgcarney @CIS_org So where does someone born here go to at 18 or 21 if their parents are still in the United States legally, but haven't been able to secure citizenship due to terrible legal immigration laws.		How can a child who was not born in or lived in that other country, be a citizen to it?
@carloslcurbelo @realDonaldTrump It is already astounding that children who grow up here can't find a path to citizenship, but taking away that right from someone who is born here and grows up here is senseless.  How can they be a citizen of any other country?
@David_J_Bier Yes! And after 15 years, apply for citizenship.
@David_J_Bier It protects everyone with daca from deportation?
@TheToddSchulte I think the bigger problem for the country is that this shows how unstable he is that he thinks it's necessary to lie like this to overcome a "loss."		Hard to see progress with such a President.. But hopefully we can get a bipartisan bill
@carloslcurbelo To be fair Congressman, I think that's also the case with many of the far right.		We need a group like the problem solvers caucus to force leadership to accept their plan. Only the people in the middle will be able to come up with a fair plan. We just need to convince them

@RepDerekKilmer Please amend the USA act to include #LegalDreamers/#DALCA kids like me. 		We were included in the bill that failed today, but we need support to be in any future DACA bill as our situation is identical.
@jakchen And also address #LegalDreamers/#DALCA kids who are in the same position as DACA.		We were included in that "compromise" bill for the first time. Need to ensure that going forward, we are included in all bipartisan bills
@pdmcleod Another one a possibility?
@carloslcurbelo Please push another discharge petition and convince @SpeakerRyan and @realDonaldTrump that if they want a wall, and not just use it for an election excuse, any immigration bill will have to be bipartisan.		The hard right is never going to vote on any reasonable immigration bill
@TheToddSchulte I don't get their problem with #LegalDreamers. 		The bill only allows us to apply to a merit based program and get GC in 2025. Not amnesty.. 		While this bill will fail, not having support for this is apalling as any bill that becomes law will be considerably less conservative
@RebeccaRKaplan At this point, everyone needs to realize that the freedom caucus and far right Republicans shouldn't be involved in immigration negotiations if they ever want something to pass. Trump needs to realize this too, if he wants a wall, he will need a bipartisan bill
@lauradfrancis Note that while it allows #LegalDreamers to apply to merit based program, it doesn't grant any immediate protections like it does to DACA kids.		It's a big flaw bc most #LegalDreamers/#DALCA who qualify will be forced to self deport before merit program is implemented in 2025
@RebeccaRKaplan This is the result when the President wants to use it as an election issue
@gsiskind E2 also has no path to citizenship. Needs to be changed

@TomJawetz @carloslcurbelo Will you acknowledge his hard work for #LegalDreamers like me who had been ignored by democrats?		At least acknowledge we exist and are in a similar position as DACA kids and should be included in DACA legislation? Bc all dems have failed to acknowledge us
@SonnyBunch @BilgeEbiri @ericthewheeler Commonsense compromise is definitely dreamers + wall. Problem is he moved the goalposts several times to include his "pillars."

@JessicaASmith8 @RepKinzinger Can you report on #LegalDreamers like me rightfully and finally being included IN HR 6136? 		We are kids of legal immigrants who grew up here all our lives, but age out and have to self deport at 21.		Qualify for all daca requirements, except for being undocumented.
@MarkSKrikorian @MadaGasp @JessicaV_CIS The 300k number is false.		Multiple sources have reported the number below 100k and ranging from 30-75k.		You have to also realize many of the 75k could eventually find other paths to stay. But many also may not, which is why it's not wrong to allow them to apply to merit based
@MarkSKrikorian When @realDonaldTrump says we need a merit based system for legal immigration, 		Why not start with young, high skilled kids who grew up here. 		That's what HR 6136 does, allows kids who were already assimilated with USA to apply to a merit system first.		What's wrong with that?
@MarkSKrikorian Also I want to correct what you're saying about guest workers finagling a way to stay.		My parents came on an E2. They aren't "workers." they hire "American workers" and have created numerous jobs.		But the broken system hasn't allowed a way for them to stay permanently
@MarkSKrikorian How do you define a guest worker?		Because currently the bill includes kids of not what you would typically think of as temporary guest workers. 		They are visas with either immigrant intent (not temporary) or investor visas, which are creating jobs
@RepRaulGrijalva Can you address whether you support inclusion of #LegalDreamers/#DALCA with DACA?		While this bill may be bad, it is important to recognize positives, such as our inclusion for the first time. 		Kids like me have been ignored in the DACA debate even though we have same stories
@RepJayapal Will you affirm support for #DALCA/#LegalDreamers who are excluded from the DreamAct but were included in the republican compromise bill?		If we can be included on the republican bill why not add us to any future DACA bill, especially when our situations are exact the same
@marcorubio Senator @marcorubio,		Do you support #DALCA/#LegalDreamers?
@MZanona Has the modified version even been released?		If they're acknowledging multiple versions, how do they know what's in the modified one if there's no text anywhere
@RepRaulGrijalva While there may be lots of bad parts, you have to recognize that they finally addressed #LegalDreamers along WITH DACA kids.		All of these kids are in a similar position, why leave kids like us out?		#DALCA/#LegalDreamers need to be included in any future bill
@MigrationPolicy However, #LegalDreamers aren't eligible for the temp. Protections. This is a big mistake as most of the legal dreamers who qualify and have been here all of their life would be forced to self deport until they receive greencard in 2025.		Needs to be fixed
@TheToddSchulte At this point they're not actually trying to pass anything (as bad as the bill is). It's a game.		Esp with the Trump tweet giving a pass for voting no		If he was serious about getting a fix, he'd tweet a full out support for a bipartisan fix and stick with it (unlike last time)
@RepLeeZeldin Or maybe release them with ankle bracelets? 		Or some other humane way of tracking them since those wanting asylum haven't "entered illegally"
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump The law allows anyone who crosses the border, whether through a port of entry or in the middle, to apply for asylum.		LAW says they can, so they're not "crossing illegally." 		What you are saying, would be illegal for the government to do, as that is not the law.
@jamiedupree Is this the Goodlatte being voted on?		Is it a modified version? Since there was a big argument over that
@ACLU Can you also fight for #DALCA/#LegalDreamers?		We are in the same position as DACA kids, but have been ignored until HR 6136. While this bill is bad in some ways, we hope our inclusion in this can get us support for future bills with DACA
@Barred10 @MarkSKrikorian There's no path for us to "apply."		This bill give us a MERIT based path to apply for permanent residence. 		Even the president supports it. It's not amnesty. It's a merit based program to allow young people who have grown up here a chance to apply.		Bc right now it doesn't exist
@Barred10 @MarkSKrikorian I can prove it..		The point is that the laws are broken and it would essentially make someone (let's say who came when they were 6 months old) who grew up here, self deport at 21.		This same child would have qualified for DACA if they were undocumented
@JessicaV_CIS You realize that some of the E/H/L kids lost status and qualified for DACA and got protection.		Those of us who were fortunate to maintain status do not. 		Any non anti-immigrant person will see this.
@JessicaV_CIS This is false. The number is very small.		I still don't understand how you think two kids who meet the same requirement (let's say came here since age 2), should be treated differently.		And in this case, the one that came documented should self deport...
@Barred10 @MarkSKrikorian We would basically need to self deport because we were able to maintain our status till now.	If I was undocumented in 2012, I would've qualified for DACA.	So you tell me how it's unfair to include legal dreamers who otherwise are in the same position as DACA kids and grew up here
@AjayGuptaTweets @JessicaV_CIS Why do you think #LegalDreamers shouldn't qualify?		We are in the same position as DACA kids, except we came LEGALLY. 		Most Americans would agree with this..
@Barred10 @MarkSKrikorian #LegalDreamers or #DALCA kids are the result of a terrible legal immigration system.		We came as young children just like DACA kids and have spent all our lives here. Only difference is we came LEGALLY. 		Due to bad laws, we have no path even though we've spent all our lives here
@susanpai Current immigration law has no loopholes for me.		Which is why legal dreamers need to be included with DACA. We meet the criteria of the original DACA and cutoff dates, but don't qualify bc we are not undocumented
@susanpai My entire point is that if we can't get an easy path, it's not bad to compromise for a merit based path which still provides certainty.		This bill does lack inclusiveness because of how restrictive it is, but something similar with taking all dreamers in wouldn't be terrible
@susanpai I understand what you mean. I myself am looking for a path.		But I still haven't found any requirement in the bill that requires a family sponsor to apply to the merit based system. 		It's indirect path and I agree a more direct one is necessary for DACA and #DALCA/#LegalDreamers
@gary4205 @SarahPierceEsq Legal Dreamers are "legal"		No illegal..
@MatthewPowell24 @BillyCorben Agreed. @carloslcurbelo has been helpful to people who other congressmen, including democrats ignored.		No one would listen to our story as E2 kids and legal dreamers, except congressman curbelo.		Democrats haven't even acknowledged kids like me as dreamers yet.
@susanpai Yes that's correct. However, you said there is no pathway.		There is a pathway. It requires a minimum of 12 points, which most daca kids who qualify would easily get.		I agree that the date cutoffs are restrictive and many other restrictions are present. 		However, pathway exists
@SarahPierceEsq But not allowing the #DALCA/#LegalDreamers to qualify for temporary protection makes no sense. Most who qualify would be forced to leave.
RT @SarahPierceEsq: We estimate that there are between 30,000 and 75,000 “legal” dreamers (or #DALCA) who would benefit from the so-called…
@susanpai You're not telling facts. I agree that the bill isn't great for all dreamers.		But I can't grasp this false info
@susanpai I don't understand how you don't get this as a lawyer...
@susanpai You are mistaken.. Read it. There's a merit based system for daca dreamers and legal dreamers. I sent you the text with page number
@David_J_Bier I hope in the future she can also cite that @David_J_Bier posts on legal dreamers and why we need to be included
@susanpai @RRRiling I've read all 299 pages and I'm telling you that you're incorrect.		DACA and legal dreamers get a path to citizenship through a merit based program only they can apply for.		#DALCA/Legal dreamers like me have never been helped before.
@RRRiling @susanpai She's lying. There is a path to citizenship. 		People on both sides need to stop giving false info or we're never going to get bipartisanship to actually get a solution.		This bill may have bad parts, but no need to lie to show that
@susanpai I don't understand why you're giving incorrect info.		I agree that the bill has bad policies and excludes many dreamers, but to say this doesn't have a path to citizenship is lie. 		Go to page 201:	https://t.co/rjXZZNkR2D
@susanpai There is a path. It's through the merit based system
@MarkSKrikorian @fredbauerblog How do you guys expect to achieve your anti immigration agenda if you can't even support this bill, which is already restrictive on immigration.		It achieves most of President Trump’s goals and wouldn't even pass in this form in the senate.
@RyanCostello Also, please work to fix a minor problem in the current bill.	Legal dreamers like me were finally addressed by allowing us to apply for the merit based program. However, we weren't given the same "nonimmigrant/bridge visa" until we can receive green cards in 2025. This is neeeded
@RyanCostello Thank you for understanding this.		Please call them out to your colleagues because it seems that a lot of them can't speak up and tell them the truth.
@theJenMartin @carloslcurbelo He's trying to ensure "something" can pass the House. Obviously this bill will need to change in the senate.		I think there's hope that even if a bad bill passes the House, because the senate needs some democrats, the bill would get a lot better

@SarahPierceEsq Important: in this bill, DALCA kids (E/H/L visas) do not get immediate protection or bridge visa like the DACA kids do. This would make most kids who would qualify to leave. 		There obviously needs to be a lot of changes in the bill, but bridge visa protection for DALCA is needed
@MigrationPolicy @SarahPierceEsq Important: in this bill, DALCA kids (E/H/L visas) do not get immediate protection or bridge visa like the DACA kids do.

@DickDurbin Senator, I am American in every single way too.		Yet I'm not included in your dream act. 	As bad as the republican compromise bill is, they included me. 		Why can't you add us to the Dream Act?
@Mikes_idea @JohnAyr12294351 @benyc @NumbersUSA You understand that this bill is a super hard right, anti immigration bill which is already a longshot to pass.		Includes all Trump goals. The fact that there are people like you who still don't support it reassures me that they'll never achieve their anti immigration agenda
@TheToddSchulte "children of certain guest workers"		My parents aren't guest workers. They've invested in businesses and created American jobs. Also, not "amnesty." MERIT BASED. 		If @NumbersUSA can't support this hard right bill, how do they expect to ever achieve their anti immigration agenda
@Mikes_idea @benyc @NumbersUSA He is lying.		First, the plan isn't even an amnesty. It allows a possibility of applying to a merit based program. 		Second, any year there is no funding for the wall, the program is paused. 		So he's definitely lying. #FakeNews

@MarkSKrikorian Also, you do understand that many DACA kids came as children of these legal immigrants and then lost status and chose to stay legally.		How do you think it's right to include them, but exclude some who tried to stay legally, if they both meet the requirements

@David_J_Bier "he misspoke." Making this a joke.. 		https://t.co/HVoTS3xhmT
@David_J_Bier I don't think he knows what he is saying..		Just says words
@RepJudyChu But it also allows Dreamers that were excluded by democrats in other DACA bills.		Will you support our inclusion in future bills? We are DREAMers too.		https://t.co/n4waFDDuUz
@David_J_Bier Curious if this is something Republicans would be in favor of fixing to allow those applicants to receive GCs.		I also don't understand why there needs to be an escrow. 		Temporary increase in GC for Dreamers is ok, bc not all visas they're canceling r redistributed permanently
@kelsey_snell Wouldn't surprise me if they came out an hour from now saying he didn't understand the question or what bill it was.		I doubt he's looked at it.

@nyc_sunp @kkunapareddy1 @mikedebonis @seungminkim Under the current draft, we don't get a bridge visa. Only the DACA population does.

@JessicaV_CIS If these aren't the type of people you'd want in America, then who are?		Seems like the answer is no one because you just want less immigrants.		Use DACA kids as pawns for anti immigrant agenda.
RT @dacaleftmebehin: @JessicaV_CIS I'm not sure what's your agenda here...Do you realize that there are many E2 kids who are dreamers today…
@nyc_sunp @kkunapareddy1 @mikedebonis @seungminkim That's what I thought it would be but the draft is worded to seem like the bridge is only for DACA
The Director of Policy at CIS thinks an immigrant creating 2 jobs doesn't help the economy.		Tells you about how anti immigrant ideology makes you think. Wants less immigrants at any cost. Who cares about thousands of American jobs		@CatoInstitute @FWD_us https://t.co/92JcUmdHFt
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin In fact, some who were kids on these visas aged out and became undocumented, and qualified for DACA. Some chose to not become undocumented and tried to find a legal path that doesn't exist		How can you blame someone who grew up here since they were a child to want to be American?
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin We are not entitled to it. We are saying that there should be changes made to the E2 visa to make it better. We aren't asking for amnesty. We are asking for an earned path which results in the creation of American jobs.		But how can you argue kids aren't in similar position
@JessicaV_CIS It makes a difference when there are thousands of E2 businesses. It is a minimum of 2, some create more. 		The point is that they do make a difference and it'd be fair to give them a path to citizenship. It's a long and fair path.
@JessicaV_CIS There's a bill right now to allow 10,000 GC per year for E2 visa holders who have created atleast 2 American jobs for 10 years. 		A 15 year path to citizenship seems very fair for job creators.
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin How can you have a bill and say if you came at a certain age, and have lived for a certain length of time, you can get a path to citizenship. 		But you MUST have come here illegally.		Any logical person would see that it is fair to have the option open to anyone that qualifies
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin @RandPaul No one would run on this issue because rarely any Republicans run on pro immigration. 		So do you think only problems people run on are worth fixing? If they didn't know about a problem when they ran, they are not able to fix it once they're in office?
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin Additionally, it's not bring "slipped in." It's a clear part of a short outline that the bill is being drafted from. Everyone knows about it. Not being sneaked in at all.		Privately, there is support for us. However, politically, they were scared of people like you. Until now.
@JessicaV_CIS @dacaleftmebehin Multiple members of congress have made a case for this. It just doesn't get media coverage. If we did get fair coverage, I'd be surprised if more than 90% of Americans didn't support us.		@RandPaul spoke at a rally yesterday in support of including legal immigrant kids
@JessicaV_CIS That's what the E2 visa does in most cases.
@JessicaV_CIS You are using anecdotal evidence to say many hire family members.		By law they are required to prove they have American employees. 		Contrary to what you are saying, MANY create MANY American jobs.

@petronas866 Your tweet shows how little you know about the issue.		If you read any of my tweets, you would see that I am not undocumented.
@JessicaV_CIS Can you elaborate on the E2 visas?		They make investments and are required to hire American employees. I don't see how that's something people would be against. 		Also, if you support the DACA kids, how do you not relate the E/H/L kids with the DACA kids?They have similar stories
@Darling70006378 @JessicaV_CIS There is no "wait." If there was a "wait" or a "line," they'd certainly be in one.
@DebbieforFL Would you support us like Congressmen Curbelo has? Because no Democrat has helped us. 		Saying you want to help DACA kids, but ignoring kids like us that are in the same position is very hypocritical @HouseDemocrats 		https://t.co/n4waFDDuUz
@DebbieforFL @carloslcurbelo has not failed to protect dreamers.		He has gone above and beyond what many Democrat have done.		He didn't ignore E2 kids and other children of legal immigrants like most democrats.		You can disagree with him on other issues, but he has done a lot for Immigration
@JessicaV_CIS I take it that you don't support a path for DACA kids either.		The point is that if DACA kids are being helped, it makes sense to include us. 		If most Americans knew about the E2 visa, they'd probably agree that it should include a path to citizenship.
@OnTheRocks_2013 @SarahPierceEsq It looks like the draft fixes that too
@JessicaV_CIS It's not "guest workers and kids." it's for children of immigrants who age out. Only the kids, not parents 		My parents are on an E2 visa. They aren't "guest workers." They have businesses and hire Americans but they still can't get citizenship		It's definitely fair to include us
@HispanicCaucus @SpeakerRyan @RepLujanGrisham Will you make sure that E2 kids and other children of visa holders will be included?		We are included in the new GOP compromise bill, but not on the Dream Act or USA Act.		Is it not hypocritical to support DACA, but ignore #DALCA? 		https://t.co/n4waFDDuUz
@carloslcurbelo 		pathway concept B says that we must wait for 5 years before we apply into the newly developed merit based program. While DACA kids will have certainty with the conditional status, it seems that E/H/L kids would not have that conditional status.		Please fix this
@carloslcurbelo 		I noticed something in the draft of the compromise bill. 		It seems that E2 kids would not be eligible to get an immediate conditional visa like DACA kids for 6 years. This would be vital for me and others who wouldn't have another way to stay for 5 years
@mikedebonis @seungminkim So would the children of E2/H4 be able to get a temporary 6 year status too? If they have to wait 5 years to apply in the program, many could lose status by then. 		That doesn't really solve the problem for most people right now if it won't protect them temporarily..

@joe_kehoskie @SarahPierceEsq Non immigrants exist in many different ways.	My parents came on an E2 visa which doesn't lead to permanent residency, but can be renewed indefinitely. Even if someone grew up here all their life, they'd age out at 21 and would not be able to get citizenship.		Similar to DACA kids
@DickDurbin Is there a reason why children like me can't be included in the #DreamAct when even the new Republican compromise bill will include me?		All legal nonimmigrant children need to be included. 		https://t.co/n4waFDDuUz
Thank you @carloslcurbelo for supporting E2 kids and other children of legal nonimmigrant with DACA kids.		We had been ignored for too long by most people. 		Now any DACA solution must include all of these kids. https://t.co/jEIapKTsUI
While this should have been the case from the start, I hope this is the start of children of legal nonimmigrant being recognized in the future even if this bill fails.		It was hypocritical to support DACA kids but ignore "DALCA" kids.		Take note @DickDurbin @LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/jEIapKTsUI
@MoveOn Dream Act excluded children of legal immigrants who age out at 21 from their status, even if they had been here as long as DACA kids.		This new bill includes kids like me.
@MoveOn While I agree that there are anti immigration policies that will be included in thisand the Dream Act alone would be better, I hope people will realize by seeing this bill that there are children other than DACA kids who are in the same position, but came with "legal" parents

@leedsgarcia Not just those 800,000 dreamers or the 400,000 people with tps. There are kids in the same position as dreamers who are being ignored by most people. This is a chance to have E2 kids like me to get included in legislation.		#E2VisaDreamers

@DebbieforFL This is false. @joannamrod 		@carloslcurbelo has done more for Dreamers than most democrats.		He has been one of the few congressmen to help #E2VisaDreamers and include E2 kids in his DACA bill. Most don't know there are others in same position as DACA kids who aren't helped

Does it make any sense to not include #E2VisaDreamers in the legislation for DACA? All of us meet the criteria and cutoffs set. Our only fault? we aren't "deportable" so we cannot qualify.		Does this make any sense? @dickdurbin @JeffFlake
E2 Visa holders are immigrants who make investments in the US and hire American employees. They must renew their visa every 2-5 years. They currently have no path to citizenship. Their children, #E2VisaDreamers must leave when they turn 21 years old,even if they came as infants
That's incorrect, Senator @LindseyGrahamSC, they do exist.		They are E2 Visa Holders. They are investors who hire American employees but never get a path to citizenship.

@JeffFlake Senator, by looking at these points, it would seem that #E2VisaDreamers like me would qualify, because I've been here since 2005 from the age of 9. However, I know in the fine print, kids like me who are not "deportable" will be excluded. 		Please ensure that we can qualify.

@EWErickson DACA eligible should include E2 kids. There's only about 50k of us and the only reason we don't qualify is bc we aren't immediately "deportable"
@ak_bala @shikhadalmia @SIIA_US @immivoice Actually E2 visa never leads to greencard. It's one of the things many don't know. There is no pathway to citizenship for E2s

@TheToddSchulte I don't understand how they justify diversity lottery/family based bc of DREAMers. 		They can't immediately sponsor anyone.		Should have been:Pass a dreamer/border security legislation and then work on rest with CIR bill that can fix other ignored problems like nonimmigrant visas
@joannamrod @MiamiHerald @HispanicCaucus Exactly. I met @hispaniccaucus member and told my story as an E2 kid who doesn't qualify for DreamAct despite being in the same situation.He said he can't help. @carloslcurbelo and staff have been incredible. Hope they would seek ideas from others bc E2 kids are being left behind
@BinalVaid @SenateDems @SenSchumer @SenatorDurbin @JeffFlake @LindseyGrahamSC Why end any chain migration? It doesn't make sense to end chain migration for overseas visas. If anything, they should only end the ability for dreamers to sponsor parents. Otherwise, this deal would hurt other aspects of legal immigration much more
@HMAesq I would love the opportunity to do something like this again. I remember looking it up and considering doing it after graduating.
@TheToddSchulte I think that just like how Trump has said that any DACA deal must include the WALL, democrats need to take a clear stance, that absolutely no cuts to legal immigration, other than possibly switching diversity to merit based for those same countries.
@BenjySarlin @TheToddSchulte many people don't know that there are a lot of DREAMers in the same situation, but don't qualify for DACA. Even though I'm not undocumented, I have to self deport myself, even though I've spent all my life here. Same situation, but left out. This is our chance but we need help
@LindseyGrahamSC @taylor_reidy There are more Dreamers than just Daca recipients. Many who have been here from a young age at no fault of their own couldn't qualify for DACA bc they weren't undocumented.E2 kids like me don't have a path either. We are already in the Daca bill with most republican cosponsors
@AP @AlexNowrasteh Hopefully the protections for "young immigrants" will include E2 kids.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Please include E2 kids in Dreamer legislation. We are already included in the DACA bill with the most Republican cosponsors, in @carloslcurbelo RAC Act.	We are DREAMers too. https://t.co/7cdI9vMp19
@ezralevin Something that keeps getting lost in debate of how many dreamers will be included in daca legislation are E2 kids like me who would have qualified for original DACA. Please ensure kids like me are included.
@David_J_Bier Pathetic leadership.
@ChrisCoons Please help include E2 kids, many of whom could qualify for original DACA cutoff and age requirements. 		We are DREAMers too.
@GinaGenochio @carloslcurbelo They all came as children. At the average age of 6. Some even as young as 1. They have stayed here since, for an average of 20 years.	The point isn't that they currently qualify as children, it's that they came at a very young age and have lived here since. Essentially Americans
@carloslcurbelo While this article talks about only including children who qualified for original DACA, please keep fighting for E2 kids. Many of us met all criteria of original DACA too!		Thank you for your hard work on this issue    Congressman!
@tarastrong Thank you!
@carloslcurbelo Please make sure E2 kids are included! Thank you for your help Congressman!
@HispanicCaucus Well, in reality do their agreements mean anything? Didn't he promise @JeffFlake a vote?
@a_moriarty But obviously, some have a very anti immigration agenda. I don't understand how the other senators are even taking them seriously

@EndDeportations I wouldn't qualify for any DACA bill except @carloslcurbelo RAC Act and @JeffFlake S2199 + S1937. There is no reason E2 Dreamers should be left off any DREAMer solution.
@treyrama @foxandfriends @Jim_Jordan @SenateMajLdr CHIP funding is a no brainer. It can be passed on its own, just like military funding. Republicans complaining about dems blocking funding for military, but if they want, they shouldn't have objected. In 2013, when Republicans shut it, dems allowed military funding to pass
@treyrama @foxandfriends @Jim_Jordan @SenateMajLdr They didn't shoot down CHIP. They have been trying to reauthorize it for several months. Republicans are playing more politics than Democrats.
@foxandfriends @Jim_Jordan No. Democrats offered to vote for funding the military completely, multiple times. @SenateMajLdr objected to it.

@BradCrofford @TheToddSchulte Didn't @clairecmc try to offer full military funding throughout a shutdown, but was objected by @SenateMajLdr.		There already is a compromise.
@AlexNowrasteh @morar I know! I agree with that. I was just saying that the details in the point system is more messed up. If there was ever a true merit based system, where anyone could apply, the point system in that bill would need a lot of work, especially as it relates to education
@AlexNowrasteh @morar regarding the point system, there are even more flaws. If RAISE act were law, when I apply, I would have completed a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and a 2 year residency in the USA, but would receive only 1 point for education. There are more flaws and some other ways to make it fair
@ScottMGreer "child immigrant" means they immigrated here as a child. Just like everyone else, they also grow up. 		Are you saying that someone brought  as a baby shouldn't be considered a child immigrant because they've spent their entire life here and are now not a child		Pathetic argument
@sruthitsp @TheToddSchulte I agree they should be included.	I am a one. But the Goodlatte bill does more damage, even if it directly helps another group of people.
@sruthitsp @TheToddSchulte This is a very unfair question. Someone can support a part of the terrible bill. The Gop bill, if you are referring to Goodlatte's bill, cuts legal immigration drastically.
@AngelRafPadilla @SenatorDurbin Will you help advocate for E2 Dreamers? We are already included in 3 Republican DACA bills, including the RAC ACT, which had the most Republican cosponsors. Many DACA kids used to be E2 kids, and we are in the same situation. Please help us

@theJenMartin Please fight to include E2 kids too. We are already included in the DACA bill with the most Republican cosponsors, but left off the DreamAct
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo The answer is, THEY CAN'T
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo They reason they do so, is because our parents contribute a lot to the economy.
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo Here is a thought. Go understand Immigration. You can't just APPLY FOR CITIZENSHIP. If I could, if the millions of Dreamers could, why would they not?
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo Do you know how bad that would hurt the economy? The effort that would take. The potential taxes that would go away? 		Would never happen like that. However, many families would be destroyed
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo I have been here all my life. Had to switch to a student visa or self-deport. Once I graduate, I'll have to leave. You understand that it is bad for the economy to let people like us leave? went to public school here, the government would benefit from us contributing to economy
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo you understand that they aren't actually going to deport millions of kids right? It just makes their lives worse, the ability for them to contribute to the only country they know worse. All reputable studies, including the CATO Institute, say Dreamers would help the economy
@ciriacisbeth DreamActNow for the 2.5 million immigrant youth PLUS the ones that are left out, but are DREAMers. Please work with subsets of Dreamers to ensure we are not left out. E2 kids deserve to be in it, and are already in some REPUBLICAN bills. Need to make sure we are on the final one
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo Businesses expand, relationships grow, connections to the country get stronger. It isn't as easy as you think.	Also, the argument here is for us, E2 kids, to be in any Dreamer legislation, IF there is one (which I strongly agree, that there should be)
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo Because they like this country and believed they could find a permanent status, but the terrible immigration system has made it impossible.
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo My cousin came here when she was 1. She is now 17. She will have to leave the only country she has known if E2 kids aren't included. Parents are legal and she is also legal. The DREAMers issue is about CHILDREN though. We are just saying that E2 kids like us are in same situation
@GodOfKekistan @dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM @carloslcurbelo No, they are actually here legally on an E2 visa. This visa does not lead to permanent status but is constantly renewable. E2 visa holders invest in businesses and hire American employees. Their children, no matter how young when they came, have to self deport at 21
@JuanSaaa Just like only few knew about the issue, RIGHT NOW, only a few know about mine.	I am a DREAMer, but ignored by most. Please help include E2 kids in DREAMer legislation. We are already on the bill with the most Republican cosponsors. Need more awareness to make it on final bill

We were included on the DACA bill with the most republican cosponsors (RAC ACT by Curbelo and S 2199 and S1937 by Senator Flake), but left off rest https://t.co/MviytIARQl

@DefineAmerican Fact: E2 DREAMers like me are left off the DreamAct, while being included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors. 		Many DACA dreamers used to be E2 kids. If we are already counted as DREAMers in a republican daca bill, why not advocate for E2 DREAMers?

@carloslcurbelo Congressman, you may be our last hope EVER, for getting help for E2 kids. Please push for our inclusion. How are we not DREAMers? I came when I was nine, 12 years ago. My cousin came when she was one, 16 years ago. We are both left off DACA bills and have no path
@dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @DickDurbin @standwithraul @RepJayapal @ChrisCoons @UNITEDWEDREAM @ezralevin @DefineAmerican @carloslcurbelo @FWD_us There has been a lot of conversation on whether the cutoff should be 2014 or 2012 and whether the age should be 16 or 18. Well choose any of those and E2 kids still qualify. Does it make sense to leave off children who came here 15 years ago? It includes TPS kids, so why not E2?
@dacaleftmebehin @ciriacisbeth @DickDurbin @standwithraul @RepJayapal @ChrisCoons @UNITEDWEDREAM Silent along with other groups like Indivisible @ezralevin and @DefineAmerican. It's astonishing that even though we are already included in the DACA bill with the most republican cosponsors by @carloslcurbelo, they won't help.

@AFLCIO @LacyClayMO1 There are more people in the same situation but are being ignored. What about E2 kids? We are already on the daca bill with most republican cosponsors, but are being ignored
@sardarp2018 So just because we aren't getting what we want, you'd wish bad on kids who are deserving as well? It's not going to be a straight green card. It will be a conditional resident, followed by green card and then citizenship.		Others need to be addressed as well though.
@sardarp2018 For a bill that comprehensive, it should include a real permanent solution for Dreamers. And also solve problems like the one you are talking about. Have you read the bill? A lot of unnecessary stuff. 		Regardless, it has no chance of passing. Not a serious bill
@sardarp2018 @David_J_Bier @CatoInstitute Goodlatte's bill is terrible. Even though I do not benefit from Daca kids receiving a pathway to citizenship, they do deserve it just like we do. Just because some deserving people are left out, it doesn't mean all should be. But that doesn't mean there should be no effort for us

@ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM My cousin came to the United States when she was 1 year old. She is 17. DACA doesn't help her. Dream Act won't. However, @carloslcurbelo RACact would. All I'm asking is for help from big organizations to push for inclusion of E2 kids on any DACA deal.
@ciriacisbeth @UNITEDWEDREAM I have contacted almost everyone on @UNITEDWEDREAM board. Not one reply.		Many daca kids were once E2 kids. It makes no sense to leave us out. Especially when we are already included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors by @carloslcurbelo.
@carloslcurbelo thank you for having the courage to support a smaller subset of DREAMers like E2 kids. I really hope you can help convince others for our inclusion. We are DREAMers too.
@ciriacisbeth Agree wholeheartedly. However, it still hurts DREAMers like me who can't even find help amongst dream act activists. All children who came at no fault of their own and have no path deserve this. But @UNITEDWEDREAM and other groups will keep ignoring E2 kids.

@pwolgin any idea where text of this can be found?
@RepPeteAguilar @HurdOnTheHill Please make sure that the final version of this includes E2 kids, just like the DACA bill with the most Republican cosponsors, RAC Act by @carloslcurbelo
@ezralevin Can you help fight for E2 kids to be included in DreamAct? This is our last chance. Please help us. It makes no sense to exclude us when we are included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors
@CrisAlexJimenez can you please help push for inclusion of E2 DREAMers on the final DACA solution. We were included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors. Why not add us to the new DREAM Act.
@Alyssa_Milano Thank you for fighting for the Dream Act, but please also help push to include E2 kids in DreamAct. We were included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors, but left off the DreamAct. In same position as DACA kids so need to make sure we make it.It's our only chance
@JeffFlake Please make sure that E2 kids like me are included in the final DACA deal. We have u controversial Republican support by being included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors and also your S2199 and S1937. Please ensure that we make it. We are DREAMers too
@carloslcurbelo @POTUS Thank you congressman for your continued leadership on this issue. Please ensure that E2 kids like me make it onto any DACA bill.
@ivette_amg @votolatino @shevotesil Please speak up for E2 kids who are left of DREAM ACT.
@AdyBarkan @Alyssa_Milano @CrisAlexJimenez @tarastrong Can you speak up for the voice of E2 Kids who are excluded from the DREAM ACT, but included in the DACA bill with the most republican cosponsors by @carloslcurbelo? There are E2 kids who came as 1 year olds and have no pathway, just like DACA Dreamers. Why not add us?
@carloslcurbelo Please help ensure that E2 kids are included in the final DACA bill. Please help convince @HispanicCaucus, @JeffFlake, @SenBennetCO and @DickDurbin
@RepKinzinger I live not too far from your district. Please do what you can to help ensure that E2 kids like me make it on the final version of any Dream Act or Daca bill. E2 DREAMers are included in the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors but not in DreamAct
@DickDurbin If E2 kids aren't helped this year with the other DREAMers, we won't ever be helped. Why leave us out when the Daca bill with the most Republican cosponsors (RAC act by @carloslcurbelo) includes E2 DREAMers? Please add us to your new bill.We are in the same position as DACA kids
@DickDurbin Senator, if the argument for DreamAct is that young people brought to this country as children deserve a chance to built their future, why ignore E2 kids like me? @carloslcurbelo and @JeffFlake added us to their DACA bills. Please add E2 DREAMers to new Dream Act
@standwithraul It's a shame that they won't take action to protect DREAMers. However, some like @carloslcurbelo have been doing a lot. In fact, E2 kids like myself are included in his DACA bill, which is cosponsored by the most Republicans. Why not add E2 DREAMers to DreamAct? Please help us
@DickDurbin Will you help ensure that E2 kids, who are included in the DACA bill with the most Republican cosponsors, are included in your new Dream Act?
@ezralevin Please help fight for E2 DREAMers. We need all the help we can get to ensure we make it onto the new Dream Act.
@IronStache @repjohnlewis Please help bring awareness to E2 DREAMers like me. I am included in 3 republican DACA bills, but left off the DreamAct. If E2 kids are supported in the Daca bill with most republican cosponsors, why not add them to the Dream Act?
@RepBarragan Will you help E2 Dreamers? I am left off the Dream Act, but included in 3 Republican DACA bills. Please help include E2 kids on any updated Dream Act for next year

@DickDurbin Sixteen years ago, I came to the United States for the first time at the age of 6. I have resided here permanent since 2005 and have not been able to get citizenship. Dream Act won't help me. Please add E2 kids to the Dream Act like the Daca bill with most republican cosponsors
@NatalieBrandK5 @KING5Seattle Please help bring awareness to E2 DREAMers who are left off the Dream Act, but included in republican DACA bills

@AdyBarkan @popdemoc	Please help advocate for E2 kids inclusion in DreamAct. This is our only chance to be helped and we have bipartisan support +have inclusion in 3 republican DACA bills. Why not help include us in DREAMact?
@ezralevin Support from you for E2 kids could make the difference. If we aren't helped with Dream Act, we will never be helped.	Does it make sense to leave us out when E2 DREAMers have the same story as DACA dreamers. Especially when we are supported in 3 republican DACA bills

@TheToddSchulte We have tried hard to do this and continue to do so. Just need a large organization to join to make it heard louder.		Based on convos, this will be hard to get in as an ammendment, but if it is in the original bill, it is likely to stay.

@_coloradobabe @realDonaldTrump @congressdotgov @carloslcurbelo @JeffFlake @DickDurbin I meet all criteria of DACA, but had alegal status. There are kids who came to USA at a young age with their parents legally in certain non immigrant statuses. Some of these never lead to citizenship. So kids have temporary status here for their whole life, but self deport at 21
@_coloradobabe @realDonaldTrump @congressdotgov @carloslcurbelo @JeffFlake @DickDurbin My parents came on an E2 Business Visa. They are documented. But the kids they bring along "age-out" when they turn 21, and must self-deport or they become undocumented. Basically same situation as DACA for kids involved		Please read my full story here:	https://t.co/XEpUg2EZ0i

@thehill @SenatorLankford There are DREAMers who are NOT recognized. I came 12yrs ago but am worse off than unlawful dreamers, even with legal non immigrant status
@FoxNewsOpinion @SenThomTillis Solution must include children of legal non immigrants.Been here legally for 12yrs,with no pathway.RAC act might include me but needs fixing
@SenatorDurbin DreamAct needs to include legal non-immigrant children. I've been here for 12yrs,legally,but no path. Republican RAC act would include me
@UNITEDWEDREAM @JohnCornyn Support legal DREAMers too.We meet same criteria,have been here for 12yrs. But parents are on non immigrant visa.RAC act includes me
@LacyClayMO1 Congressman Clay,	Please add DREAMERS who have legal non immigrant status to dream act.I came 12yrs ago.Qualify under RAC act, but not dream
@NancyPelosi @LacyClayMO1 @RepLujanGrisham The dream act needs to include children of legal immigrants who qualify. Even the RAC act includes some of us if we came on E2 visa

@MddeH @gsiskind these should include DREAMERS who came legally and are still legal but have no path.  I qualify under RAC act bc of E2 visa but not dreamact
@SenKamalaHarris @gsiskind The DREAM act needs to include certain children of legal immigrants who have no path also. Republican supported RAC act includes E2 visa!
@David_J_Bier @dacaleftmebehin @SenatorDurbin The RAC act actually includes certain legal children under the E2 visa. The dream act needs this too and include all legal children!
