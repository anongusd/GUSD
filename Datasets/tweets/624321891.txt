@DavidP4AD @JimGreenwood @statnews point to consider on patent settlements: as certain originators continue to deploy new &amp; enhanced legal &amp; commercial strategies to thwart competition, if generic/biosim company wants to ensure it can ever actually get to market, only recourse may be to settle for a date certain.
@DavidP4AD @JimGreenwood @statnews Higher deductibles legit concern. So is post deductible patient cost-sharing, often a %age of list price. Higher list price = higher patient cost-share, so list price very relevant. Best path to lower prices is to curb anti-competitive tactics, and let market forces work.

In U.S. we have to wait another 4 years for a Humira biosimilar. Drug was approved here in 2002.  Proposed USMCA trade deal will make access to biosimilars in U.S. even more difficult - ironic given @realDonaldTrump's Blueprint on Rx costs is titled "American Patients First."

@SarahKarlin A much higher percentage support increasing competition through generic utilization.  Another reason why getting Congress to pass the CREATES Act would have a much more profound impact than some of what has been proposed thus far.
@DavidP4AD one step @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SecAzar could take that would increase competition (consistent with WH Blueprint to Lower Rx Costs) &amp; lower drug costs would be to call on Congress to pass the CREATES Act.

@dgingery Recently HHS Secretary and FDA Commissioner have both publicly commented that low payment/reimbursement for generics in US market are negatively impacting competition. This new proposal does not address that primary underlying problem, and would actually exacerbate it.

@RESachs Daraprim was/is an older, off-patented branded medicine.  Has never been approved under a generic application.

@AndyBiotech This is the "weaponizing" of the rebate system with the specific objective of ensuring biosimilars do not get preferred formulary positioning and market uptake. Completely undermines the sought-after balance of innovation and access sought by both Hatch Waxman and BPCIA.

@ShohamTxID As a market basket overall generics cost less in the US than in other developed markets, so the economics of importation don't make sense.
@ShohamTxID ...and if only one manufacturer remained it could create a de facto monopoly similar to the IP protected status that branded medicines have.

@ZacharyBrennan @SarahKarlin good question.  suspect more the latter than the former.  On RTT Goldwater was not per se aligned with industry.  On this effort companies are trying to recruit third parties to give appearance that this policy would have wider support than it actually will.
@SarahKarlin @ZacharyBrennan First objective was to create awareness around the "concept." Then generate industry-funded supporters and coalitions that will be willing to support/push model language. That will be the next phase.
@ZacharyBrennan Originator advocates plan to move model legislation in states that wouldn't permit switching a patient from reference product to biosimilar. If successful would limit competition, reduce access &amp; inflate costs, but also protect certain monopolies beyond what BPCIA intended.
