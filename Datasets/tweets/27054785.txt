@SwanniOnTV The voice of Chris Schenkel. Underrated, underappreciated to this day.  In the early 60s, he might be on all 3 networks on the same day, with all his various sporting events and shows.
@RinggoldBandMom Me too.  I thought "Material Girl" or "Into the Groove" would make it.  Also nothing by Fleetwood Mac, Billy Joel, Whitney Houston, U2, or Tom Petty.

@FriedBasballATL True. I remember a popular "hometown" player who turned down a $15 million deal from #ATL a few years back, to sign with another team for $16 million, saying, "Gotta think about my family." Meanwhile, 99% of fans are scraping together enough cash to buy groceries.
@FriedBasballATL Yep, a man's gotta put food on the table. I love it when a guy signs for $60 million instead of $58 million. "I had to think about my family...."

#Braves 2019 prediction: Johan Camargo will become an everyday player, replacing an injured (or slumping) regular. He'll do great. Snitker will realize Camargo should've been in there all along. It's much like 2009, when Cox finally replaced Kelly Johnson with Martin Prado.

@Wcg77777 @mlbbowman Maybe...but considering the affordable alternatives out there, I don't see anyone better. If Ryan Klesko, etc. can play LF, Camargo can...and hit with power too.

Even happier than #Dabo today: @danwolken
Funny how we react to sports. #Clemson beat the daylights out of #Bama, so I turned it off early, and slept great. I mean, it wasn't even close. Now, if Clemson had beaten Bama 17-16, I would still be tossing and turning, and you wouldn't see me on the news. For about a week.
Oh well, Saban has 8 months to plot his revenge. And past history tells me he bounces back well. #Bama
#Clemson freshman QB &amp; receiver will get a lot of praise, and rightly so. But #Bama lost the line of scrimmage. Tua was under constant pressure, and Lawrence had all day. Plus Saban &amp; staff finally got out-coached. Dabo had great game plan, and Bama made some terrible play calls.
Best team #Clemson will win tonight, as it should be. Plus #Bama haters (95% of nation) get to celebrate for 8 months, and that's cool, too.  But...14 out of 15 ain't bad. And Saban tends to rebound pretty well.  Now bring on the #Braves!
RT @ChrisVannini: The last coach to beat Alabama by 16+ was Nick Saban at LSU.
It's been a great run for #Bama this season. But #Clemson is amazing.
Kudos to #Clemson. And they're getting it done with freshmen. Impressive. #Bama
#Bama special team play is um... not.
#Clemson is not having to beat #Bama so far tonight.  Bama has done it themselves up to this point.
Maybe #Bama is just setting us up for another #JalenHurts storybook finish. Or something.

(2 of 2) Boos to: Refs who handed out questionable penalties while missing several obvious ones; and certain #Bama players who uncharacteristically showed little discipline after building an early lead. #Saban admitted, he's got a lot to clean up before #Clemson. #OrangeBowl

@vol_youngblood I hope you're right!

Are there any #Braves beat writers or columnists who are NOT ecstatic over the McCann/Donaldson moves? Seems odd. Fans are generally underwhelmed. I would think Yankees or Red Sox writers would be questioning the acquisition of aging, oft-injured players.

@LucidSpin @Braves A little early to say. Much of it depends on where Bryce Harper ends up.  The Phillies and Mets HAVE to be better in 2019. Marlins, meh. Nats are the big question mark.
@stevendbuckland I'm thinkin' yep.
#Braves 2019 predictions (5 of 5): Culberson may be the only returnee to what was arguably the worst bench in MLB at season's end. #Dodgers proved, you've gotta have depth. Braves had too many guys from the bargain bin, and it showed.
#Braves 2019 predictions (4 of 5): Fans will howl when a familiar, popular player (or more) is dealt away. Again: SS? 3B? CF? But you've got to give up something to get something. Anthopoulos helped build the #Dodgers. He knows what #Braves need. Let him go for it.
#Braves 2019 predictions (3 of 5): Not as much of a shakeup among starting staff: but at least one new arm, with true Ace potential.
#Braves 2019 predictions (2 of 5): Look for an overhauled bullpen, with perhaps only 3 returnees.  Most of the guys who were left off the NLDS roster are gone. Control will be a priority.
#Braves 2019 predictions (1 of 5) Look for at least two new everyday players: RF and Catcher. Maybe one more: SS? 3B? CF?

@MarkBradleyAJC Good thing for Mark  that #Braves didn't rally late, or this column would never have seen the light of day.
I predicted #Braves would win 75 games, because Freddie had no additional hitting support in the lineup.  He got some extra support, and they won 90.  In 2019, he needs just a little bit more. #ChopOn

Much credit, again, to #Braves fans at @SunTrustPark for being loud and loyal. Especially @iAmZeGinger, his famous dad Garry, and 91-year-old grandmother Betty! https://t.co/aAQzy8iWUP
@Steve_Mac_NS In his long career he's had only two good seasons at the plate: 2016-17. For a team that desperately needs offense, particular power, he's apparently not the guy. Not to mention his very low rate of throwing out base stealers. Again, I don't get the new contract.
Suzuki has driven in the only #Braves runs tonight, and is always a threat at the plate. Yet he's the catcher who is unsigned for 2019. What am I missing?
@AJCsports Translation: mop-up.
In 2018 #Dodgers got Machado from #Orioles. From the same team, #Braves got Ryan Flaherty and Brad Brach. If we're going to have nice things, we can't keep shopping in the bargain bin.
@swood1391 So true. And #Braves pitchers excel in giving up walks, and two-strike beach balls.
First mistake from Sabotka I've seen all year.  #Braves are just outmanned, especially in hitting. They've gotta spend some of that money we've been hearing about this off-season, and get some power.
#Braves bench woes: Ryan Flaherty got 22 hits in his first 58 ABs. Since then, he's 13 for 105. And he's on the playoff roster.
Brach has put up good numbers, and gets high praise from #Braves announcers, but...I haven’t seen much.
I would be far more productive if #GusJohnson would narrate the wonder of me getting out of bed each morning. #DickerTheKicker https://t.co/o7zr5gdCQn
If I had a Fitbit that counted the steps I take, going back and getting something I forgot:  I'm guessing it would be about 5,000 a day.
Gas prices usually go down this time of year. But not this year. AAA says, "OPEC output remains low and U.S. sanctions are expected to limit exports of Iranian crude. Global demand keeps growing. These fundamentals could keep upward pressure on prices at the pump."
GREAT win. Didn't see that coming.  Even it up tomorrow! #Braves
#Braves closer Viz has thrown 17 pitches. 2 baserunners, no outs.
@JeffSchultzATL @TenorLion Never any question about that.
@amidalakrs or 12.
I wish Sobotka could keep on going.  But you'll see a PH for him in bottom  7th. #Braves
Oddly enough, the #Braves reliever I trust the most is Charlie Culberson.
@TClayCooper Snit can pretty much draw names out of a hat at this point.
#Braves batters with 2 strikes, look at called strike 3.  #Dodgers batters with 2 strikes, launch the ball 400 feet.
That #Braves bench.  Still so much work to do for 2019.
@thicks17 And yet, no one was surprised.
@Jbai05 Yep...I think most of us saw this coming.
RT @JeffSchultzATL: Three leadoff walks in this game, 2 of the three scored. https://t.co/vHl1TVHye6
#Dodgers have what, about 10-12 guys who can hit a HR at any moment. During the 2nd half, #Braves have had one. #Acuna
Why don't the broadcasters talk about how Matt Kemp gained 40 pounds during the season with #Braves last year?
The waitress "Was anyone watching that?" #Giants #Eagles NFL spot was the BEST commercial I have seen this year. #Braves
@Obstructedview2 He's in the bottom five...but they all try to out-do each other regularly.
Snit didn't ask me...but I would've made the same move. #Braves
I frequently hear John Smoltz say a player is excelling because "He's not trying to do too much." Honestly, if that's the secret to success, I should have been a first round draft pick. #Braves
Kudos to #Braves fans for A) showing up, and B) for being LOUD
It's pretty obvious they don't assign umpires to postseason based on merit these days. Angel Hernandez &amp; Doug Eddings are doing games, and tonight's #Dodgers #Braves plate umpire, Gary Cederstrom, is off to a terrible start.  Evidently, they have a drawing, like a door prize.
Excellent work by John Dickerson of CBS. He did his homework. https://t.co/p7OfNMyKnP
@jfwiii I'm more worried about the hitting plan.  If you lose 1-0, or 15-0, it's still a loss.

@MarkKSimpson2 That ship has sailed!
RT @DOBrienATL: The #Dodgers have five homers and 11 walks. #Braves have zero and zero.
#Braves could not be any colder if they were on an ice rink. Oh well, as we're often reminded, they're a year early.
Welp, the Nick Markakis of 2015-16 has returned. That 3-month power surge was fun while it lasted. #Braves
My wife wants to trade places with Yasiel Puig. #Braves https://t.co/cEbsYAfYCH
I say it all the time. As Freddie Freeman goes, so go the #Braves. Let's see how it goes in the 7th.
If #Braves offense doesn't show some signs of life, #Dodgers may start Vin Scully in Game 3.
Kershaw: 6 innings, 60 pitches, no runs. He could pitch 12 innings at this rate. #Braves
They're putting in different baseballs for the #Dodgers to hit, right? I can't think of any other explanation.  Unless, as I suggested last night, they're quietly moving the fences in between innings. #Braves
Kershaw makes it look so easy. #Braves
@TClayCooper @BravesAmerica Inexplicable.
#Braves: Freeman, Markakis, and Albies have pretty much lost their power since July.
@BravesAmerica and obviously, lack of power.
High pitch count for Sanchez through 2 innings.  We truly don't need another bullpen night. #Braves
Would love to see #Braves square up on a few fly balls.  When the #Dodgers do it in their ball park, they tend to reach the seats.
@LukeJohnson90 I guess so. On the other hand, the #Dodgers hit home runs constantly, so most base runners will usually score. #Braves have had a power shortage recently.
If it's not an 0-2 pitch, it's a 3-0 pitch. #Braves

@seatonob Still a long way to go.  But their season record outside the NL East proves they need to beef up to compete with the big boys.

RT @mlbbowman: The Braves are 10-24 in playoff games since last winning a postseason series (2001 NLDS).
@jenn_b_smith You picked a good one to miss.
If nothing else, this #Braves postseason might serve to show the team's GM some of the team's weaknesses as he prepares for 2019.  The poor competition in NL East allowed Braves to jump ahead. But the rebuild isn't really over yet.
Well, obviously, #Dodgers move the outfield fences in 50 feet when they bat. Looks like the cameras would catch that. What other logical explanation could there be? #Braves
In an otherwise stellar season, a frequent #Braves bugaboo:  bad 0-2 pitches.
Could've been much, much, much worse. #Braves
@JeffSchultzATL Brach is the mystery to me. you never know what you're gonna get... #Braves
This is for you, @MLB: By showing #Braves #Dodgers only on MLB-TV, you're depriving many fans from watching an important game. I'm glad big games were on free TV when I was growing up.  That's how I became a lifelong fan. What about the next generation?

#Braves reliever Luke Jackson, who somehow is still on the team, just issued the team's 12th walk with no outs in 7th. Honestly, I'd rather see them give up 6 HR's, instead of 12 walks.
If you issue ten walks in 5 2/3 innings, you really don't deserve to win. #Braves
#Braves silver lining: with this walk-filled outing today, hopefully Julio Teheran has pitched himself out of any post-season rotation plans.

#Braves win, 2-1! Facebook "likes" the Braves today.
@LeBronJameSon23 @FriedBasballATL Oddly enough, I didn't expect much from him. When Braves got him, some Rays fans told me we had made a serious mistake.  They were right.
@LeBronJameSon23 @FriedBasballATL I've been trying to forget that era.
@FriedBasballATL I honestly didn't see that coming.  I was thrilled when the Braves acquired him.  But then, I also felt that way about Dan Uggla, Nate McLouth, and a few others, so I'm used to it.

@MarkKSimpson2 They had no choice.  He blocked every camera angle.
@thicks17 Kind of like when a 24-year-old rookie makes a basic base running mistake. "Well, he's just a rookie..."  And it's usually something every kid learns by age 10.
Honestly, when #Braves walk a batter, they just should wave him around the bases.

@Braves Any predictions on who gets ejected first tonight? The Joe West ump show crew loves to be on TV. #Braves
@NoogaDawg @MLB The players would have to take a seat, because these guys would spend two hours fighting for camera time.
@DOBrienATL Any time Duvall plays while Culberson sits, it is a questionable decision.
Umps Joe West, Doug Eddings, Marty Foster, and Mark Ripperger, at #Braves #Dbacks series, easily make up the worst crew in @MLB. The fact that neither CB Bucknor nor Angel Hernandez is involved is a testament to how low this crew can go.
@FriedBasballATL It's always good to see a kid force his way into the lineup with good play, despite a skeptical manager/GM. Martin Prado did the same thing a few years ago, despite Cox favoring Kelly Johnson at 2nd base. #Braves

@FriedBasballATL #Braves are 50-54 against teams who are not named Marlins or Mets. (Their combined record: 119-160). That should be a concern, and a reminder that some moves must be made before 2019.
@todd_grainger You are blessed.
@DPotterNews good line!
Still processing an awful #Braves homestand loss today. They led 7-1 against a B-team #RedSox squad. Boston was trying to hand them a win, and the Braves would not take it, losing 9-8. They begin a tough NL west trip tomorrow. We will learn if they're really post-season worthy.

@mlbbowman Freddie hasn't been his usual jovial self on the field, in a couple of months. I hope everything is ok, not just physically.
Thanks #RedSox for rolling out the B-team lineup today! #mercy #Braves
@JeffSchultzATL Right. But they’ve gotta put up wins against teams not named Marlins or Mets. (50-53)
@Mooneypie13 @mlbbowman Don’t know. He’s not the pitcher he was May-July.
@mlbbowman Seems obvious to me he's worn out. I will imagine this fact will emerge when everyone admits it after the season.
As Freddie Freeman goes, so go the #Braves.  They're 26-9 vs. Mets &amp; Marlins. They're 50-53 against everyone else. Freddie is hitting .387 vs. Mets &amp; Marlins: he's hitting .276 against everyone else.
@billcolrus Very impressive.  Good defense, good speed, pitchers who throw strikes, hitters who don't swing at bad pitches.  They check all the boxes.
AL East leaders have outscored NL East leaders 13-3 this week.  And the #RedSox seem to be playing at about 75% intensity. Scary. #Braves
@BravesAmerica Yeah, what's up with that guy?
Surefire way to speed up the game: just let every #RedSox hitter come to the plate with a 2-0 count. #Braves
Ten pitchers sitting around in the bullpen, and.... nothing. #Braves
Plus they throw strikes.
@Suzzanne3475 I get the feeling that somewhere down the road, we'll learn that something isn't right with FF.  Either personally, or physically.  And if history repeats itself, it won't be #ATL media breaking that story. #Braves
#RedSox sure know how to pitch to #Braves. I've never seen so many pop-ups and fly-outs.
It's still a long way from over, but kudos to Newk for pitching out of bases-loaded, nobody out jam against the best team in baseball. #Braves lead in middle of 4th 1-0.
2018 #Braves have been fun to watch, but looking ahead: they're still a starter, reliever, catcher, and a slugger away from being elite.  They're 26-9 against the lowly Mets &amp; Marlins. They're 50-52 against everyone else.

Kudos to @SInow for speaking truth. #Marlins #Urena suspension should have been 20-30 games, and a huge chunk of salary. Instead, @MLB was toothless as usual. They never fail to disappoint.  #Braves https://t.co/hekQAU6JzL

The #Urena suspension from @MLB should be treated as if #Acuna's injury is severe.  Even if it isn't, it certainly could have been. The luck of an inch or two shouldn't matter. #Braves
If I were #Realmuto, I would sign with #Braves after next season at a free agent discount.  Dude looks like he'd prefer to play for a classy organization after the nightmare he's living with Miami.
@FriedBasballATL will correct, thanks!

@BRMASH58 @FreddieFreeman5 As far as I know, they're only on FB tomorrow
At the beginning of the season, I said it was a shame that #Braves could not surround @FreddieFreeman5 with a quality lineup, again this year. I love it when I'm wrong about stuff like that.

@NateFaulknerTV Unfortunately, I don't have family connections.
Crucial series continues in Washington for #Braves.  Never thought I'd say this, but we're in a pennant race in August 2018! I think Culberson has earned a starting spot. Wouldn't be surprised to see him at 3rd base, and Camargo at SS. Your thoughts?
@gomocs57 Polar opposite.
Great #Braves win after an ugly afternoon game. This one was important. Jesse Biddle is the man. Do it again tomorrow! #chop
Whatever the outcome of #Braves game, kudos to Sean Newcomb. Matched the #Nats Cy Young winner Scherzer, pitch for pitch.  Ace vs. Ace.
There's a reason most @MLB fans don't know Jerry Layne's name, even though he's in his 30th year as an umpire. He's very good.  The best umpires aren't household names, because they don't overshadow the game. #Braves
Evidently this was an important day for the Nats.
So...#Braves rested young studs Acuna &amp; Albies in one game each of this day-night twin-bill.  But Ryan Zimmerman is able to start both games?

Final #HamCo mysteries have been solved:  Esther Helton has defeated Jonathan Mason for #TNDist30 House GOP, and @TuckerMcClendon has defeated 8 yr. incumbent David Testerman in School Board Dist 8. 130/130
@gomocs57 We are planning to do a Facebook Live (WRCB)
@smcorcoran Helton is claiming victory.  3507-3367, with 4 unknown precincts out.  I'd say it's over.
@cjacuff @Scottanooga Saw it coming. 2 negative candidates cancelled each other out. Lee positioned himself perfectly.
@TnTicket Personally, I think they will have no effect.  But I can't say that with 100% certainty.
On her Facebook page, Esther Helton is claiming victory in #TN30 GOP race.  She leads Jonathan Mason 3507-3367 with 124/130.  Winner faces Dem candidate @JodaThongnopnua in November.

@DestinyFletch13 If only.
David Sharpe (Dist 6)  and Chip Baker (Dist 2) join Katherlyn Geter (elected to Dist 5 in May) as new members of #HamCo Commission.
@BRAVOFAN1007 easy win for Sheriff Hammond.
Word to the wise for Tenn. candidates in November:  Negative ads failed.
Nobody's catching Bill Lee in #TNGOP Gov. race.  His lead has widened.  In my opinion: negative ads played a role in sinking his two main opponents.
Possible upset alert: #HamCo School Board Dist 8: 23-year-old Tucker @TuckerMcClendon has 100 vote lead over 8-year incumbent David Testerman.  100/130 reporting.
59% of precincts reporting statewide: Bill Lee leading Randy Boyd 37% to 25% for #TNGOPGov. Looks like Lee vs. Democrat Karl Dean in November general election.
Starting to look like incumbent #HamCo Dist 6 Comm. Joe Graham may face an insurmountable lead from challenger David Sharpe. 82/130 reporting, and Sharpe's lead is now 2601-2049.
I can’t see anyone overtaking Bill Lee in TN GOP gubernatorial primary.
Possible Upset alert: David Sharpe widens lead over Joe Graham in #HamCo Comm Dist 6: 2157-1820. 46 of 130 reporting
What a race is #TNDist30 #GOP.  Mason leads Helton 1423-1409. Still early...
@SharpeHomes thanks...will fix
Bill Lee building up a pretty solid lead so far in #GOPTNGov race.
Esther Helton leading Jonathan Mason by 17 votes (1301-1284) for #TNDist30 with 8 of 130 precincts reporting. #HamCo
Looks like big win for Jenny Hill for #HamCo Dist 6 School Board, with 75% of the early votes.  A 1,000 vote lead over Michael Henry.
Overall, a good early vote for incumbents in #HamCo local races. School Board Dist 8 incumbent David Testerman has narrow lead over Tucker McClendon 938-771
#HamCo early voting shows at least one incumbent in trouble: Dist 6 Co. Commissioner Joe Graham (R) trails David Sharpe (D) by 400 votes. Sharpe polling 60% of early votes.

Best article I've ever read about @DaleMurphy3. People forget that very early in his career, he missed about 100 games due to injuries, which probably cost him 20 HR. Baseball HOF isn't complete until he's in. https://t.co/lFoNzo0PqO

@JonCoppinger With the current group calling itself the Beach Boys, just one (Mike Love), although Bruce Johnston is included (not an original Beach Boy, but joined fairly early). Brian Wilson and Al Jardine tour in a different band.
It's great that Matt Kemp started caring again this year, and is tearing it up for the Dodgers. But I think in the long run, the #Braves won that trade. #CharlieCulberson

Looking for a big offensive show from #Braves today. TV announcers say they've been tired, but since they haven't run the bases since Wednesday, and had two off days this week, they should be at full speed.
@chrisclement70 In retrospect, I needed the nap today. #Braves
@powelljolie True...but why aren't their opponents tired, too?  They seem energized.
Tired #Braves, too weary to lift bats off their shoulders, lose to Diamondbacks 3-0. Two games, 83,000 fans, one run scored. We'll get 'em tomorrow!
I keep hearing TV announcers talking about how #Braves are tired, and can really use the All-Star break. Seems strange.  The teams that are beating them lately should be tired too, right?

@mlbbowman I'd like #Braves to follow the lead of some winning teams. Put best two impact hitters at the top, Albies &amp; Freeman. Late in the game, the 9-hitter is usually Culberson anyway, after a double switch. With the game on the line, best hitters need to be at the top.

No one asked, but here's my ideal #Braves lineup: Albies, Freeman, Acuna....Markakis, Camargo, Suzuki....Swanson, Enciarte/Culberson, Pitcher.  Acuna moves to CF when Enciarte sits against lefties. Fire away, folks.

"All Star." Emphasis on quotation marks. https://t.co/tCfMxZ2MG7

Kudos to #Braves Luke Jackson. This game was rapidly getting out of hand, and he kept it close.
@FOXSportsBraves Good to see @FreddieFreeman5 smile again.
Back "in the day," most MLB teams had 5 starting pitchers, and 5 relievers. It seemed to work. #Braves, like many teams, now have 8 relievers.  And oddly, that may not be enough.

@stevendbuckland @GabeBurnsAJC No idea about Moylan truly being hurt.  However in the past, it has been widely speculated that the DL is a soft landing place for struggling pitchers who either need a break, or a new line of work.
@GabeBurnsAJC We will soon find out if the GM is truly serious about a postseason drive. Offense and starting pitching can't keep bailing out an atrocious bullpen. #Braves

@timwilliamsart He seems like a good dude...a fun guy on the bench....and he's a good bunter. But I have zero confidence in his big-game ability, and hopefully the #Braves will have some of those in the near future.  I hope he strings together a few good starts, to boost his trade value.

Thank you Tom Glavine for pointing out all those rested arms in #Braves bullpen, not warming up while Sam Freeman blows a lead. Why have 8 relievers if you're not gonna use them? Newcomb won't get a well-deserved win.

Lots of #Braves fans complaining, and rightfully so, because some roster moves must be made. But the bottom line of 2018 season so far: Don't give up on this team when they're trailing. Unlike past seasons, they'll probably mount a comeback.
@MLBStatoftheDay Won-loss is not a particularly meaningful stat, especially for a middle reliever who rarely factors in a decision.

Gotta give the O's credit. Here's a 21-52 team playing like it means something. #Braves
That #Braves bullpen, and those 0-2 pitches.

@jonward51 Don't get your hopes up...There are about 6 #Braves who are deserving. I'd say we're lucky to get 3.
Great #Braves 14-1 win last night! Actual ace, and should-be All-Star Sean Newcomb is having a terrific season.

@GabeBurnsAJC Good job, good story Gabe.  I still don't agree with the decision, and that's not hindsight.  It was a head-scratcher at the time.  Can't figure out why Josh Ravin, who's actually been effective at Gwinnett, can't get a call-up, since all other mop-up options have failed.
Scherzer is a true weapon. Kudos to #Nats for smart bullpen management. #Braves
This one’s on Snitker. That last spot in the bullpen has been a disaster all year. #Braves
Freddie Freeman: our little secret, #Braves fans.
By the way, I am enjoying the perspective, and personality, of a recently retired player in the #Braves broadcast booth. @JeffFrancoeur has a great future behind the mic (as does Kris Medlen).
Every time I say, "I've seen it all from this #Braves team," they show me something new. #ChopOn
@gomocs57 Oh yes. They’ll need to win a World Series or two before NY and Boston takes notice.
If you're upset about Newcomb not winning NL pitcher of the month...just wait until All-Star time.  Don't get get your hopes up. #Braves

@DOBrienAJC Basically, the old-timey way, 8 of your first 8 batters have a decent chance of getting on base.  With this lineup, it's 7 out of 8.  And Enciarte will have one less at-bat per game to ignite a rally with his bat and his speed.
@slamminsam25 I like your lineup way better.
@DOBrienAJC Basically, giving a great late-game hitter (Enciarte) one less at-bat per game.

#Braves bullpen guy @shanecarle is the MVP of tonight's game, no matter what happens. He put out a dumpster fire, and gave his team a chance to win. Kudos to Snitker for pushing the right button at the right time.

@Bravesmeme So it was "the right way" to eject #Braves manager Brian Snitker for asking them to enforce MLB rules?
@mlbbowman Zero umpire changes from 2017.  Doug Eddings, CB Bucknor, Angel Hernandez, Joe West, etc, all are safe and secure, despite constant ineptitude. MLB really doesn't pay attention, right?
@grantmcauley So when your pitcher is getting drilled, and inexplicably no one has been asked to warm up: do relievers have the right (and common sense) to get up, and start stretching and tossing on their own?
@RJKeil She is irreplaceable! @KelsWingert #GetWell #HurryBack

@joelabarker Yep, some of the "experts" will disagree (because they toe the company line), but if he's an MLB star 2-3 years from now, I think it'll be in a bullpen role.  He doesn't seem to have the temperament of a starter.  And if he proves me wrong, then good for him!

@1emac I'd love to be wrong about Folty.  I just see him more as a one-inning attack guy, than a 6-7 inning guy who can keep his composure. Again, I'd be thrilled if he proved me wrong. But he's always seemed like a reliever to me.
@Obstructedview2 Yep, I'm thinking in a "start the 7th or 8th inning" role, there might be fewer opportunities for that to happen.  Seems like he's usually more impressive his first time through the lineup. His meltdowns happen more often 2nd or 3rd time through.
@grantmcauley I'm sure you will.
Random #Braves thought as we await opening day:  I still think if Folty has a future in MLB, it's as a late inning bullpen guy.  Let him blow it past 3 or 4 guys, and he's done for the night. He's miscast as a starter.
@grantmcauley Let's be honest. In 2018, other than about 8 core players, #Braves will be a revolving door, throwing a bunch of guys out there, hoping someone will stick. They're basically keeping the lights on until 2019. The "rebuilding" has to be over by then.
