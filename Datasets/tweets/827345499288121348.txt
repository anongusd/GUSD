@enterthesmoke @Tyler_Brito @BreitbartNews I knew you wouldn’t be able to explain how a wall would fix anything 😂
@1300ccxraytech @BreitbartNews Good point, if prisoners can get drugs into jails then how does anybody believe a wall would work?? 		You’re not as smart as you thought 😂😂👍
@Vgerard1935 @BreitbartNews When he claimed a wall would fix everything, or anything. But actually you make a good point, it’s more “disinformation” when it’s purposefully misleading.
@Tyler_Brito @BreitbartNews Nobody can explain how, even if there was a real crisis, a wall would stop the demand for drugs. You can’t, the pres. can’t, Fox can’t. 🐸

@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis Your gaslighting won’t work
@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis So your ego makes you think you need the last word eh? Says a ton

@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis I bet you do.

@JALobdell @KL_LosAngeles @DRUDGE_REPORT Yeah it was incorrect, insulting everyone and then claiming you voted a certain way because you got insulted is 1)hypocritical 2)childish 3)how you get the worst candidate as president. I’ve turned to insults only against people who are 1)lying out their ass 2)bots 3)hypocrites
@JALobdell @KL_LosAngeles @DRUDGE_REPORT Unrelated to the topic, thanks for giving up https://t.co/6hVAeOtu2Y
@JALobdell @KL_LosAngeles @DRUDGE_REPORT And it was incorrect and hypocritical, as evidenced by your ignoring of my response.
@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis Also there’s a few hundred that still are separated and have no plans to be reunited. So again, you’re really bad at this.
@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis This would almost be coherent except there’s already at least 1 confirmed death from the situation down there, the kid got a respiratory infection and died because of lack of care, not to mention the ice goons that abused the kids. You’re bad at this. Just agree to disagree...
@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis I can play your game “I never said YOU did” lmao classic. However you did show that you don’t care about imprisoning 2000 innocent children, away from their parents for months. Here comes the game of semantics, “i never said I support that”though you made it clear it’s not a prob https://t.co/Zy1MRZkFYS
@GreyHouseDan @MarvinDigeorgio @SenWarren @ATT @Novartis Nope but nice try. Inaccurate assessment of opposing the current corruption.

@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT Again I’ll tell you that I don’t get my information from cable networks but you just have to parrot trump &amp; fox &amp; breitbart &amp; drudge because it’s all you have!

@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT ???? Waiting for you to say something like “everyone who’s not racist would be honored by being called a racist” or some retardation of the sort. Don’t give up now you’ve already shown your idiocy keep it going!

@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT According to the history of this country, referring to a black person as that word is undeniably racist, unless you’re a racist sympathizer. You’re so stressed trying to defend these fools lmao just “walk away” or whatever you clowns do to sleep better at night
@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT All 4 of those tweets he said they’re “like a dog” until it was a black person and it turns into “that dog”. I don’t expcet you to understand the difference though, it takes some brain cells to think for yourself instead of regurgitating fox breitbart and drudge narratives
@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT And on top of that your deflecting from our countries elected leader says a ton. Piss poor examples? So why can’t they be refuted lmao it’s clear as day. Keep reaching man you’re getting paid by the hour

@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT So you’re agreeing trump is inarguably racist? Wasn’t so hard was it
@vytharr Why does he say the literal nazis in Charlottesville were “very fine people”? Why does he say a Mexican judge can’t do his job fairly? Why does he call Omarosa a “dog”? Why does he endorse candidates that say voting for a black man is “monkeying this up”?List goes on,”fake news”?

@vytharr @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT No need to present clips and videos when you goons resort to “fake news” no matter what’s presented 😂😂just stay in your world it must be comforting there
@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT I love how you all parrot the goof in office with the “cnn” narrative hahaha I don’t get my information from cable networks. But it’s all you got so, keep it up
@pyrsnowstorm @pmanajp @DRUDGE_REPORT You choose to ignore clear evidence. Just because in your world the only “”””proof”””” of racism is declaring “I’m a racist” doesn’t mean it’s not true. 🤡

@1trillion2 @1humanvoice @DRUDGE_REPORT Whatever point you were trying to make didn’t land. The ego parade would cost $92 million according to the Department of Defense. $92,000,000 of your and my money wasted to boost the big baby’s ego. To fix flints water would only cost $55M. There’s no excuse for waste like that
@1trillion2 @1humanvoice @DRUDGE_REPORT How come 0 of your 3 comments were related to the overly expensive, ego-driven military parade that I mentioned? Reaching.
@ncablk what a fucking puss, can’t handle someone doing back to you what you did to them 😂😂 definition of little bear fans. https://t.co/apnXP2MBq8

@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT So when i list it you can make shit up about why it doesn’t matter? Hahahha!Let’s start with the topic at hand using SHELL COMPANY to funnel hush money. Or accepting campaign donations from a foreign entity. And not to mention sexual assault because you’ll defend it. And acceptin
@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT Your “broke the law” argument really looks foolish when you choose to ignore the president and his cabinets law-breaking. I know you’re not this dumb, you just are really used to people being dumb enough to think you have good points		Tip:don’t show your frustration thru 12 emoji
@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT Slow down a little bit so you can comprehend. It does not matter what law she broke about a non-disclosure agreement. Nobody cares about that, but we do care about what it reveals.I know you’re not too dumb to understand that, a 4th time.I’ll break 50 NDA if it reveals corruption https://t.co/3Ld67UU5Mq

@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT Is the conservative snowflake that blocked me crying again? Shoo, fly. https://t.co/SyE9P0868m
@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT You’re trying to distract, saying non disclosure agreement means we should ignore what it reveals. Hahaha when that’s your argument you can be sure you’re on the losing side. But keep up your straw-man arguments, I bet they work well on the locals.
@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT Saying something is done every day and claiming that justifies anything might mean your iq is sub-70. Your poster child claim could at least hold a little water if you picked someone who’s discussing policies but again, fitting your narrative. You really thought lmao
@Moneyjon2 @pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT Except you made most of that up to fit your narrative. She’s not a poster child haha she just has incriminating info and you hate that. And the straw man of mogul blah blah, you can’t just funnel money through shell companies to pay hush money, and Exocet to get away with it 😂😂

@pwrfulwomantoo @DRUDGE_REPORT So, your favorite politician cheated on his wife with “the biggest joke in the universe”. In other words, you can’t even comprehend that you’re insulting trump by saying this 😂
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico So then let’s see which politicians you think are respectable and which ones aren’t, since you’re making up shit about this one. Should be interesting ;)
@WCurtrightMO @MissouriGOP @joshhawleymo Conveniently upscale neighborhood, conveniently all white. Hmmmm
@tlkreitzjr @BreitbartNews You almost got it. A lawyer, because they know the law and the ways in which trump breaks it, and would pin him in a corner til he spilled the beans.
@BreitbartNews DumbTrump would never debate avenatti 🤫😸 or any lawyer for that matter
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico No, literally, “I want this convo to be over but I feel like I have to get the last word”	😂
@HawleyMO @MissouriGOP He believes president is above the law you dunce
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico In other words, “I have nothing more to contribute because I was bullshitting the whole time”	😂
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico You put up a straw-man and knocked it down with an unrelated argument, to make it appear as if you defeated the argument I put up. It’s extremely simple, and too commonly used to be effective against the right people.
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico I mean, identifying your straw-man logic and pointing it out really got under your skin lol. Surely someone’s called you out for it before?
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico Best you’ve got! So you concede
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico 1) He was rebutting her entire narrative of Obama being untrustworthy and out to get you, you’re using an illogical fallacy to try to pinpoint his rebuttal, to fit your narrative.	2) Palin, horrible pick, so? This is called a straw-man argument. Doesn’t correlate. You’re reaching
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico No, not meaning what you said, meaning he needed to cut her off and correct her. Anybody with social skills whatsoever can tell. You’re just grossly trying to stain his name
@ExcitableBoythe @yankeepaul @politico Yes of course but do you believe that he wasn’t just realizing the type of shit she was about to spew so he was just cutting her off “no ma’am, no ma’am” he was cutting off her toxic narrative so he could start speaking.
@Cato_Cat @foxandfriends @CeeLew101 It’s militarization of sports to glorify.....militarization.

@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne You support the biggest con in the world
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne I know there’s no way you’re this dumb or badly programmed of a bot, you just WANT to defend this racist.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne I told you 17x that I don’t buy her playing the victim. You do because it fits your narrative. Keep trying
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne What makes you think I care
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne “Trying to prove racists aren’t racists” is something y’all have been really bad at for 2 years now
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Your definition of trolling is asking how you can respect someone more after all this. You’re snowflaking heavily.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne I’m literally asking you to ask me a question but you continue to avoid my points. Most hypocritical twitter convo in a month
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne You’ve literally not had 1 single question mark. You’re bad at this deflection thing
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Ask a question.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne “I thought the bitch was white” doesn’t cut it in the real world.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Wtf is your question? You don’t have one just blindly assuming I’m being partisan. Roseanne is loony.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Go ahead and keep deflecting. You’re doing exactly what you blame me of doing, you’re fine if it’s a con. I condemn all of it, can you say that about Crazy Roseanne? https://t.co/n0F62NifTS
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne I’ve seen her responses, you can’t comprehend that she’s a liar and playing victim. Keep trying
@HawleyMO @MissouriGOP Wtf are you talking about republicans control all the chambers of govt you imbecile
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Also can you not comprehend that you’re trying to say “it’s only bad if it’s racist towards blacks”. There’s so many reasons as to why you’re failing here
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Lmfao it’s exposed, you literally made an account to spew her victim card of lies. Started? You’ve already tried and failed. 0 credibility when y’all cry “elites, elites!1!” And then claim the racist one made a mistake and forgive her 😂😂😂😂 foolish
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Dude, we could play this game all day lmao you’re not thinking clearly. Your own logic against you, why aren’t you condemning Roseanne at all but only bill and whoeverthefuckelse that’s unrelated to this thread? Bad faith actor
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Ur bad at this deflection thing
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Obviously racism is condemnable and don’t cherry pick who is “allowed” to. This is Roseanne’s twitter why the fuck would I bring up anyone else? Idiotic. And why do I focus on her more? Because she had the audacity to try to play the victim afterwards. Comprende?

@Rossirwin11 @Amateurcapper @foxandfriends Oh man, I said LMAO once and it got to you real bad, almost as if your side is the one full of snowflakes. Still investigating, still kneeling. simple.
@Rossirwin11 @Amateurcapper @foxandfriends He started kneeling when they started their investigation into what? Surely you can remember that he started kneeling under Obama’s presidency, right?
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne 1) if it were, it wouldn’t matter because you’re changing the subject of current times which can be fixed to past times which are in the past	2) it’s wasn’t worse, dumbass.
@Dbooneinc @steinhauserNH1 @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump So vote, dude.
@Rossirwin11 @Amateurcapper @foxandfriends We are not past the kneeling because none of you can get over it LMAO
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Misconstrued tweet, lmfao. Obviously I don’t like kids locked up that’s why I’m against your guy Donald. Dumbass
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews Many things show it, you’re trying to tell me you wouldn’t vote for him over whoever is against him even if they have better policy(which is guarenteed). Bull.
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews I think it’s awesome how you’ll defend him no matter what he does. Could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue.
@Azcrusader @touchofclassgrm @therealroseanne Imagine being dumb enough or complicit enough to really believe Roseanne didn’t know lmao I bet you thought trump meant “wouldn’t” too because it fits your narrative.
@HoarseWisperer @ManInTheHoody This goof really thinks he’s an outdoorsman lmfao
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews It’s actually really close to 35% of the time wanna try to defend that?
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews Nononono, it’s the same as fox when trump imprisons thousands of children they run a story about a sad white guy whose image was photoshopped onto a cracker. They’re playing you
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews Well this case is one of distracting from the real news of the day which is making trump look bad. Classic Fox tactic. And it got you
@GaryCGeorge @HBSbgsu @BreitbartNews I’m saying they exist to spin stories and make you think left is evil or sub-70 IQ or just hates America, while simultaneously promoting bigoted narratives and dog-whistled phrases
@Rossirwin11 @Amateurcapper @foxandfriends We agree on that lol I don’t think you can bash someone for kneeling next to one and glorifying someone who wears it as underwear and farts all over it all day
@Brett_Calabasas @Ralphn8r @DRUDGE_REPORT Pff you’re full of shit from sentence 1. What makes you think the right has any entitlement to dictate if she can have a baby or not. Rent prices have absolutely 0 to do with “”thinking women’s votes are in the bag”” got it, Chief?

@igobyMdot @BreitbartNews Reminds me of certain presidential campaign promises
@dreamwriter9 Because you falsely claimed me of being both lmao you are a damn clown. Don’t play that game trying to equate them lmao she’s a, say it with me, a billionaire. THINK I know that she is dodging taxes on her yacht because they’ve uncovered the loophole she used,Fox will never tellu
@dreamwriter9 Lmao can you read? I want someone who spent a lifetime in education and is competent, not Betsy devos. So while Lebron would be an upgrade, I would obviously rather have like I said someone who spent a lifetime in education. “Iranian, bot, not American!!!” And you called me angry
@Quiet_Ri0t @DRUDGE_REPORT Are you on acid?
@graceligon @DRUDGE_REPORT “I ate today, where the hell is world hunger?!” Ur right I’m trolling your horrible logic lmfao
@dreamwriter9 Nono, there you go putting words in my mouth!! I don’t want lebron to be in the position over more qualified people who care about what they’re doing, however devos is not that. So I’d rather have him than her, yet id rather have someone else than him(not Betsy) make sense?
@Quiet_Ri0t @DRUDGE_REPORT You mean scientists get paid a lot because they discover breakthroughs and cures in disease etc etc? Jeez, let’s make a conspiracy out of this because we have nothing else. Nice
@pandemoniumcirc @realdeannalynn @DRUDGE_REPORT Way to delete your idiocy before I could reply. 😂
@Quiet_Ri0t @DRUDGE_REPORT Well it does but let’s ignore science right?!
@dreamwriter9 I’ve been waiting this entire time for an example why you think devos is good for the position. I knew I wouldn’t get much but this long with nothing confirms everything anybody needs to know about Billionaire Betsy.

@dreamwriter9 Where to start...yes it’s a true statement even though it’s not of topic, so thanks for furthering my side. However, that’s your attempt at distracting me from her corruption.

@dreamwriter9 Obscure eh? You endorse tax-dodging on your $40 million yacht while teachers in public schools can’t afford supplies for their students. The difference between our sides is staggering. History of bumper stickers? 👏👏👏so substantial.
@Tiago_Jabur @ABC @KingJames @BetsyDeVos Because a huge amount of citizens are tired of the billionaire tax-dodging $40 million yacht having public school gutting that is there right now, and almost anybody would be an upgrade. Let alone lebron who has done more for kids who need school than that Harpy ever will
@dreamwriter9 @ABC @KingJames @usedgov Or because she tax-dodges her $40 million yacht and clearly doesn’t want what’s best for kids who need an education? It’s really simple when you remove your tribalistic emotions from it all

@ToryLeo2002 @AFKPermanently @cenkuygur @WSJ More and more? We keep buying jets with guns that use discontinued ammo. There’s incredible waste. Many places to cut off the fat.
@ToryLeo2002 @AFKPermanently @cenkuygur @WSJ And we could stop randomly using executive orders to give rich people $100 billion in tax cuts, $717 billion worth of jets and other war machines that we don’t need more of, and afterwards claiming that we can’t afford to keep our people healthy.

@NoFuncDemo @cenkuygur That’s insinuating that trump is currently better than she would have been (or anyone else) which is extremely laughable. In other words you want us to throw away our vote to aid the republicans, because you support them while putting up a front on this account. Try harder

@BrianDees @JaniceDean @foxandfriends @FoxFriendsFirst @jillianmele @SteveDoocy @PeteHegseth @ainsleyearhardt @SchmittNYC U just gonna keep trying insults over twitter or say something of substance? What a life
@BrianDees @JaniceDean @foxandfriends @FoxFriendsFirst @jillianmele @SteveDoocy @PeteHegseth @ainsleyearhardt @SchmittNYC What an angry guy haha guess what not everyone in the world agrees with you get over it. But talking to a wall would be a better use of time, you’ve still said nothing of substance or brought forward a policy with reasons that it’s good for our country. Waste of time and space

@Evil_weirdo @kcwilliams2002 @jillianmele Hahaha! Good one never heard that before!!	I don’t care about her dress, only a right-winger would think that nonsense, I don’t like Fox stance against personal freedom :) 2 while you work and hate to pay taxes that help other people, I take solace in knowing I could help
@jeannetredway @jillianmele @FoxNews No, it’s definitely a common knowledge truth, has been for a long time until roger ailes died, don’t wanna bother showing me sources for your accusations ?
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo It’s really just between accepting what you see and trying to trick yourself into thinking everything’s normal
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo So, what do you call taking the word of a murderous authoritarian over the information of your own intelligence agencies. Then the next day say you meant to say the opposite. Then the next day flip BACK. What’s the man hiding?
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo So, what do you think they had to go behind closed doors without witness for hours to talk about? Normal shit? Lmao. Why’s his demeanor clearly uncomfortable around putin and Kim but the other leaders he ridiculously tries to show dominance over. Psychology isn’t fake news
@johnjamison64 @jillianmele Where do I get this information? How about directly from former fox hosts. #walkaway https://t.co/oTUCXn2PZD
@Evil_weirdo @kcwilliams2002 @jillianmele Lol, nothing I said with 4 letters or less was an insult. Snowflake and brainwashed was the insult, wtf you reading
@johnjamison64 @jillianmele You don’t watch any other networks Lmfao Fox is a cult following
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I mean, I’ll give explanations of policy after policy of his that are horrible for the country but the fact that you’re staying complicit in how he’s being dealt by putin says a ton about why that would be a waste of time
@Evil_weirdo @kcwilliams2002 @jillianmele Because, this is a company that brainwashed millions of Americans every day. Calm the fuck down, I don’t care about her dress, but why do you care so much about what I think? Such a snowflake
She got mad when I pointed out Fox under Roger Ailes forced female employees to wear skirts. What a snowflake https://t.co/IwNiuCSVd5
@JudgeJeanine @foxandfriends Thought you didn’t like snowflakes https://t.co/jxKZz6GzwZ

@spartylover17 @jillianmele You’re extremely creepy but good comeback I guess https://t.co/No4dgApZxB
@GForce909 Hey, how long will it take you to understand I’m not attacking her, goofy ass dude. It’s the gross company she works for that until 2017 said their women employees can’t even wear pants. That’s such a joke, o twist it into your own version of what I said though.
@BrianDees @JaniceDean @foxandfriends @FoxFriendsFirst @jillianmele @SteveDoocy @PeteHegseth @ainsleyearhardt @SchmittNYC It’s called public information? https://t.co/JmzQkstAmL
@jmalmos59 @jillianmele Guess what she did 4 or 5 times. Pretty low I guess
@spartylover17 @jillianmele The clothing police was Fox and roger ailes when they forced her to wear a certain garment. You make no sense
@Evil_weirdo @kcwilliams2002 @jillianmele Memes — the rights version of news and facts
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo There it is, the “we won haha get over it” narrative. Nobody is just salty about 2016 and still living through that, we’ve accepted he’s there and that we have to be very vocal until he’s out. But, you don’t really focus on issues right? No values, only goal is to “own the libs”
@billpeek89 @jillianmele The goofy Trey Gowdy conspiracies that Hillary did it, the way they pin everything else negative in the world on her
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Well as you’ve responded with nothing of political substance and just “seek help, libs suck, cuomo idiot, ur angry!” I don’t think you have a good grasp of what’s happening in the world but it doesn’t matter, if we can’t agree 1+1=2 then we’re wasting our time
@DurkaRippy @jillianmele @HillaryClinton You’re extremely dense aren’t you, of course I don’t object to her clothing she’s fking hot! Which was the goal of Fox and roger ailes, for the women to look fking hot at the expense of their freedom. Which is my point, it’s slimeball Fox, not her. U still don’t get it somehow
@joshradarr @jillianmele @ainsleyearhardt Just stop, guy, you’re not her hero. https://t.co/d4kEZJzjpu
@jillianmele I wouldn’t expect any other statement from Fox, “I cannot comment”
@Evil_weirdo @kcwilliams2002 @jillianmele That’s a straw man argument. Obviously certain jobs make you wear certain attire. The difference here is roger ailes forced her to be crossing her legs 99% of the time and the old men watching love it.
@morourke133 @jillianmele No shit brotha you’re not too sharp
@DurkaRippy @jillianmele @HillaryClinton Since you want to play that game —“negative, I simply prefer the liberty of a self-chosen wardrobe”	Now stfu
@morourke133 @jillianmele Yeah man and they’re all being snowflakes haha
@wbeejaaa @jillianmele Uhh, prove me wrong first
@jillianmele So you don’t have anything to say about why they only let you swear short skirts on camera until 2017? We all know the creepy culture that goes on there at Fox...you shouldn’t think I’m attacking you because I’m not, it’s the scum you work for
@jmarkert20 @jillianmele The point, which for some reason is so hard for conservatives to understand, is how fucked up the culture at Fox is, the women objectified and clearly being used as visual tokens, not to mention all the stories of sexual abuse from those who have already left. So creepy
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo You the one started complaining about cuomo having a different opinion than you? The hypocrisy smh
@JCHTEXAS @jillianmele But, that never happened
@jillianmele Thanks for the replies by the way, no famous anchor that knows they’re right would argue on Twitter with a burner account hahaha
@billpeek89 @jillianmele Oh ho, here we go! You’re a Benghazi conspiracy pusher and gonna talk about gullibility 😂😂 what’s next pizzagate, sandy hook, the moon landing??
@BobbyNoles74 @jillianmele Nope not harassing. Asked her if she’s tired of being told how to dress in front of millions. Very snowflake-ish
@GForce909 Straw man argument, point was fox forced them until roger ailes died. What does any other news having a good looking anchor have to do with anything?? And then to top it off you blame all “libs” , ahahaha just accept not everyone sucks up to Fox
@BobbyNoles74 @jillianmele 1) you call it harassing which is hilarious, what a conservative snowflake. 2) I’m not going at her at all, it’s Fox that’s all messed up
@RuntotheRight @foxandfriends When did I say anything about shopping? You might need a nap...
@HappyCycler @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Full circle, 0 substance. Predictable
@jmarkert20 @jillianmele ? They weren’t allowed this until roger ailes died. What exactly are you trying to defend?
@RuntotheRight @foxandfriends Im waiting for you to say something of substance, sure I can take your substance-less jibber-jabber.  I’m not don, that’s an insult
@jillianmele Yes, I understand that since Roger Ailes passed you have been allowed to wear pantsuits as well. Pretty bad that it takes until 2017 to be allowed that, don’t you think? I mean....clearly it’s for objectification reasons, getting these old men to watch brainlessly https://t.co/bm55xqhs1J
@RuntotheRight @foxandfriends Talking about pics but your pic is a generic cat found off google? Lol... sorry but wisdom really isn’t your strong suit as you proclaim

@38O9127469 @PresidentSnider @RickDutton2 After reading the aggression of this tweet I have to point out that not everything translates to English but good attempt at looking genius
@PresidentSnider @foxandfriends Nope, gonna pull a you on you		THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR POLITICS CANT YOU RIGHT-WING LUNATICS SHOW A SHRED OF RESPECT FOR FALLEN AMERICANS?? IT IS NOT THE TIME TO BE POLITICAL THERES BEEN A TRAGEDY IN THE WORLD
@frediecruze @TIME ?? The last few days/weeks have nothing to do with those other people you named, only trump took the word of putin over our own intelligence agencies, and agreed it would be a good idea to send our diplomats there to get tortured. Took a 98-0 congressional vote to say fuck off
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Read slowly, interpret rationally. Much higher chances I can go in public and not get harassed for my ethnicity (by anybody, every example you’ve used is 👮‍♀️)Much lower chances for blacks, Latinos, etc. Nothing hyperbolic; stats are free to look up
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Nope wrong again. When you see it in video, how can you claim it to be hyperbolic? That’s your answer on anything because I can claim hyperbole to anything you say it doesn’t mean anything substantial. Suppose ur gonna once again ask for exact video and instance I’m tlkn abt?
@frediecruze @TIME (I knew you’d be referring to the Cold War) no son you’re way off, just the last few days Putin called for American citizens to be sent to Russia for “interrogation” (torture, murder), admitted election tampering, and many more disturbances.
@frediecruze @TIME Barely been a few hours what planet you from
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody 😴😴sounds like a biased unsubstantial OPINION filled read so no thanks I’ll continue to pay attention day to day. Of course there are, did I say every single one gets shot? You’re full of logical fallacies
@mrgfwilliams @RepJasonSmith @MissouriGOP Actually they’re learning to despise him!! Pointless tariffs after all. 3rd slogan huh? Think your brain broke
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody It’s 3am and since I’m white im gonna smoke in my front yard without worry that I’ll get shot using my phone. It’s a really nice privilege to have
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody You’re just now making that up as you go like everything else so far lol and you’ve derailed us from the original point. So, let’s end it
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Again complicit with the unfit officers committing legal murder. I can give you a chain of commands in high tensity situation and because I’m looking for it, I will find 1 small motion you make to “justify” shooting you 7 times. And I’ll get paid leave for it even better
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Omfg how retarded are you not that one either I said his name is Stephon
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody You can always falsely claim that you thought an object was a gun and always get away with the murder, that’s kinda the point here guy.
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody No it wasn’t, it was about someone named Dillon. If we can’t agree that 1+1=2 then we’re both wasting time here
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody I’m not gonna paint it for you in my own story, that’s how biased unsubstantial opinion leaks into the story and misinformation the listener, just look it up he was blasted in his yard unarmed.
@Tictacmytoe1 @AIRtisticUSA @DRUDGE_REPORT Where’s it on this list? Need a “none of the above”

@RepJasonSmith @MissouriGOP How bout those soybean tariffs? Hell yeah farmers love trump!!
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody No, I’m not talking about that, specifically I was talking about Stephon Clark who was shot in his own yard (like I said). Again, I’m not too egotistic to admit I have way fewer stresses throughout the day than the average minority.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost @harleydavidson “Wharton” dude you act like money can’t buy you this type of shit. I’m still replying out of entertainment purposes at this point but everything I’ve read from you has been a fallacy or non sequitur or straw man of some kind
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost @harleydavidson “Trump is smart and the country is dumb” you puppet, it’s true when he said he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and you’d all still vote for him
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost @harleydavidson 😂you’re cherry picking which smart guys opinions you want to run with and which to omit, based on what they think of your guy. No,son, those guys just want to line their pockets more and trumps policies do that for rich people only. Makes complete sense
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost @harleydavidson “Harley only wins long term” 1 lmao you’re saying they will do bad now, and will do good again when trumps gone. I already know that. 2 tesla not being able to compete because of tariffs, is a good thing to you?
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody No, I’m not playing this game haha. Everyone’s seen videos of the cops shooting someone on the ground or turned around. Oh yeah I also don’t have to worry about getting shot in my own front yard because “my phone looked like a gun” one of the perks to being white
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost You mean causing @harleydavidson to move production elsewhere and tariffs on our closest allies is good policy? You’re not a Floridian you’re a fuckin Russian man
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost There it is, the statement that I’ll walk away to, “can’t trust the fbi or our intelligence agencies but I believe everything trump says!!” Nail in the clueless coffin
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost No sir I’m glad you referred to the pee tape because I myself never use that as example! Money laundering, however ...;)
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost Yes, easy to see the similar fuckups of trump and Coolidge, combined with the rush of new industry prior to the collapse. Omitting the effects legislation has on the market, to distract from the original point of trumps policies making us a worse off? Predictable.
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody You’re saying the trial evidence was used to tech a verdict, and I’m saying those verdicts often slant in favor of the officers no matter what evidence is provided. There’s fking videos that show clearly the crime and still nothing happens
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost He didn’t go in with intentions of risking his life man your narratives are always so off. It’s not just his life yet, he’s being blackmailed with information instead of his life at the moment.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost And clearly, if you’ve looked at the similarities between now and the past, it’s easy to see the trend of this market combined with bad legislation, the market will tumble
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost His entire family combined, convenient that it’s fudging numbers when you’re wrong. How’s that admitting anything? As long the new tax is law they’re gonna be saving over a billion yearly...I didn’t even mention all of his friends and staff getting billions.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost What are you trying to imply please be specific, the immigrants are ruining the economy?
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost And, yes probably very much richer after dealing with Putin
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost I know the strategy is to spread misinformation but surely you don’t believe your own bullshit https://t.co/NExZbweO9X
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Seen all the evidence? You’re not providing any evidence! Just saying that it was found to be justifiable doesn’t mean it’s justifiable. “A cop has got in trouble before!!” Isn’t a good look either.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost So, what happened? Since this amateur chart doesn’t have a key, and also shows the same trend since the 60s. Haven’t seen a compelling argument from you yet.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost I’m arguing he got himself into wayyyyuu more than his pea brain expected after dealing with putin. Also don’t forget it’s a billion saved EACH year and that’s just from the tax cut
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost “Wages trickle up” refer to your own damn chart that shows the same wages since the 80s. Guess what happened in the 80s? Reagan and his brainwashing theory of “trickle down” use that head of yours
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody I don’t care that they were incorrectly deemed “justifiable” the law protects their own, an incredible amount are unjustifiable but they get away with it
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost The billion dollars he saved his family this year is enough incentive. Being blackmailed by Putin is enough as well. Also all his billionaire friends and business associates. And he plays an insane amount of golf where have you been?
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost Dude thanks for agreeing with us, prices have skyrocketed and wages are stagnant. Let’s raise that minimum wage!! Now your statement of “because of excess labor” is quite foolish, that your way of blaming immigrants? Lmfao
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost Even the dictionary is making fun of your idiotic choice of a “president” the man you said is 1 of 2 that you respect is literally the joke of the world right now. At least pick a guy that sticks with his treason once he’s said it. https://t.co/bJdrOP3uPV
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost When Republican Congress doesn’t let you do anything, that’s what happens, bankers go free after wrecking our economy. Now can you explain my chart as I did yours? I made sure it was simple to follow
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost So much wrong with this statement too. What makes you think for 1 iota that trump cares about you or anyone else not named trump? “He said so!!” Lmao. Then you make a claim about not wanting to be like Russia when trump is in Putin’s pocket, directs policy as putin sees fit.
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost Yes this shows a recession that was brought on by big banks that were defended by the republicans, and a recovery that obama made happen, into a thriving economy that we know today, that trump gives himself credit for. Anyone can come up w charts man we could go all fkin night https://t.co/EkHL7OkvZE
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost That tactic where you guys point to a past instance and imply that it means we shouldn’t try to change anything currently, really doesn’t work. We’d still have cars without airbags and seatbelts with that logic. No shit he was threatened, he was leading social change, ppl h8 that
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost And my life is not the only life I advocate for, I understand the right only knows “me, me, ME!!!” But the legislation I want to see benefits most people and not just me. So according to you, if you’re living a tough life right now you suck. 😂😂👌 your karma is being a Magic fan
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost 😂😂 sure they were, he saved us from George W’s awful tenure and put us right back on track, and here we go about to be on the way down again. It’s not that simple — Russia will do their best to meddle again (unless you’re one of those infowars nuts don’t believe the facts)
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost No but another classic talking point from y’all “you’re mad we won!!1” with the assumption that i just want to be mad at trump haha. Rather talk about all his horrible policies but you’re the one that wants to be subjective rather than objective. Right = emotion&gt;logic
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody They also supposedly “can’t just murder you for __________” yet here we are, don’t be dumb. There we go, the classic “where’s  the evidence they’re being racist?!” Because they’ll just say yeah I’m a racist cop. Try harder
@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost Understandable, “to keep sane through some crazy years”, exactly what I’m doing. Except while also getting involved in our democratic process. Look down on me for calling senators, lmfao keep backing your spineless boy Rubio
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Statistics prove the trend to favor my theory over yours.
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody That’s the outrage behind having no motivation to confront them, goofy
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Because your straw man argument doesn’t prove anything. You ever get pulled over for driving while white or walking while white or get the cops called for being in public while white, or accused of stealing for shopping while white? Me neither

@JJ4T12Win @washingtonpost I never use hashtags or all the usual symptoms of the rights bot format. Sorry, Putin’s on your side not ours, the bot accusation doesn’t work like that ;)

@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Because what’s the point your argument had no point?		In your world 1 example of a white person being vitim of a crime proves to you that we’re not generally more privileged, which is laughable
@IFurMEthnWhoMi @ManInTheHoody Why didn’t you include that detail in the beginning? Everything you say is not credible until you provide sources. So, I ate today, where the hell is world hunger? Get a clue Lmfao
