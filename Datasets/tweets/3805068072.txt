@realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll You forgot to mention that it shows 49% disapproval in the same poll.  Not exactly something worth bragging about, but you do you.
@NC_Progressives @msgrumpybunny It's funny how Trump &amp; Republicans don't trust the FBI - until they investigate their candidate, &amp; come up with nothing.  Suddenly the FBI is just the best, most thorough &amp; honest.
@QuancyClayborne @rbsralaw I've wondered if he never actually wanted to win, &amp; keeps behaving badly in hopes of impeachment so he can claim he's a victim of Democrats.  But the Republicans just keep supporting him, no matter what he does or says.  Just a thought.
@MorOfUsThanThem @kylegriffin1 @TeaPainUSA That's entirely possible, &amp; unfortunately, very likely.  But, one can hope...
@scdaylaw @kylegriffin1 Hahahahahahahaha

@cspan It's a very scary time for young women in America when they can be sexually assaulted &amp; your assaulter is proclaimed as innocent by the US President, before the entire country, without a thorough investigation.
@realDonaldTrump She loves being on a different continent than you?
@sahluwal @JoseyRider So apparently when she said "I'm not, thank you" he heard "I'm not thinking".  You could chalk that up to a hearing impairment, but I would expect someone in his position to use some critical thinking &amp; better judgement before saying something so dumb.

@realDonaldTrump I wonder if this has destroyed the alleged victims life?  I think being assaulted is a lot more damaging to a person, than a guy not getting confirmed as a judge.  Why do you ALWAYS take the accuser's side?  That's a pretty big character flaw.
@realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC What a travesty for law enforcement to try to enforce the law.
@ct_wave @Sutekhseth @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure there's ever a good time for an alleged assault. Just because the timing is inconvenient doesn't mean the accusations aren't true, let's see how the investigation plays out.
@realAliTweets Before Trump was elected, they blamed rising ins. premiums on Obama.  But now, for some reason, it's either still "Obama's fault", or they think premiums just go up every year.  My Dad is strictly an R &amp; he was recently complaining about his rising Medicare costs.
Social media has made people less social than ever.  On the bus from the burbs to downtown this morning (for jury duty), everyone had their noses in their phones, headphones on - nobody looks around &amp; chats up the person next to them.  I was just hoping for a little conversation.
@realDonaldTrump How could you, personally, know if the accusations are true or false?  That's what investigations are for.
@realDonaldTrump Way to stick your nose into every situation.  So much for "letting it play out".
People defend those accused of crimes because "I've always known them to be a nice person".  I'm sure no serial killers or murderers had neighbors who thought they were great.  People need to wake the hell up &amp; start thinking for themselves or things will get a lot worse.
Fire alarms went off in my building last night, less than half the building vacated their apartments waiting for the fire dept.  Guess how much time would have been wasted rescuing people if there had been an actual fire?
Hurricane?  No worries, I can ride it out.  Then later these people end up dead or calling for a rescue.
I've come to the realization that there are a lot of stupid people, it's no wonder the current president was elected.
@lizfinger1 It's all about winning for them, pushing their agenda.  No time for truth, that just needlessly slows things down.
@sandybeach1028 @jwhallin @RepDeSantis Oh, but he sent that tweet in anger, so it's ok.  The new world order excuses what you say in anger, on Ambien, or if you're just an asshole - but that's only if you're a republican.  If you're a democrat you better just keep your thoughts to yourself.
@JohnRJohnson @67jewelCDH Nicest guy ever.  😏
@tammy_beatse @DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump Might be even closer to 100% - I'm guessing it's more like 90%.  Unfortunately, older women just accepted bad behavior, just "men being men".  If my grandma was still alive I'd bet real money she fit that category.
@cathyob1 @Acosta @lizfinger1 And don't forget, any women accusing Democrats are telling the truth.  Weird.

@TheGetUpCoach Thanks, you too!!
@kaitlancollins @jaketapper Is it just me that hears a whiny little kid saying "it's not fair" most of the time when he talks?  My kids outgrew that phase; why hasn't he???
@jaketapper What a beautiful story, thank you for sharing this.

@realDonaldTrump I didn't know Rush was still alive.
@PhilKadner @Suntimes Whenever I order a hamburger from Culver's, they ask me if I want cheese on it.  I always have to bite my tongue to keep from saying "if I wanted cheese, I'd have ordered a cheeseburger.". Every. single. time.  😏

@realDonaldTrump Did you forget?  You cancelled the summit.

@realDonaldTrump I wouldn't have expected a busy President to have so much time to tweet.  BTW I'm also still waiting for the huge tax cuts you said were coming, the tiny bump in my checks is barely noticeable &amp; doesn't cover the rising gas prices.
@xfinitymobile Service is great but they charge you an arm &amp; a leg for it.
@realDonaldTrump Negative is not the same as fake.
@HennepinJobs @HennepinAtty Hopefully candidates can spell "litigation" correctly 🤣
@RealJamesWoods I like how you put "fair" in quotes to indicate irony.

@AaronBlake From your keyboard to Trumps mouth, I just heard him say it.  It's funny how it's not about the lousy things these people have done, but how people are "abusing them" by making those actions known.  I don't think that's what the word abuse means.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously, what Is up with The random capitalization Of words?
@Parkour_Lewis @susanmcp1 You know dang well if they actually discover life on another planet, they're not going to let any of them in without extreme vetting 😏
@yarnsandmusings @AP_Politics @a_fly_guy But hey, it's only money 😏
@ItsGoneAwry @matthewjdowd All of them.  Listening is only the first step.
@michellehals @JosNBanks @theordway I saw it last night too, &amp; raved about it today at work to everyone who would listen.  Loved it!!!  ❤️
@VegasJohnny @fred_guttenberg Wasn't there a shooting in a movie theater a couple years ago?  We'll need clear popcorn &amp; beverage containers next.
@andylassner I used to like James Woods until I learned he's a crazy person.
@FreeRangeKids @Popehat This would be like suggesting that a car thief, once released, could no longer be around cars.  Once time has been served - especially after 20 years &amp; no additional offenses - he should be allowed to be at the hospital with his son.
@realDonaldTrump Some of us can't afford to lose billions.  I've lost a bunch of money in my 401k since the beginning of this year, thanks to the games you're playing.  I'd appreciate it if you'd knock it off, since I'd rather not have to continue working until the day I die.
@julianborger no puppet...no puppet..
@realDonaldTrump You keep forgetting that news isn't fake just because you don't like or agree with it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr "Everyone needs to be loved, especially those do not deserve it."	-fortune cookie
@realDonaldTrump Since when "must" the Supreme Court be held by Republicans?  I don't think that's how that's supposed to work.
@realDonaldTrump @mitchellvii Too bad my 401k has gone down several thousand $ since the start of 2018.  Before that it was climbing slowly &amp; steadily.
@realDonaldTrump Have you seen the Netflix documentary series "Dirty Money"?  The episode about Donald Trump is really interesting.
@realDonaldTrump Just saying there's no collusion doesn't mean it's true; that's what the investigation will determine.  Stop wasting your breath even talking about this &amp; just let the investigation run it's course.
@RicardoSimmons7 @smerconish @TedNugent @SXMPOTUS @SIRIUSXM I came here to post this, too 👍
@thehill Is he marketing these to the Dreamers that might all end up getting deported?
@Thelast_try @AP Well, that's because that was when things were great, in his mind.
@Andrea88284901 @DemocratElle @SqueakilyJr @deemoe069 @jsandlock75 @Lawrence We might need to have a few new elections.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends The president getting their intel from a TV show seems wrong somehow.  There has to be a better source for their info.
@realDonaldTrump Who cares?  You're president now, so just deal with it &amp; stop looking for people to assign blame.
We finally scored some cool stuff from the MSP travel trolley!  He got the sleep mask, the cards are mine 👍 #flywithFi
@smerconish I'm not a fan of this unless it's only as an option for those who prefer this route.  Also - if we're concerned about people spending their benefits on unhealthy items, why don't we care about wealthier people buying unhealthy items?  Isn't obesity &amp; diabetes an issue for all?
@realDonaldTrump I thought you wanted to bring our country together?  Insulting people you disagree with or don't like isn't an effective way to do that.
@finnygo @realDonaldTrump @BretBaier I wonder if anyone suggested to him that maybe he could just try being less divisive.
@DonaldJTrumpJr "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."
@realDonaldTrump So much for your remark earlier this week that you'd approve whatever deal they come up with.
@realDonaldTrump When my son was in elementary school he sometimes said "I'm smart".  I always reminded him that smart people don't have to tell others, it'll be obvious.  If you have to tell people you're smart, you're not as smart as you think you are.
@aasteviea @smerconish @SXMPOTUS I'm also not saying either are guilty or innocent, because I wasn't there &amp; I don't know - but why are the situations being treated differently?
@aasteviea @smerconish @SXMPOTUS No, obviously that's not what I'm saying.  But Spacey is assumed guilty due to allegations - career over.  Why are politicians given more leeway than actors?  Politicians are the ones voting on things that actually impact our lives, they should be better people.
@smerconish @SXMPOTUS How is this any different than what's happening w/Kevin Spacey?  Spacey's career is over because of improper conduct allegations, why shouldn't Moore's be?  If anything, politicians should be held to even higher standards than Hollywood.
I just got GREAT support from Jason &amp; Max @TextraSMS! Thank you!!		More @ https://t.co/C7NX6eWLh3
