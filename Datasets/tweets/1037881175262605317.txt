It was me, in EEOB, with an anonymous op-ed. https://t.co/9VHpXe4vdM
This is actually printed and laminated and pinned in all our cubes. It’s well-known that POTUS is a patent moron. https://t.co/BTW3lJFHC3
@farhip Talking loudly about the White House, while continuing to wear my White House ID badge prominently, at the main bar at Old Ebbitt’s 🤷‍♂️
OHHHHH THAT’S what I forgot to do yesterday! https://t.co/xxowkFKrdL
We are KILLING IT!!! https://t.co/AJPZHc8vj9
@molly_knight I wouldn’t call him a pet, but when I’m at work they make me feed, water, and walk him, and open up closets when he gets locked in and starts bleating... 🙄 https://t.co/6aZbG9wPL6
@mkkraemer @RPG_volley Hey now.
People are texting at work me about the Flynn sentencing like I’m not knee deep in enough insane administration appointees’ fuckery day-to-day.
@CattitudeLady We’re just fooling around.
Yeah but we can’t say all that in the press briefing, duh. https://t.co/I5LpPC6Qk5
I invite anyone to pile their thanks in one hand, take a shit in the other, and see which one fills up first unless there’s a raise in the near future. https://t.co/H3tU8MMow4
@dandrezner Really, what else can I do, though? https://t.co/byETeJLiYp
I’m fairly certain neither this absolute fucking dolt - nor the median voter - could tell us the traditional differences between liberal and conservative philosophies. https://t.co/9syFQmv8VV
@CattitudeLady @pptsapper Delicious.
@GPatrick The Pentagon Wars does that for me. Too stressful, keeping the Generals happy, keeping Congress happy, trying to spend billions of dollars. Too real, man.
They are literally laughing at us on the world stage.		I knew I should have put [HOLD FOR LAUGHTER] in the TelePrompTer. https://t.co/Gk1dNBoRrK
@redcanwine Better yet: stab him in the ear.
I believe he’s still a virgin. And likely assaulted. https://t.co/KCC9KIp9VY

.@DonaldJTrumpJr, @EricTrump, and @jaredkushner:		‘Sup, patriots?!		Let’s hear your best “I was gonna join, but...” stories! https://t.co/MBcZtWVNLV
@dandrezner I have issues with this. This is not how my people dress. We are a culture, not a costume.
My buddies in other departments and I have a running competition to see who can get their principal to say te most batshit insane thing.		We all owe Steve in HUD a drink this week. https://t.co/UQfANZKpXx
Some days, it’s just so hard to come up with new ways to confuse the ever-loving fuck out of the American people.		But... “when you’re doing what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life.”		https://t.co/k4censfbxR
If I had to guess, @SebGorka, you were probably scouting out the best observation deck or clock tower from which to pick off innocent people with some garbage-ass rifle https://t.co/pZaYDQ9VPh
This is exactly how I tried to leave the White House. https://t.co/PqGVB3z008
@LadyLovesTaft I am Tampa’s Jill Kelley; philanthropist, diplomatic advisor to ambassadors, the youngest former South Korean Honorary Consul and only Ambassador to General James Mattis at United States Central Command.
On one hand, I wish my bosses weren’t complete spineless wimps when dealing with this Jos. A Bank-wearing anthropomorphized big toe.		On the other hand, those bureaucratic chops are the envy of any anonymous junior staffer.		But he’s still a grotesque shit-weasel. https://t.co/oboos9NrWN
WHOA BRO SICK BURN		Aren’t you a cleared government official? Oh wait... https://t.co/YoyHAULAXw
@armyguyJustin I’m going to stay a Junior Staffer forever.
Two truths can co-exist.		Eric Trump can be and is wildly fucking stupid, and 		a team of five of us poor working-level schmucks had to workshop all afternoon to craft the little prick’s ‘shekels’ comment. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/BHcUWv0vsE
Tell me your unit. https://t.co/dGkYakXgGa
.@DefenseOne if you keep this crazy talk up, how’s @southcomwatch going stay relevant??		It’s indisputable that undocumented ISIS fighters are sneaking Iranian nukes the US to fuel the demand for counterfeit Russian Fentanyl. Obvi. https://t.co/vGAJzPfpFv
.@TIME this is why nobody sits with them at lunch or during PCCs 😐		Or funds them. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ADyljbqYkr
The “best military in the history of the world” can’t even withstand a hurricane?! 🤔		Maybe it’s time to give some of that fat budget to civilians 🙄 https://t.co/0p0BPrgNOF
Frankly, I’m flattered. ☺️ https://t.co/TQnExRpyus
@usawtfmJ1 Not anonymous enough for my liking 🙄
@emilyctamkin Ham and bagels are delicious, together and separate. Are these those “bots” the kids were talking about? Like from Russia? 🤔
@luckylil_13 If “I’m a veteran” is the central plank of your platform, hard pass. The Deep State has taught me there are more elements of national power than cowboy hats and helicopters.
My biggest critique: @realBobWoodward didn’t interview enough anonymous junior officials!		We’re... the adults in the room moderating ...adults... in the room who think they’re adults - look, it’s all very meta.		Our democratic republic is now a turducken of subversive maturity. https://t.co/hCwuhQ4IlU
Our office has just been retasked.		We are now feverishly developing policies and strategies responding to the prospect of California becoming one large person because of what a fucking dunce this guy is. https://t.co/cmkChzgEMl
Strap in for the ride! Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-style foreign policy is going *exactly* how you think it would! https://t.co/kjSd0PDvJ8
Before the weekend is out, spare a thought and pour some out for the eloquent - and I assume handsome - anonymous junior official who no doubt wrote and rewrote most of that op-ed THROUGH LIKE SEVEN DRAFTS, Mike - er - boss.
@JohnTOCradio @USAWTFM_PAO @SecArmy @SecArmyPAO @TheWTFNation The system works!		As the parable goes, “if you save the life of even one starfish... he might end up mass murdering the very people we were trying to win over with our propping up a slipshod army and kakistocracy.”		This would make a great demotivational poster.
@pfcilng @USAWTFM_PAO @SecArmy @SecArmyPAO @TheWTFNation Yeah, but show me one good NCO who hasn’t had an NJP in their day 😂
More Americans probably remember this was happening in 2004 than their two active wars.		I hope their emotional scars have healed. https://t.co/ibUnuWNwlc

My opinion @SebGorka is that your cranium is probably shown to scale with the actual Capitol dome, and just as full of ethno-nationalism. https://t.co/u9P2KttJVv
Whoa whoa whoa guys, let’s not get our Deep States confused.		Us Republican appointees who think POTUS is a batshit-crazy, incompetent dotard who courts violent racists, we steer well clear of closeted liberal civil servants who think those same things.		Jeez. Show some respect. https://t.co/PCQTqmsa6k
RT @TheMERL: Goodbye Burt Reynolds. 		You were neither English nor especially rural. 		But you had a fine moustache.		And we respected that.
The trick to being a leader in government is really making sure people know how much you don’t read.		Demand only bullet points. Less than one line. Hell, less than six words!		Never read your emails. Berate your staff for not answering yours! Make them re-send! Ignore those too!

RT @FrankBruni: Mystery solved: They ALL wrote the Op-Ed. It's a White House remake of "Murder on the Orient Express."
