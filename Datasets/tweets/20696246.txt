@greylord Obviously we're not talking about Objectivism anymore. We're talking about the way it's used to influence political ideology.
@greylord So, I guess the word "freedom" means "discounting the needs of the population in favor of my own personal desires"?
@greylord Because you live in a society where your individual interests aren't always as important as you'd like to think they are.
@greylord Except, people aren't always looking out for their own best interest.
@greylord People are selfish some of the time, but not always -- derailing objectivism from the self-evident philosophy Rand claimed is was.

@funkomatic You can make that assumption. I'm sure my tweets will become even more obnoxious as we get closer.
@TylerATheo Well thank you very much. How did you stumble on it?
Just wrapped up the production on "Astrology of City Lights." http://t.co/0D1jat5N
Survived Iowa. Barely.
Guess which one I used. http://t.co/rgruBE2H
Yup. Cheese balls.  http://t.co/I1A6CGGR
Iowa is windy and it smells like feet.
I was just in a restroom where someone yelled "oh god!" from one of the stalls. I left.
On my way to Iowa. Gross.  http://t.co/leeQQYfi
@stuckpixel dude that guy is sweet. I can't help it.
Is there a way that we as a society can vote alanis morissette off the radio?
My wife just got beer flavored ice cream
@bethanyhallen well look who it is.
@jdawgc dude. You need to reevaluate. Cadbury eggs are delicious.
Anyone who doesn't like cadbury eggs is a communist.
Super sick. Awesome.
Pizza Ranch is for classy people.
Eating Cadbury eggs and playing video games today. Being an adult is awesome.
@ihearteheart does Eden listen to a lot of counting crows? #lyricjokes
Congratulations, America. You've somehow found a way to get even fatter. http://t.co/tkIvzsn1
@TheHussman Yes you should. My music is the best music in history.
@TheHussman More like I'm BACK on Twitter. Did you miss me?
@funkomatic Dude. You stay away from me.
@chelsV Wait a minute...
Who wants a shirtless hug from Ryan?
I'm starting to suspect that most of our followers are porn stars. #notcomplaining
My feet smell so bad today. But if any of my students mention it, they will get an instant F for the semester.
@chrispetterson And my hope for future generations.
@ihearteheart Dude. Today I'm wearing a suit. Fancy, right?
@chrispetterson What's he sabotaging? His heart?
@funkomatic I think we can assume that both are true.
Today, I watched a dude walk out of the gas station with 4 hot dogs, get into his car, and drive right to Burger King.
@ihearteheart It's mostly your fault. I can't let you out tweet me.
@ihearteheart Well, you were going to ruin it eventually.
Barely half of my students showed up for class today. Art students are incredibly lazy.
@ihearteheart Dude. Remind me to never let you touch my stuff.
Josh will be playing an acoustic show on March 10th at The Beat Coffeehouse. More details to come, but mark your calendars.
Well the super bowl's intro was embarrassing. Nice work NBC
Obama is hosting a google+ hangout? Does that make G+ more or less cool?
@funkomatic completely. You're absolutely right
@billcarroll indeed it does. I wonder if star search actually has a dj division
Is it me or does my child look like a house DJ? http://t.co/0iAkMUqf
High five, everyone.
@ScottDibble are you following us because you're going to use our songs in your upcoming campaigns?
@bitterrootfires I want to kiss you guys after last night's show.
The Bitterroot Fires destroyed http://t.co/2xLaowVk
Sleeper and the sleepless just hit the stage  http://t.co/ohFFHmYY
Yeah I'm going to Pizza Ranch for dinner. Get off my back, mom.
@Lilitree Woah.
@sloucherzine Nah. It's her fault. I don't know her, so I'm on your side.
@sloucherzine seriously? Bass players are dicks.
Remember when I ate all that Mongolian food? Now it's time to hit the gym.
@Lilitree He probably calculated the probability of getting murdered before ordering the pizza. Benefits of being a math teacher.
@sloucherzine really? What happened.
Today, I will eat Mongolian food because I'm fat. Screw you for judging me.
Are you all coming to our show on Saturday? You should be.
@Lilitree it sounds like he would.
@seymourblue screw that crap.
@Lilitree really? I kinda like his style.
Someday I will have a pizza delivered to me in class, in front of all my students.
Shameless is an amazing show. Anyone who disagrees is an idiot.

Hitchens died today? Looks like I'm getting drunk tonight.
@joshuajwirtanen Hey. You've tweet like 5 times in the last half hour. I think you're cut off for the day.
Mafia family can lick a b-hole. Stop asking me to play it.
Pizza Ranch is for classy people.
@audioalt word.
Today I will use my extensive vocabulary to make people feel badly about themselves.
Josh and Ryan's side project "Elephant Heart" will be playing on January 14th. You should probably go. http://t.co/jvnlPrvE

Woah. It's been a while since I bothered all of you. I might have to ramp up my obnoxious posting.
Instead of having an NBA season, I say we have handicapped players play against the WNBA all stars. That should be fair. #NBA #WNBA
Cancer bait. #NicknamesForBreasts #NicknamesForTesticles
@noisy_bishop_jr Maybe I will.
@funkomatic Maybe I will.
This record is starting to feel done. I might have to start posting some preview tracks.
@yumstationery Geeze. Well nice work. I'm sure they're all pretty sweet.
@yumstationery 4th! Geeze! Settle down over there! Yeah. He is my first. He's pretty awesome.
@xoMusicLoverxo You're right about that too.
@xoMusicLoverxo You're clearly right.
@yumstationery I just had a kid in August! Is this one your first?
Wow. It has been a long time since I've had something funny to say. You people need to be more entertaining.
Just heard someone say the most offensive phrase in history: "I really want to see Soul Surfer."
Wendy's has the best BBQ sauce. Write that down.
I propose that no one has ever genuinely liked Huey Lewis and the News
"I don't want to guacamole. That shit tastes like broccoli" said the taco bell patron with the well-refined palate.
I just told my bladder to go to hell http://flic.kr/p/a9Gikk
@jes3ica really? That seems strange.
Is anyone else amazed that the WNBA is still around?
I'm pretty sure that our new record will win 100 grammys
I'm pretty sure that our new record will win 100 Grammys.
Kevin James needs to stop making movies immediately.
@JennySabetti fans of my band will get their own state: Hot Land USA
@JennySabetti You'll be famous, thanks to me.
When I'm in charge, I'm going to heard all psychics into Iowa and drop a nuke on them. Two birds.
@JennySabetti you're probably right. Wisconsin is a jerk too. Same with Iowa.
@JennySabetti Wisconsin is kinda a jerk too. But not as big.
@JennySabetti yeah. Don't do that. MN is a jerk
Hey minnesota. Screw you.
Dear god soccer is boring.
Any food can become delicious with enough soy sauce.

RT @Elfiem: The Sloth Death of a Custodian by Parachutes Vole #animalbands apologies to @parachutesfail http://myspace.com/parachutesfail
@Elfiem Ha. Awesome.
My house is too hot. I'm abandoning it for the wolves.
@xeniterhood I would think that you'd be used to it by now.
I wish I could explain how sweaty my sack is right now.
My house smells like puppy urine.
@chrispetterson you are a wise man. Baseball is for dillholes.
@chrispetterson I have no idea who these footballers are. Soccer and I don't really get along.
I'm watching univision at a Mexican restaurant and a children's  choir is playing. What a perfect evening.
Spent the day purchasing the shittiest car I could find.
Checking Jake Champlin and Luke Hawley's show at a coffee shop that's a thousand degrees.
Paying bills is for rich republicans. I'm done with it.
Worked out some of the kinks in Hemlock Lane tonight.
@funkomatic Done and done
Anyone want to help me burn down my neighbor's house? I'll buy pizza.
I say we just give Texas to Mexico. Who's with me?
@xoMusicLoverxo I agree!
@xoMusicLoverxo It is pretty good. I think it'll probably win a grammy.
New song. http://fb.me/CACCNkob
Parachutes Fail has a new amp. And some new beats. And a mustache.
Car accident. Awesome.
Time to check twitter for my daily fix of cliches and naive, incoherent advice.
Programming beats for Hemlock Lane.
@jdgonzalez I know dude. So gross.
@benredmond if that's true, then I hate you.
Seriously? http://flic.kr/p/9JNFy9
@taylorseo Graphic Design
Fewer than half of my students showed up today. So, I moved the final exam up to today.
I wish dairy queen sold Swiss cheese blizzards.
Pizza and video games.
I jut rode my bike for a half hour. Now I need some cheesecake.
@KaraokePhil dude. My students love me. If they don't, they get an F.
I just gave my students a midterm. They hate me now. Awesome.
Rain always makes my nipples pointy.
@noisy_bishop_jr so much more
@audioalt no kidding. And everyone recently stumbled onto their first Ayn Rand novel and thinks they're smart enough to have an opinion.
I swear. The main purpose of twitter is for anti-intellectual dillholes to post naive platitudes every hour.
@cyberRAH612 neither of those things are quantifiable, though.
I just bought tons of cheese. Go to hell, waistline.
Would someone please explain to me what it takes to be happy?
Spent the last few weeks working on the production for "Horseshoes and Hand Grenades." Things are coming along swimmingly.
The meatpuppets are still making new music?
Off to sit in a 5 hour long meeting. I can't wait
Every time the new puppy cries, I laugh at him. I'm going to be an awesome parent.
I love you Stephen fry
@xoMusicLoverxo jack Russell terrier.
Went on a road trip this weekend and came back with a tiny new puppy.
@RuthsArtsLab we miss you as well. Hopefully we'll get this thing done and hit the road soon.
@KaraokePhil dude. That sounds like the worst trip in history.
@RuthsArtsLab hey! Sorry for the delay. Things have been crazy. We're still recording, so no shows on the docket quite yet.
This restaurant plays non-stop eagles music. Gross.
I'm the only smart person on earth.
high fives for everyone!
I got free food at this wedding. Awesome.
I'm at a wedding. I hate weddings.
@nonfinite are you left handed?
@Dooderwear what! I'm not stupid. Left handed people are gross. That's science.
Left handed people are gross
I just found out that my friends are bitshit crazy
@UBLF no songs like that. Just uninterpretable depressing diddies.
@UBLF were finishing our full length record at the moment.
When this day is over, I will murder everyone I know.
@UBLF I'm here! Now we can do the virtual make-out session you were asking about.
@UBLF pretty damn good. Yourself? We may have to finish this conversation in the morning though.
@UBLF bud-dum-dum
Class is going to come early tomorrow.
@MacieHilts3204 you're a little strange, aren't you?
@currentlykelli DM your email address to me and I'll send you some musics.
@currentlykelli is what for sale? Our musac?
@currentlykelli ha. Sorry. That happens sometimes.
@currentlykelli this is probably for the best
Ryan and I just got done making sweet, sweet music.
@currentlykelli you have the bacon ice cream?
@currentlykelli No. No. Bacon ice cream sounds terrible. Also, I don't eat meat.
@currentlykelli @stlcardsguy let me know how it is. Seriously.
@StLCardsGuy @currentlykelli there's a gelato place at the mall of America.
Just got done watching The Social Network. Extremely brilliant.
@xoMusicLoverxo so gross. Right?
@currentlykelli @stlcardsguy dude. Bacon ice cream is gross.
@10riku7b it didn't cause me emotion. What did I do wrong?
I seriously just discovered a bacon ice cream http://flic.kr/p/9pSpPa

This iPad is sucking the anger from my personality and replacing it with pure happiness. Soon I'll have nothing to tweet about.
@xoMusicLoverxo sad
@xoMusicLoverxo trust me. It would.
@xoMusicLoverxo if you had an iPad 2, life would feel less hopeless.
@xoMusicLoverxo that sounds awful
Sitting around eating falafel and surfing the Internet on my iPad 2. Best day ever.
Someone is going to get slapped today.
@C3rvantes Really. Sounds good man. Have fun.
One of my students just went outside and smoked a bowl. He thinks he's sneaky, but he smells pretty awesome.
@C3rvantes Evolution is a puzzle that has been adequately solved. Seriously. Anyone who doesn't agree doesn't understand the evidence
@C3rvantes Evolution is a theory in the same way that gravity is a theory. We know it to be true and can see the results.
@C3rvantes I'm not being hyperbolic. 99% of all biologists on earth believe that evolution is the best explanation.
@C3rvantes Not a single scientific journal has ever been published regarding the validity of creationism. There is no disagreement.
@sqeptiq Dude. Find the crocoduck site on facebook so we can make fun of people more. Please. Making people sad is important.
@C3rvantes Also, you should search for the crocoduck page on facebook. I run it and we talk about this constantly.
@C3rvantes You're definitely free to agree/disagree with me, but you that doesn't make your opinion valid. I have the facts on my side.
@C3rvantes If life must come from somewhere, where did god's life come from?
@C3rvantes It doesn't depend on the prof. It depends on the facts and definitions of the words we use.
@C3rvantes I can tell you with 100% certainty that life DID evolve on this planet and I can show about a billion journals that explain how.
@C3rvantes I'm not a public school teacher, but you're close.
@C3rvantes I wouldn't ever block you man. These conversations are what make me tick.
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq We're not talking about a flat earth. We're talking about how those two statements disagree with one another.
@C3rvantes We're talking about creationism/evolution. Not parables. My point was that you can't believe in both.
@sqeptiq I think @C3rvantes is less nutty than you think. He just doesn't know the definitions to the stuff we're talking about. No big deal
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq I guess you can disagree with reality all you'd like, as long as you're willing to be made fun of.
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq Creationism and evolution have dichotomous definitions. It's like saying "I believe the earth is round and flat"
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq No one is railing on you for interpreting the bible literally. However, you can't redefine words to fit your needs.
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq You can have as much independent thought as you'd like provided it doesn't disagree with reality.
The first person to bring me a sandwich gets free music for life.
We may have just had a breakthrough...
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq You believe in both? Nice. You're nuttier than an average creationism.
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq Evolution is the belief that higher life forms evolved from lower life forms over millions of years.
@C3rvantes @sqeptiq Creationism is the belief that all life was created in it's current form less than 10 thousand years ago.
@sloucherzine Ha. That's awesome. I am a Psychology student in Minnesota and also teach. We are very powerful and influential.
@sloucherzine What do you do in the UK?
Does anyone else regret NOT murdering a few people from their past?
@sloucherzine mexico?! When can I come down there? Minnesota sucks.
"These New Bruises" just got a snappy new hairdo.
@sloucherzine thanks you sir. I will kiss you if we ever meet
Anyone who genuinely enjoyed 24 has serious mental deficiencies.
I love tormenting my students.
@bbellx I hope you like a punched mouf.
@bbellx You just jumped to the top of the list, cracka.
I aim to punch a white guy in the face.
@RuthsArtsLab Huh. You're nuts.
@xoMusicLoverxo I'd give anything for the low 40's. 2 weeks ago it was below zero. Last week 40. Today 20.
@xoMusicLoverxo Seriously? We've had like 5 snow storms this year. What makes your state worse?
@colorsign Can I stay at your place?
Minnesota is the worst place on earth.
Woke up several hours early and couldn't get back to sleep. Spent that time tormenting the woman who foolishly sleeps next to me.
@xoMusicLoverxo Always a compliment. I'm a very caring an genuine person.
@xoMusicLoverxo Too late.
@funkomatic Don't cry. I think you're awesome.
All the cool kids shop at Ikea.
How many different forms of herpes do you think I have from using rock club bathrooms?
Hooray! I'm awake at 4:30am!
@kayysunshine Sickening? Really? Seems pretty funny to me.
I just found a website that lets me lookup my address and see how many criminals live in my area. A lot more rapists than I expected.
I'm teaching my students how to murder drifters today.
Sweet. This state is suddenly bearable again. So long pants!
Seriously? There's a market for this?  http://flic.kr/p/9hGW2B

Hey twitter. Stop being boring.
@crocoduck Hey. I'm been talking to the guys from grumpy clothing about this account and wanted to see if you'd chat. Could you DM me?
Last night, Jake stayed for 5 hours after practice was over so we could create a trippy instrumental piece.
@sloucherzine You're the best!
@katiebakes Your confessional on deadspin today was pure brilliance. Very nice.
@funkomatic Fair enough.
@funkomatic That's not really talent as much as it is a staff of highly paid advisers and a boatload of money.
Oprah Winfrey has no discernible talents.
I just gave my students the worst assignment in history. I am awesome.
@audioalt Cool
@audioalt Sorry. I'm very busy and important.
@JeffBridell You should probably put a password on that thing before he embarrasses you any more.
@JeffBridell Dude. Some cliche-slinging time traveler from 1995 just broke into your office and used your twitter account.
@audioalt Your mouth is about to get punched.
Someone just described my appearance as "Justin Bieber meets Tom Brady." Best compliment ever.
Ryan and Jake are on their way over. I will greet one with a hug and one with a smack to the mouth. Which one is... http://fb.me/ACGZGtFn
The messages in my DM box indicate that I will be winning several iPads very very soon.
A friend of mine just gave me a late christmas gift: The Biebs http://flic.kr/p/9c2chp
@RuthsArtsLab Why thank you. So far no linebacker traits have started appearing, though.
Drinking purple Gatorade for breakfast. Hopefully this will make me powerful and athletic like a linebacker.
I haven't posted many tweets this week. That just means that I'm going to destroy your inbox next week.
Ryan and Jake are in route. I should probably put a shirt on.

@Ridiculouslaura Me too.
@ruthmini Ha. Why do red plaid pants make you think of me?
Yesterday I imparted my wisdom on college students from 8am until 10pm. I'm going to sleep for a week.
Yesterday Ryan and I spent the entire practice trying to get software setup on his computer. We eventually gave up. Now we're sad.
@chonkeyb1 whatever! I played nintendo too! Best bar ever.
@Jimmy_C I think I'm probably in the same boat.
@taperjean_girl8 you're the best! Thanks!
@Jimmy_C what does it mean to be a top follower? Does it mean that I'm the best? I knew that already.
@jillylivi why thank you!

Parachutes Fail pioneered the "Camero Rock" genre.
@andy_meow I always frame my artwork.
@Jimmy_C The holiday season is shoppers' hell. If you want to plan a rescue we might need a rocket ship and a new anti-christmas planet.

@indymike You'd probably be fine to catch on video. 3D isn't cool enough to spend the cash on.
Just saw Tron. It wasn't nearly as terrible as I expected it to be.
I'm watching "Home Alone 2: Lost In New York," but I wish I was watching "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit."
Watching Scrooged. The Solid Gold Dancers are exquisite.
@MelissaCamille No kidding
Someone just stole a few thousand dollars from my mother. The spirit of Christmas is alive and well.
@ashleyfranks I plan on it.
T-Minus 43 minutes until my last exam. Then I will sleep until next semester.
I can't believe "GPA" is still trending; 90% of the people on Twitter are dumber than a brick. I'm surprised they can even spell GPA
@fckinAMAZIN English class probably brought it down a lot, though. Right?
@fckinAMAZIN Wow. That GPA is way higher than I expected - given how incredibly ignorant you sound.
@HeatherAM we should move somewhere that respects lunar eclipses.
There's a lunar eclipse tonight and I won't be able to see it because there's also a blizzard. Screw you Minnesota.
@audioalt True. I should teach a class.
Picking fights with morons on Twitter is my new favorite pastime.
@fckinAMAZIN In actuality, it's evidence (along with your overall mastery of the english language) for your very small brain. Agreed?
@fckinAMAZIN Obviously you don't follow you're own tweets. You tried to convince us that your low GPA doesn't mean anything.
@Flflola_Melllo I think you might have the wrong number.
@john_w_anderson Well if he wasn't so pretty...
@fckinAMAZIN Someone who can formulate a coherent sentence and utilize proper grammar and punctuation. In other words, "Not FKN IGANT"
@fckinAMAZIN You're an idiot.
@popculturezoo That way I will be a hero.
@popculturezoo I think you should tell terrible jokes while I tell really great jokes. Your jokes will elevate the quality of mine.

Why doesn't anyone ever ask me to host the Oscars?

Can someone explain to me how it's legal for them to use the title "The Real Housewives of Orange County" when they're all obviously men?
@xsethsownstarx I wouldn't lie about something as important as santa.
@audioalt Someone had to say it. Sorry if I ruined your Christmas.
@SantaErik You sir might want to check into some type of hospital.
Santa isn't real.
@LodestoneDynamo Some of it is. Check it out. http://www.facebook.com/parachutesfail
@lnorennny it should be up and running. Try it again.

Complete list of things eaten by me today: 1 Bag of Doritos, 1 Slice of Pizza, 1 44oz glass of Coke Zero, 1 bag of Sour Patch Kids.
@bbellx @audioalt What!? Don't get burned out before the sleep over!
@audioalt @bbellx Liar. I have written down everyone who has seen me in a onesie and you're name isn't in my diary.
@bbellx @audioalt Seriously. We look incredible.
@bbellx @audioalt We're also going to look at pictures of you and laugh. It should be a fun sleep over. I just hope we have enough time.
@audioalt @bbellx There aren't enough couch cushions in a hotel room. And the walls are too thin for our plans.
@bbellx See you tonight, BFF.
@funkomatic Well keep trying. My gigantic rock star status means I have unlimited money and only accept extravagant gifts.
@bbellx Sounds good. The stuff is already in my trunk. Anyone who doesn't have an emergency sleep over kit was never in the boy scouts.
@bbellx Also, you'll need a lot of lip gloss. A lot.
@bbellx That doesn't sound like a very fun sleep over. All you need is the board game "Girl Talk" and a fort made out of couch cushions.
Can a person die from Pizza intoxication?
@BBirchfie6 If I click on this, am I going to be mad that you're my friend on Twitter?
@bbellx Sounds good. I'll come over this evening. You better have a matching one for yourself. I feel a sleep over coming on!
@Dj_mwzix I have a kindle already. I want an iPad. Chop Chop!
@funkomatic I'm a big rock star. I get those for free.
@bbellx Yes please. I'll take the pink one with the dog on the front.
What are you all getting me for Christmas?
@berrytc44 The worst.
Crud. Looks like tonight is going to be an unplanned allnighter.
About to watch the MN Roller Girls beat the crap out of each other.
@john_w_anderson That's true. I am probably the best son ever.
just shoveled my mom out of a giant snow drift and negotiated the car into a warm garage. I'm telling you this so you'll know how nice I am
My world is covered in cold, white garbage.
Thanks to everyone who came out to the 400 Bar last night. Good times.

Holy crap. The color pharmacy sounds better every time I hear them.

@theHeartofMN Got it. I will keep a keen eye out for you tonight.
@theHeartofMN Wait a minute... there are three faces in that picture.
T-Minus 3 hours until the 400 Bar. Put your pants on and get down there!
@theHeartofMN Awesome. It'd be great to put a face to the tweet.
@berrytc44 I would never let school get in the way of rock and roll.
I hope you have cleared your schedule for tonight's show. Ryan and I are both sporting ultra-manly facial hair. http://fb.me/Q51nMT1u

@derekwadle It takes many many moons to complete a new record. Plus we've had to take a break to practice for Thursday's show.
@RuthsArtsLab Why thank you! I really didn't do much though.

Don't forget to draw a big "X" across December 9th on your desk calendar. Actually, you might want to draw an X... http://fb.me/NxTXTTDv
Some NASA scientists are about to announce that they've just discovered the first non-carbon based life form. My head hurts.
@xoMusicLoverxo Hmm. Are you judging me? I will smash as many babies as I want. There's nothing wrong with baby-smashing.
If I ever have a baby, I'm naming it Gallagher and then smashing it with a sledge hammer
@theHeartofMN We love you.
I think my pants are too tight; my penis just fell asleep.
Necks-beards run rampant this November.
Loudon Wainwright and I are hanging out tonight. Well, I have a ticket to hang out with him, but he most likely won't know I'm there.
@audioalt That's pretty awesome. I feel like I need to meet your offspring eventually. Also, the name Desmond is really great.
@audioalt You didn't have a kid. Did you?
@audioalt Well, I might have told you, if you weren't avoiding me.
@audioalt Did you not know?
I wonder if my sister @juliacanderson is ever going to crap that kid out. From the looks of it, probably not.
Nice work @thesarahwinters. The New York Post wants to marry you!
Tonight I will buy several pairs of long underwear.
@derekwadle Also, I'm playing an electric guitar.
@derekwadle Dude. Jake Champlin is playing in our band on the 9th. Too bad you live in Iowa.
@xoMusicLoverxo You're the best.

The neighbors suddenly hate us. Time to burn their house down.
@RuthsArtsLab We will be singing no Christmas Carols whatsoever.
@RuthsArtsLab I suppose that depends on when the meeting is. Doors are at 8. We'll probably hit the stage a little after 9:30
@nicholaspappas @ashleeringtones Well thank you very much. DM your email address to me and I'll fill it with music.
I posted 3 photos on Facebook in the album "Posters" http://fb.me/JuPv95gr
Big news in the near future? Maybe.
@derekwadle Don't listen to any of those other dill holes. Only listen to us.
You should come to our show on the 9th. You'll enjoy yourself.
I saw a fist fight on the way in to school today. Awesome.
@derekwadle Dude. You have no idea.
@josiahkosier Shut up. You know what I'm saying. You're an idiot.
My students are now following me on Twitter. That means they all get As.
@taperjean_girl8 Thanks!
This show just got upgraded to a free show. Get down to the 501 right now!

@taperjean_girl8 Why thank you!
@siriuslyheather Wy thank you!
My life is exciting and everyone is jealous.
City busses are not tidy.
@JakeThatRump You need to shut up!
@ChrisLDickerson And humble.
Turned my assignment in with 2 minutes to spare. I am awesome.
Network connection has been down all day at school. I thought I was going to die. I might be too attached to my lovely internet.
Thank you twitter for filling my platitude intake for the day.
@derekwadle Well, the stuff we worked on this week turned out good, but it still has a long way to go. I'm hoping to wrap it up this month.
@siriuslyheather Whatever. Stalker.
@siriuslyheather Stop Stalking me or I will install 10 ft high electric fence around myself.
@RuthsArtsLab A long, hard and angry battle.
@siriuslyheather Wait a minute... Are you hitting on me?
I'm finally winning the war on terror/fleas.
I saw that Raven Symone was trending and I was hoping she had died. But apparently she's still alive. Bummer.
It's not daylight savings time tomorrow. Set your alarms normally
@derekwadle I've been using the Speak and Spell Hemlock Lane a bit. It's taking on a technological sound. I'll send you some clips later.
@derekwadle I know. I'm actually working on the record right now. Suggestions?
Today I will spend the entire day watching Antonio Banderas movies.
@benredmond Whatever. The only TV personality you've ever been mistaken for is Rosie O Donnell
If you don't like our music, you're a racist.
@benredmond I figured.
@benredmond Dude. Some guy who looked exactly like you cut me off in traffic today. So now I'm mad at you.
@derekwadle Weird. I do care about that one.
I don't care who you voted for and neither does anyone else.
@RissieCup Well, you should probably just drive out here anyway.

Mother Nature is a whore who ruins my stuff http://flic.kr/p/8NAFJm
I just saw a dude in a neck brace that I wanted to put in a neck brace.
My students hate learning.
@americannovel Dude. That's crazy. Tell everyone in your house to stop being pregnant.
Added several strange noises to Hemlock Lane last night. Tomorrow I will be sampling a Speak and Spell.
@americannovel Wait. What?
Found a billion more fleas on my dog. Time to burn my house to the ground with my dogs inside.
When are YOU ready?
This bus has a lot in common with a gas station restroom.
@sloucherzine why thank you kind sir. Any thoughts on that release?
@taperjean_girl8 thanks! You're the best.
@noisy_bishop_jr thanks! I will give you kisses.
@PatrickWight I think you should change the name of your face to "Punch Me. I'm a Dillhole."
@PatrickWight If I say no, am I somehow irresponsible, or just a man of modest means who has chosen greatness over material possessions?
@PatrickWight That's not the car that's broken. Dillhole.
@siriuslyheather No. You should tell everyone. That dude doesn't follow me on twitter. He'll never know.
@siriuslyheather No no. That picture was taken in secret.
@PatrickWight Give me your car and we'll call it even. I've been friends with you for about 8 years now. You owe me.
Someone at my table is drinking this.  http://flic.kr/p/8LXe6w
@americannovel No. No. The DeLorean is back in storage. This is my main car.
@noisy_bishop_jr Not a bad plan. I don't really want Gordon Ramsay to die though. I have a soft spot for him.
@jesseerdmann I hope she makes one on her show and the ants kill her.
@noisy_bishop_jr No way. That dude is angry. I don't feel good about taunting him.
@noisy_bishop_jr You get started on the parade.
@ctrygstad We'll cut her hands off too. It's only fair.
@noisy_bishop_jr They're soldiers. Some soldiers must be sacrificed for the cause.
I wish someone would dump fire ants in Rachael Ray's mouth.
@raderje Yeah. It's not going to cost me anything, because I can't afford to fix it. The car is being junked.
Tonight I will be programming a phat beat for Hemlock Lane. Excited?
The transmission on my car is dead. Things are going great.
Chuck Norris jokes aren't funny anymore. Knock it off or kill yourself.
Oh Twitter. I have forsaken you over the past few days. I'm sorry, but I was busy battling dragons. I'm sure you understand.
@giuliaz1 Not a whole lot. terribly busy with school, recording and work. What's new with you?
@DrNancyMalik No scientific basis has ever been discovered for homeopathy. Also, you're not a doctor. Anything else I can clear up?
More Hemlock Lane action last night. Also Ryan tried to escape but I locked him in the bathroom until he stopped crying.
Hey Twitter. Stop being over capacity. I have things to complain about and I need an audience.
White people are the devil.
Question for you all: Who do you think is less intelligent: The guys from Insane Clown Posse or 50 Cent? I'm trying to decide who I hate.
Today I will say something so offensive that it gets me banned from Twitter.
The people who run construction crews in Minnesota are dumber than construction workers.
Signed up for comcast last week and now must stand in line for an hour to pickup my equipment.
@willconley777 I hope so. My fists need a workout.
Who wants a punch in the mouth today?
@noisy_bishop_jr Well thank you sir. I'm glad you dig the tunes.
@marshallsheldon Just now? Dude. You have a lot of laughing to catch up on.
@noisy_bishop_jr I wouldn't allow you to live.
Did anyone of my Twitter friends go see ICP last night? If you did, I hope you died.
@noisy_bishop_jr I wish they were a practical joke. Then the world would make sense.
@noisy_bishop_jr I'm sure they are. They barely speak english. How would anyone explain it to them?
The insane Clown Posse is in town tonight. Minneapolis just took a major hit to its average IQ.
Week 2 of teaching. I wonder if I have worn out my welcome yet.
Spent some time working on "Hemlock Lane" last night. Things are starting to come together.
Spent the last hour looking for a parking spot. Stupid Monday.
When Ryan gets to practice, I will smother him with hugs.
@chelsV Tried it. Fire works better.
My dogs have fleas. The only way I could get rid of them was to start my dogs on fire.
Signed up for comcast last week and now must stand in line for an hour to pickup my equipment.
@siriuslyheather thanks!
Are we Facebook Friends? http://www.facebook.com/parachutesfail
@RuthsArtsLab I didn't get that. I got the budget flea shampoo. So far so good. A million dead fleas were in the bathtub after their bath.
Found fleas on my dogs last night. Awesome.
Just fought with three Russian dudes on the bus about how much better iPhones were than their crappy phones. I won, of course.
@JakeThatRump Ha. You probably shouldn't. Who knows what kind of favors you'll expect from me in return.

@PatrickWight What did I wait for the last second on?
You little jerks abandoned me.
@RuthsArtsLab Night!
@JakeThatRump Ha. Dude. you're the best. I wouldn't ever actually let you do that. I'm fat enough already.
@JakeThatRump Thanks man. You should send a pizza to my house.
ALL NIGHTER! Who is going to keep me company?
@sloucherzine Ha. The more the merrier. I'd be happy to give a copy of those tracks to all of your readers.
@sloucherzine Ha. Thanks for talking about it on your fancy website. I'll throw a shout-out for you guys tomorrow.
'crimson and clover' is on the radio while I'm stuck in traffic. I feel claustrophobic.

@audioalt I have no idea what that word means, but it's probably safe to assume that I hate it.
@audioalt I think my problems are much deeper than that. Women aren't the only thing I hate.
@taperjean_girl8 That's true. That's true. I will beat the living crap out of everyone who crosses me.
@taperjean_girl8 No need to feel bad. It was a random.
@audioalt Should I draw it back to my baseline by making some comment about the inferiority of women?

I just held a human brain with my bare hands. Seriously.
@derekwadle Check your direct messages.
When this class is over, I'm going to the clinic to be tested for tuberculosis. There's an annoying chic perpetually coughing next to me.
@derekwadle Which tune are you talking about?
@SnoozanK my hands are always doing dirty things. No big deal.
I woke up with a mystery bruise on my hand today. People must have been torturing me during the night and I barely noticed. Manly.
@RuthsArtsLab just for the record, if you die from taco johns, I did my best to save you.
@RuthsArtsLab Thanks. Now my stomach hurts again.
Yes. I just ate 2 spoon-fulls of Cool Whip. Get off my back mom.
@americannovel You hate yourself, don't you?
@funkomatic @beezyfosho I'm pretty sure that I just shaved an entire year off of my life by eating one meal at Taco Johns.
Wow. Why do people eat at taco johns?

Urinating on my hands would have been more sanitary than touching any surface in that bathroom.
@RissieCup ok then. I was worried that you were being mean to me. I started to cry.
@iScream4Indie thank you
@RissieCup Hey... were you saying that we can play there because we're a crappy band?
@funkomatic loved your Article. Now I hate baseball even more.
@yowench you're probably right. Reverbnation actually set the price at 3 bucks. How's that??
@RissieCup well we'd be happy to play Pittsburg if your fair city will have us.
I think it's time for you ears to be filled with priceless music:	http://www.reverbnation.com/parachutesfail

I just checked out a flat chested girl in dreadlocks. Does this mean I'm gay?
The sun is going down and today has been incredibly cloudy, yet a dude on the bus thinks he needs his sun glasses. Smart.
@RissieCup oops. I accidentally cut him before I asked him. Now he's not going to be able to answer any questions. Ever.
@xoMusicLoverxo why didn't you plan for that?
@RissieCup I know. So sad. How am I supposed to check status updates to see who's leaving their house so I can rob them?
The bus smells more like body odor than usual today, and there's a dude in a Facebook sweatshirt.
@xoMusicLoverxo Well, tt's not my fault that you didn't plan this trip better.
@xoMusicLoverxo Unacceptable.
@xoMusicLoverxo 9:15?
@xoMusicLoverxo Ok. Well get on a bus. It's showing tonight at 7.

@blainecapatch You just earned yourself a new follower.
@VeronaRed Yeah. That's why I spend 90% of my time at college.
College is for idiots.
@saegs There are a few places that have them, but they're usually way overpriced. I'm sure I'll end up shelling out the cash eventually.
@saegs I've been back a few times. Do they have something new I should know about?
@VeronaRed Wha? That doesn't sound like a dojo. It sounds like a Denny's
@josiahkosier I'm going to murder you.
@VeronaRed Do you have any throwing stars of your own or should I bring a set from the dojo that I own and operate?
@VeronaRed Since you challenged me, I will choose the weapons. I choose throwing stars.
@MobbyG I need to make hit music on it.
@VeronaRed What? I'll throw in a hot wheels carrying case and an original batman action figure.
@stewie81 I owned two and goodwill got both of them. Now I wish I could sue goodwill.
@MobbyG Yeah. I keep almost buying one on ebay. They're getting more and more scarce though.
@americannovel You can't make music with a Neo Geo. Plus they're stupid. The games were like 100 bucks in the 80s!
@yowench It is for my music. I would prefer that it works.
@josiahkosier I thought you deleted your Twitter account. Dick. Thanks for telling me that you're back.
@americannovel Yes. I need to expand my hardware collection.
@justplainpaul That's a good price. From now on, I will outbid you on all of them.
Anyone who gives me a Commodore 64 gets free music for life.
@justplainpaul Do you have one? I need one.
Someone needs to give me a Commodore 64. Seriously.
Are we friends on Facebook yet? http://tinyurl.com/b37ce3
@saegs I only try to push my beliefs on you when you're wrong about something.
@xoMusicLoverxo Dude. It's true.
Vegetarian chili dogs taste exactly like regular chili dogs. Remember that.
@novah Right. I would always rather take a million tiny tests than one giant test.
@novah The quizzes are short. So, he teaches afterward. They're review quizzes (covering last semester's material).
@novah I have a quiz every day after that for 2 weeks.
@ctrygstad It's a review quiz for classical Greek. I'm not worried about it. I just like to complain.
Awesome. I have a quiz on the second day of class. This semester is going to be awesome.
I'll be in jail by 4pm today.
@yowench We definitely need fewer moons.
Classes start back up today. Gross.
Yet another evening of tracking and editing. I hope you all like songs with 8 guitar tracks playing simultaneously.
These guitar tracks aren't going to edit themselves.
@americannovel What did I help with again?
Every time I don't log onto twitter for a few days, I feel guilty. Perhaps I think that people can't live a proper life without me.
@yowench Well the LP was never supposed to come out soon. In fact we're trying to push up the date by a year or so.
Last all-nighter for a few weeks. Hopefully.
@yowench LPs take many, many moons to create. Do you have the new tunes to tide you over?
@yowench Which rumor?
@Geologist62 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1qJyUj2x8
@Geologist62 I am a singer. We've got an LP coming out soon as well. This is just to tide everyone over until the new release.
@ohlizzi I don't think I would want to smell like a funnel cake either. You?
@Geologist62 If you DM your email address to me, I will send you a copy of our latest EP. Debates put me in a generous mood.
Today Ryan is training for a marathon. I'm planning to sit at home and shovel ice cream into my mouth while... http://fb.me/sv8KyQKT
@americannovel Shut it. There are vegetarian corn dogs, and they taste almost exactly the same. Corn dogs aren't known for high quality meat
@ohlizzi No way. Fried foods are almost never the best thing to smell like.
@chelsV Yay!

@leech2999 DM your email address to me and I will email you a copy of our EP!
I just walked by a dude that smelled like corn dogs.
@josiahkosier It's true though. It's true.
@Geologist62 Ha. The only other person who thinks I'm interesting is my mom.
I'm at a coffee shop listen to high schoolers give each other relationship advice. Future generations are screwed.
@Geologist62 Agreed. Though, doesn't the fact that he finds genuine happiness in the thing he was avoiding seem to communicate to a mistake?
@Geologist62 Of course we're both entitled to our own opinions. I guess I just have a hard time reading pessimism into Dr Seuss's work.
@Geologist62 Are we reading the same book? The overall purpose of that book is to teach children to try new things.
@Geologist62 Green Eggs reads as a suggestion for open-mindedness. Also, in the end, he admits that green eggs and ham are desirable.
@Geologist62 Xenophobia has nothing to do with Obama or healthcare.
@Geologist62 Really? Because people are stubborn? Or because we eat food that might be considered gross looking?
Xenophobic America might need to reread Dr Seuss's "The Sneetches."

@saegs You're a dick.
I'm eating pizza when I get home. Count on it.
@sedruola Sorry. I think you got a knee jerk reaction to the insane amount of twitter-ads I've been getting lately. My apologies.
@petsweekly Me too. Now I just need to find someone to make sad.
@petsweekly No no. I'm taking tons of medicine now.
All right. My Bronchitis seems to be clearing up and I've returned to my angry, sarcastic self. Who wants to fight?
@xoMusicLoverxo I actually dig most spiders. This one, however, was terrifying.
@RandomDeHart Yeah. They've been saying that for a couple of years now. Though, Reubens has been doing Pee Wee on Broadway recently.
@sedruola I find that you and I should not be talking. You are an idiot and I don't like idiots.
I'm 99% sure that I just saw a Black Widow spider by the train tracks near my house. I'm going to need a flamethrower.
Weird. I kinda wish I was watching Pee Wee's Playhouse right now.
@sedruola Yeah. For some reason Twitter users used to talk about strange things that no one else seemed to know about. Not anymore.
@workmn Yeah. They used to be. There was always something strange that only Twitter users were talking about.
It it just me or have the trending topics become far less interesting?
@NewDrakeVideos You stay away from me. You're an idiot.
Canned pasta and tortilla chips for dinner... at midnight... while nursing an upper respiratory infection. Shut up, mom.
@xoMusicLoverxo Ha. I have Bronchitis. My mood hasn't been very weird/crazy lately. I'll do better. I promise.
Important practice tonight. We discussed the ethical implications of creating a robot that is self-aware.
@BellwoodOaks I'm been coughing since May. That's probably bad right?
@americannovel I don't hang out with people recently back from Nebraska. I'm sure you understand.
Is today the day that I cough myself to death?
I was typing a hilarious joke into twitter when I sneezed green phlegm all over my keyboard. Now I will start my computer on fire.
The doctor says I have an upper respiratory infection. He figured it out after I coughed in his face.
@RandomDeHart There is no possible way that you could beat me in Mario Kart.
Write this down: I possess an incredible talent in the game of Mario Kart.
Last day in Florida. I'm extremely sick and there's a thunderstorm. Awesome.
@RandomDeHart Smart. If Mickey is a witch, it stands to reason that he'd marry a witch.
@JamieMGremmels Oh yeah. That's also a good way.
Next time I see a person dressed in a Mickey Mouse outfit, I'm starting them on fire. It's the only way to find out if he's a witch.

Yeah. I'm eating Spaghetti O's and energy drink at 2 am. Get off my back, mom.
Pulling an all-nighter. Why did I decide to take summer school courses?
@internatonal00 Dude. You're an idiot and your website is retarded.
@americannovel It was great! At one point...  Hey! You tricked me!
@suzee_Q Good idea right? I'll draft a business plan. You find the investors. Lets get this baby off the ground.
@noisy_bishop_jr I've been a vegetarian for 3 years. Good times.
@noisy_bishop_jr I like it. You could become a sweet vegetarian at the same time.
@leech2999 Soda. Now we're talking.
@suzee_Q How awesome would it be to see people spraying cans of whipped cream into their mouths every morning?
@suzee_Q If someone made caffeinated whipped cream, would you eat that instead?
@noisy_bishop_jr  Uh oh. Time for you to change your religion.
@funkomatic Don't get me started on milk. Possibly the most disgusting and unnecessary thing that you can put into your adult body.
@levdir No way. All coffee is essentially the same. Hot, Dirty bean-water.
@noisy_bishop_jr What's in the bible? Coffee drinking?
@leech2999 Tea is disgusting as well. I'd rather grind up beans than hedges.
Someone needs to explain to me why they drink coffee without using the word "Caffeine." Drinking hot, dirty bean-water... so gross.
Today will be awful. I can feel it.
Laid down guitars for a couple of the tracks on our upcoming record. Now I will eat ice cream.
@girlnamednadine Well, glad to see that you made it out of hibernation.
@RandomDeHart I suppose.
I hate it when people think that I'm the one who made that smell in the bathroom... even when I did it.
@pol_organizing Ahh. I'm with you now. Yeah. I'd probably like The Arctic less than Minnesota (Even in allergy season).
@pol_organizing What's left of what? My friends list?
@girlnamednadine Whoa! Where have you been? I haven't talked to you in ages.
@kittyhasclaws Unfortunately, probably not. Though, I know my own head would explode (from a self inflicted gun shot wound).
Anyone who genuinely enjoys the Twilight series, please remove me from your friends list. We're not friends.
My allergies are trying to kill me this year. I need to move to the Arctic.
Remember when breakdancing was cool? Me either.
Just demo'd a new tune. Good times.
@metagaming @fatelions Oh man. This movie was terrible.
I'm watching a movie called "Giant Shark Vs. Mega Octopus." Best movie in history.
After one and a half weeks in the class, I now know everything about abnormal psychology. Where's my Phd?
@Fake_Rockstar Right. You're not a douche. I wouldn't want to smack you in public.
@Fake_Rockstar Well, that sentiment might go for all white people, everywhere.
@medallionfinder Indeed it does.
@jeffreywarner Gray.
@Fake_Rockstar Ha. I should move to Harlem. But it'd be less socially acceptable for me to hate a race that I'm not apart of.
@TrishBadger White people are annoying. Is that enough of an explanation?
Wow. I hate white people.
@xoMusicLoverxo Well thank you very much. I'm putting two more up tonight.
The music player is finally working. Check out the new tunes! http://fb.me/AimOeuMa
@xoMusicLoverxo Where do you work, again?
@funkomatic Oh, you're right. I may have jumped the gun a bit.
@xoMusicLoverxo Can you make a case for your intelligence?
@xoMusicLoverxo I don't mean to offend. I'm not quite sure if it applies to you, but it applies to most people.
Everyone is stupid except for me.
@funkomatic Well, I can't complain. I just always want more.
@AarontWhite Did you even read the Rolling Stone article? It wasn't criticism, man. It was ridicule. Pretty unacceptable in the military.
Holy balls it's hot outside. This weather would be more bearable if more women in bikinis were following me around.
Is the world cup still going on? So boring.
There are like 6 children crying in my neighborhood. If I look out the window, do I have to help or can I just laugh harder?
@xoMusicLoverxo The handshake committee.
@RandomDeHart Those are not off limits at all.
The weather is shaping up to be pretty terrifying. I can't wait for the 10 block long walk to my car.
@xoMusicLoverxo Don't pretend! We need to get this on the president's table by 8 am.
@RandomDeHart Slap bet? is that like the opposite of a high five? Like "I get to slap you if you lose this bet"?
@xoMusicLoverxo Yes of course. We have to send these sketches through all of the right channels in order to make this thing official.
@xoMusicLoverxo Send over your handshake sketches and I'll compare them against my own.
@xoMusicLoverxo Maybe we could implement a secret handshake of sorts.
@d4rkf3n1x You might want to stop her. It may just be a matter of time before she's dragging you to football games and frat houses.
@d4rkf3n1x It could also be that high-fives cause you to become a meathead.
@xoMusicLoverxo No no. We will find a more civil way to celebrate whatever would normally call for a high-five.
@xoMusicLoverxo Too many meatheads are always giving and asking for high fives. I'm just removing myself from that culture.
@d4rkf3n1x No way. High Fives tend to put you in a class of people whom I would rather not be associated with. Read: meatheads.
From now on, I'm boycotting high fives.
I just had an very long conversation with @benredmond about all the ways that he's wrong.
@xoMusicLoverxo I'm far too busy and important for that.
Seriously. If someone doesn't make me a fresh strawberry pie very soon, this shit is gonna get real.
@iScream4Indie Why thank you very much, kind sir.
@Bkeller49 You are a smart, smart man.

@Bkeller49 Good plan.
@xoMusicLoverxo Probably.
Everyone I know needs psychotherapy.
@derekwadle That's too bad. If you would learn to avoid them, your self esteem would probably go up a bit.
@derekwadle Unless they are real (which they are). Then you have evidently already lost. Booya.
@derekwadle Also, is it really a good idea to start a war of words with someone who is so obviously your intellectual superior?
@derekwadle I write them all. Also, screw you in the face with a hammer drill.
I just walked a million blocks in the rain to a classroom that's 200 degrees.
@giuliaz1 They're doing well. How's the station?
@Bkeller49 Yeah dude. That was a sad situation. Though, it seemed to work fine.
@giuliaz1 you're right. It has been too long. How's the fam?
@Bkeller49 That's funny. We had a good time.
@Bkeller49 well thank you very much Mr Keller.
Had fun tonight at The 808. Too bad my pants had to stay on. http://bit.ly/9ZwEXf
Good times at The 808 today. I think I may need a shower though. It's hot in here.
In 60 minutes I will be playing my introspective songs wearing no pants and a cutoff t-shirt.
If you love us, you'll be listening to us play our songs at The 808 in one hour.
@xoMusicLoverxo Dude. The cricket was in the wall. I literally pulled the trim off the door to try and track it down, but never found it.
@xoMusicLoverxo Why is that weird? crickets are annoying.
A friend of mine is a massage therapist. I just watched him put his hands on several unappealing clients. I'm glad that I'm not him.
@RuthsArtsLab I'm always glad when I find people who understand that Springsteen is not the rock-god that he thinks he is.
@giuliaz1 Did I ring?
@xoMusicLoverxo You're the weird one.
@xoMusicLoverxo agree to disagree.
@Fake_Rockstar I saw him on Storytellers once and now I can't bear to listen to anything that comes from his face.
@Fake_Rockstar What? Really?
Every time Bruce Springsteen starts to sing, I want to throw grenades into his mouth.
@xoMusicLoverxo Sometimes you need to burn down your house.
@xoMusicLoverxo Did you check out the new tunes?
@xoMusicLoverxo What didn't I do? Burn my house down to kill a cricket? How do you know? Different house, different cricket.
Zeus is angry again.
There's a god damn cricket in my house. I can't find it. I'm thinking about burning my house to the ground.
@RuthsArtsLab Thanks! You're the best.
It's Ryan's Birthday today. Everyone wish him a happy birthday by listening to the new tunes. http://www.myspace.com/parachutesfail
@gort999 Really?
@tcstiger You're very welcome.
Ryan and I are honoring the anniversary of Alcoholic's Anonymous by drinking whiskey and vodka.
Apparently the Facebook player is still screwed up. Head over to MySpace to check out the new tunes. http://bit.ly/bcvWNs
Dinner tonight contained 3 different kinds of beans. Tonight's practice will be difficult for Ryan.
Someone needs to get me a cookie.
@lunaguy4 Is there a timeclock in the bathroom?
@KaraokePhil You got it man. I'm planning to throw them on the rest of the sites tonight.
Just ate a large amount of Chinese food. Now I need to find a bathroom.
Two brand spanking new tunes over on MySpace. Check out "Godspeed Spaceman" and "March." http://tinyurl.com/c2uv98
@RuthsArtsLab Done and done.
@chrispetterson As soon as possible.
Have you checked out the new tunes?. Check out "Godspeed Spaceman" and "March." http://tinyurl.com/c2uv98

The people at the zoo taught the polar bears to do tricks. Seems risky to me.
@TheHussman It was a wicked house party.
just played a show on the roof of a 7 story building.
@JakeRadke You have no idea, man. I had a dude follow me all over the cities one time.
Today I'm working an actual job. Lame.
@benredmond The truth is only dangerous for the people who avoid it. Write that down. Its deep.
@benredmond That joke gets a -7 for originality. Hopefully you'll be able to make up those points in the second round.
This vacation needs needs more actual vacationing.
Holy balls. My dog smells terrible.

Is there a career that lets me nap all day and play video games? What kind of education would I need for that type of work?
I just found a gigantic terrifying ant on my arm. Now I have to change my pants.
@RandomDeHart Wait. What should I tell her about?
Off to the gym for my daily regiment of deep squats and pelvic thrusts.
@RandomDeHart Yeah. It didn't bother me this time. It was good to realize that the tune didn't need another part.
Just talked on the phone for 4 straight hours - beginning at 2:00 am. I have officially become a 16 year old girl.
@LoveViaRissa It's actually good when things like this happen. It means we've discovered what's not going to work.
@LoveViaRissa sad eh?
just spent two hours recording a part that we decided to scrap immediately after completing it. http://bit.ly/a9N2NW
Ryan and I just spent two hours recording a part that we decided to scrap immediately after completing it.
I can't be trusted with my own free time. Video games are too damn enjoyable.
just had to use a pair of tweezers to pull a sliver out from under my fingernail. Now I'm sad.
Someone needs to make me an Xbox 360 laptop. I want to be able to play Halo on an Airplane.
@Charlie_Boyyy You can barely speak your native language. Clear enough?
@Charlie_Boyyy Someone needs to hit the English books a little harder.
2:00 PM on a Tuesday? Time for another vodka. Summer vacation is priceless.
@americannovel These last few weeks have tried to suck all the life/sarcasm out of me, but I bested them.
@americannovel I'm going to sign up for surgeries that you do need. Like a breast reduction.
@americannovel Nope. To all of those things.
First day of summer vacation: I slept until noon and over ate. This summer is shaping up nicely.
@xoMusicLoverxo School is stupid.
I haven't been on twitter for 4 days? No wonder I was starting to feel like my life had no meaning.
@Birk0111 Doors are at 8 and we're on second. I assume that'll be around 9.
Dear Mothers. Your kid is most likely a screw up and the world would have been better off never having known them. Happy Mothers day.

@trevorikrath Yeah. I gave up shortly after I sent that last tweet.
I'm currently at 3,741 tweets. Who wants to see me 4,000 before 10pm?
My dog just farted. It sounded like a broken slushy machine. Now I'm sad.
Anyone who purchases a pre-sale ticket for our show on May 15th will get 4 free MP3's from our upcoming release.
@chelsV Ok. Sounds good. This is going to be a good class.
@YunhoJang Ok. Well hurry up. Class sign-ups are in two weeks.
@levdir Well maybe if you allowed vodka, you'd get a bit more recognition.
@YunhoJang Pretty good right? You wanna sign up for my class?
When I'm a famous teacher, students will be allowed to bring vodka to my class.
@girlnamednadine Good call. You may be on to something.
My living room smells like feet or Mexican food. I can't tell which.
@susandyoung Yeah. We had a funeral for the poor little guy. Actually the funeral was just a way to draw out the other spiders.
@RandomDeHart @susandyoung It was just some tiny black spider. He's no longer with us.
@JamieMGremmels It may have been a black widow, but scientists often use my blood as anti-venom. So I should be fine.
I just got bit by a spider.

Everyone in this classroom has apparently contracted whooping cough.
Everyone on this campus is basically begging me to punch them in their collective mouths.

Anyone who shows up to our concert tomorrow will receive 4 brand new Parachutes Fail songs in their email (free!)
I'm planning to sneak vodka into every class next week. School will be bearable next week.
@americannovel I guess I don't know for a fact that it was a flash mob, but it was like 30 people dancing for no reason. So...
I'm thinking about wearing a cutoff t-shirt at Thursday's show. Who wants to see a happy face shaved into my stomach?
@yowench I can't do that in public. I don't want to go to jail.
Just ran through the shittiest flash mob in history while trying to catch a bus.
These all-nighters would be a whole lot easier if I were addicted to cocaine.
@Lauren_Sparkles Because if I didn't, who would I make fun of?
@JakeThatRump Yeah. Me too.

This message is for everyone who loves to tweet inspirational quotes and self-important words of advice: you're fat.

Someone just unfriended me because I don't believe in acupressure. It's probably better this way.
True story: Ryan fell face first into some itch weed today. I wish I could explain how funny that is to me.
@RandomDeHart Really? Are you sure?
@Erinsartjournal @lhein Good to hear. Baby punching is the wave of the future.
How young is too young to punch someone in the face? I had plans to punch a one year old yesterday. Is that bad?
@iScream4Indie No no. The kisses will not be chocolate, but they will be delicious.

@americannovel Easy now. Insulting me on the internet is like challenging Micheal Jordan to a game of 21.
Today is Earth Day and it's not even trending on Twitter? I hope your children enjoy... not being born.
@americannovel Does that make sense?
@americannovel I should read the messages that I send before actually sending them. People are probably starting to think I'm retarded.
@americannovel No. You have to tinyurl.com and enter the URL that you want to make short. Then just copy the newly shortened and presto.
@amineoq37v That sounds less cool. Am I wrong?
@americannovel You take long domains and make them short (they're just forwarded). It makes them useful for twitter (under 140 characters).
I will be napping underneath my desk if anyone needs me.
I wish my last name was Bacon.
@UBLF It looked to be silk. Luxurious.
@americannovel You are boring. Next question.
@RockArtists You always retweet the strangest of all my tweets. Awesome.
Dear Diary. A man in a lavender suit sat next to me on the bus. I think you can guess the rest.
@iScream4Indie dude. You're my hero.
@TheHussman Yeah. I may want to retract my invitation...

I just burned my tongue on macaroni and cheese. I'm too irresponsible to eat even the most childish of foods.
@yowench Whoa, whoa. Your language is inappropriate in this forum.
@TheHussman Dude. It is time for you to make a road trip up to MN and see us play. We can talk about how funny we are on Twitter.
Body odor and urine are the most frequent passengers on any bus.
@TheHussman if it wasn't, I'll be firing up the time machine to make it so.
@yowench I though we weren't allowed to say his name. How about this; we can say it, but only as an inslut.
The two most awkward people on the planet are having a conversation behind me. Priceless.
A bald headed man is delivering the mail and this campus smells of lilac and sewer.

@trygveo I would have never gifted a Hall and Oates mix tape, no matter how drunk I got. I'm not retarded.
It makes me laugh that an AP Stylebook update is trending. Twitter users barely speak English. Nice try everyone, but I'm on to you.
@trygveo I haven't given you anything. Have I? Was I too drunk to remember?
@trygveo You're too kind.
@Bluesok So what are these riddles exactly?
@ariherstand Amazing. Some people need to read a book before they attempt to have an opinion.
I haven't slept since Wednesday night. My brain don't work no more.
@nickjinmybed Yes. Oh.
@Bluesok I want to know everything that you know.
@ariherstand Did someone actually say that?
@americannovel Don't question it. My marketing skills are off the hook.
@JamieMGremmels Damn straight.
@Bluesok This sounds complicated. Are you going to explain it to me so I don't have to visit wikipedia?
@nickjinmybed I'm just saying. Your Tweets are a cry for help.
Ryan is on his way over. I've been seeing far too much of this guy.
@nickjinmybed Dude. You might have clinical neuroticism.
@Bluesok Wha? Should I have heard of the other 10?
@Bluesok Good. Being sad is the inspiration for every single song I've ever written. Now it's your turn to write songs!
@americannovel You should probably tell your followers about your pantsless drummer.
@cplpokerpodcast I only tweet from the bathroom. I spend a lot of time in there.
@americannovel Don't apologize. You're not actually sorry.
I haven't slept yet. Stupid @americannovel.
These overnighters are starting to get real old.
@Lauren_Sparkles No problem. I'm a gentleman.
@americannovel Your compliments are welcome - however undeserved they may be. Your set was suburb and sublime... and other S words.
@Lauren_Sparkles I will allow it.
Also, I should mention that this place smells like a toilet.
Just finished our set. Now we're checking the musical stylings of @americannovel. This place is packed!
@yowench Wait. I'm not sure what that means, but I say we turn it into the worst insult ever.
@Lauren_Sparkles I like it when girls smell nice. Just not like rotting flowers.
@Bluesok name calling! You're a terrible person.
@xoMusicLoverxo Me either. Which is why I'm going to revolutionize the political system.
@Lauren_Sparkles My stink is quite pleasant. I have indoor plumbing, so I shower every day. Unlike you perfume wearers.
@xoMusicLoverxo Seriously. Name some reasons that you would vote for a candidate, and I'll tell you why my ideas are better.
@Lauren_Sparkles You live on the other side of the planet! Plus, I already know that you stink. It goes hand in hand with perfume use.
@Lauren_Sparkles I don't know. I think people might be too afraid to tell you that you stink.
@xoMusicLoverxo My nation would be the greatest in history. The United States of Awesome.
@Lauren_Sparkles TAKE A SHOWER!
Can we as a society agree that perfume is an antiquated way for women to disguise their stench? Take a shower. You have indoor plumbing.
@americannovel I only recognize Terminators 1 and 2 (and I barely recognize 1). The rest are enjoyed only by dinks.
@americannovel You think my cell phone can sense that I'm angry? Are you sure that you're not retarded?
@americannovel Whoever told you that your opinion was valuable played a cruel prank on everyone you know.
Hey T-Mobile. Maybe you should think about making a phone that isn't super shitty. Thanks.
@chelsV Done. I know that I'll be going shirtless on the campaign trail.
@funkomatic Very good.
Hot girls should be required to wear sun dresses on sunny days. When I run for president, that's my platform.

@xoMusicLoverxo A cake? Bad idea. Cake/concert night on the 15th. Be there.

@HeatherStarr Wanna bet?
Who wants to watch me get into a Twitter altercation with @justinbieber?
@trygveo I am. You should come to my show. We can thumb wrestle.
@FionaWeber That thing is pretty cool. Though, it's pointing at the wrong location.
Playing a show tomorrow at The Red Sea in Minneapolis. I will personally thumb wrestle everyone who shows up.
@yowench Exactly.
Screw you Tuesday.
@AmplicateInfo Are you trying to prove to me that the American public is largely made up of complete morons? Cause I already knew that.
@americannovel Anger makes bones grow stronger. It's like milk or those pills that old people take.
@xoMusicLoverxo This time machine will only be used for good... except if I'm using it. Then it will be used for chics.
@benredmond No that wasn't me, it was just Carrot Top. That dude is beefy.
@trygveo You're confusing wheelhouse with roundhouse. Goddamnit! You sucked me in.
@trygveo Chuck Norris doesn't have a choice. 2005 was the Chuck-Norris-joke wheelhouse.
Write this down: If you tweet using the hashtag "#MaybeImTrippinBut" you're too dumb to live (unless you're me).
Really? Chuck Norris jokes? Did I fall asleep in my time machine and wake up in 2005?
@americannovel Duh. Those authors nailed it. Pandas are dicks. That's science.
@americannovel I was just reading that book! Pandas deserve an F. They're dicks.
Damn it. I thought we were going to keep Justin Bieber out of the trending topics this week. You people disgust me.
@trygveo That's probably true.
@reubenperez Probably good. Don't stop being creepy if it's what you're good at.
@trygveo Does it work?
@xoMusicLoverxo I changed my mind actually. Fox has gross hands.
@americannovel Oh yeah. I forgot about that. She's got a freakish toe-thumb. I'm changing my vote to Jessica Alba.
@benredmond No. No. Kelly's hands are smooth and precise. Regis has the strength. That's why they make such a good back-rubbing duo.
@benredmond Well crap. Though, I've heard he has very strong hands.
@trygveo Every night I pray for Justin Bieber to burst into flames.
@reubenperez That's actually true. You are creepy.
@trygveo This back peddling of yours is starting to sound a bit unattractive. Justin Bieber is going to love you less.
@trygveo We're fighting about your love for Justin Bieber. I find it to be weird and creepy.
Someone needs to give me a back rub. I choose Megan Fox.
@trygveo Well I've got testosterone on my side.
@girlnamednadine Well aren't you kind. You will receive free music for your kindness.
@trygveo I think you and I might be fighting now.
@JamieMGremmels Awesome. My plan is working.
All right everybody, it's a brand new week. Let's try and keep Justin Bieber out of the top trends this week.
@chrispetterson It's starting to sound like you don't love me like you used to.
@americannovel You were bestowed the honor of my first re-retweet.
@chrispetterson And sleeves.
@chrispetterson Listen. I'm no whore. I want a real outfit - for us to be seen in public together.
@chrispetterson Well you owe me new outfit, then.
@chrispetterson What? That time was your fault. You put too much pressure on me to perform. It shouldn't count.
@chrispetterson You got it dude.
Just listened to a couple of mixed tracks from the upcoming release. Things are starting to come together.
@yowench Has anyone ever told you that you're brilliant?
@HeatherStarr Ha. But can we agree that Twilight is essentially porno for women?
@yowench I know. People love/hate Twilight. I may make it my mission to ruin it for everyone.
@josiahkosier nope. disagree.
@NikkiAndrews Ha. A good attitude on your part.
@HeatherStarr Ha. You're right. There doesn't need to be a point. The same women just aren't allowed to be made when guys watch porno.
@JarieMame I'm sorry if the joke offends you, but it was still a joke.
@JarieMame I obviously don't think women are stupid. I think Twilight is stupid and women make up their primary audience.
@JarieMame And isn't insulting my intelligence without any actual discourse far worse than my patently obvious stab at humor?
@JarieMame Of course it was a joke. I was overstating my position (the definition of Hyperbole).
@JarieMame Of course it was a joke. Overstating my position is oviously
@JarieMame Ha. Fair enough. You sound fun to be around.
@JarieMame Do you think that I might have been using hyperbole to make a point about how much I personally despise Twilight?
@HeatherStarr How does a movie that's so vapid prove that its largely female audience is intellectually inferior to those who reject it?
@JarieMame Really? If it means that much to you, can you explain why it's valuable?
@americannovel It proves that many men have repressed homosexual feelings. Next question.
@josiahkosier But you probably shared it. That doesn't count.
The success of the Twilight series proves the inferiority of the female gender.
@thesarahwinters Damn it. Your tricks work very well. You should have made Josiah eat the entire cookie before he was allowed to leave.
@thesarahwinters Are you tricking people into following us? How'd the CD release go?
Just added a few new shows to our concert schedule. Time to clear your schedules. http://www.myspace.com/parachutesfail
@americannovel Yeah. Some people have everything delivered to their phones though. I have a personal account that's just forwarded.
@americannovel A good question. No idea. Seems like an impossible statistic to find.
@americannovel 3517. I'm the man.
@americannovel It's been a long and painful road, but we got through it together.
@americannovel Pretty much. Twitter (and other websites) add them up and you can search them with the search bar on the right.
@americannovel Its called a hash tag. It's how Twitter knows what's a popular trending topic.
@americannovel and I just hatched an elaborate scheme.
@americannovel It's risky for you to start insulting me. Very, very risky.
@Birk0111 Mid terms this week.

Second energy drink of the evening and it's only midnight. Tomorrow is going to be a long day.
@LOA_Lover The same one I have now: prostitute.
Another all night study session? Lame.
I think @americannovel might have a head injury.
@americannovel Well they could but what if they don't want everyone on earth to get their email address/phone number too?
@americannovel What if someone were to find you on Twitter and asked to be added to your email list?
@americannovel Direct messages are good. It means I can send you information without everyone on earth also getting them.
@Birk0111 Ha. Me either.
@RandomDeHart Wait. Which Tweet are we talking about?
@saegs Just kidding. We're friends again.
@saegs We're not friends. You were always calling off our friendship. So, now it's called off for good - until Saturday.
@saegs Hey! I know what you're doing. Knock it off.
@daphaknee Ohh! So clever!
Hey morons. Stop using so many ellipses. You're ruining them for the people who actually know how to use them.
@KrisColvin The iPod keyboard is perfect because the screen is so small. You can't use the iPad keyboard as a thumbpad.
@KrisColvin The list of problems is long, so I'll start with a basic one. The keyboard is unusable unless the iPad is sitting in your lap.
@KrisColvin Yes I know. It was a joke with reference to our previous messages.
@KrisColvin My beef is that it promises functionality but delivers a giant cellphone.
@KrisColvin Touch screen tablets that run Windows have been around for over ten years. Should we compare those to the iPad?
@KrisColvin The iPad is marketed as a "Tablet Computer" not "a really big cellphone that can't make calls."
@marwah_z @maritorres I'm right about most things. Soon you will come to realize this.
@KrisColvin You're comparing a tablet computer to a cellular phone? Maybe we should compare it to other computers.
@americannovel Why yes there is. Direct Messages are private. @ messages are public.
Anyone who is head-over-heels in love with the iPad isn't interested in usability. They like shiny things.
I can't get this Mumford & Sons record into my ears fast enough and the volume doesn't go high enough.

@ftlob best game in history
@ftlob They usually want to do more than that, and I'm happy to oblige.
@ftlob I have that effect on ladies.
@ftlob Ok then. Now let's talk about how much better cadbury eggs are than all other foods.
@ToyotaEquipment They obviously don't understand a lot of things.
@GregoryProject I haven't noticed a size difference. Though, they come in two varieties now: regular size and bite sized.
@ftlob Seriously? You're about to be unfollowed if you don't take that back.
@Music_Artists @ToyotaEquipment Don't you hate people who talk about how gross they are? I have a word for them: communists.
@juliacanderson Well you're never going to give Winston Churchill a run for his money, but you can't improve if you don't try.
Seriously. Whoever invented the Cadbury Creme Egg should win a Nobel Prize.
@funkomatic Yes. And skirts.
This warm weather means that the cleavage is out in full force. God bless college students.
@YunhoJang I was making hilarious joke.
@YunhoJang Do you think George Washington Carver ever mentioned Twitter during his lifetime?
@MelissaCamille Awesome. I hope they all move in to our commune.
@VeronaRed Well thank you very much. We've got more tunes on the way.
"People need to stop broadcasting famous quotes on Twitter. They make me want to unfollow you" - George Washington Carver.
I was just checking out some of my new followers profiles. I have become very popular with naked ladies. Thank you Twitter.
@ToyotaEquipment Not for me it doesn't.
Wasn't I just awake a few hours ago? Being responsible is stupid.
@juliacanderson Your lack of participation on Twitter is starting to get real annoying.
I just had a salad for the second day in a row. I can already feel my testosterone dropping.
@yowench It's exactly like that.
Reject the null.
@WebsterCooley You're an idiot. Seriously.
@jdawgc Whatever racist.
@learae Why thank you very much.
Soy sauce is the most delicious of all condiments. Anyone who doesn't agree is racist.
Forgot to charge my laptop. Looks like I'm not getting any work done today. Awesome.
@JaxonBennett well no one would argue with you there.
@JaxonBennett Also, I thought There Will Be Blood had a really great pacing. However, I probably wouldn't watch it twice.
@JaxonBennett It wasn't directed at you, but it was partially inspired by you (but mostly by several down-syndrome stricken movie critics)
@JaxonBennett Wha? You're stupid.
I just got a really terrible haircut from a really hot chic. Yes I will be going back.
@SLIMMCALHOUN Why thank you very much. I will reward your faithfulness with smooth music.
@im_not_agirl Well thank you very much. Your kindness will be rewarded with smooth music.
I just made myself salad. I feel like a liar.
@yowench Are you going to join our naked commune or what?
@MelissaCamille Awesome. You can be mayor.
Who wants to drop out of school and start a commune with me? Clothes will be optional.
Is it Friday yet?
@JamieMGremmels Well, very few movies have enough boobies in them. That's why god invented the internet.
Stupid people often complain about movies being "too slow." They may as well just say "There weren't enough explosions."
@yowench Yes of course. That'd be fine.
@RandomDeHart It is nothing like "I've got a Feeling." Because then I would be the Black Eyed Peas, and no one wants that.
@girlnamednadine If you guess the secret, I will tell you.
@yowench It is. Don't tell anyone!
I know a secret.
Anyone who questions my Tetris mastery needs to look at my garage right now.
@RandomDeHart You're the only person.
@ColoradoFilm Again, you're the best.
@trygveo Why thank you. You're kindness will be rewarded with smooth music.
About the spend the next 6 hours reading psychology journals. I wish I could major in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.
@TheHussman @Bkeller49 @jillylivi @trygveo Thank you very much. You are all very kind. Possibly too kind.
I just sneezed in a library and no one blessed me. Studious people are dicks.
@RandomDeHart Ha. No, no. It's a real school. One of our profs was actually on that episode of Donahue as an expert.
Shut your mouth, Thursday.
@RandomDeHart the University of MN.
We just watched a episode of Donahue in one of my Psychology classes. I'm starting to think that this might not be a real school.
@benredmond Hey. You made sound fat and lonely. You're mean.
@TheHussman Wait. Which tweet needs to be a lyric? The fat kid/hacky-sack lyric?
@RockArtists Well thank you very much. It's up to you about where to retweet. You're the smart one.
@RockArtists Wait... Now I'm not sure if you're a bot or not. Would a bot have a witty reply like that?
@RockArtists You retweet almost everything I say. That makes you smart.
@chrispetterson I don't know. I'd rather have a pizza.
There's a fat kid playing hacky-sack by himself under the streetlight in my culdesac.
Cold cereal for dinner is pretty unsatisfying.
@squee42 Well thank you very much. We're releasing new tracks in the next couple of weeks. I'll send you copies as soon as we have them!
@claudia10024 Seriously? Something is wrong with him because he said a word?
I just reached an adulthood milestone; instead of eating Doritos with my spaghetti O's, I made peas.
@zuppup1 That probably is covered!
This health care bill would be a lot less controversial if it provided breast enhancements for all small chested women.
I'm watching a dude try to fit an entire apple into his mouth. Here's hoping he chokes on it.
@josiahkosier Ok cool. I'll get it all together and give you a call. How'd your other project turn out?
@josiahkosier What really? Awesome. I'll get them to you this week.
Being an adult is stupid.
I'm heading over to @americannovel 's house so we can rip on each other's music. Should be fun.
@RandomDeHart Agreed. Agreed.
Hey Texas, thanks for inflicting your lack of education on the rest of America.
@JamieMGremmels Crap. Did I miss a Justin Bieber fiasco?
@tehghettosmurf Risky.
@tehghettosmurf Ohh. I see my mistake. I made a minor typo, but you just made an enemy. Which is worse?
@nonfinite Got it. To be fair, anyone who defends that horse face isn't a friend in the first place. Burning that bridge is justified.
@mybreathaway Orphans certainly don't deserve to die, but harsh social consequences need to be implemented.
@tehghettosmurf How could it mean anything but killing an orphan?
@JakeRump It's the right way to feel.
From now on, every time Justin Bieber is trending, I murder and orphan.
Spring Break Day 4: My nipples haven't seen this much daylight in years.
@tehghettosmurf Woah! It's always exciting when you tweet.
@nonfinite Wait. What are we talking about again?
@thesciphishow Well I guess I'm not going into computer sales.
Apparently they're making a second "Sex in the City" movie. People really want to look at that horse-face for 2 straight hours? Tragic.
@berrytc44 Yeah. Those guys are a bunch of fibbers.
@thesciphishow You have an XP box? That seems a bit risky these days. We need to get you a WIN7 machine.
@berrytc44 All computers crash when you push them. Mac fanatics seem to think that their computers run on fairy dust and unicorn horns.
@thesciphishow Well I'm glad Apple included that convenient feature. Also, You're mean.
@JakeRump Don't worry. I'm sure I'll tweet about them. I like when people tell me how handsome I am.
@Birk0111 Vista was a terrible tragedy for Microsoft.
@JakeRump That's true. We have many new vids in the works.
The next person to say "Macs just work" is going to get jacked in the face with my constantly crashing Macbook Pro.
@TheHussman Whats what I have been doing. It doesn't seem to be working.
@JakeRump Well thank you very much.
The Spring Breaks on MTV look like more fun than the one I'm having in my living room.
Spring Break Day 2: Once again stayed up all night editing songs. Then I woke up this morning and ate burritos for breakfast. Priceless.
@americannovel I hadn't until this exact moment. Oh how I've missed you.
@giuliaz1 You know me very well.
Spring Break Day One: Foolishly stayed up until 6am trying to record sounds from my gameboy. I can't be trusted with my own free time
@Birk0111 Suits and ties? I barely wear pants.
Big day in today. Made huge progress on a new tune and had a high powered business meeting among band members.
@JakeRump You're constantly retweeting my hilarious remarks. That makes you and I internet-best-friends.
I'm working on a new theory: No one with an IQ above 50 enjoys Twilight.
Spring Break starts today. This means that I'll actually be able to work on some new tracks. Your ears will thank me later.
@RandomDeHart Well, to be fair, no one wins with this movie. We all lose.
@beautyismyname2 Thank you very much! I will remember your kindness in my will.
@RandomDeHart There's no way that "City of Angels" is worse than "From Paris With Love." No way on earth.
@ColoradoFilm Dear Colorado film. You are very kind.
@RandomDeHart Yeah I saw it like 10 years ago. Do you think it's worse than "From Paris With Love"?
@RandomDeHart Was john Travolta in that movie?
@Zachamon My beard isn't nearly mighty enough to win a beard contest. However, a mustache would probably get me arrested.
"From Paris With Love" is the worst movie I have seen since the last John Travolta movie I watched.
I should shave my beard into one of those tiny french mustachios.
Today I woke up with "Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)" by The Offspring stuck in my head. Last night's dreams must have been pretty epic.
Crime was more photogenic in the 40's.
Spring break is next week. I will show my nipples to many, many people.
I just walked by a guy who was dressed exactly like Inspector Gadget.
@john_w_anderson If you like NCIS, there are no band aids powerful enough to protect you from yourself.
@kayjay15 Probably. Do you like NCIS?
@RandomDeHart Good. You and I are best friends.
@lindasusan I'm stealing that.
NCIS is the worst program in television history. Anyone who likes it needs their throat cut.
@xoMusicLoverxo Ok. You win. I won't delete it.
@nonfinite Dude. I just checked out your tune-age on 8bc. Good stuff.
The Tron Legacy Trailer is trending along with the new Cisco CRS-3 router? Time for me to delete my account the nerds have taken over.
For dinner I will be eating a sandwich made from bread, cheese and SpaghettiOs.
@yowench What? Why is it weird when a heterosexual guy like me wants to put his hands all over another heterosexual guy like RDJ?
@angiesterhenran No. I think that guy is probably the least delicious person possible at the moment.
Is it just me or does Robert Downey Jr. grow more delicious with every passing year?
This message goes out to all you ugly people: Please stop having children. Thanks.
@ATLguitarchica Well, I'm on board with the sundresses. Not so much the boots.
The weather is warming up in Minnesota. That means the neck beards are disappearing a being replaced by faux hawks.
@zuppup1 Damn it. I could have added him to my daily neck-beard count.
@Inherentlylazy_ I try to be, but people always start yelling at me.
@marcylauren I did say that. Was it offensive?
Women shouldn't be allowed to win Oscars. They also shouldn't be allowed to drive or vote.
Today, my car smells like lilacs and feet.
@Inherentlylazy_ "Musical Care." Ha.
Where's my woman with my food!?
Goodnight Technologist.
@WendyMcColm Today I saw a brainwave machine shock you. Brains are always up to no good.
I can turn any room into a bathroom.
Ryan has become obsessed with LARPing. Unacceptable.
@ohlizzi I'm very funny. It's a scientific fact. Thanks for the RT.
#JonasBrothersAre the reason science should bring Jeffrey Dahmer back to life.
@yowench If the Disney channel has taught us anything it's that cuteness is the most important element of a musical career.
The only reason for Justin Bieber to be trending is because he managed to die in a hilarious chain saw accident. Stop talking about him.
"National Grammar Day" is trending among Twitter users? The irony is delicious.
Just met someone who is too stupid to work at Burger King. Impressive.
@Bkeller49 Which tweet! Not which bathroom.
Today I will write one of my Tweets while using the bathroom. Will you be able to guess which one?
@xoMusicLoverxo What! You better not. I would miss you.
@americannovel I can't believe you tweeted something.
@xoMusicLoverxo Hey! where have you been!?
Guess who's eating Spaghetti O's at midnight.
The guy sitting next to me smells like pasta and hot dogs.
@TheHussman I did. But I got an evil eye from the prof. Screw that guy.
My stats professor just slurred the words "Test" and "Statistical" together. Priceless.
@Wolflow It's true.
Someone needs to make me a sandwich.
This town smells like an anus.
@RandomDeHart That is both funny an true.
@RandomDeHart Which tweet are you loling at? I post too many hilarious things to keep track.
Hey Tuesday, you're a dick.
@CSMcMahon You should give her address to me. I bet if I smash her TV, the show won't have a large enough audience to stay on the air.
Seriously? "Two and a Half Men" is trending? I wish I owned an automatic weapon. You people are too stupid to live.
@Joyfulstamper What'd I say that was funny? Sometimes I lose track.
@JamieMGremmels Also valid.
The next person to invite me to Farmville gets unfriended on Facebook and in real life.
These "Fun Sized" Snickers bars aren't nearly as fun as the full sized versions.
I accidentally grabbed my wife's keys on the way out the door this morning. She was far less angry with me than she should have been.
Luke From @Americannovel is here with his kiddo.
Band practice starts in one minute. Time for these pants to come off.
My woman made pancakes for breakfast. The lord sees her obedience to me translates it into her heavenly reward.
Tonight I will drink a bottle of Absinthe and disembowel a homeless person. God, I love Fridays.
Off to learn ancient things.
Thank you very much. RT @jillylivi "his lyrics and songs are pure poetry and he rocks."
Drinking Vodka and translating ancient Greek passages.
People need to stop referring to figure skating as "inspirational." If its so enjoyable, why is it only broadcast for 2 days every 4 years?
@TonywithaY It's never happened actually. They've attacked trainers, but never fatally. You must be smart.
@sammeem Yeah. This statistics are the worst thing in history.
Screw you statistics.
College students are far less profound than they may think.
@shameonyoko Wait. Your guitar shoots fire? That sounds even more dangerous/awesome.
@shameonyoko Dude. Your guitar doesn't shoot laser beams. Don't tell me twitter-lies.
I wish my guitar shot laser beams.
2 of my 5 midterms down. Maybe I'll get a full night of sleep tonight.
@TheHussman Wait..my tweets were never coherent in the first place.
@RandomDeHart They're very delicious, but not that delicious.
3rd all nighter in a row. I'm officially back in school.
@yowench It wasn't, but the next one will be.
Ryan just canceled Thursday practice, and I have to cancel yesterday's and last week's practice. I miss his face and hairdo.
I just ate a bowl of chili and a Cadbury Egg. Best dinner ever.
@UBLF Those look terrible.
My body runs on discount energy drinks.
I haven't cut my hair since August. Should I try to make it until next August?
@ellen_g Psychology. Gearing up for grad school.
@ellen_g I'm going a bit nuts today. What are you going to school for?
@ellen_g Thank you. You're very kind.
Apparently I'm pulling an all nighter tonight, and probably another tomorrow. Going back to school was a good idea.
I just walked into the electrical engineering building to find a robot navigating itself up a flight of stairs.
I lost the hypothesis.
@TheHussman Hot. Tell me more.
@Birk0111 He probably is a douche, but he still shouldn't be pressured into making a public apology. He didn't hurt or offend me.
@TheHussman Wait. Did you just tell me how many ladies have seen your birthday suit?
I didn't step foot outside of my house today. Depressing.
@TheHussman I suppose you might be right. But would he really own any of them an apology?
@xoMusicLoverxo Ha. Maybe.
@xoMusicLoverxo Lame. Adulthood sucks.
@xoMusicLoverxo That's what the liquor and nicotine are for!
@xoMusicLoverxo That means I have to suffer through adulthood. Lame.
@xoMusicLoverxo Well, I don't have a time machine. What do you suggest?
@xoMusicLoverxo That wouldn't make me old. That would just make me dead. I want people to take care of me, not come to my funeral.
@josiahkosier Also, you're a vagina.
@josiahkosier You're welcome. Wait, which tweet are you thanking me for?
@xoMusicLoverxo I'm skipping adulthood and heading right for old age. I'm going to need a lot liquor and nicotine to pull this off...
@seymourblue I had never even heard of this band until you asked me. Why do you ask?
There is no reason that Tiger Woods' press conference should have drawn 630,000 viewers. He doesn't owe any of them an apology.
Saturdays are stupid. Being an adult sucks.
@TheHussman She does now.
The wallpaper on my mother's computer is set to a circa 1990 picture of Harrison Ford.
@ohlizzi There's more where that came from.
My right nipple is trying to burrow its way through the front of my shirt. Hot.
@cindykcruz Thank you!
@jesseerdmann The problem is that I'm probably going to be one of the people losing it.
@jesseerdmann Also, you're probably right. I should turn in my MN ID. This place is too cold. It hurts my balls.
@jesseerdmann I can appreciate the amount of drugs it may have taken to come up with these sports (the Biathlon? Are you kidding me?)
Are the Olympics over yet? I'm not sure I can take many more days of pure boredom.
@JamieMGremmels You are wise.
@ColoradoFilm Thank you kind sir.
The spellcheck function in Microsoft Word is as incompetent as an Arkansas high school teacher.
@JamieMGremmels You are wise to retweet that. The world needs to hear the truth.
@bretbernhoft Dude. I don't need to tell you how nerdy that was. But I will. Nerd.
This paper is going to kill me. 5 hours of work for two pages? Ridiculous.
If you're a single guy and you own a cat, put a gun in your mouth. Your life isn't worth living.
I just pegged the dog from across the room with a roll of toilet paper. I thought it was awesome until he took off and shredded it. He won.
I miss that Encyclopedia Brown guy. He always knew what to do. Too bad he died of a heroine overdose.
@saegs Yes I am.
The weather in Minnesota is almost as unbearable as the people are.
@YoutPastrJeff If you dislike the J-Bros, I may have to rethink my position. My life strategy has always been to do the opposite of you
There should be a shark tank at the end of the ski jumping hill. #BetterOlympics
The Jonas Brothers need to be murdered with a hacksaw #handsdown.
Anyone who doesn't win a silver, gold or bronze medal is eaten by Rosie O Donnell #BetterOlympics
@RandomDeHart Oh. You are too kind. Besides, I'm not nearly as funny as I am handsome.
I just checked out the schedule of upcoming Olympic events and immediately fell asleep. Now I'm late for work. Screw you Olympics!
@stuckpixel Obviously someone has poked your eyes out. I'll drop a new pair off at your place tonight. I took some from a homeless guy.
@stuckpixel The OS. The functionality. The design. What's not to like? It's like an iPhone with more personality.
@yowench Anytime I can give the gift of knowledge is a good day indeed.
@yowench Well you are in for a treat.
@stuckpixel Seriously? You don't like it? I'm going to buy at least two.
I think I might love the new windows phone. I'll buy one for each ear.
@yowench If you're just looking for pictures of people wearing tight clothes, I know of a few websites that should do the trick.
@mnwildtimes Ha. You're right. You're right.
How is it that people can suddenly become interested in sports that they've ignored for two years just because the Olympics are on?
@Birk0111 I've never been one to ingest the dirty bean water.
@TheHussman @andy_meow @saegs That Tweet was a test to see who I was going to remove from my friends list.
Awesome. The Olympics start tomorrow. That should give me something to make fun of for a while.
@Birk0111 Hmm. Do they still sell dirty bean water?
Are any of you selling cocaine? I have a test that I need to study for.
Holy crap. I think Steve Jobs was just in my house. Did he post anything to my twitter account?
Studying would be more enjoyable if I had an iPad.
12 more hours of studying today? Can't wait!
I don't drink nearly often enough. I'm obviously not taking my education seriously.
#HowToBeAMan Make her take her shoes off before she can ride in the Camero.
@RBoesche No. I decided not to hurt any dogs today. Mostly because there was no money to be made from the prospect.
@zbussey I think it's pretty obvious that Eddie Murphy isn't maintaining the same level of celebrity that he had back in the 80's. So sad.
@zbussey Oh man. It's so sad that you only remember Eddie Murphy for his role in Dr Doolittle. Now I'm crying. Thanks.
@zbussey Plus Charlie Murphy doesn't make smooth acoustic music.
@zbussey Well I already know that I'm 67% funnier than Charlie Murphy.
Micheal Jackson came out of retirement/ back from the dead to record "We Are The World 25". Who does he think he is, Tupac?
@zbussey Well we're interacting now, and I would wager that I'm at least 50% funnier than the funniest person you know.
@zbussey Shut your mouth. I'm tweeting.
@john_w_anderson Seriously? You're following Jeff Bridell and Owl City, but you're not following me? Message recieved.
@nonfinite Really? Well crap.
School is making me fat. I may need to go on a diet/drop out.
@yowench a valid point
@Black_Drongo Ha. I'm kidding of course.
@benredmond I will make an enemy of whomever I choose. You're the one who should be walking on egg shells.
My dog won't stop licking his f-ing lips. I can hear him across the room. Luckily, it's not illegal to murder a dog. Is it?
I found a bag of candy in a classroom today. A lot of people thought it was poison, but I ate it anyway.
@benredmond Hey, that's not a real twitter account, and if your wife did have an account it would be @MarriedToDisappointment
@TheMonti1 Well then you'll love me.
@charliemeyerson No. Minnesota has a stupid outfit. White and cold.
@TheHussman Also, more people need to retweet the things that I say. It leads to friendship and tender, emotional connections.
@TheHussman Why thank you. That's just a demo. I'm working on the full version even as we speak.
Hey Minnesota. Screw your crappy outfits.
@TheMonti1 No problem! Are you following back? You won't be sorry. I'm very hilarious.
@TheHussman Huh. How did we find each other on Twitter? I need to know for my memoirs.
@chrispetterson Well, color me jealous.
@TheHussman Hey. Have you been to one of our shows?
@TheHussman I'm not sure I like that idea.
I wish I had a big red bow tie that spun when I got excited.
I'm a cheating spouse in the lord's house. Got my fingers crossed, but my soul is lost.
Is it too cliched to call a song "Curtain Call"? I feel like once Eminem selected it as the title for a greatest hits record...
@yowench She only had the chance to draw a line before I stopped her by breaking her nose.
@MorganGetty She only had the chance to draw a line before I stopped her by breaking her nose.
My stupid mother just wrote on my neck with black pen. She'll be apologizing for the next two weeks. Trust me.
I wish I could grow a beard just like Charlie Darwin.
@TheCoyoteDreams Ha. All right. You're not a dink.
@MinnesotaSoccer Ha. Yeah. I'm including myself as well.
Everyone in Minnesota is a dink.
@TheHussman You can check me out in a literal sense as well. Lot's of straight guys do. It's natural.
@TheHussman I figured that you were Chris (the last name gave it away). I'll take a listen to your podcast and tell you how handsome it is.
Will someone please come over to my house and knock me out with a frying pan of a giant anvil?
@TheHussman I also didn't have time to actually listen to any of them. That might have helped.
@TheHussman I was poking around your podcast's website and couldn't quite figure out what you were nerdy about.
@zulufox_1911 I can see that you are of above average intelligence.
People need to help me get this hash tag off the ground: #ifthejonasbrothersdiedIwouldntbesad
@yowench I should have more nude focus groups. Good idea.
@yowench Huh. Ok we'll do this scientifically.
@TheHussman Dude. Are you a comic book nerd?
@yowench So, if I take off my shirt every day for the next two weeks, will my MySpace inbox be filled with pedophile spam like the old days?
@xoMusicLoverxo MySpace has become a place to listen to music and be stalked by pedophiles.
@yowench What! I'm losing my touch? This is bad news.
Just logged on to my MySpace account after ignoring it for 6 months and I only had 1 page of spam in my inbox. I must be losing my touch.
@sammeem Thanks! I'm sure you'll see me on the news sooner or later.
@TheHussman I suppose I could to back to pelvic thrusts on the street corner as my primary form of exercise.
@sammeem If I wear warm boots and a hat, then it's not REALLY nude jogging. This state is always trying to censor me.
@funkomatic I suppose I could drag my treadmill out to the end of my driveway and do my nude jogging there. I see you have some experience
@sammeem But if I run too fast, people won't be able to take in my beauty.
@TheHussman Boots always seem to take the romance out of my nude jogs.
How am I supposed to nude-jogging if we're supposed to get 9 inches of snow by tomorrow night. This state is cramping my style.
@TheCoyoteDreams An even 30. Also, I want video of every single bite.
@OutlandishMatt Yeah. We might be talking about two different things.
@stuckpixel Men don't wait a few weeks to step up to a challenge of their manliness.
I have to help my retarded sister move today. Having handicapped family members is hard.
@UBLF You better take the word "Navy" out of that store's title. Everyone knows that the Navy is the least manly branch of the military.
@benredmond I propose we hold this competition at 5pm on the top of a mighty zeppelin.
@UBLF fisticuffs was acceptable back in the heyday of manliness, but now companies like Abercrombie and Fitch are making men too pretty.
@benredmond I accept those conditions, but would like to add that each contestant must drink a gallon of milk after each set.
@UBLF Manly men do not engage in sit-up contests. There are two contests: push-ups and banging chics.
@CPLPokerPodcast Just so you know, all of that poker-talk got Ryan back on the poker wagon. He's become quite the little gambler.
I will challenge any one of you people to a push-up contest.
Great. Now I know what a dog fart tastes like.
Thank god this is the last season of Lost. I hope they shoot the writers on the finale so another studio doesn't accidentally hire them
@deanfx but they won't and for some reason it's illegal to murder them
@deanfx gross right? I'm far too important to be traveling via city bus.
This bus smells like fried food and ass crack.
@stuckpixel Well I'm keeping it a secret from you for sure. I don't need you stinking up my bunker during Armageddon.
@xeniterhood I don't know. It seems risky. (But not as risky as geting a nuke dropped on my unbunkered head).
I'm sad that only crazy people are building bunkers underneath their houses these days. I want one, but I don't want the reputation.
@TheHussman Only one of them is sweet and chocolaty. The other is bitter and turns my stomach.
@greekfood Seriously? I would have thought that I was the first to combine these two things.
Eating Nutella and translating ancient Greek.
@FreeTheFeross There is literally no way you could best me in CS.
@FreeTheFeross You'd get destroyed in CS. Just trust me on this.
3 cheers for Steve Jobs and Apple! They've released a product that has no function which hasn't already been fulfilled by superior product!
@FreeTheFeross I'm positive that they're not. Do you have a Live account?
@FreeTheFeross Students would use it constantly. The iPad has no real use that isn't better filled by another peice of hardware.
@FreeTheFeross Yeah. League play is dead though. And there are way too many cheaters out there.
Seriously? The iPad doesn't have stylus input? That might be a deal breaker.
@FreeTheFeross I play on xbox live. I haven't logged on to my steam account for years. Not since CS died.
How many apple fanboys are sporting huge pants-tents today?
@FreeTheFeross Yes I was. It's good times.
@NikkiAndrews Perfect.
@NikkiAndrews Well that doesn't sound good either. Could you move your house/apartment to Seattle? Then I'd be on board.
More chics need to be named Lacy. Also their outfits should match their names.
@xoMusicLoverxo Am I wrong to want to kill zombies?
@MarikoWTF exactly
@benredmond And just for the record, I still downed the whole can.
@benredmond These Spaghetti O's just burned the roof of my mouf.
@NikkiAndrews Where do you live now? Maybe we can just switch houses. I hate this place.
Screw schoolwork. I have zombies to kill.
Got a shipment of video games and schoolwork from Amazon.com today. Talk about mixed emotions.
@NikkiAndrews I don't know. Did you know that it's 8 degrees here today?
@zuppup1 I'm sure that you will. Your first order of business is to party down. Now get to work.
@zuppup1 Now we're talking. You can be Commander of the Funk Parade.
@zuppup1 No No No. Disco Balls and flashing lights. That's the type of partying down we do on this campaign.
@NikkiAndrews You're moving to MPLS? Why? This place kinda sucks.
@zuppup1 I'm not sure that we share the same campaign vision. Krispy Kreme donuts aren't apart of my partying-down arsenal.
@cyberRAH612 I have a disco ball too! I will put you in charge of campaign disco balls. You're title will be "Chairman of The Fever."
@NikkiAndrews You can be the Secretary of Partying Down.
When I run for President, I'm running on the platform "A Dance Party In Every Home." Who wants to be my running mate?
I have already almost fallen down twice today.
#Doesntmeanyourblack I love that this trending topic has a misspelling in it. You people are all complete morons.
@TheHussman  I feel guilty about laughing at your jokes. Does that happen often to you?
Is anyone out there familiar with Attic Greek? I have a billion questions.
@TheHussman Hoo-ha!
@TheHussman Yeah, yeah. I knew that, but I misfired my joke.
@Birk0111 you're welcome.
@Birk0111 yeah. My joke was off by a day.
@Bkeller49 he knows (and so do I). I'm just too stupid to make a joke that refers to the correct day.
@stuckpixel Ha. I knew that, but it doesn't mean I can't practice tonight.
Stupid Ryan canceled practice tonight so he could watch the Vikings game. Anyone bands for a guitar player/singer? I can practice tonight.
Today's soundtrack will be provided by The Killers.
@Bkeller49 Which one am I? I'll assume I cover both the informative and  insightful categories.
#fatthoughts = @MightyPez
@giuliaz1 No kidding.
@suzee_Q Extremely sick. Universities need someone to punch their faces.
@MelissaCamille Yeah. That's how much one of my books was this semester. I better use it more than once.
@RBoesche You don't agree?
I just paid $225 for TWO textbooks (one of which was used). I think students are single-handedly keeping the printed word in business.
@TomFellowes Agreed. A Handkerchief/Kleenex is better than a snot rocket to the bushes, but we're a civilized people. We should act like it.
@Bkeller49 Snarky? Do you follow me? I'm not a very nice person. Snarky is my business.
@lhein @kristimcarlson I only speak the truth. People need to start listening to me.
#LetsBeHonest The majority of people who contribute to these idiotic twitter trends can barely speak English.
@TheHussman Dude. You're the devil.
@TheHussman Not funny. So gross. Now I'm angry with you.
@TomFellowes Couldn't we instead find some place private? Like a bathroom? Where similar types of disgusting activities take place?
@TomFellowes I don't like it should be socially acceptable to publicly expel anything from the inside of your body.
@TheHussman So gross.
Listen up Minnesotans. Stop blowing your F-ing noses in public. It's disgusting.
Hey Wisconsin, time to visit Jenny Craig.
@Dino_Quarin Oh how I love that video. The more I watch it, the more I love Walken.
@Dino_Quarin By "Breathe" do you mean "Go on a shooting spree"? If you do, I'm already half way there.
Ryan and I saw Sherlock Holmes yesterday and he was constantly trying to put his hand on my knee.
@seymourblue No deal. I'm going to need a few guns to solve today's problems.
@Dino_Quarin I've been on campus for 4 hours and have only become angrier.
@Dino_Quarin No Megadeath song could ever be as angry as I am right now.
It's my first day back on campus and I want to murder everyone around me with my bare hands. This is going to be a great semester.
@KristaWeeks0171 Do you work for twtmuzik or something?
Good practice tonight. Big decisions were made (along with a lengthy debate on the ethical implications of cloning).
@Elfiem Wha? Did I miss my chance to co-host a hit webcast?
@Birk0111 No No. I sat in my house and starred at a computer screen for a hundred and fifty hours.
Back to school on Tuesday. Lame. This vacation has been retarded.
@xoMusicLoverxo You're not wrong.
@xoMusicLoverxo No. I've always thought it was terrible. I'm only now announcing it.
@KevDough what? no way.
I'm starting to think that "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace" may be the worst movie ever created.
@xoMusicLoverxo your Paneras are cooler than mine.
@xoMusicLoverxo What about hipsters playing video games?
@xoMusicLoverxo 10 really? I dig their food, but I hate the old ladies wearing blue-tooth headsets who eat there.
@xoMusicLoverxo On a scale of 1-10, how much do you love Panera?
Panera Bread for dinner. I hate everyone who eats and/or works here. I suppose that means I hate myself.
This world is filled with too few cupcakes. What a tragedy.
@NikkiAndrews You are a sexual deviant.
Answer this question: Which member of the Law and Order franchise is your favorite? If you answered SVU, you're a sexual deviant.
This vacation hasn't been much of a vacation. People have been making me work the entire time. Being an adult is stupid.
@giuliaz1 No way. You need to ride that haircut out. McGyver needs us to keep his memory alive through hair styles.
@Lauren_Sparkles It was well on it's way to that level of excellence.
@Lauren_Sparkles You are obviously highly uneducated upon the nature of Ryan's Mustache. The word "Glorious" only scratches the surface.
Ryan shaved his glorious mustache before practice tonight. Unacceptable.
Sitting down to do some much overdo editing on these tracks. "The Slow Death of a Custodian" is up first.
@ColoradoFilm Thank you kind sir or madam.
@Bkeller49 Well, things were working perfectly until I quit my job and went back to school. Then everything flew to pieces.
@Bkeller49 At some point in one's life, cars begin working correctly?
I own 3 cars. 2 are undrivable at the moment and the 3rd was lent out months ago. So I was forced to borrow a car. It broke down yesterday.
@josiahkosier As soon as they're ready, I suppose.
@josiahkosier Ha. Speaking of the big time, when are you back in town? I have mixable tracks.
Hung out with the guys from @americannovel and @cathycrescendo. They're terrible at using Twitter, but their music is pretty brilliant.
@josiahkosier Did you really vote?
Eyeliner was voted #1 in the CPL Poker Podcast's "2009 Best of Music" contest. Thanks to everyone who voted! http://bit.ly/70IHCJ
I wish someone would make a movie staring Clint Eastwood and Keanu Reeves.

@UBLF Really? What if my guilty pleasure is murdering people?
@UBLF Dude. Not cool man.
Neck ties are for your weak, suburban fathers.
In 2010 I will karate chop Hilary Duff in the throat.  #awesomeresolutions
In 2010 I'm going to make many, many children cry. #awesomeresolutions
I bit my lip during dinner on Monday and have managed to re-bite it at every successive meal.  I'm not even sure if I'm a vegetarian anymore
@philosophy_ Usually we're a band, but around the holidays we overeat.
@giuliaz1 That would last me until dinner.
@Litarider There's no need to worry about me breaking that rule.
Yesterday was supposed to be my last day of holiday overindulgence, but then my dad gave me a jar of Nutella for Christmas. So delicious.
A stomach full of Thai food.
From now on, instead of brushing my teeth, I'm just going to eat a handful of Andes chocolate mints.
Every year around the holidays I rediscover how little self-control I actually have. People need to stop giving me candy for Christmas.
Done with school for the year. Now it's nap time.
@Sheevaun Also, I'm not sure any energy drink (or anything filled with caffeine for that matter) could be considered healthy.
@Sheevaun @BrainToniq looks like it has a hefty level of misrepresentation regarding its ability to focus brainpower.
Energy drinks are the devil. I have had two today.
Spending the next 4 hours refreshing my memory on everything that I've been studying for the last 3 days. Then test. Then nap. Then murder.
Last late night of the semester. Ready to be done.
@Bkeller49 We actually have a solid crowd of older listeners - which is good cause I'd rather talk about Paul Simon than Miley Cyrus.
@Bkeller49 Awesome. I can't wait. Though, I usually try to push an old person down the stairs at the end of every show. Is that fine?
@Bkeller49 Ha. We're recording at the moment, but are getting ready to book all kinds of new shows.
@Bkeller49 I'm not sure what you mean. I was trying establish that 4 minutes is not always enough to convey musical ideas.
@Cliffshade Why thank you sir.
@Bkeller49 I think some things (both musically and lyrically) take time to say. Ever heard of a 4 minute symphony?
@chrispetterson I'm going to pretend that you're wrong about that.
@Bkeller49 If song writers could say everything they need to say in under 4 minutes, there would be no reason to write more than one song.
I'm thinking about making a 20 minute long version of "Tunnels." Who's on board? http://bit.ly/7gn4Qh
@chrispetterson I wish more people were like you. 20 minute songs don't go down easy for most people.
If I make a 20 minute version of one of our songs, would anyone listen to it?
@xoMusicLoverxo Ha. Scrooge actively wants people to be less happy, I want them to be happier - Christmas isn't a good reason for happiness.
@xoMusicLoverxo It used to be awesome, but since I've become an angry old man, its the least fun time of the year.
@xoMusicLoverxo I wish.
Finally getting ready for my last test of the semester. Then I'm going to nap until New Years.
@funkomatic I've stayed up very nearly that long and seem to remember being miserable and bitchy.
@funkomatic Is that true?
@Alchemy16 I am in school. Is that ok?
@walkthedeadline School. They're actively trying to kill me.
I haven't slept in 2 days. I'm going to murder someone.
What kind of school puts a final exam on a Saturday? The kind that wants me dead.
@funkomatic Oh! Your jokes make me laugh while simultaneously becoming nauseated.
Anyone know of a place where I can purchase a new neck? Mine started to malfunction during the night.
@whiskeydrifters That's cool. Where/what are you studying?
@MelissaCamille @suzee_Q My trick is that I can talk very fast and make my life sound extremely complicated.
@whiskeydrifters I plan to keep making delicious music, but I'm also preparing for a grad program in psychology.
@whiskeydrifters Apparently sell insurance, used cars or anything else that requires fast-talking and subtle dishonesty.
@whiskeydrifters Nope. I just convinced her that my grade shouldn't be affected by my inability to turn in assignments - seriously.
I tricked my Greek professor into giving me an A on an assignment I didn't do (and it involved no lying). I should go into used car sales.
@Bkeller49 Of course it was full court. Do you see me wearing a skirt?
@kristimcarlson very smart
@Birk0111 Your ideas are quite brilliant
@Cliffshade Sounds good to me
Played basketball for an hour at the gym. That should buy me another pan of brownies. Right?
Off to the gym. I feel a bit guilty for eating a pan of brownies today.
@giuliaz1 thanks! You're the best.
@saegs Yes. You. Would.
@StDAY Ha. Sounds good!
@StDAY You're the best once again. Did you vote!?
Everyone should head over to http://tinyurl.com/yewp3cr and vote for "Eyeliner" in their "2009 best of Music Contest." Thanks!
@giuliaz1 A dainty nose wipe is perfectly acceptable.
@sammeem It will be illegal everywhere, but if you blow your nose in a restaurant you get the death penalty.
When I'm in charge, it will be illegal to blow your nose in a public place.
@stuckpixel Those guys are cool. I dig their tunes.

We resurrected an "Tunnels" tonight and gave it a facelift. Its now 10% more depressing. http://bit.ly/657bvR
@razvan_popescu Thank you!
This state and I are about to have an all out rumble.
@lhein Other browsers and I get a long better.
@lhein I'm only talking about safari. Not my mac. Though, all computers crash eventually.
@zulufox_1911 I use many different browsers. They All have their strengths and weaknesses. Safari just more of the later.
@zulufox_1911 Today I am.
@lhein Safari as actually pretty notorious for its crashes.
@Elfiem I suppose it's possible. I've never heard of such a thing though.
@zulufox_1911 Brand New Mac Powerbook. Safari can't handle multimedia or scripting of any kind.
Anyone who enjoys using the Safari Browser should have their drivers licenses taken away. A love for crashing can be dangerous.
@Elfiem You'll have other songs to tide you over.
@Elfiem Ha. That track is a bit on the old side. The new version is much cooler.
@Elfiem Ha. You found it huh?
@Elfiem There will be a few other tunes out before Elixir, but it will be in your ears soon enough.
@xoMusicLoverxo Ha. You don't have to listen to it. I won't be mad either way.
Neck Beards Spotted today: 5
@robbytalk Oh thanks! What makes me fun to follow? My looks? My keen observations about Faux Hawks and Neck Beards?
@xoMusicLoverxo As usual, you're the best.
@robbytalk Wait. What Am I being thanked for?
The second half of the CPL Poker Podcast interview has been released. Check it out: http://bit.ly/42q1sp http://bit.ly/7iFnL5
@noisy_bishop_jr Plus we can add basically every female comedian that's ever existed (Of course there are a few exceptions).
@saegs Wait, I thought you hated highlander.
@StoryofMyLife Well thank you.
I think Drew Carey and Jimmy Fallon should teach a class on how to be unfunny and still make it as a professional comedian.
@Elfiem Unfortunately,  I think you're advice is impossible.
@Elfiem In my fireplace, electricity does the jobs that a log would normally do.
@Elfiem The snow would be fine if it didn't come with the unbearable cold weather.
@NYCHICKUNEED You're an idiot.
RT @CPLPokerPodcast: 2nd half of @parachutesfail interview on next podcast - recording tonight, up on web Friday (probably)
@saegs Only because it worked so well the first time.
@Allison_Feldman Santa got mad at me when I mentioned that he and his wife had a slight weight problem. That was 10 years ago.
#iaintafraidtosay The vast majority of Twitter users are far too stupid to string 140 characters together coherently.
Someone needs to give me an Xbox 360. Who's it going to be?
Nutella Sandwich = lunch.
@Elfiem I'm done. It didn't turn out as well as I had hoped, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
@Cliffshade Who's damning assassins?
It's becoming very obvious that these people want me dead.
@UBLF But we should have new demos up very soon.
@UBLF I'm finishing up the production on a 3 song EP due out in Jan/Feb. "Custodian" will be among the tracks released.
@UBLF Did you hear our goofy interview on @CPLPokerPodcast?
@UBLF No problem. You'll be the first to get the new version of it when it's complete.
@UBLF Dude. How's it going? How'd our podcast do?
A squadron of snowplows is scraping the pavement outside my window and though my fireplace is electric, the heat it throws is real.
@Birk0111 I wish. I need to eat candy so I can stay up all night and finish school crap.
@mpdoh You know it.
This whole box of DOTS will be gone by morning.
@TaraIsha Nothing as actually wrong. I just complain a lot.
@TaraIsha Not okay.
Holy crap.
@lhein Yeah. Its not exactly fun.
@lhein I'd argued myself out of the position I was trying to take.
@lhein It's still in process. I asked for an extension.
I hate everyone who just tweets quotes all day - that is, unless they're quotes of mine.
@nonfinite You sent that message 34 minutes ago and I still don't have a needle in my arm. I thought you cared.
@Jplan72 Dude. If you really cared about me, you would drive over there, get it and drive it to me.
@xoMusicLoverxo I didn't save it until the last minute. I've been working on it for 3 days.
Does anyone know of an energy drink company who delivers?
T-Minus 16 hours until my paper is due and I just threw out my whole concept and have to start from scratch.
@xoMusicLoverxo Uh oh. I guess I'll have to tell Ryan that you don't love us anymore.
@xoMusicLoverxo Thanks! Have you listened to it yet?
Have you all listened to us on the CPL Poker Podcast yet? I think it's time that you do. http://cplpoker.blogspot.com/
@xeniterhood How do you see that played out in reality?
@chrispetterson more like, Christianity preaches a message of consumption - whether that be resources, products, food, etc.
@stuckpixel But you still think that religious affiliation has a fueling effect on American overconsumption?
@stuckpixel what are some of the reasons that you think they're connected?
@iaeon But do you think it directly affects the actual act of consuming?
@Cliffshade That all may be true, but it doesn't get to the heart of my question. Does the relationship exist?
@stuckpixel What about more than just just food consumption? Resources, Consumer products, people, animals?
Question for my tweeps: Do you think that religious affiliation has a causal relationship with overconsumption in America?
@lhein I have significantly more than 6. The editing is becoming a nightmare.
@Elfiem I think it's probably more likely the promptings for overconsumption are subconscious rather than causal.
@lhein The religious influence on overconsumption in the US.
@Elfiem Right. Though considering the widespread adherence to Christianity, is our overconsumption a side effect of something terrible?
@lhein My brain already hurts bad and I have two days. Also, my paper is only 6 pages.
@lhein 15 pages in one night? Well, I'm impressed.
@Elfiem I had just begun looking at his research. This paper is starting to feel like an editing nightmare.
@ChrisKauza Script lance isn't a philosophy writing website.
@lhein Nice. What was your topic?
@Elfiem The religious effects on American consumption.
Who wants to write this philosophy paper for me?
@xoMusicLoverxo Why thank you very much.
@NextStageBiz Great! Mark and Phil are very cool. It was very fun to be on the show.
@NextStageBiz Why thank you very much.

@MinnesotaSoccer That still doesn't make me happy. I think I need to move.
Screw you winter.
@giuliaz1 At this point I would likely live anywhere else on the planet provided it was 10 degrees warmer.
Just got done recording a broadcast with the guys from @CPLPokerPodcast . Those guys know how to do their research.
@arisunflower Hey! Remember when you said you were coming to a million of my shows and then never came to any? I remember too!
@Celisabeta I obviously haven't dedicated much of my life to the criticism your choices, but your strong reaction makes me think I should.
@bribribrite_210 @MsWinMLB @BuciBubu @Celisabeta If you've really seen that terrible movie that many times, you're worse than Hitler.
@nonfinite That's the first time I've ever unselfishly retweeted anything. Congratulations.

@tehghettosmurf I'll wear a costume that makes me look like a Tbone steak. They won't be able to resist me and then WHAM! Nukes.
My wife just texted this to me: "The majority of housewives are incapable of driving and thinking at the same time." She's a keeper.

@tehghettosmurf Not a bad idea. Though, Texans will probably use their guns to shoot at us, and that's a problem.
@CharlieRadio What? Airwolf? Are you responding to the tweet I sent out a few weeks ago?
@benredmond Good idea. I will add it to the proposal.
@kittyhasclaws A good call. I will add it to the proposal that I'm submitting to the president.
@kittyhasclaws We just need a place to nuke these people and Nebraska seems like the logical choice.
I say we herd all the @nickjonas and #Twilight fans, into Nebraska and just start dropping nukes on them. Who's with me?
@xeniterhood yes you must
That sandwich was far too delicious. Time to hit the gym.
@tehghettosmurf Dude. Time to get your twittering off the ground.
@xeniterhood That's probably true. But following us makes you attractive to whomever you'd like to attract. Those are the facts.
@TheHussman It could be possible to speed up the process through intense Parachutes Fail Brand Therapy.
@xeniterhood But extensive studies have not been performed concerning that people group.
@xeniterhood Well, I think that the Following Us/Attraction ratio works the same among the homosexual populace.
@TheHussman Good things take time. Also, it depends on how stupid/unattractive you are when you start to follow.
@xeniterhood I don't think I can answer that question without more information, but you'll be making a poor decision if you unfollow.
Following Parachutes Fail will make you smarter and more attractive to the opposite sex.
Seriously. America needs something comparable to the siesta. We would all be happier.
put the finishing touches on "March" today. We're churning out the hits these days. http://bit.ly/5AvuH4
@Cliffshade We accept those as well. Also, I'm not sure the world needs another Highlander movie. They last few were terrible.
@Cliffshade Well, if you want to donate your American dollars, Parachutes Fail will not refuse them. Tunes will be up on iTunes shortly.
@Cliffshade We're about to release a new EP, but I'll probably just send you the tunes for free anyway!
I wish candy wasn't so delicious. Then I wouldn't have to hit the gym as often.
Worked a bit on a swanky new version of "Eyeliner" last night and planned out the next 3 records (seriously). http://bit.ly/5gJkU1
Thanksgiving was lame this year. I'm canceling next year's celebration and replacing it with "Robocop Day."
@juliacanderson Don't argue with me. I'm a man.
@stewie81 There are many many killings that go unsolved every year.
@stewie81 I have many violent urges, but none that are repressed (at least that I'm aware of).
@PrettyAnetka It is. Just re-watch Armageddon instead.
@PrettyAnetka It's neither scary nor watchable.
@ghettoeyezpub It's that bad.
Just finished watching 2012. If you can avoid seeing it, please do. Oh, Oliver Platt, why have you forsaken me?
Just got done reading a months worth of my tweets aloud to my family. We all came to the same conclusion: I am a comedic genius.

@Julie_1976 All right. I may have oversold my physique.
@popculturezoo Awesome - except for Omega Man. I can't get behind that one.
@Lauren_Sparkles Yeah. That's what I keep telling my idiot mother. I always say "I'm funny not mean, you moron!"
@Julie_1976 The sensitive and compassionate singer.
@popculturezoo Woah Woah Woah. Which movies? Please say Tron.
@Julie_1976 Video? http://tinyurl.com/co997v Sorry that my physique is covered by clothing, but I can't post the fun videos on YouTube.
@popculturezoo Well, I think that we can come to some kind of an agreement. Though, you may have to work on your wife a little.
@Julie_1976 I have other sexy qualities - like my huge muscles and superior intellect.
@Lauren_Sparkles Some call it a sense of humor. Some call it an inability to express any emotion except for anger (mostly my mom).
@popculturezoo Easy now. Let's not go crazy. Maybe if you just admit that it was a mistake we can put this mess behind us.
@Lauren_Sparkles Not as much as your avoidance of Twilight means to me.
@popculturezoo No excuse.
@Lauren_Sparkles Good for you. You're a better person because of it.
@Julie_1976 A very good decision. But in all honesty, any decision that lets you be friends with me is a good one.
If you've been to a viewing of the most recent Twilight movie, you're too stupid to talk to me. Sorry.
@laura82n not at all.
Dear Bruce Springsteen, please stop making music. It would mean a lot to me. Thanks.

@MelissaCamille Ahhh. Ok. now we're on the same page. Where do you go to school?
@MelissaCamille Your family?
Time to swing through the vegetarian-food store so that I can participate in tomorrow's festival of carcass eating.

@t3hg3n Sweet. Keep in touch. I will provide you with many free MP3's in the near future.
@MelissaCamille Those professors think they can do whatever they want.
@t3hg3n Well thank you very much. How did you run across our stuff?
@saegs Hey. You're mean.
I swear, this school is trying to assassinate me with coursework.
@iAMtaylordactyl How have you been failing?
@seosurvivor Well we as a society can do the ethical thing and make other people's enjoyment of Twilight impossible.
@TaraIsha Exactly.
If someone had gone on a shooting spree at the Twilight premier, I would have nominated them for a Nobel Peace Prize.
@ChiaraWaters Well thank you very much. I also like you and your last tweet.
@seosurvivor Humanity has created a world in which Twilight movies are somehow socially acceptable. Teenage girls are just living within it.
I love it when movies like Twilight hit the theaters. The box office numbers always prove that my hatred of humanity is justified.
@saegs You don't ever get to hear it.
@UBLF By the way man, thanks for including us in your last podcast. You're very kind and it sounded great.
Last night, in a skin tight jumpsuit, Ryan recorded the last of his tracks for the "Godspeed Spaceman" demo.

@TheHussman You may be right, but I would sure feel better.
@Lilitree Screw hiding the body. I would rather go to jail than take this test.
@saegs The Airwolf of the ground - a valid substitution.
If I were to stab a classmate, would I still have to take this midterm?
@CharlieRadio The A-Team is good, but it's no Airwolf.
I propose that Airwolf was the greatest television program to have ever been created.
@Lauren_Sparkles Well thank you very much. How did you find it?
@RockChickDesign (Also, no need to apologize. These are the types of conversations that are beneficial to have - for everyone).
@RockChickDesign And yet the use of the word is not met with opposition from people with cancer (or their family/friends).
@RockChickDesign Example: The word "cancerous" is also a negative word, used to describe a human handicap and a problematic situation.
@RockChickDesign "Retarded" however, hasn't changed in meaning and just includes a people group who posses the handicap.
@RockChickDesign The word "Gay" I agree with; it's obviously a revisal of the word to mean something specifically derogatory.
Today I rode Minnesota's Light Rail for the first time. I thought it would be exciting but it was essentially just a really long bus
I've been studying for 5 straight hours. Only 5 more to go.
@morriswm Oh man. That would have been sweet.
@showingmyassets Really? I feel like I spend far too much time on twitter.
@whiskeydrifters I should install a "Like" button on all of my tweets. Also, I wish there was such a button on women.
@RockChickDesign Why isn't retarded a good word for it? I'm not using it incorrectly.
So far, today is retarded. The only way I can see it getting any better is if I manage to see a hipster get hit by a bus.
@StDAY Ha. Force of habit, I guess.
@UBLF Awesome. Looks like I'm having cookies for breakfast tomorrow.
iHop has "Pecan Pie Pancakes." Do these still count as a breakfast food?

Ryan is on his way over for band practice. I already have the scented candles and massage oils ready.
@americannovel You're a twitter champion.
Tell these nerds to leave me alone.
@chelsV Agreed.
@xoMusicLoverxo I barely ever drink, but I'm warming up to it.
@StDAY Which word is missing?
Feels like a vodka night.
If I ever become Oprah's chauffeur, I'm going to do everyone a solid and drive the limo off a cliff. You're welcome.
@chelsV I'm almost always full of hate.
I hate that Farkle game.
@xoMusicLoverxo Nah. Some white folk are nice.
@maritorres Safe to assume.
@xoMusicLoverxo I kinda do.
@maritorres (just for the record; I'm white)
Wow. I hate white people.
Just hammered out a new tune and worked on a few new ideas for "Godspeed Spaceman"
@tifftwin Good. Good.
@giuliaz1 Well thank you very much. We're close to wrapping up the studio version as well.
@acbruhaha Yes you can do that, you'll have to half-remove me from your friends list.
@tifftwin if you know people who consistently wear denim button ups, you need new friends.
@xeniterhood Especially if you do it to annoy me. And underwear counts for double irritation.
Anyone who tucks their T-shirts into their jeans can just remove me from their friends list.
@Birk0111 Ha. Turns out we have the same answer.
@giuliaz1 Wait. What was lovely and poignant? My tight leather pants?
@UBLF I'm all about the cross promotion.
Check out "The Slow Death of a Custodian" on " The Chilldown Period" podcast: http://tinyurl.com/osg7fj http://bit.ly/fLjwS
@Lilitree I'm fat AND look like Bon Jovi? Awesome.
@TaraIsha The man doesn't age! He's like some kind of super-handsome robot.
@UBLF included our demo for "The Slow Death of a Custodian" in his latest Podcast. Check it out. http://tinyurl.com/osg7fj
@xeniterhood I agree.
@zuppup1 I'm going to disagree with you on this one.
@giuliaz1 Leather of course.
@TaraIsha seriously? I'm no eye doctor, but please tell me you're not driving with those eyes.
A question for the ladies: My pants are a little tight today. Does this mean I'm hot like Bon Jovi or that its time to hit the treadmill?

@stewie81 Great, now I'm sad.
@stewie81 Are you still playing with those guys at all?
@mondevoyageur wouldn't one need to possess a soul for me to look into it?
@stewie81 Are you not anymore?
@TheHussman I don't want to live in a world where these two might have children.
@stewie81 I do now. Looks like they post on 8bitcollective.com. I spend a fair amount of time on that site.
Two people are breaking up around the corner from my desk. I just overheard one say "It's not you, and it's not me. It's 'We.'" Gun please.

Last night I made a sweet song on my Gameboy. It sounds like a collaboration between Paul Simon and Mega Man.

@StDAY @xoMusicLoverxo I do what I can.
@xoMusicLoverxo @StDAY I just started organizing my Twitter Lists. So far, the two of you have your own category.
@UBLF Exactly. Pimped Rascals are the wave of the future.
I wonder if I could get my insurance company to pay for one of those Rascal motorized scooters...
The day is quickly coming when I will go on a massive shooting spree. First I'm targeting anyone who tweets purportedly inspirational quotes
@StDAY Just wait. Harry Potter books already get compared to classical Greek literature.
@StDAY The problem is, come 20 years from now, people will probably be touting those retarded vampire books as actual literature.
@Birk0111 Reading is good. Those vampire books are just ruining everything.
Book stores should just officially rename the Young Adult section to "Vampire Books."
@juliebonner Even if your son is well tomorrow, the onion had nothing to do with it.

@benredmond Hey. I thought we were going to be friends and back each other up? I protected you to Scottie yesterday.

@JimiOverdrive Crap. What kind of things happened?
I couldn't access Twitter for the last few hours and it seemed like my life had no meaning.
@Cliffshade 3Gs of course. What do I look like, a homeless person?
@smee61 why should I get an iPhone over the many other options?
@DanaciousP I already know all of this. I'm looking for drawbacks (of which there are many).
@stuckpixel obviously paying for the intertnet is secondary to the other functions. It surfs the internet just as well as my current phone.
You people need to talk me out of getting an iPhone.
@geckstrom Also, you'd have to consider the energy it takes to move one's head closer to the glass. I think the snuggy still wins.
@geckstrom Well that depends on whether you consider suction to me less lazy than lifting.
@TaraIsha This is all true.
@Alchemy16 Really? I don't think I could ever even think about trying one.
@suzi_quzi A valid, valid entry. But the snuggie still seems lazier.
I propose that the Snuggie (The blanket/Bathrobe fusion) is he laziest invention in human history. Thoughts?
@Cliffshade Well, you still might be. I haven't had a chance to check yet.
Traffic was terrible today. I wish I had been driving my monster truck.
@MorganGetty Babies are ugly. Someone had to say it.
@Cliffshade I'll talk to a few doctors and see if I can't get my hands on some handsome hormones for you. I don't need any myself.
@petervader I'm watching the 3rd season right now. I had been avoiding the show for years but decided to give it a shot.
@EarleyDaysYet Good. I'm glad you're willing to cast off your motherly instincts in favor of logic. Babies are ugly.
@TaraIsha It was creepy, but in a good way. Oprah deserves to be eaten by birds. The world just hasn't caught up to my subconscious.
@Birk0111 Agreed. If any more babies come near me, I'm kicking them.
@xoMusicLoverxo @StDAY I was ugly when I was a baby. Luckily, like a fine wine, I have aged well.
@Cliffshade I was ugly. I grew out of it.
@kristimcarlson @EarleyDaysYet You guys are my new best friends.
@OutlandishMatt Seriously? You think those wrinkly piles of crap are cute?
@detroitmommy Luckily I grew out of the ugliness.
Babies are ugly.

The bus driver keeps coughing into the mic. There's a 90% chance that I'm going to catch bird flu on this trip.
@TaraIsha Well, I didn't actually do it, but I would if I could. Does this make me sadistic or just potentially sadistic?
@TaraIsha Wha! Disgust? You think I'm disgusting just because I want to murder Oprah?
@nil17 Agreed. I wish I could have that dream every night. Talk about the perfect start to your day.
@TaraIsha You're not the first person to say that. Hopefully I'll make it a little longer without the authorities taking notice.
Last night I dreamed that I watched Oprah get eaten by flesh-eating birds. I could have saved her but I didn't. I made the right decision.
@xoMusicLoverxo We can't wait either.
@xoMusicLoverxo Well, will get to hear the before most. We've a got new round of demos coming post haste.

Screw trick or treaters. I'm going to a movie.
Off to see Granny in the nursing home. We got her a fancy new neck massager.

@TheHussman The Android OS is pretty sweet, but so is the iPhone OS and the iPhone has more apps. This is a hard decision.
@TheHussman Of course, but the choices are still widely underpowered and (excuse my vanity) ugly.
@dirtysparkle Very interesting. Thanks.
Writing a critique of Mary Anne Warren's view on animal rights. Any suggestions from the more philosophical lot of you?
@Birk0111 we should start a charity hat raises money for people who want iPhones.
@TheHussman See, the best Android phones come at the same price tag as the iPhone, but the iPhone is arguably far more functional.
@TheHussman I already own a G1. It's underpowered and awkward. I've been frustrated with it since day one.
One of my friends just bought an iPhone and now I want one. Who wants to contribute to the iPhone-a-thon?
The women's bathroom has caution tape around it. Seems appropriate.

@mvfipher Yes! I messaged you last!
@neojonics You'd think that'd be the way things work, but it's just not.
@MorganGetty I spend a large portion of my time at libraries, but I wouldn't say I like them.
@Libraryben Yeah. I'm currently sitting in one of those. It's not my favorite place, and I'm pretty sure the guy behind me has the avian flu

We head back into the studio on Saturday. The famous Ryan will be laying down some wicked guitar work this time around.
@xoMusicLoverxo He's a perv.
@Birk0111 He's a perv.
Ryan came to practice with no pants on.
Here's a little tidbit of information: I haven't shaved in over a month and I haven't had a haircut since August. I am patently disgusting

@levdir seriously? You like black licorace and you haven't taken your own life yet?
@KimBrame So gross. Anyone who likes it is obviously retarded.
@Rayvhen Have you had any black licorice lately? It's like eating from the garbage.
The girl next to me is eating her pizza by pinching finger-fulls of melted cheese an toppings. It sounds gross because it is.
@serrotho I postulate that no such thing exists.
@jakespice They should have taken the hint.
Anyone who enjoys black licorice is my new arch enemy.

Spent the day making new versions of some old songs. The smooth sounds of Parachutes Fail will hit your earlobes soon enough.
@iAMtaylordactyl Not at all. In fact, I think that people who are obsessed with my music are more intelligent and rational than anyone
@iAMtaylordactyl Of course I want to see some fan art.
@iAMtaylordactyl Ahhh. You're one of a very small group of people that's heard that tune. Did you find the YouTube vid?
@Birk0111 Ha. You should trick all of your friends into eating hummus sandwiches.
@iAMtaylordactyl Where did you find a copy of Tunnels?
@benredmond This is a fun game. I wouldn't want to play it with anyone but you. #phonycompliments
@benredmond I'm sure your wife and family love and respect you! #phonycompliments
@iAMtaylordactyl Ha. I can't wait.
@iAMtaylordactyl We should have a new round of demo's in the next couple weeks.
@iAMtaylordactyl All the tunes on MySpace were demo'd in my house. We've been working on studio record for about a year (3 actually)
@benredmond Dude. Your intellect is unmatched in the western world.  #phonycompliments
@iAMtaylordactyl I'm working on a new version of that tune even as we speak.
@StDAY A good call. I better stay away from Sex in the City as well.
@StDAY Must have been.
@StDAY Crap the hummus has already affected my judgment!
These slacks really round out my ensemble. Nothing pulls an outfit together like a nice pair of slacks.
@Bkeller49 Well crap. I should have done a little research before I ate that sandwich.
@bshoc Dude. I'm sure you get this a lot, but are you the dude from Icy Hot Stuntaz?
@Bkeller49 Really? Terrorists eat humus? I would never have guessed.
@susandyoung I'm not sure. It seems like they often go hand in hand.
@benredmond You are one of the smartest, most clever and handsome people I have ever met #phonycompliments

@eewolfe You may be right.
@eewolfe You can preorder a grave plot on amazon? I should really get my affairs in order.
@Rayvhen Has anyone ever tried to put a toddler in a blender? That doesn't sound like a good drink but it could cure my sneezes.
@eewolfe Wait. when someone walks on your grave, you sneeze? How does one sneeze when they're dead?
@misstdoe Great. Fox news was right. Swine Flu is going to kill everyone.
@Rayvhen What the hell is a "Hot Toddie"? Is it a Toddler that has been murdered and blended into a slushy-like drink?
@espyem (It was a joke about how frightened people can be about swine flu).
I just sneezed 3 times in a row. Do I have swine flu?
Oh how I wish that coffee didn't taste like dirty bean water.

No doubt about it, I need a cupcake.
@xoMusicLoverxo My humor does have the power to heal.
@Birk0111 DOTS very often go bad. They become hard as a rock and break my teeth.
@taylornol DOTS are not my favorite candy, but I have had a hankering for them lately.
Even though DOTS are the most unhealthy food ever conceived, the inventor should have been nominated for the Nobel prize.
@taylornol you got it. Someone needs to expose these faux hawk wearing jerks.
Faux hawks spotted today: 5
I never imagined that Starbucks would be able find a product that tastes worse than coffee but they've done it: Pumpkin Smoothies.
@kayjay15 All of them. Jason Statham is the new Tom Selleck.
Holy crap. Jason Statham is easy on the eyes. Yes?
@JediJenn Wait what? My grandma and I don't really talk about sex much. Lucky for me.
@sissyto4 Thank you. If I had gold stars, you would win one.
@Alan_Payne Bowel movements are pretty awesome.
@acbruhaha I know someone who was trying to unload a ticket if you still want to go (provided they still have the ticket).
50% of this band is going to see Brand New and The Manchester Orchestra tonight at First Ave. Sadly, I'm not included.
@DougPreston You as well.
@JediJenn Yeah. We heard all about the prunes today too.
@milan47 Really? In what country can you die from warm vodka and cookies?
@sissyto4 Gross, right?
@DougPreston Funny you should say that. I often see people pressing a finger against one side of their nose and blowing into the bushes.
@DougPreston Well that might be gross too. I'm just asking people to move out of earshot before the evacuate their bodily fluids.
It drives me absolutely nuts when people blow their nose within earshot. Is that strange?
@xoMusicLoverxo @Alan_Payne @JediJenn @acbruhaha She didn't throw her glass eye, but she did discuss her bowel movements.
Off to visit grandma in the nursing home. $20 says she throws her glass eye at someone while we're there.
Warm vodka and cookies.
@Birk0111 I own several macs. Though, I own several windows machines as well. I'm well rounded.
Found a meat cleaver at the thrift store. Finally, I can disembowel all of these corpses. This economy affects serial killers too, people.
@kayjay15 really? Where have I been?
Holy crap! Frankenberry cereal is back on the market! Get ready, stomach.
Windows 7 and I are BFFs
spent yesterday evening turning an upbeat, optimistic song into a sad, depressing one.
@alldogboots So gross.
I just found out what a dog-fart tastes like.
Hey David Sedaris. Please stop making me cry.
Someone on the bus smells like maple syrup. I won't stop licking people until I find them.
Soap operas in the commuter lounge today. This campus bleeds excellence.
@xoMusicLoverxo Illegal drugs are the way to go. The only reason they're illegal is because "the man" doesn't want you to feel good.
Does anyone use this iLike website? http://bit.ly/h1qMv
@xoMusicLoverxo Have you tried drugs? I hear meth works wonders on cold.
@Julie_1976 Well thank you. I try to stay as fantastic as possible. Thank you for noticing.
@xoMusicLoverxo Stop being sick.
Faux Hawks Spotted Today: 13
Good practice last night. Recorded some wicked Rhodes for "Astrology." Everything is getting very close.
@Birk0111 You and I are fighting.
@giuliaz1 You're probably right. But she deserves it.
@Birk0111 Really? You think so? If this state didn't have a 7 day waiting period to buy a gun, I would ave blown my brains out days ago.
Hey mother nature, screw you. You stupid whore.
Heading into the studio to produce the @americannovel record. He sucks at Tweeting, but he's a hell of a nice guy.
College students act like old women.
My bonsai tree could beat up your mom.
@Rayvhen Papers? What type of papers are you drunkenly grading?
#why am I so handsome and talented?
It's 2:15 and I have not had a single piece of candy. Lame.
@Alchemy16 Thanks! We're in the process of putting together a few more demo's online. There will be many more songs coming very soon.
The only cure for today's events is at the bottom of a bottle of whiskey.
@Rayvhen Seriously? I feel like Watching Ellen makes you into a housewife just like every other.
@WakeUpMrBess Agreed!
@TaraIsha Well thank you very much! I really like you!
Drew Carey is no Bob Barker.
@whiskeydrifters Your wisdom is both poetic and unmatched.
@serrotho Ha. The feminist movement probably hates both of us.
50 college girls are watching Ellen Degeneres in the campus lounge. They're acting like housewives way too early.
The machines at the gym are stronger than me.
@benredmond @stuckpixel That's the one that I've been using and I want to strangle it.
Is it me or does every single Twitter app for Android suck?
@ctrygstad Yeah that's the one. Twitter sync.
So far this Twitter/MySpace app sucks.
I'm giving the Twitter to MySpace application a try today. Though, MySpace is starting to feel like a city after a nuclear war.
Holy crap it's cold today. I want to punch mother nature right in the ovaries.
I'm going to try and make it through the entire day without eating any candy.
@LydiaAllen It doesn't need to be Halloween for me to gorge myself on candy.
Holy crap. I ate a lot of candy today.
@showingmyassets The new demo-tune turned out all right. i think I'll post the raw, unedited version for the world to hear.
Recorded a brand new demo of a tune called "These New Bruises" today. It is the most depressing song ever written.
Holy crap this Minnesota weather is annoying - freezing in the morning, boiling in the afternoon. My nipples can't take the workout.
@npnicole Maybe I'll send a picture of my bikini zone to your husband, so he can tell us which is more interesting.
@levdir Well then you might like it here. It sounds like fun just isn't your thing.
@levdir If you enjoy being miserable, it's like Disney World.
@npnicole The term "zone" may imply a specific area of interest, and I assure you, my bikini zone is interesting.
Dear Minnesota, thank you for skipping summer this year. I didn't want shave my bikini zone anyway.
@mesantos2007 You say the word "Season" too much.
Today iPhone users are overjoyed by their new found MMS capability - a feature available on practically every other phone for several years
The ancient Greeks shouldn't have made it so hard for me to learn their language. Dicks.
Based on the activity on the UofM campus, I can only conclude that 75% of the worlds population is taking a nap.
Practice in 14 minutes. I better put my pants back on.
@josiahkosier They need to work on a few elementary things.
@fullbellymusic I'm sure you're right. How come everyone who deserves to die always has a gun?
There are actually people on Twitter saying that we should be working on H1N1 more than HIV. These people need to retake elementary math.
@The_Real_LJ Seriously? You think there's an H1N1 epidemic? Over 2 million people will die of AIDs this year. 429 have died of N1N1 in 2009
It's becoming clear to me that social networking web sites are actually making the world a more awkward place to live in.
@giuliaz1 A dimple in my beard would be too goddamn cute. The world wouldn't be able to handle it.
A group at my school is handing out vegetarian samples. It's the first time in a few years that I've been able to partake in free food.
Emergency vehicles currently outside my window: One ambulance, one fire truck, one police car. Looks the neighbor kids were left alone again
Little known fact about my beard: A small Puerto Rican family has set up camp near my sideburns.
@JeffFaldalen Ha. Not exactly. I just can't stand racing. Except I like it when people crash. Does that make me evil?
finishing up the last bit of tracking on our GodSpeed Spaceman demo. Should hit the net in relative short oder.
Little known fact about my beard: it speaks spanish whereas I do not.
@victoriastevens The world would be a much more even handed and enjoyable place to live. When do we starts?
@destiny2711 Those were the days.
@destiny2711 Exactly. Plus, I'm slightly obsessed with 1980's technology and it's use in music.
@destiny2711 Ha. I've always wanted a VIC20 as well. There are a few amazing musicians that use those things.
The universe has decided that I need a Commodore 64. Now I just need to find one.
@iamduncestep Why can"t I blame him? Because TMBG are sweet.
@kittyhasclaws @triiku It's pretty awesome. They have pizza and "They Might Be Giants" music playing 24 hours a day.
@iamduncestep is "dead proud of" an actual phrase?
Whoever runs this cafe is obsessed with They Might Be Giants. I can't really blame him, though.
@JeffFaldalen Really? You only watch racing? That seems like a sort of sad existence.
I'm starting a petition to reinstate public executions for people who blow their nose in public.
This morning my beard suggested that we move to a cabin in the Ozark Mountains. I think its time to shave.
Is it me or does Bon Jovi get more and more handsome each year?
@JeffFaldalen They should not be watching racing.
Anyone who is watching football needs to rearrange their priorities.
@zuppup1 Well I am a man who knows many ladies.
I'm trying to figure out an appropriate way to waste the entire day. Junk food a monster movie marathon seem like good options.
@victoriastevens Agreed.
@sarahcastic I'm not sure I could stomach a room full of parents for the length of time it would take to train them on a computer.
@zuppup1 You're going to have to be more specific.
Another of my brilliant ideas uploaded to the internet for the world to share: http://tinyurl.com/navbs8
@giuliaz1 Not today it doesn't. Though, hopefully someday soon.
@victoriastevens Agreed. Though, I think they should be lit on fire first.
@jakespice I don't want to toot my own horn but... toot toot.
@bkhighfive I need someone to drive to a specific gas station and punch a buddy of mine in the mouth. You on board? Its gonna be fun.
My arms are still sore from lifting weights 2 days ago. Does this make me a whining baby? I believe that it does.
@LydiaAllen It won't be. The universe has it in for me.
@jakespice It wasn't at first, but in order to cement my machismo - yes it is.
I just realized that I double booked myself this evening. Why do I even carry this expensive phone if I can't properly use the calendar?
I need help from someone who lives in Seattle. Pranks will ensue.
If I ever meet Kayne West in real life, I don't think I'll be able to stop laughing.
@zuppup1 Really? Did one of my many women talk to you?
Another benefit of being back in schools is for the ladies. It has been far too long since college girls have had this much access to me.
Day 3 of the Hellfire preacher on campus: I'm starting to think that he's just some kind of comedian. Do people really believe this stuff?
I just got into a sissy-slap-fight with a housefly and lost.
Someone just warmed up their fish sandwich in the microwave next to my comfortable chair. People shouldn't be able to eat fish in public.
I foolishly went to the gym last night. Now all I want to do is take naps and eat candy.
@dena33 Yeah. They're not exactly thinking clearly.
@Arubis Holy crap. Best idea ever.
@rajadeepakkumar Yes you can.
The anti-abortion crew has now rented a truck, covered it in giant pictures of aborted fetuses, and constantly drives it around campus.
@benredmond Dude. Have you seen that dude? I'm not super human - just stronger than your sorry excuse for a physique.
@Taylornol Holy Geeze. I can't even explain how special I feel.
@benredmond Dude. Are you sure you want to talk about this? Its going to be a sensitive subject for you, Kent Johnson and @YoutPastrJeff
Prolife groups have descended on the University campus. Today they're attempting to compare abortion to the holocaust.
@benredmond History has already shown that to be untrue.
I guarantee I could take all three of the Jonas Brothers in a fight.
I'm continuously impressed that people can still be interested in Twilight after they've actually seen the movie and read the books.
@ivansotschi A smile? well thank you.
@Dino_Quarin A very good band. Listen to them twice.
Spent the evening editing guitars for a little song called "Godspeed Spaceman." It's a barn burner.
@schlomoson My tweets are only for people with a sense of humor. you wouldn't understand.
I'm thinking seriously about dropping out of school and concentrating my efforts on writing hilarious Tweets.
@theBrown My taste in women is very specific; they cannot be actually dudes who are pretending to be women.
@JustJon I'm fairly certain. If the internet has taught me anything, it's that dudes pretending to be chics are a common occurrence.
Some chic on Twitter keeps telling me to look at her "Adult Profile." I'm not falling for it. $20 says her account is run by a dude.
Third day of class and my optimism has already been spent.
@jillylivi You're the best!
Heading to gym to work out and read my homework assignments - two unfavorable activities with one stone.
@lindasusan Coffee doesn't upset my stomach. It just tastes terrible.
Time for my classical greek class. I wish I could stomach coffee.
Packing up for the studio. Recordings await.
Heading in to the studio tonight to track the last unrecorded song on our upcoming EP.
@jakespice Too early to tell at the moment, but probably 4.
So far the first day of class is going well. I have managed to make it through the first few hours without failing any classes.
Back to the educational grindstone today. It still feels a little strange.
@JaxonBennett oh it is romantic. Because I'm romantic.
Just laid down a demo of a very old song called "Elixir" which looks like it may be getting a spot on the upcoming EP.
@rajadeepakkumar I don't have any kids. And that is a very good thing.
@DuvallJoshua You are too kind. Thank you very much for letting us play on Saturday. We had a great time.
We got some really great recordings tonight. Hopefully you will get to hear them soon.
Tracking The Great American Novels excellent music today. Good times.
@xoMusicLoverxo he actually hates everything to do with the internet.
Finally back home, but need to get up in a few hours to prep the studio for a recording session. I need to hurry up and get some sleep.
For some reason Ryan has decided to partake in the truck stop coffee.
Ryan just informed me that he is the right hand of god.
Good times in Des Moines. You Drake U kids certainly know how to make someone feel special.
About to hit the stage at Drake University in IA. Any last requests?
Dude has anyone heard these Cicadas? They're like the most terrifying animal ever.
Ryan is planning to take a whiz into the drive up window at a dairy queen.
I just reminded an old man that he was going to die sooner than me.
I could really go for a taco that's made with shredded babies instead of chicken.
Me: How many groupies are you gonna bag at tonight's show? Ryan: as many as it takes.
Packing up for Des Moines. I just hope they're ready for our brand of rock.
@jillylivi She's pretty awesome. I'll probably keep her around. You guys can hang probably hang out someday at a PFail concert.
@josiahkosier seriously. Sorry man. I should have realized you were talking about tonight since you were scheduling by yourself.
(wife on the phone with her sister) "We'll go to the party and dress like tramps. Well... you'll dress normal and I'll dress more like you."
We leave for Des Moines tomorrow around 1. I will be tweeting every offensive thing that is said on the trip down. Buckle up.
@Lauren_Sparkles Yeah. I was lead to believe that it was as bad as heaving your head cut off.
@xoMusicLoverxo Oh sweet!
Just found out that we're suddenly headlining the Des Moines show. I hope I don't wet my pants like last time...
@Julie_1976 I'm not sure where we're playing, but it's an outdoor show. You should skip work and come.
@jillylivi Flesh colored. Is that weird?
@xoMusicLoverxo A dork with awesome music? That both hurts and makes me happy. Nice.
@tdebolt It's tomorrow evening.
Anyone planning to come out to our show in Des Moines tomorrow? I'm thinking of wearing a sleeveless sweater-vest. Thoughts?
@tdebolt It's at Drake College. The timing is still a little up in the air (they're working on getting another band).
@jillylivi Your compliments are starting to make me blush.
@freewillygriff Exactly.
@cassYEAH Yeah. It's not dangerous.
@hastingsTVnews Ten whole days!? That's like the recovery time for the standard flu except less dangerous!
@writeforyou I would say that the same level of caution one would use for the standard flu would be quite enough with regard to Swine Flu.
Seriously. I want someone to give me Swine Flu. I want to see how newsworthy this "pandemic" really is. I'll assume it's not at all.
@freewillygriff I'm sure you're right. Though, I usually keep them around to use as cannon fodder.
People who insist on posting retarded platitudes like "Success is the best revenge!" need some time away from the internet.
@Birk0111 You've seen me in real life. You know the score.
@BearBob No need to judge. I only speak truth.
#followfriday Follow @parachutesfail those guys are sexy and hilarious.
@Taylornol Well anyone who spreads the gospel of my music gets free music for life.
Who wants to give me H1N1?
Oh ignorance, thy name is Healthcare.
Ray Lamontagne's music makes me want to take my pants off. Is that weird?
@TheHussman Right you are. I was the sweet jump master.
@Earthywoman It's all right. It's a lot less exciting these days.
@cheapsuits Dude. I also had a sweet electronic turn signal setup that I purchased at Target. It was awesome.
Made it through yesterday's bike ride relatively unscathed. I'm no where near the bicyclist I was when I was 13 though.
@xoMusicLoverxo No. Famous Daves made the chocolate covered bacon. It was called the pig licker.
@Taylornol Dude. Spreading the word about our music? You're amazing.
My calves are sunburned from my inexplicable 15 mile bike ride.
@xoMusicLoverxo No kidding. Some of it was chocolate covered though. Does that make a difference?
@ohheydanielle What! you're not coming? Great. Now I'm sad.
@xoMusicLoverxo I'm a vegetarian. My buddy Dave is the one who eats too much bacon.
So, I just quit my job. Weird.
A friend is dragging me, by bicycle, to the Minnesota State Fair. Listen to me complain here: www.oncosmopolis.com
@giuliaz1 He was on MythBusters? Oh man. That sounds like the greatest episode in history.
@giuliaz1 It is MacGyver. We should celebrate his life and legacy. Agreed?
Heading back down to Des Moines this weekend for a show at Drake College. I wonder if they require pants...
Kevin Bacon day was great. I need to start figuring out who we should celebrate next. I'm leaning toward Richard Dean Anderson.
@suzee_Q Good to hear. Next year's Kevin Bacon Day will be even better.
Kevin Bacon day is winding down. I think it has been a great success.
@suzee_Q To you as well.
Today for Kevin Bacon day, I'm listening to the Bacon Brothers' hit music and eating some hickory smoked.
@schlomoson you have not missed it! It's today! Time to break out that copy of A Few Good Men.
@xoMusicLoverxo That will probably do.
@xoMusicLoverxo Ok. It doesn't have to be a whole pound.
@ElizaHerp Yes. Yes you do.
@xoMusicLoverxo You can watch it while pressing fast forward and eating a pound of bacon. That should make up for the lack of time.
@mollierosev Agreed.
Anyone who chooses to ignore Kevin Bacon day is no friend of mine.
@destiny2711 It does indeed count.
@xoMusicLoverxo It's important that you do.
How has everyone been spending Kevin Bacon day today?
@TheMusicMan81 You can dance or just eat tons of bacon.
For those who have not heard, I have declared today to be Kevin Bacon day and celebration is mandatory.
@pol_organizing However you choose to celebrate is fine by me. Kevin Bacon and I thank you for participating.
I have declared today to be Kevin Bacon day. Celebration is mandatory.
@Birk0111 One Billion times? Very impressive.
@suzee_Q Thank you for helping to spread the word about Kevin Bacon day. It's going to be good times.
@chrispetterson What? You celebrate Kevin Bacon every Tuesday? Bravo.
@xoMusicLoverxo That sounds like a good idea. Also, spread the word about Kevin Bacon day.
@Taylornol And a happy Kevin Bacon day to you as well.
I declare tomorrow to be Kevin Bacon day.
@Taylornol I hear that. Kevin Bacon is fabulous.
Here's a bit of factual trivia: Kevin Bacon can cut a damn rug. Don't believe me? It's time for you to watch a little film called footloose.
@StDAY The world does need those things. It just doesn't know it yet.
@StDAY Yeah. I hadn't heard about it either until yesterday. It looks pretty sweet.
@Dino_Quarin It's gonna be good.
@trialanderorr Really? Are there any other borderline nerdy movies that I can be a fan of but also live in coolville?
#truestory All of my children will be named after household appliances.
How nerdy is it that I'm genuinely excited for the upcoming Tron movie? Its like I'm being given 20 more years of Tron jokes.
@noisy_bishop_jr Really? Fruit and vegetables with Meth? I'd never thought about that.
@Thrash_is_King @lloydxbanks I think you may be right.
Is 7am too early to start doing meth?
Heading out to the Minnesota State Fair today. I will be ingesting many fried foods and starting a diet next week.
@zuppup1 That tattoo would be pretty brilliant.
If you had to get a famous person's face tattoo'd on your butt, who would it be? Me: Bon Jovi.
@YourBoot trust me. There's not a single road in MN that isn't under construction all year around. Seriously.
The people in charge of road construction in minnesota are too stupid to get a job anywhere else.
@randballsstu I think you're right. And I endorse theirs.
@xoMusicLoverxo Yeah. I'm going to pick it up today.
@firedancyr7 Hopefully Collective Soul will cure your disease.
@sdrosenb Not a bad plan at all.
Dude. I'm irrationally excited for the new Collective Soul disk. Time for a 90's music revival.
@TheHussman I salute you as well. Maybe we'll share a cell someday.
@TheHussman I just wish that our social leaders would recognize the problem. In the mean time, I'll just keep getting restraining orders.
@ThisisOutcasted I'm not sure if that deserves an "Oh Snap," but I'll go along with it for now.
@TheHussman Dude. I tried to do the same thing except instead of a pageant, it was the women's restroom. Same discrimination though.
District 9 can stop trending anytime. The movie was a decent Sci Fi flick, but not nearly as good Twitter fans would have you believe.
@TheHussman Dude. you would be great in a parade. Maybe you could turn that into a full time gig.
@TheHussman Holy crap! Actually those powers sound evil, but I bet it makes doing cartwheels easier.
@TheHussman Can he do that?
Uh Oh, We're running out of Kennedys.
#musicmonday @parachutesfail - Ha. I'm hilarious.
@trialanderorr God knows I've spent several hours making fun of the Mall Goths.
@josiahkosier Hey that might be risky.
@MobbyG Not a bad plan. That seems like terribly small group though.
Yesterday I spent the day getting into arguments with fans of the Jonas Brothers. Which social group should I pick a fight with today?
@destiny2711 I know. After I tweeted, I realized that my statement was probably redundant.
Jay-Z is trending and every single mention is surrounded by complete incoherence. It looks like Jay-Z fans don't know how to read.
@belowNickswaist I'm sure your parents are very proud of you. Good luck finding a ride to their next concert.
Here's a tidbit of learning from today's conversations: If you enjoy the Jonas Brothers music, you probably can't speak English.
@belowNickswaist The fact that they've aged past puberty should actually embarrass you. Their music isn't exactly targeted at adults.
@belowNickswaist Which is why I originally asked you to quantify their talent.
@belowNickswaist And I think we've established that one's taste in music is no basis for an argument.
@belowNickswaist But your insult had nothing to do with your previous statement. It had everything to do with my taste in music.
@belowNickswaist Let's not change the subject now. I didn't ask you about that statement. I asked about your insult.
@belowNickswaist So when you tried to insult my taste in music, it actually had no validity with regard to the conversation we were having?
@belowNickswaist So when you say "Its called having good taste in music." You're not basing it on any actual facts, just your opinion right?
