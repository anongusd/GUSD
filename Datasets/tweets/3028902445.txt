@GiveEmHelenTai Raising money in NYC because no one in the district will contribute? Or is it because your far-left views align more with politicians in NYC than in the District your running to represent?
@GiveEmHelenTai Be the leader your ad claims you to be and tell us (your constituents) what a “military-style assault weapons” are. As a Republican, I’ll vote for you if you can give a legitimate answer.
@GiveEmHelenTai .@WolfForPA — This is exactly why we need to elect @realScottWagner as Governor; far left candidates in your own party don’t even approve of your reckless spending.

@VerizonSupport Understood. Thanks for eventually answering the original question.
@VerizonSupport Yes — but the question is, why doesn’t @verizonfios include all fees in advertised cost? Intentionally leaving them out isn’t misleading? 🤔
@VerizonSupport Knowing they will be included, why isn’t @verizonfios more transparent &amp; include “Verizon Surcharges &amp; Fees” in the advertised Bundle cost?
@VerizonSupport Again, not surprised — just disappointed in @verizonfios misleading w/ actual cost. Why not include ALL Verizon fees in cost advertised?
@VerizonSupport Like I said, I understand the fees. Disappointed w/ the misleading advertisements similar to the business practices of a used care salesman
