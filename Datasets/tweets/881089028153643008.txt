@JohnLaprise @Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @POTUS You're now dismissed. Don't bring me biased links by self-serving organizations. Again, BEFORE Obamacare I paid less than 1/3.
@Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @JohnLaprise @POTUS And your solutions is to foist your financial issues on everyone else? We didn't bring you into this world and have our own to support.
@JohnLaprise @Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @POTUS One of the smart ones that didn't engage in the Medicaid expansion scam. Thankfully, our legislators are fiscally responsible.

@JohnLaprise @Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @POTUS I paid less than 1/3 of what I've paid for the last decade under Obamacare. Pay your own insurance. We're done paying yours for you.
@SenatorCollins We're not interested in your excuses. We want you Primaried and voted out; removed from any assignments you have, no RNC funds whatsoever.

@JohnLaprise @Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @POTUS And, "uninsured" doesn't mean "indigent". Please learn the difference.
@Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @JohnLaprise @POTUS The one that doesn't hear is you. Hypocrite. You cry about heartless and dismiss the fact that we pay TREATMENT-PROHIBITIVE deductibles.
@JohnLaprise @Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @POTUS I do not. I didn't pay more before Obamacare and people still went to ER's. I won't pay more after it collapses. Try again.
@Sharon_Goddard @RepTedLieu @JohnLaprise @POTUS I hear just fine. Take your pathetic attempt to force me to choose you over my family on down the road. You lose. Pay your own insurance.

@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Then you weren't listening and didn't read the bill before voting. Nobody can do that for you. Stop listening to Democrats.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT And? How does that change the fact that you made poor choices and now want others to pay it? 		Good luck to you as well.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Yes I do know. By your own admission you voted for it when you found out you'd get insurance despite being told subsidies would end in 5 yrs https://t.co/v9OY0YnlGk

@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT That "threshold" wasn't there before Obamacare. And I worked to make that much.

@TomPerez They know where I stand. #RepealObamacare ONLY! We did not vote to replace. Private sector will replace overnight what needs replacing.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT We make more than threshold for subsidies. It's not lower because the ins industry didn't crawl into bed with the Obama admin to lose money.

@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphy Yes, you were told this. Repeatedly. And, it was in the bill. Again, why do you think the smart states voted NOT to expand medicaid?
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphy You were told that they would end in five years, and disregarded it. Why do you think the smart states voted NOT to expand Medicaid?
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT So by your own admission above you did vote for it, despite being warned against it. How long did you expect us to pay for your bad choices?
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT And, you called your STATE representatives and told them to vote for expansion, KNOWING that federal subsidies would cease in five years.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Oh, but you did. You elected the representatives to vote, on your behalf, in favor of Obamacare. You called and told them to vote "yes".
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Are you asking me to choose between my family and you? Really? No. We're done paying for your poor choices. Take it up with your state.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT "I wasn't at risk of losing my insurance then."	Guess you should have paid attention when we warned everyone not to vote for Obamacare.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT And? Are you asking me to choose between my family and you?	For the record, thanks to Obamacare, everything is a pre-existing condition now.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Again, take that up with the state governments who will raise taxes on the taxpayers to pay for it, not us. Be sure to thank them for that.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT You weren't concerned with the many more millions who lost their superior coverage to treatment-prohibitive Obamacare premiums/deductibles.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT And again, Medicaid wasn't cut. Democrats just didn't get the massive increase they wanted.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT You'll have to take that up with the state taxpayers who will be taxed to cover it. Be sure to thank their governments for the tax increase.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Your bitch there is with the Dems who made promises that they could not keep, not with the working middle class forced to pay for it.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Wrong again. The private sector will replace more efficiently and economically than government ever will, and with policy choices.
@realDonaldTrump We voted to #RepealObamacare ONLY! The private sector will replace what needs replacing overnight and more cost effectively than government.

@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Ah, yes. Identity politics. Another reason that Democrats lost in November. Spare me your emotional blackmail. It doesn't work anymore.
@RepAdamSchiff We didn't elect a politician. We're tired of your political double-speak and patronizing. Please try to keep up.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT We're not gutting it. We're repealing it. We didn't vote to replace it. The private sector will replace overnight what needs replacing.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT Democrats have held the working middle class in contempt for decades. That doesn't surprise us. It's part of why they lost in November.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT As for premium increases, those of us who've been financially raped for the last decade to fund #Obamacare will see decreases in ours.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT "constituents not are held in contempt"	Ah, what? Would you like to try again?
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT We're not asking for your approval. In fact, it's not required. We're putting ourselves and our families first. We want Obamacare repealed.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT They are doing what WE elected them to do. #RepealObamacare. We're done being financially raped to fund it at the expense of our families.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT The fact is, little of that 168 page bill remained by the time the Democrats were finished adding and removing what they disagreed with.
@RedouteyMary @ChrisMurphyCT By the time Dems were finished with it, little of the GOP amendment remained, which is why no Republicans voted for it.	Guess you forgot.

@adinaINdc @RealMike1457 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Again, you trotted out "rape" and "danger to mother" talking points as if the majority of abortions aren't due to sexual irresponsibility.
@adinaINdc @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Yet the question remains, as if the majority of abortions are due to rape or danger to mother, rather than sexual irresponsibility.
@adinaINdc @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa I don't care who it was addressed to. The claim was made by you, as if it happens all the time. You can't cite one instance of it.
@adinaINdc @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa How many of the millions of babies aborted each year are the result of rape or the mother's life being in danger? Cite your source.

@WildChild69 @RealMike1457 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa You should probably take your own advice, child.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa And since the working middle class didn't bring you into this world, your parents can step up if you can't afford yourself.
@Gr8JohnQPublic @WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa She seems to be avoiding that question, doesn't she?
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Are you paying for their insurance? You expect others to pay for your abortions and keep their noses out of your business. Hypocrite.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa You know what costs less, half-wit? Birth control. Free and at a reduced cost at any county health clinic.
@LovesStangs2 @WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Real women do. These feminazi twits have a long way to climb before they reach that lofty position. Somehow I doubt they're capable.
@WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @LovesStangs2 @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa You should probably go back to school and learn to read. That was in response to your ignorant rhetoric.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa There's no assumption to it. One need only read your overly-emotional, overly-dramatic, attention seeking drivel to figure it out.
@WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @LovesStangs2 @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Incorrect again, but I'm sure that's a feeling you're used to.
@WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @LovesStangs2 @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Evidently the poorly educated twit is incapable of reading. How embarrassing for her.
@WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @LovesStangs2 @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Did you miss the part about you being irrelevant? Your maternity care is your business, your responsibility. Stop foisting it on others.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Poorly educated vulgar feminazi, too. Again, you're irrelevant. Pay for your own "autonomy". And it's "woman's" that's singular.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Poor, vulgar feminazi. Again, you're irrelevant. Our views don't change based on your emotional drivel.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Evidently you're all about making your choices someone else's responsibility. How unfortunate.
@WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Pity you don't know proper terms. Perhaps if you were to return to school and get a proper education, you'd have better language skills.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa We don't much care what you prefer. You're irrelevant.
@WildChild69 @LovesStangs2 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Now if only you could remember to avail yourself of birth control and use it before engaging in the act.
@LovesStangs2 @WildChild69 @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @the_amish_txtr @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Not a bit.

@tinaleeinberlin @Tactical_review @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Again, we don't give a damn what the rest of the world does. We're keeping 2A and our right to be responsible for our own safety.

@tinaleeinberlin @Tactical_review @j3mike @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa We're not interested in THEIR benefit. We're concerned with our own safety.
@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Tactical_review @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Exactly. He "might" become a criminal, therefore he should be treated like one.	She can go pound sand.
@Tactical_review @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa What she doesn't understand is that we don't give a damn what "the rest of the world" thinks. We carry for our defense, not theirs.
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray No "pretending" to it. You admitted it. Now get lost. If you need help, I can oblige. Our healthcare is none of your business. https://t.co/Ovl0seQcRw
@OpinionatedTool @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Again, those are facts. They are irrelevant to her. She has an agenda and a narrative.
@Tactical_review @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She has an agenda and a narrative to parrot. She couldn't care less about facts.

@Tactical_review @tinaleeinberlin @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @the_amish_txtr @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa Yep. And she doesn't give two shits about that. Fact be damned, she has her agenda. So what if a DV victim is a casualty in that war.
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray Our system? You are now dismissed. Clearly you don't live here and have no business sticking your nose in something you know nothing about.
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray Fiscally responsible states REFUSED to expand because federal subsidies ceased after 5 years and the cost would be borne by state taxpayers
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray Again, seniors and the disabled are on MEDICARE. SOME are subsidized by medicaid, which was not cut. Not all of them are. Learn to read.
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray There is no cut to medicaid. They didn't get the increase they wanted to support their fiscal irresponsibility and now have to answer for it
@Tactical_review @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She thinks your son is a criminal, too, so there's that to consider.
@Tactical_review @j3mike @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She still hasn't explained how her "new laws" will prevent criminals from obtaining guns.
@TimRandosaurus @PattyMurray The elderly and disabled are covered by Medicare, just as they always were. Children of parents who refuse to support them are on Medicaid.
@tinaleeinberlin @Gr8JohnQPublic @Tactical_review @Tomfreeusa @LovesStangs2 @the_amish_txtr @ArtieRypple @BasedKielbasa There are no fucking loopholes. There is a three day wait to purchase a handgun. Why do you oppose DV victims defending themselves?

@GigaWalrus We don't care what you believe. We're paying treatment-prohibitive premiums/deductibles. We didn't bring you into this world. Pay your own.
@rosehelman1 We're done paying for your insurance at the expense of our families. Our premiums/deductibles will be reduced. Pay your own. We'll pay ours.

@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Straw purchases. Stolen during home invasion robbery. Stolen through gun store burglaries. Then sold to each other on the streets.
@Tactical_review @tinaleeinberlin @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She's the poster child for why the left can never again be allowed to hold government office. 2018 needs to see more of them gone.

@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 She does not. She can't think of a single way that criminals obtain guns other than buying them.
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 FEDERAL LAW requires the background check. State laws are moot. FEDERAL LAW requires it. That includes online, and gun shows. Good grief.

@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 You absolutely do. Law-abiding gun owners already follow laws. Criminals do not and will obtain guns through ILLEGAL means such as theft.
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Then stop targeting law-abiding citizens with more laws, that criminals will not obey. Address the criminal element.
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Federal law requires background checks. No states are exempt. Do learn what you're talking about.

@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Law-abiding citizens already obey the law. Why do you refuse to address the criminal element? Are you incapable of telling the difference?
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 There isn't one to close. How do you "close" something that doesn't exist? Explain that.
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Yet you refuse to address the criminal element. Why is that? Are you ignorant of straw purchases? Gun thefts? Home invasion robberies?
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @j3mike @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Yet that's exactly how society is divided. Your ignorance of that is your own issue to resolve. Law-abiding gun owners are not criminals.

@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 There is no loophole. Your ignorance of the difference between dealer purchase and private party sale doesn't mean there's a loophole.

@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 There are already restrictions on gun purchases. You're ignorance of that doesn't meant those restrictions don't exist.
@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Yes, you are. Either that, or you've assigned yourself the lofty position of sole arbiter of how they may defend themselves.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Oh, honey. None of us would bring a real argument to you. You couldn't keep up, as evidenced by your inability to see the obvious here.
@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Law-abiding U.S. citizens terrify her. She should seek help with her irrational fears and stop trying to foist them on everyone else.
@OpinionatedTool @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @tinaleeinberlin @j3mike @TheSandmanSlim @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Thanks!
@wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @tinaleeinberlin @j3mike @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She's attempting to twist her claim that there's no difference between law-abiding citizens, and criminals. She doesn't know the difference.
@RemsmILL Evidently. Unbelievable ignorance.
@OpinionatedTool She is. She's the poster child for why we can never let the left be allowed into a position of government again. 2018 needs to see more gone

@tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @OpinionatedTool @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa This coming from someone who can't discern criminal from law-abiding citizens.
@tinaleeinberlin @OpinionatedTool @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa What's obvious is that you want everyone disarmed because you're afraid of U.S. citizens.
@BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Pissed in the bushes at Harvard. Claims she's a JD. Poor, delusional twit.
@OpinionatedTool @tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She's no lawyer. Guaranteed. Even the worst of the lawyers can discern criminal from law-abiding citizen or victim. She cannot.
@OpinionatedTool @tinaleeinberlin @wk9WUplvNgTbSX0 @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She's incapable of intelligent discussion. She doesn't even know the difference between a law-abiding citizen and a criminal. Waste of time.

@OpinionatedTool @tinaleeinberlin @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa She's assigned herself the lofty position of sole arbiter of how people should be allowed to defend themselves and who the criminals are.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @TheSandmanSlim @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @OpinionatedTool It's your ignorance and dishonesty that's offensive.

@OpinionatedTool @tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 She's avoiding the Kennesaw, GA question. It flies in the face of her narrative.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 And we'll defend ourselves how WE like. Just because YOU don't like how we do it, doesn't mean we don't have a right to. You're irrelevant.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 Poor pigeon. At least clean up your mess before you leave. 		Pathetic ignorance.

@tinaleeinberlin @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa There ARE two types of people. Owning a gun is not a crime. Self-defense is not a crime. How dare you call law-abiding citizens, criminals?

@tinaleeinberlin @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Criminals are those who would commit crimes against law-abiding people. Why are you opposed to law-abiding people defending themselves?
@tinaleeinberlin @OpinionatedTool @j3mike @Tactical_review @SeanQuigley87 @BasedKielbasa Why are you opposed to law-abiding gun owners defending themselves? Or, do you not know the difference between "law abiding" and "criminal"?

@RamiroSchaefer @TimOwensby @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA He asked you to cite U.S. code defining "assault rifle". Stop stalling and post it.
@RamiroSchaefer @TimOwensby @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA Incorrect. California legislators assigned the definition THEY wanted to "assault rifle". That is THEIR definition. https://t.co/yhTNjmq8wv
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @OpinionatedTool @SeanQuigley87 @Tactical_review Explain the online order and delivery process.

@RamiroSchaefer @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA You refuse to answer a question, then demand others answer yours? Really? No. You can stop stalling and answer his question.
@RamiroSchaefer @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA I didn't say I asked the question. Was it the word "his" that confused you? Please learn to read correctly. You're embarrassing yourself.
@RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA The "definition" states "semi-automatic, centerfire rifle". Please learn the meaning of "definition" before using it. You sound like a fool.
@RamiroSchaefer @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA What you mean is that you avoided his question in yet another tweet.
@RamiroSchaefer @HarryThetech76 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA More avoidance. That's unfortunate.
@HarryThetech76 @RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA Of course. He doesn't understand that they're one squeeze of the trigger, one bang just as handguns are. Completely ignorant.
@RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA I'm aware of it. It doesn't change the facts. They are semi-automatic rifles. Cosmetics doesn't change that.
@HarryThetech76 @RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA He can't because they're not. Crying "assault" like some overly-emotional, overly-dramatic twit doesn't make them any more deadly.
@RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA I see the word. Semi-automatic rifles aren't called "assault" any more than magazines are called "clips", by anyone but the most ignorant.
@RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA I see "assault-style". Again, you need to learn to read. This has already been addressed with you. Semi-automatic weapons were used.

@BeeSkinner @keithellison Sure, sure. Whatever you say. As I said, we're done paying for everyone at the expense of our own. Time for people to grow up.

@RamiroSchaefer @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @AK47fan_91 @a2p9979e10 @NRA No fallback. You seem to be struggling with simple English. You continue to refer to semi-automatic rifles as "assault rifles".

@RamiroSchaefer @AK47fan_91 @Tuffelhund2003 @KentHorton @a2p9979e10 @NRA There is not. Semi-automatic rifles are NOT called "assault rifles" just as magazines are not called "clips" except by the utterly ignorant.

@Stinkybarbie @Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout What annoys me is the arrogance of them, assuming we'd want to be "like them". We do not.

@Stinkybarbie @Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Exactly.
@Stinkybarbie @Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout They are, but most don't want to be bothered by that same gubment if the idiot they sell to, later commits a crime with it or has it stolen.

@Stinkybarbie @Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Yes she is. And no law-abiding handgun owner would sell to someone other than family without properly transferring ownership also.

@BasedKielbasa @tinaleeinberlin @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 She lives in Germany.  She's a propaganda parrot. She needs to turn off the TV westerns. LOL
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 Nobody claimed all sales were through dealers. Learn to read.
@BasedKielbasa @tinaleeinberlin @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 She lives in Germany. She's never been to a U.S. gun show.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 Incorrect again. Dealers are required to obtain ID and perform BGC at gun shows. No dealer will risk license, jail time by not doing it.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 There is no "gun show loophole". Again, stop trying to conflate private party sales with dealer sales. No dealer will risk FFL like that.
@tinaleeinberlin @BasedKielbasa @LovesStangs2 @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @redbudacres Good grief. You must think Americans are as stupid as Germans. NOBODY sells handguns to someone other than family w/o transferring ownership

Attention all #TN firearms dealers! You're no longer required to obtain ID to sell handguns. So sayeth the idiot @tinaleeinberlin, German. 😂
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Hurling lies doesn't make your claim any more valid. Nowhere in TN can you purchase a handgun from a FFL dealer, without ID and BGC.	Idiot.
@LovesStangs2 @tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Right? This ignorant twit has no clue what she's talking about.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout I'm aware of the difference between state and federal. Again, stop conflating private party sales with dealer sales.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout You are an utter moron and you are again attempting to conflate private party sales with dealer sales. Please learn the difference.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Yes, child. Clearly you do not. NOWHERE in Tennessee can you walk into a gun store and buy a handgun WITHOUT ID and background check.
@Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Yes it is. She's as stupid as the day is long.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Please show me in the FEDERAL law where a FFL dealer is permitted to sell a handgun without an ID and background check.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout You're a liar. Stop spreading outright lies about gun purchases in Tennessee.
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout Yet you said you weren't conflating private party and dealer sales, you ignorant twit. Yes. Dealer sales, which most are. Good grief.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout Do you think if you say it enough, it will be true? ID is ALWAYS required. Permits are no.. Learn the difference. You sound like a fool.
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout You're a liar. In EVERY state, an ID and background check is required by FEDERAL law, to purchase a handgun from a dealer.
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout Now you're just a liar attempting to perpetuate lies, and to those who have and will again, purchase and be required to show ID, to do so.
@tinaleeinberlin @Tomfreeusa @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout You're a misinformed twit. Federal law exempts NOT ONE of them. Learn the difference between "Permit", "ID", "Handgun", "Rifle", Shotgun".
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout ROFLMAO! You need to learn the difference between "permit" and "ID". Federal law exempts not a single one. 	Idiot.
@Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout She truly is dumb as a sack of hair.
@Tomfreeusa @tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @DarylArmentrout She's listening all states, not having a clue what she's talking about. It's hysterical!
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout Yes, they do. You need to learn the difference between "permit" and "ID".
@tinaleeinberlin @AK47fan_91 @LovesStangs2 @redbudacres @Tomfreeusa @DarylArmentrout You're a liar. You won't list them because EVERY state requires an ID and background check to purchase a handgun from a dealer.

@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro I'm sorry you never learned how to read properly. Perhaps you should do that, then re-read my comments and try again.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty That's rich after your repeated use of talking points and buzz words. Nevertheless, you were warned. Allow me to help you move on.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty Take your projection on down the road with your false equivalence nonsense. If you need help with that, let me know. I'll oblige.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty What we are, is not stupid. Time for others to step up and show us how serious they are about it, using THEIR money, not ours.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty You're wrong again, but I suspect that's a feeling you're used to. Take your false equivalence on down the road. You're done here.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty We were treating the planet better long ago. Let's see how serious the rest of the world is about this hoax without US taxpayers funding it.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty Was it the word "replication" that confused you?
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley "Selfish" is expecting others to pay for your insurance at the expense of their families. Our finances don't change based on your emotions.
@Athgar @GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley You are not.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty But...but it's a "settled science"! It's a theory, and nothing more. We're done funding the hoax.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley I'm aware of what it is. Again, the insurance industry didn't crawl into bed with the Obama administration to lose money. Fact. Deal with it
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley You poor, simple person. I don't benefit from paying your insurance. You benefit from tax-based services as well.	Pay your own insurance.
@ShanaJones8 @RepEsty Great! Show me where this "settled science" has been replicated even ONE time.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Again, we chose to control costs in November, when we voted to repeal Obamacare. We're done paying these extreme rates for ZERO treatment.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro Correct. No need anymore. Emergency hysterectomy pre-Obamacare. Covered by my superior policy.
@chrisrouse @michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro Oh, the drama! Cue the violins! But, Obamacare fixed all that, right? That's why we had to have these new policies, remember?	FFS.
@chrisrouse @michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro Great! Then if you're so concerned with those you claim to champion, you can pay their insurance out of your pocket voluntarily.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro Nope. It just lets them charge the working middle class triple to pay the difference between what you pay, and the cost of your premium.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Nothing you do helps my family. Now, we're putting our own families first. You're free to do the same, at your expense. Not ours.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Except, you're not paying your share. The working middle class pays the difference between what you pay and the actual cost of your premium.
@chrisrouse @michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro You're free to do just that if you can't afford yourself. We didn't bring you into this world. Your parents did. Let them step up.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley People can spend their own money to get insurance, too. We're done paying for yours and everyone else's at the expense of our families.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro I'm paying triple the cost for the same care I got before. I have no need of prostate or maternity. We're done "paying more for less".
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Do you not know the difference between local, state and federal taxes? Do you think roads didn't exist prior to government?
@chrisrouse @michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro And WE are the ones paying for those millions. The insurance companies didn't crawl into bed with the Obama administration to lose money.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro Evidently the taxpayers were supporting you? How is it you don't know what happened with the affordable policies?
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley We're controlling our costs right now. Repealing Obamacare will GREATLY benefit our bottom line. Perhaps we can afford treatment, even.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro The same thing that happened to EVERYONE's policies that didn't cover everything mandated by the law. It was cancelled, replaced. More $$$$$
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley They can do better or they can repeal it ONLY. If Dems keep obstructing with their ignorant, inflammatory rhetoric, that's what it'll be.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Miss me with buzzwords. You want insurance? Pay for it. The working middle class didn't bring you into this world. We have our own families.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Yes, there is. We're not going to tolerate being financially raped to pay for it all, and will vote them out if they enact a bill that does.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley And still it was far cheaper than #Obamacare. You can cry all you want, but our finances don't change based on your emotional drivel.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Yes there is. You pay your own insurance if you want insurance.	You should learn the difference between federal, state and local taxes, too.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley And by the time it was said and done, nothing that substantial that Republicans submitted remained except rendering the IRS toothless.
@michaelbelcher @chrisrouse @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro You can't be this stupid. Yes and yes. We had coverage that worked for us, and was affordable, just as most of the working middle class did.
@ChrisVanHollen The same CBO that was grossly inaccurate when scoring #Obamacare, correct?	You'll understand why we can't take their math claims seriously

@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Good grief. Another one. "Uninsured" does not necessarily mean "indigent". Do learn what you're talking about. And again, not one GOP vote.
@chrisrouse @michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro They were not. My insurance was less than half the cost, premium and deductible. Try again.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley It was not. Not even one Republican voted for it. Do take your own advice. The vote is there for all to see, including you.
@thegamesahead @ChrisVanHollen There are also middle class retirees.
@GrayMattersTwit @SenJeffMerkley Fascinating! That's the same excuse used by the left to enact Obamacare, which increased our costs exponentially.	Some never learn, I guess.
@idlegiles @repcleaver So what you're saying is you're low-skilled and can't afford yourself. Guess you better work on improving your skills and value.
@here_mel @sassylibrarian1 @ChrisMurphyCT Do you think our finances change based on your emotional drivel? We're done paying for everyone at the expense of our own families.

@michaelbelcher @nashvilledems @TopherSpiro With repeal, those who are paying $2K premiums and $15K deductibles (middle class) might be able to afford policies that allow treatment.

@ProfoundlyRatio @kylegriffin1 @TheDemocrats Correction. My apology. Yes. They had to correct the misinformation they were disseminating. Again.
@davieyo @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 If he's incorrect, speak up. I'm sure you can cite the law disproving his claim, correct?
@TonyHealy4 @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 You say you have self-control issues? I'm sorry. Perhaps scrolling on past like an adult, or blocking, would alleviate your discomfort.
@ProfoundlyRatio @kylegriffin1 @TheDemocrats It's at the bottom of a story the published two or three days ago.
@MosesDidItBest @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 You are now dismissed. I have zero tolerance for race-peddlers.
@michgirlindc @pamwye @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 And again, you may desperately cling to your "Mueller" hope all you want. It will get you nowhere because it will go nowhere.
@creich23 @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 Again, it is NOT a crime to obtain information about your opponent. You may cling to the hope that it is all you want. 		Run along.
@michgirlindc @pamwye @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 It wasn't a crime. Mueller can do nothing with it. You're free to cling to that hope you have, however.
@creich23 @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 Again, if obtaining negative information about your opponent was a crime, they'd all be guilty. See also: Negative ads every election.
@creich23 @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 There's no crime in obtaining information about your opponent. If there was, Hillary and every other politician would be equally guilty.
@JWal077 @kylegriffin1 And? There's no crime in it. Good grief.
@michgirlindc @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 Furthermore, "adoptions" was her goal, not her stated intent.
@michgirlindc @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 That is your interpretation. She failed to get the adoption "restart" that she wanted, and was told why.
@JWal077 @kylegriffin1 What part of what I posted was unclear? Not a crime? Nothing of value was received, or promised. You're free to hang onto hope all you want.
@mariaso1200 @kylegriffin1 No spin. Just facts. I'm sorry you're incapable of recognizing them. Feel free to run along and wallow in the #TrumpRussia narrative.
@pamwye @JWal077 @kylegriffin1 Try again.		https://t.co/FxmtO3ziCK https://t.co/m1o6QXjpmh
@JWal077 @kylegriffin1 Try again. Nothing of value was promised, or received.		https://t.co/FxmtO3ziCK https://t.co/AOUz7yf4A9
@JWal077 @kylegriffin1 No, child. It is not. Please learn what you're talking about.
@therealrchapman @ananavarro I'm sorry your lack of emotional control is such that you feel the need to silence those who hold a differing opinion. Feel free to block.
@ananavarro I'm sure you know all about "johns".
@JWal077 @kylegriffin1 There's no crime in meeting with ANYONE to obtain information about your opponent. She didn't get the adoption resolution she'd hoped for.
RT @mitchellvii: Hero Freedom Caucus Leader Threatens Government Shutdown Over Border Wall Funding https://t.co/0hE30e8tND
@kylegriffin1 LMAO! Of course she does. She didn't get the adoption resolution she was hoping for. She must be a nobody attorney if no ties to Kremlin.
@ProfoundlyRatio @kylegriffin1 @TheDemocrats You mean, the NYT story that it printed a retraction on, that everyone seems to have (conveniently) missed? That "happened"?		Spare me.
@ProfoundlyRatio @kylegriffin1 @TheDemocrats Yes. Fully fabricated. It's how they consoled themselves over the loss of an election they thought they had in the bag. And you bought it.
@Charmed0504 @kylegriffin1 Anyone can obtain voter information. I misinterpreted nothing. Blue states are vehemently opposed to safeguarding election integrity.
@kylegriffin1 Perhaps if @TheDemocrats spent more time working than crying about their fabricated #TrumpRussia narrative, they'd confirm more.
@ananavarro Nothing more guano demented than you're capable of, I'm sure.
@kkaliszewski @kylegriffin1 Run along.
@kkaliszewski @Charmed0504 @kylegriffin1 I love the "voter suppression" cry. Anyone can get voter information. Blue states oppose safeguarding election integrity.
@JatikaSpeaks @kylegriffin1 It's absolutely about having something to hide. Anyone can obtain voter info. All blue states who oppose safeguarding election integrity.

@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump The only thing she should be doing is abolishing DoE and returning education to state and local level, where it belongs.
@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump Regardless of who he picks, they can't block it. They haven't got the numbers. It's pure obstruction just to obstruct. See also: Schumer.

@Charmed0504 @kylegriffin1 Those who are refusing to turn over their voter information, specifically. It's been all over the news. Not sure how you missed it.
@kylegriffin1 By that you mean "some" state election officials. Specifically, those with something to hide.

@KurtSchlichter Notice, no email provided in support of their claim.
@mtracey By concentrating on non-issues, @TheDemocrats can avoid the real issues and the working middle class whom they haven't represented in years.
Sadly, @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats are complete strangers to the truth, preferring to sow seeds of contention and distrust.	#TrumpRussia https://t.co/ffhi7cTE3l

@kylegriffin1 Repeal ONLY! We're not interested in replacing or fixing something that was enacted to fail anyway. We're done paying others' insurance.
@JoyAnnReid Bless your heart, either you (conveniently) missed the NYT retraction, or you're intentionally perpetuating a lie. Which is it?
Prayers for all.  Terribly tragic. https://t.co/ki2VSZv0rK
@RepHanabusa Evidently you missed the tiny little NYT retraction as well. Or are you just dishonest and perpetuating lies?	#FollowTheFacts	#TrumpRussia
@BlackTopMediaUK @Tactical_review @beelzebubsbong @Biastai Wrong on both. Perhaps you should concern yourself with matters in your own country, and not ours. You'll save yourself some embarrassment.
@seenom @RepGaramendi @11thHour Someone should let @RepGaramendi know to look harder for that retraction from NYT on the Russian meeting story. Evidently he missed it.
@kylegriffin1 @maddow Why didn't @RepAdamSchiff address @TheDemocrats' reasons for refusing to address Russian hacking in 2016?	That meeting was about adoptions.
@tedlieu Wow! A tweet by you about something other than Trump. Still nothing about work, however. When will you start working?
@Laura5871 @JamieTuberville @marcseidenberg @SenateGOP Great! Pay it out of YOUR pocket voluntarily. The rest of us are fed up struggling to support the entire nation out of ours.
@Laura5871 @JamieTuberville @marcseidenberg @SenateGOP Yes we can say that. The ins industry didn't crawl into bed w/the Obama administration to lose money. Taxpayers are paying that difference.
@marcseidenberg @SenateGOP The reason costs are reasonable to you is WMC taxpayers are paying the difference between the actual cost of your premium and what you pay.
