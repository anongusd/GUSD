@gishwhes jump into a bucket of paint then throw yourself at a canvas.
@XboxSupport Can we get SOME KIND of update other than "We're aware of the issue?" FFS it's been SIX HOURS!
@XboxSupport @NickSforza Why do you keep telling us to get updates when there are no updates?! It's been six hours and not a single change.
@XboxSupport Sixth hour of not being able to play games I payed for! Without a WORD about whether or not it will get fixed before 2017.
@Xbox @XboxSupport I literally can't play games I"ve already payed for. This is great customer service. Bravo, guys.
@Xbox @XboxSupport where we're aware of the problem, we just don't care about it.
@XboxSupport Except you don't get updates. No ETA. Just 'we're aware of the issue. We might have it fixed before june. Maybe."
@Xboxsupport: "How much longer, guys? People are getting upset."	@Xbox engineers: "FUCK IF WE KNOW!"
@XboxSupport This is absolutely unacceptable. SIX HOURS!? ANd no end in sight? This is what we pay a monthly subscription for?
@XboxSupport @MrPembridge Constantly saying "We are aware of the issue" without giving us an ETA is poor customer service.
@Soizit_Blindy Yes. It's really quite stupid. How is it that I can't play a game I've been playing for weeks?
@XboxSupport THis is not helpful. It's been five hours. How do you not even have an ETA yet? You can't be this inept.
@Soizit_Blindy And I only have a few hours to get through trials and I've been working all weekend and now I'm getting screwed.
@Soizit_Blindy Yeah that's my issue. I can get INTO destiny, but I can't do ANYTHING because all the PVP and stuff isn't available.
I can get on fine. It's saying my DLC isn't registered and I can't play any of the game because It thinks I don't have the DLC which I do.
RT @CommonManDZ: COME ON @XBOX NOT AGAIN https://t.co/xLpEmkRARo
@Soizit_Blindy when I had a 360, it was great, I will admit that. But I've had my Xb1 since Christmas and haven't had a single smooth week.
@XboxSupport @bieksha_kyle This is not an answer! It's been HOURS! How do you not have an ETA?!
@Soizit_Blindy @XboxSupport have had nothing but problems since I got @Xbox on christmas. Haven't had three days together that were smooth.
@XboxSupport I have been paying for Xboxlive for TOO long for you guys to screw up the only time I NEED YOU to come through. F this.
@XboxSupport I've had an @Xbox for two months now and have only been able to play it for about one month because you're always down.
@Xbox @XboxSupport are you somehow going to surprise us all with a more expensive version of Xboxlive that ACTUALLY works or...?
@XboxSupport Why are only SOME of us effected by this? Why is literally EVERYONE I KNOW able to log on?
@XboxSupport @RUSK81 How can a million dollar corporation not know how to fix their own stuff? Blizzard would have had this fixed in an hour
@XboxSupport Do you have any time table as to when I'll be able to access the content i bought and paid for MONTHS ago?! It's been hours!
@LizShattler Wait, that's not you?
@feliciaday That's what happens when you're eating a bowl of fart. I hate salads.
@JensenAckles your grumpy dad face abilities are unrivaled.
@RobBenedict I was one of the callers (Maggie) and you are such a gentleman and class act for how you handled what they said. Stay strong.
@RobBenedict Sorry they were such jerks. Maybe you're not the best singer in the world, but you give me hope. Glad I got to vote. &lt;3
@LoudenSwain1 Sorry they were such jerks, wow. We love you guys.
@RobBenedict I listen to @LoudenSwain1 because it makes me feel like maybe the world doesn't suck all the time. It's hope. It's love.
@LoudenSwain1 @955KLOS @heidiandfrank @RobBenedict Sorry they were A-holes, Rob. Stay strong, brother.
I was 1 of the votes for @LoudenSwain1 2 stay (maggie) and @RobBenedict is such a class act for how he handled the rude things said to him.
@VancityReynolds If you say 'Rise up lights' in an American accent you're saying "Razor Blades" in an Australian accent. YOU'RE WELCOME.
Well I can keep crying in my car or I can blow my nose and do my job. I know what Snape would be telling me.

@JensenAckles @jarpad Excuse me, who is this muppet and why is he talking to me?
@SuperWiki @jarpad @jennydelherpes Holy moly. @dicksp8jr is about to impart some age old wisdom...but he's gonna mumble it all.
@mishacollins @OsricChau I've definitely seen this porn before.

Just curious, what do y'all do when you see something that screws you up for a while? #AKF #SPNFAMILY @Jarpad been a rough week I guess.
@OsricChau @OfficialBrianaB You and she should battle for the title in an arena of kittens.
@OfficialBrianaB Jealous.
@bodyguard4JandJ @SPNFanMovie Been a long time since we saw a good old fashioned spirit burning.
Is it just me or does sam get knocked out a lot in this season? #Supernatural @jarpad

@colindonnell You are definitely a very good sayer of words.
@hankgreen How do you get the courage to keep making videos? There's so much hatred on the internet it's terrifying.
Literally just used my shirt to hold a guy's head together after an accident. Go hold your family. Tell people you love them. #AKF
@donttrythis First row of that back section on the left! this one was harder because there wasn't a giant group of people looking at him.
@RobBenedict like herpes!
@jarpad @RobBenedict stealing people's phones again?
Watching #spn bloopers because I can't just sit here and cry all night
@jarpad France and her people are strong. This is so, so sad. It makes you just hate the world.
Stay strong, stay safe, help each other. I'm so, so sorry. #prayforparis
Here's one hell of a #TBT for y'all. Good lord. https://t.co/irEipvNwLN
@JensenAckles Is it weird having to pretend there's sexual tension with a teenager? That totally weirded me out.
@jarpad @JensenAckles OH god I hope he's not soulless. plzplzplz

@gogreen18 Where you going?
@jarpad I wish it came in long sleeves!!
@JensenAckles Certainly made my day a little brighter. I wish I had this much fun at work.

@jarpad Can I just say that your hair is like ON POINT this season.
@bodyguard4JandJ @SPNFanMovie They look thrashed.
@JensenAckles @mishacollins had to have been hella awkward. "Okay can you uh... be more... uhm... like... alright you know what? perfect."
@mishacollins @JensenAckles Holy shit I didn't even think about that.
@TheJimMichaels That's what she said!
@JensenAckles #fortunenookie apparently sets you free in this case. Where the hell is Cas?
I freaking love when @JensenAckles directs. #ActionAckles is my favorite director. Just the transitions alone!
@jarpad @mishacollins What are you a 1940's mob boss? "Youse, itches, getoutahere."
@JensenAckles You are one smooth mo-fo sir. Reverse purse-toss with a wink and a smile. I wish I had half that smooth.
@mishacollins I think the captain needs a new FACE!
@TheJimMichaels GOOD! KEEP IT THAT WAY!
@JensenAckles love the dynamic between the 3 of them, honestly. Love when they work together even if no actual work gets done #Actionackles
