The funny thing is, people believed him because my great-grandfather Jimmy was one of those honest and trustworthy men that fought in the wars, and knew what they were talking about, and whatever they said was gold. My granddaddy got that from Jimmy.
I have a pretty funny story I'd like to share with my Twitter family. My great-grandfather was in WW1 and WW2. He was a spy for the Nazis in WW2, and he would tell people at parties that my granddaddy had a submarine that he would use to run moonshine up and down the river.

I don't even know what triggers these memories anymore. I was literally just browsing Facebook/Twitter, and suddenly, all that bullshit popped back into my head. Why?!
How long until these damn memories of the horrible things he did to me, and our animals, fully go away, and the memories stop creeping up on me like this? When will I fully be free, and not want to call him out, and "start shit" all over again? I just want to fully be free.
I'm dealing with that right now with my abusive ex. He does gaming shit on Youtube, and I haven't thought about him much since I left in 2014, but the things he's done to me, and our animals, still haunts me, and when I happen to think about it, I get so angry all over again.
Do you ever dislike someone so much, but you rarely ever think of them anymore because it upsets you so, and you've moved on, but occasionally, they pop back up in your mind, and everything they're now doing with their life just pisses you off because you know who they truly are?

@MSNBC @hardball First, play the entire clip of Holder. He said "kick them" not literally, but figuratively. Also, comparing "getting in someone's face", and sending someone pipe bombs isn't the same. And, everyone condemned the shooting, but they're still chanting "Lock Her Up."
@SparkleBlue9 @MSNBC @CNN @ABC I know. It's bullshit that they decided not to report on what happened, but at the same time, I'm torn because they're still journalists, ya know? I guess it boils down to knowing they're doing a job, and shouldn't be harmed, but they should do the job better? Make sense?
@SparkleBlue9 @MSNBC @CNN @ABC Even though I disagree with how Fox runs their shows, they're still part of the media, and their journalists still put everything into their work. You can disagree with someone, especially the media, and still support the fact that they have the freedom of the press.
The media/journalists are NOT the enemies. They're doing their jobs, and they're doing an amazing job. They're under attack, and it is up to us to support them. I will always support them for the work they do. They are putting their lives on the line. They deserve respect.
I know many people are upset that @MSNBC @CNN @ABC etc are still reporting on the President, and still showing his speeches (other than rallies), but the thing is, they're the news. They have to cover the President of the United States. We have to support these journalists/media.

10 American lives were lost yesterday. #POTUS, please end the violence. #BackfireTrump https://t.co/U2uR4n2tQM
What I'm getting at is, if they claim the fetus is a person in the womb, why would it not be a person outside the womb? It's not "their" decision to not vax because it's not their body. That's their argument against abortion, right? "Not just your body." #HypocrisyAtItsFinest
I just thought of something. Why is it that the people who are "pro-life" and "anti-vax" say "The baby is a person, and has rights.", but when it's born, those people claim it's "Their choice for their kids." If the baby has rights as a fetus, doesn't it have rights as a child?

@Caese_Rulez @joanneD2505 @misterbumface You'd think we'd get rid of it already, but looking at the news, seeing what's happening, and the fact that I fully believe this country is more progressive than it seems, it makes sense why certain people are hanging onto the EC with a death grip.

@KellenDunk @Mimothekitten @indiancarol @SparkleBlue9 @joanneD2505 @misterbumface It just doesn't make sense to me to have an Electoral College that decides who wins &amp; a Popular Vote that doesn't seem to matter.

These are my thoughts on the voting system we have in this country. What do you think? #SundayMorning #Vote https://t.co/17nHPuvy30
@Mimothekitten @indiancarol @SparkleBlue9 @joanneD2505 @misterbumface The only reason I can think of as to why it's so complicated is because the US is a progressive country, and we're wanting to continue to move forward, and too many people in power want to keep us held back, so they keep the system flawed and corrupt to keep the power and money.
@Mimothekitten @indiancarol @SparkleBlue9 @joanneD2505 @misterbumface Like, I don't understand why we're having to make it so difficult in this country. The Government could register everyone (based on social security numbers), send it to everyone, let us vote, and do it that way. Simple. Why make it so complicated?
@Mimothekitten @indiancarol @SparkleBlue9 @joanneD2505 @misterbumface I would think, logically, we should just do what other countries do (what others were saying). Have the cards arrive in the mail, and either bring it to the ballot office, check who you want, and be done, or check who you want and mail it in, and base who wins based on the votes.

@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation But...okay. Here's a long list. Simple Google Search of Trump President Scandals:		https://t.co/ioozGMCpW4
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation So, I'm supposed to automatically know every Obama scandal otherwise I'm stupid and don't pay attention, but I'm having to list everything that Trump has done, and if I don't I'm deflecting? You're on Twitter. You should know what's happening. I'm sure you watch the news.
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation Do...do you not understand what a joke is? As in, Titus was replying to someone else, asking them to list the scandals, and me and others posted those joke scandals as to say "Yeah. Latte Gate and Dijon Mustard and Tan Suit." Like...I shouldn't have to explain this. Wtf?
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation Matter of fact, I don't think this conversation is going to go anywhere other than both of us pissing each other off, and I don't want to do that, so I'm just gonna go ahead and bid you a good day. I do hope you have a good day. Truly.
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation I honestly don't care at this point because you're not paying attention to anything I've been saying to you.
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation people like you just can not admit that Trump has done, and is currently, doing horrible shit, but constantly love bringing up Obama and/or Hillary is fucking annoying. Obama and Hillary are not President. Trump is. Fucking pay attention, &amp; admit that maybe something isn't right!
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation Okay. Again, I'm going to make this really simple. I'm not stupid. I  know that no White House is scandal free. I also know what the scandals  Obama did, but, and here's the thing, really none of these compare to  all the bullshit Trump is currently doing. The fact that so many
@FiendVinny @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation And I knew it. You say we're essentially stupid for "ignoring" Obama's "scandals", and yet you're doing the exact same thing with Trump. Yeah. You can't call us hypocrites without being a hypocrite yourself. So, have a great day.
@FiendVinny @Seylahvee @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation Called it.

@Seylahvee @FiendVinny @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My guess is he's gonna tell us that we should look it up for ourselves, or we should already know it by now, or we're brainwashed liberal sheeple or something along those lines.
@FiendVinny @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation I'm not disputing anything Obama might have done, and never said he didn't do them. I'm simply saying that if you think what Obama did was horrible, then you should be even more outraged at what Trump is doing. It really is that simple.
@FiendVinny @hermanjmills @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation I think it boils down to the fact that people like you are still on about Obama and/or Hillary, when neither of them are the current President, and considering what the current President has done, and is doing, is beyond anything anyone else might have/did do. That's the point.
@hermanjmills @FiendVinny @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation https://t.co/V8CGkaXKGW
@hermanjmills @FiendVinny @Otaku_Driver @TitusNation It's funny, because if they're so concerned about Obama's "scandals", then you'd think they'd be terrified/pissed off at the crap Trump is doing/has done.
And yet we're (Dems) the ones who are the "angry mob", and don't have "civility"? Wow. https://t.co/F9tArgC9FV

RT @mkraju: Here are his comments: https://t.co/8le6IRqgPO
There absolutely needs to be an age limit, and if they won't implement one, we need to stick to an age limit. Stop electing and re-electing these people past, say, 65. If we want to move forward as a country, we need to elect young people to Government, and stick with it.
It honestly makes me wonder, is their lust for money and power so great that they will stay in Government when they have no business being there? They don't remember what it's like living on minimum wage, or any other regular things. They don't understand. Why allow them to stay?
One thing that has always bothered me with politicians is their age. Only reason I say this is my grandmother passed when she was 80, but so many in Government are around her age, and even she said that people her age need to step aside, because they have no business being there.

Omg. McConnell. Kavanaugh didn't just "throw ice" in a bar in the 1980's. He threw ice AT another person, and Kavanaugh's friend hit the victim in the ear with a glass, causing dude's ear to bleed. The police were called, and a police report was filed. "Assault" was written down.
I'm just gonna say it. I'm so incredibly tired of partisanship. I want to see compromise. I want to see members of our Government practicing bipartisanship again. Conversations need to happen again. Understanding. Listening. Why can't we do that anymore? What is even happening?

@RisingAsch @LanchestersCube The biggest issue is no one wants to take blame for anything wrong with this country. It's always somebody elses fault. The right blames the left for everything, and the left blames the right for everything. No one in this country is listening or helping each other anymore.
@MikeJon12797095 If I liked drinking, I probably would. I've never really been a big drinker though, and since I haven't really drank a lot over the years, I have a low tolerance. Plus my meds keep me from being able to drink too, which sucks.
@e2pilot There really is a lot more to why I'm angry than just politics. Like I've been saying. This has been building up for years, and it's just boiled over, so I'm just constantly angry now. At everything. Not just politics.
@LanchestersCube @RisingAsch It's strange b/c I just want progress in the country. To move forward. Not stay the same or go backwards. I really don't care if it's right or left who moves us forward. I don't think it should ever be a right vs. left in this country. We should work together to move forward.
@2ndAmendLawyer I pretty much did that last night to now. Just stopped social media, news, etc, and it really helped. Usually does, but there's just so much going on in my life that just makes me so upset, and I think I get angry b/c I'm mad @ myself for being upset over things I can't control.
@raineybuck420 @AntCar0123 Deaths, break-ups, straight up depression, being bipolar, having numerous other medical issues, money issues, disability issues, wondering if I can afford my medications, wondering if I can eat this month. It just all boiled over over the past couple months, and the anger stays.
@raineybuck420 @AntCar0123 I really do appreciate it. Same thing goes for you. I might not always know how to "fix" things, but I can, and will, listen. Personally, this entire thread, in my opinion, got out of hand. Too many people assume it's all politically motivated, but this has been going for years.
@raineybuck420 @AntCar0123 It does help to actually talk about it though. I didn't expect this tweet to get this much attention, but maybe that's a good thing, since this is helping me to actually talk about these things instead of holding it all inside. So who knows? There's only so much I can do.
@raineybuck420 @AntCar0123 I do think. Too much is out of my control, but all the things out of my control are effecting my life, and mostly in negative ways, and there's quite literally, nothing I can do about it, but wait. Like I said, this has been building for years, and it's just all came to a head.
@raineybuck420 @AntCar0123 I understand what you're saying, and I am happy that that works for you. Whatever works, right? :) But yeah, it unfortunately doesn't work like that for me. My other mental and physical issues along with medical and other problems that are out of my control are really the problem

@RisingAsch I mean, again, speaking only for me, there's just so many things that just scream "common sense", and yet, it's not being done, and it just doesn't make any sense to me at all. I learned first day of CJ classes to see things from both sides, but that doesn't mean I understand it.
@RisingAsch They were still having to use paper records for gun sales, and during Katrina, they had to dry out all the records they could find that weren't destroyed, because they were not allowed to digitize them. Why did that take so long, if it's been done already?
@RisingAsch I will admit that I haven't looked into the CDC being able to investigate gun activity since a couple months ago, so I will admit it could have changed, but even if it did, why did it just now change? Also, last I researched, gun records were not digitized yet.
@RisingAsch everything else is already outrageously expensive? It makes zero sense that only certain people can afford certain things because everything is so expensive, and no ones making enough money. People shouldn't have to work 2/3/4 jobs to live bare minimum/month to month.
@RisingAsch The thing I learned in my economics class is that economics is anything but simple. Lol. Same with trade. It's so complex, and you got people who do those things for a living who are still learning something new every day. But how can raising wages offset anything, when
@RisingAsch I love talking to people, especially people who disagree with me, because we're having a conversation. We're getting the talking started. It's amazing to me to discuss these things with one another. I get what you're saying, but I, personally, just want more for my country. /end
@RisingAsch Other countries are doing so much for everyone else in their country. Schools are better. Healthcare is better. Their citizens are taken care of, and they look out for one another. Why shouldn't we want that for this country? I love this country, and want to see it succeed. /8
@RisingAsch should have to live like this, and I'm not alone. Think of the veterans/military/elderly/worse disabled people than me picking and choosing whether they want to get their medications or eat every month. It's not right. Not when this country has people who make millions/billions/7
@RisingAsch I was in college for Criminal Justice. I was going to do something with my life, and now I don't know if I'll ever be able to get my degree. I can't work, but my disability has stayed the same for about 4 years now, while everything else has gone up. $700 a month. No one /6
@RisingAsch but wages have stayed the same. How would raising the wages do any harm? We could at least talk about it. Same goes with health care. So many people are already on Medicare/Medicaid. I'm one of them. I almost died in 2007, and have been on disability since 2009. I'm 33 y/o. /5
@RisingAsch Because the way I see it, the only way we will ever progress as a country is if we continue to move forward, not staying the same, and surely not going backwards. Progress has to move forward. Why would raising minimum wage be a bad thing? Everything else has increased /4
@RisingAsch gun deaths. Why? I want an actual conversation to happen. I don't want guns taken away, but we should at least talk about what could maybe change to try to make things better, because if we don't try to change things, nothing will ever get better. /3
@RisingAsch gotten better. Everything has been getting worse over the years. I can't, and won't, speak for anyone else but myself, but I don't want to disarm anyone, but I would like certain common sense things to change, not just with guns, but with everything. CDC can't even investigate /2
@RisingAsch Thing is, I don't believe, personally, any of that. I understand, and respect, you have your own beliefs/opinions, just like I have mine, but that's not at all what I believe, nor what I believe will work. We've tried it that way for way too long, and nothing has /1
@DebbieRexroat It's not really one person or group or anything like that. It's just a combination of everything over the past several years. It's been building up for awhile. My mom, for example, is constantly sad/crying, and I'm constantly angry. It'll get better, but it sucks now. üíú
Also, I should add that it's not just political things that are causing me to be angry all the time. This started years ago, and has built up over time. I keep things to myself, and am trying to learn to deal with everything going on in my life. üíú
@LShrug See other reply.
@RisingAsch 1) I have tried understanding the other side (GOP) for years, way before this admin, and I just can't. I don't think like a machine, and I can't just blindly accept things that are just wrong on all levels. 2) I am getting help, but that doesn't mean I'm not still angry.
@AntCar0123 I have other issues going on that has absolutely nothing to do with politics, as I know other people have as well, and I think the fact that everyone is so divided, and I just feel alone because of reasons, everything just comes to a head, and I just stay angry. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è /end
@AntCar0123 really listen to one another anymore. Not just listen to reply, but listen to understand. Also, opinions/beliefs are wonderful things to have, but once you try to push opinions/beliefs onto other people as facts, that's when it becomes a problem. Too much of that happening. /3
@AntCar0123 but I can only explain the same thing so many times, repeatedly, with the other person refusing to actually listen and understand before I actually give up trying, because at that point, there is no point. I think one of the reasons I'm so angry is because no one seems to be /2
@AntCar0123 I don't intend to "attack" you. That's not the type of person I like to be. Hell, I don't even block people when they come after me. I just hate confrontation and fighting, so I just do what I can to ignore it. I do what I can to understand and try to see everyone elses views /1
#ImNotOkayBecause I'm so angry all the time now, and I have no idea why. I hate being so angry. I want it to stop. I want the old me back. I want to smile and laugh and enjoy my life again. I don't want to hate everyone/everything every single day anymore. I don't know what to do

@MSNBC Makes a GREAT point! Just imagine if #DrFord came into this hearing, and screamed and was ranting/raving like #Kavanaugh was. She would be deemed #hysterical and would have been taken out, and the hearing would have been over. #KavanaughHearings #LetTheFBIInvestigate
Okay, so #Grassley saying that the FBI doesn't "reach a conclusion", then they shouldn't investigate anything? Just forget them? Why not just disband the FBI then? What good do they do if you claim they "don't reach a conclusion"? They get to the damn truth! Does that not count?!
@GeorgeTakei No f'n way. Hell no.
I was going going to college for Criminal Justice, and what #GOP and #Kavanaugh don't understand is when the FBI investigate, it's a different setting and they know the lying cues. #LetTheFBIInvestigate #KavanaughHearings #KavanaughIsLying
@CSquaredNBA Honestly, at this point, I don't think the GOP care at all anymore. I think they're all showing their true colors for whatever reason, and they just don't care. I think they'll vote "Yes" because they don't care anymore. It's terrifying and horrible and I'm embarrassed for them.
I know a lot of people are saying that they have dirt on #LindseyGraham and/or others, but honestly, I don't think they do. I think that these old, rich, white men are finally showing their true colors, and this is how they've always been, and always thought. #KavanaughHearings
@LindseyGrahamSC YOU. People like YOU are the reason why women do NOT report! YOU would be the person who defends MY child molester! SHAME ON YOU! YOU are the problem! #WhyIDidntReport

I AM judging you by that standard, you privileged fuck! #KavanaughHearings
I wouldn't trust him around those little girls he coaches. Just sayin'.
I need to express that just because you say "god", go to "church", &amp; claim "christianity", it means shit. The man/monster who sexually molested me as a child was called a "good, decent, Christian" &amp; praised for going to a building every Sunday. Means fuck all.
He's still claiming he was a virgin? Seriously? Also, that sniffling is annoying as hell. Take a minute to blow your nose. Damn.
Okay, seriously, what's with his obsession with drinking all that water every 5 minutes? I'm a very thirsty person too, but I don't need water every 5 minites. Wtf? #KavanaughHearings
Notice Kavanaugh only "cries" when talking about his kids or parents. He's trying way too hard to get sympathy, and it's not working on me. #KavanaughHearings
@timmyturmoil I agree. Hate is such a strong and ugly word. I hate one person, and that's the monster who sexually molested me as a child. Everyone else I dislike. Not hate. Too much pain and energy to hate so much, so it just goes to that one man.
No one buys the crying bullshit, Kavanaugh. Shut up. Privileged, rich, little, white boy is finally having to answer for his crimes. Granted, he's not answering for them enough by far, but still. If you didn't treat women like shit, this wouldn't happen. #KavanaughHearings

With them talking about remembering certain things clearly and others not clearly, I can say that's so true. My first ever memory is being on my babysitters bed, and him doing "something", and I looked at the ceiling, then looked towards the wall, and thought, "I wanna watch TV."
Wtf does her fear of flying have to do with anything?! I have a fear of flying! I freak out every single damn time I have gotten on a plane, but I did it because I HAD TO! WTF?! #DrBlaseyFord

Grassley needs to watch his damn tone, or better yet. Just shut up. You haven't DONE SHIT! Your staff investigating isn't the same as a damn FBI investigation!
I have a problem when it comes to something being embarrassing or hard to watch, I can't because I get ashamed or embarrassed for the people going through it, and watching Dr. Ford being interrogated, I'm having a very hard time. I feel like I'm being victimized again. I can't.

Explanation: Alcohol doesn't make men hit women. A man hits a woman because he WANTS to, regardless if he's drunk or not. Men use "I was drunk" as an excuse. A way to "get away with" hitting a woman, but alcohol doesn't make a man do something he hasn't already done/wouldn't do.
Alcohol is a central theme here, and let me be clear. I "dated" a guy who was a mean alcoholic. He threw things, yelled, screamed, cried every single time he got drunk, but he NEVER hit me. He was horrible and mean, but again, he NEVER hit me. Alcohol does NOT make men hit women.

I know this is how "Christians" are everywhere in the U.S, but it's especially bad here in Alabama. Hence #WhyIDidntReport 	I'm an Atheist, and my abusers were "good Christian men". Who the hell would believe me here? https://t.co/l2kLgHoIqC
I feel the need to clarify that I only told my mom through letter, and if she asked any questions, I would straight up deny, and to set my point about everyone loving them, the dad recently died, and so many "he was such a good man/Christian" flooded the post about his death.
It started when I was 2. My first memory is being on the bed. I was 5 when his son started with me. I was 12 when they caught the son w/ me. I was 17 when I said something about the dad because of a wedding invite. Everyone loved them. Why would they believe me? #WhyIDidntReport

They can't hurt me anymore, so I, seriously, have no one else to hate, nor do I want to hate anyone else. I need to be told things are going to be okay, and to tell others that, and being so alone hurts my heart and soul so much. I know I'm not alone, and neither are you.
I want to talk to everyone, and get to know everyone. I want to know people care about me like I care about them. I, literally, only hate one person, and that person was an evil and horrible monster who did evil and horrible things to me, but they're dead.
It upsets me so much, because it seriously makes me feel like no one gives a shit at all. I know I've very opinionated about how I see things, and how I think things should be, and I know it comes off as though I don't want to get to know someone, but that's not the case.
You know, I seriously hate being so isolated. Depression has hit so hard that I don't even have the motivation to leave my room. I want to do so many things. I want to enjoy my life. Live my life. Have fun. I want friends. I don't even use my phone to text because there's no one.

I've been sitting here for the past several minutes just reliving my memories of Kurt Cobain over and over in my head, and I realized that even though it's been 24 years since his death, my heart/soul still hurts so much. I keep thinking "What if...?" I will never "get over" it.
I think one of the absolute worst things about the Trump administration is the fact that, even if something good/amazing happens, like anything good with North Korea, I can't be happy about it because I instantly think "Omg that's so amazing! How is Trump going to fuck this up?"

I went from 250lbs to 400lbs in a few days time in '07 from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome from which I was given a 1% chance to live. I struggled for years to lose the weight that the steroids and reaction caused, and I thought I would always be big because of it. I am beyond happy.
Excuse me for a moment, but I have to brag on myself. Since Oct. '17, I've done everything I can to lose weight, and it's paid off in a big way. I just weighed myself, and I'm down to 297.4lbs. Over 100lbs lost in 11 months. I'm so proud of myself.
I've been thinking a lot lately about my great-granddaddy. I recently found out he fought in WWI, and during WWII, he was a spy in Nazi Germany. I keep thinking about what he, and all the other soldiers, saw/lived through, and now seeing how the country is today. Breaks my heart.
