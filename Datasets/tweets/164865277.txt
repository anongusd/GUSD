@DoctorFisher Thanks for sharing your views. We'll have to agree to disagree.
@DoctorFisher An unfounded fear. There is no evidence (18+ yrs in OR, 8 in WA) of coercion bc of laws being called #DeathwithDignity Act.
@DoctorFisher Of course. The term is preferred by people who use the law, it's how they tend to define it.
@DoctorFisher Our preferred term is "Death with Dignity", after the OR law. Other, technical terms are also acceptable of course.
@JeremyDBond @CompAndChoices However, terms like "marriage equality" or "civil rights" show technical accuracy isn't always preferable.
@JeremyDBond @CompAndChoices It does because it describes the practice in clinically accurate terms.
@Lauchlin @APStylebook That is correct. Ppl using #DeathwithDignity laws want to live, aren't suicidal. But their disease is killing them.
@DoctorFisher @APStylebook @Lauchlin The effect is hastening of death/dying process. Physician-hastened death/dying accurate but mouthful
@JeremyDBond Plenty of alternatives, from #DeathwithDignity (name of model statute) to physician-assisted dying. https://t.co/s1H7aYRQsz

Thank you so much, @nmillaz for co-hosting this week &amp; everyone for joining in today. See you next month! #dwdchat

#DWDchat is monthly. I hope you'll all join 3rd Thursday in July, 7/16, 3pm PT again. Invite your friends. Will keep you posted on details.
Approaching the conclusion of today's discussion. Please share any final thoughts &amp; feel free to continue after 4 PT. #dwdchat

@jamessh07054823 Talk about an unlikely state. In time, Louisiana will have a #DeathwithDignity law, too.
We're stepping up the effort to recruit local volunteers for our upcoming online advocacy effort. DM us for details. #dwdchat
We're putting in infrastructure for local supporters to advocate online (petitions, letter to legislators, emails). Join us! #dwdchat
And perhaps an add-on to Q3: What can we at #DeathwithDignity National Center do to help? #dwdchat
Q3: How can #DeathwithDignity advocates (you!) best advance the cause in the coming months? #dwdchat
@jamessh07054823 Thanks, James. We're doing what we can. Your support matters! #dwdchat
Let's move on to the final topic/Q3. Final thoughts on Q2 before we move on? #dwdchat
@nmillaz Biggest concern w/ ballot bills: they are super difficult/nigh impossible to change. Legislatures can amend their bills. #dwdchat
@nmillaz The ballot = a spendy way to pass laws. There are murmurs about an initiative in #CA in 2016 if bill fails in legislature. #dwdchat
The #OR #DeathwithDignity Act has been in effect since '97. Serving as model legislation, incl. for #WA ('08) &amp; VT ('13) #dwdchat
@nmillaz Both #Oregon &amp; #Washington have #DeathwithDignity laws thanks to a popular vote/ballot initiative.  #dwdchat
Thanks @Danielley, @jamessh07054823, @Jane17220975, @ArlaDahlAuthor for RTs. Feel free to join the discussion at any time! #dwdchat
@nmillaz It helps to have a prominent advocate, such as John Jay Hooker is in #TN. #dwdchat
Q2: What state are you in, what's your view on the status of #DeathwithDignity there &amp; what's needed going forward?  #dwdchat
@nmillaz To our surprise, debate and media coverage in #Tennessee were particularly vigorous. A great first step. #dwdchat
@nmillaz Right now, our eyes are on California and D.C. Next year, Maryland and Maine look promising again. #dwdchat
@nmillaz An easy first step is to just talk about #DeathwithDignity, with friends, family, etc. &amp; educate yourself about the issue. #dwdchat
@nmillaz Rally friends to contact their legislators as well. There's strength in numbers. And persistence. #dwdchat
@nmillaz We've seen emails &amp; esp. calls directly to legislators from their constituents to work, esp. before hearings/votes. #dwdchat
We're going to delve into the next topic/Q2 shortly. Final thoughts on Q1 before we move on? #dwdchat
@nmillaz @jamessh07054823 Eligibility requirements for #DeathwithDignity laws unlikely to be expanded, we don't advocate for that. #dwdchat
@nmillaz You need the right sponsor intro'ing the right bill for the right reason + right mix of legislators + advocacy effort... #dwdchat
@nmillaz Most legislatures took up the issue for the 1st time ever, many in response to Brittany's story. #VT took 10 yrs to pass. #dwdchat
RT @nmillaz: A1: It has been quite an amazing year, so long after Oregon put their law into place! Amazing and promising! #dwdchat
What do you think? From your desk/chair/window in your state, what does #DeathwithDignity look like mid-2015? #dwdchat
3) This year #DeathwithDignity has been called the civil rights issue of today, likened to reproductive choice, marriage equality.  #dwdchat
2) Historic votes: #California Senate &amp; #Maine House passed #DeathwithDignity bills. #dwdchat
This is what we know: 1) 25 state legislatures + DC have considered #DeathwithDignity. The issue is here to stay &amp; getting bigger.	 #dwdchat
Q1: Post-Brittany M. &amp; as state leg. sessions wind down, what do you think about the progress in the #DeathwithDignity movement?  #dwdchat
@CremationGuru Indeed. Social media is just getting too fast for the real-life bureaucratic processes. #dwdchat
@Jaxsbinky, @itsmydeath, @meljmcguire jump in for #DWDchat on state of legislation around the US.
Q1 coming up shortly. Just a reminder, begin your responses to Q1 w/ A1, to Q2 w/ A2, etc. Don't forget the hashtag #dwdchat

California Senate PASSES SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act - 23 to 14 #DeathwithDignity
Debate concludes in #CA Senate on SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act. Sen. Wolk closes. Vote imminent. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Monning: Our choice is to pass SB 128 or have it go to the ballot with no possibility of review or reform. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Monning: There is no evidence in #Oregon of #DeathwithDignity medications ending up in wrong hands.
CA Sen. Monning: People gain peace of mind by having the prescription that they can but don't have to use. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Monning: In addition to curing &amp; healing, docs pledge to reduce pain and suffering. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Monning: #EndofLife option under SB 128 gives families a chance to share goodbyes with their dying loved one. #DeathwithDignity

CA Sen. Monning: #EndofLife option under SB 128 cannot be exercised under advance directives. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Monning, co-author of SB 128, thanks Senators for tough but respectful debate. There is no wrong vote. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Galgiani: SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act will give people a chance to say goodbye to their loved ones. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Galgiani: I support the bill bc I believe it is thoughtful, gives guidance to the dying/their families. #DeathwithDignity
@meljmcguire At least 3 senators in support of SB 128 *have* spoken. Everyone's mind is likely made up by now. It's the vote that counts.
Our VP George Eighmey: #DeathwithDignity opponents use the same stale, false &amp; emotional arguments disproved over and over in #Oregon.
RT @mcgreevy99 Sen. Stone, opposing aid in dying bill, says California's new theme could be "Come play, live and die in California"
CA Sen. Mitchell: As lawmakers we have to support personal choice and rights of California residents. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Mitchell: #EndofLife Option Act empowers us to provide Californians a choice. We cannot legislate morality. #DeathwithDignity
Despite CA Sen. Stone's assertion, use of palliative care/hospice in #OR actually improved after #DeathwithDignity Act went into effect.
CA Sen. Hernandez: I wouldn't want my loved ones to see me suffer. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Hernandez: If I had a terminal illness, I'd want to have the option under SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Allen: With respect to all religions, no faith under our constitution should dictate the way we die. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Allen: SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act does not oblige anyone to use it. Participation is entirely voluntary. #DeathwithDignity
CA Sen. Allen: Will support SB 128 #EndofLife Option Act after careful consideration of benefits &amp; opponents' concerns. #DeathwithDignity

@SpeakElla Pain/suffering in terminal illness often prevents people from living their life the way they want to.
@SpeakElla Autonomy here recognizes the right of competent people to choose the course of their life, including how it will end.
@SpeakElla At end of life it is often doctors not the patient who decide on the course of action.
@SpeakElla Yes, autonomy here means your personal ability/capacity to decide for yourself how you wish to live (and die).
@SpeakElla People with terminal illness want to live but are dying. Meds go only so far in managing pain; autonomy loss is also a concern.
@SpeakElla People using #DeathwithDignity law are dying, use the law to prevent agonizing pain &amp; loss of autonomy in their final days.

@reasonablewlvrn Enforcement of unused #deathwithdignity meds disposal is the same as for any other kind of unused/leftover drugs.
@reasonablewlvrn Only mentally competent, ie of sound mind, terminally-ill adults may access the #deathwithdignity law.
@skipbidder That has been true since Galileo's time, if not even before then. Factual truth prevails over irrational, false arguments.
@reasonablewlvrn Rules for unused prescriptions under #DeathwithDignity laws are the same as for other meds, some of which may be lethal.

Last week was a busy one in the #DeathwithDignity movement. We've compiled the media highlights: http://t.co/WMOHOE44gC
@lukobe @MonicaHar Opting in/out is voluntary. Like patients, docs/health care systems aren't obligated to participate in #DeathwithDignity.

@clinkshrink You (or anyone else) can put words in our mouth all day long but you can't deny data/facts. Thanks!
@clinkshrink No, *you* are suggesting that. We're saying: 17 yrs of OR + 4 of WA experience show law's safeguards prevent its abuse.
@clinkshrink If states adopt #DeathwithDignity laws modeled on Oregon's success, patient protections are, in fact, guaranteed.

.@scrubsblues Interesting idea. One challenge is I often didn't have topics far ahead of time...hosts, yes; topics no. :) #dwdchat
#DWDchat MT @scrubsblues: perhaps a list of future topics (monthly)as pinned tweet so people can set reminders if specific
T3: What is one piece (or more if you're frisky) of advice do you have for my successor? #dwdchat

T2: The good, the bad, and the ugly: what's worked best and what's really not worked for you with our chats? #dwdchat
RT @ElinSilveous: Interested in #EOL or Death With Dignity? Check out #DWDChat going on NOW. #Hospice #POLST #AdvanceDirectives
@Victoriabttrfly Looking back to 2012, convos that trended were about MA campaign, #AdvanceDirectives, Advocating 4 Quality of Life #dwdchat
@Victoriabttrfly This year, #DWDchat trended when @coffeemommy hosted discussion on demystifying death for children. Will check other yrs.
Good question. See if I can find it. RT @Victoriabttrfly: #dwdchat t1 what was under discussion that day remember at all? Curious
@scrubsblues When you see me, I'll be @melissa_barber instead of @DeathwDignity Might even start using Twitter personally again. :) #dwdchat
RT @scrubsblues: @DeathwDignity phew #dwdchat unique and very engaging - real discussion and depth, very valuable, thank you!
Overall, having done these chats regularly for 3 years, mostly it's the amazing, diverse group that keeps coming back every wk. TY! #dwdchat
T1: A memory that sticks out to me is when one of our community members mentioned our chat was trending one day. Exciting day. #dwdchat
I'll still follow the movement closely &amp; help when I can. RT @scrubsblues: #dwdchat noo!! don't leave! :)

#DWDchat is weekly &amp; @MyDirectives hosting next week. Please join us again next Thurs!
RT @skipbidder: Thanks for hosting @galvan_as #dwdchat	You probably need a spinning seal. Here is a spinning seal: http://t.co/u7LxTLSDw5
What #eol topic do you want to talk about? Have two guest host slots left for 2014! Get your spot now; tweet at me! (@skipbidder) #dwdchat
Thank you so much, @galvan_as for hosting this week! And thank all of you for joining in the convo today! #dwdchat
@skipbidder Nope, makes sense. Just hadn't really thought of it that way. #dwdchat
Interesting. MT @skipbidder: Family notification is really only tried to be put in as a barrier... #dwdchat
@galvan_as But how do you define one's family? #dwdchat
@galvan_as Definition of family came up during our MA #DeathwithDignity campaign. Some ppl wanted family notification req in law.  #dwdchat
RT @skipbidder: @galvan_as Yet it is essentially, probably much MORE important to do that work (paperwork &amp; the talking) for LGBT #dwdchat
@galvan_as :) I'm curious what sort of suggestions, ideas we as a group can come up with to work toward change. #dwdchat
@galvan_as Oh, what I meant was do you think that movement is helping with language around partner, wife, husband, etc? #dwdchat
@UUJames @WaywardChad @itsalldhamma How about you, have you experienced language challenges in your work or personal lives? #dwdchat
.@galvan_as do you think that's changing as marriage equality is happening in more states? #dwdchat
Very true. RT @galvan_as: Language should really be as inclusive as possible in order to provide proper care. #dwdchat
RT @skipbidder: #dwdchat It might be a small sample size, but I've not found preferred gender pronouns to be a problem for MOST of hospice …
Hope you can! #DWDchat RT @UUJames: @DeathwDignity will try to chime in but on road soon. Hospice chaplain on call tonight
RT @galvan_as: I could make sure if she regained consciousness the nurses would know it was she/her. To their credit, they did. #dwdchat
@skipbidder @galvan_as So glad I just found @lgbtagingcntr through your tweets. Thanks! #dwdchat
@galvan_as That's a really good question. Who is one's family? We touched on this a little last week. #dwdchat
@skipbidder Interesting take on it. We should talk more. I think I disagree, but I might be misunderstanding you. DM emails?
@skipbidder Yep, some will leave the room when they take the medication, but come back right after to comfort their patients, fams. #dwdchat
@UUJames TY for the RT! Please feel welcome to join in the convo if you're comfortable. #dwdchat
RT @galvan_as: So, the first thing I want to talk about is language. #dwdchat
RT @galvan_as: I worked with the hospital to reunite them. She ended up forgiving them, and they got a chance to say goodbye. #dwdchat
Hey there! Thanks for joining. RT @LivGraber: Hi, Liv Graber, healthcare chaplain, Ontario, Canada...checking in  #DWDchat
@skipbidder Yeah, it's true. Interestingly enough, it's actually not as much of a polarizing issue for #hpm folk in OR, WA. #dwdchat
So glad you joined! MT @skipbidder: I'm Bruce Scott. Hospice doc &amp; geriatrician. Chair-elect for the AAHPM's LGBT issues grp. #dwdchat
RT @galvan_as: In early 2013, I learned my former partner was in a coma, in an ICU. #dwdchat
Who wouldn't want that? :) MT @skipbidder: Those of you who don't want to see any #dwdchat tweets should look away now.
.@dockeithwales TY for the RT. That doesn't really apply to me since I'm tweeting for my employer.  #dwdchat
.@itsalldhamma No worries! Chime in when you're comfortable. #dwdchat

RT @justPatrickO: @DeathwDignity @kimberlypaulnc Amen! I have a ton of freedoms in my life to make choices why not how I die?
@geripalblog Respectfully disagree. Presents false dichotomy btwn #palliative care &amp; DWDAs. Summed up by @nmillaz http://t.co/xvfJppMGTs
MT @galvan_as: Thanks - I'm hoping to have a discussion about what 'family' means, and how we can practice empathy at #eol. #dwdchat
.@justPatrickO Oddly, it's one we come across among the opposition pretty frequently. I really don't get it.
MT @kimberlypaulnc: It's not a matter of right or wrong- it's a matter of choice! I hope I have the same right, to die as I wish, one day!

@meljmcguire It's a very strange argument, isn't it? Does that argument cover all medical procedures? If not, why not?

Transcript of today's #DWDchat w/guest host @Victoria_Noe on Friend Grief http://t.co/ZygD5Woivk #hpm
Thanks again, everyone! Hope to see you next Thurs, and bring a friend! #dwdchat
Great to have you back! RT @emme1313: @DeathwDignity @Victoria_Noe Thanks for the convo, been a while since I was here #DWDchat
#DWDchat is weekly &amp; @galvan_as hosting next week. Please join us again next Thurs!
RT @Victoria_Noe: This has been a wonderful hour. Thank you all so much for participating and to @DeathwDignity for having me! #DWDchat
BTW, What #eol topic do you want to talk about? Have two guest host slots left for 2014! Get your spot now; tweet at me! #dwdchat
TY, @Victoria_Noe for hosting this week! &amp; thank all of you for joining in the convo today! Great to see old friends rejoin today. #dwdchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: It was a lot funnier later, but she wasn't good on those kinds of details, so we understood. #DWDchat
@Victoria_Noe Oh drat. The final stage of planning. I'll bet you all adapted really well. #dwdchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: My friend planned her funeral, assigned roles for friends. She forgot to tell some of us, so it was a surprise when we go…
I've found ppl want to do *something* to help. That help can be as simple as preparing a meal, holding a hand, just being. #dwdchat
I would want my friends around me when I'm dying (if they're comfortable), and help as much as they feel they can. #dwdchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: Would you want your friends to help you when you're dying? What would you want them to do? #DWDchat
RT @emme1313: @Victoria_Noe watching a loved one die can change how we perceive  what we can do to create change #DWDchat
@Victoria_Noe Think a lot of people see many of their friends more often than family members on day-to-day basis. @ShyDi47  #dwdchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: @ShyDi47 It certainly does. I think a lot of people are surprised by the importance of friends and how they impact our li…
RT @ShyDi47: @justPatrickO @justPatrickO @DiverseAlz active listening works  #dwdchat
@AtheistAnalysis Cool! TY for the invite. Let's DM to exchange email addresses. #dwdchat
@Victoria_Noe Much like you! #dwdchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: One of the things I've loved in research for my books are the people who changed their lives after a friend died. #DWDchat
TY @vanda_french for RT! Please feel welcome to join in #DWDchat if you have time. We've about 15 min left today.
@Victoria_Noe Heck, very few want to talk about death at all...even when they're healthy. #dwdchat
@AtheistAnalysis And thank you!
@AtheistAnalysis I use http://t.co/2neBRZ1e83 because it automatically adds hashtag to every tweet. #DWDchat
RT @Victoria_Noe: Not everyone wants to admit they need help, much less that they're dying. They're probably quite overwhelmed, too. #DWDch…
@ShyDi47 @Victoria_Noe Think part is denial of dying. One of Mom's friends worked nearly until day he died. Didn't want to be sick. #dwdchat
