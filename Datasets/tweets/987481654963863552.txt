@HFantoche Have I taken something out of context?
@HFantoche What do you mean?
@HArring31875891 @mel_faith1 @HFantoche No, why? Are you?
@BeckysTidePods @RodStryker I think it has something to do with Luciferianism, or whatever that cult is called.
@307WindyWyoming @realDonaldTrump @VP Just thought you should know, I saw the American flag in your profile picture and accidentally mistook you for a patriot. You might consider changing it, so others don't make the same mistake.
@politicalHEDGE A friend tells you when you have dirt on your face.
@HFantoche Well I just recently found out that I have it. I read your bio, where you say it's nothing personal. I have the same issues with people taking things I say personally. I don't mean anything by some of the things I say.
@mel_faith1 @HFantoche Whatever your college degree is in? Was that a trick question?

@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @jameco01 Not you, him. He said bye. I guess he realized he's outmatched and no longer cares to continue his feeble attempt at trolling me. However he still wants to be a part of the conversation.
@mitchellvii @BonnieGranny Because he can't draw those kind of crowds.

@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @jameco01 I doubt bots have the ability to converse at such a high level of intelligence.
@mel_faith1 @HFantoche Apparently you're not an expert if you can't see that he's the arrogant prick that started with the insults while being in the wrong.
@HFantoche @mel_faith1 Apparently she is.

@AragonStories @RealJamesWoods If it's in print it must be true. Also, those values are conservative values. I don't know that the left has ever shared those values.
@KerryRo08167585 @mel_faith1 @HFantoche @jameco01 Obviously. But just because you're arrogant doesn't give you the right to tell others that they are wrong and their opinions don't matter. I don't mind arrogant people, as long as they can back up their arrogance. It's people like you, who can't, that I find annoying.
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 The only reason I said anything is because he insulted her when she was clearly right about her assumption. So, who started what?
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 This conversation isn't about the meaning of the sign. It's about her having a valid point about it being Photoshopped.
@KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 @mel_faith1 There you go again misconstruing my comments with your opinion framed in the form of a fact. Then projecting this as me being the one that is twisting things around.
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 give him the right to down play my response as wrong, and frame his opinion in the form of a fact. That's just an insult to my intelligence.
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 I don't agree with his opinion about her having a valid point, or his opinion of my opinion that she has a valid point. As for the message on the sign I completely agree with that. Just because he doesn't have the intellectual capacity to comprehend this difference doesn't... 1/2
@HFantoche Obviously.
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 For all you know the sign could have had an entirely different meaning, such as, "please help the Iranian people", or "we stand with Trump". I know how ludicrous that sounds, but the possibility can't be ruled out by people with the intellectual capacity to comprehend this.
@mel_faith1 @KerryRo08167585 @HFantoche @jameco01 I didn't call anyone any names. I'm sorry you think I'm being an ass. I also don't disagree with his assessment about their conversations and ideology. I was merely agreeing with her point that the sign is Photoshopped and not necessarily the viewpoint of the sign holder. 1/2

@J_Shantel_Ro @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren I fully agree with you on every point except the players being puppets. I think they're doing it through ignorance rather than malicious intent. Obama on the other hand was unequivocally malicious. I think the players are merely sheep fooled by the wolf.
@FajaLife @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren I don't think it was Obama. The deep state has been around longer than that. At least since the establishment of The Fed, in 1913. Obama just happened to be who was installed into the presidency at the time. The current run started with Herbert Walker.

@J_Shantel_Ro @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren I think it was Obama that created the division. I don't blame Kaepernick, or the other players for wanting to bring attention to an issue. I just disagree with their approach to the protest. There's a time and a place for protesting, and the national anthem isn't it.

@prscountryheart @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren While I agree with most of your tweet, I'm going to have to ixnay the part about kneeling in front of a police station.

@mollyelyseurban @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren Comedic Democrat who follows Jesus? Is there such a thing as an ironic oxymoron? Democrats aren't funny, and a true follower of Christ wouldn't be a Democrat. Those two beliefs are diametrically opposed. You made my brain hurt.
@FajaLife @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren Actually, Obama set the divide, Kaepernick is just perpetuating it. I'm guessing more out of ignorance than malicious intent. He probably bought Obama's propaganda, which was malicious.
@hysellaz @IvyShoots @kingtorch2297 @joe_norte @BlueRobotDesign @TomiLahren No I said what I meant. I don't mind being corrected when I'm wrong. But don't correct me when you're wrong.

@iupmadsquatt @dmartosko Yes, apparently you are.
@glomad67 @cspan @FLOTUS It's not bullying when you're defending yourself from your attackers. 90% of the media and 100% of liberals berate and attack this president every minute of every day.

@AssangeMrs That was the whole point of leaking when he did. To expose her corruption and keep her out of the White House. After 8 years of the Obama regime, Hillary would have been the end of our republic.
@JackPosobiec Actually what you're talking about is prophecied in the old testament. As Jesus was crucified to fulfill scripture, (Psalm 22), so too must this come to pass.
@realBrianKScott @TyTyNEV @ddggrandma @MichaelCohen212 @FoxNews @POTUS Not to mention he's a neo-nazi, which is a left wing ideology. I have trouble reconciling the thought of liberals also being Christian. Those two things contradict each other.

@margaretcox2299 @SenSanders You're right! Single payer market based healthcare IS an abysmal failure. That's why Obamacare imploded under its own weight. Insurance companies were hemorrhaging billions of dollars until they started pulling out of the markets.
@margaretcox2299 @BorobodurA @Americanthatguy @GymCoachMac @inittowinit007 I have to try and keep things as simplistic as possible for liberals to have a chance of comprehending. I never said anything about lifting our laws. The KKK isn't a law making body. Jim Crow laws were local laws, not federal. You don't get to make up history to fit ur narrative.
@margaretcox2299 @SenSanders Oh crap! I just realized my last comment was probably beyond your ability to comprehend. The Star Wars I'm referring to is the Reagan era Strategic Defense Initiative. GPS stands for Global Positioning System. It's one of the technologies that came out of SDI.
@margaretcox2299 @SenSanders The stupid BS space program? So you're more of an expert on military matters and national security than generals Kelly and Mattis? Please share your wisdom with the world. Most of the technology we have today stems from military research. Think Star Wars and GPS.
@margaretcox2299 @SenSanders Well hopefully after midterms Republicans will pick up enough seats in the House to be able to finish getting rid of what's left of Obamacare, and draft REAL healthcare reform to make it affordable for all Americans. Unfortunately RINO's like McCain are holding up real change.

@margaretcox2299 @BorobodurA @Americanthatguy @GymCoachMac @inittowinit007 The Nazis just replaced the N word with Jews, and rejected some of the horrific components of the KKK, because they felt it was too inhumane. Those who fail to learn from the past are condemned to repeat it.
@margaretcox2299 @BorobodurA @Americanthatguy @GymCoachMac @inittowinit007 Antifa means Anti-First Amendment. The Nazis weren't facists, they were socialist. Mussolini was facist. Mussolini wasn't racist, therefore facism doesn't have a racial component. The KKK is a militant arm of the Democratic party. Nazis modeled their Nuremberg laws after the KKK.
@SenSanders @margaretcox2299 Which will only cost the taxpayers 33 trillion dollars over ten years. That's 1.5 times our current deficit. The dollar has already been weakened by the doubling of our deficit under Obama. It's been a fiat currentcy since Nixon took us off the gold standard in 1972.
@goodoldcatchy @margaretcox2299 You're preaching to the choir. Try telling that to the fake news outlets like CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, WaPo, and NYT. If they actually reported the news instead of spreading lies and disinformation about Trump 24/7 we might actually be able to save our republic.
@JordyAri @queenbea_09 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Nationalizing universities is a socialist idea, which puts government in charge. It would be an erosion of freedom, and a heavy financial burden for the govt and tax payers.
@TheLibertonian @MartArchives @thehill And Trump controls the military, as commander in chief. Liberals might want to stew on that for a bit and let it marinade. This election isn't Dems vs Reps. It's corrupt vs non-corrupt. Trump is the non-corrupt one in this scenario btw.
@TheLibertonian @MartArchives @thehill If Dems take back either house of Congress that will be the end of our republic as we know it. There will be no middle class anymore. There will be the rich and the poor. We'll probably have another civil war. Keep in mind though, Republicans own more guns than Dems...
@TheLibertonian @MartArchives @thehill No. If I put forth an argument about why you should vote Republican this November, it will be more along the lines of, "he's not a politician and can't be bribed." We have a chance to get rid of corrupt politicians on both sides of the aisle...

@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump There, I just gave you a history lesson and saved you hours, or possibly days, of research. You're welcome.
@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump The Nazis modeled their Nuremberg Laws after Democrats Jim Crow laws, but toned down a bit, because they thought some Jim Crow laws were too evil. They used the KKK as the model for their form of government. They just replaced the N word with Jews.
@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump I have, that's how I know it's a leftist ideology. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini were huge fans of Karl Marx. They also had a huge amount of respect for each other, until WWII. While Nazis and Democrats were racist, Mussolini was not.
@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump You just perfectly described Obama. The only indication of racism I've seen comes from Obama starting around the time of Ferguson with his race baiting and dangerous rhetoric that has seen dozens of cops killed.

Pretty sure Hussein beats Trump for traitor of the year award.
@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump My main concern was doing my part to prevent an "undocumented career felon" from taking over the country.

@RyderIsKing @melanieann21353 @VictoriadiPrada @realDonaldTrump I'm not fucking anybody. I think a more accurate way to express it would be a vote for Trump is a vote against Hillary.

Trump is the difference between a bad loser and a sore loser. He doesn't even know how to lose properly. He couldn't lose his way out of an election rigged in his opponents favor. Trump is so bad at losing I'm beginning to think he doesn't even know how to lose.
