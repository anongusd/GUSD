It is time to bring Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation to a vote on the floor of the United States Senate. He has earned my support.
The confirmation process should be comprehensive, detailed, and allow nominees to prove their worthiness... It should not be a weapon to use against a qualified nominee whose life has been given in service to our country’s laws, the judiciary, and the American people.
It seems opponents of Judge Kavanaugh are engaged in character assassination to destroy the reputation of a devoted public servant and a loving husband and father. I, for one, will not stand by and watch it happen. Video link here: https://t.co/VAhEUzkFRE https://t.co/A4sSWyYkGf

Great visit to VT Halter Marine Shipbuilder in Pascagoula yesterday. It reaffirmed my commitment to keep our shipyards competitive. Their good work helps ensure US national security, while promoting commerce and good jobs for Mississippians.
Congratulations to Jameshia Attaway of Indianola &amp; Grace McAllister of Nettleton, who were honored in D.C. with @PruSpirit of Community Awards for their exceptional youth volunteerism. See profiles of their work here: https://t.co/C0wXVpp3mz https://t.co/fl1wJH5Xco

This is wonderful news for all Mississippians. I'm grateful to @Toyota for its belief in our world-class workforce. Appreciate the hard work of @PhilBryantMS @mdaworks @ARCgov @CDFMS on this project. https://t.co/KanQhwi1k1
Added my name as a cosponsor to the @JohnCornyn Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. This sensible legislation recognizes states’ authority to issue firearms licenses and permits, while supporting the rights of gun owners. #GunRights https://t.co/6crTfFWnPf
Voting to confirm Mike Pompeo to lead the @StateDept was easy. He has the confidence of @POTUS, and I believe he brings strong leadership to the role of chief diplomat for the United States.
What a blessing to have an opportunity to share time with @SenThadCochran today as he closes down his office.  We both enjoyed playing his famous baby grand piano. https://t.co/aJQfWVBkYA
Happy to vote with the Rules Committee to advance @SenatorLankford resolution to change Senate rules to get past Democratic obstruction of @POTUS judicial &amp; executive nominees. https://t.co/If4rRd1oG5

It was a pleasure to catch up with Mississippi's own Randy Reeves, the @DeptVetAffairs Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs. He served Miss. veterans well and now does so for the nation. #Veterans https://t.co/zY1M5tD1II
@SenateAgGOP Thank you, @SenPatRoberts and @SenateAgGOP.  I certainly look forward to working on this committee.  When American agriculture does well, the whole country does well.
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is a strong start to help Mississippi families keep more of their hard-earned money &amp; to help small businesses create jobs. Congress can do more to work with @POTUS to reduce burdensome regulations and improve our economy. #TaxDay https://t.co/YcwHPAS5b7 https://t.co/6ONhRJ0fCm
President @realDonaldTrump has named qualified executive &amp; judicial nominees to serve the American people. Senate Democrats are wasting important time with delaying tactics. Futile &amp; unproductive. Let’s get to work. https://t.co/V5IPvJQdwe https://t.co/s1mQo2P5pE
.@realDonaldTrump, with British and French allies, acted boldly against the atrocities of the Assad regime against its own people.  The proportional response by our brave men and women of the Armed Forces is warranted and appropriate.
Had an informative and good meeting today with @MayorFlaggs about @CityofVicksburg water and wastewater infrastructure needs. https://t.co/ZzbwhpymXE
It has been great to begin to get to know some of my Senate colleagues, including U.S. Senator @JerryMoran of Kansas. We both serve on the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. https://t.co/T5EPtIskj7

Grateful for the opportunity to visit with @realDonaldTrump and @VP Pence today. They were gracious in welcoming me to the U.S. Senate and I am committed to supporting their conservative agenda.
It is a great honor to serve Mississippi as its first female U.S. Senator.  I am ready to hit the ground running, and do everything I can to represent Mississippians well. https://t.co/1k2pk4QLf2
