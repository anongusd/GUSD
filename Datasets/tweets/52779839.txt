14th Amendment reverses Dred Scott and grants birthright citizenship. #reconstructionhistory
1857 brings Dred Scott case and denial of citizenship to African Americans. #reconstructionhistory
There are Qs in the 1820s &amp; 1830s about whether black people can get US passports--again, who is a citizen? What rights do citizens have? #reconstructionhistory
The Constitution as originally written mentions that one must be a citizen for things like being a Member of Congress, but does not define how to tell who is a citizen. #reconstructionhistory
American history before the 14th Amendment--confusion about what citizenship means, who has it, how it connects to voting, etc. #reconstructionhistory
Paul Finkelman is the first speaker for the panel on the Fourteenth Amendment &amp; Citizenship--starting with African American citizenship. #reconstructionhistory
Q&amp;A time! @VernonBurton1 is answering Q about why the northern states ratified the 14th Amendment. Partial reasons: idealism of Lincoln and intransigence of former Confederates. Different states had different debates. #reconstructionhistory
@VernonBurton1 is running through some of the many Supreme Court cases that have addressed or centered on the 14th Amendment. #reconstructionhistory
Responses to the 14th Amendment included the rise (and lack of punishment) of outlaw groups like the Klan. There were attempts to make such terrorism punishable by federal law. #reconstructionhistory
The 14th Amendment dealt with citizenship, voting rights, and sanctions against former Confederates. It (and other Reconstruction Amendments) made the federal government a protector of liberty--an expansion of governmental power. #reconstructionhistory
Hence: the 14th Amendment! #reconstructionhistory
New freedoms came to African Americans with emancipation, but the end of slavery wasn't enough--a push for truer equality brought 1866 Civil Rights Act, which granted citizenship and other equalities, but there were Qs about its constitutionality. #reconstructionhistory
The 14th Amendment granted that citizenship. #reconstructionhistory
Lincoln's suggestion of citizenship for black people helped push Wilkes to assassination. #reconstructionhistory
The Dred Scott decision had drawn a new color line into the Constitution. The Civil War brought a search for new definitions of freedom &amp; liberty. #reconstructionhistory
@VernonBurton1: 14th Amendment created a revolution in the lives of formerly enslaved people and all people. #reconstructionhistory
