Why would you follow me and tweet this about me? It says more about you than me. https://t.co/s6t1kuELn9
You follow me....you tweet a gratuitous nasty tweet....why should I not block you? And how twisted it is of you to follow me if this your view of me? https://t.co/cMqVGDSPJj
I know travel is expensive...but I fear young journalists are getting their so called experience from reading the internet...getting out and meeting people,hearing their problems is a real experience and so important (and of course new orgs don‚Äôt like to spend money)
Go ahead - you spearhead the movement to tax the american people for journalism and see if you survive. :) https://t.co/BqYm8Ai7Y8
Journalism has problems but is not dead and this a great time in history for all of us in journalism to brainstorm how we can do better for the American people. We should examine the business model all the way down to fact finding and opinion (which is important to debate issues) https://t.co/381PAiil5L

Are there enough editors? Would a strong editor have let that Buzzfeed story that Mueller then said was incorrect have been published? Did that story have to be anonymous sources and if so, why rush the story? Why not actually wait for report so we could be sure? https://t.co/Q5g9mZX817
Why do you want to get into a contest as to who is worse...why not get into a debate how to better do the job? I think executives at the top have to stop looking at the quarterly profits..yes, they must make a profit, but not squeeze that last penny at the cost of quality https://t.co/skCMCvy34o

As an aside...I am not the first journalist to make a mistake...I bet you have made them, too...but have you corrected yours? I corrected mine. I trust people willing to admit errors..not those who are still trying to drum up a conspiracies about a mistake https://t.co/wxh54kYBTL
Why are you so cynical that you think this was part of some big conspiracy on my part? You obviously don‚Äôt know me if you think I would be part of a conspiracy...ask people at CNN who know me - you don‚Äôt- if they think it was a mistake or if I am part of some grand conspiracy https://t.co/wxh54kYBTL
I would think he would appreciate my integrity to fix a mistake...we all make mistakes in journalism (we are humans, not robots)...the question is: who fixes them upon learning about them? https://t.co/P9XQkav8uf

Quit trying to escalate things;if you read my twitter feed, you will see multiple times I tweeted it was mistake. Deleting a tweet only creates mystery;give it a rest;even my friends at CNN are fine;you neglect to point out I also said great journalism to beat other to news-why? https://t.co/uxJYrYeiNs

W/cable costing $ and locals tv free,and w/live streams of local tv stations greatly improved...I think cable news will get great competition this political season to report on Pres race-cable reporters don‚Äôt have the insight or sources like the reporters living there.
I love progress..love technology but when I see this (below) my first thought: jobs.

W/ livestream quality vastly improved..and people watching more online,you will get great insight into 2020 race by watching the livestreams of local news in Iowa etc this political season-their reporters live and breathe the state news and don‚Äôt just parachute in;
Yes,very cold in Alaska..but I love watching the livestreams from local stations like @Ch2KTUU because cables these days don‚Äôt give you a variety of news and second, the reporters who actually live in a state,like Iowa, know the political news and people best so I want to watch https://t.co/XoXIcGumXO

Check my tweets! I have corrected and corrected...what do you want me to do, wash your car? The story  is not how CNN got there but rather an indictment of Roger Sone. https://t.co/4NHRUvgLwg
This shows how fragile many are if my tweet, corrected by many other subsequent tweets, has started a conspiracy theory... https://t.co/gaD5NiochE
It is even being ignored by many others...people are cherry picking my tweet..yes, the first one was wrong but check the others that corrected it and get a full picture https://t.co/2EOJ13gBYS
I bring to this story years of being a criminal defense attorney ...it is unusual in a nonviolent crime that there is an early morning raid (and not surrender) unless fear destruction of evidence or flight or the prosecutor really does not like the target of the warrant https://t.co/IiFzWeyM7Z
Someone I have known for years and trust him https://t.co/CD5lHexFyA
The danger of twitter as the story really is the Stone indictment. .and the irony? Even if CNN were tipped off by anyone, (and CNN says it was there on a hunch) it is the job of news orgs to act on tips...and we all work our sources 24/7...and good for CNN for getting it 1st https://t.co/SqtRSwWlsA

And as an aside...the story really is not whether CNN was there or not (although the video is helpful to understand the news)-what is the REAL news: the arrest of Roger Stone https://t.co/03XnGW0hry
I am told - by a good source - that I am wrong to think CNN acted on a tip and hence was at Roger Stone‚Äôs today...I assume thus that what is right is that it was fortuitous...that CNN acted on a hunch after putting some clues together (including activity at the grand jury)...
It is really bad to scare and hurt govt employees by Washington‚Äôs failure to the American people to run the government..but worse, it is probably also terrifying their children...their kids feel the stress of their parents and probably worry about money and food, too
RT @AMAZlNGNATURE: This made my day üíû https://t.co/oXVTHkLPj1
I don‚Äôt think it is nefarious at all for a news org to act on a tip..I think it is the news org‚Äôs job to act on a tip. https://t.co/rBgJ9lTatr
Many ways tips are legal....but some are not - eg violation of grand jury secrecy https://t.co/3untSf2FDg
Two legitimate reasons for a raid - and I have no idea if these are the reasons for this raid or not - FBI fears flight of accused or fears destruction of evidence and hence need element of surprise. https://t.co/qEPPyboxPh
No, the public does not necessarily need to know how CNN knew to be there. CNN does not have to tell anyone. https://t.co/rP66jukZsD
It  is no conspiracy - CNN either acted on a tip...or had been camped out there (either is good journalism.) What is most interesting is why it was a raid and not a surrender. Fear of flight or destruction of evidence or prosecutors really not like Stone? https://t.co/zxPtxUzzWE
Grand juries always create intrigue and suspicion as they are done in secret so I don‚Äôt know what would be different about this grand jury meeting yesterday from all the others. ...maybe there was something different or a good guess. https://t.co/1ApMDoL7pV
It is news is why news orgs want to cover it. It is news org job. https://t.co/bpL5XRMIu9
An indictment is never a good sign for an accused...but let‚Äôs wait for the trial when we get all the facts.  An indictment is secured by hearing only the prosecution‚Äôs evidence...at a trial a defendant can for first time challenge that evidence and also present evidence if wants https://t.co/28x2ufZpCz
There is nothing wrong w/ news org acting on a tip...I was not criticizing CNN for acting on a tip - every news organization acts on a tip. That is their job. You got this wrong;I was not criticizing CNN for acting on a tip (I would have criticized them if they IGNORED a tip.) https://t.co/zavnl9bvy0
It was not dirty for CNN to be there....that is their job...to get the news....you may not like CNN, but this raid was news and every other news org would have wanted to be there to cover it and this time CNN beat the other news orgs to the news https://t.co/7TbS2f6LDb
RT @Newsweek: A student who phoned in a fake bomb threat to an airline was trying to stop his parents from visiting https://t.co/nVppKyVZ3b‚Ä¶
It is possible... https://t.co/AHiFnNiUr5
Yes, I was incorrect to assign the tip to the FBI...there are multiple possible sources...more significant is that it was a raid (not a surrender at FBI w/his lawyer)-suggests FBI fear of flight and/or destruction of evidence or prosecutor really not happy w/ Stone https://t.co/7UxSnw2P2z
It could be a wild tip (FBI agent tells spouse where going to be..who tells friend..who mentions it at work to colleague who is related to or knows someone who works at CNN etc.) https://t.co/jwN7MhFbuU
Yes, you are right...and I am certainly not criticizing CNN for getting the video ‚Äî they beat out other news orgs and this is news https://t.co/GS2Pq50cVL
If he goes to trial (and that is months off), they will most likely get jurors who don‚Äôt know who he is and never heard of him...it is big news today..but months and months from now it will likely fade and get a jury who doesn‚Äôt know of him https://t.co/7eWoBKxh8y
Possible....but just an appearance before a grand jury is not always a significant matter and even if knew he was indicted (which was a secret),many would have expected a surrender to FBI w/ lawyer and not a early am raid. https://t.co/mjviNqL2zg
any news org who knew this would happen would have been there...and it is not sinister that CNN was there..they acted on a tip (or they have been staking out the place but I doubt that but maybe)...if you get a good news tip, you act. https://t.co/5RiFKizUsL
I am not criticizing CNN for being there...they out hustled other news orgs...I merely noted that I thought they were tipped off (and you get tipped off when you work your sources which is part of journalism) https://t.co/EZdxuO0raL
Even if you don‚Äôt like Roger Stone(whom I have never met),he is entitled to a fair trial...and at this point, presumed innocent (like every other person at this stage) but you have convicted him in your tweet https://t.co/A4k4vzhNPQ
CNN may have beaten out the other news organizations ...other news organizations may not have been following this story as closely ..may not have developed the sources that CNN has https://t.co/B3sEi4Zce8
Everyone is PRESUMED innocent. The burden of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) is on the prosecution. https://t.co/CdXyBKxUnh
A grand jury indicted. A judge signed an arrest warrant. https://t.co/AJZzjvVzc1
Or CNN could have just been staking out the place for days... https://t.co/sJdpJ8XVKM
They had a warrant...hence lawful arrest. https://t.co/N1X37xPZgh
Upon reflection, there are others who could have tipped off CNN ...others knew, maybe even Stone suspected it and tippped them off...as an aside, if I worked for a news org and had the tip, I would have sent cameras https://t.co/aSaiBZ4LNL
I corrected it...someone, not necessarily FBI...you are right, it is not obvious FBI..could have been Stone himself...or others https://t.co/H77XhJ999j
Let me correct: it is not obvious that FBI tipped off CNN...someone else could have tipped them off. https://t.co/e3yVoE6BcV
RE: Stone arrest. Before you get more information, facts, I would suggest you don‚Äôt jump to conclusions or take sides. Facts make a difference.
I had not thought of it...but Stone is an unusual man so perhaps you are right but I have no idea https://t.co/C5AiQTv4YS
If fear flight or destruction of evidence, you would not just ask to turn in... https://t.co/CGEKwnFcoX
I assume you mean ‚Äúyou are‚Äù ‚Äî and interesting that you call me an idiot :) https://t.co/qfqhkddxtF
I don‚Äôt know if they have something or not...but I do know that the method of arrest can be a hint of something (fear of flight or destruction of evidence or anger of a prosecutor);also,it is safer to quietly arrest someone but here it was a raid and CNN was tipped off https://t.co/yNLcFmq4nB
Tipping CNN off so that it was there w/ its cameras is an issue worth exploring. https://t.co/FDo9jf0KsK
CNN cameras were at the raid of Roger Stone...so FBI obviously tipped off CNN...even if you don‚Äôt like Stone, it is curious why Mueller‚Äôs office tipped off CNN instead of trying to quietly arrest Stone;quiet arrests are more likely to be safe to the FBI and the person arrested
Weird that Roger Stone arrested in FBI raid early this morning rather than surrender w/ lawyer at FBI office...did they think he would flee? Fear destruction of evidence? Or did he make the FBI and Mueller so mad so that they did it this way?

It is time for all of us in the news business to stop and think:are we overusing anonymous sources to the point where it becomes gossip and not journalism?yes, some use of anonymous sources is key...but when explosive story, should we not also confirm before reporting?
It is also bad for everyone else who quickly repeated it and did not separately try to source it; when news is explosive,it is not always enough to report what someone else reported..you need to source/confirm yourself; https://t.co/gakCcK2NmC

I did an honest job. I believed in my work on cable news. https://t.co/u7Jonlv6KL
News should not be about ‚Äòside‚Äô ‚Äî they should be about facts, whatever they may be...if it is about a ‚Äòside,‚Äô you are being played. https://t.co/TNuOnPX06x
I think all the TV news organization use them and I think they are too often used to hide corrupt conduct as news orgs should be transparent ..why do they need to hide how they do their work? https://t.co/pxESAZIZAf
You should watch the news to get  information and to be challenged intellectually by robust opinion / debate...but if you are not getting that, the news organization is failing you https://t.co/eA58axHKiM
Only if 1/ I am wanted by a network 2/there are sufficient resources to do a good job 3/no dishonest effort to get me to ‚Äòtilt‚Äô the news (FCC describes that as ‚Äúheinous‚Äù) https://t.co/ylcVToQvFZ
So why do you need to watch them if you know what they are going to say? And the reason you know what they are going to say is that news is now a team sport for many anchors and not ‚Äòfacts..whatever they may be‚Äô..and robust debate on those facts https://t.co/4SjDx9C6g1

For starters, news orgs need to lift NDA‚Äôs so viewers can see ‚Äòhow the sausage is made‚Äô- right now the execs gag employees w/ NDAs. News Orgs can‚Äôt have credibility when hiding ‚Äòstuff‚Äô-transparency is key in journalism. https://t.co/S1IN35yQms
If I name an anchor on a cable news network, do you know what that particular anchor is going to say about any new political issue of the day?

All honest journalists would say the same as this tweet..and say no more about it. Wait for the report, wait for the facts, whatever they may be.... https://t.co/MbadHG6LwM
do you think some are DELIBERATELY trying to ‚Äútilt‚Äù the news? That is what FCC says is heinous. https://t.co/FXyrBR3Fcq
Did you know that the FCC homepage says it is ‚Äúheinous‚Äù to deliberately ‚Äútilt‚Äù the news? Do you think any news orgs, or journalists, deliberately do this? It is one thing to make a mistake..but do you think there is more, a deliberate tilting of the news?
If @jonkarl ‚Äòs sources are right (not just spinning him)..what will some reporters say about their past reports? this is why reporters need to wait for the facts and just report what know...not what want to have happen or rumors..to spike ratings or click bait https://t.co/igt9We1w5K
