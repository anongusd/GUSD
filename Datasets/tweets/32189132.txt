I am calling on California state representatives to travel to the San Ysidro port of entry and ensure the safety and humane treatment of asylum seekers.		We can not just watch. We must act!
Since 2003, tuition and fees for higher education have increased by 91% in Texas. 		Meanwhile, state appropriations for higher education have declined by 27%. 		Unacceptable. #TXlege
Currently, there are close to 1.5 million Texans enrolled in higher education institutions, making up 7.3% of the nation‚Äôs higher education student body.		59% of these students will graduate with debt.		Student debt is holding back a generation of young Texans. We must do better!
Today, national student debt, has outpaced credit card and car loan debt, at $1.3 trillion. Repayment and default on student loans is a serious problem, 17% of millennial borrowers are defaulting on their loans and just 35% make regular payments.		We must take action! #TXlege
Today, more than half of Texas college graduates have student loan debt. The average loan amount is $26,000, and tuition costs in Texas continue to increase.		It‚Äôs time to make college debt free and secondary education affordable for all Texans. #TXlege
Houston is home to the second largest Latino population in the United States ‚Äî yet it has NEVER had a Latino Mayor.
Young Latinos are the key to building a democracy and government equipped to meet the ongoing challenges and changes Texas faces.		Let Latinos lead!

As Latino Democrats elected to Congress go back to their districts, they must start seeking to expand the Latino electorate and recruit more Latino candidates to run at all levels of government.
One critical factor in increasing Latino voter participation is having diverse candidates to vote for. 		People of color need to see their experiences and values represent on the ballot.
Donald Trump cannot continue to be The Democratic Party‚Äôs greatest recruitment tool.
The Democratic Party says a $30 million investment in engaging Latino and other minority voters helped @TheDemocrats achieve a net gain of 34 House seats and improve on 2014 turnout numbers.		I say keep investing!

Today Judge Dana Sabraw, will hear arguments in a lawsuit over the ongoing family separations crisis. This time, the issue is who counts as a parent, and the Trump administration wants adoptive parents out of the picture and ineligible for reunification. Reunite families! 		2/2

Invest in Latino youth!		When we provide professional development opportunities for a young person, not only does the individual grow, entire communities benefit.
Any strategy to create change in Texas must invest in youth organizing, particularly among young people of color, whether it‚Äôs election season or not.		Young Latinx are the golden ticket to victory.

Texas is a diverse state, parties should work harder to reflect the diversity of TX. 		Campaigns must hire culturally competent staff that understand the key issues impacting their community. #Txlege #Texas
@MegfromCT Austria, Brazil, and Argentina are among countries that allow citizens at age 16 to cast ballots. 		The U.S. has already lowered the age once. Fifteen states have already lowered the voting age to 17 for primary elections, where eligible voters will be 18 on election day.
Studies have shown that younger voters are more likely to become life-long voters and that when young people vote, they increase the voter participation among their parents.		We should lower the voting age to 16. #Txlege #Texas
The Texas School Board should strengthen civics education curriculum by including more rigorous project and action based learning in all required middle school and high school government classes to increase the number of informed and educated Texans.		#Txlege #Texas
Texas is a young state and so are its voters. 		On average over the next decade nearly 210,000 Latinos will turn 18, 95% of them are citizens eligible to vote. 		Additionally, by 2022, one in three voters will be under the age of 30. 		#Txlege #Texas

TX legislators should modernize the state‚Äôs voting system to make voter registration easier, and more cost effective. 		Texas should pass policies for automatic voter registration by which all eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote. 		#Txlege #Texas
Studies have found that a significant number of Americans don‚Äôt vote because they can‚Äôt make it to the polls due to conflicts with work or school.		We must make election day a national holiday and hold our elections on Sundays to ensure greater participation.		#Txlege #Texas
Texas leadership must commit to overturning recent legislation that makes it harder and more complicated to vote, and expand polling locations + voting hours.		#Txlege #Texas
Policymakers at the federal, state and local level must focus on introducing creative and smart policies that will help drive voter engagement, civic education, and build a stronger Texas. 		#Txlege #Texas
@danqdao @elainejgodfrey The change we seek won‚Äôt happen in one or even two election cycles. 		Both political parties and organizations must begin to invest heavily in Latinos, if they want to win the future of this country.

2016 was the hottest year on record and the 12 warmest years have all occurred over the past 20 years. 		This is a clear indicator of climate change. We must take immediate action that sets TX on track to achieve 100% renewable energy!
I‚Äôve had enough of the Democratic establishment warning candidates not to run on single-payer health care; or telling candidates to stop talking about abolishing ICE because it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúpoll well.‚Äù		Listen to the people.
Texas should allow undocumented immigrants to have drivers licenses. 		Hundreds of thousands of otherwise-qualified Texans are prevented from obtaining a license because of their immigration status. 		It's critical that Texas adopt proactive measures to protect immigrants.

Conservatives in Texas are holding hostage the future of millions of young people by failing to enact policies to tackle student debt, climate change, and DACA.
In 2016 Texas had the largest progressive voter gain, with 500,000 new progressive voters and the state came with in single digits of flipping (9%). 		2016 also saw the largest single gain in Latino voter turn out in the state‚Äôs history ‚Äî a 27% increase.
If your Latino campaign outreach consists of just one Spanish radio ad and one Spanish TV commercial ‚Äî you will lose the Latino vote.
During the last TX Legislative session we witnessed a bigoted minority enact some of the most draconian policies against communities of color, women, the LGBTQ+ community and immigrants in the country. 		Texans deserve better.
Remember in November: The Lone Star State led the attack to successfully pushed the Trump administration to rescind DACA.		Vote. Them. Out!
We must recognize that Texas is ground zero in the fight against extremist, anti-immigrant and anti-Latino hate.		Intimidation tactics and discriminatory laws only seek to threaten and criminalize us.
Be bold.  Be decisive.  	Be a leader. 		Our community needs strong representation that understands the demands of a new generation. 		Young people will always carry the burden of enlightening their families ‚ÄîMillennials, this is our time.

Growing up I was taught that being an immigrant meant, I didn‚Äôt just have to meet the standards  ‚Äî I had to surpass them. 		All my life I‚Äôve been working twice as hard, for half as much.
Latinos have been failed by both political parties. 		Manipulated and used only for political expediency. 		Enough! We demand change, opportunities, and respect.
If America is to remain a first-class nation, it cannot have second-class citizens.

@CajPaLa @NahkoBear That‚Äôs how it was intended to be read. I write music/poetry to distress.
Latino, Latina, and Latinx refers to people who have origins in Latin American countries, and unlike Hispanic this term includes Brazil and Haiti.
Hispanic refers to people who have origins in Spanish-speaking countries.		Ex: Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Cuba, Puerto Rico... etc
Instead of people sharing common physical features, Latinos and Hispanics share a national or cultural identity. 		In fact Latinos can identify with any race. 		In the 2012 census 53% of Latinos said they were white and 37% said they were of some other race.
Misconceptions between Latino and Hispanic. 		They are not terms that define race, like: Asian, Caucasian, or African-American.		Hispanic or Latino are terms that describe ethnicity. 		THREAD‚Üì

He visto el fondo, ahora estoy listo para la cima.
Psychologists who‚Äôve worked with immigrant youth said the records likely undercount the problems because many kids might not report abuse for fear of affecting their immigration cases.
That number doesn‚Äôt include another 200 such calls from more than a dozen shelters that also care for at-risk youth residing in the U.S. Call records for those facilities don‚Äôt distinguish which reports related to unaccompanied immigrants and which to other youth on the property.
The reports show that in the past five years, police have responded to at least 125 calls reporting sex offenses at shelters that primarily serve immigrant children.
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a predator, it‚Äôs a gold mine,‚Äù said Lisa Fortuna, director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Boston Medical Center. ‚ÄúYou have full access and then you have kids that have already had this history of being victimized.‚Äù		Re: detention centers for migrant children.
The more than 1,000 pages of police reports and logs detail incidents dating back to the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America in 2014 during the Obama administration.
On any given day, the shelters in 17 states across the country house around 10,000 adolescents.		‚Äîthousands of immigrant children, most of them teenagers, although last year 17 percent were under 13.

Most recently, Fleitz stoked fear of Michigan Muslims in particular, spreading a wild anti-muslim conspiracy theory on Breitbart that criminalizes Muslim communities.
Before the NSC, Fred had worked five years at a right-wing Islamophobic think tank known for promoting extremist conspiracy theories. He co-authored a report that argued that the government should deport American Muslims and strip them of their U.S. citizenship.

By continuing to misunderstand or undervalue this electorate, those who manage and advise political campaigns miss opportunities to register, engage, and persuade eligible Latino citizens to vote.
Stop underestimating the Latino vote. Invest heavily!
Many pundits and political operators continue to rely on a shallow understanding of the Latino electorate, and either act surprised when Latinos determine the outcome of an election, or ignore the lack of outreach and investment when these voters do not turn out.
Harris County, in Houston:		Democrats lost to Republicans by around a million votes in the 2012 presidential election. 		In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump by a mere 160,000 votes.
By 2022, Latinos will be the majority in Texas. 		Fifty percent of our vote is in the two largest cities, Dallas and Houston.

Donald has equated Mexican immigrants with vermin and has locked children in cages at the Texas border ‚Äî we must mobilize voters! 		If ever there were a moment for Texas to flip blue, it‚Äôs this one. Here. Now.

Our midterm elections are all about the American dream ‚Äî those who want to keep it for the few, and those who know it must be nurtured and passed along.
We can‚Äôt afford to devoted our resources into making this country a military colossus, while letting our economic lines of defense fall into disrepair. 		We need intellectual innovation, to prepare and creat the jobs of tomorrow not more guns, tanks, and bombs.
The GOP tells us that employment rates are great and that they're for equal opportunity, but we know that for many it takes two paychecks to make ends meet today, when it used to take one, and the opportunity they're so proud of is low-wage, dead-end jobs.
America must have leaders who show us that our struggles amount to something and contribute to something larger, leaders who want us to be all that we can be.
In America, Social Security is a pact that cannot be broken. 		Americans deserve peace of mind and to live without the terrible fear that an illness is going to bankrupt us and our children.
Our kids deserve good day care and public schools. I believe our kids deserve public schools where students can learn and teachers can teach.		Without being terrorized and traumatized.
I believe in an America that helps small-business owners succeed ‚Äì because they are the bedrock, and backbone, of our economy.
I believe that America can still be the country of fair play, where you can come out of a small town or a poor neighborhood and have the same chance as anyone else, and it doesn't matter whether you are Latino, black, gay, disabled or a woman.

Mu√±oz‚Äôs death occurred after the Trump administration began implementing its ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù crackdown on imigration, measures that include separating parents from their children and the threat of criminal prosecution for anyone who enters the United States unlawfully.
According to a copy of a sheriff‚Äôs department report obtained by The Washington Post, Mu√±oz was found on the floor of his cell May 13 in a pool of blood with an item of clothing twisted around his neck.
The death of Marco Antonio Mu√±oz, 39, has not been publicly disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security, and it did not appear in any local news.
A Honduran father separated from his wife and child suffered a breakdown at a Texas jail and killed himself in a padded cell last month, according to Border Patrol agents and an incident report filed by sheriff‚Äôs deputies.
#MarcoAntonioMu√±oz
Our nation must make a choice that lies not merely between two parties, but national greatness and national decline--between the fresh air of progress and the stale, dank atmosphere of "normalcy".		The world looks to see what we will do and we cannot fail their trust.
We are at a turning-point in history. 		We must prove all over again that our nation can endure--our society--with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives--can overcome oppression and injustice.
Our times demand new invention, innovation, imagination, decision. We must be the pioneers on this new and ever changing frontier. 		Be strong and courageous! Do not allow yourself to be terrified or intimidated by negative rhetoric.
It is time for a new generation of leadership--new men and women to cope with new problems and new opportunities. 		Leaders who are not bound by the traditions of the past--who are not blinded by old fears and hates and rivalries--who can cast off old delusions.
Today our concern must be with that future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. 		Old ways will not do.
As Texans we must do more than let out cries of indignation and attack - we must replace the leadership that has let us astray.		The times are too grave, the challenges too urgent, and the stakes too high‚Äîto permit the passions of political debate to drag us back to darker times.
The Americans fighting for their health care‚Äîthe families without a decent home--the parents of children without adequate food or schools--they all know that it's time for a change. 		The change starts at the voting polls - November 6th
It‚Äôs baffling how the GOP invokes the name of Abraham Lincoln on behalf of their candidates--despite the fact that more and more of their candidates often seemed to show charity toward none and malice for all.
It‚Äôs on us. We must protect the civil and economic rights essential to the human dignity of all men and women. 		Today. Tomorrow. Always.

Be careful who you open up to ‚Äî Only a few actually care, the rest are just curious.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
Treat me well and I'll treat you better.
Do not let the mistakes of yesterday get in the way of the opportunities that are being offered by the universe now.
Don't make excuses, make improvements.
Push the boundaries.
What you put up with you end up with, you can only expect what you accept.
It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.
Nunca digas no puedo: lev√°ntate, suspira, sonr√≠e, y sigue adelante.		Si luchas por lo que quieres, tarde o temprano, llegar√°.
Let your past make you better, not bitter.
Visualize the dream. The possibilities. The opportunity.
Your struggles develop your strengths.
Rise and shine‚Äî		Today grind harder than a molcajete!		 https://t.co/FBt55wVSkF

Failure is not falling down, it is not getting up again.
Don't chase after anyone. If they walk out, hold the door open.
Stop looking for the leader. 	Step up and fill the void.
Be the person every one said you couldn't be.
Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end.
He who shouts the loudest, might get heard first, but it‚Äôs the ones that speak softly to the heart, that get remembered.
While many people ponder about the beginning and end of life, I am more captivated by the space in between of endless possibilities.
When you win, say nothing. When you lose, say less. 		Let your actions speak. 	Show them - don‚Äôt tell them.
Take risks‚ÄîIf you win, you will be happy. If you lose, you will be wise!
Leadership is not a position or a title - it is example and action!
Don‚Äôt just meet the standard‚Äîsurpass it!
Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power.

TPS holders from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti live throughout the United States. 		Together, six states‚ÄîCalifornia, Florida, Texas, New York, Virginia, and Maryland‚Äîare home to about 70 percent of these #TPS recipients.
Salvadoran, Honduran, and Haitian #TPS beneficiaries live in nearly 206,000 households, about 30 percent of which have mortgages.
Many #TPS beneficiaries from El Salvador, Honduras, and Haiti have families in the United States. 		These families include approximately 273,000 native-born U.S.-citizen children.
The majority of Salvadorans and Hondurans with #TPS have lived in the United States for at least 20 years.
