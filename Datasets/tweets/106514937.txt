@MattGertz Ideally, the free agent service clock should start when a player is drafter, not when he reaches the majors. So teams lose the incentive to hold prospects back.
@MattGertz This is where I think the players union needs to make three demands: 1) free agency starts earlier; 2) teams need to have a minimum payroll; 3) teams that just miss the playoffs, not the teams with the worst records, should get the best draft picks.
Worth noting that @Heritage_Action is opposed to the spending deal but has NOT said it will be a Key Vote on the group's scorecard. https://t.co/jjE9PEMWrC
@CarlCannon Agreed. Teams aren't spending on veterans anymore, so I think free agency needs to start earlier and a minimum payroll should be implemented. I'm just specifically talking about the market for Harper and Machado and what's considered a "fair" offer for either of them.
@MattGertz I largely agree with you. My point is‚Äîwe don't know that there isn't a bidding war. We just know there has yet to be an offer Harper and Boras together think is worthy of him. If I found out Harper had been offered an 8-year, $250M deal, I wouldn't think, "The system is broken!"
I think MLB has a big problem and the current system is stacked against the players. But, hypothetically, what if Bryce Harper has an offer for $250M and Scott Boras won't take it because he thinks that's too low? Should we blame the owners for the impasse‚Äîor Boras?

So now the Lakers are stuck with this dysfunctional team: Veterans who are still pissed AND a group of young players who know they were offered in a trade. They‚Äôre bad this year, and it‚Äôs not clear any big free agent will want to join this mess next year. Nice job, everyone. /END
When the vets don‚Äôt get the time, they start complaining about Walton. THEN the Lakers decide they should offer every young player and a million picks for Anthony Davis, even though the Pelicans won‚Äôt trade him to the Lakers because they‚Äôre pissed about apparent tampering. 5/
Instead, in hopes of winning this season (I guess?), the Lakers add a bunch of mediocre veterans who expect to get playing time‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs really the young players (Ball, Ingram, Kuzma, Hart) who should get the time. 4/
The plan now should be to let the young core develop for a year and get used to LeBron and aim for adding another big free agent or two after this season, right? 3/
So they had a promising (if possibly underachieving) core of young players and a seemingly good young coach in Luke Walton, and they add LeBron James‚Äîbut not Paul George or anyone else big. Okay. 2/
Now that it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre not getting Anthony Davis today, it‚Äôs time for a rant about the #Lakers and just how thoroughly they‚Äôve screwed up the last year. 1/

The idea that tunnels like this will relieve traffic, especially in a city as big as LA, is nonsensical. There is no realistic math or volume that will make that happen. Seems far more likely this will be an opportunity for a small number of very wealthy people to avoid traffic.
And people will ride in driverless cars, not some fancy hyperloop. So each tunnel is basically the equivalent of adding a new one-lane road, except it's much less useful than a road because you can't enter or exit at different points.
So people will travel from point A to point B via a tunnel. Why, exactly, is this better than or different from a subway? It's faster because it has fewer stops, but you could do that with a subway too if you wanted. And the number of passengers is minuscule compared to a subway. https://t.co/zuDEI0dxWA
