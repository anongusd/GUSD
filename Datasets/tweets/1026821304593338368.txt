@peachyjew @edenmadremia Have you paid any attention to the UN??? Every single Resolution that involves Israel is vetoed by the US or they abstain and it passes and Israel just ignores it. They don‚Äôt make the effort to come to peace. They also voted no on allowing Palestine to be recognized in the UN.
@peachyjew @edenmadremia Because Gaza and West Bank are Palestine. Israel doesn‚Äôt care about either part of them and hasn‚Äôt bothered to sit down to discuss a compromise.
@RubyBrayton I never claimed you did support them or ridiculed you for doing so. I‚Äôm simply arguing from the original post that her argument about Hamas starting the conflict is factually incorrect and is irrelevant since neither side is willing to compromise.
@RubyBrayton I‚Äôd agree that Hamas is far from love. That‚Äôs my point. This conflict works both ways. It‚Äôll continue to exist so long as both sides result to violence.
@MrFilmkritik If you‚Äôre a true Democrat, you would‚Äôve done that anyways. Anyone not willing to do that should not be even considered for our party or party leadership.
@RubyBrayton The whole point of this thread was to point out that this fight works both ways. Israel will continue to see Hamas so long as they take over Palestine and not come to a compromise. Fight hate with love, as MLK Jr said.
@RubyBrayton You have no reason to be ridiculed if you‚Äôre not apart of the Israeli government. Standing up for a govt that commits war crimes is a credible reason to be ridiculed. Hence why I‚Äôve protested Trump and Hoyer for supporting the embassy relocation.
@edenmadremia @peachyjew Give me one resolution they actually abided by regarding settlements...I‚Äôll wait.
@RubyBrayton My exact view is that America has no business being an ally with a country that commits human rights abuses. I‚Äôm here to listen to the Israeli/Jewish perspective, but not defend the current state of Israel.

@RubyBrayton I agree that Hamas is doing more harm than good for sure. I find it hypocritical you‚Äôre trying to put me in my place for being an American atheist, yet you don‚Äôt treat other Americans on your side the same way who have nothing to do with the conflict.
@ZioCuck And some Jews reject Palestinians as a whole.
@SpeakerRyan The only reason why Romney made it was because he‚Äôs rich enough to move from MA and Mormon enough to earn their vote. How pathetic.
@ZioCuck They can ‚Äúgive up‚Äù whatever they want on paper. They never abide by it anyways. They still settled in the West Bank despite Oslo and other UN Resolutions.
@ZioCuck In one of the many treaties that were betrayed, the West Bank was supposed to be split up and the settlements were supposed to stop growing under Oslo. Israel STILL betrayed the deal and continues to settle there anyways. They also reject E. Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
@ZioCuck Both sides actually. Palestine has a right to reject deals that are one sided since it was their land that was conquered after WW1.
@peachyjew Are they not??? They are the only military sized force available. They are the governing body over Gaza whether we like it or not. The consistent fighting and lack of compromise caused Hamas to be established.

@peachyjew The current Israeli officials would rather have a 1 state Jewish theocracy. There are progressive secular Jews trying to combat the current state, but the Israeli government is far from transparent and has done everything in its power to silence progressive secularism.
@peachyjew The extremist Hamas group could've been prevented had Israel actually been at the open table for compromise with the Palestinians, with the UN as the moderator. Israel has made 0 effort into supporting a secular 1 state or a separate 2 state solution.
@peachyjew Hamas, regardless of their affiliation with extreme Shia beliefs, is the only body of force protecting and retaliating on behalf of Gaza residents. Their retaliation is to be expected, and because of a lack of compromise and peace, the fighting forces have resulted to extremism.

@mattbennett_22 Now, is a minimum wage needed? Definitely. And $7.25/hr is piss poor considering our economic status. Nationally I support a $10.10/hr minimum wage, taxes included. What also needs to be done is tax cuts for businesses that actually need it (not int‚Äôl conglomerates).
@mattbennett_22 A raise is chosen freely by the employer whereas a minimum wage is a mandate. A price floor mandate immediately changes the average total cost of whatever good you‚Äôre selling, inevitably raising prices across the board.
@mattbennett_22 Minimum wage doesn‚Äôt solve our problems though. The distribution of wealth does. If we want better wages we have to address the issue of money flowing to the stop and staying at the top first.

@RubyBrayton @RubyBrayton just for emphasis in case you didn‚Äôt see pt. 2 to my comment
@RubyBrayton I personally think it IS the problem because Zionism is the full fledged intention of claiming the Levant as the land for the Jewish community. The land belongs to no specific group. Jewish people are not ENTITLED to it and neither are Jihadists. We as humans live together.
@RubyBrayton We‚Äôre in mutual agreement that the star of David isn‚Äôt a sign of Zionism. Zionism is a political movement, not a religion. Our disagreement however is whether or not Zionism is rooted in imperialism.
@RubyBrayton However, after reading the whole thread, their argument against supporting them is really weak. A Star of David doesn‚Äôt equal Israel, it equals Judaism. But performing in Israel in my opinion is immoral when injustices against Palestine are made on the daily.

@ToddEberly The GOP also has yet to make it a priority to nominate someone to the Supreme Court that will end gerrymandering. If Democrats gave up every gerrymandered seat you‚Äôd only escalate the problem of voter suppression.
@ToddEberly The GOP strategically has more seats than the Democrats in Congress that are gerrymandered. As Democrats we have more to lose than they do, hence why the party is resistant to it until SCOTUS says otherwise. The GOP has made no national effort to campaign against it or end it.
@ToddEberly Voter suppression is caused by both parties. If Ben can work to lower voter suppression across state lines, both states‚Äô constituents benefit.

@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon It's called a general fund for a reason
@ryanwgregg @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Because $6 billion isnt enough for a state with an exploding population.
@addict_truth @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon They did legalize recreational cannabis so...yeah it is good ü§£üëå
@devrahall4ever2 Illegals cant purchase the expensive property in San Fran that we're discussing anyways, so they're irrelevant to the problem.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon The taxes on gas are so high because CA doesn‚Äôt get enough help from DC to help their infrastructure. If we had a better federal tax system we could afford more infrastructure projects without high local taxes.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon CA also uses proprietary fuel that no other states has that releases less carbon emissions.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Keep in mind the infrastructure desperately needs help so it does pay for all the roads. If you hate buying gas use mass transit. The tax acts as an incentive to use green energy instead. You should take a look at Italy‚Äôs gas tax...$8-10/gal at the pump.
@ryanwgregg @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon As stated before, housing costs have outpaced everything. Housing is a #1 priority for CA and will take major policy discussions to get to. The economy has grown so quickly that it can‚Äôt keep up. There is always a downfall to exploding business.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon China has the metals necessary to build phones. We don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs cheaper to build right next to the mines.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Again, America is no longer a manufacturing economy we‚Äôre a service based economy. Apple never could mass produce phones in the US if they wanted to. Ps, Mac Pros and iMacs are made in USA.
@ryanwgregg @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon overtaxing a trillion dollar business? üòÇJust that figure alone tells me they‚Äôve been avoiding taxes since day 1. And they have.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon I‚Äôm not here to tout CA is the epitome of perfect government. But what I‚Äôm pointing out is that CA is doing just fine economically and is an asset to the American economy as a whole, despite the belief that progressive policies RUIN everything. They don‚Äôt when done correctly.
@ryanwgregg @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Apple is the richest business on earth, and yet, still hasn‚Äôt moved. Again, it was an individual decision. Apple gets what it needs resource wise from CA while Toyota doesn‚Äôt. Two different business models.
@BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Normative vs. positive economic statements. It‚Äôs a policy idea worth looking into to help regulate the cost of housing.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Net neutrality PROTECTS capitalism from screwing itself over. A great example of how regulation helps competition, innovation, and productivity.
@BrettHershey @ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Regulation is great for the economy...when done correctly. For example, net neutrality forces all ISPs to treat online services equally. Netflix shouldn‚Äôt be forced to pay more just to get normal speeds or risk being throttled down so that they can be outcompeted.
@ryanwgregg @BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Toyota needs oil, land capital, and Human Resources. Each business evaluated what state best suited their needs. Some have different needs than others. You don‚Äôt see fisherman in Colorado do you? Of course not, they‚Äôre not near water. Every business is different.
@BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Again, that‚Äôs supply and demand. The companies are willing to pay that much so it drives the others up too. Chinese investors also are doing the same thing, and paying in cash. The real issue in my opinion is when a foreigner is buying property to shake up the system.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems I loved the McCain Feingold Act. Never should‚Äôve been struck down in the first place.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems No sense in doing that when public financing has already been proven to work for campaigns. Look at AU. Rich Madaleno was also a recipient of public financing. If a donor gave $10 the state matched it. Gives the incentive to listen to voters.
@ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon I also don‚Äôt know the budget details of CA. They might have budgeted these last few years to pay back debts with more than just interest payments before the surplus kicked in.
@ryanwgregg @BigDsuperFan @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Since I‚Äôm not a CA resident I‚Äôm not sure who to ask to answer that. A valid question though. However if I were apart of the Assembly, I most certainly would appropriate any surplus funds into paying back any loans the state has.
@BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Do you know if that was already accounted for in the budget, or did they spend that surplus on that program? There‚Äôs a huge difference if they budgeted for that before the surplus came in.
@WootpoolTheMad @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Purge CA, and you lose GDP and trade power. That‚Äôd be the dumbest thing America could ever do. Just because they‚Äôre not progressive doesn‚Äôt mean it makes economic sense to separate from them.
@devrahall4ever2 It‚Äôs a situation that I myself don‚Äôt have a solution for. I‚Äôm just now starting my freshman economics lessons for college. I hope that as I achieve my degree in economics, I can craft a policy idea to help the housing situation in major cities. That‚Äôs my goal.
@devrahall4ever2 What I just replied with was a positive statement, not a normative statement. Of course, housing SHOULD be affordable, but it isn‚Äôt easy to create policy that doesn‚Äôt hurt the economy in the long run by putting rent caps in place.
@devrahall4ever2 Housing prices have outpaced the ability to build more affordable housing. Most of the economic opportunity is in the city, and simple supply and demand has caused the prices to skyrocket. If you want to live close to work, you have to afford the luxury.
@BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon Housing costs have risen BECAUSE of simple supply and demand. It will take plenty of hard number crunching and detailed policy experience to find the best solution for CA residents that also benefit the landlords as well.
@BrettHershey @BigDsuperFan @ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon CA has outpaced itself, hence why there‚Äôs a ton of traffic. People are moving into the state at such high numbers the infrastructure can‚Äôt keep up.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems The person with the fattest checkbook shouldn't be the decision maker. All campaigns should be publically financed to eliminate conflicts of interest and corruption.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems Billionaires like the Walton Family are no more important than the working people of Walmart. The employees will never collectively outfinance the Walton's, therefore, the Walton's get policy priority for being big donors. I'm all for big government, so long as it works.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems Nikki, your dues went to a POLITICAL Action Committee. They spent that money on POLITICAL activism for equal pay for women. Unions not only help with collective bargaining, they help with lobbying for pro-labor initiatives. You got exactly what you paid for.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney @OurRevolution @justicedems Hmm...not really. Because there are more working people than there are investors in the nation. The economic policies investors want only support them and disenfranchise the middle and lower classes. This is why we need to end private financing of campaigns.

@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney While I would prefer Ben not take $ from ANY PAC whatsoever, I understand what's at stake and that he wants us to move in the direction of a public financing system, which I'm totally a fan of. At least he's getting support from PACs fueled by the people, and not a business.
@Nikkisuglytruth @BenJealous @StopBigMoney Unions get their PAC money from dues and donations from small donors, and not corporations shelling out 6-figure checks.

@ryanwgregg @yroCrekaB @KassyDillon That‚Äôs actually the quite opposite. The human capital in California and resources needed for fresh start ups are exploding in CA. Businesses are willing to pay more in taxes because of the economic opportunity of what CA offers geographically, demographically, and more.
