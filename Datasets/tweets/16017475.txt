There's a certain kind of sophomoric reaction to the length of Bryce Harper's contract. Like, people wouldn't balk at 10-years, $330m, or even 9 years, $330m. So 13 years, $330m is just gravy on top of that, even if it's "too long".

Despite Trump in 2016, endorsements still have a pretty good track record at predicting the nominee, at least when the party is able to achieve consensus around a single choice. https://t.co/ckuKLfZzON https://t.co/SOLzKfVjeF
So far, Booker, Klobuchar and Harris have the most endorsements, but they're almost all from people within their state. In other words, it's very early. It's interesting who *isn't* getting endorsed, though. Gillibrand doesn't have any. Bernie has more than Warren.
That's right, folks: We've started tracking **endorsements** again in 2020.		Not just governors and members of Congress this time, but: Mayors! State legislative leaders! DNC members! And more! Everyone gets an endorsement!		See an endorsement we've missed? Drop us a line.
Booker 53	Klobuchar 39	Harris 38	Sanders 18	Warren 17	Castro 12	Biden 6	Delaney 6	https://t.co/gOZT46mEd9
There are times when I'm tempted to say the Booker/Warren/Klobuchar group of candidates is underrated. I suppose I do think their chances are a bit underrated, on balance. But they're in the slow lane, whereas Harris &amp; Sanders are in the fast lane. That counts for something IMO.
I guess I think it's noteworthy that Harris and Bernie had a pretty big surge in polls &amp; other metrics post-announcement, whereas Booker/Warren/Klobuchar didn't gain as much traction, and it's not clear that Gillibrand/Castro gained any traction at all.
There was a time when Beto was surging toward 2nd/3rd in the polls. Then a bunch of other candidates declared, he didn't and fell back. But if he's running &amp; again get a lot of media attention, will he bounce back? Maybe. Also a good chance to raise the most $ of the non-Bernies.
They might be but I also think the gamblers have a bit of recency bias, i.e. candidates who declared/made news more recently tend to be overrated relative to those who are out of the spotlight. And reporters/pundits/analysts have even more recency bias than the gamblers do. https://t.co/gQQdQvaRPq
So if he "clicks" — if he's a top-tier candidate — we'd probably know it sooner rather than later. That's not to say he'd be completely out of the running if he didn't get that initial surge, but it would be as more of a 2nd- or 3rd-tier candidate IMO.
Obviously, *all* Democrats want that stuff. But I see the attachment to Beto as being more…not quite sure how to put it…momentum-driven and emotional than for most of the other Dems. He's certainly not the most well-credentialed candidate or the deepest thinker about policy.
With Beto, more so than any other Democratic candidate, I'd be curious how his metrics move within the **first few weeks** after his announcement. Does he surge in the polls? Get a bunch of money? Endorsements? Staff? Media attention?
It seems like 90% of the people (there *are* some exceptions I can think of) who were urging Beto to run for Senate mostly just didn't want him to run for president because he could take the nomination from a more liberal candidate.

The only candidate for whom this discussion is really even worth having is for Sherrod Brown, who would literally cost the Democrats a Senate seat (although only for 2 years) if he became POTUS/VPOUTS. With everyone else, it's a rounding error.
Especially since a strong presidential candidate would tend to produce coattails up and down the ballot that would help Democrats in literally every other race.
If [Candidate X] would increase the Democrats' chances of winning the presidency by say 2 percentage points, but increase the chance of winning **one Senate seat** by say 10 percent, Democrats should strongly prefer them to run for president, not Senate.

Maybe you can add 2nd, 3rd, etc. gap years too, but they'd require mutual agreement by the team and the player. Or maybe you automatically get a 2nd gap year for non-lottery picks. There are a lot details, but in the abstract it seems workable.
e.g. the Hawks draft R.J. Barrett out of high school. They can opt to delay his NBA debut for 1 year in exchange for paying him half his rookie-scale salary for that year. During the gap year, he can play in college, the G League, internationally, work with a trainer, whatever.
If college basketball wants to save itself, it seems like you could design a system where players get drafted by NBA teams at age 18 but can take a "gap year" where they play in college for a year or two in and also get big payouts in the event of injury.
@Herring_NBA He also has trouble going to his right.

@davidshor @MattGrossmann I don't know off-hand but they definitely treat the Rand Paul / Justin Amash types differently, e.g. as showing that they have relatively low party unity.
@davidshor @MattGrossmann: Using party unity scores, I show a pretty substantial effect from extremism even in recent elections. It's complicated because PVI, incumbency and extremism are interrelated in some tricky ways. But I think I have a reasonably robust approach.
Those aren't hugely delegate-rich areas. But it does mean that Bernie will have to hit his marks in his other strong areas, e.g. New England and the Upper Midwest. He and Klobuchar, although very different ideologically, are fighting for some of the same geographic territory.
Will have more on this later, but Bernie's coalition is likely to be a bit different geographically in 2020, with the #NeverHillary vote divided between several different candidates. In particular, #NeverHillary voters helped him in Appalachia, and in the Western caucus states.

@ComfortablySmug This meme seems to be suggesting that Castro, Klobuchar or Brown will be the Democratic nominee—they can fly away from the carnage. That's why there are lots of pterodactyls (birds) today even though there aren't any dinosaurs.
There are about a zillion ways this could play out. But, yeah, I do think about this scenario specifically. Where you have a rough three way divide between (1) Warren or Bernie (2) Harris or Booker (3) Klobuchar or Biden or Beto. https://t.co/OVAbx5u4ew
But there are a lot of things that are more difficult than 4 years ago, by far the most obvious of which is that there's *much* more competition, including specifically on the left. At 77, his age is a bigger concern. And there are fewer caucuses than in 2016.
In some ways, the question is: if Bernie just did what he does 4 years ago, will it work? The optimist's case would be pretty Occam's Razor-y: 		He was 2nd place last time—and the 1st-place candidate isn't running. And the party is moving to the left. So…why not?
What I've grown pessimistic about is his ability to unite the different factions/coalitions of the Democratic Party. He doesn't seem that interested in doing so, and polling shows he's a tough sell for some Ds. That's how nominations are *usually* won, through coalition-building.
IMO the viable path probably involves the field remaining relatively divided. In that scenario, his high and loyal floor of support, his $$$ (powered by small donors), his experience (may be only 2020 candidate to have run before) with delegate rules etc, could be big advantages.
One year-ish ago, I thought Sanders was the frontrunner in a crowded Democratic field, but since then I've grown more pessimistic about his chances. I don't want to overcorrect too much though and think he still has a viable path.

But that is just a guess. There's considerably deeper GOP opposition on this than on most issues.
The key Q is: how many in the "concerns"/"doubts" group would vote against Trump with the chips on the line? Or guess is not very many. Thus, there are probably the votes to force Trump to veto, but not enough for a veto override.
We're missing positions from 4 Republicans.		Hyde-Smith (MS), not in our original story, supports the declaration, her office says. Not sure about Blackburn (TN), Burr (NC), Enzi (WY), Ernst (IA).

@MattGlassman312 @ForecasterEnten @jbview Yeah, that's right -- I'm trying to distinguish 1 from 2.
@allahpundit I mean, I agree that there are only about ~10 "likely no"s. But there also aren't that many solid yesses. Maybe another 20 or so in the undecided/"concerned" category.

Opposition, "concerns" and "still reviewing"/uncertain are all quite different categories, and saying you had concerns in January doesn't necessarily mean you'd vote against the president now with McConnell (presumably?) whipping votes. But still... not a slam dunk.
Are we sure that there wouldn't be a *veto-proof* majority in the Senate to void Trump's national emergency declaration? Just going through local news accounts, there are a *lot* of Republican Senators who have expressed opposition or concerns or uncertainty.

Feel like I've written this piece a bunch of times before, but Trump's base-centric strategy is probably not smart. And he didn't learn any lessons from the midterms or the shutdown. https://t.co/i0aq4kPSfm
@yashar @NBCNews I've seen it reported both ways but the $65,000 doesn't make much sense so I'm assuming the other way is right.

https://t.co/eBZQ1iF4d4
But the big takeaway is that Trump continues to overestimate the importance of his base vs. the rest of the country.		Trump instigated a shutdown to placate his base, his approval rating fell by 3-4 points. Shutdown ends, he concedes to Pelosi, and he's already regained 2 points. https://t.co/4QBP6rNjDH
Declaring a national emergency would be a *very* unpopular step.		It's unclear whether it would fade into the background as it got tied up in the courts, or would remain a salient issue for some time.
In fact, I think you can argue the deal fell apart because the stakes were *low*. Amazon is probably pretty indifferent between NYC and its other alternatives for HQ2.		Meanwhile, the tax subsidies offset a lot of the ancillary benefits for NYC, so it was pretty indifferent too.
Ehh, I'm not sure that this boils down to communications strategy. The arguments for why this would be a huge win for NYC weren't particularly persuasive. Despite this, the proposal was fairly popular. https://t.co/cnZ43B5LOH

@ForecasterEnten Zzzzzzzzzz boring tweet
He also preserves a little bit of optionality on the Senate race as he can run for POTUS and switch lanes if he wants, a la Rubio in 2016.		In sum, it's arguably in Democrats' best interest for Beto to run for Senate but it's probably in Beto's best interest to run for president.
Conversely, PredictIt gives him a 15-20% chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination, conditional upon his running. And my guess is that he'd be about equally likely to end up on the ticket as the VP candidate.
Beto would have an, IDK, 20-25% (?) chance to beat Cornyn? Cornyn isn't likely to be as unpopular as Cruz, and 2020 isn't likely to be as blue nationally as 2018 was. Texas is getting more purple but overall it's probably a tougher race than 2018 was. https://t.co/gV2PkVjKLw

@jbview @ForecasterEnten Suppose he'd been from Arizona rather than Texas, served 3 terms in Congress from a border district, ran for Senate last year and beat McSally by (2? 5? 10?) points. Would he have the same credentials issue just because he was so new to the Senate?
@jbview @ForecasterEnten Obviously it would be different if he was just a 3-term member of Congress with a limited profile. But he ran very strongly in that Senate race. I guess I'm saying you could treat him as a "Senator equivalent".
@jbview @ForecasterEnten See that's the thing I don't think 1-in-7 is really that high, in a field where the next-in-line candidates (Biden, Sanders) are pretty underwhelming.
@jbview @ForecasterEnten I'd say:	1. He outperformed most of those winners despite losing his race.	2. A lot of ex-Obama people just think he's uniquely talented/skilled.	3. There's an opening for a relatively moderate candidate if Biden is weak or doesn't run. https://t.co/5r5SpbhfeF
@jbview @ForecasterEnten There will—and should be—lots of questions about his experience level and degree of policy expertise. Having lost the Senate race will undercut his claims to electability, although he can (rightly) claim he ran strongly relative to the typical Democrat in Texas.
@jbview @ForecasterEnten I dunno. Beto has high-ish name recognition, obviously knows how to raise money, seems to have the makings of support from party elites, and has run in a very high-profile statewide race before. So I'm not sure what he's missing that a Generic Democratic Senator has.
@mattyglesias @ForecasterEnten Yeah that's a good way to put it. Clearly the Kamala train has left the station. But there are a lot of operatives/"party elites" milling about trying to figure out who else has a ticket out of town.
@ForecasterEnten Yeah, if you look at his favorables, they haven't moved at all. Which, on the one hand, means he's lost time to build name recognition. But on the other hand, means the stories that politics twitter talks about don't really register with regular voters.
The PredictIt price (~15%) is about where I'd have him. Which is why I'm not sure I can claim he's underrated. I do think people overrate how much has really changed over the past month or 2, other than (and this is a very important exception) Kamala Harris having gained ground. https://t.co/9upCMm4WUS
Semi-tempted to write a "Beto's chances are underrated" article but I'm not sure whether I actually believe or would just be trolling people.
The "right" way to do it is pretty labor-intensive, e.g. you should probably directly be comparing candidates' stances on the same issues by looking at their platforms/speeches/websites, as well as by looking at which issues they emphasized.
(Whispers: All of the statistical measures that people use to measure candidate ideology are pretty mediocre for detecting shifts in ideology across time.)
@OsitaNwanevu I guess I'd also say: the field is pretty diverse so far, so it's hard to imagine you wouldn't wind up with a diverse ticket. But there are a LOT of straight white men who going to declare later. (It's interesting that they get to sit back and wait while others already running.) https://t.co/6H2oQWgFSl
@OsitaNwanevu I'd be interested in your thoughts too. I guess my thinking is that precisely because that's what we got in 2016, it's hard to rule it out for 2020.		Maybe it matters, though, that a woman was at the *top* of the ticket in 2016.
p.s. Here are my working assumptions about the racial and gender dynamics of the Democratic ticket. These could be wrong, obviously.		—The ticket probably won't be two white men.	—The ticket probably won't be two women.	—The ticket probably won't be two people of color. https://t.co/uZHyUuSeKW

This is also a sign that the supposed next-in-line candidates, Biden and Bernie, are weak frontrunners. They haven't been able to deter anyone else from running. Although, the chaos of a large field could ultimately be helpful to Bernie, who probably has a high floor/low ceiling.
@ForecasterEnten Pretty good, I think I'm rooting for a brokered convention like you root for snowstorms.

@jimtankersley @conncarroll Yeah, that's fair. Although, the conclusion that players peak at ~27 is not an especially new finding.
@jimtankersley Maybe there was a sweet spot ~10 years ago or so where half the teams valued OBP/defense and half the teams valued HR/RBI, and that transition period resulted in very rich valuations for free agents.
@jimtankersley If teams value, say, OBP and defense more than they used to and HR/RBI less, that should transfer money from the HR/RBI guys to the OBP/defense guys, but shouldn't reduce the overall amount spent on free agents.
@DamonLinker @jeffguhin @willwilkinson This is actually a pretty straightforward application of Bayes' Theorem. If Model A gives Trump a 30% chance and Model B gives him a 1% chance, and Trump wins, it's almost certain that Model A was right and Model B was wrong.
That is to say, has the more widespread adoption of analytics led to more uniformity in MLB player valuation, or more heterodoxy? You could probably argue the case either way. Interestingly, though, there are more trades than there once were, which might suggest more heterodoxy.
I'm not sure this agent's theory makes much sense. In the abstract, if all teams value players the same way, that would reduce the winner's curse and thereby lower free agent prices. But that's not about analytics per se. https://t.co/IkVv7D93zD

Overall, it's a fairly linear path. The first step is the debates, where her campaign thinks she'll do well as a former prosecutor who can be funny, etc. The second step is Iowa.

@katherinemiller It's a little hard to figure out Booker's positioning. To the extent he tries to elbow his way onto the beer track with a big play for Iowa, it could be problematic for Klobuchar.
Everything about her campaign revolves around the Midwest. Electability is a big asset. So is proximity to Iowa. She's liable to run as a "beer track" candidate, drawing contrasts with more liberal "wine track" candidates from the coasts. (p.s.: Beto is on the "craft beer track")
Also how she could lose it. But I think she's a pretty good candidate.
Here's my analysis of how Amy Klobuchar could win the nomination: https://t.co/HxjWGkuVzp
@DavidLauter Well, there haven't been a lot of women running for president until recently. So the sample size isn't huge. And it certainly happens to male politicians too. My (possibly wrong) intuition though is that it happens with greater frequency to women.
I dunno. I guess you could study this systematically and someone probably should. It does seem like when women are running, the threshold is lower for controversies that are deemed to overshadow a campaign, e.g. Warren/DNA, Gillibrand/Franken, Klobuchar/staff (or Hillary/email).
The allegations (of mistreatment of staff) are certainly newsworthy; they're also a long way from a Richter magnitude 8 type of scandal. So I'm also a little wary of the framing that Klobuchar's launch has been sidetracked or overshadowed.
It's sort of weird that this is framed as an unfortunate accident of timing. The stories are coming out because Klobuchar is running. If she were declaring in March instead of February, they'd have come in March instead of February too.	https://t.co/00K9uKNc55 https://t.co/jQS3TTHQDu

p.s. I do find it helpful to talk to campaigns, especially at this early stage when the data isn't too meaningful. So if you work for a presidential candidate and we haven't set up a channel of communications yet, please do drop me a line — I'm pretty easy to find.
There's also this weird thing where for years, there were too few left-wing voices in media and moderate/centrist Democratic perspectives were grossly overrepresented. Now maybe we've come full circle where media coverage tends to underestimate the number of moderate Democrats.
Most of the action so far has been in the leftmost half of the field from candidates on the coasts. But there's another group that's more moderate, usually Midwestern or Southern, who will heavily emphasize retail politics (i.e. Iowa). Not many in the race from that group yet.
FWIW, I do think Beto would have been better off declaring sooner (in January or even December). *And* I think he hasn't used the intervening time well. But as I've thought about it more (and done a little bit of talking to people) I'm less convinced it's a huge problem. https://t.co/e4wTFNUBpJ

@mattyglesias Most of the editorial choices you and I would object to are the result of: (1) the desire for ratings/clicks/revenues, (2) the belief that the appearance of evenhandedness is in the long-run interest (economic and otherwise) of the news brand.
@mattyglesias OK, but to a first approximation, those people are trying to facilitate the economic interest of the **news brand/network** rather than their own economic interests.
@mattyglesias Instead, decision-making power is fairly diffuse, with editors/producers of varying levels of seniority having lots of agency. So "culture" matters a lot. When higher-ups get directly involved, it's usually to protect the of the brand in the midst of big controversies.
@mattyglesias Having worked for several of these giant mainstream media organizations, I think you're significantly overestimating how much influence e.g. the President of the Network or the Owner of the Newspaper has over daily editorial decisions.

That is, provided that they re-sign everyone (Harris/Butler). But it's not right to say Harris has no value because he's an expiring contract. You get his Bird Rights, so you can sign him to a $30-$35m max-ish deal instead of having ~$15m in cap space to spend on someone else.
Reactions to the 76ers trade more bearish than I was last night. I think people may be neglecting the wrinkle below. Basically—by acquiring Harris's Bird Rights when his salary is about to increase—the trade enables Philly to spend an additional ~$15-20m on payroll going forward. https://t.co/xYzY1RZqmk
The key is that *if* you don't care about how much you're spending and just want to win an NBA title, you generally either want to (a) have cap space or (b) be way over the cap. This is Philly transitioning from (a) to (b) and trying to avoid getting stuck in between.
This is one of the more obvious win-win trades in a while IMO, although a lot more high-leverage for the 76ers than the Clippers. It does imply the Sixers are willing to carry a very high payroll.
Per our numbers, this trade roughly doubles the Sixers' chances of reaching the NBA Finals this year, from ~10% to ~20%. https://t.co/YmTGcmyTEs https://t.co/kQmd8ce6Rt

Lakers had a 27% chance of the playoffs before tonight assuming—big caveat—no further roster changes. Maybe they should tank. Not a full tank.

RT @FiveThirtyEight: The team, with the best record in the league, is taking more threes and more shots at the rim. https://t.co/wWkxafiJb8
That just takes so much value off the table. If their development had been on track, then say Lonzo + Ingram + one 1st would have been a pretty fair offer for Davis. Maybe the Pelicans squeeze one more asset out, maybe even 2, but the trade happens &amp; everyone feels pretty good.
I should do the math on this more precisely, but the reduction in long-term expected value from Lonzo + Ingram (combined) works out to something like $35m in cap space per year, i.e. it's basically like losing a max-level player.
IMO the whole key to the Anthony Davis saga is that, per our numbers, both Ball and Ingram have played to only the ~10th or 20th percentile of their preseason projections. They've stagnated, maybe even regressed, in a year when they were supposed to show a lot of development.

People should keep this in mind when they hear folks getting all smarmy about policy vs. horse race coverage. https://t.co/eDgO1eZPt5
One interesting dynamic here is that the liberal policy position is quite popular among a fairly broad range of social and economic topics, but if a voter deviates from the liberal position on *either* social or economic policy, they tend to vote Republican. https://t.co/xGBO4b0g7c
There are a lot of caveats and complications, including that attitudes on race tended to outweigh other social issues. Also, voting coalitions could be different in 2020, with or without Schultz! But these liberatarian-ish voters were a bit Trump-leaning last time.
This article looks at what happens if you pair a fiscally conservative view (i.e. repeal ACA) with a socially liberal view (i.e. support gay marriage). For the most part, if the voter held *both* positions—which is around 15% of the electorate—they were more likely to vote Trump. https://t.co/Gnnpqk70q8
Who did socially liberal, fiscally conservative voters—i.e. the potential Schultz vote—prefer in 2016?	Well, it's kinda close but the answer is 	T-R-U-M-P.	https://t.co/40pTRpfo33

This is most obvious in the case of Boston. If I'm them, I don't trade Tatum unless I get a long-term commitment from Davis. But if I'm AD, I don't commit to a Celtics team without Tatum, which might be very good but has a lot of moving parts.
I guess this is obvious but the big problem with a lot of these Anthony Davis offers is that the more you give up for Davis, the less attractive you make yourself as a long-term option for Davis.
@HotlineJosh But, bro, we want to look at the *change* in ratings to see how much the scandal affected things. The absolute level of approval/disapproval bakes in all types of other noise. The question is "how strongly to partisans react to scandal?", so you'd use the change to measure that.
The Post-ABC poll you cited was also conducted about a week after the tape was out. Which is a lot more time for voters to react. So, let's see what Northam's numbers are like later this week. But so far, based on a true apples-to-apples comparison, the numbers contradict you.
Trump was at a 77/22 among Republicans in the last Morning Consult poll before the tape (https://t.co/9NmLnaozL3), and declined only to a 72/27 (https://t.co/CFiyBkqNw1) in the poll they conducted immediately afterward.
If you want to be apples-to-apples, we should probably use polls from the same pollster (Morning Consult) rather than having you cherry-pick. And their polls found little change in Republican support for Trump after the Access Hollywood tape. https://t.co/RYAchf8hwK
Also, the fact that he went from 70/7 among Democrats to 50/25 in 72 hours?
Have you look at Trump's approval rating among Republicans, bro? https://t.co/7yrIeBKf17
Part of it is the scandal is bad enough that it's hard to imagine him having any kind of public life if he leaves. Which, world's smallest violin. Except, he has 3 years left on his term &amp; the media loves a comeback story. So he's not crazy to think he can rehabilitate his image.
We ended up killing a podcast segment on Northam because the story was changing too fast (we'll revisit later this week). But I had a take pretty similar to this. It's not obvious how you get Northam to resign. https://t.co/UiWcpfWZoe

@NickRiccardi @BenjySarlin 3) might be more-or-less a permanent feature of the American political landscape. But 1/1b/2 were pretty lucky. If Trump runs against Biden and loses by 6 or 7, would anyone think his immigration focus worked well in the general election?
@NickRiccardi @BenjySarlin I dunno Trump was really unpopular and won despite it. He benefitted a lot from 1) Hillary's unpopularity 1b) especially given the focus on emails/Comey 2) the Electoral College and 3) partisan loyalty among Republicans.
@NickRiccardi @BenjySarlin Meh, I think it's a good reason to think that immigration policy is badly overrated as a reason for Trump's general election win and may well have been a net negative for him.

@IChotiner Yeah, they're all pretty compatible. And maybe the Lakers can keep Hart, who would be a pretty good fit there too.
@IChotiner 2019 Kyrie, who gets steals and rebounds and assists and sort of tries on defense, is a *really* good player. Also, the rest of the Lakers roster would be execrable, so having 3 high-usage guys might not be so bad.
@PatrickRuffini It was nowhere near 300:1 against, whoever did that is incompetent. From eyeballing our forecast it looks like Trump had like a 5:1 or 6:1 chance against winning as many electoral votes as he did.
Been listening to too many basketball podcasts but it sure does feel like LeBron+AD+Kyrie in LA is a path of comparatively little resistance to a superteam. I also wonder whether that would the best "Big 3" of all time (I think maybe yes).
@jbarro That indeed seems like it's arrogant and not merely naive, though? Especially since he doesn't really seem to have put much work into his campaign?
This is a good litmus test.

Harris is also the only Democrat with a material number of endorsements. She's probably the frontrunner at this point, folks. I don't mean she's the odds-on favorite, because there isn't one, but I think you can argue to rank her a half-tier above the other leading contenders.

@DouthatNYT @jonathanchait I'll have a piece later this week that presents some evidence that economic views still have more influence on voting behavior. But it's certainly debatable. I do think the further to the left the Democratic nominee, the more likely Schultz is to *help* the Democrat.
@jonathanchait I'm saying a voter who thinks Bernie is a bridge too far on economics but that Trump is a little racist is probably more likely than not to vote Trump, especially if they're personally well-off and the economy is good. So Schultz could drain their votes and help Bernie.
Gonna be ironic when Schultz is responsible for electing Bernie Sanders because well-off, mocha-drinking suburbanites who would otherwise vote their class interest are able to vote for Schultz instead of Trump. https://t.co/mXDtplIqnE
Schultz's answer here reminds me of when you get stuck on a plane, or at a party, talking with a guy* who learns you cover politics for a living and thinks he's knows his shit when he's just spouting cliches.		*Always a guy. Often older and wealthy, but not always. https://t.co/iLMjcK8K11
* Or almost any or the Democrats, really, pretty much all of whom could formulate some rather obvious contrasts based on age, race, gender and/or class.
The other thing about Schultz, and why it's weird that people are so certain he'd help Trump, is that folks aren't really thinking about what it would look like to have, say, Kamala Harris* on a debate stage against two old billionaires arguing for rollbacks to the welfare state.
@jbarro Also some issues in terms of what credentials he has to be taken seriously as a presidential candidate. I'd feel differently if he'd shown any commitment to public life beyond running Seattle's NBA team out of town.
@jbarro There's definitely a lot of time. And I'm certainly not one of those scolds who thinks there's anything inherently wrong with horse race coverage. But I do think there are some issues here in terms of the incentives the media creates, especially since he's trying to sell books.
@NickRiccardi Well, we're all making guesses. And those guesses can be wrong, obviously. But I think the threshold should be higher to cover someone like Schultz, who's coming from a position of power/privilege, who's never run for office, and who furthermore is getting publicity for his book.
No he wouldn't. Or at least, we need to see the proof that he'd have some impact. If you polled Schultz right now, I don't think he'd poll above a replacement-level "someone else"/ "an independent" candidate. https://t.co/yUL2RRtqLb
Yeah, I disagree	1) Not clear how likely he is to actually run and 1b) stay the course;	2) Not clear how he gets an appreciable fraction of the vote;	3) Not clear he'd play a spoiler role—contra the CW, he's probably about equally likely to draw from either major party candidate. https://t.co/Gfi3EDCwPH
Saying "Howard Schultz can't win" is not the same as saying "centrist independents can't win". The odds would be strongly against e.g. John Kasich but (notwithstanding that he's not really a centrist or an independent) he'd be an order of magnitude more viable than Schultz. https://t.co/yAkqxmXBgt
Not only are Schultz's ideas unoriginal, but they already tend to receive more coverage than they "should" based on their salience with the general population, because they're the sorts of ideas held disproportionately often by rich and powerful people.
At the risk of being hypocritical—we'll have a couple of articles on him this week—what's the journalistic case for providing heavy coverage of Schultz? He's not remotely likely to win. He's not especially well-known or popular. And he doesn't really have any interesting ideas.
This, also. Frankly, I'm not sure whether Howard Schultz or Pete Buttigieg is more likely to become president. I'd probably say Buttigieg if pressed. And at least he's held public office before and isn't too chickenshit to run in a party's primary. https://t.co/UsYLdcB9VK
As a related aside, part of what IMO comes across poorly about Beto's soul-searching/Hamlet act is that his credentials are a little light. If you think you have a case for being president despite that fairly limited experience, get in there and hustle for it.
@DougPolkPoker @JustinBonomo Love the Trump/Jamie Gold comp.
It's a tough question. You could in theory look at stuff like polling to determine how much to cover a candidate, but that's sort of a catch-22: a candidate usually won't register in polls until and unless he/she gets some media coverage.
One thing we discussed on the pod this week is what role the media plays in deeming candidates to be viable, or not.

If Trump wants to win re-election he should fire anyone who told him that the shutdown helped him. https://t.co/SFA4ey0aRS
People who have Schultz's views on fiscal policy but (also like Schultz) liberal views on e.g. gun control or abortion or immigration were, generally speaking, more likely to vote for *Trump* than Clinton in 2016. Will have more on that later this week.
That stands in contract to someone like Bloomberg, who, as he's evolved, has both de-emphasized economic issues (relative to social issues) and whose views on economic policy have moved from conservative to fairly moderate.
Part of the thing I think people are screwing up about Schultz is that "let's slash entitlement programs to balance budgets" really is a fiscally *conservative* position in the context of 2019/2020. It's not only (way) to the right of the Democrats, it's to the right of Trump!
@SeanTrende Also, building a model to estimate what people's 2nd choice would have been is a deeply weird thing when you can just ask them directly via a poll.
This is a very #OnBrand hot take from me (I made my living playing poker for a couple years in the mid-00s) but I think the analogy works. Trump quite literally reminds me of a losing poker player who overestimates his ability and constantly puts himself in no-win positions.

What are the odds that Trump starts threatening the air traffic controllers? I say less than even money, but they can't be that long. Jared Kushner probably thinks it's a good idea.
This kinda sounds like McConnell saying "we can do it the easy way or the hard way." The easy way being that Trump finds some semblance of a fig leaf to reopen the government. The hard way being assembling veto-proof majorities for a continuing resolution as ATC delays cascade. https://t.co/U9bIODbFeQ
The other key thing is that this seems to be semi-coordinated. The air traffic controllers are basically saying that time's up. https://t.co/WlJ5cJS4aI https://t.co/POU5wpbxvE
Seems like people are getting some of the technical details wrong of what it means to have a ground stop, etc.		But the broader point is obvious: the shutdown is starting to cause massive disruption to the air transit system. Equally obvious: It will get worse.
That's not to say he can't win (I actually think his chances might be a bit underrated on Twitter since it's not really his constituency) but the rationale for his candidacy feels a bit stale post-midterm/shutdown.
I think Biden 2020 would have benefited from a Democratic flight to safety after a bad midterm. Instead they had a good midterm, and the shutdown has been a disaster for Trump, and it's not a party that's in the mood for caution. https://t.co/RupwzXMVp3

This really makes it look like a clean CR is the path of least resistance, rather than the compromise/"compromise". Not really sure what McConnell was hoping to accomplish here, unless he wants Trump to give up.
The Democratic bill to re-open the government has 6 GOP yeas. (Alexander, Gardner, Isakson, Murkowski, Collins, Romney). So looks like it will get 52 votes beating the GOP bill, which apparently got 50 rather than 51 on the final tally. Neither one will get 60.
Who could have predicted that Jared Kushner's plan wouldn't work, except literally everybody who isn't Jared Kushner or Mike Pence. https://t.co/tD2QCMpiaC https://t.co/XkF5rJF4pN
Cruz voted "aye", so Cotton and Lee were the only GOP nos. Manchin the only Democratic yes. So the Trump compromise (or "compromise" if you prefer) fails 51-47 (needed 60 votes).
Lee also a "no". Cruz hasn't voted yet and you wonder if he wants to vote "no" too. McConnell probably pushing to keep the yeas at &gt;=50. https://t.co/mygSxUlq8s

This tweet will have an audience of like 4 people, but I think that NBA fans should use "nonwilt" as an adjective to describe records including everybody except Wilt Chamberlain, in the same way that economists use the term "nonfarm" to describe all jobs except farming jobs.
Harden would have to average 41.3 PPG, and play in every remaining game, to beat Jordan's 1986-87 record for Non-Wilt *points* in a season (3,041). Jordan played in all 82 games in 1986-87 whereas Harden has already missed 3. Quite a bit harder but not sure I'd bet against him.
James Harden would have to average 38.1 PPG for the rest of the year to beat Michael Jordan's record for PPG In A Season By A Guy Not Named Wilt Chamberlain. (37.1 in 1986-87). That's starting to look quite doable.

To be fair, when Parscale made that brag, Trump's approval was down by only 1 or 1.5 points in our tracking. Now, his approval rating is down ~3 points (to a new low of 39.3) and disapproval up by ~4. So it's gotten harder to find outliers that show him improving vs pre-shutdown.
It's certainly possible he was being truthful. But if so he was bragging about an outlier, which usually doesn't end well. https://t.co/L44ATCFqxj
Although some of the Beto attacks have been dumb. Like the one about how he once played in a band and wore funny/furry costumes. The live-blogging thing really did raise concerns about his self-awareness and judgment (IMO); unlike the others, was sort of a self-inflicted wound.
This is right, IMO. Pelosi shouldn't have cited security concerns as a reason for disinviting Trump from giving the SOTU. It would have sent a stronger message just to say she wouldn't pretend it was business-as-usual with the government shut down. https://t.co/5vcx41HYzz
I'm pretty sure that left-of-center Twitter *can* tell you something about the Democratic primary and is more or less an example of "party elites" deciding. But there's also a probably-wrong-but-not-crazy hypothesis that it's a contrarian indicator in which case Biden looks good. https://t.co/gF8Ja41Vlr
Presumably Beto'll get a boost if/when he declares, as Warren and Harris did. Also, no point in peaking 13 months before Iowa. I think, though, it's been a bad look for him to play hard-to-get when other candidates with frankly more traditional credentials are running officially.
Pretty big drop for Beto in addition to a big gain for Harris in this Daily Kos straw poll, which is a pretty interesting cross-section of high-information Democratic activists. https://t.co/Z9aCEy5IDQ
The shutdown has forced Trump to confront his unpopularity in a way that previous events haven't. He's given two major televised speeches and hasn't moved the needle at all; instead, his approval rating has kept getting worse. https://t.co/jWhuL5JALJ
Likely this decline is caused by her decision to run for president. One deterrant against candidates running is that it tends to make you less popular with your constituents. Probably a bit worse for Gillibrand since she'd pointedly promised not to run. https://t.co/aq4WMHMkdY
One obvious takeaway that none of the publications that scolded BuzzFeed* seems to acknowledge is that the screw-up rate for stories involving anonymous sourcing is much higher, even if it's unavoidable in some cases.		* Many of which have had their own Russia related screw-ups.
We did a roundtable on the BuzzFeed story and other problematic reporting on Trump/Mueller/Russia: https://t.co/JbyzNhMKgm
Did someone associated with Beto ask for this to be shut down? To be fair, many campaigns are incredibly sensitive to even the smallest slight—I have a story about another potential D candidate for president that I'll tell when the time is right. But it's a good question to ask.
I guess Twitter's rules (which don't seem to be strictly enforced) are that you have to clearly identify the account as parody in the bio/account handle, but why not ask the person running the account to do that instead of shutting them down? https://t.co/B8fS8BO68c

RT @FiveThirtyEight: Mariano Rivera became the first MLB player to appear on 100% of Hall of Fame ballots. https://t.co/KHNINSzWcz
@baseballot I do think if a player who was widely regarded as a saint was disclosed to have used PEDs, that might change things in a way that helped Bonds/Clemens. If it's one of the ~2-3 guys who was elected despite steroid rumors, that's a different vibe IMO.
@baseballot I think maayyyyybe you could argue that the best thing for Bonds/Clemens would be if the PED controversy fades from memory instead of being more salient. That's why I'm not sure it's great for them that A-Rod and Ortiz come on the ballot in their 10th year, for example.
Obviously a bit subjective, but I do think Walker is one of those players where, if you really examine his case, it holds up quite well to scrutiny. Whereas it's possible to be pretty indifferent and like "meh, Coors" if you're not devoting a lot of bandwidth to him. https://t.co/5GnXh6uQ4a
Non-PED candidates would typically get a boost in their final year on the ballot, so I think they're slight (~3:2?) favorites to make it. To add to the "fun", A-Rod and David Ortiz both become HOF-eligible in 2022, Bonds/Clemens' final year on the ballot.
Just based on a linear trendline, which may or may not be the best way to do this, Bonds would get 73.6% in his 10th (final) year on the Hall of Fame ballot and Clemens would get 73.7%. So liable to be very close whether they make it or not.

A quick check-in on the message discipline front: https://t.co/kBzzkCUZyk
All right folks, here's our analysis of today's Trump speech: Will Trump’s Compromise Help End The Shutdown? And Was It Even A Compromise?	https://t.co/Zc0bgE2rRl
What has to go right?	1) Not too many Republican defections.	2) Some degree of WH message discipline.	3) Probably need signs that public opinion is shifting to compel Democrats to deal.	4) Probably also have to make the deal itself more enticing to Democrats, maybe much more so.
We'll have a longer analysis up later. But my takeaway is that Trump's speech today was basically competent, both as a strategy and as a speech, but also that a lot of things would have to go right for it to result in a deal because he's dug himself into such a deep hole.
Last pre-speech thought: If Trump were able to *consistently* push a message of "we're willing to come to the table and D's aren't", instead of careening between 5 or 6 different messages/strategies, it might get him somewhere. Discipline hasn't exactly been his strength, though.
Add all the usual caveats about how it's Trump so…always the chance of a surprise. If he were actually offering full DREAM Act protections instead of some warmed-over stuff that's implicitly been available (and rejected) all along, would be a lot more interesting.
From Congress's standpoint, there isn't really anything new here. Back in Dec., Pelosi preemptively rejected a *better* hypothetical offer than the one Trump reportedly will be presenting, and did so at a time when she has less leverage than she does now. https://t.co/q8eqZIipx6 https://t.co/ALe8XHZZha
Relatedly, the target of Trump's press conference today is probably the media more so than Congress, and certainly more so than the general public. (If you wanted to reach a wide public audience, you wouldn't do it at 4pm on a Saturday.)
Rather, it's that coverage of the shutdown might* be framed as "Trump is willing to negotiate, but Dems aren't," which could plausibly move public opinion on who should be blamed for the shutdown.		* I say "might" because it's not clear that framing does justice to the situation.
Don't really think this is right. The risk Dems face isn't that the substance of the deal will seem appealing to independent voters. Most voters won't know or care much about the substance, which is pretty small potatoes (this is hardly a "grand bargain"). https://t.co/XwZLmCn8Jp https://t.co/xeTdIOAvtr
@BenjySarlin Of course it would go nowhere, but Pelosi would use it to frame the notion that Republicans must be prepared to give up a *lot* in exchange for buying Democrats' support for a wall. Hell, ask for the DREAM Act *and* HR 1.
Maybe Pelosi should offer to fully fund the border wall in exchange for passage of HR 1, the Democrats' giant voting rights/campaign finance/anti-corruption bill. It's her top priority and the border wall is Trump's, so everyone gets what they want.
In other words, this is not a terribly enticing offer for Democrats, despite the fact that Democrats would seem to have more leverage in this negotiation since (so far) Trump has been losing the political/public opinion battle.
More detail here: https://t.co/GKKWlTwPbU https://t.co/WPOqWNODzw

Seems like Tatum shooting 43.4% from three last year was a pretty big fluke, when he only shot 34.2% in college. Not that he shouldn't be a *good* (maybe even very good) shooter, but 43.4% is *really* high and accounted for a far bit of his value last year. https://t.co/11q1io55Jv
Trump says there's a border crisis. You're from El Paso and represented it in Congress. You *had* been doing a thing where you were talking to locals about the border. Why'd you randomly decide go on a road trip to Kansas when there's still a government shutdown over the wall?
It's also the media, since picking apart the guy who just yesterday was declared to be the hot new thing is a classic genre of campaign coverage.

To *some* extent, these cycles tend to even out over time. (Although, FWIW, it seems like it takes less for women candidates to trigger a negative media cycle.) And to *some* extent, it's a candidate's job to work through them. But let's not pretend they're not there.
I think mostly it would just be good if reporters &amp; editors acknowledged that the coverage of particular candidates goes different (somewhat predictable) cycles/ moods, and that relatively neutral events can be framed quite positively or negatively depending on these moods.
The case for:	—No sign of an end to the shutdown, and it's the longest shutdown ever, so past precedent not hugely useful here	—It's fraying Trump's relationship with Congressional GOP	—Doubling down on the base instead of pivoting to the middle is probably a dumb 2020 strategy
The case against:	—Shutdowns tend to have short-lived effects on e.g. approval ratings	—Too early for approval ratings to be predictive of re-election odds, anyway	—Lots of news so everyone will forget about it once some Mueller shit happens

…in part because of the dumb Franken narrative, and she was polling at 1-2%. Traditionally, that might translate into building one's reputation as a senator and waiting until the next cycle for a POTUS run, and maybe getting on a VP shortlist. Instead, she declared, and quickly.
Gillibrand's an interesting case because she's someone you might expect *not* to run. On the one hand, she has a pretty bright future in the party and is a plausible nominee in e.g. 2024 or 2028. On the other hand, the invisible/pre-primary hadn't gone especially well for her…
Ehhh... the drop-outs, per the @smotus spreadsheet, are Patrick (a "real" candidate, but don't think he was a top-tier contender), Cuomo (who some in the NYC press still think could run), O'Malley, Avenatti and Steyer? That's a pretty weak group. https://t.co/MJqmhNlVmv
Clearly enough, though, something seems to have changed in the calculation candidates are making. Maybe the digital era makes it easier to raise money and win media coverage. Maybe parties are weaker. Maybe Trump and the 2016 GOP field just changed the paradigm.

@ShaneGoldmacher FWIW, I would contrast that with something like the Elizabeth Warren DNA test, which for better or worse, pretty clearly became a topic of conversation beyond donor/media/elite circles.
@ShaneGoldmacher He's mentioned in our story too. I'm just saying: how much rank-and-file Democrats care about the Franken narrative, and whether they see it as a negative, isn't so clear, and I don't think the fact that he's a minor trending topic on Twitter in NYC tells us very much about that.
It's definitely a part of the conversation, but let's keep in mind that the NYT, and frankly even (to a lesser magnitude) 538, have a lot of agenda-setting power for what's part of the conversation. So Twitter isn't an exogenous measure of what normal people care about. https://t.co/A8oHUPYJPo

@ComfortablySmug It worked for President Rubio so not a surprise that Democrats are trying to emulate the strategy. Although, going to be pretty tough to beat someone with a 74% approval rating.

People like to speculate on what Trump's approval rating floor is, but just purely for his re-election chances* it might be more important to assess his ceiling.		The floor obviously could matter for stuff like impeachment.
It's also not good for Trump if his approval ratings are inelastic. 42% (currently more like 40/41%, but let's assume it rebounds after the shutdown) likely isn't enough to get re-elected if he's running against an opponent who's not Hillary Clinton. https://t.co/cmwAl7kaL0

A sign of how bad Trump is at negotiating. Declaring a national emergency would be highly unpopular, even more so than the wall itself, and would create a lot of awkward arguments within the GOP.

Some candidates who aren't yet running officially will never wind up officially declaring. In most cases, though, that'll be because they couldn't find enough support among staffers and donors—or because they polled poorly—not because they wouldn't have liked to be president.
Yeah we do dude. The primary is happening. Warren, Gabbard, Castro are running officially. Harris and Gillibrand will become official soon. Beto and Booker are de facto running.

@kpelton Yeah that's a very apt analogy I think. We don't know how good Luka Doncic is going to be. We know that the probabilities are heavily weighted toward the favorable side of the ledger, though.
Media outlets also have to make decisions about which candidates to cover. And that involves an element of prediction. I don't think we'd be serving FiveThirtyEight's readers well if we gave Tulsi Gabbard as much coverage as we'll be giving to Elizabeth Warren, for instance.
Except that... staffers, donors, etc. have to make predictions *right now* about which campaigns are viable and which aren't. They have to do the best they can despite the inherent unpredictability of a primary with a large field of candidates. https://t.co/ljdOqx7EPD

@davidshor I disagree, in the sense that I don't think the people with the bylines have a lot of agency over how stories are presented. Also, they generally work their butts off. It's editors, including the top of the masthead, that ought to be answering these questions.
To hone in: I don’t care about an *apology* so much as an *explanation*. NYT screwed up some shit in 2016. It’s OK. It was a hard election to cover. NYT is great. But the “no clear link” story is literally sort of incomprehensible, in light of subsequent reporting. What happened?

The other problem is that there are various things Trump could have done to make news (e.g. declare a national emergency, put some sort of offer on the table), in which case you'd definitely want to hear from leadership and not backbenchers.
You could have had some Democratic members from border states/districts, I guess. It's a *little* bit weird to outsource the rebuttal though, when Pelosi/Schumer are the key players in the negotiation. Would look like Democrats were trying to duck Pelosi &amp; Schumer's unpopularity.

It's pretty good from a He Fights standpoint, I guess. Gets Things Done depends on what the courts do. Not too good for Lib-Owning, though, since Pelosi, et. al. don't have to concede anything and in fact get the budget they wanted all along.
Are Trump supporters supposed to like him because He Fights, because He Gets Things Done, or because He Owns The Libs?		Declaring a national emergency to build a border wall, which may or may not survive the courts, does better by some of these criteria than others.
To take a relevant example, a $10/hour minimum wage is overwhelmingly popular, while a $15/hour minimum wage is more modestly popular. So people are willing to make some distinctions. I'd imagine e.g. a $80/hour minimum wage wouldn't be popular at all. https://t.co/1SdDNy4N8p
A top marginal tax rate of 70% on income above $10M is probably not nearly as unpopular as some people on the right assume. But it's also not convincing to cite polls showing overall support for increasing taxes on the rich to infer that people would support a rate that high.

@Sulliview I dunno, I think the lessons of the 2016 Democratic primary, the 2016 Republican primary, and the 2016 general election are all quite different (and in certain ways a bit opposite) from one another. So that makes these discussions tricky.
So while I'm a huge fan of some of the people making this critique (e.g. @jayrosen_nyu and @Sulliview), I find "cover elections thru policy, not the horse race" to be a bit of a red herring. The argument should really be about whether there's too much *election* coverage, period.
Elections are mostly *not* about wonky arguments over policy. Or to put it another way, you could have exhaustive coverage of the candidates' policy positions and still have plenty of time left over for the horse-racier aspects of the campaign.
Also, a lot of primary campaigns don't feature major differences among the candidates on policy. Clinton and Obama had very little to divide them in 2008, for example. https://t.co/e2oliPA4y9
@jbarro Yeah, I'd think so. And expect that we'd start to get more of those polls this week.
Note that there have been very few traditional, high-quality live caller polls during this period. So it's possible that Trump's approval rating has shifted more than this — our tracker will be pretty conservative until it gets more of that data.

I'm pretty sure reporters/analysts/pundits *underrate* how important "electability" is to the average Democratic voter. Which is not to imply it's easy to determine who's electable or that voters will necessarily agree with one another about it.

An adjacent restaurant by the same owner where AOC *also* worked, Flats Fix taqueria, is thriving, by contrast. (I've gone several times—good tacos—and has always been crowded.) Yet another restaurant by the same owner was recently converted to a 2nd Flats Fix location, in fact.
The owner did cite the minimum wage as one of a "combination of factors", but also said most of his employees were already making above the NYC minimum wage. Also, the concept was pretty dated, and the restaurant was poorly reviewed on Yelp, etc. https://t.co/sXh6CPKSed https://t.co/dt2xHsXDQT
The restaurant, Coffee Shop, was closed mostly it occupied a lot of square footage and because rents are very high in Union Square, where it's located. A ton of restaurants in that area, including the iconic Union Square Cafe, have recently closed or relocated.
Not sure this is a fight worth getting into but FWIW, as someone who knows a relatively large amount about New York restaurants, this claim—that the restaurant where AOC worked was put out of business by a minimum wage hike—is dubious at best. https://t.co/8HXDyGxo3L

@samstein @chrislhayes @LPDonovan I guess I'm just saying there's a zone for a deal where MSNBC viewers think it's an embarrassing capitulation (and are more or less right on the merits) and Fox &amp; Friends viewers do not (and don't care about the merits and/or maybe there's just a teensy tiny amount of ambiguity).
Isn't the shutdown equilibrium that some very tokenish type of border security funding is passed, which Trump (perhaps just blatantly lying or at best spinning/manipulating to the point of mild embarrassment) claims is wall funding when it really isn't?
On the contrary, issue stances and even fairly broad ideological positions (i.e. what it means to be a "conservative") can be quite fungible, and voters will change them because they identify with a candidate for reasons they may find hard to articulate.
I think it would be a good on balance for election coverage to spend more time on candidates' issue positions. But one of the lessons of 2016—at least in the GOP primary—is that voters don't just fill out an issue matrix and vote for the candidate most adjacent to them on policy.

@DavMicRot @SopanDeb You run a site called PredictWise, which takes other people's predictions and republishes them without any journalistic context or explanation whatsoever. You are literally the last person in the world who should be sanctimonious about this.
@SopanDeb So it's like—why *wouldn't* you cover something that's extremely newsworthy and extremely interesting to lots of people, especially given that polls have a pretty good track record (across various types of elections, they're right ~80% of the time).
@SopanDeb I guess I just think "what's going to happen next?" is one of the most fundamental questions in news. e.g. if you picked up today's NYT, I'd bet something like a third (?) of the stories—whether about $AAPL or the shutdown or the Oscars or whatever—were mainly forward-looking.
@SopanDeb 3. I don't buy that news organizations won't cover the horse race if they don't cover polls. They'll just cover it in a worse way, i.e. relying on groupthink or "gut feel" or on their sources. I think there's a ton of value to covering electoral politics in an empirical way.
@SopanDeb 2. Horse race coverage is pretty darn interesting if done properly. It can tell you a lot about how parties work, about how voters think, how news events resonate with the public, etc. Also gives readers some exposure to applied math and probability, which I'm always a fan of.
@SopanDeb 1. It's something that people are curious about and for good reason (elections are super important). So it has a lot of news value! I think it's kind of snobby to act like we're above it.
There's a lot of revisionism in thinking that "traditional" horse race reporting (i.e. talking to consultants on both sides) got 2016 right. Just the opposite. In fact, the conventional wisdom was much more confident in Clinton's chances than was justified based on the polls.
It would be much worse because journalists would substitute the opinions of people in their social circles and/or powerful sources and/or their own opinions for broader public opinion. Polls serve as a reality check against journalistic groupthink. https://t.co/dkznyvZedh
As you might guess I'm not a huge fan of the "let's just ignore polls this time!" hot take, in part because I find it overly pious, but mostly because if the media had a better understanding of polls, which showed a close race, they wouldn't have been as surprised by Trump's win.

A fun (?) hypothetical: Trump runs for and wins the 2012 GOP nomination, upsetting Romney. In November, he loses to Obama by 7 points although with a different map than we actually got in 2012 (he wins IA &amp; OH but loses AZ, NC &amp; maybe GA).		Where does the GOP go in 2016?
e.g. there are several theories I can come up with under which Kamala Harris is a serious contender. Some where Amy Klobuchar is a serious contender and others where she isn't. But almost none where Tom Steyer wins anything. So Harris &gt; Klobuchar &gt; Steyer.
This is almost right, but I'd modify slightly: I think you need to be ready to hold multiple theories of the nomination process in your head at once. https://t.co/rJcrSAb5Nf
The realization that might help Trump the most in 2020 is the very realization that he and Trumpworld seem least likely to have: That he got a bit lucky to win in 2016 and that he can't count on the same strategy working in 2020.
Worth remembering that Romney got a larger share of the vote (47.2%) than Trump did (46.1%), and against a much tougher opponent. Obviously Trump's coalition is configured more efficiently for the Electoral College. Not sure Romney wouldn't have beaten Clinton by more, though.

Too many hot takes trying to find the strategic significance of Romney's op-ed. It may just be that he's in a pretty untouchable position—he's basically royalty in Utah and will probably be re-elected for as long as he wants—and so doesn't face downside from speaking out.
Have been in LA for New Year's and I sorta feel like NYC vs LA should be more of a rivalry. They really are contrasting visions of American urbanism and both pretty great in their own way.
This is quite the ratio. Coming around to the idea that Warren's chances are underrated, in part because media coverage like this might engender a backlash and allow her to cast herself as an underdog. https://t.co/riA0GTpqDG
I think this held up reasonably well. 2018, with border separation, the shutdown, market volatility, staffing chaos, abrupt foreign policy reversals, Pittsburgh, Parkland, California wildfires, was a fair bit closer to the year that Trump's critics predicted/feared than 2017 was. https://t.co/4xfr6s091k
Not exactly the right analogy, but Warren's path to victory might be something like McCain's in 2008, who was left for dead by pundits at certain early points in the nomination process, but was fundamentally a strong candidate and eventually benefited from a "comeback" narrative.
BUT you could make a decent "buy low" case on Warren. She probably has a better chance than Sanders of bridging the gap between the left and the party establishment. She's always raised a ton of money. Voters know what she stands for. Women did well in the 2018 primaries.
My basic view on Warren's chances is bearish. For whatever reason (she's seen as old news? the DNA test? sexism/she reminds voters of Hillary?) her polling has been quite poor especially given her high name recognition. Her margins of victory in MA also have also not been great.

Finally, it's worth reiterating that Trump's numbers *right now* are pretty bad, with a -12 net approval rating (-11 among polls of RV/LV).		So SOMETHING has to change or he'll have to get quite lucky to win re-election (i.e. face off against another super-unpopular opponent).
Reagan and Obama (among others) also benefited from improving economies after poor midterms, something that probably won't work in Trump's favor because the economy is already pretty good—but with some signs that it's getting worse—so the risks are to the downside.
Repeating this point, but the tendency of presidents to recover after bad midterms doesn't necessarily happen automatically—it may happen because it prompts them to pivot. Not clear if there's any recovery if there's no pivot, and Trump isn't pivoting. https://t.co/u6qD9Vvrcr https://t.co/nsjrrdS7FO

It's too *late* to wonder if O'Rourke is running, because he's already running. https://t.co/SKwrazTnMj
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten I don't want to put too much stock in casual conversations, but Warren seems to strike an averse reaction in people (e.g. middle-aged Democratic women) you wouldn't expect it from. It may be—nobody seems to want to say this out loud—that she reminds voters of Hillary.
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten You've almost convinced me. On the basis of the fundamentals, she should be one of the frontrunners. But her polling is **bad** right now. The reaction to the DNA test was over-the-top, but the fact that it was so over-the-top was itself somewhat revealing.
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten So it's important that Beto and Harris are perceived as frontrunners *right now*, because now is actually a pretty key phase of the nomination. They could fail in the retail phase that will start sometime in '19, but they'll almost certainly be able to build robust campaigns.
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten But my general view is that this thing is moving *fast*, and there might not be that many more turns on the merry-go-round before perceived frontrunnership becomes reified in the form of things like staff talent and money.
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten I agree on Brown. Not sure about Warren, who I think would count as a contrarian pick at this point (i.e. I'm bearish on her but everyone else is too so I'm trying to figure out if the conventional wisdom has gone overboard).
@kombiz @ForecasterEnten I'm half-serious. I think there are good reasons why the conventional wisdom (at least as espoused by betting markets) has settled on Beto and Harris as the frontrunners, possibly along with Bernie and Biden.
@ForecasterEnten Beto
@B_M_Finnigan @conorsen I mean I agree with this point in general but I don't think Harris is being hurt by the lack of attention right now and she seems to be doing well according to invisible-primary type metrics.
p.s. These intuitions about electability can be pretty wrong and can also be loaded with assumptions based on candidates' genders and ethnicities. That's why it's probably better for parties to explicitly talk about electability rather than considering it gauche.
@conorsen I can't figure out why Harris hasn't gotten more attention but I think she almost certainly will at some point. But Biden is a boringish story, yeah. It also seems like party elites are lukewarm on him so the lack of buzz might be a bearish signal.
To take the most pertinent examples right now, I think people intuit that Beto scores well on electabiliity and that Warren doesn't, and that this partially explains the Beto Bubble and why she's come out flat out of the gate.
I don't think it's obvious which candidates are most electable, but I do think people have strong feelings/intuitions about it, and saying "don't worry about electability" leads those feelings to be sublimated into other discussions about the candidates rather than going away. https://t.co/4YasKuTD41

@kdrum I'm just saying -- this is a solved problem. Google's topic search are the right way to do these searches. They were created expressly to deal with problems like this. https://t.co/AQClllzocl
@kdrum By contrast, almost all search traffic for Kamala Harris uses both her first and last name, with the correct spelling (since it's a fairly easy-to-spell name). https://t.co/f4FZgwdZG1
@kdrum This is exactly the problem that Google's **topics** (which is what my charts are based on) are designed to solve. They lump all search strings for a given person/place/thing under the same heading. For Beto, very little of the search traffic uses the "Beto O'Rourke" string. https://t.co/DRzmHr9thf
@kdrum But, searches for O'Rourke might be divided between several different search strings (e.g. "beto", "beto o'rourke", "beto orourque" [sic]) whereas for other candidates, one search string (e.g. "kamala harris") is more likely to capture the large majority of search traffic.
@chrislhayes tbh I think liberals are lucky Uber has had so many self-inflicted wounds because it gives a pretext for regulation in NYC and Austin and other places that might otherwise be pretty darned unpopular.
@chrislhayes I don't know how to weigh the consumer surplus against the externalities. But it's clear they meet a real need that wasn't being well-served by local taxi monopolies.
@chrislhayes Ride-sharing services have a pretty large benefit to consumers IMO.
The candidates who do poorly by this metric are Klobuchar, Brown and Booker. Not really a huge surprise since they aren't really household names. But Beto, Biden, Sanders and to some extent Harris are generating quite a bit more search traffic lately than the other contenders. https://t.co/i9JBMM91pl
And you look over the past year, Beto had far and away the highest peak in late Oct. / early Nov. Although, that isn't really a surprise since he was the only one of these candidates in a competitive race in 2018. The second-highest peak is Elizabeth Warren's DNA test.😬 https://t.co/9cjy6ohOBl
Google Trends has another category called *terms* which allows (usually) categorizes related searches correctly, e.g. "Bernie" searches  would roll up under "Bernie Sanders" and "Beto" under "Beto O'Rourke". That shows Bernie and Beto getting quite a bit of traffic. https://t.co/Ym39dZvbAp
At the risk of being a bit of a pedant (well, what's new), this analysis isn't quite right. A lot of people will search for O'Rourke by searching for "Beto" rather than his full name "Beto O'Rourke". So requiring his full name badly underrates his popularity on Google. https://t.co/wylkDzpm8O

@joshtpm Yeah, and I keep coming back to thinking about which candidates come "from" the left, but have the best chance of building a coalition of Democrats beyond just the left. Folks like Brown and Stacey Abrams (for different reasons) probably have a better chance of that than Sanders.
Brown's chances maybe a bit underrated. He's pretty lefty but, as compared with Sanders, is younger, has a much better relationship with the Democratic Party, and is from a swing state. https://t.co/HuXHVcIbkk

The logic is that the emperor has no clothes and some poor saps had to construct a cover story to make Trump's irrational shutdown strategy seem logical. https://t.co/H15FBxwJZ7
But that's a hard argument for the Bernie folks to make, since Bernie is also a white guy and one hasn't touted political experience to be an asset.		So instead we get arguments like "Beto is the new Obama" which is pretty much an own-goal.
Also, my guess is that the biggest challenge Beto will face, in the context of contemporary Democratic politics, is that he's an (arguably) underqualified white guy in a field with lots of traditionally qualified minority and/or women candidates...
I see where you're coming from. The risk IMO is that the primary is essentially a series of periods of heightened scrutiny for various candidates at various times, and *surviving* one of those periods of scrutiny tends to make you stronger (see e.g. Trump in 2015/16). https://t.co/50RiCt2MdQ
In other words, it's tended to confirm O'Rourke's status as a top-tier contender, and may even (I wouldn't go overboard because this is all pretty minor IMO) have elevated him. So, if it was strategic, it wasn't a very good strategy!
I'm not totally sure I buy this. One of the big takeaways from the fact that these very minor skirmishes between some Sanders fans and Beto have gotten so much attention that both the media and mainstream Democrats are very thirsty for Beto-related content. https://t.co/jDyyRvdwwi

@sahilkapur It's pretty bearish on most of the Lakers' offseason acquisitions, and on Ingram. Might be wrong. I think it underrates their chances because they could pretty easily acquire more talent before the trade deadline. Not sure the current roster can win multiple playoff series.
A good, related take is that the Warriors (sans Boogie) have devolved into being a big 2 rather than a big 4. The plus-minus stats are (I think correctly) very bearish on Draymond's offense and (IMO possibly incorrectly) Klay Thompson's defense.
I'm not really convinced that the Warriors are in trouble—we have them at even money to win the title—but a *lot* of our forecast's optimism is based on Cousins coming back and being reasonably effective.

This is one of those times when it might actually be interesting to check in on Trump approval. Unfortunately, not likely to be a lot of reliable polling around the holidays. The handful of polls that are out do seem to show numbers that are a tick worse than usual. https://t.co/LD8xuzSm4o
During the general election, when events are much easier to analyze, markets clearly saw events that helped Trump's chances as bearish. It's not that ambiguous IMO.
Markets could also react to the perceived likelihood that Bernie Sanders could win the D nomination, since those shocks occurred on the same days as GOP primary shocks.
I think this analysis isn't convincing because it relies a lot on events from the primary, and primary events have a lot of complex knock-off effects on the chance that other non-Trump candidates (e.g. Cruz or Rubio or Clinton) might become president. https://t.co/JsJrLqGCQa
I don't know which position is right per se (whether Trump is a net asset or liability to stock prices) but the abruptness by which investors switched hypotheses might not give you much confidence in their ability to price in political risk.
Always thought it was interesting how the stock market priced Trump as a liability throughout the 2016 campaign, and even on election night, only to abruptly flip the next morning.

@conorsen Culturally conservative, working-class white Democrats are, I'm guessing, something like 5% of the Democratic primary electorate. Used to be a much bigger factor. But that's the group that has flipped almost completely to Trump, of course.
What it shows is that Bernie's '16 coalition was really formed from 2 (overlapping) groups: The Left on the one hand, and less ideological/more personality-driven young voters on the other hand. Bernie's won't/shouldn't lose The Left to Beto but the millennials may be a problem.
The Beto-Bernie "war" is pretty normal and healthy and so far has been fairly tame, insofar as these things go.
If you're a heretofore Trump-friendly member of the GOP establishment,  you have to worry you got a stick with 2 short ends. With a D House, you aren't getting much more policywise &amp; stuff Trump will do on his own may be stuff you don't like. But he's also an electoral liability.
You could say that was a canny (if cynical) insight into political strategy, although not clear if that's so true either. Not sure if the rural Trump coalition is any larger than the suburban Romney coalition; it may be a bit smaller, in fact, though more electorally efficient.
I've said before that I think Stacey Abrams's chances should be taken way more seriously. But Gillum's? Not sure. Unlike Abrams—and Beto—who over-performed relative to the partisanship of their states, Gillum lost a race that he probably ought to have won. https://t.co/L6ozw4BenS

I'm struck by the notion that Trump has actually been pretty lucky so far. Certainly on the economy, which (most economists would say) is largely not his doing. But there also haven't been that many acute domestic &amp; foreign policy crises that weren't of his own making.
Even a largely dysfunctional presidency will have its fair share of "wins". It will certainly have good days and good weeks, sometimes even good months. Between mean-reversion and lowered expectations, terrible weeks are more likely to be followed by better weeks than worse ones.

In the background, there's also an increasing amount of downside risk—how much depends on which economist you ask—for Trump on the economy. I'm not sure the stock market sell-off matters much. But something that spills into the consumer sector could be very bad for Trump.
In particular, his deteriorating relationships with McConnell &amp; other members of the Congressional leadership is a major deal. The shutdown itself isn't a huge news event (IMO). But those relationships matter a lot, including on the big questions (impeachment, primary challenge).

@zeynep @BrendanNyhan I'm not sure if we're agreeing or disagreeing, but I think the focus on the Russian shitposts distracts from more fruitful and interesting research on the effects of social media.
@ForecasterEnten Thx for the update
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan OK, then I'd say that the Russian shitposts are not enough to have changed the outcome (which would have required a net shift of ~0.8 percentage points toward Clinton). I'd also consider that to be a pretty *large* effect, as these things go.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan That's not where you and I have a difference of opinion. We're arguing about the scale and magnitude of the impacts. I think the magnitude was small, maybe very small. You've claimed it was medium or large. I'm asking you to propose a way to test whether it was small or large.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan None of those are hypotheses.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan I've been in hundreds of debates On Here and I've never encountered a case where someone was so reluctant to offer up a testable hypothesis. Next time, call my bluff and assume that both you and I will be too lazy to actually follow up and do the research!
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan Moreover, you still haven't even listed an actual, *high*-complexity hypothesis that could be tested (given some *reasonable* parameters, e.g. a smart graduate student with a year and cooperation from one of the major social media platforms to fulfill additional data requests).
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan Given that low-complexity analysis doesn't support your hypothesis, it's just not a good set of facts for you that you also reject any attempt at *medium*-complexity analysis.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan OK, then give me some other hypothesis that's *actually testable* and that someone (you or me or a smart graduate student out there) could *actually test* (i.e.. the data is available publicly) in a reasonable length of time.
RT @ReubenFB: I'll say it: This route seems like a BS way to "cross" Antarctica https://t.co/Lp8FANxB0o
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan OK, it's pretty telling IMO that you've rejected an **actually** testable (in practice, not just in theory) hypothesis for ones that are either impossible or extremely cumbersome to test.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan How about this as a **testable** theory:		HYPOTHESIS: If Russian troll posts were more influential than the raw numbers imply, they should have higher-than-average engagement (retweets/replies/faves) from blue-checkmark journalist Twitter accounts than other 2016 content.
@zeynep @BrendanNyhan My quick-and-dirty metric is actually social media *impressions*, not posts. The Russian troll posts constituted a *lower* share of impressions than posts, which really cuts AGAINST your hypothesis (i.e. they punched below their weight rather than going viral).
This actually seems like a quite beautiful use of semicolons and the mood would be ruined if he'd used periods instead. https://t.co/tB23ZPQNKH https://t.co/TGnVvxsiI2

@zeynep @antoniogm This is misleading -- the @TEN_GOP is not just one of many similar accounts. It was maybe the ONLY account to gain significant traction with journalists on twitter.	And to be honest, 100,000 is not a ton of followers when, e.g. the New York Times has 42,500,000.

@zeynep You're -- deliberately? -- confusing two things. The DNC hack could well have been important. There's no evidence that Russian shitposts on Instagram mattered much, though.
@zeynep In fact, it could easily be the case that the Russian troll posts were even *less* influential than the (already very low) raw numbers would suggest. Why? Because journalists are more likely to amplify known, trusted sources, and those accounts weren't known or trusted.
@zeynep Your argument is lacking in any sort of systematic evidence, at all. If you think impression counts are an imperfect measure -- and surely they are -- then come up with something better.
So there were.... 3 mainstream media articles, out the many TENS OF THOUSANDS of articles published on the 2016 campaign, that embedded Russian troll tweets? I'm afraid that's not really helping your argument. https://t.co/KJcJ5ZgPKX

It's also pretty questionable how much IA and NH have mattered anyway in recent elections (they haven't produced much of a "bounce"). Maybe they matter more in a year like 2012 or 2004 when the field is slow to develop. But 2020, like 2016 and 2008, is starting early.
It should go without saying that those Super Tuedsay states are a lot more representative of what the country as a whole look like. So just speaking for myself, I think it would be a Good Thing if the media traded off some IA/NH coverage for some CA/TX/NC/VA coverage.
There's nothing inherently important about IA and NH. They're important to the extent that candidates, the media and "party elites" deem them to be important. I still think they'll matter quite a bit, but perhaps in better balance with the key Super Tuesday states (CA/TX/VT/NC). https://t.co/ec4ditDKyW

@jelani9 OK, so let's end corporate personhood! I think it's weird that people on the left are arguing to give corporations more political power, then defend it by saying they have too much power already.
@jelani9 That's sort of a strawman—I don't want corporations to be political actors. I want them to be as apolitical as possible. I don't want them making decisions about editorial content. I want corporations to make products in legal ways, and I want governments to regulate them.
@heathr @jelani9 I think it's good to use speech (protest) as a lever against corporations. What I don't want is to use corporations as a lever against speech.

@emilybazelon But my point is that you can't treat the amount of corporate influence as being fixed. Rather, we're debating an instance at the margin about whether corporations ought to have more influence or less. I want them to have LESS influence over editorial content and political speech.
In any scenario wherein Trump was actually vulnerable to a primary challenge, this move would probably backfire IMO. Gives his opponent weeks' worth of arguments that the system is rigged—and those arguments would be correct!— which tend to be powerful in primaries. https://t.co/WfeZ1FrI4y
In fact, I am gay, and I'm just old enough (40) to remember when conservative groups urged boycotts of advertisers and networks who were seen as promoting LGBTQ or other "nontraditional" lifestyles. That strongly influences my views on this subject! https://t.co/iGGFGQeXWw https://t.co/jDrXGxizQX
@emilybazelon I didn't have any problem with them, but I'm not sure how those situations are comparable. I'm making a relatively narrow claim: it's on balance a bad idea (yes, it's complicated) to hold advertisers responsible for the editorial contents of programs they advertise upon.
@MarkHarrisNYC Maybe (non-political) TV is different... I come at this from a world where the market for ad-supported political content is pretty distressed despite crazy high traffic. Much of that is Facebook etc. But politics content as a whole underperforms on CPMs relative to other content.
@MarkHarrisNYC I'm saying in calling for boycotts people should think more about the categorical imperative i.e. what happens if everyone behaves like they do. If you say boycotts won't have a chilling effect then…maybe? I'm less optimistic; a lot of advertisers already avoid politics content.
@MarkHarrisNYC They do, but the degree to which consumers hold advertisers responsible for the content of the programming is not obvious, and can vary a lot in different contexts. I'm saying we're better off, overall, when consumers largely do *not* hold advertisers responsible for the content.
So they don't have to vet merit of the claims at all? Any time a vocal minority of consumers organizes a boycott, the advertiser should just pull itself off the show? That seems like a bad equilibrium, and one that can and will be gamed by people whose politics don't match yours. https://t.co/JXCfK4WrxR

What fraction of overall social media impressions on the 2016 election were generated by Russian troll farms? 0.1%? I'm not sure what the answer is, but suspect it's low, and it says something that none of the reports that hype up the importance of them address that question.
For instance, this story makes a big deal about a (post-election) Russian social media disinformation campaign on Bob Mueller based on... 5,000 tweets? That's **nothing**. Platform-wide, there are something like 500,000,000 tweets posted each day.	https://t.co/LI8wt6tua8 https://t.co/I2XOIf0rdy
If you wrote out a list of the most important factors in the 2016 election, I'm not sure that Russian social media memes would be among the top 100. The scale was quite small and there's not much evidence that they were effective.

That list above ^^ isn't that far from how I'd rate the candidates' chances. I'd move some up or down a tier or a half-tier. Also feels like there might be room for another nonwhite candidate, especially on the left (Stacey Abrams?). But you could do a lot worse than those tiers.
If you sort candidates into tiers based on that table, you wind up with something like this:	Tier 1a: Biden, Beto	Tier 1b: Bernie, Klobuchar, Harris	Tier 1c: Warren, Booker	Tier 2: Gillibrand, Brown, Hickenlooper, Castro	Tier 3: [everyone else]
Here, from that CNN/Selzer Iowa poll yesterday, are favorability ratings for the Dem candidates.

One thing that helped Trump's campaign in 2016 is (believe it or not) humility.

The bullish case is just that most presidents win reelection and nothing 2 years into the term should cause you to diverge much from that prior. This is a more robust argument than you might think; presidencies are unpredictable.		Please excuse typos (underratomg = underrating).
As for (ii), that the economy is good *now* is bearish for Trump because economic performance is mean-reverting (easier for it to get worse than better). There's actually a slight *negative* correlation between economic performance in Year 2 of a term and re-election strength.
I think people *may* be underratomg the chance of (i). Two years is a long time and, in theory, the D House both gives Trump a foil and an opportunity to do some centrist stuff (e.g. on infrastructure). In practice, he may lack the discipline to play the politics correctly.
The bearish case for Trump's re-election chances is that, although many presidents have rebounded from low popularity 2 years in, they've done it either by (i) pivoting to the center or (ii) because the economy got better, and neither of those seem super likely in Trump's case.

Fine to mention Beto (and others) in Part 4. But to the extent Beto is drawing support from ex-Bernie backers, it's *despite* considerable differences from Bernie in political philosophy. At a minimum, NYT, etc. need to recognize the distinction between "liberal" and "left".
I'd think that these are the big problems with Bernie's chances:	1) People are concerned about his age	2) He never did a great job of cultivating support from nonwhite voters	3) D's have unhappy memories of 2016 and want to turn the page	4) There are more alternatives this time

What does matter is whether Trump realizes that focusing solely on his base is a good way to be a 1-term president. So shutting down the government for a quixotic attempt to gain border wall funding would be a bad sign in that regard. But won't matter much unto itself.

Personally, I think the "must have been a Governor or Senator" thing is overrated and I think his 2018 performance was indeed impressive and I've got no problem with Beto being treated as a serious candidate.		I'm not sure why Stacey Abrams isn't in the same bucket, though.
He may well have more appeal to leftist/progressive voters than other candidates from the moderate "lane". His policy views aren't that fully-formed and he's charismatic. So it's not like he's Andrew Cuomo, or something. But he was never going to be the first choice of the left.
I was pointing out that Beto isn't really a leftist/progressive before it was cool https://t.co/7Wxwr4L15W
Here's some analysis, though: David Valadao should probably not have voted with Trump 99% of the time in a district that voted for Hillary Clinton by 15 points. That was a really dumb move. https://t.co/Vxma8pr2lu
In addition, provisional ballots are counted after the election, and they tend to come from younger voters and more marginalized voters—who also tend to be Democratic.
It doesn't require any kind of advanced analysis. It's basically because young people procrastinate.		Younger people tend to vote later so their votes are counted later. And younger people are more Democratic. So Democrats gain ground over the course of the counting process. https://t.co/qquNJqVnWh

If you actually want to *be* smart, instead of appearing smart on TV, you should usually bet on mean-reversion, and you should be especially willing to make the same mistake twice in a row, because most pundits learn by rote and overcompensate for their previous errors.
The fallacy if something unexpected happens the last time (Trump won the GOP primary, against odds/expectations), pundits assume that that the unexpected thing will also happen next time (Trump-like candidates always win).

This is also why, to the extent Trump faces impeachment/removal risk, it may be more concentrated in 2019 than 2020. If it gets really bad, Republicans *might* think there's a window to remove him, nominate a different candidate, and cut their losses.
I guess you'd also need to consider the effects on downballot races, since the House and Senate are both in play for 2020, and control of redistricting for 2022-2030 will be heavily influenced by state legislative results in many states.

I'd be more willing to bet on a candidate polling at 1% if that candidate had been underexposed. Which you, uhhhhhhh, have not been.

But overall this a technical story because we think the PHILOSOPHICAL debates on election models—and to a lesser extent, "data journalism" overall—are dumb. This stuff has been around for a long time now. It has a good track record. It deserves a role in coverage. It works. https://t.co/askZVMEwL1

With almost all races called, we have a LONG review up this AM on how the 538 forecast did last month. The short answer is: really good! "Called" 95-97% of races right. Almost exactly predicted House seat count and popular vote. Pretty good on Senate/Gov. https://t.co/vMOeQyGJhd

@ryangrim If you spent four months reporting out a story you'd probably feel like you had some valuable things to say about it, wouldn't you? I haven't even looked at her thread yet so I don't know if I agree with any of it, but that's kind of a weird criticism.
It can also be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the GOP members think the only way to cope with Trump is either to go along with him or to quit, you're going to have more retirements and recruitment problems (as this article alludes to). Makes it much harder to take back the House.
Of course, 2020 *will* be more about Trump than 2018 was. But there's a lot of "learned helplessness" here; the GOP sees it as inevitable that they're going to struggle in the House under Trump and any sort of moderation isn't really even on the table.
Interesting story on the GOP (lack of) response to their House losses. The lawmaker quoted here is wrong to think it was all about Trump &amp; that issues/policy didn't matter. Healthcare was a huge issue everywhere, and the tax bill was huge in CA/IL/NY/NJ. https://t.co/8vAOLwTie4 https://t.co/lqdBnn6cI0
@VorosM I think there's a more natural-seeming cutoff than you might think. IMO you want to be able to accommodate almost all 0 or 1-loss major-conference champions plus select others that are as strong as 1-loss champions (e.g. Notre Dame). There tend to be ~5-6 teams in that tier.
(Also, 4 teams is an extremely awkward number when there are 5 major conferences + Notre Dames + UCFs, etc. Expand to 6 or 8. https://t.co/qsv3pq1SdS)
Notre Dame is a weird case because they don't play in a conference, but the playoff selection committee putting Georgia at 5 ahead of Ohio State at 6 (not that it *really* matters) is a sign that they don't really care about conference championships.
You can, of course, debate whether they've *actually* been treated unfairly. People can use the perception (or for that matter the reality) of unfair treatment to justify a variety of selfish and irrational behavior. But that's what seems to motivate them—a sense of grievance.
Dowd has such a blind spot about the Clintons that she misses the rather obvious reason why they behave like they do.

The simplest explanation for these irregularities is that someone associated with the @MarkHarrisNC9 campaign committed fraud involving absentee-by-mail ballots in both the primary and the general. I'm open to other explanations, but I haven't heard any yet.

@PatrickRuffini The 3 terms thing may have been huge. I'm less sure about the economy because the indicators are all over the place, suggesting everything from still-in-recession to actually-pretty-good. Also, the perception of the economy is itself influenced by media narratives.
This is a HUGE and underrated positive re: NYC in late summer—less traffic, fewer crowds, you can get into whatever restaurant you want—but outweighed by the fact that the entire city literally smells like garbage. Maybe if we had alleys we could elevate July/August on the list. https://t.co/CARcAsWplR
So it's a year when the media narrative on Bush—as being out of touch (see below re: the largely bullshit story about Bush and a supermarket scanner), as being a "wimp"—may actually have mattered. He went from very popular to very unpopular REALLY fast.	https://t.co/56ZDNa9Le2
That said, 1992 was maybe the era of Peak Media Narrative, where White House coverage was getting more "sophisticated" (not meant as a compliment) and narrative-driven but there wasn't yet competition from blogs/Fox/MSNBC/social media/etc. to push back against the groupthink.
There are A LOT of confounding factors in 1992. The GOP had held the White House for 3 terms. Perot. Economy was in recovery from the 1990-91 recession—but statistics were slow to recognize it (end of the recession was not declared until Dec. 92). Clinton was a good politician.
SHORT THREAD: 1992 was one of the more complicated elections of all-time—and one where "fundamentals" models based on the economy etc. do poorly. They didn't necessarily have Bush as a huge favorite but have trouble explaining why he lost by so much and became so unpopular.

Upon reflection maybe April was underrated here. But all the months listed higher than it are pretty good too. Basically there are 7 good months in New York, 2 OK months (March, July) and 3 terrible months.

Finally, there's the question of whether Harris would face criminal liability, and either not seated in the House—"each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members"—or seated and then expelled.
NC statues also explicitly provide for a new election to be called if results are tainted by improprieties to the point where doubt is cast on the fairness of the election, even if it's not clear whether they swung the result. https://t.co/poE1obfQWQ https://t.co/ydGDd9BvUk
There's also a question of whether, if you were able to detect several hundred ballots' worth of fraud, there may have been other fraudulent activities that went undetected. People are just now noticing that there may have also been fraud in the GOP primary in NC-9, for instance.
From our story just now: https://t.co/4Uq9IncBnL
This is simply not true; there ARE enough ballots in question in NC-9 to potentially affect the outcome. https://t.co/B6p9O7XEFr
NC-9 could be in limbo for quite a while, so if you're being precise, probably best to say that Democrats have gained 40 House seats but that Republicans have *lost* 41 seats.
And here's more detail from @baseballot on what's happening in NC-9: https://t.co/xqv7bxOcxq
Good—a little more out in front of the story than in CA-21. If folks are going to "call" races at all, they need to be willing to retract calls when the circumstances change. https://t.co/U7x0zHirBu
It's Republicans who are accused of voter fraud here in NC-9—possibly even widespread enough to have swung a House race or at least muddy it. Can you imagine if the shoe was on the other foot and it was Democrats accused instead? Would be all that Trump was talking about. https://t.co/5WikjE5TQW
I'm partly just trolling here but news is hard because it happens in real time and so you get things wrong. There should be more peer pressure (even trolling!) applied when people refuse to fix mistakes in the case of mounting evidence to the contrary. Would improve incentives.
Like, would it kill @BretStephensNYT just to admit that he made a hasty judgment based on having a deadline and not understanding that a lot of the uncalled races were likely to go to Democrats?
This is funny https://t.co/DAV0c3G7wd
But NC could refuse to certify or the House could refuse to seat Harris if the election was tainted.		Not sure that "there was widespread, organized fraud that benefited Harris but probably not 900 votes worth of fraud" would be a winning argument for Harris, if we play this out.
We're going to further re-characterize NC-9 as Lean R (rather than Likely R), in fact. It seems possible—indeed, likely—that *something* weird happened. It's less lear whether it might have been enough to swing the outcome.
I actually think it's kind of a toss-up as to whether Harris (R) ever becomes a member of Congress or not. But if he doesn't get seated, the remedy is probably a new election rather than McCready (D) being given the seat.
p.s. To add to the complication, it sounds like there are also a few things to evaluate in the *Republican primary*, in which Harris surprisingly defeated incumbent Robert Pittenger by ~800 votes. https://t.co/IpBWBX4IWM
Lots of "interesting" possibilities here:	—NC could refuse to certify and call for a new election	—The House could refuse to seat him	—If Harris had knowledge of the alleged fraud, he could agree to resign, triggering a special election https://t.co/ROmLzIDVvP
Although, evaluating Mets trades is weird because your first objective as Mets GM is to get the Wilpons to spend more money and maybe this does that.
Yeah, agree. My view is that closers are more valuable when:	1) You have a winning team and have more leads to close out and/or	2) You're willing to use him in high-leverage/"sabermetrically correct" ways (i.e. not saves-driven)	Neither of which describes the Mets I don't think? https://t.co/XFxlpcjBDa
More analysis here: https://t.co/iKHp3XtxRN		There's a distinct possibility that something untoward occurred—although if it did, it's not clear that it was enough to sway the race. But @AP and the networks need to un-call this race until the state investigates &amp; certifies.
One thing I noticed—which is far from dispositive but is at least interesting—is that the county where the alleged fraud occurred, Bladen Co., is the only one in the district where Republicans gained ground relative to 2016. https://t.co/3nxIBUTesP
Yeah, this isn't your usual cooky theory about voter fraud. Some of this in NC-9 looks pretty weird. https://t.co/eyexGroYsR

p.s. Sometimes injuries can HELP teams because they were playing unproductive players—the 76ers are helped by not having Markelle Fultz in their rotation, for instance.
We're also now accounting for the fact that teams use shorter rotations in the playoffs. This helps top-heavy teams like GSW and HOU as opposed to deeper ones like TOR, although don't worry because our model will never get over its love of the Raptors.

I don't want to overgeneralize here. By "certain types of scoops" I mean stuff related to Russia and Mueller.
One consequence of the NYT and WaPo being so good at getting certain types of scoops is that whenever a scoop appears in another publication, you wonder if NYT/WaPo saw it and rejected it.

This is incompetently designed. It's worse than RPI. Worse than the eye test. It could make a total shitshow of the NCAA tourney for a couple years and cost the NCAA millions by devaluing its most valuable franchise. It's why you never want to design an algorithm by committee.
The big problem seems to be that only 1 of the 5 components (not sure why there are 5 components instead o 1 cohesive rating) considers strength of schedule. So it rewards team with good records against very poor schedules. Probably won't get much better as the year goes along. https://t.co/WTzqcaW6Qr

@MattNorlander And I guess I'm not sympathetic because a lot of smart people have worked on this problem (power rankings) for a LONG time and the NCAA ignored all that and came up with something that doesn't reflect methodological best practices *and* which doesn't make sense, basketball-wise.
@MattNorlander I also think, philosophically, NET suffers from a "throw a bunch of metrics at the wall and see what sticks" problem, which is often characteristic of unthoughtful algorithm design, instead of having considered more deeply what it's actually trying to predict or achieve.
@MattNorlander There are a lot of other systems that produce rankings, though, and despite the relatively early point of the season we're in, they produce much more "reasonable" values.
These are the worst rankings I've ever seen in any sport, ever. NCAA needs to go completely back to the drawing board. https://t.co/UXKbrGyuP8

@EsotericCD @_Drew_McCoy_ I don't think she's the type of candidate who would dominate but rather the type who could accumulate delegates and win by attrition. Kerry in 2004 is a not-great but not-bad analogy.
@_Drew_McCoy_ She's soft-spoken and even a little boring which makes her a perfect contrast to Trump. The idea that Democrats would want some Trump-like figure of their own (e.g. Avenatti) has always been really flawed IMO.
As these things go, not much of a denial from the Klobuchar camp about her potential interest in a presidential campaign. https://t.co/lTxDTwnsQF
@PatrickRuffini @EsotericCD All I know is that both FL-Gov and FL-Sen look like modest outliers relative to the national trend whereas the FL-House popular vote, made up of a composite of a couple dozen races and therefore likely the more robust metric, is right in line with national trends.
@EsotericCD @PatrickRuffini On the contrary I think the statewide House popular vote is a more robust metric because the quirks of individual candidates are mitigated. WV is not a blue state because Manchin happened to hold on there.
@PatrickRuffini But the more important point is that I'm not sure you can call Trumpism efficient when the price for that efficiency is that it seems to be limited to winning popular vote minorities. It may be a good strategy for the Senate and a fairly bad one for the House and the presidency.
@PatrickRuffini It's 325 not 296 -- Dems won the popular vote in FL by several points if you count votes in districts with uncontested races (which FL doesn't include in its tally).
@PatrickRuffini I guess I'm just saying that Trumpism hasn't been terribly successful as an electoral strategy so far. I'm not sure you can consider it emerging when it loses the popular vote for the presidency by 2 points and then by 8-9 points for the House two years later.
@PatrickRuffini The problem is that I'm not sure whether cosmpolitanism is the trend and Trumpism is the backlash or the other way around.

It's a pretty big advantage not to have to play a conference championship game, though. Imagine if Notre Dame were in the B1G West and had to play Ohio State to remain undefeated. Or in the ACC and had to play Clemson.

The @AP and most of the networks still have this race called for Valadao, which is just super lazy (and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it). Should have been uncalled 10 days ago.
We'd guess about 3K ballots left in Kern Co.—probably not reporting until next week—which should be very good for Cox. Likely likely also another 2.5K in Fresno, which should be decent for him. Valadao (R) should gain some back in Kings Co, though only 1750 ballots left there.

In some ways it helps Dems that this is fairly low-stakes. The difference between a 52-48 and 53-47 Senate is not enormous for 2 years (the seat is up again in '20) especially with Ds having the House. If this seat determined the majority, less chance of a lackluster GOP turnout.
I'm not sure what to make of the Mississippi Senate runoff but it's one of those races where Democrats both need their turnout to be very high and the GOP's to be very low. More like some of the non-Ossoff special elections last year than anything we saw on 11/6.

There's a rich history of presidents (Obama, Clinton, Reagan) recovering after bad midterms. But those presidents, to varying degrees, all made adjustments. They also benefited from improving economies whereas we may be near a peak now. Trump needs a course correction.
Trump will probably do better among independents in 2020 than the GOP did this year (at least if the economy stays good). The Democratic base is still bigger than the Republican one though and is likely to be very motivated. And he won't catch all the  breaks he did in 2016.
The Republican base turned out. But the Democratic base turned out too. And the Democratic base is *bigger*. And independents broke strongly against Republicans. The GOP base vote *may* be enough to win the Senate, but not the House or the presidency.
Here's my biggest takeaway from the midterms: https://t.co/ysjAje86Kf

@PatrickRuffini @binarybits @BudMusgrove I think Facebook is actually one of the less invisible hand-y platforms. Its algorithm (and the fact that the algorithm is so gameable) introduces a lot of noise and therefore makes it a messy gauge of what news consumers really want.
@PatrickRuffini @binarybits On the contrary I think what prevails in the long run and in the short run are quite different from one another, and one of the reasons Facebook's algorithms are badly designed is because they've never figured that out.
@PatrickRuffini @binarybits I don't mean to sound like a jerk but I've spent a lot more time looking at traffic data than you and if you talked to other publishers they'd mostly tell you the same thing.
@jpodhoretz @PatrickRuffini @binarybits I think Facebook doesn't know what they want and so their algorithms are shitty because any algorithm will be shitty if you don't know what you're trying to optimize for.
@PatrickRuffini @binarybits As a publisher, I see how our content performs on various platforms, and I think you're underestimating the extent to which Facebook's algorithms are just badly/weirdly designed. There's little correlation between what content is popular on Facebook and on every other platform.
@PatrickRuffini @binarybits I think that's probably wrong. Facebook isn't an invisible hand. They make an array of deliberate choices that affect which content performs well.
Basically the way to beat Pelosi would be to *quietly* gather support for an alternative candidate. Instead, the anti-Pelosi Dems have been noisy and clumsy but not able to advance any clear alternative.
There are good enough reasons for Dems to want to oust Pelosi. But they're the sorts of reasons (mostly revolving around her unpopularity) that it's hard for Dems to say out loud. Requires some real dexterity, whereas the anti-Pelosi Democrats are a fairly kludgy group.
@PatrickRuffini An alternative hypothesis is that they have weird hang-ups and have never been able to grasp that "short-term engagement on Facebook" is a poor and non-robust proxy for most of their business objectives, especially with publishers trying to actively game the algorithm.
If you're one of those news organizations that treated Clinton's private emails like they were a national emergency, the solution isn't to treat Ivanka's private emails like they're also a national emergency—rather, it's to acknowledge that you kinda fucked up on Clinton.
But in Midwestern districts where less than 25% of the population has a bachelor's degree, Democrats actually *lost* 2 seats, going from a 15-31 deficit to a 13-33 deficit.
OK, this is pretty nuts.		In Midwestern districts (+Pennsylvania, which I think of as part of the "political Midwest") where at least 35% of the population has a bachelors' degree, Democrats cleaned up, going from a 10-16 deficit in House seats to a 20-6 advantage.

@ClaraJeffery Nope. Apparently some coming, though.
The most recent updates have Cox (D) over-performing his *overall* post-election numbers (which are already pretty good) by about ~5 points, however, perhaps because they contain a larger share of provisionals. If that trend continues, he'd eventually pull ahead by ~500 votes.
Nathaniel Rakich (@baseballot) estimates about 4900 more ballots in Fresno, 2800 from Kern, 2300 from Kings, 800 from Tulare. *If* those estimates are right and votes come in the way they've come in since election day, we wind up with a margin of &lt;=100 votes.
It looks like that was only about half of what was left in Kern Co. So if there's another batch like this, Cox would pull slightly ahead.		https://t.co/z85vFdrX0d

OK, I find this pretty convincing on UT-4. So we're going to put it back in the Tossup bucket.		Basically, McAdams (D) only needs to do somewhat better in the remaining votes from Salt Lake Co. than in the Election Night count to catch Love (R). (cont...)		https://t.co/tE7U4s1Trf

@ElectProject I'm done. You're taking something incredibly simple (use the counted Senate vote to estimate who the undervotes would have gone to) and making it super complicated. You're the guy who pulls out his GPS and gets lost when he needs to walk down the street to buy a quart of milk.
@ElectProject I'm saying just look at the results from votes that were actually counted in the SENATE RACE IN BROWARD COUNTY. That's a way better and more direct measure of who would have won the undervote in the SENATE RACE IN BROWARD COUNTY than whatever the heck you're trying to do.
@ElectProject I'm saying those are weird and dumb assumptions. Go look at the data. In Duval County, Gillum got 4,000 more votes. In Pinellas County, he got 8,000 fewer. The margin in the Gov and Senate race margins differs a little bit in every county.
@ElectProject The objection is that the Gillum/DeSantis margin differs a bit in every county from the Scott/Nelson margin. Also, Nelson outperformed Gillum statewide. You're assuming that Nelson should only have gotten as many votes as Gillum when there's absolutely no reason to assume that.
@ElectProject My argument is that you're making this much more complicated than it needs to be by breaking governor votes down into DeSantis vs Gillum and not recognizing any possibility for voters to split their tickets.
@ElectProject The problem is that you should be looking at the total number of votes for governor instead of doing anything with DeSantis vs. Gillum. You're basically assuming that the margin in the Gov race should exactly match the margin in the Senate race, when there's no reason it should.

@ElectProject Nate Cohn (who I won't tag here so as not to flood his mentions) said you're wrong about that, and also that Nelson won the Election Day vote in Broward by a wide margin too. https://t.co/oE2Bov2Q8C
@ElectProject What does the Gov race have to do with it? You made some extremely weird calculation that isn't pertinent in any obvious way to the problem, when we have a *direct* measure of which Senate candidate people in those precincts preferred (i.e. how the non-undervotes broke down).
@ElectProject Right, which suggests that the Upshot's method is pretty robust. What do you think was wrong with it?
@ElectProject I literally don't understand your theory and everyone else's theory is really simple, which is that Nelson would have gotten most of the undervotes because he got most of the counted votes in the precincts where the undervote occurred. What is your counter argument to that?
@ElectProject Right, the Upshot did that, and showed their work, and came up with a ~9,800-vote swing to Nelson, which is pretty close to the margin he lost by. 		Of course the ballots had no vote for the *Senate*, that's why they were undervotes. But they mostly would have been for Nelson.
@ElectProject No it was people like the Upshot who are pretty good at what they do: https://t.co/mv7Ft9Ng0m
@ElectProject Where were the undervotes examined? Is there actually a publicly-available dataset where they were looking at a random sample of undervotes by hand?
@ElectProject I don't think your logic is sound and a lot of people who have looked at this more deeply disagree with it.
@ElectProject There were ~25K undervotes in Broward, Nelson won the counted votes by ~40%, so that gets you to about ~10K, which is about what the margin was. Not really that complicated tbh.
Do note, however, that Nelson actually picked up a fair number of votes, and this is within the margin where bad ballot design in Broward Co. maybe cost him the election.	https://t.co/kJzMQ3Amvd

About 60 million people turned out to vote for Democrats for the House this year. That is a **crazy** number. (Republicans got 45m votes in the 2010 wave.)		And this was sort of missed. Why so many stories about Trump voters in truck stops and not so many about "the resistance"?
Of course, this reflects 3 things we already knew: 1) Trump was elected despite losing the popular vote; 2) D's won by a big margin this year and 3) Turnout was VERY high.		But Trump is a very unpopular president, and I don't think that's totally sunk in yet in how he's covered.
There's not any precedent for an opposition party coming this close to matching the president's vote total from 2 years earlier. The closest to an exception was when Democratic House candidates in 1970 got 92% of Nixon's vote total from 1968. https://t.co/NOTLQnYI9z
Trump got 63m votes, Romney 61m, McCain 60m. Dem votes for the House this year should be very close to that range.
Seems likely Democrats will eventually get up to about 60m total votes for the House once unprocessed ballots from CA are tallied. Maybe a bit more (~61M?) based on what's left in other states. Those are similar numbers to what recent GOP *presidential* candidates have received.
ABC has not projected this race (CA-39) yet, but we're moving to Solid D on the basis of the AP call. Democrats won all the tossup races in California and might still pull off a big upset in CA-21 on top of that.	https://t.co/HenuDxtYQA
Assuming it gets up into the ~8.5 range, Democrats are also on track to have the largest House popular vote margin by either party in a midterm since 1986, when they it by 9.9 points. D's did win it by 10.6 points in 2008, but that was a presidential year.
Our final generic ballot average was D +8.7, which should come pretty close to the eventual popular vote margin. Once somewhat maligned, the generic ballot has been a quite accurate predictor of the House popular vote in recent election cycles. https://t.co/mEdFvBnO1a
Moreover, the pre-2017 reviews describe exactly the same problems (slow and surly service, dirty) that the author is worried was caused by the restaurant's newfound popularity. The baseline probability of a restaurant like that closing has to be quite high.
I say that because if you look at the Yelp reviews, it's clear that this restaurant was having problems *for years*. Was averaging about a 3-star review throughout 2014, for instance, which is really bad by Yelp standards over a sustained period. https://t.co/obDirmOOWf

RT @DaveAHopkins: Amy Klobuchar received 60.3% of the vote against a weak opponent in a state Hillary Clinton carried by 1.5% in 2016. Eliz…
Most of those are pretty unsurprising. You'd expect to see Romney and Beto on the list. But MA is an interesting one. Warren's performance was underwhelming: "only" a 24-point win in a state that voted for Clinton by 27 in a very blue year against a fairly obscure opponent.
If you fit a simple regression model based on incumbency and state partnership, the best Democratic Senate performances came in WV (Manchin), TX (Beto), VT (Bernie) and MN (Klobuchar). Best GOP ones were in UT (Romney), NJ (Hugin) and MA (Diehl). FL (Scott) also pretty good.
How'd they lose seats? They had a lot of incumbents up in very red states and the incumbency advantage was really small this year (only ~6 points). The diminishing incumbency advantage helped D's to knock off R incumbents in the House but hurt them in the Senate.
You can do fancy versions of this calculation, which adjust e.g. for partisanship or incumbency or weight by population, but you get back the same answer. The D performance in the Senate is consistent with a national environment that was 6-9 points D leaning (~same as House).
Democrats won the average Senate race (counting Sanders and King as Dems) by ~8 points, which almost exactly matches their margin in the House popular vote (currently 7.6 points and rising).

If Valadao is merely treading water in the other counties then 😬. Not that he's an underdog necessarily but would project to be verrrry close.
The issue for Valadao (R) is that Kern Co. hasn't reported in a while, and we suspect there are about ~6K uncounted ballots there, which would net out to a 1,500-2,000 vote gain for Cox (D), almost erasing Valadao's current districtwide lead.
This is another really bad report for Valadao (R). Kings Co. was supposed to be his stronghold. Only won the latest batch of ballots by ~3.5 points in a county he won by &gt;30 in the election night count. 	https://t.co/6B5OQLcITj

@RobertGehrke Were any of the Salt Lake Co. numbers today provisionals?
Meanwhile, Love (R) has semi-expectedly taken the lead in UT-4 as further mail ballots counted in Utah Co. The late-counted mail ballots were very good for her, but what's left now is provisionals, which are a different ballgame. We'll hold at Lean R. https://t.co/uUbkyO1aJK

TX-23: There was some weirdness in Medina Co. here earlier and might go to a recount but Hurd probably narrowly survived. Likely R.		FL-Sen: I guess we’ll wait for one of the networks to call it but not sure how Nelson has a path. Likely R and maybe should be Solid R.
NY-27: McMurray will have to do *very* well in absentee ballots in Erie Co. We’ll know about those next week. Not impossible but it's Likely R. 		CA-39: Don’t really see a path for a Young Kim (R) comeback but for the *time being* it’s close, so I guess we'll keep at Likely D.
CA-21: Anyone who still has this race “called” is just being stubborn. I’d rather be Valadao (R) but it’s a hair-raising finish. Lean R.		GA-7: Likely to go to a recount with Woodall (R) ahead by ~420. Likely R.
Quick update on the remaining uncalled races, in order of most-uncertain to least-uncertain:		UT-4: McAdams (D) leads but has been losing ground quickly. Waiting for provisional ballots next week. You could make a case for several different ratings here; we have at Lean R.

Here's a little Monte Carlo sim of the number of Dem pickups, based on my (admittedly subjective) assessment of the odds in each of the uncalled races. A 25% chance of 40+ seats, a 35% chance of 38 or fewer, and a 40% chance of 39 exactly. https://t.co/f2FKHPGZ1V
After UT-4 &amp; CA-21, the next-most-interesting race is GA-7, where Bourdeaux (D) trails by ~500 votes (and that should tighten after more provisionals are counted) and will get a recount. So D's would hit 40 if they win 2 of those 3—though I'm not sure if they're favorites in any.
We're currently projecting 39 Dem pickups, but there's a margin of error around around that with several other uncalled races. UT-4 and CA-21 in particular look highly uncertain at this stage. Could very easily wind up at 38, or at 40.
Golden (D) indeed wins ME-2 by ~1 point after second choices are accounted for, the @MESecOfState says. This is a rural, Trump-y district and a good pickup for Dems. https://t.co/UwzDbYVHwj

We moved CA-39 from Lean D to Likely D last night (not sure I remembered to notate that in this thread) so no further change in our rating here.
Young Kim (R) lead in CA-39 down to just 121 votes. In the LA-area districts, this really has been like clockwork with D's gaining with every update. I kinda feel bad for candidates who slowly see their lead slip away a couple of points at a time. https://t.co/6io5LWEqiv
Valadao led by ~7.5% when the race was called for him a week ago; now the lead is down to ~2%. Still a LOT of uncounted ballots. This is clearly a case where the right thing to do journalistically is to un-call the race.
Back in CA-21, Valadao (R) wins a batch of ballots from his stronghold in Kings Co., but by a considerably smaller margin (14 points) than his previous ~30-point margin in the county. We're moving to Lean R from Likely R; today a bit scary for Valadao.	https://t.co/WqJVUVkqGW
There's a case for making this Lean R, but (i) there's a *lot* of precinct-level variation within Salt Lake Co., which makes these numbers harder to contextualize; (ii) Love sued to stop the vote count in Salt Lake Co. earlier today, which is a bit weird. https://t.co/Q2XxL1Zose

New votes from Salt Lake County in UT-4. If I'm doing the math right, they show Love (R) gaining ~6300 votes and McAdams (D) gaining ~6000. Not good for McAdams, since this is a county where he won the Election Day vote. We're moving this race to Toss-Up. https://t.co/OkJxxwmmSf
But there are a lot of rough assumptions in that calculation, including in guesstimating how much CD-21 vote there is left from the overall country numbers. My guess (we don't have a formal model) is that Cox has maybe a 20-25% chance, right on the border of Lean R vs. Likely R.
Based on how the vote has been coming in *since* Thursday, e.g. with Cox actually winning Fresno, we'd guess that Cox would gain about ~500 additional votes once the vote is fully reported from all four counties in CD-21; he currently trails by ~1900.
If Cox (D) is winning Fresno County ballots by ~9 points, then CA-21, which most news organizations called for Valadao (R), is also very interesting. We're gonna stick with Likely R for now but this race shouldn't be considered called or safe R IMO.	https://t.co/iEHewMipAf
Avenatti was bad news from day 1.
PS: I'm not usually a super endorse-y guy. But I've spent a lot of time with the founders and they value the things I value in a news publication, i.e. depth rather than breadth. Plus, they used this model successfully in the Netherlands. So think this has a good shot of working.
The most uncertain races at this point are:	ME-2—Golden (D) likely to go ahead once 2nd choices are counted, but that hasn't happened yet and there's a lawsuit.	UT-4—McAdams (D) is a slight favorite but tightened a lot. Not far from a tossup.	GA-7—Woodall (R) leads by ~500 votes.
One of the least surprising of the uncalled races, but NJ-3 moves from Likely D to Solid D. (For those scoring at home, Solid D = essentially certain. Technically speaking, races only go to 100% "called" once our partners at ABC News project them.) https://t.co/OPpM2QxkpC

To be clear, recounts themselves aren't all that interesting, and do not unto themselves imply all that much uncertainty about the outcome. Recounts where there are &lt;=500 votes separating the candidates are a different story, however.
Of the various long-shot uncalled races, GA-7 is among the most interesting. Bourdeaux (D) trails by ~500 and there are a few hundred provisionals to count. She probably can't pull ahead in regulation but a recount is likely. Keeping at Likely R but 👀. https://t.co/UF6zXmS17X
We're not conservative for conservatism's sake. This year, we were *more* confident in D odds in the House than the consensus. Same for Obama in 2012. But much less confident on Hillary in 2016. Because in each case, that's what the data said if you looked at it rigorously.
If we'd given Trump a 30% chance and everyone else had given him a 45% chance, we wouldn't consider our 2016 forecast to have been too great. But the consensus was about a 15% chance. Some people gave him a 1% chance. So, yeah, we think 2016 counts as a good forecast.
We're criticized 30 ways from Sunday whether our forecast is good, bad or indifferent, so we're sure as heck going to congratulate ourselves when we hit right on the nose (like this year), as well as when we give underdogs better odds than the consensus and they win (as in 2016). https://t.co/n3nvNPaB3W
We're moving CA-10 from Likely D to Solid D, and CA-45, where Katie Porter has taken the lead over Mimi Walters, from Lean D to Likely D. We still have CA-39 at Lean D but that's pretty generous to Young Kim (R), whose lead is down to 0.4 points and keeps slipping.
@baseballot @Redistrict @RobertGehrke Yeah, we tracked down (via @RobertGehrke) better data on outstanding ballots.		If the remaining Salt Lake vote looks like the overall vote there so far (McAdams +9%) he should win.		But post-Election Day counts have been better for Love than the overall count so it's interesting.
McAdams currently leads by 1,350 overall. Love is winning almost 3:1 in Utah Co., which would imply that she'd net another 2,700 votes from there. But she really needs to hold him to a near-draw in Salt Lake Co. If McAdams wins the rest of Salt Lake by even 5%, he probably wins.
This is a good point, and if you compare to *2016* voting instead of 2014, you get a pretty different result. With that said, this report says there's about 5,500 in Utah County and 34,500 in Salt Lake County left to go. https://t.co/owjWtDL1Mg https://t.co/KCwnWzxRoJ
@jonathanchait @FiveThirtyEight The main issue is that Michigan lost to Notre Dame, so tOSU or Oklahoma probably get in ahead of a 1-loss ND team, but Michigan might not if the committee is looking at head-to-head play.
Right now, we're showing 169% of the total 2014 vote is in from (very red) Utah County, and 155% of the total 2014 vote is in from (blue) Salt Lake County. So that *might* be an indication that there's a longer way to go in Salt Lake than in Utah Co. But a LOT of unknowns here.
We're going to dial this back to "Lean D" from "Likely D". McAdams gained ground as some Salt Lake County ballots were reported, but his margins were not as wide as on Election Day and frankly it's not totally clear how much remaining vote is outstanding in which counties.
@davidshor Because I thought people would be confused if I listed both ME and ME-2. It's in Tier 3, I think....
I mean, it's something kinda like this, or at least this is where my priors are:	Tier 1: PA, MI, FL, WI	Tier 2: NC, AZ, NV, MN, NH	Tier 2.5 (depends on a a lot of things, could wind up much higher or lower): TX	Tier 3: CO, VA, OH, GA, IA, ME-2, NE-2
I agree that MI + PA + WI + FL are the most important states if you had to guess (not really NH because it doesn't have enough electoral votes) but it seems like @prioritiesUSA is narrowing the map too quickly, which was one of the mistakes Clinton made in 2016. https://t.co/MppK0Khuj7

@Redistrict In ballots counted since Thursday AM in Kings, Valadao has led by "only" 15 points. It just seems the later ballots are counted, the better they've been for Cox. Not crazy IMO to think he could lose the remaining Kings ballots by, say, only 10 points, win Fresno, dominate Kern.
@Redistrict Yeah, see the next post in the thread. Kings Co. is why he'll probably win. I just don't think the race belongs in the "called" category and tend to think AP would not put it there if they were looking at it with a fresh set of eyes.
The real strength for Valadao is Kings Co., where he's led by 24 points in the post Election Night count so far. (He was ahead by 31 on 11/6.)		Cox's path is to breakeven in Fresno, and hope remaining Kern ballots outweigh Kings + Valadao's current lead. Not easy but not crazy.
As of early Wed. morning, Valadao (R) led ballots counted in Fresno Co. by 13 points. He's led ballots counted *since* then in Fresno Co. by just 2 points.		Cox (D) led the Kern Co. count on Election Night by 7 points. Ballots *since* then have come in for him by *27* points.
We think Valadao is the favorite; hence, the Likely R rating. But can this race be considered 99.5% safe or whatever threshold one uses to designate a "called" race? We'd say pretty clearly not based on the info we have so far.
Per @baseballot, we expect that the plurality of remaining ballots are in Fresno County, which Valadao (R) won on election day. But there are a lot of unknowns here, including how different late-counted ballots are from those counted on election night.
Even though both AP &amp; all the networks called this race, we're moving CA-21 out of "called" R and into likely R as the race has suddenly tightened a lot. Trying to learn more about where there are remaining ballots outstanding. https://t.co/V60cHOvIK0
...we're in a different world now that early voting and (in some states) mail voting has become more common, and that can make Election Night vote counts more misleading in various ways. Probably time for a rethink before there are some really major miscalls.
Decisions on whether or not to "call" races are really tricky...news orgs have to make thousands of decisions on which races to call in a single evening, and they get a lot of shit if they're too slow to make calls (as well as if they're too quick). With that said... https://t.co/Z9fi7rHYzw
Just had a flash-forward to July 2020 and there's a big argument on here about whether choosing Beto as their VP could help the Democratic nominee "compete" in Texas.

Recounts don't overturn 5-figure leads unless there was something *systemically* wrong. Which I guess is possible in FL-Sen given the weird Broward County undervote but seems highly unlikely in FL-Gov.
@Redistrict Are there any *called* California districts that shouldn't have been called? Are Hunter and Valadao totally safe? We haven't seen the margins on those districts tighten too much, but are keeping an eye on them.
Here's one last way to look at it.		In the first two years with Obama as party leader, Republicans gained a net of +43 House seats (-21 2008, +1 special elections, +63 2010)		In the first two years with Trump, Dems are on pace for +45 (+6 2016, +1 special elections, +38 2018).
There *is* one difference between 2018 and 2010, though, which is that the swing from 2008 (D +10.6) to 2010 (R+ 6.8) was enormous because 2008 had been a very blue year. This year's swing only about half as large, because Rs had a middling 2016 (R +1.1 popular vote; lost seats).
For comparison, the House popular vote in things that are widely considered to be wave elections:	2010: R +6.8	2006: D +8.0	1994: R +7.1	So if we wind up at ~D +7.5 or so, we'll be pretty much exactly in line with those years. https://t.co/BMil3Uuw8j
TBH, I think a lot of these are fairly conservative, i.e. could be pushed from “Lean” into “Likely” or “Solid”. But there’s been enough weirdness this year that it probably can’t hurt to be cautious. Also keeping an eye on whether any races in CA may have been called prematurely.
Here’s our current characterization of the uncalled Congressional races.		Solid D (&gt;=95%): CA-48, CA-49, NM-2	Likely D (~85%): CA-10, NJ-3, NY-22, UT-4	Lean D (~65%): CA-39, CA-45, ME-2, AZ-Sen	Tossup (~50%): 	Lean R: FL-Sen	Likely R: GA-7, NY-27, TX-23, MS-Sen (runoff)	Solid R:

We found out that in some very red states, 2 + 3 was enough to outweigh #1, so Democrats lost MO, ND and IN (though not WV or MT). Those 5 states voted for Trump by average of 27 points.		#1 (that is was a real blue year) is clear if you look swing states and/or the House though.
Basically Tuesday's results in the House/Senate can be explained by 3 things.	1—It was a very blue political environment	2—Polarization is increasing (ticket-splitting is decreasing)	3—Incumbency no longer protects a candidate all that much
@katherinemiller I think one could argue that it was on its last legs as a swing state and the combination of the Senate landslide this year and the Gov landslide last year means it's not anymore.
Among Senate races held in swing states, Democrats won in PA, OH, MI, WI, MN (x2), NV and VA.		FL and AZ are uncalled.		Republicans haven't yet won any Senate races yet in what you'd think of a presidential swing states. MO is the closest but it's quite red now.

Overall, though, we've gone from what looked like what looked like about D +33 House and R +3-4 Senate late Tuesday night to what now could wind up more like D +36-40 House and R +1-2 Senate. Probably enough to merit a reassessment.
Arizona goes from Lean R to Tossup. There's a case for Lean D here but there are also potential pockets of McSally strength that have yet to update their vote totals, so let's see where we are at the end of the evening.

These are very good numbers—polls/forecast had a really good night.		If anything, they were a little *too* good. The model was only expecting to get 92-94% of its calls right instead of 95-96%. So it was slightly under-confident; there weren't as many upsets as it expected.
Deluxe model: 488 of 506 correct (96.4%)	Classic: 484 of 506 correct (95.7%)	Lite: 481 of 506 correct (95.0%)		No overall bias in the calculations: In the Deluxe model, D's won 96.1% of the races in which they were favored, and R's won 96.7%.
OK, here's a quick, preliminary review of how many "calls" the 538 model got right. These are for House (n=435), Senate (n=35) and Governors (=36) races combined. There are a number of uncalled races in each category, so I'm making educated guesses about the outcomes of those.
We are moving Florida from Likely R to Lean R. The vote count keeps tightening and there's a big, weird issue regarding an undervote in Broward County.	https://t.co/IPFgyRNPwT

Thread https://t.co/T14jUe9rlG
The newly-elected D House members also strike me as being fairly ready for duty—there weren't the sort of accidental winners you sometimes see in wave elections. A lot of them are liable to be fairly tough incumbents, although the incumbency advantage is weaker than it once was.
If Dems hold the House in 2020, it may get easier after that because the map will probably be less gerrymandered thereafter. I kind of wonder if we're entering an era where Congress will be split (D House, R Senate) a lot more often.
That popular vote margin is going to rise—I'm guessing to about 7%, maybe 7.5%—but Democrats did a really good job capitalizing on their opportunities. https://t.co/wAZEHslrc6
We're also moving GA-7—another one where the networks differ—from "called R" to Likely R. The Dem trails by 900 votes here but there's 20K absentee votes still left to be counted. https://t.co/2p5vDKarsP
@PoliticsWolf @hezaproject It's probably worth correcting for in some circumstances, but it doesn't make *that* much difference when analyzing Congressional performance, and a sloppily-designed correction might be worse than going with the uncorrected numbers.
@PoliticsWolf @hezaproject I've spent a lot of time studying this issue with respect to Congressional races—so not sure where your smugness is coming from. Uncontested races produce significantly lower turnout, which mitigates the effects. And extrapolating what would have happened is not straightforward.
@PoliticsWolf For another, there are endogeneity problems. Failing to contest a seat is sign of weakness, so inferring what the result would have been from the outcomes of *contested* seats isn't proper.
@PoliticsWolf I've spent a lot of time looking at this particular issue but I don't think it's necessarily obvious that you should correct for uncontested races. For one thing, they feature a lot of undervoting, so they may not affect the overall margin as much as you'd think.
Among the uncalled Senate races, we have Arizona as Lean R, Florida as Likely R, and the Mississippi special election also as Likely R.		Republicans will net 3 seats from Democrats if they win all 3.
NY-27 (Chris Collins) is another one where there's some disagreement on whether the race can be called. After looking at it, we're moving it to Likely R. The margin is ~2700 with ~10K absentees to be counted. Highly likely Collins wins but not 100% safe. https://t.co/bOeEXtYdMd
@DemFromCT Yes, GA-7 for the Republican. Some networks (not our @ABC colleagues!) incorrectly called it for the Democrat on Tuesday night.
@samstein I don't think a D can afford to ignore Florida under any circumstances, or at least not until very late in the game. Just not enough robustness in the plan without it as a backup option. Also, Amendment 4 passing will likely make it a tiny bit more Democratic than in 2016.
Missed one: We're also rating TX-23, which has been called by some networks and not others, as Likely R.		Most likely, though, it will be the five in the middle, CA-10, CA-39, CA-45, ME-2 and NJ-3, that determine where we end up on the scale from D+35 to D+40.
Here's how we rate the remaining uncalled races. In several of these, there are concessions but no official @ABC or AP call:	Solid D (&gt;=95%)—CA-48, CA-49, WA-8	Likely D (~85%)—NM-2, UT-4	Lean D (~65%)—CA-10, CA-39	Tossup (~50%)—CA-45, ME-2, NJ-3	Lean R	Likely R	Solid R—MN-1, NC-9

The Sunbelt Strategy may be tempting to Dems, especially if Texas is now more competitive. But the Northern Path—Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania—sure looks a lot easier. What you really don't want it to get stuck in between the two, which is sort of what happened to Clinton.
Basically, a Democrat hoping to win the WH can undertake one of 2 strategies:	1) Northern Path—Flip WI, MI &amp; PA back to blue. Hold MN.	2) Sunbelt Strategy—Lose all the above states, but win FL and any of NC, AZ, TX(!), GA.
Of course, Tuesday was a very blue night. But if you shift every state toward Republicans by 6 points, which roughly reflects what you'd get in a neutral political environment, here's what the map looks like. This looks like a pretty fair fight for the Electoral College. https://t.co/HKe1z66C22
Democrats did very well in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which are basically the tipping-point states right now. I posted this map last night, but here's who won each state in the popular vote for the House in each state. Dark blue / dark red = won by at least 5 points. https://t.co/Q7PLB6d4Ob

There were some outliers on the other side too. But no other prolific public pollster is as consistently skewed toward one side as Rasmussen. They look like geniuses on the occasions when polls miss low on R's across the board. But most of the time they're one of the worst polls.
Democrats currently lead the popular vote in the U.S. House by about 6 million votes or 6% of the vote. Likely to rise to around 8 million votes and 7-8% once all votes are counted.

@JayCostTWS It's one of those races that might have been a legendary upset if it wasn't a D+7 year.
@JayCostTWS The problem with that map is that Michigan is probably blue if WI and PA are too. John James was a really good candidate but otherwise D's had a very good night in all 3 states.
One obvious takeaway from last night is that Trump doesn't defy gravity. His party got pretty much the result you'd expect from a president with a 42% approval rating, although with the benefit of most races being in very red states/districts.

Deluxe had D+36 before the night began, so it would be pretty cool/lucky if we hit that number on the nose.
It's a bit more art than science at this point, but we were at ~D+33 as of late last night, and now we're at more like ~D+36 after reviewing the status of uncalled races. California's a big mess so definitely a margin of error on that calculation.
This had seemed to be one of the tougher pickups for Democrats among the uncalled races. Now probably a tossup for R's at best, if that reporting is correct. https://t.co/Sm5GsqJHCj
@PoliticsWolf I'm not sure I agree because there's a lot of undervoting in uncontested districts, so the overall effect on aggregated vote counts is pretty marginal. Florida doesn't count votes in uncontested districts at all, though, which definitely requires an adjustment.
That sure looks familiar! It's exactly the Obama 2012 map, less Ohio.
Here's who won the popular vote for the U.S. House in each state, with an adjustment in Florida to account for districts where votes were not counted because the Democrat ran uncontested. https://t.co/eEX4lJswsG
Erg, have to correct/clarify here. The GOP overperformance in Florida vote stems partly from the fact that there were 4 uncontested districts in Florida, all won by Dems, and FL doesn't count votes in uncontested districts. Adjust for that, and D's likely won the FL popular vote.
@micahcohen Hope you realize that we're launching the 2020 now-cast on Friday.
The GOP Senate gain could still end up anywhere from +3 to 0 (although FL and MS are longshots for Democrats). https://t.co/KKPLJcRxg1
@SeanTrende @xenocryptsite @kkondik Also the fact that incumbents were really unpopular this cycle is a very important part of the puzzle.
@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers Join one of the threads where people are talking about different modeling strategies for how to build electoral forecasts. Those are a lot more interesting than rehashing these boring prediction markets arguments, which have been exactly the same for 10 years.
@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers According to the fact that this has been studied like 600 times over the years, and that's the consensus of the literature. A more comprehensive study (not just focusing on the Senate) would very likely find a tie this year too. It's just not a very interesting topic.
Democratic candidates for the House lost the popular vote in Texas by 3.5 points, as compared to 5.5 points in Florida. They're pretty similar states, in some ways. Are we sure that Florida is a swing state and Texas isn't?
@doug_rivers Umm, unless I'm mistaken, you guys didn't publish forecasts for individual districts? (Publishing post-facto doesn't count.) And it looks like 538's Deluxe model will be a little closer on the overall seat count? (Though that's basically a tie.)
Democrats (39.9m) and Republicans (39.2m) received about the same amount of votes for governor. (Again, the D total will grow some because California.) 		n the Senate, Dem candidates have 44.5m votes and GOP ones 32.5m so far.
Dems currently lead in the popular vote for the U.S. House by 5.4 percentage points. However, there are a LOT of uncounted votes and they're likely to be disproportionately Democratic (e.g. from California). So we'll probably wind up somewhere in the vicinity of 7.5, I'd guess.
@JustinWolfers @HarryDCrane Forecasting individual House races is also a hard problem, in that there's not a lot of polling data as compared to the Senate.		If you want to break it down, betting markets seem to add value on low-difficulty problems but *subtract* value on problems that require more skill.
@JustinWolfers @HarryDCrane But a lot of our "edge" comes from knowing how to model non-independence/ correlations. There was a wide spread between 538 and prediction markets on Electoral College odds in 2008, 2012 and 2016 and in each case we had the right side of the bet. Same in the House this year.
@JustinWolfers @HarryDCrane But I don't care that much. This has been studied MANY times over many years. The answer is that it's basically a tie, which means that betting markets can't *consistently* add value over algorithms *published on free websites*. That's a very bad fact for prediction markets.
@JustinWolfers @HarryDCrane There are ~100 were competitive House races so seems like that would give you the largest sample?
@JustinWolfers @HarryDCrane If you wanted overall odds on the House, 538 was a lot more accurate.	If you wanted odds on individual Senate races, maybe PredictIt?, but that depends on several uncalled races going their way.	For individual House races, I'd *guess* that we were much better. Not sure about gov.
@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers There have been many betting market vs 538 studies, and their conclusions are inconclusive. Sometimes 538 is little better, sometimes the markets are. That's a TERRIBLE result for prediction markets. It means they add no marginal value relative to 538, which is public and free.
@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers The other thing that's sort of stupid about these studies is that PredictIt can and does piggyback off 538. The best algorithms are in the public domain in this field, unlike in most others (e.g sports betting). What would PredictIt look like in a world without 538 as an anchor?
@HarryDCrane @JustinWolfers The context for my calling PredictIt "dumb" was *specifically* about the overall House odds, though! Those prices were dumb as hell because it's months of work to build a good House model and all the people who tried to build rigorous models found PredictIt's odds were way off.
Not surprised that the Deluxe model did super well, since it borrows from expert ratings (e.g. Cook) as well as Upshot polls. Sometimes it even felt like there was an implicit collaboration between 538, Upshot and Cook. etc., that turned out to make pretty darned good forecasts. https://t.co/4hUDyEZfFj
@BrendanNyhan @DavMicRot We think we have a massive edge though in constructing topline odds and probability distributions when it comes to the complex stuff—overall odds on the Electoral College, the House the Senate and various parlays therein. We've consistently kicked PredictIt's ass on those.
@BrendanNyhan @DavMicRot We also wouldn't have advanced blindly making all these bets. In some cases, markets have intel on factors that we'd consider relevant but which don't belong in a formal mode. (The Deluxe version of the model, which factors in expert rating, partly gets there but not totally.)
@BrendanNyhan @DavMicRot This is very cherry-picked. He's ignoring the overall House odds, where PredictIt was way off and where we'd have bet a huge amount of money &amp; was the source of most of our criticism. Ignoring individual Gov and House races. And assuming several uncalled races will go his way.
One other stray thought from tonight is that the Senate is a very big, very long-term problem for Democrats. They had plenty of encouraging results tonight but they were really concentrated in high-population states that (like other states) only have 2 senators.
Got a bit lost in the evening, but Amendment 4 passing in Florida, which restores voting rights to people with former felony convictions, is big deal that will have implications for 2020 and beyond.
Doing any kind of data-related work on election night is hard because things are moving at 20x the speed you're used to, it's very hard to simulate real-world stressors when you're testing, and it's easy to make both Type I (overreaction) and Type II (under-reaction) errors.
Although he lost, a lot of the anti-Beto takes are looking pretty dumb. Dems will pick up 2-3 House seats in a very gerrymandered state. Massive increase in turnout. https://t.co/3cXbWLZlZn
Good chance that the House, Senate and presidential race will *all* be competitive in 2020.

The joint probabilities are as follows, per our Deluxe model.	D Senate + D House: 18%	D Senate + R House: &lt;1%	R Senate + D House: 68%	R Senate + R House: 14%		So still better than a 30% chance that *either* the House or the Senate will result in an upset tonight. Pretty exciting!
The Senate forecast is almost the polar opposite. Republicans are 5 in 6 favorites, per our Deluxe forecast, and 4 in 5 favorites according to our Lite and Classic versions. The 80 percent range of most likely outcomes runs from D's gaining 2 seats, to R's gaining 3-4. https://t.co/wmFtxlVs92
The Lite version of our model, which is based polls only, is slightly more conservative, giving Dems a 4 in 5 chance. But it also shows an even wider range: D+17 to D+61.		The Classic model gives Democrats a 7 in 8 chance has a range that runs from D+21 to D+59.
Our final forecasts are up (!). Nothing really changed.		The Deluxe version of our House model gives Democrats a 6 in 7 chance of winning the House and the GOP a 1 in 7 chance.

Whoa Gallup actually published a likely voter generic ballot poll (D +11). https://t.co/w5Z6YzJ2IT
A lot of individual races are *unsettled*. We show 13 Senate races and ~100 House races as still being competitive. There are favorites in each chamber (D's in House, R's in Senate) but that comes from winning enough of those races, which comes down to the ground level.
Our cutoff for new polls is 10:30am this morning. After that, we'll run our final forecast, but we'll be very surprised if much of anything changes.
@BrendanNyhan @PredictIt @Betfair The literature I've read is pretty mixed; they seem to do better in low-information elections like e.g. poorly-polled presidential primaries, but worse in well-polled, data-rich elections. Also, it's easy to design bad models so 538 should be the only comparison that matters. ;-)
@BrendanNyhan @PredictIt @Betfair I'm not sure why we're supposed to default toward caring about these markets? A lot of them are poorly structured. They don't have a great track record, especially when they deviate from models. People with real money to bet (e.g. hedge funds) would not use PredictIt for it.
@BrendanNyhan @PredictIt @Betfair The overall price on D House chances at PredictIt dropped by 4 percentage points this morning after the Rasmussen generic ballot poll came out. That's... not something that would happen in a market where skilled traders prevailed.
RT @micahcohen: Please take the next 2-3 hours and read ALL the recent midterm coverage on @FiveThirtyEight — our team spent many long hour…
Put another way, I feel good about the 6-in-7 (~85%) chance our model gives Dems. We deliberately use models to NOT go by gut-feel, but it aligns with my intuition. I can't control whether the 6-in-7 or the 1-in-7 comes up—that's up to voters—but I think those are the right odds.
Overall, this has not been the easiest election to forecast, but also not the hardest. There's pretty good consensus among different models/experts. Our forecast has been quite stable. There's been a lot more good polling in the House than usual, thanks in part to @UpshotNYT.
Moreover, while district-level data is the most important part of the story, at a macro level the D position is about what you'd expect given historical trends in midterms &amp; an unpopular POTUS. Seat swings are the norm in midterms &amp; in many ways this is a fairly typical midterm.
There's some nuance here so I'd encourage you to read the whole thing. But the essence of it is that our model thinks Democrats' position is pretty robust, based on how many districts they're competing in. It's more like Obama's position in 2012 than Clinton's in 2016. https://t.co/JxtB5nsREO
We're out with our final major big-picture overview of the House! We'll keep updating the numbers through mid-morning tomorrow if any late polls come out, but I highly doubt that anything will change much. https://t.co/2ZfuoSzRyf
Not a huge change exactly but Democrats' chances to win the Senate have inched forward to ~20% from ~15%, partly on the basis of some weird polling in Mississippi.	https://t.co/8GwBiterR9
@MattGlassman312 @BrendanNyhan @PredictWise Like, some tech-savvy reporter should do a story on what the fuck has happened to these markets. They're very #MAGA-y now and full of traders who think polls are fake news and Rasmussen Reports is the only reliable pollster.

@MattGlassman312 @BrendanNyhan @PredictWise It's not just favorite-longshot bias. The prices in individual Gov/Senate races (which are a lot easier to model than the overall House/Senate odds) also show a big pro-GOP bias. There was a betting site last week that that showed Elizabeth Warren (!) with a 15% chance of losing.

This is the single most terrifying bit of poll-related data for Republicans, in that Democrats made gains in a pretty diverse array of districts, which might lead one to wonder what's happening in the districts that *haven't* been polled recently. https://t.co/Os8kc9QqoX
I'm not kidding about this, at all. Also note that the 2 most recent polls showed a tie and Cruz's lead down to 3 points, although note that the former poll was from a D-affiliated group.
Only one Texas Senate poll with November field dates. It actually didn't get polled enough at the end here. https://t.co/GXbUzmb8Xe https://t.co/9U7B2LXoxg
RT @baseballot: Excited for the election to be over after tomorrow? No dice! At least five races could go into extra innings. https://t.co/…
And in the Senate, there's even more alignment, so much so that it's barely even worth this tweet. All the models show GOP chances at about ~85%. There are some disagreements over IN and MO, but all agree Democrats have a tough (but not impossible) map.
My point is just—nobody is really going out on a limb. Or if we are, it's the same limb. People working independently from one another, looking at the district-by-district map in rigorous ways, are coming up with pretty similar answers to one another, much more so than in 2016.
There's also pretty strong agreement among the various probabilistic forecasters on odds of a D House majority:		@ORACLE_of_Blair: 75%	@gelliottmorris: 79%	538 Lite / Classic / Deluxe: 80% / 87% / 85%	@TheEconomist: 86%	@YouGovUS: 89%	Optimus/@DecisionDeskHQ: 95%
Our model (and other people's models) also tends to show a longer and fatter D tail than the experts. We'd pretty happily bet on a D gain of 43+ seats **if given 3:1 odds**, for instance, and I'm not sure that they would. But, again, those are pretty minor disagreements.
If you really want to dig in, I think we and Sabato are toward the higher end of that range, Inside Elections toward the lower end, Cook in the middle, but those are pretty small differences.
There's now quite good alignment between the FiveThirtyEight model and race ratings put out by @CookPolitical @InsideElections and @LarrySabato's Crystal Ball. All point toward a modal range of D's gaining like 28-42 seats. R majority still possible. Higher D gains also possible.
Because Republicans are playing so much defense in the House, Democrats' strategy is pretty robust, maybe to a greater degree than appreciated.	Likewise, because Democrats are playing so much defense in the Senate, Republicans' strategy is pretty robust.
The big difference between this year and 2016 is that a normal-sized (2-3 point) polling error might NOT be enough for Democrats to win the Senate or Republicans to win the House, respectively. It would make them close, however.

This is continuing to hold true—for instance, in Missouri this morning. When the "gold standard" academic/media pollsters weigh in on a Senate race, they often show pretty different results (usually a couple of points more favorable to Democrats) than the other polls. https://t.co/AEXNIAD0jZ
CNN has Dems +13 (!) and Morning Consult has Dems only +3 (!) so they're on the kudos list so far for not herding.
A whole mess of polling coming in tonight, but not a lot to deter you from the thesis that the most likely outcome is a split (D House, R Senate). https://t.co/28UPVWhpSw
IMO pollsters should get a lot of credit for polling races that others are skipping. It's easy to be way off on the margin on these states (although, you probably won't call the *winner* wrong in Wyoming) especially if you can't cheat by looking at other pollsters' results.
Now these hipsters polled Wyoming https://t.co/CQ0bAAkXe3
Is that a bad result for Democrats? Yeah, it's a blue year and there's been a lot of (sometimes wasteful IMO) media attention to the race. But it seems like a pretty good result for Democrats, if you know anything about TX and scratch even half a nail's-width beneath the surface.
If polls are exactly right:	—Beto will lose to Cruz by ~5 points.	—Ds will win 1-2 House seats (most likely candidates are TX-7, TX-32, TX-23) that they probably wouldn't have otherwise.	—Ds will turn out a lot of voters for the first time in a state with 36 electoral votes.
The other big problem with this article is that it seems to have been written in an alternate reality in which Texas is a purple state and not a red one that hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since Lloyd Bentsen.

@SeanTrende @jamespmanley I dunno it feels kinda 2012-ish to me. (In the House, the D position hasn't gotten any better in the Senate IMO.) A Republican hold / Romney win is totally plausible in an a priori sense. But the more you dig in locally the worse it looks.
@SeanTrende @jamespmanley The problem for Republicans isn't the macro indicators (bad but salvageable) so much as the local/micro ones. It's a bit of the reverse case of Hillary in 2016 imo.

We're getting a lot of 7s, 8s and 9s here. A couple 10s and 11s. A couple 5s and 6s. Kudos to any pollsters willing to go outside that range because there's usually a lot of herding at the end here.
Democrats lead by 8.3 percentage points in our generic ballot average, a dramatic reversal from 10 days ago when they led by 8.2 percentage points. https://t.co/nSPeKmDTNc
I like Politico a lot these days. But they're definitely on the traditional side. This is a good example of how traditional political coverage involves making lots of **predictions** about election outcomes, in terms of which stories are written and how they're framed.

@doug_rivers @davidshor What do you think the odds are that Dems win 45+ seats? You really think the odds are 50:1 against, or anywhere in that ballpark? That's what your model says.
@B9lyEquivocal You know what, though? I spent months on that chapter and talked to dozens of people. A lot of climate scientists thought quite highly of the chapter and a few didn't. I'm *absolutely* willing to accept criticism from someone who spends 3 months deeply reporting on a topic.

@doug_rivers @davidshor I think the confidence interval on your House forecast is **obviously** wrong (too narrow by a factor of 2-3X) and suggest you're a little too caught up in the technicalities and have lost the forest for the trees about understanding the real-world uncertainties here.
@Nate_Cohn @Redistrict MI-8 was on track to be the tipping point district at one point but your new poll is going to ruin that I'm pretty sure.
@doug_rivers @davidshor I get that selection bias is a problem. I think there's also a point at which you smooth away a lot of the information in a dataset.		Also, as @davidshor says, this doesn't have much to do with MRP, which doesn't do too great out-of-sample when you don't already know the result.
@doug_rivers @davidshor There was a *real* swing toward Trump late in 2016 and that's one reason our model was more accurate than most other people's. It didn't overly smooth the data.

What this chart basically shows is de facto segregation. Basically, if a state has a lot of white people, it votes homogeneously across precincts/counties. If it has a lot of black people, it doesn't, and you really need know where the vote is coming in from.
Here's a "fun" list. This table lists how much precinct-to-precinct variation there is in the vote in each state. In states with a lot of variation (e.g. GA), you need to wait longer for returns to become reliable, or you at least need to know where the votes are coming from. https://t.co/k2J8XAcOoE
@davidshor It's a good way of getting you 80% of the way to a good answer, but we already have a lot of ways to get to 80%.
(Whispers: I do sorta think there's a point at which you can emphasize the uncertainty *too much* when talking about say an 80/20 forecast. I don't think we're at that point yet because people need to hear it after 2016. But, there's a point.)
I wish I could forgive you from not knowing how math works, but some things are truly unpardonable. https://t.co/O8IIcSpC13
Our Classic and Deluxe models have the breakeven point at 5.7. Our Lite model, on the other hand, expects Dems to waste a lot of votes in blue districts and has it at 7.2. YouGov looks like they have it at 4-5. So, there's considerable uncertainty. But 7 may be on the high side.
People have been using a 7-point popular vote win as a benchmark for D majority, but that's *probably* out of date, and a little too high. Doesn't account for PA redistricting, GOP retirements, Democratic $$, and other ground-level factors that have helped Democrats.
...namely, that they show Democrats winning 30 seats (they need 23 for the majority) with a popular vote win of "only" 5.5 percentage points. Suggests the breakeven point for Democrats (when they become more likely than not to win the House) is a 4-5 point popular vote win.
YouGov has Dems with an 89% chance to win the House. (They didn't list the probability in their write-up but you can calculate it from the chart.) 		I think their range of outcomes is too narrow (and I'm not super in love with MRP) but there's something pretty interesting here… https://t.co/HftcwZJGR1
There used to be a big crescendo of polls in the final weekend. But we didn't really see that in 2016 and we aren't seeing it this year. Polling volume fairly high, but not really much higher than the last few weeks. https://t.co/LIIUS5tP9F
Let me amend that first tweet slightly: Of course you could *claim* there's momentum. If you want to claim there's some for D's, you could look at pretty strong district polls. And for R's, the (slight) tightening on the generic ballot. But they'd be pretty thin claims IMO.
In the Senate, not much either. R's were always favored, and the D position became worse in late Sept./early Oct. (maybe because of Kavanaugh) and hasn't really rebounded. Over the past week, races moving in different directions and roughly cancelling out. https://t.co/EFMPjkkIqq https://t.co/BTKTKpd6n8
You'd really have to stretch to claim there's much momentum either way in the House. Our forecast shows an uncertain but pretty flat race, with D's remaining favored. https://t.co/nMWlUPlerX https://t.co/PmUr8Lun0G
@DavMicRot @yghitza The sample sizes are tiny in those buckets, which is why the blue line, which smooths out area with sparse data, shows very strong calibration. You're smart enough to know that -- I hope?

@DavMicRot @yghitza I don't really get what your deal is re: me and 538, but it's just kind of... deranged... to look at that data and call it poorly-calibrated. That's what good calibration looks like! I'd literally show that graphic in a pitch deck to show how well-calibrated our forecasts are.
@DavMicRot @yghitza That looks like extremely good calibration to me! The blue line is pretty darn close to the perfect calibration line, or about as close as you're realistically going to get given this sample size.
These traditional polls are generally very high-quality data, although note that they're not able to detect truly last-minute movement—a poll released today will have been in the field late last week.
These polls are probably the last thing that could really influence our *overall* forecast, if there's evidence of a shift in the generic ballot. Recently, those polls have been clustering in the D+6 to D+10 range, and that's right where ABC has it (D+8) among likely voters.
Over the final 48 hours here, we should see most of the big traditional news organizations issue their final pre-midterm surveys; here's the one from my colleagues at @ABC (done in conjunction with the Washington Post, as usual). https://t.co/OELxkK9LJo
I'm not at all convinced there's movement nationally toward Democrats—the generic ballot has been very flat. But, they may be closing well in swing districts because of their big spending advantage, which ought to be a bit scary for R's.
This last set of Upshot/Siena polls has been pretty good for D's. They're polling in 11 districts now, and on average, the polls are coming in about 2-3 points better for Dems than the 538 Classic forecast from before the poll was entered.
* Although, I'd argue that 95% is different from the others. 95% is 1 chance in 20 of an upset. The others average out to about 80% which is one chance in 5. That's a meaningful difference.
Dem chances to gain 23+ seats in the various quant House models:		@ORACLE_of_Blair — 76%	@FiveThirtyEight — Lite / Classic / Deluxe — 78% / 85% / 82%	Economist/@gelliottmorris — 86%	Optimus/@DecisionDeskHQ — 95%		So for better or worse, these things are in pretty good consensus.*
@PatrickRuffini I do think the CW is a little low on Democrats' ceiling in the House relative to what the models say and would treat like a 47 seat D gain as shocking when that's not the most likely outcome by any means but still in a reasonably thick part of the distribution.
@PatrickRuffini I mean, out of the 6 election cycles that I've covered, I think this one has featured the *least* disagreement between the models and the conventional wisdom.
@PatrickRuffini I think the meidan muckety-muck thinks that Ds are favored in the House but also (wrongly, per the 538 model) thinks the polls say the GOP has drawn the race closer and that some of the talk about a blue wave and Beto O'Rourke and this and that has gotten a bit carried away.
@PatrickRuffini I'm not sure if the muckety-mucks necessarily expect either side to beat its polls, so much as that they might not really know what the polls say, especially in the House.
I WANT TO KNOW WHETHER CRUZ HAS A 5.2-POINT LEAD OR A 5.1-POINT LEAD AND I WANT TO KNOW **NOW** https://t.co/Yns9cxJK9x
I do think it's interesting that @UpshotNYT showed such widely varied scenarios under different assumptions about turnout. Despite the polls being in relatively good consensus with one another, easy enough to see Cruz winning by 11 or Beto by winning by 1. https://t.co/sY1lL5djN2
In case you can't tell whether I'm joking when I say we need more Texas polls, I'm not sure whether I'm joking either.
@willwilkinson A lot of it is just that most pundits are incapable of thinking more than 4 years back or 4 years ahead. They're chastised by their failure to predict Trump's win—a close and somewhat quirky win that didn't involve winning the popular vote—so they're overcompensating now.
Looks like a bit of tightening in the Beto-Cruz race? Hopefully we'll get another poll or two or forty or fifty in TX-Sen to sort it out.
But to bring this back: When people look at 538 and ask "what if the polls are wrong?", that's *the question our model is trying to answer*. The polls say Ds will win the House. Our model says, based on how accurate polls have been in the past, there's a 15-20% chance they won't.
—If there's a systematic polling error in the GOP's favor, those Likely R districts won't be a big problem	—If polls are about right overall, they'll produce headaches that could offset GOP wins in tossups	—If there's polling error AGAINST the GOP, they'd yield major D seat gains
If you're a skeptic on the importance of the "Likely R" districts, scroll through our list of the 105 (!) most competitive races. I think you'll get pretty far down the list before you reach districts that the GOP can really feel great about based on polling and other indicators. https://t.co/XQNw9yGcA9
Per our Deluxe forecast, the GOP has to go 24-10 in the 34 most competitive districts. That's really hard to do *unless* polling errors are correlated. There's also a LONG list of "Likely R" (but not "Safe R") districts where Democrats are competitive and could cause problems.
Trying to thread a needle here:	1—Small-to-medium sized polling errors happen a lot	2—The errors are often correlated, affecting many districts at once	SO	3—The GOP has a shot at the House	BUT	4—The House polls are really quite poor for the GOP, maybe more than people realize
Republicans need a polling error to win the House. Fortunately for them, polling errors happen all the time. That's why they have a ~15-20% chance. https://t.co/Et1rimF3hz
RT @NickRiccardi: Tipton 46 Busch 41. Closer than the other poll which showed Tipton way up https://t.co/Bx1R5r7LfF
All the districts above ME-2 are easier pickups for Dems than ME-2: places they "should" win if they're on track for a House majority. Everything below ME-2 is bonus districts that would let Dems them add to their majority or substitute for misses elsewhere.
A little bonus for election night owls. As of right now, the tipping-point district in our Deluxe model is ME-2 (one of my favorite districts), where Jared Golden (D) seems to have a very slight lead over Bruce Poliquin (R). https://t.co/6MliPwLGSG
p.s. Don't mean to imply that any outcome on Tuesday would constitute a repudiation of Trump. But there's a highly plausible world in which, e.g. Ds win the House popular vote by 6-7%, 21 (but not 23!) House seats and a lot of gov races. Be careful with your 🔥 takes on that one.
But if you're a pundit and you want to be at all literate and numerate about evaluating the intrinsic popularity of Trumpism, that's maybe not the best metric. You'd want to look at, well, the **popular vote**. You'd also want to factor e.g. governorships into account.
Anyway, a lot of hot takes are going to be written based on whether Democrats wind up with 22- or 23+ House seats next week. And if you're trying to forecast the horse race—as I'm trying to do—that's the most interesting thing to keep track of.
Indeed, a good argument about Trumpism as an electoral strategy is that it's decidedly below-average, but not so below-average as one would have thought, especially given that the House, Senate and Electoral College all reward a party that overperforms among working-class whites.
The reason I say "pretty impressive" is because opposition parties usually do well at the midterms. Democrats are on track for an above-average but not spectacular performance (again, if polls are about right).
Because of how voters are distributed (and in the House, gerrymandered) and which Senate seats are up this year, that probably won't be enough for Ds to get it done in the Senate, and the House is far from a sure thing. But that would be a fairly impressive showing.
If polls are right, Democrats project to win the popular vote by 8-9 points on Tuesday. That's a lot; bigger than the GOP margins in 1994 and 2010. https://t.co/dkWlyfpsGc
It's pretty amazing how *little* overall movement there's been in the polls for the past 2-3 weeks. Yes, movement in individual races, but no clear direction in the aggregate.

@PatrickRuffini If people expect Democrats to beat expectations, it's more likely that Republicans will beat expectations, and vice versa.
A lot of folks seem to like the Lite (basically polls-only) version of our House forecast, which is totally fine to use. Just keep in mind it has a *very* wide range. The 80% confidence interval runs from +15 D seats all the way to +60. https://t.co/aX9lkjY0RA https://t.co/ipzRzZIi5v

Florida: A bit of tightening, but there's been a LOT of polling there and it's wrong to call it a Toss-up. Gillum is about a 3:1 favorite. His numbers are now only a point or so better than Nelson's when there had been a bigger gap before. https://t.co/OUasMZL8x8
Wisconsin: Polls there have tightened a bit, but the model was expecting them to tighten, so the overall forecast is roughly unchanged. Walker (R) very alive but it's on the fringe between Toss-up and Leans D. https://t.co/rkmXmvuB4U
Iowa: There hadn't been many polls there, and our model was relying on old polls and fundamentals to show Hubbell (D) well ahead. New polls show a much tighter race there against Reynolds (R).
Couple of governor updates: Ohio is still a toss-up, but polls there now show Cordray (D) with a very slight lead instead of a very slight deficit. https://t.co/gmgYP6Ji0y
@jbview @SeanTrende Yeah—I think there are a lot of reasons why the range is broad, but I *don't* think one of those reasons is that the conditions on the ground mismatch the fundamentals. I think this is about what you'd expect given a president at ~42% job approval.
Granted, 57 is pretty unlikely. But there's a 20-30% chance of 45+ in the different versions of our model. Certainly not the modal outcome, but should be very "thinkable", just as R's keeping the House should be thinkable.
If I had to point to an area where the conventional wisdom is wrongest this year, it's in underestimating how wide the range of outcomes is in the House. Maybe 30-40 D pickups is the most likely range, but it doesn't take much to send us to 19 (R's keep House), or, say, 57.
So what if a candidate with a supposedly 1% chance wins. Can you say the forecast was "wrong"? 		That's complicated. But the answer is basically: YES if it's first forecast the she's has ever issued—but NO if her probabilities are well-calibrated over a large sample of forecasts.
Probabilistic election forecasting isn't new anymore. 538 has issued literally thousands of forecasts. Historically, our numbers are honest/well-calibrated. We're issuing 506 forecasts this year! (435 House + 35 Senate + 36 Gov). Dozens of those will be wrong.
It's not complicated: you look at a **reasonably large sample** of elections to see if forecasts were well-calibrated.		e.g. do 80% favorites win about 80 in 100 times, not much less than that but not *more* than that either. 		You can't tell much from just one forecast. https://t.co/XTMhtclXRO
@POLITICO_Steve With that said, it's a basically-impossible state to poll and it's pretty elastic/swingy. And Galvin has raised a lot of money. So not a crazy result. I just assume the margin of error on an Alaska poll is 2x as high as a typical state.
@POLITICO_Steve There were a couple of polls in 2016 that showed Hillary Clinton competitive in Alaska too...

Extremely pedantic v footnote: 101m is the number of ballots the model forecasts will be counted for the House. Overall turnout would be a few million higher because some people vote for Senate or Governor but undervote (skip) the House.
Our Congressional model makes a fairly simple forecast of national turnout based on the number of voters who say they're more enthusiastic about voting than usual. That forecast is now pointing toward 101m votes cast for the House, up from 78m in 2014. Still could be too low.

RT @micahcohen: One reason Trump's immigration gambit may help the GOP in the Senate but hurt it in the House:		https://t.co/PhLICVy6Aq htt…
p.s. There's no particular evidence to show the GOP is closing especially well or that the immigration strategy is working. Maybe a tiny bit of evidence for the opposite. (Trump approval is down a tick.) Still, there's uncertainty, with GOP having a ~20% chance to keep the House.
If Republicans have a good night on Tuesday and think they won the midterm on the basis of immigration/xenophobia/race-baiting, just imagine how much Trump is going to turn the dial up in 2020.
@Nate_Cohn I think we're talking about very, very subtle differences in framing and emphasis, re: the relative importance of the toss-ups vs. the lean/likely R races. I've been a huge fan of the project and think it's been one of the best things that's happened in a long time.
@Nate_Cohn The foundation of races that are/were thought of as Lean R &amp; Likely R has been pretty wobbly, based on a variety of metrics. (Including how the parties are behaving.) Our model thinks that makes life a lot harder for the GOP. Haven't seen that wobbliness in Lean D/Likely D races.
@Nate_Cohn That's fair enough. And all these various models and forecasts are influencing one another in ways that aren't necessarily ideal. But that's why I worry a bit about painting slightly too neat a picture.
@Nate_Cohn Anyway, not a huge deal, but IMO the big debate right now is how much Republicans have to worry about the long list of Lean R and Likely R races. I think your data has suggested they *do* have reason to worry and that some of the Lean Rs are really tossups.
@Nate_Cohn One issue with looking at things this way is that the race categories move in response to your polls. If you look at how Cook rated the races as of the *start* of your project, your average poll in a "Lean R" race has shown the GOP up by like ~4.7, which is a bit thin for Lean R.
But sometimes I think people have this conception where uncertainty drops from "pretty high" to "very low" in the final 72 hours. Most of the time, it doesn't. You improve from "pretty high" to "somewhat high" but usually not much more than that.
I don't want to be too dogmatic about this. Lots of races (including almost all House races) aren't well-polled. We can still learn more about those. And if there's big, late-breaking news (arguably true this year?—but there's always news), we'll want to see the reaction to that.
Part of this is because polls tend to herd (cluster together as a way of covering their asses) at the end, especially in well-polled races. In some circumstances, I think you learn more from the next-to-last poll than the very last one.
Something I believe that will probably annoy most other election geeks: We don't get that much smarter in the period from say ~72 hours before the election until about 7:30pm on Election Night, when returns start to come in. The search for late movement is a bit overrated.
@SeanTrende To play out the thought, I think very very VERY high turnout might hurt Democrats relative to the polls in the MIdwest, where the polls seem to be baking in a D enthusiasm gap. But would probably help them in the South &amp; West, where they rely on more irregular voters.
@SeanTrende I guess I think my main takeaway is that early voting makes me mildly more confident in the polls, since both the polls and early vote numbers show very high turnout. Although, part of me wonders what happens if we get very very VERY high turnout, which seems possible.
@SeanTrende I'd say the early voting numbers *are* consistent with a surge among energized liberal voters. In most states, D turnout is way up. The reason the numbers aren't that informative is because R turnout is way up also.
RT @micahcohen: Under-appreciated point: If polls were perfect, we wouldn't even need a model/forecast!!! 		https://t.co/Sfe4wPsAA4 https:/…
IMO, problem 2 is underrated relative to 1. It's not like everything is going great for Ds in the Senate, but they can't find the 51st seat. Seats 45-50 remain in doubt too, because many races are close. That's why Ds need a systematic polling error—to sweep all the tossups.
Basically Democrats have *2* big problems in the Senate:	1) "No clear path"—winning all the tossups isn't enough. They also have to win 1 of TN/TX/ND/MS.	2) Even if they win one of the above states, they could easily blow by losing *any* of MO/AZ/NV/FL/IN/MT/WV/NJ/MN. https://t.co/ixhq9VOrGR
It also tells you why polls are a superior form of analysis—they tell you who someone actually voted for. Early vote numbers don't. With data like this you could have, e.g. a 10-point GOP lead in the party registration of early voters, but the D candidate is ahead by 2 points.
Haven't vetted this in detail. But if true—if Dems are disproportionately winning independent early voters and also keeping a larger fraction of their own votes, as Upshot polling seems to show—a lot of the hot takes about early voting won't hold up well. https://t.co/1itDhM9cVH
p.s. Swap "Democrats" for "Republicans" and "House" for "Senate" and that pretty much works too.

I wouldn't completely discount the GOP view, especially in MO where McCaskill is acting like she's behind. And there's been *some* good public polling in these states but not a *lot*. But it makes me a bit more skeptical.
To be less oblique: GOP consultant types are more optimistic than you'd gather from public polling in a few Senate races, most notably MO, MT &amp; IN. There was a real dearth of high-quality public polling in all 3 states. But now we've gotten some and it doesn't match the GOP view.
There's a fine line between races in which the (1) conventional wisdom incorporates unpublished internal polling in races with little or no high- quality public polling and (2) where it incorporates the fact that one party is more vociferous in its wishful thinking.
You wake up on Nov. 7 and, against fairly heavy odds, Democrats won the Senate by winning ONE of the 3 races below, in addition to all the toss-ups. Which race was it?
@ForecasterEnten @Nate_Cohn It's 👏B👏E👏T👏O👏
Again, the problem for Democrats is not that they can't find some cheery Senate polls here and there, but that they have to win almost everything—4 of the 5 states listed here, for instance, if everything else goes to form.

@POLITICO_Steve @baseballot The only question is whether everything outside of Philly metro is in the Midwest, or whether the MIdwest starts near State College.
@jeffhauser Yeah, in general the party on the wrong side of the wave "skews" the polls more. Publicly-released Democratic polling was quite far off in 2010, for instance.
Also interesting that Republicans are not releasing a lot of internal polls or even really doing much spinning in the House.		Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but it seems like the Senate has become both a political and cultural bulwark for the GOP in a way the House isn't.
In the House, there are lots of D internal polls and pollsters that straddle the boundary between D and nonpartisan, so you have to watch out. But they're not as far removed from the nonpartisan polls (maybe ~2 points off) as the R internals are in the Senate (often ~5 points).
In the gold-standard universe, D chances to win the Senate are still slimly alive, and they're about as likely to win seats as to gain them.		In the robo/rando/GOP universe, Republicans will hold the Senate, and the question is whether Ds can limit their losses to 0-2 seats.
In general the trajectory of Senate races has been negative for Dems. But also, as I mentioned yesterday, we're seeing *big* spreads between the so-called "gold standard" (nonpartisan, live-caller) Senate polls and the online/robos/GOP internals that make up the rest of the data. https://t.co/f5jFXMNZ9H
p.s. Don't assume Ds are going to win a lot of these "wow, I can't believe a poll shows THAT district close" districts.		The modal scenario is that they LOSE most of them.		But they'll probably win a couple, and if this set of races are close, Ds will do very well in the tossups.
Redistricting also a big factor here.
Pennsylvania polls have been just awful for Republicans. If Democrats have a good night next week, PA would really be the epicenter in some ways—a bit ironically given the preponderance of Trump-voters-in-Pennsylvania-diners-still-love-Trump stories. https://t.co/gY13nEuTl0
@mattyglesias There's both longshot bias and pro-GOP bias, relative to the polls/models. So, like, they have Beto's chances about right because the longshot bias and the pro-GOP bias cancel one another out. But they've been much too high on DeSantis.

@Nate_Cohn Are you seeing any shift in Trump approval?
There aren't a fixed number of votes, and if there were (say we knew Ds would win the popular vote by exactly 8 points) the dangerous pattern for Ds (where they'd waste votes) would be if they overperformed in BLUE districts. D overperformance in red districts is bad news for Rs.
On the contrary, if they're competitive in the big-reach districts, they're going to win a lot of the mild reaches and many/most of the tossups, winning the House with some room to spare
There's a school of thought that Democrats are going to compete in a lot of "reach" districts in the House (say IA-4 and PA-11) and wind up losing a lot of them by 2-6 points. Indeed, there's a good chance that will happen, but it's not a bad sign for Dems.
@ForecasterEnten yes when I ask people a question not when I just make a comment
Went through the first ~100 replies and here were the ones that got mentioned the most:	First, the three on my original list:	OH-4, CA-1, NY-2	Then, CA-4 (Tom McClintock) and FL-25) (Mario Diaz-Balart)	Plus people want more IA-4 (Steve King) polling, of course.
Some defense here and there but overall this is a pretty ambitious list.	7 Likely R districts	6 Lean R	11 Toss-up	3 Lean D	7 Likely D	(classifications per 538 "Deluxe" forecast) https://t.co/Ng1V3kiXHD
Democrats' problem in the Senate is that they don't have a good path.		Republicans' problem in the House is that they have some good paths, but there are many, many paths when there are 100 competitive races, and a fairly large majority of them end up with a Democratic House.

@LPDonovan I buy McCaskill's in trouble, just based on how everyone's acting. tbh sort of "rooting" for a CNN poll showing her down 3 or something just so the data is easier to reconcile. I halfway buy it on IN. Not sure about some of the other races. Our NV forecast seems too pro-Heller.
Our model is trying to adjust for this the best it can, via our house effects adjustment. But in a couple of races—MO and IN, in particular—it's a pretty big adjustment (maybe too big?). Much less of a problem in the House, where there's a higher-quality mix of polls.
Then a Marist or a CNN or even a Fox News will drop into the race—a gold-standard, live caller poll—and show a fairly different picture. You saw that a bit with Marist giving Sinema a lead in Arizona today, for instance.
A problem in several of these Senate races, Missouri probably being the best example, is that the mix of polls is very Republican-leaning. Either GOP internals, or quasi-GOP independent pollsters who have big Republican house effects in other races they've polled.
@gelliottmorris @micahcohen That roughly lines up with my categories, except I think the conventional wisdom underestimates how easy it would be to win 40+ if the polling error works in their favor.

Semi-related: I'm seeing other smart people conclude there's a late break in polls against Trump/toward Democrats. I'm not so sure yet—our models have been pretty steady *so far*. We'll obviously get a bunch of national polls over the final week here, so we'll learn more.

Also, while it's worth thinking about a pollster's business model, the pollster here (Change Research) has a straightforward one: they commission some of their own polling as a loss leader to gain notoriety and pick up paying clients (in this case, mostly D clients). Very common.
By comparison, Waters is in a district with a partisan lean of D+57. It's twice as Democratic as Alabama is Republican.		p.s. don't start tweeting hot takes about congressional district polls unless you (1) know what you're talking about or (2) want to demonstrate that you don't.
Another relevant comparison: King's district has a 538 partisan lean index of R +23, which is exactly the same as Chris Collins's district (R +23). And a bit less than the state of Alabama (R +27). Ds can compete against very bad candidates in districts like that in a blue year.
Except that previous polling had shown King up "only" 6-10 points, before the most recent round of controversies kicked in and before the Democrat had a chance to take advantage of his 3:1 fundraising advantage. He's probably a favorite but the poll is entirely plausible. https://t.co/jwbRX7WOdo
These are actually super helpful as these are a bunch of districts that the models (well, 538's anyway) think might be competitive based on fundraising and other "fundamentals". Big miss for our model CO-3, but several hits with close polling in IN-9, WI-6, IA-4 (Steve King).
They're getting into some really obscure B-side districts later on in this thread, it's like the Pitchfork of polling pretty much.

In the midterms, we'll see…but the GOP is in bad shape in the House, with various less-bad but also some very-bad outcomes possible. It's in bad shape in part because, although GOP base enthusiasm *is* high, Democratic enthusiasm equals/exceeds it.
Trump's approval rating is current 42-43% (per 538). That's not *awful*, but it's *bad*. It comes despite an economy that voters feel very good about. It seems to go higher when Trump is relatively removed from the scene (e.g. during Kavanaugh), not when he's Trump Being Trump.
I think there's still too much of a tendency to chalk whatever Trump does (media-bashing, the caravan) does to being cynical but smart, base-rallying politics—when it's not obvious that it's "working", at least not in an electoral sense.

Not sure people realize how broad the House playing field is.		In our final forecast in 2014, the Deluxe version of our House model would have considered 44 seats to be competitive.		In 2016, it would have had 39 competitive seats.		This year, it shows *99* competitive races.

@jbarro @TylerDinucci It does, yeah. So you could probably argue that our Senate model (which used a fairly aggressive setting for the generic ballot) was too aggressive in 2016. These changes would not have affected the presidential model, though....
@jbarro @TylerDinucci It's not a design change per se, but that the House is basically 435 separate races, whereas POTUS is one race. We get a ton of data about that one race so the model can be quite aggressive. In the House, not much data, and race-by-race changes often cancel each other out.

Of course, the lean/likely zone is broad. A 89% chance is a lot different than, say, 63%. But for a long time, the press tended to treat elections as either nearly certain (~99%) or totally uncertain (50/50). So if we can get people to recognize the lean/likely zone, we're happy.
To put it another way, I doubt we'll exit the lean/likely zone in either chamber. We call elections "toss-ups" when no party has a &gt;60% winning, and "solid" when one party has &gt;=95% chance. Anything in between is in the lean/likely zone.
We'll go into 11/6 with the GOP as likely but by no means certain to win the Senate &amp; also with a plausible tail scenario where things real get bad for Ds.		...and with Dems as likely but by no means certain to win the House, with a tail scenario where things real get bad for Rs.
Maybe I'm wrong, but between there not having been that much polling over the past few days and the polling we've seen having pretty much gone to form, it seems unlikely that polling in the final week is going to radically change the outlook.

The online pollsters produce plenty of generic ballot/Trump approval data. But a lot of them don't foray much into the states, and when they do it's the high-population states with well-balanced demographics (which are way easier to poll). I think they're a little chicken tbh.🐔
In theory, this gap was going to be filled by online polls. But online pollsters have not been very aggressive this year after they had very mixed results (some were pretty good, some were quite bad) in 2016.
The decline in the number of traditional telephone polls is a somewhat inevitable consequence of declining response rates. The harder it is to reach people = the more expensive it is to poll. So you'll get fewer *polls* out of the same polling *budget*.
Yeah. Although, a couple of counterpoints:	—The amount of House district polling is pretty normal/healthy.	—It matters that many of the key Senate races are taking place in smaller states that aren't traditional presidential battlegrounds. Those states always get less polling. https://t.co/9eQfvl7rod

Turnout is a big X factor in New York with the gubernatorial and Senate races not being at all competitive. I think that would make me nervous if I were the GOP, since Cuomo should be strong statewide, although NY traditionally has lot of ticket-splitting.
New York state has a LOT of districts we rate as either Lean/Likely Republican  (NY-23, NY-27, NY-11, NY-24, NY-21, NY-2, NY-1) or Toss-up (NY-19, NY-22). In fact, no district in NY is *totally* safe for the GOP.  But also no slam-dunk Democratic pickups.
In other troubled-GOP-incumbents news, our model had been skeptical about Democratic prospects against Chris Collins in NY-27 despite his insider-trading scandal. But it's now polling as a ~2- or 3-point race and is quite competitive. https://t.co/kWeOW1lEtn https://t.co/glJ7ElZ7IA
You can tell October/November is peak tourist season in New York based on its also being peak nobody-knows-how-to-walk on-the-fricking-sidewalk season.
Worth keeping in eye on, in other words. Personally, I hope we get more polling in districts that are on the fringe between "lean R" and "likely R". I think they tell us more about the overall state of play than the tossups, which are important but which we know a lot more about.
Steve King's IA-4 race vs. Democrat J.D. Scholten had only been on the fringe of competitive; Scholten's own poll in Sept. had him down 6. But, Scholten has out-raised King 3:1 &amp; polls of other races in this part of the country have been bad for the GOP. https://t.co/1r4iVB1V57
Our model's hypothesis is basically that the influx of D cash makes a lot of races that might ordinarily be "Lean R" behave more like Toss-ups, and a lot of races that might ordinarily be "Likely R" races behave more like "Lean R" ones. Seems like that's playing out a bit. https://t.co/iF9KCul1wz

As I hope y'all know, polls are sometimes wrong, and they wouldn't need to be off by too much for the GOP to keep the House. But I do think we're at the point where if that happens, it would be correct to say the polling was "wrong" (as opposed to having been ambiguous).
It takes a lot of work to decode district polling in the House. To have a good sense for what it means, you have to look up the partisan lean of the districts, etc. So not sure folks fully appreciate how the district polls are really quite bad for the GOP. https://t.co/MGiEeAGofp

@yashar There's no reason to speculate in the sense that we'll have a much clearer idea soon. But people can make some inferences based on his list of targets and few details we know so far. Like other inferences they won't always be right, but quite a bit better than a 50:50 guess.
@TheStalwart PS: The prices at PredictIt, especially if you look at individual races, imply bettors are assuming there's a systematic D bias in polls. You can't defend the pricing there if you assume (as e.g. the 538 model does) that polls are equally likely to be biased in either direction.
@TheStalwart I think the "conventional wisdom" among journalists, etc. underestimates the D tail possibility. But at PredictIt itself, the prices on the tail outcomes aren't that far off (maybe a little). It's more the prices in the middle of the range that are hard to justify IMO.

"Democrats haven't been anti-Trump ENOUGH" would be a reasonably good 🔥🔥🔥 take. https://t.co/Hm3QtJLFlX
If you look *really* carefully at our forecasts, it's not the ceilings that have changed so much as the floors. The D floor for seat gains has gotten higher in the House— although fortunately for Republicans it's still below 23 seats. The R floor has gotten higher in the Senate.
When you're overexposed, things just have a tendency to get worse. You think you've put out one brushfire over here and there's a new one over there. It becomes impossible to manage the situation in a piecemeal way and you're left praying for a miracle/major change in conditions.
The big, fundamental difference between the House and the Senate is that D's bear a disproportionate amount of the *exposure* in the Senate since they currently control the large majority of competitive seats. Conversely, Republicans have almost all the exposure in the House. https://t.co/hQWCF53wof
In the Senate, by contrast, things *have* gotten worse for the Democrats, which is the subject of our Election Update this morning: https://t.co/TzNS1cd5n5
But *uncertainty* is not the same thing as *movement* and there hasn't been a lot of *movement* in the House. In fact, the House forecast is probably the steadiest we've ever made at 538. It just hasn't changed much (unlike the Senate, any wobbles around Kavanaugh were minor). https://t.co/6XMWsoKf5c
To be generous to this view, maybe it's an OK way of reminding people about *uncertainty*. How deeply a potential wave could penetrate into districts that voted by Trump for a lot, but where the D is showing signs of being competitive, is a big source of debate/uncertainty.
Yeah, been hearing this a *lot*, the idea that the House outlook has shifted back toward the GOP (even if D's are still favored) and/or that Dems' ceiling has become lower. To be blunt, I just don't think it accurately reflects the balance of the publicly-available evidence. https://t.co/49HAKWiC7D
Most of the recent Upshot/Siena polls are coming really, really close to where the 538 model had the respective races. Maybe a sign of races moving more into line with "fundamentals" in each district. https://t.co/fpvCpuptFh
I'm particularly curious about California, where the polling can be pretty screwy. Little known fact, but California polls were off by as much or more than Wisconsin polls in 2016, just in the opposite direction (they underestimated Clinton). https://t.co/Yrkb3tfE0f
If you want to go to the second decimal place, the polls shifted toward Republicans .... by an average of 0.02 percentage points.
Here's one sign there's not much movement in the race for the House. I looked up all congressional district polls released in the last 2 weeks in which the same pollster had polled the same race previously (n = 39). On average, the swing in those polls was… literally 0.0 points.
@kjhealy Data analysis is editing. Well, sorta.
The same is true for Democrats and the Senate, btw.
In other words, we've likely passed the point where the GOP can just get "lucky" in the right districts. They need polls to be off across the board *or* at least in certain key types of districts. Fortunately for the GOP, correlated polling errors happen *all the time*, e.g. 2016
The Lite (f/k/a "polls-only") version of our model gives the GOP about a 25 percent chance to hold the House. Which is…not good but also not bad? But essentially all of that comes from the possibility of a correlated polling error, i.e. where polls are off systematically.

But we do think Deluxe is going to be the most accurate version, especially in lightly-polled districts. The main difference right now is not in the toss-up race, but that experts/Deluxe show fewer districts "in play" &amp; therefore a lower (though still high) ceiling for Dems.
*Which reasons? 	1. We want the default option you see at 538 to be a purely data-driven view.	2a. Feels like cheating to incorporate your (friendly) competitors' forecast into your own.	2b. Things get a bit weird if the competitors are also integrating *our* ratings into theirs.
As 11/6 approaches, I find myself looking at the "Deluxe" version of our forecast more, which incorporates expert (Cook/Sabato/Gonzales) race ratings. For a few reasons*, we don't tend to emphasize Deluxe, but it will probably be the most accurate version. https://t.co/auwMtE7pvc

Another underrated fact is how well Democratic incumbents are doing in *states* that shifted from Obama to Trump. The Midwestern D senators in OH, WI, PA and MI are all poised to win re-election, probably easily. That suggests a mean-reverting election more than a realigning one.
p.s. As my friend @ForecasterEnten points out, in special elections this year and last year, **2012** results were more predictive than 2016 ones. The same is true in polls of Congressional races this year.

Michigan's another obvious one. Not that I'm hugely craving more experimentation there, given how it's been a hard state to poll in the past. But House races are a *lot* more interesting in MI than Senate or Gov, and several of those races are under-polled. Maybe Minnesota too.
It's actually some of the high-population states that are under-polled in the House. In particular, California, Illinois and New York. Senate &amp; Gov races are quite boring there, but they each have several interesting House districts. Maybe Texas belongs here too.
PSA: Maybe too late for this, but if you're a pollster in a state where there's not a Senate or Governor race where the candidates are within ~10 points, please consider polling a couple of House races in your state instead.
@MonaChalabi A big problem is that other journalists don't always get how probability works either.
I sometimes wish we could paywall part of 538 but the paywall was you had to demonstrate some knowledge of how probability works. 		"4 in 5 doesn't mean 100%" is a *very* important point of emphasis for irregular readers that the regulars maybe don't need to hear as much.
I don't think my employer will let me bet money on this but happy to wager bottles of wine, or a charitable donation, or anything else like that.
You "win" each bet if the polling average is off by at least 2 points *in the direction you specify* and "lose" otherwise. The rationale for the prediction must be the early vote, not some other reason you expect the polls to be off.
Okay, let's try this then. By Nov. 1, give me 11 Senate or Gov races where you think the 538 polling average will be off by at least 2 points, based on your analysis of the early vote. https://t.co/M9vMKh3o9x

@PatrickRuffini I actually worry a bit more about some of the Senate races, especially e.g. IN/MT/ND, where the average poll *quality* is lower and we're sometimes left with a mix of weird/unknown/bad pollsters.
@PatrickRuffini But, again, life is a lot easier because Upshot/Siena puts out sensible results that match other metrics pretty well. The pollsters that are hard to deal with are not necessarily the ones with house effects, but the ones that produce *weird* results.
@PatrickRuffini I think we've designed things with this sort of issue in mind; it's not *that* different than when PPP and Rasmussen used to be super-spammy back in the day, except that Upshot is a much better pollster than those 2.

Our model *isn't* necessarily more bullish on Democratic chances than the consensus in these districts—it is in some, but more bearish in others. But they seem to provide validation of the idea that good D fundraising totals can point you toward "unexpectedly" competitive races.

Great thread. I'd also add:		6. In many states, there's a "tradition" in which one party turns out more strongly in early voting.

Either poll a battleground state/district or 3, or poll the whole country.		Polls of "battleground districts" just wind up confusing people.		Defining the battleground is tricky and can be a bit tautological—battleground districts are ~ places you'd expect close polls.
To simplify a LOT:	1. The old view was that midterm elections were mostly about mean-reversion and balancing power. 	2. The new view is that they're a referendum in the president.	3. Although 2 may be increasingly true, it's probably become a bit overrated and 1 a bit underrated.
I also think this factor is underrated. Voters indifferent between Trump and Clinton in went hugely for the GOP in 2016, hoping to provide a check on a President Clinton. But instead, they got President Trump. History suggests they may now swing Democratic to improve balance. https://t.co/iAeuDibLhT

We're using internal polls in our Senate model for the first time this year. I think we have a good way of adjusting them; our program is pretty smart at telling which campaign pollsters are relatively honest and which will grossly exaggerate their candidate's standing.

So why is the GOP clear favorites to hold the Senate despite that? Because the average competitive Senate race (weighted by 538's tipping-point index) is being held in a state that's **16 points more Republican** than the country overall.
Democrats have a generic ballot lead of 8.5 or 9 points.		Not sure if people realize how large that is. A bit larger than the 1994 and 2010 waves, when the GOP won the popular vote by ~7 points each time. Similar to 2006, when Dems won by 8 but underperformed in swing districts.
@SethBurn I think 2:1 on a D House in betting markets is a very attractive price. Even if I were allowed to bet, though, I probably wouldn't because in practice I bear a lot of reputational risk (i.e. impact on long-term earnings) staked on that outcome.
@SethBurn My employers, past and present, don't have the same view on the ethics of betting on politics that I do.
@SethBurn I don't think it would be OK ethically with my employers to bet on politics, but that's about the same price as PredictIt so not sure why I'd bother?
@SethBurn The deluxe version of our model, which is the one we'd use to set betting lines, shows a ~20% chance of a D Senate and a ~20% chance of an R House. There's almost no chance (well, ~1%) these occur concurrently. So we're saying a ~60% chance of a split, ~40% one party wins both.
@SethBurn The evidence on that is mixed. In the *short term*, efforts to restrict voting can make voters more conscientious about their status, which can counteract the intended effect. In the long term, maybe quite different—20% of the black population is disenfranchised in Florida.
@SethBurn I think 2:1 is pretty hard to justify in the House if you're using a model that accounts in a robust way for district data. All the models I'm aware of that do that are higher: Economist (71%), 538 lite/classic/deluxe (77%/85%/82%), YouGov (90%), Optimus (93%).
If polls underestimate Republicans by 2-3 points—which is a very normal-sized polling error—the House is a district-by-district nail-biter.		If polls underestimate Dems by 2-3 points, their path to victory in the Senate is much more viable; toss-ups go their way, TN/TX close etc.
This is a unique election in which there will be big practical consequences if polls are off by even a relatively modest amount in *either* direction. Although a House-Senate split is the most likely outcome, there's still a 35-40% chance that one party wins both chambers.
@RalstonReports Ha-ha let's grab lunch the next time we're in the same town together. Much respect.

@ForecasterEnten Our forecast has never been espeically excited about GOP prospects in MT. But there's been so little polling there that who the hell knows.
@ForecasterEnten For me the issue is not that it's so crazy to think Dems could win one of TN/TX/ND/MS -- even without a systematic polling error -- but that they also have to win MO/NV/AZ/FL.
@ForecasterEnten The question is how much of a systematic polling error you'd need to make things interesting.
@ForecasterEnten If Dems are winning 50 House seats they might also stumble into a Senate win though, in which case there could be "come-up-ins".
Gillum is now up 5 in our FL-GOV forecast, although we're still waiting to add GOP poll that we haven't been able to get details on. (hint, hint, @RonDeSantisFL): https://t.co/gmgYP6Ji0y
Although, let me qualify 3) slightly. If you know the pollster and it has a good track record, you can sometimes rule out poor methodology. Even so, the way to determine that is from a pollster's overall body of work, not from the cross-tabs. https://t.co/jGFc1EzaUY
3) Don't go into the cross-tabs to "debunk" the poll. It's usually hard to determine whether the difference vs. other polls is a result of sampling error, an actual change in the race, or poor methodology. The large majority of attempts to do so are sophomoric.
I like a lot of things about Axios. But my issue with them is that their house style tends to smoosh categories 1-4 together. When they relay something, it's often unclear whether it's a source's opinion, the reporter's opinion, or a hard fact derived from exhaustive reporting.
There's nothing wrong with that. But it makes transparency even *more* important. You need to differentiate between:	1—a reported fact you regard as incontrovertible	2—a conclusion you've drawn from deep analysis or reporting	3—a spitball/tentative assumption	4—a source's opinion
It would be one thing if Axios had an extremely pious, Associated Press/BBC just-the-facts style of reporting. Instead, their reporting has a lot of **inflection**. There's lots of analysis. There's lots of "here's what to think". That's their whole brand. https://t.co/1WfXIHSDt0
@ForecasterEnten Can't really agree with this. I'd say it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rare. But calling it very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very rare is a step too far IMO.
I guess I'm just on a roll posting mildly snarky tweets about POTUS approval today, but this isn't too surprising. POTUS approval tends to decline when the president is above 50% and improve when he's below 40%. A fairly classic example of mean reversion. https://t.co/X9QDJU8Kow
@SeanTrende Also historically, you can predict the House popular vote pretty well just by taking whatever the House popular vote was in the prior presidential year and subtracting a net of 7-8 points from the president's party. POTUS approval adds some value but less than you might expect.
@SeanTrende Ehhhh. We may be in a new regime now where everything is super duper correlated. But historically the president's party tends to do worse on the generic ballot at midterms than in POTUS approval, because voters on the fence about POTUS tend to elect the other party to balance.
@conorsen I think we'd need to see ~2 more polls showing him up by that amount. He's always been ahead by *some* margin in almost every poll, though.
If a pollster publishes a poll that looks like an outlier, the right move is to:	1) Be happy that the pollster was willing to publish it. It means they're doing honest work.	2) Put it in the average. Don't ignore it, but also don't assume it's the new normal.
@SopanDeb This basically boils down to Be Smart™: Assume your readers are dumb.
House polls are noisy, but the Upshot/Siena numbers were pretty bad for the GOP this week after having been a bit more equivocal in early October. Even in the Senate, there were some brighter numbers for Dems in a few races (e.g. IN) this week, but probably too little/too late.
Apart from that, people are trying to force a GOP comeback narrative when that's really not what the data shows—or at least not what a non-cherrypicked cross-section of the data shows. Generic ballot polls have been bad for the GOP lately. 3Q fundraising numbers were awful.
A few weeks ago, the GOP improved from being modest favorites to fairly clear favorites to hold the Senate. That's a *big* deal and would be a nice accomplishment in what looks more likely than not to be a rather blue year otherwise (e.g. in House and Gov races).
For instance, if GOP voters turned out at a rate that was really high for a midterm, but Democrats turned out at a rate that was on the *low* end for a *presidential year*, you'd have a massive, massive Democratic wave.
Also, the theory that like Dem enthusiasm was already capped out pre-Kavanaugh doesn't make sense. Only 40-45% of the eligible voters typically vote in the midterms. That's quite low! You can never have enough enthusiasm. You're never really near the point of diminishing returns.
Very little is clear about the Kavanaugh effect. Trump's approval has gotten better but the generic ballot hasn't for the GOP, and has maybe gotten worse for them among likely voters. https://t.co/f8qb0LGI5Z
@daveweigel Yeah, that's plausible. And the likely-voter electorate was pretty red in 2010. With that said, there are likely to be some "balancers" in the electorate; voters who feel agnostic about Trump might tend to vote Democratic for Congress as a check on GOP power.
(Also, Democrats lost 63 seats with Obama at those numbers, so "Trump's approval ratings are now only slightly worse than Obama's" shouldn't be a hugely comforting thought to the GOP.)
Not if you look at the polling average. Trump is at 43/52 in our average; Obama was at 47/47 at this point four years ago. Looking at a likely voter version of approval might close some of that gap, although probably not all of it. https://t.co/22tJnKg5kn
@daveweigel Yeah, I think a lot of things would have unfolded differently if they'd done that.
With that said, there's a case here that the GOP can't just blame Trump for its problems in the House. Health care is the No. 1 issue, and that's not really a Trump thing. Kavanaugh—although it's still not 100% clear how that's resonating—not really a Trump-centric issue either.
There's little doubt that Trump bears some responsibility for the very high levels of Democratic enthusiasm. Even in the NBC/WSJ poll, which had Trump at a relatively good overall number, 43% percent of voters *strongly* disapproved of him vs. 30% who strongly approved. https://t.co/iEMX6y7TMg
Trump approval (which has been getting better for the GOP) and the generic ballot (which has been getting worse) have now converged. We have Trump approval at -9.6 in all polls or -8.0 in polls of LV/RV only. GOP is down 8.4 on the generic ballot. https://t.co/QEUrSBIUT7
So, this is another poll where Democrats are doing better among likely voters than registered voters. We were seeing a fair amount of that in polls this summer, but less in September, when R enthusiasm had seemed to improve. Now more pollsters are showing a D turnout edge again. https://t.co/Aso3xtPPqq
Republicans definitely have a chance to hold the House. But the data does not show that their position has improved; it's probably gotten a pinch worse. https://t.co/y2pcec33jo https://t.co/mnGlDG0RrJ
It's also a really tough district to poll, so while what looks like a 7-point lead could turn into a 2-point loss, it could also wind up being a 15-point win.
The GOP is outperforming the fundamentals here, but the district has historically been more purple in Congressional elections than in presidential ones. And the GOP has a real good opponent in Salazar. But Shalala has a good favorability rating and has raised plenty of money.
I agree with @williamjordann that the anti-Shalala takes are a bit much. Or at least, they should be held until/unless she actually loses (definitely still possible). We show her winning by 7, which is right where the Upshot poll has the race. https://t.co/UtQYRWYsq8 https://t.co/vtOO6jRwXL

PSA to campaigns: We've started to have a lot of D and R campaigns directly send us their internal polls for inclusion in our polling database and forecasts, which we appreciate. The best address to do that is POLLALERT-at-FIVETHIRTYEIGHT-dot-com
Anyway, I feel like "the blue wave is concentrated in wealthy suburbs" has gone from a useful heuristic to having become a bit overrated. There's a fair bit of truth in that idea. But it can understate how noisy/messy the data is and how idiosyncratic races for Congress can be.
A lot of these districts are pretty Trumpy. But they're also pretty elastic/swingy, historically. They tend to have lots of independents and not necessarily a lot of loyalty to the Republican brand. Wouldn't mind seeing a poll of MI-1 (the Upper Peninsula), for instance.
I'm interested in rural, northerly, secular districts like ME-2. They're another place, outside of the suburbs, where Dems seem to performing above expectations, although with some exceptions (e.g. MN-8). https://t.co/SDmrTWg8rV
She cites Hogan as an example of a famous upset. But Hogan trailed by only 5 in the final 5 polls and led in one of them (albeit his own poll). Upsets can and do happen in Senate &amp; Gov races when someone trails by 5-9 points. Not usually when they trail by 16. https://t.co/95QC6rSlZ0
One of the more blatant examples of misdirection + cherry-picking I've seen here when citing polls. She makes it sound like James trails by only 9 in the RCP average. He does not—he trails by 9 in *one poll* (from a pollster with a D- rating). He trails by 16 in the RCP average. https://t.co/JSzTJ9DZlA
I don't think this is what she means, but O'Rourke is much more likely to win than James, although both are long-shots at this point. https://t.co/8VJI0CVFMh
Alaska governor race much more competitive after Walker drops out. Begich now only a 2:1 underdog or so. https://t.co/3keI2KdHLM
@mitchellichtman Yeah. Basically, our model uses fundraising, partisanship and other fundamentals as priors, but weights them less and less as it gets more polling. A lot of House districts don't have much polling, though, and some of them have none at all.
The risk may not be symmetric either. Personally, I think the D seat distribution may be more right-skewed than what our model shows. e.g., maybe the model is right that Ds win 35-40 on average, but the median should be lower (30-35?), and the tail where they win 55+ fatter.
Overall, the fundraising numbers create a lot of upside *and* downside risk for both parties, relative to what models that use them say. https://t.co/yzJ2Ak7BHd
I empathize with the case for sort of ignoring the fundraising numbers—the case basically being, they're so good for Ds/bad for Rs that they seem outlier-ish and we don't know what to do with them. But I don't think that case is prudent or wise. You can't just ignore outliers.
This leads to an unprecedented 2:1 D fundraising edge in swing districts. Usually even when a party had an overall fundraising edge, it doesn't translate so lopsidedly in swing districts. This time it does, even though a lot of the swing districts are red and have GOP incumbents. https://t.co/sR8clxogDg
One point that I think people miss: the Dems' fundraising numbers are pretty good but not **that** good. It's that Dems' fundraising numbers are pretty good *and* the GOP ones are bad. Moreover, GOP fundraising is shallow. Far fewer of their candidates will hit the $1m mark. https://t.co/IoKc3vgUFp
So, had a column up this morning about a hot topic in election forecasting: How to think about Democrats' massive fundraising advantage in races for Congress. https://t.co/R0LplACbMU
@Redistrict Fair. And we don't adjust prior margin for challenger strength (other than for type of race, e.g. open-seat vs incumbent). In general, though, prior victory margin is about as predictive as PVI in districts with incumbents. It explains a lot of places where we differ from you.
@Redistrict So it's a little bit of everything. But prior victory margin is probably the most important. If you won by only the mid-teens last time and now you're in a much bluer environment against an opponent who's out-raised you 2:1, that should be a little scary.
@Redistrict So those are pretty similar cases, actually.	—Incumbent won by underwhelming margin in 2016.	—Challenger has badly outraised incumbent.	—Challenger is experienced (elected before).	—Incumbent has very conservative voting record (even relative to other GOPers).
@Redistrict But those likely R seats are where the fundraising gap could get a few sleepy Republicans in trouble, who are facing much more viable opponents than they're used to.
@Redistrict I trust you guys on individual districts. TBH, the only real difference between your 30-35ish and our 35-40ish is that we have a much larger batch of likely R seats (as opposed to solid R) and expect a few extra D pickups from those (we're just not sure which ones).
@jbview @Redistrict But something's always weird in the data. In 2006, Dems had a massive lead on the generic ballot but were doing very mediocrely in district polls. Averaging those together got you to roughly the right forecast.
@jbview @Redistrict Yeah, I think loosely speaking, the right answer is to "average in" fundraising with the other indicators but to expand the confidence interval.
@Redistrict I think where we differ is that I see fundraising mostly as a proxy for other things, e.g. "intangibles" like candidate quality and voter enthusiasm.
@Redistrict It doesn't swing our overall forecast 8 points—it swung the fundamentals component by 8 points. I actually think that's a case where the model was pretty smart. It was having trouble gauging the effects of the scandal and with the Q3 $ it now it matches the polls in NY-27 better.
I'm not super aboard the "fundraising numbers mean hidden Dem mega-tsunami!!!" train. (I'm not sure anyone is on that train.) But I have seen people shrug off the fundraising data because they're having trouble explaining it and I think shrugging off isn't what you want to do.
@joshtpm I'm using small-donor fundraising as a phrase to mean individual contributions up to the $2,700 limit; maybe that's a little imprecise.
The House model is calibrated off 1998-2016 so it's all pretty recent. If you only use the *most* recent data though the correlations are essentially the same. In 2010, fundraising was a bit less predictive than usual but 2012/14/16 were all pretty good. https://t.co/VPvDUBbYhN
Small-donor fundraising for Congress has been growing for years, presumably because raising money digitally is so much easier than the old ways of doing it. But D and R fundraising was moving in tandem and the R's just dropped off a cliff this year while Dems kept growing. https://t.co/ioKiblw3Gs
@jbarro @Redistrict @FiveThirtyEight I don't think the scenario above is *likely* exactly, but I think it's roughly *as* likely as the scenario where small-donor fundraising, historically a pretty reliable indicator, suddenly has a built in D bias because of ActBlue, digital, etc. when it didn't in 2014/16.
@jbarro @Redistrict @FiveThirtyEight It's also arguably the *hardest* evidence we have about voter engagement, unless you want to look at special elections, which have also been really good for Democrats. There's a scenario here where pollsters are hedging a lot based on 2010/14 and lowballing the D turnout edge.
@jbarro @Redistrict @FiveThirtyEight Yeah, I think it's more of an indicator of (i) voter engagement/enthusiasm and (ii) candidate organization/quality than the money necessarily being important unto itself. Although, the money isn't *unimportant* unto itself.
@Redistrict I think it's about equally likely that the model is reading too much into the Dems' fundraising advantage, and that the model is reading too little into it.
p.s. As we near Election Day, I'd encourage you to look at all 3 versions of our model. Classic is our default and, we think, the best way to narrate the race. But Lite gives you a polls-only view. And Deluxe, which incorporates expert ratings, is what I'd use to bet my own $.
p.s. "Things aren't getting better for the GOP in the House" doesn't mean they can't win. I'd consider any election where your chances are &gt;=5% to be "competitive". And the GOP's chances are a lot higher than that, between 15-25% depending on which version of our model you use.
In terms of the House big picture, we're not far removed from the conventional wisdom, so I won't pick a big fight. But as a quibble, the CW feels stale by 7-10 days. You could squint and see some movement toward the GOP then. Harder to make that case based on most recent data.
e.g. We've had VA-5 as a tossup all the way through. Quirky district, fairly Republican lately, but our model shows it as swingy/elastic and the GOP candidate is problematic and has been outraised 3:1. That adds up to a coin-flippy race and that's what the NYT/Siena poll shows.
Pretty good House polls for Democrats over the last day or two, also. Although, I'd say good relative to the conventional wisdom more than relative to our model's expectations.

A lot of things are like this with election data. Combing through poll cross-tabs, for instance. The upside, if do it very carefully, is that you get a LITTLE smarter. But the downside is that you wind up fooling yourself and getting a LOT dumber.
It's true that, in theory, you could glean some useful info from early voting if you proceeded carefully. But I've been through enough elections to know that people don't proceed carefully and instead wind up connecting the dots in a way that confirms their priors.

Conditional on the GOP gaining 3 or more Senate seats, there's still a &gt;40% chance that Dems take the House, per our model. I wonder how it would be interpreted if, say, Dems won 32 House seats and a bunch of governorships, but lost 3 Senate seats. Not such an unlikely scenario.
Speaking of by-no-means-that-unlikely probabilities: There's about a 1 in 5 chance that the GOP *gains* 3 or more Senate seats. https://t.co/EM1K5gFMRq
Just realizing how much clearer my memories are of odd-numbered (non-election year) than even-numbered baseball postseasons.
Anyway, that's what my column was about this morning. Those lean/likely R seats matter a lot. We don't know which ones Dems will win and (unless there's a mega-tsunami) they'll lose most. But they're a big liability for the GOP. https://t.co/fHoRm664QE
Per our model, it is *not* true that Democrats will only win these seats in a landslide. House races are noisy and weird and not as correlated as presidential races. There's almost a 40% chance that the decisive, tipping-point district will come from a Lean/Likely/Solid R seat. https://t.co/U2RKB7r74c
About one-third of Dems' projected gains, in fact, come from the "long tail" of seats rated as Lean R, Likely R or Solid R. Without the Dems' having the possibility to win those seats, the House would be more or less a toss-up right now.
This is probably my (and my model's) biggest disagreement with other election forecasters right now. Per our model, the large number (70!) of lean/likely GOP seats—places where Dems have between a 5% and 40% chance of winning—is a huge reason why they're favored to win the House. https://t.co/y5FMxP508o

In 2016, people underestimated the extend to which results in different presidential states were correlated with one another. I think people may be *overrating* the degree of correlation in House races, which are somewhat correlated but a lot more individualized than POTUS races.
There's certainly an element of truth in the idea Democrats are consolidating support in blue districts while Repuicans are doing so in red districts. But there's also a fair amount of data that doesn't fit the pattern, e.g. in WV-3 and NY-27.

@IChotiner Tangible on several levels:	1) Money can be exchanged for goods and services, e.g., ads;	2) It's a good proxy for how well-organized a campaign is;	3) It's a good proxy for voter enthusiasm.
@IChotiner I think you're overestimating the precision of House forecasts. Not a lot of polling. Candidate quality is a murky variable (although not hopelessly so). Fundraising is something tangible when we're relying on a lot of inferences otherwise.
And maybe we're near the point where we've crossed the threshold between (i) and (ii) toward Democrats in the House. Their generic ballot polls have been very good lately. Their fundraising numbers have been very good. Upshot/Siena polls pretty good for Dems tonight.
I kinda think we've crossed the threshold between (i) and (ii) on the Senate side in the past week or two. If the GOP failed to win the Senate, it might not be that *surprising* but it would mean the consensus of the evidence was "wrong". (This view is subject to revision.)
I know it's a bit fuzzy, but I feel like there's a philosophical divide between (i) "the data isn't clear about what will happen, although it largely points in one direction" and (ii) "the data says X will happen, although it could be wrong".
@williamjordann There's always concern about a lot of things.
These numbers have generally been very positive for Democrats. Some places where our forecast has shifted a bit as a result of good D fundraising: NY-2, NY-27, ME-2, MN-1, NY-23.

...and we're less optimistic about the Mavericks (28 v 36), Spurs (37 v 42.5), Celtics (54 v 59.5), Pacers (43 v 48), Knicks (23 v 27.5) and Clippers (33 v 37.5). Note: a lot of teams with good coaching/management there, which our system is probably prone toward underrating.
On average, our projections are very close to Vegas team totals and differ by only ~3 wins. But here's where there are the biggest differences:		We're more optimistic about the Jazz (55 wins vs. 50), Hawks (28 v 23), Thunder (53 v 48.5) and Nets (36 v 32). https://t.co/tbTEO3fQSm

@ForecasterEnten Thank you for this insight.
@PatrickRuffini Well, you listed a lot of really good pollsters there, who are probably among the least likely to do it. But I think a lot of pollsters herd some of the time, and some pollsters herd a lot of the time.
@NickRiccardi I think this is one of these times when (1) there's some real movement related to (a) Kavanaugh and (b) the end of the election drawing near, which (2) is having differential effects in different states and districts, but *also* (3) there are issues with non-response bias.
This trend is clearer now. Generic ballot polls conducted since Kavanaugh was confirmed have not been good for Republicans. All a bit weird because they had a good week of Senate polls and an OK-ish week of House district polls. https://t.co/VWALt1YriO
In other words, this is probably what *real* polling data looks like especially with n=500 samples. If their results seem weird, it's probably because other pollsters would cheat by not publishing the weird results (or by conjuring up ad-hoc adjustments to make them less weird).
One of the big benefits to NYT Upshot doing polling in real time is that, because everything is so transparent and you can see the interviews and weighting taking place in real time, they can't really manipulate or suppress "outliers" that don't match the consensus.
@MattGlassman312 @julia_azari There are definitely some additional costs, mostly related to security. (https://t.co/OuUz4uWZZV)  But I assume it's mostly because local airport authorities are making the decisions about vendors rather than it being more consumer-driven?
@julia_azari I'm just saying that Guaranteed Mediocrity is a pretty big win in the airport. Also places that know how to turn over tables quickly.
@julia_azari I'm saying more Gordon Biersches, fewer one-off "brewpubs" that could never survive on their own outside the airport.
Airports are the perfect environment for fast food/fast casual chains. Not a place to take risks. Just give me a few options from whichever chains are popular locally and I'll be happy. Instead at e.g. LGA or LAX you get these weird one-off quasi-chains that are very uneven. https://t.co/anoFRKOIg1
OTOH, given how much is spent on polling in presidential years, there's *no* excuse to have gaps in coverage for the 10-15 most important presidential swing states. And national polls don't have much utility once you have comprehensive coverage of important states.
There are ~100 competitive House races. It would be awesome to several polls a month out of each one but that's never going to happen. So generic ballot polls and other methods of extrapolation are a necessary evil.
From an election forecasting standpoint, I think this is mostly true for Congressional elections—I'd trade some generic ballot polls for polls of key states/districts—but *more* true for presidential elections. Way too many national polls &amp; not enough state ones in 2016. https://t.co/tIHpteHzVT

Hard to take these early polls seriously after they predicted that Hillary Clinton (!) and Donald Trump (!!) would be the party nominees in 2016. https://t.co/YFiZE9W8uB
Also, House battlegrounds are fairly red—but not extremely so. A district that's &lt;10 points more GOP than the country will usually be competitive when the generic ballot favors Dems by ~8 points. By contrast, *most* of the Senate action is in places Trump won by double digits. https://t.co/2OTBWEfYSH
In some ways, House and Senate battlegrounds are opposites.

@neeratanden @jmartNYT @GregoryBTrotte1 @CharlesPPierce @BetoORourke @geoffgarin @DemGovs Roughly speaking, the lesson was that polls have their better nights and their worse nights, but that it's a lot better to look at the polling average and size it up for yourself than to pay any attention to the spin/conventional wisdom about the polls, which is usually dumb.
@neeratanden @jmartNYT @GregoryBTrotte1 @CharlesPPierce @BetoORourke @geoffgarin @DemGovs This isn't that complicated. The polls showed Northam narrowly ahead. But for some reason, the conventional wisdom was that, despite the polls showing Northam narrowly ahead, the race was a tossup. Instead, Northam won in a blowout.
I don't have any especially pithy conclusion here. But it's one of those weeks when it's nice to have a model/algorithm to sort anything out. And that model shows the likelihood of a split decision in Nov. (D House, R Senate) continuing to increase.
Has been a weird week of polling. Democrats have shown a rebound on the generic ballot. But their Senate polling has been quite poor. Meanwhile, House district polls have been all over the place. https://t.co/UlBWZ8IXyC

@ClareMalone That little college by the Charles River?
Now, Senate *control* is not the only objective. There's also the goal of winning as many *seats* as possible in the Senate. Plus, the House. You can make a case Dems should *concede* Senate control to focus on those other objectives. But the Beto takes are kind of sophomoric.
There's a comparison to 2016 when Trump was derided for campaigning in WI/MI because he was down 5-6 points there in Oct. But he was also down ~6 points nationally, pre-Comey letter. So WI/MI were right near the tipping point &amp; he was (obviously) correct to campaign there.
Also, TX is still the most important race for determining Senate control, per our tipping point index. Granted, not to the point where Dems should be donating 60 zillion $$ to his campaign. But the majority is a *tough* proposition for D's and they need to win some *tough* races. https://t.co/YtHwIfGC9x
The Beto coverage is kinda dumb. In our polling average, he's gone from a deficit of 3-4 points at his peak to 5-6 now. That's not great; TX has gone from "Lean R" to "Likely R". But the coverage was wrongly treating it as a toss-up before &amp; is wrongly treating it as Safe R now.
@B_M_Finnigan @baseballot He's Other Nathaniel.
Especially the part about combing through crosstabs to decide if a poll is "right" or "wrong". I can imagine *rare* occasions when it's worthwhile to do that, but the large majority of the time, people are just spinning their wheels and/or engaging in confirmation bias.
This is more shade than Other Nate usually gives but I agree with this whole thread. https://t.co/RScdMRWkS6
e.g. in ND-SEN, only two firms have polled the race since Labor Day. They both have really bad numbers for Heitkamp. But it's not a lot of polling, and earlier polls had shown a more competitive race. That's why our model classifies it as "lean R" rather than likely or safe R.
Technical comment, but people aren't paying enough attention to the *volume* of polling in a particular state or district. Having 1 or 2 bad polls is a lot different than having several of them, especially if (as is often the case with House polls) the sample sizes are small.

@ForecasterEnten My favorite self-own is when people reveal they're shocked that something with a 30 percent chance of happening happened.
@NickRiccardi Mostly agree but I'd argue that the House has gradually evolved from a toss-up into lean or (depending on the week) perhaps likely Democratic. Also, the breadth of the playing field (because of weak or retiring incumbents) was not necessarily obvious in advance.
PSA: If you're a candidate and want an internal poll to be published at 538, you NEED to include the following info:	—Who conducted the poll?	—Sample size	—Population (e.g. likely voters)	—Field dates	—And please make sure there's a way to get in touch with you with questions.
@ForecasterEnten Just glad you're recognizing that Pennsylvania is a Midwestern state.
A bit of caution is in order since polls overrated Democrats' performance in the Midwest in 2016. But their polling leads are large enough that they could underperform by several points and still win most of the key races.
By far the Democrats' strongest region in Senate + Gov + House polling has been the Midwest, and I don't think you'd really gather that from the tonality of the reporting, which tends to fixate on demographic change and therefore finds races in the South &amp; the West a lot sexier.

So if there are news events that cause people to become more anti-incumbent (which, yes, is a *real thing*) that will tend to help Republicans in the Senate but hurt them in the House.

@davidshor It's better because it reminds people when they're doing modeling/coding that vote shares are bound between 0% and 100% but it's bad for every other reason.

@HolmesJosh Midterm turnout is **low**. Yeah, it'll be higher this year. But still probably less than half of the voting-eligible population. Even among subgroups with high voting propensity, you're not near the point of rapidly-diminishing marginal returns.
@HolmesJosh But "lit" is not a binary. Let's say in an ordinary year, 45% of eligible Democratic identifiers would vote in the midterms. (It's probably somewhere in that vicinity.) This year (pre-Kavanaugh), enthusiasm was super high so it was 55%. Why can't it grow further to, say, 60%?
Trump won orange noncollege muppets 65-31 in Pennsylvania. So pretty good odds he's a Trump voter. https://t.co/VJOwbW9uCX
@HolmesJosh I dunno, I think a lot of elections have been lost on the premise that voter preferences among certain groups are fixed or maxed out or static when they aren't. Going from doing fairly bad among non-college white voters to *really* bad was key to Hillary's loss, for instance.
These aren't mutually exclusive. Kavanaugh has [1] effects on the R base [2] effects on the D base and [3] effects on swing voters.

Overall, though, it's definitely a good time to rely on averages rather than building narratives from individual polls. I think there *is* enough evidence to say Dems' position has worsened in the Senate, which may or may not be Kavanaugh-related. Otherwise, it's *very* unclear.
In tumultuous news cycles, there are potentially more issues related to response bias (i.e. certain types of voters become more likely to respond to polls). That's a tricky thing to combat, so pollster methodology can be make more of a difference than in calmer news cycles.

It's not that Haley is likely to be a big issue for swing voters. It's just that the short-run is *really* short in politics these days. So when analyzing the impact of e.g. Kavanaugh on the elections, one wants to consider the long-term impact more than short-term mood swings.

On the other hand, maybe fundraising has changed. D voters now donate more across state lines. Maybe R voters don't think they need to donate in the era of SuperPACs &amp; Trump, who didn't raise much in individual contributions. That could make it a less reliable benchmark. All TBD.
On the one hand, if Democrats have a huge night and beat their polls on Nov. 6 on the basis of a very strong turnout, we can't say there was no indication of that in the data. Fundraising and special election results were hard, tangible evidence of extremely high D enthusiasm.
The fundraising numbers, which are totally bonkers and off-the-charts good for Democrats, are a big source of anxiety for me, modeling-wise. (We use fundraising as part of our "fundamentals" calculation.) https://t.co/e6UhN3RMCX
To put it another way, not sure you can reject the null hypothesis that polls are changing because some of the rough Trump news cycles from the summer (e.g. Manafort/Cohen) are fading from memory, plus partisanship is kicking in, as it typically does toward the end of a campaign.
In general, though, I think people neglect opportunity cost too much when analyzing polls. That is, what *haven't* people been talking about when Kavanaugh has dominated the news cycle? Well, they haven't been talking about Trump, and that might be a boon to the GOP.
We continue to see Kavanaugh get (slightly) less popular in polls, but the horse race numbers get (slightly) better for the GOP. It's a bit confusing, and could reflect a lot of things, including improved GOP enthusiasm. https://t.co/HgOCJiURBJ

The football-spiking after Kavanaugh was confirmed this weekend was one such example. There's always *some* of that after a big policy/electoral win, but there's also usually a fair amount of magnanimity and reaching out to the losing side. Not so this time.
…it's striking the degree to which the GOP governs as though it's only interested in 47% of the country… instead of shooting for 51%, in which case these structural advantages could allow it to have supermajorities in Congress.
Lotta talk today about how the GOP can expect to win a majority of the Senate, House and Electoral College with a minority of the vote. I think people overlook how transient those advantages can be (the Electoal College helped Obama in 12/16) but leaving that aside for a moment…

@charlescwcooke @ForecasterEnten I think Avenatti verrrrrrrrry much wants Democrats to win the House, because if they don't it will (perhaps incorrectly) be blamed on the Kavanaugh confirmation process and he will (correctly, IMO) get a lot of blame for how those played out.
We have the D's generic ballot/popular vote lead trending toward +7.5 or so. So while the topline numbers in our House forecast haven't changed much, we've crossed an important conceptual threshold where the eke-it-one-district-at-a-time scenario is back on the table for the GOP.
With a generic ballot lead of D+7 or so, it's very possible for polls to about right overall, but for Dems to lose the House because the GOP ekes out wins in lots of the tossup districts. Once you get up to D+9 or so, the dam breaks and GOP would need a systematic polling error.
This is pretty interesting https://t.co/vJ2Pf7kyq0
And the Senate is the one Democrats need to be worried about. As I mentioned above, which party benefits from the Electoral College tends to flip around a lot from cycle to cycle. And any advantages in the House mostly reflect who wins elections in redistricting years.
But of the various structural changes people are proposing, DC/PR statehood is (i) pretty easy to defend on the merits (ii) relatively easy to do and (iii) goes a fairly long way toward addressing racial &amp; partisan imbalance in the Senate.
But people should be mindful that relatively subtle shifts in demographic coalitions can change which party benefits a lot. Obama's vote share was highly correlated with Clinton's, and yet he *over-performed* in the Electoral College while she uhhh didn't. https://t.co/MInoOSZA1m
Currently, the *average* Senate seat is about 6 points more Republican than the country overall (because smaller-population states happen to be more Republican right now). Adding DC and PR as states would reduce that advantage to about 2 points instead. https://t.co/kkP6zSFK50
These are not meant as rhetorical questions. I think they're pretty interesting ones. But they're the *fundamental* questions to be asking. The alternative to Kavanaugh is not no Kavanaugh—it's Barrett or Kethledge or Thapar or someone.
A secondary Q is: Did the manner in which they went about getting Kavanaugh confirmed—call it cutthroat or whatever—help them politically, e.g. in terms of the midterm elections?
Most of these takes aren't asking the right questions. It was always extremely likely that Republicans, who have a majority of the Senate and the presidency, would get a Supreme Court justice confirmed. So the Q is: Are they better off with Kavanaugh than the alternatives? https://t.co/OBXn3Dxwad
@adamdavidson Not trying to attribute genius. In fact, I'm not sure if it was smart at all to confirm him when they could have picked another conservative instead. Part of what was interesting was that Republicans were trying to convince *themselves* that he was the right hill to die on...
@baseballot Try putting "thence" in one of your stories next week and we'll see if the copy desk agrees.
@AlexParkerDC @EsotericCD Maybe good in a nonpartisan sense, sure. But worse for Dems politically than the status quo. GOP would still capture most of the political upside of the Kavanaugh pick (i.e. stoking grievances among the base) but with little of the downside risk from actually confirming him.
@EsotericCD Agree that Kavanaugh would successfully have been filibustered. Then Trump would nominate e.g. Barrett and McConnell would have gone nuclear when Dems tried to block her too. Probably a considerably better political outcome for the GOP and they still get a conservative justice.

One thing you might say about the conservative strategy re: Kavanaugh is that it kept Dems off-balance. Included quite a mix of fastballs (partisan rallying), curveballs (deceptions/lies about sensitive areas of the case), changeups (emotional appeals) and screwballs (Ed Whelan).
We also don't know much about the political implications yet, including in the short run (next month's midterms) as well as the long run. The GOP did a lot of things that "worked" to help him get confirmed but which may prove to be politically costly. https://t.co/LJBdcgFZ7f

I interpreted her speech as going out of its way to try to ingratiate herself to Republicans, in an effort to fend off a GOP primary challenge. She decided she'd rather have an easier primary battle and a more difficult general election one, rather than the other way around.
Collins started with very high popularity so possible that she can lose a good deal of it and still win re-election. She's probably a favorite.		But I don't buy that Kavanaugh will be a "distant memory" by 2020 *especially* given how much attention Collins drew to herself. https://t.co/KpK7tIhJqA

Nonetheless, given that he's fairly unpopular, I think there should be somewhat more caution on the narrative that he'll help the GOP in November. Enthusiasm bursts can be ephemeral and can also make polling more difficult (if enthusiasm surges affect who responds to polls).
As @Nate_Cohn has pointed out, Kavanaugh's numbers are no *worse* than the GOP's deficit on the generic ballot, or Trump's net approval rating—in fact, they all seem to be converging. So he's unpopular on an absolute basis, but not necessarily relative to other midterm issues.
Kavanaugh's numbers among the public have been getting worse, but it's been a fairly slow and steady decline. Unsurprisingly, partisan and gender gaps have widened recently. https://t.co/AZJrtSlxAP https://t.co/Ve2ZfL4ey4

It's pretty crazy that there's all this drama about how senators are going to vote but that the FBI report is not public.
@DanFosterType @DouthatNYT @RichLowry He denied both having blacked out and having passed out.
@DanFosterType @DouthatNYT @RichLowry He said "passed out would be no". Then said "but I've gone to sleep". If y'all are demanding precision, maybe we should take his answers literally? https://t.co/x01XnrRPPP
@RichLowry He had instances where he initially denied an allegation, then tried to deflect or muddy the waters (or in a couple of cases, to turn the question back around on the Senator asking it). But he did not go back and correct/clarify the record. I'm not sure how to score those.
@RichLowry Right but he didn't just claim not to have blacked out. He also claimed under Senate questioning not to have had memory lapses, not to have passed out, and not really to have become aggressive when drinking.
@RichLowry I haven't tried to wade into the debate about whether, say, he told any lies about having advanced knowledge about the New Yorker story. I'm sure that some people have made some exaggerated and/or fallacious claims about those. I've been trying to keep my scope pretty narrow.
@RichLowry I've focused on drinking-related statements because they're highly implausible based on overall population tendencies (especially re: not having had memory lapses). There's also some witness testimony about how he behaved when drinking in HS/college, but YMMV with that.
@RichLowry This is despite having made repeated references to apparent memory losses in other public and private remarks over the years.
@RichLowry In Senate testimony, he denied having blacked out, he denied having memory lapses while drinking, he denied having passed out, and he said "basically no" when asked if he'd ever gotten aggressive while drinking. https://t.co/8x9xARV8Gm
@RichLowry Sure, I agree. The whole point though is that he made many probably untrue claims, especially re: his drinking, which are the ones I've been focused on.
By the same token, Manchin, who has a pretty solid lead in polls, has incentives to be risk-averse, which probably means a "yes" vote.
Voting *against* him and doubling down on her image of honesty/authenticity is a high-variance strategy and will probably not work. But the alternative is quite possibly worse, and you want to take high-variance strategies when you're down in the polls.
The Heitkamp takes I'm seeing are wrong. She was fairly critical of Kavanaugh throughout the process, so voting *for* him now would look like an exceptionally craven and poll-driven move, especially given that she's had some bad polling lately.
The methodology is pretty new/different/unproven, though. OTOH, California polling has been fairly poor—it underestimated Clinton's margin by 7 points in 2016, a bigger miss than Wisconsin—so maybe worth experimenting.
https://t.co/kFgbGz3Whx
What's interesting is that California's a place where Democrats have mostly been underperforming the "fundamentals" in the polls, whereas the LAT/UC Berkeley polls are right in line with the fundamentals. https://t.co/RkDxhX1LoD
@DouthatNYT IIRC you and McArdle and I got into a mini-argument about just the blacking out part after the Fox News interview. I think it's pretty unlikely he's never blacked out but I certainly wouldn't say 99.99%. But he made much more sweeping claims about his drinking in the hearing.
@philipaklein @PeteKDCNews I guess there's not much utility in predicting things at this point but seems obvious that's where this is headed, no?
@DouthatNYT To put it another way, it would take an amazing set of coincidences and misunderstandings and physiological characteristics that defy base rates for him not to have lied.
@DouthatNYT But that's precisely NOT the claim I'm making. My claim is that there's a *statistical* near-certainty that he told at least one lie, because so many of his claims range from reasonably (never having blacked out) to exceptionally ("devil's triangle" is drinking game") unlikely.
@DouthatNYT The more fundamental critique, though, is that you're answering a different claim than I'm making. You seem to be answering "Did Kavanaugh tell any PROVEN lies?". A lot of his claims are not provable either way. We could argue back and forth about "proof" for some of the others.
@DouthatNYT But then in response to the very *next* question, he confirms his original answer.
@DouthatNYT He answered "no" when Klobuachar asked if he ever couldn't remember *part* of what happened the night before. (Then he started asking her about her own experiences with blackouts.) That's denial of memory lapses and not just blackouts. https://t.co/fj8XwoHF4g
@DouthatNYT There's a *lot* to critique here but you should also be aware that it just MItchell who asked about memory lapses. So did Klobuchar, and he made a more sweeping denial in response to her question.
I don't think "maxing out" makes a ton of sense in midterms when overall turnout is typically only around 40%. Sure, it's higher among certain groups (e.g. college-educated women). But there are lots of people sitting on the sidelines. https://t.co/8W2NWE6GL0
I'm tired of litigating this point, but if you say 7 or 8 things that are very likely but not quite certain to be lies, it's essentially certain that at least one of them is a lie. https://t.co/XKictDcBG1

@Redistrict See the next tweet!
Beyond ND and the generic, there isn't a ton there. House polls have been rocky for the GOP, with some but not many exceptions. So this is not hugely robust. But I'm inclined to trust our model, which shows GOP better-positioned in the Senate but is more ambivalent on the House.
This one of those cases where the narrative ("GOP enthusiasm surging!") is both exaggerated/cherry-picked but also has a grain of truth behind it. Republicans have gained back 1 point or so on the generic ballot and are also now clear favorites in the key ND senate race.
Here's my "it's complicated!" look at whether the Kavanaugh hearings have been helping the GOP in the polls. https://t.co/4ihxdc5NFY

There's a good chance that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, it will do more to boost Democratic turnout, and that if Kavanaugh is voted down or withdrawn, it will do more to boost Republican turnout.
Kavanaugh almost certainly lied to Congress about his alcohol use, so this is pretty telling. https://t.co/Bj41oqaR1h
Dems' Senate chances have now ticked down to below 1 in 4... pretty much all of that is Heitkamp as the numbers haven't changed much in other races.	https://t.co/unHflWjIbz
One thing that *may* be going on re: Kavanaugh is that the GOP base voters are becoming more enthusiastic, but high-turnout-propensity swing voters (e.g. wealthy suburbanites) are turned off by him. So there are effects working in opposite directions.
The Upshot/Siena polls publish this RV/LV comparison. Fox News, CNN, Marist, Monmouth also do so most of the time. On average, we show the GOP doing about 0.4 points better on LV polls than RV ones, which is obviously a small gap (although it was like 0.0 a few weeks ago).
This is what I was getting at. What we want to know is which voters are most likely to turn out. To be a bit reductionist, what's the difference between likely voters and registered voters, or likely voters and all eligible adults? That's a good measure of the "enthusiasm gap". https://t.co/HrkckTKJbX
Don't want to bury the lede, though, which is that North Dakota looks like a really difficult slog for Heitkamp and that makes the Dems' senate math very hard.
To put it another way, enthusiasm and propensity to vote are not the same thing and propensity to vote is what counts.
What's a bit weird about those Fox News polls is that they talk a lot about the GOP closing the enthusiasm gap... but on average they don't show any difference between likely voter and registered voter results, whereas last month they had the GOP gaining slightly in the LV polls. https://t.co/SIZZUFkAIk

We're a long ways away from knowing what the short-term impact is, let alone the long-term (well, the election's in 5 weeks, so let's say medium-term) one. Some pretty decent polls for the GOP in the last 72 hours but also some pretty awful ones.

@LPDonovan @kkondik A lot of the Lean D races were tossups in July.
@EsotericCD What if your faction is being a contrarian.
@LPDonovan House races are more localized/stochastic than people might assume, though. I should look up the exact number, but I'd guess there's a pretty decent chance that a currently Lean R district turns out to be the tipping point district, for instance.
@LPDonovan We'd project Democrats to pick up 6-7 seats from among the 20 lean R races and and another 6-7 seats from among the 46 (!) likely R races. That's a big part of the landscape. Without the D's being able to dip into that "long tail" of races, the House would be a toss-up.
@LPDonovan I agree with your overall point about how the conventional wisdom not really pricing in what the models say (a 1 in 4 chance of the GOP keeping the majority is fairly high!). But I think it's a mistake to discount the importance of the Lean R and even the Likely R races.
Yeah, people are getting this wrong.		Schumer restoring the 60-vote SCOTUS filibuster would likely be a cynical, tactical ploy to give cover to centrist Democrats in 2019/20 if Dems win the Senate in Nov.

But so far, the past week's polls have looked more like August / early September -- a mix of "really bad", "pretty bad", and "actually not *that* bad" for the GOP -- as opposed to in late September when almost everything was "really bad".
One slight caution here -- there haven't been a lot of high-quality generic ballot polls lately, but we'll probably get several more later this week. So that could cause some bounciness.
Meanwhile, Democrats' House chances have fallen slightly to 3 in 4 from our forecast (from 4 in 5 before). And their Senate chances are down to 2 in 7 (from 3 in 10 before). https://t.co/yAkOpb3IoN

@DouthatNYT If our prior is he's a boy scout, maybe we should judge him by boy-scout standards where small lies are big deal. If our prior is that he's a typical politician, we can be more lenient. But I don't think we should have a boy-scout prior and then judge him by politician standards.
OK. Here's a journalist—Politico editor-in-chief John F. Harris—making pretty much this exact argument. Except, he doesn't acknowledge how big a change it is to have a *Supreme Court nominee* (under oath, no less) lying/spinning like any other politician. https://t.co/maDSTbCQOY
Not sure I *agree* with the argument above but I at least find it intellectually coherent. But this defense should acknowledge that 1) this is a big shift in how we judge SCOTUS nominees and 2) it's unusual to have a SCOTUS nominee who thinks &amp; speaks like a partisan operative.
Maybe just make that argument explicitly? Say something like: "Sure, he spins things to his advantage. And I'll concede that there are a few outright lies, if you want to be super literal. But that's to be expected when the stakes are this high, and Democrats have done it too."
Maybe this is an obvious point, but it seems like Kavanaugh's defenders want to judge his lies/misdirections by the standards of a political or a partisan operative, rather than those of a Supreme Court nominee under oath.
Our forecast has been *very* stubborn in ND, but finally has Cramer as a (slight) favorite there. https://t.co/9CBE3pUx1f
@DouthatNYT So it's not terribly responsive if you address A-F in a piecemeal, one-off basis. You have to give me some sense of the probability that he isn't lying about A-F in conjunction. (Or let's say A-D. I don't think E-F are as interesting, although they should affect our priors.)
@DouthatNYT My specific contention is that the *totality* of A-F makes it almost 100% certain that he's lying about his drinking. Also, the fact that he's obviously lying about the yearbook quotes (G) ought to affect our priors about A-F.
@DouthatNYT g) Several of his other responses to Whitehouse about the yearbook are flagrant and obvious lies, especially re: "devil's triangle" and "boofing", although I guess you could say those are drinking-adjacent lies rather than about drinking per se.
@DouthatNYT e) His claims about the drinking age is MD are an obvious *fudge*, although maybe that fits better into your "lawyerly" category.	f) His response about "Beach Week Ralph Club" is obviously bullshit in the Harry Frankfurt sense; we could debate whether it's a "lie".
@DouthatNYT c) Claiming to Mitchell to have never have passed out is extremely implausible;	d) Making several claims to have never blacked out is highly *unlikely*, especially given his repeated apparent references to drinking-related memory losses in e.g. his yearbook.
@DouthatNYT I wouldn't necessarily rank them in any order but—	a) Claiming to Mitchell to have never had memory loses is extremely implausible;	b) Answering "basically no" to Coons' question about ever become "aggressive" is extremely implausible and contradicted by other evidence	(cont...)
@DouthatNYT Yeah, I think that's wrong—at times he tried to minimize, but at other times he was flagrantly and directly dishonest.
I haven't been covering politics for *that* long, but long enough (11 years) that I feel entitled to play this "card": The position that Kavanaugh was being honest about his drinking is maybe *the* worst hill to die upon that I've ever seen otherwise-smart people try to die upon.
I said the totality of claims he made under oath about his drinking, which include that he didn't black out, pass  out, have memory lapses or become aggressive, 99.99%+ for sure include lies. I stand 100% behind that assessment. https://t.co/SEx7V4Su86
Democratic districts have fewer eligible voters on average because they have more immigrants. #SavedYouAClick #ButPleaseClickAnyway https://t.co/h5ZRfkWUJL
As a general rule, the traditional "gold standard" telephone pollsters (which at this point basically means universities + the big networks) have had better numbers for Dems this cycle than online or automated pollsters. There are some exceptions to this but not that many.
It's not really that much of an outlier ... it's roughly what you'd expect given house effects. For whatever reason, a lot of the polls in Missouri this cycle have been from pollsters with R leans. CNN's polls have been a bit D leaning so far, by contrast. https://t.co/MhNHzQDTea
An important premise here is that the GOP should be trying to optimize a number of political goals (e.g. performance at midterms, chance of ANY conservative justice being confirmed) and *not* just the chance of Kavanaugh being confirmed. Sometimes they seem to lose track of that.
By this same logic, a more thorough FBI investigation is arguably better for McConnell than a flimsier one. https://t.co/DWtr3pJDiC

He wouldn't admit the obvious-seeming truth that "Beach Week Ralph Club" referred to throwing up while drinking. And he fudged/finessed, but maybe not quite outright lied about, about the drinking age. Just read the transcript! https://t.co/VBg9GtcsOY
He made very sweeping denials about his drinking including never having blacked out, passed out, or had memory lapses. He said "basically no" when asked if he'd ever gotten "aggressive" while drinking. All of this is extremely implausible. https://t.co/JLjO8zqgWA https://t.co/jI3WzxcWVO
You probably wouldn't get a Barrett confirmed. But you probably (?) could get e.g. a Hardiman and/or you could cause a lot of internal dissention within the Democratic caucus. It's not as good as getting a staunch conservative. But you still have some optionality.
So let's say there's a 10-15% chance we wind up with a Democratic Senate and no confirmed SCOTUS pick. How bad is that for the GOP? Debatable, actually. The Dem Senate majority would likely be very narrow (e.g. 51-49) and would include a lot of red-state Dems (Manchin, Jones).
There's a ~70% chance the GOP keeps the Senate. I'd tend to think McConnell gets someone confirmed in the lame duck even if they lose the Senate, but it's less of a safe bet then it would have been if Kavanaugh had withdrawn/been voted down a couple weeks ago. https://t.co/yCHMpYv8R1
There's a lot of reluctance among Kavanaugh's defenders to explore the subject of his drinking. (The new argument is that it's "goalpost shifting.") And Kavanaugh was exceptionally evasive about it in his testimony, to the point of repeatedly lying. It's a pretty obvious "tell". https://t.co/i6qFj01pBV

@DavMicRot @KonitzerTobias Also, a smaller point, but district-by-district polls are notably more optimistic for Democrats than the generic ballot at this point. If you're calibrating your forecast based on generic ballot polls alone, you'll wind up underestimating D chances a fair bit in the House.
@DavMicRot @KonitzerTobias There's certainly a lot of variation in turnout assumptions from pollster to pollster and it's hard to know who's right in advance. But that's the whole reason to take a polling average, which is exactly what the 538 models (especially the "Lite" aka "polls-only") version do.
@DavMicRot @KonitzerTobias Basically you're saying that your turnout assumptions are better than the consensus of everyone else's turnout assumptions. Which, maybe? But it's a pretty weird assertion to make for someone who usually advocates for the wisdom of crowds.
Another question is whether confirmation increases turnout more than the alternatives (e.g. Kavanaugh martyrdom + a new conservative nominee like Barrett being chosen?).		Anyway, it's all complicated and semi-unpredictable. But the GOP operative view doesn't seem very rigorous.
…the real question is whether it helps you by increasing GOP turnout more than it costs you by (i) also increasing Democratic turnout and (ii) alienating swing voters, who have lukewarm views toward Kavanaugh. If that's not a part of your analysis, it's not very good analysis.
I've seen this asserted a lot by GOP operatives—that a Kavanaugh confirmation will increase GOP turnout—without it being backed by much evidence. But suppose one concedes it's true. It doesn't demonstrate that confirming him is a good idea, politically… https://t.co/bUZ4zUt4fM https://t.co/P7ZwNfHjsM

Of these themes, No. 3 is the most overlooked. While partisans have very intense feelings on Kavanaugh, quite a few people in the middle don't know what to make of it all. Not my job to give advice but the parties should probably think about what they sound like to swing voters.
4. Partisans on both sides have much stronger feelings than independents, but some evidence that Democrats rather than Republicans are actually the most activated and have the most intense feelings.
1. Overall views on confirmation aren't that much changed, but perhaps a bit worse than Kavanaugh than before (and they weren't too good before)	2. Ford seen as more believable by pluralities of voters.	3. Quite a few undecided voters; people don't have their minds fully made up.

Maybe he's a man wrongly accused—or thinks he's been wrongly accused because he was too drunk to remember the incident (!)—and that explains the indignation. But he's very comfortable with lying (under oath no less). He doesn't even bother coming up with good, believable lies.

@StuPolitics I'm sure they do have their own polls. The point is I think parties overrate the value of their own polls relative to nonpartisan polls, the *other* side's polls, and non-polling indicators like district partisanship.
Maybe they have their own polling, but I think some of the more important lessons of HIllary Clinton's 2016 campaign are not to trust your own polling that much and instead to play a broader rather than a narrower map because the race could turn out differently than you'd think.
I sorta get Coffman but Bishop in MI-8 (my home district!) is a weird one. That race just barely snuck into the "Lean D" category for us but is a toss-up according to everyone else. Narrowly voted for both Trump and Romney. The sort of district you'd think you'd need to defend. https://t.co/rDFUfzbZ6w
Of course, it's possible (maybe this is even the modal outcome?) that the FBI finds some additional damaging evidence but is also a ways short of definitively proving anything. Then we're going around in circles. Plus a lot of other stuff can happen in a week.
I'm halfway inclined to argue this is a win-win for McConnell.		If FBI says no corroboration, a "yes" vote is easier and less costly politically.	If FBI finds corroboration, the evidence probably would have come out in some other way post-confirmation, creating a nightmare. https://t.co/e3f5RUCrtJ
@politicalmath @DouthatNYT @jbarro @KevinWGlass And it's pertinent because Ford said he was exceptionally drunk at the time the alleged assault happened. I think he might lie about his drinking whether he assaulted her, whether he didn't, or whether he doesn't remember either way. But he's obviously lying about his drinking.
@politicalmath @DouthatNYT @jbarro @KevinWGlass He made a whole bunch of assertions about his drinking that went beyond merely claiming to not have passed out or blacked out. He's also made repeated references over the years to having forgotten events. It's pretty obviously bullshit.
@DouthatNYT @jbarro @KevinWGlass Pretty amazing that he's the only heavy drinker in America who's never blacked out, passed out, become belligerent, misremembered a single moment or barfed for any reason other than having a weak stomach despite repeatedly having made "jokes" about several of those behaviors.

1) Unlikely Flake does this unless he has a pretty good sense for how other senators feel too.	2) Post-Flake, it's harder for McConnell to get to yes without an investigation because the refusal to investigate gives Collins, et. al. a good reason to vote no. https://t.co/i4I7OR1yGG
You know what else is going to come out in a week? Polls. Lots of 'em. And if you're Susan Collins or Joe Manchin, it's probably pretty nice to look at some poll and see what your constituents think.
Also, "I'm undecided but you'll force me to vote 'no' if you don't give the FBI a week to investigate" is likely to be a very comfortable position for the other wavering senators too.
Flake has plenty of leverage here because if he's a "no" on the floor, Kavanaugh is probably toast.
(Whispers: I don't get why Flake, Collins, Murk, Heitkamp and Manchin don't just get together and say they need an FBI investigation and will revisit in a week.)

@maggiekb1 @AnnFinkbeiner Her statement said she was "aware of other witnesses" but I don't believe any have come forward yet.
The behavior Swetnick described ought to have had a lot of witnesses. He should probably either produce some of those witnesses or STFU because otherwise he isn't doing his client or his cause any favors. https://t.co/6PtVE4dQ17
Don't know what would have happened if he'd been more honest on these matters. Arguably, the fact that he could easily have been blackout drunk potentially tips the balance of the evidence in a "he said, she said" with Ford. But instead he made a calculation to lie—and it worked!
They aren't white lies, either. Kavanaugh was lying about stuff that would establish (i) his propensity to drink to excess, especially to the point of blacking out or misremebering events and (ii) objectifying attitudes he had toward women he had has a young man.
Yeah, I don't get why this isn't more of a part of the conversation.

Based on the polls about voter enthusiasm, our model thinks the most likely range is that somewhere between 91 million and 102 million votes will be cast for the U.S. House. Which is a **lot**. (78 million votes were cast in 2014). But still well short of 50% turnout. https://t.co/3NqNg1pU4k
Part of that, of course, is because elite opinion directly influences public opinion! And probably more so for Supreme Court picks than for other kinds of things.

Behind the scenes, there's a bit more going on. Democrats have generally gotten very good district-by-district polls for the past couple weeks. But the generic ballot has tightened just a teensy bit and Trump approval has improved a tick. Those changes have roughly cancelled out.
Despite all the political news, our House and Senate forecasts have been very, very (frankly a bit boringly) steady for several weeks, with Dems continuing to hover at a ~80% chance of taking the House but the GOP with a ~70% chance of keeping the Senate. https://t.co/sRTaNMQx1s
I agree with some of this, but it's also relevant that Kavanaugh, by virtue of his background and biography, represents a lot of cultural archetypes that liberals will inherently be inclined to critique and distrust &amp; conservatives will inherently be inclined to trust and defend. https://t.co/J6wejjSvDN
By this same principle there would also be a lot of incentive to play up frivolous accusations or even to plant false ones.
4 accusations are much more credible than 1 accusation. But, it also gives you more evidence to cherry-pick from if you want to find weak links. It also allows you to allege a conspiracy, even though these women don't seem to have coordinated in any direct way.

Heard from 625 friends who I called at random from a list of all registered voters in the United States and it turns out that Kavanaugh is fairly unpopular overall, although opinion is highly divided along partisan lines.
The takes trying to minimize the degree of minimization that Kavanaugh did in the Fox interview are Really Bad Takes. Also, some things he said were probably lies.		But I also don't see any contradictions per se between his Fox interview and his statement to the Judiciary Cmte.
Folks, it's more than fair to say that Kavanaugh "portrayed himself as a choir boy" in the Fox News interview, in the way that phrase is colloquially used. He did a lot to minimize his behavior. But he *didn't* say that he didn't drink—he said he'd never blacked out.
Avenatti might be literally the last person I'd tell you to hire as your attorney in a case like this. But he's also a figure who friends with a casual interest in politics often have a different (less cynical) impression of than people like me who cover politics for a living.
You, dumb: Kavanaugh portrayed himself as a choir boy in the Fox News interview.	Me, smart: That's a complete mischaracterization. He never actually claimed to sing in a choir.
@HashtagGriswold Yeah, I think you're reading that wrong. She refers back to high school in the preamble because they'd been talking earlier about high school. But the question was whether he'd ever blacked out -- not whether he'd ever blacked out in high school.

@asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp Maybe he's both one of the genetically lucky (?) ones *and* all of those repeated references were bad jokes. But we're certainly flirting with 95% or 98% even if it's not 100%.
@asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp If you came across the same study that I did, then ~60% looks like the rate within a period of several months, not a *lifetime* rate. But again, this is a guy who's made several references to having been too drunk to remember anything, including in his yearbook, etc.
@SeanTrende @alwaysbeebetter @asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp But he didn't say e.g. "I don't recall ever having completely blacked out, but there were plenty of nights where the details were fuzzy." That would have been more credible. He just completely denied it.
@asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp What if it's 90%? He also seemingly referred to having been blackout drunk in one of the emails released to the Judiciary Committee, which further increases the probability.  https://t.co/eGT2zRkmAm
@asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp From some quick Googling, it seems like the rate of having been blackout drunk at least occasionally is quite high among heavy drinkers, especially among men. There are also plenty of times when you might not have blacked out per se but would also not be a reliable narrator.
@asymmetricinfo @DouthatNYT @DKThomp Neither you or I are a physician and I'm open to evidence on this, but I've had plenty of experience being around heavy drinkers (and have had plenty of long nights myself) and am skeptical that this is common. There are also witnesses who routinely saw him incoherently drunk.
@DouthatNYT @DKThomp He denied ever having been blackout drunk which is almost certainly a flagrant lie and which is highly relevant to his credibility.

@jonathanchait @LPDonovan @yeselson Probably, and the rationale would be that Democrats had abused the filibuster by using it to oppose e.g. Barrett on purely ideological grounds, whereas Kavanaugh had been an appropriate use of it.
@LPDonovan @jonathanchait @yeselson I think it probably is true that in this particular case, the filibuster would have been successfully employed against Kavanaugh. That would probably have been a huge favor to McConnell, though -- a relatively elegant way out of this mess.
I also think this can help explain the crazy Whelan/doppelganger episode. They know it can be established that he routinely drank to excess and that will render his refutation of Ford's claims less reliable. So there's a cockamamie effort to "prove" he didn't so it.
I've always thought this is the most likely scenario, although it's really a range of scenarios (e.g. "has only a vague memory of what happened that night", "has no memory of that night but can't categorically rule it out because he was routinely blackout drunk", etc.) https://t.co/0OVfC9Njh7

@mitchellichtman Although there are a few ambiguities (North Dakota doesn't technically have voter registration, for instance), most pollsters take LVs as a subset of RVs.
I'd also note that it's not like the topline numbers in the polls have been getting better for the GOP.  More like the opposite, frankly. It seems plausible that the GOP base is getting a bit more energized *but* independents are swinging harder to Dems.
@mitchellichtman Likely voters = people who the pollsters predict will actually end up voting. There are lots of different methods, some of which are perhaps dumb, but on average LV polls are more accurate. More background here: https://t.co/mh36PcHfCa
Usually, the likely v. registered voter gap favors the GOP by more than that. It was 6 points in 2010, for example. (Although that was a pretty extreme case.) Still, a few weeks ago, it seemed like the GOP might actually *lose* ground in LV polls, so this is progress of a sort.
Here's one small thing that's gone right for the GOP. We've now gotten a lot more polls that directly compare likely and registered voters, and on average the GOP does a bit better in the LV version. About 0.7 percentage points better, on average. https://t.co/sGhnYcz5Nc

I find Kavanaugh's extremely sweeping denials of having participated in any sort of untoward or inappropriate or illicit activity, of having been anything other than a choir boy throughout high school and college, to be a curious strategy.
@jodyavirgan Or a book, even.
Been making this case on Twitter for a while, but here's the longform version of my argument for why the GOP would be better off politically if Kavanaugh withdraws ASAP. https://t.co/OgXTwhg15A
@robferdman What he says is sort of half-true. "And yes, there were parties. And the drinking age was 18, and yes, the seniors were legal and had beer there." It looks like the law was grandfathered in for people 18+ as of 7/1/82, so seniors would have been able to drink when he was 17.

Anonymous sourcing can be a necessity sometimes. But some news outlets go *as far as possible* in characterizing the sources and the reliability of the information, and getting as much on the record as possible. Others are indifferent—and no surprise, they tend to fuck up a lot.

p.s. the correct esoteric physics metaphor to use with Rosenstein is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, not Schrödinger's cat, insofar as the the reporting of the story has possibly affected the outcome.

I dunno, seems to me there are likely to be biases in the other direction, given that (rough guess) ~90% of the Republican insiders deciding what to do about Kavanaugh are men (as are most of the journalists covering the story, BTW). https://t.co/OEKEo4Adf6

@EsotericCD I dunno, I think Trump did a lot to rewire peer groups on politics Twitter, where some people who wouldn't ordinarily get along get along pretty well, and some of this is what you'd get if you had Romney or a more typical Republican president instead.
@jbarro One *possible* endgame is: The hearing is expeditious. Questioning of Ford is fairly gentle. Kavanaugh is firm in his denials but not too forthcoming. Collins et. al use his lack of candor as their excuse not to confirm him. Everyone saves a bit of face. He's withdrawn next week.
It's also possible that it becomes clear after Thursday's testimony that Judge will need to testify, in which case by not subpoenaing him now you're just going to add more delays to the process.
The fact that the GOP doesn't want Judge to testify is a pretty big tell that they're worried about inquiries into Kavanaugh's drinking/partying habits. Whether they're worried about the substance of those inquires or merely their "optics", I don't know. https://t.co/uqSjUHg4yi

@NickRiccardi @PatrickRuffini @asymmetricinfo @jbarro You're right that it gets harder the longer they wait. That's why I think McConnell should look for the first possible excuse to replace him. Both the Whelan stuff and Trump's tweets were big unforced errors for the GOP because they complicate the story &amp; prolong the timeline.
@PatrickRuffini @asymmetricinfo @jbarro I agree they should try to get *someone* appointed to the Court before the midterms.		I don't think it should be Kavanaugh. And I don't the press coverage has really reflected how unpopular he is. SCOTUS picks are usually popular. The public doesn't like this choice, however.
@PatrickRuffini @asymmetricinfo @jbarro Meh, there's no before-and-after comparison in the Upshot polls since they hadn't been asking about Kavanaugh in any of their polls until the accusations were made public.
@asymmetricinfo @jbarro He is getting more unpopular in most polls, though. The YouGov poll was the only exception so far, in fact. https://t.co/OK3RdLiY6y
Miers was as unpopular as Kavanaugh but her nomination was withdrawn. Bork was unpopular but didn't get confirmed. Clarence Thomas was actually quite popular, FWIW. So we'd be in uncharted territory if Kavanaugh is confirmed. https://t.co/CpFKiaCJlU https://t.co/qPbZak0yVG

One caution is that they aren't selecting districts at random; the places where they've run polls so far include some pretty funky districts where partisanship doesn't tell the full story. Still, it's a fairly diverse array of districts.
So far in these Upshot/Siena polls, Democrats are running a net of 5 points ahead of district partisanship in districts with GOP *incumbents* and 14 points ahead of partisanship in open-seat races. Both of those numbers are very good—what you'd expect in a pretty big wave. https://t.co/LqtaiSd6nc

@DouthatNYT @jbarro It's certainly possible (in which case it was still extremely reckless) but that weights the possibilities toward the evidence not being very solid and/or the theory emerging from desperation because there's evidence that ties Kavanaugh to the case.
@DouthatNYT @jbarro Someone knows but they didn't tell law-enforcement authorities and they couldn't get a single reporter to pick up the story so instead they posted a super-long thread about it on Twitter?
@jbview The base rate of vetting fiascos is actually pretty high and for a variety of reasons is liable to be higher than usual under these circumstances.
Could the GOP confirm someone in the lame-duck session? Possibly. (Probably?) But if it's just lost Congress in a landslide, that's going to be very unpopular and GOP senators in swing states are going to be very nervous. Or the new nominee could have his own vetting problems.
Contrary to the conventional wisdom I think there *is* some chance that if the GOP doesn't get Kavanaugh, it doesn't get a conservative justice at all. They're running out of time to confirm someone other than Kavanaugh pre-midterms and there's a ~30% chance Dems win the Senate.
@adamdavidson Because you have to be pretty far into a bubble to think it was a good idea to post those tweets in the first place and you're shellshocked by the reaction to them.
@adrian_gray There's one "if": Did Kavanaugh encourage this line of defense? *If* the answer is yes, then it reflects really badly on him *even if every other assumption is resolved in as generous a way as possible for him*.
@adrian_gray I'm not really venturing out on a limb. From the Post's reporting it seems quite likely that Kavanaugh was aware of this strategy.
If you had knowledge of the incident, it would also raise the question of whether you ought to have alerted authorities at the time it occurred.		And that's the *best* case scenario. If you didn't know what happened, but you were party to this strategy, it's even crazier.
Suppose you're Kavanaugh, and you're innocent, and you know that the other guy did it. That's an exceptionally delicate and challenging situation. Literally the worst possible way in the world to handle would be to have your buddy disclose it in some insane Twitter thread.
If Kavanaugh encouraged Whelan to circulate this particular theory in this particular way, it shows exceptionally poor judgment at a minimum (and desperation at a maximum). https://t.co/d5Hna1mOhu
@jbarro If Kavanaugh encouraged or authorized this, the priors update in ways that range from marginally to extremely problematic for Kavanaugh. It doesn't seem a given that Kavanaugh knew about it, though.
@geoffreyvs @SeanTrende @lauretig For House races though states with &lt;=4 congressional districts tend to get covered more because a pollster can get reasonable sample sizes for all the congressional districts with one statewide poll.
@kdrum I buy that he could have proprietary information, but that could cut a lot of different ways. e.g. if he's aware of new evidence (witnesses, etc.) establishing that *something* happened to Ford that night, then suddenly this theory becomes the best/only defense.
@EsotericCD Ehh, I think a lot of people subscribe to the "ask for the stars and they'll give you the moon" theory of negotiating.

@SeanTrende @LPDonovan But I'm not sure that if Marist surveyed this race, they wouldn't find Tester +9 or something. There's not a lot to anchor yourself to. YouGov is the closest but they've been pretty R-leaning this cycle and their sample size was quite small.

@LPDonovan @SeanTrende Not uncommon to double down. I think Democrats set the record in 2012 when they released 6,121,734 internal polls showing the Wisconsin recall election tied.		The prior that publicly-released internals exaggerate their candidates' standing is really, really, really robust.
@LPDonovan @SeanTrende I don't know, it seems like a super standard spot to release an internal. Race is close-ish and isn't getting much attention. You're really down 4-6 points but you get a lucky sample/tweak some assumptions to show yourself tied. Decide to release the poll to create some buzz.
@SeanTrende We could really use some high-quality polling in MT. Hasn't been a gold standard poll there (non-partisan with landlines + cells) all cycle. But FWIW, an R internal showing a tie, from a pollster we calculate as having a pretty big house effect, isn't great news for Rosendale.

(Whispers: when both polls have a sample size of only 300-400 people, a poll showing the Democrat up 4 points and another one showing the Republican up 4 points are within one another's margins of error).
As an aside, I kinda hate when our forecasts are in the ~80% range. That's the zone when people start to mentally round up to 100%. And they shouldn't; 80% is a long way from certain. At the same time, it's high enough that it's disingenuous to imply that it's anybody's race.
To maintain &gt;80% chance of winning the House in our model, Democrats need to consistently have VERY good polling. And a lot of their polling *has* been very good or even great. But, there's a bit of weakness in the Sunbelt—particularly CA &amp; FL.

With that said, there's quite a bit of high-quality polling in Tennessee. So that makes the numbers more believable than if there's just one or two sketchy internal polls, like in (say) FL-27.
When there's a big gap between polls and "fundamentals" at this stage—fundamentals meaning non-polling factors that forecast a race, like a state's partisan lean—the race moves toward fundamentals about 3/4 of the time. A good case in point is Evan Bayh's race in 2016. https://t.co/UAWWjLN6bA

@mattyglesias And I'm not sure this actually helps the red-state Dems! Before they could just have voted *for* Kavanaugh and used it to bolster their reputation for independence. In some ways their decision is harder now.
@mattyglesias Meh. I think Republicans 1) want to confirm a *conservative justice* and 2) want to do so without paying a big political price, and the equilibrium will flip pretty quickly if Kavanaugh takes on more water.		(n.b. typo fixed)
1) Ford isn't willing to testify and this is the exit strategy.	2) It's a trap to lure Republicans into overcommitting to Kavanaugh and Ford will later agree to testify.	3) It's a bargaining position; and Dems will seek a compromise wherein, e.g., additional witnesses are called.
Democrats can't really have expected Republicans to agree to an FBI investigation before continuing the Kavanaugh process. So everything that's happened *since* last night is fairly predictable. The complication is that Democrats could have had several different goals:
Be more wary of this in the case of polls with high numbers of undecided voters and/or candidates with low name recognition. It's more likely to be an issue in WV-3 than in the Texas senate race, for example.
So e.g. if you have a poll showing the Republican up 3 in a very blue district, the poll may be a perfectly accurate snapshot of currently-decided voters, but it may nevertheless be true that the Democrat is favored because undecideds will break heavily D.
Another important thing to keep in mind is that partisanship sometimes kicks in late, or manifests itself in the behavior of undecided voters and so doesn't become apparent until election day. https://t.co/uKDcLnvJXh
@mattyglesias Of course it's a problem. But, in national polls or polls of diverse states, sometimes you get lucky and the errors among different subgroups cancel out. Less so if you're looking at polls of congressional districts or smaller, more idiosyncratic states.
But be wary of thinking that a poll can "prove" your hypothesis when the poll involves historically hard-to-poll groups. Hispanic and white-working-class voters have given pollsters a lot of trouble in general elections. Black voters are hard to pin down in Democratic primaries.
We could get into a discussion about whether polling error is persistent from year to year. If you missed low on R's in a certain state 2 years ago, are you likely to also do so this year? To a first approximation, the answer is "not necessarily", but it's a complicated question.
By the same token, Democrats' most impressive polling is probably in the Midwest, which is where Trump beat his polls in 2016.
Seems fair to say that Democrats' polling is underwhelming in states and districts with large numbers of Hispanic voters. At the same time, polling has sometimes lowballed Democrats' numbers in these areas.
@mWilstory I think Texas is a tough state to poll (lots of new residents, low turnout among certain voting groups, may be hard to reach Spanish-speaking voters) and it's probably a healthy sign that we're seeing some disagreement.

Thing is, though, that Tennessee and Texas are pretty different races, and Democrats' path to the Senate is inherently very uphill, so they can't really pick and choose between a 26% and a 38% opportunity when the whole problem is that they don't have enough opportunities.
Tennessee is a somewhat better Democratic opportunity at this point. Bredesen slightly leads in polls. Our model is skeptical that he can sustain it so hedges toward Blackburn but still gives Bredesen about a 3 in 8 (38%) chance.
Beto's chances down to about 1 in 4 (26%) after that Quinnipiac poll. Were closer to 1 in 3 (33%) before. https://t.co/GXbUzmsJOM
My priors on this are heavily influenced by the fact that McConnell (reportedly) didn't want Kavanaugh in the first place.

But it's for precisely that reason that the rollout of the new nominee would need to be managed carefully, and sooner rather than later, rather than looking like some last-minute replacement understudy after Kavanaugh collapsed under his own weight.
p.s. If there's a replacement nominee, he or she is likely to be fairly unpopular. Kavanaugh was pretty unpopular even before the allegations came out and the public is just gonna be skeptical of almost any GOP nominee under these circumstances.
But probably not if Kavanaugh flails around for 2 weeks and *then* is forced to withdraw. I also think expecting to confirm someone in the lame duck session could be hard *if* Democrats win the Senate (~33% chance) and the new nominee hasn't established that foothold pre-Nov. 6.
The predicate is that time is precious for the GOP. If Kavanaugh were to withdraw *now*, they just *might* have enough time to confirm someone else before the midterm, or at least establish a foothold for the new nominee before the lame-duck session.
The GOP's least-worst outcome, politically, is probably if Kavanaugh withdraws in advance of the hearing—and it sounds like that's what McConnell would really prefer if he had the choice. https://t.co/aSdiPeYop6

@henryolsenEPPC To a second approximation: 1) Might be a bit lower than 50% in House races, where challengers can have low name recognition. 2) Races often break in the direction of the "fundamentals", so e.g. a GOP incumbent at 45% in a Clinton district will lose &gt;50% (maybe &gt;&gt;50%) of the time.
@henryolsenEPPC To a first approximation, an incumbent polling at 45 on Sept. 15 will win about 50% of the time if his opponent is also polling at 45. That is, you should look at the margin rather than the incumbent's vote share.

@jodyavirgan Like I honestly think one of the Democratic candidates for *president* in 2020 should make the MTA and/or the Washington Metro one of their issues, which will like double the amount of press coverage they get.

You can say polling in party primaries is awful (true). But it's less terrible when the candidates have high name recognition, when it's only a 2-way race instead of multiway, and when the polling stays the same for months. And even when it's terrible, usually not 40 points off.
Hot take: The media should have paid more attention to polls in the NYGOV race and less attention to Cynthia Nixon's campaign. Other races, including others with progressive challengers, were a lot more deserving of that bandwidth.

(I think I've said this like 6 million times before, but the decline of the incumbency advantage is both very important and weirdly overlooked. It's a big part of why Democrats could gain 30, 40, 50 seats this year despite districts being much more polarized than they once were.)
In fact, the incumbency advantage is much smaller than it once was, so it wouldn't surprise me to start seeing House control flip back and forth between the parties more often, especially if redistricting produces a relatively neutral map starting in 2022.
Good news (?) for election geeks is that it seems pretty likely that both the House and Senate will be "in play" again in 2020 regardless of what happens this year. https://t.co/XCVHtpQYVn

The thing is, Democrats have so much exposure that they're really playing whack-a-mole in the Senate. Fox came out with relatively good numbers for them in Missouri and Arizona. But! They have Heitkamp down in ND and Donnelly a tick behind in Indiana.
This is pretty rough poll for Heitkamp in North Dakota, and since there have been very few public polls in the state, our model's going to weight it heavily. https://t.co/fTeRg7mNqr

Here's a bunch more context on our Senate forecast. Democrats have path(s) to victory, but Republicans have much easier ones. https://t.co/uU2OvEE22Z
@databyler We also have "fundamentals" helping Democrats in most states, although that's partially offset by Tennessee, where it hurts them quite a bit. Our fundamentals calculation actually likes Beto's chances in Texas, interestingly enough.
It's true that other races could become competitive. But if some of the stronger Democratic incumbents like Manchin and Tester are having trouble hanging on, odds are that the weaker ones like McCaskill are already toast and therefore Dems' Senate chances are toast too.
As this chart also makes clear, there's really a top tier of 7 senate races to watch: the 3 most vulnerable Dem incumbents (FL, MO, ND) plus their 4 best GOP-held pickup opportunities (AZ, NV, TN, TX).

@JohnJHarwood Yeah, I think that's right. We show a *lot* of races where Democrats are like 55 or 60 or 65% favorites. Going to be hard for them to hold all of those, though, unless the climate shifts another couple points in their direction.

What's interesting is that it feels like our model is pretty optimistic for Democrats in individual races -- notably in FL/ND/MO, for example -- and yet it's not all that bullish on their chances to win the majority. (Although, 1 in 3 isn't too bad.) It's just a really tough map.

But if they won the House popular vote by only 2 points, which is what the recent Selzer (also a very good pollster) showed, they'd project to gain only ~10 House seats and to *lose* about 5 Senate seats.
I know the generic ballot is pretty abstract for people, but just to give a sense of what it means....		If Democrats were to win the House popular vote by 14 points, as per this morning's Quinnipiac poll, we'd project them to gain ~65 (!) House seats and also pick up the Senate.

If anything, LV results might be slightly *better* for Democrats on average, although it varies a lot from poll to poll. Reflects D enthusiasm, plus the Trump coalition containing more noncollege voters who don't always show up at midterms.
Traditionally in midterms, Republicans gain ground on polls of likely voters, relative to those of registered voters. But as more pollsters release data that contain both RV and LV results—Upshot/Siena, Monmouth and Marist are all doing that—we're not seeing that this year.
People might ask how a poll with only 250 respondents (so far) can matter. Indeed, our model weights polls by sample size (among other things). But there was no polling at all in this district before. Going from *no* polling to *some* is a bigger improvement than you'd think.
Fun to see the 538 model react in not-quite-realtime to @UpshotNYT's realtime polling. Even an incomplete poll with ~250 respondents was enough to take TX-23 from lean Democratic to tossup, for instance. https://t.co/A4zsewQg2k

(At some point, going to do an American Chopper meme about whether the generic ballot and the House popular vote are equivalent to one another.)
Obviously a lot of uncertainty around that calculation because we're talking about a finite number of Senate races. e.g. if Beto, Heitkamp and Nelson all win their races by 1 point, Democrats could back their way in. But it's quite a bit tougher than the House.
We're still refining this calculation, but it looks like Democrats would need to win the generic ballot/House popular vote by around *11* points to be favored to take the *Senate*. (For the House itself, we show the breakeven point as being more like 6 points.)
Personally, I think Upshot is handling this trade-off well. In the House 100 500-person polls &gt;&gt; 50 1,000-person polls. The key in the House is to paint a good overall picture in a diverse set of districts and not fixate on any one race.
Anyway, people need to watch the sample sizes carefully on House polls. *Most* of them are in the range of 200-600 respondents, enough where sampling error can be pretty meaningful. By contrast, POTUS and Senate polls typically start at 600 people and can get much larger (1000+).
Polls of 500 people are pretty noisy, too, though, more than I think most people would realize. https://t.co/JN75SYC8Qa

To be clear, I don't think Democrats are better off for having lost the presidency. It's just a weird map where there are a *lot* of seats in play. For whatever reason this class of senators almost always has interesting, dynamic election cycles (2018, 2012, 2006, 2000, 1994).
Plus, Dems would be longshots in NV and AZ and would have no shot in hell at TX or TN. And there would have been no AL special election for Doug Jones to win.
Under those conditions, I'd guess that ND, MO and FL would be likely Republican pickups. WV, IN and MT would be lean Republican. MI, MN, OH, PA, WI, NJ would all be toss-ups or pretty close to it.
Our Senate forecasts are *almost* ready and it's sort of interesting to think about how much trouble Democratic incumbents would be in if there was a Democrat in the White House instead of Trump.

A different exit poll has Sweden Democrats at 19%, which is right in line with the pre-election polling average. https://t.co/JEL8TpwZFw
Anyway, if the exit polls are right, this will be like the 261314th consecutive election in which the polls, while far from perfect, were closer to reality than the media narrative. Still not great if Sweden Democrats are getting 16%, though, which is up from last time.
There's also a persistent myth that nationalist parties outperform their polls. It simply isn't true, at least not over the long-run. And if anything they've underperformed their polls in recent elections. https://t.co/WpSr6GGK8J
I don't know, polls that have nationalist parties doing well seem to get a disproportionate amount of media attention, which can skew impressions. Sweden Democrats were polling at ~18/19 on average; this would be a bit below but not that far off. https://t.co/HIyRPUpzMk
But there are 13 "lean D" districts, 17 toss-ups and 20 "lean R" districts. Plus, 48 "likely R" districts where you could have a surprise. Can Dems win 14 from that list? Actuarily speaking, they probably will, unless the overall climate shifts a couple points toward Republicans.
I've seen people say "but these polls show ties; shouldn't Dems be *leading* if they're favored to take the House?" IMO that's partly right but mostly wrong. The partly right part is that Dems are certainly not guaranteed of much. We show only 204 districts as solid or likely D.
So far, these polls have been running pretty much in line with expectations/538's forecasts. Maybe a bit better for Dems than expected in MN-3 and a bit worse in CA-48. But pretty darn close. Another poll showing Ojeda competitive in WV-3 would be a big deal for our model. https://t.co/zfKG53McjW

Granted, it's a complicated case. And granted, I'm not sure whether the Op-Ed page has the same policies (or any policies) on anonymity. But my view is that this was too hot/complicated/important for an Op-Ed and it should have been turned over to the newsroom to handle.
Also, the policy demands especially high scrutiny for direct quotes from anonymous sources. This went way, way behind that: an entire Op-Ed in the source's voice!
The NYT's policy on anonymous sources explicitly asks reporters to consider whether someone is risking their career as a possible justification for granting anonymity. So the effect on their future earning prospects is at least pertinent to the question. https://t.co/cBlAV4dlG7
So ignore the idiots and be transparent, which the rest of your readers will appreciate.
One argument against transparency in data journalism—and other journalism—is that extra detail you provide will be used against you by idiots acting in bad faith. Which is 100% true, it will be. But the lack of detail will also be used against you by idiots acting in bad faith.
This is why letting someone publish an anonymous, self-aggrandizing Op-Ed -- one which, moreover, is detrimental to its own stated cause -- is journalistically dubious (to put it nicely). https://t.co/hyikWJ7rcF
@DougPolkPoker The Senate is different because only 1/3 of seats are up for re-election and they happen to be overwhelmingly Dem-held seats.		But the point is there's an incongruity. Democratic incumbents in states like FL &amp; MO are polling worse than you'd expect based on other indicators.
@DougPolkPoker Not sure how technical you want to get but Democrats' projected margin of victory in the popular vote for the U.S. House (~7-8 points) and projected number of seat pickups in the House (~30ish) are consistent with what most people would call waves.
@DougPolkPoker It's interesting because right now polls show (i) Democrats having a wave election, which matches or exceeds those other years, but (ii) also like 3 of their Senate incumbents tied or losing. I'm saying that (i) and (ii) aren't especially compatible with one another.

@ArjunJaikumar Yeah, Senate incumbents only.
The logic here is that if you're an incumbent, you usually will have won election in tougher environment than you're facing now. e.g. all the Democratic Senate incumbents who are trying to get re-elected in a D+8 environment in 2018 already won races in a D+1 environment in 2012.
Underrated: How rarely incumbents lose when their party is having a good year overall.		In our Senate database, there are 5 years I'd consider wave elections (94, 2010 and 14 for R's; 2006 and 08 for D's). How did incumbents from the waving parties do? Undefeated. 54 for 54.
The Upshot/Siena polls haven't been particularly Republican (or Democratic-) leaning so far. Siena's earlier polls of New York state had *seemed* Republican leaning, which is what was driving that calculation. But now looks like e.g. Katko may just have been a strong candidate. https://t.co/t0lxOu79Lj

@chucktodd Certainly true that the Beto-Cruz race inspires a *lot* of passion. In some ways could end up being a bit like Oliver North vs. Chuck Robb in 1994, where Robb held on by 3 points but almost everything else went terribly for Democrats that night.
For data-y stuff, it's not always easy to tell what has a lot of thought and effort behind it and what doesn't. In general, though, give the benefit of the doubt to models that "show their work" and can explain what they're doing *and why they're doing it* in plain language.
On top of that, the data collection process is a huge task unto itself (especially for the House with 435 races). And communicating about them can be challenging. It's a real team effort.
I just want to underscore that building these models is a *lot* of work. You have to have a lot of domain knowledge about politics, data visualization, coding and (especially) applied statistics. There are lots of weird edge cases and if you take shortcuts you tend to pay for it.
The "sad" part is because I think these models have a lot of value and I think 2016 actually demonstrated that value in a lot of ways, at least for the ones that gave Trump a reasonably good chance. I don't think one should cater to one's critics. But enough about that.

@mattyglesias @conorsen It doesn't assume groups swing more or less. It assumes that some swings are more likely to change votes. If a voter is 3 standard deviations more Republican than average and there's a big national swing to the left, that voters view's can swing a lot but they'll still vote GOP.
With that said, the demographics of the South are changing—and Texas in particular shows up as having relatively high swinginess. The white population there is becoming more educated/secular, and Hispanics in TX are purple-ish rather than solid blue.
Basically, swing voters tend to be non-evangelical whites. In states like Georgia where you have a bifurcated electorate with lots of minority voters but also a lot of evangelical whites, it can be easy for Democrats to get to 47/48% of the vote but never make it up to 50%.
This explains why the Midwest and the Northeast tend to swing more from election to election than the South does. https://t.co/VI8VXyHlql

As an aside, this question of how much to smooth the data is an empirical one—You want to minimize autocorrelation and/or maximize out-of-sample prediction—not an aesthetic one.  And the correct answer differs a *lot* based on what type of election you're looking at.
We were already using this more smoothed, less bouncy version of the generic ballot in our House forecast, so it won't produce any change there. But the version you see on our generic ballot interactive should now closely match the one used by our House model.

At a minimum, I don't think Collins has handled this with much dexterity. She's traditionally had easy re-elections but is potentially a lot more vulnerable in 2020.
The conventional wisdom at the start of the process was that (i) Republicans would get Kavanaugh confirmed *and* (ii) that it would help them politically. Not sure that (i) is in that much doubt but (ii) very much is.

@skepticalsports @bencasselman @andrewflowers I dunno but based on my admittedly personal (n=1) experience the Times wouldn't resist using sources from within the building as part of its reporting.

5. In sum, there's high *potential* for a Democratic wave in the House. Maybe even a big wave. But not very much is baked in yet. Some Republican incumbents will prove resilient and Democrats really have to grind it out on a district-by-district basis.
4. District-level polling lags behind other indicators for Dems. It's not *bad*, but looks more tossup-y than landslide-like. However, district-level polls sometimes underrate challengers at this stage because of low name recognition. And Dems have a lot of $ to equalize that.
3. There's a big difference between an 6-7 point lead and a 8-9 point lead. The former is "we're not even sure who wins the House". The latter is well into landslide territory, with Dems also having a shot at the Senate.
1. Democrats are in their best position in months in both the generic ballot and Trump approval.	2. *Some* of that is probably noise (especially the generic ballot, which is noisy). But an 8-9 point lead for Democrats is plausible, even if they probably aren't up double digits.
So, it's after Labor Day, and here's where the race for the House stands: https://t.co/rVVgpwLwR2
Slade Gorton is a very baseball-ish name, maybe the most ever for a Senator. It sounds like he should have played 3rd base for the San Diego Padres in the late 1980s. https://t.co/dQBT9x1GbK
I *do* think it's good that people see a 4 in 5 (~80%) chance and are like "well, remember Hillary? That's not certain at all". Because, indeed, it's a looooong way from certain.
Also, that brought us President Obama in 2008 and '2, and Republicans winning the House in 2010 and Senate in 2014, all of which were correctly forecasted by polls/models. Things that are forecasted to happen 4 in 5 times happen about 4 in 5 times and fail to happen 1 in 5 times. https://t.co/5iwV9gWKiL

One consequence of it being midterm election season is that I type a lot of things like "can't wait to see your new House"
@baseballot I realized that so I guess that means I'm not a person. 🤖
To be sure, the Democrat's signs weren't actually in a *yard*, but in some sort of median near a parking lot, and they'd been knocked over the next day. But as I noshed on a lobster roll, and looked into the eyes of passersby, the vibrations were unmistakable.
Can confirm the Blue Wave. In Maine, 2/3 of the yard signs I saw (n=3) were for the Democratic candidate for Senate, even though he far trails Angus King and the Republican in polls. Although, the signs had a moose on them, so could signal a Bull Moose Party Wave instead. https://t.co/SAlsG8sECz
@TheStalwart How about "flaneur"
@kkondik At the congressional district level, that's not true any more and blue districts are growing at about the same rate as red ones.
I get why campaigns go into "skewed polls" mode if everything is hopeless. But this year polls suggest both the House and Senate could go either way. Every moment a campaign spends whining about the polls is a moment it should be shutting the F up and working to improve its odds.
Couple of further polls came out after I wrote this, and this is looking more like it *might* be a real downtick and not just noise. Still, best to wait a week or two. https://t.co/ltRbZkacS3
@ForecasterEnten They also have all the money in the world so don't necessarily need more $$. I dunno, sometimes I just think campaigns pay a lot for polling and get excited and want to put polls out showing them doing well, even if there isn't necessarily a tactical benefit.
@ForecasterEnten Yeah.... that's.... weird. To me it feels either like they're trying to pre-empt another poll, or they think media attention benefits them and want more of it.
Got our first poll of the campaign in Paul Ryan's former district. Our model is a bit skeptical since its a partisan poll, but certainly a competitive race. https://t.co/injHPYKSf4 https://t.co/lHCVTJaXhZ
So *some* or perhaps even most of this was inevitable. But the backlash against Obama happened *very* fast and was *very* forceful, and I'm not sure those factors alone are sufficient to explain it. Racial resentment was undoubtedly also a large factor.
There wasn't any one cause. The economy was bad. Dems passed (or tried to pass) some really unpopular legislation. D voters were unmotivated; the Obama coalition didn't turn out at midterms. The GOP ran candidates everywhere and had lots of $ in a post-Citizens United universe.
Midterms are usually bad for the president's party. But the average midterm swing is about 7 points—this was more than twice as large. Also, it came in a year which was greatly important for redistricting, which is still paying dividends for the GOP.
Random aside, but I think the 2010 midterms are under-appreciated as a seminal event of our political era.		There was a 17-point swing from the 2008 popular vote in the House (D +10) to the 2010 vote (R +7). That's huge: the largest swing since WW2.
Also, if you totally ignored the polls and just looked at "hard" data on behavior—voting in special and interim elections, voters donating money, candidate recruitment and retirement—you'd conclude that things are a fair bit *worse* for the GOP than what the polls show.
One of the more reliable bits of anecdata is that whichever side complains more about polls being skewed typically loses -- and usually by more than polls show.

In general, if you're a Republican in Texas, you want to keep things pretty low-profile. The electorate that usually shows up to vote is quite red. The *potential* electorate is a lot more purple.
@BenAlamarESPN Looking at this too. It's kind of a complicated question because there's a lot of stuff to control for when accounting for incumbency!
I haven't looked at this in a formal way yet (I'm sure someone else has?) but it sure seems like senators from smaller states have a larger incumbency advantage. Easier to be a "good fit" in a low-population state where you can get to know your constituents really well.
On the one hand, Trump's approval rating in our average (40.7%) is now the lowest its been since April. 		On the other hand, it's never been higher than 42.7% in that period, so we aren't talking big movement. https://t.co/j7XEedEnAf
But the other Republican is Chris McDaniel, who actually trails Espy in polls and who could definitely blow it. Fortunately for the GOP, McDaniel is also in a fairly distant 3rd place in polls of the open primary. Multi-way races can be slightly nutty, though.
If no one gets 50% on 11/6, there will be a runoff on 11/27. And the top Democrat, Mike Espy, will probably make the runoff.		Espy is a long shot if the Republican opponent is the current appointed incumbent, Cindy Hyde-Smith. Not completely dead in the water, but a big underdog.
Hopefully all of U.S. election nerd twitter is asleep by now, but just realized that there's a decent shot we won't officially know who won the U.S. Senate until Nov. 27. That's because Mississippi is holding a Louisiana-style 'jungle primary" on Nov. 6 for Cochran's former seat.
Those stories aren't necessarily even inconsistent with one another. Dems have a lot of money, lots of voter enthusiasm and lots of competent (but not necessarily well-known) candidates, etc. So you might expect the stretch run of the campaign to help them in swing districts.
If you looked at district-level polls alone, you'd infer Dems would win the House popular vote by ~6 points. If you looked at "fundamentals" alone, you'd guess like 8 or 9. The generic ballot is somewhere in between. Those aren't big differences, but they're *consequential* ones.
The other thing to keep in mind is how thin the margin is between Dems failing to win the House at all, and their winning 40 (or more) seats. It really doesn't take much to push them toward one or the other outcome.
@ForecasterEnten District-level polling tends to have a bit of pro-incumbent bias at this stage, which mostly goes away by Election Day. Our model doesn't try to de-bias the polls, but that's why I would recommend people look at the broader scope of indicators.
In the House, the publicly-available, district-level polling isn't *bad* for Democrats, exactly, but it's probably their weakest indicator. More in line with a toss-up race nationally than one where you'd call Democrats favorites.
If Dems won the popular vote for the House by the same margin (5.7%) that the GOP did in 2010, they'd be only ~even money to win the majority of House seats, and would probably *lose* a Senate seat or 2. So the GOP could easily misread a middling result as a mandate.
@NickRiccardi I guess we'd have to wait and see. But firing Mueller would be a HUGE step beyond anything Trump has done so far—and Trump is pretty darn unpopular despite a good economy. Also, the investigations storylines are recurring rather than one-offs, which is probably riskier for Trump.
This is true and indeed deserves more emphasis, but there are also close variations on this scenario where the GOP does all of the below—except it results in them getting clobbered in 2020. https://t.co/FYiU9fjakc
Having access to good sources is still *highly* prestigious in White House coverage (though, maybe less so in election coverage). Horse race coverage is still really popular (trust me). And not sure if velocity has slowed down—a lot of quick-hit blog posts have become tweets.
I think No. 3 has changed—the "savvy", Halperin-ish tone has gone out of style in U.S. political journalism. More important, journalists are asking questions about what neutrality really means and whether it's even desirable. But the other categories maybe haven't changed much?

This is probably an unpopular view, but I think cherry-picking evidence, at a certain level of severity, is morally equivalent to fabricating evidence.
Thing to keep in mind about House races is that "the polls" is sometimes a misnomer. If there's any polling, often there's just 1 poll. Or *maybe* 2. And House polls tend to have small sample sizes. Our forecast mostly defers to non-polling data unless there are multiple polls.

@StevenTDennis Right, and I think too many reporters rely on cases like Watergate to excuse glorified gossip columns that violate the way their own internal guidelines say anonymous sources should be used.
Since Democratic delegate allocations are extremely proportional, a candidate now basically has to win 50% of *votes* nationwide to be nominated on the first ballot. That's a pretty high hurdle to clear that many previous nominees wouldn't have met in the past.
Something like this is more likely to be a problem under the new system, for instance: https://t.co/WLwWLVSYHI

This is also in the category of changes that would actually be painful for newsrooms—cutting down on anon sources would require them to break a lot of bad habits—but which would enhance credibility. And probably improve the journalism, too.
#Ackshawlly, the widespread reliance on anonymous sources in American political journalism is problematic in many respects, and often flagrantly violates news organizations' own policies about when to allow use of anonymity, even if Trump is a hypocrite to complain about it.
If I *had* to pick and couldn't call it a toss-up, I guess I'd say Sinema was favored in AZ. (We'll have our Senate model out soon.) But the fact that this is supposed to be Democrats' *best* race and they're maybe only 55-60% favorites there says a lot about the Senate map/math.

With that said, still a very good poll for the GOP. The easiest way for Republicans to hold the House is simply if enough of their incumbents outrun the partisan lean of their districts.
This is a weird race where the "fundamentals" pointed toward a lean Republican race, Cook et. al. had it likely Republican—but the only poll was a partisan one from PPP that had the D ahead. So in some ways, the new poll (showing the R up 15) is more in line with other evidence. https://t.co/CAshsqjw7I
Under somewhat similar circumstances in 1996 in Texas, the state held nonpartisan blanket primaries (basically what they do in Louisiana) on the November election date and then runoffs in December in cases where no candidate won a majority.

If I were mayor of New York, jaywalking statutes would be abolished, but it would be a felony to walk two abreast on streets with construction scaffolding.
If it were me, I'd assign e.g. 50 percent of the delegates in each state on a winner-take-all basis and divide the rest proportionally. That would make it easier for a clear plurality frontrunner to gain momentum and win without the nomination going to the convention.
Superdelegates (and other delegates who become unbound after the 1st ballot) could wind up having a *lot* of say over the nominee because Democratic delegate allocations are so proportional that it will be hard to come up with a majority in a (10? 15? 20?) candidate field.

"Social media is largely beneficial to democracy" is a hugely contrarian position right now that might be mistaken for the conventional wisdom (since that was the conventional wisdom ~3 years ago) but which might nevertheless turn out to be true.

The model will use a slightly more aggressive setting for the generic ballot as we approach Nov. 6 but even then it's best to be skeptical of sudden shifts. You might say the generic is a great measure of the political *climate* but doesn't always forecast the *weather* reliably.
So we've made the generic ballot average in our model less sensitive. The generic ballot is really quite "bouncy", almost uniquely so among the polling measures that I've studied, and it's generally best to wait for several weeks before concluding that something has changed.
One more change, which I think most people will like. After seeing the model bounce around a fair bit as a result of individual generic ballot polls, we went back and looked at whether it needs to use a longer-term/slower-moving generic ballot average. The short answer is yes. https://t.co/wLyOlJpB9o

Fixing this mostly hurts Dems. https://t.co/hzX7yuF32f
We made a handful of further improvements/refinements/bug-fixes to the House model over the weekend. The topline in the Classic and Deluxe forecasts is essentially unchanged. But the Lite forecast has tightened a bit and now gives Republicans a 2 in 5 chance (vs. ~1 in 3 before).
@allahpundit Trump doesn't want Avenatti to peak too soon; will start flaming a month before Iowa. That will lead to a huge burst of media attention and he'll win Iowa with 11% of the vote in a 27-way field and gain momentum, eventually winning on the 99th ballot at the brokered convention.
@B_M_Finnigan The key is not to go cross-town. You can pile on/omit/revise stuff as long as it's in a basically north/south direction. Try to minimize east/west travel though.

This helps incumbents who are now in more favorable districts than the ones they won election in the last time around. So e.g. it helps Conor Lamb (D) in PA-17 and Lloyd Smucker (R) in PA-11. Also helps Dems PA-10 and Republicans in PA-8.

These ranges will meaningfully narrow as we approach Election Day. Still, if you see a model, look at how much uncertainty it accounts for and read the description of how its calculated. More uncertainty *usually* reflects a more well-designed model.

In addition to Classic, there are two other versions of the model called Lite (basically "polls-only") and Deluxe (which incorporates expert ratings e.g. from @CookPolitical). They show pretty similar results, though, with Democrats having about a 7 in 10 chance of a takeover.
With a broad playing field, the range of outcomes is quite wide: the middle 80 percent of the probability distribution covers everything from a 14-seat gain for Democrats (not enough to take the House) to 58 (!!) seats.
The default version of our model, which we call Classic, shows Democrats with a 3 in 4 chance of winning the House and Republicans with a 1 in 4 chance of keeping it. So things are a long way from certain, but it's also not right to call it a toss-up. https://t.co/7D87TSVivS

A fun forecasting factoid is that if you forecast the Democrats to win the House and Republicans to win the Senate, you're probably going to be wrong on at least one of those forecasts. On the bright side, it's quite unlikely that you'll be wrong about both.
Certain types of polling data are just noisier than others. I'm not entirely sure why, but empirically, the generic ballot bounces around a *lot* more than stuff like presidential approval ratings. Also, there are big house effects. Better to take a medium-to-long-term average.
The key to explaining swings on the generic ballot is basically to wait 2 weeks  and then the swing will have reversed itself.
I'm not sure it's so obvious that the independent (Orman) will help Kobach in #KSGOV. Kansas has a lot of moderate Republicans in addition to a lot of conservative ones. Voting for an independent could be an easier sell for Colyer voters than voting Democratic.
@micahcohen Not sure about 14 because I've blocked out my middle school years entirely from my memory. But when was in 5th grade my plan was to become President (of the United States) as a stepping stone to the higher office I *really* cared about, Commissioner of Baseball.
If you live in a state that has a lot of cheese (Wisconsin, Vermont) or hedge funds (Connecticut) or lakes (Minnesota) it probably has a primary tonight and 538 is *liveblogging* it for you --&gt; https://t.co/VA9Urnm0sR

@barry Didn't you get our letter? There was a clerical error, and it turns out you never took enough credit hours. In fact, you shouldn't have been allowed to graduate. Fortunately, you were automatically enrolled in summer school. As you may be aware, the final exam is tomorrow at 830.
Incidentally, this is entirely about the *citizen* population. Democratic districts have about the same (actually a tiny bit larger) *overall* populations on average. It used to be that GOP areas were faster-growing, but that isn't true anymore.
There are several factors, including gerrymandering, that cause Democrats to underperform in the number of *seats* they win in the House relative to their number of *votes*. But this factor works in the opposite direction and counterbalances them to some degree.
One overlooked factor in forecasting the House popular vote is that Democratic districts have fewer eligible voters on average because they have far more immigrants. Here's my estimate of each district's 2018 CVAP (Citizen Voting Age Population) vs. Trump's margin in 2016. https://t.co/VpE55DDWIY
@ForecasterEnten I might be able to tell you right now if it wasn't for goddamned Louisiana and its godforsaken jungle primary, which always requires like 200 extra lines of code.

@LPDonovan The Democratic money is surprisingly (surprising to me, anyway) well-dispersed. I think it helps Democrats that their House candidates are relatively anonymous, instead of a few cause célèbres soaking up all the money.
@LPDonovan We're looking at individual contributions through the most recent filing deadline (June 30, in most cases) on a race-by-race basis, using the candidates who have been nominated (or who we project to be nominated) in each district.
Now, it's probably *also* not great to be a Democratic incumbent. But Dem incumbents very have little exposure on the House side. On the *Senate* side, though:😬 That's why I don't think it's crazy to think Dems could make very big gains in the House, but lose a Senate seat or 2.
Ordinarily, as an incumbent, you at least tend to raise more $ than your opponent even if other things go wrong. And sometimes the other party nominates a random weirdo. But many GOP incumbents are getting outraised this year. And the Dem nominees are mostly pretty competent.
This goes broader than just fundraising too. One theme that emerges from the data is that: it's really not that much of a benefit to be a Republican incumbent. You have to defend Trump. You have to defend unpopular votes on the Ryan agenda (e.g. ACA). Congress is super unpopular. https://t.co/kRXGlenCgP
It's fairly broad-based, too. Of the 73 districts with a 538 PVI of between D+10 and R+10—those are the seats that change hands most often over the long run—the Democratic nominee has raised more in 59 districts, the Republican in just 14.
Democratic nominees are outraising Republican nominees ~2:1 in open-seat races . They're actually slightly outraising the GOP in competitive races with GOP **incumbents**, which is pretty unusual.
The single most favorable indicator for Democrats, in terms of their chances of taking over the House, is fundraising. Specifically, individual contributions to individual candidates, which tends to be the most important/predictive measure of electoral success.
@ForecasterEnten We're getting into pretty technical territory here, but what I've found is that is that under the top 2 system, WA &amp; CA primary results provide essentially no information about the macro environment *that you can't glean from other indicators* like the generic ballot.
@ForecasterEnten I'm pretty sure 2008 was the first year in WA? Then 2012 in CA?
@ForecasterEnten There's not really enough history to know which direction (if any) the primary vote might be biased in. However, it's a very good predictor of the *relative* competitiveness of different districts.
Trump was about as different as it gets from Obama, who was about as different as it gets from Bush 43, who ran on a values platform to contrast himself with Clinton, who was about as different as it gets from Bush 41.

@mckaycoppins Yeah, I've found that a lot of the time when you're stymied in the writing process, it doesn't reflect a lack of willpower but that your brain needs more processing time to sort through a knotty problem with your thesis. Sleep helps. Going for a nice long walk/drive can help too.
@mckaycoppins The key IMO is that if you're "in the zone", you *have* to keep writing, even if it means wasting the next day. But if you're not feeling it, call it a night rather than forcing it.

The level of policy expertise isn't great in Congress. And everyone says some dumb shit in long, extemporaneous interviews. Pick one of the random 435 members of the House out of a hat, have them do TV several times a week, and you'll see much worse.
I don't know, I watch these clips where Ocasio-Cortez is supposedly making huge gaffes and it seems like her policy knowledge is...probably about on par with or maybe a bit ahead of the average member of Congress.
But NY-27 is very Trumpy, and Collins had won by big margins before, so he has a lot of rope to hang himself with. I'd classify the race as "Lean Republican" (and closer to "Likely Republican" than "Tossup") but would love to see some polls and fundraising data in a few weeks.
"If they make it to the general election" is a key phrase, because there's a survivorship bias issue in this data—really big scandals often trigger resignations or primary losses. But in this case the GOP may not have a way to get Collins off the ballot even if things gets worse.
Here's more detail on what happens to scandal-plagued incumbents like Chris Collins. On average, scandals cost incumbents a net of 9 percentage points if they make it to the general election. And it's been more than that—13 points—in competitive districts. https://t.co/eSy488ybNY

On the other hand, McMorris Rodgers is barely ahead of *one* Democratic opponent in WA-5. That's a potential disaster for the GOP.
e.g. in WA-8, Republicans are losing the aggregate popular vote by ~3 points. But Rossi (R) leads his nearest Democratic rival by 24 points. That's actually not too bad for the GOP overall.
In analyzing top-two primary results from California or Washington, there's value in looking both at the aggregate party shares and in the winning candidate's margin.
Based on research using @baseballot's scandals dataset, I've found that a scandal costs a House candidate somewhere on the order of 10-12 percentage points of vote margin. It's a pretty significant effect. And this scandal is perhaps on the more severe side.
Chris Collins's district, NY-27, is really *quite* red, surprisingly so for New York state, but not so red that Democrats don't have a shot there against a guy just arrested by the FBI. The Democratic candidate in NY-27 is Nate McMurray, the town supervisor of Grand Island.
The polls have mostly been very accurate in the 2017/18 cycle so far—and when they've missed, they've lowballed Democrats, not Republicans. https://t.co/tBrVTRYiDI
My second-favorite prerequisite (late-night food is the most reliable/important) for a great city is: If you were unexpectedly teleported to a random intersection within the city, could you correctly determine within ~30 seconds which city you were in?
@EsotericCD Chicago definitely qualifies. The various taco/burrito joints are bumping at 2/3 in the morning. Also gets credit for Au Cheval serving burgers past midnight.
"Can you get good food after midnight?" is basically a prerequisite to "are you a world-class city?" IMO. https://t.co/u9SZAQBfoH
* Maybe not "from" there but launched his career on the Overland Park city council. Anyway, I've spent some time in Johnson Co. and it doesn't seem very Kobach-y to me. But, results are liable to vary a fair bit from town to town and not sure where the vote is in from so far.
