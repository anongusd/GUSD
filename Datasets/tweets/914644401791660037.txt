With this, everyone won. These young people could make a bit of money, it didn't cost a lot to the theater to provide the income. Over time these kids could learn more tasks and move up to higher paying jobs at the theater.		Minimum wage destroyed this opportunity.
While they weren't capable of offering much value to the company, they were still hired on to help people find there seats. Obviously this job wasn't needed by the movie theater, so they could offer such a small wage (something like $0.10/hr).....

@pearsonstephenm @darinp2 @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec The wording suggests otherwise. 		"All persons born ... in the US, and subject to the jurisdiction...

@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec He goes on to say that a citizen isn't very well defined.		Well either way, trick or treaters are showing up so I'm done for the evening.		Thanks again for the conversation.
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec I see how this discussion continues for 100 years
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Reading Sen. Howard's Speech, Philadelphia Inquirer, 1866, "The first clause of this section relates to the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States as such, and as distinguished from all other persons who are not citizens of the United States."
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Wouldn't it be handled differently if they were here legally vs illegally?
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec I'm still a bit confused, but I appreciate your patience with me.		Going back to the Japan example, if someone from Japan came into the US on vacation and gave birth while here, would that make their child a US citizen or a Japanese citizen?
@SquatsAndMemes @hscottpalmer @KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec I think that's the clarification I needed. Thank you.
@kl_bradshaw @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec If you want to continue discussion you'll need to be more clear.
@Euqinomist @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Yes, as applied to everything except receiving automatic US citizenship, which is the topic of discussion.		We aren't talking about criminal acts.
@kl_bradshaw @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Believe what you want, but you know many people do think this way so why not shed some light on it?
@hscottpalmer @KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec If nothing moved, how did we go from new births and automatic US citizenship to committing crimes in Japan?
@SpeedRiver_ @ScottyPeligro @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec If I am, I wouldn't be surprised, but this seems pretty clear. First sentance of the 14th amendment mentions jurisdiction as applied to all persons born in the US.		Committing crimes is handled elsewhere.		These are two separate issues.
@kl_bradshaw @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec There is also a pile of extra explanations about why the wording here became what it is by the very people who wrote it, which clarifies all doubt entirely.
@SpeedRiver_ @ScottyPeligro @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Many are confused here, but the goal posts seem to have moved.		Original point was on one specific thing; how the US gives automatic citizenship to new births.		Now it seems to be all about any law there ever was in variously named countries, which doesn't apply here.
@kl_bradshaw @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Sad day when quoting the Constitution is considered "worst argument".
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec We aren't even talking about committing a crime, so you are moving goal posts.		We are talking of new births in the US, and how we apply automatic citizenship. That's it.
@robertwoolley @KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Covers*
@robertwoolley @KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Yes. This is about newborns, not every law that ever was. It clearly converts one thing, just one thing - the birth of an individual.
@YukioMX @robertwoolley @KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec *working
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Yes. That's Japans laws. We're talking about this law, the 14th amendment, in the US, as applied to newborns. Not some entirely different thing in a different country, but a very specific US law.
@ScottyPeligro @SpeedRiver_ @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Are you here illegally?
@KevinMarcou @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec If you are there legally, then yes, of course.
@darinp2 @rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec Good question. That particular quote is not in the ammendment itself, but from a sponsor of it in a statement of clarification.		The amendment does say it in a rather efficient way. If you aren't subject to the jurisdiction of the US, it's because you are an alien or foreigner.
@steve_durnan @Terrenc86055834 @JackPosobiec It definitely applies to Native Americans. That's how they were allowed to maintain their sovereignty.
@rmsteinborn @JackPosobiec It does specify, and does so deliberately.		"...and subject to the jurisdiction thereof..."		Non citizens are subject to their country of citizenship.
@semiretired46 @MWBoJr @DionnaSamuel @CougarPride310 @HISTORY "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens..."		Further writings by the authors clarified this stance.
@RepRobinKelly You have to consider the Constitution as well as court decisions. It would also help to read the background thoughts from those who wrote the amendment in question. 		The important part, "and subject to the jurisdiction thereof"		Illegal/undocumented people aren't subject to this

@eabarlin @real_farmacist @EverettDoreen @Comey As long as we're going anecdotal, I'll say that proof is the one thing that'll change the minds of many. 		The other side of the coin is also true; even if the FBI proves Kavanaugh's innocence there will still be those that believe he is guilty.		Biased thinking fails us all.
@bagleason @RespectableLaw Just about every Democrat did. This is after Kavanaugh already said he would welcome any kind of investigation, FBI or otherwise.		But they wanted more.

I wonder who twitter decides I'll follow in the next few months
A lot of them felt like okay, well maybe I wasn't thinking straight, or for awhile I was following comedians, too, but there were a few I will not name, that I know I did not choose to follow.		It seems twitter really doesn't need me for my twitter account.
Tonight I decided to clean up who I follow. I want to hear directly from the source, so members of govt, official govt accounts and even then only the verified ones.		While unfollowing all the news outlets and editors I found that I was following people I genuinely don't care to.
Makes me wonder how many have been added since. How many of those from January 2010 are still active?

@WilliamYounger3 @KevinKlussier @kaitlancollins @JudicialWatch Her due process was going through the motions. I would have liked a proper investigation. I stay neutral, always. Destruction of evidence is rarely, if ever, a sign of innocence.
@WilliamYounger3 @KevinKlussier @kaitlancollins That whole ordeal was sketchy at best. FBI closing the case before they had looked through all the evidence, @JudicialWatch forcing the FBI to admit they had more evidence than they claimed, failing to preserve evidence, and admitting she broke the law but somehow it didn't count
@KevinKlussier @stefanodipeduci @kaitlancollins While I do agree, I also worry that doing so makes it entirely too easy to remove political opponents.
@jacklgoldsmith Why wasn't a no-knock raid called for on this investigation?
@stefanodipeduci @KevinKlussier @kaitlancollins My point is that we should not take accusations the same as a guilty verdict.
@stefanodipeduci @KevinKlussier @kaitlancollins In reference to, "they won’t mind us seating a child molester"
