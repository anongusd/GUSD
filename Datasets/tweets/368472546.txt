Please join me as I work for New Mexico as the 32nd Governor at @GovMLG 	#nmpol
The unlimited promise of this magnificent state is ours to achieve. It is time for us to thrive. Viva New Mexico! #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
We’re not here to celebrate a political victory but to remind ourselves a victory is only as good as the work ethic of the victors. We’re not here as members of a winning party but as New Mexicans with our sleeves rolled up. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
That means not just raising the cap, but eliminating it and paying the backlog promptly. We will send a clear signal that we are open for business and will double film and television production in coming years. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
With @netflix in Albuquerque and moviemakers in California recognizing our world-class crew base and brilliantly talented homegrown writers, performers and filmmakers, we will take off the shackles and let it rip — and in the process we will put New Mexicans to work. #nmpol
Our film industry can be the greatest and most lucrative state media business in the entire country. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
On the campaign trail, you might’ve heard us talk about a moonshot — a moonshot for our state’s public education. Well, there’s only one way there.		Aim high. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
Together we will find the courage to create the promise of that tomorrow for our children and their children. We will have the core strength to stay the course and stand as one when our resolve is challenged. We will go big. Really big. Together. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
And, most importantly, I want to thank you all. Standing before you today is an honor and a privilege so far beyond what any one person can articulate. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM
I am humbled to be in the presence of so many incredible leaders, who have chosen to join me on stage today. #nmpol #ImagineAThrivingNM

As gov, I'll instruct PED to undertake a brand new disciplinary program that is fair and is not directed at one set of students over another. When we start to address these problems in our schools, we will begin to change racial injustice and inequality in NM. #nmpol #NMGovDebate

It's crucial that the next governor has a diverse cabinet full of individuals who are dedicated to serving their community &amp; their constituents. If you don't have a diverse cabinet, you are less likely to have the collaborative effort that makes a difference. #nmpol #NMGovDebate
When you diminish the budgets of our health centers and community centers, you diminish a community's opportunity. As governor, I'll be a leader that honors the value of investments like the African American Community Arts Center and so many others. #nmpol #NMGovDebate
We must do everything we can to eliminate hazing, hate crimes, and bullying. I would be proud to sign legislation that fights discrimination and hatred as Governor of New Mexico. #nmpol #NMGovDebate

I know firsthand what happens when New Mexicans don’t get the care that they need. That’s why I will be the kind of governor who fights for each New Mexican’s right to healthcare like it’s my own. #nmpol #TeamMichelle
We must make all of the DD programs and waiver a priority. We must restructure the way in which we deliver services so we have a responsible service structure for all New Mexicans. #nmpol #TeamMichelle
The waiting list that New Mexico families are subjected to on the Developmental Disability Waiver is unacceptable. I was motivated as Sec of Health and I will be motivated as gov to eliminate these wait times. #nmpol #TeamMichelle
We need to make sure that school based health centers are in every school so we are treating both behavioral and mental health before tragedies like Parkland and Aztec do not happen again. Protecting our kids should be our #1 priority. #nmpol #TeamMichelle
Experience matters: when I was head of Aging and Health, we built one of the best aging networks and long term care systems in the country. New Mexicans deserve a gov who knows how to get things done — and my record shows just that. #NM ppl #TeamMichelle

Together we will build a New Mexico worthy of our past and ready for all our tomorrows. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
You can go to my website https://t.co/wkHNLOlX2o to learn how to make a difference. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
I will work every day of this campaign to earn your trust, your support and your vote. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
We can do this and I’ve been humbled by those of you who have asked me to run for governor. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
We need to harness that potential and bring people together to achieve real and lasting change. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
#NM is a place of enormous potential – in our economy, our schools, our people and our culture. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
But to take on this challenge of turning our state around, I need your help. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
When it comes to standing up for people, I’ll never stop fighting and I never give up. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
I’ve dedicated my life to bringing change to New Mexico. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
We won’t solve our problems overnight.  It’s why this is a beginning. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
This is a new beginning for #NM. New Mexicans are strong and resilient. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
After years of being pushed backward, it’s no wonder why so many have given up on our government. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
For the last 6 years, we’ve had a governor who refused to acknowledge the problems even exist. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
There are far too many seniors and families who feel left behind by the failed policies of the last six years #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
I am prepared to face the challenges in #NM – unemployment, struggling schools, persistent poverty. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
I’m proud to announce the beginning of my campaign for Governor of New Mexico. #AlwaysNM #NM4Michelle #nmpol
