This push towards open borders &amp; continuing "catch and release" is the exact opposite of what is needed to protect our great nation, secure our borders &amp; enforce our laws. There should be only 1 acceptable way to enter the US &amp; that is to respect &amp; obey our laws &amp; enter legally.
Congressional Dems are calling for the abolishment of @ICEgov. This is a horrendous idea. I strongly support our great ICE agents who risk their own personal safety every single day to serve the USA and our rule of law.
Our national security is going great. Our economy is doing well. Unemployment is hitting historic lows. Our markets are hitting historic highs. ISIS is nearly wiped off the map. MS-13 is being defeated and our borders are being better secured. I call it all "Just a start"

In the meantime, my advice for anyone who doesn’t want to be detained for entering into the United States illegally to not enter the United States illegally.
On a related note, it really is quite amazing how many of the people upset about 2k separations under Pres Trump said nothing about 72k separations in 2013 under Pres Obama. Regardless, the Flores Settlement requires a change in law &amp; I’m all for getting that done ASAP.
I also believe that it would be wrong to detain the children in cages like the Obama admin did. That was a horrible policy. I support appropriately detaining the entire family together. This will require a change in law &amp; I would support that.
It’s not good policy to separate children at our border from their parents &amp; release them into the US as UACs. It’s also not good policy to just immediately release an entire family together into the US when that family enters our country illegally.

Just imagine how much more of an issue this all will be 10 or 20 yrs from now if we don't do a better job confronting this fiscal cliff today. What is even worse is that apparently my observation/position is considered too "extreme".
Our gov't cannot afford to continue increasing spending at these rates. It's unsustainable. I had no choice but to vote NO on Fri's budget deal. Deficits &amp; debts will only continue to grow &amp; our hole will only sink deeper until we get serious about being better stewards w tax $.

Truth. Several mths ago, House passed funding for entire year. No need for CR. Senate should just have up or down simple majority (51 instead of 60) vote on funding for rest of fiscal year. At this pt, this is necessary for good of country &amp; to open govt despite Dems objection. https://t.co/JI0QpSDKPD

Sending love from the over 700,000 residents of NY-1 to the great patriots past &amp; present in VA-5. #Charlottesville https://t.co/9NU74hFIYh
Quite candidly, every day should be the perfect day to be an American first. United. #Charlottesville
This isn't a day to be left or right, liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat. This is a day to be an American. 1/2
For any of the #Charlottesville protesters on either side w extremist views &amp; violent purposes, you are 100% completely in the wrong.
For the protesters w pure, good, genuine &amp; peaceful purposes, it is very important you were brave enough to be there to lend your voice.
Associating w the KKK &amp; Nazism is associating w hatred, bigotry, racism, intolerance &amp; a tremendously inhumane past filled w horrible evil.
There must be zero tolerance whatsoever for the extremes that attempt to tear us all apart. #Charlottesville
We all can do more to come together as a nation united in the cause of freedom &amp; whenever possible, bridging the gaps that exist between us
