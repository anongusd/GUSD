Trump and the GOP are simply not willing work on real immigration reform. They're too committed using immigrants as a political football to inflame and divide. 		There's no way for Democrats to compromise with that position, and it's up to us to stand up for immigrants 110%.
Let's remember that Big Oil poured $31 million into opposing @yeson1631. The carbon fee on big polluters is a damn good idea, and the largest oil companies pulled out all the stops to defeat it.
In this election, we saw voters who make between $50-100K sifting left. 		Min. wage increases passed in Missouri and Arkansas.		Medicaid expansion passed in Republican states.		The GOP agenda isn't resonating and they're delivering gains for the wealthy, not working people.

Here's the thing: we shouldn't have to choose between investigating the Trump administration and working to pass these bipartisan bills. The answer isn't either/or. We need to uphold the Constitution AND we need to keep fighting #ForThePeople. That's the job of Congress.
At the same time, there are bipartisan issues that I believe we can pass in the House and Senate. Issues such as lower prescription drug prices and a federally funded infrastructure bill that invests in our jobs and our economy. And, hopefully, a clean DREAM Act.
By taking back the House, now we will have the gavel and opportunity to see documents and set hearings to assess whether or not this president and his administration are violating the Constitution. Americans are sick and tired of all of the corruption. https://t.co/VgYk3uxeNC

Every day, we will continue building on this momentum and lifting up new ideas and policies that will increase the economic security of working families, provide health care to every American, and recommit our country to fulfill its promise for justice and progress for all.
Although we (narrowly) lost a few elections that we really wanted to win, we were told that we should never even hope to make it a close race! I'll tell you one thing: we'll continue to fight for our values in every state, in every county, because working families deserve better.
For the first time ever, at least 100 women will serve in the U.S. Congress, including so many women of color! We won key governorships to help us tackle gerrymandering and other important state issues. And oh by the way, I still serve on the House Judiciary Committee!
Last night, we accomplished a resounding victory: The American people voted to put Democrats back in control of the U.S. House, to control the legislative agenda and to fight against this administration's destructive policies, corruption, and injustice.
Together, we built an amazing grassroots movement that knocked on 34,500 doors, made more than 100,000 phone calls, and organized over 1,050 volunteers to elect progressive candidates in Washington state and across the nation.
I am so honored to have earned the decisive support of Washington‚Äôs 7th District once again, to return to Congress and stand up for the values of this progressive and hope-filled district. Thank you to everyone who helped us win!

End/ Let‚Äôs let our determination erupt like a volcano, let‚Äôs rise up to the polls, one vote at a time, and let‚Äôs rebuild our country‚Äîtogether.
33/ It was Ella Baker who said that we who believe in freedom can never rest.	 	We can never rest in our fight for generosity and abundance, not scarcity and fear. We can never rest talking about LOVE, because love does trump hate and Love does win every time.
32/ If we do this‚Äîif we turn out in flocks and elect strong Democrats everywhere, if we elect women and immigrants and people of color that represent the diversity that makes the Democratic party so powerful, then we WILL win.
31/ In a little more than a month, we have a historic opportunity to lay the ground work for that BOLD vision. Starting right here in Iowa, we need to fight tooth and nail to elect bold leaders to school boards and state legislatures across the country.
30/ And for anyone who thinks these ideas and this vision are too bold, too idealistic, too impractical, I say back to you:  Who in the world has ever done big things by thinking small?	  	We were not born for small thinking and no big problem can be solved with a small solution.
29/ a country that says YES to humane immigration reform because we know we are great BECAUSE of our diversity, because we have always held out a hope for people from all over the world‚Äîwhite, black and brown‚Äîto come here and build a better life and a more perfect union.
28/ a country that says let‚Äôs get money out of politics, let‚Äôs stop the corruption and the greed that is overtaking our country‚Äîthat‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt take any corporate PAC money and more and more candidates are joining us in refusing corporate PAC money!;
27/ a country that says to our kids we BELIEVE in you, and we will make SURE that college is available to everyone without mountains of debt that would cripple any future;
26/ a country that fights for environmental justice and against climate change, so that we all have clean air and clean water and we sustain this planet we love for future generations;
25/ a country that believes in fair trade not free trade, that fights for workers, and says if you work 40 hours a week, you should earn a LIVING wage;
24/ a country that fights for Medicare for All, because healthcare should not be reserved only for the rich but should be the foundation on which every life is built;
23/ My PROPOSITION agenda includes: a country that expands social security, which is an EARNED benefit program that showcases the best of all of us taking care of all of us;
22/ Winning takes all of us: urban and rural, white, black and brown, gay and straight, old and young, men and women. 	 	Winning demands that we‚Äôre not just an OPPOSITION party, but a PROPOSITION party that paints a vision of the country we want to create.
21/ Here‚Äôs the thing about failure: it can be our alarm clock. As an organizer, I know that strength emerges in crisis. Across the country, folks have realized that you have to work hard at democracy every single day. If you don‚Äôt use your vote, someone will use it against you.
20/ We failed because we didn‚Äôt demand more from those we elect:  not just to vote the right way when pushed, but to LEAD our conversations on tough issues. Not to vote for something even when you know it is wrong, and yes, not to vote because you were given money to do so.
19/ In the end, what is so damaging today is not just the horrible policies that pour out of the White House but the shattering of NORMS, of human decency, of a belief in compassion, of right and wrong.	 	And as difficult as it is to hear this, the reality is that WE failed.
18/ It is a victory, and brothers and sisters, we must let that victory fill our tired souls up, and then continue to demand a new nominee who brings even an ounce of humility and a pound of wisdom to what is one of the most consequential jobs of this democracy. This is NOT over!
17/ And yet‚Äîin the midst of this crisis, after thousands of women protested and were arrested, men and women made phone calls and organized and mobilized, we have a temporary reprieve, a week for a real FBI investigation, and perhaps a re-evaluation of Brett Kavanaugh.
16/ The belligerent, entitled stonewalling of a nominee who showed his true colors does not have the temperament to be on the Supreme Court. The possibility that 11 GOP male Senators May pass this nominee who has at best misled and at worst committed perjury felt like a new low.
15/ But if you are like me, these past weeks have taken us to a new low. The horror of a Supreme Court nomination that was being jammed through in the wake of sexual assault allegations from a remarkably, courageous, compelling Christine Blasey Ford.
14/ And there is a real threat that this President, under investigation for obstruction of justice, will do everything he can to stop the Mueller investigation as it gets closer and closer to him‚Äîand that Republicans will not have the backbone to stand up for our country.
13/ Trump did not emerge out of nowhere. This economic insecurity that has been building for some decades has led to a gaping hole, a hole that is now being filled by white supremacists, racists and corrupt swampers who promise one thing but do the exact opposite.
12/ American families know that their lives have not gotten better. They are working two or three jobs instead of one, their wages have stagnated and they buy less with every paycheck, and they always fear being one healthcare crisis away from bankruptcy.
11/ Although pundits like to say that we are in a period of wild economic growth with GDP growing mightily, the American people aren‚Äôt fooled.  The truth is that GDP growth doesn‚Äôt mean a darn thing when 90% of it goes to the top 1%, as is true today.
10/ The three richest people in the country‚Äîtwo of whom live in my state‚Äîhave more wealth than the bottom 50%. 	 	Let me say that again differently:  three people in America hold more wealth together than 160 million people.
9/ Parents wonder how they will take days off of work to look after their sick children when they have no paid sick leave. Young people decide not to get a higher education at a 2- or 4-year college because even a public education today leaves our young people $50k in debt.
8/ Today in America, 62% of people do not even have $1,000 in their bank account.  That means families across America go to sleep at night wondering how they will pay for a car that has broken down, a roof that is leaking or a parent who has fallen ill.
7/ After decades of organizing on the outside, I realized our policies would be better, our democracy would be stronger if we had more organizers in Congress, more women, more people of color, more immigrants who come FROM the movement and can use this platform to organize.
6/ None of that is true.	 	I am a beneficiary of the amazing American Dream. In 1982, I came to the U.S. for the first time, at 16 years old, by myself. Today, I am  the first South Asian American woman in the US House and one of 67 women of color to EVER serve in Congress.
5/ It‚Äôs important to remember that at a time when the White House and Fox News are trying to somehow tell us we are so different because of the color of our skin, the God we pray to, the person we love, or the country in which we were born, we need to fear each other.
4/ There is so much more that unites us than divides us. We all want the same thing for ourselves and our families:  food on the table, a roof over our heads, the ability to send our kids to college without mountains of debt, and dignity and security as we age and retire.
3/ Here in Iowa, I experienced the generosity of the heartland and the bounty of the farmland.	 	The people we met were people who sat side by side with immigrants in church, and knew that immigrants were helping to build‚Äînot detract from‚Äîa new Iowa that had a place for everyone.
2/ Our goal was to remind America of our history and of our future, to tell the stories of remarkable immigrants who have built our country, and to build the momentum to pass immigration reform that would bring 11 million people out of the shadows and reunite our families.
1/ Thank you @polkdems ‚Äîit is so great to be back in Iowa! The first time I came to Iowa was in 2003 when I was co-chairing the Washington State Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride coalition. https://t.co/z0Z8XaxBFV

Practicing love is key to nonviolence. Nonviolence is dialogue in action, and encompasses respect, reverence and trust in life, in connection with one another.
Understanding the use of power requires understanding of violence:  Violence is not just done by a fist or a gun or hitting, but done by economic structures, systemic power, structural power
Courage, Truth and Love are critical ingredients to successful nonviolent civil disobedience.

The #PeoplesBudget closes loopholes that hurt the American worker and creates jobs at home by investing in our crumbling infrastructure. It reflects our promise to keep fighting for the American people. We won't back down.
This #PeoplesBudget says NO to an $18B border wall and NO to funding this broken immigration system that puts children in cages. This budget says YES to protecting our climate and ensuring clean air and water for our families across the nation.
Today, the @USProgressives released our 2019 #PeoplesBudget. As first vice chair, I am committed to a budget that aligns with our nation's values by putting people - families and communities - first.

Women across this country are WINNING, VOTING and SPEAKING OUT.  Women across this country are refusing to be minimized or patronized. And women of color, young people and LGBTQ folks are running and winning for office‚Äîeven in places where it seems impossible.
It was black woman Tarana Burke who founded #MeToo and the women at the National Women‚Äôs Law Center who created #TimesUp. It was domestic and farmworker women who've rallied against abuse. Millions of women the world over organized the first and second @Womensmarch.
We have seen what happens when we claim our power‚Äîwe make change. It was the 98 percent of black women voters in Alabama who are responsible for Democratic Senator Doug Jones‚Äô victory.
I never thought I would run for office, but after decades of trying to get other people to do the things that our communities needed, I realized that we organizers, women, and immigrants were ceding very important political space by not running for office ourselves.

Understand that my liberation is tied up with yours and that nobody wins unless we all win. Understand that hope is not na√Øve. I'm so excited and looking forward to representing this district for another term.
I‚Äôm prepping for my PROPOSITION agenda when we take control:		Medicare for ALL‚Ää		Dignity for detained Immigrants Act		College for All		Gun Reform		Democracy Reform		Expanding social security by scrapping the cap		Investing $2 trillion in green infrastructure		Net neutrality
We have to win back the majority in the House, and if we do our part in the 8th, 5th, and 3rd Districts in Washington we can win that majority. I‚Äôm supporting real progressives, women, folks of color across the country.
Our work is broad and deep. It goes to making sure I prioritize diversity in my offices and I‚Äôm so proud that I have one of the most diverse offices in Congress. We don‚Äôt have to steer away from race, we do better when we name it, introduce it and talk about it.
As I said when I first ran, this has never been about ME, it has always been about WE. And that‚Äôs why I am so fierce when people try to put me down‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause, you see, when they do that, they are putting everyone in our district down.
I believed that after 15 years of being an activist, that it was time to take over the platform of elected. Why should we just advocate to elected officials? We should BE elected officials ourselves, bring OUR voices into the system, changing it from within and without.
I ran for office because I believe something else is possible. Our opening is connection. Connecting women to race, race to climate, climate to jobs, jobs to choices around our own bodies.
We must lift up the center of America‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe people whose work sustains us, grows our economy, and takes care of those who cannot work. The teacher who spends more time with our children than any other but hasn‚Äôt been compensated for that.
Failure has taught us that we must reject the false choices, that as proud as I am to be a progressive, that the ideas we stand for as progressives are really ideas for working people, ideas that are ‚Äúcentrist‚Äù in that they serve the center of our society‚Ää.
Failure is sometimes necessary to awaken us. Failure, if we use it correctly, can be our alarm clock. To dig ourselves from out of this hole, we must engage differently.
We failed because we didn‚Äôt insist often enough and loudly enough, and organize deeply enough to show that the false choices we are presented with every day are wrong, immoral and not really a choice at all.
We allowed corporations and the wealthiest to convince us that our voices don‚Äôt matter and the system is too corrupt to make a difference‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand so we stop engaging, voting, even caring.
Still, we are where we are today because we failed. We failed because we gave away our power. And there are lessons to learn from failure and things that happen out of failure that help us to move forward, but first we have to name that we failed.
I love helping our district. My office has helped 752 people - veterans, seniors, and others who needed assistance with federal agencies - recover more than $600,000 in due benefits. 		I‚Äôve had 16 in-person and telephone town halls in 15 months talking to over 15,000 people.
Here's why I'm running for re-election. 		As horrible as the news is every day, I LOVE this job. I love bringing my immigrant woman of color voice to the conversations at this consequential moment in our country‚Äôs history. https://t.co/6UJV1UvOlp

Let's keep in mind the basic formula for momentum: Momentum equals mass times velocity. 		We have the masses out here‚Äîand we have to stay out in the streets. Then, let‚Äôs hit the ground running with VELOCITY to get to November with a massive blue wave at the polls.
So our work is clear. ¬†And as grim as the situation is, I have never been more hopeful because of YOU. From the women‚Äôs march to the #MarchForOurLives to today‚Äôs tax marches and #MarchForScience we are growing the movement that will turn out in November to take back our country.

This is catastrophic. The Paris accords are meant to stop global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees celsiu, but to get anywhere near that goal, according to researchers, we need to cutting emissions NOW ‚Äì peaking in 2020 and decreasing afterward.
Start with climate change. The president and many in the GOP say it‚Äôs a hoax. Trump withdrew our country from Paris Climate Accords. The Dept. of Interior removed climate change from its strategic plan. They revoked President Obama‚Äôs Clean Power Plan, exposing us to pollution.
We‚Äôre going to continue to advance science here in the 7th District, no matter what. But this is a grim time for science‚Äîand it is not just Donald Trump and his Cabinet, it is all the Republicans who implement an agenda that only benefits  corporations and the wealthiest.

No more shootings in schools; no more shootings in places of worship; no more shootings in our streets; no more mass shootings; NO MORE SHOOTINGS, period.
I want you to know that I am ready. I am ready to stand alongside you and do everything in my power to help grow this movement and demand that we pass meaningful gun control legislation.
My heart goes out to the families who lost people in gun violence and I am proud to stand alongside the incredible young people who are demanding justice and action for their friends and teachers. I have been so deeply inspired by the way sorrow has turned into determination.
We should think about how we turn the push to violence in our society back, through non-violent resistance/compassion. Like nonviolent civil disobedience and economic boycotts where we hit the NRA in their pocketbook and use our consumer dollars to hold all companies accountable
The rise in gun violence, and the rise of the NRA lobby, are part of a growing culture that has forgotten that our responsibility is to take care of each other and not to money, or greed.
To Emma, to the other Parkland students who are so eloquent and vocal, to all of you who are part of this incredible movement, thank you.  This is no longer a movement even just about mass shootings‚Äîit is about gun violence, gun deaths, and gun reform.

In the words of @Emma4Change , one of the student survivors of the Parkland shooting:  ‚ÄúPoliticians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS. 1/
In solidarity, I marched with thousands of kids in the other Washington as they demanded Congress take action to address this issue. The students of this country are calling it out, loud and clear, and speaking truth to power.
But there is hope.  For the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful.  And it‚Äôs because of the students.  This past Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of students‚Äîincluding many of you here at Garfield High School‚Äîmarched the in the streets to make your voices heard.
Every time we get close, every time some Republican leader‚Äîincluding Trump‚Äî says something that recognizes that the ONLY common denominator in all of this is the GUNS, the NRA goes to pay them a little visit and then lo and behold, those leaders back away and with no legislation
From Newtown to Vegas, from Sutherland Springs to Marjory Stoneman, Republicans have refused to bring forward legislation on background checks, or banning bump stocks, or closing gun loopholes, or banning assault rifles and high capacity magazines.
It is not insensitive to tell the truth and call BS. It IS outrageous that the gun lobby has elected officials refusing to treat this as the public health crisis that it is, and refusing to put money from the NRA ahead of children‚Äôs lives.		#NeverAgain
Instead, Paul Ryan comes to the podium of the House floor and calls for a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting.  Republican colleagues who accept NRA money take to the floor to offer thoughts and prayers, and then go hide their heads in the sand on doing anything.
Republican and Democratic voters both want to see kids go to school and live to come home. And this year, I‚Äôm proud of Democrats in the state legislature for making us the most recent state to ban bump stocks.  But we have so much more to do. 		We need Congress to act.
Both passed with universal support across the state because the voters of Washington state know what Republicans in Congress do not seem to know:  this is a BIPARTISAN issue.  Republican and Democratic voters both want an end to gun violence.
I‚Äôm proud of WA voters who DID pass background checks by ballot initiative in a hard-won fight in 2014 and then went on in 2016 to pass another ballot initiative around extreme risk protection orders. There is now a process to keep guns out of the hands of those who are a risk.
My committee, the House Judiciary Committee, is supposed to have jurisdiction over this issue but guess how many hearings on gun safety bills we have had in the committee? 		Exactly 0.
There are more deaths from gun violence than from terrorism and while we spend trillions of dollars and pass numerous laws on fighting terrorism, we do NOTHING on gun violence.
They never intended that there were be no legislation that ensured that one person‚Äôs right to bear arms would not infringe on another‚Äôs right to live.  Even NRA members understand the need for gun legislation‚Äî87% of gun owners and 74% of NRA members support commonsense solutions.
One of the Parkland students said so beautifully at the rally at the Capitol a few days ago‚Äîyour right to carry a gun does not outweigh our right to live. 		Our founders knew that with rights come responsibilities.
We‚Äôre turning schools into drill centers for mass shootings, while politicians hide behind mental illness and the 2nd Amendment‚Äî it says nothing about the right to carry an AR15 or have high capacity magazines that could fire hundreds of bullets at a time to massacre people.
Our people are dying.		Kids are going to school and wondering if they will have to cower in a corner because of someone with a gun.
Our country today has almost as many guns as we have people.  That‚Äôs 265 million guns across the country‚Äîand that‚Äôs the low estimate.		Imagine that.
In 2016, according to EveryTown for Gun Safety, there were over 37,000 gun homicides and suicides.  37,000.  And yes, it is also absolutely true that black folks are far more likely to face gun violence that white folks.
And it‚Äôs not just children.  Across the country‚Äîfrom mass shootings to gun violence in communities‚Äîpeople are losing their lives because our society has refused to ACT. #EndGunViolence
Since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, 7,000 children have lost their lives as a result of gun violence. 7,000.  7,000 children senselessly robbed:  of birthdays, of futures, of their RIGHT to grow up.
It is creating a strength powered by our kids who are speaking in voices true and clear and forcing people to make their choice of which side of history and which side of justice they will stand on.
So, as a lifelong organizer myself, what I know to be true is that strength emerges in times of crisis. And this crisis of gun violence that is taking away lives every day has finally brought forward a different kind of strength.
14 years later, I ran for elected office because I became convinced that to make the kind of change we want, we need more organizers grounded in the movement for justice to be in elected office.
I and others stood up to fight back and together with labor unions, faith organizations, young people and immigrants of all background, built a movement to take on that xenophobia, racism and hatred‚Äîa fight that is ever more important today.
At that moment, when there was hyper patriotism and the country was lurching toward war and we saw the beginning of some of the worst immigrant blaming and bashing.
I am a lifelong organizer.  As many of you know, I started and led for 12 years the immigrant rights organization called OneAmerica after 9/11, when very few people were with us on standing up for Muslims, immigrants, Dreamers or comprehensive immigration reform.
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs easy, and I know that winning on critical, consequential issues is incredibly difficult because the forces against us are huge. The forces of political corruption, of money in politics, of a gun lobby and politicians who are morally bankrupt on this issue.
Because for the first time in a long time, you can feel the possibility that the tide will turn, that PERHAPS our students across the country who refuse to be silenced will be able to help us build a more powerful movement that gets us real gun control.
And let‚Äôs be very, very clear.  NRA lobbyists have controlled politics for far too long and politicians across the country have allowed themselves to be controlled, abdicating their solemn responsibility to pass gun reform legislation.	That‚Äôs why this moment is so important.
I do not take campaign contributions from the NRA.  I will never take campaign contributions from the NRA. I don‚Äôt take ANY corporate PAC contributions because I don't believe that we should make policy based on which corporations give us money.  It‚Äôs just that simple.
I want to thank Moms Demand Action, Grandmas Against Gun Violence and the Gun Alliance for the fight you have been undertaking for so long‚Äîwe deeply appreciate it.
I know all of you are deeply concerned about our communities, our schools, our safety.  Thank you for making your voices heard, taking a stand against gun violence in our communities, and saying ‚Äòno more.‚Äô #EndGunViolence

RT @sunrisemvmt: ‚ÄúOur future is with young people. My advice to you is: refuse to be told not to dream big. Stand strong. Don‚Äôt be minimize‚Ä¶
What we seek is not small but big‚Äîa vision of spiritual over material development, collaboration over competition, connectedness over isolation, conservation over consumption and shared power over individual power.
In the end, brothers and sisters, remember this: it is not just about WHAT we fight for, it is about HOW we fight for it.
Third, let‚Äôs change the way we think about politics and elected office.
Second, let‚Äôs reject the false dichotomies that even some in our own party continue to put forward.
How? First, as Dr. King said, we must speak the inner truth that demands its real expression at this moment.
It is on US to take back our country, to re-form it as a true government by, for and of the people.
But make no mistake, the road ahead of us is long. Trump and his enabling Republicans destroy institutions from the FBI to the courts, from the EPA to the Media‚Äîand this is deeply, deeply dangerous.
Last year, we saw just that. From fighting back against the #MuslimBan, to defeating #TrumpCare, to the #MeToo movement, people have been making their voices heard.
But if Trump has done one thing, it is that he has made it abundantly clear to us that we have to awaken and stay woke as my good friend @BLeeForCongress will say. We can‚Äôt just fight for some of us, we have to fight for all of us.  And we have to be BOLD.
If the 2016 election taught us anything, it is that the consequences of apathy and voter distrust are severe.  Democracy can never be simply assumed‚Äîit has to be preserved, protected and advanced.
I like to say that I am not a woman on Monday, an immigrant on Tuesday, a worker on Wednesday and a mom on Thursday, I am all of those things all of the time and we must fight for all of those things all of the time.
You see, what I realized early on in my organizing career is that our problems lie partly in our tendency to silo issues.
I'm also proud to have been one of the partners with the @NAACP and @ACLU to demand police accountability, and to have fought with and for women‚Äôs rights across the board.
Nothing came easy‚Äîbut I am so proud to have served on the committee to pass the $15 minimum wage in Seattle, to have worked to pass marriage equality, to have helped lead the biggest anti-war march in Seattle against the Iraq war.
But needing economic power too, and that the only way to win was to build strong coalitions with workers, with labor, with the LGBTQ movement.
We recognized that we needed to wield political power too‚Äîso we ran the largest voter registration drive in the history of our state, registering over 23,000 new immigrants to vote.
Speak I did, and it led to an incredible 12 years of working with many of the folks in this room at #AVSummit18 to found and grow what became the largest immigrant advocacy organization in our state, organizing tens of thousands of immigrants
As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.said: of course there is uncertainty, ‚ÄúBut We Must Speak‚Äù. Whatever the agony, whatever the risk, We Must Speak.
Individuals from 25 Arab and Muslim countries were being forced to be registered and fingerprinted, when thousands were being detained and questioned and deported.
In that particular post-9/11 moment when the patriotic pitch was peaking, when the beginnings of the first Muslim ban was being instituted, then called Special Registration.
I wasn‚Äôt intending to found anything but within a week of 9/11, I realized that everything had changed for people who looked like me.
I became an organizer after a decade of working on global health and justice issues because of September 11, 2001. Many of us organizers get called to the work completely unexpectedly.
I‚Äôm also very proud to be one of the very few ORGANIZERS in Congress!
It is such an honor to be in this room at #AVSummit18 with some of the true leaders and champions of building progressive momentum to take back our country!

@MiniVanMartha Thank you so much, Martha, for your support.
Speaker Paul Ryan has promised a real solution for our Dreamers. It is now up to us to keep him accountable.
Trump created this fear when he rescinded #DACA. He left them unprotected and then tried to put the blame on Congress to fix the mess he created. Americans believed a bipartisan deal would be made but failed to keep his promise. 		He had his chance to stand up for our Dreamers.
I couldn't vote for the bill because Dreamers represent so much more than a discussion around policy. We've seen fathers of young children deported after 40 years of model citizenship. We have seen parents sent to detention centers after dropping their children off at school.
Republicans pride themselves on being ‚Äúpro-family‚Äù. This bill will tear families apart.		White House treated #Dreamers like nothing more than a bargaining chip. 800,000 are now left unprotected and fearing for their future after the passing of the budget.		https://t.co/9qJf4HYgwO

We are done re-litigating our constitutional freedoms. We are done justifying our bodies. Our votes go to those who respect our choices.
Candidates hoping to represent Democrats across the country must commit to women's economic justice, our rights and our bodily autonomy.
Having a child has major economic consequences for women and families. Gender, race and economic justice are deeply intertwined.
This is more than a personal issue ‚Äî it's an economic issue that hits low-income women and WOC the hardest.
Those who protect Roe v. Wade should be welcomed to the party, regardless of personal choice, so long as they do right by women.
If someone doesn‚Äôt personally believe in abortion, fine, but candidates should commit to uphold the right to choose.
For 44 years, the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision has stood clearly in favor of a woman's right to choose. We are past this discussion.

@BernieSanders @SenWarren Paid for by a fraction of a percentage tax on Wall Street - @keithellison's Inclusive Prosperity Act. These bills go hand in hand.
@BernieSanders @SenWarren ‚Ä¢ Free tuition for all families making up to $125k	‚Ä¢ Free tuition for all seeking a 2-yr degree	‚Ä¢ Federal student loan interest rates halved
One key piece of the #PeoplesPlatform is my #CollegeforAll legislation with @BernieSanders and @SenWarren.
A Fox News talking head recently called Seattle a "socialist hellhole," so we must be doing something right...
I'm so proud of Seattle, which led the way in the #Fightfor15. Our workers have more in their pockets and our economy is booming.
As a woman, I know that my choice to exercise reproductive rights is also an economic choice.
What's not to like? These policies, the #PeoplesPlatform, recognize that economic, gender, and racial justice are inter-connected.

Women have been taught to think we're not powerful, but we are. We are so incredibly powerful. We just need to connect with that strength.

I think of elected office as another platform for organizing.
So many women, and women of color, are excited about the idea that you don't have to have been in party politics for years to run.
In the beginning, fundraising was uncomfortable. I realized it's the same philosophy of a nonprofit: Raising funds to implement our vision.
RT @cmclymer: At a great @amprog panel listening to Rep. @PramilaJayapal point out the double standards in how media cover women candidates.
Found the media difficult. 2 male candidates' paragraphs: accomplishments. Mine: "She's a vociferous debater,"‚Äîscreams "Angry brown woman."
