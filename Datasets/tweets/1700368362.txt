All for our second ammendment rights but something has to be done to stop the violence.
So bummed about the continued violence at schools and such.
@NowWithAlex @hardball_chris You have a great show that I always watch.  But why have that loud ass Chris Matthews on?

@SpeakerBoehner obamacare is the law of the land.
@SpeakerBoehner Please do the right thing, do your jobs and end the shutdown insanity.  Holding out to win is not an option.
Obamacare is the law of the land and the Republicans continue to try to repeal it and now defund it to the detriment of the Country.
Let's get this country back on track and recall all the Tea Party people.
All the nation should rally and recall all the Tea Party members in Congress and State Houses and Legislatures.
It is amazing how a small number of Tea Party morons are holding the country and Republican party hostage with their b/s.
Great, bloody fantastic!
It is a disgrace to have any war vet homeless!
Why does America keep sending billions in aid to other countries when we have our own people homeless and hungry?
When are we as a society going to stop sending our generations of young people into useless and senseless conflicts and wars?
