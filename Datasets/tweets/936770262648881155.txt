@yankee2479 @realDonaldTrump Spearheaded by #SirFlinchsalot @realDonaldTrump
@GeneralGCuster @KurtSchlichter I'll be calling him #SirFlinchsalot for the rest of the week
@realDonaldTrump OK there #SirFlinchsalot
Can we start calling @realDonaldTrump by he nickname #SirFlinchsalot? Like "#SirFlinchsalot said he would run into an active #shooting situation unarmed. Nope."
#Parents today: "Stop eating #TidePods!"	Also Parents Today: "I want to give that twitchy #music #teacher a #gun!
@Cernovich Yes.
The #President who skipped the #draft by claiming to have bone spurs says he would have ran into an active shooter situation unarmed 😂 @realDonaldTrump
@CollinRugg @plozr10 You're really taking a minute out of your day to #diss three #students who had 17 of their friends #killed last week? You're a #ClassAct.
Just saw a post about how #America is dumbing us down, following a post about how #vaccines are a conspiracy and #vitamins is all you need. That's cool.
@LKmpf You know you're trashing a bunch of kids that just had all their friends shot to death, right?
Give #black #teachers #guns ... Except that when a black person gets shot for #legally holding a #gun, the #NRA stays silent ... #2ndAmendment
@dorbar @GeorgiaDirtRoad @phil4gop You do realize you're talking shit about 17 dead children, right?
@realDonaldTrump Why did the puppy cross the road?	"I dunno."	To knock on the idiot's door.	Knock knock.	"Who's there?"	The puppy.	"My I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! I’m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain. I'm, like, a smart person."

@RogueRepub1981 Scapegoat? Like, the shooter and his machine gun? Yep, got it.
@Maryland4Trump2 @Lpac2017 That's not a totally accurate assessment of the situation though.
@Education4Libs @BounceORound You have a habit of making things up to an insane extreme. Are you schizophrenic?
@TomiLahren Hey dead-eyes, imagine if we could keep guns away from that person to begin with, for all those cases where an alert grandmother isn't around to make a report!!
@TomiLahren You are literally politicizing this tragedy. Stop trying to flip the script. You suck at it.

@IAMWRITE @HealthCanadaca Have you ever tried finding out what fraction of people who do and don't get the #flushot die of the #flu? Because if you don't know the number, you're not speaking from a place of #KNOWLEDGE. #FluShotWorks, because the numbers say so.
@SStanislawa Congrats!! I heard abs are better than the flu vaccine 😂😷
@Jennywallwork Good luck! Go to the №doctor sooner rather than later if you need to!
@LotusOak What the fuck website is that? Lol you had to search pretty far to find that one. "Health Impact News"? Haha it's listed as a #FakeNews site. #STOP with this nonsense! #VaccinesWork.
This is absolutely #shocking. Remember that the #fluseason isn't bad because the #vaccine is so #ineffective. It's the other way around. The #fluvaccine is so ineffective because the #flu season is so bad. The flu vaccine saves tens of thousands of lives yearly, even this year. https://t.co/0Bl4TZwYWf

@Luma923 If you look at the link, you'll notice it's by some quack doctor running his own website, which is exactly what I said. Zero doctors who have researched flu vaccines have found them to be more dangerous than the flu.
@HealthRanger The reason they go so hard with the #flu #vaccine is because it #kills more than one in 1000 people yearly. Stop spreading your #conspiracytheory
@Elastigirl2018 The thing is their funding got cut to shit.
@MattStout07 I hope you got vaccinated. I know this year is a doozy but still.
@HealthRanger You know what's more likely to cause #GuillainBarreSyndrome than the #fluvaccine? The fuckig #FLU. stop spreading your #conspiracytheories please!

@LizCrokin No, Prince wrote a song titles Donald Trump (Black Version) but he definitely did not support Trump.

While most #SOTU addresses give us an idea of what the President plans to do with the immediate future of the country, @realDonaldTrump will be judged largely on whether he can speak cogent sentences.
I just watched a video of a loony nurse saying it's "impossible" to make a #FluVaccine, talking about RNA like she knows what she's talking about. She actually considered quitting her job over this. #Flushots are #safe. Why are they even discussed in the realm of #politics?

#Republicans generally support #DACA. @realDonaldTrump is just trying to turn the tide so that Republicans have to change sides on the issue. You might strongly hate illegal immigration, but DACA is a no-brainer. We're talking about kids who don't even speak anything but English.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @dcexaminer Stop twisting the facts, mkay?
@Maricristy @KatrinaPierson And after 60 hours of debate, the number of votes needed goes down to 51. That could have been done. The government does not need to implement stop gap measures a month at a time with the Senate, House, and White House in Republican control.
Currently, #Republican, #Conservative, and #AltRight #pundits are trying to make you believe the #government needs 60 #votes to pass a #budget. That is a lie. The government needs 51 votes, and they have 51 #Republicans in the #Senate. Don't let them #lie to you.
@AnnCoulter That's not how the #governmentshutdown2018 works. Republicans have 51 Senators, and they need a majority to pass a budget. No supermajority needed. Dems did not shut down the government.

@jasoninthehouse @FoxNews I don't know if that's true or not, haven't looked into it, but not for nothing, eliminating #NetNeutrality does now allow them to do that openly.
@Cope64 @seekofit @realDonaldTrump That's neither praise nor criticism. Looking at the facts, the #MiddleClass won't be enjoying the Tax "#Cut" lie. Those speakers lining up to praise @realDonaldTrump can keep #Kissingass, the strategy of praising lower-case him became apparent years ago, before he got elected.
@seekofit @realDonaldTrump HOWEVER ... #Progressives speaking against the #TaxCutsandJobsAct aren't speaking the #partyline nor the #CNN/#MSNBC line. They're pulling out data and showing, number for number, what the tax plan brings to individuals. The end result: mostly a middle class tax increase.
@seekofit @realDonaldTrump I'll say this: the #Republican party declared itself (#youtoubable) as the party of #no during #Obama's tenure. So in that respect, I will respect that it's possible, in theory but not in practice, that #Democrats are against ALL things #Republicans ... HOWEVER ...
@BarbMuenchen @POTUS No, #Democrats HAVE NOT been clamoring to lower #corporatetaxes. Why would a #SocialProgressive ever want to put debt on the backs of the #MiddleClass in order tk lower #corporatetaxes? Come on, obvious softball here! Put two and two together!
Here is one thing #Republicans aren't considering: if the #TaxCutsandJobsAct is a real #TaxCut, why would #Democrats be so against it? Who doesn't want to keep more #Money, right? Perhaps there's more to the #TaxPlan than the @realDonaldTrump #followers admit! #CountryBeforeParty
@thistallawkgirl And the #Republican #Faithful are thanking them for it. Such a #TaxScam !!

@chantyflaps @JohnS877 @Education4Libs @bradcadwallader Really? Because not once in 2017 had I actually heard anyone use #CNN or #MSNBC as #proof of a belief.

@chuckwoolery Are you seriously trying to #misinform us on how polls work?
@chantyflaps @JohnS877 @Education4Libs @bradcadwallader No, I definitely would not. Believe it or not, #progressives like me like #proof, and tend to accept proof quickly (which is why we tend to quickly abandon leaders who are proven to be #crooked instead of yelling #FakeNews). I would, however, give counterevidence, if it exists.
@intel_think @Lrihendry @TruthSoldierz Again, the article used a source but mischaracterized it. There were savings equaling to more than losses, and there were no coverage drops. You may work with your own opinions or alternative facts on that matter, and I can't argue against that. I prefer well-researched numbers.
@Lrihendry @TruthSoldierz Wow, intense read. Your tweet does mischaracterize the article, which itself mischaracterizes it's source. The PDF actually said the reduction is offset by savings elsewhere. Overall, more people would have been covered by the ACA,  so the reduction was not a coverage cut either.
@Lrihendry I know right! Like she says this #taxplan is a #moneygrab for the #rich! #Cray cray ...

@bbusa617 @CudaDebbie Doesn't that article break your intuition at all? All three branches of #government are run by #Republicans, but #Obama won't be in jail by #Christmas. That story probably doesn't pass muster, right? RIGHT?
Reading tweets of #Republicans swearing their #taxes just got #cut. They'll be wondering really soon why their savings aren't going up and their debts aren't going down as fast as expected. #FactAversion is making them broke, and they are going to blame #Libs. #SAD

@TruthSoldierz @kwilli1046 ... Yes, that's what I said. I have rarely seen a post from a #Republican about how the #US uses it's #soldiers and then #abandons them when they get here. Nearly all the ones I've seen come from the #Left. But if you agree, then hey, we have found ourselves a point of agreement.
@PressSec @POTUS You're doing a great job intentionally misleading your constituents. Sad.
@TomiLahren When you talk, your eyes make you look like you feel dead inside.
@kwilli1046 @TruthSoldierz The #ChicFilA beef was due to the COO's comments about #samesexmarriage. You call those comments good, but liberals call them bad. Now I'm not totally sure why you would think liberals are all talk when liberals are the ones who want to feed those in need on a consistent basis...
@LauraLoomer Aren't you the woman who #lied about getting her #tires #slashed for #attention?
@JustEric @CherylLynneRose Worth noting for accuracy, the #BannedWords issue wasn't a #hoax. It was based on the statement from Alison Kelly, a high ranking official at that #CDC meeting. Though the CDC did say there are no banned words, @CDCDirector did call it a "mischaracterization", not a lie or hoax.
@bradcadwallader @TPThompson2 @JohnJHarwood Do you make it a habit of making inaccurate statements and then following them up with "looks like I injured your ego" often? Because you've had three of those already and my ego is intact while your posts just are so wrong that your own post says you're wrong.
@Liz_Wheeler @Athenadellacro3 Translation: "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain." Honestly, how does collusion look worse than the well-vetted Iran deal?
@AmyMek @chuckwoolery Immigration Jihad?
@Cernovich 386K #followers and counting ... Sounds #accurate to me.
@JohnS877 @Education4Libs @bradcadwallader Educate us with a source ... Otherwise, I'm not a fan of #FakeNews made to sound like #RealNews.
@pvvult @ruckus2 @PressSec @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama #Nope. #Obama gets half of the credit for year 1. That's how it always works. Every four years.
@RobertsonHerman @bevroley703 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump For the record, everyone who knows better agrees that @realDonaldTrump's economy really starts after year 1. He only get partial credit for his #firstyear, which means he shares credit with the previous #President, @BarackObama. This has been said every four years for decades.
RT @lasesana: @PressSec @realDonaldTrump The @realDonaldTrump effect https://t.co/WLciFHMv7b
@realDonaldTrump I'd love to know what that means. Could be good, or could be really bad.
@RepDavidRouzer Way oversimplified. #NotTrue = #Lie.
@Education4Libs @bradcadwallader So adorable! Still holding on to the idea that the #BirthCertificate, which is accessible in #Hawaii, was in fact #forged! So cute!
@bradcadwallader @TPThompson2 @JohnJHarwood The graph caused you to say the opposite of what the graph says. Dumbasses tend to be wrong, so if you're wrong, what does that mean about you? Perhaps the hat you wear is a camouflaged dunce cap.
@THEbellajewels @shotzz20 @MikeSpeaks @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr ... What? Did those words come out of your brain and made sense to you?
@RealJamesWoods For ALL #Americans? Do you know what #GDP is? Or how it works? Or how it's related to #inflation and how that affects the #MiddleClass? When middle class income is stagnant, how will the resulting inflation be good for the majority of Americans whose money will be worth less?
@Education4Libs You know @realDonaldTrump is projected to increase it by $15 TRILLION while simultaneously making the government insolvent, right?

@tedcruz This is the most #uninformed tweet I've read since #Tuesday's #election in #Alabama. You have no clue what #NetNeutrality is, do you?
@kylegriffin1 Not the worst law, is it?
@Realjmannarino @realDonaldTrump Not quite. The #taxcuts to the #poor and #MiddleClass were promised. The #tax cuts to the #rich and larger businesses owners were delivered, leaving the poor and middle class in the dust. #NoPromisesKept.
@realDonaldTrump @nepafortrump How are so many #poor and #MiddleClass #republicans so convinced the coming #taxcuts will go to them? They won't. They are specifically designed not to. @realDonaldTrump is taking advantage of your #PartyLoyalty to convince you to follow along.
@Roger96203916 @mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump Ah yes, a guilty plea is not a guilty verdict. You are correct on that point. Please edit my tweet to replace "convicted" to "plead guilty", thanks 😊
@teenacardiel @TotallyNotTheDJ @Roger96203916 @mitchellvii @realDonaldTrump Nice job 😊
@mitchellvii How does one argue that the #Mueller investigation has exonerated @realDonaldTrump  if it hasn't even concluded and some members of his circle have already been convicted?
@Cernovich You seem #desperate to find a person on the left to pin #sexualharassment allegations on. Of course they exist. The point isn't that only #Republicans do it. The point is that it's OK to turn on the accused once enough information has come out, independent of #partyline.
Heard from a #Republican that #NetNeutrality is a new thing implemented by the @BarackObama administration in 2015. In actuality, no one in particular implemented it. Net Neutrality is the principle which allows your favorite site to do its thing and become popular by being good.
@mitchellvii O	You are paid millions of dollars to speak intelligently to the masses and this is what you come up with? Pretty uncreative. Do you not have something intelligent to say? Sad!!

If you really are honest, why would you ban such words as "evidence-based"?
@TomiLahren When are you going to start putting #country before #party?
@JerreMorganti4 @mitchellvii Ma'am, you've voted, I would assume, right? How do you think it would be at all possible to be bussed from another state and be able to vote without being a resident of their state? Not possible. You won't find a news clip of #voters being bussed from another state.
@mitchellvii You sound like an uneducated fool when you say things like this. Perhaps come up with an intelligent idea or argument against net neutrality?
@GovMikeHuckabee @BounceORound Who exactly are you talking about?
@mitchellvii Yes. To elect neither a pedophile nor a rapist like Republicans have. Also, to get people adequate healthcare. There's that too.

@IngrahamAngle Didn't you #NaziSalute to @realDonaldTrump a couple of years ago?
@realDonaldTrump 's support of unrepentant #Pedophile #RoyMoore (@MooreSenate) is the darkest mark on the #RepublicanParty this decade. Retweet if you agree.
@GrizzleMeister @BounceORound @MooreSenate @Hoosiers1986 @ClintonM614 @BethanyJuno @RacySicilian @JrcheneyJohn @FemalesForTrump @hotfunkytown @SparkleSoup45 @carrieksada You backed a #Pedophile! Gross!
I love how the #ultrafake and #untrustworthy TV #Conservatives are now coming out of the woodwork with safe #progressive posts, trying to distance themselves from the fact that they have been backing the wrong horse-riding #pedo #RoyMoore. Fake! Sad!
@realDonaldTrump backed the wrong horse-riding #pedophile, and now he can't take it back. What was almost the darkest blemish in #Senate #elections this millennium became a win for #Murca. Thanks to #Republicans for putting their #faith in #god and #country before #PartyLoyalty .
@realDonaldTrump #MAGA means defeating candidates like Roy Moore, and Alabamans did just that. If a loss for him is a win for #America, but you wanted him to win, what does that mean about you? It means you backed the wrong horse-riding pedophile. Pathetic!
@MooreSenate You lost BECAUSE you're a #Pedophile! Thanks #Alabama for making things right!!
#Republicans in #Alabama put #God and #Country before #Party to soundly reject known #ChildMolester @MooreSenate in the #Senate #Election,  bringing a moment of pride to what would have been a dark point in#America's #History. #Congrats to the Republicans. You made the right call
@realDonaldTrump You have serious problems, don't you?
@TomiLahren @TomiLahren You looked dead inside while saying that.
Do you remember just two years ago when #Alabama #Republicans didn't want #Transgender individuals in public #bathrooms for fear of #childmolesters? And now they are trying to #elect a child molester, @MooreSenate, to the #Senate. Please Vote @GDouglasJones. #DoTheRightThing.
#Alabama ... #College educated #Republicans believe @MooreSenate is a #ChildMolester. Maybe you should ask he ones that research everything about #RoyMoore before making that decision, and then agree to support @GDouglasJones  tomorrow.
@Ollyollyoxinfre @MooreSenate #Nope, #Christians don't believe in #ChildSexualAbuse. @MooreSenate  is not a good representative of Christian #Morality.
#Alabama @MooreSenate says he is kin with #VladimirPutin. Vladimir Putin, of course, allows the castration of #childmolesters. Perhaps #RoyMoore shouldn't visit his #brother at #MotherRussia's house?
@MAGAPILL @MooreSenate How does a parent of a 12 year old female put  their little girl in front of a child molester?
This tweet has more than 280 characters' worth of meaning. @MooreSenate is a child molester. #Alabama deserves better. If you are a #Republican, perhaps consider putting #Country over #Party. Taking the  #win means NOT #voting for #RoyMoore. https://t.co/mzg8j4LtjE
@michaelbeatty3 @MarcusBrutus_ @InTheYear1611_ @hrenee80 @AMErikaNGIRLBOT @AmericanHotLips @RuthieRedSox @carrieksada @HCDotNet @GrizzleMeister But @MooreSenate is a #ChildMolester ... #NOPE
@IncognitoPatrio How is a #childmolester a good man? #Nope.
@Britbyvampgmai1 I get the #strategy, but those kinds of things never work. Please don't #vote for the #ChildMolester just IN CASE he gets removed. That's one of the thousand ways @realDonaldTrump  won and he's supporting the child molester.

@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @realDonaldTrump What does it feel like to know you're going to be #voted the #WorstPresidentEver, even though you still have three years left to go and you can't get out of it for three more years?
@realDonaldTrump How do you feel about the interview in which @MooreSenate advocated eliminating #women's #VotingRights? It can't be #FakeNews if it's on a live radio show. #Speakup if you are against this, @realDonaldTrump!! It doesn't count if you wait to speak up until after the #election.
@PressSec The first year of the #economy is nearly 100% to the credit of the previous #President , as it has been for every previous President. I'm sure you know this, since you work in the #WhiteHouse and you're just snorting that #Trump powder.
I hope that the #Republican #voting public understands, their #leadership cannot change course because they are elected. Only the voting public can choose not to #vote for them and #drainthewamp. It starts with removing the bad eggs, and ends with unelecting @realDonaldTrump.
#Republican leaders' #sexism is so deep, in fact, that their leaders first jump to defend a #ChildMolester (#MarkFoley, Roy @MooreSenate), and only attack them when the situation becomes uncontrollable, if they lose an election, or public sentiment turns too hard.
Since #Nixon, they courted racists. Now their leaders are racist. Since Fox News's inception, they have presented women who have actually said women should be second class citizens. Now their male leaders are sexist, despite a few (#W, #McCain, @JohnKasich) trying to fight it.
The #RepublicanParty is in #crisis and doesn't know why. Here is one #obvious reason. When they do the bidding of a group, the group becomes their #constituent. When they do that for long enough, those constituents eventually #run for office and replace them. (1/2)
How do people who are clearly not going to be helped if the #AltRight  gets their way on every point, support the alt-right. #Gay people (hi #permabanned  #Milo) would lose the #rights that #straight people have. #Women (hi @greta) would be treated as #unequal at home and work.
@TheLeftIsRacist @MooreSenate I hope you're right! I hope @MooreSenate  doesn't win!
@MooreSenate The only way you have to convince your followers to #vote for you is to convince them that all the #news about you is a lie. Sad! It's not! How many #Senate candidates have to defend themselves against nine #statutory #rape #allegations? You're #horrible for #Alabama.
If I lived in #Alabama, I would vote #Democrat over someone who has (#notfakenews) appeared on a radio show which advocates the ultimate punishment (death) for #gays. If I were a raging #homophobe (I'm not), but someone says we should launch #Holocaust  2.0, I'd be like "I'm out"
@MooreSenate: "I think it [#USA] was great at the time when families were united—even though we had #slavery—they cared for one another…Our families were strong, our country had a direction." FINALLY, an #AltRight #candidate admits their #racism in plain language. #Alabama #Vote
@TomiLahren Can you be more than a talking point memo? Because this is exactly why the Jerusalem executive order was a mistake. Everyone in the media except Trump true believers said so.
@SarahPalinUSA can see #Russia from her house. @realDonaldTrump can see Russia from his house too.
@realDonaldTrump No, the last thing #MAGA needs is to support a statutory rapist.
@peterjhasson @DineshDSouza But what does it imply about us? A string of #Republicans commit sexual misconduct and their support increases among the #faithful. One #Democrat commits sexual misconduct and he is abandoned. A loss for @SenFranken  became a win for us all. Drop @MooreSenate and win too.
If @BarackObama brought #peace  to the #MiddleEast, @realDonaldTrump would blame #Muslims for destroying the #wareconomy.
@PrisonPlanet ... Huh?
#Progressives abandoned @SenFranken because we can't keep an #abuser within our ranks. #Conservatives support former (and twice suspended) #JudgeRoyMoore, @MooreSenate despite his penchant for #statutoryrape. Why? What happened to your #conservative #principles?
@TomiLahren Hi @TomiLahren! You know they're just saying that Black people's lives, rights, and safety matter and should be protected, right? They might be angry at the system, but wouldn't you be angry if Black #cops shot unarmed White people on a regular basis?
@DineshDSouza A ton of your guys are under #investigation because they are suspected of #criminal acts of various sorts from #statutoryrape, to #sexualassault, to #colluding with a foreign power, to #bribery and #extortion, to #ElectionFraud. Glad I could be of help #😊
@newtgingrich @newtgingrich are you, as a #TeaParty  #Republican, truly so #desperate to elect the serial statutory #rapist #Judge #Roy @MooreSenate (#R, #Alabama) that you are willing to defend a #Democrat  in a #sexualassault allegation? Go suck a lemon, you #unprincipled twitwaffler.
@ArchangelB @MooreSenate @SenFranken @realDonaldTrump Yep, we are totally #simpatico on that point.
@ArchangelB @MooreSenate @SenFranken @realDonaldTrump Hmm ... #Wikipedia? Though those pages tend to be volatile during #election cycles, I did go there. The article doesn't say what you said. Many of the girls did #tell someone, for	example. Also, there is no evidence of forgery.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump also signed an #executiveorder officially recognizing #Moscow as the #capital city of the #UnitedStates. #MAGA.
@ArchangelB @MooreSenate @SenFranken @realDonaldTrump Judge Roy @MooreSenate statutorily #raped a few females. It's OK to point that out and not feel the need to defend him by bringing up a #liberal who also committed #sexualassault .
@ArchangelB @MooreSenate Though I suspect @SenFranken  may soon be called "Mr. Franken" the answer to this question is the same as why @MooreSenate is still running, or why @realDonaldTrump is still in office. But for the record, shouldn't we be willing to criticize people in our own party? (1/2)
Two years ago, a man accused of #statutoryrape would have no chance of being #elected to the #US #Senate, especially by #familyvalues voters. This year in #Alabama, @MooreSenate is days away from potentially being elected. Why do #Republicans #trust #government so deeply?
@SenateGOP @SenJohnThune If so many #MiddleClass  individuals and #families will see a #tax increase, how many dreams are really being restored?
@TrumpStudents @NFL Perhaps the #murderers should be blamed for killing #GoodPoliceOfficers, instead of blaming the people #fighting for #protection  from the few bad police officers? Maybe "#BLM " means "#BlackLivesMatter" and not "#KillWhitey"?
@prageru @DineshDSouza This is so oversimplified that it's not really accurate. Nazis used the name, along with the Swastika, which was formerly a peace symbol, to fool people. If this were true, wouldn't the Nazi vote would split between Trump and Bernie? This did not and clearly would never happen.
@realDonaldTrump But @MooreSenate molested kids! How can you recommend #Alabamans vote for a #ChildMolester ?
Perhaps our belief that we should never talk #politics and #religion among friends has brought us to the point that some could be convinced to support a known child molester like #Alabama #Republican #Senate #Candidate #RoyMoore (@MooreSenate) just by saying two words, #FakeNews?
@charliekirk11 @TomiLahren The majority of #MiddleClass individuals who itemize deductions will see a #tax increase, and people like you and me who went to #college will get an additional #KarateKickToTheShins. If getting an education will become more expensive, how is that #MAGA?
@RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents Have you ever seen proof that some #Uranium  went to #Russia in the #UraniumOne deal? If so, educate us. If not, stop spreading #FakeNews.
@IngrahamAngle They are, though. This new #TaxBill is projected to shrink the economy while increasing costs on middle class individuals. That's why they're calling it the #TaxScam. Because it's #scamming #Liberals and #Conservatives alike.
The reason this new #TaxPlan is being called the #TaxScam is that it is #scamming #Republicans just as much as it's scamming #Democrats. It's a bad bill. No good!
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch @realDonaldTrump Your party's tax plan is a literal buck passer. While increasing both #taxes  and costs for most individuals, it will heavily reduce taxes for massive businesses, massively increase the #deficit, and will force future Presidents to raise taxes to fix the damage.
General #MichaelFlynn pleads guilty and is willing to cooperate with #RobertMueller's investigation into election meddling. To borrow a phrase from @realDonaldTrump , let's #DrainTheSwamp! #RealNews  #GoodNews
@realDonaldTrump can you explain to me how corporate #taxcuts puts puppy chow in my dog bowl?
It seems to me that the entire Republican strategy is to do everything that's bad for their voters and then say #fakenews" every time someone notices.
