@azcat92 @TheNational It wasn’t working
@Sigvard @TheNational @ticketstoday I know, jerks!!
@Sigvard @TheNational @ticketstoday Well, some people must have gotten some because I see them for sale for $340 and $440 each on the Ticketmaster resale page, and on stub hub starting at $760 🤨
@Sigvard @TheNational @ticketstoday Says LA is sold out. I’m curious to see if anyone got tickets
@BeauHayhoe @HOW7 @TheNational I haven’t seen anyone post that they got tickets for Los Angeles, have you?
@Sigvard @TheNational @ticketstoday 😏
@azcat92 @TheNational It wouldn’t do you any good anyway 🤨

@StaciaRR @LAKings @STAPLESCenter 😳
@tynie626 Yes!  We’ll plan stuff. If I wasn’t leaving tomorrow, I wouldn’t have so much to do today and I would be able to spontaneously do it! 😍
@tynie626 I could’ve totally show you the town and at least made you appreciate it. But it would had to be preplanned just because I didn’t block off the day. Had I known ahead of time I would’ve saved the entire day for you and it would’ve been a blast ♥️
@tynie626 It really just takes a little preplanning. There’s plenty to do, but you need to know what you’re doing ahead of time. It’s not a very spontaneous place.
@tynie626 Ok!  But you’re right, this city is spread out!!
@jbennet597 @conroy_quirk @KiriBlakeley @NYPDnews @TimesSquareNYC @NYPDSpecialops @NYPDTips @NYPDMTN Sometimes it’s legitimately just curiosity... or even an opinion... at least for me.  It just depends on how we express.  I’m a “to each his own”, but I still sometimes face palm!!  🤣

.@AmericanAir It’s terrible that you don’t let people pay for their bags when they check in online. I just dropped off my elderly mother &amp; I had to come back to bring her a credit card. I gave her $25 cash but you don’t take cash. Next time I will book her on Southwest or United.

@AmyGlaser1 It’s not a bad way to recoup money for the upkeep of the trails. I’ve just never heard of anything like that 🛴 (I mostly ride an ElliptiGO)
@AmyGlaser1 You need a trail pass?!
@Jeffrogerswi This is so great!
@AmyGlaser1 @EauxClairesWI @LeesaCrossSmith @SneezingCow Yes!!

@andthelights I don’t understand Los Angeles not being sold out. But we’ve got our tickets, and that’s all I can control.   We are even flying home from New York City that day and still plan to attend. Also EXC4. I’d love to hear some of your old stuff!
@LAMusicSlut I love it!!
@tynie626 Amazing!!  We have 2 groups of friends that will be traveling from Milwaukee to Eau Claire for the festival. (and I’m sure there are many, many others). Caravan! 😜
@tynie626 That will also be awesome!  I love Milwaukee. How are you getting from there to EC?
@LAMusicSlut I have two fake accounts so that I can vent politically! (I’m definitely not a celebrity tho) 😜

@AmyGlaser1 @tynie626 You are so right. I wouldn’t even know where to get a decent, summer raincoat
@tynie626 @_omgigi_ I hear you!  I would’ve had to check though after I saw that price!  😝
@tynie626 @_omgigi_ Did you also price Uber?  Because I find Lyft to be cheaper at least 90% of the time
Grrrr... gum smackers, GO AWAY!!!	#chewwithyourmouthclosed #nobodywantstohearit #whyyousittingbyme 🤨
@HPDSouthbay Yes, I will be my first.
@AmyGlaser1 @tynie626 I’m not sure why it never dawned on me to buy a summer raincoat 😜! I always get the little five dollar ponchos, but you’re on to something
@AmyGlaser1 They usually open up a new block every 3 to 4 months. So just be on the lookout.  I’ll let you know because I usually get the emails since I have purchased tickets for the show
@AmyGlaser1 They just opened up a new block last week. That’s the time to get tickets, when they open up a new block.
@AmyGlaser1 And honestly, it’s easier to go all the way to Chicago to see Hamilton since it’s in residence there. I’ve seen it 3x in Chicago and only once in LA. I’ll be seeing it in New York City in a few weeks #obsessed
@AmyGlaser1 So exciting!!
@HPDSouthbay Is there a coupon/promo code?
@andthelights Woo hoo!!

@Jonathan_Dubya @SWE_Motorizer @mittyjing @Running_84 @nowthisnews So that’s where I’m coming from 😜
@Jonathan_Dubya @SWE_Motorizer @mittyjing @Running_84 @nowthisnews Yuppie is a shortened form of "young urban professional," and its popularity won out over other acronyms of the time, "yumpie," for "young upwardly mobile professional, and "yap," for "young aspiring professional."
@Jonathan_Dubya @SWE_Motorizer @mittyjing @Running_84 @nowthisnews Yuppies are distinguished by their disposable income and the things on which they choose to spend it, like clothes, food, and cars. (hence the desire to buy something to crush your weed)...
@Jonathan_Dubya @SWE_Motorizer @mittyjing @Running_84 @nowthisnews That’s not the definition I think of when I think of yuppies.  More of “In the mid-1980's, people started using the derogatory term yuppie to talk about a particular group of middle-class, well-educated workers...
@tynie626 @AmyGlaser1 My husband makes fun of me for wanting to be all Midwest, and even LA, in NY. I don’t like the “no eye contact”, “no conversation” part of NY.  I’m better at it now, but I’m only there 2 weeks a year. It would be hard for me too. ♥️
@mittyjing @SWE_Motorizer @Running_84 @nowthisnews They don’t like to break the law 😜

I think I bought it in the airport in Mexico when I was there in November https://t.co/W4ko443i2J
@AsiaKateDillon Never, have I ever, been more bummed that I am 1 week behind (was OOT)... now I know it’s going to happen!  But, I don’t care, I can’t wait to watch it tonight.  #support
@andthelights Yes!!  Your dance class is my favorite
@TequilaAficion @ProductPoet @timberelk @DonSuenos @DavidReyesTeq @winetraveleats @LoriMoreno @wineworldnews @bizinthebag @popkrrnal @888TRESOCHOS @GozaTequila @EmbajadorTquila @donjulio Will do!  Muchas gracias ♥️🥃♥️
@popkrrnal @TequilaAficion @timberelk @DonSuenos @DavidReyesTeq @winetraveleats @LoriMoreno @wineworldnews @ProductPoet @bizinthebag Yes!!!  I keep the 2 oz glass bottles that my wellness juice shots come in and take them with me places 😜
@ProductPoet @TequilaAficion @timberelk @DonSuenos @DavidReyesTeq @winetraveleats @LoriMoreno @wineworldnews @bizinthebag @popkrrnal My daily go-tos are Ocho añejo and Casamigos añejo. My old habit was 1942, but I felt I needed to limit myself 😜 Any good añejo recommendations? I’m always up for trying new ones.
@OxbowHotel I’m mostly an “Añejo tequila, neat“ gal, but I do appreciate his artistry! Plus, you carry Casamigos añejo. 🤙🏽	(I’m trying to get you to also carry Ocho Añejo, and I won’t give up hope!) 8️⃣🥃
@ProductPoet @TequilaAficion @timberelk @DonSuenos @DavidReyesTeq @winetraveleats @LoriMoreno @wineworldnews @bizinthebag @popkrrnal I need to make a tequila run today! I’m out of my faves 🥃
@OxbowHotel Nooooo!  When is his last day?
@BrianJMather @hwinkler4real @briankoppelman Right?!  That rarely happens!  I’m digging the direction
@tynie626 We’re staying there 7/5-10... party!!
@angowen Look at what idiot Convertible Bert said...
@AsiaKateDillon Things have changed since I was in the biz many years ago (not in front of the camera... mostly post).  Scripts were still on paper ;)
@jerrycowgill @EauxClairesWI I think the bonding experience will be even greater this year!  We’ve been all 3 years, and are super close to several people we met in line on day one of the first EXC.  I’m super excited
@eatwisconsin @EauxClairesWI @Showboat_Saloon There may not be any specific day clues, but there are plenty of bands that have been “leaked”. To me it doesn’t matter, but even if it did, I know a good amount, enough to buy and go.  I do understand young people, not having a huge budget, not wanting to fork out the money tho
@andthelights I got my tickets for the Los Angeles show the second they went on sale. We are even flying home from New York that day, but we’re coming to see you! #wouldntmissit

@AmyGlaser1 so scary that he did this for so long...
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance Lol!  Fantastic! That is so great! We have a duplex that we bought in Eau Claire. It’s rented out to students. Once we retire, we will be in Eau Claire and then maybe Arizona in the winter. We can sell our So Cal house to pay for both, we hope! 🤞🏽
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance That’s right!! ✊🏽
@EauxClairesWI Two days 😜 https://t.co/5evcMND5rQ
@HarMarSuperstar Photo!!
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance Fantastic, I love that! I have a cousin, who is three months younger, that lives down the road in Menomonie, which is where I was born (my dad is still there). We moved to Eau Claire and I live there through junior high before my mom moved us out to California. She regrets it 🤣
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance We shall meet up this year!!  We get in 7/3 and stay until 7/10. I’ll also be out 5/7 through 10, and will be back in November for the tallest man.  Let’s DM and make a plan.
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance Yes! Thanks. We also were anticipating the first day sale of the EXC tickets. Did you see the Pitchfork article? They quoted me in the very first pararaph ♥️🤙🏽♥️ I’m sure you’re just like us, and can’t make any of your other summer plans until you know the dates of EXC. 😍
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance Girl! I am a 2x cancer survivor. Most of last year was surgery and radiation treatments, but I have never missed an EXC! Are you going to EXC4?  We are blessed, for sure! Did you see TU/BI in MN?
@AmyGlaser1 This is so great!!
@AmyGlaser1 @blobtower @boniver @TUDance I’m so excited. We see them on that Sunday at the Hollywood Bowl, and then drive up for the regular Bon Iver concert at Santa Barbara Bowl that following Wednesday. All of this is just one month after Eaux Claires! (and it’s our 20th anniversary this August) ♥️
@blobtower @boniver @TUDance See you there!  Whatever the date... 😜 https://t.co/hffaAyRW52
@Millikenmoon @2_thine_ownself @HamillHimself It could’ve been worse, I asked for Dorothy Hamill! 😜
@boniver @blobtower @TUDance On the website, you listed the date next to the pre-sale code as August 15. I think the date is August 5
@TheCurrent @OxbowHotel Who won?
@bklyniri @JTM_YVA @kanyewest yep, the republicans courted them
@BermanBrad @QueenDivaDiba @realDonaldTrump So you agree that bashing Obama for eight years would’ve been bad, right? And yet you elected someone who did just that. Think about that for minute.

Happy Earthstrong, @stephenmarley. I’ll celebrate with your music 🎶 ❤️💛💚🎶
@jeannetorres__ You know that will be a big demand game. But it’ll be dependent on whichever team is coming to town, in my opinion.
@AmyGlaser1 Definitely!!  But I agree
@AmyGlaser1 I try to see them once a year. The past few years have been rough ☹️
@AmyGlaser1 I went to the January 2014 (I think) playoff game that we lost to SF... it was about -40º.  AND we lost... that was NOT fun!!  💚🏈💛

@StaciaRR @laffmotron @LAKings I’ve just had the same conversation with my friends. We are all thinking of not watching, but that’s hard to do! I can’t see the beginning of the game anyway as it starts at 4:30 here in Maui. But #GKG!!

@andylassner @JessicaLynn624 Hey and, GO KINGS GO!  We need a win tomorrow!!
@andylassner @JessicaLynn624 I only hung in there becaues you did!!
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624  https://t.co/RgZIO46Xma
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 A) I never said Trump was 100% bad. B) I never called you names or any of that. You on the other hand have done that plenty. I know I’m open-minded (&amp; educated). I may completely disagree with you, but I respect everyone enough to let them have their own opinion, no name calling.
@AmyGlaser1 Ugh!  I’m trying to convince my husband to do a Wisconsin/California split, and this is not helping!!
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 If you say so. You’ve lost any credibility you may have had by that statement. There’s nothing rational about that. But hey, capitalize it and then maybe it’s so.
@miss_speech @me_adelson @Jagdteckel @jay_peg @lldodd60 @kaytee1098 @McClatchyDC Ha!! https://t.co/4yrX1ZYOon

When you realize, it’s not about the suffering Syrian people after all... https://t.co/2WVtOfpPmY
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 You’ve called us Delusional Liberals several times. You are the one being snarky. Try having a conversation without calling people names, and saying things like “people like you” or calling them naive. Just open your mind to the possibility that none of us know everything.
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 The leaks have come from the administration, not the investigation! Huge difference. I will agree with you that I don’t think Trump colluded. I think he’s being used, he’s a puppet. His ego and his “genius” won’t let him see it. It does not mean he’s not a traitor to the USofA.
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 And by “know it all” I’m not being snarky, calling you a name... I mean, Do you really think you know everything that Mueller knows? Because I doubt any of us do. But these people don’t play around. We gave them a job to do, let them do it. They’ll fill us in in good time... soon
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 You think there’s zero evidence of shady-as-fuckery?! Then why is there so much activity coming out of this investigation? Why R DT &amp; the GOP trying so hard to stop this investigation when things are coming to a head? Do you really think you know it all? Get ready for the reveal.
@USAObserver @andylassner @JessicaLynn624 The fact that you compare disliking DT to disliking Obama means you have NO clue why we want him out. Obama may have had different policies than you like.That’s akin to not liking Bush(es). Not liking trump is a whole other ballgame, &amp;if you really open your eyes, you’ll see it.

@NiveaSoftXX @AsiaKateDillon Yes, I was going to say that there was a “look”, but not worthy of word.
@TrishaBerube @alt_labor True... but even then, they are just hypocrites.  What is wrong is when you do stuff that is SHADY AF and anti-American to hide the fact that you are a total freakazoid.

@taraseoane @blobtower @OxbowHotel I’ve been to the restaurant many times. It’s awesome, quaint. When I was home in December this year we saw YMusic and S. Carey play there. They do a great job with local music. They make really good drinks! Food is good, but not LA good. I’m looking forward to July. We go 7/3-10.
@taraseoane @blobtower @OxbowHotel My husband got us into the Oxbow this year. I’m dying!  I usually stay at the Lismore because I’m a Hilton Honor’s member, but it was sold out. We go for a whole week so I can see my dad, cousins and friends. I love that you know about the Oxbow!!
@blobtower  https://t.co/9Nb6EnEXSn
@taraseoane @blobtower We drove up to Santa Barbara one year!  I’d love to hit up Oakland Fox sometime. We also saw them at Fox Pomona and the Shrine. I think that’s it 😜 You guys should definitely do the Eaux Claires festival. It’s amazing!
@taraseoane @blobtower You’re pretty much as bad as us! I’m from Eau Claire, so we saw them in August at his festival. My husband is from New York so we flew out to Brooklyn in December &amp; saw them at the Kings Theatre. Amazing! I also flew out to Milwaukee last month for the Emme 10 year show #obsessed
@taraseoane @blobtower Yes!  That was epic!  We splurged and sat in the fifth row for that show
@blobtower Sometimes we use his recordings when we invite friends to a show. That way it gives them an idea of what to expect.
@blobtower My husband usually records 1 song per concert. I used to think it was weird but then we get home, he replays it &amp; we relive the moment for a second. I think if you recorded the whole show that would be lame, but one song creates a good memory. Yes, we do watch them. (Keep it low)
@blobtower I hear Devo is playing again. You should get them to play in Eau Claire. 	❤️✊🏽❤️

@cvizzzy @andthelights @FallonTonight Woot!!  No doubt

I'll watch anything @MissKajlich is in!  She rocks and is a major dog lover! #Undateable #formerdogparkbuddies
@rangersreport Seinfeld reference?! I just saw that episode like yesterday. Go Rangers!!
@matthewstolarz then you're doing something right! I definitely feel the same way you do
@matthewstolarz some things yes, some things no
@AugieRunGood I think it's better to get a loss out-of-the-way when it doesn't really matter. Sometimes it prepares you for the next wins
@TheBroadwayHat @gonyr24 I still haven't recovered from last night! #lightheaded #NYR #GKG
@Ageld22 Friday... Game 6... You and me?!
RT @TheBroadwayHat: Hey @LAKings, it's cool, Game 6s are where it's at anyway.
@TheBroadwayHat @LAKings thanks Hat!  Go Rangers!  Go Kings!!
@TJLang70 @tspice15 Love ya, TJ!  My 2 fave teams... Kings &amp; Packers
@dubdx I feel totally lightheaded from not breathing!
RT @KopitarIsLA: Reading up just in case #LAKings http://t.co/mC1G7QtJtC
@Garts2point2 all I can say is this, Rangers need 2 win the E. &amp; whichever team wins the W, it'll b a better series than the divers from MTL
@Garts2point2 plus, I'll probably end up divorced! My husband is a huge Rangers fan
@Garts2point2 i'm still hoping for an LA / New York finals

@Buccigross go Kings go!!
@Hunchee123 amazing!  As always
@GuyWithSuitsLA that's the difference between us &amp; other teams... When 1 of our own does something stupid, we call him out! Not other teams!
RT @lakingsinsider: Chicago has been out-shot 358-287 after the first period in the postseason.

@RollinJimmys agree!!  Rangers are up 2-1 in that series.
@ohHeyJoeyP yes. Go Rangers!!
@ohHeyJoeyP at least it wasn't Quick's fault this time
@RollinJimmys you do know!  I'm talking Kings hockey. I'm also rooting for the Rangers in the east
@RollinJimmys Not even close! I'm terrible @ English/writing. Am just pissed that my kings lost 3 in a row, so I'm taking it out on u guys 😁
@RollinJimmys than!!
@johncusack @RollinJimmys 	Its, "No, I'm not. You're just not informed." Learn how to write/type!!  Jeez...

@nycscar @Pollym89 me too! And of course I have to go back to work from 4 to 6 my time
@Pollym89 @nycscar OMGosh!  We'd better win!  Both teams
@theblake42 yo!  You're back... just in time for playoffs 👍
@ohHeyJoeyP i'll probably talk to you Tuesday. Go Rangers, go Kings
@nycscar @Pollym89 I know, right?! I was so happy after we had that two-goal lead!  And now 😭😭😭
@ohHeyJoeyP I doubt it can be any worse than this! 😭😭😭
@Patrick_ONeal Kings fan here... no matter what. I'm shocked right now
@ohHeyJoeyP yes! Twins!  I have a feeling they will still start Quick in game 3. But who knows?
@nycscar @Pollym89 I have no clue what is going on!
@ohHeyJoeyP right?!  My #1 team is the Kings &amp; my husband's is the Rangers, so I root for both.  Not a good day for us! Pull Quick, quick!!
“@LAKings: Touchdown for the Sharks.”  Sad
@nycscar @Pollym89 they need to pull him, but I'm thinking they won't since they pulled them in game one
@ohHeyJoeyP agree Joey. Maybe they're not pulling him because they pulled him in game one?  I'm sick to my stomach
@nycscar @Pollym89 he is so off his game. It's like the opposite of the game the other night.  The Kings have come unglued
@nycscar @Pollym89 totally unbelievable. No idea what is going on
@nycscar @Pollym89 this game is worse 😭😭😭😭😭

@Pollym89 @nycscar cool!  How far is that for you?
@Pollym89 @nycscar I'm leaving for Cozumel in 6 days. That is all ;)
@Pollym89 @nycscar it's all good!  I'm not sitting though. I'm cleaning and then gonna work out. I get get a ton done in 2.5-3 hrs
@nycscar @Pollym89 LOL!  I'm good at math, just a little tired. Yes, this game started at 8:30am body clock time!!  Doh!
@nycscar @Pollym89 so did this game really start at 8 AM?! If we hadn't change the clocks
@Pollym89 @nycscar 11 I could get behind!  Noon, even better. 9=too damn early
@nycscar @Pollym89 9am game!!  WTH?!  Now I will never get hubby to get anything done!  Go Rangers! ❤️💙
@nycscar @Pollym89 It's only bad because you guys are teetotalers!
@nycscar @Pollym89 I'm out drinking... Again!!
@KingsFanDaily @amartinez_27 yes please!
@nycscar @Pollym89 woot!  I made it home in time for that one!

@tom91381 what's the news?!
The only good thing about the NFL offseason... @AaronRodgers12 on Twitter!! 💚💛🏈	(I totally respect him staying off during the season)
I have way more Rangers friends on here than LA Kings. I assume that is because they have more passionate fans that we do, but come on! #GKG
@Pollym89 @nycscar he's gone. I like him, but it had to be done. The Rangers also got Martin St. Louis. Better team now!!
@jillydag @SloFilmFest @LIOthemovie I send my support!  I wish I could get up there. Win-win... Fab movie, fab location
@Pollym89 @nycscar are we sad about Cally?

@Pollym89 @nycscar it's been good since I turned on the radio in my car!
@nycscar @Pollym89 Nash!!
@Pollym89 @nycscar Rangers at 10 AM, Kings at 1 PM, my time. I guess I'll only miss the first half of the Rangers game ❤️💙
@Pollym89 @nycscar why are the games on so early today? Don't they know some of us have to work?! #LGR #GKG

@Pollym89 @nycscar I'm with you. Smack em all
@nycscar @Pollym89 they were just trying to protect the lead at the end of the game and not win the game. That never works
@Pollym89 @nycscar That was BS!!

@nycscar @Pollym89 nice seats, Terri!!  Big upgrade, eh?!
@nycscar @Pollym89 Kings've been terrible lately. Seems like the Kings &amp; Rangers can't play good at same time, so maybe we will win tonight!
@nycscar @Pollym89 Did I miss the picture?
@nycscar @Pollym89 I'm working until 9 EST. I was supposed to work until 10:30, so at least I'll be able to catch the last period.

@nycscar @Pollym89 thanks! oh, it was a mess! But for some reason my Southwest direct flight was not canceled. I think because it was at 737
@nycscar @Pollym89 so she drove to Chicago to catch her 2nd flight. Then she ended up being three hours delayed on that 1. But, she got home
@nycscar @Pollym89 I got home yesterday, only 1 hour delayed. I've just been busy trying to catch up. My sister's first flight was canceled
@Hky_Society @A_HockeyThing really, because I don't see a very good goalie in that Canadian roster. It could be just me though
@nycscar @Pollym89 go Rangers!  FYI, men suck when they are sick ;)
@nycscar @Pollym89 yah, me neither ;)
@Pollym89 @nycscar in LA, we can bring in our purses, that are searched, and we walk through a metal detector. But it's not a big deal

@310cheesehead holy shist
@aaronESPN sick to my stomach
RT @AdamSchefter: QB Matt Flynn, whom Buffalo released today, would have to pass through waivers before he could sign with GB or any other …
@310cheesehead he probably thought it would be inconclusive. We need Aaron.
@310cheesehead dude, I'm sick to my stomach
I guess we should have kept Matt Flynn. He played well here. #notgivingup #GoPackGo
@nycscar @Pollym89 ugh, ran with the ball, didn't slide, got tackled, hurt shoulder... no word, but has not returned
@nycscar @Pollym89 I am. Watching packers now though
