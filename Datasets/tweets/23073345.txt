Re: NATO says Lugar: the important part of this treaty isn‚Äôt who pays their bills. Many of these countries are not rich. The importance is that these countries stopped killing each other. @ypfp #ArmsControl2030
Only situation that would deescalate threat would be if #DPRK leader got and believed assurances from intn‚Äôl community that his country won‚Äôt be overthrown.
This is why we‚Äôre hopeful that Putin is interested in helping reducing threat regarding #DPRK #ArmsControl2030
Lugar: Assad was convinced by Putin to begin disarmament, not US. That is how we got into Syria. #ArmsControl2030
@ypfp May be coming to a day where we can measure compliance with #cyber and #drone technology. #ArmsControl2030
@ypfp Lugar: hard for US to monitor when not on the ground. Russians on the ground, but not comprehensive intel. #ArmsControl2030
Q: How do we ensure compliance w/these treaties and strategies? @ypfp #ArmsControl2030
Worked w/Russian relationship w/Syria and US tactical expertise to remove weapons from villages in Syria and destroy them at sea. #ArmsControl2030
@ypfp Sen. Lugar: not on a track w/Russia to have this convo now. Better approach: rather than talk about disarming each other, let‚Äôs talk about disarming Syria.
How do we measure success for cooperative threat reduction? @ypfp #ArmsControl2030
US and Russian interest now is in refurbishing weapons. No interest in reduction #ArmsControl2030
@ypfp No says Sen. Lugar b/c there‚Äôs no appetite in the Admin or Congress to do so.
How can we apply this legislation to the Russian Situation today? Can we reengage? #ArmsControl2030 @ypfp
In 2013, the Russians didn‚Äôt want Cooperative Threat Reduction anymore, and the approps stopped. Nunn-Lugar has not been reauthorized since.
Over the years, either through changes to NDAA or as a stand-alone bill, the legislation evolved. Times were changing too: Soviet Union ended, political climate evolved. The trips continued, and the legislation evolved with the times. #ArmsControl2030
The Sens. took the Admin. to Russia and Belarus to experience the impact their bill would have, and with that they changed hearts and minds #ArmsControl2030
After many breakfasts and negotiating, the bill passed. It arose from the Senate, not the WH, and the WH wasn‚Äôt pleased.
Nobody in Senate was on board w/giving $$$ to help the Russians. #ArmsControl2030 @ypfp
First approps to help disarm And denuclearize Russia was $400M.
@ypfp Nunn &amp; Lugar called Ash Carter to help w/debating and drafting legislation to reduce nuclear threat.
@ypfp They sat around the ‚ÄúNunn-Lugar Table‚Äù w/Russian delegation to discuss ‚Äúmutually assured destruction‚Äù &amp; try to find a solution. #ArmsControl2030
According to Sen. Lugar, it is v. hard to pass any arms treaties w/o bipartisan support. That‚Äôs where his friend Sen. Nunn comes in. #ArmsControl2030 @ypfp
&gt;&gt;&gt; This man served 34 (!!) years in the Senate. Longest serving Hoosier. How about that @SenToddYoung @SenDonnelly? #ArmsControl2030
