The one line from Susan Collins's long, thoughtful speech that sums up her apparent support for Judge Kavanaugh: "The claims at least should meet a threshold of more likely than not."
@joshchafetz No, I'm just saying it all comes down to Manchin. If I were his campaign, I would advise him to vote FOR Kavanaugh, unless he had strong moral objections that prohibited him from sending him to the court.
@joshchafetz ah I see. And my calculation is still that Collins is voting no this afternoon (just a guess based on her scheduling a speech), which gives Manchin cover to change his vote
There is nothing in the world like reporting in the United States Congress. 👏 to all the congressional reporters tirelessly covering this endless story https://t.co/LADKXEHE97
@joshchafetz so have we switched positions on whose vote this comes down to, Manchin or Collins? :)
@joshchafetz But! I think another good point for your argument is that Manchin would have a hard time going back home and explaining why he voted "yes" to advance, then "no" on the final vote
@joshchafetz I agree with you that Collins has more influence in this situation, in that she can give Manchin political cover. But it still ultimately comes down to how Manchin decides to vote.
Despite valiant efforts by tireless Capitol Hill reporters to track down how these sentors will vote, Murkowski's "no" vote on advancing Kavanaugh shows just how much deliberation is going on behind the scenes with this swing senators. https://t.co/vySnHVdoVa
Okay, guys. This looks like it will all come down to how Joe Manchin will vote tomorrow. A Pence tie-vote can erase a "no" Susan Collins vote, leaving it 50-50. So will Manchin buck his party again on the final vote and help confirm Kavanaugh?

And here are the rankings: https://t.co/gM7BbB7wj2
But overall, as we hit the crucial one-month mark to the election that will decide control of Congress, Democrats have the momentum in these 15 key races, which will go a long way to helping them net the 23 they need to take back the House
Republicans are putting up impressive fights to keep seats in Miami and the outer DC suburbs in Virginia. They also have a good chance to pick up a seat in Minnesota with a retired police officer
Democrats are now competitive in unseating Kevin Yoder in Kansas, while once nail-biter races in Arizona and Iowa now seem more likely than not to flip to Democrats

"There is simply no reason to deny Judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court on the basis of evidence presented to us"		Chairman Grassley kinda blowing over the fact the Senate didn't bring forward all the evidence to determine Ford's accusation, like questioning Mark Judge

Some crucial details are trending Democrats' way: Tennessee is competitive, while races to unseat Dems in Michigan, Ohio &amp; Pennsylvania aren't really on the radar anymore. Also, maybe Texas? Anyway, those rankings will be out in a few minutes. I'll share them here.
Of our 10 most competitive races, three are Republican-held, while Democrats need to defend nearly all of the other seven seats to net the two that would help them get a slim Senate majority. /3 (out of 4, I promise)
IF Dems win the Senate. I just finished ranking the top 10 most competitive races 6.5 weeks out from Election Day. Democrats have to have a near-perfect sweep of those to grab the majority for the first time since 2014. /2
So this week has really driven home just how much control of the Senate next year matters. Democrats could hold up Kavanaugh's nomination forever if they win control this November. /1

This may be the punchiest line from Obama so far on Trump. He ticks off household income rates rising, uninsured rates going down when he left &amp; says: "I mention all this just so you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started."
Obama striking an unmistakable populist tone here: "[Backlash to progress is] manufactured by the powerful &amp; the privileged who want to keep us divided &amp; keep us angry &amp; keep us cynical b/c it helps them maintain the status quo and keep their power and keep their privilege."
"It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom not the case. He is just capitalizing on what politicians have been fanning for years."
President Obama: "I was also intent on following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage and making room for new voices and new ideas." ... Here we go

Also: Any question of whether the president can be subpoenaed by the special counsel (something that could come up before the court in the Mueller investigation) is a "hypothetical" Kavanaugh says he won't answer
So far, Kavanaugh has brushed off concerns that he holds an overly expansive views of presidential power by basically saying he was misquoted, misunderstood, or was only engaging in thought exercises, not laying out his constitutional views

This from former senator Joe Lieberman also fits in the Trump-shot list: "His death seems to have reminded the American people that these values are what makes us a great nation, not the tribal partisanship and personal attack politics that have recently characterized our life."
2. "He was the fierce conscience of the nation's best self ."		3. "The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great."

This McCain anecdote, from @SenSchumer just now: The Democratic leader wanted to prove to a reporter he knew McCain so well, he "mistakenly" cited McCain's cell # by heart. "They had to edit it out to protect McCain's privacy."
McCain felt so strongly about repudiating Trump's foreign policy, he dedicated the last words of his last words to it. https://t.co/Fv6TForLVC

My go-to for understanding the nuances of Supreme Court battles, @joshchafetz, says it's quite possible Kavanaugh has since changed his mind about executive power. He's written that criminal investigations of presidents aren't helpful to the public https://t.co/6TvXvifZxD
One thing's for sure: Kavanaugh thought Clinton should get impeached for his affair, the cover up and attacking the independent counsel. But can we transpose the past with the present? https://t.co/kFjv6qUKRp
@PUrbanDC thanks for thinking of me and snappin' the photo! warm and fuzzies all over
Kavanaugh was:	-VERY tough on Clinton because he felt there was "no reasonable defenses to his pattern of behavior"	-SUPER annoyed that Clinton's personal and legal problems took up so much oxygen	-Also annoyed Clinton was, he felt, disparaging the independent investigation https://t.co/YyG1U6bz2i

@Eugene_Scott recording is the new leaking
@joshchafetz Yeah I agree these tapes have opened up the possibility that Omarosa could bring something damaging for the president, like the n-word. But it just doesn't seem like she has something in that vicinity.
Biggest takeaway from all the Omarosa tapes for me, so far: It sounds like the White House was worried she'd go and do exactly what she's going and doing. In other words, all of this has been very Omarosa focused, less so on Trump.

So Trump is now reported to have considered getting rid of 5 top officials in DOJ and the FBI. (sessions, rosenstein, mueller, mccabe, and comey, whom he actually did fire)

Trump's been tweeting about "amnesty" and ending the diversity visa lottery and "chain migration" pretty much ever since that fateful meeting
As Trump tells it, it sounds like he invited conservative senators to hear out Durbin/Graham's DACA proposal, and when the conservatives didn't like it, he didn't like it. https://t.co/Mco5HgtLkS
It’s pretty clear the president said something in that DACA meeting that the White House finds politically embarrassing.
This whole thing, and especially @SecNielsen's characterization of that DACA meeting, is making it seem that whenever Washington politicians argue, they get profane.
Did Trump use vulgarities in that DACA meeting? asked Sen. Patrick Leahy, point blank, to @SecNielsen. She basically says yes: "The president used tough language in general."

Al Franken struggled with his "apologies," saying he was simply a sloppy hugger and suggesting his accusers misread the situation. In his resignation speech, he didn't apologize to these women once, and basically straight up said they got it wrong.

@CillizzaCNN Even with that caveta, I still think Lauer's apology was the best we've had so far. He basically said we got the gist of it right, that he's a serial sexual predator, and made no excuses for it. Maybe we've just had some seriously awful apologies so far
@ryanbeckwith Yup. I believe networking is absolute must to getting a job in political journalism in Washington. And it's already difficult enough, without PV casting doubt on any aspiring journalist.
While the things AL Franken is accused of are horrible, this accusation is particularly egregious. He went abroad to cheer up U.S. troops, and he allegedly groped one of them.
Al Franken's fifth accuser has similar stories to his other accusers:	1. It happened during a photo op	2. At first, the woman thought he had made a mistake	3. But as his hand stayed in parts it shouldnt be, the woman was certain he purposefully groped her  https://t.co/nxonCITmgI
@KevinUhrm Right. Project Veritas has blurred that line between journalism and politics in a way that I think makes it hard to set boundaries.
spot on https://t.co/l7fjm6Rq1W
@calizoned I read his apology as: some of the stuff being reported isn't true, but they go the gist of it right. And the gist of all the reporting is was a serial sexual harasser
Good ideas. Perhaps media organizations could also proactively reach out to aspiring journalists in less connected, affluent areas. https://t.co/glVFmRSqgC

@ralphehanson no, that can only be done for constitutional reasons (like not being a US citizen), per @joshchafetz
I count three GOP senators - @CoryGardner  @LindseyGrahamSC @SenToddYoung - who have suggested or outright said the Senate should consider expelling Roy Moore if he wins.
Even before Moore won the primary, some Alabama Republicans were entertaining this idea, and it never seemed to gain traction. https://t.co/GsKgf2lZgg
NRSC Chair Cory Garder says if Moore wins, the Senate should vote to expel him. Here's how that would go down:  https://t.co/aif4GisKLs
1. These women said they didn't want the public scrutiny, then or now, of challenging a powerful man/bringing potential embarrassment on themselves	2. Moore got to a position where these women felt they had to speak out	3. It took until now to to report the story https://t.co/aV0LAr1hm3
@joshchafetz @bindersab I'm only as good as my experts. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!
@Atroarturo no, im Tying Joe Biden to the establishment and saying he’s trying to fold in Bernie Sanders type policies.
@Atroarturo it makes sense if you add a comma in between establishment and Bernie Sanders! A mash up of the two
Hey chryon writers, can we please stop giving Louis CK credit for an apology? He never once said “I’m sorry.”
@Anton_Stevens no. he married his wife several years after the allegations took place
Once again, Roy Moore does not deny he dated teenagers, who he met at the mall or at a high school, when he was in his 30s.
'We fully expect the ppl of Alabama to see through this charade and to vote in the primary coming up," Roy Moore says of the GENERAL ELECTION

@thefix I think she is a strong incumbent, perhaps a stronger incumbent than No. 2, Heller in Nevada. But her state went for Trump by 19 points!
@thefix Both McCaskill and Dean Heller in Nevada have potentially strong challengers and are running in states that went for the other side in '16
@thefix All that being said, I still put a Democrat (Claire McCaskill) as the most vulnerable senator in '18, which is different than other rankings
@thefix A sizeable number of red-state Dems are raising millions &amp; watching Republicans beat themselves up in primaries https://t.co/Q1SJdtptLT
@thefix BUT Dems could be helped by two things: An anti-incumbency (Trump-fueled) unpopularity, and Republicans' war with themselves.
@thefix Basically, Senate Dems have 8-10 seats in Trump states they have to spend significant energy defending. That's not going to be easy
