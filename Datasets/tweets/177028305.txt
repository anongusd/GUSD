POTUS said yesterday he doesn't "see any reason why" Russia would be meddling in election.		TODAY, Trump says he reviewed the transcript &amp; clip of his answer and wants to clarify. "I said the word would instead of wouldn't." 		Here is the context of the remark from WH transcript. https://t.co/y6d3HfaNTF
While Trump says he accepts the intel community assessment that meddling took place, he says it could be other people also. (Per WH pool)		That statement is a contradiction given the intel community concluded that RUSSIA meddled.
Per @PressSec: "Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was at the White House today for routine meetings. He did not meet with the President while he was here."
