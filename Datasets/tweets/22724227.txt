Had great time chatting with neighbors at Super Neighborhood 22 - Washington Ave/Memorial meeting where we discussed noise &amp; traffic issues. Learned about rogue @Airbnb renter that rents homes in our area to host huge parties without permission of homeowners. #houcouncil https://t.co/Ju0TJFCpcV
Campaign kickoff at @barMVSC was a massive success. We had 100+ people show up to show their support! Grateful to have so many friends and supporters on our team. Together, we will bring common sense, responsive leadership to City Hall for District C. #houcouncil https://t.co/4OWCa9BAoz

@ateas @Steve4Sac Safety would be my first concern here too.  Along with people leaving them in places they are not meant to go.  It's worked great some places and horribly others.
Had conversation with Council Member @Steve4Sac of Sacramento today about dock-less bikes &amp; scooters. Sac has done a great job holding companies accountable, finding new ways to make the system work. Would you like to see them here in Houston to help with traffic/density issues?
Packed house for the @HGLBTCaucus monthly meeting last night! Glad they gave us some time to talk about our campaign. #houcouncil https://t.co/yYGbnrPQER
Should the City of Houston explore private sector options for garbage and recycling pickup to increase efficiency and save tax dollars? @ChronOpinion outlined a possible solution to our mounting trash and recycling collection problems. https://t.co/1epYdkrOrO #hounews #houcouncil
Could lead to a prickly situation.  No? https://t.co/H8ZF0sfftb
Getting out of the car and onto the bike today!  It is so nice out. Riding to the @HoustonAutoShow then to @MFAH to catch the last day of the Royals exhibit.  Anyone else going today or have tips for things to see at either? üö≤‚òÄÔ∏è @BikeHouston #bikerider #MFAH #HoustonAutoShow
Had the pleasure of getting a tour of @LegacyCommunity Health in Montrose today. Legacy is doing good work, serving our community by providing quality health services to those with unmet healthcare needs. https://t.co/lOMk5A8eR0
With your support, and a small amount of your time, we will be successful in November! Your help goes a long way towards reaching the voters of District C and translates into the votes we need to win this race. #houcouncil		Get involved today: https://t.co/fxf22OmxTq
Well deserved! I'm so proud of the city that raised me. I will always strive to make Houston even better than it is today. https://t.co/CalJH2fwew #hounews

Hey neighbors! Here is the Houston Marathon @HoustonMarathon route map for Sunday January 20. Good luck to those running, and make sure to alter your Sunday morning drive if you are out an about. #houstonmarathon https://t.co/gLYEkxcX3y
Timely trash pick-up is a core City service. Renting trucks in short run is not most effective use of taxpayer dollars. City must plan for future &amp; use technology to fullest extent to ensure Solid Waste department can do its job for Houstonians. #hounews https://t.co/RjPlyUSxMi
@ragendoyle Thanks @ragendoyle! You know how difficult these things can be. We're working really hard! Thanks for your support!
Surpassed first fundraising goal of campaign and out raised all other non-incumbent district city council candidates. Can't stop now. By working together, we can accomplish great things for District C and the people of Houston. #houston #houcouncil #hounews https://t.co/5AnFwWlxvs
