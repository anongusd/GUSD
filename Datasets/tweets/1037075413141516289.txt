@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg PS. Robert Byrd was in that Southern Democrat group AND also in the Klan.  He remained a serving Dem and friend of the Clintons until he died in 2010.  He never switched. https://t.co/GMTuNRSNjl
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Sorry, your proof is an article from an organization made up of college students and professors from Liberal institutions?  Hmmm.  Thought you said the rule was "credible sources"?
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg weak.  Every issue I talked about is easily verified.  Not wanting to look at things and think for yourself is how this party of sheep has been created for Democrats.	https://t.co/qITqH0sdrS
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg What?  Where is the lie?  He opposed the public Democrat position, the 40% who did not want the Civil Rights Act and voted that way.  At that time refers to the HOPE that Dems don't still feel that same way, but maybe I'm wrong about that... maybe they still want to oppress.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Then correct me. Tell me we have record high unemployment, MORE people on welfare, worse economy, and have not created millions of new jobs.  Then show me a source that proves that.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg I didn't say it was false.  I commented that he shared the same opinions as Republicans did at that time, as opposed to the Democrats who challenged passing the Civil Rights Act in 1964.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Jobs and GDP are record-breaking as well.  Coupled with the stock market, that does give you a measure of the economy.  New jobs being created, wages climbing, bring-home pay increasing due to lower taxes... all these things stimulate an economy or prove its' strength.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Right, that's you.  In the rest of the world, MILLIONS of people care about that issue. However, not ONE SINGLE Democrat attended the historic event in Jerusalem NOR the ceremony in DC for it.  Not even one.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg What? Google "record unemployment in US" and read your choice of articles from ANY news source.  Numbers are facts.  This is undisputed and easy to find, I do not spoon-feed even if you Liberals need that.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg FACT:  Eliminated the ObamaCare Individual Mandate PENALTY... because people who couldn't afford insurance sure couldn't afford penalties.  Thanks Obama.  I liked my doctor, but I couldn't keep him.. couldn't pay for Affordable Care... &amp; now you're taking part of my tax return?
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg FACT:  Record stock market, currently the top economy in the world, and BILLIONS of dollars have RETURNED to our country with companies who had left the US because of over-regulation &amp; out of control taxes.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg FACT: Right-to-Try Legislation passed which has potential to save THOUSANDS of lives &amp; something people have been trying to get passed for YEARS.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg FACT: Record low unemployment with 4 MILLION new jobs created. Record low for minorities &amp; youths, plus lowest in decades for women &amp; Veterans.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg OK, let's play.	FACT: Trump moved our US Embassy to Jerusalem.  This was something promised by several Presidents preceding him, Repub &amp; Dem, but none of them made it happen.  Please tell me how this is bad, racist, and anti-semitic.
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Considering that I see no point in wasting my time with some brain-washed "Orange man bad" liberal AND the fact that you look old, you probably will.
but he's still there??!!!  If this guy was a Republican, he would be removed and probably in prison or worse by now! https://t.co/xRHXunHGuz
@BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg So where is the progress?  Even a black President from the party did nothing to help minorities, actually made many things worse.  Dems have run Chicago since 1931.. should at least be seeing part of a Coliseum by now. 4 years now with at least 1 shooting a day in Chicago??!!
@Cam79Smith @BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg Excellent response.  Always best to revert to that shit when presented when facts that don't fit the narrative.  Remember, all the Dems LOVED Trump when he was registered as a Dem &amp; giving them money.  üôÑ
@BrookeTony @theAGGRESSI0N @factcheckdotorg In 1965 the country swallowed a magic pill &amp; the parties switched mentalities? OR Dems began publicly pandering for the black vote while actually doing nothing for them. Look at all Dem controlled areas (NY, CA, Chicago, etc).. all failing &amp; some of the worst areas for minorities
@MK_MAQ12 @factcheckdotorg like the guys who attacked Jussie Smollett? Like Gov. Northam? No	Racism doesn't belong to a political party, but is found in people from any or no political affiliation. Trying to label it Republican is either ignorance OR a way to conceal personal racism by pointing a finger.

@LarrySchweikart @RepSwalwell The Capital building is only 750 ft long. The Cap Police (used to guard it) cost $375M+ a yr PLUS all the other equip (cameras, scanners, etc)	Trump wants 550 miles of Wall. That's 2,904,000 ft long	Cap Police cost $500K a FOOT to protect, so ur way would cost $1,452,000,000,000

@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw they certainly are.. Like "MAGA hats are the new white hood" that's all over Twitter now
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw SO answer the question, why do walls work in the cities/countries that use them? Why did Dems agree to GIVE Jordan $500 MILLION to build a border wall there if they don't work.. are immoral.. or a waste of tax money?  The money they gave away WAS our tax money.
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw I don't struggle to understand much, so we can delve into whatever complexity you want to explore. Your example of Steve King has been used many times by Dems to "expose" that all Repubs are racist.  Not sure if you are on Twitter much, but that message is pretty easy to find.
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw Hell, Don Lemon on CNN called Kanye a dumb token negro for supporting Trump, and everyone accepted that. A white kid in a Maga hat smirks and his whole school is getting death/bomb threats.  Dems have lost their minds.
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw I've been called racist NUMEROUS times &amp; that's far from true. The center-Dem is all but extinct, if you are not a fringe liberal on topics/policies, then they will turn on you as well! Try it, discuss your gun rights with fellow Dems on here &amp; see how it goes.
@JackPosobiec Isn't that their only department?
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw Then why do the walls of Israel, San Diego, El Paso, Tuscon, Yuma work? If bad, why did Dems agree 2 weeks ago to give Jordan $500M to build a border wall there?  This is just BS political grandstanding.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw Twitch is missing you
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw MANY countries do, &amp; we have MANY border cities WITH WALLS already! More people illegally overstay, but millions enter thru the border.. along w/ drugs &amp; child/sex traffickers w/ their victims. Hard to fly in w/ hostages. If u could be reasonable &amp; not just anti-Trump, u'd agree
@Alyssa_Milano finally a chance to quote @AOC		"zero"
@NYGovCuomo also from dad - killing babies is alright.	quite a legacy... wonder how many babies have been killed under the watch of the Cuomo family?
@ewarren like @SpeakerPelosi ?
Overcorrection? Catholic Cuomo has moved to abort babies so that they won't be molested if born.
@RepSwalwell Just checked it, Eric Acosta... it appears to have walls on all sides... AND guards, cameras, and BARRIERS.  	Hmm, Trump proposed more people, cameras, drones, barriers... AND walls		The difference? We can't have guards every 50 feet on the border like they do at the Capital.

@AdamSchiff Speaking of wasting our tax dollars, when do we get the details on the sexual harassment/assault  settlements made by our elected officials in secret using our tax dollars.  Lots of people saying YOU are on that list.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw how about anti-legals?  Saying "people who broke the law and snuck across our borders" is such a mouthful.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw Reported by Texas DPS- 251,000 aliens booked into Texas jails between 6/11 &amp; 4/18	Charged w/over 663,000 offenses:	1,351 homicides	7,156 sexual assaults	9,938 weapons charges	79,049 assaults	18,685 burglaries	79,900 drug charges	815 kidnappings	44,882 thefts	4,292 robberies
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw 3,000 killed then.  Estimated 65,000 killed by illegals in the US, plus the rapes and violent crimes.  If we could stop 10% of that, it's worth the money... 10% is DOUBLE the amount killed on 9/11
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw That was a non-partisan fact checking site.  Here's NPR from 2000 up: https://t.co/2Vz1AHTNtm
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw According to the media and liberals, all white men are racists.. all MAGA people are.. all Republicans are.. all Angel Families are... and apparently Trump-supporting blacks are too.  That's MILLIONS of supposed racists.
@Divisionisweak @Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw It appears to be the mass immigration that has caused the problems all throughout Europe.

@charliekirk11 https://t.co/J2tSVHgI9F
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw Why does the wall work in the cities we built it?	Israel‚Äîillegal immigration down 99%	San Diego‚Äîdown 92%	El Paso‚Äîdown 95%	Tucson‚Äîdown 90%	Yuma‚Äîdown 95%		The need to dig, climb, cut adds cost and time to the effort.. which makes it more likely to fail.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw They just cut them a payroll check like they would have normally done... the same way they get the back-pay for all this time when it does open back.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw Yep, that part needs fixed too. Most is a lot, but the hundreds of thousands who do cross the border is important too.
@BobBrinson1 It no longer IS murder in NY w/ Cuomo's new law!!! If no object is used that could cause the woman's death (bat, pipe, etc), then the assailant could punch a pregnant woman in the stomach, kill her unborn child, and be charged with misdemeanor assault &amp; face a fine.

@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw This was just to pay the employees, no wall attached.
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw It's not mine, that's a liberal site.. sent it to prove that the event happened. They can call it a stunt, but fact is they voted to not pay workers TWICE. Why would they not want these people to get paid?

@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw I read it. Also read the Army Corp of Engineers one &amp; I've seen 2/3 others.. vary on degrees of cost &amp; estimation of labor/design it would take for the wall.. this $5.7B is for specific areas with that estimate based on the steel design. It's 0.1% of our budget, why not give it?
@Bobgx2 @Divisionisweak @RepDanCrenshaw Dems voted AGAIN not to pay the Fed workers yesterday, it's not the people they care about.

@perlmutations #DidntWearWell	Just marking this for later...
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw the study is old, not the statement. Those numbers were calculated 2 yrs ago when the wall talk started up.  Opponents are bringing it back up to try and use it against Trump.
@Bobgx2 better review, only get jail time on an assault when using a weapon or object that could have caused death.. like if someone attacked a person with a bat... punching a preggo with a fist or kicking would not apply to that rule because the unborn baby has zero value now
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris If they had something, it would've leaked to the Press by now... it's been years
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw That's old.. it was up to $49B for a sea to sea concrete wall at 25 ft... not the case for what they are doing now... steel barriers in selected areas is much cheaper
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw which they will not allow him to use to build or extend the wall.
@Bobgx2 Yes, arrested.. and charged with a misdemeanor.. released and pay a fine.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris When did you see Mueller's files?
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw It's not enough. We are currently building/adding wall, but it's a 2 year project to complete and needs $5.7B to fill in all the areas that the Border Patrol have asked for.
@Bobgx2 Nope, only assault now. A misdemeanor.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Not been proven, even after 2 years of trying to. BUT even if it was, it was done by his lawyer Cohen, not Trump.  AND it should just be a fine, exactly like Obama got when he did it for $100K. There is no difference.
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw He wants to expand the existing wall and build where we have no wall, that's all.  You can look up the map of existing wall and proposed additions online.
@Bobgx2 The law made abortion until birth legal AND stopped the previous protections of unborn child like being able to charge someone with murder that assaulted &amp; caused the unborn's death, now you can only charge assault. This law does both.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris No, it is not. If the funds were pulled from the wrong account, it's illegal, but that's the only way. Obama pulled funds from the wrong account (over $100K) during his election.. paid a fine and moved on.
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw That's what Trump is asking for?!!  Pelosi says walls are immoral and won't allow its' expansion!
@Bobgx2 Heartbeat starts at 6 weeks... fetus can survive birth at 22 weeks... can now be aborted up to birth moment.  No longer counts as murder if you attack a preg woman and kill her unborn child, just an assault with this new law.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris No, it's not.  Your tax dollars have paid out over $15 Million in hush money for current serving Congress and Senate people. Paying off people to be quiet in legal document is not illegal.
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw what about the areas with NO wall? The towns asking for it? Pelosi don't care because she HAS a wall.  Built in the 90's and it dropped illegal entry by over 90%. It works there and the other major cities we built it. Why should these other cities have no protection?
@Bobgx2 with this new law. what is now assault (punching preggo in stomach and killing baby) used to be murder.  In addition, it allows abortion up until birth.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris She knowingly screwed a married man for personal gain. Stormy knowingly screwed a married man for personal gain (the money came in 2016 with the Hush Agreement, not paid as a hooker).  Both were whores.
@Bobgx2 @RepDanCrenshaw Please explain why NOT have a wall &amp; what we should do for border protection.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Nope, especially not for Democrats.
@Bobgx2 Right, it used to be considered and punished as murder.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris 13 years ago
@perlmutations guess it's true.. apes throw their feces
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Then why are Democrats so obsessed with Stormy Daniels and Trump's past?
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Nope, just Biblical and Civil law
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris He was the Speaker of the California Assembly when they dated... he is always referred to as "Mayor Brown" and "Mayor Willie".
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Get married &amp; get a mistress. During the divorce hearings, tell them you were just dating this woman on the side, not having any sexual activity.  Let me know how that goes.
@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Why do I get the feeling you're 12? Dating is grown up speak for sexual activity. It does say he was married while they were "dating". So now there's a whore time limit? Did u say that when they tried to go back 30+ yrs on Kavanaugh? He gave her a high paying job while "dating"

@Bobgx2 @perlmutations @KamalaHarris Defamation is a false statement that exposes to ridicule. Her sexual exploits with Mayor Willie (while he was married) are well known and not news. It is general knowledge that he gave her a job paying over $100K while she slept with him. She would have to prove that false.
@perlmutations @KamalaHarris congrats Kamala, you got his vote and his two friends (relatives).  How's it feel to get something without performing a sexual favor? https://t.co/Md4nAO7ApP

@charliekirk11 with an estimated 65,000 Americans killed by illegals, the $5.7B request from Trump means each of those lives was NOT worth $87,000 each to @SpeakerPelosi or @TheDemocrats
@RedNationRising Punching a pregnant woman in the stomach and killing her baby is now only a misdemeanor assault, punished by a fine.  It used to be murder, but this new law cancels that since the fetus is no longer recognized as a person!

ü§£ https://t.co/80xbHVaTFI
@realannapaulina AND now if you punch a pregnant woman in the stomach and kill the baby, it's a misdemeanor assault punishable by a fine... the law negates recognizing the unborn baby as a person, so there can not be any additional charges to the criminal!

Look at the facts here:	https://t.co/K0RG3NYLAy	Don't let Pelosi sell us a BS plan!
Drones detected 21,384 suspected border crossers from 2014-2016. Yet during this time, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 1.2 million people while an estimated 570,000 evaded capture. In other words, drones may have detected at most 1.2 percent of total illegal border crossings.
Pelosi says drones are the smart way. They can only fly in good weather, cost $12K per hour to fly, cost $17M each to buy, and the ones in use only spotted 0.5% of the illegals that crossed from 2014-2016.  How can this possibly be the smart choice? @realDonaldTrump #BuildTheWall

@laurama61178079 @ChelseaClinton Yes, this outbreak linked is being called "travel-associated" with Israel and "other nations" according to their spokesperson.  The serious measles outbreak in Brazil came from Venezuelan immigrants (same people coming here).  The TB is also a Central &amp; South American problem.
@puzzled_yet @ChelseaClinton the rise is 0.4% according to the CDC. Illegal immigration affects every state.  Read about Brazil's issue with measles (far more cases than us) coming in from Venezuelan immigrants.  Same people come here.  Also look at our spike in TB in all border states. Common sense.
@AdjoryT @ChelseaClinton as I just stated, the CDC says the amount of kids not being vaccinated has only risen 0.4% from where it was years ago.

I have decided to go to Mexico &amp; sneak back into the US. This will allow me to get free stuff (housing, healthcare, education, welfare, etc) AND if I commit a crime, I can just get pardoned for it. Plus, I can still vote. Not really seeing a down side. ü§î

@JTIME14 @OsopePatrisse @rkelly too many accusers and too much strange behavior on MJ's part for me not to believe it. People defended Cosby too.  Their talents had nothing to do with this side of them. MJ was an amazing musician, but he had issues. He had DOZENS of accusers, not 3.

@richmond_ekiye @OsopePatrisse @rkelly Incorrect. The FBI provided technical support for California police investigators for SOME of the allegations made in 1993-4 &amp; 2004-5, but did not conduct any investigation themselves. Plus, the settled cases were not part of these investigations.

@jericho602 @krassenstein That "fact" stated by Beto was disproved... that was based on a 2011 report comparing it against 6 major cities (NY, LA, etc), so they dropped that claim.  Later FBI stats showed higher crime rates... beating Baltimore in rape, etc. There are warnings for tourists at night there!
@krassenstein So to back YOUR point, you chose San Diego?  An area that has a wall... built in 1992... and has seen a documented drop of 92% in illegal crossings since it was built.  Thanks for making the point of how great it is there, maybe we should build walls EVERYWHERE on the border!

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Dems spout BS &amp; never look at facts. $5B would give teachers a raise of $100 a month.. &amp; leave ZERO to build modern schools.

@krassenstein Dismal... 5 out of Obama's 8 years had below those numbers?  So you admit he was "dismal" for the economy?
@BernieSanders OR the other option is lay-offs and less new jobs.... expecting more work from fewer employees and taxes bump to cover the new unemployment and welfare claims.
@BernieSanders in other news, the costs of all goods from retailers to restaurants will increase by 25% to cover this new expense to businesses. Remember, they're not charities &amp; will not just give money away, they increase prices to cover this loss. Result is $15 hr becomes the same as $8 hr!
@KamalaHarris 500,000 homeless AMERICANS in our country, with 140,000 in YOUR STATE @SenKamalaHarris ... what if you put the same energy into saving our own citizens that you do for illegals?  CA homeless rate has been INCREASING under YOUR watch!
ZERO gov't funds to illegal aliens in or at our borders UNTIL THE WALL IS FUNDED!  No money for healthcare, housing, welfare, food stamps, school, etc.  ABSOLUTELY ZERO DOLLARS @realDonaldTrump 	Make the Dems choose between border security and free-loading illegals

@krassenstein Um, Mr. "Reporter"	During the hearing, which took place on 13 December 2018, financial investigators Lawerence Doyle &amp; John Moynihan, w/ MDA Analytics, told Chairman Mark Meadows that FBI agents told Doyle that there's "an open &amp; ongoing investigation" into the Clinton Foundation
@DebraMessing @RepAdamSchiff Mueller, our "Special" Investigator is the one who signed off on and approved the deal.  Bill Clinton has DOZENS of documented trips to Epstein's "Lolita Island", and the deal Mueller gave shut all this down &amp; protected Clinton.  He's good at covering Clintons. Think about that.

@alliegata @maddow @MiamiHerald @jkbjournalist It's public record.  This came out originally with the story years ago, but like now, the MSM and liberals chose to ignore it because it was against their party and the Clintons.  You just keep resistin'
@alliegata @maddow @MiamiHerald @jkbjournalist That heavily includes the Clintons (Bill, Hillary, AND the Foundation).  Bill went to the private island 26 times and excluded his Secret Service detail for 5 of those trips.  That is why this was swept under the rug.  Meuller tied to it, which is why he keeps Clintons protected
@maddow @MiamiHerald @jkbjournalist What about the man who signed off on the deal.... Meuller?  What should happen to him?

@ZNEWSNET @Alyssa_Milano - MeToo was a great premise... ultimately destroyed when touched by Democrats.  It's time to either drop it or go after the Dem side as hard as you have Repubs... otherwise you are telling the world that MeToo was just a partisan movement that exploited women!

@MiltShook When you're done, give Juanita Broaddrick @atensnut a call... maybe she can help you understand a little better.
@kathygriffin @StormyDaniels you mean Avenatti and the hundreds of guys who poked her in the a$$ at her job?
@ellenfrich @Kwakhan03679240 @tariqnasheed I think they are a$$holes too.  Ogun righting the universe by having an inbreeding tribe of Indian people kill a kid.. and the tribes people on the next island over?  If people commenting didn't mistakenly think this tribe was African, they wouldn't care at all about them.
@ellenfrich @Kwakhan03679240 @tariqnasheed Not a monopoly, just one of the worst offenders in modern times.	What does food resources and migration to America have to do with anything in this?	https://t.co/xZE9SHwQKi
@ellenfrich @Kwakhan03679240 @tariqnasheed what does that have to do with slavery not existing in Africa? I don't disagree that slavery has been all over the world, by all races, and OF all races &amp; it's ALL bad. This whole talk is off course. A dumb kid got killed &amp; ppl happy b/c he was white, that was where this started
@Kwakhan03679240 @ellenfrich @tariqnasheed really?	Thought there were some pyramids there?	And the modern day slavery going on has no American or white involvement.	I think sometimes help is just help, not an attempt to take anything. Just because some people are racist doesn't mean ALL people are. https://t.co/LFc4WAHTNG
@RepSpeier So we KNOW he's a liar, no doubt about that since he has told two versions.  Of course Democrats will only choose to believe the version that's anti-Trump. üôÑ How can you KNOW which lie is true?
@kathygriffin @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump Wonder who's career and notoriety will end first... Trumps or yours?  My guess is yours... again.  Of course with Trump, you have no material and the trinkets you sell become worthless... kind of doomed either way
@jermologist @tariqnasheed They are citizens of India, governed and protected by India, and located in the territory of India?  And the invasion you speak of was by India, nothing to do with whites. India opened them up for "safaris", nothing to do with religion.
@jermologist @3ngmath3matic @tariqnasheed The non-whites who travel in our group... are they also racists?  Corrupt racists like Malema aren't going to solve problems, just create new ones.
@KeenanCook1922 @jermologist @tariqnasheed I said it was racist to label something "white-washed" especially when meant as derogatory.  I think it's racist to be happy a guy was killed because he was white. Most of the people making the comment don't even realize this tribe isn't black, they're from India.
@Kwakhan03679240 @ellenfrich @tariqnasheed Africa STILL has SLAVERY!  If you feel that slavery is part of that solution, as it was during this "enlightened" period you speak of, then that is part of the problem.
@jermologist @tariqnasheed Where is your proof of this?  It's a small group of India that has been inbreeding for generations and attack all people (black, white, &amp; brown) and even the tribe from the next island.
@Rome924 @tariqnasheed Colonizing is when people inhabit and control an area... surely you can't think that is the case?  The people who were born there barely want to inhabit it, and there is no society of missionaries hoping to take over and occupy the land.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed so you've seen famine... liquifying organs from hazardous diseases... Boko Haram steal children &amp; rape them... and believe that the Western world and acid are what makes Africa bad?  If so, why don't we have all the same problems in America.. using same food &amp; medicine
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed You go to church to worship and for the fellowship.  Not sure of your religious beliefs, but most have worship involved.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed So your family had a choice of Africa or America... WHY did they pick America?
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Believers want people to know the love of God, but accept that not everyone will become a believer.  The trips are as much humanitarian as they are religious.  Maybe you should visit there and see what it is really like, especially outside the cities.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Got it.  So you have never lived in Africa, but are speaking as though you have. Instead, your family came to America... wonder why?  Wasn't for better plants. No idea what "my form" of terrorism is?
@DebraMessing This story has been buried because no one wanted to explain why Bill Clinton was documented as flying to Orgy Island over a dozen times (along w/ one of the sex slaves testifying to him being there), nor wants to look at the fact Mueller is the one who signed off on Epsteins deal
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed It is also hard to move someone lacking the capabilities to realize when they're wrong.  One day you may want to ask yourself why, if the Western world is so bad, you choose to live in America when you own a home &amp; could be in Africa.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Ok then. 	Good luck with life.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed what medical school did you attend?
@3ngmath3matic @Christ_watchdog @jermologist @tariqnasheed that number is dropping about 500,000 per year... is that because of increased plants because you just said plants are not being used?
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Yes, I'm a fool. Advil is what's destroying Africa... not Boko Haram, corrupt officials, nor the fact that there is STILL SLAVERY there!  üôÑ  You are free to believe however you choose, so I wish you well.
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed If you think medicine hasn't advanced beyond plant roots, then there is no way I can talk logic with you.  Over 5 million deaths a year are preventable in Africa, the nation is lucky that people want to help
@3ngmath3matic @Christ_watchdog @jermologist @tariqnasheed In 2015- 5.2 million of deaths (56.4%)- causes:	lower respiratory tract infections (1 million),	HIV/AIDS (760,000),	diarrhoeal diseases (643,000),	tuberculosis (434,000) &amp;	malaria (403,000).		Plants seem to be failing.
@Alyssa_Milano @GOP @realDonaldTrump Is this the 1st you've heard of this?  They hushed this up quick.  No one wanted public trial asking why Bill Clinton went to the private sex island over a dozen times!  Dems don't want to talk about Mueller's role in this deal either!
@3ngmath3matic @Christ_watchdog @jermologist @tariqnasheed So your belief is that things like AIDs and EBOLA came from the vaccines GIVEN to Africa?  Eating a plant root don't fix Polio, but the Western medicine took care of it... you're welcome!
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Thriving where/when?  Maybe in Egypt during the reign of Pharaohs... thriving for them, but in large part because of slavery?  I don't know what part of Africa you live in, but my family is there every year and have never been unwanted or unappreciated.. nor has our medicine hurt
@krassenstein Does that come with a participation trophy?
@3ngmath3matic @Christ_watchdog @jermologist @tariqnasheed Disease, poverty, lack of education &amp; opportunity, and the terrorists like Boko Haram ruling territories is what's destroying Africa... it's not missionaries.
@ellenfrich @tariqnasheed Lesson learned... leave the inbreeding islanders alone.  No argument here.  But Africa left alone would destroy itself.  It MUST have the aid from all of the world to survive, it barely survives with BILLIONS in money, medicine, and development help!
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed The West destroyed Africa... when is this great period in African history that you allude to?  The country has always been struggling... people starving... dying of diseases rapidly... the Western world is the only thing that sustains the nation with the BILLIONS of $ it gives
@3ngmath3matic @jermologist @tariqnasheed Africa has suffered because of missionaries?  Guessing you have never been.  Africa suffers from corrupt gov't, lack of education, lack of medicine, lack of industry, &amp; no money.  People trying to give hope AND provide these basic life necessities to them are not bad.

@NotTheHelp @tariqnasheed Africa STILL has slavery, it's just not talked about since it is black on black.  There are no missionaries buying/selling Africans, but they are building schools, hospitals, water supply systems, and teaching how to grow food.
@jermologist @tariqnasheed "white-washed" Christianity üôÑ  Do you even recognize YOUR racism?  Missionaries don't talk about race, they talk about God. They also provide schools, food, medicine, and clean water to these same people.  Better to let them starve &amp; die than to have a white man help?
@RodWill51490738 @tariqnasheed Probably the wrong person to ask. I see no problem with people sharing the knowledge of God, not to mention that the same missionaries often work to provide schools, food, medicine, &amp; clean water to the people as they share their message. More than 99% of the people do for Africa
Did I miss something?  When did Democrats full on become the Pedocrats?	Hearing this stuff constantly! https://t.co/2CvUtZj7tL

@Alohatruth @tariqnasheed It's in the comments.	Tariq ALWAYS talks racism, but he is probably one of the most racist people I've seen on Twitter to be honest.
@JDKnicks @tariqnasheed "Good. One less cracker in the box" is one of the comments. HOW am I taking that out of context?  I just don't like ignorant racism.. from any race.
@Alohatruth @tariqnasheed Again, I don't support the move, but I don't celebrate that there's a dead missionary because he is white and credit a "god" who "crawled down a spider web to earth" and taught people to use iron  üôÑ
@JDKnicks @tariqnasheed I'm not saying it was smart, but no reason to celebrate. There are laws against speeding, jaywalking, underage drinking, etc... doesn't mean we celebrate when someone dies doing them. A missionary's goal is to save souls &amp; introduce to God, nothing more to gain.
@tariqnasheed If u celebrate a missionary being killed by a tribe of inbred &amp; uneducated people, u might need to examine urself. What if the missionary were black?

@krassenstein who cares about HIS tax records?  I wish Democrats would realize they need to give a shit about THE PEOPLE's tax records.. worry about our income and well-being for a change!  Do something for the people besides just piss away our tax dollars (&amp; ask for more) chasing Trump FFS!
@kathygriffin pathetic. The "big win" is that u can subpoena his tax record? What's the point? Recognize, the Kavanaugh accusers are getting exposed as liars.. the Mueller investigation has NOTHING, no Russia collusion exists except for Hillary's.. crooked DOJ being exposed.. 2020 is all TRUMP

@BlueVetsExist @tedcruz The Christian American thing for U to do is pay all my bills... share your Visa # with me, and I will let you pay for all my stuff since you expect us to do that for these people. I have 2 kids w/ college coming, illegals get that free, u paying for me? Mexico beats Honduras, yes
@BlueVetsExist @tedcruz like the US during WW2. Transnationalism (Obama &amp; Merkel) proved horrible, look at what's happening to Germany! All Trump is saying is America First, simple. U want to throw money to illegals &amp; yet let Veterans sleep on the street? Thousands are homeless, lets take care of them
@BlueVetsExist @tedcruz I thank u for ur service, but ur words do not sound like someone who loves this country, more like loved.

Kavanaugh story isn't over yet! Now his accusers admitting that they LIED... MADE IT UP... and even that creepy porn lawyer CHANGED their written testimony!  Haven't heard ONE APOLOGY from any Dem that was on TV calling him a rapist for weeks?  MSM &amp; Dems owe that man an apology!

@rucker_gary @krassenstein They agree w/ the overage in those counties, but add he doesn't account for ALL counties in the US (where there are shortages) &amp; he counts inactive voters. Of course he does, inactive voters aren't prohibited from voting, just marketing &amp; Dems go crazy when u purge them like GA

@rucker_gary @RozzaKat13 @AndrewGillum @RonDeSantisFL @ScottforFlorida Right, the guy he has known since college and lived with... had no idea he was racist üôÑ  You guys have to fight common sense so often to try and find a way to defend yourselves.  If this guy talked like this to a stranger, I am pretty confident he said this &amp; more to his friends

Thanks to @RozzaKat13 for sharing the best "response to a Democrat" meme ever! https://t.co/HSq3aWzIRi
@RozzaKat13 @rucker_gary @AndrewGillum LMAO!
@rucker_gary @RozzaKat13 @AndrewGillum You think political affiliation is the equivalent of being racist or homophobic??  Yeah, you're definitely a Democrat.
@rucker_gary @RozzaKat13 @AndrewGillum maybe mixed in to the supporters, but not the ones running for office!
@rucker_gary @RozzaKat13 @AndrewGillum Were those people in Trump's inner circle? Because this example is a life-long companion in Gillum's inner circle.  Think of your 5 closest friends... are they racist or homophobic or whatever?  If so, you probably are too, that IS how it works
@rucker_gary @RozzaKat13 @AndrewGillum and I just posted another video of a Gillum supporter taking a DeSantis supporter's phone and breaking it.. after calling her an MFing white and telling her how he hates whites.  Gillum is very racially charged

@CoreDeplorable James O'Keefe-The staffers said "Nobody needs to know" "If u get caught in some sort of violation that's like a $50,000 fine" "For me I can just ignore the rules &amp; I'm like f**k it" Transporting Aliens to "airports bus stations,""None of this is like sh*t there is a rulebook for"

@RangerDainko @swin24 They did not debunk it, just posted a response that Beto gave them. The video alludes to more than just a single occurrence &amp; there's already 1 false statement in the Tribune.. Beto says some staffers took it upon themselves, but his campaign manager is one of the people on video
@RangerDainko @swin24 "violates FEC‚Äôs rules on personal use &amp; misreporting... violates Section 1001, making a false statement to the federal government. The FEC violations... fines of up to $10,000 or 200% of funds involved. Violations Section 1001 are criminal &amp; include imprisonment of up to 5 yrs.‚Äù

@Rollo_Lawson_ @Truthseekerpre1 @tariqnasheed I see racism on all sides, but it's less now than ever been in my lifetime. We can't wipe it out except w/ time &amp; doing better now. As a white guy married to a minority, I've seen racism from all sides. I voted for Obama, but realized I had been fooled. Trump is no reg politician
@Rollo_Lawson_ @Truthseekerpre1 @tariqnasheed what did Dems do for blacks in their 8 yrs?  What are they offering now?
@Rollo_Lawson_ @Truthseekerpre1 @tariqnasheed Prison reform targeted towards over-incarceration of minorities. Trumps 2nd chance program offering incentives to hire ex-cons.

@Truthseekerpre1 @Rollo_Lawson_ @tariqnasheed There are racists in all parties, doesn't mean whole party is.

@Rollo_Lawson_ @Truthseekerpre1 @tariqnasheed Don't be blind to the racism of Dems. They started the KKK &amp; somehow convinced everyone they magically changed overnight? Read books about the Secret Service guarding Clintons, talk about always using N-words in their house. Trump helping minorities &amp; real racists hate him for it
@Truthseekerpre1 @Rollo_Lawson_ @tariqnasheed Look from the other side. what has 54 yrs of voting Dem done 4 minorities? Dems know they get the vote &amp; fail 2 earn it yr after yr.

@PatriciaJean00 @krassenstein Chelsea is not even a politician?!  What about the people embracing him above? What about his friend Keith Ellison?  No denouncement from them.  Twitter was asked to ban him or atleast remove that video he posted and they refused.

@AnnaknikkiMicou @tariqnasheed @FucckkkTrump Sorry, I'm not debating the movement of X's politics.. I was talking about the current mindset of minority voters having this allegiance to Democrats that has not paid off. Blindly accepting their words &amp; opposing Reps makes no sense.  Think we were on two different tracks.
@AnnaknikkiMicou @tariqnasheed @FucckkkTrump I let people interpret history however they choose, but we are making the history our children &amp; grandchildren will study. It would just be nice for them to learn that no one had allegiance to some party b/c of race, but instead fought for ideas that helped everyone.
@AnnaknikkiMicou @tariqnasheed @FucckkkTrump if your mindset is that now, over 50 yrs after his death, that blacks in America are "house vs field"... then that says he, nor any other leader of the time, accomplished nothing. Division by race and within race is a failure of any people.
@AnnaknikkiMicou @tariqnasheed @FucckkkTrump of course, you erroneously quote him and I will refrain.  Not sure how you see the last 54 yrs of blindly following the Democrats has paid off for any minority though.

Did you support theirs.. drug dealers, pedos, etc?  If the discussion is policies, it's hard to fight Trump on results
@DannyRonan @krassenstein Trickle down DOES work. Rich people own companies.. they create jobs &amp; their income determines wages. The Dems fight the wrong way, force $15 hr min wage &amp; the biz doesn't give up those profits, they just raise their prices to compensate. Top down forces competition &amp; better pay

@DannyRonan @krassenstein So, what policies are anti-American or racist? He's been in office 2 yrs with 92% negative reporting, surely you can think of 2 or 3. Meanwhile, Black support has grown from normal 10% for Reps to now 37% by latest polls. Dems have done nothing for the minority voters, even Obama
@DannyRonan @krassenstein Bigots &amp; racists have been around hundreds of yrs. Remember, Dems were pro-slavery &amp; started the KKK. The NRA offered protection to blacks at the polls.  No one supports racism &amp; I have never seen a policy that excludes other races (like my wife). I'm not rich, but better off now
@widlits @krassenstein if innocent, I feel pretty confident they would have been, but I trust the FBI
@DannyRonan @krassenstein Other than family discourse, you have nothing that Trump policy has done to you?  You have hated on Trump for 2 yrs &amp; have nothing but an order from 5 days ago? Btw, don't think that's an Exec Order.
@DannyRonan @krassenstein He caused discourse w/ your family &amp; friends?

@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein Thanks, followed you. Always appreciate a respectful and fact based debate.
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein I would support a healthcare plan for all that we have a way to pay for OR just one with reasonable costs.. like the cheap plans our government officials get! I don't think either party has a real solution yet though
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein No, limited, but I know 2 people who are. Both made this decision after bad incidents... one a rape and the other was molested by a family member, and both would freely say they have issues. It's not a hatred, it's a protection issue for me.
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein Then quit blaming Trump.. blame your Congress
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein The estimated cost of free healthcare is $1.4T (TRILLION) dollars!  That's 1000 times the spending you mentioned.. and that doesn't account for illegals currently estimated at another 29 Million people
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein look at the news stories of Transgender rapes and sexual assaults. There are tons of them. Not b/c they are all pedos, but many have mental issues causing the whole gender confusion. AND pedos CAN go in the ladies room, we're not allowed to question anymore!
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein Don't have to ever worry about making that decision, I have both. Dems had 8 YEARS &amp; did nothing with it. Tell me 8 things Obama did in 8 years that worked good for our country. Healthcare failed &amp; cost more than ever. More illegals than ever. Didn't finish war. Pushed anti-cop
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein why should I have to worry about the ones who are?  What about my daughter's rights to not have a woman with a penis in the bathroom with her?  Like you said, we give rights to some by taking from others... why take from the 98% to give to the 2%?
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein Educate more w/out debt &amp; pay teachers more &amp; free healthcare &amp; higher wages? You are smart enough to know nothing is free, so who &amp; how do we pay for it all? We are doing better now in the global economy, &amp; nationalism is the foundation of Patriotism (see US history pre-Vietnam)
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein how does supporting Amendment 2 revisions, forcing you to pay for insurance, controlling free speech, etc. expand your liberties? Dems have a platform of helping everyone BUT Americans, unless they are one of the other 70 genders they recognize. We need to focus on REAL probs
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein the issues like gender are just b/c it is out of control. I don't want a guy pissing in the bathroom w/ my daughter just b/c he feels like a woman. btw, this is not unreasonable as SEVERAL cases of assault &amp; rape have already happened. We have to calm down this ridiculous PC shit
@BlueVetsExist @krassenstein I believe u have the right to feel that way, just disagree that it is "american" to be anti-POTUS. I have been in 7 countries myself, seen none better than ours, &amp; no matter how much we give the world, people abroad &amp; here make us the bad guys. To me, America 1st is long past due

@kathygriffin THAT is the abuse of power you talk about?  I always thought of abuse as more of what your brother did to his wife and those random children... you sat by and watch that happen, but you are on top of the REAL abuse like this? https://t.co/bF2ccEf3rI

@DebShaw18 @RawStory Now I've figured out who you are. The Trump hate is not effective for me. I have no admiration for his private life, but I do know it happened prior to him being Pres, unlike Clinton. I do admire what he has done for our nation, but you have too much hate to be objective &amp; see it
@DebShaw18 @RawStory I literally just stated their shared positions.. their own words! Aside from the sexual accusations both are facing, neither have publicly commented yet, but both stories emerged in liberal press. There is no conspiracy theory in that.  Memes are funny when they make sense, like https://t.co/l8NLhwTNnE
@FoxNews glad to see that stud Michael Moore settling down! https://t.co/1YRdhMi1MR
@RawStory how could he possibly get you two confused????	both did poor job as mayor	both against ICE	both against borders	both want higher taxes	both support MOBS over JOBS	both anti-Trump	both had homosexual accusations emerge	both hypocrites	Yeah, I can see how that could happen...	#MAGA

@krassenstein You do understand when we raise the tax rates too high on the rich, they simply move their money... bank in foreign countries, establish businesses there, even get citizenship... it's a low effort task they can utilize to dodge this idea. Same way they can find loopholes now

@chelseahandler @PauletteEJordan Elizabeth Warren approved!  Look for her on your ballot NEVADA.

Just add 1st fact you see from Google and post. #SuperActivist
@chelseahandler Yes, make the whole state like San Francisco! Obviously, the app SnapCrap (lets you know about the human poop on the street) would have to expand to cover the whole state. Then we could build a wall around it and Mexico and let you guys deal with your own ideas
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Are those your words?  Or did you plagiarize them like your recipes...Cherokee?

The local candidate that is against this issue has stated this, but feels it is racist because nearly 70% of those removed were black... but the list was comprised of 3 yr, no contact people, all races
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump why would Russia want Trump to win? Since Trump, Repubs &amp; the US have finally stood up to them and assisted the Ukraine... Obama and Dems just let them do whatever the hell they wanted. Remember when they pulled a fighter sub into Cuba when Obama went? Or buzzed the Gulf w/ jets?

@DebraMessing @ACLU @maddow @MaddowBlog @JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes @Lawrence @SRuhle @HardballChris @NBCNews @CBSNews @abcnews @cnnbrk @washingtonpost @HuffPost It makes you look foolish to believe clickbait. ONLY removing people who have not voted or responded to any contact attempts for 3+ yrs (people who have moved &amp; died). If they want, can show ID and re-register w/ no issue. Calm down
@DebraMessing Clickbait! The people are removed from the voter role after 3 years of no voting &amp; no response back to any of the notifications about their impending removal... &amp; simply show their ID to re-register. That is not suppression, that cleaning up files for people who have moved &amp; died
@JBole1 I think it'd be tough to find ANYONE who supports his Twitter usage! Even fans never know what's coming out next! In the end though, that probably has something to do w/ why he won, not the normal politician... he may say something ick, but it's to your face, not behind ur back
@JBole1 PS. who witnessed the "crazy Jew" comment?  Life was a "living hell" with a leaky sink?  Sounds like major 1st world problems.  It's a lot of work to try and distort every little thing into something else.  Just relax and enjoy the success of America for a change
@JBole1 Do u think? I think there's plenty of unsavory in his past, but he's done a lot of good since taking office. The country's on a positive track for the 1st time in a long time. I'd just like to see the country support our Pres, it was never this bad from Rep when Obama was Pres
@Kerrynann @krassenstein I didn't pose the question about the proof? It seems pretty obvious that it would be with the attorneys that filed the case.  My apologies for assuming that you did not read.. but that same logic dictates that I can't assume you comprehend either. Blind opposition helps no one
@EKrassensteinpc The new standard is that is only has to be 1/1024ths true to count.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Saudi has spent YEARS oppressing WOMEN and HOMOSEXUALS... they have committed heinous acts like execution, beatings, and torture.  I can't find any other tweets over the years from you about their behavior...  u only say something when Trump is President. #DemsDoNotCare #WalkAway
@krassenstein Mainstream news reports 90% negative stories on Trump		Antifa physically attacks people on opposing side - Dems created KKK		Terrorism supporter allowed in US on Visa is killed in Middle East	No outrage over beheaded Foley in 2014		Yes, Democrats are the "Mob"
@Kerrynann @krassenstein It says it in the article.. &amp; since the article is from a publication already anti-Trump, I'm sure they wouldn't have included that info if they didn't have to. Their paperwork trail would be attached to the lawsuit. That's the danger of just reading the headline &amp; not the story
@krassenstein Technically her crime was FIRST tax fraud, &amp; she was sentenced to 5 years in prison. She didn't listen to or read her discharge paperwork, nor the warning on the ballot, &amp; attempted to vote.  I think her kids can handle a few months since they handled 5 yrs for her other crime
THIS is the kind of BS Dems do!!!  WITHOUT EVIDENCE, it gets printed... for that matter, it should never even have been said!  PLEASE vote this guy out TX! https://t.co/i3skbPQkET

@krassenstein suing for 3 yrs of unpaid fees past due... the same as any other company would.  Being so desperate to find wrong-doing just makes you look more ridiculous.
@elizabethforma or to put it in your terms... redlining represents about 1/1024th of the current problem
@elizabethforma Redlining was bad, &amp; it was outlawed 50 yrs ago? Just building a structure in a poor neighborhood doesn't fix anything, u must CHANGE the neighborhood by bringing business in &amp; creating jobs. A structure located in a bad area still has low value! It all starts with fixing crime

@DebraMessing Racist to Warren? He'd have to be making fun of a WHITE woman for that? Racist is CNN calling Kanye a "dumb negro" or "token negro" or Kaitlan Collins saying "fag". Warren has been mocking REAL American Indians for years by stealing their heritage	You're 1/1024ths correct on this

@MichaelAvenatti thought your law firm was shut down?  Court ordered due to failure to pay debts?  Did you pay that $10M settlement yet?
@krassenstein HE also supported Osama, Muslim Brotherhood, &amp; Hamas. Plus he wrote anti-American posts after 9/11. Let's not pretend he was some American hero. To define that, please see Benghazi &amp; look at the LACK OF REACTION from the left! Hell, the left didn't react when Foley was beheaded!
@cenkuygur Dems are pro-strife... they need it to fuel their party because they have no substance. No one condones murder (other than Dems w/ unborn kids). Fact, this man was friends with Osama, supports Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, and wrote anti-American articles after 9/11. #American1st
