Lastly, yes it is true that some conservative media in particular but also MSM outlets have treated young black men who were murdered by cops or caught up in media firestorms in a horrific, unconscionable manner. But that‚Äôs not a defense. 2 things can be wrong at the same time.
Also there were plenty of fact based updates that called the claims into question that were only covered by local Chicago press, drudge etc...Silence is also an editorial choice.
@archpundit Totally agree the criticism is not of the local reporters who did great work
Re: the media folk I see defending the Smollett coverage. As long as reporters are tweeting takes and being booked on cable to give takes ‚Äújournalism‚Äù and ‚Äúpunditry‚Äù are one in the same. It‚Äôs not a compelling defense to say the wire reports were just covering the claims.

@ITookTheRoad It's a 1 hour flight! Yeah LAX still 2 hours.
@MayoArtAde Of course it will the Amtrak is expensive!
@SuperPrivileged @AOC That's the length from NY to SF. There is no path to air travel not becoming necessary with current technology. That's why its a dumb statement.
The California bullet train which is not due til 2033 now is billions over budget. When it's done they project SF to LA in 2 hours 40. Today I can leave my house, take-off from Oakland &amp; land in Burbank in about 2 hours total for $150~ round trip with security.
I have nothing against trains but the lefty twitter/journo worship of them is odd and over-indexes on how bad plane travel is because they do it a lot. The emissions argument I get but it gets merged with a consumer need case that is overstated. For example:

@eScarry She‚Äôs incompetent! But you are talking about 22 votes. There is a recount option to review and challenge those ballots. There‚Äôs a 15k vote lead. Nothing is being stolen. Nothing is infected. The president can criticize without acting like Florida is Venezuela &amp; elections are fake
@eScarry So you think the president should be making up shit about the recount even though his candidate has 50x greater vote lead than has flipped in modern times. Ok! Disagree!
You‚Äôre not going to believe this but every Republican leader spent the Obama years criticizing him for treating our enemies like friends and friends like enemies. And yet.... https://t.co/sONfBqu66K

@JohnEkdahl Right. My view is gains aren‚Äôt worth enabling someone who ran for POTUS on overt racism, conspiracy mongering, unapologetic sexual assault and has 0 respect for the values that make me conservative. I don‚Äôt give racist pricks back pats for tax cuts even if I support them. (I do)

@JohnEkdahl Trying to understand the continuum. You think the Democrats are bordering on insanity. Where on the sane spectrum in comparison to that is Trump offering the theory that Obama framed him in collusion with the deep state and that could be explained by the missing DNC server.
