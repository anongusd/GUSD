Every US company paying import tariffs on account of the China trade dispute should be able to apply for relief. So I‚Äôm introducing the bipartisan, bicameral Import Tax Relief Act with @SenatorLankford, @RepRonKind, and @RepWalorski to require just that. https://t.co/s2SbNZmijG
China‚Äôs unlawful trade practices must end. We should pressure China, but not while recklessly harming US employers and consumers.

Today, I‚Äôm joining my Senate Democratic colleagues in introducing a resolution that affirms 3 simple things:		1. Climate change is real.	2. It‚Äôs caused by humans.	3. Congress must act.
I agree with President Trump that Michael Cohen is a liar &amp; a criminal.	But so is Roger Stone. So is Paul Manafort. So is Michael Flynn. President Trump surrounded himself with criminals &amp; liars, but we're supposed to believe that neither he nor his campaign did anything illegal?
We don't need reality TV summits. 		We need real and serious diplomacy.
I'm also deeply disappointed that President Trump took Kim Jong Un's word that he did not murder Otto Warmbier, an innocent young American who died at the hands of the North Koreans.
I'm very concerned by reports that American negotiators had dropped a requirement that North Korea make a full and transparent accounting of its nuclear facilities.
While I‚Äôm grateful that President Trump walked away from a bad deal with North Korea, it seems that he wasn't well prepared for this summit. https://t.co/n6NlCuvNsI

I encourage President Trump to press for a complete accounting of all North Korean nuclear sites and facilities during this summit and to work in concert with our allies and international partners to press for verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.
Despite President Trump‚Äôs claims that North Korea no longer poses a nuclear threat and that Kim Jong Un is an honorable leader, there is no evidence that North Korea has taken any concrete steps to to denuclearize or improve their horrible human rights record.
While I‚Äôm pleased to see President Trump pursue diplomacy as he meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, I remain concerned that President Trump continues to downplay the threat that North Korea presents.
The Trump administration is refusing to release the facts about the killing of @washingtonpost journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi, so today, we‚Äôre introducing legislation to force them to publicly disclose what they know about his murder.

I‚Äôm proud that Delaware‚Äôs Attorney General, Kathleen Jennings, is one of 16 state Attorneys General suing the Trump Administration over this misguided decision.
This funding, which should be supporting the construction of better housing, schools, &amp; medical facilities for servicemembers &amp; families, is threatened because the President refuses to listen to border security experts &amp; Republicans &amp; Democrats who agree a wall is a bad idea.
The President is planning to take money from the military and from drug interdiction programs to build his wall - that means funds for Dover Air Force Base, the Delaware National Guard, and law enforcement programs could be at risk.
President Trump‚Äôs emergency declaration is wrong, dangerous, and, I believe, unconstitutional. It could also impact us here in Delaware. https://t.co/a8ENXU2S7q

The President should reconsider this disaster declaration and work with Congress to ensure our approach to border security is driven by facts, not fear, and good policy, not politics.
Democrats &amp; Republicans agree border security is important, but the President‚Äôs fear mongering about immigrants, refusal to listen to border security experts about what our real needs are at the border, and his attempts to end run the appropriations process are counterproductive.
It is the responsibility of Pres. Trump-&amp; any President-to declare national emergencies when appropriate &amp; respond with the full resources of the federal government, but clearly, there is no such emergency for him to declare.
While I‚Äôm encouraged Pres. Trump will finally sign into law the bipartisan agreement to fund the government &amp; make robust investments in smart border security, his decision to declare a #NationalEmergency in order to build a wall along our southern border is a serious mistake.

I believe it is my responsibility to protect the Special Counsel investigation and to safeguard the rule of law, &amp; I'm not convinced that Mr. Barr will uphold the AG's important role in ensuring the integrity of our democratic institutions. My statement: https://t.co/wnRboKyzp3
However, on other issues, he failed to give simple, clear commitments‚Äîthat he would follow the guidance of career DOJ ethics officials on whether he should recuse himself from the investigation, defer to Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigative decisions, or make the report public
At his nomination hearing, I sought assurances from Mr. Barr that he would give the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation the independence &amp; separation from politics that it deserves. I was glad to hear that he would not fire Mueller without cause &amp; would resign rather than do so.
Over the past few weeks, I have carefully weighed Bill Barr‚Äôs nomination to be Attorney General, including his ability to defend the Department of Justice, ensure the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation proceeds w independence, &amp; restore the American people's trust in the rule of law

I believe there are people of good will on both sides of the aisle who want to get things done, from rebuilding our roads and bridges to reducing health care costs and more.

That‚Äôs not all ‚Äì but it paints a clear picture: the President‚Äôs senseless government shutdown is causing significant harm to millions of Americans. The President has multiple, bipartisan options to re-open the government. He needs to pick one and say ‚Äòyes.‚Äô
Because of this senseless government shutdown, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is seeing significant delays in loan processing and approvals.  Thousands of people trying to buy a new home or refinance an FHA-insured mortgage are being put on standby.
Because of this senseless government shutdown, 30 million+ small businesses employing 59 million employees no longer have access to federally assisted loans and technical assistance.
Because of this senseless government shutdown, 380,000+ federal employees have been furloughed, including 19,869 at the Department of Transportation and 7,163 from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Because of this senseless government shutdown, up to 88% of Department of Homeland Security employees are working without pay, including 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers and 42,000 Coast Guard employees.
Because of this senseless government shutdown, 41,000+ law enforcement &amp; correctional officers, including many veterans, are working without pay. That includes:	2,614 ATF agents	16,742 Bureau of Prisons officers	13,709 FBI agents	3,600 deputy U.S. Marshals	4,399 DEA agents

The President has multiple options to do all of that, he just needs to say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to one of them.

I‚Äôve voted several times to invest billions of dollars in border security, and I am willing to support more funding for the border, but we‚Äôve heard time and again from experts that the President‚Äôs idea for a single concrete wall is a waste of money and a bad idea.
There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for a partial government shutdown, and this is happening because the President is rejecting multiple, bipartisan options to fund the government and provide billions in additional border security funding.

There are several options on the table to fund the government &amp; provide funding for border security that would receive support from both parties, but the President &amp; his most partisan allies in Congress are forcing this shutdown in order to send a political message to their base.

Republicans have never put forward a real plan to improve our health care system, and they haven‚Äôt put forward any real solutions for Americans with pre-existing conditions.
The ACA isn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äì but we should not be tearing down the entire health care system over politics. 		We should be working together to improve it.
To be clear, the ACA is still the law of the land, but this ruling shows that Republicans are still doing everything they can to take down the Affordable Care Act, which would be devastating for millions of Americans ‚Äì especially Americans with pre-existing conditions.
On Friday, a judge in Texas handed down a ruling that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act.
Congress should pass this bipartisan legislation to relieve our overcrowded prisons, redirect funding to our most pressing law enforcement efforts, help keep our communities safe, and ensure the integrity of our justice system.
America holds more prisoners than any other country in the world. Our overcrowded federal prisons consume one quarter of the DOJ's discretionary budget. This undermines other important priorities, like preventing crime and treating drug addiction. #FirstStepAct

This resolution is one of several steps the United States should take to show Saudi leaders that their behavior has consequences.
It has become clear in the last several months that Saudi leadership has consistently violated human rights and that the Saudi-led coalition air campaign in Yemen has exacerbated human suffering and the ongoing civil war.

According to @pressfreedom, 52 journalists have been targeted and killed this year because of their work to keep us informed and to bring truth to light. To ensure our own freedom, we must protect journalists and hold accountable those who try to silence them.

I look forward to meeting Heather Nauert &amp; reviewing her record &amp; qualifications for US Ambassador to the UN. This position represents our country‚Äôs values &amp; interests at an invaluable international forum the US helped create to advance global peace &amp; prosperity following WWII.
I will closely examine Mr. Barr‚Äôs record, experience, and views to determine whether he will protect the rule of law and the rights of every American, or instead use this position as a partisan tool, manifesting the President‚Äôs worst tendencies and policies.
It will be critical that Mr. Barr assure the Senate and the American people that the Special Counsel investigation would continue without any interference.
Mr. Barr must demonstrate that he would be an independent Attorney General committed to the Constitution and the rule of law, not the President who nominated him.
William Barr has the background and experience you would expect of a nominee for Attorney General. However, I am concerned that he holds, and has long advanced, a very expansive view of presidential power. https://t.co/xB4DzdgMaG

It is time for the US to step up to the challenge in front of us with courage and American ingenuity.		We must reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do so in a way that protects American workers.
In Delaware alone, 14,000 homes could be chronically flooded by the end of the century, displacing thousands of Delawareans and resulting in over $700 million in lost property value.
Within the lifetime of a child born today, climate change could cost the US over $500 billion every year, mostly in the form of lost wages, property values, and infrastructure damages. We could lose 5-10% of our national GDP.

We're competing with China more often than we are cooperating. We need to seek areas where we can partner with China. In areas where we cannot, the US is best served by emphasizing American values and strengthening relationships with allies and partners around the world.
President Trump is right to have zeroed in on China‚Äôs unfair trade practices, but a trade war with China isn‚Äôt good for the world‚Äôs economy over the long term, and it‚Äôs not good for the U.S. economy either.
By imposing tariffs on allies like Canada, Sweden, Germany, and South Africa under the guise of national security concerns, Pres. Trump has divided us from our closest partners in these efforts.  This summit is an opportunity to repair those relationships.
In Buenos Aires this weekend, Pres. Trump should exercise leadership and work with those who share our values and our preference for free markets and democratic governance to pressure China to end its discriminatory practices and further open up its economy.

Congress must now act to protect the independence of the investigation and uphold the rule of law. 		I will be pressing my Democratic and Republican colleagues to move toward a vote on the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act as soon as possible.
If there is any indication that the President has fired the Attorney General and named Mr. Whitaker as Acting Attorney General to influence or end Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation, that would make today‚Äôs action an historic attack on the rule of law.
Given his previous comments about the investigation, Mr. Whitaker should recuse himself from oversight of the Special Counsel investigation during his tenure as Acting Attorney General.
The President and Mr. Whitaker must demonstrate that the Mueller investigation will continue under its current leadership and supervision unimpeded.
That is a red line which President Trump has been warned not to cross by Republicans and Democrats alike for months.
I'm deeply concerned that President Trump, both in forcing AG Sessions‚Äô resignation and effectively stripping Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein of his authority to supervise the Mueller investigation, is now in position to easily interfere with or even end the Mueller investigation.
Democracy is hard. 	Democracy takes work. 	Growing up, my dad told me over and over again, it‚Äôs worth fighting for. I believe it‚Äôs worth fighting for.

We should have a classified briefing and, depending on the facts of this case, we may need to re-assess our relationship w/ Saudi Arabia, including planned arms sales, our ongoing support for the war in Yemen, and other aspects of our partnership with the Kingdom.
Seventeen days after the disappearance of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khasshogi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the explanation by Saudi officials that he was killed in an impromptu ‚Äòfist fight‚Äô is not credible.
I will reserve my final judgement until I get all the facts, but there is mounting evidence of a brutal murder of a journalist living in the United States by the Saudis.
While Saudi Arabia has long been an important U.S. partner in the Middle East, our shared interests should not require us to abandon our values, which include our commitment to a free press, human rights, and the rule of law.

As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I‚Äôm urging the President once again to nominate ambassadors for key positions around the world so they can be confirmed and get to work.
When a crisis like the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi occurs, we need American diplomats in key posts around the world to ensure the United States can respond quickly &amp; effectively. Right now, though, the Trump Admin hasn‚Äôt even nominated ambassadors for Turkey or Saudi Arabia.
I‚Äôm not going to give up, though. I will keep fighting to ensure that Delawareans have access not only to affordable health care, but to affordable, QUALITY health care.
We voted in the Senate today to ensure that Americans and Delawareans aren‚Äôt misled into buying ‚Äújunk‚Äù insurance plans that don‚Äôt provide the care they need ‚Äì but the Republican majority defeated the effort by ONE vote.
These junk insurance plans:	1) Don‚Äôt have to cover pre-existing conditions	2) Can exclude maternity care, substance abuse treatment, prescription drug costs, and ER visits	3) Can charge older Americans more		Does that sound like an improvement to our health care system?
Let‚Äôs be clear: the Trump Admin‚Äôs latest effort to encourage Americans into ‚Äújunk‚Äù insurance plans is a bad deal for consumers, and it hurts our overall health care system.
Rather than focusing on how to give more Americans access to quality, affordable health insurance, the Trump Admin is focused solely on destroying the Affordable Care Act, and in the process, they‚Äôre stripping protections away from those who need health care the most.

The ACA is not perfect. But the Trump Admin‚Äôs continued efforts to strip away protections for those who need health care the most is not how we fix our health care system.
To make matters worse, the Trump Admin is now encouraging Navigators to direct Americans into ‚Äújunk‚Äù insurance plans that hurt people with pre-existing conditions and do not cover services like maternity care or ER visits and place caps on coverage.
The Trump Admin has imposed an 84% cut on federal funding for Navigators that help Americans sign up for health insurance. Navigators are vital for all families, but particularly low-income families, communities of color, and those with language barriers.

I am concerned that Judge Kavanaugh also holds a sweeping view of executive power that would allow the President to fire a special counsel who is investigating him simply for doing his job. I believe this view puts any President above the law. That should concern every American.

The next Supreme Court Justice will help shape the future of this country for decades, from playing a pivotal role in defining the scope of the President‚Äôs power and determining whether the President is above the law, to impacting essential rights enshrined in our Constitution.
The Judiciary Committee should delay this week‚Äôs vote to ensure an opportunity for Dr. Ford‚Äôs allegations to be promptly investigated.

Why are Senate Republicans rushing Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs hearings before even the records they asked for are available?
The Senate Judiciary Committee only has 2% of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs White House record.  		How are Senators supposed to question a lifetime Supreme Court nominee without reviewing his or her full record?
Anyone who believes in transparency should be asking why.
Let‚Äôs be clear about what‚Äôs happening: Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation hearings are in just a few weeks. Yet, only 1% of his White House documents are public. 		99% of Justice Kagan‚Äôs White House record was provided to the public.
This is a disservice to the United States Senate and to the American people who are entitled to see these records and to have them inform our confirmation hearing of the President‚Äôs nominee for the Supreme Court.
Instead, the Committee will only see documents that Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs former deputy selects and releases to the Senate ‚Äî and he has only given us two percent of the total records.
Let‚Äôs be clear about what‚Äôs happening: the National Archives has millions of pages of records on Judge Kavanaugh, and those records belong to the American people.  Even Chairman Grassley asked for 900,000 pages from the Nat‚Äôl Archives, but Republicans won‚Äôt even wait to get those
I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that Republicans have decided to rush the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Judge Kavanaugh without our having access to his full record.  *Both parties* used to believe in fully vetting nominees for life-tenured positions on the Supreme Court

When it comes to health care, partisan gridlock in Washington has real-life impacts on millions of Americans, because access to quality health care isn‚Äôt just a political issue. It‚Äôs a matter of life and death, and partisan differences get in the way of solutions.

The answer to all of this is easy. Let‚Äôs just do this the way it‚Äôs supposed to be done:	1. Get Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs full record from the National Archives.	2. Review the record.	3. Vote for or against his confirmation.	That isn‚Äôt too much to ask-it‚Äôs the least our county deserves.
This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. No Senator should vote on a lifetime Supreme Court nominee without reviewing his or her full record. Period.
The idea that Senate Rs aren‚Äôt willing to have Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs full record vetted in a nonpartisan way before voting to confirm him is antithetical to the way the judicial confirmation process is supposed to work. It‚Äôs a dereliction of our constitutional duty to advise&amp;consent
Senate Republicans refused to hold a hearing for Merrick Garland for 10 months.  Now, they are in such a rush to confirm Judge Kavanaugh that they might not even wait for the release of his full records?
The point of all this is: Science matters. The facts and research that drive science matter. 		And we should make sure that as we set policy for the United States, we‚Äôre utilizing science, scientists, and all the available facts, analysis, and data sets we can get our hands on.

After some delay, this is happening NOW on the Senate floor https://t.co/Xi0beHWBlx
The bottom line is this: the #ACA has helped millions of Americans like Nicole and Kim live healthier, more secure lives. 		They are what this debate is about, and we need to put politics aside and do our job.
Losing pre-existing condition protections would be devastating for Nicole. It would be devastating for Kim from Wilmington, who is among the 190K Delawareans now able to get insurance because her cancer isn‚Äôt considered a pre-existing condition.
These efforts to undermine the #ACA culminated last month with the Trump administration‚Äôs decision to no longer defend core components of the #ACA, including protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
Unfortunately, we‚Äôve seen consistent efforts by many Republicans in Congress ‚Äì and now the administration ‚Äì to undermine the #ACA and, as a result, roll back progress to extend quality, affordable health care to more Americans.
Just listen to Nicole from Hockessin, Delaware: Her daughter has Cystic Fibrosis. Her $5,000-a-month medications aren‚Äôt cheap. Nicole is confident that without the #ACA, she would exceed her annual cap well before the end of each year.
Since the #ACA, 38,000 Delawareans have gained access to high quality, comprehensive healthcare coverage. 68,000 Delawareans have benefitted from Medicaid expansion.
Mr. President, American farmers are plenty patient ‚Äì but they know and all of us know that your senseless trade wars are devastating our agriculture sector. Farmers in Delaware and the U.S. deserve better. https://t.co/Giiy1aq1Zu

We should, in a bipartisan way, reaffirm that we will not accept Russia‚Äôs lawless attacks on our country &amp; our allies, &amp; we should pass bipartisan legislation to ensure that the President cannot end or interfere with the Special Counsel‚Äôs investigation.
Today‚Äôs summit &amp; press conference should be an unmistakable call to members of Congress.  We must reassert our responsibility for security &amp; the rule of law in the United States.
President Trump repeated the lie that Special Counsel Mueller‚Äôs investigation into Russian attacks on our election is a ‚Äòwitch hunt,‚Äô &amp; he did it while standing next to Putin. That is both alarming &amp; unacceptable.
Second, President Trump was given a choice between backing the U.S. law enforcement &amp; intelligence communities or siding with Vladimir Putin. He picked Putin.
First, @POTUS‚Äô refusal to strongly &amp; publicly hold Putin &amp; Russia accountable for attacking our 2016 election, propping up the murderous Assad regime, &amp; illegally invading Crimea was a historic failure of leadership that will have lasting consequences for natl &amp; global security
Let me remind you why we are in this low point in bilateral relations. Putin has sought to undermine the international order through overt aggression, such as his armed interventions in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014, and his interference in our 2016 election.
A better understanding of Russia will lead to better policy, and potentially, a more constructive relationship.

The Foreign Relations Committee is voting later today to state clearly that the President should not recognize Russian annexation of Crimea or do anything to weaken the NATO alliance. This bipartisan resolution will get nearly unanimous support.
The door to NATO membership should remain open to those European countries wishing to join the alliance.
All but one of the 28 allies are increasing defense spending, 26 are sending more troops to NATO missions, 16 are on track to spend 2% by 2024, which is the official agreed upon NATO target.  We should be applauding them and supporting them ‚Äì not attacking them at a summit.
The combined defense budget of NATO has grown by $14.4 billion since Trump took office, a trend that began after Obama‚Äôs call for 2% of GDP defense spending at NATO‚Äôs Wales Summit in 2014.
Over 1,000 non-U.S. NATO troops have died fighting alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

In Delaware, nearly 350 people died from opioid overdoses in 2017, up from 154 in 2016. While heroin use has increased statewide, northern communities have taken the greatest hit. I‚Äôm proud the Appropriations Committee took an important step today to help reverse this trend.

This Administration is blemishing the United States‚Äô human rights record in lasting ways. We cannot tolerate this.
We live in the most powerful, prosperous nation in world history, and our President is treating children and their indefinite detention or separation from their parents as a bargaining chip in a long running disagreement over how to fix our nation‚Äôs broken immigration system.
Under this order, President Trump‚Äôs new policy is to indefinitely detain entire families in facilities that may include ill-equipped tent cities, and his order doesn‚Äôt clarify what will become of the more than 2,000 children already separated from their families.
Over the last week, the American people spoke clearly and said that the President‚Äôs policy was an unacceptable, un-American tragedy that should not continue.  The President finally succumbed to pressure yesterday by issuing an EO, but that order simply creates new problems.
I have joined many colleagues in calling for hearings before the Judiciary Committee to expose the cruelty of this 'zero tolerance' policy and explore more effective and humanitarian alternatives.
The Admin has misled the American people and excused this cruel policy in a variety of ways, including claiming that they didn‚Äôt have this policy, that they were following a non-existent law, or that their policy was being used as a deterrent for people who are fleeing to the US
President Trump created a humanitarian crisis by adopting a ‚Äòzero-tolerance‚Äô policy for people fleeing violence in their home countries.  That ‚Äòzero-tolerance‚Äô policy included cruelly separating young children and even babies from their parents at the border.
The American people deserve clarity about what has happened along our southern border in recent weeks.

.@realDonaldTrump - *You* can change this today. It doesn't require legislation. You are not compelled to do this by law.

The actions focused on in this report took place months before Special Counsel Mueller was even appointed by Deputy AG Rosenstein, whom President Trump appointed. The Mueller investigation must proceed without interference. Period.
I expect Pres. Trump to claim that this report somehow taints Mueller‚Äôs investigation, but that simply does not match the facts.
This is not proof of a ‚ÄòDeep State‚Äô or evidence of a conspiracy against the President. Most importantly, this does nothing to undermine the important investigation that Special Counsel Mueller is conducting into Russian interference with our election.
Equally important is the fact that the IG found absolutely no evidence that the decision to conclude that investigation without prosecution was the result of bias at the FBI or DOJ.
This is an important accounting of actions taken by DOJ employees related to the investigation of Secretary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email server, including some that appear to have been violations of longstanding DOJ policies.

The Affordable Care Act isn‚Äôt perfect, but dismantling the law &amp; refusing to defend Americans with pre-existing conditions is not how we fix our health care system. Democrats are at the table, we are ready &amp; willing to work together on this as we always have been.
Two years ago today, we lost 49 Americans in a hateful act of gun violence. We mourn those who died at Pulse nightclub and commit to #HonorThemWithAction by fighting to make our communities safer.
It is critical that we sound the alarm on the Trump administration‚Äôs attempts to sabotage our health care system. If the Trump administration prevails, millions of Americans could lose health care coverage &amp; protections.
Literally, the Trump Administration is arguing that insurance companies should be able to discriminate against people with pre-existing health conditions. 		This is astounding.		https://t.co/Au5rLG7qrm
RT @Morning_Joe: Summit a dream outcome for North Korea, says @ChrisCoons https://t.co/41GeFUwzBF
President Trump would have been stronger going into this summit had he left the G-7 with a united declaration of support for sanctions &amp; for our negotiating stature. Instead, he left with the G-7 in disarray.  That makes this harder, not easier.
For this agreement with North Korea to mean anything, there will have to be a lot of hard work and discipline in the months ahead. It is my hope that the Trump administration is prepared to do that &amp; will follow through.
The agreement is purely aspirational because President Trump failed to get concrete action on human rights, &amp; we have no definition, no timeline, and no details on denuclearization: https://t.co/KALVjTrctT
The agreement signed in Singapore is a dream outcome for Kim Jong Un ‚Äì legitimacy on the world stage, an invitation to the White House, and a pledge to stop military exercises, all in exchange for a vague pledge that North Korea has broken at least twice before.

These efforts may seem innocuous when taken independently, but collectively they represent an attempt to increase the appeal of autocracy and strengthen Chinese leverage over U.S. Our letter calls for @FBI @StateDept @USTreasury @DeptofDefense coordination in response.
All of us, including members of Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intel, Banking &amp; Judiciary Committees, are calling on the Admin. to develop a strategy to counter Chinese actions, which aim to manipulate public discourse.

This move is also likely to further destabilize our health insurance marketplace and drive up premiums for many consumers. As multiple health care experts have pointed out, when insurers see uncertainty in the marketplace, they increase premiums to compensate.
Older Americans are more at risk &amp; the ban on insurance discrimination against women could disappear. The Trump admin is taking their partisan agenda too far ‚Äì this decision is impacting whether our constituents have access to affordable health care &amp; I won‚Äôt stand for it.
This action from the Trump admin would allow Delawareans and Americans w/ pre-existing conditions to be charged more or denied coverage altogether based on pre-existing health conditions.
Just take a look at the numbers: 133 million nonelderly Americans have pre-existing conditions. When the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, more than 190,000 Delawareans with pre-existing conditions got needed protection.
This is a big deal. If the Trump administration has its way, coverage &amp; protections for millions of Americans could disappear. https://t.co/MeF4JVcDVZ
Last week, the Trump admin announced that they would no longer defend core components of the Affordable Care Act, namely protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Make no mistake: this is the administration completely sabotaging our health care system.

The Trump administration must end this cruel policy that separates families searching for a better life in the United States. Our country is better than this.
As of Feb. 2018, almost 1,800 immigrant families have been separated by U.S. authorities after crossing into the U.S. from Mexico since Oct. 2016. My colleagues and I are asking the administration to stop tearing families apart. https://t.co/VIhqS4eJTx

It appears the administration let ZTE off the hook without significantly advancing American interests or values. This isn‚Äôt being tough on China, it‚Äôs a bad deal and giveaway to a country that at times refuses to play by the rules at the expense of US workers and security
Legitimate U.S. national security concerns about ZTE should have been addressed by a searching compliance program to ensure IP theft &amp; surveillance issues are fully addressed. I‚Äôm not persuaded the financial fine and compliance program announced today accomplish these goals.
This was a critical moment where the U.S. had China over a barrel. We should have used this leverage to demand that China stop its illegal trade practices, stop stealing our intellectual property, and pressure Korea to make concessions on its nuclear weapons program
At its worst, this deal is a threat to our national security &amp; the privacy of all Americans. Releasing pressure on ZTE is a missed opportunity to hold China accountable for unfair trade practices that hurt U.S. workers, threaten our security, and undermine our competitiveness.
Unless the administration got some real concessions from China with regards to N Korea‚Äôs nuclear program and addressing our national security concerns, President Trump‚Äôs deal, at its best, represents a major concession to China. https://t.co/BuHeU3OhVO

We all have the opportunity to bring this crisis out of the shadows and shine a light on it, to talk about it no matter how uncomfortable and painful. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing today on @WDEL.
That led to a 12% decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions in eight months.
We also need to limit the prescription of opioid painkillers. Under the leadership of @DE_DOJ Matt Denn, Delaware enacted regulations in '17 that allow prescribers to better monitor each opioid Rx and limit an adult from receiving a 1st time prescription for more than 7 days
Also proud to support the most recent spending package, which included a total of $3.3 billion in increased funding to fight the opioid and mental health crises for FY18, including an increase of $2.8 billion in treatment, prevention, and research for programs within HHS.
I've also fought against bills that take away health care access for Delawareans and against any harmful cuts to the programs that people rely on for care and treatment.
We need to approach this with the right policies and the right attitudes. We don‚Äôt need a War on Drugs approach ‚Äì we need to let people know how dangerous these drugs are, and for those who are already addicted ‚Äì we need to get them the help and care they need.
The opioid crisis is a public health crisis.  The people who are suffering from addiction are not drug addicts who should be punished ‚Äì they‚Äôre our loved ones, our neighbors, and our friends ‚Äì and we need to care for them.

Our European allies are questioning now whether we are a reliable partner in making diplomatic measures that will drive Iran in a better direction ‚Äì the President needs to consult Congress on what to do next with regards to North Korea &amp; Iran.
I hope that we can now find some path toward reengaging our allies, renegotiating with Iran, and getting to a stronger deal. But, I frankly think President Trump‚Äôs decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal makes that less likely, not more likely. https://t.co/ChLAdpBjy0

We‚Äôve made important progress in addressing the #skillsgap, but we still have much more to do. Proud to speak today at a bipartisan panel discussion on this topic: https://t.co/HbXVsBeR9j
That‚Äôs what we call the #skillsgap &amp; that‚Äôs where #apprenticeships come in. The data speaks for itself: more than 90% of those who complete #apprenticeships land jobs with starting annual wages that exceed $60,000.
According to the National Skills Coalition, there are 5.9 million job openings in the U.S. &amp; 6.6 million unemployed Americans. But, here‚Äôs the problem: many of these unemployed Americans don‚Äôt have the skills they need to fill these open jobs.
Apprenticeships are what I like to call "the other four-year degree,‚Äù because they often lead to a well-paying job, a clear career path upon graduating, little to no debt, &amp; skills that you can use for a lifetime.
On Capitol Hill, we spend a lot of time talking about how important it is to invest in four-year degree programs, which indeed are critical investments. But there are other pathways that young people can take to build a successful career, such as #apprenticeships.
Today‚Äôs announcement is further proof that President Trump does not have a clear strategy for dealing with Iran, and that is dangerous not only for the United States, but also for the world.
I share President Trump‚Äôs goals of ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon and denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, but we differ greatly in how we approach these problems. Bluster is not a strategy and the alliances we have built over the past 70 years matter
Why would our international partners honor any deal we might strike with North Korea?
What reasonable expectation is there for a new, stronger deal with Iran?
How can we lead an international coalition to push back against Iran after abandoning an agreement with which Iran has largely complied?
How do we now ensure that Iran does not restart its nuclear weapons program without the inspections and access guaranteed by the agreement?
What is his strategy for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?
Today‚Äôs decision from President Trump produces only new, increasingly difficult questions.
Like the President, I‚Äôm deeply concerned by Iran‚Äôs continued support for terrorism, its commitment to prop up the Assad regime, its human rights abuses, &amp; its ballistic missile program, but I question how walking away from the deal makes it any easier to deal w/ those challenges
This is a mistake. It will likely make it harder for the US &amp; the international community to monitor Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, it divides us from our European allies, and it raises legitimate questions about US‚Äô ability to lead the international community in the face of crisis. https://t.co/XtBjAQB0Bx

Here‚Äôs the good news in this article: ‚ÄúEnacting the policy as a regulation, as the E.P.A. intends to do, will involve accepting comments from the public.‚Äù  It‚Äôs time to get engaged and tell the @EPA this move is dangerous, ridiculous, and unacceptable.
Let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt about making science better, and it isn‚Äôt about improving the EPA‚Äôs processes.  It‚Äôs about stifling the science that the administration ‚Äì and the industries they listen to ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt like. This is not how science works.
This is appalling. Scott Pruitt is denying scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency access to the scientific data they need to, you know, protect the environment. https://t.co/ZOvGvXoGGE
Mr. Duncan‚Äôs controversial record leaves me with too many doubts that I have no choice but to oppose his nomination. I doubt that he will uphold the constitutional rights of all Americans.
The Senate will be voting on the nomination of Kyle Duncan for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ‚Äì a court that will be called on to ensure Equal Protection for LGBT citizens, to block undue burdens on reproductive health care, &amp; to protect access to the ballot box.

Given these reasons, I will oppose Director Pompeo‚Äôs nomination in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday.
Finally, Director Pompeo‚Äôs past statements as a Congressman and candidate on a range of issues give me great concern since the role of Secretary of State is in part to speak for all Americans on issues of our shared values to rest of the world.
However, I remain concerned that Dir Pompeo won‚Äôt challenge the President in critical moments. On vital decisions facing our country, Dir Pompeo seems less concerned with rule of law &amp; partnership with our allies &amp; more inclined to emphasize unilateral action &amp; the use of force
He is also knowledgeable and clear-eyed about the diplomatic and security challenges we face around the world.
I do not make this decision without reservations.  I am convinced Dir Pompeo would be a strong advocate for the career professionals of the State Dept and that he would repair some of the damage that vacancies and budget uncertainties have created over the past eighteen months.
While I respect his background of military and public service and am encouraged by his stated commitment to our diplomatic corps, I remain concerned that Director Pompeo will embolden, rather than moderate or restrain, President Trump‚Äôs most belligerent and dangerous instincts.
After careful consideration, I have decided that I will oppose CIA Director Mike Pompeo‚Äôs nomination to become Secretary of State.

This is a significant step forward, and it‚Äôs one example of how, when we work across the aisle and keep pushing forward ‚Äì we can make a real difference for American families.
Our bill was enacted into law in late December &amp; this week, the Trump Admin announced that they will put our policy into action: https://t.co/Cn8ZnCAvBg
It was a pretty simple piece of legislation, with a minimal cost, but a significant impact for families already dealing with the unthinkable.
So, a few years ago, @senrobportman, @SenAngusKing &amp; I introduced the Stop Taxing Death and Disability Act that would eliminate that unfair tax penalty levied on student loans forgiven to these families.
We looked into this and found out that thousands of families across the country were experiencing the same issue after having a loved one pass away or become permanently disabled.
To put it simply: by fixing one problem for a family in need, the government ended up creating a new problem for the family.
The Department of Education forgave the loans, but there was a catch. The IRS then counted those forgiven loans as income, meaning the family, still grieving, suddenly had a significantly higher tax bill.
It all started when I heard from a constituent who was grieving the death of a loved one who had outstanding student loans when they passed away.
There are plenty of examples of things *not* working in our politics and our government at the moment, but I want to share a success story‚Ä¶
The nonpartisan @USCBO recent report estimates historically large budget deficits- rising from $665 billion in 2017 to $1.3 trillion in 2022 mainly because of the recent Republican tax bill https://t.co/xKnSewOcWo
Let‚Äôs be clear ‚Äì whatever benefits some working families got from this legislation is temporary, and pales in comparison to the benefits that the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations are enjoying.
A few corporations gave employees one-time bonuses, which was a great thing, but now, they are buying their own stock shares back by the billions‚Äîa payout to executives and shareholders.
Over the last few months, and today, on #TaxDay, we‚Äôre seeing that the Republican tax bill is helping the wealthiest Americans and big corporations, NOT the middle class

I hope Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo will clarify the Administration's policy towards Syria and the wider Middle East during his confirmation hearing on Thursday. We need clear-eyed, strong U.S. leadership in Syria.
... but has sent dangerous mixed signals about our commitment to defeating ISIS, supporting innocent civilians, and meeting the challenges posed by expanding Russian and Iranian influence in Syria.
I am encouraged that President Trump finally called out both Iran and Russian President Vladimir Putin by name for their support of the Assad regime, but the fact remains that the Trump Administration has not only failed to present a strategy for the crisis...
Assad‚Äôs latest chemical attack on his own people is a war crime and a reminder that he is among the world‚Äôs most brutal dictators.

15 months into the Admin, there is no excuse why the President has not nominated anyone for over 60 Senate-confirmed positions at the State Dept &amp; USAID, including multiple Asst. Secretaries &amp; Ambs. to Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, &amp; many more.
I opposed it when my Republican colleagues placed indefinite holds on President Obama‚Äôs nominees, and I will generally oppose my colleagues placing indefinite holds on President Trump‚Äôs nominees.  Regardless of ideology, these nominees deserve quick action by the U.S. Senate.
The point is that we should have an up or down vote on these nominees.
The Senate should vote on President Trump‚Äôs nominees to serve as U.S. ambassadors around the world, including his nominee to serve as Ambassador to Germany. That doesn‚Äôt mean, though, that I support all those nominees, including Richard Grenell, whose nomination I oppose.

Specifically, I‚Äôm pleased that the final bill included funding for election security, state and local law enforcement and fire services, national service, DE‚Äôs National Guard, Amtrak, the DE River Basin Restoration Program, and more.
While this bill isn‚Äôt perfect, and both parties had to compromise to reach an agreement, I believe this bill provides important investments in our military and domestic programs that will make a real difference across the country.
When Congress is gridlocked, the annual spending bill is one of the best opportunities we have to fund key programs that Delaware and our entire country rely on.
I hope that Ambassador Bolton will moderate his positions and work closely with our military, diplomatic, intelligence, and development professionals before rushing into armed conflict.
Ambassador Bolton‚Äôs stated positions on today‚Äôs major issues, most notably North Korea‚Äôs and Iran‚Äôs nuclear programs, are overly aggressive at best and downright dangerous at worst.
Though Ambassador John Bolton has extensive foreign policy experience, I‚Äôm deeply concerned by the prospect of him advising President Trump and directing key debates on national security policy.

Over the next week, before the Senate breaks for two weeks, I plan to speak individually with as many of my colleagues as possible to build support for this effort so we can move ahead.
The improper removal of the Special Counsel is not in anyone‚Äôs interest, and the American people deserve nothing less than a full, objective report from the Special Counsel on his findings, no matter what those findings are.
Unfortunately, the statements and actions from the President and his lawyer over the weekend have led me to believe that the Special Counsel is now at real, immediate risk of being removed, and I believe the Senate needs to pass legislation to ensure that does not happen.

Again, there‚Äôs a *bipartisan* bill to ensure Special Counsel Mueller and future Special Counsels are not removed without cause. 		We‚Äôve had a hearing, we‚Äôve debated it, and we should pass it into law.		Read about it here: https://t.co/qj7mXhZzcP‚Ä¶ https://t.co/euhVXsQtFD

I have introduced bipartisan legislation designed to prevent any Special Counsel, including Robert Mueller, from improper removal, and I urge all senators to support it.
Any attempt by the President to obstruct or remove the Special Counsel would create a constitutional crisis and represent an attack on the core American principle that nobody, including the President of the United States, is above the law.
These comments are unacceptable but unfortunately not surprising. The President has consistently shown ignorance and disrespect of the rule of law, and he has demonstrated that he‚Äôs willing to attack anything that he perceives as a threat - even the institutions of our democracy. https://t.co/oWY8Jtrch8
I will continue working to pass S.Res.407, a resolution recognizing human rights defenders and encouraging all countries to recognize their duties to protect and promote fundamental freedoms.
Human rights defenders like Marielle play a critical role in promoting the rule of law and good governance, and her murder is a reminder of the real threats they face because of their work.
I urge the Brazilian government to fully investigate the murder of politician and activist Marielle Franco, who gave voice to some of the most marginalized communities in Rio de Janeiro.
So impressed by the amazing work the St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Society has done in the past 25 years in their support of St. Patrick‚Äôs Senior Center.

This is a positive, important step. I hope to see more designations under CAATSA (Countering America‚Äôs Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) and a comprehensive strategy to push back against all forms of Russian aggression in the near future.

Our bill will increase the flexibility of how we deliver food aid, allow us to reach more people with life-saving assistance, and stretch taxpayer dollars further while maintaining the vital role of American farmers in our food aid program.
More than 800 million people around the world are experiencing hunger, and we need to make sure our food aid program is as efficient as possible. That‚Äôs why I introduced the Food for Peace Modernization Act today with @SenBobCorker @RepEdRoyce @RepBlumenauer
Pleased to join @SenToddYoung @SenJeffMerkley for a hearing on Why Food Security Matters. U.S. efforts to increase food security lift people out of poverty, empower women and children, and promote stability around the world.

The bottom line for students and advocates for gun safety is this: Your voices make all the difference.  		Please keep standing up, speaking out, &amp; pushing your elected officials to take action.  		You‚Äôre an inspiration to me and many others, &amp; together, we can make real progress
Today, I‚Äôm in Washington, taking part in a hearing with members of the FBI &amp; the ATF, and importantly, a parent and a teacher from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It‚Äôs my hope that their testimony will help move my colleagues to finally take action to address gun violence.
For example, last week, I introduced a bill with PA GOP Sen Pat Toomey that will require federal authorities to alert state authorities if someone who does not have the legal right to own a firearm attempts to purchase one. It‚Äôs a small step, but a step in the right direction.
Unfortunately, the President and some congressional leaders are still standing in the way of major gun safety reforms, but I‚Äôm doing everything I can to take even small steps toward addressing this epidemic.
I was then, and am today, so impressed and inspired by these young people, not only in Delaware, but all around the country. #DEWalkouts #enough
Less than 2 weeks ago, I met with 100s of students from the Charter School of Wilmington, and they had real concerns, and difficult, informed questions, about weapons, background checks, mental health treatment, and what their elected officials in Washington are doing about it

I look forward to speaking with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, President Trump‚Äôs next pick for Secretary of State, and will caution him that now more than ever, our country needs a Secretary of State who will stand up to the President when necessary, especially when it comes to Russia
Throughout his Administration, President Trump has not only turned away from our allies and weakened our commitments to international coalitions, but he has notably refused to address the real threats that we face from Russia.
Remember: Tillerson‚Äôs firing comes one day after he once again spoke out against Russia when the President would not. https://t.co/FUNfxTiMML

It's more important than ever for Congress to act to protect the independence of the DOJ, including the Special Counsel investigation. For several months, I have been working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do just that. These reports make clear that we need to act.
Reports that President Trump attempted to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller are profoundly disturbing. Removing the Special Counsel without good cause is as unacceptable today as it was when President Nixon fired the Special Prosecutor in 1973
Delaware‚Äôs a small state, but we‚Äôre a proud one. We work hard, we know business, and we‚Äôre not going to let out-of-state politicians turn businesses away from Delaware.

Failing to address all these issues is no way to run a country, and I will not support it.
Finally, this bill effectively tells Dreamers, whom President Trump has arbitrarily sentenced to deportation beginning on March 5, that this country doesn‚Äôt want them here
It leaves unfunded Community Health Centers that thousands of Delawareans rely on for basic health needs.
This one-month temporary patch ignores the fact that Florida, Texas, California, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still in desperate need of relief from natural disasters that happened months ago now
This bill avoids solving our months-overdue challenge of adequately funding our military, which is already stretched too thin, and providing a balanced overall plan for spending
The short-term bill that House Republicans passed tonight simply doesn‚Äôt meet the test of basic governance.
At some point, Congress needs to do better than government-by-crisis, short-term fixes, and sidestepping difficult issues. That time is now.

I‚Äôm sure FL‚Äôs coastline is beautiful, but guess what? So is DE‚Äôs! We deserve to be able to protect our environment just as much as Floridians do. Instead, the Trump Admin is deciding which states have to deal with offshore oil &amp; gas drilling based on‚Ä¶you guessed it, politics.

In DE's coastal communities, public input urged strong protections against drilling. Coastal communities rely on commercial fishing and tourism for our economies. The impacts that drilling and the potential of spills could have on their ecosystems, businesses and jobs are real.

Scrapping the venue laws that have been in place for decades and replacing them with restrictions flies in the face of well-settled principles of corporate law, threatens jobs, and hurts our economy.
Our economy thrives when the bankruptcy system is fair, predictable, and efficient. Experienced bankruptcy judges are critical to ensuring that companies can restructure in a way that saves jobs and preserves value.

Finally, it is critical that we pass the #DreamActNow. As of today, 14,586 DACA recipients have lost their status. #DREAMers deserve our support &amp; deserve to stay in the country they call home. We must protect our #DREAMers once &amp; for all!
The Community Health Center Fund provides &gt;70% of all federal funding for health centers that care for American workers, families, &amp; seniors. As we debate federal funding bills, I‚Äôm fighting for funding for CHCs on behalf of the roughly 42,000 Delawareans in their care each year.
Funding CHIP &amp; community health centers shouldn‚Äôt be partisan issues, either. Unless funding is restored, children in Delaware &amp; across our country will lose their health coverage. The time to act is now.
We also must protect the pensions that American workers have earned ‚Äì right now, more than 1 million workers across our country are facing massive cuts to their pensions.
Any funding package that invests in our Defense Dept must include investments in @DeptVetAffairs, so it can deliver quality h/c &amp; services that veterans depend on. Honoring our nation‚Äôs heroes is our duty. We must agree on a budget that provides the best care &amp; benefits for them.
There‚Äôs a lot we need to get done, and the only way to do it is to work across the aisle, cut the political games, and address these important issues.
Today, the Senate returns to Washington, and we‚Äôll be debating our federal funding bills, which run out this month. I‚Äôm determined to work across the aisle to fight for America‚Äôs veterans, for American workers, for #DREAMers, and to end the opioid crisis.

Frankly, I hope this tax bill doesn‚Äôt fail. I hope it succeeds. But most Americans oppose it &amp; most economists say it won‚Äôt achieve the goals Republicans claim it will. And it‚Äôs clear this will add more than $1 trillion to our national debt.
My hope is that corporations will use those newfound profits to invest in hiring &amp; in capital equipment, but there‚Äôs no indication that they will.
This tax bill is a huge giveaway to the very wealthiest Americans and the most profitable corporations. And, who is going to end up paying for these cuts? The middle class. Rs have already said they will cut Medicare and Medicaid to pay for them.
This tax bill did not have to be a one-party-only bill. I worked hard across the aisle to propose alternative paths to lead us to what the president campaigned on: a middle-class tax cut. But that is not what this bill is. https://t.co/f6wya4hgIP

Thank you to my colleagues @SenMarkey, @SenatorBaldwin, @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBobCasey, &amp; @SenJeffMerkley for joining me in reintroducing this bill to end stigma, discrimination, and stereotypes associated with HIV/AIDS once and for all.
It's not fair that someone with a treatable medical condition should automatically be subjected to a different set of laws. Our laws need to catch up to our science and our morals, and the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act would take an important step in that direction. https://t.co/zhABAjzgyL

Los Dreamers merecen una solucion permanente antes del fin del a√±o. Insto a mis colegas republicanos a que traigan el #DreamAct al pleno del Senado para someterlo a votaci√≥n. Los so√±adores no pueden esperar m√°s.
Dreamers deserve peace of mind before the end of the year. I urge my Republican colleagues to bring the #DreamAct to the Senate floor for a vote. Dreamers can‚Äôt wait any longer.
La fecha l√≠mite para actuar no es el 5 de marzo. Miles de Dreamers ya han perdido sus protecciones bajo #DACA. El tiempo para aprobar el #DreamAct es ahora.
The deadline to act is not March 5. Thousands of Dreamers have already lost their #DACA protections. The time to pass the #DreamAct is now!

The time is now! We cannot keep subjecting nearly 800,000 young people to a life of fear and uncertainty. I am ready to vote for the #DreamAct today.
Los Dreamers son padres, hermanos, esposos y amigos que merecen estar con sus seres queridos en el √∫nico pa√≠s que conocen. Sus futuros dependen de que el Congreso apruebe el #DreamAct.
Dreamers are parents, siblings, spouses, and friends who deserve to stay with their loved ones in the only country they call home. Their livelihoods depend on Congress passing the #DreamAct.

As always, I remain willing to work across the aisle to pass a real, bipartisan tax reform bill for the middle class, but our opportunity to do that is quickly slipping away.
This process isn't finished yet, as the Senate and House bills remain very different, but I am very concerned that we're close to making our already-broken tax code even worse.
It was written with no meaningful consultation between the two parties and it is highly unpopular with the American public, for good reason.
The bill that appears likely to pass the Senate soon is a bad one. There's no sugar coating it. It gives away tens of billions in corporate tax cuts with no strings attached, hurts the middle class over the long run, guts the ACA, &amp; adds more than $1 trillion to the national debt
Over the last few days, I've been working with a handful of my Republican &amp; Democratic colleagues to try to find a way - any way - to stop this backroom, partisan process &amp; force both parties to work together. We got close to an agreement, but ultimately didn't succeed.
For months, I've urged my Republican colleagues to work across the aisle on a bipartisan tax reform bill that Senators from both parties could get behind. 		Last week, I joined more than a dozen Dem Senators to ask our GOP colleagues to slow this process down and work together.
If the Senate passes a bill in the middle of the night, before anyone can read it, to completely re-write the entire US tax code, that's a pretty good indication of what's in it.
Yes. Disagree. https://t.co/MKnp0osQDC
Update: we just proposed an amendment to stop this ridiculous process, read the several-hundred-page bill we're about to vote on (which we just got tonight) over the weekend, and come back to this on Monday.		Our Republican colleagues said no.

It‚Äôs now more important than ever that Special Counsel Mueller is able to continue his investigation without interference. 		I am continuing to work on bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel from being fired without cause.
Robert Mueller is a highly respected and skilled law enforcement official, and when he was named Special Counsel, he had overwhelming support from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.
This morning‚Äôs guilty plea from President Trump‚Äôs former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, is a clear indication that Special Counsel Mueller and his team have found conclusive evidence of illegal activity and are actively proceeding with their investigation.
Just an idea re: tax reform:		Scrap this mess.		Start over.		Work together.		Hold hearings.		Listen to experts.		Pass real, deficit neutral, pro-growth, pro-middle class tax reform.		Just an idea.

This is no way to pass any kind of legislation, much less a huge re-write of our tax code. We should scrap this plan, start over, and *work together*
There have been no public hearings on this bill, and my Republican colleagues are thrust to rush it through without knowing the consequences of what it even does

Time &amp; again, we have been told that the Russians will be back to tamper with our elections in 2018 and 2020 ‚Äì we must do more and protect against these real threats to our democracy.
Earlier today, I joined my colleagues @amyklobuchar &amp; @SenBlumenthal to call on the FEC to address the issue of secretive sponsorship of online campaign ads.

This isn't #fakenews this is GREAT news. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are getting covered. https://t.co/rqq3kuqAjW In Delaware, 20+ got covered at our in-person enrollment event last weekend.
I‚Äôd like to see a tax plan that expands tax policies like the Earned Income Tax Credit ‚Äì highly effective &amp; can provide tax relief for those who need it most.
I‚Äôd like to see a tax plan that incentivizes innovation by strengthening the R&amp;D tax credit.
I‚Äôd like to see a more progressive tax plan with tax cuts for the middle class as the priority.
Our president promised "massive"middle class tax cuts. Speaker Ryan said this plan cuts taxes for everyone. That‚Äôs just not what this plan does: https://t.co/xq4QLKLfpi
According to the nonpartisan @TaxPolicyCenter, the House GOP tax bill would increase taxes on 31% of middle class Americans over the next 10 years. Nearly 1/2 of the benefits of the tax plan would go to the top 1%.
Our bipartisan Reach Act ensures that @USAID delivers a comprehensive strategy that puts proven, cost-effective interventions to work to save the lives of mothers &amp; babies

Given the troubling pattern of the President's personal intervention by interviewing candidates for U.S. Attorneys in key jurisdictions, this forced resignation makes me concerned about improper interference with the Justice Department.

I actually think @POTUS *should* sit down w Vladimir Putin‚Ä¶to tell him not to interfere in US elections again.
To truly promote stability in Asia-Pacific, @POTUS should emphasize our values &amp; ask these countries to improve their human rights records.
Focusing solely on econ/security interests will send message that US will not stand up for oppressed &amp; hold them accountable to rule of law.

This reflects a disturbing trend at @EPA where @EPAScottPruitt is systematically subverting science as part of the policymaking process.

I agree w/ @SenatorCarper on tax reform: let's try this again, let's do this by working together &amp; let's do this the right way.
Safety net programs like #Medicare could be cut by $470 billion to balance the GOP‚Äôs tax cuts.

Investing in foreign aid is an investment in our own national security &amp; it‚Äôs not a primary driver of our national debt ‚Äì not by a long shot

So let‚Äôs work *together* on tax reform ‚Äì Republicans and Democrats ‚Äì so we can all support a bill that helps our country

With 10 hours of open debate left, this is not the time to stop calling. These next few hrs are CRITICAL.
Let me say that again: the non-partisan CBO says that the GOP‚Äôs ‚Äòskinny‚Äô bill would hike your insurance premiums by 20%
The non-partisan CBO says skinny repeal would make premiums 20% higher &amp; cause 16 million to lose coverage https://t.co/ugLLBd74ia
And it‚Äôs not just governors. Hospitals &amp; providers are against it, most Americans are against it ‚Äì so who exactly is the GOP trying to help?
Several Republican &amp; Democratic Governors wrote us last night to say they oppose the GOP‚Äôs ‚Äòskinny‚Äô bill: https://t.co/yYzqnKuykV
My GOP colleagues sound like they‚Äôre moving toward a ‚Äòskinny‚Äô repeal, but don‚Äôt be fooled by the name ‚Äì it would be a big, fat disaster
This isn‚Äôt a last minute homework assignment to finish before class, this is the American health care system!
There are reports that our Republican colleagues still don‚Äôt have an actual bill, and may write it *during lunch today*
There‚Äôs still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen today, but here‚Äôs what we do know.
Today could be the most important yet in protecting our healthcare - don‚Äôt stop calling, don‚Äôt stop fighting!
RT if you‚Äôre not done fighting for our right to health care - this is a battle we can still win
The idea that President Trump will negotiate tougher sanctions isn't credible. https://t.co/ji1vQhyqgA

@PPFA Are we done fighting back? No! We aren't going to give up on the Affordable Care Act. This fight isn't over yet.
Just joined @PPFA to speak about health care. We have another day to make our voices heard! https://t.co/EnwOfCyo8j

And 3. @USCBO found that 7 million fewer people would have coverage under #Medicaid under the "skinny repeal bill"
2. It would possibly also eliminate the employer mandate &amp; some of the #ACA's taxes on the health care industry
1. Eliminate #ACA's individual mandate ‚Äì sending our insurance markets into chaos &amp; increasing premiums for those who need coverage the most
This would be an #ACA repeal bill that eliminates only some of its measures. It would be a disaster. This bill would:
There is also discussion that Senate Republicans may move to what's being called a "skinny repeal bill" https://t.co/wFYbifEkYa
@USCBO We should be protecting coverage for vulnerable populations, not stripping it away!
@USCBO We‚Äôre also going to be voting on Democratic amendments that would protect Medicaid &amp; people with disabilities
.@USCBO estimated that this bill would double premiums &amp; leave 32 million more Americans uninsured by 2026
Here's what the Senate is doing today ‚Äì first, we're likely to vote on another repeal bill ‚Äì more info here https://t.co/OfIsxUSpWM

RT if you're not done fighting to protect health care for millions of Americans
If you're concerned about this, please call your Senators. Don't give up. This fight isn't over.
The only debate that will happen in the Senate over the coming days is to decide whether 20M or 30M Americans will be thrown off their h/c
But, we do know this - millions of Americans have made their voices heard, saying: don't cut #Medicaid &amp; don't throw me off my health care.
We don't even know the details of the bill they're moving to &amp; we don't know what the following days will bring.
This was not a good day in the Senate, but our fight to protect Americans‚Äô health care is not over by a long shot. https://t.co/pdeOBSpGDm
The Republican bills to repeal the Affordable Care Act - all of them - would be disastrous. I'm voting NO.
I'm concerned about the independence of the Justice Dept &amp; its ability to operate free from political interference. https://t.co/EsXOEWIF74
There is a disturbing trend across the Trump Administration of nominating people whose main qualification is loyalty, with ties to Russia.
Today, I questioned Brian Benczkowski, nominee to be Asst. AG in the Criminal Division of the DOJ, about his ties to a Russian bank.
Every single version of these bills makes deep cuts to Medicaid &amp; leaves over 20 mil people uninsured. Every. Single. Version.
No matter how they change it or what they rename it, these GOP attempts to repeal the ACA would be devastating.
Sixth time is not the charm. These GOP bills would take away health care from millions &amp; increase out-of-pocket costs https://t.co/m24N4B4068
It is crucial that the House, the Senate, &amp; the WH enact sanctions quickly &amp; protect our democracy moving forward: https://t.co/CY3Fki002a
The Senate voted to pass sanctions on Russia w/bipartisan support &amp; members of the House should also ensure that Russia is held accountable.
We will not stand for Russian government actions that undermine our democracy.
Russia must pay a price for its interference in our 2016 election &amp; that starts by enacting sanctions.
Keep calling your senators, keep tweeting, keep working. This fight is not over.
Senate Republicans must abandon their plan to repeal the #ACA &amp; work w/ us to bring more affordable, more accessible, higher-quality care.
I am deeply disappointed in this legislative process ‚Äì we should know exactly what is in the bill &amp; debate it properly.
No public hearings, no final version, no consultations with health care experts. This is not how we improve our health care system.
Today, we are voting on a motion to proceed even though we have no idea what version of the health care bill we will be voting on.

Let's keep fighting for public hearings &amp; debates with health care experts, ins companies, patients, etc.
Thousands of Delawareans have called &amp; contacted my office. I hear you &amp; will continue to fight to protect your care.
Millions of Americans gained coverage thanks to the #ACA ‚Äì and they would lose that coverage under #Trumpcare.
RT if you agree: Republicans should drop their repeal plan &amp; work together w/ Democrats to protect health care.
TOGETHER, we can fix the problems of the #ACA &amp; improve it so that it works for every American. Let's do this the right way.
Senate Rs still trying to jam thru a h/c bill this week. We don't fully know what's in this version, but we know all versions are a disaster
Proud to join Senate Dems in sending letter to HHS questioning @SecPriceMD's plans to slash funding for TPP Program: https://t.co/soJSbpXRWY
TPP Program is successful, bipartisan, &amp; making a vital contribution to building a body of knowledge of what works to prevent teen pregnancy
TPP Program has served nearly 1.2 million youth in 40 states, supporting sexual health behaviors that help avoid unintended pregnancy
Ending funding for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program is short-sighted &amp; will only make it harder to prevent unintended pregnancies
