@AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic He'd be tilting at windmills but it would be great to have a credible candidate. He probably knows about Aleppo and is not likely to run around on stage naked.
@ezralevant @general1776 To be fair he ran over the cop's toe beforehand. So there's that.
@Rainmaker1973 You might preface this by explaining that the final face is that of the artist and so diffuse, somewhat, any racist implications. Clearly the statement is personal and not intended as such.

@wildbez @RealCandaceO @prageru @therealroseanne I like Rosanne. She's got great heart. Her sitcoms are amoung the few worth watching. However in that world everything is a promotion. Expect to see the shocking sex tapes any time now.
@realDailyWire Insects have huge potential in recycling and reducing food waste. We need not eat them directly if they're used as feed for animals we prefer such as chicken. They can be rendered into forms that are entirely palatable. This is the future if we're going to feed 10B people.

@JimReed78579466 Unfortunately Mitt is inevitable. When the choice is between Mitt and a Sanders clone we're going to hold our noses and vote for Romney. The majority of voters are center right were he is positioned. That he was able to win in MA is proof of his viability.
@catturd2 That's a pretty strong statement for a self professed turd. I'm not  avocating her crazy politics but you can't deny that she has effective marketing and branding. If you doubt me ask yourself who has better name recognition her or you.
@tinyredbook Given that image you have to wonder why the Creator didn't order them pre-sliced.
@GobAbiertoBOL @AOC She's smarter than she's given credit for. Policy is boring. Recipes and dating advice are of more interest. The more she humanizes herself the more her supporters identify with her.
@MollyJongFast Yup
@catturd2 You underestimate Mitt. He sees an opportunity and is positioning himself to exploit it. He is looking out two election cycles. When Trump is finished Romney's turn will come again.
@BreitbartNews He won't get prison time. He has $$$ for a good defense. If he's charged a jury trial in Chicago will win in an acquittal. It's not even clear that his career is over. A good PR effort could revive him and Curtis is probably the thin edge of that wedge.

@KaczTed @BradMarshv1 See Portugal. The claim that now is not the time is desingenuous. Organic chemistry offers almost endless possibilities of this sort. Prohibition is always a failure.

@DocVoliday @SiddonsDan Why all this is a mystery? They removed a lobe and media wonders why she's not at work the next day. That she hasn't passed a clot and died defies odds.

@nickgillespie It's clear that the current situation is corrupt and unworkable. We want free passage but we have a legit interest in a boundary. Trumps policies have been good. The alternative is the progressive left.
@nickgillespie In my view there are two things to be had from the border controversy. 1. We arrive at a somewhat reasonable policy that re-establishes the rule of law. 2. Trump exploits it tactically to get another term.
