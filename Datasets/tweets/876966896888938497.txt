@asherdelion @BetoORourke @tedcruz The condition parts of California are in are horrific. We don’t need that in Texas. Period. He’s so Left-leaning it’s pathetic. You don’t see that?? This economy is thriving, and he wants to impeach the president. WTH? Most of the money is for his campaign are NOT from within TX!
@Dusquene8 @BarackObama Yes, that’s what I’m referring to. Disgusting
@asherdelion @BetoORourke @tedcruz He’s chair on 2 subcommittees. If that’s what you’re going to base your decision on, that’s sad. “Beto” will Bring California to Texas. Do you honestly want that? That’s sad if true https://t.co/XUSDGZhwFd

@asherdelion @BetoORourke @tedcruz There are 16 Senate committees with several subcommittees under each one. It’s a little difficult to be the chair of one of the 16 committees, however he is chair on a couple of the subcommittees. It looks like it’s pretty evenly dispersed.
@asherdelion @BetoORourke @tedcruz The majority of his miss votes looks like when he was running, like Marco Rubio was, for the Republican presidential nominee. I’m not going to hold that against him at all. That’s ridiculous......but of course it’s a good talking point for “Beto” 🙄 https://t.co/YiSoC5R0v4
@asherdelion @BetoORourke @tedcruz Do you know what type of bipartisan bills were brought forward he didn’t agree with? What about Kates law? What’s your stance on illegal immigration? I know where Ted Cruz stands on it and it’s not about open borders. What about impeachment? You for that too?
