@tnacgal @RNRTennessee @natalie_allison @AndyHolt4TN @TheTNHoller @Gannett @USATODAY @Tennessean @davidplazas Casada, who was aware of these allegations, appointed him to the education administration subcommittee anyways. That shows me that Casada is not responsible enough to legislative over children either. What I want is for them both to leave, but most urgently, Byrd.
@tnacgal @RNRTennessee @natalie_allison @AndyHolt4TN @TheTNHoller @Gannett @USATODAY @Tennessean @davidplazas Also my uncle (shannondale, late 1960’s, n. Knoxville). His coach wasn’t punished either. Just transferred. I don’t want Byrd bringing this pattern of behavior back, and I think this is a realistic concern. His judgment towards any sexual abuse is already tainted with pervy bias.
@tnacgal @RNRTennessee @natalie_allison @AndyHolt4TN @TheTNHoller @Gannett @USATODAY @Tennessean @davidplazas The reason I bring up Byrd is because those protesters were also removed from a town hall, a day or two ago.They didn’t throw anything, or do anything “wrong”, but they were still removed.

@RNRTennessee @natalie_allison @AndyHolt4TN @TheTNHoller @Gannett @USATODAY @Tennessean @davidplazas Protests are news, how the legislation handles them is news, Byrd is news, and so is this arrest.

@NashvilleResist @TNGOP Of course, it was baby daddy who got the mom on them. She was 14 and he was like 35 when it started. That’s where they were probably going when they left the kid. No one said anything when she was a 14 yo being preyed upon by much older, smarter, “man”.
@NashvilleResist @TNGOP But if they get off the drugs, they should be able to get the kids back without too many fines. I’ve had pill heads just leave their kids (toddlers) at my old home, without even telling me. So I just get to find the baby running around in an unfinished concrete basement.

@LisaCarole1 @NRA Shouldn’t the evidence speak for itself? This nra post is trying to perpetuate a “good guy with a gun” narrative, but his dad is still fucking dead at the end of the day, and the nra makes money from us buying guns out of fear of a danger that THEY perpetuate.
@LisaCarole1 @NRA Why does the nra have to spend millions pushing a narrative like good people wont be able to get them, so we can’t do anything. Or alternatively, ANY legislation (even reasonable ones) is doomed to fail because criminals don’t follow laws, so we should, AGAIN, do nothing.

@washingtonpost This is a very stupid time for political in fighting. They’re only going against that Omar woman because she’s easier to go after than republicans because she’s Muslim (an even smaller minority in federal office) . This is such an embarrassing clusterfuck.
@LisaCarole1 @NRA Why would you support people whose livelihoods are based on doing nothing about you having someone try to kidnap you at gun point and threaten you? That’s pretty backwards,I’d think you’d want to stop it from happening to others, but I guess not? Is this what you want for us too?

@timburchett We are in THE MIDDLE OF A PILL EPIDEMIC producing parentless children, and y’all’s MAIN focus is to stifle those kids getting any home while systematically reducing women’s healthcare and abortion. But noooooooooo gay parents is too much. Is it because of those “beliefs” though?

@AndyHolt4TN @BillLeeTN If he really cared about rural communities he would get rid of Byrd. Sevier co has had two national cases of child abuction and sexual abuse by teachers in 2-3 years.

@goaliebotishere @johncardillo @Barnes_Law He got a swat team called on him, so yeah, pretty malicious.
@Balenciaga90 @Swamp_Sagacity @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews What he really deserves is a participation trophy; that’s all he did. Why is he being pitied so hard? He was also harassing people (specifically the women protestors) just like that Phillips guy that lied about his service.
@Balenciaga90 @Swamp_Sagacity @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews It really doesn’t.
@DTraumaangel @johncardillo @Barnes_Law Hogg got doxxed and a false swat hit called in on thanks to right wing media, but it’s still okay for this kid to file a libel lawsuit and get rewarded with a trip to the White House for doing literally nothing but get picked on on the internet.
@johncardillo @Barnes_Law When it’s David Hogg, it’s okay though? The things I saw people say about him were much worse than these kids. Could he sue conservative organizations like the nra for  hosting Katie Maddox, or Ingraham for the Stalinist Russia debacle?
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews What is your damage?
@Swamp_Sagacity @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews I think it’s not news and that this is a frivolous lawsuit to grab the news cycle for political opportunism. Why is the president inviting some dumb kid to the white house? He didn’t do anything good or impressive and he’s being rewarded for being a victim.
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews You’re just trying to twist my words now. See- blatant double standard ^
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews Ahh you’re doubling down on the “he asked for it” defense. By that logic, prolong the this news cycle will only perpetuate this backlash. Why is freedom of speech only important for you? Did you see him screaming calling women baby killers? Is that asking for it?
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews This kid got a pr team, and you’re saying Hogg “asked for it”. God save us all.
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews Your argument is literally “he asked for it” for being a public figure. So did the other kid when he started publically being an asshole, knowing he was on camera in a public place.
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews He got doxxed, he got death threats. What’s the difference? This kid is doing the exact same thing, but with mommy and the president’s blessing. He didn’t do anything but stand there and look smug, why don’t you care when kids are actually dying?
@superbucks2050 @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews That’s not an answer to the blatant double standard given to these two minors.
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews Oh but he went to a *public* school🙃🙃🙃
@1foreverseeking @Barnes_Law @BreitbartNews When it’s David Hogg, it’s okay though? The things I saw people say about him were much worse than these kids. Could he sue conservative organizations like the nra for  hosting Katie Maddox, or Ingraham for the Stalinist Russia debacle?

@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law If it were my kid, I would use this as an opportunity to teach them Native American history to the best of my capacity, even if I felt ambivalent about who was “right” in the situation. The kid needs to at least understand the context of the situation he stumbled into.
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law *news (typo +autocorrected to easy)
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law They are artificially trying to prolong it. I agree that this really isn’t easy and all groups are the assholes in this situation. Why should the guy with the feverent base and start up capital from mommy profit over the others, which were also the assholes?

@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law I mean people actually get shot every day and most don’t get the help that this guy is getting. They’re setting up a go fund me now, just proving my point. They literally want to be victims, it’s profitable politically, and potentially monetarily.
@longmanphoto @Barnes_Law @Cernovich 💸💸💸🗑
@Barnes_Law Writing a narrative of persecution over others doesn’t make you a fighter; it makes you a victim.
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law A stunning example of cheap political posturing. The lawyer’s self description is “political gambler”. Writing your own narrative of persecution over others does not make you a fighter, it makes you a victim. https://t.co/pQB1Co7A25
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law Then why a pr firm? Would you do that for your kid? That wouldn’t be happening in my family. The news cycle turns over so fast, that by getting a pr firm, it looks like he is actually trying to drag this out. Why not just wait for the next stupid thing to take the spotlight off?
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law It’s a faux attack on this kid. He’s fine. He’s protected, even though EVERYBODY in that video made an ass of themselves. They could just let it pass, but because EVERYONE made an ass of themselves, he wants to play the role of a persecuted trump supporter and get famous for it.
@wits_mcgee @Barnes_Law The gop LITERALLY made a post telling us to send brick to chuck and nancy the other day. Hate crimes have risen based on unchangeable human traits like ancestry and sexuality. Why does he get MORE help than the rest of us? I think that’s what’s upsetting.

@telepastor @MarshaBlackburn You don’t have to worry about it til it comes to child support so save the virtue signaling for someone who will buy it.

@rewillson7 I’m looking through the yelp reviews on our local one, they are mixed, but lean positive. They offer iud services(which lasts 3-5 years with a short procedure, the pill (there were problems with refills), morning after pill (cheaper than Walgreens).Ours even has the gardasil shot
@rewillson7 But there were actual, respectful conversations covering regulation in the thread, which leads me to believe that you just saw the post, and without reading the arguments by several local people, just decided that you wanted to be mad at something.
@rewillson7 You don’t deserve my health care information, and because there’s not one helping YOUR sister doesn’t mean they aren’t helping others. Again, much of this is related to safety codes and inspectors, and how they feel about it personally. Maybe that’s why you don’t have a good one.
@telepastor @MarshaBlackburn At least read it before it before you start squealing, it’s not that hard😃
@rewillson7 Why would I ever give that information away on twitter? It’s none of your business.
@SewCowSki @joepa51 @MarshaBlackburn And honestly it looks like other clinics have taken up that model for more general bangs and bumps, but pp still stands out as a low cost clinic for female healthcare needs.

@DavidJSmith10 @Ginahall816 @MarshaBlackburn Svante paabo wrote a very well explained book on it that goes over older and more modern theories, it’s called “Neandertal man” (no h now, don’t ask me why) it’s a very good read.

@RyanAFournier @MAGAindex @realDonaldTrump His agenda of having several failed businesses? Or the anti immigrant one?
@Ehendr @DLoesch She inherited it from her husband who got it before modern regulations, but who could have also purchased it legally.
@STP48315 @MarshaBlackburn I don’t think PP is extreme.  Sure it’d be great to get money out of politics, but that would have to be mutual, and republicans don’t really like playing fair imo, so I’m not holding my breath.
@Ehendr @DLoesch It wasn’t sold, but if it had been sold privately there would have at least been the discretion of the seller, who I doubt would have sold it to her, but there is no standard for inherited guns. You’re right about expos for the most part, but it’s likey easier here even at expos.
@StephenPBarber @MarshaBlackburn You too!
@STP48315 @MarshaBlackburn We don’t rely on guns, we rely on family planning. And the nra pays a lot of reps, like Marsha. So does PP’s political arm. Both also receive donations from the public. The PP is a rare, ironic, example of the libs “having some balls”. Why is it okay for the nra and not PP?
@STP48315 @MarshaBlackburn Because of people like Marsha trying to defund them. Their political pac is also a financially separate entity.
@StephenPBarber @MarshaBlackburn You have not done that, have not read the actual debates just on this thread, even when I have replied to your talking points *specifically*, and you’re projecting.
@Ehendr @DLoesch Did you even read what you were replying to? Lots of gun sales (including private ones between people) and gun inheritances fall outside of federally mandated background checks. No one with a lick of common sense would have even agreed to sell her that gun, she inherited it.
@Ehendr @DLoesch Maybe not in Minnesota it’s easy down here.
@GlenCasada Will Byrd be shuffling around predators like we’ve had in the past? Should girls just avoid athletics to avoid creeper coaches, cause y’all aren’t gonna do anything, apparently😒
@lgosnell @MarshaBlackburn What about the child support? What about the unbridled wage garnishment and actual imprisonment for child support? Interestingly, third parties like Young Williams are now somehow being out sourced for child support collection; why? So this is a men’s issue as well.

@timburchett @AOC But they greatly contribute to our productivity in a capitalist system. So we’re already a mixed economy. You can’t work if you’re sick or uneducated. I feel like “socialism” is more of a scary buzzword than anything.
@timburchett @AOC Okay but all programs using taxpayer money for the good of the population is technically socialist. It’s redistributing money for the common good. The new deal was pretty socialist, public schools, the federal interstate system are pretty socialist too, are they not?
@Ginahall816 @americanstorm @MarshaBlackburn ^ pretty much sums up the republican position on this. For a woman Republican Senator to auntie tomi like this is just a slap in the face.
@Lawdogsam @MarshaBlackburn You benefit from women having access to birth control, you realize this don’t you?
@Jacquie47476562 @MarshaBlackburn That’s what the federal funding covers now. It doesn’t cover abortion, Marsha’s goal is to whittle down a political enemy at our expense. She would be defunding the “good” parts of planned parenthood, that offer medical services to women (not abortion),
@shelba9000 @Jacquie47476562 @Ginahall816 @MarshaBlackburn This is from my knowledge of the women I know. I do know one woman who abused it and even the libtardiest of us think that’s deeply wrong. But that’s one individual who doesn’t represent most users of abortions.

@carowilk56 @WGONLinda @MarshaBlackburn It was a joke. Looks like the snowflake is on the other foot now lol
@DanMinute @MarshaBlackburn Reproduction is important to the entire country’s future. Imagine the insane child support without taxpayer supported birth control. Is that what you want?
@StephenPBarber @MarshaBlackburn That’s not happening. No taxpayer is paying for women to get abortions. Educate yourself, get off that Fox Koolaid diet.
@Ginahall816 @MarshaBlackburn Access to honest information is very important, and so is regulation. Yet some of these regulations have nothing to do with the medical safety of a facility and its staff, but only to make it less possible that women can physically reach an open abortion clinic.
@Ginahall816 @MarshaBlackburn I think the vast, VAST majority of people believe that abortion shouldn’t be a method of birth control.
@carowilk56 @WGONLinda @MarshaBlackburn Iif I can’t afford birth control I definitely can’t afford a kid. But don’t worry, my womb’s locked up tighter than Mike Pence’s repressed sexuality.
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn Mostly. I’d base legislative views on whether the baby/fetus is capable of feeling pain.  There isn’t a propensity for well-being without a propensity for pain.
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn It is if we keep it that way.
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn I disagree with late term abortions though.
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn Roe v Wade is the law of the land. That law ordained by god, right? Nevermind separation of church &amp; state and its implications on what is human and can be murdered. Considering an unviable pregnancy human necessitates the belief in a soul, which is inherently religious.
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn I have three adopted siblings and a foster brother and I’m still saying this. I love them more than just about anything, but we still shouldn’t willingly throw away our rights.
@WGONLinda @MarshaBlackburn I didn’t agree that abortion was murder, but it not really something anyone wants to do or to have happen in their lives. I agreed that that baby would have be better of without me. I think adoption is absolutely wonderful, but it’s illogical to give away your options.
@Ginahall816 @MarshaBlackburn How do you help babies, Gina?
@Filth2Faith @MarshaBlackburn I wouldn’t want my baby to be born in these times. If you really wanted to stop women from getting abortions you should work towards reducing them. You’d need to understand why women feel they need them and ameliorate those circumstances, but that would actually take work🙃
@WGONLinda @MarshaBlackburn No thanks to Marsha.
@WGONLinda @MarshaBlackburn I agree. That’s why I have birth control.
@MarshaBlackburn If ~1/4 of women get raped, how many end up pregnant? How many of their lives are derailed because of the things people who can’t have children decide for the rest of us without our consent or even an opportunity for representation (especially since Marsha doesn’t do free gigs).
@rstfirearms @MarshaBlackburn @RandPaul @McConnellPress McConnell can’t even watch over his own state, let alone this hack.
@MarshaBlackburn Oh so you’re taking away our access to low cost birth control, breast exams, etc. As a Tennessee woman I want to retain my rights following roe v Wade and my access to to female healthcare resources. When you gonna set up your email address, by the way?

@BrettTMazzoni @KamalaHarris I know a guy who recently passed out with a needle in his arm and almost lost it due to an infection. Does that happen with pot heads?
@medwoman1 @KamalaHarris Federal hemp legalization just happened, and that’s related to why it was outlawed in the first place, so maybe they’ll surprise us and work together,it’d be pretty cool. It would also be an opportunity to check pot charges with criminal justice reform since that’s a common goal.
@medwoman1 @KamalaHarris I do too, but if medical was viable and recreational was not, I would still be happy to see epileptics, cancer patients, and the chronically old benefit from something that could be passed with bipartisan support. Republicans seem to be coming around on it though imo.
@markeightyeight @KamalaHarris There are people actively researching and developing new tests for this rn, but developing something comparable to a blood alcohol level scale will probably prove more challenging in practice.
@BrettTMazzoni @KamalaHarris Wow. Do you know any crackheads or pillheads?
@KamalaHarris It should also allow people with nonviolent offenses to get licenses to practice legitimately instead of allowing big industry to sweep in immediately. I think vice has covered this issue in New York or New Jersey. Medical for epileptics should take precedent b4 recreational tho

@bvkv09 You shouldn’t need help with your mortgage if you’re in the “top 5% of us income” ESPECIALLY if it’s a reasonably priced house. So why do you think a hand out would be better spent on you than some one who is NOT making the money you are?
@bvkv09 Any why are you “in the top 5% of incomes” while working at large nonprofits? That seems pretty disconcerting.

Even if she was *technically* correct, she shouldn’t have done that, and she should have already been aware of tribal membership issues, which makes her look like she really doesn’t care. When her platform is basically “caring”.
@CheriJacobus @JoeBiden I agree that Joe Biden would be a much better pick than Warren- I am a TN democrat. I feel like warren is all talk and no bite, AND we need to remember that we need independent and moderate republican support because clearly the popular vote isn’t enough.
@jennycohn1 @LauraMallory2 @gregolear All the while, the economy in the Kentucky is so poor, people tell you not to drive through towns like Hazard. No jobs and lots of pills. You’d think he’d try to help his own people, but that would actually be doing his job🙄🙄🙄

@ufomechanic @tonydlaw @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump Which would show that the senator must have known about these additional factors, and failed to mention them, which still makes his statements less than true. A half truth.The wall contributed to some degree, but he made no effort to parse out different contributing factors. Why?
@ufomechanic @tonydlaw @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump Of course it’s going to look accurate when the guy who gave outdated numbers sent others to search for these updated numbers. There obvious partisanship shown, and THEN the link YOU shared cited why the wall was not the only contributor to the decrease in illegal immigration.
@ufomechanic @tonydlaw @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump So the same guy that gave outdated numbers, commissioned this report to confirm his claim?🤔
@ksondere @peterdaou Would a wall fix the economic ramifications? No matter how deep you dig it, a deeper tunnel can be dug. Is it worth 5 billion? Not imo.
@ksondere @peterdaou We should crack down on employers. They’ll hire these people and let them get wholesale deported while they’re at work, after paying them crumbs. It happened in Murfreesboro a few months ago and they only left (3/~120) employees because they had dependant infants at home.
@ksondere @peterdaou I see that you’re *trying* here, but you’re leaving out important pieces,
@ksondere @peterdaou Who? I’ve never heard republicans I know, let alone democrats actually support people private prisons, even when I’m in “Trump country”.
@ksondere @peterdaou 3rd- who’s been making money from opiods? I know my senator @MarshaBlackburn has. In that way she can profit off of all the pill heads and heroin addicts that she sends to @CoreCivic. A REPUBLICAN senator carrying on the irresponsible actions of another republican @SenAlexander.
@ksondere @peterdaou First of all, y’all are just as responsible. We all profit from undervalued immigrant labor. 2nd of all, how did our opiod was epidemic get so bad? It affects demand and when the pills run out criminals will meet the demand, because that’s what criminals do.
@bdell21 @MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump Out of how many in total? Do you math? Do you even know what the difference between anecdotal and statistically relevant? Maybe you should learn enough statistics to at least know how to interpret data from the news.
@Kanew @jhollymc It also allows *certain individuals* in government to profit from deleterious policies to at risk communities, with whom these *certain individuals* are out of touch. All under the guise of “saving money” through outsourcing. It’s pretty sickening.

@JillianInc @redismyfavorit3 @DLoesch It goes back population history of central and South America. It has to do with the fact that England came to the US with a setter population, while many Spaniards in the south did not bring wives, and had kids with native peoples and African slaves.

@LRPerry4 @redismyfavorit3 @DLoesch “All over this world the US pays for other countries walls; statistics tell us they work 95% of the time” no government has legitimately made this claim, and that’s why it’s #FakeNews.

@FishingReelsNC @lmb6453 @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @DLoesch Why is it okay for her but not them? What makes her special?
@tnacgal Do you know what home economics is? It’s what our grandmothers had to teach themselves, but she wasted an education on it. She was on the communications and technology subcommittee. What do you think she knows about either of those things?
@redismyfavorit3 @FishingReelsNC @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch But it’s a lot easier to criticize than figure out a solution. It’s a very broad problem.
@redismyfavorit3 @FishingReelsNC @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch I think that we should clarify the labor end of things. We could probably redo work visas and set them up for a path to citizenship. It would be better imo to incentivize people with a path than just punish them for doing what we really want, working.

@FishingReelsNC @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch Illegal immigration will never just totally stop. If we wait for things that will never happen, then we’ll never get anything done. We have to work on the different parts of the issue simultaneously. Including those backlog asylum judges. They are legitimately trying legally.
@redismyfavorit3 @DLoesch You gonna fund it? Congress won’t.
@Jaredha38774349 @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Holes don’t discriminate. It doesn’t take a drug cartel to dig a tunnel, are you listening? I already said holes don’t discriminate. This is getting repetitive.

@FishingReelsNC @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch 1. Where you getting those hypothetical numbers for 2. Using poverty and etc etc is a false dichotomy. We don’t stop wars for attempting to help homeless vets, either. We do both, simultaneously.
@redismyfavorit3 @FishingReelsNC @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch It’s helpful for those immigrants for now, but it’s a bandaid on a broken system, and our solution seems to just be a political revolving door, where nothing ever actually changes.
@Jaredha38774349 @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Anyone can dig a hole. Holes don’t discriminate.
@Jaredha38774349 @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage So what if a wall had motion detectors. How much constant man power would have to be present at the border for that to work? How much does THAT cost, and do we have to foot the bill for that too? That’s even more of a money pit.
@Jaredha38774349 @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Is digging a hole that hard lol?
@FishingReelsNC @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch We could hire more. It’d probably go further than that wall would for much cheaper, over time.
@FishingReelsNC @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch Funny you should say that lol. Did you know about the repatriations of the dead in the desert out of a tx university?
@redismyfavorit3 @DLoesch Mostly though it’s just that a wall is just too stupid to actually work.
@redismyfavorit3 @DLoesch Are you really gonna say that when trump campaigned on anti Hispanic rhetoric. Remember the “criminals and rapist comments” that was about “all Mexicans”, which many Americans assume any Hispanic person they see is Mexican. So it’s not nationalism, it’s just racism.
@Jaredha38774349 @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Then tell me how they work and why that other guy felt the need to juxtapose sneaky misleading information to push his point?
@FishingReelsNC @redismyfavorit3 @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch If it’s OUR backlog then it is our problem, too. We have to have a working relationship with Mexico, and this doesn’t seem to be working for anyone.

@redismyfavorit3 @FishingReelsNC @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch So if someone is at the end of that backlog and is never reviewed, are they just Stateless in Mexico, waiting until they die? Surely Mexico isn’t granting de facto citizenship either.
@GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage So you can’t even prove to me that this random graph you pulled off the internet is even related to Harvard or relays information from a real study. You basically just linked an op ed as a “source”, so imma have to call bs here.
@GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage That screenshot doesn’t have a source, and there are spelling errors (weird since it was published by Harvard, right) Also the link you provided was not to the study or how it was conducted, it was just talking about when the wall was built.
@GoofyTEDuB @_BLUNTOBJECT @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage That’s an extreme statistic and I need a source.
@gjysta @_kayla_bayla__ @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage You can’t even answer simple questions about why anyone would do this. Why would you encourage others to waste their hard earned money on it? You don’t even know why YOU are doing it.
@FishingReelsNC @SarahCateCLE @lmb6453 @DLoesch And if they aren’t Mexicans? What if they’re refugees from further south with which we have asylum agreements? I heard the backlog is over half a million(idk if that’s the southern boarder or global and I don’t have the source) Where do they go?
@GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Lol okay, source?
@_BLUNTOBJECT @GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage 33% decrease in 6 years. Would the numbers be sustained for a long term period of time, probably not. So the decrease of illegal immigrants was subpar at best. For how many billions of dollars? Is it worth it when we definitely want the labor which we can exploit? Sad but true...
@gjysta @_kayla_bayla__ @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Why should his poor rural supporters go from him saying another country would pay for it, to trying to get people like my grandma to pay for it? Who is trump even negotiating with? Our government or us? He’s screwing us out of money just like he screwed his contractors.
@GoofyTEDuB @joshmerbitz @Jaredha38774349 @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage And yet still so many thousands every year? That wall doesn’t even sound like it worked very well. Why would this one work?
@gjysta @_kayla_bayla__ @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Why should my grandma donate? She’s not an idiot, but she doesn’t understand this political theater, either.
@KittyMurks @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Why tho? That guy’s going to take the money and run when it falls through, which it inevitably will.
@gjysta @_kayla_bayla__ @VoteMarsha @BrianKolfage Why the hell should they do that? Many of his supporters voted for him because of a perceived need for money, and now his sycophants would ask his rural supporters to foot the bill on top of their taxes? Sounds like a scam, like Trump University.

@TNGOP You still have to go through rigorous application processes for grants, not that y’all would be aware 🤣🤣🤣 They still have to be granted by the state. But if you want to talk about that, let’s talk about why Marsha took that CoreCivic AND Lockheed Martin money. Hmmm🤔🤔🤔
@MountainValues @MarshaBlackburn https://t.co/l7HoeHGpH5
@SenAlexander Did no one in the senate think, hmmm opioids... Opium war(with your vast knowledge of history) maybe we should look at those “long term” studies (with your knowledge of healthcare, of course).
@SenAlexander How did this happen to begin with?
@askforcawmbyok Not true. Lots of us work or have worked there and come from parents that did the same, sometimes grandparents that did the same.
@psgamer92_kevo Conservatives have Qanon😂😂😂
@TNGOP @knoxnews @VoteMarsha She will do their bidding even if it hurts us. Even if it’s for political theater. Do you want a WWE style senate? I know it’s entertaining, but is it worth it when it comes to our future?
@VoteMarsha @SenJohnson You literally got 20k from Fox this cycle. Calm down.
@PhilBredesen *Handed over to collections
@PhilBredesen Also how do unpaid medical debts to a hospital affect service prices, if at all? For example, infrequent emergency room visits for people without insurance? I hear debts are erased eventually, but they handed over to collects, right? What happens there?
@PhilBredesen Also, non-pill contraception are cost prohibitive without insurance,even though they are much more effective in reality than the pill. Unintended pregnancies could be reduced outright if an IUD didn’t cost like 800$ without Tenncare.
@PhilBredesen My generic meds cost 31$ for a 30 day supply. I can afford this, but just barely without Tenncare. The brand name is $2000 a month. The lack of cost effectiveness would negate the benefit of this drug.

@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha But Marsha has no accomplishments to speak of, but quite a few big mistakes. This isn’t a presidential election, it’s a senate election. If you want to vote for an idiot, that’s your prerogative and your right, but as someone go deals with sick people, I’d hope for more empathy.

@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha Because of the NINE reasons I outlined above. Do you have any reason that includes Marsha, to vote for Marsha? You seem to forget that Marsha=/= Trump, and she hasn’t done ANYTHING to deserve this job from either side. How has she helped ANYONE here?
@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha 9. She will NEVER own up to her mistakes. We automatically assume politicians are corrupt, but it’s all out in the open for you to look up, and she STILL won’t acknowledge it or apologize for the pills at the very least.
@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha 8. She took money from a private prison corporation named CoreCivic, 19,100$. A “small” campaign donation, but why would anyone wanting work for the people take money from this *particular* form of privatization? My assumption is that they want to set up here, not good for us.
@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha 7a. She used this position to get courted by lobbyists, and worked against consumer interests repeatedly, and tries to avert attention to this by asking FB guy about diamond&amp;silk, which is an important conversation, but was the wrong time and place for it.
@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha 6a. This can be seen in the placements of many of her campaign offices, such as her office on Western, a clearly not well planned decision.	7. She had a position on the Technology and Communications sub committee in congress, with a home economics degree
@KyleK1x @VoteMarsha 4. None of her personal advertisements qualify her accomplishments, BUT the vast majority DO mischaracterize the actions and beliefs of her opponents.	5. She has claimed many times( at least 4) that her campaign is grassroots- a lie.	6. She doesn’t know where her constituents are

@colbeyreagan @mopatty3 @reynoldsr504 @PhilBredesen Yeah, everything is so polarized now, it’s difficult to be critical of our own side. But this was a critically bad call,  and I hope he realizes it.
@colbeyreagan @mopatty3 @reynoldsr504 @PhilBredesen As *unbelievably ignorant* as his statement was, it’s not worth it for me to sit out. But I will tell my friends and let them make that decision for themselves, instead of playing him up into something he is not.
@colbeyreagan @mopatty3 @reynoldsr504 @PhilBredesen I know that all the pills are worse than what has always been the status quo. I know that Marsha should never have been on the communications and technology subcommittee with a home economics degree, and I know this has already affected me and my family.
@colbeyreagan @mopatty3 @reynoldsr504 @PhilBredesen I guess, but what about risking something worse for ourselves?
@PhilBredesen What’s worse is the blatant failed attempt at playing both sides. If you believe her AND support kavenaugh then it would imply that you really don’t give a shit. You shook my hand and looked me in the eye..so just how and why can you rationalize this? I wish you hadn’t done this.

@TeamTNCR @VoteMarsha Hey educated republicans, can you come up with a logically valid reason, based on BLACKBURN’S record, to vote for her? Why would she make a good leader?
@VoteMarsha @TeamTNCR Her gun question rebuttal was just her repeating “nra” 5 times in 30 seconds to fill the time. She didn’t address her previous drug money problems, even though she could have owned up to it then and salvaged a shred of dignity. Really knocked it out of the park👌
@JBOfromSuwanee @TeamTNCR @TNGOP @VoteMarsha @BillLeeTN @RhodesTNCR @AlexSchramTN @JonWilliams2015 @MCTNYR What is this even supposed to mean? Kids aren’t going to be abused BECAUSE you attempt to stop abuse. Lots of kids are sexually assaulted too. Why don’t you speak for them, the weak? Since you’re a bible scholar, right?
@JBOfromSuwanee @TeamTNCR @TNGOP @VoteMarsha @BillLeeTN @RhodesTNCR @AlexSchramTN @JonWilliams2015 @MCTNYR Not a very “scholarly” thing to say. You’re ignoring us. It’s very shameful.
@JBOfromSuwanee @TeamTNCR @TNGOP @VoteMarsha @BillLeeTN @RhodesTNCR @AlexSchramTN @JonWilliams2015 @MCTNYR Bredesen and Progressives think sexual assault is bad, and that scotus needs to be held to a higher standard than Louie ck. Why do you feel so scared?

@RonGant @realDonaldTrump In her gun question rebuttal she basically just repeated “nra” five time in thirty seconds in order to give a nonanswer to a question asking about specific plans. That leadership, tho😛
@tnhousegop @GlenCasada Three people lives were irrevocably changed by him. If not then, then now, and not in a good way. Why would you ask for that?
@dalton_temple @VoteMarsha Drugs&amp;greed and you know this. Why don’t you care about the harm she has already done?
@TNGOP Frank Colvett ought to know this.
@TNGOP This is falsifying private messages and you should campaign this way. Most people realize this isn’t real, but not all do. You are hoping to gain from this. You should not advertise like this @TNGOP #FakeNews
@VoteMarsha @NRA You said NRA 5 time in 30 seconds in a rebuttal to a gun question at the debate calling for a *specific* plan of action. You gave a nonanswer and literally just repeated the phrase “nra”. Every other answer was basically character attack of your opponent. Is this your leadership?
@PhilBredesen And her biggest regret? Not cutting public spending? Are you mf kidding me rn?!? She could have owned her horrible, deadly mistake, but she cowards away. Bredesen is talking about vocational training, for good jobs. And this is why I’m voting for @PhilBredesen .
@PhilBredesen Look at home Econ here talking about geopolitics, all indecipherably vague like ,“under obama we didn’t know who our allies were”. We’ve always known who our allies were. It’s not a zero sum game, but I don’t think Marsha knows basic history. She didn’t know about the Opium War..
@PhilBredesen Then she drops it, private internet only. Sounds like att, Comcast, Verizon et al. Charleston sc has free city WiFi. But there are some areas in the midlands where you have to drive 20-30 minutes to the combination PizzaHut/TacoBell. Surely we can meet somewhere in the middle?
@PhilBredesen She CONTINUALLY moves the goalpost from her previous (and VERY suspicious)tech&amp;com committee appointments and insane amounts of telecom lobbying money. She juxtaposes that debate to a free speech debate.I think this is to appeal to a sense of victimhood, but hell I got suspended2
@PhilBredesen Also when asked about infrastructure ironically speaks about wasteful spending and getting rid of parks and trails to fund roads. I like that Bredesen cut across the board aside from pub ed for road funding.
@PhilBredesen Also with the gun debate, how does one deal with a dangerously mentally ill person who inherits a gun? Asking for myself last April 😂😂😔
@PhilBredesen Just a debate funny, in Blackburn’s gun question rebuttal she said NRA 5 times in 30 seconds. She filled more of her time up repeating that phrase than laying out a *specific* plan, which the question called for.
@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen Fucking disgusting.

@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen Three women against a heavy drinking scotus nominee. Why didn’t the libs do it last time? Most rapes are never prosecuted, many are never reported. Maybe instead of being scared, you should learn how to “not put yourself in that situation” Just like we’ve had to.
@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen Don’t you see that the most right wing state is the one with the most water issues besides the Dakotas? Michigan, with Rick Snyder and Betsy Devos. How is our side fucking up the water and public education? Your side is the one that takes it away. And who wins for it. Us?

@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen Would he have found them at all without Marsha? Maybe so, but maybe not. A 16 year old didn’t deserve to die like that. Just like we don’t deserve having personal property destroyed or stolen by them. Do you think Marsha cares about that? She still won’t speak for herself.
@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen Because you don’t have a reason here. No logic, no explanations, no facts to work off of in regard to Blackburn. I know you like to troll. But this isn’t funny. I know someone who BURNED ALIVE because of a pillhead driver. He was young, how was he introduced to them?
@usernam96614015 @TNGOP @PhilBredesen The pills, the voting against violence against women act, abusing us like livestock for profit, thoughtlessly selling her votes. HOW do you support that? I’ll never understand the why.

Here’s a fun fact for y’all: repeat rapists are often caught for their rape after being imprisoned for something else, when their dna matches rape kit data. This is why lowering rape kit backlogs is important, even if they are passed their statute of limitations, even if indirect

@PhilBredesen It’s been a boon to my family which had 7 kids. I wouldn’t have had health coverage without it for most of my life. The increase in age for students under aca has continued to help me. Basic name brand prescriptions for very minor problems can cost you 2,000$ a month.

@Tuck6191 @thehill I’m disgusted with it too. Would you not call that Garland issue a stunt? When the bar is on the ground, these things happen.
@Tuck6191 @thehill Again there are a lot of reasons not to report when it happens. Many people don’t. There is also a statute of limitation on rape and sexual assault if the investigation were a criminal investigation, but it’s not. If I were her I’d have the same thing.
@Tuck6191 @thehill Victim blaming once again. Why would a psychology professor be keeping up with federal judges? Even If she had, y’all would’ve said the same thing.
@Tuck6191 @thehill It doesn’t go without saying. Shit is traumatizing even if it wasn’t successfully carried out. Minors usually think they’ll get in trouble because they were drinking, and then later just the pure shame. Why would they want anyone to know?

@Tuck6191 @thehill There are also people who have been raped, don’t forget about them. Why is it that part gets left off every time some republicans starts off on this trope?
@Tuck6191 @thehill You need to take rape more seriously.
@Tuck6191 @thehill Apparently that was too hard for him, as it is so many men in power. He should be held to a higher standard than comedians.
@Tuck6191 @thehill And all HE had to do was keep his dick in his pants.
@Tuck6191 @DonaldJesusTrum @thehill Event to discredit her. It’s like she’s damned if she does and she’s damned if she doesn’t.
@Tuck6191 @DonaldJesusTrum @thehill You’re calling a psychologist a lair in regards to her rape. When it’s s probably one of the reasons she became a psychologist. Despite the very real background odds that any given woman has been raped, this thread has used her profession, which was inevitably influenced by this

@IndepModerate @LAFGolfer @thehill Fox loves psychobabble when it works for their narrative. I’m surprised you haven’t picked up on it, or did fox teach you that word, too?

@mbonnett5 #TNSenateDebate How do you decide whether you will accept a large campaign contribution?
RT @wafflepop: @HouseGOP How about health care? Why nothing on that?		Oh yeah: tax cuts for rich were more important.
@HouseGOP Healthcare isn’t better, wages aren’t better in reality (where WE reside), Many of our taxes haven’t been cut, while the ultra wealthy‘s have. I wouldn’t say we’re better off now. I’d say we have different, and bigger, problems now.
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Pretty sure it’s not tho. I haven’t looked it up, I could be wrong.
@Ozzydome1 @VoteMarsha @Kimsparrow13 @mike_pence It’s only a violation of the Rome Statute🤷🏼‍♀️. But why should the general public have to be educated on international law? Marsha should have known, but she supported it anyways.
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Well there was a 20ft line out the building...in Sevieriville, mind you. We haven’t been that excited about anything since moon pie and Mountain Dew😂 At least not that I have seen, excluding tourism.
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence I certainly hope so, but I have my doubts.
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence It made me happier than a woman who can’t even vote for a violence against women act.
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Is that as bad as private prison money? Is it as bad as enabling this opiod epidemic for money? when she should have known there had been a trade war fought over it? She shouldn’t have needed some cocked up 1% addiction statistic, when there was historical precedent w/ China.
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Also Sevieriville=/= gatlinburg/pigeon forge. Sevieriville itself is rural, the tourism is mostly up in gburg and pigeon forge, so no he didn’t get the police to block traffic for his little event.
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence He looked me in the eye, shook my hand, asked my name, and fed us chili. Marsha feed y’all chili? I doubt she’d even look y’all square in the eye.  She’s too busy with Trump’s agenda. https://t.co/kqpv43a0KS
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Like Marsha ? What kind of political candidate REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT takes private prison money? More importantly, why did they want to give it to her? Privatization of prisons is one of the least moral things you can do. What immoral thing has Phil done that compares to this?
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence He had a full house in Sevieriville. It was wonderful❤️I bet Marsha couldn’t tell it from Gatlinberg or Pigeon Forge without a computer.
@debriley1997 @realbamamark @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Hey Debbie, I’m still wondering about your standards? Do you know what they mean? What do they mean to you?
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence Fox wouldn’t report on it, would they? Neither would the other right wing media because it doesn’t play to their narrative the way the Tibbets murder did. Other outlets have reported it.
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence I think it was trying to strong arm everyone into using it so it would work, which is still wrong. It was definitely a poor tax, but that doesn’t speak for Bredesen.
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence What about the at least 2 sexual assaults of non nationals kids (little ones) in custody?
@realbamamark @debriley1997 @VoteMarsha @mike_pence How so? Individual mandate? That was my biggest issue.

@JamesAlvinLee @TNGOP That’s where personal standards come in. Why does he need all of these training wheels, why such sympathy for his character? It’s been two years. A president doesn’t have the luxury of privacy, and a wiser man than Trump would have been keenly aware of that fact, going in.

@JimmyNashville1 @alpha_tyger @VoteMarsha @RonRamsey @JCPress The opiods came first. Most the drugs are coming from within. I’ve seen this with my own eyes. I don’t need fox or cnn or anyone else to tell me we have a problem with prescription opioids. It’s been happening for years. Marsha enabled it to happen. Greed, ignorance, or both?
@kylejosephhorn And I figure if Walmart can literally sell garbage, so can I.
@kylejosephhorn That’s because it’s used for a clothes hamper. Have you seen how much they cost at stores?

@ClownPundit @Tennessean @MarshaBlackburn @PhilBredesen Knows it at “autistic” levels? Some fringe guy on YouTube probably doesn’t know the answers better than anyone else either. Additionally, they are still drawing their information from the *evil genius* msm or other people  on radio or internet that are drawing from same sources.
@Tennessean Judging by those scabs, this was not a new addiction. That poor kid... my moms friend did that once, but i only had the flu. That kid is dying with bed sores while her mom gets high. Bed sores are such a sad thing to see, but on a little kid... what’s the world come to?

@usernam96614015 @VoteMarsha Clinton deregulated the internet, which allowed the dotcom bust, didn’t he? He wasn’t totally against deregulation.

@usernam96614015 @SenAlexander So I’d say doing this now, instead of after midterms is ridiculous. There has already been a very recent confirmation, including pretty much all the same people. After the midterms would better reflect the current will of the people.
@usernam96614015 @SenAlexander The republicans don’t care that they are working against the will of the majority of the country, not just those democrats.
@usernam96614015 @SenAlexander And they had ONE day to read it. AND more should be expected of someone nominated under such a dishonest white house, it doesn’t deserve the respect it used to.
@SenAlexander Why have a hearing before you’ve been able to view all the relevant documents? Yall have done this several times now.

@Gunnerbb61B @Talkmaster Well they can’t charge me for what I did with my gun afterwards, if I didn’t have a gun. I don’t think that possessing a gun will necessarily make you more likely to live. Anecdotally me having a gun would have meant that a death was more likely, even if it not my own death.
@Talkmaster @peterdaou Yeah, what is the worth of a soul? Does it matter where the soul comes from? Lastly, how much more will you tolerate?
@Talkmaster @peterdaou Ever heard of the law of diminishing marginal utility? Basically that.
@Talkmaster @peterdaou What gives the law its authority though? Is it us or God?
@Talkmaster @peterdaou rural girls that might otherwise be on the pill (as they’ll have to be the rest of their reproductive lives, anyways) will try for abstinence and fail. Imo it’s better to get teenagers used to it regardless of sexual activity, so they never have to make that choice.
@Talkmaster @peterdaou No it isn’t. These abstinence programs get funded by religious conservative programs that are often close but not directly related to a single govt official. We had a guy try to scare us into abstinence because HE had a porn addiction. Why was he let in? Most of the kids were 14.
@Talkmaster And unlike the guy referring to people as “footstools”, I have almost been shot, and saved myself. Without my own gun.
@Talkmaster Sometimes your own hands are the best defense. A gun will get you some garunteed time in court though. Consider that. Personally, I prefer the middleground of a concealed tiddy knife😂😂😂
@MadVickie @Talkmaster @peterdaou Yup. Pretty much, the burden is entirely on the woman, and if she fails, her child is worse off for it and so is she, the father can essentially just walk away.

@ThomasGries4 @SoulStealer25 @PressSec Or to make fun of their lethal disease? Hmmm... just so you know I’m not the leader of the free world. He ought to know better, but daddy’s coattails ensured that never happened.
@Talkmaster @peterdaou I talk to the craziest republicans I can find, they actually expect people to defer to the Christian influenced abstinence idea. That attempts to dictate morality in a “secular” government. How many women would lose decent partners by waiting around forever, oh Neal doesn’t know.
@Talkmaster @peterdaou Hey Neal, the Rs wants to be in my bedroom is that not controlling? They want me to entirely alter the way our dating culture works and be abstinent. Socialism doesn’t attempt to persuade me into children I can’t take care of, or a marriage that I can’t handle.

@beasterly423 @VoteMarsha Vote Marsha to #RepeatHistory and #LeadRight into another Opium War. You’re doomed to repeat history if you don’t even know it, and @VoteMarsha only knows “home economics”. Look it up for yourself #DefyHistory
@joy_bat @Gunzilla714 @VoteMarsha @joniernst @NSAIofficial @destefanomusic Bot?
@kk_nguyen @VoteMarsha @joniernst @NSAIofficial @destefanomusic How ironic, ours sold us out to pharma and telecom. She’s trying for private prisons too it seems. All we can do is vote and share information.
@VoteMarsha @joniernst @NSAIofficial @destefanomusic Maybe that guy can write a best selling ballad about how Marsha sold her state out to telecom and opioid interests.
@Anti_SS_69 @rolandscahill @DelizDear I can think of a jacket for people that are into that kind of thing😂
@JoePGuerrero Seriously though, you do really good work. People on the other side are truly oblivious to a lot of the issues you cover. Don’t forget it. I love this piece on the halfway houses for men I’m watching rn!
@PhilBredesen Mmmmmm fixed interest rates🤤
@PhilBredesen Good public schools make good college students. I really think the vocation route should be looked into for working adults who want to learn a skilled craft. Of course which vocations succeed would be dependent on the economy, so it should be practical.
@AmThruster @PhilBredesen Betsy Devos wants to roll back title 9. This would be chaos, surely there are more practical places to start
@MismeasureOfEd @PhilBredesen https://t.co/5MQn6Rakth
@jimstev03759375 @bikiniatolband @foggybottomgal @PhilBredesen This guy hasn’t heard about the inflated cost of higher ed. You used to be able to work through college. You can work during college now and still accumulate debt if you support yourself and have scholarships. I’d be hard pressed to do school full time and make several k in 4 mo.

@allen__town @CountyAge @VoteMarsha Lol you hit the nail on the head for my half of family.  I think these kids need to see what is out here before they pledge their allowance money to Marsha. That being said, I feel like most people in the circles would throw money at a problem rather than seeking a solution.

@gdavis92 @MarshaBlackburn Agreed!
@Gilgamark @MarshaBlackburn More like talks out of the opposite end of her body😛
@MarshaBlackburn Well I can believe money isn’t speech, that doesn’t make it true or make a shred of difference🤗
@MarshaBlackburn @ICEgov @CBP She just wants to put a private detention facility here. I don’t want that, do you? What does Home Econ know about the flow of drugs? Probably just the fox talking points, as per the rest of her campaign.
@GOPChairwoman Well Michigan cannibalized their public schools, so it probably won’t be getting easier anytime soon😯
@Prolifeldy @TN4Marsha @VoteMarsha It’s really not that simple though.
@TN4Marsha @VoteMarsha A lot of women turn to prostitution and sex work to support their opioid addictions. It didn’t have to be this bad.
@DistractedChem @MarshaBlackburn Those places are an infestation, so there’s no wonder it’s linked to her. If I were more important, #ThinSkinnedMarshad might have cried on Fox about my comments too lol.
@MarshaBlackburn Oh wow😱 Rich people getting richer and poor people getting poorer. Remember when they were trying to push that “defy history” line while not knowing basic world history, like the Opium War?
@1025TheGame @VoteMarsha @MarshaBlackburn Can YALL ask her about the pill AND private prison money?
@Tagg1957 @VoteMarsha @comcast @CoreCivic If you looked at her families page, youd see they didn’t want her used as a statistic. Not that you respect that.
@DawnBar1976 @VoteMarsha @comcast @CoreCivic In case you missed it👌
@DawnBar1976 @VoteMarsha @comcast @CoreCivic Do you think God gives the government authority? Because he doesn’t, we do. But I guess God could send us all to hell for having any part in this, that means you too Dawn. How much will you cheer for these Crimes Against Humanity that your candidate has been totally complicit in?
@realbamamark @VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress Here I am! https://t.co/jeUMytR1mE
@VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress How do we compensate for NCLB losses in funding without a state income tax? I have always wondered this.
@VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress He shouldn’t be telling us how to reform education. He doesn’t know.
@allen__town @VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress Al Gore is a total fox. I watched this the other day and almost did a spit-take😂😂😂
@VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress I know cause I went there too.
@VoteMarsha @BillHaslam @TimesFreePress He went to a private school that costs 15k a year to attend.
@VoteMarsha @comcast @CoreCivic Still waiting for an answer from @CoreCivic as to *why* they want to donate money to you, but this seems to be pretty clear. Do you want detention centers on our soil or private prisons, because we’ve done just fine this far without them.
@VoteMarsha She just wants to smoke them out. Why don’t you pick on someone your own size @VoteMarsha like @Comcast or @CoreCivic . I think that would help us more than overprosecuting people that are already incredible vulnerable, are these the Christian Values you tout?

@feathersong @PhilBredesen And he looked me straight in the eyes while he shook my hand, you’d be surprised how uncomfortable eye contact makes some people (even lawyers). Not him. He’s got a firm handshake and he asked my name. I feel like he wants this job for the right reasons and I’m telling my friends

@TNGOP @DailyCaller Boo hoo, so what?
@LamarAlexander @VoteMarsha And of course it’s a civil war site, panderer.
@Buffallavender @JimmyNashville1 @LamarAlexander @VoteMarsha I seem to remember Lamar Alexander complaining about fishing regulations in certain rivers. It’s likely because they are contaminated by ag run off or chem dumping. But Marsha wouldn’t know about that, would she?
@Dsntslp @taylorgrayson @TNGOP I haven’t heard anything about him commenting on open borders.
@TNGOP Marsha doesn’t understand basic world history, like the opium wars.
@TNGOP So what?
@CherylF19665664 @TN4Marsha @VoteMarsha Blackburn for bedazzled bags. As per her home economics degree.
@TN4Marsha @VoteMarsha I don’t think y’all understand sex trafficking. For people that are forced it is a win, but the prostitutes that continue to operate will be offline and subject to more violence and pimps. Is that really better? Who was saved? Noone is thrilled about hookers, but this laws empty.
@ICEgov @DHSgov But pat yourselves on the backs some more👍

@xir_xe @Silverngold17 @VoteMarsha I understand that, and I respect it. I just see a lot of potential for bipartisan work that we are ignoring, and rings with the sentiment in HIS platform.
@xir_xe @Silverngold17 @VoteMarsha I think he has nuanced enough views to not be a total base vote every time. Honestly I think he would be as “fair” as one would ever consider another on the other side. I don’t especially want to hurt republicans, we are usually red, but this lady is just grossly unqualified.
@Buffallavender @VoteMarsha I’ve never been WWE level of hyped over a senate election 🤣🤣😰
@LoriKolish @VoteMarsha Personal responsibility isn’t 500$ to stop an ear infection.

@WeNeedCoolidge @VoteMarsha Private prison campaign donations, good or bad?
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman Any actual journalists?
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman He did it in public. Turns out our national security isn’t a joke. I don’t have the worst evidence yet but i know that they offered to pay Omarosa as much for her silence out of tax payer money as the CIA director made in a year 180k.
@realbamamark @joy_bat @VoteMarsha Shouldn’t you be considering why Marsha should get this job. I haven’t gotten any substantial answer yet. It’s not for anything SHE has done as a person, so why do you like her?
@realbamamark @VoteMarsha Hell no.
@Silverngold17 @VoteMarsha She took 20k from a private prison Corporation, named CoreCivic . Sounds like a screw to me...
@VoteMarsha T was 14 when p, a ~35yo man got her hooked on opioids and pregnant twice. They lost both the kids. It didn’t have to be this bad, do you think these campaign contributions from opioid producers helped or hurt?
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman Did Alex jones tell you that?
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman And the president conspired with Russia to defraud the US govt and tax payer. “They let you do it when you’re famous, you know...”👌
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman Supporting the president doing exactly the same thing.
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman And stop feeling so persecuted. No one is coming after YOU.
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman Like the president going after private citizens with security clearances while not holding himself to nearly that high a standard? Hmm🤔🤔🤔
@usernam96614015 @GOPChairwoman Like fox?

@TNGOP The only extremist thing about this is y’all saying this. Also a detail you might have missed, that billionaire guy spent that money on several candidates not all of it to Bredesen. You have an answer for Marsha’s 600k from Comcast, 20k from CoreCivic and much more from opioids?

@maggie_louisa @VoteMarsha @MarshaBlackburn If you know that Marsha took all that opioid money, it seems complicit imo.
@maggie_louisa @VoteMarsha @MarshaBlackburn T was 14 when she started running around with P. He was in his late 30’s. He got her addicted to pills and impregnated her twice as a minor. One time she left her toddler in our basement without telling us. kids are gone, the father is gone, and her life was ruined as it began
@CarlTomasetti @VoteMarsha Hope your kids don’t go to public school...
@VoteMarsha Also didn’t have to do any of that, I bet you had a nanny.
@SusanHershSmith @VoteMarsha Private prison money.
@PogMoThoinTrump @VoteMarsha Sh probably can’t hook up a printer. God, I would love to see that.
