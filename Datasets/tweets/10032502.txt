If you or a love one is suffering from an #opioid addiction, schedule an apt. today: https://t.co/WvKCkHoM5h or (800) 422-1183. #BeRxSafe
If you do need an #opioid prescrpition, here are tips for what you need to know before starting these potent medications: https://t.co/iE6cTmg1UX
The concern about #opioids doesn't mean we want people to be in pain. The goal is to alleviate pain as best we can while using the tools that are most effective for that type of pain. We want to make sure that the treatments we provide don‚Äôt end up harming our patients. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/1OzHs1pTPt
A5) #Opioids can be deadly and children don‚Äôt often know that. Opioids should be stored some place where children can not get them. Education should also be done within the household so everybody knows the danger of these medications. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/QUGXf1n9uE
Loving this resource to help you get rid of your meds so they stay out of our lakes and rivers! https://t.co/wKgY142B7u
A4) It's important for front line responders to have #narcan, which can reverse the effects of an overdose. Many police departments have it as do ambulances.  As it has become more common for law enforcement agencies to have narcan, we‚Äôve noticed a decrease in deaths. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/0Plx3DfGG9
A4) At Henry Ford and hospitals across the US we‚Äôve made great headway in how we look at acute #pain. We now ask the question, does a patient need #opioids? In past decades we used to think that people needed longer prescriptions and more refills than we know they need now. https://t.co/0Plx3DfGG9
Totally agree, Juliette! We're thankful for the @US_FDA's involvement. https://t.co/d10SO5wHgH
A3) We're also educating patients on how to should store and dispose of these medicines so that they aren't diverted to a child inadvertently. Many people never get rid of their #opioids and this is something we are working to change. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
A3) At Henry Ford we have given our healthcare providers a number of tools to use. We also use an #opioid risk tool. It helps the patient, family and healthcare providers understand who is statistically at risk for developing a dependence. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
A3) There are now very firm national guidelines that any healthcare provider in the US should be able to follow. Strategies for acute pain, strategies for chronic pain. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
A3) The #opioid epidemic has led to reeducating all healthcare providers as well as patients and their families to understand what is appropriate and what‚Äôs not. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
A3) We also want, throughout the course of using opioids in chronic pain, to always monitor for misuse, abuse or dependence because anyone is at risk of this. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
A3) When we prescribe #opioids at Henry Ford and most places across the country, we have a written contract with the patient. This includes how much you get, what you cannot take with it, how often you need to see the doctor, etc. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/eDHoyVK73C
@RobRaible Hi Rob, there are multiple types of #opioid medications that can be prescribed, but what we referenced above, in a simplistic way, is that there are two major populations that tend to use prescribed opioids; those with acute pain and those with chronic pain.
A2) There are 2 groups of people that we prescribe #opioids for. 1) Those with acute pain ‚Äì I need medication for a short period of time, appropriately. 2) Those with chronic, non-cancerous pain, where opioids may be appropriate for short or longer term use. #BeRXSafe https://t.co/CBeHK9IBqX
A2) 2 very important things regarding the death rate is that we don‚Äôt have enough access for pain management &amp; we don‚Äôt have enough access for substance abuse treatment. Also, there‚Äôs a stigma with asking for help.  Sadly, these factors lead to why we're struggling. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/CBeHK9IBqX
A2) Contributing to the increasing number of #opioid deaths, are people who turn to the streets for heroin as an alternative to prescription opioids. That puts them at even greater risk with all the diseases that can come from using heroin.#BeRxSafe https://t.co/CBeHK9IBqX
#OpioidAddiction is an illness that is affecting everyone, from higher socio-economic groups, to lower, all genders and ethnicities. Anyone can be affected. We see it happening and beginning in children as young as 12 years of age. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/BubPTVZwIK
In years past we thought of #opioid addicts as being a heroin user and now it‚Äôs become prescription drugs that are claiming lives by the thousands. We now know they can be very unsafe, not only leading to death but dependence, addiction and more health problems. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/BubPTVZwIK
Largely because the number of #opioid deaths are unprecedented. If you look at the US, roughly between 100 and 115 people die each day from opioids, -- be that prescription drugs or heroin. The dramatic death rate makes us obviously concerned. #BeRxSafe https://t.co/BubPTVZwIK
