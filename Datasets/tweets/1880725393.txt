#OilMoneyMitch is a coward. Instead of meeting us in his DC office to face young Kentuckians fighting for a livable future he tried to discredit us with a grossly misinformed Op-ed. Read the young Kentuckians' entire response here https://t.co/cYjPsKklsG
"He's ignoring Jenny, 21, who is from a working-class black &amp; brown neighborhood that suffers from pollution &amp; frequent flooding. He's ignoring Lily, 15, who grew up in Eastern KY and witnessed families in her community fall deeper &amp; deeper into poverty as coal jobs disappeared."
"By refusing to meet with us, McConnell is ignoring the stories of Kentuckians who support the #GreenNewDeal, claiming in an effort to defend his actions that these demands come from outside our state." - young Kentuckians with @sunrisemvmtlou https://t.co/cYjPsKklsG

"I think that would have been a big statement that the new generation is being heard. Instead it was a missed opportunity.‚Äù -Rep. @RoKhanna 		https://t.co/OmxQBBn3i7
@hscotthiggins @USRepKCastor $50,000
"It sounds hyperbolic, but life as we know it is at stake. We need politicians to stand up to the fossil-fuel billionaires who bankroll Congress and rally behind a #GreenNewDeal now." @VarshPrakash via @TeenVogue
"What we‚Äôre talking about is survival...a fight for our existence. A #GreenNewDeal is not only sound climate policy, it‚Äôs a socioeconomic project to rival some of the greatest initiatives in the history of this country and the world." - @VarshPrakash https://t.co/eYESnWp5Jw
A new report found that @USRepKCastor has up to $100,000 invested in oil, gas, and coal utility companies. 		It‚Äôs morally unfathomable for our leaders to be invested in the companies that are responsible for destroying our planet and its people.		https://t.co/nIRRXv1WpI

We don't yet know what the Select Committee's mandate will be. If what we're hearing is true, Dem leaders are pushing a Cte that:		‚ùå Has no subpoena power	‚ùå Allows electeds taking Big Oil $$	‚ùå Won't create a plan for a science-mandated, economic mobilization to stop the crisis https://t.co/dg2NcnQ5X8

@amywestervelt You can read our twitter thread here https://t.co/0ye7ePTIoS
Refusing to embrace the substance of the proposal for a Select Committee on a #GreenNewDeal would be a dereliction of duty from   @NancyPelosi + Democratic leadership, and a sure-fire way to lose the votes and energy from the supermajority of Americans who back a Green New Deal.
By developing a plan for a #GreenNewDeal, we have an opportunity to create millions of good jobs, virtually eliminate poverty in the United States, and invest in the communities that have been left behind by racism and corporate greed.
Our position, however, remains clear: Any Select Committee on Climate Change will be inadequate without a direct mandate to develop a Green New Deal -- a plan to confront the climate crisis at the scale that science and justice tell us is necessary.
This is far from the leadership that this moment calls for.
...then this committee will be even weaker than the one from a decade ago.
If what we hear is true, that Democratic leaders are pushing for a Select Committee on Climate Change that has no subpoena power, lacks a mandate to confront the climate crisis in line with what the science demands, and will be peppered with fossil fuel-funded politicians...
We still have not heard from @NancyPelosi what the mandate of the "Select Committee on the Climate Crisis" will be. https://t.co/UfbcF3yOob

We've heard nice words and platitudes our whole lives, and we've seen more and more people die each year.		If you want to be taken seriously by our generation, you need to commit to real action on the timeline demanded by science and justice.
We're also glad to hear that you think there are some "fabulous proposals" in the Green New Deal. 		So, will you commit to fighting for 100% renewable energy by 2030, a jobs guarantee, and support for communities ravaged by climate change like the Green New Deal calls for?
Politicians being funded by fossil fuel CEOs cannot be trusted to make climate policy.		If you want the Select Committee to be taken seriously, everyone on it needs to sign the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge.
.@USRepKCastor: you said you hope Select Committee members are "ready to take on corporate polluters and special interests."		Then why refuse to mandate that they sign the #NoFossilFuelMoney pledge?		Reps taking millions from oil and gas CEOs aren't gonna take on their donors.

Failing to advocate for the solutions on the scale we need to give our generation a livable future shows a deep lack of moral clarity and courage from our Democratic leadership.

We build that world both through changing laws and policies, and through the actions we take and the ways that we treat each other each and every day. 6/6
We can build a world where all people are valued, regardless of the color of our skin, our gender, or how much money we have in our pockets. We can build a world where we care for one another and the earth. 5/6
One of our principles as Sunrise is ‚ÄúWe stand with other movements for change‚Äù. We have been inspired and moved by the #MeToo campaign and many others like it that work to make our world safer and healthier for all people. 4/6
The same worldview that teaches men that they can dominate, control, and abuse women without consequence teaches us that we can dominate, control, and abuse our environment. We cannot stand for it in a world where our fates are so linked. 3/6
We want to be absolutely clear. While the AG has stood for values that we believe in before, his behavior is absolutely unacceptable and follows a disturbing pattern of powerful, wealthy, often white men taking advantage of and hurting women. 2/6
On several occasions, Sunrise has expressed enthusiasm towards NY AG Schneiderman for his leadership as a climate advocate. So we felt the need to speak out about the unfolding accusations of abuse by four women against Schneiderman. 1/6
