According to @electproject, 36.2m people voted early, or by absentee so far. That's 132% of the 2014 early/absentee turnout. (2/10)
Some takeaways from early voting: Turnout is up. Not a little, a lot. Younger voters AND older voters. Whites AND non-whites. Dems AND Repubs. (Though groups that favor Dems are up by higher percentages, generally speaking) (1/10)
