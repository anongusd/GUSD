@JBEACHAM13 @BreitbartNews Again, incorrect. There absolutely are limits on how many and which type of relatives a legal immigrant can sponsor. One simply can‚Äôt sponsor a third cousin, etc. Also, in order to sponsor, they must prove that they can financially provide for their relative. No tax burden.
@JBEACHAM13 @BreitbartNews That is not correct. Illegal immigrants are not eligible to sponsor family members, and explicit caps are set on which relatives, and how many per year can enter our country.
@BreitbartNews Chain migration refers to legal, not illegal, immigration. Nobody here seems to understand that...
