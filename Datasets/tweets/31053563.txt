The shutdown is over. President Trump has signed the spending bill that passed today, the White House says. https://t.co/mcVfPSkdUf
We're tracking the Senate vote, now underway, that would clear the way for passage of a bill to end the shutdown: https://t.co/IJQJ4ev55f
The shutdown may soon be over. "We're going to vote to reopen the government," Sen. Mark Warner tells reporters.
On the Senate floor, McConnell says he still intends to move ahead with a procedural vote at noon on funding the government through Feb. 8.
McConnell's office sent out remarks containing a bit more detail on immigration than what he said on the floor tonight https://t.co/IUQCVhRGWv
No deal tonight on ending the government shutdown. The Senate had adjourned until 10 a.m. Monday.
The shutdown will enter Day 3. McConnell delays a procedural vote on a stopgap bill to 12 p.m. Monday, instead of 1 a.m.
CORNYN says right now, he thinks the government will still be shut down tomorrow.
Kaine on what Democrats are seeking: "We want to see a commitment to take up immigration, with a belief that we’ll get to a good result for Dreamers."
Shutdown update: The Senate has adjourned until 1 p.m. Sunday.
No more votes in the House tonight, Scalise's office says, but members are told to remain in DC. House convenes at 2 p.m. tomorrow.
Schumer on the Senate floor, 12 hours into the shutdown: "Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with jello."
Is it the Trump shutdown or the Schumer shutdown? The blame game is underway. Our story: https://t.co/58hVmOtl7x
McConnell says the Senate will convene at noon on Saturday.
McConnell says he'll propose changing the expiration date of the stopgap bill to Feb. 8, from Feb. 16. But the vote won't happen tonight, he says.
It's official: The House is done for the night. It will reconvene at 9 a.m. Saturday morning, per Scalise's office.
Schumer: "The blame should crash entirely on President Trump's shoulders. This will be called the Trump shutdown."
"What has their filibuster accomplished?" McConnell asks, referring to Senate Democrats. "The answer's simple: their very own government shutdown."
McConnell is speaking now on the Senate floor. "The government shutdown was 100 percent avoidable," he says.
Five Democrats have voted in favor of ending debate: Donnelly, Heitkamp, Jones, Manchin and McCaskill.		Four Republicans have voted no: Flake, Graham, Lee and Paul.
We're tracking the Senate vote to cut off debate on the bill to avert a government shutdown. Follow along: https://t.co/7N1PcaAhPX
After a moment, Kennedy adds: "Love is the answer, but I still own a handgun. Just in case."
Sen. John Kennedy, as a shutdown looms: "All I know is that love is the answer. But there doesn't seem to be much around here right now."
"No deal," Cornyn tells reporters. He says the Senate still intends to vote on the monthlong stopgap bill.
@ByronTau Update: We are not proud of this, but we resorted to the Senate carry-out.
Possible shutdown compromise: Sen. Lindsey Graham floats a three-week stopgap spending bill, expiring Feb. 8.
House majority whip's office asks lawmakers to "remain in town and flexible." But no "imminent votes" expected in that chamber.
McConnell schedules 10 p.m. cloture vote on the House-passed stopgap bill. As of now, at least, the vote seems likely to fail.
Shutdown update: Sen. Leahy, the top Democratic appropriator, says there could be a vote around 10 tonight. "But I'm not sure what it's going to be," he says.
Latest update from the House majority whip's office: "Members are advised to remain in town and available for possible additional procedural votes."
SCHUMER after returning from the White House: "We made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements. The discussions will continue."
Perdue says he isn't worried about the Trump-Schumer meeting: "The president's a big boy. He can take care of himself."
Cornyn is asked if he's worried that it's only Schumer meeting with Trump. "The thought did cross my mind," he says.
