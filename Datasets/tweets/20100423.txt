In the meantime, Maryland taxpayers deserve full transparency and the Governor should make public all properties in which the Hogan Companies has a financial interest. #MDgov #MDpolitics 4/4
It’s time for Governor Hogan to divest from his companies so Marylanders can be certain that Hogan is working for them, instead of putting millions into his bank account. #MDgov #MDpolitics 3/4

DREAMers in Maryland currently contribute more than $40 million annually in state and local taxes. Simply put, Republicans’ failure to protect DREAMers will have a cost on Maryland’s economy. We need to #protectDREAMers now. #MDgov #MDpolitics 3/3 https://t.co/1WSm71c1uF
By contrast, Maryland’s GDP would increase by more than $1.6 billion if half of the state’s DACA-eligible residents completed their education requirements – completing an associate degree or two years of a bachelor’s degree – for legal permanent status. #MDgov #MDpolitics 2/3
Let’s look at the facts about DREAMers in Maryland. Ending DACA will cost Maryland more than $500 million in lost economic output annually. 	#MDGov #MDpolitics #ProtectDREAMers 1/3 https://t.co/UujO2HIaJC
Here are the facts on how failing to protect DREAMers will harm Maryland. @LarryHogan , we urge you to speak out. #MDGov #MDpolitics 3/3 https://t.co/BiOlNh0NeZ
.@LarryHogan should use his bully pulpit to urge @realDonaldTrump to support bipartisan efforts to protect DREAMers and the Maryland economy, but unfortunately he's afraid to even mention Trump by name. #MDGov #MDpolitics 2/3
While 8 out of 10 Marylanders want to #ProtectDREAMers , @LarryHogan is once again hiding from the fights that matter. If @realDonaldTrump successfully blocks efforts to give DREAMers a path to legal status, it'll rip hundreds of millions of dollars from Maryland’s economy.  1/3
Just this week, @realDonaldTrump said he "would love to see a shutdown," but @LarryHogan can't even muster the political courage to mention him by name. Sad! #MDpolitics #MDgov https://t.co/dUim84jqMQ

Maryland employers will say $132M annually due to reduced turnover when we give workers access to #earnedsickdays https://t.co/N7AEP9vCRD
As the @MDSenate Dems prepare to override @LarryHogan veto to give 700,000 Marylanders access to #EarnedSickDays, let's set the record straight on Hogan and his allies' fiction about #HB1.
We launched a digital campaign to call attention to @LarryHogan's heartless dismissal of 1,300 lost jobs.  Marylanders can now see for themselves that Hogan is an out-of-touch politician who thinks that losing a job doesn’t matter. #MDpolitics #MDgov	https://t.co/aOrrCeevXN
