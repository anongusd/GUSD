Chappy, Ivana Trump later said, "had an equal dislike of Donald."
Trump lived with a poodle, Chappy, with his first wife, Ivana, who wrote in her memoir, "Donald was not a dog fan." "When I told him I was bringing Chappy with me to NY, he said, 'No,'" she wrote. "'It's me and Chappy or no one!' I insisted, and that was that."
People have asked and told him it's "good politically" to have a dog, but "that‚Äôs not the relationship I have with my people." 	The Trumps have broke with tradition in not having a pet.
The notoriously pet-averse President talked about getting a dog at his El Paso rally tonight. "I wouldn‚Äôt mind having one... How would I look walking a dog on the White House lawn sort of not ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt feel good, feels a little phony to me," Trump said.
He said he had a choice between staying backstage to hear more about the deal or coming out to speak. ‚ÄúI chose you,‚Äù Trump told the crowd. He added, "So we probably have some good news, but who knows?"
Trump reacts to a possible Congressional deal: "They say that progress is being made. Just so you know. Just now just now," he said. "I said wait a minute, I gotta take care of my people from Texas, I got to go, I don‚Äôt even want to hear about it, I don‚Äôt want to hear about it."

And accd to the El Paso Times, from 2006-11, violent crime in El Paso increased by 17%. The city did, however, see a decline in violent crimes around the start of Operation Hold the Line, which stationed hundreds of Border Patrol agents alongside the border surrounding El Paso.
But accd to an analysis of FBI crimes data and city law enforcement data analyzed by the El Paso Times, violent crime in El Paso peaked in 1993. Border fence construction didn't begin until 2008, and was completed in 2009. Violent crime fell 34% between 1993 and 2006 in the city.
Trump, during the SOTU, claimed "the border city of El Paso, TX, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime, 1 of the highest in the country, &amp; considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. Now, w/ a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is 1 of our safest cities.‚Äù
The President will attend a campaign fundraiser this evening ahead of his rally here at the El Paso County Coliseum. For $15,000, supporters will be able to participate in a photo opportunity. There are no plans for him to visit to the border, which is blocks away, at this time.
Trump is expected to stick to a similar structure and themes of previous rally speeches with an emphasis on border security and immigration during his Texas remarks. Senators @tedcruz and @JohnCornyn are also expected to speak.

The fund will start with an initial $50 million from USAID, Ivanka said, noting that ‚Äúit will continue to be prioritized in upcoming and future budgets.‚Äù The goal of WGEP is to empower 50 million women in developing countries by 2025, with annual reports from USAID.
Trump said she has spent the last two years meeting with ‚Äúmore than 200‚Äù partners, NGOs, private sector companies, government officials.

Trump:"It‚Äôll all work out. What we need is we need a strong border. We have criminals coming in, we have human traffickers coming in, we have drugs pouring in, we have things happening that you don‚Äôt even want to know about +it‚Äôs been that for decades + we can‚Äôt have it any more"
Trump said in the Rose Garden on Friday that he thinks federal workers' landlords would be lenient on late rent payment. I asked him today about other expenses -- childcare and other bills that are piling up. "Well, we're looking at everything," he said.
He said he didn't know if federal workers were Democrats or not (as he tweeted yesterday): "Probably in this case a lot of them are Democrats, we have a lot of Republicans too but regardless, that‚Äôs the way it is. Those people are great Americans, great patriots."
Pressed on what would need to happen for him to declare a ntl emergency, he said, "We‚Äôll be letting you know fairly soon.‚Äù How would it get paid for? ‚ÄúWell we have a lot of different ways, I‚Äôm not going to get into that. I‚Äôm just saying we are looking at it very strongly."
He continued to suggest he'd declare a ntl emergency on border, but gave little detail. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at a ntl emergency because we have a ntl emergency -- just read the papers...we have an absolute crisis and of criminals and gang members coming through. It is ntl security."
He expressed openness to considering DACA as part of shutdown negotiations, but said he would let SCOTUS rule on legality of program first: ‚ÄúI would consider DACA but I think it would be complicated. I‚Äôd rather have the Supreme Court rule and then work with the Democrats on DACA"
Upon arrival from Camp David, POTUS said he instructed his shutdown negotiation team ‚Äúto say that we‚Äôll build a steel barrier.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be less obtrusive &amp; it‚Äôll be stronger.‚Äù He suggested Dems ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like concrete so we‚Äôll give them steel,‚Äù which he said is ‚Äúmore expensive.‚Äù https://t.co/jFvemRGtkW

Asked whether the two leaders will meet again w/in the 90day time period to go over more difficult negotiations, Mnuchin said that both Trump/Xi extended invitations to their respective countries. No specific time or date was set, but he expects them to meet "in the near future."
Mnuchin: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking President Xi at his word on his commitment to President Trump, but they have to deliver on this. The President has been clear expects to move forward, but he has reserved ability to do additional tariffs if they‚Äôre not successful,‚Äù he said.
Asked how firm the 90-day deadline is, Mnuchin said, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a specific understanding that we‚Äôre going to turn agreement that the 2 presidents have into a real agreement ovr 90 days. Obv., some issues are going to need to be phased in, some will need more detailed work."
Sec. Steven Mnuchin told WH reporters there is an ‚Äúimmediate focus on reducing auto tariffs‚Äù in China deal, noting that Trump and Xi exchanged specifics on 142 structural items. Asked if there was a specific agreement to eliminate auto tariffs, Mnuchin said, ‚ÄúYes, there was.‚Äù

@klearmix It‚Äôs a thread about an interview with Ivanka Trump. Hope that‚Äôs not unclear!
@KateBennett_DC @WhiteHouse But also that it‚Äôs so cold they could just store the food outside tbh
Trump says she'd ‚Äúnever‚Äù been criticized publicly until entering politics.‚ÄúA lot of the things I was praised for were somehow weaponized against me,‚Äù she said, adding tht she has experienced ‚Äútremendous growth in my own sense of self &amp;seeing more brightly my own compass &amp; signal‚Äù
Trump was asked if she had any regrets. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have regrets, you‚Äôre not introspective. I am rather introspective and I think that every misstep has made me smarter, made me stronger.‚Äù She cited "understanding the nature of a bureaucracy" as a regret.
Trump: "It's been a long time that this has been ongoing, but I want it to be done in a way in which nobody could question that it was hurried or rushed. &amp; I think after this long period of time, we're well beyond that point, so I think it absolutely should reach its conclusion"
On Mueller investigation, Trump said, "I know the facts as they relate to me &amp; my family, &amp;so I have nothing to be concerned about." Her brother, Don Jr., and her husband, Jared Kushner, have been questioned by Mueller's investigators. Her father provided written responses to Qs.
Pressed on this by @DebRobertsABC, Trump clarified, "So lethal force, under any circumstance, would be the last resort. But he is the C-in-C of the armed forces of this country, so he always has to be able to protect the border ... he's not talking about innocent asylum seekers."
But the President told reporters at Mar-a-Lago last week that he's "given the OK" to use lethal force on the border, adding that he "(hopes) they don't have to."
On lethal force at the border, Trump said, "I don't believe that that's what he said, but his primary role as C-in-C is to protect the nation's borders," she said, adding that lethal force "is not, I think, something that anyone's talking about."
Trump on images of the children fleeing tear gas at the San Ysidro border crossing: "I think, like any other person with a heart, it's devastating to see the images and seeing children put at risk. Running towards the border is heartbreaking, there's no other way to process it."

Trump denied the doctored Acosta video was doctored. "All the was ‚Äì somebody manipulated that? Give me a break,‚Äù Trump said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúSee that‚Äôs just dishonest reporting. All that is is a close up,‚Äù he said, "It wasn‚Äôt doctored, they gave a close up view."
Trump said he hasn't made a UN Ambassador decision yet -- ‚ÄúWe are looking at Heather (Nauert), we are looking at numerous people,‚Äù he said, adding that he would make the decision ‚Äúover the next few weeks but by the end of the year."
Has President Trump talked to @ChrisChristie about the attorney general role? 	‚ÄúI like Chris Christie, but I have not talked to him about it."	‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to pick somebody that‚Äôs great,‚Äù he later said of a Sessions replacement.
As CNN reported yesterday, Trump has already begun reviewing with his lawyers the written answers to questions from Mueller.
Trump was asked if he'd sit down with special counselor Robert Mueller. "I haven‚Äôt ruled out anything, I haven‚Äôt even thought about it. I‚Äôm thinking about the world...‚ÄúRight now I‚Äôm thinking about the world, I‚Äôm not thinking about sit downs or not sit downs."

Illegal immigrants, Trump said, ‚Äúwill overwhelm your schools, your hospitals and communities and strain public resources to the breaking point.‚Äù
More Trump on Dems/immigration: ‚ÄúAs we speak, the Democratic Party is openly encouraging millions of illegal aliens to break our laws, violate our borders and bankrupt our country.‚Äù
Speaking about the border wall, Trump teased an announcement but gave no further details, saying, ‚ÄúWait til you see what we‚Äôre doing next week, you‚Äôre not even gonna believe.‚Äù
Trump addressed the caravan during his Charlotte rally: ‚ÄúThe Democrats want to invite caravan after caravan of illegal immigrants into our country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd they want to sign them up for free healthcare, free welfare, and the right to vote.‚Äù
Trump also called on Americans to ‚Äúreplace the politics of destruction with a real debate about issues,‚Äù noting that he wants ‚Äúhonest coverage‚Äù from the media.
Trump also accused the media of ‚Äú(using) sinister action of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party.‚Äù He compared the attacks to the Congressional baseball shooting, noting that no one blamed Bernie Sanders for that attack.
Nearly 20 seconds of chanting later, Trump continued: ‚ÄúAnd they do indeed. They have a major role to play as far as tone and as far as everything.‚Äù
While discussing ‚Äútone and civility‚Äù of national dialogue, Trump urged unity and an ‚Äúend to the politics of personal destruction.‚Äù The media, he told the Charlotte crowd, ‚Äúhas a major role to play whether they want to or not,‚Äù at which point boos and ‚ÄúCNN sucks‚Äù chant broke out.

just a couple examples: "In America, we don‚Äôt worship government, we worship God." Americans "proudly stand for our nation and our American flag." Democrats "want to replace Texas values with Nancy Pelosi values and they want to replace the rule of law with the rule of the mob."
Trump is staying on message in Houston, drawing many contrasts with Democrats, and largely sticking to script: "In this election, you can send a message to the radical Democrats: don‚Äôt mess with Texas. Vote for Ted Cruz and vote Republican."
Sen. Cruz tells the Houston crowd he is "honored" to have President Trump's endorsement in his race for Texas Senate and says he "(looks) forward to endorsing" and campaigning with him for his presidential re-election campaign in 2020

Trump echoed his sentiment from last night in Montana, casting the Republican party as a party of law and order, as contrasted with the Democrats: ‚ÄúWe are about law and order and borders and jobs and they are about allowing crime to enter our country with open borders.‚Äù
MORE Trump: "There‚Äôs a lot of information... People are saying there‚Äôs a lot of money being passed around so that this would normally hit just before election. But I happen to think it‚Äôs a great issue for the Republicans, this is a great Republican issue."
President Donald Trump repeated on Friday his allegation, without evidence, that Democrats are responsible for the caravans of immigrants attempting to cross the border: ‚ÄúA lot of people have gathered and a lot of people are looking at Democrats, why did they gather?" (CONT.)
Trump says it's "too early to say" what the consequences will be for the death of Khashoggi. "It's something that we don‚Äôt like, very serious stuff and we‚Äôre going to get to the bottom of it," he said, adding that he wants Congress to be very "involved in determining what to do."
Trump continued, "That was a tremendous success last night in Montana and Greg is a tremendous person and he‚Äôs a tough cookie but I‚Äôll stay with that. you‚Äôre talking about a different world."
Trump, asked if he regretted what he said last night about Gianforte assaulting a reporter: "No, no no not at all. That was a different world. That was a different league, a different world, just a great guy, and he‚Äôs a ‚Äì you know Greg very well, right?"

Trump on FLOTUS plane scare: "She was cool...I asked how was she, was she scared? No sir. What was she like? She was so cool, we couldn‚Äôt believe it, evrybody else had cloth on their face, &amp;I probably would have also. Cloth that was water, right wet on their face, she sat there.‚Äù
Trump invoked Gianforte a second time: ‚ÄúHow about sleepy Joe Biden? Sleepy Joe. Remember he challenged me to a fight and that was fine. And when I said he wouldn‚Äôt last long, he‚Äôd be down faster than Greg would take him down, he‚Äôd be down so fast, remember? Faster than Greg."

.@FLOTUS was asked about funding to @USAID: ‚ÄúWell they‚Äôre looking into it. The USAID is helping the countries for self-reliance and it will take a long time. We still need to help them but we will see... I will give him (POTUS) my feedback. What I saw and what I learned."
.@FLOTUS was asked about @RudyGiuliani assertion that she believes her husband and knows that the Stormy Daniels‚Äô affair and payment was ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù	Trump said, ‚ÄúI never talk to Mr. Giuliani.‚Äù	 Why would he speak on her behalf and say that?	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. You need to ask him."
She continued, ‚ÄúI want to show them that I don‚Äôt care. You could criticize whatever you want to say but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right.‚Äù	Why did she put it back on after border visit?	‚ÄúAfter the visit I put it back on bc I see how the media got obsessed by it."
Who was jacket for? ‚ÄúI often asking myself I would not wear that if I would have so much media coverage. It‚Äôs obvious I didn‚Äôt wear the jacket for the children. I wore the jacket to go on the plane &amp; off...&amp; it was for the people &amp; for the left wing media who are criticizing me."
.@FLOTUS said her ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt care, do u?‚Äù jacket was in fact intended to send a message, even though her spokeswoman said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a jacket‚Äù at the time. ‚ÄúIt was kind of a message, yes. I would prefer that they focus on what I do and my initiatives than what I wear."
Her message to parents who are still separated from their children? ‚ÄúI would tell them to keep strong and that time will come. Everything needs to go through the court system.‚Äù
Asked if she disagreed with the administration‚Äôs zero tolerance policy, FLOTUS said, ‚ÄúYes and I let him know. I didn‚Äôt know that that policy would come out. I was blindsided by it. I told him at home and I said to him that I feel that‚Äôs unacceptable and he felt the same.‚Äù
.@FLOTUS told @ABC she was "blindsided" by admin's family separation policies. ‚ÄúIt was unacceptable for me to see children and parents separated. It was heartbreaking. And I reacted with my own voice.‚Äù
Did the President tell her not to take up cyberbullying? ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt say not to do it. He understands that he‚Äôs very tough on twitter. But he understands that I want to help next generation and the children.‚Äù
FLOTUS asked by ABC abt irony of tackling cyberbullying as part of her platform: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree always what he posts, but his action is his action and I tell him that. I know I will be hit with criticism to talking about cyberbullying but it will not stop me to do what is right."
Trump spoke for 67 mins in OH. Didn't mention missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi but took multiple pointed jabs at the press: "One little mistake and they try to destroy your entire career...Srsly, look at the magnitude of it. Look at the number of media back there. Fake news."

Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic party, Trump said, adding, "A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic party."
Trump: "A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a jurist with a sterling record of public service."
He touted the "quality and courage" of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, tying a vote for the Supreme Court nominee to combatting the Democratic party's tactics.

Fifth, Kavanaugh says: "Judging is real people in the real world and every decision we make, no matter how high minded it might sound affects real people in the real world with real interests."
Number four, Kavanaugh says, human qualities -- "I'm joining a team of nine... and that means something... I don't make decisions by myself." Collegiality and civility are important, he says.
Third, "Paying attention to the laws that are written... respect for the words put into the Constitution itself."
Number two, he says, is "respect for precedent," which he said is "rooted in the Constitution itself."
Kavanaugh says the first quality of a good judge is "independence," "not being swayed by political or public pressure... That takes some backbone."
Day two of Kavanaugh hearings and protesters are already being escorted out less than two minutes in. Grassley leans in to ranking member Feinstein - overheard saying, "Your advice was to wait..."

Trump is ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù on paid family leave legislation, but, ‚ÄúIt will take time.‚Äù She namechecked Sens. Fischer and Rubio, among others, and said she has worked to make paid family leave a GOP-friendly policy over the last yr. But, she said, ‚ÄúNot in this Congress.‚Äù
She touted 3.8 million new private sector commitments in workforce development, which builds on last week‚Äôs announcement and event. New today were commitments from Mastercard (75,000 commitments) and United Airlines.
Trump said she will ‚Äúlikely‚Äù return to the private sector ‚Äúbut I don‚Äôt have a timetable.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt feel like it was fair to her team at her brand to maintain that she would be going back to the business. She pointed to ‚Äúimportant legislation‚Äù she‚Äôs working on moving forward.
Trump said a high point for her during her time in the White House was Alice Marie Johnson: ‚ÄúSeeing her leave prison and run into the arms of her family... I was crying, it was one of the most beautiful things... and it reminds you of the real impact you have on people.‚Äù
