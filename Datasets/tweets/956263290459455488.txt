@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy No I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôll never just anoint Davis Webb
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Funny how you‚Äôre so retarded you end up using my point
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Lol my first statement was based off of what evidence? Actual coaches liked Jamarcus Russell
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy You said yourself that‚Äôs a throw 5 year veterans make. And I cameback with successful nfl quarterbacks who have either won or went to a sb in first 5 years. You just used a top 10 pick. The goal is the Super Bowl. You need to follow a different sport
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Dramatic comparisons? Yea I‚Äôm equating Davis Webb to top 10 picks. And yea I named successful nfl quarterbacks should I reference career back ups like Davis Webb will be?
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy And yea you said 5 year nfl veteran throw just showing how worthless your opinion is
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy I can compare rookies to them because they were all once you know.... rookies. You are putting Davis Webb in the same category as top 10 picks üòÇ
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Pretty sure they can hit that
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Also guys who went to or won the super bowl in the first 5 years go by the names of Montana elway Marino manning Brady Unitas Rodgers favre rothlisberger bradshaw  Russell Wilson.
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy By comparing them you are. Be dumber
@AlexxxWilsonnn @LicensePlateGuy Did I say Rosen or darnold could complete it? Eli and burress perfected it. You are saying Davis Webb is a top 10 pick hilarious
@LicensePlateGuy He was a good qb at Texas tech.... I can give 5 names off the top of my head with that same title
@LicensePlateGuy What is this based off of? Can he read the Tampa 2? Can he complete a back shoulder on 3rd and 14 on the road in negative degree weather?
