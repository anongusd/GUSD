I remember when one lie would bring you down. That's showing my age.
@EvanHurst Last thing I promise.  I think it is hard to accept positive statements from strangers, such as my self.		A few years ago, a directer said, "If you are going to believe the good things you have to believe the bad."		That same director said "don't believe the press."		NIght Evan.
@EvanHurst I am not kind, sadly.  But I am honest.  And I do not lie.  So there's that.		I want you to keep going.  I wait for your work, like a child excited for a visit from Santa.  It is extraordinary.
I have "Walnuts!" and Nom nom nom, and "Whoa if true?"		In my life because of you.  And so many others.
@EvanHurst I am a writer.  My work has been published many times over the years.		So?  Who gives a rats ass?		I know when someone is not just a good writer, but is creating new ways to write. 		That is you Evan.  One of the best contemporary writers of the day.
@EvanHurst @Wonkette Seriously Evan.  You deserve to know the degree of esteem you are held to.
@Wonkette @RobynElyse Host body.		Back in the early 80's I went to a church.   One of the members got up and offered a prayer that included, "And I thank my mother for giving her life so I could be born."  Back then, it was met with silence.  Today, the same speech would get a retweet from DJT.

@EvanHurst @Wonkette Are you suggesting that it was not fun when we all hated him with the creepy Grrrr pics and all?		Because Evan, I was there.  And you know what? I loved that part of Cohen's life.  		And now.  Look at me. LOOK AT ME. Crying at his testimony and wanting him to win in life.
@OhNoSheTwitnt I am from Utah so I get special rights, okay?		He is known as "snorin orrin."  He begged Streisand to record one of his songs.  He has a very bad neck and it gives him constant pain I am told.  He was against the ERA and thinks Gay people should not live basically.		Fuck Him.
@TheGoodGodAbove @roywoodjr Not sorry I won a tournament.
@Wonkette @EvanHurst Remember when we hated Cohen and Evan wrote stories that made us hate Cohen even more and then we really really hated Cohen with a white hot passion?		Good Times.

@JohnCornyn "Cornyn stated that the U.S. should stand with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi saying: "Saudi Arabia is fighting a proxy war against Iran in Yemen,and an overreaction, in my view, would mean that we cancel arms sales  and simply abandon our ally."
