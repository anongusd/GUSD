@itsdr_dr Not a national emergency...the result of a confluence of bad plumbing and bad law.
@ewarren Is Elizabeth Warren's statement being applied to the accuser of the now-Lt. Governor in Virginia?  It appears even Spartacus is telling the media to sit down and shut up about her.
@briangongol But...Brian...aren't you nitpicking here as well?  I agree it's lazy in news and opinion journalism...but the book on confirmation bias was written about them.
@AOC Sorry, but saying something is doesn't make it so.  We have courts for a reason, so that people can sort out the competing claims and decide what's credible. If you don't like the down-the-middle reporting of an incident, then find another outlet that skews the news to your view.
@JimVanderPutten I read all about the ISC and Oleo.  This has nothing to do with elimination of tenure-it has everything to do with avoiding politics of ANY kind on the college campus.  They should be teaching not opining. And professors should face the possibility of firing-their TA's do!!

@gabrielsherman The only thing is the video doesn't lie.  It shows the kids being harrassed and it's only the "feeling" of a couple of people that you're using to justify their claims.  Read and watch the numerous full videos of the incident and then make up your mind!
@jmike1400 @MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh He IS a 12 year old girl who played attorney and now "plays" at activist.
@siliconred @DavidS_Jr @MarkMccraley @howardcord @of4NByThePeople @davitydave @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi That is required for security of the first family.  The first family and those in line of succession are the only ones entitled to added security.  This junket involved most of the senior Democrats in the House and Pelosi.  She was the only one entitled to it.
@TomSteyer What is it costing the American taxpayer not to have 25 percent of the government shutdown?  THAT is the question you won't answer.  With you it's just "it's all Trump's fault and he needs to be taken out."
@brithume There's never an opportune time to put a stop to certain practices...but Trump's action should be prompting a look at how many times members of Congress use military airplanes for their junkets.  A question...did the Dems fly to Puerto Rico on commercial airlines?
@DavidS_Jr @MarkMccraley @howardcord @of4NByThePeople @davitydave @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Prove it.  Truth is the legislative branch has yet to fully reimburse the cost of a military transport for their junkets.
@davitydave @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi But the legislative branch doesn't have the right to make the Executive branch order taxpayers to pay for it.
@JrbbNyc @RedWolvesWin @RGreen564 @spdustin @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi If it wasn't a PR tour then what was it?
@dcpoll @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi It proves that Trump DOES give a damn...about making sure the government is funded properly and tells Pelosi that she can't use intransigence (remember it's up to HER and Schumer to pass the budget not Trump) as an excuse to go party abroad on the taxpayers.
@NormEisen @soledadobrien Sorry, Norm but that's not correct.  The official explanation is that he WAS selected as a District All-American.  It was still part of the Academic All-American honors so the inference that somehow Matt Whitaker was a dummy is like saying on a resume that you were "Ethics Czar".
@sfhawks55 @newsmanone @IowaHoops Here's the truth about sportscasting:  Those who do the play-by-play can be removed by the team they're covering.  Dolph knew that.  What he didn't know was that there was no commercial break.  Maybe it's time to renegotiate the contract and let others do it?
@swin24 Again, a quote out of context.  The quote is attributed to "a source who was in the room when Trump made this comment during discussions on the debt."  Anonymous quotes are usually made up these days.
@rjfoley This wasn't a "quiet deal" by the governor.  After all, you found out about it.
@DrSprankle @believeandobey3 So what you're saying is that you were wrong and trying to deflect.  "To put someone in this position is and unethical abuse of power at best"...that's the equivalent of a six year old saying "he did it last week" about a sibling when caught lying.
Ain't it the truth...ain't it the truth!! https://t.co/PVVlTUvlez
@MrFilmkritik FAKE NEWS:  Trump spoke with troops Thanksgiving Day in a conference call and Trump mentioned the invasion since election day.  Don't believe me?  Just search for yourself. The old adage that "if you say something enough times it becomes truth" is "Trumped" by the internet.
@dmataconis It may have been the first interracial kiss, but both Kirk and Uhura were forced to do it in that episode by alien beings.  So it really shouldn't count.  CNN says there was a real interracial kiss by two consenting adults earlier:  https://t.co/dZYuuMZnLM
@ezraklein I don't think many people paid attention in American Government class.  There IS a popular vote for EACH member of the House of Representatives.  Noone casts a ballot for a party to have control.  That's determined by the number of Representatives that are elected!
@Brian_Riedl I have a better idea:  Let's just change the Constitution to go Unicameral so we do away with the House. Works for Nebraska...((mostly))
@Amieayyy Besides, gender's fluid nowadays anyway, right?
@lawfareblog @Birch1717 This is a nit-picky article.  Truth is, there should be a judge asking tough questions anytime a court's being asked in secret to wiretap an American involved in a political campaign. A judge should not just sign off on a fishing expedition.
@ChrisCoons @Birch1717 Again we see people using half-truths to support their biases. Truth is it is not PRESIDENT TRUMP who is blocking release of documents. Check w/former Pres. George Bush. Also, docs are available to members of Congress to see. So, nothing to see here after all.
@briangongol The facts (which seem to be ignored) are this:	1. The President only is required by law to lower the flag to half-staff on the DAY that a US Senator dies. It was, Saturday.	2. The President then must issue a proclamation for half-staff for any other days-Done Monday.
@briangongol You are entitled to your opinion,but Trump followed federal law which says the flag must be lowered on the day a US Senator dies. Beyond that is up to the President.  The flag went back to full staff until the White House could draft and Trump could sign an order.
@briangongol The White House returned the flag to half staff after Trump signed a proclamation.
@KILJRadio Please let John Kuhens know that his work has been appreciated and motivated many of use to be better.  He was a competitor when I worked at KCII in Washington and did morning news.  Southeast Iowa will miss him!
Breaking News:  This tweet shows that the Democratic Party owns NBC. Why else would it be revealed other than to amplify a muffled attack? https://t.co/ps27fyPHFh
@shanevanderhart Respectfully disagree.  Most members of Congress and past presidents have avoided the conversation because of perceived "blowback".  Thus nothing was done.  And all of the nations you mentioned have their own tariffs either in name or otherwise.  We need a little shaking up.
tornado
@dmartosko Nah...that would be too easy!
@briangongol Transcript of news conference statement by Trump:  "So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today."  Sounds like Trump restated what he said in Helsinki	((transcript from CNN))
@PeterAlexander @MeetThePress Trump is doing a Bill Clinton...he says he "accepts" but doesn't say he believes them. Kinda like most Americans.  Also, please look at the definition of "interfere". It's not illegal unless they "stand in the way" of an election.  That never took place.
@brithume Not true.  You should know the fix is in.  All of the main media outlets have mischaracterized the President's comments.  He did not agree with Putin or side with him...he said "I don't know which is right" essentially. People need to view the whole news conference!
@Timcast Taking Soboroff's tweet to it's logical conclusion every immigrant would have a bar code or a number on them so they could be scanned like FedEx.
@NiallStanage Niall the problem is it's not the same one-off story. It's almost every national news story these days. It is journalism delegitimizing itself and if you disagree you're against the First Amendment.
@politico ((sorry to day it by Larry Hogan looks like Rick on Pawn Stars))
@adamsmithtimes Not odd...has been a rule in many debates. Keeps the clips out of internet videos and campaign ads. It's become pretty standard media stuff
@Jason ...and there are pages that are dominated by liberals who distort the facts.  And if you try to correct it, you get dinged!!
@briangongol They're IOWANS, that's why!  We're more common sensical.
@RadioFreeTom Really?  Trump got Kim Jung Un to publicly blow up his "nuclear test site" and, before that, to release the Americans being held there...without promising anything! That's better than what we got for the millions that Obama gave Kim.
@DMRevans Agreed.  Nowadays only priests can run for office...oh wait, they have problems too.
@AdamParkhomenko Stay tuned...the word is not from the North Korean leader-it's an unnamed "official" as quoted by the North Korean news service.  I'm betting it's a trial balloon to see if N. Korea can get more out of the US.
@CloeCouture I heard both Yanny and Laurel
@jmike1400 Mike, this was in November of 2017. The link says so.
@shanevanderhart Let's get this straight.  If immigrants are law-abiding they have nothing to fear.  The only fear has been ginned up in favor of some political agendas.
@shanevanderhart Exactly.  It says that communities that refuse to hold immigrants after ICE requests they be held for 48 hours will have to pay the price.  You want to protect all illegal immigrants? Fine, then you fund your government on your own-an extreme way to say it but on most minds
Sen. Taylor just said that overstaying a visa isn't illegal.  It can be.  Please look up "unlawful presence".  It will explain more.
Sen. Matt McCoy says Polk County is honoring ICE detainers:	https://t.co/6144IAvvtR
@brianstelter Sigh...this is the current level of so-called journalism.  So-called "journalists" who quote other so-called journalists who use "unnamed sources."
@brianstelter @brianstelter once again using statements from unnamed sources.  We're tired of this!  It's easy to make things up and credit "unnamed sources" who are "speaking on the condition of anonymity".
@RobertLeonard Robert...it happens to both.  I have gotten death threats and been attacked in public places by liberals.  In fact, more of it happens today from liberals than conservatives.  I used to say if 50% of the public weren't p@#$#$d off at me at any given time I wasn't doing my job!
@briangongol Brian, Brian, Brian...you forget that McCabe was actually fired after the career FBI officials who've been there a long time ruled McCabe should be immediately terminated.  And that's who Trump is supporting.  Doesn't help or hurt Trump-or go to his innocensce or guilt.
@briangongol Got news for ya Brian.  If there's an EMP it won't matter if you have Linux or Windows...plus there are lots of attacks on Linux systems nowadays.

A couple of points: Reporters probably don't understand the financial industry. Many banks require a deposit account in conditions for a loan and it carries thru new owners.  Second point-no attribution. Reporters didn't name one source of info only "reports say". Trustbutverify!

@NoahGrayCNN Gee maybe it was ordered by the Secret Service??
@stsa7535 @JayCaruso By whose reckoning?  You decide...
@brianstelter Have you ever BEEN in a pool, Brian? You're usually not even close to the President any more...started with Pres. Clinton.  Pool reporters are just there for cover video ("spray") and photo-ops and in case he's shot at.  Not interviews. Reporter needs to get over it.
@JayCaruso No, it's called a suggestion.  Just like James Clapper "suggests" on CNN that Russian leader Putin has Trump as an "asset."
@CathyYoung63 @joshgreenman It all depends on your definition of "vetting".  Accusations only now raised should be suspect regardless of party-and investigated, not vetted, for their veracity, not what attorney they have backing them.
@joshgreenman @CathyYoung63 Amazing. It's "Sexual McCarthyism" if it's a Democrat accused, but not if it's a Republican?  There are always reasons that old accusations need to be investigated but I never saw any calls for that on the stories from the Roy Moore accusers. Only when Democrats were involved.

@Llauger1964 @DrewDawg @KCSpiron @tinapayson Ending discussion because you're using the dead as pawns in getting what YOU want. Not me.
@Llauger1964 @DrewDawg @KCSpiron @tinapayson The time to talk about an issue is when emotions r settled. Angry responses seldom fix things.
@KCSpiron Agreed. Two young people who had so much ahead senselessly lost. Sympathies from this reporter to the WDBJ newsroom!
@DrewDawg @Llauger1964 @KCSpiron @tinapayson It was @Llauger1964 who said "end the NRA". That's pro-gun. I'm saying there's a time-not now.

@DrewDawg @Llauger1964 @KCSpiron @tinapayson There's a time and place for gun debate. Not now. Respect the reporters' families and wait.

Well, Google does it again: Our DNS apparently got misrouted not their website. Still not a warm fuzzy that noone in the campaign called me.

David Young acceptance speech Iowa GOP 3rd district nominating convention: http://t.co/79ubbxCYGR via @YouTube
David Young wins it as Polk County gives equal votes to him and Brad Zaun...Young wins with 55 percent of the vote
Rural vs. urban battle as it could be David Young in the fifth ballot over Brad Zaun
David Young's out working the Monte Shaw teeshirts for votes.
It's between David Young and Brad Zaun now as the last two letters of the alphabet battle it out.
@ELeeBakker yup...darned autocomplete!
Shaw asks supporters to back David Young
We'll see if Craig Robinson's prediction of five ballots comes true-it could be 4 if Young is dropped after 3rd ballot.
Zaun says "I will spill my blood to save the unborn" and talks about his bill to eliminate state Dept of Education.
With Robert Cramer dropping out and Grandanette out, the negotiations begin
And now a lull in the action as we get ready for the 3rd ballot in the 3rd district GOP convention.  Grandanette is dropped.

@desmoinesdem @michaelbd Not rare at all, since all the races are local.  Aggregate vote means nothing. Again, Tip O'Neill knew how to win.
@desmoinesdem @michaelbd Your statement about it being used most by GOP is not true.  In states where Dems rule, they use it with aplomb.
@desmoinesdem @michaelbd gerrymandering is a tactic that was most often used by Democrats until the GOP started controlling many state legs.

Tonight's question: How many people will stay at the FAMiLY Leader event to see The Donald? Had a number of people who left after Ted Cruz
So far, biggest crowd pleasers at FAMiLY Leader summit: Branstad on homeschoolers and Ted Cruz's dad (Cuban exile and minister).

Occupy Des Moines' Clarke Davidson fails to win a seat on the district platform committee at the Polk Co. GOP convention.
Correction: Davidson was nominated District platform committee not county
Polk GOP convention just had a nomination for Clark Davidson of Occupy DSM to the county party platform committee.
Repeal of Citizens United fails overwhelmingly at Polk County GOP convention
Platform proposal by Occupy members to do away with Citizens United ruling.
Polk GOP convention...just approved platform plank opposed to federal subsidies for natural gas as auto fuel.

Facebook's Zuckerberg catches heat for "Like" of post about Mitt Romney-turns out  wasn't a Mitt endorsement after all http://t.co/SqF7ZZNW
I'm in geek heaven. Just got the AT&T upgrade for my Galaxy S (Captivate) to Gingerbread from Froyo.
RT @ppppolls: We called a big night for Santorum but based on what's in in MO and MN so far it's going to be an even bigger one!
We know now that Santorum wins MO. Predictions for CO and MN anyone?
Santorum wins Missouri and early CO returns have him way ahead.  Could Santorum push Newt out of the spotlight?
@JohnKingCNN Why didn't any national reporters point out that Iowa's caucuses didn't select delegates either...Santorum won it?

Ahh...so finally the other two questioners get to come on in FL debate-guess they would detract from Brian Williams' glow if on at beginning
RT @tobyharnden: Audiences in South Carolina were big help for Newt. But this #FLdebate aparently being held in morgue.
So who are the other two FL debate moderators that Brian Williams bumped off? (Empty microphones and desk space)
Not sure if voters see Mitt as winning.  But Brian Williams has given Newt a chance to fight back and he's been lukewarm this time.
@DonMcDowell @KentSorenson He missed several - it's in the minutes.
@smg_lynch Remember he's Ranking Member on State Govt. and Govt. Oversight.  He's not completely a back-bencher.
@smg_lynch Committees are everything...and he's missed the ones he works on.
State Sen. Kent Sorenson's in South Carolina campaigning for Ron Paul...has missed his legislative duties during the crucial 1st few weeks.
Frustration:: Trying to get Fox News Radio to correct its erroneous report that Iowa Caucus results won't be certified-it's certified guys!
Sucks to be NBC News. They're tied with Jon Stewart at the bottom on new poll on most trusted TV news net-Fox is tops. http://t.co/jwf4E5jn
Hey, Laura Ingraham? Will Newt be on your show Wed. saying he wants to team w/Romney to defeat Ron Paul??
Big question...can Huntsman get money from his daddy to allow him to go on. If not, SC will be tough.
@KyleMunson @CNN They can't find them.
Analysts starting the anti-Paul run...they're saying Paul "did what he was supposed to do" but hasn't shown steam beyond that.
Romney hopping a plane now to go to South Carolina.  Wonder if Rick Perry will be there when he arrives?
I'm reminded of the Duffy cartoon right now... http://t.co/FOsAox1s #nhprimary
Have to correct my last tweet-networks called NH primary for Romney w/less than 19 percent of the vote in...wow...
It may be all over by then, but WHO Radio listeners, coverage of NH primary follows Iowa game
What a change from when the nets were terrified to call a race from exit polls til they had 50pct of vote in.  Called with 30pct+ tonite
Fox still can't tell who will be in 4th place-Santorum or Gingrich
Exit polling in NH: majority not upset if Romney's nominee...but big negatives to RonPaul or Santorum being nominee
So Fox news calling race for Romney, Ron Paul 2nd, Huntsman 3rd, Gingrich and then Santorum
@IowaNextGen It's not that easy to find...look at http://t.co/njISNyRb in the lower 1/3 of the page under "Popular links" - you'll see it.

@bschopis Don't need the sexist attacks...I cover legislatures and READ THE BILLS. None are outlawing contraception. NONE.
@iowanews1 @bschopis Wrong again.There's no specific language in any of those states' efforts banning contraception..NONE. Read the bills!
@KrauseForIowa WOW. That was a big bold shot with no ammo in the barrel. The lawsuit on civil rights against the state is for Culver era!
@bschopis There is no state that has proposed, discussed/talked about outlawing contraception. Only sheer speculation by abortion advocates.
Well, now that Donna Brazile has endorsed Mitt Romney for president...
Geesh what a difference a state can make. ABC debate in Iowa=thoughtful. In NH=questionable. Contraception?? Really??
RT @JoeTrippi: Many complain Iowa was irrelevant in GOP nomination process -- but when we look back on it will it be NH that didn't matter?
What Iowa businesses/individuals are showing stuff at CES? Would love to talk about you.

Hey Romney staff...anyone care to share pics of the Occupy DM protesters being arrested?

So how many people think that Ron Paul could pull off an upset in Iowa?  Rep. Steve King told me that in bad weather it could happen.
I have to admit-Bachmann's back to the original Michele we saw in the first debate #ABCdebate

Huckabee tells reporters that if he runs in Iowa he hopes Palin doesn't-and endorses him.  Says if he runs he won't run campaign on fumes

Jackson County's done canvassing votes and Tod Bowman's margin is 71 votes in Iowa Senate District 13 cementing Democratic control(barely)

What don't you know and how will you learn it?  Wow.
Verdict on the debate so far:  Not a game-changer for Dems and GOP...but  I think some undecideds will start finding McCain more like them.
Foreign policy.  The stuff that wonks demand but I'm watching the audience try desperately to stay awake.
I can't wait to see the "dials" on this debate.  Willing to bet that undecideds found McCain more on "their side" than Obama.
What I'd really like to do is do a Mystery Science Theater 2000 version of this debate
Still waiting for Rev. Wright or Ayers to walk in and hug Obama.  Hasn't happened yet....hmmm
McCain has held his own tonight and out-Obama'd Obama so far
The Republican Party just got a campaign contribution from Hair Club for Men.
One of the most bone-headed parts of McCain's plans is the health care plan and the taxation of the employer contribution.
Guess who voted for that (pork barrell energy bill)...that one.  Guess who voted against it?  Me.  THAT'S the soundbite of the night.
Uh oh...Obama's stuttering.  That means he'll wonk an issue to death.
I don't understand why Obama's talking about "new energy economy".  It makes it look like he's supporting McCain's earlier proposals.
Only a few percent of small businesses make more than $250,000 per year, Sen. Obama?  What economics class did you attend????
"I got some news Sen. Obama...the news is bad."  This is the McCain that the media fell in love with four years ago.
Nailing Jello to the wall...love it
I think Obama expected a food fight and McCain's not giving it to him.  He's prepared to slash and burn while McCain's "going positive".
Obama connects:  quotes price of gas in Nashville.
McCain goes on the attack against Obama and the Dems on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac...doing what he needs to do
Obama is a rerun of his old stump speeches so far...McCain came up with a new proposal...buy up home mortgages and renegotiate 'em.
At home sick...ready to watch the debate.

OH MY GOD!!! Obama's "I've got a bracelet too" comment. Wow.
Obama thinks it's a college lecture...McCain thinks its a recital of his stump speeches...both are yawners.
I take that back.  John McCain saying he opposes ethanol subsidies.  Farmers will pillage him tomorrow morning for that.
In the end, this debate changes nothing.  Won't win anyone over, won't lose any voters.
Watching the debate and wishing either one of them would be forced to answer a question.
Surreal...Superman in Des Moines stumping for Obama...
Note after looking at my emails:  Does anyone except campaign staffers REALLY have debate watching parties?  Obama and McCain think you do!
Wow, what a week!  I wonder as the cost of short-term borrowing climbs how many companies will have to layoff workers to cover the interest?
