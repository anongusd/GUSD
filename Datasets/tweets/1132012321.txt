@alweaver22 Here's my take: Names are related to someone's culture and say a lot about a person's upbringing and views. Robert Francis O'Rourke going by "Beto" shows his connection to Latinos. Rafael Edward Cruz going by "Ted" shows him distancing himself from his Latino last name.
Waiting for the "What's in a name?" think piece regarding the nicknames of Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz Re: Texas senate race.
Still no mention of the interim WH security clearances in this hearing, in case anyone is following along at home.
also just gonna say my friends/family call me Dan/Danny and when they describe me to people who don't know me, people think I'm actually a man so what would Ted Cruz have to say about that HMM??
