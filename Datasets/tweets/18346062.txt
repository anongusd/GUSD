@TheDemocrats make a real feasible plan, show it, market it and get out there and talk directly to the people. The End!
Do you fucken jobs already. Show @realDonaldTrump supporters just how this wall will affect them in their lives. And how they will be losing their support systems. Show them how we can secure our boarders with out taking away their safety net.
We have geography issues where it‚Äôs not even possible, we have a northern boarder that will have no wall. Show them why and how a wall is not the answer and then show them your plan. Get out there with a real plan not just talking points.
We don‚Äôt want to dismantle @ICEgov you need to be on every network with a white board showing them in pictures how building a wall along the boarder is not feasible, we have private citizen that own some of the land (imminent domain, takes years)
@SpeakerPelosi and the @TheDemocrats are not very good at messaging, they need to make it as simple and basic let @realDonaldTrump supporters  know we the Dems do want boarder security.  And we don‚Äôt want them to lose out in the process.
