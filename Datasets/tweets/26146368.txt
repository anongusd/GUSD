@JudicialWatch @senatemajldr @SenTedCruz @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC @GOPChairwoman @SenThomTillis @BurrForSenate https://t.co/oFJkdSkxYa
5/5	The Democrat Governor picks the next Judge.	Implications are unlimited. Other states can cite this case and do the same thing.  Collins can wipe out all new laws of the past two years.  People‚Äôs votes no longer count, why bother voting?	Call your Senators, GOP, Congress.
4/5 Limit state income tax rate to 7% (57.35% voted in favor)	‚úÖruled against it because NC Legislation is illegal and Illegitimate	This will go to the State Supreme Court which has 7 judges, six are Democrats. The Republican Judge is retiring and the Democrat Governor selects
3/5. Here is what happened: Voter ID (55.47% voter for it)	Approved by Board of Elections. 18 months later Collins invalidated it 	‚úÖ sided with NAACP saying it is Racist	‚úÖruled gerrymandering is illegal and racist	‚úÖruled entire NC Legislation is illegal and racist
2/5 the ruling appears more like fist pounding than something that should come from the bench	Phil Berger (R Rockingham) Idea Of Judicial restraint has completely left NC. Another example of activist judges taking away political power to suit their liberal agenda
1/5 This is radical activist Judge G. Bryan Collins who has just ruled two dramatically cases that can turn NC upside down, the implications could be nationwide. Wake up America 	NC GOP stated: unprecedented absurd ruling by a liberal judge	Charlotte Observer stated: https://t.co/DYGOGMoQw4
