The Childhood Cancer STAR Act:	 	‚úÖAdvances both research and treatment for pediatric cancer	‚úÖBolsters the surveillance of pediatric cancer	‚úÖRequires the National Cancer Advisory Board to have at least one pediatric oncology expert on its board
Earlier this year, I joined my colleagues in Congress to pass the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. The president signed it into law in June. This measure is the most comprehensive childhood cancer legislation taken up by Congress in memory.
I was proud to secure additional support for this critical program last week through my service on @HouseAppropsGOP. Our brave firefighters deserve the best equipment and training available.
Congrats to the Macedonia Fire Department on being awarded an Assistance to Firefighters Grant from @FEMA to better protect our firefighters and our communities! https://t.co/cfoo4fb7Gz
Congrats to former @Indians player Jim Thome on your induction to the @baseballhall today! Very well deserved after an incredible career! https://t.co/OPXfinZxlW
In the House, we've recently passed dozens of measures to fight fentanyl, fund prevention, treatment and recovery, &amp; empower local health leaders to address the #opioidcrisis. This is the strongest congressional effort against a drug crisis in history &amp; more must be done.
This week I met w/ folks from TruBloc, a company based in Willoughby that developed a tool to protect law enforcement from encounters w/ fentanyl. Innovations like this will help combat the #opioidepidemic in a smart &amp; efficient way. Thanks TruBloc for your impressive innovation! https://t.co/cxCJvX3zKz
RT @CNN: JUST IN: The US economy grew at an annual rate of 4.1% for the second quarter of this year ‚Äî the fastest pace in almost four years‚Ä¶
The bill also provides strategic capabilities to defend against aggression from countries like China, North Korea, and Russia. Our brave men and women in uniform deserve the best resources available and this NDAA helps us keep that promise.
With House passage, the #FY19NDAA is one step away from the president's desk! This bipartisan legislation will rebuild our military, extend resources to active duty and veterans, and give our service members the largest pay raise in nine years! https://t.co/9Rzlv09bUu

There are more than 500,000 medical technology jobs in America. STERIS, a medical device company in #OH14 employs more than 1,700 of these workers in NE Ohio. I just voted w/ my colleagues in the House to #RepealDeviceTax so these companies can keep operating, producing &amp; hiring. https://t.co/MstoAyO5Om
We must ensure those who wish to pursue a nursing career have access to high-quality education opportunities. My bill, H.R. 959, which just passed the House unanimously, provides greater access to grants for advanced education and recruitment for America's nurses! https://t.co/NGWPkRtRDX
Taxes on life-changing medical technology prevents patients from receiving the best care possible, reduces research &amp; development, and harms small businesses. That is why I support H.R. 184 to #RepealDeviceTax https://t.co/kcbRn2Syfk
As a member of @HouseAppropsGOP, I am proud of the progress we‚Äôve made to appropriate necessary funding for Fiscal Year 2019 to support our military, improve national security, protect the Great Lakes, &amp; combat the opioid epidemic. Only one more committee markup to go! https://t.co/QD4Ajc5rbw

I will work closely with the bipartisan Great Lakes Task Force and other Members of Congress to ensure more funding is secured to necessary standards.
This amount is nowhere close to the amount necessary to fully restore and protect our Great Lakes, which serve as the primary fresh water source for the surrounding areas.
Another year and another upcoming fight protecting Great Lakes funding. The President today released his budget for Fiscal Year 2019 which includes only $30 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. This is 1/10 of what has been previously budgeted for the GLRI.
I discussed our current budget process on the federal level, how I believe it needs to change, and our economic trends across the nation. It was great seeing so many familiar faces and new ones as well. Thank you to everyone who came and participated in the conversation.

This proposal is a viable solution that helps to start the rebuilding of our military and I am proud opioid funding will be included. We need a full year‚Äôs budget and this is a step closer to that goal.

The proposal includes:	--&gt;full funding for our military to begin to rebuild it.	--&gt;Much needed disaster relief for Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as California wildfires	--&gt;down payment on infrastructure investment
