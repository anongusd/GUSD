@mceachern_ty @sethmoulton Yes, we must vote now more now than ever.  I also joined the protest in Boston against child separation.  That was my first official protest in my life.

@LibertyAlerts I understand the process.  I think it looks bad.  It should be more transparent.  I'd like to know how Trump made his decision. What has he to hide.  It's too easy to imagine backroom deals going on before nomination.

@BrianBailieJr You're right.  I generalized all Christians.  Sorry.  I've been seeing people use the Bible lately to defend bad stuff.  Not all Christians are like that.
@WhiskeyGeebs @ErikReed Thank you, I'm sorry for attacking your grammar.  I probably misunderstood your response.  I shouldn't generalize religious people.  I know most religious people are not bad and don't want to force their beliefs on others.  I just don't trust the ones who always talk about it.

@BrianBailieJr Because I don't want laws based on the Bible.  That's like Sharia law. I believe in "Separation of Church and State".  I think religious beliefs should be kept private and not interfere with anyone else's beliefs.  The government should not base any law on any one religion.
