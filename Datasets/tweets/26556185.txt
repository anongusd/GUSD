@withworldnews @gillianbp72 Thanks I am. Goodnight!
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 Hopefully you can see why this is a problematic line of inquiry.
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 "Bad people are going to commit crime no matter what, so why do we even bother making murder illegal?"
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 To think of another way, your logic would suggest the following:
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 So if your answer is no, then the logical follow-up question is "what are we doing wrong?"
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 And remember of course that most murders are perpetrated by white males
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 The real question is "are we just an inherently more violent and murderous people?"
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 So perhaps you missed my point
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 Especially when you compare murder rates in the US to those of literally every other developed country
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 The argument that he would have gotten his hands on such weapons regardless is also fallacious
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 For example, the shooter in LV would not have been able to kill/maim so many people had his access to semi-automatic weapons been curtailed
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 Perhaps (though I think this excuse is a cop out). That said, you certainly *can* minimize their potential to inflict harm.
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 #falseequivalence
@withworldnews @gillianbp72 And I'm sure those rival the accuracy of professionally manufactured semi-automatic rifles and are just as deadly
@Rowdygirlinmt @bantyranny The fake news trolls are definitely out in full force right now (using established methods of disinformation): 	https://t.co/KhYQvDJoGo
@Amy_Dubya Habe you read the decision? I have.
@Amy_Dubya Anyhow, I'm done. Work in the morning! Goodnight and god bless!
@Amy_Dubya They certainly weren't discussing semi-automatic rifles or even handguns as those didn't exist at the time.
@Amy_Dubya Actually, when looked at in historical context, the 2nd amendment pertained to local militias, not personal gun rights
@Amy_Dubya Rather than  just blindly assert that everyone should,d be able to buy whatever gun they want in unlimited quantities
@Amy_Dubya But we can regulate them the way we have cigarettes
@Amy_Dubya We don't have to make all guns illegal
@Amy_Dubya The point is
@Amy_Dubya The US has one of the lowest smoking rates of all industrialized economies,  and smoking-related deaths have plummeted.
@Amy_Dubya Actually, anti-smoking regulations in the US have been one of the great public health successes of the last 100 years
@Amy_Dubya Not to mention all the suicides and accidents (e.g. children shooting their parents guns)
@Amy_Dubya And bear in mind that most murders in the US are perpetrated by white assailants.
@Amy_Dubya Or is there something else going on?
@Amy_Dubya Are we just more violent as a people?
@Amy_Dubya Not going to argue anymore. Just take a minute to compare murder rates in the US with those in other developed countries.
@Amy_Dubya So unfortunately (and shockingly) I think your "personal" decisions impact other people

@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Sanders is, literally and figuratively, old news.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko So bury the hatchet and think about who's going to run in 2020--a candidate who can get progressive policies in place and build a coalition
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Only a fool would be willing to roll the dice on someone that old
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Which means he'd be 87 at the end of two terms
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko And frankly, the dude will be 79 by the next election
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Anyhow, I've wasted enough time debating Bernie, when I'd rather focus on the real issues
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Nah he's much better at applying pressure from the outside
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Elizabeth Warren is an excellent example, but there are others too.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko My hope is that our 2020 nominee is a true progressive who also possesses incredible policy &amp; political expertise, &amp; who works with others
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Had he gotten the nod, I would have supported him 1000%.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko But in the end, he just didn't have the expertise, personality, or appreciation of nuance to govern
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko And I think that he is an excellent opposition voice (as evidenced by his ability to being single payer into the fold)
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko He also is doing lots of inmortales legwork in trump country trying to reframe the conversation
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko I give sanders credit for lots of things. He really has made single payer a viable policy position
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Ultimately, I prefer a candidate who knows the issues, who thinks ab how those issues can actually become policy &amp; who doesn't deify herself
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko She cared A LOT not just about policy but about how to make that policy work. And she was not driven by some sense of personal infallibility
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Hillary was not the perfect candidate. She's further to the right than I woud like a Democratic candidate to be. BUT she knew the issues.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Like Trump, he tapped into anger and frustration, and like Trump his campaign was a personality cult fueled by this anger.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Ultimately, this lack of policy expertise, combined with his unwillingness to work with &amp; trust the expertise of others, made him dangerous
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko I would point you to his interview w/ the NY Daily News Editorial Board, in which, when pressed on the issues, he had nothing to say
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko I also read through policy statements/interviews so I can get a sense of what candidates stand for, if they know what they're talking about
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko I'm someone who thinks that the President of the US should be well versed in policy matters--not just ideas, but implementation, nuance.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko 4) Related to 3, Bernie made lots of bold pronouncements, but when pressed on the issues, it was clear he was compeltely out of his league.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko (Which, by the way, is how this idea support for progressive ideals necessitates support for Bernie originated.)
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko 3) Rather than make the campaign issue-focused, he made it about him. So instead of talking policy, here we are talking about Bernie *again*
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko 2) I am inherently skeptical of anyone who is so convinced that he is right all the time that there's no room for any sort of debate.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko I was turned off by Bernie for other reasons: 1) The way he parroted GOP talking points about Hillary being too ambitious and unlikeable.
@William55184363 @JoyAnnReid @AdamParkhomenko Let me make one thing clear: a lot of Bernie's ideas are ones I absolutely support. This is exactly the falsehood to which I referred.

@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan Since NY, CA, TX &amp; FL are all incredibly diverse states, minorities' voices are diminished considerably.
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan But NY, TX, FL &amp; CA have 8 Senators. The 35 smallest states have comparable population but 70 Senators.
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan #Senate seats in context: the 4 most populous states (NY, TX, CA, FL) have 107m people, equaling combined population of 35 smallest states.
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan That doesnt even include votes for Sanders (VT) &amp; King (ME) who run as independents but caucus with Democrats.
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan That's not about gerrymandering but about the Electoral College &amp; the massive overrepresentation of rural states in the Senate
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan And while Hillary won the popular vote (+2.86 million votes/2.1%), Dems also won the Senate popular vote by (!!!) 11.1 million votes--11.4%.
@FrankAmari2 @SpeakerRyan Democrats would have won 15 more House seats in 2016 if allocation aligned w/ popular vote:  225-209 (-16) &amp; not 240-194 (-46). Huge swing.

@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg That is the problem. Rather than blame politics, hold your elected officials accountable. Research issues. Don't listen to histeria. Vote
@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg To sum it up, illegal immigrants are a scapegoat. They are not the problem. The government has failed to enact policies that support us.
@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg I think you missed the point
@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg Undocumented immigrants are an easy scapegoat, but deporting them won't make things better--if anything, we'll all be worse off.
@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg Such as tax cuts for the wealthy, the gutting of welfare, inadequate &amp; unequal school funding, lack of job training, no maternal leave etc
@ExquisiteTranny @Oh_Lovelacee @civilrightsorg Don't blame "Mexicans" for the failure of our government to adequately support its citizens. Blame decades of policies that hurt Americans.
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth So don't blame immigrants. Take a hard look at what your elected officials really stand for. Look at the facts. Hold leaders accountable
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth Politicians support policies that help big business, the super rich, but they sell them as cutting govt waste, personal responsibility
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth The reality is decades of gov't bait and switch. Take tax "reform"--billed as helping middle class but really just benefiting the super rich
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth The problem is not #DACA &amp; definitely not Dreamers or immigrants in general. It's decades of policies helping the rich, hurting middle class
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth In any case, I think you're correctly identifying an issue--the need for policies that support job growth--but misdiagnosising the problem
@SoCalValleyGal @B89Adam @ciriacisbeth Right but that misses the point. Their age now is less relevant. What matters is they came as children--it was their parents' decision
@Oh_Lovelacee @ExquisiteTranny @civilrightsorg It's terrible faith for trump to turn his back on people who are relying on daca while they wait for the law to change

@nytimes The state government is wildly hands off about most things (not abortion but sigh that's Texas). Local policies/implementation vary wildly
@nytimes This is all true, but it's also really important to discuss the lack of state leadership that has enabled all of this.
@aegallagher @nytimes Yeah I saw that earlier. Broad overgeneralization in an otherwise well written article
@Slate So it's a huge mess. But also an easy way for Abbott et al. to blame local &amp; fed gov, when they won't do what's needed for their state
@Slate But bc they're so negligent when it comes to disaster prep, the costs passed onto FEMA etc are way higher than resiliency planning costs
@Slate In the end, they are essentially passing the costs onto the federal govt. it's a secret subsidy, more or less
@Slate So TX officials (Abbott etc.) do all this bc of the usual small govt/taxes are evil/climate change is a hoax reasons. But it's hypocritcal
@Slate But Texas is huge &amp; increasingly disaster prone (floods, tornados, drought,). As a result TX also get a huge % of FEMA $ (2nd most I think)
@Slate State funding is minimal as well. And local govs rarely get federal grants bc they can't match the funding. Poor communities suffer most
@Slate In TX the state barely funds flood preparedness/resiliency &amp; makes everything a local matter. There's no leadership, barely any coordination
@thehill The pardon was reprehensible, but unfortunately presidential pardon power is pretty absolute (aside from self-pardon)

@embea22 @KamalaHarris I'd recommend that you conduct more thorough research about tax policy (e.g. what the bulk of tax dollars actually fund)

@mnarmintor Yeah that's so true. Texas is a funny place. Lots of contradictions
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb Ok, this is my last one! But I really do think Houston will recover well. Some finger pointing is inevitable, but that's how it goes..
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb So even the federal response is terrible, things won't devolve like they did w/ Katrina. I love NOLA, but it was a disaster before the storm
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb Ultimately, I think Houston has lots of excellent institutions/human capital, &amp; a well functioning gov't, which will all help w/ recovery
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb New Orleans is a notoriously corrupt &amp; poor city in a very poor state. Texas has plenty of issues but lots of resources too.
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb Katrina was basically total institutional collapse. I was back a month later &amp; there was debris on the streets, abandoned cars on the roads
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb The difference is that before, during &amp; after Katrina, failures at local, state &amp; fed levels created a perfect storm of gov mismanagement
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb But this is so far beyond what was even remotely conceivable before now that  projections aren't helpful. As far as Katrina comparisons go..
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb I think both Houston and Harris County benefit from good governance structures &amp; modern infrastructure. Of course, flooding does occur...
@mnarmintor @mikiebarb I grew up in New Orleans &amp; at 15 moved to Houston, where it was hard not to notice how much better Houston was at responding to hurricanes.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @IngrahamAngle Weird thing to say en route to #Texas--federal response to #harvey will literally determine the fate of an entire region. Are you up to it?

@ProPublica Also, until 2017, Texas was one of the only states w/o a coastal resiliency plan. The new plan makes recommendations but doesn't fund them.
@ProPublica How about state policy? Climate change ignored, flood protection &amp; funding made local issue, lack of statewide resiliency coordination etc.
@HoustonChron Why are we still debating this? Climate change deniers must be called out, especially Abbott, Cruz &amp; the 8 US Reps serving flooded counties

@tribelaw and when he actually tweets about harvey, it often seems as if he's bragging about (taking credit for?) the terrible records harvey's broken
@EricLiptonNYT So even if Trump fails to lead &amp; federal response is inadequate, I doubt it will be noticeable in the way Bush's negligence was post-Katrina
@EricLiptonNYT But NOLA's gov't is notoriously inept &amp; corrupt, while Houston's gov't functions just fine. Houston's infrastructure is also way superior.
@EricLiptonNYT Of course, it's unclear how the federal government is responding; Trump seems more concerned about Mexico &amp; his Missouri win than Houston
@EricLiptonNYT I'm not sure this level of rainfall could reasonably have been anticipated for Houston very far in advance, so it made sense not to evacuate
@EricLiptonNYT Evacuating the 6.5 million people living in the Houston area is a mess and has been disastrous in the past. Houston's also above sea level.
@EricLiptonNYT Relevant perhaps, but Houston and New Orleans are very different cities. (I grew up in NOLA &amp; lived in Houston for 3 yrs during high school)

@JerusalemFury Saving DACA is a hail mary
@JerusalemFury Yeah but things are looking really bad for him right now, and Republicans in Congress are in crisis mode.  It doesn't hurt to try.
@JerusalemFury I used to work for a Congressman. Trust me, this makes a difference. But it's really your call.
@JerusalemFury So there's a power vacuum &amp; Trump could be more willing to listen. But maybe not. Reaching out in every way possible is our only chance.
@JerusalemFury Yeah but GOP doesn't vote on this.	No one does. And most Congressional Republicans aren't currently speaking to Trump anyhow.
@JerusalemFury Of course, Congressmen are much more likely to push for something if it's important to their district. But I guess you could email Trump too
@JerusalemFury The more pressure the better, especially at a moment when Trump knows he's lost so much political capital.
@JerusalemFury Well DACA is executive policy so it's ultimately Trump's decision. But anyone on the Hill can pressure him to keep it in place.
