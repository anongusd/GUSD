@marykarrlit In teaching, lighting oneself on fire involves volunteering to coach or supervise every activity you are requested to, assigning and grading more than humanly possible, designing and teaching elaborate lessons, worrying about students as if they were your own children . . .

@flwrpwr1969 Best wishes for total recovery.
@minhyoungsong Yes?
@pattheschmidt @GJThurell @stucam7771 Precisely.

@RachelleinMI I like potted plant parenting: create good growing conditions, plant the seed, water regularly, prune sparingly and see what happens. üòä
@marcorubio Repair the voting system in FL. Require paper ballots everywhere. Create a full-proof method for counting and recounting. Americans are tired of this National embarrassment. Make sure every vote is counted everywhere.
@central_phs They do!
@realDonaldTrump Please stop making allegations without proof. You are undermining our Democracy. Whenever something is not working out your way, you call it fake, regardless of evidence. That is not healthy for you or for America. A real leader sees things as they are and is straightforward.
@marcorubio You will have to do a recount.
@BillKristol @KevinMKruse He‚Äôs worried about his hair in the rain. Sigh.
I really detest political discourse these days. Recounts are good. They make sure every vote counts. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt care which party wins as long as I know all legitimate votes were accounted for. Am I wrong to feel that most Americans feel the same way? #justcountalready. https://t.co/JpmMBovyGV
@kmc0108 The funniest thing will be when everyone who misbehaved tells on themselves! Rewards can be privileges: bring a toy to class, eat lunch with the teacher, be first in line, be the teacher‚Äôs helper, etc. Create a menu of choices.
@kmc0108 Have a mystery student each day, or even subject hour. Put each student‚Äôs name on an index card. Draw a card out of the pile. Look at it, but don‚Äôt let the students see. If the person behaved, provide a reward. If not, just say, ‚ÄúOur mystery student will remain a mystery today.‚Äù
@kmc0108 Find ways to spend more time with students, even those who are misbehaving. Eat lunch with them, play a game with them at recess, etc.
@kmc0108 Take advantage of every moment you can to let your students know you love them and find moments where you can tell them they are wonderful. Praise approximations of desired behaviors when students are trying, but are not quite there. Complement profusely those who are on track.
@kmc0108 You will get better at this and things will run more smoothly. Many people have mentioned building relationships. That is key. Even something as little as getting down to a student‚Äôs level and looking him/her in the eye to listen intently when he/she speaks to you builds trust.
@kmc0108 @ShanaCoffelt @N8_Minister One prize my classes always enjoy is mum ball. It can be played in as little as 10 minutes.
@kmc0108 @ShanaCoffelt @N8_Minister Another approach to the dojo is  to only award points as a whole class. Choose three top behaviors: arrive on time, be prepared, listen to learn, etc. Each day award the entire class one point for each accomplishment. After a determined amount of points, give the class a ‚Äúprize.‚Äù
@kmc0108 @ShanaCoffelt @N8_Minister When you use dojo, try not taking points away. Consider making each point earned permanent. I have seen teachers who take points away make behaviors worse in their classrooms.
@marcorubio Um. I think people have been thinking that since the time of George W. Bush. What people want is a full recount. Now.
@bigwheezie @GOP @marcorubio ALL voters.
@krassenstein I would think that could count as defamation, but what do I know? I do know I‚Äôve never seen an administration so ready, willing, and able to lie so pervasively to the country.
@usuallycruel @TalbertSwan I‚Äôm inclined to agree with you on this point, and I would add power: greed and power.
@idobridalhair It‚Äôs not impossible. Bobby and Danielle remind me of my husband and I early on, and we‚Äôve been married 23 years now.
@PreetBharara And that is everything, no matter what party isin power. The balance of power in our government makes sure our government works for everyone, not just a few.
@funder Donald Trump has dragged our political discourse into the toilet and through the sewers - and the rest of the GOP has not only let him, they have cheered him on and even joined him.  That is the biggest reason I am voting for Democrats today.
@Mor_Mor4 @KTWSAW18 @henryrodgersdc @JohnJamesMI @stabenow @DailyCaller I‚Äôm pretty sure that reporter will be disciplined, or even fired. I interned at a local paper 20 years ago, and the political views of the reporters and editors were fairly evenly split. I‚Äôm not saying it is that way in every newsroom, but the ‚Äúbias‚Äù whistle is a bit overblown.
@ClaraJeffery I would lobby for families with young children- prenatal care, birth services, maternity and paternity leaves, public preschool, proper nutrition, education and job training for parents, livable wages, etc. My goal would be to make sure every American has a good start in life.
@FibroBloggers Too close to the truth!
@MsJuneDiane My husband needed to change careers when my daughter was a toddler. I went back to full-time work and he went to nursing school part time. He was our part-time ‚Äústay-at-home dad‚Äù for 8 years. My daughter was 9 when I discovered she had no idea what a ‚Äúhousewife‚Äù was. #timeschange
@MsStephaniG I love her. Such courage and bravery on behalf others and of what is right is exactly what we need from every American right now.
@RVAwonk @jackiejab I would love it if someone could compile and circulate a list of far right vs far left violence since the beginning of Trump‚Äôs presidency.
@icterid @AlexTMazilu @ABC @karentravers The media, especially TV media, doesn‚Äôt report what does not happen. What Trump says and does is news. If he wants a positive image, he must speak and act positively in public at all times. But he does not.

@KatiePavlich It‚Äôs a good thing they are having an FBI investigation to sort through all the allegations.

@minhyoungsong I should say work ‚Äúefficiently.‚Äù I have been Twittering and checking news sources too often for that. https://t.co/q1kv91JEEq
@minhyoungsong I have been unable to work all week. I feel consumed with concern for Dr. Ford and every other woman who is experiencing their own traumas again with her.  It is a nightmare to fear a man of his character will be in a place to control our bodies - this time by law.
@jeremycyoung @jentaub Plus, women and girls who do not at first report their own assaults are more likely to finally report sexual crimes if they think doing so will save someone else they care about from suffering at the hands of the perpetrator(s)-a sibling, a friend, a child, . . . THEIR COUNTRY.
@RepJoeKennedy My thoughts exactly.
@RandalPReed1 @girishpunjabi @IsaacDovere @shannonrwatts @burgessev @BresPolitico @eschor How do you know there is no evidence? Are you an FBI agent assigned to the case?
@CharlesGorbet @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Um. High schoolers pay for criminal behavior in adult lockup all over the country. If Kavanaugh had been charged with these crimes, he would be on a sex offender registry and be nowhere near the Supreme Court. Thank goodness the FBI is investigating.
@bapartofmylife @GOP @strangemans @LindseyGrahamSC @SenTedCruz @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity Thank goodness the FBI is investigating then!
@Sandric1982 @robwknightley @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC Yep.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC That is so untrue. These allegations must be investigated. No man with an alleged past like the one that is being painted for Kavanaugh should sit on the Supreme Court of our land. If the allegations are false, he will be confirmed. If they are true, he will face consequences.
This is a powerful account of an all-too-typical experience. https://t.co/mWbDgGzvAJ
@abpitts https://t.co/qx4Kqks9nz
@JimInhofe Just order an FBI investigation. If you don‚Äôt, it makes Mr. Kavanaugh look like he has something to hide. Since, as you claim, he is an honorable man, he should be cleared in no time and the process can go forward, right?
@PeterAlexander @frankthorp Can we please just ask the FBI to do an investigation?
@EdKrassen That is just a ridiculous sentiment. High school students are held responsible for their actions and they impact the rest of their lives as a matter of course. Cheat, lose your scholarship. Rape or murder, end up in prison, etc. The list is endless.
@tonyschwartz I think a 1 man:1 woman ratio would be fine.
@TeachFirst No advertising campaign will bring teachers back to the classroom. I promise.
@BoilingCrude @stellaaaa @ChelseaClinton What?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Call for an FBI investigation. If these things are groundless, the investigation will be over quickly and the hearings can proceed.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump At this point there is no legitimate way forward without an FBI investigation. Otherwise, you are signaling- yet again - that Republicans care nothing about women‚Äôs experiences and challenges in this world. You will do long-term damage to your party.

@UrbanCowboy4444 @krassenstein I think the FBI should investigate. Everything anyone can say is just speculation otherwise.
@JOJOOZ59 @krassenstein I would like the FBI to investigate. It‚Äôs the only way to get to the bottom of this.
@tvani02 @kithard @TechTutorMark Those guys are completely amazing.
@ChuckGrassley Sounds like the obvious thing to do is have the FBI investigate first.
@MattHennessey The FBI investigation seems like the only prudent way forward to me. The alleged victim has requested it, and the alleged perpetrator should have nothing to worry about if indeed he had no part in the crime. It seems to be the obvious way to go.

@EdKrassen I‚Äôm waiting for the others to come forward. Many perpetrators begin young and escalate their behaviors over the years. There will be other victims, I imagine.
@MarlowJamesM @cin_cincc @EdKrassen While teenagers make mistakes and learn from them, their basic character is in tact by 15. Any teen who would seriously dehumanize and harm an animal or human being by that age should be watched closely and with suspicion as an adult. They should never be a judge.

@ShannaPeeples My district has many women at the helm. This is not just a male problem. In my experience, there are female admins who are just as, or even more, likely to darkly expect teachers to ‚Äúwork smarter, not harder‚Äù to infinity. A peculiar amnesia happens when teachers become admins.
‚ÄúToo much of school, in my experience, fosters a dark co-dependency where staff are told that if they just work harder, give up more hours of their lives, tutor more, then students will ‚Äòachieve.‚Äô‚Äù #truth https://t.co/JsojAHaddT

@MerrillBeckie @robertjmarzano What subject do you teach, at what grade level, and to how many students? How long have you been using this method in your own classes on a daily or weekly basis? Have you noticed a significant difference in proficiency vs a wholistic grading method?
@robertjmarzano What is your recommended case load per teacher for this method? We have this model of instruction in our reading intervention classes, but the recommended case load is 15-20 students per hour, per teacher.
@leeannjung @NoApp4Pedagogy @RandallSampson @senoragaer @robertjmarzano I see that you are a professor though, so I realize it is your job to publish and support methods that are best. Still, it is my job to take those methods and translate them into what is actually possible. This looks daunting, but I know too little about it to be sure.
@leeannjung @NoApp4Pedagogy @RandallSampson @senoragaer @robertjmarzano I ask, because I always have 200 papers to grade, not just sometimes. I, of course have students write much more than anyone can grade, but assessing just one mastery assignment each week is an amazing effort, even if only looking for one area of mastery.
@leeannjung @NoApp4Pedagogy @RandallSampson @senoragaer @robertjmarzano I‚Äôm sure I could figure out how to cut corners enough to survive this method of grading, as I have done for other methods over 22 years as an ELA teacher. A first look at this makes me exhausted though. Are you also a secondary ELA teacher @leeannjung?
@leeannjung @NoApp4Pedagogy @RandallSampson @senoragaer @robertjmarzano I use power standards now. Splitting hairs to the level of detail on the original reports illustrated though, I would need computerized help ‚Äî or a new line of work. Seeing and teaching 192 students in a 7.5 hour day does not leave room for that kind of assessment.
@NoApp4Pedagogy @RandallSampson @senoragaer @robertjmarzano @leeannjung If a teacher were to spend just 5 minutes assessing each of just one essay, for example, that would be an extra 16 hours beyond the workday. A wholistic rubric makes that vaguely possible, but still daunting and career ending, long-term. A detailed rubric? I just can‚Äôt imagine.
@JimCarrey My mother, who is deeply spiritual, has been saying for decades that America has made a habit of sacrificing its children on the ‚Äúaltar of Mammon,‚Äù both literally and figuratively.
@RandallSampson @NoApp4Pedagogy @senoragaer @robertjmarzano I‚Äôm still unclear how assessing mastery at that level of detail for 192 mastery-level projects, essays, etc. is easy. If students are being judged for mastery via computerized tests, that is a whole different ballgame. I agree. That could be easy.
@RandallSampson @NoApp4Pedagogy @senoragaer @robertjmarzano So you are measuring mastery on a digital platform then? I‚Äôm an ELA teacher, so I am wondering about essays, speeches, narratives, research projects, etc.
@senoragaer @RandallSampson @robertjmarzano I would love to hear more about this ‚Äúinstant and seamless‚Äù magic.
@mochamomma Happy mother‚Äôs day to you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
@robertjmarzano How long do you imagine it would take to accurately measure all of that and fill one of those out for each of 192 students? That‚Äôs the per teacher caseload for our middle school next year.
