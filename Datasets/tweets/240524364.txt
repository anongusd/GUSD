@alexburnsNYT so you're saying its...		party time.
DHS had huge problems tracking down kids they separated bc when they did so, they didn't bother to track these separated families as such, and instead just pretended these kids were UACs.		Yet the same DHS has set up a tracking operation following journalists &amp; border advocates.
@ckuck @vdare what is sad is whenever you saw the words "john tanton" they all run and hide and know nothing
This is a critical line of questioning from @RepUnderwood. I saw some of the trauma in these kids, and I'm so thankful for her. It is also very, very difficult to watch Secretary Nielsen again state, falsely, that there was no family separation policy. https://t.co/xMZ7lTynei

4th - If you want to learn more about this, please follow the incredibly brilliant @felicityrose (from whom I cribbed much of this), our partners at  @OKJusticeReform and read this amazing report from @OpenJusticeOK. (fin) https://t.co/8Q2BO8hpjK
3rd - What happens then?		People accused--but not convicted--of non-violent misdemeanors spend 2 to 6 weeks in jail if they can't afford their bail, or 1 to 6 months for non-violent felonies.		This is a massive, life-changing disruption. And again, this is pre-trial.
2nd - The median bond in many Oklahoma counties is set as high as $2,500. For non-violent felonies, its $16,000. If you want to see why Oklahoma is the top incarcerating state in the country, start by demanding huge sums of money from people to buy their pre-trial freedom. 3/5
1st - The report shows that for-profit bail, predatory bond industry sucks *millions* from OK communities. People are losing 10s of millions in non-refundable fees, just to post cash bail, and simply because they're too poor to get out and await trial from outside jail. 2/5

@TomJawetz I noticed that too. Gotta give the masses what the bosses say, tweets are for the hardliners.
@_Drew_McCoy_ ok i'm back. This sums up pretty well my thoughts on it - with the unwilling and unable language. It was an extension, though one I thing is a positive. But I generally think asylum policy very tricky and complicated and people dumb it dumb, which is wrong https://t.co/f7iEWbrf7P
So no one in the Fox primetime lineup ends up going after the President for supporting the deal. Hannity says go POTUS, Tucker doesn't disclose, and Ingraham says he had to because of the shutdown.
@brianschatz I mean...except for that one time
@_Drew_McCoy_ one minute, need timeout - baby crying, will come back on this
@_Drew_McCoy_ I don't agree they shouldn't be able to qualify. I do believe that a fundamental problem we face is a lot of these laws were originally written to stop another Holocaust, which was enacted by a centralized state govt. Threats today in failed states, for example, are different.
@_Drew_McCoy_ 3) Asylum policy is also really hard. You're defining a concept where the goal is not a number of entries, but a set of criteria and you hope people *don't* have to meet it, but they often do in spikes. But if you're an individual or attorney, you're fighting for that one person.
@_Drew_McCoy_ of course unauthorized border crossings have plummeted since 2001 &amp; undocumented population has declined ~100k a year for last dozen year. So I'm not sure which is your primary concern. 2) Assimilation happens faster today, for example, than the past, if that is concern on levels
@_Drew_McCoy_ A few things:	1) If the concern is overall immigration levels, while our precentage of foreign born is highest in a while, immigration levels per capita are not nearly as high as they once were. And for overall numbers, asylum levels are small bucket -- and...
@_Drew_McCoy_ I think we should have an immigration system that serves what is best for our country. I think a healthy and large asylum system does that. Should be criteria &amp; those who meet are accepted. But also: asylum system isnt supposed to be the same as a family or employment visa system
@_Drew_McCoy_ Intentionally slowing down a system to create a backlog--which they have done--isn't the same as "not moving fast enough" -- and more important, it IS legal to apply for asylum between ports of entry. It is illegal to cross but claim is legal. Their goal is clear: cut numbers.
@_Drew_McCoy_ The Trump administration is metering at ports of entry and not letting people apply. It is very real, and it is by design to creating chaos and deter people from applying for asylum. Which is illegal but they put in writing in a memo. https://t.co/SoNSnXvxhR
Nope. This false equivalency is wrong.	1) DACA was in 2012 &amp; not controversial at the time	2) Conflating it was DAPA in 14 is wrong	3) Neither were Nat Emergencies	4) There was strong precedent for both, which is a big reason why DACA is still around.		Precision matters. https://t.co/TMY5dvDvW4

Whatever the merits of a 70% marginal tax rate on income over $10 million dollars, I assure the "the people" very very very much support it on the whole. https://t.co/HMN48D2ZWG
Regarding all this new internal polling on The Wall and border security:		~80% of Americans want border security (in general and however they view it)		~40% of Americans want The Wall and 25% want a shutdown for it		So if you conflate these terms, you can fake a case for support.
@LPDonovan The three year is what tanks it - make it permenant and frame not around potus and Dems are there
I mean...100% they would be. Polling and common sense dictates this to be true. People think the President is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a Dem or Howard Schultz if he signs a border and daca deal? This is not a real thing, just a scare tactic. https://t.co/5LYVrshZ1U

If this fake temporary policy-which isn‚Äôt meant to be temporary-sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the logic the administration used to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a temporary country based pause we promise and not a ban, not a permenant ban, we promise, not a permenant thing‚Äù (paraphrasing)
Btw - the pause doesn‚Äôt end until essentially all of the 11 million are deported AND it causes all legal immigrants on visas and approved but without a green card to leave the country.
It‚Äôs important for these to keep being out there bc folks tend not to really get it, but for reference Miller is in support of a ‚Äúpause‚Äù on immigrarion: at least 10 years with *zero* immigrants and refugees, then consider some immigration at a tiny fraction of current levels. https://t.co/GaAcvRHcWw

So that leaves situation where these people shouldnt be party to negotiations. Pretending they care about border security just ends up making everything worse. 		They're wrong, they're bad, and they are only going to attack you if you ever do something that could ever pass (fin).
If you view immigration as an existential threat to destroy the US &amp; your goal is a 10 year pause on all immigration (Sessions/Miller support, for example), then the point is you will oppose *every possible deal that could pass* like its Armageddon. Appeasement is impossible. 4/5
That is why NumbersUSA is called that--they care about slashing the Number of immigrants as much as possible. And this is where you have to make a fundamental calculation--there is ZERO deal that will ever get 218 and 60 votes that they support. Simple none. 3/5
They are TERRIFIED POTUS will actually do what would be massively popular in the GOP and general public, and provide permanent protections for Dreamers in exchange for border money. Thats because they don't care about legal vs illegal immigration. And they admit it. 2/5
This is REALLY important for understanding immigration. Hardline anti-immigrant groups are worried POTUS is too focused on the wall-both because they don't think its important and because they want to use Dreamers as leverage to slash legal immigration 1/5 https://t.co/eKIsJE28H8

@TimFullerton For sure some of them think that. But this is the bill that makes it easy to make that not happen. It‚Äôs weird honestly.
For context for those just seeing my tweets tonight our org has strongly supported efforts to pair permanent protections for Dreamers with border security in past. Its a reason its so frustrating when there is a clear effort by the WH to falsely present this DOA bill as that.
@TimFullerton its an interesting question.		I think the "they" here is that they may not be unified. Certainly Miller knows this is a poison pill, albeit policies he loves. But he is opposed to any bill that doesn't have either huge cuts to legal immigration or asylum, but those cant pass...
2) They change TVPRA to that children from contiguous countries like the northern triangle who escape violence and reach the US can be immediately deported with a chance to seek an asylum hearing.		Look maybe you think this is good (it is not!)...but they lied about the bill.
On asylum changes, There are at least 2 huge restrictions to asylum: 		1) What they're selling as helping with in-country processing is in fact an unworkable program with a cap on asylum numbers and in exchange they will eliminate people's ability to claim asylum at the border...

6) How do we know? Bc on their website, and with their logo, and every statement they are clear it is abt "ending as much immigration as possible." 		So thats who today is spending millions calling people &amp; telling them to pretend to be constituents &amp; call freshman members (fin).
5) But lying and scaring voters--and running paid phone and ad campaigns--telling voters that Congress was importing immigrants to kill you, take your job, get yer welfare etc did work better. Oh--and they masked it all in being about illegal immigration, but that was a big lie..
4) They were clear in goals: reduce population &amp; keep America as white as possible. A cursory glance of his wikipedia page is filled with comments on this. And they convinced some *very* rich old people to fund their work. But talking about reducing population was bad politics...
3) Wow. What does the eugenics movement have to do with immigration? Well after WW2, "active" eugenics fell out of fashion for obvious reasons. By the 1970s however, folks like Tanton and Roy @RoyBeck_NUSA were pushing that the US needed to stop *ALL* immigration.
2) The term for a govt policy to radically reduce he population of undesirable groups?		Eugenics. 		It turns out that the man who founded his group along is John Tanton, who wrote "The Case for Passive Eugenics" &amp; ran the largest eugenics group in the US. https://t.co/QFGJ9RulrO

Hi Michelle. You didn‚Äôt address my point, at all.

I‚Äôm not sure what that last POTUS tweet m is about on H1-B visas‚Äîcould be their proposed rule, which has some positive elements but for which their incredibly compressed implementation timeline has seen huge amounts of concern across the board. Our 9 page public comment attached! https://t.co/eIUnJaRrf9
@HotlineJosh bracketing your won Secretary of State's visit to the Middle East to own the libs
@awernick I hope you are right. No reason to take on such an expedited timeline jus to appease the administration.
@conncarroll Again, my big point is abt the lack of much reaction in 2012. We can disagree on the second point and imagine we will. The 2016 SCOTUS arguments on it did not reach that conclusion. Anyway - very much on a separate note your boss's excellent leadership on criminal justice policy.
@conncarroll 1) The size of pushback of DACA in 2012 was tiny compared to DAPA &amp; expanded DACA in 2014. This is my main point. Different politics so folks were quiet. 	2) thats a 2.5x difference which is pretty big!	3) There are meaning differences; this is worth read https://t.co/R2V0wd1VFn
@nhannahjones so so important and great.
Excellent segment with @RepJayapal on @chrislhayes who continue to nail the central aspect of this morass: hardliners in the administration see Dreamers as leverage to slash legal immigration to the low west levels since the racial quota laws of the 1920s.
@conncarroll DAPA, not DACA. No one except a tiny number of people (you may have been one, not saying your weren't) cared about DACA, because it was a substantially smaller deferred action (and a very sympathetic population) than many President's in both parties had issued in the past.
I think this is very important: and so far if your goal is a secure and orderly immigration process, they have made things much much worse. https://t.co/Pq5Qd3rLbF

This point should be asked every time this topic comes up: if the Wall is such a national emergency, then how come, as @timkaine points out, not only did The President kill a $25 billion wall/border for Dreamers deal, but he attacked everyone including the 8 Republicans involved.
Excellent points from ‚Å¶@timkaine‚Å© here ‚Äî and everyone should be using and sharing this message:	Dems support big border security investments in a bipartisan fashion that can actually pass. They did some to protect Dreamers in 2018 and with CIR over and over. https://t.co/4bCA5Vi6RP

5)  FROM @CATO:	‚ÄúZero people were murdered or injured in terrorist attacks committed on U.S. soil by special interest aliens who entered illegally from 1975 through the end of 2017. Hat tip @AlexNowrasteh

3) Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, nor is the U.S.-Mexico-Canda trade deal. This is only a talking point used by the Administration to obscure the fact that A. the trade agreement hasn't been ratified and B. the President‚Äôs false statements about economics.
2) Right now, apprehensions at the southern border have been in decline since the year 2000, when they peaked at 1.6M. @CBP reported that in 2017 they reported the lowest number of apprehensions IN 45YRS! #TrumpAddress https://t.co/KzWlENqwi6

The WH will have trouble convincing people they are trying to solve a humanitarian crisis because:	1) People remember Family Separation!	2) Which they hated in part because it was unnecessary &amp; chaotic	3) Swing voters blame POTUS for creating chaos generally, not just cruelty
for example had POTUS come out and supported one of the many the bipartisan compromises a year ago, Hannity and Rush would have been all for it. Coulter will never be happy. But Sessions, for example, would have called it the end of western civilization (tho voters wouldn't care)
To pickup on this from @allahpundit, I'd add that the weird but key dynamic here is the division between political Build-The-Wall media personalities and their usually BFFs, the hard-line restrictionists who are terrified of a DACA for border $ deal supported by majority of US. https://t.co/5XQ8oi1R6q

10) And of course overall, the legal restrictions on immigration were very low until the 1920s, with the terrible exceptions of barring Asians. Sadly, restrictions came by denying basic humanity and rights to many, often based on race. 		Anyway, some history for you.
8) Immigration flows were more acute from certain countries then. Today there are 7 times as many Americans of Irish descent than Irish in Ireland	9) Those who werent white &amp; protestant were always accused of plots, be they Haitian revolutionaries in Charleston of JFK in the Oval
6) Of course, these waves of immigrants were not only much larger than today, but were *slower* to assimilate than recent waves of immigrants, despite the constant false myth you hear frequently.	7) They were also much more poor and poorly educated compared to today's immigrants
4)19th century immigration-levels times &amp; locations-has direct correlations &amp; causations to US becoming the global economic, social, cultural powerhouse it has been ever since	5)Per capita immigration levels remain well below historical averages; p.c. refugee levels WAY below avg
Some facts:	1) Undoc population has declined yearly for last 12 years	2) Overall US immigration has been stable/declined recently	3) For context, between 1830s &amp; 40s, immigration went up 250%. It doubled again betweens 1840s and 50s. Over half of Boston and NYC were foreign born

If we've seen one consistent thing from this President since 2015, it is that every time there is text--a policy proposal (be it Aug of 2015 or two days ago), talking points, an SAO background statement or a formal speech (in Phoenix or tomorrow)--the same man holds the pen. https://t.co/ca0IIN6zI4
Instead of third-hand accounts of alleged emails &amp; quotes designed to attack those behind bars who have nothing to do with the shutdown, the stories could have discussed nearly any other aspect to what it is like to be incarcerated--or to work in a prison even--over the holidays.

@mattyglesias and mandatory background checks on all 11 million and force those who pass to get legal.
I know it gets lost and seems small, but DAPA, not DACA, was what got people amped up in late 2014...when DACA was rolled out in 2012, it was met with almost no opposition by most Republicans. Yes - Jeff Sessions didn't like it and opposed, but they DACA and DAPA aren't the same. https://t.co/76YjeZoMOA
As a reminder given the news from Bolton on Syria withdrawal being condition dependent...General Mattis didn't say the word "Syria" anywhere in his resignation letter. He mentioned two countries but that was not one of them.
like - I get that Roy @RoyBeck_NUSA tells Stephen Miller stuff and that goes into the President's ear about "the base" and that Ann Coulter is never, ever going to be happy with anything possible, but these aren't important people to 90% of GOP voters (let alone swing voters!).
Remains deeply weird to me that the President doesnt understand that his sway with what "the base" will find acceptable is 1000x more powerful than a few commentators--especially because once he actually cut a deal, those people would have to decide if they want to be anti-Trump!

Here's the tragedy!		We should actually be focused on real solutions to our immigration system, like the Dream Act, protecting TPS holders, smart border security, and an actual comprehensive overall, although this is gonna be a bit, but must remain our ultimate goal). (FIN)
But the public has made clear who is to blame, there pressure points are on the Republican side, and its a question of who those vulnerable elected officials split with the Coulter/Miller leadership of the GOP...
So I dont know how this shakes out. Its possible POTUS does something truly unprecedented, like try to pay ICE &amp; CBP by fiat, or shutdown airports and blame Dems...and its also possible this jus slowly builds and more GOP Senators keep telling them this is a bit worse each day...
But whats good for Miller/Coulter is not good for appealing to swing voters. Nov 18 made that VERY clear. Voters have decided who is to blame. Only 25% support the shutdown to get The Wall, which is bad! They dont want a wall or don't care enough want the govt shutdown. ...
But for a tiny subset of media personalities &amp; professional anti-immigrant activists and lib-owners, picking the fight is the most important thing...and they have some sway with a portion of the GOP. And they would rather just fight than budge, let alone actually compromise...
Also: voters dont think The Wall is ever getting built. Even lots of people who want it don't actually care or most think its just a negotiating tool, or a symbol, or a way to show certain people who this country is really for and who it isn't for. Polls are VERY clear on this...
Dems arent going to give POTUS $5B for The Wall by itself. Ever. There is ONE--and ONLY ONE--way that is going to happen, and it isnt being seriously discussed right now because POTUS, who killed $25B for wall last year when it came with DACA fix, has said he isn't doing it now..
The political pressure points are different in the Senate--and this is going to be bad politics for GOPers up in the Senate in 2020. That's why you've already seen Sens Gardner and Collins wanting out of this shutdown right now. This isnt partisan, its where the pressure is...
Every day, more federal workers are going to come under true financial strain...and it seems really, really unlikely that support for "The Wall" is going to INCREASE during this time. They next pay date is 8 days away....
Here are the politics now: TONIGHT, The House will pass a "clean CR" that is the exact same bill the Senate passed 100-0 2 weeks ago. The WH says it'll veto that bill, and it seems unlikely it will get a vote in the next few days. This will look absurd. So then what happens?...
There wasn't a single GOP Senator who felt pressure to deliver for electoral purposes in a shutdown. One could argue Heller should have, but he didnt.		So the shutdown ended-and ended so quickly, it had zero political effect on anything. So what does this tell us about today?...
You needed 60 votes to pass a bill to reopen the government, and very quickly a bunch of Democratic Senators--most in competitive or potentially competitive races--decided they wanted out of the shutdown. And that was that...
Despite that the public wanted Dreamer legislation passed &amp; either evenly split on who to "blame" for the shutdown (or slightly more inclined to blame the GOP), after the first 24 hours of shutdown, that it was going to be a quick one came down to one fact: the 2018 Senate map...
A year ago, the govt shutdown for 60 hours. Now protecting Dreamers was-and is-hugely popular with the American public. But shutdowns become partisan endeavors, and they are about big public fights only as much as they is about the political incentives of 536 elected officials...
A quick note that is a LONG thread (sorry!) on what the 2018 shutdown can tell us about the current shutdown...
@jbarro @allahpundit its "We passed the exact bill that passed the Senate with 100% of Republican votes 2 weeks ago and fund the government, why won't the Senate take them up"
I see 3 ways this goes:	1) This wraps quickly and this is forgotten	2) This ends up very badly for the union bosses! Like...when the next pay period is missed next week. (most likely)	3) POTUS acts is unprecedented fashion and names political allies essentially, tries to pay them https://t.co/7wlumqJQUe

The problem wasn't covering polling, it is stuff like 1) covering every comment like truth and facts are minor consideration 2) not covering policy 3) BothSidesBias 4) social media just pushing out false claims as headlines (ok this si more now)...the polling coverage wasnt issue
WADR: one of the biggest issues with 2016 coverage--and I'd say the biggest that doesn't get talked about much--is huge portions of the media ignoring polling, especially in the last 3 weeks!

Mitt Romney has lived an incredible life and done amazing things. People shouldn't look past this, and is someone for whom I have deep respect. He has often followed absolutely terrible short-sighted political guidance and instincts when running for office. Hope we see the first.
As someone who remains incredibly proud to have helped defeat Mitt Romney in 2012, I sincerely hope that for the sake of the country and his own legacy (not that he cares about my opinion) that Senator Romney acts like private citizen Romney and not political candidate Romney.

Read @JakeSherman @apalmerdc today in Playbook. The framing on how this unnecessary and harmful shutdown is also just mystifying plead politics - and poorly executed politics - is very thoughtful.
Remember when Romney spent  weeks in last 100 days of 2012 making ‚Äúyou didnt build that‚Äù the central theme of his effort? And then polling showed zero voters had any idea what it was about?

5) Its a shame that 700k DACA recipients have to live their lives under this threat. Legislation *should* be passed and signed years ago. It seems unlikely at this moment		But then this is ALL prelude if SCOTUS ends DACA this spring. That is going to be very, very bad and URGENT.
3) House leadership in fact did *everything* it could to kill such a deal, at the direction of Miller. Remember the discharge petition? 	4) The President created this created this crisis for DACA &amp; TPS. He also created this shutdown. He killed a bill that passed the Senate 100-0!
5 reminders:	1) GOP still control the House, Senate and WH: if they wanted to put a Dream for Border/Wall $ deal out there they could. 	2) It is *always* useful for the President to be getting press about "deals" because his base is pleased &amp; it makes this all seem more normal

@BresPolitico @jaketapper The President had the chance at $25 billion and blinked because Sessions, Miller and Kelly wanted him to oppose. The deal is clear and obvious but it‚Äôs meaningless for others to offer. POTUS is cause of DACA and TPS crisis, he could fix it but seems content not to. Bad but true.
@brithume Assuming (&amp; I'm not sure its correct) that staff speaks for him, the point is he didn't offer $2.5 billion and a DACA fix. He hasn't shown he would actually take that--and some on his staff are 100% opposed. I say this as someone who whipped for Rounds-King $25B plus DACA bill.
@spmishra 100%. really in need of some key and critical - but technical - reforms, including recapture, country-cap reform, visa bulletin improvements, and more. H-4 obviously a huge issue that we'd like to see admin reverse course on too, and eventually expand and improve legal avenues

7) On day 1, Congress should fix the urgent crisis facing 1 million Dreamers &amp; TPS holders who are legally living &amp; working in the US. They've been contributing to US for decades. Because of the Trump Admin they're at risk of being ripped out of their jobs &amp; communities. (fin)
6) 	QUESTION 1	-Why did WH reject 4 different bipartisan solutions that would have actually provided funding to build the wall?		QUESTION 2	Is it because deporting Dreamers or slashing legal immigration are bigger priorities to the President and his advisors than border security?
5) So, every time someone claims that building a border wall is an imperative worth putting people out of work over the holidays, they need to be asked the following questions...
4) And no--the deal didn't fall apart *after* the injunctions on DACA rescissions. There were deals before (in the fall) and deals after (in Jan and Feb). 		In fact, the deal closest to passing and with *the most* border money, $25 billion, was a month after 9th circuit ruling.
3) The President had at least 4 bipartisan deals, and at each instance, POTUS at the urging of Sessions/Miller/Kelly killed these deals--and his chances for funding for The Wall--because they did not include massive cuts to legal immigration. 		He had the deal but he blinked.
2) Here are the facts: The President terminated DACA (the courts later found the manner in which he did so to be illegal) and continues to take every action possible to get the Supreme Court to take the case and kill the program...
1) The shutdown is harmful, unnecessary political theater. Given POTUS's own actions, it isn‚Äôt going to end with The Wall, and it certainly isn‚Äôt going to fix our broken immigration system. Now, POTUS &amp; his allies are taking steps to try to rewrite history on DACA &amp; The Wall...

Of course this was ALWAYS a lie. Sessions or @RoyBeck_NUSA will never support legalization. They just used promises of future legalization to obscure their true goals of slashing immigration.		My point: everyone should use today and never take them as honest or serious again.

The idea that a bunch of GOP primary voters are gonna revolt against the President who yesterday was tweeting about the merits of family separation or who proposed a Muslim ban 3 years ago this month is just wrong.
The point is actually a few things	1) when it comes to the actual GOP base, President Trump is 100x the border security validator than anyone else is	2) people use the wall as a proxy for a LOT of different things (some very bad)	3) people rationalize a lot of stuff
Doubt it! We did focus groups of 48 Trump voters in June ‚Äò17. Asked about The Wall:	-1 said building physical wall was a top priority	-2 said they thought it would happen	-3 said they really wanted it but wouldn‚Äôt happen	-42 said it was either a metaphor or a negotiating tactic https://t.co/CjuebbOqK3

@DLind late to this, but think idea that it was replaced by multicultural meritocrat elite seems totally false to me. Sounds code for "clintons bad white trash," "i'm going to pretend GWB &amp; Iraq wasn't old elite driven disaster" and "obama(ism) bad." But this isnt some same elite rule
It says secular too (btw the idea that Clinton, GWB and Obama had less faith that Reagan, Nixon, Johnson, GHWB etc betrays the author's deep bias). And it is a bad article for other ways.		But dont look past the Times put Obama's blackness a cause for him being a worse president.
That @DouthatNYT story merits a serious soul-searching and apology from the NYTimes. The header says that his successors-except its just one-diversity is a reason they (but its just the one black President) was a reason he was a worse POTUS.		Yes, it says that. Its the subheader.

Mickey, who is a liar on top of other bad things, is aware that it was people like him &amp; his allies inside the admin who killed the $25 billion for wall funding that was offered in early 2018.

@newman_chris @JessicaV_CIS No way! But if folks change their mind, I'll buy the snacks.
Respectfully:	1) This math is not at all correct but	2) The President killed at $25 billion border wall deal early in 2018, led by his staff who killed it because they don't care about a wall and wanted to use Dreamers to get a 50% cut in legal immigration. https://t.co/VyrUfLqm7n
Personal observation:		This is one of the more interesting things I've seen since the election.

@DavefromTO @LPDonovan @FWDus @NumbersUSA 4) I forgot to say that "merit-based" is a term used by lots of people. The FAIR/Numbers/Cotton/Perdue approach meant "cut family-based by 85% and don't add any skills/employment based"...and obviously framing family-based as unskilled is wrong and their goal too.
@DavefromTO @LPDonovan @FWDus 2) Goal of anti-immigrant groups is to cut overall numbers. That is why @NumbersUSA name is that. And their logo shows their goal to cut US population in half by 2050. Thats very unpopular.	3) So you can expand overall numbers or shift within. 13 and 06 took respective approachs
@DavefromTO @LPDonovan @FWDus as @LPDonovan points out, lot of range there. So a few things:	1) If we had actual working pathways, it would help. This includes employment-based, family-based, asylum and refugee (which are different). Trump admin hasn't just been "mean" but has added chaos, made things worse

7) shoot tear gas I guess over the border...and watch people run around in chaos and film it

But if you close ports of entry and deny people their legal right to apply for asylum‚Äîor functionally do the same by ‚Äúmetering‚Äù where you manufacture massive wait times‚Äîyou‚Äôre going to encourage some of those fleeing for their lives to cross through the desert, while others...2/3
Really important:		The *goal* of some of those shutting ports of entry *is* to get footage of people in large numbers at the border. Because an orderly process is boring b-roll. Over 100k people legally cross the border each day; an orderly asylum process is a tiny fraction 1/3

RT @LPDonovan: This does a pretty good job of laying out the immigration hardliner case against ending birthright citizenship. https://t.co‚Ä¶
TFW the hard-line anti-immigrant group‚Äôs can‚Äôt even pretend this isn‚Äôt clearly illegal...so they just say it hasn‚Äôt been tested yet. 		Next up: they posit that maybe the blue you see is my green. Like you can‚Äôt disprove it man https://t.co/Fwr1ZLq1bH
@JeffSmithMO I mean, I‚Äôve seen a lot of polling of suburban women on immigration, and they really really don‚Äôt like or buy this stuff. You know what activated them on immigration? Family separation - and not the way the President wanted it. But we‚Äôll see.
@LPDonovan @DavidMDrucker Yeah and this morning they‚Äôre all tweeting this is good but basically admitting it‚Äôs illegal and will lose in the courts, but saying that‚Äôs good to ‚Äúclarify‚Äù the need for a new amendment.

Lest you think it won‚Äôt get worse in terms of policy ideas from Miller/Sessions/Kobach/Roy Beck et al...remember that during the campaign then candisiate Trump claimed birthright citizenship might not ‚Äúcount‚Äù for those who have already been born - aka 4 million US citizens.
Anyway: POTUS absolutely cannot eliminate 14th amendment‚Äôs birthright citizenship clause by exec order. Just like he can‚Äôt do an executive order barring 18-21 year olds from voting. This is clearly illegal, should be covered as such. It‚Äôs a political move too. Don‚Äôt miss that
Good Morning!		With 1 week to go before an election and wanting a distraction, it appears we‚Äôll be following the pattern of the 3 years and making subtext the text. 		Saying the quiet part out loud, POTUS wants to have an explicit debate about how the 14th amendment it seems.

As for our methodology, we looked through the first 475 newspapers they put up on their site yesterday. We could only see frontpages. Not all covered shooting at all. We did not include international papers. 7/7 (fin)
Chaos, confusion &amp; anger are the wrong approach. Understanding the issues is impt. If people exclude the words of a man who murdered 11 people &amp; exclude the integral aspect of anti-immigrant hatred in today‚Äôs white supremacist movement, its missing a key aspect of this story 6/7
Today the conspiracy is Jews are ‚Äúimporting‚Äù immigrants, often Muslim, to replace white people. Thats ‚ÄúWhite Genocide‚Äù to them. Its what Neo-Nazis in Charlottsville meant with ‚ÄúJews will not replace us.‚Äù Its a serious (and awful) policy agenda: stop all non-white immigration 5/7
Tim. McVeigh was a Neo-Nazi (not just militia member as often misunderstood). He was found with pages to the ‚ÄúTurner Diaries,‚Äù a racist, genocidal novel beloved by white supremacists. The villain is ‚ÄúThe System," a govt run by Jews who use black people to control white people 4/7
Anti-semitism is a very, very old disease--and central to that disease is that Jews are always in a secret conspiracy. The second is that it is never just about the Jews--in part because there just aren‚Äôt that many of us to be the villains by ourselves in the conspiracies. 3/7
I don‚Äôt know why a man kills 11 people. Not sure that is an answerable question. But what we all must clearly acknowledge is the killer was very direct abt his own public reasoning. He went to kill Jews bc he believed they were importing immigrants to destroy white people. 2/7
NEW: of Sunday's 475 US newspaper frontpages (via the Newseum) showed less than 10% mentioned the synagogue killer's expressed anti-refugee/immigrant motives. 		This is a real mistake. Local and National news is NOT twitter. Key aspect of this story was missed for most in US 1/7

@MarkSKrikorian You always seem to forget the ‚Äúexcept‚Äù part...I‚Äôm starting to think maybe it‚Äôs intentional
11) Here's what you can do:	-Remember we're the strongest country in the world. No need get consumed by faked crises.	-If you're a reporter or someone who talks to lots of people or very few people, explain to them what is really up!	-Support Candidates who get this. Vote! 	(fin)
10) This is how it works. 		And the way it stops is people understand what is happening. They see around the corner. They don't fall for some false choice we have to eliminate the entire asylum system or have some fake idea of open borders. 		So in closing...
9) Zero. Not a single child or mother would be allowed to even apply for asylum at the border--no matter the circumstances or the life or death consequences. That is their plan. This is bad for the world. It is very bad for America and Americans.		https://t.co/13d8y2Lf1Q
8) Obviously there is a huge political play here. It is a very obvious one. You get it. I won't waste time explaining. 		But tonight it started to leak out that he admin, under guise of "stoping the Caravan," plans to eliminate ability of ANYONE to apply for asylum at the border.
7) But this is NOT what coverage of "The Caravan" is about. It's b-roll. And when you watch it with the sound off, you don't hear the commentators say "of course pretending this is a national security threat is a scare tactic." Some media have enabled what my come next...
6) We‚Äôre the most powerful country in the world. We can have an orderly process where people fleeing for their lives can apply for asylum. For those eligible they can stay in the US. For those deemed not eligible through a fair process, they should return to their home countries
5) Applying for asylum is LEGAL. It is enshrined as a right under US and international law. If you pass a "credible fear" session, you get the right to an asylum hearing. 		America should be proud to give those fleeing for their lives the right to a fair, humane hearing!
4) Over past 15 years as border crossings have declined ~85%, there's been a substantial rise in people coming to southern border and claiming asylum. Why? The "Northern Triangle" countries of Central America (top homicide rates in world) from which people flee for their lives
3) If you back to August 2015, you can see that on the **written** immigration plan that went up on candidate Trump's website (which was written by then Senator Session's team), it clearly laid out eliminating asylum as a key priority. https://t.co/EGer3M8ru0
2) Long-term goal of hard-line anti-immigration restrictionists are not about legal vs illegal immigration. They have three big goals: 	-Slash overall (legal) immigration levels	-Ramp up deportations of all 11 million	-Eliminate asylum &amp; refugee system		They admit this readily!
1) CONTEXT matters: 	-Unauthorized border crossings are down ~85% since 2001.	-The Caravan is rapidly shrinking and 1000 miles away.	-We are the most powerful country on earth		Its a manufactured fake "crisis" driven for politics and enabled by b-roll. Reject the crisis premise.

Ann Coulter is a racist and a hack. But she isn't dumb. If you're pretending that she and others don't know what they're doing - by asking questions like "what proof do you have the Caravan is a Soros-funded vote operation" - then you're helping her.
Pro-Tip: No one actually believes the Caravan is a plot to bring a bunch of votes in for Democrats.		But by saying this over and over, it eliminates truth and makes everything seem like everyone is lying. And if everyone lies, it easier to foment a crisis &amp; demagogue on an issue.

If you believe you're protecting democratic institutions by refuting the idea that the press is the enemy of the people (and you are), you should stop repeating lies and false statements about invading immigrants or a border crisis. You know why its being said; don't repeat it.
In IR theory terms: you can be a realist (vs liberal or constructivist) and then we can debate the strategic value of the US having an ally for a few decades with an abysmal record on a number of issues, but said theory allows for some strong denunciations not to shift everything

Can't wait for Breitbart's next expose:		A man named Tom got a raise. He is a paralegal. Tom lives in a country that had some immigrants - and many non-immigrants. Tom also likes pizza. And sports.		Ergo: Tom got a raise because POTUS wants to slash legal immigration levels!

Take:		A few dozen GOP twitter folks who didnt like POTUS returning to a more partisan outlook this week is not a big deal		But a tiny handful of GOP elected officials who almost - but didn‚Äôt - bail on candidate Trump 2 years ago this week was an astronomical, history-making deal
@xenocryptsite If you get a good argument please share. I‚Äôve never seen. Also assumption that senate exists to protect ‚Äútraditions‚Äù of the states begs some questions
@matt_blackwell @DanRosenheck I mean that is pretty big! But I agree the primary issue is the senate.		I think the question is - for the senate - has there been a comparable period where small vs big states sorted by party (which is really just small states gone R outside DE and VT)		I‚Äôm not sure?
The President didnt put Kobach in his administration before because Kobach asked for DHS Secretary and then Republicans made clear he was not confirmable for a single position.

And yes of course I know ICE vs CBP, but point I'm making is general sentiment and the President's immigration policies were very unpopular a year ago, got worse from DACA fight, and then left a real and lasting hit to his approval rating (along with Putin summit) in June/July
My two cents (I could be wrong here): this is a marker/indicator of people who back the President but don't like his immigration policies overall. That is about 1/4th to 1/3rd of them and so would line up here. 		The larger point: family seperation very unpopular &amp; left a mark. https://t.co/TCbGLR4jN9

@karaswisher @joseiswriting excellent.
I'm continually amazed how many people on here miss that what politicians want is the months and months of coverage on their perceived deliberate/thoughtful/moderate/non-partisan/issue-based decision process. That bakes into voters minds. The final decision is just one part.
On DACA &amp; Family Separation, POTUS got VERY unhappy about press coverage (and he appears not motivated on overall immigration levels)		I think true story is one of dominance within an administration-often to the huge policy &amp; political detriment of the admin-but not all "winning"
But on three of the largest policy goals (and along with travel ban, most high profile)--1) end DACA 2) get congress to halve legal immigration 3) family separation &amp; subsequent efforts to indefinite child jailing--a huge public pushback has beaten back  Miller's effort...
So I think this NBC story misses the overall mark in terms of direction. The story of the Trump admin on immigration &amp; refugee policy is complicated, but it is "can't stop winning" for Miller by any means, although he and his allies dominate internally... https://t.co/fBn2ry6ZIr
The primary issue for DHS is has found there is zero economic argument for rolling back a huge job creator, growth generator, and something that they absolutely lack the ability to claim takes a job (or hurts) an American. They figured this out 8 months ago and got stuck. https://t.co/7TxBimLevS

Anti-immigrant zealots like @kausmickey lie a lot. See how he's talking bout the new cap for 2019? But then he cites 30k for 2003 to show its similar? Well the cap was 70k in 2003.

It is not a surprise, but @kausmickey intentionally forgets (or lies by omission) to explain 2002 and 2003. After 9/11, refugee admissions suspended. The big lesson? It takes a VERY long time to get them back again, even if they're only suspended temporarily. Anyway, liars lie. https://t.co/Jq5gj92v9C
@ferenstein I think this is really just a person who is lying and gets paid a lot of money to mislead people on TV...but I think the dynamic where our republican institutions are pulling away from democratic representation in news ways (or ways not seen in the modern era) is very real.
