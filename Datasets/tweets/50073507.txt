@ForecasterEnten I used this exact reference in the piece. But, also said this: "The difference between Trump, however, and a candidate like Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden is that Trump wasn’t a politician. Perceptions of him were derived from what people saw of him as a TV personality."

@MTPDaily @benensonj In Marquette U. poll of WI Dems in January. Asked Q which of these are acceptable vs. not supporting in 2020.	Biden: 44/16	Bernie: 38/28	In short, in WI, Biden is at +28, while Bernie, who won the Dem. primary there in '16 is at +10 (3)
@MTPDaily @benensonj CNN poll asked Ds and D-leaning indies likely/not likely support if candidate ran in 2020. And, how strongly support/oppose (I put in parentheses)	Biden: 77% /20%  (44%/8%)	Bernie: 65/29 (30%/15%) (2)
On @MTPDaily, frmr Clinton pollster @benensonj makes a point that I"ve noticed in these early polls. Biden/Bernie have equal name ID, but Biden has stronger support from Dems. A couple examples: (1)
of course, Trump likes talking about Bernie. It allows him to talk about 2016 and Hillary. It really is pretty simple. Any chance Trump has to pivot to Hillary and 2016 he takes it.

Gallup data + Des Moines Register poll showing 54/40 that caucusgoers prefer candidate who can beat Trump vs one who shares their positions means we shouldn’t be assume this to be the case. (5)
Rs have felt the rightward pull of their base and assume that Democrats will succumb to similar forces in their own party. It may happen. But... (4)
Understanding this contrast in priorities - Ds want their party to tack more to the center while Rs want to see their party become more conservative - is critical in understanding why Rs are convinced that the Ds will nominate a very liberal candidate in 2020. (3)
Gallup poll found 54% of Ds want to see the party become more moderate, while just 41 percent prefer the party becomes more liberal. Meanwhile, 57% of Rs want to see the GOP to be more conservative, while just 37 percent want the party to moderate. (2)
Re: socialism will kill Dems in 2020. Part of the reason many assume that liberals will take over/derail Dem party/priorities is bc they assume That whatever happened to Rs in last 8 years will simply be replicated by Ds. Here’s why that assumption is faulty. (1)

@mattdole each state's electorate will look different. Plus, assumptions about conservative voters dominating and determining the GOP nominee have been debunked by @henryolsenEPPC and @Graniteprof. they found that in a GOP primary, the ultimate winner is the one who wins moderates
Also, the Dem who is seen by primary voters as "most electable," may or may not be the most moderate. Instead, the Dem w/ the fewest number of obvious political liabilities for Trump to exploit will have the advantage in capturing the nomination. https://t.co/B2GMg69Rd8
GOPers and many D's believe that D's will pick a nominee who's too left to win in '20. But, there's plenty of evidence that D voters aren't looking for the most liberal candidate. And, voters themselves are more ideologically diverse than CW suggests. https://t.co/B2GMg69Rd8

@TimothyHollems True. But a LOT of frosh voted for budget who went on to loose in 1994
Yep. Big difference this time, they had polls on their side and it’s an R POTUS even more unpopular than Obama or Clinton. Other irony, Ryan got Rs in line on Obamacare repeal &amp; taxes - both super unpopular &amp; help cost them the majority. https://t.co/BPDtZg8Ubj

Good rule of thumb in politics: what you know about your caucus and its wants/needs is not transferable to understanding the same about the other party.

In 2017, Trump positioned himself as one man vs the machine of DC. Post tax cuts/Kavanaugh/fed justices he toned down the attacks and aligned himself more w/ the institution. The closer we get to ‘20, the more we should expect POTUS to distance from Congress (see Syria, MBS)

yes. and that's an important thing to remember. However, b/c his base is so narrow, he's going to need to maximize every one of those votes and hope that the opposition is not as (or more) fired up to vote. Remember, less than 80K votes determined Trump's EC win in '16. https://t.co/GgbWuGjqJL

Meanwhile, the Dem base, which wants to see Ds provide a ‘check and balance’ and stand up to Trump, LOVED what they saw from Pelosi yesterday. So, Pelosi/Schumer ‘won’ (4)
The Rs who’d be most invested in avoiding a shutdown - moderates in swing, suburban CDs are all gone. Like, there are literally 3 of them left. So, no pressure from Rs in Congress to avoid shutdown (3)
Trump only cares about his base. They want a wall. They want to ‘shake down’ the Ds. Trump ‘won.’ (2)

All this attention on Pelosi/House RN, but in 2020 it will all be Trump vs. Dem. nominee. The House &amp; Pelosi will be second/third tier focus.
Incumbent Dems who signed "anti-Pelosi" letter sit in safe seats. They seem to be willing to make vulnerable frosh D's in tough CDs take a vote that could doom their chances of re-election. Also, if those vulnerable D's lose in 2020, D's likely lose the House.
In 2013, there were 17 Republicans sitting in CD's carried by Obama. Only 2 remain: Valadao (CA-21) and King (NY-02)	Of 23 original 2016 Clinton/GOP-held CDs: just 3 remain Katko(NY-24), Hurd (TX-23) and Valadao (CA-21).

@davidaxelrod Yep. Very few Rs sat in CDs that Clinton won by 51% or more.
@jpodhoretz Since 2012 Rs have +4 geographic advantage. In other words, to win 50% of the seats, they needed 54% of the vote.
Rs had a huge structural advantage going into 2018. The fact that Ds may net 40 seats is a rout. Period. This argument that it’s not as bad as Obama’s 63 seat loss in 2010 is laughable.
@matthewjdowd For sure. Just picked battleground states.
Best performing Ds this cycle:	1. Sinema (so far): 106% of ‘16 Clinton showing.	2. Beto - 104%	3. Abrams - 104%	4. Wolf (PA)- 100%	5. Whitmer (MI) - 99%

Hey Twitter. Super not interested in the ICYMI tweets from last night that tell me what networks were calling at 10pm.
perhaps a better way of saying this is, projections of a Dem midwest sweep did not materialize (IA, OH stay red). Dam win in WI would be HUGE, but doesn't seem to compare to emotional let down for D's of FL/GA. Also, what's going on in CT? https://t.co/PvSeg6sHXb
If I told you in early 2017 that D's would pick up KS and WI Gov. but fail to pick up VT, MD, NH or MA, you would have thought me crazy.
If Dems were looking for a an obvious frontrunner for 2020 to emerge from 2018 results, well you didn't get one...
The Dem House v. White House situation over the next 2 years is like political nitroglycerine. it's very unstable and could easily blow up in the face of one or both.

State Island (NY-11) and Long Island (NY02), NY01 - all went for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016
It is the "choose your own narrative" election.	D's win House (by  looks like a pretty big margin)	R's on track to pad their SEN majority by 3-4. 	D's win Govs in KS, MI, but fall short in OH and FL. 	Where Trump stumped, R's won (FL, MO, IN)	Trump was toxic in suburbs.
Thus far, Bloomberg Independence Super PAC getting amazing ROI on their investments, especially in once 2nd tier races like IL-14 and OK-05 cc: @howiewolf

In states where Trump IS holding rallies, MT, IN, WV, MO, just 3 R seats are vulnerable. FL energized base can help DeSantis/Scott but not Rs in FL-26 or 27.  (2/2)
The lack of overlap btwn competitive House/SEN campaigns is why the "Trump gets base motivated" is only part of the story. In states where GOP top of ticket is weak and Trump ISN"T going (MI, PA, VA, IL), R's have 17 seats at risk. (1/2)

@CarrollDoherty Yep! When we see ‘movement’ it’s 2-4 pts, not 10
The remarkable thing about Trump's job approval ratings is that they go up when he's NOT the center of attention (I.e., tax cut passage in 2017 and SCOTUS in 2018). When it's about him, his style, his attacks (CVille, Putin-Helsinki, debate over civility and fake news), he drops.

In recent past, members of Congress would try to show their ‘independence ‘ from an unpopular president of their own party by emphasizing how often they disagreed w/ him (1/2)
If you combine GOP proTrump + anti-Pelosi ads, they equal 70% of all ads mentioning Trump and/or Pelosi. So much for all politics is local. (2/2) https://t.co/P1lIPUAFvK

In other words, intensity of support for Trump among R's in handling special counsel is much, much lower than distrust among D's of how Trump handles special counsel.
Pew poll: 37% trust Trump to handle Russia probe "appropriately", 59% don't. Among R's: 74% confident/24% not (34% very confident). Among D's, 9% confident/90% not (72%!!! not at all confident). https://t.co/XN96NEqAO1

On @MeetThePress Sen. Sullivan (R-AK) says Trump has right to fire Sessions, ‘would it be politically wise? I don’t think so.”
Thank you! And thank you for listening. https://t.co/sJ4qNANsmz
Bottom line: exit data suggests Trump has been losing ground w/ white college, suburban types while Pew’s data finds that they’ve been anti-Trump all along..  2/2 https://t.co/wLki7wiCzS

Trump approval among white, non-college evangelical men = 80%		Trump approve among white, non-college NON-evangelical men = 52%		3/3		https://t.co/XpHcKtSBhr
Trump approval among, white non-college evangelical women = 68%		Trump approve among white, non-college NON-evangelical women = 35%	https://t.co/XpHcKtSBhr		2/3
Non-college white voters aren't Trump's base - non-college white EVANGELICAL voters are. 		https://t.co/wLki7wiCzS		1/2

My broader point is this: perhaps the best way to celebrate John McCain’s life is for the media to talk more about John McCain’s life and spend less time on Trump and what he is or isn’t doing to celebrate it.
@svdate Sure. But we know the answer. It’s who he is and how he acts. There is nothing new to report.
@svdate No. This seems very different. It’s basically press corps saying 1) why can’t you be like McCain?	2) let’s follow Trump’s lead on making drama a centerpiece of his presidency.	3) lots of focus on press personal relationships w/ McCain .
The amount of attention national media is paying to Trump snub of McCain is disproportionate by a degree of 10 to amount voters care about this issue.

For so many voters, esp. those who are not paying close attention to politics/policy, what is likely to tip them to Dems/away from Trump/R's - is exhaustion. They simply become tired of the constant chaos.
Even before #Helsinki, voters rather ambivalent on issue of Russia interference. PRRI/Atlantic poll, just 45% see foreign interference "major problem"in American electoral system, including just 40% of I"s and 22% of R's.		https://t.co/io4wC6mBDL

My point is that even if you think Russian interference did not tip Election to Trump, you can say that it was really bad and a really big deal and not downplay it as ‘whatever-everyone does it’ https://t.co/OyvoEyugDq
You can hold all 3 of these as true at same time: Russia hacked &amp; undermined our faith in process/institutions; it’s a big deal &amp; bad; it’s not why Trump won.
My neck is still sore from whiplash in watching Rs who attacked Obama as ‘leading from behind’ and not being tough enough on our enemies, now bend over backward to rationalize Russian election interference as no big deal.

Using my calculation of gender gap (% of women &amp; % of men who vote for winning candidate/party), no party has had gender gap above +8. Latest Q poll is +16.
@posglen so, this is how i calculated (as CAWP does): what percent of women/men vote did winning party get. so for example, in '10, R's got 57% of men, 49% of women = +8 gender gap	In '06, D's won 50% of men, 55% of women = +5 gap.
@karentravers @matthewbjaffe That is your choice , Karen. BUT, it does mean no complaints when wind chill cuts you in half.

@CramersShirt correct. they voted against 'a' bill. but, the point is, that this bill didn't lose because D's sank it.

D’s have 5 pt enthusiasm advantage in latest @pewresearch poll on 2018 election. But, back in June 2006, it was 17 pts. Ds 8 pts more motivated now than in ‘06, but Rs more motivated by 20 pts! https://t.co/0xbdTB9umH
@DCGeyer yes, i wrote that. it's at the end of the column
R's have geographic advantage that gives them about +4 more seats than raw vote. Which is why Trump at 45% is different than Obama at 45%. Also, there were more vulnerable R-leaning seats up those years than vulnerable, D-leaning seats up in 2018. https://t.co/hn0TV3scvZ
Earlier this cycle, lots of R's worried that 2018 would be a 2006 redux when R's got clobbered. At this point, however, POTUS approve, unity of R base, GOP enthusiasm to vote, all better today than they were  6/06.	 https://t.co/0xbdTBr5Lh

@FOhioman yep. those entering legally is also same story. these are folks who want a better life for their families, but they also help change the demographics of US so that it no longer looks same as it did decades previous.
At its core, immigration is a cultural definition of the American Dream.  For many, the dream is for their kids to have a childhood like theirs. For others, it's that their kids can have a childhood that's not anything like theirs - a childhood they didn't have.
I heard this same analysis from a GOP strategist who said the danger of the family separation was that it was melding Trump personality w/ policy and performance. Can't separate the two like you can with so much else that goes on w/ WH and policy https://t.co/qwZZ7rvZmQ

I’d also add that part of the reason that Trump’s immigration message resonated so well in 2016 w/ Rs is because of Rs reaction to these 2013/2014 stories https://t.co/RFUmzdR9xo
But also Steve Stivers who is head of NRCC https://t.co/ckwqdeJBnh
As more negative feedback and backlash from R's on children at the border, I expect that Nielsen will ultimately get thrown under the bus by Trump.

@brithume And, I do think that every election, Congress convinces people that the place is a dysfunctional hellhole which has  helped our two most recent POTUS’ to walk all over them or go around them
@brithume Perhaps. I guess my broader point is this: at some point there may be something that majority of members - D and R - disagree w/ POTUS. But, will there protests impact either POTUS behavior or voter perceptions?
Yep. AA concourse in MIA is great. Please take note ORD and IAD! https://t.co/dfM4RSgnxG
@lrozen True. But I’m thinking on more parochial stuff - like defending the interests of their states or CDs. Like the Corker amendment that would limit POTUS power on trade - something that impacts their voters very directly
@gnightBrian Yep. That’s exactly my point. Congress has so debased their own profession that even they can’t defend it
@owillis Nope. It’s on the stuff that impacts their own state or constituents. Like trade and tariffs. Normally, that’s something people expect their MoC to do, esp if you live in a state / CD w/ big AG interests. Instead, response is - we trust he’ll do it right
@aaronbrown1110 @Applan69 of course. and that is true too. But, when they don't, they should be able to say that too.
And, here we are. Members of Congress willing to cut out their own branch of government on reining in the executive branch because just about everyone - themselves included - don't think they are capable of doing anything constructive. Fin. (5)
Voters believe this too since politicians have been telling them for years how incompetent Congress is. So, in comes a POTUS who says, "these guys suck, trust me to fix it." And, voila, voters say "well, of course. And, Congress, you stay out of the way and don't mess it up." (4)
Moreover, and I make this point a lot, candidates have been running for years with the message that Congress is broken and stupid. And, then, in comes a POTUS, who isn't from politics and says "yep, they are." (3)
Most of these members - esp. on GOP side - have been elected since 2010. They ran as anti-establishment, anti-Washington. They see themselves as individuals - not members of "Team America." (2)
Why aren't GOPers pushing back on Trump? Is it all a cult thing? A don't "poke the bear" thing? Yes, both play a part. But, the bigger reason is that Congress has absolutely no idea how to play its constitutional role (1)
do we think that it will really get WH blessing? https://t.co/K9hQ5psgfL

@HotlineJosh I have a different view. A generic of R+1 in a CD that has a PVI of R +7 and where Culberson took 56% is actually bad for Rs. And, this is a CD where good economy should be helping push up that R number. It also suggests a generic of D +6-7 nationally
My takeaway from my 1st @TheTakeaway Friday show: we got great perspective from women candidates, a US SEN, historians and actors who stared in off-Broadway show where a woman played Trump &amp; a man played Hillary. Check it out. https://t.co/P3o8KXkU20

My view is a bit different this morning https://t.co/ZTJNe760Hq
Good analysis here. But 2016 also saw biggest gap between Nat’l poll error and state poll error (2.1%). If I had lots of $$ - I’d hire best pollsters to go into states more often. Less Nat’l - more local. https://t.co/p8EleY6Ry1

@TerryMoran Right. And that’s the point. The tough talk keeps his populist/nationalist base happy, while lack of trade war keeps free market wing of GOP happy.

Part of the reason for R's increased enthusiasm &amp; Trump job approve is that focus has been off of legislative failures/divisions, &amp; instead on economy &amp; foreign policy. (3)
Now it seems that R's in Congress are doing a good job undercutting themselves - whether on farm bill or immigration. (2)
I'm old enough to remember when GOP legislative types were worried that their best-laid plans to just talk taxes and economy for '18 would be undercut by Trump distractions. (1)

Here's what to watch as we head into last 5.5 months of midterms: 1) Trump's current job approve by CD/State not his '16 performance there; 2) how independents break; 3) Does GOP stay united/optimistic; 4) Focus on vote share not margin. https://t.co/7Kzfxw65UN
Agree. First the pleats, then the perms, then acid wash...it’s a slippery slope https://t.co/lAHX1bUYhq
A Dem pollster told me. "If we are debating health care in 2018, we are winning." House Rs have to defend unpopular repeal vote. https://t.co/u4qxkyi9j6
And 83% of them are men https://t.co/CtCOln5xKl
That's when you will get into ideological/tactical fights. And, a potential leadership fight as well. (5)	--Fin --
But, beating R's is what truly unites Dems. There won't be a drop-off in turn-out among Ds because the "right" candidate didn't make it thru the primary. They will show up. The problem is what happens if/when these candidates get to DC? (4)
I think the biggest challenge for D's in '18 isn't about ideology, but about rookie-ness. So many of these Dem. nominees are first-time candidates who haven't been truly vetted in way that a sitting elected official has been. (3)
First, I think that being a woman and not being a former member of Congress was very helpful to Eastman. Second, if you noticed, another ex-Rep (Hoeffel) and would-be Rep.  (Saccone), lost their primaries yesterday. Voters like new, fresh faces. (2)
So, I'll admit to not being totally plugged into all the nuances of NE-02, but I think we need to be careful about over-stating this whole "progressive vs. moderate" fight w/in the Dem party. (1)

@BowTiePolitics We need a nice NC college to do some NC CD polling ;)
@jpodhoretz And there’s the rub. Very little public polling. But it’s also the reason that House strategists - both R and D - are talking wave. They see the data we don’t
We made a mistake in ‘16 by focusing too much on Nat’l polls and not enough on states. I worry we may be doing same now. In midterm, CD-level polls much more important than Nat’l generic or Trump job approve.
The more media focused on Stormy et al, the more that: 1) Rs rally around POTUS, 2) issues Ds want/need to talk about like health care, can’t break thru.
Which is why, I think, his approval ratings among Rs has risen in last 2 months. Q now is if Rs can match D intensity &amp; if indies continue to spur on Trump/Rs. https://t.co/cf3J7sDFKB

@SeanTrende I also think that voters are so polarized that they’ve ‘come home’ earlier than normal. That means that you make some assumptions about indies/soft party ID. They break later and given Trump job approve among I’s and soft Ds, its likely final margin is larger than now
@SeanTrende Perhaps b/c it’s April. But really I think it’s b/c we are looking at margin instead of total vote. Look at % that say they will vote for R and those that’ll vote D. Then ask if either is a ceiling.

@SeanTrende @henryolsenEPPC Trump approval ratings are at once volatile and totally stable. We will see a trend (up or down) for a couple weeks, before a drop or rise. Meanwhile, his job approve has been pretty steady his entire presidency - between 38-43%
@perrybaconjr Right. But we also know that 45% of Americans ‘strongly ‘ disapprove of POTUS. That means there’s a MUCH bigger audience for anything that smacks of bad for Trump than almost anything else

The "NRA doesn't have power over me, they have power over you," is perfect distillation of Trump's appeal in 2016. He's a free agent, an outsider who could reshape outdated political alliances. Thus far, however, he's failed to deliver on this potential.
Trump ran on his ability to 'negotiate" and change the way politics is done. He's doing that w/ DACA/Guns 'open press' congressional sessions. However, as we saw w/ DACA, it doesn't translate to actual legislation.

@jonallendc @lynnsweet all true. and fair. but, I do wonder what precedent this sets for other D's who fall out of favor w/ party-line on ideology.
@jonallendc @lynnsweet yes. but there are a lot of incumbents who are delinquent and/or unhelpful to DCCC who still get DCCC $$. Heck, Connor Lamb just said he won't vote for Pelosi, the PARTY LEADER, and he got $$$.
@JakeSherman Yes. and the committees support lots of incumbents who are delinquent dues payers/fundraisers.
In other words, it will be more remarkable if D's refuse to endorse or support a moderate/conservative D in a conservative CD where a more progressive candidate CAN'T win. However, they've set a precedent that is going to be tough to unravel and nuance going forward.
In that sense, it is very different from say, not supporting a pro-life, pro-gun candidate in western PA or rural GA.
However, it's not one of these CD's like say, a southern or midwestern rural CD where the Dem NEEDS to be more culturally or politically moderate/conservative
This CD is also the 'least' Dem of Chicago-based districts at D+6 (others have D+18-D+38).
Few thoughts on DCCC's non-endorsement of Lipinski in IL-03: it is remarkable given that the SOLE job of party committee is to protect incumbents. (1)

Trump often talks moderate (DACA, healthcare), but when rubber meets road, he comes out for the most conservative option. Hard to believe he'll go center on guns.

Given Trump says he's willing to shut down gov't over immigration, isn't it worth D's asking if he's willing to tell McConnell/Ryan to put WH plan on the floor? Would R's even get a majority of R's to support it in House?
@HotlineJosh well, I wish Gallup had congessional ballot question. But, other polls have shown uptick in indies and more soft R's on congressional ballot

@HotlineJosh right. but overall approval only up 3. In fact, just quick read through of this finds biggest drop in on disapprove but not much movement on approval For example, Trump strong approve goes 22% to 25%. But, strong disapprove drops 7pts 46% to 39%
@HotlineJosh well, the overall trend is pretty stable. R's on generic go from 37 in Dec to 40% in Jan. Real Q is if this is GOP ceiling esp. if Trump remains at 38-41 approval.

Now, Trump/Bannon are fighting over ownership of this same group of voters. Yet, these voters aren't attracted to personality 	 - it's disruption they want. So, disruption will continue, w/ or w/out Bannon/Breitbart/Mercer etc.
@conncarroll sorry i'm trying to lean how to thread twets and i'm stinking at it. Will try again
By '16, these voters were now called "Trump's base" but they were still driven more by anger &amp; desire for disruption than by anything else. Bannon fed them this daily. But, like Boehner, he can't "control" them. https://t.co/jdpzdaMxeK
