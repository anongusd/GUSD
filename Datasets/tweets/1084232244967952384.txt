@FiveRights Sad really. You will all find out in time how you were DECEIVED by a con man. Do you really think that he gives a s#it about you?  Wake up! He's a narcissist.  They are inherently incapable of compassion, kindness, empathy, etc.
@FiveRights Both foreign and domestic. 	The only logical explanation for anyone still supporting this a*shole would be either one is ignorant and extremely gullible or perhaps your views align with his?? 	 	 ~Peace~
@FiveRights Racist, bigot, PEDOPHILE ,criminal  that launders money for foreign countries that are our adversaries!?? 	His GREED. ARROGANCE  and lack of any	 morals or character will SHORTLY be his DOWNFALL. History will NOT be kind to Trump. 	Face it. Trump brought the swamp and terrorists.
@FiveRights He is dividing our country, destroying our Constitution and praises dictators  (ie. Putin,  Kim Yon Ung). Takes their word over our intelligence agencies. You are being deceived, sir. Riddle me this... What American Patriot would support a president that is a,pathological liar,
@FiveRights We find out more everyday just how corrupt he and his family are. The hard evidence against them is starting to come to light.	You do know that there's  PROOF of his ties to Putin and the Russian Mob going back to 1980, right?
@FiveRights With due respect sir, are you not aware that the GOP is compromised and complicit.  Certain individuals have received  $millions from foreign countries.  Such as Senator Lindsey Graham who was a harsh Trump critic. Until he received $800,000. Dirty. Russian. Money.

@real_farmacist Awesome! Thank you.
@RepAdamSchiff @TeamPelosi @RalphNaderUSA	@SenSchumer @RepCummings	Thank you for standing up to this narcissistic, sociopathic pathological liar. He doesn't care about how the #TrumpShutdown is destroying lives. He's a threat to America, our citizens and all that those before us fought for. https://t.co/ObowEG8caS
"When the country lets freedom ring, all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual: 'Free at last! Free at Last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at	last."
