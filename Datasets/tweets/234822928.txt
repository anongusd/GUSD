Whether it is lowering healthcare costs, strengthening American infrastructure, or even securing our borders, there is opportunity to work together if Democrats are willing.
Having worked with the previous Republican Congress to achieve this, the President is right in calling on Democratic leaders to end their impulsive resistance to working with Republicans.
Over the past two years, we have seen incredible job growth and a strong economy fueled by tax cuts for all Americans and regulatory relief for the private sector...
Tonight, the President offered an optimistic vision of how we can work together to tackle important issues in a bipartisan manner--if all parties can agree to come to the table...

Thanks to @SteveScalise for your support of #ReducingRegBurdens! It's costing $50 million a year to comply with this duplicative regulation
Thank you @RepTedYoho for supporting my bill HR 953 #ReducingRegBurdens to get rid of duplicative EPA permitting process for pesticides.
There's bipartisan support for a commonsense regulatory reform bill that protects public health and cut red tape! #ReducingRegBurdens
EPA red tape is a barrier to public health. We can stop diseases like West Nile &amp; Zika before they become a crisis. #ReducingRegBurdens
2009 letter from Obama Ag Sec Vilsack: Court decision encumbers American farmers ability to do business w no environmental benefit.
EPA estimates the unnecessary #NPDES permit costs $50 million in compliance every year. #ReducingRegBurdens
Why wait until a public emergency? #ReducingRegBurdens eliminates unnecessary red tape so cities &amp; states can act now on mosquitos.
For years, EPA appropriately regulated pesticide use under #FIFRA. 6th Circuit Court decision creates burdensome double permitting process
We're about to start debate on my bill, HR 953 Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. You can watch on @cspan

EPA is setting itself up as the ultimate manager of land use and economic development in the nation. http://t.co/jEEbcbKKHl
Its unfortunate that the Agencies have taken a closed door approach to this rule making instead of engaging in a proper, transparent process
The bill aims to get the Agencies to sit down &amp; consult w/ the States &amp; local gov as co-regulators in the Fed-State partnership under #CWA
This rule will undermine the Federal-State partnership that has long existed under the Clean Water Act.
Now marking up H.R. 5078, " The Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014"
This bill returns the balance, certainty and cooperation between the States and the Federal government.
EPA has begun to use questionable tactics to usurp the States' role under the #CWA
Now marking up H.R.5077, "The Coal Jobs Protection Act of 2014."
This bill aims to preserve the certainty and finality of the #CWA Section 404 permit process and provide fairness to the regulated community
This is an example of government that thinks it's has no limitations on it's power and is willing to abuse it.
Revoking a permit or trying to block a party from being able to apply for a permit as EPA has done is unsettling  and simply unfair.
