Thank you to all of those who participated in today’s lively #HPVChat.
Researchers: new funding announcements available from @theNCI just last week about promoting #HPV vaccine https://t.co/irUIv1t3LG  #HPVChat
If the U.S. moves to a 2 dose recommendation, will be easier for busy parents &amp; kids to make 2 appointments instead of 3  #HPVChat
@theNCI is funding new research on both 2 and even 1-dose approaches. Those results will take a number of years #HPVChat
(3/3) @CDC_Gov Prevention Advisory Committee is considering if those data support changing the US recommendation to two doses #HPVChat
(2/3) @CDC_Gov and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices the group that sets vaccine dosing for the U.S. #HPVChat
(1/3) In the U.S., the recommendation is for boys and girls to receive three doses. @US_FDA is first reviewing that data #HPVChat
You can read more about the 2016 consensus statement from the 69 NCI-designated Cancer Centers here: https://t.co/f7FZnAmC8R  #HPVChat
(1/2) In 2016, all 69 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers agreed that low rates of HPV vaccination is “a serious public health threat” #HPVChat
Q7: The vaccine protects against several strains of #HPV &amp; even sexually active young women might still get needed protection. #HPVChat
Q7: Yes. Always better to vaccinate. The vaccine is approved as early as age 9 and, for girls, all the way to age 27. #HPVChat
Well put, @ChildrensMercy! #HPVChat
A6: Only if the parent brings up sex, reassure that studies show that HPV-vaccinated children DO NOT have sex earlier or more. #HPVChat
A6: If parents have questions, doctors can reassure that the vaccine has been used for more than 10 yrs &amp; is safe and effective. #HPVChat
A6: I think that doctors can say it’s time for the child’s vaccines, and include #HPV without any discussion.  #HPVChat
A6: Most parents take their doctor’s recommendation to get the HPV vaccine, so the first thing is to give a strong recommendation. #HPVChat
.@CarrascalAlvaro True.  Let's not forget the doctors who tell the parents and kids which vaccines are needed #HPVChat
.@ChildrensMercy Agreed.  Just like you can't wait to have a car crash then try and put on your seat belt. #HPVChat
Go, @btrfly12!  Tell all of your friends!  We want to wipe out HPV-related cancers RIGHT NOW. #HPVChat
Here is some reliable, science-based information that might help, @HealthnutFoodie. #HPVChat
Great point, @annie_oliver.  It's so important to vaccinate BOTH boys and girls #hpvchat
A2: Here’s some additional information about cervical cancer screening and #HPV: https://t.co/bfPsEtLSTW #HPVChat
A2: These tests are recommended at different times and frequency in a woman’s life depending on her age and other factors #HPVChat
A2: Only cervical cancer has recommended screening tests; the Pap test and HPV test.  More info here: https://t.co/e3aQBDUB7F #HPVChat
.@tphammd Glad you brought that up.  Vaccine is most effective in people before they are sexually active #HPVChat
RT @NCICancerStats: Here's our video on the Human Papillomavirus: https://t.co/A4qE3u3SRl #HPVchat
A1: (2/2) For men, almost all of anal cancer is caused by #HPV, half of penile and 70% of oropharynx #HPVChat
A1: (1/2) For MEN #HPV can cause penile, anal, and oropharynx cancers. Here’s some additional information: https://t.co/EdHr4AEceX #HPVChat
A1: (2/2) And all cervical is caused by #HPV, most of anal, 70% of oropharynx, and half of both vaginal and vulvar #HPVChat
