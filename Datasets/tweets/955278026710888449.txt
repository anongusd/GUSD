@TruthHurts_s @KamalaHarris Silly tweet. Dumb stereotypes. I don’t believe in any of those things. The demonizing of people who have competing ideas is why your party keeps losing.

@JoeBalarezo @Haroldj111 @JujunluluJudy @NickMerrill @bannerite It’s not the same thing. You’re confused. It’s not about using personal email. It’s about using it to transmit classified material, which the FBI found that Clinton and her staff did.

@KaseKubrick @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports You don’t understand.

It’s been a struggle to hold America to these ideals, but that’s what civil rights leaders demanded; that we live up to that promise. We all want the same things.
@KaseKubrick @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports You &amp; I very likely want the same outcomes. We also disagree on how to achieve them.

@degen_erate @krillyourtidal @Math_Mama_G @GManfan64 @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports Telling kids they are victims is incredibly destructive on many levels. Nothing will improve if that’s how we’re dealing with socio-economic issues in our country.

@krillyourtidal @Math_Mama_G @degen_erate @GManfan64 @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports I’m not mad. I just don’t care what you think. I know who I am. My character and how I’ve treated others speaks for itself. Have a nice day.

@McQuanto714 @Math_Mama_G @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports What I want is for everyone to be treated equally and to have an opportunity to succeed and reach their potential. We’re probably going to disagree on how best to achieve that.
@McQuanto714 @Math_Mama_G @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports So I have to agree with you or I’m a bad person?  That’s not how this works. Sorry.
@degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports There is a connection, but my belief is that it’s a cultural of lawlessness that creates conditions that lead to poverty. Those who fly right can lift themselves up.

@Math_Mama_G @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports Okay, well alienating all of law enforcement isn’t going to help. Police have to be part of the solution. A starting place should be acknowledging that law enforcement isn’t the enemy.

@degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports My mother grew up in abject poverty with an alcohol father. To my knowledge, she’s never broken the law.

@Math_Mama_G @degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports That’s true, but no organization can purge all bad apples. Their responsibility is to hold officers accountable if they break the law or violate policy, and in most of the cases that I’m aware of there has been robust investigations. Not always the outcome that some prefer.
@degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports People have to take responsibility for their own lives.

@degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports I would also say that discrimination is clearly not the only reason so many African Americans go to jail. There’s a cultural problem in urban America.

@degen_erate @GManfan64 @krillyourtidal @DaPet8 @shootfirehotrod @ByRosenberg @TBlountSports Maybe, but our nation isn’t to blame for that. Individuals are.

@SplAdamSage @yashar More demonizing from the left. That’s all you hateful people can do.
@yashar As usual, nutty Democrats trying to demonize a Republican and painting them as bigoted. Character assassination. What the hell does this have to do with being Secretary of State?
@disastrmaster @washingtonpost Another enraged leftist who flips out when someone says something they don’t like. Have you started any riots today?
@disastrmaster @washingtonpost Real person. You’re a paranoid leftist. Is calling someone a bot your pathetic way of trying to discredit someone?
@NydiaVelazquez @HouseGOP Lol. A Democrat talking about fiscal responsibility. Do you really think Americans are that stupid?
@EasyMode243 @washingtonpost You’re a liar.
@washingtonpost And why shouldn’t he be? The left was (is) fixated on perpetuating the lies and trying to bring down his Presidency.
@newrepublic Protect him? They should be passing legislation that reigns him in and limits his investigation to Russian interference in the election.

@MsG26254479 @JP07goUSA @rkari71 @Crossland23 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Is linking someone’s opinion to Fox your way of trying to discredit them or something? Odd.
@MsG26254479 @JP07goUSA @rkari71 @Crossland23 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Lol. The left’s obsession with FoxNews is inexplicable.

@MsG26254479 @JP07goUSA @rkari71 @Crossland23 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Teachers like you teach liberalism as unquestionable fact. You don’t teach, you indoctrinate. It’s rooted in arrogance. The goal should be kids who can think for themselves.

@jrodin915 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity Real person. Paranoia is an ugly thing.
@swacman1 @rnickerson443 @oliverg2014 @foreverracin @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity Keep insulting Americans. It will ensure that your party remains in the minority indefinitely.  Btw, your party wants to raise taxes on middle class Americans

@Koop001 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity I’m pretty sure I need to do the opposite of what any liberal tells me to do. Typical comment, btw. The arrogant assumption that conservatives can’t think for themselves
@rnickerson443 @NYCInwoodNative @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity Typical leftist who has contempt for the American people.
@Ondrya3 @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity What’s your point? That if a President says things that his critics think are inappropriate that a journalist has the right to be unprofessional? That’s ludicrous
@latyalor @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity There were many times when President Obama said dumb things, and things that were clearly false. I didn’t see CNN reporters screaming questions at him. They are left wing activists
@latyalor @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity So because the President isn’t articulate, that means Acosta has the right to be a jerk?  He’s an embarrassment to CNN.
@NYCInwoodNative @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity #Unhinged
@NYCInwoodNative @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity He’s the democratically ejected President of our country. If you’re an American, he’s your President too, regardless of your inability to accept that your candidate was rejected.
@blue_coming @rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity Everyone else had the good sense not to harass the President at this event. Acosta is a terrible human being.

@MarkBardell1 @seanhannity @trumps_feed Loaded, gotcha questions are not objective. Liberals are so arrogant that they believe only liberalism is objective.

@Acosta Huh? You’re confused. Your job is to report on stories from the White House, not to be an advocate for liberal causes and an anti-Trump activist. Go back to J-school.

@rnickerson443 @NYCArtistRoseMS @seanhannity I would add that it’s infinitely more important to be a good person than to get the story that you want to get.
