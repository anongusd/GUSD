If you live in a Blue state and want trump. vote for @HowardSchultz if you are truly independent he is a candidate that brings something to the table. Best he wins and we have something new. If your #maga trump wins. Dems lose. I see no down side to this. inb4 #imanidiot
Is the hate for @HowardSchultz that he would just reelect trump or is this because he could win not as a DEM? I live in WA so a vote for trump would not matter. My vote for Howard could count. Either I get 4 more years of trump OR something new. I honestly don't see the downside.

@RealSaavedra all i see is a bunch of Americans exercising their right to peaceably assemble. no violence no arrests. This is what America is suppose to be. disagree but dont fight about it. We all have the right to our opinions. I have to say props to both sides for keeping this peaceful.
@TitaniaMcGrath the human race would be eliminated in 4 or 5 generations. 5/10 not your best work.
@RealSaavedra I'm still wanting to see that @realDonaldTrump is going to interfere with the investigation. It has been going on for almost 2 years. don't you think that if any interference was going to happen it would have happened by now? I think trump has done everything to let it conclude.

no electoral college and people like @officialmcafee @BernieSanders and other independent candidates and other parties would have a chance. The people would REALLY be represented instead of just by the right and the left. There are millions of Americans that exist in the middle
reminds me of what happened to HW Bush. When so many people took votes from him and gave them to H Ross Perot. @BernieSanders would have done the same to @HillaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump would have still won. Republicans were united behind trump. Dems didn't have a good horse

@mysayjp @TomiLahren the DOW has also been higher than it has ever been so of course the biggest drops have happened in that time. Why not talk about percentages vs points. Monday was a 4.6% drop.

@mysayjp @TomiLahren the DOW  closed at 19,827 jan 20, 2017 the day trump took office. The DOW closed today at 24,431 up 5000 points from time he took office.  I am not sure what you are saying. still up from the time he took office. keep up your narrative without looking at the bigger picture.

@Belle__Bermudez @TLDR99 @UncleLevon @BradThor @benshapiro I know why they are coming	 Most of the migrants i have spoken to in my many years on earth say it's the difference of 10 dollars a day and 10 dollars an hour. They all want to come here to help make America greater than it already is. Not to be thugs. I fault non of them for it.
@Belle__Bermudez @TLDR99 @UncleLevon @BradThor @benshapiro Ok so by your response that tells me you came illegally. I don't care i am just trying to undertand your position. From what james has said he came here legally. So you 2 come from diffirent positions. Just trying to better understand both sides of the argument that is all.
@Belle__Bermudez @TLDR99 @UncleLevon @BradThor @benshapiro Did you come illegally? Did you follow the proper process? I have known many migrants that came here both ways all wanted a better life. Most were productive members of society some where criminals. I personally prefer they follow the proper process. Curious the way U came here.

You raised enough money to run for Congress i am sure you could raise the money to live with the rich people that you really support. Don't piss down my back and tell me its raining.
I couldnt live in DC so dont make this out like i dont care about working class people. You come off as the one who doesnt care for those people. Hell take a payday loan. I am sure you cold find a bank or a supporter willing to loan you 10k till you get your 14k a month salary.
You know all the staff that will work for you and clean up after you. The people that make the capitol look nice. The people that prepare your food in the cafeteria. The person that busses the tables at the resturants you eat at. Where do they live?
@Ocasio2018 really if you can't afford to live in DC for the next 3 month live in Baltimore where do you think all the working class janitors and cooks and landscapeing professionals live? They commute. You honestly never planned for this? Sure glad or reps can plan ahead.

Its pretty well documented. You can also lie about it as well, as long as white conservative males suffer.
14k a month and you cant afford housing? I bet there are people in DC that don't make that in a year. #hypocrite diversity is our strength isn't that what the democrats say? well i guess you only want to live with the rich people. hows that diverse?
@Ocasio2018 https://t.co/Nynt0oe66E here is a 4 bedroom for 990 a month i am pretty sure you can afford that on your 174K a year you get as a representative. how about his 1 bedroom https://t.co/27Ja5Weu1T 1430 a month i am sure you can afford that.
@Ocasio2018 DC is one of the poorest places in all of America. You cant find housing?You say that you ran to speak for the common people.There is tons of affordable housing you just want to live with the rich white people.why not live with the people you say you want to represent

@p0wer2pe0ple last. i think cops see blacks as the statistics and treat them as such. Cops also only deal with bad people all day long. bad people of all colors. I think they go into all situations thinking your a bad person because the majority of the people they deal with are bad people.
@p0wer2pe0ple sorry if my thread is all over the place i should have numbered it :p
@keithboykin @p0wer2pe0ple @realDonaldTrump In Latin America that is a lot of money in America that is a lot of money. I do feel that immigration policy needs a real overhaul. yes there are some"bad Hombres"in that group but really we could vet all these people and do it easily and not cost them 10k. to weed out the bad 1s
@keithboykin @p0wer2pe0ple I do know many Latinos and i know why this caravan is really coming and it isnt to sell drugs and rape and murder. @realDonaldTrump  wants to #maga and you know what. most of these Latinos want to help do that. its 10k per head to immigrate legally.
@p0wer2pe0ple holy fuck sorry for all the words lol. i am always open to being wrong. if i am please show me where i am wrong so i can better no the truth as to others see it not just what i have learned in my life.
@p0wer2pe0ple my head and i really dont know. Is it tv, is it music is it society? fuck i dont know. i am really rambling now. If you have an suggestions i would like to hear because i kind of feel like i am in an ivory tower now and i dont want to be. does that make sense?
@p0wer2pe0ple I always wondered where that came from. i didnt learn it in school i may have gotten some from my parents and i am really trying to see the world different than i have in the past. I also catch myself saying things that i know are wrong but i wonder why that thought came into
@p0wer2pe0ple why are the statistics the way they are. i dont know the answer. I would also say systemic racism is a thing. not that the system is purposely that way but when you look at the bigger picture of this country i can see it there., I know that i feel those racist tendencies
@p0wer2pe0ple maybe we need better role models for people in the lower income range and the fatherless children to give them hope that tomorrow will be better than today. We all should be willing to help give a hand up not a hand out. now i am rambling. I would like to here you opinion.
@p0wer2pe0ple in the prison system so that they states can use that labor for their own benefit. I may be rambling now. i feel like it. I think when you have no opportunity you are more likely to do things like join a gang or cook meth for instance. That may also all you know to do.
@p0wer2pe0ple I am honestly not sure the best solution. I do feel that the welfare state seems to want to keep people down instead of not being in that system. I could also see what @ye was saying about the 13th amendment and how being in prison can be legal slavery. why not keep more people
@p0wer2pe0ple would this mean that we need more opportunity for people who are poor to get out of the situation they are in? as habitat for humanity would say. a hand up not a hand out. more jobs. Also would this be more about fatherless children? i know that is an issue regardless of race.
@p0wer2pe0ple I am not sure the point you are trying to make. I am not trying to be dumb but maybe I am. from what i am getting intraracial is more of an issue that inter racial. black on black white on white. I also see that they talk about poor vs not poor. and poor people commit more crime.
@mitchellvii I'm an independent. When I have to choose I almost always take the Republican. When it comes to politics I will stay with the devil I know than that one that is pretending to be something they are not. They both want to want my money at least the Republicans are upfront about it.
