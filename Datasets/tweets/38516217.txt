When was the last time you went to a national park site near you and just enjoyed some time in the outdoors? Well, don't wait any longer! Listen in on Randy Thoreson from @NatlParkService to get some tips and inspiration. 	https://t.co/BIcgFu96Fn
.@SecretaryZinke is reducing comment periods and discounting petitions. Here's five reasons why it's still important for park advocates to keep showing up and raising our voices online: https://t.co/Km2uPw637n https://t.co/WYpJetchz6
“We will continue to work to protect the law that provides millions of people the opportunity to learn from and experience these amazing places.” 	https://t.co/wP7T0SEOZv
“It is ironic that this administration would use the same law to protect this site after arbitrarily gutting protections for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments.”	https://t.co/wP7T0SEOZv
Breaking: Yesterday, POTUS designated #CampNelson NHL as a national monument. As one of the largest Civil War recruitment &amp; training depots for U.S. Colored Troops, it was a place where thousands risked their lives in pursuit of freedom. #MonumentsForAll 	https://t.co/wP7T0SEOZv
It's not your imagination; @SecretaryZinke and the Trump Administration are going to great lengths to limit public input on decisions they make about public lands. https://t.co/PPGpKiYHM4
The environment wins when countries work together to preserve it. A partnership between Ontario &amp; Michigan to restore wolves at Isle Royale NP demonstrates "...a proud tradition of working together to conserve our natural ecosystems." #WolfAwarenessWeek 	https://t.co/wXuWAUg7Xc https://t.co/IKcqtDSMAO
Safe...for now. The administration hit "pause" on selling nearly one million acres of public lands for oil and gas development in CO, UT and WY. But will these wildlife-rich lands near parks remain protected? #SpOILedParks  https://t.co/08kimRYuZe https://t.co/btqwYNigLq
With its namesake glaciers rapidly melting, @GlacierNPS is a place where visitors can visibly see the effects climate change is having on the natural world. We recommend @SecretaryZinke prioritize climate science in the management of our #nationalparks.	https://t.co/3Yj7JPawsV

The 1st round of wolves are running free on their new home at Isle Royale! So what happens next? The final step in the relocation is careful monitoring of the released animals. The cycle will start again with phase 2 in 2019. #WolfWatch #WolfAwarenessWeek 	https://t.co/Ho7vB5UKrX https://t.co/oo5VPI180s
The administration is going to extremes to limit public input on decisions about public lands. Seem backwards to you? It sure does to us. https://t.co/PPGpKiYHM4

3) BYOB (Bring Your Own Bottle): Bring a refillable water bottle or buy one at the souvenir shop, while taking advantage of convenient water refilling stations located throughout the parks.
2) Mug for the Parks: Bring a reusable coffee mug or buy one from the souvenir shop to help reduce waste at parks.

.@NPCA staff explain how they work with landowners, land managers, park staff, transportation departments and conservation partners to identify barriers and make passage for wildlife in and out of national park borders safer. https://t.co/rhP3J1dejA https://t.co/4P0Ht3p6KP
TONIGHT in Nashville, @NPCA and @naturevalley will be discussing wildlife connectivity in our national parks. Come hear about new efforts to promote safe travel for national park wildlife that cross park borders. https://t.co/weWTW85Ghf
In 2017, @DenaliNPS, @GrandTetonNPS and @YosemiteNPS and their concessioners collectively generated 13 million pounds of visitor waste in 2017 – of which more than 4 million pounds or almost 33 % was reused, recycled, composted or otherwise not sent to landfills. https://t.co/KQxobhWT5w
From @steamtownnhs to @INDEPENDENCENHP, Pennsylvania’s 19 #nationalparks saw 10.5M visitors last year. But nearly $299M in needed repairs threatens the ability to preserve and interpret the history at these sites. #FixOurParks https://t.co/ry0r2PrIjn
New signs and containers @DenaliNPS, @GrandTetonNPS, @YosemiteNPS help guide visitors through the easy process of sorting recycling, composting and trash. YOU can have a BIG impact on reducing waste at our parks. #recycle #dontfeedthelandfills @RecycleAcrossAm https://t.co/Wp7HV3Re9y

Roosevelt used the Antiquities Act to protect @GrandCanyonNPS from mining, but @SecretaryZinke removed protections from Bears Ears Nat'l Monument, opening it to oil &amp; gas development. Bears Ears was originally protected by @BarackObama under the Antiquities Act #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/frGpnS2ZwR

Teddy signed the Antiquities Act into law. It has been used to create nearly 25% of existing @NatlParkService sites, as well as protected waters. @SecretaryZinke recently proposed opening the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts to offshore oil and gas exploration. #ProtectOurCoasts https://t.co/7IYYu2ARMb
Roosevelt believed the federal government was responsible for protecting our natural resources, open spaces and communities. Throughout regulatory rollbacks, @SecretaryZinke has prioritized special interests over these long-held responsibilities. #ProtectOurCoasts https://t.co/zgCafTRo3u
Teddy Roosevelt sought to protect public lands for future generations, doubling the number of sites in the @NatlParkService. @SecretaryZinke has repeatedly bowed to special interests, putting fragile ecosystems at risk for generations to come. #WhatWouldTeddySay https://t.co/BvU2lRMpeK
Teddy committed to protecting public lands after exploring what is now @YosemiteNPS. Rolling back protections for these lands, as @SecretaryZinke has continued to do, wasn't in the cards then, and shouldn't be now. #KeepItPublic https://t.co/0fOBE7fpWY
Happy 146th birthday, Yellowstone! Roosevelt called for preserving our parks for ours and future generations – which also means, not pricing people out. Unfortunately, @SecretaryZinke has recommended nearly tripling entrance fees to 17 national parks, including Yellowstone. https://t.co/nVbtiQLNrX

President Trump's first year in office ended with a government shutdown, putting parks at risk. That's fitting, because we've never seen a tougher year for public lands. Here's a recap of attacks on national parks and public lands during #TrumpsFirstYear (thread)
Video: Confusion and disappointment at Fort McHenry as shutdown closes the gates https://t.co/BZxFhyPI1o
RT @eilperin: ZInke toured the Mall this morning, but visitors across the country are arriving to find roughly 1/3 of all park units closed…
Most National Parks are partially closed and at least 1/3 are completely closed. "Huddled masses? Come back later: The Statue of Liberty closed by shutdown" https://t.co/8GmcX3SKfx via @eilperin &amp; @markberman
The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are among the park units closed during the government shutdown. More info in our FAQ: https://t.co/tEfmBLmyxo https://t.co/NgGIuOEtyw
The administration's plan to keep parks partially open during the shutdown puts park resources and visitors at risk. Congress needs to end the shutdown before it's too late. https://t.co/bU84q1DknM https://t.co/KyqtmlA70G
Parks need the National Park Service . It's that simple. What does the government mean for park visitors? That's not so simple. Our new FAQ lays it out for you. https://t.co/tEfmBLmyxo https://t.co/bNAB3ulQip
National parks -- and visitors -- cannot be adequately protected without the expertise of the National Park Service. Tell Congress: End the shutdown and fund our national parks! https://t.co/XwMvkMsy5F https://t.co/o871AJeWeQ
The vague guidance national park staff are being given from @SecretaryZinke not only raises serious questions about the safety of visitors and park resources, but also the legality of the administration’s partial closure plan https://t.co/bU84q1UVMm

There is no substitute for National Park Service staff and their expertise. @SecretaryZinke's plan to leave national parks open during a govt shutdown puts our national park resources and visitors at risk https://t.co/7lcI4joqho
