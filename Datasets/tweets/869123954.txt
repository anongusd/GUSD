@SouthTXHauler I don't care who ya' are, that's sweet AF.
@ScottReedTTA @ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Really? Because I didn't see that. Because I wasn't lurking in the parking lot like a creeper, peeping in car windows.

@ScottReedTTA @ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump That's not a receipt for damages, Scott. And you were using the phone again that night, so it was clearly not rendered non functional. And I don't expect you to remember disrobing after an enormous consumption of moonshine.

@ScottReedTTA @ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump George doesn't like being called a liar. We did not get a receipt for repair. We got a request for us to pay you for something you alleged was broken at our show. And you didn't call the cops because you were too busy taking your clothes off and running around drunk off your ass
@ScottReedTTA @ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump If your phone was broken you sure never supplied the damage receipt you were asked for. Just another shitty jab, hunh Scott? You're pitiful. Bless your heart. Heap it on, Scooter. Take your shots while you know I'm too far away to slap your ass again.

@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Nah dude. Unlike you, we're not directed to speak by someone else. That's scary. Like I said, Google it. Educate yourself. I have better things to do than be scandalous on social media.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Good luck Todd. I have other things to do but talk in ridiculous circles. I hope you're successful in your endeavors. The fact that you dont feel the same about people who are more "like-minded" about trucking rights than you will ever be speaks volumes. Go be trucker famous.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Good for you. How does that make you special? 3 million drivers out there, Todd. Probably more than less could get a better deal. Guess who doesn't care? The people getting the best deal they can with OOIDA. THis world doesn't revolve around you, Todd. News flash.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Not sure how much more in the fight I can be than to work for the magazine that reports the fuckery the government is imposing on small business trucking, Todd. We own a truck too. I've lived on the road. We've owned a trucking business. I've never heard of you either.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure how much more present you can get than having full time offices and staff in DC, but whatever. And OOIDA's insurance provides thousands of small business truckers affordable coverage they wouldn't get elsewhere. Next?
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump I don't advocate to sell books or magazines or be trucker famous, Todd. And perhaps if you'd take a minute to do anything other than scream "me" you'd find a wealth of resources and higher level of respect from your peers. Again, best of luck to you.

@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump It's only as reliable as the information input into it. That's a piece of paper, friend. It doesn't keep you safe. Neither does a clock.

@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump And one minor accident, or one kid who doesn't get his medicine on time, or one ambulance that can't make it to the hospital during a highway protest will be amplified ten million times in the press and all that work will be destroyed. So y'all go ahead, do you.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Not to mention millions of dollars and hundreds of strategically filed lawsuits and chess matches between lawyers and lawmakers that have gone on, quite literally, FOR YEARS.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump This is about blatant abuse of power for a futile and unachieveable result. This is about continuing to task the safest drivers on the road to "be safer." This is about SO MUCH MORE than hotdoggin and making headlines. It's about years and years of concentrated effort.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump And you might want to drop the "me" from your vocabulary and replace it with "us" or "the group." The "me, me, me" thing is abrasive to people who have spent decades working for "US." If this was all about "me" I'd have walked off long ago. This is about a principal and tyranny.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump The actions and involvement of "people like me" have been going on for 45 damn years at OOIDA. The progress made has been HUGELY in part to a never ending steady pressure of lawsuits and behind the scenes from OOIDA. Never doubt the people who have BEEN FIGHTING.

@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump And suddenly every Tom Dick and Harry who wants to be trucker famous is freaking expert and has their own version of OOIDA. Really now? That's some stupid shit. Just like the ELD.
@ToddCampbell94 @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump We told people to comment and fight back when they started whispering about this bullshit 7 years ago. Did anyone do anything? NO. They sat around and said, "They ain't never gonna make me do shit." And guess what? 4 years later the stupid thing is mandated.

It's precisely what @TRUCKINGdotORG does and the reason they're despised above all others. Don't be like the ATA. Back up your statement with stats.
@marathontrucker @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Just like clocks dont do anything but keep time.
@marathontrucker @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Exactly. Precisely. We give over (or have no choice and are mandated to) an enormous amount of personal freedom for the sake of safety and saving lives and see no benefit on the lifesaving end. Because gadgets don't staunch the flow of stupid on the roads.
@philkillerlain @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump They are nothing but. It's a stupid idea because it's a clock. And clocks keep time. And instead of bickering we should be asking why there are more fatalities in a relatively same number of crashes. Are the safety features failing or are there that many shitty drivers?
@marathontrucker @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Which speaks to the what should be the real question here, instead of bickering, why the hell are there more fatalities in roughly the same number of crashes? Are safety features not doing their magic? Or is there an exponential number of shitty drivers?
@marathontrucker @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Compliance and safety are not the same. Does one effect the other? Absolutely. But if compliance and safety were so strongly correlated, there would be no exemptions. Ever. And every single rule on the book would be enforced every single day on every single truck. But they're not
@philkillerlain @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump You cant feel your way into making a clock do something besides tell time, Phil. That's all a clock is capable of doing. Giving a timepiece credit for doing anything but telling time is foolishness. We told FMCSA it was foolishness from the beginning. And it still is.
@philkillerlain @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump To say it's a detriment to safety would force us to say it has ANY EFFECT AT ALL ON SAFETY. IT DOES NOT. IT IS A CLOCK. ITS A STUPID MANDATE BECAUSE ITS A STUPID IDEA TO BELIEVE A CLOCK CAN IN ANY WAY MAKE ANYTHING OR ANYONE SAFER.
@philkillerlain @Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump Fatal crashes and crashes are NOT THE SAME THING. FFS, Phil. You know better than that. You're feeding into the notion that drivers don't have enough sense to drive safely BECAUSE OF A GODDAMN CLOCK. It's a CLOCK, PHIL. Its unnecessary because IT DOES NOTHING BUT KEEP TIME.

@Getten @TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump What does that have to do with any of this? The statement was made that crashes have increased since implementation of ELD, I am asking for the source of this information. Nothing I've seen implies this to be true. An ELD is a clock. Nothing more. It DOES NOT AFFECT SAFETY.

@TheTonyJustice @realDonaldTrump I'm curious as to where those statistics came from. Preliminary data says there's been no change, which indicates ELD's are exactly what we told them they were from the beginning. A clock. A billing option. Not a safety feature, not a magic trick. A. Clock.
@godofcommerce @Land_Line_Mag @AmericanTrux It's a good one... ;)
@RARpartners @scott_thereal @HELLRAISER32907 @Land_Line_Now US Express switched over in 2007. There is ample data. The data says ELD's are clocks and they keep time. Fleets with ELD's have lower HOS violations. The correlation between a time-keeping device and safety has not been made. It will not be made. Because clocks aren't magic.
@Jim_Jordan I can smell the fear on this tweet, #GYM, and it's as fetid as your skin tone. It would be hilarious if it weren't so diabolically stupid.

@Unclegtruck here's a piece I did on @Dock411App a while back https://t.co/SZ7yAa9dQx
@Unclegtruck @Dock411 uses what they call "The Forge" to filter bad information. Retired or disabled DRIVERS - not egg-head kids with tech degrees - sort and verify the info input. It was one of the reasons I fell in love with this platform. It's done so very well.

@driversofnyc @illegal53NYC If a truck shows up at the same place every day it means the place they show up at NEEDS THE THINGS THE TRUCK BRINGS TO THEM. If you have a problem with this, perhaps you should contact the place ORDERING THE GOODS. Why do you go after the driver, who is often force dispatched?
@driversofnyc @illegal53NYC Contrary to popular belief, truck drivers are capable of human speech. They can also read. And you can bet your padded bicycle pants they don't just cruise the city for fun. Nor do they appreciate being vilified for imaginary "machismo"
@driversofnyc @illegal53NYC Have any of you tried asking the trucker? I mean, I know holding your dick in your hand and crying about how awful it is that these people are bringing the supplies you need to live in your utopia city is a lot more fun, but you'd probably learn something if you asked.

And the blatant, everyday, non-stop fuckery continues because people think poor past behavior somehow negates present poor behavior.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey You know what Monte? If he'd shut his damn mouth and quit tweeting ridiculous lies it would really help a lot. He brings more bad press on himself than is fabricated for him. You don't act like that when you're POTUS. And you don't continue acting like that if it hurts the USA.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey I thought I was very clear about my distaste for all of them in general. I take their actions into consideration and am not blinded by partisan sandbags to defend any of the bullshit. You can't preach financial accountability and have none, no matter who you are.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey Pointing out glaring faults in your argument isn't slamming you. You've done the same for me and I wouldn't even consider it a slam. It's frustrating beyond belief, but it's not a slam.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey Solid economics should be required OF A PRESIDENT,  Monte. FFS, talk about giving a pass to someone. Why can't YOU admit that if 1/10th of this skullfuckery had gone on in the Obama administration, you'd have stormed that gates by now? None of this is okay. NONE OF IT.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey And holy shit Monte, you're expecting young families to do something the whole damn federal government cant achieve. Christ, how many more trillions of dollars are we in debt with this administration???? Please, pontificate some more about the GREAT direction we're headed.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey It IS living within your means if you can pay your bills and have any savings at all. Expecting young families to have 6 months  savings and saying they aren't living within their means if they dont is ludicrous. You know what an E-3 makes? Less than poverty level in most states.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey Tell that Dave Ramsey bullshit to someone who's making a choice between which bill to pay this week because the president and his circus of idiots cant get their shit together.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS @DaveRamsey No one said he was to blame. It's a fact and has been for at least 15 years now. Smart assery about past administrations is as pertinent to this conversation as tits on a bull. Creating more financial burden for the middle class family is asinine and counterproductive.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Good God, Monte. I know it's not lost on you that a month without pay is devastating to people who DON'T have money trouble. It CREATES money trouble. 85% of families in America are ONE paycheck from disaster. That doesn't speak highly of the "robust" economy.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS It tells me he's a shitty negotiator. The only thing that prevents him from leading that pack of inflated egos around is his own. If you can't be king of the idiots, you should reassess your leadership skills.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS The federal freaking government stops paying the Coast Guard and Border Patrol and the same damn people who were so freaking out of their minds mad about Arrow are like, "They should have savings. MAGA." That's INSANE. It's hypocrisy of the highest order.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Here's something I don't understand. Arrow trucking went belly up and left drivers stranded, owing them money. Everyone (including me) lost their damn minds. "Every single person responsible for this should be prosecuted!!" Etc, etc. T
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS I've never liked him. He was an idiot when he was a Democrat and he's an idiot as a Republican. I dont like Pelosi either. And Mitch McConnell is a gigantic canker on the bottom of a catfish belly. Schumer is disgusting. Like I said, they could all choke to death for all I care.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS The moral of the story is: when you break someone's nose, helping not bleed on themselves is a lost effort. You control your damn self in the first place and act like you have some goddamn sense. I learned that lesson in 5th grade. Its appalling 70 year olds can't understand it.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS I told her I broke Darlenes nose because she wouldn't shut up but I made sure Darlene didn't bleed on her Gloria Vanderbilt Jean's after I broke her damn nose, so that counted for something, right? She slapped my damn head around and told me that was stupidest thing I'd ever said
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS And unbecoming of the office he holds. Here's a story: When I was in 5th grade I broke a girl's nose with my math book because she wouldn't shut the hell up. When my momma came to get me from the principal's office she asked me what the hell I thought I was doing.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Or any number of unsavory things that have happened in what seems like the longest two years of my life. And FYI, the MSN doesn't sit around and make it ALL up. Most of his troubles come from an innate inability to shut the hell up. His swirling circus of shit is tiresome.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS So why didn't he do it when he had control of the house? It would have been easy-peasy and no one would suffer. Oh that's right. He was busy playing golf at his resorts and doing everything he could to test the emoluments clause. Or defending himself in court.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS And I promise you, if my daughter brought the kind of "class" home to us with her tits hanging out and her legs spread for the world to see, I'd slap her damn mouth and tell her to have some self-respect. That is not "class". It's a side show.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS At the expense of middle class families who took jobs with the government and were promised to be paid in return. Not to mention the small business suffering. Feds may get back pay but the guy who owns a coffe shop by the shipyard is shit out of luck.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Whatever, Monte. That statement alone tells me we have vastly different definitions of "class." I've given no one a pass, they can all choke to death tonight for all I care, I've stated facts. This deal was made long ago. The current situation is wholly a power play shitshow.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS Stop it. The deal was made long ago and everyone agreed on it. Don't make me bring the hypocrisy of flying his wife, the country's most expensive immigrant and purveyor of anchor baby and chain migration, to his resort on our dollar. Nothing makes ANY of this okay.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS And any "leader" who allows bullshit like this to carry on is not worthy of my vote. Never will be. PS: MSN reports the market. They don't "make it up" to slam Trump. Farms are were dying before he started this shit, it was the death blow for many.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS I'm not spending my morning on this again. We'll see how great the financial forecast is after the federal employees aren't having to stand in lines at food banks to feed their families. You of all people know the devastating effects this has on small businesses. It's shameful.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS And yet factories are still closing to move elsewhere, the Federal employees are being held financially hostage and farmers are being ruined at an exponential rate. If you can eat money, vote for whoever you want and hope you're paid on time.
@ReeverTransport @DonaldJTrumpJr @POTUS That offer was bullshit and he knew it going in. Would you take an ELD mandate if they promised to "look into" never implementing a speed limiter? It would be foolish. And considering the amount of foolishness EVERY SINGLE ONE of those dipshits has displayed, there is no trust.

@ccrig13 @RepMarkMeadows That's "nothingberder", remember? The bombshells don't surprise or influence my feelings that the GOP is in deep shit at all. It's constant, desperate tweets from the Fauxdom Caucus that influence my opinion that they know it and clutch at their own pearls on the regs.
@ccrig13 @RepMarkMeadows The fact is, they were both convicted, by Mueller,  during this investigation, amirite? No amount of smartassery or obfuscation changes those FACTS. My opinion is, the investigation should remain open until it is finished. And it's finished when there's no one else to prosecute.

@ccrig13 @RepMarkMeadows No honey, my level of revulsion in what has already been proven with indictments and guilty verdicts far outweighed my fear a long time ago.

@Liberty4Life73 @DonaldJTrumpJr Sweetheart, "perjury" means "lie." He perjured himself and has multiple times. Brush up on your Russian to English translations and try to read a little. Oh ha ha, I mentioned Russia. Yeah, they're the bad guys. That's something the Trumps can't seem to understand. Bless.

@Getten Excellent response.
Tell us your best trucking story.
(6) Just a side note on the "pain" part. During the year our kid was starving to death because her guts had been marauded around in so much,  her systems started shutting down. This resulted in a hysterectomy. She was 31. She will never have biological children. But she's THIN!!
(5) But I still feel the urge to scream, "FUCK YOU" every time I see your weasely face on the television. So I'd love it if y'all could find other advertisers. His money is covered with pain.
(4) You better bet Trace Curry's office was one of the ones billing. Her surgery was approved by insurance. Let me assure you this does not mean dick. After her bankrupcy goes through this spring, she will finally be on the path to a normal life. So fuck you, Trace Curry. We won.
(3) No. He passed her off to one of his associtates who bungled along for a year until we took her to Cleveland Clinic. She's just now rebuilding her life, and we're just now reovering financially from taking care of her. That child had half a million in hospital bills.
(2) She lost weight alright, and everything else. Her home, her car, her job - because she was so sick she couldn't function as a normal human being. But by God she was skinny. Skinny to the point of concentration camp. Do you think I got any kind of help from Weaselface Curry?
@whiotv (1) I wish y'all wouldn't run @LoseWeightCincy commercials. I hate starting my day looking at that weasel Trace Curry - he damn near killed our daughter two years ago with a #gastricsleeve He passed her off like a hot potato, we never saw his face again.

@JoshuaB30667039 @truckers_unite Nobody wants the borders open. We want the disgusting pissing match between two terrorist factions of a corrupt government to take their goddamn fight somewhere it doesn't involve holding American families financially hostage.

@realDonaldTrump The fact that you would forgo paying the human beings that actually secure the borders for "years" indicates a very distinct lack of understanding. Holding American federal employees and their families finincially hostage while forcing them to work is an act of terrorisim.

@philkillerlain @Jim_Jordan @WarrenDavidson Holding federal employees and their families financially hostage and forcing them to work without pay is a terroristic act. Plain and simple. And the contractors DO NOT get back pay, they're just shit out of luck. Once again, small business gets gutted and no one cares.
@realDonaldTrump Hmmm...I don't recall either of them asking the people who actually secure our borders (Coast Guard and Border Patrol) to WORK FOR FREE WHILE THEY SHIT THEIR PANTS LIKE A BABY. Stomp off and have your fits elsewhere Button Boy, let the adults handle the border and PAY THEM.

@goose2448 @JRossforMidland @FMCSA The trucks won't stop coming, friend. There's oil in them there hills. Jesus Christ himself couldn't stop those trucks, until every last dime is dredged from the earth. There's money to be made and oil companies to make it. It's far easier to make friends and find a compromise.
@goose2448 @JRossforMidland @FMCSA How about using the largest employer in your constituency to your advantage, instead of making enemies of every driver who sees this news piece, or reads the write-up? Do you not get that it's easier to incentivize than penalize? Think about it. More fines don't create solutions.
@goose2448 @JRossforMidland Here's an idea @JRossforMidland - instead of forcing drivers to choose which law they must break (parking on private property, or log violation) how about help the industry come up with a solution? How about going at the @FMCSA mental giants who come up with these HOS?
@goose2448 @JRossforMidland So instead of a "caped crusader" against the evil trucking crime lords of the metropolis, he appears to be a safety nuisance, who has no understanding of the federally mandated hours of service professionals - who quite literally feed his city - must abide by to be lawful.
@goose2448 Precisely. And I'm sure some PR firm told @JRossforMidland what an awesome optic it would be, to appear all "crime-stopper" and "investigative," however, they failed to take the 45 seconds to do a quick search and find that 70% of the constituents have jobs related to trucking.
Oh that's right! Because the gubmint mandates they take rest breaks, but gives them no place to go, and twats like you, who think you're doing the city a favor, run around waking people up. What do you want? Tired drivers, or parked trucks? Pick a lane, big man.
Hey, @JRossforMidland - guess what trucks bring (besides your cheap suit and fruit loops?) They bring big business, like @SolvayGroup, who, for some strange reason, can't seem to find enough #truckdrivers in your area. Crazy, right?? I mean, why aren't people flocking to the job?
@JRossforMidland - my momma said some people love attention - even if it's negative. How bout' you get your big ol' face in the news for solving problems, instead of waking tired truckers?	https://t.co/CA36FYa1ue
@JRossforMidland do you really believe those drivers would prefer to stay in a parking lot in your shithole city, as opposed to safe, unmolested parking in designated areas? Think about it. And I hope next time you're tired, someone bangs on your bedroom window and wakes you.

When I asked him if he understood personal conveyance, he said, "They don't allow us to use personal conveyance."  Well that's just freakin' brilliant. Because, you know, it's a safety thing and all... &lt;&lt;screams a little, scares the dog, stops screaming&gt;&gt;&gt;
Aaand, if you're me (W), you spend the first hour you're awake explaining to someone that saying, "safe haven," doesn't equate to "not It," and can't magically remove burdensome HOS regulation like a time talisman. Sigh. Guess who trained him? An @TRUCKINGdotORG favorite, folks.

@Jim_Jordan So let me get this right. It's ok to lie to your constituents about removing unnecessary regulation, because it wasn't under oath? Just making sure the truckers you lied to have this right before they #Rememberinnovember at the polls.

So, stay "woke " all you want. But you might consider a new alarm clock. One that's worked efficiently for years and can produce paper to prove where the money goes.
So instead of blaming others for "not representing you" perhaps you'd consider that you haven't been paying as close attention as you'd like to believe. The ELD fight isn't new. It began  20 years ago.
And there's no one more "out of touch" than people who have to remind everyone else how "woke" they are, while they're doing exactly the same thing the "out of touch" people did 6 years ago. Perhaps you consider being 6 years late to the party someone else's fault?

Down around Houston County, Georgia, where myself and ol @SecretarySonny grew up, people would say you've "stepped in it with both feet," Rick. And folks don't care for that kind of dealing.
That's not safe, Rick. It's not cyber-safe, it's not improving road safety and it's destroying small business. That doesn't sound like something someone with such a vigor for farming in Arkansas and national security would want at all.
Would you take a medication that was "self-certified" by the manufacturer, Rick? Or plug something into your $120,000 truck to track everything you do that was "self-certified" by the company profiting from its sale and continued use?
Oh wait, one more tiny tidbit about "national security." You do seem interested in talking about it, but don't seem interested in making sure it's provided to the millions of professional drivers who are forced by law to install "self-certified" equipment into their investments.

@knilsen63 I get the part about shippers taking advantage, and it might not be the best option, but it's flexibility. And that's what people asked for. They asked to be able to stop the clock from ticking while they sat in traffic or stopped to take a break.

@DFH1067 You're as pitiful as Uncle Ted. Please disappear. With him.
@DFH1067 Awesome dude. You're so fucking cool. I'd give you a thumbs up, but unfortunately, I just jabbed mine into my own eyeball to end the pain of suffering this incredibly useless conversation.

@DFH1067 @philkillerlain @CBSNews And FYI, that's called "speaking my mind." Would you like to go into great detail about how I'm doing that wrong, too? Because guess what? It goes both ways. You can't adore someone for speaking their mind and berate someone else for doing the same damn thing.
@DFH1067 @philkillerlain @CBSNews Really? Has this really gone to a "I know you are, but what am I?" thing? Seriously? Who the fuck said anyone was perfect? I'm not making commentary for the Pope, here. I'm referring to ancient history that seems really pertinent when Uncle Ted rears his head to "speak his mind."
@DFH1067 @philkillerlain @CBSNews You keep referring to me "liking" him, which doesn't have a hill of beans to do with it. Irony was the general feeling, about someone who, in the past, has used to lecherous advantage the fact that young girls are easily led, talks shit about young girls being easily led.

@RepMarthaRoby Hey Martha, guess what profession is considered a "front line of defense" in human trafficking? #trucking and #smallbusinesstrucking makes up 85% of the workforce. Why not support both by not voting for #falsesafety and #overregulation?
@RepRutherfordFL with a career in law enforcement surely he can understand how diverse the #smallbusiness truckers schedules who haul produce through Florida have become. Why vote for #falsesafety when you can support millions of miles of experience? #rememberinnovember
@RepAlLawsonJr claims to protect working families. Hi, Al, #meetrealtruckers who are working families and need you to actually protect them, instead of just using the phrase in a gubmint bio. #rememberinnovember
@RepHastingsFL "priorities include continued efforts to create jobs and provide greater economic opportunities for middle class and working poor Americans." You forgot to add, "except #smallbusiness #trucking." Your votes do not reflect such for them. #rememberinnovember

@knilsen63 @Land_Line_Mag @USRepLong Billy Long and a couple hundred other "agriculture supporters" voted to go forward with the ELD mandate, after knowing full well the impact it would have on time-sensitive and live animal transport. 80% of trucking is small business. Billy also knows this. What's up, Billy?
@RepRickCrawford Oh Rick, not the livestock. You really gonna prance this horse and pony show about how much you love agriculture around on here, in front of all these #smallbusiness #trucking families you're killing with the ELD mandate? Honey, hush. You should pick a lane. Stick with it.
@RepJimmyPanetta Good thing you have those #trucks and #truckers there to bail your asses out. Otherwise, you'd be swimming in mud. Well, not "you" per se, because you've always got the sewage in DC to go to. The truckers will remember you in November, Jimmy. #truckersneverforget
You have an opportunity to be a leader among the "no" votes that don't make sense, and say you made a mistake. We need leadership, Billy. Lead or get the hell out of the way, because we're sending you home in November. #rememberinnovember
Lookit this double talking right here - @USRepLong KNOWS HIS STATE RELIES ON AGRICULTURE, and voted to destroy the #smallbusiness trucking families THEY rely upon to move their produce. Please explain, Billy. Because I'm having a hard time here. https://t.co/3WNAnonlBr
@USRepLong Uhh, so why did you vote to cripple #smallbusiness trucking families in your state? You're on my list to find out why you "love farms and farmers so much" but vote behind their backs to destroy the business they rely upon to move their produce. That don't make no sense, Billy.

Another day, another round of being ignored by our reps. Is y'all crazy, or all at lawyer's offices, hoping you don't catch flame from the dumpster fire you're wallowing in up there in the cesspool? You wish it was as nice as a swamp. Don't worry, we'll see to it you go home.

@jeff_lefever @RepSmucker Good luck getting an answer. Apparently, truckers aren't important enough to speak to. Until there's a disaster, or they need us for something. Like groceries. #rememberinnovember #truckersneverforget #wearecomingforyou #tiredoflies #tiredofdoubletalk

@RepMarthaRoby You know what else would be great? If you answered why you voted to cripple #smallbusinesstrucking in your state. We've asked for answers multiple times, and continue to be ignored. Not quite the "staunch defender of agriculture" you claim to be, or what, Martha?
@SecretarySonny when are you gonna use that #Georgiaboy muscle to snatch a knot in some heads and help us get this ridiculous ELD mandate lifted? You know farms can't run profitably without #trucks - help us out, here. #knockoutbadregs #OOIDA #MeetRealTruckers
No worries, Mike. We're going ghost on you, just like you did us. Later, tater.
Because of YOUR votes. Now that's some damn fine #irony, ain't it?
Funny story, @RepMikeTurner , the last time we voted for you, we made it home with 34 minutes to poll closing, and busted ass to get there so we could support you and your empty promises. Even if we chose to support you again, we wouldn't make it under the same circumstances.
@RepMikeTurner I've tweeted you close to 400 times, sent 200 emails to your office, called more times than I can count, and I get nothing. Guess what, Scooter? That's what you're getting from us next time you ask for support of your filthy party. #rememberinnovember

Cue the same crickets we've heard, time and again, when asking for explanations. Be silent all you want, you will hear the roar in November, and it will be the voice of American truckers, who are sick of your double talking bullshit. #rememberinnovember #truckersneverforget

Unless of course, you DID know and voted for it anyway.  Willful stupidity will not be forgiven. Nor will blatant thievery. So which is it? Pick a lane. We're waiting.
I believe we'd all accept it just fine if y'all would just admit you didn't know what in the hell you were voting for and asked for a "do-over."
I don't care what large, smelly animal you associate your party with, you need trucking to feed your elephant or jackass. You need it to feed America.
