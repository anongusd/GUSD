Nominating Wheeler is the definition of dereliction of duty. Mr. Trump has a sworn responsibility to protect the American people and he is directly and deliberately breaking that oath. This is the lowest kind of behavior. Vile and inexcusable. A perfect example of why he must go.
Mr. Trump is just another failed lawbreaker. He can do nothing at this point but rage against the truth of his past behavior. He should bite the bullet, confess, and ask for clemency.
This tax bill was always a Republican lie. It benefits rich people and big corporations, and all the other benefits are fakes. It will, however, crater our budget and lead to a Republican attack on working Americans. Cruel, stupid, and dishonest.

Tax breaks for the wealthy only help the wealthy. Take it from me, I‚Äôm a billionaire. #NotOnePenny
Donald Trump is selling out working America for his own profit, and the profit of his millionaire cronies.
Or Tom Price, Trump‚Äôs millionaire HHS Secretary, who took two taxpayer-funded jets to visit former colleagues and family members.
Or Steve Mnuchin, Trump‚Äôs millionaire Treasury Secretary &amp; former Goldman Sachs exec who requested a taxpayer-funded jet for his honeymoon.
Rich people like Donald Trump, the first president in decades who refuses to release his tax returns. How much would he profit from this?
Instead, Republicans want to cut taxes for the rich, because they want the rich to have more money.
And, they wouldn‚Äôt push a plan that gives tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas.
They wouldn't threaten programs like Medicare, Social Security, and public education that strengthen the middle class.
If Republicans really wanted to help people, they‚Äôd make healthcare more affordable, not less. They‚Äôd be tough on polluters, not unions.
Doesn‚Äôt happen. You know it. I know it. They know it. We all know it.
So they pretend to have some complicated scheme by which they give rich people more money and then rich people ‚Äúpass it on‚Äù to you.
Republicans know that if they say ‚ÄúWe want to give rich people all the money because we like them better‚Äù they won‚Äôt get far.
Republicans in Washington know this, of course.
The richest 1% now take 20% of all income and hold nearly 40% of all wealth in America, and everyone else struggles to get by.
Income inequality skyrocketed. Middle-class wages stagnated. The share of all income taken by the richest 1% has doubled.
Starting with Reagan, we cut the top tax rate on the richest Americans from 70% to 39%. The Rich got richer, everyone else got screwed.
Republicans say if we cut taxes for rich people the benefits will trickle down to everyone else. Hasn‚Äôt worked for 40 years, won‚Äôt work now.
They‚Äôre lying about what it would do, and they‚Äôre lying about why they want to do it.
The first thing you need to understand about the Trump/Republican tax plan is that they‚Äôre lying about it.
