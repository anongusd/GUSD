@DemFromCT OF COURSE they lie about it, they're politicians and they want to get re-elected! If you want an honest broker, you're barking up the wrong tree with Congress. Compromise is key.
@DemFromCT You need to be bipartisan, which I guess is politics, so on that point you're right. However, the work politics has a negative connotation, where as just saying bipartisan does not. So I will stand corrected there.
@DemFromCT Also, you find me ONE, just ONE R that is willing to put his/her ass on the line and draft a bill that ONLY eliminates pre-x. It wouldn't even make it to the floor. It would never happen because they know it's both bad policy and bad for re-election.
@DemFromCT It's not about winning and losing? We are in an election year &amp; there are a lot of vulnerable R seats, the only politicians that don't want to win are the ones not running for re-election. Politics have nothing to do with making good policy &amp; we both know that. 🍻
@DemFromCT Except for the fact that they vote partisan, not their conscious. I speak to senators on both sides of the isle about this issue a couple times a week. It's nothing but politics.
@DemFromCT Pre-existing conditions are not an R or D issue. People try to make it one to appease their base, but the truth is both R's and D's have family members who benefit from pre-existing conditions being covered, and neither side wants to eliminate it.

@politiCOHEN_ I just pre-ordered it. The excerpts sold me quick.
@adrianeisoverit There's loyalty, but not loyalty to Trump. Which is the only positive I see right now. There's loyalty to the country. There are a few members of the administration who are staying in, just to insure that Trump doesn't F**K the whole country up.
This article is quite painful and sad to read.		https://t.co/4dqVUlJzhA
@adrianeisoverit TBF, the lack of documents/review excuse is mostly crap. The majority of Dem Senators, made their mind up about Kavanaugh a long time ago. I can understand why they would feel that way based on some of Kavanaugh's remarks in the past, BUT this is politics at it's worst.
@adrianeisoverit It only benefits the Republican party because they hold the majority. This is why voting in elections are so important.
@adrianeisoverit Voice your opinion, be upset about the process, but do not conduct yourself in this manner. These proceedings are public, and these actions make us look weak, to anyone watching this on tv. Just imagine the overseas coverage.
@adrianeisoverit The Senate is supposed to be the more refined side of Congress. They can't continue to complain about Trump, his theatrics, and that of his administration, if this is how they're going to conduct themselves. This should be about decorum; instead, it's a circus sideshow.

Especially since Trump can't pardon offenses under state criminal law. Cohen's testimony opened up Weisselberg and Howard's testimony, now they have immunity. The State could certainly bring charges against the Trump Org. Which he could be liable for to a certain extent, right?
Here me out here because I really don't know what I'm talking about, BUT; could it be possible that Mueller knew he couldn't indict the president, so instead he allowed the states to make charges against his conspirators...?
@jcopat83 Those people are exhausting.

@wyattblakee My WHOLE point in this thread is that we don't have all of the information, Mueller does, and it's his job to see that the investigation is completed thoroughly.
@wyattblakee But if you want to talk about votes; what about Cohen, Wyatt? How about the fact that he paid off not one, but TWO women that Trump had affairs with, so that it wouldn't come out against him during the election? Think that wouldn't have changed "a single vote"? Give me a break.
@wyattblakee Why are you even talking about "changing the votes"? That has nothing to do with my comments. You're literally just regurgitating television talking points, and I can't even with you right now.
@wyattblakee and the charges that were brought upon him in DC. Do you expect that IF there was collusion, they'd be waiving a giant flag saying, HERE WE ARE, COLLUDING WITH THE RUSSIANS? No.
@wyattblakee It is not at all clear that they're at the end of their investigation. You're literally ignoring all of the facts of not only Manaforts case from yesterday,

It's important, no matter what the outcome of the investigation, that the Justice Department investigates this thoroughly.
has known about this information for quite some time and is likely using it to question other people in regard to the Russia probe. The Administration calling for "an end to the probe" is ridiculous given what we know now. These types of investigations take a lot of time.

@thejenlife @AnotherCorpGirl There are gloves you can use to hold or scale a fish, they're metal mesh gloves so the scales don't get you. The bait all depends on the kind of fishing you're doing.

@thejenlife @AnotherCorpGirl I suppose you can if you don't wash your hands immediately following. However, most US oceans and rivers are clean enough where a cut like that wouldn't cause a staph infection as long as you washed your hands. Maybe throw some rubbing alcohol on the cut afterward too.
@thejenlife @AnotherCorpGirl yes, fish scales are sharp. However, they'll only cut you if you're holding the fish improperly, or if it somehow wriggles out of your grasp.

@richsin603 @senatorshoshana There is nothing about a CON that forces a provider to consider an alternative market. If a market isn't viable, they're not going to practice there regardless of the need, because they can't generate any REVENUE from the population.
@richsin603 @senatorshoshana Every industry depends on revenue to stay afloat. CON's only restrict providers in an area which decreases market competition, thus giving them the ability to increase their contracted rates, which also increases the cost of care for the population of the area.

@blawlawlaw 🔥🔥🔥
Now we can certainly debate how fairly they’re treated, or how much they should be provided for, but I believe that’s an entirely different conversation. In the end, they live.
The difference as I see it, is that the illegal immigration issue is more about having compassion, how much and should we? Whereas the prolife stance is about not killing another human being. The immigrant children keep their lives, and are provided for by the US gov’t. https://t.co/6xqt9Ds469
@lehmanjoanna @ConfessingTeach YES! You can! That is my point in this whole debate. You don't have to approve/disapprove of one, to approve/disapprove of the other. That would be small minded.
This is not willful ignorance, she's trying to put a round peg in a square hole. Each word has a meaning, and by combining two words, the new word can take on a different meaning. Religious affiliations aside, the immigration issue and pro-life issue are not synonymous. https://t.co/999vQ1ICnL
Say's the person that wanted to argue the definition of the word "pro-life" is wrong, because it differs from the definition of the word "life". I've given you many intellectual points to consider, but again, your narrative being what you want it to be, we won't agree. Cheers. https://t.co/u1C7ikQ9dG
Your FaceBook newsfeed, is not factual evidence. https://t.co/xYjtazU2yR
What factual information can you provide to show that "many pro-lifers are also anti-Back Lives Matter"? None, because this is a statement of opinion, not fact. https://t.co/O2N4X5bGeP
@DCDouchbag @ForumNon This made me laugh really hard.
What you are saying doesn't disprove my point. One is not synonymous with the other. These children have lives, they continue to exist. Not in the most optimal of circumstances, but their lives are not being taken from them. The issue is IMMIGRATION, not pro-life. https://t.co/3BkfYn2FXF
According to Websters Dictionary, the first known use of the term "pro-life" was in 1971, I somehow doubt that they anticipated it's definition being this controversial. https://t.co/uhwMCdzrE8
The perception alone that it would seem unreasonable is a matter of perception though. In the very literal way of analyzing the definition "pro-life" it does not meet the standard by which you are criticizing it. Pro-life, has nothing to do with immigration. https://t.co/PD362nDXz0
The very definition of PRO LIFE, as stated in my tweet, see below: https://t.co/EEJTHqlXb4		I hardly believe that Websters Dictionary is attempting to further a narrative with their definition, but sure, you're welcome to try to make that ridiculous argument. https://t.co/lwY4xDUtba
As a teacher, you should know that the definition of "pro-life" means, opposed to abortion and euthanasia. Being pro-life, has nothing to do with the separation of children from their families at the border. You are interpreting the term "pro-life", to fit your narrative. https://t.co/VhnkpT9Lqt

@emilywithcurls I'm not aware of any travel health insurance plans that cover domestic travel, only international.
@emilywithcurls DM me and I can probably get more specific.
@emilywithcurls What kind of health plan do you have?
@emilywithcurls If you think you're in an emergency situation, I would suggest calling your insurance company to double check whether or not they would treat it as in-network. Ultimately, the ICD code used and the insurance company make the final determination.
@emilywithcurls Again, if it's within the US and is a true emergency, it should be covered in-network. For example ;I live in VA but I'm on vacation in Myrtle Beach&lt; SC... I fall down the stairs at my beach house and break my leg. The trip to the emergency room would be treated as in-network.
@emilywithcurls In the event of a TRUE emergency (note that this is determined by the codes used by the doctor during the visit and the insurance company's internal determination), you will be covered in-network. Now, if you are out of the country altogether, that is a different story.
Who are the Democrats going to put up against Trump in 2020? Anyone have thoughts on this?
