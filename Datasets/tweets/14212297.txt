The narrative that young people moved from FB to IG is annoyingly untrue. FB has more people than IG in EVERY age group. For example, right now, there are 34 million 18-24 year olds on FB and 30 million on IG.
I don’t envy their challenge but the @nba #refs are the worst part of the game. We should be able to enjoy the talent without having to argue about rules or enforcement.
@NBAonTNT I like the halftime. As usual.
@shaulizacks @NBAonTNT Oh holy crab that changes everything! Why didn’t anyone tell me before?!
If hating things that aren’t good enough makes me a #hater, then I am definitely a hater. They used to call it “having standards.” If not being a hater means never asking for better, I’m a hater. Don’t accept #mediocrity.
I guess @gallup you have no intelligent response, or don’t monitor your social media. Either way, not good.
I don’t understand why @NBAonTNT isn’t listening to the overwhelming dislike for #playersonly. I love the commentators, but not having a pro broadcaster is foolish. Unless it’s your G League for broadcasting?
@AndersonPaak You da man

@Delta I get it, you take all negative feedback private and your surveys prevent feedback. Systematic prevention of innovation.
@Delta What are you, a bot? Come on, now. Maybe a human could help.
This @delta is the wrong first question to ask, unless you’re cleverly trying to discourage helpful feedback. Ask something more like “Was there anything good or bad you want to tell us about your recent flight?”
@ErynnFranks @UnderArmour @adidas @Nike Ya, corporations have to grow, and lateral moves with product and audience are super smart. It becomes "aspirational" as in "I aspire to exercise one day!" ;-)
Watching @TheCrownNetflix it’s hard to avoid spoilers. SINCE IT’S HISTORY. “OMG something bad might happen!!! ...THAT ACTUALLY ALREADY HAPPENED.” Still a great show though. #thecrown #jokes

My favorite thing in ATL on the “plane train” is not holding onto anything and hoping people are impressed.
@SophiaLiu13 @JasonMillerCA A lot of what I say is funny to ME. But somehow that’s not good enough? Stand up audiences are so selfish!
I give up. #playersonly sucks. Please stop @nba @NBAonTNT. They just aren't good enough broadcasting by themselves, and 98% of viewers agree. It's best on mute. Please add a professional broadcaster.
@SophiaLiu13 @JasonMillerCA Somebody told me I'm supposed to say something funny to you. So... nice pelican! How long have you two been together?
When I became a #manager, I was an #expert with authority and a #jerk. The only likability I had came from being #funny. Some say it's STILL the only likability I have! The good news is you don't have to be perfect. Just do one likable thing, and that's a start. #leadership

INSIDER TIP: A 15-second #video for #FacebookAds often has to be 13-14 seconds when you upload, because their processing can add a second to the video.
@EMayrhofer I believe Facebook gets singled out because it's so popular. It's really a testing ground for totally new social/internet/business realities, and bears the brunt of that. The most popular things and people tend to be polarizing, regardless.
@EMayrhofer I see your point. Apart from their negligence in not communicating the issue, I see this as par for the course, because it's hard for many to measure video success, since there are so many metrics to choose from, and multiple goals (view vs conversion).

@nba do #refs get fined for missed calls? Or incentivized for getting it right? Their bad calls affect coaches and players and then if they get mad you just issue a technical. If you were perfect that would make sense, but you’re not.

@ImTheeBrock The part where you care about broke future Brock.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Since we started cooking with peachdish, I am disappointed in even the best restaurants. It’s smarter and cheaper to learn how to cook and you can make gourmet stuff that beats most restaurants, even the expensive ones, which is even more of a victory.
@idoapologize And this safety in numbers thing, social proof, belonging is a huge trigger for people.
@idoapologize Yes it is hope, a response to confidence and enthusiasm, and once someone is perceived as successful, all critics are labeled “haters.” And it’s a numbers game. Not everyone is a customer, you just need a % of them to create momentum.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen I think it’s amazing how we’ll buy and eat things in restaurants (with excess salt and sugar levels) we’d never have the guts to make in our homes.
@idoapologize What astounds me is when people don’t realize they’re being conned. All you need to do is read some books and then you can’t be conned and you want to help the people who are. But they want to be conned because they have no natural confidence.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Ah I get that and Fazoli’s is even worse than Olive Garden, if that’s possible. I mean for pure franchising the authenticity out and the corn syrup in.
@idoapologize I was told I was “The Tony Robbins for smart people.” Which may be the same thing. Otherwise I consider any Tony Robbins comparison an insult. He’s not funny and he lies to make money.
@idoapologize I’m glad I was here to help you realize this beautiful moment.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Dude, olive garden sucks, but how many of those breadsticks can you eat? Like 7 at least, but not if you’re hugh jackman.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen I’m convinced you’re a troll who labels other people as trolls without saying it. And you are great at it! You got me. Good one.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Accusing someone of not understanding your sarcasm is as condescending as your meme. I do sarcasm for a living. I don’t miss it, unless the person doing it is horrible at conveying it.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Used to be this amazing thing called a discussion. It wasn’t that all disagreement was a war. I think it’s crazy you think something that could be a discussion is a “war.” But I guess you are “entitled” to be wrong and unchallenged.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen So you just shoot shots and run away. Nice strategy.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Your read is wrong.	Sorry.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen I guess when you don’t have a convincing response, you can just use a meme condescendingly. Classy.
@idoapologize @suebeeak @EdKrassen Real articulate, dude.
@suebeeak @idoapologize @EdKrassen Hey now I’m a foodie who mainly cooks but those endless breadsticks and the CB pancakes covered in berries? Maybe once a year guilty pleasure... If you snob so hard you don’t know how to enjoy these human experiences, you’re missing a lot of life bud.
@ccason1963 @jessjlambert @EdKrassen @Musicbert4 You said “your wrong” about not being educated- seriously? Learn your vs you’re and you will be partly educated
@Cait_Lawlor @hiyaitslynn Because everybody knows now they can beat up on McDonald’s and they have to change.
@iPullRank You may have unrealistic optimism about your abilities lol
@iPullRank Yeah that and if there isn’t already a company that uses cameras and AI/ML to detect @nba #fouls, there should be, because computerized refereeing is the future- at the very least as an assistant to a head #ref
@Jhickness9 Yeah they were playing this kinda ok team called The Warriors whose avg score last year was the highest in the league. And the way refs are calling this year with points of emphasis, it looks like scores will be higher.

A8: 83% of best in class firms use Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ)! #watsoncommerce
A8: CPQ shortens the sales cycle (via automated pricing and approval), speeds delivery and increases accuracy. #watsoncommerce
A8: CPQ Guided Selling increases sales, makes sales teams more effective and gives customers a better experience. #watsoncommerce
A8: 66% of best in class companies provide guided selling to help their sales reps. #watsoncommerce
A7: If you're not using Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ), you're probably doing something messier and dumber. ;-)  #watsoncommerce
Now that's the profoundly simple way to say it! @tracywelton :-) @ibmcommerce  #watsoncommerce
RT @tracywelton: @ibmcommerce A7: #CPQ makes complex selling easy! @ibmcommerce #WatsonCommerce https://t.co/6MMORx0wuQ
A7: CPQ can complete sales quotes in the field, accelerate order the process by 60% and increase online revenues 400%.	 #watsoncommerce
A7: CPQ eliminates many common B2B sales process obstacles... to increase sales and customer satisfaction.	 #watsoncommerce
So true @FeedbackDave you need more volume to get significant stats. Marketing helps with that ;-) #watsoncommerce
A7: 75% of companies can develop and approve proposals faster. Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) is a big opportunity. #watsoncommerce
A7: My favorite TLA is TLA, but CPQ is not bad ;-) #watsoncommerce
A7: 73% of deals are lost due to price! You need a Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) solution to win more of these deals.	 #watsoncommerce
A7: Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) can help companies grow Y-Y revenues by 48% and profits by 57%. #watsoncommerce
Q6: Our agency helps clients with customer data and personalized messaging to each customer segment. Many case studies. #watsoncommerce
Q6: And @ParkerHannifin turned a frustrating, fragmented, 101-division problem into a unified, seamless buying experience. #watsoncommerce
Q6: Trivantage grew sales 50% and increased mobile traffic and growth in new markets by smoothing the customer journey.   #watsoncommerce
Q6: Leaders in Digital Transformation... Other than @ibm ??? :-) You know, @linkedin has been a leader as well. #watsoncommerce
@Garin lol #watsoncommerce
Garren I completely agree! @Garin #watsoncommerce
A5: And personalized guided selling- make your salespeople even more efficient and likable. #watsoncommerce
A5: Personalized search is killer. Amazon has killed it with personalized product surfacing.  #watsoncommerce
A5: Millennials can be a challenging audience but data and personalization can help. #watsoncommerce
A5: And not all millennials are the same. We've divided them into at least 5 categories, depending on the project.  #watsoncommerce
A5: 73% of millennials are involved in product decisions, so you have to personalize to millennials too. #watsoncommerce
A5: Our agency does a lot of marketing personalization- especially generational at times. #watsoncommerce
A5: All the personalizations! :-) #watsoncommerce
A4: Personalization is common sense. We do it in life. Salespeople do it in person. Our tech must do it too.   #watsoncommerce
A4: Do you want to be perceived as outdated? You must have modern technology to support modern buyers.  	 #watsoncommerce
A4: Personalization is inevitable. By 2018, 70% of B2B ecomm sites will offer personalized features.  	 #watsoncommerce
A4: Personalization wins. By 2018, B2B orgs with e-comm personalization will outsell competitors by 30% or more. #watsoncommerce
A4: Empower customer self-service. Do you think you can succeed if you're making it hard for customers to buy from you?   #watsoncommerce
A4: Self-service is shifting B2B. Expectations are higher. Do you have a plan to keep up or will your company fall behind?  #watsoncommerce
A4: B2B buyers expect seamless customer experiences. Don't put roadblocks in the customer journey! #watsoncommerce
A4: B2B digital leaders drive 5X the revenue growth of their peers! Do you want to be a leader or a laggard?   #watsoncommerce
RT @David_A_Gray: @briancarter Lower cost to serve	Higher incremental revenue	Elevated customer satisfaction
Ya @Garin I say focus on customer pains and problems- use tools and data to uncover and solve. #watsoncommerce
A3: With the right tools and processes, you can innovate efficiently. Without, you're simply overwhelmed. #watsoncommerce
A3: The wrong platform limits everything. The right platform enables and empowers everything. #watsoncommerce
A3: And... B2B organizations can be conservative and slow to adopt pervasive innovations. Fight this tendency! 	 #watsoncommerce
A3: Customers use digital more and more, channels + partners are complicated, reach and relationship with buyers is limited. #watsoncommerce
A3: Biggest B2B ecomm challenges: converting to selling online, seamless buying experience, self-serve + personalization.	 #watsoncommerce
We need some transformers @ibmcommerce... the toys not the super lame movies. #watsoncommerce
Just that word EVERGREEN @Garin is so smart. When we get caught up in the wrong news etc., we waste effort. #watsoncommerce
A2: Do you have a data-driven view of your business and the RIGHT key metrics to grow forward? #watsoncommerce
Absolutely @ibmcommerce so many companies are missing out on the power and benefits of personalization through data. #watsoncommerce
A2: Get customer data- more importantly, use it to improve customer experience + sales. How are you using customer data now? #watsoncommerce
Get out of the dark ages and into the age of science. DATA is simply how we listen to customers and improve the experience. #watsoncommerce
A2: And 77% of customers have chosen, recommended or paid more for a brand that uses personalization.  	 #watsoncommerce
A2: Make it easier for customers. No matter where or how each customer researches and buys, are you ready to serve them all? #watsoncommerce
A2: 75 percent of B2B buyers would purchase again from suppliers that offered omni-channel capabilities.   #watsoncommerce
I am applying B2C social media lessons during a B2B chat @ibmcommerce ;-) #watsoncommerce
True that @Garin great to chat with you here. The right innovations at the right time create leadership. #watsoncommerce

A1: Digital transformation disrupts all industries + job functions.But disruption becomes success when you adopt innovation. #watsoncommerce
You will find out big time in this chat! @ThermalStar #watsoncommerce
A1: B2B DIGITAL commerce is predicted to be $1 trillion by 2019. Its growth is diminishing field selling.  	 #watsoncommerce
A1: B2B buyers are just people... who also make B2C purchases. They want a great B2B ecommerce experience.   #watsoncommerce
A1: Even B2B customers want a B2C experience. 80% of B2B buyers expect the same buying experience as B2C customers  	 #watsoncommerce
A1: Customer expectations are shifting. Amazon sets ecommerce expectations, and B2B has to pay attention to this.  	 #watsoncommerce
A1: Customers want self-service. 68% of buyers want to research online before talking to Sales. Up from 53% in 2015.   #watsoncommerce
A1: Disruption... Why? B2B buyers are buying online more and less from field sellers.	 #watsoncommerce

I think when you get into the deets, WHY often shifts to WHAT, in reality DrewNeisser but the brand can't be self-centered #newwaytoengage
A9: @DirectBuy inspires ideal buyers while asking A/B choices about rooms in their dream homes https://t.co/0r8KIqDJui  	 #newwaytoengage
A9: @PayPal's most liked video used humor with their fans' data-discovered love for zombies https://t.co/YVKhsGgabg  	 #newwaytoengage
A9: @PrideStaff's Facebook content mirrors and empathizes with the job seeker's frustrations https://t.co/gj0bvLneuV  	 #newwaytoengage
A9: Intel has found appropriate ways to engage developers with humor @IntelSoftware https://t.co/DoKtZp0MRz  	 #newwaytoengage
Ultimately I think companies can be a bit selfish- if the WHY isn't about the customer... you won't get loyalty. #newwaytoengage
I have a different take. Start with WHO your customer is and WHAT they need. :-) @DrewNeisser #newwaytoengage
A8: Even Mr. Spock is half-human. Your brand should also be at least half-human if you want customer loyalty  	 #newwaytoengage
There are ways to test small. Fear of new ideas is one reason why many big co's get disrupted @RenegadeLLC #newwaytoengage
A8: It's hard to have any relationship let alone a life-long one without affecting people's emotions.	 #newwaytoengage
A7: test more ways to impact customer emotions #business via https://t.co/0WcrczT7ug #newwaytoengage https://t.co/vVwpNiHnO7
A7: Digital makes it easier to powerfully influence customer emotions e.g. video testimonials from strangers  	 #newwaytoengage
A7: Digital has made influencing customer emotions more efficient- we can optimize it through split-testing. #newwaytoengage
A7: Digital has made it easier for us to impact customer emotions quicker- measure that impact, and increase it. #newwaytoengage
That's our hashtag for the event :-) I agree, the wisest things here are not new, only the technology is @milguy23 @Hyken #newwaytoengage
It's a good campaign design when you don't feel emotionally manipulated by it- it's for real @DarlaBlakes  @Dove #newwaytoengage
Ha @smxplorer  @danielkdtwt I'm planning to mention Spock in Q8! #newwaytoengage
Great campaign @DarlaBlakes @Dove real, simple and viral because it addressed a real issue and went for the heart. #newwaytoengage
A6: use emotional motivators or be ignored #quote via https://t.co/0WcrczT7ug #newwaytoengage https://t.co/KjkVf8CZd8

Great point @DrewNeisser No one wants to be in a red ocean except Walmart and Amazon. #newwaytoengage
True @danielkdtwt but you can use both emotion and logic together positively as well! #newwaytoengage
A5: Emotions are more powerful. You can't outsmart emotion. via https://t.co/0WcrczT7ug #newwaytoengage https://t.co/zWzNVGNvQf
A5: You have most sound logical argument in history but your spouse is crying- who wins? You can't outsmart emotion.   #newwaytoengage
affirmation = validation = encouragement -&gt; continued positive behavior @smxplorer  #newwaytoengage
A5: Research says emotions make the buying decision and logic rationalizes. Only idiots disagree. I'm joking. Not really 	 #newwaytoengage
A5: If you market with both emotion and logic, you will usually beat a competitor that markets only with logic.  	 #newwaytoengage
One study said fear drives new behavior, affirmation keeps habits in place. @smxplorer  #newwaytoengage
But humor can be worth the risk. It's too rare that companies higher professional humorists to help. #newwaytoengage
A4: Humor can also engage emotion, but it has to be done skillfully not to offend. Dangerous in the wrong hands.   #newwaytoengage
A4: Want sales and loyalty? Relieve customers' fears and pains, solve their problems, help them fulfill their dreams.  	 #newwaytoengage
A4: Customers are human beings- we're driven by fear, pain, love and dreams.  	 #newwaytoengage
Great to see you Shep! @Hyken  #newwaytoengage
I think @IAmKatieDevs that you are talking about reach, not engagement rate. #newwaytoengage
Most brands do a much better job listening to Twitter than Facebook. Especially comments on FB ads. #newwaytoengage
A3: A good Facebook post should be liked by at least 3% of those that see it. Exceptional ones go up to 10-15%.  	 #newwaytoengage
A3: Also on Facebook, you need to watch out for negative comments, and people hiding posts and ads.  	 #newwaytoengage
A3: Measuring customer emotion: Sentiment is for Twitter. Likes, shares and comments are for Facebook.  	 #newwaytoengage
A3: On Facebook you want to know what % of customers you saw a post liked it, and what % ignored it.   #newwaytoengage
semantic sentiment = the meanings and feelings of the words customers use about you @smxplorer  #newwaytoengage
A2: via https://t.co/0WcrczT7ug #newwaytoengage https://t.co/ZN6PvcAIPT
A2: Your brand can't afford not to know if it's being loved, hated or ignored.	 #newwaytoengage
A2: The brand that's 30% more loved today could easily have a 30% higher stock price tomorrow.   #newwaytoengage
A2: Customer loyalty is not just logical- it's also emotional- and likes and semantic sentiment are barometers. 	 #newwaytoengage
A1: Fixing a problem for an unhappy customer can create a super loyal customer #newwaytoengage
Hey Shep! @Hyken  #newwaytoengage
RT @DrewNeisser: A1: Brands earn “loyalty” by delivering on promises + exceeding expectations w surprise &amp; delight at every turn. #NewWayto…
@DrewNeisser @richardbranson Two types of listening- listening to humans and listening to their data :-) #newwaytoengage
A1: Brands can explore new loyalty drivers by creating content and monitoring customer response.  	 #newwaytoengage
A1: Brands become more likable and trustworthy when they listen to the data about what customers like.  	 #newwaytoengage
A1: Customers choose brands they have liked over and over again. Consistently likable experiences create loyalty.  #newwaytoengage
