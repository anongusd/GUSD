How could Senate Democrats vote against protecting BORN ALIVE babies?!? It baffles me that someone would vote to not protect a human life.
Amazing work congressman. Keep fighting for our law-abiding second amendment rights. @RepRichHudson https://t.co/A2E4mfyZBK
You’re actually still the governor? Jesus Virginia, I am so sorry. https://t.co/MOfl3cquGa
It’s created conversation on both sides of the aisle about how awful it is AND nobody has tried it before because it the absolute worst and dumbest thing I think any legislator of any kind has ever recommended on an actual vote. https://t.co/fmhEXwcQUP
You and your dog have my heart @SenMcSallyAZ please keep the amazing work you do. https://t.co/8oRq5yaHBe
Boring? Hilary Clinton violates the law and is never charged or thoroughly investigated its boring?? But when our President does nothing and is still investigated it’s justified? You make no sense @tedlieu https://t.co/npu2aUP6RI
Proud to see both sides of the aisle stand with Israel. Thank you @SenatorSinema https://t.co/8eybYsds5G
@RepRichHudson Thank you for always standing up for our Second Amendment rights https://t.co/cSPmxXfKvj
Then why are you supporting a bill that would allow abortion until birth? I wouldn’t even call that abortion that’s just plain murder. https://t.co/oi0PydUpYe
Man-made by you and your House Democrats. Talk to Mrs. Pelosi and re-open the government!!! https://t.co/iLk5F3VFSE
What Mrs. Pelosi doesn’t understand is that the Constitution requires the President to give some form of the State of the Union. Madam Speaker, you a breaking our democratic ideals and Constitution by cancelling our State of the Union.
Uhhhhhhh ok? You know there’s this freedom of speech and expression but we’re just gonna ignore that. https://t.co/hO0suxR3ZI
@Eiggam5955 I know
@Eiggam5955 I’m not talking about the hearing I’m talking about a separate trial that has not happened. A criminal trial between Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. I know the hearing was not a trial. Sorry about the confusion. But I’m suggesting that that should take place.
@Eiggam5955 I never blamed Dr. Ford for coming forward. And I do agree that they deserve a fair investigation and trial and the fact she didn’t get one is wrong but like I said, don’t you agree they should be put in a court and have the justice system do its job? I suggested it earlier.
@Eiggam5955 I agree that nobody would forget that kind of stuff. I do think Dr. Ford was sexually assaulted which is terrible but do you think it could’ve be another man? Someone else was in the room and it was them or maybe alcohol played a factor and she could clearly remember?
@Eiggam5955 Also, no investigation has proven her story true. I would also like to add, I would be fine with an actual trial. Put Kavanaugh and Ford and lawyers together and have the American justice system decide. I believe that is that fairest way possible.
@Eiggam5955 Why she would’ve said that, I have no idea. Dr. Ford’s evidence however, well there wasn’t much at all. She claimed it was Kav. and had a believable story but it was changed around during the hearing with different names and all the names she brought up denied it ever happened.
@Eiggam5955 I see where you are coming from. And you have the right to believe anyone you want with or without any evidence. But Mazie Hirono said in an interview on Sep 18 and I quote “Not only do women like Dr. Ford need to be heard, they need to be believed. They need to be believed”
@Eiggam5955 How so? I’m not saying he’s innocent or guilty but he did agree with Democratic Senators like Mazie Hirono of Hawaii who said before any trial or investigation Dr. Ford should be believed no matter what. I’m not sure how I’m false?
Michael Avenatti deserves due process. Yes, he went along with every Democrat and immediately accused Kavanaugh of being a sexual assaulter BUT he still deserves a fair investigation and a fair trial. But it’s still pretty funny and ironic that he says “believe every woman” (-1).

Hey looks like a few Dems and I agree on something-we don’t want Pelosi to be Speaker! We already tried that and it did not work.
@Jayne4Susan @POTUS Agreed! Besides, the President has the right to name whoever he wants as Acting AG and if he doesn’t want Rod, so be it! They serve at the PLEASURE of the President. And with regards to Flake, I’m fine with supporting maverick issues like McCain did but Flake is just outrageous!
Just saw an interview with Michael Avenatti saying he “fights for women’s rights”. He’s the lawyer of a woman who makes money for having sex and just got arrested for domestic violence. Democrats, please run him. I’d love another 4 years of Trump automatically guaranteed!
1-The Mueller investigation is not in trouble and never was in trouble.	2-Jeff Flake is arrogant and just wants to be in the news.	3-Matt Whitaker is ACTING Attorney General. Nothing ha being violated. Besides, appointing him protects Mueller since Rosenstein is involved.
Arizona, I wish you good luck on 6 years with @RepSinema. I must say congrats to her on her hard fought win and campaign. With that said, @RepMcSally was exceptionally the better candidate and I am extremely sad that she didn’t win. Congresswoman, don’t give up. American needs u!

@AndrewUSA1776 @LindseyGrahamSC After everything he had to say tonight at the hearing. We needed someone to speak the truth. I don’t think officials should get as heated and scream as he did, but right now we needed it. Graham spoke his truth and I agree with him 100%
I love you @LindseyGrahamSC
@SenThomTillis had to say great things about Judge Kavanaugh and many facts to back them up. Senator Tillis, you are doing an amazing job representing the United States as well as the great state of North Carolina. Confirm Kavanaugh!!
Got him. https://t.co/AoZoaKld8e
Rest In Peace John McCain. Your sacrifice for our freedom everyday will never be forgotten. My prayers are with your family.
Oh so I would assume you’re focused on Hillary Clinton’s emails and her jail time too? Or does that not matter since she’s not the President of the United States? https://t.co/FpkFnrGAcP

Gina Haspel just passed her Senate confirmation to become the next CIA Director. An overly qualified candidate, the first woman ever, and an amazing world leader and now our CIA director. Congratulations Gina!
You’re right! So do the job you promised and give it to them. Don’t keep letting our wonderful teachers and students down @NC_Governor https://t.co/qLWIB5vFzK

Our teachers here in NC deserve the best just like all teachers. Now, may I ask @NC_Governor, what have you done to help our teachers? Pat McCrory didn’t do anything to help them but you promised you would. But what have you done since taking office 2 years ago? We need change!
Jeff Flake has come out against CIA nomination, Gina Haspel. It’s a shame. Flake has been failing the Republican Party, Arizona, and the United States too many times. Glad he’s retiring! Hope to see Martha McSally take his seat come November!
The Senate Intelligence Com. has claimed that Russia interfered to help Trump. Though there is no official proof I do agree. Russia did interfere and I do believe it was to help Trump but Trump was not aware of this. He didn’t want this. Russia just wanted to hurt our election.
Great job of bringing millions of jobs to our economy. The job economy is not crumbling like it was under Obama. Trump promised jobs and he has been, is, and still will provide millions more. This Farm Bill is a step in the right direction for welfare reform.

@jontester is a great, honorable man but not the greatest Senator! He has worked hard for bipartisanship but can’t pass the big bills like Obamacare reform. Matt Rosendale is here to fix that!

The House Farm Bill is a very good reform bill. This bill is another step in the right direction to welfare systems reform. The welfare system in America is completely broken and must be fixed to get capable Americans back to work. This bill is another step in the right direction
Very proud at @realDonaldTrump for removing us from the Iran Nuclear Deal. The deal was an absolute bust for us and was sided on way. One of Obama’s many failures as POTUS.
@RepGallagher @RoKhanna are pushing for Congressional term limits, something that is needed in America. Khanna is an extremely progressive Democrat and I do not agree with most of his stances but this is one of them. I hope he, and Rep. Gallagher can work together to achieve this
@RepMarkMeadows is right. We must audit the Mueller probe and make sure the money is being spent right. I trust Robert Mueller and believe he is doing the job he was set out to do but you can never be too safe. The GAO must make sure the money is being spent right.
Sorry for all the inactivity lately! I’m back and ready to keep tweeting! 👍🏼
@RepSwalwell wants to buy back all assault weapons owned by law-abiding Americans. Yes, gun reform is needed in this country but according Swalwell himself, it would cost the American taxpayers almost $15 billion. Dems argue for gun reform but can’t even come up with a good way.
I would like to endorse @ToddRokita for the United States Senate. Rep. Rokita is an excellent choice for the Republican Party and it would be wonderful to see him replace the under working @SenDonnelly who has failed Indiana and the United States many times. Good luck Todd! https://t.co/U0x2H4Z8bB
Not having Congressional term limits is a thing of the past. Limits should be in place for all elected legislative officials. I stand with @RepGallagher and the other bipartisan members who met with the President yesterday to discuss this. 8 years for House, 12 for Senate.

Decriminalizing marijuana has its pros and cons. Pros would be the FDA would be able to regulate what’s put in it, it would boost the economy, and bring more jobs. Cons are simple. It’s a gateway drug and it legalizing it will do nothing to fix the opioid crisis in America. https://t.co/0Q7CgIN9MM
