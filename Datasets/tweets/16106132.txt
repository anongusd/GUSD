Anyone know what time zone Jesus is on? I need to plan out my day around the rapture.
@bowiechick aww that's so sad. I'm sort for your loss. Just lost one of my sugar gliders a couple months ago. It hurts. :(
I did feel sorry for the lakers until they became sore losers. #gomavs

My little guy is the next chuck norris. He loves giving a round house kick to my ribs. #nextchucknorris
Time is flying! Is it possible to be pregnant a little longer than 9 months...maybe like 18?
I'm not ready for my little monkey to be born yet.
Ahhh dang it! At&t is buying tmobile. Time to switch phone service providers.
I'm sooooooo full! Tim made me a yummy salad. I just have no portion control.
Ugh! One of my cats or dogs just farted and it stunk up my whole bedroom.
Oh....prayers for Japan and all other places being affected by the tsunami.
I'm so glad its Thursday. That means chiropractor appt. tomorrow. Not fun doing 2 things that make me sore for a week.
Cant wait for dinner! My Timmy made some awesome salsa and chicken.
Wow I'm exhausted after only walking around the North Texas Irish Festival for an hour. All Micah's fault lol.

Lauren Turner is awesome too! Good thing I don't normally vote. I wouldn't know who to choose. I think Micah likes Lauren, he's kicking!
I missed the last half of the guys on American Idol last night. Of what I saw I liked scotty and the guy with the curly red hair.
Karen is good too, but I still like Naima best!
Wow Naima is my pick so far!
R.I.P. Zoey. You were my first sugar glider. It took a long time to bond, but I'm glad we had the time together we did. Love & miss you!
And if your wife finds out and wants a divorce don't blame it on anyone but you.
If you flirt with any woman and she doesn't respond chances are she doesn't like you. You really shouldn't be flirting with a married 1 tho.
I thought my life was set up so I was completely free of stress and drama. Today proved me wrong.
I love opening all the windows but my nose hates me for it.
I wish I could take a stronger allergy medication. I keep sneezing and coughing my head off.
Ahhhh what am I going to wear to church. I have very few clothes that fit me now. Micah is getting so big!
Learning how to lose sleep and still function.
Sorry its late news. I got a new phone, but ITS A BOY!
Hopefully the baby cooperates tomorrow for the sonogram. We are finding out Boy or Girl!!!
Come on warm weather...I need you!!!
BTW everyone should have a chiropractor. I LOVE mine. I feel so nimble!!!
Had a muscle spasm last night that hurt so bad I thought I was dying. Chiropractor tmrw.
New sonogram tomorrow! I'm really nervous.
@karenalloy I'm barefoot!!! OH NOES!!!
It snowes in TX and I'm stuck on bedrest. Oh well its pretty from the window.
I'm already getting that delirious mother protection thing.
Oh my I know its not very nice of me but I think I'm going to punch a pillow and imagine its a certain some1s face!
2nd trimester already so the throwing up can stop now! Puh puh please!!!!
Merry Christmas
Thank you God for giving me an awesome husband who knows exactly how to handle crazy people!
Who starts crying because of food and then laughs at blowing their nose? Crazy people!
Oh my its almost Christmas!
Nothing worse than being sick and not being able to take meds.
First sonogram today! I'm so excited and nervous.
Omg I can SEE!!! I got my glasses!
I should not have to be subjected to that unhealthy habit...pregnant or not! I'm so angry I'm crying.
I can't comprehend why anyone would not understand that smoke is bad for you and everyone around you.
To all the smokers out there don't get bent out of shape when someone pregnant doesn't want to be around you! GEEZ!!!
Oh wow I meant glasses!
I ordered hillary duff glass rofl. They just looked good on my shape face.
DON'T THROW UP!!!
You get one cat upset and its a chain effect on the rest of my pets. It was a hiss bark hiss fest.
No throwing up today!
I'm annoyed today, not for any particular reason. Just annoyed ugh.
Yay think you guy who turned the power back on.
Come back sun!!! I need you!!!
Its getting dark outside...WAAHHHH
I need to not watch scary movies while I'm pregnant. I assume those things will happen to me. Like the power goes out, thought some1broke in
The power just got turned off...I'm scared!
So funny watching my brother and sister play little big planet!
Yay l'm no longer a squatter. The house closed. Now its time to party! Wooohoo!!!
Sitting in the new house alone and bored.
Breaking the law... well sorta
Moving wore me out and we aren't really even done.
Moving day....
Having a bad gag day. Why on thanksgiving? :( Hope you are all having a better thanksgiving then me!
I never laughed so hard I puked until just now.
I guess my dog knows I'm pregnant. She absolutely will NOT leave my side for anything. Problem is her smell makes me sick to my stomach.
Didn't know that the dump was having a huge sale. Perfect for right before we move.
I love shopping instead of packing!!!
I can't wait to move. Hopefully farther out of the city people will not blare their base in a residential area. "So dumb, fo real"!
BURP!
I used to have really wimpy burps and now I can burp better than anyone I know.
Sick day again...my stomach hates me.
I just ate the best ice cream I have ever tasted and just found out its a limited batch. NO Ben&Jerrys you must continue snikerdoodle cookie
Ok fine I ate those stinkin crackers.
Hmm I never feel hungry which makes it hard to eat. By the time I realize I need to eat I get naseous and really don't want to eat.
The only thing that makes the morning sickness away is saltines. BTW I'm not a fan of saltines.
Craving of the day KFC!!!
I'm Pregnant!!! Sorry you are last to find out.
Moving sucks especially the part of going through all your stuff and weeding out junk.
Tim and I are going to move in with me mum!
TRICK OR TREAT!

My A/C can't keep up with the heat. I want to go swimming so bad, but I can't because of the tat. http://twitgoo.com/1fzreb

My mom is a life saver! She is letting us borrow her jeep for the week while we get betty fixed.
Came back from vacation to my car (betty boop) dying. Its so sad and stressful.
I loves it when I have good peaceful convos with my dad! Doesn't happen all that often.
Can't wait to watch the gates tonight! I hope James's character will be back on the show soon.
@cheeks420 that sounds awesome. I love phase 10.
Woohoo I won!!!
Power is on, but now we are in a serious game of phase 10. ITS ON!!!
Oh man its getting hot in this tiny apt. I just came back from the heat and humidity. I WANT A/C!!!
...random power outage. What's up with that?
Sleepy sunday with my timmeh! He won't tell me what he wants me to cook for his bday. Suggestions?
I won't spam you guys anymore. Back to real life...boring and not much to talk about.
Ok turning off phone. Coming back to Dallas...if we didn't have babies waiting there we might not come home.

I'm not trying to be rude, but does anyone really want someone else planning their whole vacation?
I wish it wasn't my last night here. There's still so much I want to do.
Got pictures of kissimmee signs! Now forward ho to the aquarium.

I'm so angry with myself for spending the money on this purse. http://twitgoo.com/1et5c1
Oh here is my tattoo! http://twitgoo.com/1esz0x
So I can't go swimming or anything because of the tattoo. Btw the beach isn't as fun when you can't swim. I got drenched in sweat and sand.
Going to meet up with a friend for lunch in Sarasota. Anyone know of any cool little shops or touristy things to do around there?
What to do today? Beaches, museum, or shopping?
I got my first tattoo today! I will try to figure out how to put the picture on here later.
We were going to go to honeymooners island today, but exhaustion and sun burns won't allow it. I guess a day of shopping will fill the void.
The beach in Boca Grande is so beautiful. We saw a manatee come up like 5 ft from us. Had such an awesome time, but the sun cooked us.
Had a great night at Nanine's birthday party last night. She has made some awesome friends here in Florida.
I'm in florida babyyyyyy!!!!!
So I'm packing to go on vacation to Florida. I couldn't decide what to pack, so almost my whole wardrobe has been packed!

@cheeks420 omg you saw brandon lol
Why is it that people can't be mature and work out their problems for themselves? Why do they come to me and Tim to fix it for them?
Happy Mother's Day to all the moms. I hope to be one someday.
What's a scent from childhood that is comforting to you? Mine is cover girl powder. My mom always gave me hers when it was almost gone.
Need to hurry up making this blanket. The cat keeps fighting me over my favorite blanket.
I'm having a tough time staying on a consistent sleeping schedule. Tim needs a daytime job asap. My body can't handle being awake all night.
Tim just said in his sleep "Craig is going to be gone for a few hours." When asked who craig is he replied "the sand" lol
I feel like I'm getting no where knitting this blanket. It just seem like an endless amount of stitches.
Stop being sick Christeena.
The man and his fiance are like family to me. All I can do is say goodluck finding a job in the business of all the people you screwed over.
Lol this guy fired a man and his fiance. Then lost his job. He has been unemployed over a year and is now asking the same man he fired 4 job
@karakillmer isn't Seth a bit of a freeloader? Why is he always in the house?

Random early morning factoid: I have a pair of black stretchy pants I have worn since I was like 14. I'm 24 now.
You may think you are cool because you can play your music real loud in your car. I just think you are annoying and it sounds bad.

Managed to get everything we wanted. Thanks for praying...there's not a scratch on my body. Now to get out of the parking lot.
Black friday begins...pray tim and I live through it

Please pray for my mimi. She is in the hospital and in a lot of pain.
Sinus shot thing has me feeling soooo much better!!!! Now on to government reading.
Total doc visit including shot and meds was only $78 bucks. Thank you Lord! Tim and me were both expecting at least 200
That shot didn't hurt at all. Had to pull down my pants a little though. That was awkward lol.
Hanging out at the doc office. About to get a shot. Also this doc is awesome and gave me a bunch of samples.
@bowiechick I need an email to send the invite to can you DM it to me
Dude I think I just got a google wave invite...this is like being part of an exclusive club haha
Over 25 min wait for sushi and it was a to go order! A place I won't be back to.
Not a big fan of hinduism or even studying it for that matter. Don't mean to offend anyone but its not my thing.
His are like a water spout and he has to hover over a toilet till they stop. Mine isn't that bad, but it has been off and on for over 2 hr
I never get nose bleeds. What is this happening to me? I don't really know how to deal with them either because when Tim gets them...
Now onto hinduism and buddhism. The 2 religions I know the least about. Which means I will have to study hard.
That was the deepest sleep I have had in awhile. I'm awake now though.

Woke up feeling like I got run over...feeling a little better but not much.
I have to join the band waggon! I absolutely do not like the new facebook. Also myspace and facebook should not merge.
I have the door open...something smells really pretty outside. Wonder where the pleasant smell is coming from.
Going your way. Grow some courage and stand up for your beliefs. You are representing a whole state.
Some of the ways the legislature does things seems a little immature for professionals. I mean seriously hiding out because things aren't..
I will say this: it seems to me a good way to train for a spot in legislature is reality shows like survivor or big brother. Popularity wins
Reading about Texas legislature and its not making a lot of sense to this brain. I must not be in the mood for this information.
Time to get going on tons of school work for this week and next. That means shaiya might get neglected. Just when I reached level 40 :(

Are giant squids real? Tim doesn't think so, but I'm pretty sure a couple years ago I read something about them.
Cute play overall...some fumbling lines, and audio problems though. I want to watch the movie now! Its been awhile and its good in october!
Intermission over...back to the show in Act 2!

To all prof. Out there in twitterland....group projects are not cool at all. It just causes tension with the students.
Why can I not send a mass email considering I just helped you get a good grade because you were not going to step up and do it yourself.
Even though as a group we were not supposed to get that credit because directions were not followed. I'm sorry but I must be doing it right.
To the person who felt compelled to respond to my mass email and give false information THANKS! I wonder why I got xtra credit last time...
Out of 28 people doing this assignment 2 of us once again had to bail the rest of you out. Thanks for being slackers!

I'm a barrel of opinions today. Normally I'm very sympathetic, but not today.
How about putting me in a hotel. I was born here and have never done anything illegal.
That's going to make it harder for Tim and I to get Visas to the UK. Why make it illegal if you are going to give them every comfort....

Tim fell asleep and I was having such a good time :(
Heming a shirt I made. I'm excited to almost be done with it!
Missing my friend Nanine. I hope she's able to figure everything out!
Timmy went to go get a new tire because we got a flat on betty boop. Now that I'm done catching up on tweets, what to do?
@cheeks420 I have the same issue. I'm always drawn to black and white.
Anyone know of any theatre shows I can go to this month that aren't going to kill my budget? I have a theatre critique to do for a class.
Tim made fun of me because I cried watching the office. I just love weddings!
The nobel peace prize just lost all its meaning and glory. That man hasn't done anything yet to promote peace.

Everyone with sidekicks is really stressing right now! Tmobile why did this happen?
Tmobile...anytime now would be great. I mean its great you took money off my bill, but seriously I want service.
Saw a lot of cool stuff at the Modern Museum of Art in Fort Worth. My 2 favorites; book with wings, and Aschemblume.
So wasn't ready to wake up. Going to an art museum today though.
Still no service Tmobile? Why?
Tmobile you are very unimpressive. Why am I paying for something that doesn't even work. I want to be able to use net and IM.
Watching episode 4 now on www.ineedpopcorn.com
Never seen starwars. I want to though. I'm more nerdy now than I ever was. Weird how that happens.
I wish this dizzy spell would go away. It's making things difficult.
Woke up super dizzy. I don't know what's wrong with me, but this room won't stop spinning. I can hardly move my head :(
Listening to Tim tell his mom about the UK.
@cheeks420 that would be awesome. If we do move it will be about a year from now. I have to get a lot taken care of before then.
Wow I went to check the mail and got back right before it started pouring. Thank you God!
@cheeks420 that's the plan is to travel every weekend.
@cheeks420 I want to move there!!! Wanna join me haha

Please pray I do better on tonight's test. I'm serious 58 is not going to cut it.
I burned 220 calories today. Was about to not even do the elliptical. I'm glad I did!
Didn't want to wake up today. I want to be lazy.
The season premiere of House was pretty good! I love psychoanalysis type stuff. The power of human connection is unbelievable!
Having trouble staying awake to read my Government book. Sometimes this stuff just get redundant.
Starting to vlog on my new channel. Www.youtube.com/kissmeteena thanks @bowiechick for the inspiration!
Anybody know of some good places to live in the UK? I'm trying to do some research.
Having fun playing with my Dad about how old he is today! Haha he is an old man, but he says that makes me an old woman.
Also have to go to the school to withdraw from my world lit. class. I'm sorry but prof. you don't get paid for me to teach myself.
Too much to do today. Just found out there's a savings account in my name that closes tomorrow if I don't add to it. Ex step parents*rolleye
92 on my govt test today! I have one tomorrow and Wednesday too.
I love @mellyjhart outfit...so cute!!!
@bowiechick I have an old laptop no sound though haha
Told my mom we are thinking about moving to the UK and she got said she would miss seeing grandbabies.
Was a slow day but I still burned 180 cals.
@karenalloy by asking the question you are obviously hoping to be respectful to another's ethnicity. Ignore their hatred.
We need a revolution in the U.S. or Timmy and I are considering moving to another country. Everyone should watch Sicko!!!
Having a disagreement with Timmy. He thinks he hasn't seen Bowling for Columbine. I know for a fact he has.
I might do Yom Kippur next year... Tim said he would punch me in the nose if he couldn't eat, and laundry really needs to be done.
I guess I will do laundry and work on next weeks grocery list. Sound like fun?
@cheeks420 I have 2 silly kitties. They are fun!!
Neko likes to throw all the kitty liter out as soon as there's a clean box and swept floor. Silly kitty, that's not nice.
Feeling very bored, but unmotivated. What to do, what to do?
I hope I feel better tomorrow. I keep falling asleep, and all I want to do is spend time with my Timmy
Juice box yay
@cheeks420 that mask is so pretty. Have fun!!
Not feeling very good today. Taking it easy. So much for going to the Holocaust museum. :(
I'll show you your's if you show me mine...cards that is...wait what?
Lol @timmyboy234 makes me laugh and sends me silly texts
182 calories all gone!!!
@bowiechick where we can learn to work and play, and get along with eachother
Just watched Arthur...loved that show when I was a kid!!! I think I still love it. Tim and I were singing along the theme song.
I want doughnuts...glazed...and...hmm...pumpkin pie...make it happen!
Whew that arts appreciation test was tougher than I thought it would be.

@cheeks420 I got my elliptical on craigslist for free it just needed a new part
Thank you @timmyboy234 for fixing my elliptical! I'm sorry I don't feel like it now, but I will enjoy it.
Might drop a class because I don't want to teach myself. I thought professor's were supposed to teach.

Now on to kyle and trina's
Had "the talk" about babies with Tim....eh
Went to a friend's art show... I guess I don't understand modern art...just sayin
Is it still going on @dallastwestival
And he came right back after he realized it wasn't safe to drive...I try to tell him a woman's intuition is almost always right but NOOO...
Am I wrong in thinking its better to stay home when it rains if you don't have to go somewhere and your wife is sick? Ugh
I feel so ugh...I guess I'm officially sick. Its been a long time coming.
I was at school. Someone mentioned something about it between classes. I had no idea what they were talking about. Then we all were scared.
And um this is the 2nd time this week the power randomly went out. Don't they know it's bad on my new computer to do that.
But real kids next door instead of immature adults next door are so much better! So I'm not going to complain.
I'm awake I'm awake! Bad thing about naps is maybe not everyone is taking them and they can yell outside your door and startle you awake...
Nap time anyone?
Thanks its awesome that my pastors are now on twitter @PsRobertMorris and @PsDebbieMorris
This is really cool... http://bit.ly/2JQk0s
This stinks the Dallas Twestival is on the same day as Alvaro's art show. Maybe we can do both...fingers crossed
I couldn't take it anymore. I'm wearing stinky bug spray inside.
One more bite and I'm going insect repellent crazy! Try me Mr. Mosquitto...try me
I keep getting bit by mosquittos even though I haven't gone anywhere. How are they getting inside?
Ok now its nap time since @timmyboy234 and I were up till 6:30 last night

I always have trouble getting motivated after my lunch break. Next up is an essay about a painting.

Feeling intimidated by all the papers I have to write. Ugh
Crap got locked out of a quiz for some stupid reason. Now I have to email my prof. who is usually a jerk when I email him.
Ugh I'm not excited its monday. I'm nervous about everything I have to do for school. I really want to succeed but I may have overloaded
Woke up with a lamp falling on my head. Talk about rude awakening.

Night before the toadies concert tomorrow and I feel like crap. Hopefully tomorrow I feel better because I'm not missing it!

Excited about @iiiiiii tonight! I don't get to go often enough :(
Uh oh no allergies today...puh puh please
In public schools they only teach things for the standardized tests. There is a lot more to learn to be able to be successful in our society
I think people who don't at least take basics in college are deprived. I have learned so much that they never taught in grade school.
Just realized how swamped with school I'm going to be this semester. I have only seen the due dates for 2 classes. This could be bad :(
Had my lunch, back to school.
Had my first technical issue with school today. Luckily my awesome prof. was able to help me figure it out.
Started school, but some of my classes are missing on my blackboard thing. I can't access them. I hope its fixed by tomorrow.

Kind of excited...I may have made a new friend that's a girl. That never happens
@bowiechick I'm feel ya on that one, but I don't think you are a loser.
I really really like Tartuffe! It has a really good moral.
If someone were to walk in on me they would laugh, but it's a lot of fun to use different voices for each character in Tartuffe.
I take that back haha Tartuffe is a play. So I'm watching it play out in my head.
First up it's 1664 and Jean-Baptiste Poquelin Moliere is going to read to me Tartuffe in my salon with other intellectuals.

My other cat while playing with the one who wants outside just jumped over me and kicked me in the head. What is wrong with these animals?

Wow spent $190 in groceries, but got a bag of jack's links free with a coupon. So I guess it was worth it?
Flat tire on the side of the highway...good thing @timmyboy234 was with me when it happened. I'm so clueless about these things
So close to the finish line!!!!
Just have my bedroom left and then I'm done for the day. Well maybe...
I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere...this carpet is going to be clean enough to lick when I'm done. Although I don't recommend it.
If you only knew what hid in your carpet.....you'd probably throw up.
Haha I love watching the kitties walk on the freshly steamed floor. They walk really carefully like they aren't sure where its safe to step
Steam cleaning the carpets is hard work...I barely got anywhere and I'm tired already

Having major allergy attacks today. I guess I'm going to be sick next week.
I'm so angry! My only owner is my God. No country will own me. #American: Freedom to Fascism
@JGaspard thanks for tweeting about America:Freedom to Fascism my hubby and I are actually going through some trouble getting our refund now
@heynadine enter me in your contest to #winfreewebcams
I'm pretending I have something very profound to say that will change your life!
Tim and I have no money to pay bills. Stupid IRS!
So when are we going to impeach this liar. We are not a muslim nation. Obama needs some history lessons, as well as some current statistics.
Went to the No Doubt concert a few days ago!!! I love them. I have since I was 14 and will continue to love... http://tinyurl.com/qk8w8e
Had one of those life flashes before your eyes moments driving home. A huge truck trailor decided to swerve into my lane at the last second.
Silly kitty don't you know that I will be less generous with my attention if you wake me up 3 and a half hours early.
I need to get in gear. It's time to step up and get things done.
I love @timmyboy234 and my animal children...we're such a great family!!! Neko was so cute waking me up this morning hehe
@bowiechick I'm Chrissy
Watching gossip girl lol I'm a dork
I'm fed up with the IRS! Where's our tax refunds? It's been 5 months and you are saying it could be another 6 to 8 weeks. No that won't do.
RT  @Timmyboy234: If a+b= and c x d=b and d=48 and b+c = 4 wat does a equal
Being driven crazy by the bite on my toe
Mosquito bites on the toe are no fun...it's all swollen and itches a lot
Thought about making a creme brule frappicino, but my legs hurt from yesterday.
Lazy day today after an action packed day yesterday.
My throat hurts....I think I screamed more than I ever have in my life...in case you didn't know No Doubt has been my favorite band since 14
The No Doubt concert was FLIPPING AWESOME!!! I haven't had that much fun in along time. They played all my favorites.
I stood in line for the bathrooms for like 10 min and come out to a packed place...everyone wants to see no doubt
Yay, stopped to buy a blanket..ate some subway..got some frapps...now at the concert!!!!
Got here with 10 minutes till the ticket booth closes. Hopefully we made it in time. Gotta go get a blanket. Our brand new chairs not allow
Running late to pick up our tickets for the concert. Going to be praying we get there in time.
Preston is moving soon, and might move to Arkansas. If he does we can only commit to seeing him once a month.
Had fun at #bigbrothersbigsisters picnic. Preston went swimming, played bingo, got a bunch of books. This might be our last weekend with him
So we are finally on our way to pick up Preston. The picnic started at 11:30 and it is now almost 12:30. We are never very punctual
Neighbors are being loud again. Hoping Tim calls the police. One more written report and they will be asked to move out.
Looking forward to a jam packed day tomorrow...big brother's bis sister's picnic with Preston and then No Doubt concert!!! YAY!!!
Veggie kabobs and mimosas equals pure bliss lol
Going to Kyle and Trina's now. I love playing their Wii! Tim put together some veggie kabobs for me to grill. I'm excited!!
@timmyboy234 forgets to brush his teeth regularly and that could end up costing a lot.
Used the little wisps toothbrushes I got with a coupon...I don't know about them though. They are a ok, but would get expensive.
Just saved $10 off of $150 grocery bill...but we had to get some stuff for the concert and stuff for the grill tonight at Kyle and Trina's
I'm so done with this whole traffic tickets stuff with Tim. I think the whole system is ridiculous. Tim is a good driver.
It's errands day...taking tim to courthouse to pay for tickets, going shopping, gotta get some lawn chairs for no doubt concert yay
But I want cookie dough ice cream babe
Wondering what I should do today
Make this pain stop!!! I don't like being a woman sometimes.
Waiting outside for Tim
That was a bit scary driving in the stormy weather
Thinking about waking up from nap...
Taking a nap...hopefully I will feel better after
I feel completely yucky...boo hoo hoo!
Ok so I was a little pesimistic...it's not so bad
Normally I'm not bored with guys, but I don't know. These guys are different
Going to friend (jesse's) house...probably going to be bored out of my mind because I will be the only girl with a bunch of guys
Tim and his brothers had some food poisoning or something from 7/11 slurpees.
Clipping coupons again today. All you magazine has a ton. This is pretty fun.
Memorial Day! We should thank them everyday, but at least they have one day they are thought of. Happy memorial day!
I've become a coupon clipper...a friend told me one time because of coupons she went into the store and walked out with a bag 4 only $1.45
To all the idiot drivers out tonight...cool it...there's been too many friends of mine who have died in car wrecks and I don't appreciate it
Busy day today. Went to see my Mimi in the hospital, hung out with Preston's family, and now off to Forney(the country) spend night w/friend
Please pray for one of my old co worker's family. His neice and daughter have died, and his wife and 2 y.o. are in critical condition.
Wakin up a little early today it seems.
Looking forward to cheese lasagna, but it takes so long to make. I haven't had lasagna in forever!
@timmyboy234 I love you too babycakes!
@timmyboy234 stop saying stuff like that on twitter. You know it is public, and anyone can read it!
So lazy today...blah
Tweet tweet!
Just want to say @timmyboy234 is the best husband ever! I love hanging out with him, and starbucks this morning was so much fun!
Reading Ezekiel...the angels sound more like aliens, but I would be interested in seeing one
Not having cable sucks...I never noticed until I actually tried to watch my T.V. Stupid fox won't come in and I'm trying to watch #Glee
Takin a nap...
Kind of interested in this Glee show. Hmm
Sometimes these animals drive me nuts. Neko please stay out of the kitchen when I'm making food.
Just got the book The Soloist in. I'm excited to read it and then go check out the movie.
I haven't bought the tickets yet. If you would like to go with us let me know by tonight.
Yay getting tickets for the no doubt concert on the 30th...I'll be on the lawn but who cares
Tim is so sweet! He's the best, and I love it when he makes me half sandwich half soup.
My best friend lives in LA and I can't get ahold of her
Weird earthquakes here and now in California...hmm
Please pray for my Mimi she's going to have surgery tomorrow.
If you try sending someone with Tmobile a picture message they won't be able to view it...try sending an email instead...wishing for iphone
Tim is so weird lol
Just found out today is a friend's 21st birthday. So we are heading over to his house.
@xsamanthanicole that's not baby sitting that's what I call easy money...hehe
This is such a great message! RT: @bobhamp: Just posted a new blog entry: http://cli.gs/3LPM5E
Kind of sad. Our little brother Preston with #bigbrothersbigsisters is probably moving out of state soon. His family is now our family.
Too bad I don't have my iphone yet. I would be sending you pictures of the game. All I have is this stinky sidekick ID boo.
They just threw the angels pitcher out for hitting the rangers batter. CRAZY!
On our way to the Ranger's game. Preston said "I spent all my money on this yo-yo. What a rip off!" Funniest thing I've heard from a kid.
ThermaCare thing on my back. I'll let you know if it works. I have a feeling it won't. I need it to though because going to Ranger game.
Wow Tim and I woke up with a bang. It felt like there was an earthquake and the kitties got scared. One tried to poop in our bed.
@wfaaweather and @wfaaweathertoo was there just an earthquake near the DFW airport?
@prestonmorrison it's kind of a fad for younger girls, but mostly short dresses.
And he finally woke up because the water faucet sputtered. Then he scared me because I thought he was sleeping. And then a tickle fight!
Been having some problems with my back lately. Anyone know something I could do besides going to the chiropractor? I don't have the money.
Tim's friend from work's wife just had a baby! Aww
Tim doesn't want to wake up so I tickled his nose and armpit and he's still sleeping. I guess I will leave him alone then.
Had an awesome sandwich!!! I should share the recipe for the spread.
I love making food with the hubby even if he gets a little nerdy sometimes...haha

I'm hungry, but I think I will wait to eat...watermelon is kicking my butt right now
I have a few prayer requests. My mom needs prayer finding a job, my grandmother is in the hospital, and Tim wants the mavericks to win. THX!
@wfaaweather oh please make the hot sun go away lol
How do you meat lovers eat that stuff. I mean it tastes good but I kept getting it stuck in my throat.
Shhh don't tell Tim....I ate his soup, oh and it had meat in it. I'm in big trouble!
To the people that wouldn't let me over until I crammed myself in on the highway.....you suck! I almost died because you wouldn't yeild
@jakefogelnest are you taking phone calls now?
Last day of school today!! Back to being a housewife...which I love!!!
@mememolly blue, pink, red, black, and silver are my favorite colors. Oh wait do I have to pick one?
Oops that was meant for my friend. This twitter thing is getting out of hand
We're here!
Change of plans...going to Nanine's house it's her last night here. Wearin my pjs because I don't feel like getting dressed again...haha
Well leaving my mom's and going back home. Please pray for my mimi. She is in the hospital and they don't know what's wrong.
@jillianyvonne lucky for having your family on twitter. Working on getting mine on here
Now on the way to my mom's after quizno's
Saw Tim's mom, and she rocked at guitar hero!
Tim's so upset. Poor baby
Tim's sad that the mavs lost...looks like I will have some consoling to do tonight
Staying off my feet for awhile. I have a lot of blisters from last night, and it hurts so much to walk.
Just got home. I'm ready to crash, but it was a really fun night! I miss my neener beener so much!
At a place called chill. I guess its fun...not really my scene.
Hanging out with Nanine! Going to wilhoites on grapevine main street. It will be just like old times.
Also I'm kind of freaking out. This is the most I have driven in like 4 years. So I'm having a moment of anxiety. Hopefully it passes!
Tim had to go get a new tire. I wasn't confident driving with the bad one. I pray he doesn't get pulled over though.
Some birds made a nest in the wall outside my apartment.The chicks are getting louder and louder everyday.
I'm so hungry!! Tim went to the store to get me some watermelon. I have the best hubby!!
Finally I'm on the last video. Next is the final. Wish me luck!
2 more to go! Yay and my best friend is back in Texas. We're going to Ihop tonight! Yay
3 more to go...last one was about Republicans...and Bush's face made me want to puke
4 more videos to go
I'm bored with these history videos. I should have spaced things out more. I have to watch 7 in a row before my final
With oprah's free KFC I wonder what's next. She's going to have numerous loyal followers, and then comes world domination. I'm scared
@DatAintRight sorry I didn't look until now. How did your final go? I will be taking mine tomorrow and Friday hopefully
I don't like driving in the rain. People drive crazy. I almost lost control of the car too.
If you are wondering why I said it was a stripper, I just guessed. It was 3 am and she got out of the car in flashy clothes.
I'm starting to actually like driving! I love jammin out with the moon roof open! Oh and I saw a stripper run into a guard rail haha
@bowiechick I would DM but you aren't following me. Why are you at the hospital? Are you ok?
I'm tired of having to pay all hubby's tickets. My car will never be legal if I have to keep paying all of those. Frustration...
Happy cinco de mayo!!!
I do believe this whole driving thing is getting easier. I was jammin out the whole way here!
Leaving to go pick up Tim now. Pray for me if you are still awake.
This history book confuses me. I thought we were already past JFK. In previous chapters he was assasinated and now we are going back before
@moonfrye Me and my cousin have a video of us singing a song from lion king, but I think my favorite was part of your world from lilmermaid
Phew I found it! That was a close one. I'm almost done with the semester. Not the time to be losing books.
Lost my history book! What am I going to do...need to study 3 chapters
Ok I got home by myself yay! Now at about 2am I have to go pick @timmboy234 up. I will need prayers then too.
OH NO! I don't want to drive...please @timmyboy234 don't make me! Ok I'm taking my dog and my bible for support. Pray for me!
I'm scurred!!! Have to drive Tim to and from work today. That means I will have to drive home by myself and pick him up by myself. Yikes!
Thinking about expanding my repertoire to Jazz. What do you think? Would I make a good jazz singer?
I'm movin on up...lol I'm at a swanky country club listening to a 20 piece jazz band
How do I get rid of mount monstrossity on my chin. It's been there 3 days and no head has appeared. It hurts so much :'(
I love lazy sundays with the hubby!! Going to some jazz show later...hmm what to wear?
Pimple forming on my chin...stop hurting me...please just go away because I don't like you
The movie passes we had didn't work at that theater. So we are at the library.

Lol my hubby is weird sometimes RT @Timmyboy234: I am taken a poo and singing to my wife
I miss my neener beener! I watched Bride Wars and cried because I should of been watching it with my best girl friend
I've been driving for 2 hours...it's scary, but I'm doing well
To get 4 sugar gliders, 2 cats, the dog, the hubby, and myself in the bathtub to be safe. Also I'm not sure how safe the 2nd story apt is.

Please go away Mr. Rain. My arms hurt because of you, and I'm too young to have arthritis. I'm not even sure that's how you spell it.
Good nap! This rain and stuff makes me all sleepy
Got a sore throat bleh...and I'm tired...taking a nap soon
Dang it I keep losing the back to my amethyst earrings. I'm just lucky they stay in without the back until I realize it.

Now my husband is holding neko in the air as a fly swatter. What a crazy family I have!
He is still playing in the window, and it probably looks hilarious from outside.
My animals keep me laughing all the time. Neko decided to go chasing a fly in the window and almost pulled down the curtains...
I'm blessed with the most wonderful people in my life. Preston brought me a flower from home earlier. It's so pretty!
Timmy is the best he went to the store and bought me all kinds of chocolate and creme brulee
Was in pain all night...took some heavy duty pain killer and have been sleeping ever since. Thinking about waking up now.
Guess where?...Chicken nair because chickens don't have hair

Having trouble writting a book journal for history. I would rather test over it. Just don't much like sharing my feelings over it.
Happy Earth day! Wish it was cooler outside so I could celebrate it without airconditioning.
It's Holocaust Remembrance Day. I'm going to take a a minute and give thanks that I'm not persecuted for my beliefs.
Tim made a new word for frost bite...ice farts hahahahahehehehe This is why I love that man!
I feel like I'm getting what my Timmy has :( yuck
Coloring and sad that my Timmy is sick
Today Tim and I are going to make a bottle rocket with Preston. I'm glad we are a part of #BBBS or big brothers big sisters.
Had a fun night with my unexpected trip to D&B and the night park with my dad, step mom, bro and sis. Bro and sis back to Lousiana tomorrow
My first test score was a 69 and my second was a 45. I'm pretty sure my last one would have been worse.
A little upset I just dropped a class. Statistics was way too advanced for me at this point in time. I only would have had 3 test grades.

Texas is from the word Tayshas which means friends. Hispanics changes it to Tejas, and then it became Texas. I'm a friend!
Government 2 chapters to read. Take both chap tests. Not too hard.
Easter was fun although I didn't get to see any of my side of the fam. Saw hubby's dad and mom and brothers.
Hubby's friend at work died this morning. Pray for his family please.
So my dilema over the past 3 days is resolved finally!
So I got the heels but they are a size too big, and I had to put 4 inserts in them. Hopefully that works tomorrow. I also drank pickle juice
Cutest thing ever. Earlier Preston told Tim not to use his debit card because he needs to save his good money. He said its bad to waste it.
This might be a little too personal, but I haven't pooped in 3 days. Hmm
Ok so no yellow boots, but on the hunt for these cute heels in my size. Every journeys store has heard Tim's voice pleading for me.
Had some much fun at the Fort Worth Stockyards! There were longhorns, goats, ducks, ice cream, guy on stilts, etc. Preston loved it too!
About to sit down and watch some movies with the hubby. Excited about the Easter egg hunt at stockyards tomorrow.
Went to the hospital to see Tim's friend. He's doing much better. Thanks for your prayers.
I need some yellow boots. Where can I buy some yellow boots?

Keep praying for my husbands friend. He is doing really bad.
Just confronted the woman next door. Told her she could do better than that guy, and that she deserves better.
I've just snapped a new picture: http://dailybooth.com/KissMeTeena/176337
Haha I'm a nerd. I mixed coffee, milk, and orange sherbert in a blender. It's actually not bad, and even more weird is that seems familiar.
I can record everything said without my door being open. So frustrated. I just want to live in peace.
Collecting evidence right now, even though the apt manager said it was handled. They have their door open and are talking loudly.
Today's Agenda: shower, history videos, history test, collect evidence, laundry, feed animals, etc.
@aplusk thanks for supporting Texas! I love my home state!
#seven my husband influenced my spiritual journey the most
#seven I read my bible daily to hear and find favor from God.
Not sure about these eggs I hardboiled. The date said no good after 3 15 09, but does that matter when they are hard boiled?
Please pray for my husband's friend Bryan. His kidneys are failing. He might not have much longer.
I think he's a brown recluse. Please save me!
The spider that I killed before, his brother is here to get me! I saw him and then he disappeared. I gotta get out or he will kill me.
Really excited for my mom! She's going back to school. She will be taking online classes like me!
In it my neighbor talks about stealing a couch. This might turn up more than just them being loud neighbors.
Tim suggested we record everytime our neighbor is loud on a digital recorder I have. Just got the first recording.
Will be traveling back in time to 1952 through 1974. Should be interesting!
Feeling super happy for no particular reason. Just thought I would share it!
@karijobe Happy Birthday!
How's everyone's Sunday night going?
I don't think I have ever slept so much in 24 hours, but I guess that's expected after losing sleep and getting sick
Just woke up, but not feeling too great. I think not getting sleep for over 24 hours made my immune system spaz. Feeling sick
Well since it seems like DallasTube fell through and I haven't slept in over 24 hours I will instead be catching some zzz's
@ocho01 are you at dallastube?
I have a front row seat to the show.
My hubby is so sexy when he works on cars. This is just like construction with one guy working and everyone watching. Hehe
If anyone is up that knows something about radiator leaks on 2001 cavalier, could you DM me? Bro in law has a serious problem.
Police man said he had a scholarship to Texas Tech but turned it down, and wished he hadn't.
Ok so the father in law just got pulled over. Was going 82 in a 65. Was let go with a warning because my bro in law goes to Tech.
Really want to go to DallasTube, but this trip to Abiline is kind of far. Not even sure DallasTube is still happening anyways.
Impromptu road trip to abiline tonight. Bro in law needs help with car. Pray that the crazies stay far from us, please.
I feel blessed my husband and I are sweet to each other. Life may not be perfect, but my hubby is the best!
Date night was awesome. Leaving I love you man a married couple with 5 kids was yelling at each other across the whole movie lobby.
Ravioli needs to tweet....because he doesn't enough
With hubby at Chilli's drinking a Grand Patron...didn't plan for it to be date night but I'm not complaining
@dataintright Are you still going to DallasTube tomorrow? I haven't heard anything about it recently.
Drinking Jason's Deli coffee not as good as my ginger lattes lol, but used raw sugar from hawaii
I probably no take that back...I bombed that statistics test. Failed the last one too. For anyone thinking statistics is easy,think again
Going to talk to the apt manager about noisy neighbors again. Wish me luck!
Wishes this classical station would stop talking and just play the music that helps me concentrate!
@DallasTube is it still on for this Saturday?
Nothing better than ginger lattes and billy holiday singing the man I love to help me study!
Time to get to work. It's hard to read a history book for hours. Good thing I figured out how to make ginger lattes.
Trying to get my dad to sign up for twitter. He's worried about identity theft. Anyone heard any cases of it?
Could use some ear plugs right now. I love kids, but not when they are screaming while I'm trying to study.
Sitting down to start my daily bible reading...after that I need to buckle down and read my history book I have a test in a week

Today's agenda: finish statistics, shower, family time, kitties treatments, lazy time with the hubby
Today's agenda: Spanish Test, Gabriel's treatments, a bit of statistics, coloring in princess coloring book, watching hulu...
Following our president @barackobama and found out about www.whitehouse.gov

@moonfrye I would want to see my husband first thing...he is my best friend and the only person in this world I completely trust
Had to take my kitty to the vet today. He has feline acne. Had to have his chin shaved and he cried so loud. Made me want to cry too.
I think I got high from the bug spray while cleaning the carpet.

Hubby wants me to test out his twitter!
Perfect example... psalm 59:1-5
The bible says God will bring down my enemies, and the wicked. Praise him! YAY
Also been reading psalms for the last 2 weeks. Funny because there's a lot about enemies in there. My next door neighbor is my enemy.
If the neighbor and his gf are there for more than 7 days they will be evicted. I told you it would happen by the end of the month!
Neighbor living in apt that his brothers name is on the lease=illegal, probably has a criminal record. Apt manager going to check ids
Also thinking of getting a restraining order, but how does that work when their front door is 5 feet away from ours?
Tomorrow going to apt office to get neighbors evicted...he crossed the line when he threatened us and called me a bitch
Thinking about getting The Love Dare Book, my marriage is not in trouble...but it can always get better...I like doing things special forhim
What did you do on spring break? I knitted a scarf for my dog. Too bad it's hot outside.

@aplusk I was expecting a bonus from my last job and didn't get it. Life went on. There are people without a job at all in our country.
I love knitting! It's so much fun and rewarding once you see it turn into something
@aplusk God rules my heart and Jesus is my Savior you won't convince me otherwise!!
Taught myself how to knit in 5 min...not very good at it but maybe it will take my mind of things...oh and Ashton and Demi...God Rules
Don't want to be a Debbie downer, but this greiving thing is too much to handle right now. I just want to be normal again.
I realize it was a holiday yesterday, but the festivities have ended. So let's celebrate your leaving!!! To mine enemies, beware!
To my unthoughtful neighbors...the cops were called by 2 different people on you...your days here are numbered
Had an awesome dinner with the hubby on his lunch break
I'm still sad...I had to force feed him and help him poop...much like I would care for a baby...now he's gone
Even more cheer came when I found out No Doubt will be in Dallas May 30th...I'm there!!!
Talking to a good friend helped to cheer me up...also some martini and rossi but shh that's on the down low
What do you do to cheer yourself up when you are down in the dumps?
&lt;--- depressed, a sugar glider that I hand raised died last night.

Just finished last assignment until the 27th. I can't tell you how much of a load off that is! Now over spring break I can get ahead.
If that's the case maybe we should slowly remove that system to help build back our economy...but I could be wrong...just thinking too much
After reading some stuff about the crash of 1929 and the great deperession, I'm wondering if maybe buying on credit led to those

And to the neighbors who party non stop...I'm making it my personal mission to have you evicted before the end of the month
I really like this Jane Addams chick! I want to read Twenty Years at Hull-House!! I think I kind of look like her even
I might be tempted to bash in your windows!
FYI neighbors...I'm studying! If your alarm goes off again and doesn't turn off quickly...
Finally done with that binomial probability crap...moving on to history
Crossing into the world of statistics..watched 21 last night and made statistics seem fun..but yeah right

@kadeclark that's true! But it's making me sleepy and I have 4 history chapters to read. No time to sleep
@kadeclark what are you talking about it's hot and dreary
Our papers had the same premise just not the same wording. So why is it that my grade was 10 points lower?
I had a 76 on a paper. The person who helped me through the paper made an 86. He's from Africa. WTF!
So pissed...I think my professor is judging my papers by either that I'm American or a female
