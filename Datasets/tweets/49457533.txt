@NeuCare @RepWesterman @FREOPP @dpcalliance @drleegross @AtlasMD @philsq The bill doesn‚Äôt categorize DPC as health plans.
@NeuCare @RepWesterman @FREOPP @dpcalliance There is a provision broadening the utility of HSAs (Section 113) for paying premiums that effectively also applies to DPC.
For more background on the policy concepts in @RepWesterman‚Äôs Fair Care Act, read our work at https://t.co/Ogl6g24rif. General health reform: https://t.co/ITpqseYpOQ Drugs: https://t.co/IVzzvMqNYb Hospitals: https://t.co/Rt1O2MHHpz @FREOPP
And finally, Title V helps patients regain control of their medical records, and modernizes outdated federal laws that prevented entrepreneurs from helping patients capture the value of their electronic medical data.
Title IV focuses on curtailing the power of hospital monopolies to exploit their pricing power through stronger antitrust and incentives to restore competition to consolidated markets (very similar to @RepJimBanks‚Äô Hospital Competition Act of 2019: https://t.co/zDXynLnraT).
Title III focuses on reducing prescription drug prices through competition: reducing barriers to biosimilars and complex generics; fast-tracking FDA review for diseases with low drug competition; curtailing artificial monopolies; indexing Medicare B payments to CPI; &amp; much more.
Title II focuses on Medicaid reform (optional block grants; option to partially replace Medicaid expansion with exchange-based coverage) and Medicare reform (means-testing, site-neutral payment, provider tax reform).
@RepWesterman @FREOPP Title I focuses on private insurance reforms that lower insurance premiums (HIT repeal, reinsurance, 5:1 age bands, et al) and promote more patient control of the health care dollars they spend, through HSAs and price transparency. Replaces Cadillac tax with standard deduction.

@Federalist_10 @charles_gaba @xpostfactoid @garcoak Quite the opposite. What conservatives opposed about the mandate was that it was an unprecedented federal requirement to participate in a certain kind of economic activity. Completely different from *allowing* price discrimination based on enrollment periods.

@furman87 @Forbes You seem to be measuring something different than what I‚Äôm measuring. It‚Äôs a free country!
@furman87 @Forbes Let‚Äôs say the average family has disposable income of $1,000, after cost of living and taxes. Let‚Äôs say that same family saw its hospital costs go from $12k to $15k. The economic impact of this on disposable income is not 25%. Hope that helps.
@dindunuffinyt In fairness to Obamacare, the rise in hospital spending per capita faster than inflation goes back to the passage of Medicare in 1965. Obamacare did make the problem worse but didn‚Äôt create it.

The fact that Lantus' prices haven't collapsed, the way they would if Lantus was a pill, is due to differences in the way generic pills are regulated by the FDA vs. for biologic medicines like insulin. I.e., this is a problem of overregulation.
Insulin was discovered in 1921. So what's going on? There has been some genuine innovation in development of synthetic insulins (e.g. Lantus + rapid-acting analogues) that do a better job of maintaining blood sugar. But Lantus' patent has expired &amp; should near commodity pricing.
.@SGottliebFDA is doing some good work on these issues, but ultimately Congress needs to act to solve these problems, especially by cleaning up the Biologics Price Competition &amp; Innovation Act of 2009 (a part of Obamacare).
The Competition Prescription (my drug pricing paper @FREOPP) has reforms for each area: 1. Limit Medicare drug reimbursement growth to CPI. 2. Reform FDA biosimilar regs to make them look more like normal generics. 3. Conditional approval for new diabetes drugs w/phase IIb data.
3. The FDA has drastically increased the cost of R&amp;D for diabetes and other diseases with high prevalence, requiring 20,000 patient multibillion-dollar clinical trials for drugs to be even considered for approval.
Insulin unit prices nearly doubled in the last 5 years. Why? 1. Manufacturers take advantage of the dependence of patients with chronic disease to jack up prices on drugs they can't discontinue. 2. The FDA has long failed to approve generic insulins. Competition &gt; monopolies. https://t.co/aZRlPkLpcx

For those who missed it over the weekend, my piece on the Texas Obamacare court case. Basic problem is a misunderstanding of how to cover people with pre-existing conditions: https://t.co/aIkUBus23l @Forbes
@bradwrightphd @mksheikh Not really. As I‚Äôve written (you really should read Transcending Obamacare before making all of these presumptions about my views), I‚Äôm fine with standardized benefits and AV tiers, though I want more flexibility than ACA.
@bradwrightphd @mksheikh Price transparency won‚Äôt work by itself because the median AV in the employer market is around 80%. You need price transparency and shopping around *insurance.*
@bradwrightphd @mksheikh A lot of methodological flaws in the studies you describe as ‚Äúevidence.‚Äù And the religious conviction that economics magically stop working when it comes to health care isn‚Äôt persuasive.
@mksheikh @bradwrightphd There‚Äôs a whole chapter on it in Transcending Obamacare. Check it out at @FREOPP.
@bradwrightphd @mksheikh That‚Äôs simply not true. To take one example, generic utilization and pricing in the US far outpaces other countries. I‚Äôm not opposed to more scrutiny around monopolies, though.
@bradwrightphd @mksheikh I write a lot about addressing the underlying costs of care. Competition far superior to price controls, but the status quo is unacceptable. See, for example, here: https://t.co/IVzzvMqNYb
@TuftsB My view is that people should be charged the same premium as everyone who is their age (i.e., shares their birth year). That addresses the issue you described with minimal market disruption.

Imagine if Warren is the Dem nominee in a year where the Harvard-Asian case is before the Supreme Court.
@DanHenninger It‚Äôs that fact that makes her a dream matchup for Trump and the voters who support him.
What this @DanHenninger piece entirely misses is how Warren used her claimed Native American ancestry to obtain a lucrative &amp; extremely-difficult-to-land spot on the Harvard faculty, at a time when Harvard discriminates against Asians &amp; low-income whites. https://t.co/2xkvalJVR6
On the latest #AmericanWonk @Ricochet, John Yoo and I talk about the consequential lawsuit being brought by Asian-Americans against @Harvard for racial discrimination in admissions: https://t.co/YWRVTwwwbr
Fortunately, some Asians are good at math, and can perceive that Harvard is full of cow dung.
In the last 20 years, the number of National Merit Finalists who are Asian has doubled, but the share of Asians at Harvard has remained constant. Which means, according to Harvard, Asians‚Äô personalities are getting significantly worse over time.
In its own defense against the allegations, Harvard‚Äôs expert claimed that the disparity is because ‚Äúwhite applicants have relatively stronger qualifications [than Asians] on non-academic dimensions‚Äù; i.e., personal qualities.
@WSJ As I‚Äôve said before, this is the very definition of ‚Äúinstitutional racism."
According to an internal report, Asians would comprise 43% of Harvard students if admission were based solely on academic merit. In reality, Asians represent 18% of enrollment. https://t.co/LdjsS4UTua via @WSJ

@awgaffney Wrong. That's not the question. The question is whether you prefer, as a method of fiscal consolidation, a more regressive tax code or a more progressive entitlement code. I'm arguing for the latter; you're arguing for the former.
@awgaffney And those European countries have far *less* progressive tax codes, principally because they use VAT as their principal revenue generator, which is disproportionately funded by the middle class.
@awgaffney As a result of the GOP tax bill, the share of federal revenue supplied by upper income deciles has increased, and the % of Americans with no net income tax liabilities has grown. I.e., a more progressive tax code.
@awgaffney Sorry, but that's a fiscally illiterate statement in a world in which medical inflation exceeds GDP growth (i.e. revenue growth). And we already have the most progressive tax code in the developed world, even more so after the recent tax bill.

I don't get worked up about standard-issue liberal media bias, because that's like getting worked up about oxygen in the atmosphere. But this is ridiculous.
Correction to point 2: I meant "only buy insurance when sick"
This is what David Brooks means when he describes the dumbing down of anti-Trumpers: https://t.co/sYIDGDjotl
5. The rule about preventing hospitals from steering patients to Obamacare instead of Medicaid is about hospitals engaging in FRAUD to make more money, because the exchanges have higher reimbursement rates.
4. Same goes for benefit design; improved benefit design reduces premiums and encourages more healthy people to enroll.
3. Trump's refining of network adequacy rules allow insurers to force providers to compete with one another on price and quality, reducing premiums and increasing quality.
2. Stricter verification of people signing up outside the open enrollment period is essential for the same reason. Obama allowed people to sign up outside OE without verification, which meant people could game the system and only buy insurance when healthy.
@jenhab @politico 1. Reducing the length of the open enrollment period limits gaming of the system, whereby people only sign up when they're sick. That helps lower premiums and increase affordability of individually-purchased insurance.
Since @jenhab is an informed &amp; intelligent journalist, I don't understand the mountains of dumb in this article @Politico. The policies described help stabilize the individual market and lower premiums. They don't "scrap" Obamacare in any way. https://t.co/SVRXPId1qK

Anybody who says that policies in this bill haven't been open for debate has been too busy obsessing over Russian collusion and not following the actual months-long policy debate on taxes.
@matthewjdowd I don't agree. There have been years of hearings about the kind of tax reform this bill reflect. I get that lots of people didn't bother to pay attention.
(In 2009 I mean)
A lot of the Dem critique of the tax bill reminds me of a lot of the GOP critique of Obamacare: generalities and shopworn talking points. Little engagement of specifics.
I have no problem with a substantive critique of any particular piece of legislation. But I care about the *policy*, and so do you, not the font. So let's stop with the trivialities.

@binarybits Of course not. But on @MSNBC one of the horror scenarios was Verizon allowing Yahoo more bandwidth at Google‚Äôs expense under @AjitPaiFCC‚Äôs proposal.

@JohnArnoldFndtn That was already true, if by better you mean reduced actuarial value / lower out of pocket costs.
@NPRinskeep In other words, the amount of federal spending will be roughly the same‚Äînot lower, not higher.
@NPRinskeep In addition, CBO model is highly speculative. Much more likely that there is a 1:1 replacement of CSRs for higher premium subsidies.
@NPRinskeep CBO $200B estimate is an artifact of CBO counting CSRs as part of its baseline. But premium subsidies will increase to compensate for CSRs.
@NPRinskeep Thanks for the qs. I‚Äôll go in reverse order. 1: ACA premium hikes 2013-17 are 100%+ on average for unsubsidized. This impact much smaller.
Far from ‚Äúsabotaging‚Äù or ‚Äúgutting‚Äù Obamacare, as various organs have claimed, taken together these orders will improve the marketplace.
Fourth: ending the illegal cost-sharing subsidies will have 0 effect on premiums and out-of-pocket costs for subsidy-eligible ACA enrollees.
Third: the EO on health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) will likely strengthen the individual market by allowing workers to shop there.
Second: the EO on short-term limited-duration insurance merely restores the rules that were in place for 7.5 of Obama‚Äôs 8 years in office.
First: the EO on association health plans will enable businesses to do things they can already do thru Professional Employer Organizations.

@greenfield64 There are other ways to cover the sick than by overcharging the healthy for insurance.
@greenfield64 Economically, the correct analogy is "I want fire insurance for my house and houses like it, not houses that are already burned down."
@KKobes15 That's not accurate. The spending increases every year before then.

@Neoavatara If they fix the single-payer issue, I think it‚Äôs a good bill.
@rorycooper Even worse was the perfect game blown by a bad call.
Which is better: block grants to states, or block grants to individuals?
@onceuponA Fair enough.
@onceuponA I don't think you're understanding the intra-conservative debate here--but that's ok.
@Gunntwitt @less_tx But it won't be the states. Under the bill, states will have to apply for waivers from DC; DC can choose not to grant them.
@onceuponA In the group market yes. In the individual market no.
Personally, I'd rather have a lower tax rate.
If the fed income tax rate was 100%, and DC then turned around and gave the money back to state governments, does that increase federalism?
Under Obamacare, the Feds don't have the choice of imposing single-payer. That's what the 2010 "public option" fight was all about. https://t.co/ehdK9viGcl
Put another way: if Graham Cassidy passes in its current form, more Americans will live under single payer than do under Obamacare.
Graham-Cassidy spends $200 billion a year‚Äî1/4th of the entire defense budget‚Äîon federal funding for the block grants. No state taxes needed. https://t.co/vLI76toHdd
True federalism would mean: states can tax their own residents to build single payer healthcare. Here, we're being forced to subsidize it.
@Neoavatara @jasonahart @BillCassidy The devil is in the details of allowed options, which tilt significantly left. Cassidy was trying to get Dem support hence this design.
@Jim_Kiner Read the Forbes article.
States' rights enthusiasts seem to forget that the 10th Amendment ends with the phrase "or to the people."
@Federalist_10 I'm no romantic. But if the q is, does this version of the bill expand individual freedom for most Americans, the answer is decidedly mixed.
Ah but the Cassidy block grants are not value-neutral. They allow full-on single payer but not full-on free markets. https://t.co/4HmTRFq8jG
@JDue51 This was awesome. Thank you!
The @BillCassidy plan has one big, but fixable, weakness: it enhances blue states' ability to expand single payer. https://t.co/ZWTfKs45DZ

Cruz amendment, if the final design gets it right, could add to that side of the BCRA ledger.
Because I only have 140 characters I am oversimplifying. But point is that BCRA makes meaningful progress on lowering premiums.
For example: $200/mo increased 100% is $400/mo. $400/mo reduced 25% is $300/mo (a net increase of 50%).
I appreciate that % math is nonintuitive. So to oversimplify: if you increase something by 100%, then decrease 25%, the net increase is 50%.

@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad In real life yes, not in CBO's model.
@Farzad_MD @LorenAdler I've done dozens of them. Check out my podcast with @ezraklein.
@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD The above explains why pretty much everything you say about individual insurance markets is wrong.
@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD Actually no. Assuming that Obamacare doesn't cause adverse selection is misleading.
@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad This is simply wrong. Sorry.
@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD "Holding age mix constant." LOL
@LorenAdler @Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad Sorry, but there is zero evidence to suggest the CBO would score it that way.
Obamacare has doubled premiums in the individual market. BCRA would lower premiums by 20-30%. Notable how much lefties avoid this topic.
@Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad CBO believes it doesn't matter whether BCRA has means tested premium assistance or CSRs; absence of mandate driving coverage effect.
@Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad Also: CBO says 15MM will drop out in 2018 due to mandate repeal. Subsidy changes begin in 2020. So don't blame subsidies for dropouts.
@Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad And BTW that deductible analysis assumes zero utilization of $136B in state grants for CSRs (Obamacare spends $95B on CSRs over a decade).
@Farzad_MD @roseperson @NanouTheNomad Sure. So a $695 fine won't make a difference.
@DanCGoldberg Remember that the Obamacare Medicaid expansion is replaced with tax credits to buy voluntary private coverage. No mandate=no buy, viz. CBO.
(12/X) After mandate repeal, CBO would be forced to score coverage provisions of GOP replacement under a voluntary insurance market.
(11/X) If GOP can't get majority for BCRA, an alternative approach would be mandate repeal as a standalone measure along w/BCRA reg reforms.
(10/X) CBO is obviously wrong about that. Hence GOP should focus on good policy and not defer to CBO on coverage estimates.
(9/X) The point: it doesn't matter how GOP tries to replace Obamacare. CBO will score it as covering &gt;20MM less, because of mandate repeal.
(8/X) "BCRA = -22MM covered because of fewer deductible subsidies" doesn't explain why full repeal w/o replace leads to same -22MM result. https://t.co/wv0j5cw6s8
(7/X) Given that majority of CBO mandate effect is outside nongroup market, effect can't be explained by adverse selection.
(6/X) Claiming GOP bill will "kick 22 million off their coverage" is either lying or ignorant. Voluntary decision for most according to CBO.
(5/X) CBO opacity is highly problematic given the policy importance, especially since it leads to misleading commentary by the public.
(4/X) It is remarkable, given that 3/4 of the coverage loss is driven by mandate repeal, that CBO has not broken that out year-by-year.
(3/X) It is a fact‚Äîa fact CBO has been unwilling to publicly disclose‚Äîthat 3/4 of its predicted coverage loss is driven by mandate repeal.
(2/X) The point isn't what *you* think will lead to coverage loss under GOP bill. It's what CBO thinks will: the individual mandate.
So much nonsense from left in re my piece on how 73% of CBO coverage "loss" is driven by indiv mandate repeal. (1/X) https://t.co/ulND4kc0VG
@ernietedeschi @dylanlscott You can‚Äôt on the one hand portray CBO‚Äôs predictions as fact, and on the other hand dismiss assessments of CBO‚Äôs predictive accuracy.
@ernietedeschi @dylanlscott CBO is only owed deference in proportion to the accuracy of its prior predictions. Which in health care is not close to perfect.
@ernietedeschi @dylanlscott Peter Orszag, when he ran OMB and was the prior CBO director, lambasted CBO for not, in his view, accurately forecasting ACA‚Äôs cost savings.
@ernietedeschi @dylanlscott I‚Äôm all in favor of the existence of non-partisan fiscal scoring. But no such agency is immune from critiques of its accuracy &amp; methods.
@TopherSpiro @NRO Previous CBO scores of mandate repeal have only included year-by-year fiscal effects, *not* coverage effects. Wouldn't expect you to know.

One of the key things that people don't realize is that CBO believes majority of individual mandate effect is *outside* of nongroup market.
To be clear, I'm sure mandate has some (very modest) effect. But exaggerated by CBO. Not forcing people to buy coverage&gt;&lt;kicking them off.

@chrislhayes @TheStalwart @JDVance1 @C_Garthwaite @kelleher_ @Cutler_econ Fair enough. I'd be more opposed to such a bill because I want people on Medicaid to have individual market insurance.

@LorenAdler @C_Garthwaite @JDVance1 @kelleher_ @Cutler_econ @chrislhayes State innovation grants provide about $100B in funding over ten years. However that is also to be used for risk adjustment etc.

@LorenAdler @C_Garthwaite @JDVance1 @kelleher_ @Cutler_econ @chrislhayes In my view, one area of improvement in this bill would be more explicit funding for CSRs (the state innovation grants can also be used here)
@JDVance1 @LorenAdler @C_Garthwaite @kelleher_ @Cutler_econ @chrislhayes Mostly static.
@JDVance1 @C_Garthwaite @kelleher_ @Cutler_econ @chrislhayes The same way (in reverse) that premiums and deductibles went up under the ACA. By improving the risk pool &amp; lowering underlying premiums.

Any Obamacare fan who is today complaining about deductibles and premiums needs to review what has happened from 2013-2017.
@jimtankersley Plus, considerable $$ for risk adjustment, reinsurance, and stabilization incl. cost sharing.
@jimtankersley Same mechanism as ACA but in reverse. Lower gross insurance costs also get tracked to deductibles.
It‚Äôs hilarious to see ACA fans complain about high deductibles and costs, when they‚Äôve doubled under #Obamacare. Senate bill will do better.
@JoeNBC You‚Äôre listening too much to lefty hot takes.
Halfway through reading Senate the bill. So far, impressed by how much more intelligently it is designed on tax credits &amp; Medicaid reform.
The centerpiece of the @FREOPP plan (https://t.co/jy8EM7Gbtf)‚Äîmeans-tested, age-adjusted tax credits‚Äîis in the Senate bill. This is huge.
@LorenAdler @MarcGoldwein @jenhab I‚Äôm not aware of Republicans planning to repeal first-dollar coverage of preventive care, but perhaps your sources are better than mine.
@LorenAdler @MarcGoldwein @jenhab There‚Äôs also the issue of churn. People around FPL have volatile incomes month-to-month; keeping them in one system improves care delivery.
@LorenAdler @MarcGoldwein @jenhab Not the only thing to consider. Access to care far superior in commercial non-group plans vs. Medicaid.
@MarcGoldwein @LorenAdler @jenhab Exactly. The eligibility floor for the tax credits is an important thing to look for (0% vs. 100% vs. 138% FPL), along with means-testing.

@ketchman I hear you; spent 12 years as a biotech investor. One can reward innovators without granting infinite pricing power.
"High" is not a number. It's what happens when you smoke pot. Nobody objects to recouping R&amp;D costs; question is at what multiple. https://t.co/7CyHGlW507
@dchen333 @FREOPP $MYL CEO Bresch I believe explicitly stated that she took higher list prices in response to PBMs. On balance, I think PBMs add value.
@ketchman @FREOPP Not always. But the valuations of companies that pursue the low R&amp;D cost / high price strategy are very high (i.e. rewarded by markets).
@AmyOtto8 I value everyone‚Äôs perspective, including yours. Thanks for sharing.
@ketchman @FREOPP Open to your critique, but not sure I understand the tweet.
@AmyOtto8 Biotech employees who get insurers to pay for drugs are the only people who can comment on drug pricing policy? Ok‚Äîlook fwd to your paper.
@AmyOtto8 I apologize for not being an insurer‚Äîbut believe that I am capable of expressing an informed opinion on drug pricing. Feel free to disagree.
@AmyOtto8 If you‚Äôre as knowledgable about the industry as you claim to be, you know this to be a ridiculous question.
@AmyOtto8 That‚Äôs what investors do. We invest in hundreds of clinical trials, both successes and failures.
@AmyOtto8 If you‚Äôre saying that doing deep due diligence on 100s of biotech companies is less useful for policy work than working at one, I disagree.
@AmyOtto8 Never said they are the only driver. But they are by far the largest driver. We can retain incentives for orphan drugs but more balanced.

@kelleher_ @aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage That is an obtuse reading. There are directionally more conservative and more progressive systems; CH &amp; SG are more conservative than US.
@kelleher_ @aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage Switzerland and Singapore have regs, yes, but their fiscal performance is so enormously superior to ours, and we regulate too.
@kelleher_ @aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage Conservative question to ask is: what is the scale &amp; scope of govt HC intervention? Dimensions: spending, taxing, deficit/debt, regs.
@kelleher_ @aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage Again, totally misunderstands the conservative case. But do what you want to do.
@aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage When you et al write things like ‚ÄúSingapore is unconservative because REGULATION!‚Äù you‚Äôre doing that. Point is net govt intervention vs. US.
@aaronecarroll @ezraklein @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage We have forced savings too. Singapore‚Äôs is consumer-driven. Always weird when lefties try to tell conservatives what conservatives want.
@ezraklein @aaronecarroll @Neoavatara @voxdotcom @HCTriage The claim that Switzerland and Singapore should be dismissed because they include govt intervention misunderstands the conservative POV.

I do believe that the AHCA will cover fewer people than Obamacare. But I think the difference is more like 5 million, not 24. https://t.co/vS6Lr1AGDe
@matthewherper Individual and Medicaid most off.
@matthewherper more like 50% off. The red curve is also off. Real out-year number closer to 11-10 million

@LorenAdler happy to review RWJF vs McKinsey methodology and see if I agree with you.
.@LorenAdler my views on Obamacare regulation explained in detail in Transcending Obamacare: https://t.co/OdKgfFeKmD
.@haroldpollack by definition, people are uninsured because the price of insurance exceeds the value they assign to it vs other goods.
.@LorenAdler Exactly. Use subsidies to cap as a % of income net premiums. Much lighter regulatory touch: https://t.co/OdKgfFwleb
.@LorenAdler no. McKinsey data is for benchmark silver plan year over year. An entirely appropriate approach.
.@LorenAdler that's just nonsense. Vast majority of people eligible for such coverage. ACA regulations mostly superfluous. Subsidies useful.
.@LorenAdler As I said, plan switching less relevant. Either measure second-cheapest silver plan each year, or cheapest, as a benchmark.
.@LorenAdler This is the point. ACA regulations make plans more expensive. Point of our work was to calculate how much more expensive.
.@LorenAdler More accurate than plan switching is to look at cheapest plans yr/yr. But most post-ACA analyses focus on benchmark silver.
.@LorenAdler #1 barrier to entry for uninsured is high premiums. Hence important to focus on lowest premiums in pre-ACA market.
.@LorenAdler As we explained in 2013-4, your reasoning is flawed. But I appreciate the desire to deny rate shock. https://t.co/2woxHyg7NX

@GaltsGirl Even better!
@GaltsGirl If you come up with a better way to get there, I am all ears!
@GaltsGirl Correct, because my goal is legislation that can garner 60 votes in the Senate. Which requires fiscal modeling, careful crafting.
@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ That‚Äôs not the free-market move. The free-market move is to treat purchase of HC services like all other svcs.
@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ I entirely agree. Getting rid of the employer tax exclusion, FYI, is a $450B/yr tax increase, so offset it.
@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ Go for it.
@GaltsGirl That‚Äôs what Transcending Obamacare does.
.@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ I fully support your plan to replace Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, &amp; VA with libertarian utopia.
@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ @Neoavatara Correct, so states can opt of out of them under my plan. But exchanges &gt; Medicare/Medicaid.

.@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ @Neoavatara No, it‚Äôs more people with catastrophic insurance; less people with comprehensive; hence less $.
.@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ @Neoavatara They can already do that. If you‚Äôre just a defeatist, ok, but I‚Äôll keep working on limited govt.
@nevertrumpjack @_Drew_McCoy_ @Neoavatara Correct. That‚Äôs what the plan strives to achieve. More emphasis on HSAs, higher deductibles.
