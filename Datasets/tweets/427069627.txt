It is not perfect for each of us.  Its perfection is found in all of us.  Remember, it's ours, don't lose it.
Because everyone participates; compromise, civil discussion and honesty are necessities.  When we take extreme stances, we are not furthering democracy, we are creating division.  Each of us must participate as I have stated above to ensure The United States of America endures.
My impression is that many citizens do not understand the complexities of living and participating in a republic.  In this republic, The United States of America, government is considered a public matter.  Everyone can participate.  That participation requires knowledge.
@Bellatrixx2020 Your generating fear by spewing dangerous and spurious information to a segment of society that may come back to haunt you someday.  Please stick to the facts and the truth.   Your remarks are indicative of desperation.  The truth might help.
@FrakerMonica Republicans wouldn't do that, would they?  You are short-sighted and narrow-minded.  Everyone active in politics is of the same mindset.  The opposition (R or D) is extreme and has to be restrained and destroyed.  Whatever happened to agreeing to disagree, compromise, etc.
Whay do republicans love tRump more than they love the USA?
When will the tRump administration move to annex the border states of Mexico as buffer states of the United States?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC Please do not patronize the opposition when you don't know how you would achieve it.
What are you going to do or say when what @realDonaldTrump says is the law of the land?   Don't give up on Democracy.  We can make it work, together.
The Rule Law.  Who does it belong to?  What does it mean?  When does it apply.  Where does it apply.  How does it apply to me or you or them or us...?
@acnewsitics Wrong audience.  When will people learn, "Know your Audience".
@AngelaBelcamino Oh, I wanted to say something but thought better of it.
@OFemmeFataleZ How can that happen?   Did I miss an episode?  Did the fasicst change the rules again?
@Unitedshashe @sianoresist Those jackboots are in lockstep with tRump and company.
@KarrieK817 @Unitedshashe @sianoresist Kinda locked themeselves into it.
@ianbremmer tRumpt must have let the PROFESSIONALS handle it.
@sianoresist Jesus
@realDonaldTrump Stop interfering with the workings of the opposition House of Representatives.  Democrats are the majority there.  You just rode in on your ass.  Get used to being under the microscope, germ!
@MeghanMcCain I am pro-life.  Each one of them.  But you go right ahead and toe the RNC line.  Most people, democrats and republicans have more compassion in their little piggy than you have in in all the witches brew you can conjure.  The freedom we have can not be stolen by you.
@sianoresist The more ideas and candidates the better.  I guess republicans are stuck with their one candidate and the single idea.
@realDonaldTrump Please keep chirping, please
@realDonaldTrump You should have known what they wanted before you left. You discredit the North Koreans by implying that they didn't know what we must have.  They are not stupid.  They are intelligent people who played you for the blubbering fool you are.  Leave negotiations to professionals.

@realDonaldTrump Keep talking.  I'm not listening, but you are being recorded in multiple ways.  But don't worry about that, just keep talking.  Please
@realDonaldTrump would cuddle up to the devil for a profit.  @realDonaldTrump is so worthless that it doesn't matter how disreputable anyone is, was, or will be, as long as they can provide what he wants.
@ChatByCC Yes
@sianoresist or, he cannot tell the difference.
Is there a playbook to all this?  Did someone forget to pass out a playbook to me.  I really need the playbook.  What do you mean, "I have to be on the right side?"  You mean I have to choose?  Does the playbook say that? Which one do I have to choose to get a playbook?  Really?

I am disappointed in the summit results.  But, based on past negotiations between USA and NK, my expectitions were not high.  Kim is not interested in resolving "our" problem.  Sanctions that have been applied by previous administrations have had and will continue to have
@sjhawkwood @MomsThoughts @BarneysNose Please, Don't put it past him.  History is replete with people who did not believe it could happen.
I am so sick of this president and his presidency.
@BarneysNose Some might, but others would not recognize him.
I want to believe Cohen is telling the truth, but could it be just amplification of his ego?
One of my greatest concerns of @realDonaldTrump negotiating with Kim, or anyone else, is, can @realDonaldTrump seperate his interests from our national interests?  I do not trust @realDonaldTrump and company.
@ConvulsedVet @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Emoluments!
The Republican party has been renamed tRump Party, the Republican National Cimmittee is now the tRump national committee, etc.  All hail the Party! oops, does anyone see the similarity?
@FrakerMonica Is it a MOU (memorandum of understand) or a contract?  daa
@OdysseusOfWinds and redemption.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Everything centers on @realDonaldTrump .  Is that correct Grammy?  Are you invested in @realDonaldTrump North Korea investments.  I don't think Kimy and donnie are discussing nuclear weapons.  This is a Trump business trip.  They are discussing new NK business opportunities.

@EarlOfEnough @elsie_lachlan @realDonaldTrump The first step in establishing fascism as the preeminent political system is to silence the opposition, i.e. eliminate the "free press".  @realDonaldTrump is following the play book.  Save the republic!  Save representative democracy!

@B52Malmet @lfkraus He will end up working for the @realDonaldTrump reelection committee with so many other asses
for authoritarian governments over other democracies, a mercantilist approach to international economic policy, a general disregard for human rights and the rule of law, and the promotion of nationalism and unilateralism at the expense of multilateralism.  I agree.
Tom Wright of Foreign Affairs writes, For the first time, it is possible to identify a singular Trump administration foreign policy, as the president’s team coalesces around his ideas. This policy consists of a narrow, transactional relationship with other nations, a preference

@insomniacx29 @therealdrix78 Keep your head up.  Be proud.  Be ready.  The future is bright.
@jadorkables Kim is not giving up the one thing with which he can get recognition.  These, summits if you can call them that, are simply publicity gambits for tRump, Korea, Russia and China.  Their joint statement will consist of lies and empty promices.  Again.
Love must be exercised, strenuously!

@lc1_summit @JustClaudia3 @BarackObama We must identify these demagogues and oppose them at every turn.  We must teach others that they might identify and oppose them as well.  We have failed to teach the principles of republic and democracy to our children.  We, together, must do better.
@InvestigateRU I trust everyone I meet until they are untrustworthy.  @realDonaldTrump is not trustworthy.  I have never met him.  ?
@washingtonpost I wish "they" would stop using "our" @WhiteHouse to respond to allegations regarding @realDonaldTrump.  Can't "they" just say tRump denies the charge?  Leave "our" @WhiteHouse out of this louthsome tragedy.
@wvjoe911 @PrincessBravato @Haleaziz Because ICE is being used as an arm of the tRump fascist regime.  Authoraitarian governments will eventually fall, but not soon enough.  Avoid it at all costs.
@essenviews No, he just fell in line with his fascist master @realDonaldTrump .
Fascism works for the tyrant and does not survive without a tryant.  Help protect our Democracy and Republic.  Please help restore Democracy.  Putin, Xi, Kim, etc. are activily supporting the destruction of our way of life.  It's not perfect, but it is ours.
@realDonaldTrump has emboldened fascism.  His foot soldiers are white supremacist and haters.  They have begun their terror program by dismissing the values of democracy, i.e. love, tolerance, kindness, forgiveness, fairness. etc. Please support democracy now, Before it's to late
@realDonaldTrump has fascist tendencies.  As soon as he blooms, we will live in a fascist country.  Please nip fascism in the bud.
No one knows that because it't not true.  Your grandiose dreams are just two ounces short of a pound.  But your ego will make up the difference.  I don't know why people see a bully as being ok.  Bullies tear down rather then build up.  You have to believe bullying is not healthy
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is without scruples.  He will lie and cheat until he turns purple.  How can anyone still believe this person is presidental?  How can anyone still believe this person cares about our well being?  He believes in self.  If it's good for him, it's good for you.
@maydaymindy9 Once the cake is eaten, you don"t have it.  You can't save money and spend it too.

@jdorrancfarnham @OfficialJonZal And since 1994, they are rearmed and ready.  Save Democracy from these cons.
@nickrmanes Let me give you a hand.  Enjoy.
I have reached 5000 following with only 734 followers.  Need more followers to do more following.  Called tRump a facist pig in 2016 and continue to feel that way.  USA must end this travisity.  We must restore Democracy.  Thanks
@gepehill1 @joncoopertweets Along with @realDonaldTrump.  I hope they share a piece of trash to ride the waves.
@BillKristol Simple stated, @realDonaldTrump lacks scruples.  He has no conscience.
@BillKristol @realDonaldTrump is much more than a capitalist.  @realDonaldTrump is a corrupt capitalist.  Benefiting from profits earned on questionable alliances with corrupt despots, etc. Encouraging criminal behavior by anyone who is seen as being helpful to his criminal enterprise.
@BillKristol Many citizens should know that @realDonaldTrump thinks Democracy is dangerous and that it limits his potential business possibilities.  @realDonaldTrump thinks capitalism allows him and others  to accumulate wealth which cannot be taken or limited by rules, regulations, taxes, et

Putin could reciprocate with an invitation to any one of many celebrations resulting in the rape and pillage Europe and Asia.  Oh, including South America (Cuba, Venezuela, etc.)
July 4th would be a good day to have a counter speech by defenders of liberty (anti fascist, anti tRump,etc.). Maybe @TeamPelosi could be the headliner.  Just imagine the crowd numbers.  Just a thought.  Just imagine tRump's ego bruise when the PS releases the crowd numbers. haha

We should fund a study.  Yes, another one.
What I see as really scary is how fragile @realDonaldTrump's ego appears to be.  I cringe when @realDonaldTrump attacks anyone who has criticized him.  Does he avoid the cracks in the sidewalk?
@jadorkables @ProudResister Republican Party versus United States of America.  Republicans will not support the state of emergency counter-resolution or convict when the House approves impeachment.  Party before country.  Facisim in the making.  I am pessimistic today.  That makes me sad.
@BernadetteNTF @GravityDynamic Thank you Bernadette.
We should never become numb to the attacks on our democracy.  Liberty must be defended.  We must be shocked by each attack.  We must employ all legal and moral defences against these attacks, wether foreign or domestic.  We must not be afraid of blundering bullies.
@LindseyGrahamSC thinks infrastructure, which is, according to Google, "the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities needed for the operation of a society or enterprise" in the United States should be secondary to a BIG block of concrete on the US Mexico border
@realDonaldTrump Why are you so angry?   Did that bully take you binky again?  Well, you just stomp your little feet and pout, slobber and spit all over until you get it back.  If, after all that, that bully won't give it back, you call your close friends, @LindseyGrahamSC  and @senatemajldr.
donnie, I think you're funny. Ha.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Wow, according to @LindseyGrahamSC, the United States of America is the biggest bully in the neighborhood or else.
@essenviews Senator,  I do not agree.  Has dementia set in that far?
concrete "racist" wall.  Do you acknowledge this president's calling all immigrants "murder's, rapists, etc.?  Even those already vetted entering at other points of entry.  I forgive you, but I will not forget. Border Security, YES.  A racist border wall, NO.  Never.
Wow!!!!  He continues with "We needed Democrats to support us and they have been unified in trying to thwart this president's number one issue in the campaign which was to secure the border's.  Senator, Democrats are for border security.  What their not for is a really big,

Please do not let our differences destroy our liberty.
@robreiner We should all be really frightened of losing our liberty.  We have problems, and we have solutions.  We work together to resolve differences.  This administration is attempting to solve our problems by restricting liberty rather than ensuring liberty for each of us.
