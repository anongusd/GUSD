To innovate and transform, social sector orgs can't just give staff permission to change. They must also give them incentives.
At the core of lean impact is the idea that we need to raise the bar. We can't be happy with delivering some impact. As the private sector does with profit, we need to relentlessly seek maximum impact.
Testing our theories of change early and often is critical. Fall in love with the problem, not your solution.
Keep audacious goals as north stars. Then begin small by building an experiment, measuring the result and learning. This reduces feedback loops to days rather than years, as in traditional int'l development programming.
Three keys to innovative social impact, says @annmei: 	Think big. 	Start small. 	Seek impact.
We're thrilled to have @annmei visiting Pact today to discuss bold ideas for exponentially growing social impact! Join us now on Facebook Live! https://t.co/YShsz38xcv #socialimpact https://t.co/vsoHeLRQmZ
