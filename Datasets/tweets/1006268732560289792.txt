And that concludes the Republican debate over California’s 1st State Senate district. The special election will take place on March 26th.
Kevin Kiley closing statement: “The most important part of my job is being in the community and meeting you the constituents. I have always tried being as active in the community as I can and I will continue to do that as a State Senator”.
@KevinKileyCA gathers a laugh from the crowd as he says Prop 13 is the only sane bill for Californians.
@RexHime says he’s running for California’s 1st State Senate district to “stir the pot”. He also notes that he is a political outsider and understands the needs of everyday people.
Important debate note: All three candidates have decided to eliminate the crossfire questioning. Instead, they will take random questions from the audience.
California Globe Editor and current debate Moderator Katy Grimes asks Brian Dahle what percentage of the 12 percent gas tax is actually going towards our road repairs? Dahle - “Never vote for a tax act. The money never ends up going towards the allotted project”.
Brian Dahle shares a passionate but ugly vision of California’s future as he insists the state must stop accepting illegal immigration as a norm. “These are not bad people, but they must come here legally”.
Rex Hime compares himself to a Reagan Republican as he lists a plethora of Republican campaign work that has boosted his knowledge of how to get more Republicans elected in California.
Question for @BrianDahleCA “Why haven’t we increased the size of the Shasta dam?” Response: “It’s something that we’re working on and I will continue to fight for”
Question for @RexHime “how do you feel about the wall?” Response: “How I feel about the wall is that it’s not finished yet”
“Pensions are going to tear up California. We need to change the pension system” - @BrianDahleCA
“I’ll give a one word answer to that... oversight. Take a look at the DMV, we need a lot more oversight to properly ensure the accountability of our tax dollars” - @KevinKileyCA
Q: How do you plan to restore fiscal accountability in the Californa state government?

“People always say that we are the 4th largest economy in the state. That doesn’t matter when 20% of our people live in poverty. We need to change that” - @RexHime

Kiley: Forrest fires. Dahle: Forrest fires. Hime: Representation
Question: What is the #1 issue currently facing Senate District 1?
Opening statements: @BrianDahleCA “In the legislature, I worked across the aisle. I’ve had 110 different assembly members to my district. I am running for senate to build those same connections in the senate and and continue to help pass bi-partisan bills that benefit all”
