Really shocked that neither @cdc witness or members of Congress acknowledge that every county in USA has public health clinics that provide #vaccines free of charge.
@michaelcburgess live virus vaccines do not contain preservatives. They do however shed so they can spread diseases even if rarely
@michaelcburgess do you believe we should strive to replace vaccines like MMR that are made with aborted fetal tissue lines.
@cdc witness lied by omission under oath when answering question on risk to MMR check out package insert.
@RepJeffDuncan will you ask NIH &amp; CDC witness how long before we get an MMR Vaccine not produced with 2 aborted human fetus tissue cell lines.?

@c_w_morrison @DarlaShine Actually the science shows an increased risk of getting Shingles with the varicella vaccine - and amazingly there is an appearance of Shingles in young people who are vaccinated.
@HasardJardinier @JennHoffman @DarlaShine There is now the MMRV which includes the varicella (chickenpox) component.  The underlying point is that there is science to show vaccines do not give life long immunity. And yes there is a research study using measles virus on cancer.
Yes, I post a lot about #vaccines -to be clear, I am not opposed to people being vaccinated; I am opposed to the liberty to make that decision being taken away! Be informed, make your own decision. At a minimum read the package insert first &amp; get any questions answered.#Liberty

@secularcitizen2 @GOP As cancer patient she qualifies for Medicare - so shame on you for not being fully informed as a physician. The hospital has a social worker who will help traverse the many gov and charitable care options available. The problems with medicine are not @GOP's fault.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The arrogance of a federal official to "demand" retention of security clearance (which is granted to people who qualify and have a need) is laughable if it weren't doing our nation so much harm. #DOJ #Mueller #DeepState

@s_bitchin @GingerTaylor To that statement - death from a vaccine reaction is permanent as well - which has and does occur - even the US Government admits that.
@Snarty_McFly @GingerTaylor I never suggested any such thing.
@Blipdriver @matt_hartless @GingerTaylor @KatelynBauer14 You know, scientists used to say the earth was flat. Vaccine Injury does occur, there are incidences in which vaccine reactions cause brain injury - vaccines are not the ONLY cause of autism, but they are one of the causes - whether you acknowledge it or not.

@etho_scott @GingerTaylor Wrong. All vaccines have potential to cause death. In fact  VICP program acknowledges this.
@Snarty_McFly @GingerTaylor Says someone who obviously isn’t a parent
@novaprimexx @GingerTaylor You obviously do not know how engaged with scientists Ginger has been for over a decade.
@araknofennisti @OShihBeta @GingerTaylor You would be wrong.
@JoshMichaelNC9 @GingerTaylor @sphericaltime Do vaccines have the capacity to cause seizures or swelling in the brain? Yes according to US public health entities. Either of both of those types of brain insults can lead to development of autism.
@Drithos @GingerTaylor Please post a link to those 2500 studies.
@ABassGuitarist @GingerTaylor @MagicandLights Fraud invalidates research.
@Jessicknits @GingerTaylor We’re you under the age of three?  And by the way done military members suffer serious reactions from this vaccines and some have died.
@Double_0_N00b @GingerTaylor No it was not caused by one dude.
@zhoumxng @GingerTaylor @matt_hartless @KatelynBauer14 How about you walk a mile in @GingerTaylors shoes before judging
@matt_hartless @GingerTaylor @KatelynBauer14 Autism for  many us a complex medical issue that is more than simple behavioral diversities. Many of the thousands of families I know dealing w/ medical injury associated autism have kids &amp; now adults with no speech, inflammatory issues &amp; will never be able to live independently
@s_bitchin @GingerTaylor @FrBenDavis Actually at least 50 percent of autism is developed post birth from environmental causes as noted in research and confirmed by former NICHD director.
@s_bitchin @GingerTaylor The risk may seem minuscule to you but if it is your child that has a permanent medical injury ther is nothing minuscule about it. The fact is you cannot know how many are injured because of the way studies and Adverse events are reported and tracked.
@s_bitchin @GingerTaylor So as an RN you do not want to see mandated vaccines made safer?
@FeetInDMsNOW @GingerTaylor All of the diseases you mentioned can be treated medically and cured .  Autism so far has no cure.
