@JohnRKenney Before we go on, I would need to know what is meant by social innovation? I think we might not have the same definition. Mine does not involve technology.
@JohnRKenney What is the goal of social innovation (SN)? If we innovate just to innovate, it might be fun and inspiring, but is it useful? If it is, in what context is it useful? This is what we are missing, an overall goal. Without this goal, SI wherever it originates, maybe just a fad.
@TBS_Canada As a citizen, the results to these two questions are alarming: I feel that the quality of my work suffers because of (A) constantly changing priorities -27%- and (B) lack of stability in my department or agency -37%-. This points to deficiencies at the top level of management.
Just 3 votes, but all votes disagree with the statement. Hence, people think that their religious teachings are perfect. Interesting.
@JInremm Yes but Hiroshima was "only", 15 kilotons . (Sorry for using the word "only", Surely  Japanese readers will react to this word, 15 kilotons is already too much and makes too much damages) Unfortunately China has bombs that are 333 times stronger. (5 Mton = 5000 kton. :-(

@JInremm All I do is write a book. Once it is out there it is out of my hands.
@JInremm We must find a way and I think I have identified the guidelines that can help us achieve this across societies and across time. That is what I am working on.
@JInremm "Good" citizens can only promote these two 2 statements. Hence, if their religious teaching though them differently, then they need to renege these teaching and thus partly betray their religion.  We all need to do some sort of reneging with our beliefs system.
@JInremm Actually, we need a few universal categorical jugement. For example men and women are equal and homosexuality is a natural sexual expression of life, Any religious teaching that promote the contrary is wrong.
@JInremm Yes, it is and we need to understand that some elements of religious philosophy are wrong and we need to pick the elements that are positive for societies. The same can be said for all dogmas, including political philosophies.
What do you think? 		To be "good" citizens, religious people must renege some of their religious teachings.
If the logic behind this poll is true, it would mean that good citizens do not make good religious people.

@shelavida I don't understand what you are trying to say here: "Panama does not go to USA we return"
@JInremm Actually, it might be a great way to diversify their economy.
The USA should invest massively in Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Savador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama and Columbia. This would reduce the flux of immigrants in the USA as they would migrate to these countries instead of the USA because there would be jobs there.

@IFiniq Do you mean goal?
@danodea I do have a chapter on the size of government. I conclude that the more competent citizens are the smaller the government needs to be.
@IFiniq Yes but what guides our principles? ;-)
@JInremm I wanted to use politicians but it was to direct. Governance is not compatible with the content of the book.
As I reread the question, and taking into consideration the content of the book, which really looks at how we can reverse the citizens/politicians role, thus giving them the direction instead of the other way around, the book is not about government.

@billbrokob Well loosing their freedom is already a big lost of benefits don't you think?  Maybe if their level of civic literacy would be higher, Americans and Canadians civic literacy is around 30%, they would be better citizens.
@billbrokob Yes but the problem is that when you are in prison, you are still in the group.
@billbrokob There are a few reasons why we should never lose it. First, we are all coowners of the societies we live in.  Second we need to facilitate the development and social and societal integration of citizens.  Hence we need to promote activities that will help accomplish this.
@billbrokob @billbrokob Please read above. In some countries inmates still have the right to votes.
@billbrokob There are places that have a permanent electoral list, for example Canada, We can find out what are the best practices associated with the use of permanent list and use them to make the follow up.
@billbrokob The date they die would be the only other element that could change. Since we all are coowners of the societies we live in, except when citizens migrate country, no one loses their right to vote.
Do you agree? All citizens have the right to vote. Once they have the legal right to vote, citizens should be on the electoral list and their names should never be erased. The only modification to the list should be to reflect their change of address.

M√©fiez-vous du mot SYST√àME. S'il est utile pour d√©crire comment la nature fonctionne, pour d√©crire la soci√©t√©, il n'est utile que s'il se r√©f√®re √† des ensembles de comportements appris, partag√©s et r√©p√©t√©s. Ce faisant, nous pouvons changer les syst√®mes pr√©sents dans nos soci√©t√©s.
Beware of the word SYSTEM. If it's useful to describe how nature works, when describing how societies' work, it's only useful if it refers to sets of learned, shared and repeated behaviors. This definition tells us how we can change the various systems present in our societies.

I  finished the introduction of my book "How to Become a Competent Citizen?" This book will help us better play our role as a citizen.
J'ai termin√© l'introduction de mon livre "Comment devenir un citoyen comp√©tent?" Ce livre nous aidera √† mieux jouer notre r√¥le en tant que citoyen.
Toutes les technologies du monde ne r√©soudront pas nos probl√®mes sociaux et soci√©taux. Nous devons trouver un moyen d'accro√Ætre notre coh√©sion sociale et soci√©tale, avant que quelqu'un ne trouve le moyen d'utiliser nos technologies pour d√©truire notre monde.
There are two realities. The concrete reality: what is, and the social reality, which is the result of our actions that are guided by our social constructs that are built from our knowledge and our beliefs.
Il y a deux r√©alit√©s. La r√©alit√© concr√®te: ce qui est, et la r√©alit√© sociale, qui elle est le r√©sultat de nos actions qui sont guid√©es par nos constructions sociales qui elles sont construites √† partir de nos connaissances et nos croyances.
@enkerli *Promeut inconsciemment.
@enkerli Clarification. Actuellement c'est tragique. La sociologie existe depuis plus de 125 ans et son incapacit√© √† d√©finir la soci√©t√©, promeut une forme d'omerta qui emp√™che le vrai dialogue sur ce handicap majeur et perp√©tue notre ignorance, ce qui nous emp√™che d'avancer soci√©talement.
@enkerli Tu vois, moi quand quelqu'un me demande: "Est-ce que tu sais ce qu'est une soci√©t√©?", je suis capable de r√©pondre: " Oui, c'est une organisation." C'est pour √ßa que je peux dire que j'√©tudie les soci√©t√©s et que je les connais.
@enkerli Alors qu'est que la soci√©t√©?
@enkerli Ils ne savent donc pas ce qu'est la soci√©t√©. Est-ce que toi tu sais ce que c'est?
@enkerli Et le but commun permet d'encadrer le dialogue.
@enkerli Je suis habitu√©. ;-)
@enkerli Sauf que le dialogue profond tourne en rond s'il n'est pas encadr√©. :-( Tu peux peut-√™tre allez visit√© mon autre site.  https://t.co/p70AuIYUYJ
@enkerli Ce qui est important ici, c'est qu'elle soit utile ;-). Ceci √©tant dit elle n'est pas contextuel.
@enkerli Nous n'avons pas besoin d'√©quipe adverse,. Nous travaillons aussi en √©quipe lorsque nous travaillons ensemble pour construire une maison. Ici aussi le but cr√©e la coh√©sion.
@enkerli La dynamique supra-organisationnel est la soci√©t√©. La soci√©t√© est l'organisation premi√®re.
@enkerli Non le but cr√©e la coh√©sion. Comme dans tout sport d'√©quipe ce qui cr√©e la coh√©sion c'est que tout le monde veut atteindre le m√™me but.
@enkerli Oui, mais ce n'est pas assez. Il nous faut un but commun et des objectifs communs. C'est la seule fa√ßon de cr√©er une coh√©sion soci√©tale.
@enkerli La sociologie n'a pas √©t√© inutile, mais elle l'a √©t√© surtout en √©tudiant le socius. Voir ce livre: https://t.co/Tk7TV0xANl Concernant tes coll√®ges, la meilleure fa√ßon de le savoir est de leur demander ce qu'est la soci√©t√©? S'ils ne font que la d√©crire, il ne la connaisse pas. :-(
@enkerli Oups! J'ai r√©pondu en anglais. ;-)
@enkerli I don't use sociology to study societies. I use the lenses of management. Rare are sociologists who try to study societies today because they don't have a clear definition of what they are. Using a management science to study societies is much more fruitful.
@enkerli Then we will have to share notes at one point.
@enkerli Actually it is more about using a change management approach, SL is a change management approach, to help us achieve the desired change, which is the goal.
@enkerli Forgot to mention that using this new management science, I identified that all societies share the same underlying goal.
@enkerli I study societies. I realized early on that they were organizations. As I continued to study them, the basis of a new management science to help study them emerged. Once completed, I developed a change management model and modify SL to fit the particular needs of societies.
@enkerli The only way to strengthen the edges is by having a clear direction, with a clear goal and clear guidelines.
@barefoot_pivots @ResultsJunkie @enkerli If you are interested, I have applied the Learning Organization approach to facilitate change at the societal level and it works. Well, at least theoretically, since I did not really have the chance to apply the approach yet.
@ResultsJunkie @barefoot_pivots @enkerli The best information I have seen on vison and mission statements is this one. They used the concept visionary and missionary to guide us. https://t.co/vGE8GsIEiF

La lecture est la comp√©tence la plus importante que les citoyens devraient poss√©der. Malheureusement, plus de 40% sont analphab√®tes fonctionnels. Il est donc difficile d'√™tre un citoyen comp√©tent. Nous avons d√©sesp√©r√©ment besoin de devenir des lecteurs et des citoyens comp√©tents.
Reading is the most important competence citizens should possess. Unfortunately, more than 40% are functionally illiterate. It is hard to be a competent citizen when you can't read effectively. We desperately need to become more competent readers and citizens.

La citoyennet√© est une profession. Ce qui est unique avec cette profession, c'est que chacune de nos actions a un impact, m√™me si elle est minuscule, sur quelqu'un d'autre. La citoyennet√© est donc une profession collective. Merci d'apprendre √† devenir un citoyen comp√©tent.
Citizenship is a profession. What is unique about this profession is that each and every one of our actions has an impact, even if it is a minuscule one, on someone else. Citizenship is thus a collective profession. Please learn to be a competent citizen.
Une preuve de la faiblesse de nos comp√©tences civiques. Les Am√©ricains ont du mal √† faire la diff√©rence entre les faits et les opinions. (26% et 35% de taux de r√©ussite.) Les r√©sultats pour les Canadiens seraient probablement similaires. https://t.co/E61eQBNLvl
A proof of weak civic literacy. Americans have difficulty telling the difference between fact and opinion. (26% and 35% success rate.) The results for Canadians would probably be similar.  https://t.co/E61eQBNLvl
If we evaluated the civic literacy of Canadians and Americans, it would be between 30% to 40%. Citizens of Northern European countries would be between 70% and 75%. #CivicLiteracy
Si nous √©valuions les comp√©tences civiques des Canadiens et des Am√©ricains, elles se situeraient entre 30% et 40%. Les citoyens des pays du nord de l'Europe seraient entre 70% et 75%. #Alphab√©tisationCivique

@ResultsJunkie Interesting. I wonder what role mental model plays in the process? I suspect the change must be compatible. Otherwise the mental crowbar is not enough. Even a jackhammer would be insufficient. Sometime only crisis can open one's mind. :-(
@EdBernacki @thomkearney @bethmaru @ResultsJunkie @marydclauzon @PortiaTaylorOG @joycuriosity Yes, but it is ONLY ONE OF THE MANY societal sub-goals and it's in competition against all of them to receive the adequate resources. What is missing is an overarching goal.
@EdBernacki @thomkearney @bethmaru @ResultsJunkie @marydclauzon @PortiaTaylorOG @joycuriosity Not going to happen? Things happen when people want to happen. Leaders play an important role. History has shown that it is possible. The eradication of polio for example.

@thomkearney @bethmaru @ResultsJunkie @marydclauzon @PortiaTaylorOG @joycuriosity And looking at the image, there are a lot of noise. ;-)
@ranjita_m Some Americans were neutral in their choice for President and did not vote. (45% of adults). Many made a decision that they did not care who was going to be president. In effect they decided to let other decided and they will go along with whoever is elected. Were they neutral?
@ranjita_m Mundate = that lacks excitement and is ordinary. What lacks excitement or is ordinary lies in the eyes of the beholder. Hence what is important for you can be mundane for someone else.
@ranjita_m Three of my friends ask me if I want to see movie A, B or C. However, I have no basis on which to make a decision and decide that I will go with whatever they decide, am I neutral? I think so.
@ranjita_m I disagree. A neutral position only means that you can live with one choice or another.
@ResultsJunkie If there is ever such a request to talk about social and societal intelligence, which is by far our biggest weakness, I would definitely be interested in such an opportunity. ;-)
@thomkearney @bethmaru @ResultsJunkie @marydclauzon @PortiaTaylorOG @joycuriosity When it comes to social dialogues, language creates a lot of noise that decreases the effectiveness of our dialogues.
