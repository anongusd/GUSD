Since everyone’s feed is undoubtably filled with Michael Cohen at the moment, I thought adding a cuter (and generally better) Cohen would be a nice reprieve. Hopefully Leonard Cohen the miniature poodle is exactly the change of pace you didn’t know you needed. https://t.co/wJ5TGe09Ri

It’s more of the same from @SpeakerPelosi and her “let’s pass it to see what’s in it” mentality. Her decision to waive the 72 hour rule is petty, partisan and irresponsible. Lawmakers need ample time to read and digest legislation before voting. https://t.co/3cOzYhqfE2

@SenMcSallyAZ is a class act and this is the perfect example. I met her at an event a few weeks after the election and introduced myself.
