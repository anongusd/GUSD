@THaq510 Except for when all the #Arabs surrounding attacked Israel and Israel fought back and took control. Only way to get some land back and finally have a state is to come to the table and talk peace. Jerusalem has always been Israel's capital. That was never the reason for violence.
@Stefaniafodd This poor guy mightve been shot because the bullet was aimed for the guy next to him shooting projectiles at the soldiers. Even in america, if I attempted to throw rocks or anything at a cop (in other words attacking him/her) I would get a bullet to my head.
@QudsNen Doesn't look like you guys want peace. and it doesn't look like they want jews to exist. and it doesn't look like you guys are aware of the 1967 borders nor want them.
@QudsNen There was never a state of #palestine. The Palestinians in the area were always ruled by others (ie Ottoman Empire, Jordanians, British). Now Israel is there and they rule over the Palestinians. But Israel wants to create a State of Palestine for its ppl. But Pals don't want it

@MuntherIsaac Unfortunately, there never was a peace process because terrorists are still getting paid to kill Jews and themselves by the Palestinian leadership. This has nothing to do with the announcement that already was a fact dating back to the victory in the war of ‚Äò67.
@sereningly Before Israel became a nation, Palestine didn‚Äôt have control over its own land. Jordan occupied it. The Ottoman Empire occupied it. Even Britain occupied it. Now Israel wants Palestine to have their own state, and they dont want to negotiate. And so still they don‚Äôt have a state.

@Me75327714 @realDonaldTrump @KHOU Lol. No need. I'm not a cult-like follower of trump at all. I call him out when things happen all the time. But try to see the good too.
@imahaider @celestialniccy @ballsalicious @Dazed @MunroeBergdorf LOL DUHHH! Hahhaa I can't believe you said that lol killin me here.
@blakcoffee @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump @KHOU I totally agree he needs to change his demeanor. I just dont want to make a mountain out of a mole hole bc all the media is already doing it

@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa With all that said, I know Israel is not perfect. They take extreme measures. I want peace for Palestinians and Israelis.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa It has to be covert bc if their fellow village ppl see that their ppl are taking aid from Israel, they will be shunned from their own ppl
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa That too- but they don't ask ?'s for kids- they take them all. It's not just Golan Heights. It's all over the Syrian border.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa It's similar to most Palestinians. Most want to rid all Jews from the whole area. But 1.6 million Arabs live is Israel and Israel is ok w/it
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa From what I remember in that article, it's not a very fare artlicle. If they mean Israelis want a majority Jew country then sure.
@EdKrassen Also, it is bc of Muslims that we are at all ever successful in missions overseas. (I.e. Capturing Bin Laden). Most don't hate USA at all!!!
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa They secretly bring kids to Israeli hospitals &amp;perform free surgeries. And once healed bring them back @ NIGHT for the Syrians own safety.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa Because Syrians don't want to go to Israel first of all. Israel is so hated that they do COVERT rescue missions at their borders at night.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa Even after winning the West Bank from Jordan, they are still saving it for a State of #Palestine but Palestinians don't want Israel to exist
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa Palestine was under ottoman rule, then Jordanian rule, and now Israeli rule. Israel is the only one that wants a State of Palestine.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa Israel is the most diverse country in the world. In fact, #Israel protects 1.6+ million Arab citizens inside Israel.
@RickyVaughn_II @BevHillsAntifa Israeli won the land thru war w/Jordan. years &amp; years of trying to make a peace deal but Palestinians reject it. So which side wants peace?

When you have nothing else to say but have to say something. All I ask is for proof that #Palestinians condemn terrorism. That's all. https://t.co/ylx9SA5JQh
@OccPalGaza There are 1000's of Israelis in Israel who protest their own government's extreme stance. Are there ANY Pals protesting their gov's stances?
@OccPalGaza @Stefmck2 #Hamas is not against it. They name streets and schools after #Palestinians who kill #Israeli children. Show me JUST 1 TIME it was condemned
@hollywoodantifa 2nd: I believe in what you fight for. But I am against how you execute it. You are essentially doing what you fight against. #Antifa=#thugs
@hollywoodantifa First off, I can't be a Nazi because I love Jews. And also because I love Jesus. And because I love Jesus, I love my neighbor AND my enemy.
@hollywoodantifa Is it because #antifa is a mob &amp; hate group and they don't want to get it removed the proper way? Follow the rules and do it the proper way!
@OccPalGaza @dannydanon I know you have been mistreated too. No doubt. Israel is not perfect. But #Palestinian ppl must protest killing of innocent #Israeli ppl.
@OccPalGaza @dannydanon You definitely have the right to resist...no doubt! :) And I'm happy u are against killing of civilians bc PLO and Hamas are not against it.

@Stump4TrumpPAC @RyanJensen2018 Just like Nazis wearing crosses, this woman doesn't represent Jesus nor can she be a Christian. Christians are called to love one another.
@OccPalGaza @dannydanon If Palestinians would protests against terrorism, there would be peace. But they can't bc they risk getting killed by their own people.
@OccPalGaza @dannydanon Do you condemn the killing of innocent Israelis at the hands of Palestinian terrorists? If Pals do this, there will be peace.
@dannydanon @NorthWestFOI Oh but Ambassador, those kids weren't doing anything. Look at the picture, they're just beings kids, playing and having fun! Oh boy....
@nontolerantman @whitereddit Are his thoughts not the same garbage thoughts as the demonic KKK?? Has anyone from #BLM condemned him yet?
@BevHillsAntifa @LagBeachAntifa @MarALagoAntifa @Mao_Libu @walstreetAntifa @WestTexasAntifa @CambridgeAntifa @AntifaBoston @VacavilleAntifa @FifthAveAntiFa @nantucketantifa #Antifa should also be blamed for starting the violence.

@Amy_Etkind @lsarsour lol Christian and terrorists=oxymoron. Christians condemn anyone that doesn't follow Jesus' teachings. But that's quite different than PALs.

@rezaaslan So bc Palestinians don't condemn their suicide bombers and in fact names schools and streets after them does that make them all terrorists?
@rezaaslan So because you don't condemn Radical Islam does that make you a terrorist?
@Cobratate Isn't the suicide rate higher after the surgery? That's what I keep hearing. Any thoughts?
@washingtonpost I am appalled at this headline. You should be ashamed of yourself.
@lsarsour I'm happy you condemn the KKK in the USA. I DO TOO. But you should also condemn the KKK of Gaza (namely Hamas)!
@MysticHar @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Exactly! I agree. But same with her regarding the other side.  I think both should be called out. She shdnt demand what she dsn't do herself
@HananyaNaftali But you don't understand, it's still Israel's fault sick Gazans are suffering! ü§•
@MysticHar @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Obviously. And this is about labeling hate. Whether religion. Race. Whatever. Same same. We need to condemn by name all violence and hate.
@MysticHar @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump She wants him to call it what it is.... why should POTUS call it what it is when they never call it what it is....
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You can only hold him to that standard if you hold yourself to that standard. Did you ever call out radical Islam?

@charitylenfest You avoid the question. You think if you ignore it and play ignorant, you won't have to worry about your conscience telling you ur wrong.
@charitylenfest So is it a fetus or a baby when it is only half way out of the vagina? What about at 9 months? 8? 7? Some magical process change the label?
@rjakes65 @KamalaHarris In Germany, society was ok with murdering gays and Jews. Was it ok because society was ok with it?
@HattyMch @KamalaHarris Yup. just use condoms provided freely almost anywhere and/or birth control. Done.
@rjakes65 @KamalaHarris Protection provided by society has changed over time. So we fight to change it back to before birth. If so, would you follow it?
@ooojanique @KamalaHarris Again, this argument is irrelevant bc it is sooooo highly rare. Let's allow that exception. Will u fight for the rest of the babies killed?
@GemmaGirl3 @KamalaHarris Its only a bloody clump once they are torn apart by murderers....
@GemmaGirl3 @KamalaHarris So do you condemn murder at 21 weeks? And also, of course, life of a woman wins ALWAYS. But that's rarely ever the reason. Highly rare.
@ellis_texas @KamalaHarris Definitely not only breeders! But I do believe in responsibility. And even more responsibility for the men!
@charitylenfest You wish! You have still to tell me if 2 month old babies are capable of existential thought or not and if we should kill them too. ur loss
@charitylenfest Show me where I made the argument that u made the argument that we should kill any1 not capable of existential thought. I was just wondering
@charitylenfest Neither are 2 month olds. Lets kill them too then?
@KamalaHarris What about equality for the voiceless who don't want to die before their time?
@Israelkicksass @EvaAdva @DanielBenAdam @susskindbatzi @redbrasco @afagerbakke @RokedvMagen @IsraelsVoice @TeachESL Not until Palestinians protest against violence and terrorism will there by any peace. The clock ticks...one day it will be too late.

@KhaledAbuToameh Why are they arresting journalists? And are they Palestinian journalists?
@CNN And he still wants to like crazy. But if they attack us or our allies, that's a different story.
@nytimes Now America really knows @realDonaldTrump would go to any lengths to protect his people.
@rezaaslan You're lucky you even got six months. Hillary Clinton would've already invaded after the first missile test.
@rezaaslan This is such propaganda and fear mongering. You should be ashamed of yourself. Was the attack on Pearl Harbor Pres. FDR's fault too then?
@Independent Comments like this confuse me. Is it worth even reporting if u have a headline like this? What? Did u think others thought it wasnt serious?
@KamalaHarris The fact you quote Huffington Post loses you lots of credibility.
@StandWithUs If this was true, thousands of other Israeli Arabs wouldn't be fighting against Palestinians to protect the State of Israel!
@KamalaHarris But you won't fight for the most voiceless right? In fact, you fight for people to be able to murder the voiceless. 50+ million dead babies!
@StandWithUs Have any Palestinians come out and condemned this attack?
@Wonka609Joann @washingtonpost Yes they have. several times. although it is the same with the democrats and the republicans. They're both lame when it comes to team work.
@Wonka609Joann @washingtonpost Which i agree is sad. Wish we could all work together. But mostly it is bc everything the GOP asks of Dems, the answer is NO.
@StandWithUs Finally, the PA admits they are afraid of their own people.
@KeithOlbermann @realDonaldTrump #propaganda is the word you are looking for if you think/believe North Korea isn't being diplomatic because of @realDonaldTrump comments.

@KamalaHarris #MikeBrown was a thug who assaulted an officer. I feel bad he lost his life. He essentially committed suicide. Hands up don't shoot = FALSE
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler it's just sad to see someone with a track record of killing so many innocent ones compared to someone w/a potty mouth (and that's really it)
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler I actually don't love trump. I don't even like him. I just hope for the best. But he's no Kim Jong Un. That's the whole argument.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Oohhhh so you think his personality will send a nuke flying? It's a cute thought. Don't live in fear.
@chelseahandler You are a homophobe
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler personalities? Since when r we talking about personalities?? lol this is 2 funny. Personality doesn't matter unless u have a job interview
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Of course, the Kim dynasty.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Ur comparisons are irrelevant. U just hate the man and so you find anything U can to make him look more flawed than the flawed humans we are
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Oh and I see you're just being hypothetical. So in this case, I'm sure if u were in Kim Jon Un's seat, you'd kill ppl you didn't like too.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Kim Jong Un IS the system that enables it.
@xychelsea If there were no prisons in this world, I'm sure there would be ppl who didn't agree with your lifestyle trying hard to do harm to you.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler it would be like you are saying someone who boasts of how amazing and powerful they are is the same as Hitler who killed 6 million jews.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler Say they are easily provoked and flaunt themselves.... The reason they aren't in any way similar is bc the outcome is completely different.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler If u isolate ANY human's thoughts &amp; certain actions, i'm sure we can find some comparisons to Hitler too. That doesn't mean its a good comp.
@AlanDersh This is what I don't like about far lefters.  They point fingers at Trump and others for what they say and then use the same language!
@rezaaslan fear mongering at its best = your quote. Kind of like Gaston and the Beast. ;)
@teresainnj Bc we live in the land of the free &amp; home of the brave. Try bringing any of that crap dictatorship or sharia law in here &amp; see what happens.
@ThrizzleDizzle @chelseahandler We can all speculate something about someone. But Saying crap like that trivializes the suffering of the ppl, comparing them to thriving USA
