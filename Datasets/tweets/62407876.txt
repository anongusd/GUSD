I want to especially thank #TheCounselor @BrendanBuck. After hiring me, he told everyone, via Twitter, that he’d get me to “tweet more.” Hopefully, he'll see this thread. 		He is the most talented communicator &amp; strategist I've ever come across. I’m grateful for his mentorship.
In particular, I want to thank @SpeakerRyan—a class act who never ceases to amaze me with his kindness and optimism.
To all my colleagues—Republicans, Democrats, and nonpartisans alike—thank you for your friendship. It’s been a blast working with you all from my post in H-164.
The House can often seem like a rowdy place. It is (and it’s fun). But beyond the noise, there are amazing people who work hard with little recognition.
So the boss scooped me, but I have some ~personal~ news.		Today is my last day with Speaker Ryan. It's been the privilege of a lifetime to work in this office, and I am thankful to have been part of this team.
