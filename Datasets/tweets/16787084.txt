@stanleyfosha 16th Amendment specifies "states," and is not inclusive of territories.
In fact, "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" still applies to the latter. People born in Puerto Rico, for instance, are American citizens at birth.
When the 14th Amendment was ratified, "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" would have meant the states under Reconstruction who had temporarily lost sovereignty, and the territories that had not yet become states. https://t.co/3zWRU7J7HJ
