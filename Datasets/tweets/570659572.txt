@FolesMagic @RepMarkMeadows No talking he will be taking money from our military, law enforcement and places like that.   Listen to his speech.  His words
@kos_felix @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Trump, responding to my question, concedes there‚Äôs no national emergency to justify building his wall: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt need to do this... I just want to do it faster.‚Äù	That answer will complicate his legal case.
@kos_felix @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump That is SO not what he said
@FolesMagic @RepMarkMeadows He is screwing citizens for a wall.  Re read what I said
@FolesMagic @RepMarkMeadows So you only care about specific people.  I care about all USA citizens
@jm3847Jmar @RepMarkMeadows Yep done before but does not mean at this time it is needed
@SenJohnHoeven TRUMP: "I want to do it faster. I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster."		FACT: You just undercut your entire argument for declaring a national emergency. üëçüèΩ		/end		#FakeTrumpEmergency

@FolesMagic @RepMarkMeadows I do not believe that it would reduce it much.  Yes everyone one saved is worth money, but the money could be used to save way more if used properly and not for a wall so he has his own MT Rushmore.  So stop waiting my time with your lies
@WhiteHouse @Trump2020_2024 Fever helps build anti bodies.  Beside that pull your lips off his rear and learn the truth. Donald admitted there was not a need for emergency declaration.  He just wants his way.  Pussy can grab himself.  He is a big pussy
