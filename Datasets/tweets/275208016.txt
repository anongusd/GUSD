E&amp;C's oversight panel will examine the outbreak Wednesday, with Drs. Fauci and Messonnier from the NIH and CDC testifying.
The measles were considered eliminated in the U.S. in year 2000. Since then, the highest number of cases was 667 in 2014. The second highest year was last year, with 372 cases. Seems possible that the U.S. could break both of those records in 2019.
There are 159 cases of measles confirmed in the U.S. this year, the CDC says. That compares to the 13 confirmed cases in the U.S. during the same time period in 2018.

HHS has been hostile toward Planned Parenthood, but it looks like most of the affiliates that received Title X funds in 2017 will get funds in 2018. What we don't know yet is if the $$$ will change.
HHS just announced its Title X grantees, the first awards after the changes in made in the FOA earlier this year. HHS says 12 of the intended awards go to grantees who are new to Title X.		https://t.co/96tXJWaoBb
