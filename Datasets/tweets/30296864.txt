Consent means you asked they said "yes".	Silence means ask; if u did, silence means "I'm too polite, but no."	Drunk means "don't ask" not "don't tell".

Men:	1st hr: 2 beers you are legally drunk at end of hour. After 1st hour and/or first beer, 1 beer/hr at most, any faster you will be drunk and get drunker exponentially faster.

@jessieo321 @simplyemc @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter Is developing empathy considered a developmental task? Is there a window?	You are telling me things I'd remember if I'd been able to sleep since Thursday. I worked child and adolescent psych for 10 years, 15-25 years ago. I really should take more care w/ terminology.
@jessieo321 @simplyemc @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter Sorry about that. I'm getting sloppy. I read the current DSM on PDOs about 9 months ago. But should have reviewed again. They were still teaching Freudian Psychology in the mid-70s when I did my BA Psychology. I'm so old, DSM3 was in use when I 1st worked in a psych hospital.
@jessieo321 @simplyemc @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter Do you know rates of comorbidity for Antisocial PDO? Sociopathic PDO? With Axis One diagnoses? Especially Bi-Polar DO and Major Depression.	I know there's been anecdotal reports that lamotrigine is effective in Borderline PDO w/ BiPolar DO comorbidity, a not uncommon pairing.

@jessieo321 @simplyemc @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter 15-20 yrs ago. Clinical Social Workers, Psychiatric Nurse Practioners and Psychogists were developing treatment modalities. Experienced clinicians were predicting PDOs by 14. Dx at 18. It was widely agreed that by 18-22 PDOs were permanent; learned	compensation, no remediation.
@jessieo321 @simplyemc @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter Makes sense.	Do you have any articles I can read about SSRIs in treatment of APDo children  and adolescents. Or sociopathic adults. Have there been any drug studies?	15 years psychiatrists were convinced PDO were immutable or at least unresponsive to meds.
@jess_paton @dvorakoelling @JimFT3 You should have been around when STUDIO¬∑54 was a thing. Or during the 80s. "The Donald" was a sharp, millionaire playboy.		I've had enough training and experience to suspect an "organic process".	Regardless of any personality problems he may or may not have.
@simplyemc @jessieo321 @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter There are no medications to treat personality disorders as such. Many also have an Axis 1 Dx, like BiPolar D/o or Major Depression. If so, treating that will help. A "Successful Sociopath" can learn to "fake empathy" and obey rules. They just can't FEEL what others call empathy.
@simplyemc @jessieo321 @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter The sociopath is incapable of empathy. (Consistent w/  frontal cortex neurological insufficiency.) They bully, may torture pets, may set fires. They lie not out of ego defense, but due to lack of empathy. "Successful sociopaths" are charming, manipulative, lies w/purpose.
@simplyemc @jessieo321 @Alex19673 @BigYearColo @MJaMitchell @KurtSchlichter You are conflating Sociopathic PDO, with Narcissistic PDO (aka Malignant Narcissism). 	The latter sees himself as ‚Äî at once, both ‚Äî superior &amp; fake. Fears being discovered to be lesser &amp; rejected. Easily manipulated with flattery. Has no interest in empathy. Lies to protect ego.
@dvorakoelling @JimFT3 He was once very bright with an excellent vocabulary. He has always impressed me as the type of person psychogist call the "successful sociopath", which is not a diagnosis but rather a successful use of and compensation for antisocial tendencies (bullying, lying, yet charming).

@johndburger @leroux57_ @debsugar @yashar Doesn't Coca-Cola manufacture the Coke Classic syrup and then sell the same syrup to every bottler; rather than having each bottler manufacture it's own syrup?

@SuperKinvar No &amp; no	Due to evaporation the water will continue to cool until it reaches room temperature or the air reaches 100% relative humidity.	But as long as your body remains above the water temperature it will impart some of its heat to the water. As long as you remain alive.....

@Jd_tha_outlaw @kennedyk24 @OutstandingWC @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon More negligent manslaughter than murder. But still tragic and wrong.	They're supposed everything possible to protect them, did they?
@ForeverGrumps @ejhinojosa @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon That's why I keep wondering why the didn't break the windows and extract that way.
@kennedyk24 @Jd_tha_outlaw @OutstandingWC @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon The flash floods are finished around here. But I have family in the low country of #SC for whom the flooding is still getting worse.
@ForeverGrumps @ejhinojosa @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon I have experience with vehicles in floods. Difficult situation at best.	My question is did they do everything that could be done or did they fail to do everything possible in order to avoid danger to themselves.
@Jd_tha_outlaw @kennedyk24 @OutstandingWC @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon You are being repeatedly misrepresented by @kennedyk24 	He seems to think the guards went out of their way to protect you.	You are saying the abandoned their duty to protect you.	Right?
@kennedyk24 @OutstandingWC @OverlySarcasmic @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon None of us can know with certainty how negligent (or not) these deputies were, without an investigation. These deputies should be suspended and #SC #SLED should investigate.
@kennedyk24 @OutstandingWC @OverlySarcasmic @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon I've long said there are two main types of people who go into law enforcement. Those who want to help people and those who want power over others.
@kennedyk24 @OverlySarcasmic @OutstandingWC @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon No, he's not a murderer unless someone dies. But he may have the attitudes that lead to cop on unarmed PoC killings. #justsaying 	As for these deputies, was there nothing else they could have done?

@DDurante7 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon I worked for #SCDMH for years and years. They have the training but not enough equipment or staff for a mass evacuation.	Sad part is there were over 200 ambulances with full crews from all over the US nearby. Less than a dozen were ever deployed.
@DDurante7 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon I am a retired psychiatric nurse. I've known hundreds, maybe thousands of psych clients. Most wouldn't need doors that don't open from the inside. Without knowing the individuals, neither of us can tell.	SCDMH has vans w/ backdoors that open from inside.
@DeborahResists @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon 1) Do you know many mental health clients? As a psychiatric nurse, I've known hundreds &amp; hundreds! Thousands maybe.	2) The mechanism you describe isn't available. Perhaps you should invent it. But would it be practical?	Doors unlock in a puddle.	Have you been in a tropical storm?
@kennedyk24 @OutstandingWC @RYourig @BMLewis2 @MegKinnardAP @OrangeNixon No, it wasn't, by legal definition, murder. But it may have been negligent manslaughter.	Either way, the deputies will have to live with a lifetime of guilt.	If they don't feel guilty, they have no right to wear the uniform. Who wants inhuman deputies?

@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI My text says it is fallacious to argue against a position based on on the "genetic fallacy". It does not say that personal experience is not evidence. But you can say it is a biased.	We both seem to be using "appeal to authority". Mine an apeal to medical texts, yours to God.
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Thanks for the definition.	Dug out my Logic book.	The "genetic fallacy" is given one sentence.	Basically, it's, "consider the source", where the source is dismissed out of hand.	Closely related to the fallacy "argumentum ad hominem circumstantium".
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Thanks for the definition. 	You've got me digging out my old textbook to find what we called it back in the olden days.	Closely, related is confirmation bias, which seems to be, almost inevitably, coloring both sides of this discussion.
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Trying to bring in information, inevitably the result of my experience because I learned it in nursing school &amp; by further study.	I have avoided using my personal nursing experience involving medically necessary abortions. But I suppose it's unavoidable that it colors my opinion.
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Yes, different definitions, but close.	Yours is what might be required to be shown in court, if abortion were illegal, depending on the wording of the law.	Mine is closer to the medical definition.	There are nuances that Twitter doesn't lend itself to discussing.
@DevinSenaUI Just out of curiosity, do you also claim I'm not allowed to be a Christian if I don't believe the universe was created in 4004 BC (give or take a few years).
Discussing issues with right wingers, I keep being accused of being condescending.	Y'all, HELP.	How can I avoid sounding condescending when I clearly have more information and more carefully considered opinions, rather than talking points.	Really, I don't want to sound mean. üòâ
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Again, as I conceded, it doesn't change the morality. It changes the understanding of the complexities of the issue.	It also doesn't make you  argument any more or less valid.
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI Genetic fallacy? We didn't cover that one in my logic class.	Please explain.
@james_e_gov @thecoffeemonkey @DevinSenaUI YES. Legally and medically it is an induced abortion.
@randpianoman @DevinSenaUI So a woman should be LEGALLY REQUIRED to die so that her baby might live. (Or in many cases just as likely die.)
@randpianoman @DevinSenaUI Judges make that decision every day. Even involving fetuses!
@thecoffeemonkey @james_e_gov @DevinSenaUI Here's an article: on medically necessary abortion. It's not very rigorous medically or statistically, but it is interesting, informative and easily understood.	I can send numerous others with more legal, statistical, medical detail.	https://t.co/YlZIkSgUPL
@thecoffeemonkey @james_e_gov @DevinSenaUI About one of every 1,000 pregnancies results in an extremely life-threatening disorder called eclampsia. Failure to deliver/abort can result in death of both mother and baby.	There many other conditions that are life threatening to mother and/or baby.
