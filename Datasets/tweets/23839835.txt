A letter against Ilhan Omar cited by Trump was signed by some groups with far-right-wing, anti-Muslim views. https://t.co/1CmB0Qt3f9 by @mazmhussain
@BRNBOMR @hamakitenchi @ggreenwald @AOC @IlhanMN I never said she didn't support Omar. I was referencing her own comments about Palestine and how she walked them back and said she was not an "expert" on foreign affairs. Maybe look that up.
@rosiethross Huh? I said it was "unfortunately unsurprising."
@AnandMehtaNYC @gpbhr125 @IlhanMN the draft text was already published yesterday, so no, we have not been told that for 48 hours. It is also strategic to leave her name out to whip the vote count on it. Pelosi et al know what they are doing and it is clearly aimed at her. Not sure why you find this so significant
We saw what happened with @AOC. She said something true about Israel and Palestine and she got attacked and backed off. She is an incredible political force, but on this issue, she stumbled. I hope that changes. @IlhanMN has admirably stood her ground under the greatest pressure.
@AnandMehtaNYC @IlhanMN so what?
What @IlhanMN is doing--taking on major, destructive US foreign policy with refreshing honestly and clarity--is dangerous in Washington DC. She is going to face the full force of both parties because of this. She is a rare voice and deserves our defense. It is going to be ugly.
If we lived in a sane society, those politicians who promote the Israeli government even as it slaughters Palestinians and cozy up to its lobbyists would be the focus of investigation and condemnation. Instead, they attack the woman, @IlhanMN, who bravely calls it out.
@AnandMehtaNYC @IlhanMN It is the entire point of the resolution.
The Democratic Party's throwing of @IlhanMN under the bus is an (unfortunately unsurprising) disgrace. She raised entirely legitimate concerns about US support for the murderous apartheid government of Israel &amp; the subservience of US politicians to the agenda of a foreign power.

@MattMajeune I’d genuinely be interested in his response. I believe he still defends that vote, but I’d need to double check. Not sure he’s been asked about the sanctions.
Bernie Sanders has some serious questions to answer about his vote for the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, signed by Clinton. It codified regime change as US policy. It was influenced by the Project for a New American Century, the neocon politburo. He also supported brutal sanctions

@ashpuhl_tessier There is aid coming in through reputable organizations who are not threatening the overthrow of the government, making threats to put people in GTMO and implying that the military choose defection or death. Have you read the UN report or not?
@ashpuhl_tessier Have you read the UN report on the impact of sanctions? It was done *before* the latest rounds of sanctions and paints an extremely grave picture of the devastating impact. This is not just a couple of weeks of sanctions. US could deliver aid if it wanted to by working thru orgs
Trump: the US needs a wall to keep all the criminals out.	Also Trump: Venezuela should not have any borders and we should be able to come in any time we want, including in an effort to overthrow the government.
@ashpuhl_tessier So you support lifting the sanctions that are costing Venezuela $30 million a day? You support the US actually working through the UN or ICRC to deliver aid instead of demanding unfettered access to a sovereign country? Or through any of the other orgs currently delivering aid?

Imagine if the US was held to some of the standards applied to its enemies. What sanctions should be put in place against the US for the many offensive US wars? State-sanctioned murder/death penalty? Police officers killing people of color with impunity? Prison conditions?
when such tactics are celebrated in the name of bringing democracy or freedom to a suffering people, it should be viewed as barbaric.
Some sanctions the US imposed on Venezuela are going to further harm already suffering people. It is economic warfare. There is a reasonable debate to be had about sanctions targeting individuals but what we are talking about here is collective punishment of civilians.
@Touchdown_al You could argue they played a key role in South Africa at some pretty important moments.
Not all sanctions are created equal. Certain sanctions can serve as a form of justice or prevention of criminal activity. Others, as we saw in Iraq throughout the 1990s, are a form of economic terrorism unleashed on people already living under a brutal dictatorship.
The US regularly uses certain types of economic sanctions as a cudgel targeting civilians in an effort to deprive, starve and kill people into submission. These can be more lethal than military action, yet are constantly painted as some benign alternative to force.
@mikeyoranje88 And what is the term for people who completely ignore the role the US plays?
@mikeyoranje88 I don't know any Latin American leftists as dedicated to ignoring the US role as you have been in this exchange. You actually sound a bit like Elliott Abrams when he talks about Venezuela.
@mikeyoranje88 I am responding to your complete refusal to address the US actions in Venezuela since Chavez came to power, including a coup. If I sound like Chavez, you are doing a great John Bolton imitation.
@mikeyoranje88 Ah, "motherfucker"? That's a clear sign you really know how to argue your oversimplified and factually-challenged case.
@mikeyoranje88 Again, have US sanctions, interventions, destabilization operations played ANY role in creating the situation in Venezuela? Should we just ignore the fact that the most powerful nation in the world has regularly targeted Venezuela, including a coup, since Chavez came to power?
@mikeyoranje88 Let me get this straight: You are actually arguing that the main reason rightist thugs are coming to power is fear of "turn[ing] out like Venezuela"? And by the way, hundreds of thousands of people did not survive the dictatorships and coups and death squads and CIA interventions
@RedRedSuit Specifically, the Democrats who supported Trump's bloated, insane military budget and giving him widespread surveillance powers. If he is as dangerous as they say on cable news constantly, why on earth support giving him sweeping powers even when he doesn't need their votes?
@RedRedSuit I understand what I think you are saying and I don't blanket disagree. For instance, if Trump can end some US troop deployments abroad, I think we should take what we can get. My point was about Dems telling us the sky is falling to then turn around and support bad policy/actors
@RedRedSuit It isn't just expressing opposition to Maduro. It is supporting the Trump agenda and, in some cases, praising the appointment of a known war criminal/Iran-Contra figure to take point on a policy aimed at regime change.
@mikeyoranje88 are you just going to keep revising this same tweet over and over? In your little narrative here, do US sanctions, interventions, regime change, covert operations play any role in destroying the "Latin American left"? Do they play any role in the inequality?
@RedRedSuit If it is INTERNAL, why should the US be directly intervening in Venezuela's affairs while offering sanctions exclusions for Chevron and Halliburton and suggesting Maduro could be sent to Guantanamo? But thanks for clarifying you have any sort of ideological agreement with Trump.
@RedRedSuit Yeah, like this?: Normally I believe people like John Bolton and Elliott Abrams are psychopaths, but I'll give them a chance with this particular regime change because their track record indicates *checks notes*--nope, they are always psychopaths.
@KyleK78 If you watch the video, I answer that question.
This also applies to Democrats backing Trump's massive military spending, authorizing sweeping anti-democratic surveillance powers for the Executive branch and the unwavering backing of Israeli brutality and colonialism.
Democrats tell us Trump is a grave threat to US democracy, perilous for world peace, the worst president ever. But on Venezuela, many leading Democrats are cheering on Trump/Bolton/Pompeo/Pence/Elliott Abrams and their drive for regime change. https://t.co/6BctesQ3aW

@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC I explained why I believe that is possible in my argument. I also explained why I also could see it not happening. You keep just quoting the headline/tweet, but no mention of anything else, including the nuance of the argument. None of it is about having faith in Trump.
@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC In fact, I actually stated bluntly in that piece multiple times what I think of his overall policy, escalation of some wars, drone strikes, killings of civilians, etc. I honestly don’t believe you listened and instead made assumptions based on misreading a headline.
@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC I agree with what I said. I don’t agree with what you say I said because I never said it. This was an ultra-specific nuanced analysis of where we stand with respect to *some* wars. You keep pretending I made a sweeping statement about Trump and war or adventurism. Didn’t happen.
@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC That’s quite different from what you keep telling me I said.
@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC Where did I say that?
@leftistcritic Lol. Not gonna happen
@MathiasdjBerg You don’t think we should understand the long public records of officials who are going to be in charge of very incendiary policy? It doesn’t matter what his record shows? That’s a really odd position.
@leftistcritic PS Neoliberal isn’t a positive synonym for capitalism.
@leftistcritic I actually did an in-depth segment on my podcast about this very issue and the historical connotations of fascism and the application of the label to Trump in the modern era.
@GaganAtreya @adamjohnsonNYC I’m genuinely curious what *specifically* you found troubling. I think it was an accurate description of where we are with these specific post-9/11 wars, which was what it was about.

@AHeimdallr Show me the country Kurdistan on the map. I can show you Germany and Sweden. Not even comparable. This is a mass group of people intentionally kept stateless.
All of which is utterly sickening given the Kurds’ constant struggle for survival against nation state militaries and terrorists. One of the greatest crimes of modern history.
The US has always engaged in a good Kurds/bad Kurds policy wherein the bad Kurds can be slaughtered or imprisoned. The good Kurds are allies as long as their soldiers can be used for US objectives. Kurds have often been used as PR props for US militarism.
The US has an atrocious history regarding the Kurds. In the 90s, Clinton admin was funneling major weapons to Turkey that were knowingly being used to slaughter Kurds en mass. The US provided weapons and intel to Saddam at height of his brutality against Kurds in the 80s.

@JustinRaimondo He was at the White House *yesterday*
10. For those who somehow think this is Trump opposing the war machine, I point you to his massive escalation of drone strikes, his easing of rules for killing civilians, his use of ground troops in Yemen and Somalia and his use of criminal weaponry like the MOAB in Afghanistan.
8. There is a real possibility Trump will withdraw forces from Afghanistan and use Erik Prince’s forces. This must be opposed ferociously.	9. One consequence of major drawdowns could be a dramatic uptick in covert actions and air strikes. Obama embraced that model.
5. This is an opportunity for progressive forces to assert an alternative vision for US foreign policy. 	6. Trump is a crooked charlatan. But these withdrawals would represent a dent in the armor of the bipartisan war machine. 	7. This chaos presents opportunity.
1. I support withdrawing US troops from all these wars, overt and covert.	2. Trump is an unstable authoritarian who cannot be trusted.	3. “Mattis was an adult” is bullshit. He’s a hawkish war criminal.	4. It’s very telling that the war party in DC is furious.

@YourServis I confronted him to his face in 2000 about his war crimes. And have reported on them for decades.
George HW Bush systematically attacked the civilian infrastructure in Iraq. He turned hospitals into death rows for infants. He widely used depleted uranium, causing cancer rates to skyrocket. He made Iraq a mass graveyard. And the killing hasn’t stopped since.
I remember feeling a deep sense of shame and anger when I visited the Amiriyah shelter in Iraq. George HW Bush killed more than 400 civilians huddled there on February 13, 1991. These are the crimes we should be discussing today.

@born2bear @theintercept @jduffyrice Again, if you listen carefully, that point was made and acknowledged by both myself and @jduffyrice.
@born2bear @theintercept I said precisely that in my question. If you listen closely to her answer, I believe that @jduffyrice was addressing that when she said she wouldn't protest his firing for any reason whatsoever. His firing is what caused the protests about Mueller investigation.

@MikeAlbanese Ah. My bad. Should’ve worn my glasses.
@MikeAlbanese Not sure how my comment is “gutting” anyone. It’s a fact. I said her shift was welcome. I would hope this is a lesson to listen earlier to people who actually know the issues, particularly when it comes to preventable mass slaughter.
@86_RSK Huh? I’ve repeatedly criticized Sanders for his positions on US “counterterrorism” policy. Warren has been consistently bad on Yemen for years. That’s just facts.
@MikeAlbanese I don’t view this as a “gift horse.” This was a mass slaughter that went on with not a peep, or with actual, active support, from the most prominent Democrats. You don’t thank people for finally ending their role in systematic murder.

@atrupar uh, that is 100% true as evidenced by the many Never Trumper neocons who are regularly on MSNBC &amp; publicly backed HRC.

@GarySamwich @daveweigel @ggreenwald @Ocasio2018 Let's try this, how about you look at the DoD budget and the defense appropriations and come back and tell me which weapons systems you think are more important than education?

@JeffDeutchman @Ocasio2018 Who “completely exclude[d]” that? I said I don’t place any real hope in it.
@RealSteveCox @Ocasio2018 Also, in NYC, the primary system is completely controlled by the parties and it’s awful. She has chosen the most effective path available to her in an overwhelmingly blue district.
@RealSteveCox @Ocasio2018 I also think the Green Party has made some pretty serious blunders the past 18 years and has failed to secure various benchmarks to run a serious campaign under the US system (which sucks as it is)
@RealSteveCox @Ocasio2018 Obviously, I support independent candidates and runs. This is her strategy and it is terrifying the institutional Dems.
@RealSteveCox @Ocasio2018 Trump took over the GOP by running as GOP. The left needs a bigger imagination.
@RealSteveCox @Ocasio2018 Who anointed these people? She is running as a Democrat who believes the party needs radical change. Should she just wait for Schumer to tell her it’s ok to run?
@JeffDeutchman @Ocasio2018 The institutional Democratic Party is a major part of the problem. And, no, activism doesn’t have to lead to anything involving institutional parties. Change is not the exclusive realm of the electoral process. People power can change things politicians can’t or won’t.
@dnnation @Ocasio2018 What are you talking about?
@dnnation @Ocasio2018 Hillary got more votes. She lost. What’s your point? If @Ocasio2018 wins the primary, she wins in November. No Republican will win that seat.
@JeffDeutchman @Ocasio2018 Uncompromising activists, those willing to challenge establishment politics, those who take to the streets, those who don’t wait for anointed politicians to tell them what to think, people who stand up to authority and a fundamentally unjust system. To name a few.
@dnnation @Ocasio2018 You do realize that in order to not lose to someone like Trump, you have to actually abandon your losing strategy, right? The elite Dems shun progressive voices and try to crush challenges to their lifer politicians.

I don’t place any real hope in electoral politics or the Democratic Party. But it is indisputably true that @Ocasio2018 represents a much-needed new voice. She is taking on the Democratic establishment &amp; has been uncompromising. They fear her because she threatens their fiefdom.

@Notbluebland @esglaude He was just on recently.
@bohmbawerk1 @nowherenorthere @Ocasio2018 History is filled with people with that very view who have been proven wrong over and over. Lack of imagination and will by some shouldn’t stop those who believe we can win and will fight to make it so.

@kbyrne91 Actually, that podcast was an in-depth interview with our reporter who just got back from Arizona and has covered this beat from day 1 of Trump. But his reporting is prolly not as good as your tweets.

@deschainfofo The GOP controls all three branches of government. It is not "Congress." I have absolutely no respect for Schumer, but let's be honest: this is Trump and the GOP leadership right now, in Congress and Executive branch. The majority of Dems don't want this policy.
@deschainfofo I covered Obama's policies on this extensively. And it was horrible then. Trump has taken a relatively infrequent horror and turned it into a blanket policy. In fact, the directive ICE has been given is that it is at the discretion of individual chiefs of station. That's policy

@sarahfuller1930 they came in legally and did not use children to do so. Your point?
Many on the left warned that if we didn't change the bad immigration policies under Obama (deporter in chief) it would only get worse, the unaccountable drone assassination program would expand. This is not just Trump. He is doing the horrid things he promised to do.
@StantonLoman @SerginGarcia The Executive Order, if done justly (big IF), will hopefully put an end to the immediate crisis. It is not a permanent fix at all. But this is an emergency and these are executive agencies--directly under Trump's command. I am not a fan at all of EOs--Obama's, Trump's, Bush's etc
@StantonLoman @SerginGarcia If your only argument is that it is the law, then you need to reckon with the history of that spurious argument.

@MaatMHI He is asserting that God endorses his atrocious, human rights abusing policies, “laws” and government. That is the point. The notion that God gives him the authority.
@davecdnb @intercepted I’m also trying to take into account Moon’s strategy and his deft handling of Trump. I guarantee you Moon thinks he’s a dangerous nut. But he also is using all leverage available to him. And he’s smart to cater to Trump’s ego if it gets the Koreas closer to ending this horror.
@davecdnb @intercepted Ha. See? We actually do agree.
@davecdnb @intercepted My biggest fear is that Kim somehow humiliates Trump and does something Trump promised the world Kim would never do again and then Bolton prevails and these idiots start a war. Basically the fate of the planet is dependent on whims of a fragile ego with severe narcissism. Scary.
@davecdnb @intercepted At the same time, I’m glad that they’ve shifted away from the *let’s wipe North Korea off the map* drumbeat. I fear Trump using a nuke much more than I do NK. Especially because of President Moon’s smart and nuanced diplomacy.
@davecdnb @intercepted Absolutely. That’s why the first media example I gave in the show was about FOX’s utter hypocrisy and propagandizing. Total state media for the absolute worst political elements in our society. In a league of their own.

@davecdnb @intercepted Thanks. And I am always happy and willing to hear thoughtful criticism and/or debate ideas. Thanks for taking the time to listen to our show!
@davecdnb @intercepted I make no excuses for North Korea. I am an American journalist and my primary responsibility is to hold my own government accountable. We all know the horrors of the NK regime. I’m trying to add context seldom discussed in mainstream US discourse.
@davecdnb @intercepted Actually, it was. I discussed forced and prison labor and the masses of people with almost no basic human rights.
@davecdnb @intercepted As for the US conduct, yes it is important to explain that history. Not sure why that is objectionable. Most Americans have no clue what this country actually did to Korea during that war.
@davecdnb @intercepted If you listen carefully, what I actually said was I was impressed with his statement because it was more articulate than any single sentence Trump had ever spoken. The deference commeny was an aside, explaining the cultural context of why he acted the way he did w Trump.
@ScottKaufmann @haircut_hippie The invasion of Iraq turned the country into a horrid sectarian hellscape. Saddam’s popularity has never been higher than it is now. And he was an atrocious dictator. The US managed to make it much worse for many many Iraqis (in addition to killing 100s of thousands of them)
@ScottKaufmann @haircut_hippie The Saudi royals are a threat to many Saudis. Should the US overthrow them? Israel constantly attacks Palestinians with overwhelming disproportionate force. Condemned at the UN by almost every country on earth for its crimes except the US and a few clients. Overthrow them?
@ScottKaufmann @haircut_hippie I was responding to your statement. 1. Bush is a fundamentalist Christian. 2. He did say it was a “crusade.” 3. He was PRESIDENT 4. He attacked multiple Muslim countries based on lies or dubious assertions. 5. It wasn’t our business to overthrow Saddam. Posed no threat to the US.
@C4Marchitecture Hence the word “warped” was used in my statement.
@ScottKaufmann @haircut_hippie Bush declared a “crusade” and then invaded a Muslim country that had nothing to do with 9/11, killing hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
@ToEducate But many of them are not the attorney general and Vice President.
This is born of the same exact heinous line of reasoning and justification used by ISIS when they burn people alive or throw gay people from buildings.

The US chose to respond by overwhelmingly killing civilians and using napalm. North Korea was undoubtedly an aggressor. So was the US, which proceeded to commit widespread war crimes.
@Fortunes_Wheel @beanNugget96 @intercepted Do some actual research on the Korean War. Perhaps look at the work of Bruce Cumings of that radical leftist organization the University of Chicago.

@NippySweetyLass @ajamubaraka I’ve regularly criticized Putin in speeches and on international TV for a wide range of authoritarian issues. But I’m sure you’ve done more with your twitter account.
@NippySweetyLass @ajamubaraka You should tell them that! Because they were furious and demanded I be denounced. But I’m sure your twitter account is more effective than me denouncing them to their faces. Don’t strain yourself getting up from the couch.
@NippySweetyLass @ajamubaraka Lol.
@msolis1982 @intercepted Say what you want. I follow this very closely.
@danzig138 We have covered this case extensively since it happened.
@msolis1982 @intercepted That is an allegation made in an FBI affidavit, not a proven fact. Unless you take the word of the FBI without concern. Perhaps google “parallel construction.” Also, be careful to endorse the Trump DoJ narrative, which is what that is.
@NippySweetyLass @ajamubaraka I just gave an anti-fascist speech *in Italy* the day after that new government formed. And I did it with members of Liga and the military in the audience. So what are you talking about?

@roblevine82 @prisonculture Leonard should have been freed long long ago. When I was a producer at Democracy Now, we directly asked Bill Clinton about his case. Terrible injustice.
@Casenoter @theintercept @RonWyden @MarkWarner It’s been part of the format of the show. We have also done dramatized segments and musical guests and fiction authors. It’s meant as comedy at the beginning. I understand some people don’t like some of these choices.
@FroggerJones @bmaz Huh? See my own record on this. I cover the story regularly. My critique is specific and easily available to read or hear on @intercepted
@Joe35357 Nice edit. I said “Russia and 2016”
@Casenoter @theintercept @RonWyden @MarkWarner It’s the cold open of the show and we do it every week.
@Casenoter @theintercept @RonWyden @MarkWarner Our opening segments are always satire. Always.
@FroggerJones @bmaz You are wildly misconstruing what I said. My question was aimed at people who are talking nonstop about that story and simultaneously ignoring RW mistreatment and prosecution. Totally incongruous.
@JegiNineti @bmaz Did you listen to this show or just spouting off? Did you listen to what @ARetVet said? My guess is nope. You just are talking out of your ass.
@FisherBurton @xerudsoll If you are trying to advocate for helping the government prosecute her, keep going.
@peacecorpdad We have. Do your homework. I’m not your researcher. And you desperately seem to need one given how much you get wrong every time you come at me.
@johanstrauss91 @bmaz By the way, I love @bmaz. Was a bit thrown by his comment, which was why I responded.
@johanstrauss91 @bmaz Ah. My bad. Fucking twitter.
@acpea @micahflee That’s a challenge grant in matching funds. That is a small part of the funding of her defense by First Look.
@AuAgainstTrump Tell us more about what Reality Winner thinks. Are you her cell mate? She told you this?
@JegiNineti @bmaz Have you read her commendations? Do you know what programs she worked on? It’s an indisputable fact.
@xerudsoll “She was caught because of your publication.” That’s what you wrote. How do you know that’s true? Have you ever heard of parallel construction? She has also pled not guilty.
@xerudsoll If that’s true, you may want to consider reviewing your parroting of the prosecution’s allegations as fact.
@johanstrauss91 @bmaz So we should be doctrinaire and only publish certain views? I’m proud of the diversity of views and perspectives we publish, even as I regularly disagree with some of it.
@acpea @micahflee I’m not your researcher. Also it is way way more than you seem to think.
@Brosner85 Yep. I follow it.
@xerudsoll No, it’s possible to make mistakes and also have other reasons why things happen. Have you ever seen a real trial? Are you familiar with the burden of proof? Are you aware she pled not guilty?
@koush I don’t care what you tweet. Just suggesting you listen to the show you jumped here to critique.
@bmaz Please point to specifics, Bill. I’ve covered pretty much every aspect of the investigation. My colleagues have as well. Your objection is that we have published voices skeptical of various aspects of it as well? For real?
@koush I feel like you didn’t actually listen to it before tweeting.
@xerudsoll 1. Those are unproven allegations from the Trump DoJ, 2. We speak openly about Intercept mistakes and implemented changes 3. Yes, we are paying for her defense. Anything else?

@roulettesdare @On_Politike So when other people try to free family members serving life for non-violent drug offenses they are just full of shit and it has zero to do with the horrid policies? Got it.

@JustinRaimondo @theintercept Let me know when that anti-war Trump you promoted shows up.
@hashallthehash @thekhemistlives @bencoccio @MattFoulger Unlike you, I can cite specific cases of Russian journalists murdered. Because I’m not an opportunist like you and actually care about the murder of any journalist, unlike you. For you, it’s part of your partisan line. It’s pretty gross of you.
@hashallthehash @thekhemistlives @bencoccio @MattFoulger Your lack of conscience on the murder of non-Russian journalists is noted. Shameful really.

@bencoccio @Sakaushka @MattFoulger There is a pattern of people these days blaming Russia for so many things that it’s hard to keep track of. I think it’s counter-productive to encourage a culture where assumption passes as fact. And it’s pervasive.

@bencoccio @Sakaushka @MattFoulger Well, you seem to care enough to defend “randos” who pushed fake information.
@bencoccio @MattFoulger This is so tired. I made my point clear. Some of you reacted in a telling, defensive way. I wonder how many of you raise a ruckus when the US kills journalists or other countries murder them? Or is it just Russian journalists you care about?
@bencoccio Did you protest the killing of Jose Couso? The killing of Tariq Ayoub? The imprisonment of Sami al Hajj? The bombing of multiple Al Jazeera offices?
@bencoccio @MattFoulger Lol. I’ve literally criticized Putin on international and national television and in public speeches on a variety of human rights abuses and targeting journalists. My issue is with hysterical fact-free assertions.
@bencoccio People tweeting that Putin definitely killed him is what I’m referring to, not those who believed he was actually dead, which was widely reported.
@3Tyll @MattFoulger Nope. I made zero factual errors in this discussion.
@TheJimBond @ggreenwald Are you saying you can’t read?
@bencoccio @MattFoulger Let me ask you something since I don’t know you: what have you done to protest the killing of journalists around the world? You can look at my long track record on the killing and imprisonment of journalists around the world. Such curious, defensive reactions to me stating a fact
@de79dc @bencoccio @MattFoulger did AP report that Putin killed him? As a fact?
@NicoDelon Maybe? Seriously? He is not dead. People claimed to know who killed him. What do you mean “maybe”?
@monghe_baozhi Great WhatAboutIsm. Are the Soviets feeding you these lines?
@bencoccio @MattFoulger I prefer to make specific allegations once we have the facts.
@bencoccio Does it say he’s actually dead? Or do you agree that people ran around stating something as a fact that is demonstrably false?
@MattFoulger 1. Social media was filled with people stating Putin killed him. 2. That was clearly false 3. So the response now is, yeah, but I’m sure he was plotting to kill him. Do facts actually matter anymore or can we just say whatever we *feel* is true because Russia bad/Putin bad?

@VerseofaRose this is a very long conversation, but an important one. I'll try to do a segment on all of this. One thing I learned on the ground in Kosovo was that the US bombing escalated Serbian actions and "cleaning" operations.
@maurobotomy also, Clinton didn't just bomb Serbia in 1999, but also Montenegro.
@maurobotomy That was its official name. I also think it was a total dishonor to the history of Yugoslavia.
@maurobotomy Actually, that is not true (at least not technically) Serbia and Montenegro were the last two republics constituting the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999.

@chrislhayes After talking to a lot of people on the hill, I’m convinced Rand Paul would not have switched his vote. Flake is on the way out and has higher ambitions, so he may have stuck with it to separate himself from Trump. In any case, no defense for voting for her whatsoever.
@Fattyowl They would have lost if they didn’t have those 6 Democrats vote with them.
@Tiffy_we_dat How brave of you!
Exactly. https://t.co/FVS73cjGOu
Let’s be clear: if those Democrats who voted for Haspel had voted against her, she would not have been confirmed.
This was never just about Gina Haspel. This is about a nation that claims constantly to be exceptional and morally superior showing the world in clear terms that it supports torture and will never hold its own accountable.

@peacecorpdad @truthhurts0409 Wow. Maybe you should tell that to the Democratic staffers running the whip count. Because they have a very different understanding than you. They are furious at these Democratic senators because, as of 2 days ago, their tally had her defeated. You’re making a fool of yourself.
@peacecorpdad You probably need to take some basic civics lessons.
@peacecorpdad Are you really that dumb? Without these Democrats, she would likely have been blocked. They are making this happen.
If these 6 Democrats did not join the overwhelming majority of Republicans in supporting Gina Haspel, her nomination very well may have been blocked.

@SienaSaid he's a Republican and is absolutely supporting Haspel.
@rareyrare @ybbkaren Have you considered that a lot of people at CIA may not be inclined to listen to Cotton or have any respect for him, but they clearly love Haspel, in part because of her refusal to denounce anything that she &amp; they did? You're focused on Cotton's rhetoric &amp; missing the real issue
@CHINESE_BAGELCO the show '24' is not a documentary.
@ybbkaren She refused to say torture was immoral and she says to Warner she won't do something against her moral values. SHE. DOES. NOT. CONSIDER. TORTURE. IMMORAL. If you don't see the game she and the CIA are playing here, I can't help you.

@ybbkaren she does not *oppose* torture. Did you watch the hearing? Words are cheap. Actions matter. We don't even know a fraction of the details about her involvement with heinous acts and what we do know should be evidence in a criminal prosecution.
@ybbkaren One of those two people has actually tortured people.

@pages_raul @davidkfry @BarmakN What I think doesn’t matter. What I know is that morals are not contingent upon who “wins” a war. Wrong is wrong whether done by the victor or vanquished. The US doesn’t believe it should be held to standards applied to other nations. I reject that completely.
@pages_raul @BarmakN @myopinionsrgood What the fuck are you talking about? Where did I ever say I wanted anyone executed? Are you on some hallucinogens?
@pages_raul @davidkfry @BarmakN Sadat was assassinated. And Haspel isn’t expressing some major conversion. The opposite. Also, your logic that victor’s justice is actual justice is pretty indefensible.
@pages_raul @BarmakN @myopinionsrgood Waterboarding was hardly the only acts of torture committed against prisoners at the CIA black site. In fact, other tactics were similar to “other acts of torture” committee by Japanese soldiers and secret police.
@pages_raul @BarmakN @myopinionsrgood Not just prison. Hard labor.
@pages_raul @davidkfry @BarmakN Apply that logic to people from other nations who commit war crimes. Let’s not just judge them on torturing someone. Let’s instead focus on how good they are at some other thing they did. Imagine that being grounds to acquit someone of stealing a car. Yeah, he did that, but...
@MonitorBroke Both times Brennan was nominated I took the same positions I take on Haspel, as did the ACLU and other organizations. A lot of us have been consistent on this for years and through Democratic and Republican admins. She is the current nominee. Just her. That’s why the focus.
@myopinionsrgood @pages_raul @BarmakN That was not at Nuremberg, but at the parallel trials for Japan, known as the Tokyo Trials. Numerous people were sentenced to hard labor for waterboarding and other forms of torture of prisoners. It is an apt comparison.
"Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment." 4/4

@bidupedo @samhusseini Oh, that was definitely one of the pre-planned semantic strategies.
@spearsjohnson @Hisham973 @KamalaHarris I don’t believe it was legal. I was saying that was the Washington consensus. The Bush DOJ basically redefined all sorts of terms in a diabolical effort to shroud torture in legality.
@PeteGowdy I am aware of what Kristol and Bush say on TV these days. My point still stands. They hate Trump the man, yet he is fulfilling many of their most beloved policies.
@WilliamDuffiel5 @Snowden FDR approved internment camps for Japanese Americans, therefore it was right to do it. That's the logic you are using here?

@stripedbanana3 @DonteStallworth @Ali_H_Soufan Yeah, I'm sure you know more about this than @Ali_H_Soufan, who did some of the most important interrogations of the 9/11 aftermath and, before that, the USS Cole case.
@gpuri My statement that you objected to is accurate and based on primary sources, not google searches.
@gpuri Cite a specific case where someone was killed for the singular act of waterboarding. I am very familiar with what McCain and Scott said. The people who were killed had many charges against them, not just waterboarding. Specific facts matter.
@Debstermistress I said *neoconservatives*
Trump is awesome for the neoconservatives. They get all the stuff they want against Muslim countries, full support of/subservience to Israel and Netanyahu and then they also get a return to Cold War mentality toward Russia with the support of the Democrats and MSNBC.
@gpuri at the Tokyo trials, they were generally sentenced to prison labor terms after being convicted. There are a few known cases of executions, though those often included many other war crimes charges. If you have specific cases, please share. I read a lot of the case files.

@SarahDiGloria @raindogtweets @KamalaHarris Have you read @Ali_H_Soufan’s book about how the CIA torture completely fucked up intel operations that were succeeding without torture? Also, lots of evidence that CIA torture inspired terrorism. I don’t get how people still don’t understand this.
@honeywilson10 @tamashburn @DonCheadle Yeah. What would you have done in Jeffrey Dahmer’s shoes? You wouldn’t know if you’d drill into a human head or not unless you kidnapped them and drugged them. So let’s not criticize him. Right?

@stripedbanana3 @DonteStallworth perhaps you should read @Ali_H_Soufan's account of torture and how it was absolutely counter-productive.
The real problem here is that Haspel is the perfect person to run the CIA in the eyes of the CIA--because of her atrocious track record on torture, her refusal to denounce it and her support for destroying evidence.

Sen. @KamalaHarris asks Haspel if CIA torture was immoral. Haspel refuses to answer.

@GoranDFW Have fun with the groupthink cult!
@GoranDFW I hope you find an ability to be honest. You seem to have a serious problem with facts (you didn’t cite any).
Gina Haspel is good because she follows orders, no matter how heinous. That’s the line now for supporting *President Donald Trump’s* pick as CIA director? I can’t imagine what could go wrong.
@GoranDFW You have no idea what you’re talking about. Your issue with me is that I don’t worship Democrats and have the audacity to report on and criticize them.
@GoranDFW Ah yes. The Soviets. You are the worst kind of fool, an intellectually dishonest one.
@GoranDFW Please point to those writings. I can point you to scores and scores of pieces going after Trump. You do realize that just saying something without evidence (doesn’t exist) doesn’t make it true? You clearly have no clue what I do.
@GoranDFW For the millionth time. I have spent the overwhelming majority of the past year doing journalism and analysis about Trump. I spent 8 years doing it during Bush-Cheney. Are you willfully ignoring this or just lazy?
@GoranDFW So how did you vote as a result of Brennan’s spying? That’s what you claimed. Please explain what vote you cast that addressed this. You seem to not understand how the electoral system works.
@GoranDFW @JohnBrennan Given that I spend the majority of my time the past year going after Trump (which you conveniently ignore), explain what I’m doing wrong. It seems you don’t believe I should ever say a word about the Democrats.
@ogokaelo @primal_species Lol. Do you know anything about her?
@GoranDFW Voted for what? He was CIA director under Obama. What vote did you cast opposing Brennan spying on the Senate Democrats?
@GoranDFW @JohnBrennan Let’s make this easier for you: I have a 20-year record of reporting aggressively on the GOP. I have hosted a weekly show since Trump was elected focused on exposing his policies. What you don’t like is any criticism of Democrats, right? I should not say a word about them.
@ogokaelo @primal_species Do you have a basic problem with reading comprehension?
@ogokaelo @primal_species yes. Poor Gina. The bad people made her do all these things. Let's not do any questioning of the nominee for CIA director. Do you hear yourself?
@GoranDFW @JohnBrennan No, you are a radical partisan and clearly cannot think for yourself. I believe in holding all of those in power accountable, including your messiahs.
@ogokaelo @primal_species "scapegoat"? So, we should not be concerned that someone deeply involved with torture and destruction of evidence running the CIA? How is questioning a nominee for CIA DIRECTOR "scapegoating"?
@GoranDFW OK. What did you do to oppose John Brennan running a CIA operation to spy on the Democrats investigation into CIA torture?
@GoranDFW @JohnBrennan Let's compare our work in confronting and fighting the GOP agenda. I have a 20 year track record that includes major investigations, a weekly show, Congressional testimony, sparking investigations, reporting from war zones and on and on. Now let's do you.
Haspel "was a mid-level person just following orders..." says her friend and CIA colleague Rollie Flynn. Hmm. Where have we heard that line before?
@monghe_baozhi @JohnBrennan show me just one example of me giving the Republicans a pass. I know where the GOP stands on this issue. Democrats claim to offer a different view on torture. Let's see that in practice.
@GoranDFW @JohnBrennan Nope. You are just annoyed that I am not a partisan lemming and have the audacity to hold Democrats accountable. I have written books dealing with massive crimes committed by Republicans and have spent the past year doing a weekly show analyzing and exposing Trump's agenda.
@monghe_baozhi @JohnBrennan huh? Do you really not get the point?
@monghe_baozhi @JohnBrennan very very few of them have ever pretended to be against CIA torture, except in empty platitudes.
Any Democrat who votes to confirm Haspel should be hounded non-stop and primaried. And Haspel's endorsement from @JohnBrennan, the drone warrior and torture defender who oversaw the CIA spying on the Senate, is telling. https://t.co/6XJBGR3Da2

@World_W_No_End @khaake @jaketapper you want her under oath, but Mueller doesn't have to talk to her? OK. By the way, what kind of jail time did Clapper get for lying under oath?
@World_W_No_End @khaake No, my argument was that people who said Stein hasn't been asked or hasn't answered questions about the dinner were either ignorant or lying. What has Stein not been asked that you believe she should be? Also, what is she going to be indicted for?

@bencoccio @drogon_dracarys look at the retweet of CNN journalist that started this. Clear as day what the implication was.
@bencoccio @drogon_dracarys Many Democrats are literally accusing Stein of being a Russian asset &amp; working directly for Putin. That is precisely what the context of HUAC was--these people must be secret Soviet agents. As though her entire public record isn't available for all to see her long held beliefs.

has anyone considered how mitch mcconnell's uncircumcised neck felt about @michelleisawolf's routine?
@JayManning1977 @tsundamnn @schwarz Yeah. My only point was about the bullshit civility police at that dinner.
@JayManning1977 @tsundamnn @schwarz You’re missing the point. All of these whiny elite media types are all in a huff about Michelle Wolf’s jokes. As they were about Larry Willmore. But they have no such issue with drone jokes from a POTUS who was regularly killing civilians with drones. Or Bush’s WMD jokes.

@Yfiv3 Good chatting with you.
@DanaHoule Please explain how I am “championing” anyone by tweeting an article I didn’t write or edit. You are as bad a propagandist as some of the people you claim to fight against.
@Yfiv3 @tdominic I have good friends who spend their lives representing poor people and they have to fight every single second to have rights of their clients respected. The deck is stacked entirely against them in every possible way. That’s why I cringe when I see inaccurate characterizations.

@Yfiv3 Anyway, this is likely a semantic issue. It seems we more or less agree.
@Yfiv3 Well, as we all know, poor people are most impacted by everything wrong with the justice system. I also know a lot of lawyers who defend poor people and the struggle to make sure the jury understands a basic fact about the 5th.

@Yfiv3 Again, what’s your source for what “most poor people” think about the 5th. You’re arguing against a point I didn’t make.
@Yfiv3 You’re arguing against something I didn’t say. My point was about you speaking for “most poor people” and how they view the 5th amendment.
@Yfiv3 That’s not the mentality of most of the lawyers I know who are working around the clock representing poor people. No doubt that happens, but I don’t get a sense you are basing your broad conclusion on fact, but rather assumption. If you have a source, that would be helpful.
@Yfiv3 I said nothing of the sort. The opposite. I was just asking what your source was for what “most poor people” think about the 5th.
@zachhotz No. You have the right to not speak when arrested and at trial and it can’t (rightly) be used against you under the law, in criminal cases. Civil can be a different ball game and can be factored in.
@mattaknox @Yfiv3 Yes. No doubt.
@Yfiv3 I think Cohen is a shady character who is likely guilty of a ton of shit we don’t even know about. I also believe it’s dangerous to contribute to an already bad narrative about what it means to exercise the 5th.
@Yfiv3 What are you basing this on? How do you know what “most poor people” see the 5th as?
@Yfiv3 I didn’t mention Cohen. You brought it up.
@mattaknox @Yfiv3 I’m sorry, but that’s just not true. Is that one reason people plead the 5th? Yes. There are lots of innocent people who get convicted/in trouble because they don’t exercise the 5th. Because of the perception that the 5th means you’re guilty.
@World_W_No_End Your response is the precise reason this needs to be clarified. You either believe in the right for all or you don’t.
@Yfiv3 There’s so much evidence already with or without the 5th. Him using the 5th so he doesn’t incriminate himself further is not the same as everyone who takes the 5th is guilty. That’s my point.
@yknelly To correct an error that I’ve seen pushed a lot because of the Cohen situation. Misrepresenting the 5th Amendment will hurt poor people the most. Already does.
@Yfiv3 We all get the context. My point is that it is very short-sighted to say that taking the 5th=guilt. Poor people are most impacted by that mentality. All the time in court.
@comfortstarr Did I say that? I am trying to correct an unfortunate error/dangerous concept I see a lot of people promoting.
@yknelly My point is what I stated. Is it inaccurate? No.
@EmbraceTheBald While I definitely agree that seems to be the case with Trump, I see a lot of Trump opponents also not getting it, which is unfortunate. That mentality will ultimately be used against disenfranchised people. It already is. All the time.
@Yfiv3 No. I’m concerned about how this mentality will later be weaponized to further punish poor people and others caught in an unfair justice system that often presumes their guilt.
I think some people aren’t really factoring in how damaging it is to stake out positions based on the people involved rather than the precedent it sets. Very short-sighted and will come back around.
People who say that someone pleading the 5th means they’re guilty have zero understanding of the rights the amendment protects. A lot of people who got coerced into false confessions when they didn’t exercise the 5th have gone to jail despite their innocence.

@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel Wrong. This isn't about court. This is about what Libby did. The public record is clear on this. Riddle me this: what happened to all the people who leaked info on the OBL raid? Were they arrested? Convicted? No. According to your "logic," that means no one leaked anything.
@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel LOL. If you believe that all leakers are convicted or that only one person can leak the same information, I have a bridge to sell you in London. You continue to miss the point entirely.
@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel Are you aware of Libby's testimony? Have you ever read any primary documents on this case? Because it seems you read one opinion piece and suddenly think you know more than journalists who reported on this case for years.
@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel My god, you are thick in the head. She wrote an Op-Ed summarizing her *reporting* on the case. That is different than just giving an opinion, as was the case with the piece you cited.
@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel Let me help you out here. Marcy Wheeler, who covered this from start to finish, summarized the evidence in an Op-Ed. This was based on her reporting, meaning documenting of facts: https://t.co/KNBXSZ9uKR https://t.co/c0bNmxx55N

@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears @emptywheel that's an *opinion* piece. Try harder. We are dealing in facts here.
@Global_Occupant @hewhohathears you have no idea what you are talking about. Try reading the journalism of people who actually reported on this extensively at the time and have reviewed actual primary documents. See, for example, the work of @emptywheel. My guess is that you won't.
@zachjcarter Not all sanctions are created equal. Some target civilians to encourage uprisings. Others target personal assets of individuals. Also, BDS is hardly the same as Iraq sanctions from the 1990s. It is more akin to people boycotting apartheid South Africa.

@JohnnyDBlakley I believe Trump represents a unique set of threats, no doubt. I also believe that on some issues, he has a lot of catching up to do, such as mass global killing. Bush and Cheney and Kissinger have him beat cold for now.
@JohnnyDBlakley @mrcraigbeckett I didn’t take it personally. I’m all for debates and discourse with thoughtful people. Twitter can be an ugly place.
@kerim_kivrak @JohnnyDBlakley I’m sorry you think my twitter account should cater to your specific view.
@kerim_kivrak @JohnnyDBlakley Again, I dispute that study. I spent extensive time during the 90s in Iraq and reported extensively on all of this for many years. I can point to many other surveys on this very subject. Not sure why you are so committed to that one study and think it somehow changes Albright.
@kerim_kivrak @JohnnyDBlakley It’s Twitter. She was on tv. It was what popped into my head. That’s sort of what this venue is for.
@JohnnyDBlakley I often read books and memoirs by people I don’t like or agree with, especially public officials. But there is a tendency to lionize people without understanding what they’ve actually done themselves. I think that’s dangerous. It doesn’t sound like that’s your view either.
@JohnnyDBlakley How on earth am I attacking you? I was responding politely even though you used the word "dumb."
@PaulBarach @JasonCaley I don't trust the commentary of such people who have made their lives in government on the suffering of others and used their time in office to promote unbridled US militarism.
@kerim_kivrak @JohnnyDBlakley That report is hardly definitive and is contested by the former heads of the UN program in Iraq. Also, Albright did not answer by saying, "that's not true or we contest those numbers." She defended the policy when asked to comment on half a million deaths.
@JohnnyDBlakley I've been very clear on who Trump is and the threats it poses. I was attacked for stating on national TV that he would be a fascist-type figure in early 2016. Here is the transcript of the speech I gave in DC the night he was inaugurated: https://t.co/XwajnxOdfu
@JohnnyDBlakley My issue with Albright is that she is extremely pugnacious and has seldom met a US military action she hasn't supported. If her argument was: I made all these terrible mistakes and here is what I learned, then I would get that. But she whitewashes US militarism, including Trump's
@PaulBarach @JasonCaley she used her experience to push for wars, military strikes, murderous sanctions &amp; on and on. I don't have time for people who believe that US crimes are non-existent. It obliterates any notion that she is credible at assessing moral criminality when her expertise is war advocacy.
@JohnnyDBlakley Appreciate the kind words, but not sure what you believe is dumb. 1. She did justify those half a million deaths in an interview with 60 Minutes. 2. As Secretary of State, she was very fond of cruise missile attacks and remains a promoter of such attacks.
When Madeleine Albright isn't justifying the deaths of half a million Iraqi children from economic sanctions, she's warning us all about the rise of fascism. Also, fun fact: Her favorite humanitarian tool is the cruise missile.

@DrewWestLA @ggreenwald Muted? Lol. I’ve been doing a weekly show for more than a year about every issue you can possibly imagine relating to Trump. Check your facts.
@MWJ1231 @FoxNews @BillKristol Been doing it for 18 years.
@UmW8What haha. You are so transparently stupid. You claimed it was fake news and it was exactly what he said. Sorry you didn't bother to read your fave guy's own statement before making an ass of yourself.
@Caprio2Caprio you are lost. I was correcting your idiotic buddy who didn't read Trump's statement and claimed his comment about hearing Libby was treated unfairly was fake news when it was actually in the official statement. Of course Trump wouldn't say anything about what Libby did.
@DawgsWillHunt @AdotSad @ChanceTheTweetr @ggreenwald Here is Glenn's handle: @ggreenwald. You seem lost. Not sure how things work with you, but in the real world we are all responsible for our own views and actions.
@Caprio2Caprio wrong. https://t.co/EuI7ktfNHo “I don’t know Mr. Libby,” said President Trump, “but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly.  Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”
@UmW8What Here is that fake news liberal media organization known as the White House "reporting" on Trump's own statement: https://t.co/EuI7ktfNHo
It was in his official statement, genius. https://t.co/eeai20IyhB
I'm really excited about an experimental project @intercepted is doing with Wallace Shawn. We produced an old-school radio drama that deals with targeted killing, #METOO and democratically-elected authoritarians. It drops next Wednesday at @theintercept &amp; on our podcast feed! https://t.co/KiuRF6yA3x
@UmW8What He said he "heard" he was "treated unfairly"? Nope.
Can you imagine the ape shit response if Obama pardoned someone because he "heard" they were "treated unfairly"?
@johnwrollins 100% true. Sorry you have trouble with facts.
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald Of course. This isn't about "supporting" the Iraq war.
Libby disclosed Plame's name to two reporters, Judy Miller and Matthew Cooper. Yes, he did leak it. As did Armitage. There was not only one person involved in this, but it is interesting to see the pathetic defense of this pardon. https://t.co/E6aQLUINOL
@vincevitrano @CountyParks Is that a Trump golf course?
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald I understand @ggreenwald's logic and rationale and I believe it is 100% sincere. I just disagree with it.
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald Glenn and I have debated his appearances on FOX. I have made my position on this clear. If you are interested, you can find it. We addressed this during a video debate I moderated on @theintercept between Glenn and Risen.
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald See the other tweets Glenn posted on this, including directly quoting Kristol on Libby. I was responding to a variety of things, not just Libby's pardon.
Big congrats to @joshbegley. All of his work is amazing. If you don't know, go down that rabbit hole! https://t.co/4rI2G3aYj4
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald show me where I have ever done that. Because I can show you the exact opposite. But lying seems to be your thing.
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald are you always this dishonest?
@mainstreetwav i hate twitter
@mainstreetwav He is on MSNBC constantly. Just do a simple search: https://t.co/CxslJSyOGv
@AdotSad @gallarway @ggreenwald "supported the Iraq war" is not even close to what I am talking about. Do you actually understand who Kristol is?
@derivative_of_f yeah, we played that last week on @intercepted
@RDKentBryant @AdotSad @ggreenwald I never get this logic and it seems very common. A. This is twitter and people offer all sorts of views and perspective spontaneously. B. Are you saying that people shouldn't make relevant points unless you approve of the timing? C. This is TWITTER.
@AdotSad @ChanceTheTweetr @ggreenwald actually, my point is that by sanitizing these vile neocons--because it aligns with their opposition to Trump--they do a disservice to their viewers by not explaining their direct role in disastrous policies because it gives the impression that these are people to be trusted.
@bradkimmel they both spoke to journalists about it and confirmed her identity.
@AdotSad @ggreenwald lol. You actually think *most* Americans, including those who watch MSNBC, know anything at all about Bill Kristol and therefore it doesn't matter that they leave out info that totally disqualifies him as an analyst or expert? OK.
More like G. Gordon Libby, amirite?
Ok for people who *truly* don't get the meaning here, SCOOTER LIBBY WAS INVOLVED WITH THE EXPOSURE OF THE IDENTITY OF AN UNDERCOVER CIA OPERATIVE IN RETALIATION FOR HER HUSBAND EXPOSING THE YELLOW CAKE URANIUM LIE IN LEAD UP TO IRAQ WAR.
RT @EricLiptonNYT: It is official. Pardon for Scooter Libby. https://t.co/kMiPYZt2D3
@AdotSad @ggreenwald Bill Kristol wrote some of the most full-throated defenses of Scooter Libby. And the Iraq war. And on and on. Yet MSNBC has him on regularly to speak as though he was involved with none of that and it does not speak directly to his credibility and overall heinousness.
@macinjay @ggreenwald wrong.
@WeMeantWell lean forward, look forward.
@AdotSad @ggreenwald How can you justify having someone complicit in mass killings and a disastrous war based on lies on MSNBC as an analyst without bringing that up every time so that viewers understand the vile nature of this person and their track record of pushing lies?
Let's remember what Scooter Libby did: He helped out an undercover CIA operative in retaliation for her husband debunking the "yellow cake" uranium lie that was used to sell the war in Iraq.
@ggreenwald Bill Kristol could murder someone on 5th Avenue and he would still be welcome on MSNBC to oppose Trump, as though Kristol should have *any* role in society except being publicly shamed for his role in policies of mass killing and wars based on fraud.

@Commissar_Jay @ArarMaher who said it was?
@MaxBlumenthal and what I am actually doing right now journalistically is producing a story for tomorrow arguing against any US military actions in Syria. If you see yourself in that tweet you responded to, then I can't help you.
@MaxBlumenthal oh please. I have spoken out repeatedly, including on CNN and MSNBC, against this war, US proxies, etc. from the beginning. It's so bizarre you are going bonkers over a tweet.
@RaniaKhalek @ArarMaher @ryan_p_alford It's not hostility. I just find it ironic that you are telling people they should be all hands on deck while you argue on Twitter.
@RaniaKhalek @ArarMaher @ryan_p_alford He accused me of making an "endorsement of al-Qaeda" b/c I used word "resistance" when describing AQ-backed factions fighting Assad. I've spoken repeatedly against AQ-backed &amp; CIA-backed forces &amp; he knows it. But propagandists gonna propagandize. He seems to have lot of free time
@RaniaKhalek @ArarMaher @ryan_p_alford he was so full of propagandistic bullshit that it is hard to keep it all straight. And you have spent quite a bit of time arguing on Twitter today about semantics and telling other people how they should be using their time to stop a war.
@XxJeminyeXIII yes. Not just hesitant, but to be absolutely against it.
@Djompara @ggreenwald I lived in Belgrade during the bombing and reported daily on it.
@RaniaKhalek @ArarMaher @ryan_p_alford what I found morbidly funny was the suggestion that I support AQ, as one of your friends disgustingly suggested a while back. You didn't make clear who you were talking to, me or Maher.
@halaljew Interesting that you mention the Syrian Army and soldiers and government, but not civilians. Civilians always pay the highest price.
@RaniaKhalek @ArarMaher @ryan_p_alford lol. What?
@RaniaKhalek @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher I was responding on twitter to trolls conflating the Syrian people with Assad. I find it a strange position.
@RaniaKhalek @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher You have also used "pro-Assad" before.
@RaniaKhalek @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher Rania, did you delete your tweets that replaced "Syria" with "Assad," including that you "won't lose sleep over the bombing of Assad military installations"?
@_whitneywebb @ryan_p_alford Lol. keep trying.
Interesting.... https://t.co/DLSg4AEdwK
@_whitneywebb I feel sorry for you regarding your phrase "Sure Maher was tortured in Syria but..." Gross. Show me where I've supported any force in Syria, particularly CIA-funded ones. Because I can point to me explicitly condemning CIA backed groups, including as all of this was just starting
@_whitneywebb @ryan_p_alford show me something *I* wrote or said in an interview or on my podcast that suggests I have supported al Qaeda in Syria or have ever been anything but opposed to US militarism in Syria. You can't.
@emmalineJen @TopTSlo @ArarMaher Oh please. I was responding to trolls on *twitter.* I've been speaking out against this war from the start and continue to. I have done multiple shows on this and have another one coming out in the morning.
@0LIVlAHYE @taiganist @KiranOpal show me where I supported regime change anywhere. You are just lying and demonstrably so.
@_whitneywebb so you don't know anything about that case then? Or you just don't want to bother checking the facts because it doesn't fit your narrative? Either way, it's sad.

@ryan_p_alford @_whitneywebb I just finished an interview on this very subject that I will be posting tomorrow.
@taiganist @KiranOpal huh? I was totally opposed to the US-facilitated regime change and bombing of Libya. Spend 2 minutes researching that. What are you talking about?
@ryan_p_alford @_whitneywebb On multiple occasions, I have used what little time I ever spend on corporate television opposing US bombing of Syria. Have been opposed from the beginning. And, yes, I am responding to weird pro-Assad trolls. If you feel that's you, then I can't help that.

@ryan_p_alford @_whitneywebb enjoy the nutty voices running through your heads, filled with fiction.
@_whitneywebb Do a tiny bit of research on the case of Maher Arar and then come back and tell me what you found. He was tortured by Assad's regime for the CIA after being kidnapped at JFK airport post-9-11.
@corderoenvivo @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher you are making an ass of yourself. And, no, I have never supported US political leaders with major human rights violations. Go ahead and try to find an example. I won't wait because it doesn't exist.
@Stallinguist @MattCrossin @ArarMaher Hmm. I am a founder of The Intercept and you can easily find me going on MSNBC and CNN and elsewhere for years opposing exactly that, but I suppose the fiction in your head is screaming louder than facts. https://t.co/l2FpCMi91P
@corderoenvivo @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher check your facts. You can find many examples of my position, like this when all this was starting: https://t.co/l2FpCMi91P
@damevintage @ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher @theintercept I have talked about that for years and years, including on MSNBC against a former Obama official. https://t.co/l2FpCMi91P
@ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher I've never suggested we should believe any US/NATO allegations without clear evidence. I have always been 100% against US attacks in Syria and remain so. I am responding to bizarre Assad fans, who do not have a monopoly on opposing US/NATO bombing and covert ops.
@ryan_p_alford @ArarMaher Opposing US military action, as I have always done on Syria, does not require a bizarre affinity for Assad. Saddam was at his most brutal when the US was supporting him. Assad tortured people for the CIA. Facts are facts.
@TopTSlo @ArarMaher I am stating a fact that Bashar al Assad tortured people for the CIA. You support that?
@fitzsij so you are still blessing white supremacy? got it.
Was Bashar al Assad cool when he tortured @ArarMaher for the CIA or is it a more recent phenomenon?
@fitzsij are you still blessing white supremacy and the murder of small animals for fun?
@ggreenwald @democracynow No, Glenn, you have to be either pro-Assad or pro-NATO. Those are the only two positions.

@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald Yes. And taking the FBI or unproven analysis or speculation as fact and hurling them around is very damaging to her case, which is why we are not offering any refutations right now, as much as I would like us to.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald They are all printing speculation, which can go in many different directions, including being wrong. Do you understand the difference between analytical speculation and proven fact?
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald and all of them are speculative. What's your point. I can speculate that the sky is actually a rock. Doesn't make it so.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald do you understand the difference between what "analysts" with no inside information say and, oh I don't know, facts?
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald again, you are citing speculation. Not facts. Are you aware that the FBI didn't even claim anything about "printer dots" in their affidavit?
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald you seem to be outsourcing your views on this case to him or else you would focus on the fact that they lied in affidavits to justify keeping Reality Winner in prison. Instead you troll Glenn based on flagrant misinformation.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald Shouldn't you be asking the FBI that question? Shouldn't they be required to prove their case, including methods used? Nothing you have said indicates you have any information not taken directly from the FBI affidavit and Sessions DoJ. Great sources!
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald I am going to type this slowly because you seem to be struggling with basic facts about how trials work: The. Burden. Of. Proof. Is. On. The. Government. We. Don't. Comment. Out. Of. Respect. For. Her. Defense.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald do you know how this works? FBI makes assertions. Then you have indictments. Then you have a plea. Then the onus is on the state to prove the charges. You seem to think FBI affidavits=verdict.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald Proved my point. You are swallowing wholesale the Session Doj/FBI assertions, which is where your narrative derives from 100%.
@samo102us @MoreSocialism @deCespedes @ggreenwald show me a source that documents "how... she [got] caught" that are proven facts and do not rely on the FBI affidavits from Sessions DOJ. Do you understand that she pled not guilty? Also, you came with ignorance--not knowing that we are working on her defense-- and it continues.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald again, you are relying on the FBI's characterization of events. And even the US attorney has had to retract some of those assertions in court.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald where are you getting the "information" on which you based your assertions about this case? Answer: FBI and/or reporting about what the FBI alleges.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald Are you aware that the US Attorney had to retract--in front of the judge-- false assertions made by the FBI in the affidavit? I'm guessing not. But Glenn is BAD is all the evidence you need.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald No. Your characterization was false and is clearly based on the FBI's claims, as is the case with pretty much all of the people commenting on this case. This hatred of Glenn drives people to do insane things, like believe Sessions DOJ should be believed.
@samo102us @deCespedes @ggreenwald 1. Our company is helping finance her defense and is deeply involved with her support and 2. I'm sorry that it bothers you that her legal team doesn't want us to comment on the case and that you believe that an FBI affidavit from Sessions's DOJ is 100% true.

@teIIiott @Aaron4Science @ggreenwald @ryangrim I do think that there is an eagerness to believe anything flung at Trump (in part because he is so cartoonishly and completely villainous) which has lead to some pretty serious errors at CNN and other outlets. Ultimately it hurts all journalism because Trump uses it as a weapon.
@teIIiott @Aaron4Science @ggreenwald @ryangrim I also think there are different types of errors that warrant different types of responses. This was a serious error because it changed the meaning of the story. We had an obligation to own it and to do so prominently and full throated. Also to make clear it wasn’t the reporter.
@teIIiott @Aaron4Science @ggreenwald @ryangrim the issue in several cases has been that the errors are not corrected prominently, but rather treated as mere updates. Or they are corrected with no note to the reader that they have been corrected.

@TheBigFoxx you are sick for saying that. Truly.

@Whtapl @La_filocalista does engaging in this kind of dishonest, bad faith smear make you happy? Give you satisfaction?
@Whtapl @La_filocalista You are a liar. You said I support AQ. That's a lie.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista Were Republicans in Ireland members of the GOP? Do you not see how silly this is? Words have a variety of meanings. You can easily find what I think about AQ in Syria, yet you obsess over a word and ignore that you are incorrectly ascribing a definition I have said I am not using
@Whtapl @La_filocalista Ok, man. This has run its course. You're obsessed w a word &amp; ignoring all of the context of my many interviews over the course of years, where I have made clear what I think of the CIA, DoD, AQ, etc etc etc roles in Syria. Here is one from *5 years* ago: https://t.co/l2FpCMi91P
@Whtapl @La_filocalista According to the dictionary, all groups opposing, by force, the existing government/military are resistance against said government. You are ascribing a value to the word that I am not. Perhaps protest the dictionary?
@Whtapl @La_filocalista You are so hung up on a word that I *accurately* used. And you are trying to say that I used it as some way of praising AQ. That's false. You don't seem to grasp that the word has multiple meanings and you are insisting I meant it how you believe I did. I didn't, but carry on.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista You did say that and it is false.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista They are armed and they are violently trying to overthrow the government of Syria. I'm sorry you have issues with dictionaries and the variety of meanings many words have.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista yes, and if I ever say anyone ever made anything "great again," I am supporting Trump. Genius!
@Whtapl @La_filocalista My argument is that you are a liar who does not understand the accurate definition of the word "resistance" that I used.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista "Your support for al Qaeda" is what you said. I have given them zero support. You lied.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista This is boring and tedious. You need to get a hobby.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista you said I support AQ. I don't care aout your "insofar." You lied about my positions and it is sick.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista In that context, I meant the forces trying to overthrow the Syrian government/fighting the Syrian Army. And I accurately stated that there are elements that include AQ within that group. Resistance (noun): armed or violent opposition.
@Whtapl @La_filocalista This is so incredibly dumb. I have never spoken of AQ's role in Syria as anything other than derisively and accurately. The fact that you are obsessing over the word "resistance" is evidence that you have no actual facts to point to to support your lie that I support AQ.

@dancohen3000 @nataliesurely @mehdirhasan Yes, it’s called principle. I won’t cheerlead Russia or Assad or the US.
@dancohen3000 @mehdirhasan You’re such an embarrassing propagandist. I’ve been opposed to US regime change from the start and you can’t find a single comment I’ve ever made to the contrary.
@dancohen3000 You take a few seconds out of context and then manage to inaccurately characterize what even your cherry-picked few seconds say.
@AlexNGordon It’s about this position at this time. This is Bolton’s one big shot, maybe ever. Kissinger is an elite and would consult with the ruling class, including HRC before doing something insane. Bolton will just push for the worst immediately. Also Kissinger sleeps 20 hrs a day now.

Someone emailed us about our reporting on Stingrays. He said he thinks his girlfriend is cheating on him &amp; wants to spy on her, but Stingrays are too expensive and could we recommend something else he could use? Reminds me of people who email me asking how to work for Blackwater.
@ThomasAMartin2 Nah. He’ll get clearance.
@thefarmerjones No. The point is that the admin has chosen to put him in this position knowing the inevitable outcome.
Putting John Bolton in this position is like allowing a toddler to drive on the expressway. And the car has a dirty bomb in it.

@alphex @intercepted It’s a bit more complicated than that. Closer to saying the US had no position on it.
@LucyStag Well, you asked about this specific position. There are some roles where I think Cheney would be more dangerous. Like if he was CIA director.
@LucyStag Yes. This is Bolton’s one big shot and that pushes him over the edge.
Bolton may be the absolute worst citizen of the United States of America to have in a position like this. And I say that knowing Dick Cheney is still alive.
@Dreaddcp I’ve been talking about Bolton getting this job for weeks. And all of the horrors it will bring. Mustache analysis is just for Twitter.
@chrisargyris The plot thickens!
@Jazzahol Honestly, I think he is.
I’m serious. That may be the absolute only way to get the guy out. There are people in this country very bothered by mustaches. Trump is one of them. We should just bombard Trump with various pics of Bolton’s mustache.
We are probably literally one mustache away from some war. We should pray that it bothers Trump so much that Bolton is out within months.
I bet like 50-75% of the Trump-Bolton Meeting tonight was about the mustache.
@JSCCounterPunch and Mattis.
First time Trump sees milk on Bolton’s mustache, he’s fucking toast.
Trump should troll MSNBC hard and give Bill Kristol a spot in the admin. Maybe a side dish of Frum.
As I’ve said before, John Bolton’s only path to this administration was a non-Senate-confirmed position. That’s NSA. His confirmation hearing would have been a big blood-thirsty, neocon festival. Mr. Bolton, let’s make this easy. Which country don’t you want the US to bomb?

@eean No doubt. I agree with the point about US policy. Some of this stuff, though, seems to involve personal agendas and motivations.
@chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump Yeah. The 8-1 SCOTUS ruling when Clinton tried to stop or delay his deposition/trial is a big problem for Trump.
Would be pretty surreal if Gloria Allred deposed @realDonaldTrump.
@mkearley2008 On a policy level, I largely agree with you. I’m more referring to individual acts.
@eean I’m referring to things like the president’s son in law who can’t get a clearance taking material from the PDB and giving it to a crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Or Flynn trying to get Russia to change its position at UNSC on Israel while Obama was still president.
@eveewing I also loved @eveewing’s story about the cereal box magic decoder ring for white women who want to decode what black women are saying.

@SarahSheris Young people in the streets today for one!
@CAugustElliott Anyway, thanks for the good faith discussion.
@CAugustElliott I find that Twitter makes it seem like every debate is binary and nasty. It really is an awful platform to discuss anything of substance or complexity.
@Gamoyda I don’t know what would have happened if they had engaged in talks. Neither do you. I was stating facts, not predicting the outcome. I do find it suspicious that you wouldn’t even try to negotiate before sending thousands of Americans to their deaths in a pointless war.
@CAugustElliott On that we agree.
@CAugustElliott I didn’t mean it as an insult, just that I don’t think it is as binding as you indicated. In any case, I agree this was no simple matter. But it is kind of amazing how few people are even aware of this part of the story. Cheers.
@CAugustElliott But also, victims of crimes don’t determine the response of democratic states to terrorism and crime. Just as they don’t in criminal prosecutions in the US. And rightly so.
@CAugustElliott And for some of them, justice would have been doing anything possible to capture OBL. Others wanted immediate revenge/justice through war. Not so simple.
@CAugustElliott You are engaging in a sweeping generalization about “Pashtun culture.” There were Taliban officials ready to put quite a bit on the table to avoid war.
@CAugustElliott Not exactly sure what your point is. But the fact is that the US immediately refused any negotiation. And be careful pretending to speak for all 9/11 families. I know many who were against that war. You seem to believe they were a monolith.
@Gamoyda The US refused to talk at all and began an invasion and bombing almost immediately. There was no negotiation. Only an ultimatum.
@bzules *waste. And, no, I’m not. I’ve interviewed many primary players in this and have investigated this for years. Have you?
@CAugustElliott You don’t start a negotiation with an agreement. Oh, Kim Jung Un won’t immediately give up his nukes? Let’s go to war right now. Seriously?
@Gamoyda There’s been a lot of shit attributed to Mullah Omar that contradicts the other shit attributed to Mullah Omar.
@Gamoyda Wow. You were with Mullah Omar and privy to his inner thoughts? Amazing!
@xicanism @democracynow @theintercept @pierre Got any citation for me apologizing for US imperialism?
@InsiderSubo Ok. I see you know a grand total of zero about international negotiations or diplomacy. Sorry I responded!
@CAugustElliott Actually, their offer was to hand him over to a *Muslim* country of the US’s choosing so he could be tried in a Shariah court.
@InsiderSubo Have you ever studied a complex *negotiation*? You don’t come to the table with an agreement that everyone wants. You NEGOTIATE. That was the opening offer.
@CAugustElliott And he was an ambassador catering to PR messaging and often totally out of contact w government in Afghanistan at that time. The foreign minister and others who were more senior were desperately trying to negotiate with the US. And the US refused.
@Gamoyda Actually, the position was they wanted him tried in a Shariah court.
@CAugustElliott Back that up. It was definitely in the Taliban government’s interest to avoid the toppling of its regime. The US may not have wanted to negotiate but it doesn’t mean they were insincere.
People asking for the source on this: just use basic google. I interviewed the Taliban foreign minister who made the offer myself. And many outlets reported on this: https://t.co/DGHoZRct4A
Taliban wanted to negotiate right after 9/11, including offer to hand over bin Laden to a Muslim ally of the US for trial. So the point of this war has been...? https://t.co/sPOrq0razG

@CalicoSean @ggreenwald It says foreigners tortured. The CIA torture is described as “rough interrogation”
@Dmorrison1979 Well, US law does. And it does matter.
@sensen2011 Dudebro, that says foreigners tortured and CIA just did  “rough interrogation.” Dumb ass.
@ijspurcell @charliearchy It says foreigners tortured and the CIA just did “rough interrogation.” Are you guys really staking a flag on this hill?
@Dmorrison1979 It says they were tortured *by foreigners*. They were tortured *by the CIA* too. But that’s described as “rough interrogation” instead of torture. That’s the point. Foreigners torture, the CIA “rough interrogates,” which is itself a sick term for torture.
@charliearchy they've also had a whole host of people on who have described it as a difficult mission Haspel was on and that she did it with integrity blah blah. Anyway, the point was more about the coining of the term "rough interrogations" as a stand-in for torture.
@Dmorrison1979 it says that bad mean foreigners did the torture, not the noble CIA. They did "rough interrogations."

@SeanErnst @JohnBrennan Obama could have proceeded with prosecutions and other methods of accountability. He did absolutely none of that. This isn't just about a confirmation hearing. It's about letting the torturers off the hook and then putting an apologist for torture in as head of CIA.
@SeanErnst @JohnBrennan Yes, he said: "We tortured some folks" and then refused to hold any of them accountable. Do you honestly believe a single person was like, "OMG, we tortured people!!! Obama revealed it!!!" lol
@dnalezn @JohnBrennan If the issue is that people are just discovering this, I am truly glad to see it. Thanks for writing!
@SeanErnst @JohnBrennan also, LOL that the Obama admin "exposed" it. Seriously? It was journalists and human rights groups that exposed it. And Obama's DoJ did everything possible to stop litigation against torturers.
@SeanErnst @JohnBrennan point me to the CIA torturers held accountable.
@dogdadbod Or, you know, just stating facts. I'm sorry they are not consistent with your dogmatic partisanship.
@gogohy3 @robot_granola @keithchaput @AliVelshi @MalcolmNance @nedprice @ggreenwald I believe that there is a cult, of which you are a member, who spend all day live-tweeting the voices in their heads.
@dnalezn @JohnBrennan if it was not accompanied by a worship of all things Obama, including heinous things that GOP would be rightly condemned for doing, I would agree.
@gogohy3 @robot_granola @keithchaput @AliVelshi @MalcolmNance @nedprice @ggreenwald I've used it when it is clear that is what's happening. You guys all have these common voices running through your head. Perhaps a group therapy session is in order?
@gogohy3 @robot_granola @keithchaput @AliVelshi @MalcolmNance @nedprice @ggreenwald can you untag me from your livestream of the voices in your head?
The irony, of course, is that all of these partisan dingbats said jack shit about @JohnBrennan's support for torture, but now--for partisan reasons alone--care about a pro-torture person being at the helm of CIA. Was wrong w Brennan and is wrong w Haspel.
@panbacchus @ggreenwald @theintercept it's a response to ignorant partisan trolls alleging that @theintercept, me and @ggreenwald somehow support Haspel, when in fact we broke the story over a year ago identifying her.
@robot_granola @keithchaput @AliVelshi @MalcolmNance @nedprice @ggreenwald Um, you do know that @ggreenwald was the journalist who actually identified Gina Haspel, right? https://t.co/AmvQ771csO
@MICHAELANGELOvp @IrisRimon @ggreenwald @theintercept @intercepted Cole was saying that Pompeo was going to be out at CIA. Later we talked about him heading to State.
@MICHAELANGELOvp @IrisRimon @ggreenwald @theintercept @intercepted yes. That was @matthewacole on @intercepted a few months ago.

@drewcaps1 Ah. Ok. So you’re just a basic self-admitted ignoramus who runs their mouth off without knowing what they’re talking about.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 I think that’s quite an inaccurate statement regarding my positions, which I have shared weekly on a podcast for the past year.
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook I don't know why the Russian voices are in your head. That's why I was suggesting you get help.
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook Hey, keep your passion! Remember, as soon as the Russian voices in your head stop, find people you trust to be with.
@drewcaps1 show me one tiny iota of documentation that I did anything other than report critically on Bill Clinton, including from his wars. I bet you don't know jack shit about me and just popped on here because you got lost.
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook when the voices in your head stop, try to get to a safe spot where people you trust can hug you.
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook here is your question: WHY DIDN'T YOU REPORT A STORY THAT YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF BEFORE ANOTHER PUBLICATION BROKE THE STORY AND THEN YOU FOLLOWED UP AND ANALYZED IT???? Because Russia! Maybe delete your account. It seems to be impacting your sanity. In a serious way.
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook haha. Man, you are really trying and failing. I repeat: do you understand how journalism works? The Washington Post broke a story. We got a Congressperson on record calling for an investigation into it all. That moved the story forward. Maybe it is time to take the bench, kid.

@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook Here, let me dunk on you again: https://t.co/f8W6HbkTMR
@midrangejumpsho @rjmadrid @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook Ah, yes. Genius! Do you use the same fact checkers as FOX News? https://t.co/JDScUF7QbW
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps Yes, we have totally ignored the Prince/Seychelles/Russia story. You are really a lost, sad soul: https://t.co/JDScUF7QbW
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 Oh, I hope if Mueller has evidence EP committed crimes that he throws the book at him. I also want justice for the civilians killed by his forces in multiple countries. I seriously am puzzled as to what your point is.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 What exactly are you objecting to? That I think the investigation into EP should be *expanded*? That I care about an injustice I have worked on for more than a decade? That I am angry that people in a position to do something didn't? What is your point?
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 your analogy doesn't work. The point is that there was no justice for Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman, even when OJ went to jail for the minor shit. He got out. And they are left with the memories of their loved ones and haunted by zero justice being done.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 OK, let's hear your story. Because I think about mine every day and am not going to stop fighting for them to get justice for the killing of their loved ones.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 That question is probably best answered by Mohammed Kinani. His 9 year old son's brain exploded in the car next to him after Prince's men shot him in the head.
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps OK, you got me. Here are my sources: https://t.co/CP1cGPYWWx
@7fdnMdc It is "you're" and since you are such a secret squirrel I'm sure the answer must be at your fingertips. I know the answer.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 It's easy to be flip when you know a total of zero of the victims' families. You think the Goldmans were happy that OJ didn't get convicted in the murder of their son? Nicole Brown's family? Do you hear yourself? OJ is free. That's the standard you hold for justice?
@7fdnMdc point me to the last contract EP got with the US government. Not former companies. EP's.
@LiberalMolly Please convert the size to the local, Russian chart and I will do my best.
@iamstillben waiting for tea to boil, actually.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 As I said the other day in that thread, I am glad that a lot of people are focusing on EP. And I am not shaming ordinary people. But the politicians and pundits deserve to be held to task. Justice has still not been done and the victims deserve it.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 I will absolutely dismiss all the pundits and politicians who are only focusing on this for partisan reasons and could not be bothered, and still cannot, to do jack shit when he was running a murderous operation against Muslims.
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps keep your day job as a sad, paranoid, delusional guy. You're better at it.
@7fdnMdc OK, big insider, let's try this. You ask the men who risked their lives by filing those papers about Prince. Let me know how that goes.
I actually feel bad for people who have been driven to this level of delusion. Please keep them in your prayers. https://t.co/1Q5qhLuBXS
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps I love your passion. I hope you are able to get the Russian voices in your head to stop torturing you.
@7fdnMdc hmm. I don't recall Erik suing them for defamation. Those are serious allegations and he knows the identities of the men who made them. But I am sure you know best.
@World_W_No_End @mlake9 No. I think they should expand the investigation to include his ties to Chinese intel and CITIC bank, killings in Iraq, money laundering allegations and on and on. Pretty dumb to limit it when there is ample evidence of widespread activity that should interest prosecutors.
@midrangejumpsho @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook no, the issue is that you have serious basic comprehension issues and don't know anything about competitive journalism and see Soviet tanks in your dreams. The voices in your head aren't real. Lavrov is not speaking to you.
@Gunntom5Gunn @mlake9 He has been back in the US for some years now. He was in UAE waiting out the end of Obama.
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps I broke the story Prince was advising Trump. I broke the story Prince was working with ex-CIA to offer Trump private spy services. I have analyzed the Seychelles story multiple times. And we continue to report. And your theory is I am somehow covering up for Russia? hahaha.
@midrangejumpsho @Singularitybook @DamianPhipps my god, you are dumb. The Post got a scoop. It happens. Other reporters scoop me. I scoop them. Do you realize how truly nuts you sound?
@midrangejumpsho @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook ok, now I see that the issue more clearly: you are an Alex Jones-level idiot who knows nothing about journalism and believes the Bolsheviks are coming for you.
@Singularitybook @midrangejumpsho @DamianPhipps No, he's saying that because the Washington Post broke a story and not me, it means I am a KGB asset. Or something.
@midrangejumpsho @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook you changed, homie. Not me.
@mlake9 A. What positive outcome? B. He needs to be held accountable for the slaughter of civilians his forces carried out. C. He is not likely going to jail for any Russia stuff. D. If he gets charged with anything he will likely beat it or get zero jail.
@midrangejumpsho @DamianPhipps @Singularitybook yes, it is all a conspiracy and I am a shill for Erik Prince because USSR or something. Are your fillings broadcasting messages to your head again?
@JaneMoneypenny @Singularitybook No. I was just answering your question. And he’s hardly a has been. He owns a security company with the Chinese government.
@JaneMoneypenny @Singularitybook I know more than I care to about all of the company’s iterations, Xe, USTC, Academi, Greystone and on and on and on. Also FSG and Prince’s other current companies.
@JaneMoneypenny @Singularitybook Just what I said. He owns the “Blackwater” brand and licenses products with it, including a range of merchandise.

@1RocnRic @tmorello also, champ, @tmorello regularly raised awareness of these issues on his pretty considerable platforms.
@1RocnRic @tmorello I wrote a 700 page book about Obama’s wars. Reported from Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia etc. also made a film about it. Testified to Congress about assassinations. But I’m sure you did more.
@ExiledHeroine I have no issues with consensual pee tapings.
@propornot @akobilarov How about identifying yourself and owning your statements?
@ExiledHeroine Back in the old days, no one over 50 ever made a pee tape. We’ve come a long way.
@BrandyLJensen My dad doesn’t have FB but he sometimes goes on my mom’s and posts notes he signs with his full name. (Note: he doesn’t call sex “play,” so I assume he’s safe).

@TreiberS He was a major figure in pushing the slaughter in Iraq and the lies it was based on. This ain’t some “oops, I said something dumb and I’m sorry.”
@slavior33 Who did Obama threaten to kill on US soil? Outside of federal death penalty and armed confrontations? Also, Trump is doing many of those things, some at a much greater pace than Obama.

@TrickFreee And they awarded NEW contracts despite knowing exactly what Blackwater had done. What’s your point?
@TrickFreee @HillaryClinton I’m well aware of the facts. The Iraqi government took away BW’s license to operate so State had to cancel it. Also, they were awarded new contracts while she was SoS. And State was in charge of DDTC/ITAR licensing. I’m sorry that disrupts your narrative.

@midrangejumpsho @DoremusJ If only there was a way for you to check this yourself.
I can totally see Trump going the Dennis Rodman route in North Korea.
@DoremusJ Lol. I was joking about you saying I was in a quandary because I’m a Russia skeptic. I have a pretty complex analysis of all of this and have shared it weekly for a year.
@rankingjohng Honestly, I was more thinking of cable pundits and politicians not my twitter followers!
@DoremusJ I have done segments on this. Not hard to find.
@DoremusJ I broke the story Erik Prince was advising Trump &amp; done several in-depth stories about his relationship with Trump &amp; Pence. I’ve also done multiple segments, including on Seychelles/UAE. I’m sorry I’m not screaming about the USSR every day. Sorry to inconvenience your narrative.
@michaeldemoore @FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 True, though the Blackwater guys killed in Fallujah in 2004 were working on a KBR security deal.
@khuxford @theintercept I also find that twitter makes us all so much meaner than we actually are. @ggreenwald is a perfect example. The guy is a totally compassionate, nice, generous person.
@khuxford @fernramirez93 @theintercept At the time, there was really good debate on Twitter sparked by that very part of his remarks. And that’s part of why I wanted to do this show in the first place.
@msglattfelder @khuxford @theintercept @UWMadison That’s hilarious.
@michaeldemoore @FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 Oh, BW was actually really bad. Atrocious. And when your customer is unsavory, they love when you get their work done. You are right that the hiring agencies also bear major responsibility.
@fernramirez93 @khuxford @theintercept Yes. I didn’t agree with some of what he was saying, but I understood his factual point. And he has spent a lot of time with victims of Empire and helped expose their torturers.
@FactsMatterHere @michaeldemoore @KDanimalia @dweide9 No. I’m saying they didn’t need to continue some of the programs. As in, they should have declared there was no need for them. In one case, Panetta did that. But there were more that should have been ended swiftly.
@khuxford @msglattfelder @theintercept @UWMadison That is exactly how he is. I just sat with him and a bunch of students this week. If you make your case, he shows a lot of respect.
@fernramirez93 @khuxford @theintercept He just published an entire book on his analysis of the major decline of US Empire within decades.
@khuxford @theintercept Nooo. I didn’t take it that way at all! Man, Twitter is atrocious for conveying tone. Just horrid.
@FactsMatterHere @michaeldemoore @KDanimalia @dweide9 I disagree with one thing there: I think they should have canceled some of the *programs* I knew of involving BW. Obama and HRC weren’t handcuffed. And I don’t make equivalencies. I point out facts, as I understand them, regardless of party.
@khuxford @theintercept Yeah, I hear you. I was just pointing out that context. And given that context, I always find his analysis interesting even if I disagree. He knows a ton about how we got to where we are.
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 Mercers and Bannon brought EP to Trump. And EP close to Mike Pence.
@michaeldemoore @FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 I also largely agree with that. But there was also a factor of some of the black work they were doing for CIA and JSOC. It would have been almost impossible to replace those operatives without disrupting them. That was part of the argument to Obama, HRC &amp; Panetta.
@khuxford @theintercept Also, I don’t agree with some of his views and conclusions, but he has earned his chops.
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 You actually believe that? You think he had no influence? That’s just not correct. Also, you forgot the USTC iteration.
@FactsMatterHere @dweide9 I largely agree with that. Obama knew exactly who they were based on his Senate efforts. Clinton said she would ban them in response to my questions to her campaign. That makes it more disturbing that they got contracts. Also, the “new” Blackwater had its share of very bad people
@khuxford @theintercept He was almost killed by CIA mercenaries, wrote the classic book on heroin trafficking and wrote one of the defining books about US torture programs. His positions are not as simple as you indicate. Look him up. Alfred McCoy.
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 Wrong. He still owned Xe at the time several contracts were awarded. See also: Panetta justifying CIA contracts even though Prince was still at the helm. You act like Obama and Clinton were just sort of forced into it and had no agency. That’s hilariously false.
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9  https://t.co/hW00bznZy6
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 You are shifting the goalposts. What's next? Does he have to have been at Obama's wedding? Obama could have canceled the contracts. In Senate, he sponsored legislation to try to regulate them. Yet, the CIA awarded it NEW contracts (under Xe) in the summer of 2010.
@FactsMatterHere @KDanimalia @dweide9 He politically hated Obama. No doubt. But he still worked for his government.
@CayIsBlue You do realize I am quoted and cited in that article, right?
Gotta run. Thanks for reading and for (most of your) comments.
@FactsMatterHere @TSullivan41 @chrislhayes Lol. Ok
@cmoorepdx @StepJumper @theintercept You are reading into it incorrectly. Not sure what to say except that. When I did address people on Twitter, I said so specifically.
@sportjames23 Yes he was. Do some research.
@StepJumper @theintercept Why do you assume I am talking about twitter or my followers?. I’m more talking about cable news pundits and politicians.
@MadaVentoux @VinkayemKaren @doubtthat11 And the notion there weren’t other firms/forces available is so laughable.
@MadaVentoux @VinkayemKaren @doubtthat11 You are incredibly wrong. In fact, I often made these exact points, including in congressional testimony. But don’t let facts get in the way of your narrative!
I was in high school at the time. https://t.co/FmeMnTYQz8
@DeaditeCheryl @theintercept No. Part of my “focus” remains on justice for the families of murdered civilians. They deserve justice. And I won’t pretend it didn’t happen.
@FactsMatterHere @TSullivan41 @chrislhayes That’s not true. They kept winning contracts at CIA and DOD. They also used other contracting vehicles when BW became toxic.
@rankingjohng Maybe you do. But the families of people killed by his forces still have no justice. I won’t move on. No one should.
As for some of the #Resistance people jumping on here to attack @theintercept, we have broken some of the most substantial stories about Erik Prince and Trump. But that’s inconvenient to your narrative.
It’s interesting to note who is pushing the line that we should move on from the past and just focus on recent Erik Prince activities. I assure you the families of civilians slaughtered by his forces have not. But they are foreign Muslims, so justice for them doesn’t matter.
@WellingtonRandy Tell that to the families of Iraqis and Afghans massacred by his forces. Overwhelming majority of them have received zero justice and likely never will. Ask @prdickinson.

@MadaVentoux Lol. Ok champ.
Also, credit where due regarding cable news: @KeithOlbermann @maddow and @chrislhayes covered Erik Prince and Blackwater extensively years ago.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad people are learning about Erik Prince. But he should have been shut down a long time ago. I’ve spent 13 years trying to bring his horrid activities to light. It never should have gotten this far.
If Erik Prince had been held accountable when the Democrats controlled Congress or when Obama was president, we wouldn’t be talking about what he’s doing with Trump or with Russians in the Seychelles.
@GDGriffin @chrislhayes @maddow @Lawrence @HardballChris @NewDay @ChrisCuomo @danspapers @SouthamptonPres Actually, both @maddow and @chrislhayes covered this story and had me on multiple times.
@romannose52 Truth is an absolute defense. He can try to sue me. He will lose.
@new_cartography You’re missing the point entirely.
@Ali_Husain333 @MazMHussain You might be the dumbest person who jumps on my timeline.
@Brooklyn__Mets There was an abundance. Do some research.
The one Congressperson who really tried to shut Erik Prince down was @janschakowsky. She’s been all over him for over a decade. No one listened. Including her own party leadership.
You think Erik and Russia is the issue? He is running a “security” business with the Chinese government right now.
Also, Erik Prince is holding a fundraiser for “pro-Russia” Dana Rohrabacher? *Clutches pearls*		Prince worked for Rohrabacher. They are close friends for decades.
Where were all these people now calling for Erik Prince’s arrest when he was running a privatized murder machine in Iraq and Afghanistan? He was still getting contracts under OBAMA. HIllary Clinton was Secretary if State and was technically in charge.
@SusanLouise1977 @starrfish220 @SethAbramson He lives in the US. Hasn’t lived in UAE for years.

Alright. Peace, people. Going back to the real world.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 I meet all sorts of people in real life that I engage with on twitter. I usually spend quite a bit of time chatting with people before or after events I do. Would be happy to talk with you!
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Also, Twitter is awful for these discussions. Just toxic and forces people into narrow categories. Would be happy to discuss in person if we ever run into one another!
@briebriejoy Yeah, I agree with that. I also think that putting the second amendment into a historical context is very important. The amendment was passed at the same convention as 3/5 personhood.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Why shouldn’t I be able to own a rocket propelled grendade launcher? That’s an inanimate object. Grenade launchers don’t kill people. People do!
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Should an individual person be able to stockpile 30 guns? 50? 100?
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Let’s make it more difficult to mass murder people.
@aaronjmate What’s extra funny is that this is a joke my little niece makes every Halloween. Clever guy, that one.
@briebriejoy There are many nuggets to pull from various cases, but relying entirely on case law and rulings is problematic in my view. It is also a moral issue.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Look at how many mass murderers *legally* purchased their guns.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Show me where I did that.
@clekstro @tylerjness It is upholding an institution that facilitates the mass murder of children on a regular basis.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Yes, I do believe that less guns and more regulation will reduce death by gun.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN I can just imagine you looking at the sky and saying, I feel like the sky is actually a car so it must be a car and not the sky because I feel it.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 I’m responding with facts to your comparison of food and guns.
@The_Puck @DLoesch I’m talking about airing the speeches at CPAC. What’s next? The KKK convention?
I know it’s causing the mass murder of children, concert goers, church goers, and many other innocents on a regular basis through the use of legally purchased firearms. https://t.co/jDi0qPpQyk
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Lol. Just try to research a little before  coming at me next time. Remember, feelings are not facts. Repeat that a few times to yourself.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 No, actually. Deregulation leads to many more deaths in many areas. It is precisely the issue.
@truthbetold1024 That isn’t a militia and the guns he used were purchased and held by the shooter in his individual capacity.
@PrimitiveOrgan1 Well, Trump and many in the GOP want to do away with all sorts of regulations, including food safety. I’m against that, yes.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Lol. Again, there’s a major difference between your feelings and, you know, facts. Perhaps you should think and do some research before running your mouth off and making a fool of yourself.
Which “well regulated militia” was stockpiling the Vegas shooter’s mass murder weapons? https://t.co/SE3qlWdAYY
@briebriejoy I certainly don’t think narrowly in terms of second amendment on this issue. Was just responding to someone who does. All sorts of bad laws have been changed and I hope the laws and precedent on mass murder weapons eventually are too.
@clekstro @tylerjness There have been many cases upholding slavery, women being treated as lesser humans and on and on. Doesn’t make it right. I hope one day we also do away with these rulings too.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Show me where "The Intercept" said that.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN also, show me those examples you promised about things they said that have been *proven* false. It doesn't seem that you understand the basic difference between facts and your personal feelings.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN show me where I did that. I have objected only to people claiming she has not provided answers, which she has. You really have zero examples to cite of anything I have actually said. You rely only on your imaginations and what you *feel* I said.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN care to cite an example of something *proven* to be false? Also, asking Stein about who paid for her trip, who she talked to, etc. was of news value and got her on the record on these issues.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Show me where I called it anything of the sort. Also, do you see how that story was wrong because of the significance of the date? I'm sorry you don't believe in evidence/facts and think we should all just spend our time bowing to Bill Kristol, David Frum and Rachel Maddow.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN Show me an example of me "defending Russia."
@CB_Demented I am not talking about the uniformed military in an authorized combat activity.
@tylerjness the first clause is dependent.
@bigseb31213 Yes, @ggreenwald is my co-worker and friend. And if you bothered to do a second of research you would find we very much disagree on this issue. But that is not as fun as spouting off.
@CB_Demented We've had heinous Supreme Court/other court decisions throughout history on all sorts of issues. Many of them were ultimately reversed or otherwise changed. I hope that sanity prevails and these meet the same fate.
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews @CNN you are debating yourself and yourself alone.
@flibberdegibbet Actually, I have read the various arguments regarding guns and I find the Scalia majority decisions in particular to be extremely problematic and flawed, as did Justice Kennedy. I hope these are re-examined someday with a less rabid majority.
@bigseb31213 Who is my boss?
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews I have never interviewed Tucker Carlson. I have never invited him anywhere. I have made clear my views on him and on FOX repeatedly. If you have something to say to Glenn, he is right here: @ggreenwald
@Dudeoflifepoker @Qamrah808 @FoxNews Seriously?
@manniefaces I think it is perfectly acceptable to debate these issues and to understand the perspective of those who want to have guns, but airing free ads for the NRA is just wrong.
The founding fathers did not bestow upon us the right to stockpile AR-15s. Also, please point me to the "well-regulated militia" that the Florida school shooter belonged to. https://t.co/MDSSKFbMUi

@Qamrah808 ok. If you are content with uninterrupted broadcasts of NRA propaganda being aired simultaneously by all major networks at the expense of covering other issues &amp; it's fine because you can just turn off the TV, that's your choice. I think it is shameful.
@mitsein I am talking about the NRA speeches which the networks broadcast live and uninterrupted from CPAC, not the Town Hall.
@mitsein how does living in an "open democratic society" necessitate broadcasting unfiltered propaganda? Should news outlets be required to broadcast KKK rallies live? Neo-Nazi conventions?
@DonaldDee0 Let's try an experiment: should CNN be required to air a KKK rally? If they don't is it censorship? Have you ever read the 1st amendment?
@Hillarys_Nurse @JordanChariton wrong. There is no right to have access to any television network and no right to have your propaganda broadcast. The 1st amendment is literally only about the government limiting speech. That's it. Read it.
There is no justification whatsoever for providing hours of free airtime to an organization that advocates for easy access to weapons of mass murder. It's sick. It's shameful.
All of these networks, claiming to be horrified by these mass shootings, giving massive free airtime to the NRA's unfiltered propaganda should hang their heads in shame. This is a significant part of the problem.

@blankslate2017 Ok. Just let me know when you stop offering support to white supremacists.
@stellaaaa @vorodecky No! I’m a monster who just loves Trump and Putin.
@denisethewriter @ggreenwald @JoyAnnReid I cited her because she is a very prominent voice on the Russia/Trump story and is clearly not a shill for Putin, yet she was retweeted hundreds of times by these bots. I’m saying we should all be careful in tossing around accusations based on this.
@blankslate2017 When will you admit you are a Now-Nazi?
@Mr_JSheffield @armchairsupes Have you seen the threats and harassment this woman is now receiving as a result of CNN broadcasting her image? I have no problem w investigating this. I do question this tactic though.
@denisethewriter @ggreenwald @JoyAnnReid I’m not accusing Joy of anything. My point is that we are losing our minds by accusing people who interacted with or were promoted by alleged Russian bots (as Joy was hundreds of times) of being Russia collaborators. Clearly Joy isn’t that.
@KayKay72526533 I find the attacks on these students and digging into their lives utterly vile.
@the_moviebob My point is that Joy was retweeted hundreds of times by the alleged Russian bots. That doesn’t make her a Putin shill. Why were the bots so into Joy’s message? We are losing our minds with this stuff.
@wildstorm357 @vorodecky Check your facts, son. https://t.co/gNjMx2d54z
@LarryNocella @WamsuttaLives Nah. My views evolve too based on new information and debates/discussions.
@ThePigGorilla the nerve you struck is the one that controls my reaction to foolishness.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis I think this is a totally legit thing to investigate, including talking to people who may have been caught up in it. My objection was just to the way they did it, not that they are doing the story.
@ThePigGorilla lol. What a genius! Pointing out your problem with one thing must mean you are not against others! Weird how my tweet bothers you more than other stuff.
@StevenBlakeLI I was on national TV, giving speeches across the country attacking Trump before and after his election, denouncing his fascist ideas. I did more to oppose Trump than you will ever do in your entire life.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis My point is that I think CNN could have done that story without showing that woman's face and name everywhere. I find her views repulsive, but I also do not believe she should be threatened with violence, which is now happening as a result.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis show me where I have ever "sent a kiss" to a racist. Because I can point you to a whole lot of the opposite of that.
@DanteMcNiel ha. I pop in sporadically. I also believe in interacting with people, which I think too few people in media do.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis yes.
If you are ever concerned that you’re starting to have too much faith in humanity, just hop onto Twitter. It’ll fix that for you. Fast.
@LarryNocella @WamsuttaLives No idea what she agreed to. But generally when people start talking to a camera, the journalist is on stable ground legally. Though it doesn't make it right and most people have no idea what the "rules" are.
Are the people cheering on CNN for doorstepping the Trump supporter on her lawn aggressively calling on Joy Ann Reid to tell us what she knew and when she knew it about how she was "unwittingly" used by Russian bots?
@vorodecky take a look at the threats and vicious attacks on that woman that occurred as a result of that CNN segment.
@AlanBBayer @BenjaminPDixon Yes.
@armchairsupes I agree. I am not saying that this story shouldn't be pursued. It should. But journalists have an obligation to consider the ramifications of these kinds of stories for ordinary people.
@ggreenwald @narboink @BenjaminPDixon Also, that woman is now receiving a deluge of vicious, nasty attacks and threats on her Facebook page. CNN could have talked to her without broadcasting her image and name everywhere. It was stunt journalism that resulted in her being harassed mercilessly.
@FaresInSA @ChiTrendchase are you joking? You don't see how CNN broadcasting her name and face all over the world would cause this and make it a million times worse?
@joanneleon @maxkeiser Huh. Where does @ggreenwald work and write? 🤔
@doubtthat11 @WamsuttaLives @Planet_Phoebe there is a way to interview people without subjecting them to horrid, gross harassment.
@FaresInSA He needed to film it and broadcast her picture so she could be piled on, harassed and threatened? OK. I hope you never find yourself in that position.

@MoshuaJoss Here’s one: https://t.co/0XMBl3KBMQ
@MoshuaJoss No worries. It’s a complicated system and we did our best to explain it.
@MoshuaJoss If you read the stories we did on this, we interviewed a variety of experts on these very issues. If this is an area you’re interested in, I’d suggest looking at those reports. Lots of details and analysis.
@MoshuaJoss Because I obtained the internal US documents on this and published them.
@KyleHarper_ I don’t care where you claim you worked. There’s plenty of veteran FBI agents who have made this point and continue to.
@BrianKrauss We published extensive internal NCTC documents and the actual classified watchlisting handbook in 2014. Feel free to look that up.
@KyleHarper_ I obtained the classified rule book for watchlisting people, published it, interviewed experienced FBI agents and had them analyze the docs. First time it was ever published. What were you saying again?
@PorkSalty That was my first point.
@jacremes It would also require the FBI completely reimagining how it confronts such threats and rearranging priorities. But the bloated watchlist is definitely a factor in a many-tentacled problem.
@NateHB13 @LouisLeoIV Good question.
@georgeselson Agreed.
@bzules @georgeselson I don’t disagree. But they can and should both be addressed immediately. This shit has to stop.
@CTGlo @FBI I’m saying that the problem is multi fold. Overwhelming priority given to surveilling Muslims and now “Black identity extremists.” No doubt white terrorists are a low priority, particularly under this admin., and contributes to this as well.
And, of course, so much focus is placed on surveillance of Muslims and “Black identity extremists” and prioritized over concerns about white terrorists and mass shooters. This combined with the NRA’s insane influence and failure of Congress to stop this madness put us here.
@DanielHofheinz And he got on a plane despite being on the watchlist.
@DanielHofheinz There have been multiple mass shooters who were on the watchlist, as well as the “underwear bomber,” who managed to board a flight to the US.
@ghostOfAkilism I always say the FBI has a PhD in breaking up its own “Muslim” terror plots.
@LouisLeoIV I make no excuses. I’m pointing out one factor at play, which is indisputably part of the multifaceted disaster that is the watchlist system.
@DanielHofheinz No, it points out one of the significant factors at play.
@robogreen Exactly. And Trump is expanding it beyond Obama era levels, which were already very high.
@Gene_Starwind That’s all part of the same issue.
One of the reasons the FBI keeps failing to catch these school shooters &amp; other mass murderers is because of the enormous, bloated watchlist, filled with people who don’t belong there. It makes finding the real threats much more difficult. When everyone’s a terrorist, no one is.
@siouxdoenim @theintercept @intercepted No, it is vital we keep perspective. It is disastrous to toss all history and nuance out the door. It’s intellectually dishonest and will lead to far reaching internal power grabs and a fictional narrative about the FBI, CIA and NSA. It’s already happening.

@aaronjmate @Rorymmmkay @intercepted @democracynow @theintercept @ByronYork If you want to assume all sorts of benevolent intent on the part of Flynn, who was JSOC's intel guy, devised the kill em all strategy w McChrystal in Iraq, enjoy!

@paulsurovell @consent_factory @aaronjmate @intercepted "banned"? My god. You are on the crazy train.
@paulsurovell @consent_factory @aaronjmate @intercepted Trump is a congenital liar. As are many of his inner circle, some of whom were indicted for lying to the FBI. Are you really that out of touch?
@devinkennedy22 @aaronjmate @Rorymmmkay @intercepted @democracynow @theintercept I never accused Flynn of anything of the sort. What we know is he lied to the FBI. He has all sorts of entanglements, namely his work for Turkey that should be investigated. Not to mention his work for JSOC.
@consent_factory @aaronjmate @intercepted In that case, you had both the Intel agencies and the WH offering the exact same official story. You have a circle but you’re trying to ram it into a square hole.

@devinkennedy22 @aaronjmate @Rorymmmkay @intercepted @democracynow @theintercept That is certainly possible. But, I am not in the business of assuming benevolent motive on the part of people in power. I think we need an accounting of why they lied in all of these cases.

@aaronjmate @intercepted also, we did an entire show with Julian Assange on this, our first guest was Sy Hersh critiquing this very story and I have repeatedly done my own analysis about the state of evidence or lack thereof as facts have emerged. I believe in airing multiple views and paths of analysis.
@aaronjmate @intercepted Who do you think offers a credible, fact-based perspective that I should interview?
@Rorymmmkay @aaronjmate @intercepted @democracynow @theintercept I think Aaron brings an important view to this story, albeit with what I think is too narrow of a focus. These guys are lying scum bags and they lie about the dumbest shit. I believe in covering facts as they emerge &amp; in exploring the vast number of tentacles to this story.
@aaronjmate @intercepted @MaxBlumenthal @GrayzoneProject Also, you say "beyond Glenn" as though Glenn has not been a frequent guest on the show or one of the main commentators we have featured consistently to talk about Trump and Russia. Besides that, how was the play Mrs. Lincoln?

@2SLY4U2C does the cult ever let you out of the cabin?
@emptywheel I know. But my point was aimed at people citing Pompeo as a legit source when it fits their dumb narratives.
Resistance hero Mike Pompeo boldly denounces Glenn Greenwald's story by Jim Risen. CONNECT THE DOTS SHEEPLE.
I don't know about you, but when Mike Pompeo says a story is fake news, I know you can take it to the bank and is definitely not something we should question or challenge. He's Trump's CIA director so he must be telling the truth. Awkward!
@NoahShachtman @JennaMC_Laugh yeah, I think the use of the word "recover" in Jim's story caused a lot of confusion and Noah is correct about what Jim meant to convey.

@aaronjmate @intercepted Look at the framing of your original comment. "Does Risen acknowledge...?" Interesting that you believe the NYT must be right and Risen is just a naif.
@aaronjmate @intercepted He explains that it is not a buyback. It was aimed at understanding the full scope of what Shadow Brokers obtained. That was what NSA was pursuing. I find it interesting that you find it implausible that Pompeo and co would fear getting info that would get them in trouble w Trump
@aaronjmate @intercepted You are citing the NYT story as proof to back your position? How do you know they are right and Risen is wrong?

The notion that Jim Risen (Pulitzer winner who regularly had to fight the NYT to publish his stories) heard NYT was doing a story &amp; rushed to throw something together is a pathetic lie. Risen has been working on this for a long time. Sucks to get scooped, but that’s what happened
