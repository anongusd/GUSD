@KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow I haven’t paid much attention either.  Less drama. Now I’ll be interested in politics for the rest of my life.	The one thing that frustrates me about (most) Trump supporters is that their support is unconditional. Which is unpatriotic. What IF he DID make deals with our enemies?
@KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow Whatever happens, Trump’s plan or not, I sincerely hope it works in the way it’s meant to.	I’m positive Democrats would work with Republicans if someone else was in charge, though. I have a strong feeling that Republicans will lose the White House if Trump goes for another term.
@hill_crooked @KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow @SenSchumer You have a good point.
@KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow I’m joining the Texas State Guard in January, and I’ll hopefully be sent to the border on occasion.  I’d love to get some experience there.  I believe in strong border security.  I just don’t see a concrete wall being the best option.
@KKokensparger @NonZomb @David69Allen @marklevinshow There are many times I defend Republicans.  I don’t identify with either party.  Democrats are too soft, and Republicans are too resistant to change.  We could have the best of both worlds, but there’s too much pride.
@KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow Scores of tunnels have already been found, and quite a few have been completed.  You don’t think the wall would give a sense of false security and cause complacency?  All that money could be used on a high tech fence and added manpower.
@KKokensparger @NonZomb @David69Allen @marklevinshow I don’t condone insults or feel that people disagreeing with me makes them my enemy.  However, the President makes it a habit to insult people who are at odds with him.  It’s textbook tribalism.
@glozee1 @POTUS Oh it must have been a different link.  I just saw @potus make some misleading and/or false statements.  The usual.  It really wasn’t that heated.
@KKokensparger @David69Allen @marklevinshow The wall isn’t built, and we captured those 13.  Why build a wall that they can just tunnel under?
@marklevinshow What were you watching?

@WalshFreedom Nah.  I’m almost convinced he/she is actually above the law.  I hope I’m wrong.

@liz_addai @leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV Well I’m glad other people know exactly what I’m thinking.  Next time I have a thought I’ll get on Twitter to make sure it’s correct.
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV But what was the point of revisiting that comment?  Look, I was initially asking what comment your original tweet was referring to.  I never said you were wrong nor that he wasn’t a victim of racism.  I figured a specific tweet caused you to say that.  That’s it.
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV What?  What is that comment based on?
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV There sure has been a lot of projecting going on here, but ok.  Bye 👋🏻
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV Where in my statements do I say I’m being oppressed or want to be oppressed?
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV Even in hindsight, there was no oppression where I went to school.  When I first commented on the original tweet I was only looking for the specific tweet(s) you were referring to.  I never said no one was being racist.
@leebee4life @flakyfan @SwaggyCTV Oh I have been on the receiving end plenty of times.  Don’t let my white skin tell you otherwise.  I went to school from 1st to 12th grade as a minority.  Rarely was there another white kid in my class.  I’m very aware of racism.
@flakyfan @leebee4life @SwaggyCTV Not lecturing, and my mind isn’t made up of what you’re implying.
@flakyfan @leebee4life @SwaggyCTV It’s a word that a lot of people don’t use properly.  A person insulting someone who is of a different race doesn’t constitute as being racist.
@flakyfan @leebee4life @SwaggyCTV Yeah like I said, I’m not saying it wasn’t happening.  I was trying to get pointed in the direction of a racist tweet.
@leebee4life @SwaggyCTV I gotcha, and you’re right.  The best thing to do, in my opinion, don’t even acknowledge their existence.  They feed off the attention.  Block, and move along.
@leebee4life @SwaggyCTV I quit following Evel Dick a while back.  Seems like everything he said was negative, and he’s worse at taking criticism than Trump.  And Zach, what the hell even happened to him?  He was a prick.
@12NewsNow Well, I guess we have to take the bad with the good.  They won’t be disciplined by the district, but I’m certain they’ll be paying for that photo for years to come.
@leebee4life @SwaggyCTV I suppose I look at things differently.  I’m not saying it isn’t happening, though.  I’m sure Swaggy is a great person, but his arrogance is so strong that it overshadows the good qualities.  Reminds me of @MrPEC_Tacular.  Anyway, I’d bet that’s why people tend to attack Swaggy.
@leebee4life @SwaggyCTV I meant just for this event they’re having, but I haven’t seen anything since the show ended either.  I’ve definitely seen some assholes, but nothing truly racist.

@business But he’s a conspiracy theorist, so...who knows?

@sftblfvr01 @Mrs_ARockstar Whatever the reason, I'm 99% sure they regret the shit out of it.
@RedneckEducated @JerryDunleavy That's a horrible logic for a police officer.
@RedneckEducated @JerryDunleavy That's why the situation should be assessed.  Going in guns blazing is reckless.  This country allows citizens to carry guns.  Police officers know this.  If they can't tell good guy with gun from bad guy with gun, they need more training.
@RedneckEducated @JerryDunleavy I haven’t been trained as a police officer, so I have no clue.  However, I’m guessing they’re supposed to order all  guns to be dropped.  Not to immediately shoot anyone with a gun.
@DaveDD1981 @JerryDunleavy So their training is to shoot on sight all armed civilians?
@washingtonpost I bet people ask her all the time if she’s related to me.
@kfdmnews That’s good news.
@SenGillibrand I hope you’re correct, but from what I’ve seen, the president may just be that.
@RallySim @JerryDunleavy I agree.  This is something that I think about when I carry in public.  What if I’m mistake for the perpetrator if I’m caught in one of those situations?
@JerryDunleavy I don’t know 100% of the story, but it sounds like a police training failure.

@adeptDs12 @marklevinshow Trump thinks that insulting the other party is good diplomacy. He gets offensive at all criticism. I wouldn't consider that "taking all this shit." I would have voted Republican if it would have been someone other than Trump. I believe Rubio would have been a much better choice.

@Lamper86 @mindyreed21 @DLoesch I’m agreeing with both of you.  My problem with the NRA is that they don’t make it known enough that they support any kind of control.  I believe it’s because “control” is such a forbidden word when it comes to gun rights.  I’m actually an NRA member and I have a LTC.

So, perhaps #Dems and #Reps should alternate majorities as well as the seat of President.  Why wouldn’t that work?
Four or so vehicle accident on HWY69 in #Beaumont near the MLK exit.  I haven’t seen any #news alerts yet.

@StarTalkRadio @neiltyson @chucknicecomic Love you guys.
@MichaelAvenatti Well said.
@EdKrassen I was actually going to vote Republican until Trump was the candidate.  Any of the others would have been better than that fool.
The US Military supports just about none of the claims made by @realDonaldTrump about the immigrant caravan.  Just more lies from our President.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, because insulting people is the best way to get them on your side.  I’d expect nothing less from Trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because Mexico sucks.  I was told so by Mexicans.
@CNN Now if we can just get them to have competitive prices on all their inventory.
@FoxNews @KristinBTate @FoxFriendsFirst I’d guess within a decade it will be legal in all 50 states.
@TomiLahren Who is “you?”  I’ve never liked no-talent Kanye.  I still don’t like still-doesn’t-have-talent Kanye.
@AynRandPaulRyan @gillin_denise A lot of folks tend to panic when the media tells you not to panic.
@CNN Looks fun really.
@michael_ahrens @DLoesch @juliaioffe I don’t know if I’d go THAT far.
@TheWrap See, this is why we can’t get aliens to come down and introduce themselves.
@CNN Great news.  I can’t count how many times I’ve sat at a red light for over a minute while not a single car crosses the intersection.
@KamalaHarris @gillin_denise #Voted Saturday.
@12NewsNow That lady is clearly under the influence of something.  I wonder if she thinks the high she got was worth the embarrassment she’ll face for the rest of her life...Kids, don’t do drugs.
@TechCrunch The device should have been changed when it was still a SHORT history of problems no matter if it's user error or malfunctioning.

@TIME I have friends from Mexico and that visit Mexico.  It’s not exactly a safe place to live.
@politico Just like almost everyone else in politics.
My #votes are officially in for the #Texas #MidtermElections.
@ichthysaur @CBSNews I’m not even sure how I feel about it.  Part of me is compassionate, but the other part realizes we have rules for a reason...Isn’t Mexico quite a dangerous country also?
@CBSNews I’m highly curious of what will happen when they arrive at our border.
@washingtonpost Her pride likely kept her from giving up custody.  She’d rather be the mom who killed her child rather than the mom who didn’t want her child.
@hmmmph36 @TIME And I also agree with that.  The left goes too far...You know, I was going to vote Republican until Trump was the only one left.  I was so disappointed.  Most Twitter users think I’m a Liberal because I’m so critical of Trump.  I’m neither Democrat nor Republican.
@hmmmph36 @TIME I hold a president at a much higher standard.  That’s why he should have never been elected.  Also, nowhere have I defend Eric Holder.  This has nothing to do with him.
@Runawaypreacher @hmmmph36 @TIME I’m not surprised people are defending Trump on this issue.
@hmmmph36 @TIME Is Eric our president?
@politico There’s no telling what’s going to happen when they arrive.
@TIME I’m pretty sure he recently touted a reporter getting body slammed.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump I’m pretty sure he recently touted a reporter getting body slammed.
@business I’m pretty sure he recently touted a reporter getting body slammed.
@DylanByers Crown and 7UP, and thank you.

@12NewsNow I wouldn’t want to be known either.
@FoxNews @ShepNewsTeam He’s got my respect.  One of the only FoxNews voices not afraid to be critical of Trump when it’s needed.
@12NewsNow If the sentence contains “Category 5,” you can pretty much remove “potentially” depending on your definition of catastrophic.
@CBSNews Even IF she’s telling the truth, couldn’t she have at least watched from the car until she was sure the child was safe?
@business I’ve already made up my mind on who I’m voting for.
It’s about time for some #AHSCult.  @megalins86 refuses to watch because of the clowns. She’s 🏃🏽‍♀️💨 when they appear.
@12NewsNow Better body armor maybe?
@FoxNews This is ridiculous.  They all have the freedom to do what they choose.  Standing or kneeling doesn’t hurt anyone.
Hey, @NRA.  Do you guys oppose keeping people on the national terrorist list from purchasing firearms?
@kfdmnews @jcrawfordtv Yep.  I try to keep mine attached to me as often as I can legally.
@ILoveMsRockstar @Mrs_ARockstar I like to tell my wife, "I like to look at you because it makes my eyes feel good."
@TLCampb3 @aber6120 @BreitbartNews Sorry to reply so late.  I was at home helping the high schooler (who lives here with me) with his English...What works best for one family isn't necessarily best for all families.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews There are a number of bible versions.  The King James version being popular.  He and the church took out the parts they didn't like, and forced it onto the people.  Christianity survived the centuries because of its abundance of violence.  Not because of its truth.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews In one language, Marry was a virgin.  In another, she was “of age.”  If I remember correctly, she was 12 years old.  How do you decide which it is?  And why are there so many versions of the Bible?  And why is the story of Jesus exactly the same as stories in other religions?
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews But there were no writings from the time he supposedly lived.  Everything is decades after.  Not to mention the language barrier.  Many words have different meanings in different languages.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews How come? And I’m not trying to be a douche like a lot of other Atheists are.  Just asking why you would believe something that has no evidence of truth.
@AnnCoulter It takes a lot of nerve to stand up to a liar to defend a liar.
@TLCampb3 @aber6120 @BreitbartNews Not “were” a father figure.  Am a father figure.  They’re still living at home.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews The Adam and Eve story is absurd and also created by religion.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews I’ve been married for over two years.  Sin was created by religion, which also says they have the solution for.  I’d never follow a religion that murdered those who decided not to follow.
@TLCampb3 @aber6120 @BreitbartNews Kids aren’t hard on your wallet unless you spoil them.  My kids a learning how to earn what they get.
@GiannaLovesUSA @BreitbartNews I’m cool being a whore.
@LineCoachTim @aber6120 @BreitbartNews They have all the things they need.  Enough to make others jealous.
@aber6120 @BreitbartNews But not necessary.  I have three children born outside of marriage.  I couldn’t be more proud of them.  Above average grades, and respectful.
@BreitbartNews Marriage is not necessary.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I wish you were right.  His lying does work.  Look how many ignorant people continue to support him.  They choose to believe his lies.
@HillaryClinton And @realDonaldTrump says he is pro-life.  Only if they haven’t been born yet.
@12NewsNow That’s good for him.  He could have killed himself and/or someone else.
@realHeatherD @StormyDaniels Receiving hate replies makes my day more exciting.  It’s also practice for the occasional idiot outside of the internet.
@realDonaldTrump Country is not a proper noun in the context that you used it.
I’m about to piss of a whole lot of #Democrats or a whole lot of #Republicans.  Which one it will be depends on the absurdity in my timeline I’m about to read.  I’m never disappointed.

@Mrs_ARockstar Gems are way overrated anyway.  It’s essentially a rock that reflects light.
@FoxNews @cabot_phillips @FoxFriendsFirst I said that about Moore during his run.  Liberals immediately assumed I was on his side.  It was the first time I saw that they’re just as bad as Conservatives are when it comes to fairness.

@12NewsNow Sometimes the cup plays a role.  Very hot coffee can melt cheaply made cups.  It’s happened to me on more than one occasion.  Styrofoam is not a good taste.
What’s the point of hearings anymore?  #Dems and #Reps make up their mind as soon as the know the source of an idea.

@CBSNews Why does church have anything to do with this?
@MMunny06 @WBAP247NEWS @tedcruz You know what?  I’m beginning to reconsider my position.
@MMunny06 @WBAP247NEWS @tedcruz Would you argue that every American should have a firearm?  Gun control doesn’t insinuate banning guns.
@MMunny06 @WBAP247NEWS @tedcruz Beto isn’t trying to take rights or wealth...I knew this wouldn’t be a civil conversation.  Most are incapable of it.
@MMunny06 @WBAP247NEWS @tedcruz I don’t remove rights or wealth.  Never have.

@Porchparty @winston_hines @rachieswin @kaitcoaching How come?
@Porchparty @winston_hines @rachieswin @kaitcoaching He was manipulative, and he was able to dodge the block for nearly the entire game.  It’s not like he avoided gameplay.
@winston_hines @rachieswin @kaitcoaching This is a rare season where I think the entire final three deserve the win.
@NRA @tedcruz I don’t agree 100% with either of them on every issue.  I can’t base my vote on just this one topic.
@FoxNews @dbongino These fools always pick and choose which unnamed sources they believe.
@JudgeJeanine You can’t seriously think it only works one way.  Both parties do this same bullshit.
@DallasGOP @tedcruz I love debates.  Setting my alarm for this one.
@politico I’m just thinking every sexual abuse/assault accusation should be treated fairly for both parties.  I haven’t seen this at all.
Where can I find a 24/7 #debate channel or station?
@GraellsiaMoon @gillin_denise I wonder how many calories in each finger/serving.

I could easily put my window down and let this mosquito fly peacefully out of my car, but I decided to just kill it.  I don’t feel the least bit guilty.
@NicolasLelion @FoxNews Many of his original tweets are meant to insult someone who doesn’t agree with him.  Again, I was referring to my own profile.
@NicolasLelion @FoxNews You’re right.  He does like to insult people.  But I’m referring to the tweets I post.  I try to stay civil.
@NicolasLelion @FoxNews FYI, whenever I refer to both parties in my tweets, 90% of the time it’s a Republican who resorts to childish insults.
@FoxNews This is good.  Now, if we can just get Republicans and Democrats to do the same.
@kfdmnews I believe yesterday may have been the most humid, miserable day I’ve ever experienced.  The humidity is always the culprit.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse That’s incorrect.  People in this nation are the terrible at accepting criticism.  Any opinion you have is going to offend a Republican or a Democrat.
@washingtonpost Hurricane Harvey didn’t flood the house I just bought, but I purchased flood insurance anyway.  Peace of mind.
@latimes Man, folks sure are pissed that other people don’t share their opinion.
@realDonaldTrump You should have left this alone a long time ago.
@SwaggyCTV Which would make for a ruined season.  Bitter juries are bad for the game.
@wvjoe911 I don’t think they know what “patriot” means.
@SwaggyCTV Bitter juries make a good season bad.  Aren’t you a fan?  You should know.
@DanRather I don’t think Earth is begging.  It welcomes climate change to rid itself of the species that is toxic to the planet.
@Jim_Jordan She doesn’t speak for all Democrats, Jim.  By your logic, Republicans also want to impeach Trump, because I guarantee at least one is for it.

@cntryfan78 @CBSBigBrother @CBS Yep.  Dammit.
@Poli_NewSense @CBSBigBrother @CBS I love you...
@CBSBigBrother Too bad @CBS decided to air preseason football in my area instead of #BB20.  Don’t they have a sports channel?  Not happy at all.
@TomiLahren I agree.  It was a good read.  I’d actually respect Trump if he didn’t chose to lie so much.  No one can deny that flaw he has.
Excuse me, @CBS.  Don’t you have a Sports Headquarters channel?  Why show this pre-season game on your regular channel?  You have a whole sports channel for that.
@TheReal1SamIAm @TeamTedCruz @tedcruz @BetoORourke I suppose it's the pitches and rallies that I hear from Republicans.  They usually refer to God being an important part of all American lives.  It completely alienates 25% of the US.
@rachieswin During the episode from what I understand.
@TheReal1SamIAm @TeamTedCruz @tedcruz @BetoORourke Damn I guess it is.  I figured you would understand what I mean.  You can't possibly believe that Conservatives don't have a religious agenda.
@TheReal1SamIAm @TeamTedCruz @tedcruz @BetoORourke I never said law.
@TheReal1SamIAm @TeamTedCruz @tedcruz @BetoORourke “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”  I say Republican because I’d vote Republican were it not for this issue.  They use their Christian values to determine their decisions that affect everyone.  Not everyone is religious.
@TeamTedCruz @tedcruz @BetoORourke I find the 2nd Amendment very important, but how come so many Republicans don’t like to support the 1st?
@TomiLahren Somebody needs some sex.  Not saying any names.
@CamEdwards @NRA If some asshole breaks into your house, and you have no way to defend your family, you’re gonna feel pretty stupid.
If Fezy wins #BB20, I’ll never watch another season.
@MichaelSkolnik This just goes to show what kind of ignorant trash is on the side of Republicans.  Not that I side with Democrats.  Even if Obama WAS Muslim, so fucking what?  There’s no religious criteria to be met for the President.  All religion teaches hate.
@FoxNews @dbongino We’re in a crisis because people seem to love strengthening the division between people in America.
@BB_Updates It’s a little late now, dude.
@12NewsNow We’re becoming softer with every generation.  Eventually, humans will be too sensitive to survive alone or in groups at all.

@BetoORourke Sometimes I wonder.
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight Found another idiot.
All this #Democrats vs. #Republicans shit is getting old.  I should have gotten into #politics when I was young.
@washingtonpost It only makes sense that the wealthy support the GOP.
@CBSBigBrother Absolutely not.  One of the worst moves he could have made.
@politico People connected to Trump do a lot of walking backwards.

@bigscreen1r @TomiLahren @Johnburk11b What do you say to veterans that aren’t offended?  It was a veteran’s idea to kneel.
@bigscreen1r @TomiLahren @Johnburk11b No.  Everyone should get offended when our law enforcement abuses their power, but people seem to care more about a symbol.
@TomiLahren @Johnburk11b Says the girl who gets offended at someone kneeling for the Anthem.
@DaddyDaddymac @machar131 They certainly should not pay taxes.  That would mean they have a right to make political decisions.  I know they probably do indirectly anyway, but paying taxes would justify it.  Keep them separate.
@12NewsNow Only specific people are allowed to make bad comments in the US without lasting repercussions.
@SwaggyCTV In this reality, though, you guys left.  We can’t see those other realities.
@Scaramucci Just country.
@JakeBGibson @BretBaier I bet he did it purposely.  I would have.
@ystepin @BillOReilly When a person is accused of something, and they become extremely defensive, it’s common to assume they’re guilty.  Trump’s reactions to accusations are what keep him in their crosshairs.
@BillOReilly We, as Americans, are supposed to be critical of our President.  Critiquing him doesn’t mean against him.  Trump needs to grow up and understand that.
@nextgencali @MarketWatch True.  I wonder if they’ve ever made a move on that.
@nextgencali @MarketWatch I’m 99% sure they know.  I doubt they’ll let this happen without a fight.  I hope this doesn’t happen in Texas.
@MarketWatch Why can’t it say, “In science we trust”?  We need to teach kids how to think.  Not what to think.

@huggins_randall @FoxNews I did just now.  We’re cool.
@ChevalierCarter @CBSNews M’kay.
@CBSNews I believe in the “stand your ground” law, but this was clearly a misguided individual who jumped at the chance to shoot someone.  He should be charged.
@huggins_randall @FoxNews No one on this planet is a true Christian.  Including yourself.  If you followed the word of your psychotic god, you’d be in prison.
@ABC @megynkelly Why does it matter that he’s black?  What race is the dumbass shooter?
@kebejay @jamesrhine Am I missing something?
People who never have any intention of questioning their own beliefs are the worst.  Don’t be #factblind.
@RTP1111 @McPutinFace2 @FoxNews It harms the NFL because Republicans, not the players, chose to make it political.  By your logic, kneeling for the anthem is more offensive than a law officer violently abusing his power.
@RTP1111 @McPutinFace2 @FoxNews C’mon man.  You know why they kneel, and it does absolutely no harm to anyone.
@DatingAngie Makes them feel better about their own flaws.  This is actually a great looking group of houseguests.
@Vanessa12News @12NewsNow What does the “C” represent?
@FoxNews @dbongino Yes.  I don’t even have to say that person’s name.  Taking into account the positive things that have come from him, he’s still ruined what many people think of the Republican Party.  Any of the other 15 or so candidates would have done so much better.
@FoxNews More appropriate would be “In willful ignorance we trust.”
@huggins_randall @FoxNews Look at the countries in the world that use religion to dictate their laws.  That’s what is stupid.  You really want the US to abide by the laws of the Bible?
@FoxNews Was this photo used in error?
@asknotwhatucan Educate me, then.
When I go to sleep, I think about being invincible and traveling to Saturn or Jupiter just to see what it sounds like.  Or what the center really is.  I also think about drifting in space for eternity happening upon whatever random thing is in my path.
@RTP1111 @FoxNews What do criminals not listening have to do with our conversation?  What does kneeling for the anthem have to do with the initial topic?  You just keep changing the subject.  Do you have anything else to say about what we were first discussing?
@RTP1111 @FoxNews Sorta like police brutality.
@CNN When they say “over the weekend,” do they mean Saturday and Sunday, or the artist?  Serious answers only.
@RTP1111 @FoxNews It’s not up for debate if they respect the constitution.  Even if the constitution didn’t prohibit this, it’s disrespectful to at least a quarter of the population.
@RTP1111 @FoxNews Read the 1st amendment.
@J_Wick_Erbasket @FoxNews Not everyone is religious.
@FoxNews Did they forget about separation of church and state?  It’s part of those amendments they support so strongly.
@bennyjohnson @AnnCoulter I doubt any of those on camera know anything about what’s going on in politics.  All their information comes from #Facebook memes.

It’s time for some #DosEquis and #BB20.
@Shakespeare527 My wife and I watched that last night.  I knew they were under the influence just from hearing it.
@kwilli1046 @jamesrhine I’d vote here, but I’m not liberal or conservative.
@reauxgoldnkrys Oh...well shit!
I gotta be honest.  If I dealt with as much as @realDonaldTrump, whether he deserves it or not, I think I’d need to go golfing too.
Players #kneeling at the #anthem literally does no harm to anyone, and it’s their #1stAmendment right.  The same people against kneeling are the same ones who support a president who dodged the draft, and says he like soldiers better if they weren’t POWs.  Please explain.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi What a great way to unite people.
@_AlexanderHammy @politico I’d say I used to consider myself Democrat, but realized they’re too soft on most issues.  Republicans, in my opinion, are just the opposite.  They won’t budge for any reason.  Even when they’re clearly wrong.  I’d like to see more than a two party system before I’m dead.
@_AlexanderHammy @politico Thank you.  I was never interested in politics as a teen or young adult.  I wish I would have been since it has now become such a sensitive subject.  No doubt social medial carries much of the blame (or credit).
@_AlexanderHammy @politico Modern authors would be preferred.
@_AlexanderHammy @politico Could you suggest some reading material on the subject?  Unbiased if possible.
@_AlexanderHammy @politico I didn’t hear the term “progressive” until maybe a couple years ago.  Why do you think that is?
@_AlexanderHammy @politico Advancement of science is one of them.
@JinjoRene @BreitbartNews lol What?
@_AlexanderHammy @politico What ideas of Progressive thinking to you believe to be destroying the country?
@_AlexanderHammy @politico Who are you referring to when you say “you?”
@LaylaRoy Trulia has a lot of houses.  You can filter for what you’re looking for.
@politico You don’t call for unity by insulting the opposing party.  You find common ground and find ways to compromise.

@BreitbartNews And D.L. Hughley doesn’t get to decide how my mind works.
@JulieChen @CBSBigBrother Well, I was ready, but @CBS is airing football instead.
@CBS So is this going to happen every Thursday for the entire #BigBrother season?  The most important episode of the week will not be shown so that you can air the ad-ridden football games?
#Cosentyx has the people in their commercial telling us to look at their clear skin, but their wearing a pound of makeup.
@SwaggyCTV She did look like a fool at that veto meeting, though.  Confident and clueless.  That’s a bad mix.
@FoxNews What does a rapists work ethics have to do with him being a rapists?  He may be a great worker, but he’s still a fucking rapist.
@zingbotfanatic @Shakespeare527 @realvegas4sure I hope.  I at least want to see his reaction to getting his trip taken from him.
For your own safety, do not move to #Chicago!
@michellebb10 That was great. Lol Thank you.

If someone said this to me, I’d laugh in their face.		“Those who love their father or mother more than they love me are not worthy of me. And those who love their son or daughter more than they love me are not worthy of me.”
Almost forgot about #coffee this morning.  So, now I think there may be something wrong with me.  No fever.  No headache.  Stomach seems fine.  Lymph nodes aren’t swollen from the Bubonic Plague.  I need to get to the bottom of why I forgot...I may just be overreacting.
@BillOReilly Damn, he’s already doing more than you.  How can you think he’s not doing enough already?
@machar131 Easy, but very useful.  I like it.
@machar131 Ok now I need an excuse to make some pivot tables.
@machar131 The world needs nerds like you and I.
@machar131 Oh yeah.  I’m the geek of the family, and I’m proud of it.
@machar131 Definitely a learning experience.  I’ve started keeping track of my vehicle maintenance on an Excel spreadsheet.

Don’t do what I did and forget to have your tires rotated regularly.  I lost about 20k miles off the life of mine for it.
@horning_kenneth @FoxNews @Rosie No hairy arm pits.
@Adoomies1 Possibly.  I’m interested in seeing what she’s got when put in the spotlight.  I haven’t seen this many players actually involved in the game in years.
@Adoomies1 I can’t agree with that making her better.  She did it anonymously.  Anyone could do that.
@FoxNews @Rosie Oh man she looks like an older version of my ex-girlfriend. 😐
@BreitbartNews Fully semi?  I haven’t been into guns very long, but something sounds incorrect about that.
@arieah2 @KellyDa23594952 @SwaggyCTV In what way is Tyler cocky?  I’ve only seen him talk about his plans and how things seem to work out for him in the game.
@Pontifex Money!  Don’t forget to give them a bunch of money!
@BB_Updates Welp, I like Tyler, but she’s right.  It’s a great game move for her.
@KellyDa23594952 @arieah2 @SwaggyCTV Right.  Now, I did like him once he was put on the block and was humbled.  Even though it was short lived.
I think #BBSam has lost her mind.  Does she know what game this is? #BB20
#BBBaleigh is a decent player besides the fact she thinks she owns people.  #BB20
@arieah2 @SwaggyCTV I haven’t seen Tyler say “How can I not be the most Trending.”
@idolknights What’s the time stamp for this?
@realDonaldTrump Why did they initially lie about something that was legal?
@waltonravenBB19 Worse is advertisements before a video that are longer than the video.
@SwaggyCTV Our timelines must be more different than I thought.
@NotDonnaBrazile And better EarPods.  I’ve never worn anything worse.
@EvelDick Rockstar said later that 1200 wasn’t intended to be the answer.
@washingtonpost They’re right that if it would have been anything other than white, the outcome would have been way different.  However, if someone wants speak derogatorily towards others, let them.  They’re only hurting themselves.
@IAmUnicornKing @JulieChen @CBSBigBrother The reading of the book?  Hamlet I believe.  They aired it several weeks ago.
@deadunclekenny @JulieChen @CBSBigBrother She’s welcome in my home.  You don’t speak for everyone.
@GeraldoRivera @Acosta @seanhannity @maddow The worst part of it all is that the public doesn’t do their own fact checking.  They choose to believe the person who shares the same views.
@SwaggyCTV Don’t give them the attention they’re asking for.  When you tweet about it, they win.
@JackieMcCarthyx I’ve found very few fresh brewed coffee that tastes as good as Starbucks or my own.
@SwaggyCTV C’mon man.  She’s painting a target on her own back.  She’s snapping for no reason.
Anytime I hear a Drake song, I think to myself, “How is this music considered art?”  I think a 4-year-old writes his music for him.
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's one person.  Not all of media.
@ChesapeakeCoach @MarketWatch Right.  I learned that I studied the wrong major for where I live.  Now I have a degree that is useless in this area.
@tobeme56 @DLoesch They did create it.  You’re right, but feeding it is not a way to persuade.  Their minds can be changed.  My wife is proof. 😂
@tobeme56 @DLoesch Yeah I guess if you’re into creating more animosity between the two main parties.
@DLoesch 2A advocates need to show that we’re responsible with our rights.  3D printing guns undermines that.
@DLoesch 3D printing guns goes against all the effort put into gun safety.  Very reckless.
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Well, now we know your position on democracy.
@EWestling I missed it.  I guess it's not as useful as CBS thought it would be.
Do the houseguests realize they have intercoms in the HoH room? #BB20
@FoxNews @MonicaCrowley @IngrahamAngle Or because he said, “I hate all the same people you hate.”
I think the only thing that could possibly hurt my feelings is if @NielDegrasse told me I was stupid.
@SteveMunoz17 @axios I’ll stick with my Glock.
@ClockworkHeart I just read about it.  I didn't know it existed.  Shut down about ten years ago.
@ClockworkHeart Sims needs multiplayer!
@ChaseMit I just always say yes.
@ClockworkHeart I built my own with duel monitors.  I ran World of Warcraft and The Sims 4 at the same time and at the highest graphics with no lag.  I'd say I did pretty good.
The hardware for the computer that I'm building for my wife will be delivered tomorrow.  She just wants to play The Sims 4, but it'll have far greater capabilities.
@BreitbartNews I’d do the same.  Walls are fun.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump This will be deemed fake news since it is not to Trump’s liking.
@axios Go ahead and let them fire off these guns.  These idiots will get a rude awakening when the gun fails, but the bullet does not.
I’d love to throw an #Atheist and #NRA sticker on my car, but I’d most likely get a busted window from a far right Christian or a far left gun control advocate.  There are assholes everywhere.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Speaking of hypocrisy, remember when Roseanne deliberately disrespected the flag and anthem?  What was she protesting?
@AngelSanJuan313 Dayuuum!  Congratulations @JillianFertig.
@Krnnnn_ @SwaggyCTV I believe it was Swaggy’s arrogance that got so many people against him.  It rubbed me the wrong way, too.  Confidence is great, but his arrogance was of the charts.  That’s one personality trait I can’t stand from anyone.
@BradChacos @pcworld It’s a cruel reminder that...I don’t have any friends. 🤣
@12NewsNow This reminds me that I don’t even know what my blood type is.
@Krnnnn_ @SwaggyCTV This is inaccurate.  I’ve seen and still see Kaitlyn bashing for all her questionable tactics.  In fact, more so than Swaggy.
@CBSNews Laying off employees to cover an inmate’s medical bills?  There’s no way that’s the only solution.
@JustinThomas34 @BretBaier That was great.
@BreitbartNews Welp, we don’t need her on Earth anymore.
@FoxNews @dallascowboys @dak @NFL For a party that always says Democrats get offended too easily, you guys sure do get offended easily.
@business For as much as a Porsche costs, it shouldn’t need to be made more anything.
Scratch that.  It was more like a bump.
@BB_Updates Mean, but funny at the same time.
Did JC just punch Rachel in the mouth?  I think it was an accident. #BB20
@FoxNews @hogangidley45 @POTUS @BarackObama @JudgeJeanine What are “those types?”  Can’t they just find something else?  Republicans always harp on people without a job unless they can blame it on Obama.
If you support your president unconditionally, you are the opposite of a #patriot.
@CBSBigBrother @JulieChen @helloross @MarissaJWinokur I thought she was pretty good TV.  I don't care about her personal life.  Some people seem obsessed with it.
@CBSNews You misspelled “correctly.”
@washingtonpost An increase of 3D printed guns will result in an increase of blown off fingers.
@bbclipshow Well, if Tyler is gullible enough to believe it...
@RealMuckmaker Please leave America.
@realDonaldTrump One who covers his own ass.
RT @MaddowBlog: White House edits video to remove question about whether Putin wanted Trump to win. https://t.co/ExlsHNlgF8
@AnnCoulter Baseless accusations with zero evidence?  How does she say that with a straight face?  That’s describing Trump.  Then, when someone asks her about a blatant lie from Trump, she just says, “Look, I’m not gonna get into that...”
@FoxNews @TGowdySC @POTUS A real republican patriot isn’t afraid to be critical of the president.  Trey Gowdy is the perfect example of that.
@machar131 @TGowdySC I have a lot of respect for Gowdy.  He’s not afraid to be critical of Trump like a lot of Republicans are.
I hope @TGowdySC runs for president one day.
So there’s breakfast, lunch, dinner...What’s the next meal called.  I know I’m not the only person who begins to die of malnutrition if I stay up a little late.
@realDonaldTrump When you say "your," who exactly are you referring to?
Why, @CBSBigBrother, do you cut the feeds at random times?  I think my subscription gives me the right to an explanation.
@megmaley Water, H2O, and then some water.  The misery after drinking is almost entirely from dehydration.
@Kassting I watched all the way up until everyone left Sam’s HoH room.
How come @factcheckdotorg doesn’t have a television news channel?  I’d watch that all day long.
Like new after a good cleaning. #glock17 https://t.co/bqTRNouUwr
@JulieChen Hell no!
@TomiLahren I’m down with that.
@realDonaldTrump You’re congratulating her, but making it about you.
@TomiLahren You’re categorizing people in ways that are inaccurate.  Similar to what #Trump does.
@jcrawfordtv I’d love to be a network engineer.  I have an IT degree and I’m A+ certified. Got stuck doing scaffolding, though.  All the IT stuff seems to be in Houston.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump This is a great idea.  I’d wait until Trump is out of office though.  That way it’s more meaningful.
Not much worse than a receiving an email from a superior with horrible grammar. #grammarnazi
@BillOReilly Yet the president you support gives false information daily.  You’re one of the sheep.
@YahooFinance @business It’ll say a lot about her if she accepts the money.
@CNN What was he doing with a concrete brick anyway?  It’s all his fault.
@NoSpinNews @BillOReilly I’d just like him to stop lying constantly.  That’s it.
@FoxNews lol
@TechCrunch @JoshConstine Fine with me.  I pass over anything that says “Promoted” anyway.
@12NewsNow Excellent.  Tobacco should be illegal everywhere.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle You know what else is unnecessary?  Donald Trump.  Another Republican candidate could have done all the positives Trump has done without acting like a teen going through puberty.
It would be ideal for #Dems or #Reps to convert others to their side.  Why do they think bashing the other party like a child is the best way to persuade?
@FoxNews @foxandfriends Ok.  So let the damn investigation run its course so we can make it official.
So many words I hate now because of #BigBrother.  Literally, like, for sure, totally, seriously...I don’t even want them in my kids’ vocabulary anymore. #BB20
@FoxNews @BenSasse @foxnewsnight Why, then, do Republicans get irate when someone wants their president checked?
@ACLU @NoFascistLies Pro-life, though, right?
@business I’m trying to go all #solarpower.  I’m off to a good start with my back porch light.  Better than nothing.
@WSJ Seems like people are going overboard with all this.
Playing the original #DOOM is so much better with the music off.  Not that the music is bad, but it’s more creepy without it. #gamerlife
Imagine what the #USA would be like if every politician was 100% honest for one day.
Damn clients saying they need an additional library of information on the day before the bid deadline.  Do we really want to work for you?
@PaulWSenior1 @FoxNews Truth.  Not snark.  You’re saying Trump acted like a mature adult?
@PaulWSenior1 @FoxNews And what is your comment based on?
@12NewsNow This should be punishable by life in prison.
@FoxNews What else did he say, @FoxNews?  Anything about sexual assault victims?  Nothing?  I thought I heard him making fun of them, but I guess you guys decided not to hear that.
@washingtonpost Not even surprised.
@bigbrothernet @MichelleMBB18 I really don’t see why this is a big deal.
@FoxNews My 8 year old twins act more mature than Trump.
@FoxNews Regarding the comments, people are too damn sensitive.
What if you’re pulled over by police, and the officer is using unnecessary force?  Should you defend yourself if your have a firearm?  Or should you just allow the treatment?  Either way, I don’t see you coming out of it not guilty.
@business Great way to CYA.
@THR How did that show racism at all?
@NRA @realDonaldTrump How about a president who supports all amendments?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @courierjournal So you think he represents the entire Left?  Your logic will backfire.
@Diablo I think I like every part of Act 1.
@ReporterTiffany @petereliopoulos @kfdmnews Get ready for people to make this political.
@TomiLahren Watching this without sound is hilarious.
So, did you guys hear about #LeBron leaving the Cleveland Browns or something?
@FoxNews @Johnny_Joey I wish all this was true.  People say they don't care about other people's private life, but they actually begin to make judgements as soon as they learn they are different.
My #beagle licking me in the face wouldn’t be so bad if he didn’t eat his own poop.
@business How about some AirPods that don’t fall out of the ear at the slightest touch?  Whoever designed these should be terminated.
@FoxNews @derekahunter The more religious party saying the other party lacks rational thought is the most hypocritical comment I’ve seen today.
@Crazzyintheusa Idiot.  I'd never do meth before howling on a stranger's roof.
@AsgardiaSpace I drink at least one every morning, but if research says to drink more, I'll gladly drink more.
@PatrickVaughn4 @weathermodels_ I'm probably allergic to everything it's carrying.
@CNN Thoughts and prayers have never been enough.  It just makes people feel better about doing nothing.
@FoxNews @mgoodwin_nypost Says the news agency who supports a president lashing out every morning.
@Spotify @Drake I swear this guy has the most redundant music I’ve ever heard.  How is this entertaining?
In order to make a modern rap song, just talk about how awesome you think you are and add some tired ass beat to the background. #rap #music
@PressSec @POTUS Well, perhaps there’s something about you that’s against her religious beliefs.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Fox News Polls?  You’re gonna have to use way more news agencies to get an unbiased result.  How do you not know that?
@EvelDick Dayuuuum!!!
@NRA Squirrel hunting with my dad.  I was around 8 years old.  I used a .22 rifle.
If we want corruption and abuse of power to be snuffed out of our government, why is @Snowden in trouble for whistleblowing?
That @Lowes ad that can be seen right before a video that is tweeted. Yeah, it causes me to just keep on scrolling. I don’t even see the actual post.  #Advertising has taken over this world, and I hate it.
@MeganAnnBB19 I’d be on that wall constantly.  That house is awesome.
Man, I just watched the #bb2018tour.  Best setup they’ve ever had.
@trinityw23 @MeganAnnBB19 A little immaturity every now and then is entertaining, but last season was wall-to-wall childish.  To be fair, I have no idea what being in the BB House is like.  So, maybe it’s that much of a mind altering experience.
@EvelDick I can't even imagine what she looks like without all that...stuff.
@trinityw23 @MeganAnnBB19 That they have no idea what they're getting into.
I didn’t realize Hurricane #Harvey had a little brother.
I’m in shock that I’m leaning more towards the Republicans’ side when it comes to the border, but folks crossing illegally can’t bring kids to jail with them.  Or wherever it is they’re held.  The blame can’t be put on our border security.
I’m certain that #Republicans are lying about having their hands tied concerning separating families at the border.  I’m also certain that #Democrats are over exaggerating the situation at the border.  Neither side really cares about those kids.  It’s all political ammo.
Heavy downpour outside?  Me and my entire household (dogs included) go out to play in it.
The guy behind IG Horowitz looks a lot like Jeff Goldblum. #FBI #DOJ #SenateCommittee
@thejessicagraf The fans.
@helloross So far, my favorite from these interviews is Ross.
@MeganAnnBB19 Not yet.  A different side of them is shown once they enter the house.  I don't trust my initial impressions.
@FoxBusiness @POTUS Nuh uh!  Antarctica does!
@helloross Why don't they just put a bag over their head?  Nothing wrong with that.
@maryjay39 @thejessicagraf Right.  I like sprinkles of childishness and immaturity in the season.  Not three months of it.
@thejessicagraf Is this a way for production to rig the game and blame it on America?
@nowthisnews Trump doesn't seem to understand.  They sit up out of fear.  Not out of respect.
@siessdav @DLoesch That’s not even close to what my point was.  Thanks, though.
@DLoesch Folks always forget about the separation of church and state.  It's there for a reason.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews I’ll give him that, but only that.  I believe Americans should be highly critical of every president.  Their responsibility is too great for us to give any passes.  Do you agree?
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews We shouldn't ignore it, but you're making attacks on Obama as if I said he was better than Trump.  When did I say I was an Obama supporter?  This entire conversation stems from me saying it's too early to tell if the Summit was a success.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews Some of these numbers are not matching ones I found from other sources.  But even if they were accurate, how does this make him the worst president?  And why does every Trump supporter turn everything into a conversation about Obama?
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews Explain how he is the worst president.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews Unemployment started a downward trend while Obama was in office.  It could be said that Obama is the reason unemployment is so low. https://t.co/sqBJJZf0of
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews So you can’t educate me?  I can wait, too.  It never fails that Trump followers act like I insulted their entire family when I’m critical of him.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews How does Trump have anything to do with black unemployment?
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews Yes really.  Black unemployment has been going down for years.  It has nothing to do with the president.
@seculardotorg You better hope @VP doesn't have a say in it.  That self-righteous bigot would love to have us all looking like sheep.
@FoxNews @KatiePavlich @BarackObama No one is more obsessed with Obama than Fox News.
@VP Billy Graham was a con.  That's all.
@VP If your god already has a flawless plan, what's the point of praying?
@VP @POTUS Another example of how you consistently alienate the large amount of people that do not share your beliefs.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews While I hope you're right, he seems to only be interested in helping white, Christian males.  He's good at alienating anyone else.
@DeplorableNew @jamacia813 @FoxNews Fair enough, but Obama would have needed to start somewhere.  I feel that Trump is putting too much trust in Kim’s word.
@DeplorableNew @FoxNews I’ll give him credit when North Korea gets rid of its nuclear weapons.  Until then, it’s pending.
@FoxNews It’s WAY too early to deem this a success.
Anyone else ever strained their back just from coughing?  I can barely stand up straight.
This song called “Look Alive” is on.  How the hell is this entertaining to anyone?
Just heard that Kim brought his own toilet so no one could examine his doodoo.  Can someone confirm? #NorthKoreaSummit
RT @RebzBrown: Religion is never an excuse to discriminate. No hate. No exceptions. @seculardotorg #CapitalPride https://t.co/wDVkURVQHo
@WSJ A fist fight between Trump and Kim would be hilarious.
@gillin_denise @MarkHertling lol “From what I’ve heard” is code for “I just now made this shit up.”
I know I harp on #Republicans a lot, and it’s not that I’m anti-republican. In fact, I was voting Republican in 2016 until #Trump won primary. I don’t understand why they have such devotion to a compulsive liar like Trump. The seat of US President will never seem as sacred.
@MarkHertling @gillin_denise When he says “From what I’ve heard...” you know he’s lying.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump is calling someone dishonest?...okay.
@mxvizcaino @FoxNews That’s usually what happens.  I may be part cow.
@TomiLahren So kneeling during the anthem is more offensive than police brutality?  That’s what America is about to you?  #FakePatriot
@FoxNews It can be 100 degrees outside...I’m still drinking some milk.
@BryanJFischer You’re advertising your stupidity.
@12NewsNow So should we all stop having sex with robots?  I need to know before I get home.
@realDonaldTrump So are you going to fire Scott Pruitt?
@bigleaguepol If this is relevant to you, why do you support a president that the KKK supports?
@hillaryrenee I really wasn’t serious.  It’s just my personal opinion that women always look more attractive without make-up. They would argue that it covers their imperfections, but perfect is not a good thing.  It’s boring.
@southyarradan That justifies murder?
@EvelDick ...and make make-up illegal.
@southyarradan And you believe that’s the fault of US civilians?  So, you want US civilians to die?  How are you any better than what you claim the US government is?
@southyarradan You are mistaken.  I’ve yet to understand your end-game here, by the way.
@southyarradan Most nations that are part of the UN do not get approval before declaring war.  I take it that’s what you’re getting at.
@southyarradan Yes.
@Plynott883 @southyarradan @PressSec @POTUS It would not surprise me.
@southyarradan Insults always come from the person who has no argument.
@southyarradan How are they illegal?...and I still don’t see why that’s relevant.
@southyarradan Ok, thanks.  I’m not sure what point you’re trying to get across, though.
@southyarradan I can’t speak for the entire US, but I know I’m definitely not one of the bad guys.  America isn’t perfect, but I bet whatever nation you claim, it’s not perfect either.  Don’t act as if we’re the only country to make mistakes.
@southyarradan Because we have allies that we help defend from the threats they face.
@southyarradan Please explain what makes me self-centered.
@southyarradan So, the US is the bad guy in your views, yet you’re the one cheering for violence.
@southyarradan I become uninterested in a conversation when the other person repeatedly makes assumptions about me.  It’s a sign that nothing productive will become of it since you’ve already created your image of me without knowing who I am.
@southyarradan I didn’t need anything 200 years ago, because I hadn’t been born yet.  And I’ve already explained the reason for guns now.
@southyarradan We don’t need them to fight the government.  We need them to PREVENT a hostile take over BY our government.  It’s happened plenty of times throughout history in other countries.
@southyarradan That may be true, but we would also be at the mercy of our own government.  That’s the reason for our 2nd amendment.
@neiltyson But just in case we can’t avoid one, what should our first move be?  I need a contingency plan.
@southyarradan Why are you giving up so quickly?  I only asked for a reason to your comment.
@southyarradan Why would we want everyone to shoot one another?
@southyarradan @PressSec @POTUS That’s my point.  People shouldn’t know where they meet.  People with evil intentions only need to watch the news to collect intel.
@PressSec @POTUS Does anyone besides me think that detailed information on where multiple world leaders will be should be kept secret until it's that time?
@elenadavies I swear I was thinking this yesterday.  You can build an anything-sandwich.
@realDonaldTrump You know what would be great?...if you’d provide a source of your information.  Do that, and maybe people would stop seeing you as a compulsive liar.
@KeithAlnwick @CBSNews They did that just before he was elected.  People were all for it until they found out it was Hitler’s quote and not Trumps.  Look it up.  You’ll find it.
Of all the news outlets I follow, @FoxNews is the only one that has me watching ads before a video.  No, thanks.  I’ll just keep on scrolling.
@kfdmnews So, all these families can’t get the help they need, but a church near my job received somewhere in the proximity of $500k for Harvey?  I didn’t see anyone living at that church, either.  How is that right?
@TKless12News @EBrillWx I've got great rain gear.  My house.
@NeeleyJonea Drinking + shopping = me buying some totally unnecessary shit that I'll regret later.
@NoFascistLies Hearts without god?  So many people have been murdered in God’s name, and you think hearts without god is the problem?
@PnhnlTXK9Trainr @NoFascistLies Prayer is allowed in school if it’s student-led.
@realDonaldTrump I doubt you wouldn’t have hired him.  You hired Flynn even after you were warned about him.  You make stupid decisions out of spite.
@realDonaldTrump Damn, dude!  Can you get off this?  You act like you’re a nervous wreck from guilt.  If you’ve done nothing wrong, just sit back and watch them fail.
@kfdmnews This guy has bad decisions written all over him...
@robbystarbuck @EricTrump @CNN These are ratings for basic cable.  How about the rest of the outlets?  This is incomplete information.
Somebody needs to get a presidential campaign going already so I can start doing some research.
@realDonaldTrump I suspect that you’re working for the Democrats to make Republicans look like fools.  It makes me feel great knowing that I’m not on either team.
@ReporterTiffany I realized then how much I needed a truck.  I was fortunate enough to be in a safe area in Nederland, but I wanted to help people.  There wasn’t much I could do with a car.  My next vehicle will definitely be a truck or SUV.
@ReporterTiffany Oh no I was just expressing my sympathy after I just used a good bit of water for something less important than what they need it for.
@FoxNews @TheRealJohnHCox Why don’t they move forward with dividing it into several smaller states?
@ReporterTiffany This isn’t really what I wanted to read after I just used water to pressure wash my porch. 😐
@JonathanRiggeri @CNN I agree, but it’s not just CNN and Democrats.  Republicans are equally guilty of the same thing.  They’re just pitting Americans agains one another, and we play right into it.
@TechCrunch It’s only evil because people apply so much of their negativity to it.
@CBSNews It’s much easier to draw pictures on a larger piece of paper.
@washingtonpost Sell some of those #PruittPens.
@WestWingReport I’d do the same.  From my understanding, she was a wreck when Trump won the presidency.
@TIME Great read.  If one of these tactics doesn’t work, you should just quit. lol
@CNN All these people commenting comparing Obama and Trump with their civilian body count.  Fitting right in with the media.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You’re a liar though, so....
@FoxNews I bet no one who asks the question of "Who's kneeling?" is kneeling.
I'm all in for arming teachers, but they should require extensive firearm training.
The @1045KISSFM site playlist shows the songs they play, but doesn’t show how many time they repeat the same damn song in an hour.  Expand please.  I hate every song they have due to them being overplayed.
@TIME Anyone who gives to him is an idiot.
I would have voted #Republican for 2016 if it had been anyone other than #Trump.  Instead, I sat my ass at home.  No regrets.
I'm thinking no one should have the power to pardon anyone.  It's an abuse of power any way you look at it.
So many #fakepatriots going crazy when people kneel in protest at the anthem, but fully support a person who spits at our country after mocking it because it's "funny."  Either be for them both, or against them both.
@Mark_Kelley1 @foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Why do you assume I haven't?  Your explanation would have been a satisfying answer.  No need for the whataboutism that I see in every other subject.
@FoxNews @robertjeffress @AmericaNewsroom ...and faith literally means belief without evidence.  That's where all the lies come from.  Thanks for explaining that.
@foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews So, why does he deserve full pardon?
@JudgeJeanine @DineshDSouza @POTUS He plead guilty.  Why is he getting a pardon?
@realDonaldTrump Even Obama warned you.  Are you too proud to admit he was right?
@marcorubio @POTUS I agree, but #Trump and his supporters do the same thing regarding Obama.  Hypocrites run this country.
Today’s televangelists are no better than the conmen who started all the #religion bullshit so long ago.
@EvelDick Other morons.
@SenBillNelson Definitely crosses a line.
@EricAdkins28 @ChelseaClinton It’s always the least intelligent people who make insults.
@FoxNews The best way for people to think they’re doing something without doing a damn thing.
@12NewsNow I can see how this is true.  I also get these reactions when I know a package is being delivered that day.
@realDonaldTrump Repeat this very slowly...”President Obama warned me about Michael Flynn.”
I’m a small guy, and this holster I bought from @AlienGHolsters allows me to comfortably conceal a full sized firearm.  G17 to be exact.
@CBSNews I need to know the year, make, and model of her vehicle.
@bigleaguepol Just think of it as population control.
@CBSNews He makes a fool of himself on a regular basis.  I don't understand why people have such devotion to him.
@Antisipation_ @realDonaldTrump @nytimes I wouldn’t know.  I’m not a liberal.  I am, however, someone who fact checks.  Trump lies daily whether you like it or not.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes So, do you and them compete on who can tell the most lies in a day?
Can’t say I didn’t see that coming. #NorthKoreaSummit
@realDonaldTrump If you did nothing wrong, why do you pay the investigation so much attention?
@realDonaldTrump Being pro-life really doesn’t say anything about a person’s character.  You touting it just makes you self-righteous.
@eshaLegal @NoFascistLies Gotcha.  I forgot all about her.  She may as well be saying women can’t have their own opinion.
@eshaLegal @NoFascistLies So women are supposed to unconditionally support other women?
@charlie_forlove @NeeleyJonea How do they now have a huge problem with immigrants coming to America if they’re all dead?  Not one of those white people you’re talking about are alive today.
Guess who's taking their #LTC class today!
@12NewsNow It sure does take a lot of casualties for leaders to realize prayer isn't doing anything for anyone.  Well, I guess it does make the person praying feel like they're doing something.
I sure do wish I gave a damn about the #RoyalWedding, because that shit is everywhere.
Once I’m no longer in need of this @ASUS router for a repeater, I’m taking it outside and smashing it into the sidewalk.
@bigleaguepol Team?  The States are supposed to be united.
@rachelkellertv @12NewsNow Even bad coffee is better than no coffee.
@NRA @ChrisCoxNRA I support you guys and what you stand for, but why does religion have to be brought into it?  Not necessary.
@AsianJamesBB17 Nicotine addiction.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @NBCNews How come you guys don’t call out #Trump for his lies and misleading statements?  It occurs daily.
@realDonaldTrump You’ve lied at least 1,000 times since being in office.  That’s not an exaggerated number.
@FoxNews Is there anyone who follows @FoxNews that is also interested in Jay-Z?  I’m legitimately curious.
If #Trump said he hated America, @FoxNews would jump on that wagon and defend him.  You guys should know that being anti-Trump doesn’t make you a Democrat or unpatriotic.  That’s the beauty of being an American.  We can be critical of our leaders.
@FLindsay14 @realDonaldTrump Two of those hostages were captured after Trump took office.  Your real leader is a liar.
I support what the #NRA stands for 100%, but their rhetoric is way overdramatic.  The People will not let guns be banned.  Have you been to Texas?
@WSJ He’ll most likely be fired tomorrow.  Truth is a no-no in politics.
@FoxNews Well, it had me laughing.  You’re kidding yourself if you think it’s not about Reps and Dems.  Everything is.  Folks just don’t like to admit it.
There is no way in Hell that @MELANIATRUMP married @realDonaldTrump for his personality.
@TomiLahren Calm down.  Most of that book wasn’t even written by Trump.
@WSJ It’s already ridiculous that so many women think they need makeup.  Men don’t need it either.
@rjmoyer98 @FoxNews @Franklin_Graham I find it interesting that your god’s answer of yes or no is strikingly similar to random chance.
@outlawbooster @FoxNews @Franklin_Graham lol
@realDonaldTrump You know, I might believe in your innocence if you would carry yourself like an adult, defend yourself like an adult...
@CariAnnHamilton @FoxNews @Franklin_Graham They pray to make themselves feel like they’ve done something.
So, my 15-year-old told me a few days ago that he no longer considers himself #Christian.  He’s finally realized how absurd and unnecessary religion is.  I’m very proud of him.
@bjdoor @FoxNews @Franklin_Graham Nope.  They’re dead serious, dude.  Ridiculous.
@FoxNews @Franklin_Graham Well, I don’t understand the power of prayer.  I’ve seen people praying for mass shooting victims for years now.  We still have mass shootings.  That’s just one example.  So, please explain to me the power of prayer.
@realDonaldTrump You’ve made over 1,000 false claims since being in office.  Why should we believe anything you say?
RT @factcheckdotorg: In his remarks yesterday, Trump repeated his false claim that "80% of spending is coming to the NATO from the United S…
@FoxNews As if Trump isn’t highly self absorbed.  He takes jabs at Obama on a daily basis.
@GraellsiaMoon Awesome.  Thank you.

@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino I’m ok with not knowing things.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino I know a lot about Christianity and the Bible. That’s WHY I’m not a Christian or part of any other religion. It’s unnecessary.  People use religion to justify their hate towards people. If Jesus were to actually exist, he’d be ashamed of those who call themselves Christian today.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino Those insults are very Christian of you.  Good job trying to convince me.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino lol I thought you had to be a certain age for a Twitter account...Something that does not exist cannot be proven to not exist.  I could say unicorns exist, but you cannot prove that they don’t.  Same concept.  The burden of proof is on you.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino So judgmental.  I’m simply asking for evidence that you have yet to provide.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino Their parents.  The same applies to them.  Why do you ask magic?
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino My mother and father.
@SabinaSweet16 @FoxNews @dbongino Explain how the universe existing is evidence of a lord, please.
@FoxNews Change isn’t always an improvement.
@FoxNews @dbongino First, I’ll need to see some evidence of this lord you speak of.
@m_pana I’m all for the 2nd, but also the 1st.  If you want to defend one, you gotta defend them all.
Why is it that so many #2ndAmendmentRights advocates love to ignore the #1stAmendment?
While I wait for my son in this high school parking lot, I hear a lot of immature students talking.  Most of the adults I work with talk exactly the same.
Me every time I get on #Snapchat: See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.  See less like this.
This standby time would be good for detailing my car.  I must remember the Q-Tips tomorrow.
@EdKrassen Well, they praise their Christian god who is also a murderer.  So, there's really nothing shocking there.

@FoxNews @Franklin_Graham Sins are nothing more than man made rules.
@realDonaldTrump Just when I start to like some of the decisions you make, you go and start on some petty shit like this.  Grow up, please.
I support the @NRA's main cause, but their opposition towards mental illness restrictions is incredibly irresponsible.
I’m not sure if it’s a good thing that I’m so busy I can’t really go through the Twitter timeline.  I need a break.
@GlockMagazine My first firearm.
@FoxNews Glad to see the baby is doing good.  Can a baby really be brave, though?
Those #thoughtsandprayers aren’t doing shit for these schools.
Just heard another Drake song that I wished would go off as soon as it came on.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Perhaps he should practice what he preaches.  Lots of negativity from @POTUS.
@JulieChen Same.
@FoxNews @WhiteHouse Gotta make it look like Trump and his administration is in the clear.
@realDonaldTrump To claim that God is the answer to anything is intellectual laziness.
So @realDonaldTrump took credit for the record breaking stock market.  Is he going to take the blame for the drop, or blame Democrats?
I’m pretty sure this @JackBox on Hwy 105 in #BeaumontTX has the most polite employees in town.
@FoxNews @Nigel_Farage @realDonaldTrump That’s great, but why does Trump always have to lie about so many things?  He could have made an equally good speech without throwing false information in.
@FoxNews If you look at the stock market, it’s been getting better for at least five years.  I’m pretty sure @realDonaldTrump wasn’t president five years ago.
@realDonaldTrump Such a pro-life person you are. Unless, of course, they’re children who’ve been born from another country.  Then they don’t matter to you.
How come @WindowsDefender finds a Trojan whenever I visit @YahooFinance desktop website?  Anyone else have that problem?
@shumer_lies @SpeakerRyan @POTUS Trump had the choice to approve.  He didn’t even though both parties came to an agreement.  The Wall was also in the agreement.
@1Kimsey Unacceptable only to one man?  This is not a dictatorship.
@HeavyMetalTeddy I’m really just tired of seeing NE win so much.
@SpeakerRyan Didn’t Reps and Dems come up with a compromise, and @POTUS turned it down?  How is this the fault of either side?  This is #TrumpsShutdown.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @POTUS Effective doesn’t necessarily mean beneficial though.
So if there’s a #GovtShutdown, I’ll be waiting for it to be over before I purchase anymore #stocks.  Seem like a good idea?
@FoxNews @michellemalkin @TheDemocrats I can’t help but think these three are very uncomfortable on that couch.  Shouldn’t they have something to lean back on?
@nytimes Wouldn’t that make the division worse if the users choose who’s trustworthy?  Why can’t people just do some research?
@ndrew_lawrence I can't say these questions haven't crossed my mind, and I certainly don't believe being against diversity is the same as white-supremacy.  I know that diversity has its pros and cons.
@MarketWatch And as soon as they level out, guess what time it is.
@TKless12News @12NewsNow If they merge Central and Ozen, I hope the relationship between the students of the two schools isn’t in the condition it was when I went to Ozen.  Pure hatred.
@msexcel Stocks and money management, home inventory, my son’s grades, and anything else I can think of for personal use.  I also use it at work.

@GLENNNBX I didn’t want to see it initially, but I ended up enjoying it.  Great cast.
I put “You Give Love A Bad Name” on my 8-year-old’s music player.  He’s listed to it at least 6 times in a row through headphones.  Which means he’s sing the words wrong loud as hell.
@12NewsNow And he may not be a racist, but he's definitely insensitive.  That's a characteristic that could easily be misinterpreted as racist in certain context.
I think I could make an @msexcel spreadsheet for everything in life. #desklife
@neiltyson @FOXTV @NatGeoChannel Hearing this news made my day, week, maybe month.
@FoxNews I hope people took the alert seriously for that 35 minutes.  It could have been real.
@mark_wahlberg Much respect to you.
Glad it’s a #falsealarm, but did people react as if it were real?  What if it were real and no one took it seriously?
@TulsiGabbard @RodneyDavis Glad it’s a false alarm, but did people react as if it were real?  What if it was real and no one took it seriously?
Peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich is one of my favorite #midnightsnacks.
I don't understand why purchasing a house is so fucking complicated...I want to give you money each month for a long ass time.  You give me the house.  So not only do they make a killing of interest, they also, for unknown reasons, make me feel like I'm purchasing a nation.
@12NewsNow Nothing surprises me about our incompetent president anymore.
@noespanoltrick @politico Sorry to hear that.  I’d be torn if I were in that situation.  Not sure what I’d do.
@realJohn_Wesley @ColumbianPost @RichardBSpencer I’m behind you on this one.
@GraellsiaMoon I’ve seen them both occupy the same Hot Pocket.  There was possibly a nuclear reaction somewhere in there.
@ILOVERAFA1 @politico True.  I try to at least put myself in her shoes.  He may actually be a good father to her.
Ending the day with a Hot Pocket. Hopeful that I will avoid 3rd degree burns.
@politico It’s not like she chose to be Trump’s daughter.
How do we know the @SpaceX rocket failed.  Maybe that's what they want us to think.  I'm on to you, @elonmusk.
There should be a national #positivenews day every month.  N negative news allowed for 24 hours.  Although, some people would argue about what could be considered good/bad news.
If there is just one thing I want to happen more than anything else, it’s to see my kids grow into adults.  Nothing else matters if I can just be a witness to that before I’m gone.
Hopefully my 15 year old son will grow into a critical thinking phase and realize how unnecessary #religion is...I remember those days of ignorance.  I thought I knew everything.  Knowing that there is so much to learn makes life so much more exciting.
Nothing against @Oprah, but I'm not sure she'd be my first choice for president.
@FoxNews @POTUS Gotta get through the bragging first.
Folks are calling #ElizabethMoss a hypocrite and her religion a cult...Every religion is a cult, and I'm pretty sure #Scientology isn't the only one with followers accused of sexual crimes.  Where's the anger towards those?
@kfdmnews @ChrisMullooly Is it certain that the owners put up the signs?
@nytopinion @CharlesMBlow Sounds like something you do for a spoiled brat.
When #Dems and #Reps fight unnecessarily, it's similar to a divorced couple fighting. Only the kids can lose.  In this case, the People.

I just started investing in the #StockMarket and, I can't stop looking up quotes and watching the timeline.
@FoxNews Good. Everyone needs to be investigated these days. No one should get a free pass.
I have to say @PressSec does describe my feelings on this book.  I don't care about it at all, and I don't care what's in it.  However, I do think it's extremely important how @POTUS reacts to it if there's no truth to it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @OnionPolitics Anytime I read about clickbait, I’m reminded of @SarahPalinUSA’s tweets.

@m_pana Since when did Putin dye his hair green and style it like a punk rocker?
@CBSNews By his logic, our next record breaking heat wave will change his mind again.
The world should have a digital credit system instead of a monetary system. I suppose that would be similar to #cryptocurrency.  The value of 1 credit would never change, though.
@Tejas_Marine @realJohn_Wesley Even if that is a white power symbol, where’s the harm?  He’s white and glad to be white.  Move on.
@EdKrassen I’d say not caring about science is worse than denying it.  When denying, at least you can say you’re doing what you THINK is right.
@AnnCoulter This is one of the very few subjects I agree with #Trump on. The lottery is a terrible idea.
@CNN The sorrow I feel for her is immeasurable. To know only fear and pain, I can’t imagine. Her parents deserve an eye for an eye.
I suppose it’s time I follow @WarrenBuffett now that I’ve decided to delve into the #StockMarket.
As a child, I was shocked when there was a mass murder on a holiday or large gathering.  As an adult, I'm surprised there hasn't been a mass murder after a month has gone by since a mass murder.

@TomiLahren I don't think there is a such thing as limited government.  Not with a two-party system anyway.
The #faithhealers are probably #Atheists who know how gullible the religious can be. The idiots are not the faith healers. The idiots are those who believe the faith healers.
@GraellsiaMoon I’m hearing some being set off right now.

Peculiar that money is the root of all evil, and we spend boatloads of it at #Christmas.

@JulieChen This is awkwardly cute.
@CBSNews Why not just execute him? How can someone be rehabilitated from doing something like that? Too far gone.
@FoxNews @David_Bossie @POTUS Most people don’t own a business.  Trickle-down doesn’t work.  The tax cuts for them just means bigger bonuses.  I hope I’m wrong, but I don’t see why we should trust business owners to get more money to the middle class.

On another note and as an Atheist, it’s alienating when government wants to include faith in God in so much.
@HunterSprinkle1 @FoxNews @ffweekend @SheriffClarke @POTUS From what I’ve seen recently, I feel that Republicans aren’t trying to hard to preserve the rights of anyone besides white Christians. As far as Democrats, I can never really tell what they’re trying to do.
@HunterSprinkle1 @FoxNews @ffweekend @SheriffClarke @POTUS What does that have to do with my comment?

@ChadJenLivings1 @BreitbartNews What’s the basis for anything you just said?
@ChadJenLivings1 @BreitbartNews Well I’m sorry that me pointing out a fact was disrespectful to you in some way.
@ChadJenLivings1 @BreitbartNews It's that type of response that makes me lose respect for Republicans.
@echas3wi @ChadJenLivings1 @BreitbartNews I really do agree.  I believe in our rights.  But I find that many Republicans will defend someone in their party even if they’re clearly guilty.  And I’m not saying Flynn is guilty of everything he’s being accused of.
@echas3wi @ChadJenLivings1 @BreitbartNews He just may.  But if he turns out to be a criminal, will you still defend him?
@BreitbartNews Obama warned Trump about Flynn.  What did Trump do?  He hired Flynn.
@FFRF Why don’t they compare Moore with someone we know existed?
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker That’s uplifting.
@12NewsNow @YouTube I love the cold weather.
@coreybrooks34 Absolutely. It does feel good to make someone feel good.
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker Improvement is all I’m really asking for. What good are food stamps if the food just helps put that person in the hospital?
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker That should be changed in my opinion. Some kind of program could be created to separate the good from the bad.
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker But if you can afford tobacco product, you don’t need the food stamps as bad as you may think.
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker I didn’t say test for lung cancer. How about only allowing food stamps to purchase health foods?
@TheeJohnnyquest @FoxNews @ScottWalker But it’s a waste of tax payer money of food stamps help support the habit.
@deer_on_campus @CNN You believing something is true doesn’t make it true.  There can’t be one answer for every context of truth.
@FoxNews @ScottWalker I think that’s a great idea. It should also test for nicotine in their system.
@deer_on_campus @CNN Truth in what context?
@deer_on_campus @CNN And you’re right, they don’t really matter.  But remember, you asked for my opinion.
@deer_on_campus @CNN I live by my morals, not his.  Just to clear that up.
@deer_on_campus @CNN They may not matter to someone else, but they matter to me, because I live by them.
@deer_on_campus @CNN I’m not sure how you get that idea. I’ve never mentioned any sort of dictatorship.
@deer_on_campus @CNN No.  You said universal. That would mean a moral code that everyone follows. I’m explaining my own moral code that I follow.
@deer_on_campus @CNN What you and I are discussing has no correlation with any god.
@deer_on_campus @CNN I am the judge. I decide what I think is good or bad. It’s not necessarily unexplainable. It depends on how and where a person was raised.
@deer_on_campus @CNN You asked what I believe. I’m not saying the world should believe it...Also, divine just means having to do with god.
@deer_on_campus @CNN Morals are just our views towards actions we take. They have nothing to do with divinity.
@EdKrassen I believe they lost their integrity when they picked Trump.
@deer_on_campus @CNN That’s debatable, and a very good question. I won’t pretend to know if there’s an answer to that.  What I am pretty sure of, though, is that if we are all considerate of one another, the world would be a more pleasant place to live.
@deer_on_campus @CNN It’s not ok if you cause harm to another person. Any culture that thinks rape is ok is a flawed culture. Something being labeled a culture doesn’t mean they have no flaws.
@deer_on_campus @CNN Finding your purpose doesn’t mean that purpose is inherently good.
@deer_on_campus @CNN I accept that they made that choice.  That doesn’t mean I have to allow it to happen.  Self preservation is of the highest importance.
@deer_on_campus @CNN I give my life purpose because I choose to. There is no meaning to life until you make your life mean something.
@deer_on_campus @CNN There’s no need to believe in any higher power at all.
@deer_on_campus @CNN It means I believe in no divine higher power.  That’s all it means.
@deer_on_campus @CNN It’s apparent that you don’t know what being an atheist means. So, why would I engage in your argument?
@deer_on_campus @CNN Ok dude.
@CNN I guess if it helps him cope.
The #RNC boasts that it raises much more money than the #DNC through donations. Isn’t that some proof that their political strategy looks out for the wealthy? The rich will obviously donate to the party that benefits them.
The sound that’s made when a #dog is eating a whole apple is satisfying.
@AlexAanselm06 @tedcruz I think the average here in Texas is in the 40Ks.  In my opinion, that's not near enough for giving an education to our future generations.  To solve the union problem, guidelines should be more strict so that only the best teachers are hired.  Just a thought.
@tedcruz Why not just make public school better? Pay those teachers more money so they feel appreciated.
I was watching my youngest son glare at the tree and presents this morning, and began thinking about the memory I would hold from that moment that’s far more valuable than anything anyone could put under that tree. The happiness of my children is priceless.

@seanspicer @ABC @BrianRoss It’s a good thing @realDonaldTrump isn’t a news reporter.  He’d get suspended repeatedly for false claims.
@pleu711 @FoxNews At least run over it with the van so the tires take some of it with her lol
@ArkansaSEC73 @nytimes Trump specifically said he fired Flynn for lying to Pence and the FBI.
@lynne_colcombe @nytimes It does.  Correct me if I'm wrong or misunderstanding what he said.
@nytimes So he fired Flynn for breaking the law. Then, he tried to get the investigation dropped even though he knew Flynn broke the law...I’m certainly not an expert on how the justice system works (not even close), but isn’t that obstruction of justice?
@FoxNews I can kind of understand the first incident.  Maybe she just absolutely could not wait any longer and didn't want to explode in her pants.
@TomiLahren @WattersWorld @jessebwatters You guys going to be explaining that tax bill in your own words?  Just asking.
@BillOReilly What news organization are you referring to?  I watched plenty of coverage yesterday on the verdict.  One news outlet avoiding coverage doesn't mean all news outlets are avoiding coverage.

@NambiaCovfefe @TIME Fake News Flakey Flynn.
@TIME Trump's next tweet will be "He's lying about whatever he says! Fake News Flynn!"
Flynn must have been pretty close to Trump.  How else would Trump know that Flynn is a "good guy?" #Flynn #RussiaGate

@politico There are a lot of things Trump doesn't know.
@MooreSenate @jimmykimmel Christian values include bigotry and hate. It deserves to be mocked.  Religion is not responsible for the good morals of a person.

@CNN Truth is not a Trump priority.  He only obsesses over his image and ratings. Republicans could have elected someone so much better.
@CBSNews As a white boy, I take no offense to some blabbering idiot. Besides, wolves are pretty.
@AMANDAZUCKERMAN @AndyHerren Some people just love to be offended so they can insult and feel self-righteous.

@FoxNews @brookefoxnews Doesn't seem right to me that only one side can be questioned.
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Another one on Fox News who doesn’t know all the details.
@FoxNews @dbongino So then why do conservatives seem to throw around insults the quickest?
@FoxNews @dbongino Such hyperbole.  I agree that it’s appalling, but intergalactic?
@FoxNews @CortesSteve I don’t think Trump would win against anyone. There would be record turnout for anyone against him.
Two hours after lunch, and somehow I’m still full.  Perhaps it was the giant cornbread and pumpkin pie that was included.  Oh well, it’s #gymtime.
@realJohn_Wesley Of all the things I disagree with you on, this is not one of them. I can relate to white pride always being considered racism. I’ve dealt with it quite a few times in my life.
@AlyMckntsh @PureGymEK Throw a couple high-quality protein shakes in there.
@FoxNews @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump lol You’re entitled to an opinion, but this makes me question your intelligence.
In that @Dodge commercial, Vin Diesel needs to clear his throat. I don’t even notice the vehicles in the ad. Are there any? I can only see phlegm.
@funder Even if 17 of them are lying, which I doubt, that 1 should be enough.
#Fastfood should be illegal.  Medical bills would drop in general.

@realDonaldTrump When you say "Fake News," I just assume it's a story where you fucked up and are embarrassed about it.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You only say that because @FoxNews doesn't inform the public of the BS you pull.
@CNN Lines are WAY shorter and WAY more safe.
@washingtonpost How does that attack even compare to the Mexico border wall?  How is this guy still president?
@queendanibbott That one with the water on the side.
@EvelDick I'm excited to see how they act when not scripted.  If the game isn't scripted, I mean.
@WESH @EvelDick You should never disturb a tree while it's having sex.
@CBSNews Well, it's not like God hasn't killed someone for his entertainment before.
@MonteJr5 lol What's the deal with people hating on Nickelback?

@realDonaldTrump LOL ok, Don.
@FoxNews Why the hell do we need people getting drunk on another planet where even the smallest mistake could kill everyone?
@realDonaldTrump What’s up with you and your obsession with ratings?
It’s as if @CBS is rubbing it in my face that I can’t use Live TV when they continue to suggest that I stream this or that on Live TV.
Sure would be nice to use the Live TV feature of my @CBS subscription that still isn’t available. I could understand if I lived in the wilderness.
Does @intel and @AMD understand that it’s ok if they can’t make CPUs ultra small? If they were the size of a calculator, I’d still buy them.
@kfdmnews Can’t even describe the sorrow I feel for this family. I hope they can find peace.	And I hope the killer finds a slow, painful death.
I’d like to have a favorite team, but I see no reason to like one better than the other. Maybe if I gained something from a win.
I like #football, but I have no favorite team.

Even with all the negative news in the media, I’m still #thankful to be in the #USA.  #HappyThanksgiving2017
@neiltyson @Macys Yeah but how would you air up a balloon that small?
@IJCFilm @politico I thought maybe there was something different the second and third time. I’ve lost count now, and it’s the same thing. They must really want their followers to see this.
@DylanByers I did the same thing not too long ago. Sounded much better in my head since I’m the only one who knew what I was trying to say. I learned two things: Wording matters tremendously, and people love to make others look bad so they can insult them to make themselves look righteous.
@CNN Personally, I would have thanked Trump while being anti-Trump. All that political feuding nonsense goes out the window when it comes to my kids.
@FoxNews People keep forgetting to include the phrase “cost efficient” when they mention the border wall. How will it be paid for, and will it be worth the money?
@EvelDick The air quality in that area must be awful.
@FoxNews @AlanDersh So if the “dominoes” are innocent, they’ll remain standing. Right? Why are they so afraid of Mueller if there are no wrong doings?  Are they ok with the corruption that may be in their party?
@DonaldJTrumpJr The left!?  Where the F*** are you at?  You’re really blaming one political party?
@seanspicer @TheDemocrats @WashTimes @GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump Well, doesn't the RNC get support from the wealthiest since they support the wealthiest first?
@JunDishes Once for all reasons, or once for each individually?
#GoodMorningWorld. Time for some #coffee. I'll never use anything other than the French Press again.
I’d like to play a game of @Hasbro #Operation that gives a painful shock when you touch the edge.
Oh man not #CharlieRose!  When will it end?
I've started to wonder if #Democrats and #Republicans are competing to see who can get the most #sexualassault claims against the other.
@ILissaJackson @4everNeverTrump @tedlieu Even Trump called his followers foolish.  That he could shoot someone in the street and not lose a single supporter.
Occasionally, my #iPhone will register my tough just before I make contact with the screen.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Trump is the Presidential Fool of the United States.
@tedlieu I’m sure Trump secretly obsesses over every negative comment about him.
@JudgeJeanine I’m going to assume this is based on looks alone.
@FoxNews @RedPillBlack @Kaepernick7 @GQMagazine @WattersWorld Still this? It wasn’t about the flag.  I thought you guys were smart.  Why are you making more money than me?
My wife will be freezing and under a blanket while I’m shirtless and sitting under the a/c vent.  Someone help me make sense of this.
@realDonaldTrump You are the best president we’ve ever had...at acting like a child.
@washingtonpost @paulwaldman1 Good read.
@TomiLahren WTF are you talking about?  It’s the majority of what I’ve seen everywhere for the last two days.
@gillin_denise @OSHA_DOL Nothing against them, I guess.  It just seems like they’re a mythical creature.
I’ve worked in the construction industry for over a decade, and I’ve heard about #OSHA regulations everyday. Not once have I seen an @OSHA_DOL representative. I have seen a lot of repeated “violations” though.
@realJohn_Wesley While I disagree with his political views, I don’t think it’s right that he’s being found guilty by the media. Democrats think I’m against the accusers when I express that.
@realJohn_Wesley What’s the significance of the signature anyway? Did Moore claim he doesn’t know her?
@washingtonpost And it was funny, too.
@Corrynmb @realJohn_Wesley No different than Republicans.  America needs more than a two-party system.
@ExtremeTech When can I buy one?
@MSNBC Good to see that they’re humans with a sense of humor.
@FoxNews @taylorswift13 @FoxBusiness Dayum!
@FoxNews @Rosie @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Nothing else to fill your time with?  Who cares about Rosie O’Donnell?
@TomiLahren Tomi can give great points.  Then she ruins them by insisting that Republicans don't make the same stupid mistakes that Democrats make.  Why does she think so strongly that Republicans are flawless?
Many #Republicans probably want to condemn @MooreSenate, but they don't since that would mean they also have to condemn @realDonaldTrump.

@thejessicagraf @codythemarine Well, you were beastish as a HouseGuest.  That's one thing at least.
@12NewsNow Hey guys.  You can go ahead and spell out the word.  Twitter is not very kid friendly anyway.
@RatliffAudra @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS It's not a question of if he love the country. I agree it needed to be done differently than usual, but I won't agree with just any different way.	I respect Republicans.  I don't respect that Republican.  I don't even consider him a Republican.
@RatliffAudra @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS I didn't want Hillary either.  Personally, I was hoping for Rubio.		As far as Obama being a liar, you can't tell me that Trump is not. He's making a mockery out of his position. My 8 year old twins act more mature than him.
@RatliffAudra @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS Obama composed himself in a professional manner also.  Trump condoning violence at his rallies didn't help anything.		I'm really not against the policies that Trump is implementing.  I'm against who the Republicans chose to do the job. Such a huge selection, and the elected him.
@RatliffAudra @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS Obama also didn't call the media the enemy. He also didn't act like a child. They can absolutely be compared.		I don't understand the devotion to Trump.  Republicans being anti-Trump are not betraying their party.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS And this is exactly what Republicans did to Obama during his terms.
@CBSNews Probably the most intelligent pope to ever walk the planet.
@FoxNews Jesus is against public prayer so...
@CNN Can we just perform the damn polygraph and get this all cleared up?
@SpeakerRyan Hey, man.  How are you tweeting and making this presentation at the same time?  Hmmm.  I don't think that's really you making that presentation.  I'm on to you, dude.
@SethAbramson @GraellsiaMoon They've probably been paid off already.
@shootamcg @washingtonpost I see your point.  Wouldn't you want Hitler to be verified, though?  I know it's a boost to their ego, but that's not really what it's intended for.
@washingtonpost Isn't it a good thing that people can positively identify who he is?  I say put the check mark back.
@FoxNews You'd think all these men would have gotten to their position partly due to good home training. They shouldn't be 40+ years old only to finally learn that this isn't right.
@gillin_denise @nytimes Not health for some humans. Fortunately, I still digest it properly.  Why do you think it’s cruel to the animal?
@FoxNews @RepSeanDuffy The dossier will be what I focus on tomorrow, because I don’t have a clue what the story is about.
@ClockworkHeart I see @realDonaldTrump is still verified. He promotes hate and incites harassment once every other day.
@_JuanRodriguez_ With the cheese filled crust...and I just began to starve.
@OleVetUSAF @NoFascistLies @Paul_Bornowski @stacysep6stacy @KimSalsman Just make sure the Trump speech wasn’t written by someone else.
@nytimes Rarely do I let any of my kids drink soda anymore.  Water, milk, and maybe some semi-sweet tea is fine with them.
@nytimes @kevinbacon Everyone else will soon be using wind and solar energy while we continue to burn fossil fuels.  It’s all about the money.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @POTUS Pretty sure Japan is an ally.  Bowing is the equivalent to a handshake here.  It was disrespectful.  Why get an A for that?
@GymStimulus @MonteJr5 Hell yeah.  I plan on building a gym room onto my house...When I finally own a house.
@politico Ineffective on foreign policy?  Are they supposed to be in control of foreign policy?  Serious question.
@ConanOBrien Did you ask him?
@washingtonpost Shouldn't be a problem. One man defends pedophilia.  The other gives facts even if it may go against what people WANT to believe is true. The solution is obvious.
@EdKrassen Maybe, but I'm not going to get my hopes up.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Of course he knows.  Kim is just running his mouth.  Similar to Donald Trump.
Pretty sad when people want you fired for producing facts.  Respect to #ShepardSmith for not being afraid.
@JanaBanana1217 @ThePerfectFoods @FoxNews Sometimes you have to say, "Well, maybe I was wrong."
@m_pana @realDonaldTrump Really I don't have much to say about his policies.  I understand he can't make everyone happy.  It's his rhetoric that's got me anti-Trump.  He can't help but lie about things that aren't even important.
@StarTalkRadio @neiltyson Cosmos is the best series I've ever watched.  You've got my hopes up now.
@m_pana When @realDonaldTrump insults CNN, you can bet it's because he's ashamed of a truth they reported about him.
I'm usually against insulting a person over a disagreement.  However, when that person refuses to accept facts looking them in the face, they deserve to have their feelings hurt. #FactsFirst #Debate
@realDonaldTrump @CNN Someone needs to inform Trump that children keep hacking his account.  It's a daily occurrence.
There is no meaning to life until you give your life meaning.
I got the hair on this head down to the bottom of my eyeballs now.  That's the longest it has been in about 16 years.  Why stop now?
@JunDishes Nah.  That’s what kids are for.  I feel no pain.
I feel like Sessions is sacrificing his integrity to shield the Trump administration.  They're wrong for allowing him to take the bashing. #SessionsHearing
While I watch the #SessionsHearing, I'll also be on the lookout for people falling asleep in the background.

@aubrey_huff @keithlaw @stretmediq @chadk21 @DamonSantore So, you don’t believe in evolution because you say there is no evidence to prove it, yet you have a religious faith.  Faith literally means belief without evidence.

@ViLife101 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Because of the Mary and Joseph story? I don’t get what you mean.
@AdrielChaney My apologies.  It’s difficult to read your tone through text.  I believe the same is true for you.  What exactly would you like to know.  I’m all ears as well as an open book.
@realDonaldTrump A good relationship with Russia would be a great thing if they weren’t trying to undermine our government.  I don’t think you’ve been briefed.
@AdrielChaney Right. I don’t like new country because of race.  Got it.
@realDonaldTrump Dude, just stay there. K? We're good.
@EdKrassen I'm thinking the same thing.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer You know what, though? He will never stop getting flack from those who think he's guilty. In a way, he'll pay for his mistakes.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Maybe he will come to his senses and drop out.
@JaredJG1 @CNN Ok...I absolutely do not agree with Trump believing Putin.  However, the next step for Trump would be to at least explain himself.  Don't just leave it at "I believe him."
@JaredJG1 @CNN You're not making any sense.  Did you not see the sarcasm in my reply?  And you call me dense.
@JaredJG1 @CNN No clue why you're talking about that.  I'm looking for Trump to give an explanation as to why he believes Putin.  No good reason that I can see.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer It doesn't help that Moore believes a person cannot have good morals without faith.  Someone who thinks that way should not be in any government position.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer It's the double standards of Christianity that I don't like.		Also, there's nothing I respect more than someone who will apologize for being wrong.  I also apologize for being abrasive.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Moore supporters are using the story of Mary and Joseph to defend Moore because Mary was 12-14.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Try to understand what you're reading before attacking someone who feels the same way about Moore as you do.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Explain how I'm defending a pedophile.  Also, you're right.  She was a virgin according to one translation.  Other languages say she was "of age."  This would also mean your god is the pedophile.  Your religion.  Not mine.
@WillyThedog2 @Kodie2038Donna @CNN @edstetzer Absolutely nothing.  I didn't molest anyone.
@12NewsNow Damn.  Really?  When does it end?  Can we just get a list from Hollywood who are NOT sexual predators?
@CNN Ok you know what? That's fine. Trump believes him. But why? Just because he denied it? Is Trump going to explain why he believes Putin's word?
Twitter should also have a dislike button.
@CNN @edstetzer Why should this provoke anger?  It's not a lie as far as the story goes.  Don't Christians know that?
I wonder how things would be different if I would have been able to join the #military.  Recruiters from all branches said my pre-existing injury disqualified me.
@FFRF People aren’t accepting default explanations anymore.  Not as many people at least.
No more back &amp; shoulders workout.  By the end, I’m too exhausted to finish the last exercises.  I’ll squeeze shoulders in with chest and workout the back on a day to itself. #gymlife
@akenchilada @FoxNews How you misread what I said is beyond me. Where did I say masculinity is wrong?
@LovAndPeaches @SenJohnMcCain Don't be an asshole.
@CNN I'm highly critical of Donald Trump, but no way do I think he WANTS a nuclear war.
@akenchilada @FoxNews It's only an observation that I've come to see after years of working with "macho" dudes.  They try their hardest to prove their masculinity, and for what reason, I don't know...I consider the alien and Sheldon comparison a compliment.
@AnnaJussme @emilykat65 @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Sorry. Twitter is not showing me what you are replying to, but I'm pretty sure I agree with this reply.
@akenchilada @FoxNews Why the hostility?
@CBSNews Cool.  He said he didn’t do it, guys.  Investigation is over.
@AdrielChaney It has nothing to do with race. I feel just as strongly about new country music.  I want to leave the room when my wife listens to it.
@brady62 @FoxNews Exactly.
@AdrielChaney This current stuff is all about image and glamour.  I don’t even know if they’re writing their own music and lyrics anymore.  Everything seems so generic.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice Sure did.  I’ll be reading up on that tomorrow.
@FoxNews @LeslieMarshall @JoeBiden @POTUS Try not to think.
@FoxNews Yeah, but you guys are ok with sexual assault, right.  Remember the Moore thing?
@FoxNews @TheDCVince I don’t know anyone looking for a job.  This news outlet seems to always be excessively talking about what they say Democrats are excessively talking about.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice And they told Trump today (or yesterday) that there is plenty of room for China and the U.S.  They're playing Trump.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice China is even building islands.  ISLANDS!
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice I rarely change my radio station from them.  Always a variety of stories.
@NatashaBertrand @GraellsiaMoon @EagleEdMartin Does she know who our president is?
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice I love listening to NPR in the mornings, or anytime of day for that matter.  What do you think of them?
Opening a dishwasher before it has completed its cycle even for a few seconds should be punishable by law.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice How do you know what to believe?  There's so much contradictions and bias everywhere I look.  That's why I ask questions and why I'm skeptical of pretty everything I see.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice I've only recently started following politics.  Recently meaning about 5 or 6 years.  It didn't interest me until then.  I try to educate myself when I have time, but I stay pretty busy.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice Of course.  They'd loose some of their grip.  It's not about morals.  It's about power.
@JimCarrey His bigotry over the last 200 years he's been alive has made him unsuitable.
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth Same here.  I noticed over the last day and a half that both parties can equally lack civility.
@WhalenBeth @cosmicspice I should have been more sensitive to the issue.
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth Take Moore, for example.  His supporters are making excuses for him.  Many say they wouldn't change their vote even if he was guilty.  If it were a Democrat, though...
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth They're angry until someone they've been supporting is accused of it.  It's all excuses after that.
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth I appreciate the hugs, but I think the angry ones need them more.
@AdrielChaney I actually sat in my car for about five minutes asking myself this question after hearing it from a nearby vehicle.  Older hiphop doesn't bother me, but the new stuff...
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth Trust me, I've already asked myself that.  It was a learning experience.  However, the hostility was surprising over a simple question.
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth I really do see your point, but not everyone misunderstood it the way you and others did. I'm pretty convinced Moore is guilty of what he was accused of.  All anyone had to do was ask me to elaborate.
I'm still not brave enough to hit the #gym in a tank-top.
@cosmicspice @WhalenBeth I'm curious as to why you think it's a good thing this happens.  What happened to peace?
@FoxNews I’ve noticed that men seem to do things just to prove they are men.  As if it’s too difficult to look at them and see that they are a man.
@WhalenBeth @BillOReilly @MooreSenate @BetsyDeVosED Funny you say that.  I saw the coverage of that less than an hour ago.  Their existence doesn’t benefit our country.  Sorry if I’m a bit harsh.
@nprpolitics Sexual misconduct according to who?  I don’t think it means what you think it means, Moore.
@WhalenBeth @BillOReilly @MooreSenate @BetsyDeVosED I’m on the same page.  I’m in total disbelief when they’re even slightly critical of a Republican.
I’m gonna assume the #gym is empty because everyone is at #MidCountyMadness.
@WhalenBeth I do, and thank you.  However, it says a lot about the people in this country when they respond in such a way that they did.  Such disrespect.  They could have just asked me.
@WhalenBeth @BillOReilly @MooreSenate @BetsyDeVosED I honestly haven’t watched much Hanity.  I hear he’s more of the same.
@AdrielChaney @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain If there was a second article, I never saw it.  You’re assuming again.  It’s ok to ask questions and be polite.  You’re part of the problem.
@WhalenBeth @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Did you know that Twitter is a social platform?  Questions are allowed.
@WhalenBeth @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Says the person who doesn't realize I can't stand Moore.  Do your own research on the person you're replying to.
@AdrielChaney @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain First, I replied yesterday after first hearing the story.  Second, it was a single article I read.  Finally, logic suggest I look for at least something other than one article.  You jump to conclusions that quickly?
@WhalenBeth @SenJohnMcCain Hell yeah.  I'm highly privileged.  I love my life.
@flyytwin2 @SenJohnMcCain Yeah, but then I hear some have lied about similar things in the past.  Things I've heard Moore say since I posted this reply are quite incriminating, though.
@AdrielChaney @SenJohnMcCain Ok great.  Where are you getting that info?  More than one article I hope.  That why I asked for something else.  Don't assume I don't believe the accusers.
@shenandoah34 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Please read the previous replies.  Thanks.
@Nesting4Awhile @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I'm sure I've misspelled a few things.
@Nesting4Awhile @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I was pointing out the he said, she said factor.  I'm leaning towards the women really.  I was just looking for more than accusations.  I saw the corroboration in a single article.
@SheilaToomey @crushedatoma @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I made the original reply yesterday.  People are going nuts over it.
@SheilaToomey @crushedatoma @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain There was originally an article posted.  That's why I was asking for something else to go along with it.  Not sure why it disappeared.
@TomCunning3 @SenJohnMcCain I'm down with that.  I don't think those hold up in court, though.
@2irish2Cj @SenJohnMcCain Thank you.  I should have worded my reply differently, though.
@Faithhillfan1 @SenJohnMcCain I've caught up now.  Thanks.
@usedtobeafreer5 @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain There actually was an article originally.  Not sure why it disappeared.
@LowRentRat @SenJohnMcCain I have no clue about the other three.  I won't pretend to know.  This was only about me asking for actual proof that Moore was guilty.  One article isn't enough for me to make my mind up entirely even though I lean towards believing the women.
@LowRentRat @SenJohnMcCain Where is Spacey, Cosby, and Weinstein coming from.  You're on the wrong thread...and what political party do you think I belong to?
@LowRentRat @SenJohnMcCain I only asked for proof.  I clearly said I'm not defending that ass-hat Moore.  The women are probably being truthful, but I'm looking for more than just a single article.
@LowRentRat @SenJohnMcCain This reply is irrelevant.
@kmmeske @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Since you're a clairvoyant, I suppose you don't need to read anything else I've posted to see that I'm anti-Moore.
@kmmeske @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain My first thought?  People are reading my mind now?  I believe Moore is a Creep.  I've never liked him.  I asked for proof.  These are accusations.
@JulieFreedom4 Good point.  Now is better than never, though.  It's disappointing.
@KarynIMorton @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Why are you assuming I don't believe them?  That being said, these are still only accusations.  I'm just looking for something more than an article.
@Elateluckygirl @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You're making unnecessary assumptions now.
@Elateluckygirl @SenJohnMcCain I'd believe her if she were my daughter.  This is decades after the fact.  I never said I think they're lying.
I have most definitely learned the importance of wording a comment properly.  People love to assume.
@KimberlyMorning @Okinawamary1 @JulieFreedom4 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain @GloriaAllred Chill, peeps.  I was only asking for something more than what was provided at the time.  No need for everyone to get nasty.
@gnakcan @SenJohnMcCain I agree.  I believe they're telling the truth.  I was just asking of there was more than this.
@lynnroe52 @SenJohnMcCain I agree.  I don't like him at all.  I'm just looking for more than one article.
@SiteNook @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Read my tweets and replies from before this one and you'll know exactly how I feel about Moore.
@SiteNook @SenJohnMcCain No and no.
@lynnroe52 @SenJohnMcCain Twitter isn't telling me what anyone is replying to directly.  I didn't take offense to anything you said.
@Seigler126 @SenJohnMcCain Proof doesn't mean a confession.  Just anything more than this one article.  I'm not insinuating that the women are lying.
@notrollingover @SenJohnMcCain I read the article.  Take the time to read my extremely short question.
@IdaSantanaMD @SenJohnMcCain Why are you saying I don't believe them?  I simply asked for more.  I read one article.
@cosmicspice @SenJohnMcCain So this article is all you need to say he's guilty?  That's it?
@LakeJames2 @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Sounds like you just want to be the victim.  I don’t support either party.
@kaylynuke @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I’m actually supportive of McCain also.  People would know that if they would have been civil.
@KreyenbuKathryn @SenJohnMcCain I’m thinking the same thing of Trump.  He even admitted to things.
@kahuja79 @SenJohnMcCain Wrong thread.
@cosmicspice @SenJohnMcCain Please explain how I defended Moore.
@scongie @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I hope you’re not trying to persuade anyone like that.
@Aprilleahl @stupiho @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain How about I rephrase the question...Is this strongest evidence they have against Moore?
@Aprilleahl @stupiho @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Well, it is fun.  I enjoy the interaction even when we don't agree.  I don't care if you're paid or not.  That's your business.
@GraellsiaMoon @Aprilleahl @stupiho @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain He was on my side, so I kind of felt obligated to show my appreciation for the support.  Nothing against any of you, though.
@Aprilleahl @stupiho @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Go along with what?  Twitter is not showing what you are replying to.  I'm sure you're not being paid, but I think you misunderstood the point of my original reply.
@ImNatZS @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It could be politically fueled. That's never out of the realm of possiblities anymore.  I think he's guilty in some way, but I'm just looking for more.
@dannamli @SenJohnMcCain Faith is literally belief without evidence.  Where are you going with this?
@ElleBee617 @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain So you're saying this one article I read is proof?
@shirleybaez14 @SenJohnMcCain It's not obvious.  You're just reading it the way you want to read it so you won't be wrong.  If you read my comments in earlier days about Moore, you'd know I can't stand the guy.
@KenHedges @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I'll take blame for some of the confusion with my comment and the wording, but some go into an entirely different subject.  We should all just agree to disagree.
@dannamli @SenJohnMcCain I don't know if I'd call that solid, but definitely highly convincing.
@shirleybaez14 @SenJohnMcCain Like I've told others, I've read it.  Nowhere is there proof.  I clearly said I'm not defending him.  I just asked if there was proof.  Please explain how that is considered down playing.
@denali1223 @SenJohnMcCain I read it.  I asked for proof.  I never said they were lying.  Your implications are unecessary.
@p1aceboeffect @SenJohnMcCain It's highly entertaining.  I'm watching them argue amongst themselves mostly...I think it's good that people are being outed for their wrongs, but I just hope it doesn't get taken advantage of.  False accusations can still ruin a person's life.
@GraellsiaMoon @chirho1981 @maxandfriend17 Trump is so arrogant, though, I'd almost believe that he lied about doing it.  He should also be held to the same standard as all the others.
@GraellsiaMoon @chirho1981 @maxandfriend17 Man, I like Louis C.K. too.  Such a dissapointment.
@Aprilleahl @CentFL4Trump @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I can't name what would satisfy me.  I'm only looking for more.  It's that simple.
@Aprilleahl @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It's still a single article.  Folks would argue that the source isn't credible.  That would make the entire article irrelavant.  I made the original reply when I first heard about the accusations.  It was the only article I had seen on the matter.
@stupiho @GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain But it's so fun.
@Aprilleahl @CentFL4Trump @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I have no idea.  That's the point of my question.  I sided with no one.
@Aprilleahl @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I'm not going to accept one article as proof, which is all I asked for.  I don't know why you're reading so deep into my one question.
@Aprilleahl @CentFL4Trump @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You make a good point, and I agree.  I'm just looking for more.  Something a little more concrete.
@memphomofo @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I've seen this.  That's why I'd get satisfaction from seeing proof.
@GraellsiaMoon @Aprilleahl @notsosurenow1 @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Twitter is doing the same to me.  I've read it, and I think my reply was just taken out of context.  I believe we're on the same page now.
@carolyncowbofan @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It's all good.  I'm ignoring most pointless replies.
@Aprilleahl @notsosurenow1 @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You assume I didn't read while assuming that accusations are proof.  I read.  Please make a valid argument.
@Aprilleahl @CentFL4Trump @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I read.  You may have also, but you think accusations are proof.  There is no proof in the article.  Please read a few more times.
@CyndiLeeJ @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain The government should work the same way.  They argue and bicker like children.
@nancylees @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain True.  That is a long time to say something.  I guess we'll see.  I just like to see facts before I lean one way or the other.
@Aprilleahl @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I read the article.  There's no actual proof.  Only accusations.  He said, she said.  Don't get me wrong, I think he did these things.  I'm just looking for something solid.  Just for my own knowledge.
@Aprilleahl @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Why would you ask if I had ever heard of it?  What's the point of putting that into your reply?
@GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It's all good.  I've realized that my original reply is incorrectly worded, but all someone has to do is ask me what I think before assuming I think a certain way.  I'm just a fan of facts.  Even if they go against what I believe.
@1grn_eyez @SenJohnMcCain And it's happening all over now.  I just hope that doesn't cause it to become meaningless.  Know what I mean?
@GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Being in the same place doesn't show guilt, though.  I believe, like most other people, that he did this.  I'm simply looking for proof.
@GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain A simple "No.  There's not proof."  would have been fine with me.  You're way overreacting.
@1grn_eyez @SenJohnMcCain I have to disagree that his words mean more.  I don't think he'll be in office much longer.
@GraellsiaMoon @maxandfriend17 @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I didn't argue that there's no proof.  I asked if there was any proof.  In other words, I have not seen proof if there is proof.  Why is that so difficult?
@52Variables @SenJohnMcCain Please explain how you come to that conclusion.
@1grn_eyez @SenJohnMcCain What am I letting slide?  I asked if there was proof.  I didn't say there wasn't proof.  That's why I asked if there was proof.  Please ask questions before assuming.
@CyndiLeeJ @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I'm just wondering how much of all the trolls' valuable time I've taken.
@EssEppis @SenJohnMcCain Noted.
@islandertms @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Thanks.  I've decided to ignore the disrespectful replies.  They're entertainment now.
@CentFL4Trump @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It's probably true.  I've been shown an extreme lack of intelligence, and I have a feeling my IQ is higher than more people than I thought.
@GraellsiaMoon @CyndiLeeJ @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I've seen and read this.  It's only accusations.  All I asked was has it been proven?
@StateOUAll @MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain It's ok.  They're the ones looking like trash.  Trash is incapable of making a civilized statement.
@Roused_Rebel @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You may have read the article, but you don't even understand my original short reply.  I asked if it was proven.  Nowhere in the article was anything proven.  Please reply when you can make a valid point.
@GraellsiaMoon @natenicolesmith @TheActualTodd @patariski @MolassesBoy @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Thanks for contributing nothing to the conversation, Jeanine.
@herbertsfav @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Only heard about it this morning.  Not sure why people are getting so offended from me asking a question. Is that not allowed on Twitter?
@pizdapalace Interesting.  Thank you for your input.
@pizdapalace You thinks it’s just a move against the Trump administration?
@SenJohnMcCain Geez my first reply to this tweet got a lot of attention. I ask I one little question, and assholes come from all over with hurt feelings.  Thank you to the ones who replied in a civilized manner.
@ColWerk34 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain As always? Do I know you?
@GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Read it.  Nowhere is my question answered.  That’s why I asked.
@damandrews @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain And nowhere does it say he admitted or that there is proof.  Have you read my original comment?
@sk8aimeek @SenJohnMcCain This isn't about Spacey, and I was only asking a question.
@MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Oh trust me.  I've offended.  You wouldn't believe how people are flipping out over my comment.  It's almost funny.
@MolassesBoy @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain No way I'm taking days to read up on Moore.  I'm not sure how my simple question offended so many people.
@sk8aimeek @SenJohnMcCain Wow!  One more person making the assumption that I'm defending Moore when I clearly stated that I'm not defending Moore.
@shenandoah34 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I can do better?  I didn't say it.  Moore said it.
@smeagol6662001 @SenJohnMcCain There's no winning.  People will assume whatever they want to assume no matter what is said.  That's the downside of text.  I see your point, though.
@an_e_la Insults are easy.  Please make a valid argument.
@coolsport00 @SenJohnMcCain Dude, you wouldn't believe how people are flipping out over my question.  They automatically assume I'm on Moore's side.  It's crazy...and funny.
@coolsport00 @SenJohnMcCain They are if you know they're true.  Or if they're simply overwhelming.
@DebbieNunn1234 @stuartkmcnair @Notteham @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You're probably right.  But in politics, you never know what someone is being paid to do or say.
@pfawcett3535 @SenJohnMcCain I have no idea what they would do.  Money talks.  We all know that.  I only asked a question.  I didn't jump on either side.
@darkchocoIate @SenJohnMcCain That's why I made it a point to say I wasn't defending him.  I guess that wasn't enough.
@an_e_la @SenJohnMcCain You bet?  Why would you make that bet?
@DebbieNunn1234 @stuartkmcnair @Notteham @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain My original reply clearly says I'm not defending Moore.  I figured you had read it since you replied.
@Michael_Mcghee @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Weinstein admitted to accusations.  Not sure about Spacey.  I haven't followed that story.
@darkchocoIate @SenJohnMcCain You're right.  Thanks.  You wouldn't believe the amount of butt-hurt people that chime in on my simple question, though.
@jayemasi @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain What gives you the idea that I'm ok with it?  Your logic is terrible.
@damandrews @GraellsiaMoon @KimberlyMorning @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain This is one article.  And other articles are just more of the same.  Not avoiding.  You're assuming.
@politicalmablog @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain My response is the same for anyone accused.  Political party is irrelevant because I don't like either party.
@seattleh2ohhh @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I get your point.  Sorry I came off so abrasive, but you wouldn't believe how people are flipping out just because I asked a question.
@suzavala @pamelafwood @SenJohnMcCain Nowhere have I read that he has been charged.  That was the question.  I was asking if there was more than accusations.
@darkchocoIate @SenJohnMcCain No reason to get so defensive.  I asked a question.
@Sinny777 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Weinstein being guilty does not mean Moore is guilty.  Two totally different people.  I was only asking a question.
@Tchaikovsky08 @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You're assuming that I'm defending Roy Moore when I clearly said I'm not defending him.  I don't even like him.  I was only asking a question?
@TGICarolyn @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Alrighty.  And that's why I was asking.  I never sided with either.
@Hectoesme35 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain The burden of proof lies with the accuser.  Her story came first.
@BobJone02265760 @KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Because Hollywood is full of sexual accusations.  It's all over the news.
@Lordoflemmings @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain What gives you that idea?  You're making typical assumptions that if I'm critical of one party, I'm automatically part of the other.
@KaysGramma @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Just be cause they may be guilty doesn't mean everyone who is accused is also guilty.  I clearly stated that I'm not defending him.  I only asked a question.
@seattleh2ohhh @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Your best friend's dad is not Roy Moore.  I'm only asking for info.  I clearly stated that I'm not defending him.
@Deanna773 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Thanks.  I thought it was kind of early for anything more than that.
@BillFerris @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Didn't Harvey admit to things, though?  I haven't read into the Spacey cases.
@klrwriter @SenJohnMcCain Agreed.  I was just looking for more info on the story.  You wouldn't believe how people flip out over me asking a question.
@klrwriter @SenJohnMcCain You're probably right most of the time, but you have to admit there have to be women out there who will say things for money or other.
@newsthyme No reason to be an asshole.  I was only asking for information.  Your reply gives none.
@BobJone02265760 @KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain One being guilty doesn't make everyone guilty.  All I wanted was more info, and what I get is insults from people who assume they know me.
@prezperv @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain One being guilty doesn't make them all guilty.  I was only asking for more information.  Not defending either side.
@KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Loyalty?  What makes you think I care about being loyal to Moore.  I don't even like him.  You must think I'm a Republcian just because I didn't immediately jump on the bandwagon you're on.  I simply asked for more information.
@Ianbush02 @georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain I won't pretend to know the answer to that.  I was just asking for more info on the story.
@ponymule @SenJohnMcCain I didn't make a judgment.  That's why I was asking.  Your comment is hypocritical.
@mrclean5234 @KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @SenJohnMcCain Great point.  I'll agree with that.
@belleofchaos99 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr ooookkkkaaayyyy.  What does this have to do with anything?
@NicoletteDalto4 @looby757 @SenJohnMcCain I heard the audio tape of Harvey.  Pretty sick stuff.  Harve also admitted things.  It can't be compared to this.
@BobJone02265760 @KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain You're refering to the alligations in the entertainment business?  It has taught me that there's a lot we don't know about the people in Hollywood.
@Stirit_Rising21 @looby757 @SenJohnMcCain Yeah, possibly.  But I don't like to immediatly assume someone is guilty of anything.  I was only asking for more info.
@langosta1984 @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Good point.  That's new info to me.  Thanks for not flipping out like a lot of people are. lol
@klrwriter @SenJohnMcCain How does any experience teach you that a woman cannot lie about such things?  You can't possibly know that.
@mrclean5234 @DC_Cat4 @SenJohnMcCain I only saw the one.  I guess I'm way behind.
@KimberlyMorning @flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Well, he couldn't have been found guilty already.  So, yeah I'm looking for where he admits something.  Where were these women before?  Why show up now?
@georgeahoskins @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain Thank you.  That's the best answer I've been given.  In no way am I defending him.  I don't even like him, but I believe in fairness.
@DC_Cat4 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain My point is that it's her word against his.
@flashbangz89 @mrclean5234 @SenJohnMcCain They only say he was accused.  Unless I'm missing a particular story where he admitted it.
@klrwriter @SenJohnMcCain Nope.  I don't appreciate you insinuating that I'm defending him, though.
@looby757 @SenJohnMcCain Read the story.  He was accused.  Not found guilty.  Unless I missed something.
@SorrelOverton @x_WhySE @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr I advocated compromise and working together.  There was really nothing more to it until you assumed I was attacking constitutional rights.  You seem to be trained to be the victim.
@SorrelOverton @x_WhySE @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr I'm beginning to think you are a bot.  Your replies have no basis.
@SorrelOverton @x_WhySE @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr Please explain how I'm re-defining points.  I'll wait...
@CalebsPappaw @dayanarod5 @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr Sorry, @CalebsPappaw. Wasn't aimed toward you. I hate the way these replies and comments are organized.
Main reason why I'm not a #Dem or #Rep: The moment you see truth in the other side's ideas, the side you're on labels you a traitor.  I'm more adult than that.
@GasperiCaroline @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr They should be followed, then. They may as well not be there if they're not enforced.  I agree with you. Following procedure would stop at least some of the issues.
@JohnKasich Love this guy.  Great presidential material.
@dayanarod5 @CalebsPappaw @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr It's all good.  The replies get confusing for me too.  They seem to get highly disorganized...My point originally was that we only need gun regulations. Not a gun ban. I just don't understand why people are against going through a procedure to own a firearm.
@dayanarod5 @CalebsPappaw @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr You make a very good point.  But, if even one mass shooting in the last ten years could have been prevented by a gun law, don't you think it would be worth it?
@x_WhySE @SorrelOverton @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr That's what being narrowminded will do to a person.
@CalebsPappaw @dayanarod5 @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr Yes.  So since criminals will always break the law, let's just get rid of the laws.  That is what your logic suggests.
@SorrelOverton @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr YOU are deliberately trying to make this into something it's not.  YOU are the type of people I'm talking about.  YOU do nothing to help anything.
@SorrelOverton @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr "You people" as in the ones who think there's no middle ground such as yourself.  You are a prime example of who I'm talking about.
@SweethartPicker @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr Did you even read what you're replying to?
@mmacchiavello @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr Pride is getting in the way.  Politicians don't want to admit when they could benefit from listening to the other side.
@CalebsPappaw @dayanarod5 @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr That's why both parties need to work together to figure this out instead of fighting over who's right or wrong.  They're getting nowhere.
@dayanarod5 @CalebsPappaw @steg3n @FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr I think you're both right.  Stronger laws that are strictly enforced.  If you have good intentions and a clean background, you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
@rccola517 @hemantmehta @FFRF He should govern according to the law.  Not according to whatever religious book he bases his life on.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @AntonioSabatoJr They want gun control.  Not a gun ban.  This is like saying Republicans want to give everyone on the planet a gun.  There is a middle ground here.  You people just refuse to compromise on anything.
@rccola517 @hemantmehta @FFRF Absolutely not.  The factor would be whether or not he pushes his religious values on others.
@FoxNews @RepMcCaul Right, and he gives us his worse when he's here.  Such a leader.  High five.
@hemantmehta @FFRF Excellent news. No one should be afraid to announce a lack of believe, because it shouldn't be a factor.
@GinaMarieZ My views of the HGs always change throughout the show.  I try to put myself in their shoes, but there's really no way to understand unless you've been there.
@m_pana I'm not even sure what to think about this.
@TxDOT @TxDOTBeaumont The state should hire more police and troopers to patrol the roads.  Careless drivers cause most accidents driving like they're the only people on the road.  They'll keep doing it until they're forced to stop.  Plain and simple.
@CBSNews Isn’t it great how people assume they know everything going on in the lives of others?
@BBAnimals @Irenetheintern What are the requirements for raising one or two of these?
The #entertainment business is starting to resemble the #CatholicChurch.  Except the entertainment business isn’t protecting the offenders.
@realJohn_Wesley It’s fun.
@NoFascistLies I would support just about anyone against them.
@kfdmnews If he’s truly guilty, he’s no longer needed in this world.
@Robert32305 @BillOReilly @realDonaldTrump lol Just because she’s right doesn’t mean you’re wrong.
@m_pana @MicrosoftEdge It's hidden if it exists.  Maybe Chrome will be my new choice.
@m_pana @MicrosoftEdge Guaranteed to work, huh?
Any way to stop @MicrosoftEdge from auto-playing video?  It's a daily annoyance.
@BillOReilly @realDonaldTrump Absolutely.  They need to work together.  Make compromises.  No one is right or wrong all the time.
@russellhantz I think I like it. I usually only need a few characters over 140 anyway.
Hey @CBSThisMorning, that iPhone you just had on your show had over 4,000 unread emails.  How does that not bother you?
I’d likely be a #Republican if it weren’t for people like @BillOReilly, @MooreSenate, or @BetsyDeVosED. I feel like their bigotry infects the entire party. So many more like them, too.
@TechCrunch I already say that every ad is irrelevant.  Every single one.
@jeffgerstmann Is that a um......What is that?
@EdKrassen Simply because Obama had something to do with it.
@FoxNews I don’t think it’s only China.
@FoxNews @VP The prayers didn’t help after all the other mass murders. You don’t think maybe you should try something else?
I attended an elementary school play tonight.  Couldn’t help but think how screwed we would have been if a lunatic decided to open fire.  That’s where we live now.  A place where that’s a rational fear.
I’ve yet to see anyone politicize the #SoutherlandSprings tragedy as much as @TomiLahren.  She’s going way overboard...and I’m in favor of open carry.
Hey! Why the fuck can’t I tweet in 280 characters yet? Wait a minute...I think I can.  I don’t see a count. Just some circle being filled as I type. What’s my count at? I think I may have just went over 140. I did.  My tweet looks super long...That’s what she said.
I don’t know, man. If I were @POTUS, no way I’d be in nuking range of #NorthKorea. That’s just me.
@Irenetheintern Yes. Less shooting, and more...licking?
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke I’ve seen more from Reps talking about Dems politicizing the tragedy than I’ve seen Dems politicizing the tragedy. WAY more.
@seculardotorg What’s odd is that we’re not actually a group.  We’re the ones not in a group.
@mspears96 @ShellyMooreBB13 Definitely if my children count.
@AnnCoulter Both sides do the same thing.  They're all the same on a different side of the fence.
@m_pana I've seen it. They're probably getting millions of $ for the advertising.
@JOSHMBB19 Isn't that stuff actually healthy, though?
@danigittsx Damn.  What's a bad day like?
@SenSanders People think gun restriction means complete ban of guns.
Judging from his history, the #TexasChurch shooter was a complete asshole way before his last day.
@Nibbitz @FoxNews Definitely a possibility.
@FoxNews I don't like Trump at all, but it's ridiculous to find something wrong with EVERYTHING he does.
I think every #MassShooting is a result of a mental issue.  No one in their right mind would do something so horrible.
#Church is a place of safety? Says who? And from what?
@CNN Nothing wrong with constructive criticism, but @realDonaldTrump responds terribly to any criticism.
@AtheistQOTD I love telling people I’m atheist. I don’t care who they are. Makes for an interesting day.
@FoxNews @ffweekend @dbongino What’s a sin?
@FoxNews @ajtata Man, I hate that this is a really good question.  What are the chances of never?
This is great. https://t.co/9TPAcmWnJX
@NeeleyJonea @littlecaesars The one here in Nederland has service that I would rate 5 out of 10, but the pizza itself is great.
@m_pana Thanks. And it’s possible that these guys are guilty, but to immediately judge them seems wrong. Lives can be ruined.
Does no one ask if some of these men are being wrongfully accused of #sexualharrasment? Everyone believes the women without question.
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr No religious test, huh? A requirement for holding office in Texas is that you must acknowledge the existence of a divine power. Wtf?
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Can you please cheer the fuck up?
@politico Low level volunteer is where some people have to start out...And wtf is wrong with a coffee boy? Coffee is wonderful.
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Why are you always so negative? You seem to be a very unpleasant person to be associated with.
@BillOReilly Growing because it goes unchecked. It takes on many forms. Not just religion.
Hey, at least I ask questions instead of pretending to know things.
@TomiLahren Real quick, what is CAIR?
@TechCrunch That’s impressive.  I just like large cases because they look good, and I can personalize them.
@EdKrassen I bet people are gonna start talking to make deals.
@wgdj @factcheckdotorg I don’t know, but they don’t seem to miss anything. I like that they provide sources for all their information.
I HATE every printer in existence. I wish they’d all die horribly. #desklife
@FoxNews Genocide and rape are also found in the Bible. God is okay with that stuff. Christians worship a lunatic that doesn’t even exist.
@TheGayConservat @EricKlinenberg @ChelseaClinton @ronlieber I guess not. Recruiter made promises that were never kept. I was too young to understand. It’s not even the loan itself. It’s the interest.
@Shelia_Kay @FoxNews Most statements Trump makes are misleading or incorrect. I don’t blindly believe everything someone says. I find sources.
@steelmusician @brvgnrsk @DwbBill @deejayquai @FoxNews No one has it figured out, because they’re too proud and stubborn to work together.
@suzziees3 @FoxNews They’re no longer president.
@suzziees3 @Preacher69Kenny @FoxNews So I’m an ObamaCare supporter since I don’t support Trump?
@deejayquai @FoxNews He's one of the only "Republicans" I don't respect.  I'm not sure I'd call him a true Republican.
@FoxNews We've all come to realize that just because Trump says something does not make it true.
@FoxNews @JohnKasich You should run again.  I'd vote for you.  I agree with damn near everything you stand for.
This #pumpkinpatch I’m going to is at a #church.  I may burst into flames.
@politico @POLITICOMag Are we sure the person they’ve got is on the Trump team?
@captmarvel09 @EdKrassen And I don't even care which side is guilty. I just want the guilty to be held responsible.
@captmarvel09 @EdKrassen Yeah, this is going to open a floodgate.
@timothywookey @AnnCoulter I didn't know they were sentenced at all.
This weather is perfect to get the fire pit going.
@EdKrassen A scapegoat, you mean?
@EdKrassen I'm right there with you.
I didn't mean for my profile to become mostly #political, but I find our disfunctional #government very interesting.
@FoxNews Investigating is one of the things America cares about. Whether it be @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton, we want to know the truth.
@EdKrassen @HillaryClinton My guess is Manafort or Flynn.
I don’t think people realize what the #opiodepidemic comes from.
Why is @FoxNews the only #conservative #news outlet? Aren’t they? Serious question.
@FoxNews @larryelder Just because this guy said this doesn’t mean there was not Trump collusion.
@mccraechum I wonder, but not worry.
@BillOReilly They're not downplaying it.  That's all I see everywhere.
Are there any #news outlets that critique both parties equally?
@EvelDick Pretty much.  It's taking my entire family's weekend.
@Outlook None of the troubleshooting worked. My account is still accessible, but the Windows Security window pops up nonstop asking for password.
If you come out of the #gym walking as fast or faster than when you went in, you need to turn around and have a redo.
@Brooklyn_Ice20 @FoxNews @ksorbs Just finding a reason to point the finger.
@realJohn_Wesley @CNN They should also be knocked out, and have the photos of them drooling on the concrete posted on social media.
@realJohn_Wesley Can I pick both?
@FoxNews Yes, because there’s nothing better to spend $18 million on.
@FoxNews @ksorbs It’s been how long? And you guys still don’t know why they’re kneeling?
@RockyMcNabb @FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren Exactly why it shouldn’t be a two party system.
@EricKlinenberg @ChelseaClinton @ronlieber In a heartbeat, I would give back my degree just to get rid of my student loan. Things would be so much better.
@LTDecker @seculardotorg Yeah, but we don’t do that here in the US. That would be unconstitutional. So, no way a true patriot would do this.
@AndrewLSeidel @FFRF @jasonrapert Putting the statue back up is their way of saying, “We don’t care about the Constitution unless it benefits us.”
Can @realDonaldTrump please release the #Roswell files?
@CShak_Inc Will do.
@CShak_Inc I drive by frequently. Thought about just looking around. I like to build computers and do maintenance for friends.
@PatrickHenry911 @DeptofDefense With all the money this government wastes, they could probably afford more.
@GHardstark @Irenetheintern This is a terrible idea.
@realDonaldTrump I keep track of every penny I pay in taxes. We’ll see.
@DeptofDefense Every soldier deployed should have $1 million in their bank account when they get home. Why doesn’t the government do that?
@CShak_Inc Camera tech.  AR is great.
@politico That’s because Fox doesn’t critique Trump like they should. He’s afraid of everyone else’s questions.
ALWAYS use the restroom just before a good leg workout. #gymtime
@CBSNews Not that I wanna support Clinton, but what difference does it make how the info was obtained? Someone explain?
@CShak_Inc Yep. It’s my 5th iPhone. I’d get the X if I weren’t still paying for this one.
@realDonaldTrump You CAN be criticized. This is not a dictatorship.
@Outlook I'll try the ones I haven't yet, and keep you updated.
@CShak_Inc iPhone 7 Plus. I love those empire builder games, but I've got more important things I to do.
@Outlook Outlook 2016.
@Outlook Office 365 for Windows 10.
I think I may have just developed a man-crush on @JeffFlake.
@CBSNews What's sad is that these truths he is speaking of will just get him insulted by the people he's referring to, and it will be accepted.
@CBSNews @JeffFlake Very well said.
I feel so liberated after I delete one of those time consuming games from my iPhone.
@EMichaelTee1 @WalshFreedom @TomiLahren I haven't done any research on him.
@m_pana Might be a relief to some. They'll finally be able to end their denial of the corruption of whoever they support.
@WalshFreedom @TomiLahren The definition of "racist" has been lost.
Wouldn't it be crazy if Trump and Hillary were found to be involved in the same #Russian #conspiracies?
@TomiLahren This can be said about either side. You're all the same on opposite sides of the fence.
@m_pana @Outlook I have more trouble with Microsoft products than with anything else, yet I put more money in Microsoft. I guess I can only blame myself.
@m_pana @Outlook Tried that.  I can't get a working solution.
Anyone know why @Outlook repeatedly asks for my credentials nine times in a row every hour?
@tedcruz @MooreSenate I respect you, but I strongly disagree with supporting Moore. How can you say he supports the Constitution? You lost some points here, Ted.
@joe_jo075223 @CNN @mkraju I agree.
@CNN @mkraju Hell no! My kids are a role model to Trump. They act more mature than he does.
@politico Yeah, but the more intelligent folks of America are just ignoring his immaturity.
@realDonaldTrump Ever thought about being mature about this whole President of the United States thing?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Where can I find the tax plan?
Why do I despise #hiphop so much. I absolutely hate it with every quark in my body. I don’t know why.
@politico Trump's best bet is to leave this issue alone entirely. No reason to make it worse for either side.
@JackiexIsabel Just take care of yourself.  I'm 33, but I feel 18.
@JamesJLight @StoneColdTruth Pro-choice does not mean lover of abortion.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @POTUS It’s not that he doesn’t try. He just isn’t good at it. I’m willing to bet I’m the same way, but I wouldn’t lie about it.
@CBSNews I was pretty young when I saw Psycho for the first time. That scene definitely stuck out.
@PressSec I’ve got a large family, and I keep track of every penny I pay in taxes. I hope you’re right about me seeing a tax reduction.
@sheyenne_autumn @JacobEngels @RogerJStoneJr @HillaryClinton What are you referencing?
@JacobEngels @RogerJStoneJr @HillaryClinton My what a great influence these "adults" are.
@Manitou47 @FoxNews @NFL Perfection.
Look at the definition of #conservative and #liberal. Going by definition, I'd rather be called a liberal.
@Manitou47 @FoxNews @NFL No.  It's getting on the microphone.
@Manitou47 @FoxNews @NFL I guess if you like the sight of puke, yeah it would be an improvement. Strange fetish you have there.
@Robdang3r @FoxNews @NFL lol I like that.  I'm saving that one.
When I disagree with a #Democrat or #Republican, I get people of said party replying thinking that I hate that entire party.
@MitchCasey3 @FoxNews @NFL How much have you vomited because of me?
@FoxNews @NFL How much Ben Stein doesn't know about the protests makes me want to vomit.
If a link or article includes "SPONSORED" or "AD", there's no way I'm clicking it. #Advertising
@FoxNews I've only seen religious people being anti-Halloween.
@123Americafree @FoxNews No argument there.
@FoxNews Absolutely.  Politics in general has gotten out of control.
I notice it's pointless to follow @SarahPalinUSA. I'm convinced it's really a verified bot.
Blowing my nose causes me to sneeze. Sneezing causes me to blow my nose. This #Immunotherapy for #allergies needs to kick in.
@realDonaldTrump Who does the stock market really affect, though?
#Christians should write a third testament for the #Bible. I wonder if anyone has thought of that.
@CBSNews I need a reason first.
I need to get back into studying for my #CompTIA #Network+ cert. I just wish there was more opportunities in #SETX. IT is dead here.
@nishaJD Cats always doing some weird shit.
@factcheckdotorg Gotta ask yourself, Did Trump lie? Or is he that ignorant to the facts? Also, which is worse?
@meganannepiper @factcheckdotorg That’s exactly what he expects. That’s also pretty much what he gets from his supporters.
@12NewsNow This is what happens when people tailgate each other going 80mph. I see it every time I’m on this drive. It’ll happen again. Be careful.
@WarVeteran05 @firemanmike69 @TomiLahren I’m still wondering who the leftist is.
@WarVeteran05 @firemanmike69 @TomiLahren Leftist you mean? Who’s the leftist? I know you’re on the right. They usually insult first from lack of valid arguments.
@ExtremeTech @geekdotcom “You are NEXT!”
@firemanmike69 @TomiLahren Ok.  I’ll try.
@NeeleyJonea I think it’ll take more than $10 million, but at least he’s trying.
@JackiexIsabel Do what will make you happy in the long run.
@TomiLahren Ted Nugent. Need I say more? You’re all the same.
I wish I liked to #cook. I hate it though.
@StarTalkRadio @neiltyson I can’t listen to NDT before bed. I’ll be up all night thinking about what I just learned. Gotta wait for morning.
@SummerLove323 @MartinDJohnson @MooreSenate I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I only oppose a leader pushing his values on others that don't share his beliefs.
@SummerLove323 @MartinDJohnson @MooreSenate I'd rather not see religion involved in anything. More hate comes from religion than anything. It's taught in the Bible who to hate.
@angrothka @MooreSenate So do I.  Some won't admit it out of fear of backlash. I'd bet that a LOT of politicians are Atheist.
@MartinDJohnson @SummerLove323 @MooreSenate lol I don't know if I'd go as far as saying enslave, but I don't think that's too far from the truth.
I think the idea of having a non-#politician for @POTUS was a great idea. Giving @realDonaldTrump the job was the mistake.
The #StockMarket is looking great, but who does it affect?
@seculardotorg Eh ok.  I signed. 👍
@SummerLove323 @YouHaveMyFiles @MooreSenate My reply was towards a leader who bases much of his judgment on personal faith. I am against this. I'm not against him being religious.
@SummerLove323 @MooreSenate I've read his history.  I'm pretty sure I know what he means.
@SummerLove323 @MooreSenate I share that view, but it's still an insult coming from someone who should be for all the people.  Not just for the religious.
@MooreSenate Approximately a quarter of the US population is not religious. This is a direct insult to them.
@seculardotorg Why does it want so much information? I get enough Unknown calls and mail in my mailbox that just gets thrown away. Who sees this info?
In this #Government, I always expect #bipartisanship to fail. Foolish pride consumes these people.
@rzrbladecupcake @realDonaldTrump That I'll agree with.
I don't like @realDonaldTrump, but I don't think he meant to disrespect the soldier killed in #Niger.
@YourManUgly @XandurThePale @ElderScrolls And portals to other dimensions.
@YourManUgly @XandurThePale @ElderScrolls They had dragons though.
@michellebb10 I’ve never seen someone agree at that high of a percentage.
@EvelDick You’re absolutely right. Dude, I thought I was getting chased by fucking leafy animals.
And I said MOST!
Just an observation: MOST @realDonaldTrump supporters who dislike my comments against Trump tend to be of lower intelligence.
@XandurThePale @ElderScrolls The entirety of Elder Scrolls is based on a true story that happened in Europe.
@gametroll Lol that’s why I stopped blocking them. They make me feel popular.
@EvelDick The 90s Shining used the animals. I liked it better. I think it was more how King wanted it.
@12NewsNow Wow. That means someone probably died from opioid addiction during my writing of this tweet. Think about that.
@12NewsNow This area needs more troopers. Careless drivers going through here nonstop.
@12NewsNow How would you know if it tasted like brains? Hmmm?
@politico @POLITICOMag You could have just stopped after you said “knowledge.”
@brett_mcgurk @PressSec Death sentence, right? What other option is there for them?
@realDonaldTrump So how come so many people around the world are not free?
RT @FFRF: "Trump was asked to explain his support for an anti-LGBTQ extremist. It didn’t go well." via @atrupar https://t.co/dCSPbBY1CK
@GregSmith_Polls Any idea on what's causing the change? Education I'm assuming.
@JillianFertig And with the highs we have today, perfect for doing some yard work.
There needs to be a minimum #IQ requirement to create an account on Twitter.
Everything @realDonaldTrump has done to benefit the #USA, someone else could have done with more dignity and class.
@SarahPalinUSA Where is your disgust at the things @realDonaldTrump says? Hillary isn’t our president.
@seculardotorg Please don’t tell me this surprises anyone. He will stoop lower before it’s over. I guarantee it.
@TechCrunch I’ve been waiting for something like this.
@politico These people think they're above the law.  They just might be, too.
@DayDaVonne_ Just think of it as "Boosting everyone else's immune system."
@12NewsNow Considering I didn't watch the first, nah.
@12NewsNow Absolutely not.  He's one of us.  He should be treated like one of us.
@JustinC13221399 @SarahPalinUSA And I mean no disrespect to the Republican Party, but Trump is single-handedly making a mockery of government.
@JustinC13221399 @SarahPalinUSA Your insults are a sign of weakness. Please level up before engaging with me.
@JustinC13221399 I don't entertain children. Please get one of your parents to reply.
@SarahPalinUSA Trump is an anti-Trump campaign tactic.
@LTWJourno Decapitation? The name alone seems insinuating.
#Religion does not own #marriage.  People just use it to justify their hate.
If I overhear anyone mention the word "scientist" in a conversation, I'm immediately interested. #Nerd #Geek
@danigittsx Sneezing through my nose by keeping my mouth shut works for me.
@deejayquai @FoxNews This will be the first time I've gotten a gym goal from an animal.
@JillianFertig And on that note, gym clothes are going on right now.
@FoxNews And on that note, I'm about to head out to the gym.
The wife and I finished #LukeCage last night. Looks like Stryker will continue to be an asshole.
@Keithma66219895 @FoxNews @SheriffClarke @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I don’t entertain children.  Sorry.  Get one of your parents to reply.
@21gage21 @Kanerdog4 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump @VP @POTUS I'm about the same as you. I don't identify with any party really, but I respect the Republican Party.  I have 0 respect for Trump.
@Kanerdog4 @21gage21 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump He won, but he can be removed.  I think @VP would be a more suitable @POTUS.
@Kanerdog4 @21gage21 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump Someone more competent could have enforced those same policies is what I'm getting at. Maybe they just wanted to stir the pot.
@Kanerdog4 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump I've noticed that anyone who disagrees with Trump is considered liberal. Why? Reps are not obligated to agree with his bad decisions.
This made me laugh. https://t.co/nPeB1sDSUe
@ChristyWidener1 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump I'm starting to think he's a Democrat pretending to be a Republican so he can sabotage their party.
@Chriskl70208387 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump I was rooting for Reps to win.  I just don't see how they got this guy to lead.  They could have had a much better candidate.
@BrianMcMor @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump Not enough, though.  He should be out of that office by now. Everyone makes mistakes, and Reps need to fix this one.
@Chriskl70208387 @FoxNews @PYNance @realDonaldTrump I'm not on the left. Also, I used to lean more right until Trump showed up. Where are you seeing hate from me?
@FoxNews @PYNance I'm with you on that.  I also wonder why Republicans defend @realDonaldTrump. He's making your party look terrible.
#Republicans should not feel obligated to support @realDonaldTrump. I think he is sabotaging their party.
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke @HillaryClinton You guys must have forgotten what @realDonaldTrump admitted to in his "locker room" talk.
@FoxNews @Eminem Why do these Republicans not hold our @POTUS to the same standards?
@FoxNews @POTUS He does not speak for all of America.  In no way do I worship either of those.
@realDonaldTrump Please speak for yourself. Some of us do not worship either.
Does @realDonaldTrump think that the only people with good #morals are #Christians?
@StarTalkRadio @neiltyson @chucknicecomic If you traveled to another Uni, would your body bring our laws of physics with it? Would they obey the new laws, or continue as "normal?"
I'd join the #WomenBoycottTwitter, but....I just don't want to.
@FoxNews @TomiLahren You elected a guy who admitted to groping women...
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews @CNN So, lies from you are ok?
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @POTUS You mean anti-@realDonaldTrump? And what’s wrong with that? You all should be.
@splcenter @FFRF If he’s there to promote this group, how are the Republicans going to defend such a move?
@seculardotorg Does that include the “unsure” Americans?
@oralrcarter @SenTedCruz @POTUS Coal companies could invest in clean energy.  Train their current workers for it. Everybody winds.  (see what I did there?)
@12NewsNow I understand the reason behind it, but I think it’s dangerous. You may as well be trying to read a text message on your phone.
@CNN Taxpayers also paid for @VP’s trip there and back. He should have stayed for the game.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS Why can’t jobs be created for clean energy?
@FoxNewsInsider @TomiLahren As silent as you were towards all those at Fox News. Like I always say: You're exactly like the people you hate.
#Republicans against @realDonaldTrump have my utmost respect. It shows how much they care about the #USA. They are true Republicans.
@FoxNews @travfed If this scare actually happened, it's probably people looking for a reason to kill people they don't like. Vampires though?
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Though I've read and heard that the stock market really only impacts the wealthy.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews Same to you.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews It is a pretty shitty name.  Not gonna lie.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews Maybe they should keep Columbus Day, but also create an Indigenous People Day. Everybody's happy.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews I get your point, and I think they (whites) do that too. My original reply was just me stating that I understand this issue.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews I won't pretend to know why it's just now coming up, but I do understand why it is coming up at all.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews That's what holidays are about.  Our past.
@R0bby64 @FoxNews Just because you don't care, doesn't mean other people do not. The world doesn't revolve around any one person.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews Your logic suggests that nothing that is an issue now should ever be an issue in the future.
@R0bby64 @FoxNews The pyramids were not build by slaves, and that's way different than us celebrating a tyrant.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews Women's right to vote wasn't an issue for a long time either. Neither was slavery. Would you have that same argument about those topics?
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews It's about the consideration of other people besides yourself. The view you're showing is what keeps this nation divided.
@boogieblack1234 @FoxNews @SenBobCorker Gotcha.  That makes sense.  Thank you.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews Right. It doesn't hurt either of us.  But ask those natives on reservations which holiday they appreciate more from us.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews So that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been. Tell me how abolishment of Columbus day would hurt anyone?
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews That's a good question. Perhaps it should have been an issue then, and maybe it was. More people care now.
@FoxNews @SenBobCorker Somebody fill me in on what Lame-duck means.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews You're only looking at it from one point of view, and I doubt that will change. Change is not always a bad thing.
@R0bby64 @FoxNews The land was already here. The Columbus took ownership of the land was wrong.
@GentlemanRex @FoxNews His actions are affecting people today.  Indigenous people still feel the actions of what happened long ago.
@R0bby64 @FoxNews They aren't trying to erase history.  They're ending the celebration of what shouldn't be celebrated.
@FoxNews Well, they have a valid point.  Columbus did commit some atrocious acts.
Why are microwave ovens still highly inefficient?  Cubes of ice would still survive in certain locations inside.
I know I'm at least nearing sneeze #500 for the day. #allergies
@CBSNews "Knowingly" is the key word. That's a deliberate death sentence. The penalty should be increased.
Damn you, @Twitter. I'm trying to be a #productive American, but you keep on existing and being available. 🙃
@MAKEUSASANEAGAI @Jamesdemuth3 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Very true. They jump the gun with opinions before understanding the subject. I believe in giving the opposing side a chance to sway me.
@MAKEUSASANEAGAI @Jamesdemuth3 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine That article is still highly valuable. Thank you for that knowledge.
@MAKEUSASANEAGAI @Jamesdemuth3 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine They simply lean a little more one way. They don't vote independent because it seems pointless.
@MAKEUSASANEAGAI @Jamesdemuth3 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine This is intresting. The flaw I see is it assumes a Democratic vote means the voter is a Democrat. Many don't totally identify with either.
@CNN Trump's quotes damn himself.  He doesn't even need help.
It's #disrespectful to thank a god for our #freedom when it was humans who gave their lives for our freedom.
I would follow @seanhannity, but I feel like I already follow enough people with #tunnelvision. I have to keep the directions even.
Is their any way to make #nightmode active by default on PC?
@politico Planning to divide the nation even more.  Good to see where their priorities are.
@MAKEUSASANEAGAI @Jamesdemuth3 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Guns aren’t a belief system that infects the mind, but they are a tool used by religious. I can see her point I suppose.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Comparing guns with religion?  WTF?
.@realDonaldTrump’s attacks on a news outlet makes me want to watch that #news outlet.
@CBSNews This is disrespectful to the fans and kids who cannot afford a seat at a game.
@OKTXmama @SophiaDeLauri That one on the left...Is it sticking its tongue out at us?
@hot4mysoldier @politico I understand.  And I know most people would mean no harm, but making them widely available is just a bad idea. Many other ways to have fun.
@politico What reason would a person have to install a bump stock on their gun besides mass murder?
@weiland_jen @RogerJStoneJr @HillaryClinton @BillClinton I don’t know how to respond to that.
@CNN I bet the cabin smelled differently after that was over.
@MooreSenate Ok I joined...For some reason it feels like I’m accomplishing nothing though.
@JudgeJeanine This is what you utilize your airtime for? What a waste...
@RogerJStoneJr @HillaryClinton @BillClinton So we all agree that both sides are corrupt?
@CityAngel777 @FoxNews @VP I’m not sure how long we’re supposed to continue.
Just based on replies I see to tweets, I’d say the #USA is FAR less #religious than people think.
@CityAngel777 @FoxNews @VP All you need are iron chariots.
@FoxNews @RepKinzinger Absolutely disagree. I don’t see why Republicans draw this conclusion.
@CNN So who are the meeting with?
@TESOnline It is easy to forget about real life when playing this game.  Sometimes food and sleep just have to wait.
What's the #conspiracytheory pertaining to the #LasVegasShooting?  I know there's gotta be one or five.
Why do people need a #bumpstock on their rifle anyway?
@WestWingReport They should all, by default, be called Asshole Attacks.  That will clear up everything.
@kjrae0201 @12NewsNow Why do you think that?
@deejayquai @FoxNews @christopheswift He is one of the best at doing this.
I just started watching @AHSFX.  Currently at S1:E5.
@FoxNews @christopheswift And it’s working. Just look at these replies.
@StateDept @statedeptspox @UN Glad they cleared that up.
@moonbeam_0416 @69Knight1020 @FoxNews I don’t think any are held to a high enough standard. Dems and Reps alike. They’re all too narrow minded.
@BreitbartNews If all of you were proven wrong in your views, would you even accept it?
@69Knight1020 @moonbeam_0416 @FoxNews Kneeling being disrespectful to the flag is subjective.  MAGA could be interpreted as America is not great.  Disrespectful? Maybe.
@69Knight1020 @moonbeam_0416 @FoxNews No one party is the only one guilty of anything. Our president should be held at the highest standards, yet he acts like a fool.
@69Knight1020 @moonbeam_0416 @FoxNews Liberals aren’t the only ones guilty of saying making extremely inappropriate statements.
@FFRF So @aigkenham just decides he wants to change the definition of words now?
#Dems think all #Reps want rocket launchers. #Reps think #Dems want to take away all #guns. They're both wrong. #TuesdayThoughts #guncontrol
@martin_lillie @moonbeam_0416 @FoxNews Speaking of lawyers, I think if they defend someone they know is guilty, they should be charged as an accessory.
I need to learn to #meditate or something.  My brain never takes a break.
@politico I don’t think a single person is surprised by this.
@AmericanAtheist I wish I could live to see the day when all religions are forgotten.
@FoxNews When I first heard this I thought it was fake news, because it's so outrageous that someone in that position would say such a thing on FB.
@Aaryn_Williams You have to grow a different type of skin on your feet.
@CBSNews @FranTownsend I heard he possibly had some type of trigger crank attached.  Anyone know anything about that?
@12NewsNow I-10 needs more patrol.  Too many people in a hurry all day everyday.
When something terrible happens in the US, all #political news outlets should have all broadcasts shut down for 24 hours. @FoxNews @CNN
I already see people placing blame on others for the #lasvegasshooting.  Sickening.
Perhaps our retail stores should also carry full body armor now. What a world we live in.
@TomiLahren Do you realize that you're not betraying the Republican Party if you're anti-Trump? Just letting you know.
I’d gladly return my IT degree to get rid of my #studentloan. @UOPX #debtslaves
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Proud to be narrow minded bigots I guess. @MooreSenate is one example of why so many people hate religion.
My wife has a better phone than me.  That never happens. #iPhone8Plus
@StarTalkRadio Love the first one? Is there a stronger word? That’s the word I’d use.
@FoxNews @EricTrump Hey. So, what about the emails? That’s a real threat to US security. Not some football players kneeling.
@MicrosoftHelps I have an abundance of free space. 1.23T of 1.81 free. I notice it's usually "System" using so much of the disk time. Is PageFIle a factor?
@platypus1221 I don't even see the point in that post.
@Windows High disc usage every few hours has always been a characteristic of Windows 10 on any PC I’ve used with it.
I’m curious as to whether #OJSimpson will create a Twitter account.
Those in #PuertoRico are being so patient. I have a lot of respect for them.
Today is #NationalCoffeeDay? Who made that a thing? I need to give a fist bump.
@12NewsNow I bet if it said Allah instead of God, they would have been forced to remove the banner.
@FoxNews @NFL Man those Americans love to hate those Americans. And those other Americans love hating those Americans over there.
@CBSNews Nope. Not even gonna dive into this one.
@realDonaldTrump How is this related to the presidency? Serious question.
@FFRF Situations like this, I can’t help but think they really just didn’t want a child and found a way for it to die “naturally.”
@Wethepeople90 @FBI ☝🏻 Just a joke, by the way.
@Wethepeople90 @FBI No dude. That’s ridiculous. Pfft. Statue...He’s software.
@fiondavision @FBI @hackerfantastic @GovChristie Where did you learn that info? I love researching.
@DeptofDefense @USNavy I wonder what percentage of the natives will go back. Is it worth it? I’d hate leaving home.
I don’t need #pagefile since I have 32GB of RAM. Let’s see if that helps.
It’s been 30 minutes since boot up. @Windows 10 disk usage still at 99%. Can’t be good for my HDD.
@TomiLahren You've got some points, but you act like the Republicans don't do the exact same thing you just said Demicrats do.  You're the same.
What is the amount if #Lists people have.  I've got 12. Just wondering if that's excessive.
@Sickee4001 @sheena_tyner @FoxNews @seanhannity The same can be said about Reps crying about Dems. Rep need to understand that they're not betraying their party if they're against Trump.
@CNN This is not CNN news worthy.  Why does this matter?
@palin_smith @FFRF Yet Christians live by a book that teaches who to hate.
@CNN This makes me feel good about the Republican Party.  Moore is far too narrow minded.
@Sickee4001 @sheena_tyner @FoxNews @seanhannity What makes you think I’m crying? It’s possible you’re mixed up in the wrong thread. You’re not making any sense.
@FoxNews @KatiePavlich @MichelleObama @BarackObama More pointless yip yapping of one party being better than the other. Relevant news, please.
Also, that was my first use of rebuttal. I figured why not #hashtag it.
If your #rebuttal to my tweet/comment is name-calling, you just lost the argument.
@JC00011 @BreitbartNews The other side would just say the same.
@Sickee4001 @sheena_tyner @FoxNews @seanhannity Oh man someone gets offended easily. Reps always say that’s a Dem trait, but you’ve proven that wrong.
@Sickee4001 @sheena_tyner @FoxNews @seanhannity I'm not a liberal.  Leave it to a republican to make assumptions and start throwing out insults.
@AtnipNorma @FoxNews @seanhannity Aww man I guess so.
@FoxNews @seanhannity The flag, anthem, or military was never under attack.  Still isn't.  Trump created a false war, and you're following him without question.
@BryanCUFF @marklerequin @m_pana @Iheartskwerls @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist lol Absolutely correct.
@CNN @MalcolmJenkins I don't see why people don't understand this. Trump brought this into politics.
@marklerequin @bren_corb @BryanCUFF @m_pana @Iheartskwerls @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist And usually because he was just a jealous asshole.
@bren_corb @daleksec2813 @Iheartskwerls @m_pana @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist lol Dude, I'm not attacking you. Only your belief system and how you follow it blindly because you were told to. Think for yourself.
@bren_corb @Iheartskwerls @m_pana @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist You clearly do not understand science. Science, based on evidence. Religion, on faith.  Faith literally means "to believe without evidence."
@daleksec2813 @bren_corb @Iheartskwerls @m_pana @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist Scientific theory that has been proven true.
@NurseRatchets @bren_corb @Iheartskwerls @m_pana @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist If I go outside on a clear night and look up, I see a beautiful sky.  I also get attacked by mosquitoes possibly carrying disease.
@RKMCPHERSON2014 The rich pretend they care. They do not. Some do, but not enough.
@bren_corb @Iheartskwerls @m_pana @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist Explain how it is God’s design.  That’s just an idea.
@Iheartskwerls @m_pana @bren_corb @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist Yes those are the ones.
@oskmx6 @jacktoy @CyndyYoung3 @politico Cheetoe!  Hahahaha
@m_pana @bren_corb @GwapoMarcp @MrAtheistPants @Judge_POng @AmericanAtheist Don’t forget those scheduled armageddons.
I have no clue why I keep an #Instagram account.
@MooreSenate You're probably a great guy, but can you please keep religion out of politics?
@politico Wow.  If that's not a bigot, I don't know what is.  How did such a close minded person get into office?
@1sevenwest I find it insulting to liberty that this is even an issue.
@CNN Probably a slim chance that there will be enough fuel for the entire line.
@OverUnderClover @FoxNews Gotcha...I do tend to avoid leaning in either direction.
@FoxNews @Judgenap @HillaryClinton Man, I wish we could get ALL the corruption and carelessness out of the government from BOTH sides.  Yeah, I know.  I'm dreaming.
@FoxNews From what I saw, Facebook was equally anti-Trump and pro-Trump. Anti-Clinton and pro-Clinton. I don't see a reason for this conspiracy.
@ipasuuple @politico @SecPriceMD I was referring to the trip being partially business, partially personal.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I disagree with Trump. He belives anything/anyone that calls him out is fake news. Owning up to your mistakes will get you more respect.
@Stupendous_Guy @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ How does Trump’s enforcement of something prove his understanding of it? Please explain.
@Stupendous_Guy @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ I simply stated he didn’t know what the Jones Act was. You’ve obviously got some deep down issues. Is Trump your father?
Just an observation: #Repuplicans tend to be quick to throw around insults.
@ipasuuple @politico @SecPriceMD Point acknowledged.
@Stupendous_Guy @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Why would I back up? I’m not the one that seems butt-hurt...and what’s not credible?
@politico @SecPriceMD Even if the trip was mostly ethical, these officials need to be careful with how they spend tax payer money. You'll never keep our trust.
@CNN Most celular plans include free texting though, right?
@BreitbartNews I've seen other news outlets report the opposite of this.  Who the hell really knows?
@Stupendous_Guy @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Just because he suspended it doesn't mean he knows what it is.  Looks like more assumptions from you.
@Stupendous_Guy @SenJohnMcCain @WSJ Maybe you shouldn't assume I didn't read the article.  Again, he probably doesn't know what the Jones Act is.
@SenJohnMcCain @WSJ He probably doesn't even know what the #JonesAct is.
@FoxNews @brookefoxnews I respect @FoxNews for tweeting this. What is @realDonaldTrump's reasoning for being so disloyal?
@AnnCoulter Oh man we have got some momentum going here!!!
@ComfortablySmug So does that mean we favor violence?
@TomiLahren Nobody really wins when you people deliberately keep the nation divided.
@SarahPalinUSA Don't you realize @POTUS made this political. Not the players. Always dviding the nation. He's very good at that, and you support it.
@SXMPolitics @RandPaul @MichaelSteele This is exactly why @POTUS needs to stop with his threatning rhetoric towards NK.
@SarahPalinUSA Tell that to kids suffering in poor countries.
@FFRF This is basically what I told my son yesterday, and that he doesn't need to be afraid of not believing.
@NoFascistLies The NFL didn’t ask anyone to kneel. Trump made this political when he made his comments. All downhill from there.
This country is plagued with delusional people.  This world is plagued.
@jack I think the limit is fine like it is. Too much more “improvements” and this will be another Facebook. Please no.
@kfdmnews They may want to think about how that will play out with the students.
@12NewsNow If school is anything like it was when I went to Ozen, those kids will kill each other.
Are there any #Muslim #judges in the United States? If so, who?
@DeptofDefense @USMC @1stMEF That looks fun.
@fugginflorida @FoxNews @billoreilly @NFL I seriously doubt a US soldier’s moral would be lost due to a football player kneeling.
@EFHerne @FoxNews Relax, guy. I agree with just about everything you’re saying. This protest issue doesn’t deserve so much turmoil.
@david_eminizer @SarahPalinUSA Some do not find it disrespectful.
Please, @Twitter.  Do not become similar to #Facebook.
@SarahPalinUSA It's an opinion that they are disrespecting the nation.  Not a fact.  This issue should have never been politicized.
@SenSanders Not another word should be said about the NFL in politics.  Focus on Puerto Rico.
I'm thinking #SaudiaArabia is allowing women to drive so they can fault them for all the crashes the men cause.
@CNNPolitics Somebody come pick me up. I'll go help without hesitation.
@FFRF I've never thought that it tried to.  This should be interesting.  I set my alarm.
RT @factcheckdotorg: Trump said “the world is starting to respect the United States of America again.” Surveys suggest otherwise. https://t…
@FFRF Sometimes I wonder if worldwide equality will every be a thing on this planet.
@IHeartTheBatman @EFHerne @FoxNews That's all great.  Do you guys understand what protesting is?
@EFHerne @FoxNews So you take this NFL Manual more seriously than our constitutional rights?
@FoxNews Nowhere does it say you cannot protest during the anthem.
A political party standing up to a leader they elected is one of the most #patriotic things I can think of.
#Republicans say people get offended too easily.  Then, get easily offended when they don't agree with a protest.
Good morning. Time to start pissing people off with opinions.
Every #newsoutlet besides @CBSNews wants a subscription for live coverage. Like those #ads covering 80% of your sites aren't giving enough.
Much more important things than #TakeAKnee. Such as #NorthKorea announcing that we've declared war, and #KushnerEmails.
Just about time to begin my #immunotherapy for my terrible #allergies.
I’m pretty sure @SarahPalinUSA is a bot account of some sort. No one who ever held office could lack this much intelligence.
@AELO1999 @ChurchofSatan Or just read The Satanic Bible and learn on your own. It’s quite interesting, and I think most will identify with it.
I saw @JerrySeinfeld’s #JerryBeforeSeinfeld. Even better than I expected. Very good watch on @netflix.
@jacecountry @FoxNews Much tougher sanctions now. Sanctions also on nations working with NK. They’ll run out of resources.
@jacecountry @FoxNews Yes, I agree. I believe you misunderstand my original point. Only Trump’s rhetoric needs to stop. Our actions to stop NK should continue.
Apparently, if I think @POTUS should stop with his #NorthKorea rhetoric, it means I want Kim to rule the planet. WTF?
@jacecountry @FoxNews Again, you’re missing the point. Where in my argument do you get the idea that a brutal dictator would rule?
@jacecountry @FoxNews The point is being missed, though.  The world backing us doesn't save lives if there is a detonation.  The detonation still happens.
@DavidSm84387092 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I agree. But if we can keep him isolated in his own little world without killing people, we should do just that. Let him run his mouth.
@realDonaldTrump Funny how so many people think #TakeAKneeNFL is all about the anthem.
@realmarkjansen Definitely my favorite squad.
@jacecountry @FoxNews Absolutely not, but a war of words doesn’t help us. They should keep up the sanctions. I’m not saying we should do nothing.
@jacecountry @FoxNews That's my argument against Trump threatening. We keep an eye on NK, and let them think what they want. Whatever keeps them content.
@DavidSm84387092 @POTUS Well, Trump is the one threatening NK. Someone else in office may see there is no need to poke at them.
@jacecountry @FoxNews You're making this something it's not. Your metaphor is bad if comparing lunch money to human lives.
@G_Not_So_Eazy @DavidSm84387092 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This still doesn't justify putting our finger in their chest.
@RuckerJanice @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Thank you.  I don't know why people defend his actions.  It's as if us having the last word is worth millions of lives.
@DavidSm84387092 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Right, but why give them a reason? We know they do have the weapons. No reason to antagonize them.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump So you guys think it's a good idea to dare a country with a hydrogen bomb? Why are we trying to prove ourselves to them?
@jacecountry @FoxNews You clearly do not understand that it's not lunch money at stake. And who said anything about cowering?
@realDonaldTrump How about focusing on an important matter? Making a fool of yourself should not be a hobby.
So no one thinks it’s a big deal that @POTUS is daring #NorthKorea? Does anyone realize what’s at stake here? Get this idiot out of office.
@genenevada @FoxNews @POTUS I agree to a point. I just hold our president to a higher standard is all.
@spike0763 @FoxNews @POTUS You got a point there. They are getting paid millions to play a game. However, I don’t think that justifies Trump’s lack of professionalism.
@DeptofDefense @theCaGuard For a second I thought he was shooting a rainbow laser from his eyes.
@FoxNews Y’know what else is anti-free speech? @POTUS saying protesters should be fired. Sounds hypocritical to me.
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS What does god have to do with any of this?
@FoxNews @TomiLahren @TheEllenShow @POTUS @WattersWorld I’d rather meet Ellen than @realDonaldTrump.
@danidONAT0 When face-to-face interaction became optional.
@TheVenusProject As soon as you need a computer technician with absolutely zero professional experience, I'll be there.
@FoxNews Well, if North Korea sees this statement, they will test a hydrogen bomb.
@jesssscuhh @speakingtruthbb @realmarkjansen I agree.  @realmarkjansen should have been saved for a different season.
@JUDDNATION My wife and I will be watching the entire series over again soon.
@WESH @EvelDick That's some scary shit.
@Kim_is__bored @speakingtruthbb I’m not popular like you guys, but I love getting hate. It’s fun to argue.
@12NewsNow This is why I always screen unknown numbers.
@FoxNews Why is she sweating profusely?
@NeeleyJonea I'm in Southeast Texas.  The humidity here makes me wish I had gills.
@LEL3856 @PamelaGeller @AnnCoulter That’s what every religion is. They’re is nothing good religion can give us that we can’t get on our own.
@LEL3856 @PamelaGeller @AnnCoulter I think this applies to all religions.
@thejessicagraf So...Have you two decided on how many kids?
@KevinKegerise @FoxNews @foxandfriends @gehrig38 Admittedly, the left may do this, but Reps are far worse. They care very much about the religion of anyone in office. Lots of bigotry there.
@12NewsNow People are so ignorant. I can't believe people still think like this.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @gehrig38 C'mon guys. This is totally a Republican characteristic. I've never seen such a backwards comment.
@PamelaGeller @AnnCoulter This guy is too far gone.  The world would be a better place without him.
@patschampions @RealMarkBB19 Lots of truth right there. @RealMarkBB19 was awesome.
@EvelDick @speakingtruthbb He should have pots &amp; pansed (aka EvelDicked) Paul while Paul was speaking. I would have pissed myself.
@nishaJD I think his goodbye messages are what kept the jury from voting for him. He should have come clean. He lied to the very end. Not good.
@AndyHerren I voted for the same person.
@TheJayRoy You should ride on his shoulders!!!
Since @FLOTUS slaps @realDonaldTrump's hand away and is against bullying, I've come to the conclusion that she has no idea who he is.
The missiles that #NorthKorea fires over Japan, how come they aren’t shot down? What if they’re not a test?
My #TrendingTopics are so irrelevant to me that it’s actually pissing me off. @Twitter has a leak in the payroll.
@EvelDick What’s up with 20 votes anyway? Why not just one damn vote?
#Trending topics usually have to do with TV shows. That’s the most important part of the day? Fuck that. Go do something.
@DanielWatsonLa @EvelDick Yes.  Game playerS.  Not A game player.
I need a little more time to develop an opinion on #iOS11. The App Store will take some getting used to.
I liked @realDonaldTrump’s speech at the #UNITY2017, but I’m not doing shit for “almighty god.” I do it for me and the ones I love.
@CalebReynolds @deadskulltweets You're right.  I just hate that there wasn't more resistance.  Dull season.
@kfdmnews That doesn't look healthy for anyone.
@queendanibbott What? Why coffee? It's healthy if you cut out all the additives.
@ExtremeTech I've always thought that the Xbox controller was the most comfortable ever made.
I'm oddly proud of the speech that @realDonaldTrump just gave at the #UNGA2017.
@SarahPalinUSA So, can you tweet something on your own?  I've been thinking this is just a bot account.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle They should have been removed from the property. If they're illegal, how do they have a right to protest here?
If your protest shuts down a speech or rally, you should be held accountable.  Everyone has a right to #FreeSpeech.
@michellebb10 I agree.  He should have come clean in every goodbye message.  They'd have more respect for him in jury.
@DanRather So many other things to be in a fuss about, and people are angry at Spicer?  It was funny.  I don't even like the guy.
I thought @seanspicer at #EmmyAwards was funny as Hell.  I don't care what anyone else says.
I like following @CBSNews &amp; @USATODAY, but you two have the most poorly written websites I've ever seen.
@ThomasDurrant7 @FoxNews Thought about it a few more minutes...He threw away his safety when he refused to drop the knife. Can't fault the police.
@JoeyWallaceESQ @FoxNews Yeah.  He could have just dropped the knife.
@STCopper @FoxNews Yeah, you're right.  Idiot should have just dropped the knife.
@FoxNews Couldn't he have just shot the student in the fucking leg? Goddamn!
Anyone know where to find some highly overpaid people giving out pointless awards? #Emmys2017
@TechCrunch Oh, just $80k? That's it? Ok. Money well spent there.
@FoxNews I think this kid's story is great, but let's be honest. Republicans would be doing the same thing if Democrats were running the House.
@politico Schilling should be able to post what he wants on HIS page without repercussions. Politics should be left out of sports entirely.
@Ego1Your @Missalita @EvelDick I remember Jessica crying, but I thought it was because she couldn't poop.
@FoxNews I don't doubt he means it. Can he do it, though. Can he get the rest of the UN to give the way we give?
@fox32news @EvelDick I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if he tries to sue someone over this.
@NoFascistLies Some people choose ignorance over knowledge. I'll never understand that.
@SheriffClarke @CPMPolls Funny how people believe everything they read without question.  Bunch of sheep.
@politico @POLITICOMag .@realDonaldTrump and his administration will go after anyone who calls them out for their foolish decisions.
@danidONAT0 @bathbodyworks Perfect time of year for a vacation.
I was away for a bit. What did I miss? Any #bignews? #Fakenews? #Hurricanes? #Riots?
I'm supposed to be doing important stuff.  Then, I start scrolling the Twitter timeline for I don't know how long.
Bizentrize. 💪🏻 #workouts #gymtime
Just a thought: What if #NorthKorea isn't doing any of the provocative things we're being told and someone (not NK) just wants war?
@mccraechum @LoveYourMelon @MSULYMCrew Kinda sorta looks like you're stalking someone in that upper left photo.
Need a solution to stop #Windows10 "System" from using 99% Disk. This is a frequent issue throughout the day. Zero suggestions have worked.
@FoxNews I wouldn't even give him the respect of calling him a citizen anymore.
@laurenelizlane Wow, you're right...iPhone X it is.
Funny how drivers of pick-up #trucks act as if they're going to die if they aren't ahead of me in my car.  You just look like a douche.
@SenTedCruz @seanhannity I have a lot of respect for you, @SenTedCruz.  You seem sincere to me.  I would have had no complaints if you would have won the presidency.
#IfCellphonesDidntExist, this hashtag wouldn't either.
What's a good #debate channel/podcast/YouTube that I can see/hear for free? #politics #religion #environment
I bet Instagram is thinking, "Man, what ads does this guy consider relevant?"
@NeeleyJonea Almost sounds like a dictatorship, doesn't it?
In the #BB19 live feeds: Go to Flashback, Sept. 20, 2017 8:30pm.  You can already see @deadskulltweets won.
@JunDishes Really just Paul though.
#TwitterEtiquette101 People love to throw insults if you disagree with them or ask them for proof of their claim. Automatic loss for them.
@CPMPolls @Twitter Hah.  I was looking to turn off notifications for a specific email type, but that'll do.  I already get too many emails anyway.  Thanks. 👊🏻
@vader13 @trewennack @FoxNews Debate is great, but I'm not trying to insult or make anyone angry.  I like to hear both sides of a debate with real arguments.
@CPMPolls @Twitter Nah.  I usually like your tweets.
@CPMPolls @HillaryClinton I wanna be clear that I'm not siding with Clinton, but there should always be choices that sympathize with both sides.
@CPMPolls @HillaryClinton Can we get more balanced polls, please?
@trewennack @vader13 @FoxNews Using your "outnumbered" logic, scientists who say climate change is boosted by man outnumber those who do not.  Overwhelmingly.
@vader13 @FoxNews Wouldn't that be the motive to deny climate change?  Oil is everything to this nation.
@vader13 @FoxNews What would be the motive for scientists duping the public?
@vader13 @FoxNews If you think there is no evidence for climate change, you have not looked for it.  Research.
@WestWingReport Lol @ the 1% that refused. Probably the wealthiest people in the nation.
@realDonaldTrump Can't we just use the money we send to help other countries?
@FoxNews A little excessive to call them murderers.  I just don't understand why deniers can't see the evidence.
@SarahPalinUSA People always blame US debt on the president. I don't think it matters. We'll always be in debt. Banks run this nation. Not the government.
@Snowden I'm certain that all tech will be abused at some point. We just gotta stay a few steps ahead of the assholes.
@NeeleyJonea I wouldn't have the iPhone I have now if it weren't for the installment plan. $1,000 would be about $42 per month for 2 years. Not too bad.
@regina_getter @krustyshade @NikkieTutorials Exactly.  I'm glad you see it like I do. 👊🏻
@politico @Pontifex @POLITICOEurope For some reason, I immedeately thought of "Spaceballs" when I saw this photo.
@NeeleyJonea I told my wife I want to get a second job just to get that bad ass wireless device.
@NikkieTutorials Why not just.....stop wearing make-up?
#iPhoneX I'm officially impressed.
Chips n' salsa and #AppleEvent
Don't you love those #ads before a video that last longer than the video you're wanting to watch?
@Marian_Dunn07 @lovefall2 Why is her vote so special?
Not sure I like the #CELEBRITYBB idea. They're actors/actresses. The entire season might be staged.
@ExtremeTech @Entrepreneur I thought this was @MissMonica83 at first glance.
@kfdmnews This Interstate needs more patrol vehicles.  Too many drivers think they're invincible on this road.
Haven't had a #honeybun in a while. Just ate one...It was wonderful.
@megmaley Technically, every day after the first Labor Day is "after Labor Day." So, we can never wear white for the remainder of our existence.
@CPMPolls @HillaryClinton @ChelseaClinton @chelseahandler What's considered "bright" these days, though?
Why does @Twitter like to email me each time I log in?  How do I turn that off?
@PsychoRobotStu All of them.
Doesn't seem like 16 yrs. If someone told me it was only 8 yrs ago, I wouldn't even question it. #NeverForget911
This #forklift driver out here is gonna destroy something.
@Chronicle_US_ @omgrealtweet @lovefall2 I'm not a fan of our current president, but I respect his position.  I hate liars and false propaganda.
@Chronicle_US_ @omgrealtweet @lovefall2 Yeah.  It seemed a little far fetched.
Is @NyQuilDayQuil the best thing for #allergies? The DayQuil I took yesterday did nothing at all. NyQuil usually works.
@12NewsNow Finally.  This kid I have is dying to go to school.
@indefagatible1 @NoFascistLies I think the "Free of Corruption" part would solve everything by itself.
Anyone remember when @Twitter had a #PublicTimeline feed. Is there anything similar?
So what's the deal with @HillaryClinton vs @BernieSanders? Where can I get the scoop?  #politics
Eating a bowl of Reece's Puffs at midnight is so awesome.
@TheTomWilcox @LisaRago1 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I don't think anyone here looks bad.  We're entitled to an opinion.  I just want to be clear on what my personal opinions are.
@TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I don't want to take anything away from Christians.  They each deserve assistance.  Not the church itself.
@TheTomWilcox @LisaRago1 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You're right about that.  I think they should be removed from the country, and enter the right way.
@TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Not all atheists are the same.  I'm sorry you feel that way.  We all have our own personality.
@TheTomWilcox @LisaRago1 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Who said they can't worship?  We're talking about taxes and FEMA assistance.  Worship all you want.
@LisaRago1 @TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump If they don't pay taxes, they shouldn't get assistance.  Plain and simple.  Mosque, church, whatever it happens to be.
@TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Again, you're assuming that I'm picking on a community, yet you're the one categorizing me.  Trump is the one who said churches.  Not me.
@RuegarKari @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump didn't say anything about Planned Parenhoods getting assistance as far as I know.  We're talking about churches.
@TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The same rules should apply to them.  Why the assumptions?
@TheTomWilcox @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Right, and they should get help individually.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump They don't pay taxes.  I think that's the only thing that needs to be said to argue against this.
@FoxNews So, are we absolutely sure that #HurricanIrma is about to bust a sharp right to the north? Being in Southeast Texas, I'm a little concerned.
@thejessicagraf @melanincoco This is why I have no respect for any of them.  They don't deserve to play the game.
@EvelDick I think he's the most likable.  But, yeah, he really sucks at the game.
Uh oh. What are people going to do if #Facebook gets shutdown over #Russia?
@NoFascistLies Sounds like a Texas thing.
@macdougal62 @ReverendJEdward @manxxiac @AmericanAtheist @brentthepianist Evolution disproves religion entirely. This is why I don't dislike religious people. I only dislike what religion does to those people.
When I open @googlechrome, @MicrosoftEdge tells me it's faster. Not true. Chrome also doesn't brag about itself if I open Edge.
RT @ChurchofSatan: Satanism breaks free from that guilt-ridden prison, we embrace all the "sins" that theists, &amp; even some atheists, would…
Women should not feel like they're required to wear make-up. Do you realize that's not your face? You don't need that. Be yourself.
@ReverendJEdward @manxxiac @AmericanAtheist @brentthepianist You worship something in which there is no evidence for. You have faith. Faith literally means "to believe without proof."
Going back to #Obama's presidency, what difference would it make if he was #Muslim?  It doesn't disqualify, does it?
@ReverendJEdward @manxxiac @AmericanAtheist @brentthepianist Evolution is no longer a debate.  It has been proven with the world around us.  It doesn't matter if you believe it or not.
@ReverendJEdward @AmericanAtheist @brentthepianist When was evolution debunked?  When was creationism proven?  I'll wait.....
If always said what was on my mind, I would have absolutely no friends.  I don't know if that's a good thing, or a bad thing.
@marcades300 😝I wish.
I've been avoiding Twitter.  I haven't seen the latest episode of #BB19.  I don't want it ruined.  Watching now.
@TXMac58 @FoxNews I've got no opinion on them in public, but I do respect our history. A museum seems fair to everyone.
News flash to the #religious: #Secularism does not mean anti-religion.
When I see my #profilepic I think "Who the f*** is that lunatic?"  I need to find a better one.
@FoxNews Are they putting these in a museum at least?

@melanincoco They'd be more stupid than...well just as stupid as I think they are if they keep Jason. So, it wouldn't surprise me.
@queendanibbott @NPR
@thehill @RussellRosenk1 This was supposed to be a joke, but it's not out of the realm of possibilities.
@Irenetheintern Sorry I ever thought you were Raven.  You gotta admit, though, you favor each other in low quality photos.
@SenSanders I have no story, but I believe that at least preventative measures should all be 100% free.  It's a step in the right direction.
@iamyuneek @politico Ok I see.  I don't understand how this goes on with no repercussions.
@politico I wish I knew what this meant.  I should have taken a damn business class.
@Connscience @GALEic777 @seculardotorg Gotcha.  Thanks.  I honestly didn't intend for my reply about ignorance to be an insult, but I'm just stating a fact.
@Connscience @GALEic777 @seculardotorg Bot?  Who?
@ElJefeStewart @crzymom110 @deejayquai @FoxNews @POTUS @SecretService @FBI Did you know, @crzymom110, that false accusation is also a crime? @FBI @SecretService
@ElJefeStewart @crzymom110 @deejayquai @FoxNews @POTUS @SecretService @FBI I don't think she knows what "threat" means.
@crzymom110 @FoxNews @POTUS @SecretService @FBI What gives you that idea? You may not understand the original tweet. And why would you accuse an innocent citizen if you're an American?
@poliopions @FoxNews @POTUS Very good point.
@FoxNews @POTUS What about a surgical strike that takes out the finger that pushes the button?
Anyone who is literate should read #TheSatanicBible.  A majority of the world population would identify with most of it. #ReadABookDay
@seculardotorg Less people are allowing willful ingnorance to answer difficult questions.  This is great news if accurate.
I'm allergic to 22 things based on an allergy test. I think I somehow encountered all 22 yesterday.
@melanincoco I love their replies.  Usually insults.  So fun.
So, I'd be much more prone to #followback those who follow me if their profile description was at least half complete. Are you a bot?
@brendonvbb12 Wow.  That's a horrible thought.
@EvelDick But if you're thinking it, the rest of the state may be thinking it.
@Go2Deb @jamesrhine This is exactly when I tweeted about wondering what was going through Kevin's head.  Murder, perhaps?
@Recon_Whiskers @AtlegaStone @FoxNews Just me - I'd wait for them to fire.  Shoot it down. Retaliate with more force than they can handle...I know it's not that simple though.
@Lennox_Jagger @jlnoter22 @deadskulltweets Will there be another OTT season?
Can't #DACA reciprocates just go through the steps of gaining citizenship?
@FoxNews @realamymholmes @BarackObama Excellent point.  I don't think they're being targeted either.
@TechCrunch Sounds fair. I think comms should be monitored everywhere as long as people know they're being monitored.
Have you guys used @TweetDeck? So incredibly useful.  Especially when you've got lots of lists.  #TweetDeck
Only took me 8+ years to get to 3k tweets.  If only I had always been as active as I've recently been.
I'm so glad twitter has the #List feature.
@EvelDick I think once it's past 125mph, it doesn't even matter anymore.  Just leave.
@FoxNews I always say "Aww nothing's really gonna happen.  They're all bluffing."  I feel like this may be the one time they're not bluffing.
RT @12NewsNow: FEMA says reports it will pay 1,000 people $2,000/week for 90 days (phone number 888-776-XXXX) are false.  It is a scam.
@GlobalKnowledge Hell, I'm just trying to get my foot in the door.  I don't even care about the pay.
@LloydKami @Tooms_BB If she has lice, there are probably other houseguests with lice.
@danigittsx "Thread thing." 😂😂😂
So, @megalins86 and I just fought a drone flying in our house. Turned out to be a gigantic flying cockroach.
@danigittsx Funny thing.  I just had an encounter with a giant flying cockroach.
#LetsGoRangers of the Might Morphin' Power type.
Did not do sh**. #MyLaborDayIn4Words
@Sandra_Jordan21 @lovefall2 Honestly, I hate when people try to shake my hand like that.  Doesn't matter what race.
@FoxNews Well, if it isn't yours, stay your ass away. Simple.
@ExtremeTech I have no idea what that is, but it sounds awesome.
@EvelDick I can't argue with that.
@Tooms_BB WTF can you pull out of your hair that's edible? What?
I'd hate to see #Irma hit any part of the US, but somebody is getting hit. Please not #SoutheastTexas.
This #iPhone seems to deliberately slide out of my hand when it isn't in a case.
@olrockcandymtns @FoxNews @HillaryClinton Admittedly, I haven't read up on DACA yet. I just enjoy hearing opinions from either side.
@omgrealtweet @lovefall2 What's the original source for this claim?
@olrockcandymtns @FoxNews @HillaryClinton I think I'm more on the defend side as well. However, I also believe in taking the steps to become a legal citizen.
@witchiepoo0618 @FoxNews @HillaryClinton I agree with that. I'd welcome anyone as long as they go through proper steps to become legal. I don't think that's too much to ask.
Why should I defend #DACA?  Why should I oppose #DACA? Serious replies, please. Also, where can I find DACA details?
@FoxNews @HillaryClinton Why should I defend DACA?  Why should I oppose DACA? Serious replies, please.
I think we have less of a problem with NK's nuclear program and more of a problem with the whole #deathtoAmerica thing they got going. Yeah?
This whole #NorthKorea thing...Sometimes the last option is the only option remaining.  I hope not.
When I reply to a #political tweet, I usually receive insulting replies. Are there any civil #Republicans or #Democrats left?
@chef201atc @dagreatscienski @FoxNews Please explain.
@DewberryDick69 @FoxNews There were no snowflakes mentioned here. And how can a snowflake be correct? They're just H2O?
@FoxNews Why are people upset to see Obama being quoted as a former president? So I guess we can't quote any past presidents? Only the current?
COFFEE?  Is Christmas really drinking coffee like that?  #BB19
@neiltyson I wish very much that you created the curriculum for schools.
@maximusmom22 Thanks for that.  I just rewound to the beginning of their conversation.
@EddieWill2518 You words are very much appreciated.
@Exygon ...and I'm taking advantage. 💪🏻
@EddieWill2518 Thank you. My wife and I made bread and cookies for the first responders. It's the least we could do. No bread on shelves around here.
@EddieWill2518 Not in my neighborhood, but the surrounding area was pretty bad.
@MattheasJ @DrStevenGreer @netflix I have both right now.  A lot of Prime's selections have to be rented at an additional cost.
It's strange that I can drive with the windows down and not sweat my ass off. #SoutheastTexas
@thejessicagraf I think someone owning a dragon would need to be reported to the proper authorities.
@ReporterTiffany @kfdmnews Damn, it's Monday.  I figured that water would have moved out by now.
@Ruthfulness @politico @akela_lacy I can't help but to think that Trump isn't really in control.  There's much more going on behind the scenes than we can see.
RT @rcapsalin: Best. Tweet. Ever. 😭😭😭 #bb19 https://t.co/ZHUoPyqrGi
@politico @akela_lacy I think this is accurate.  He's highly provocative.  I view Trump the same way, though.
Imagine if the nation boycotted money. What is a way that could work for the better? #LaborDay
@EddieWill2518 ?
@tw88_ Sorry. I didn't mean to insult. My original tweet wasn't aimed at a particularly party. It's hard to tell who's truthful.
@tw88_ Please reply with proper grammar.
@CameronHeard210 Dude, you should get a second go at it next year.
@EvelDick Paul could tell his entire plan in a house meeting. Besides Kevin, they would all just go along with it.
The way #politicians lie, I never know what policies are good or bad for our nation. #DACA #USA
I'd give #Unacknowledged 5 stars if @netflix still did that.  Thumbs up.  Excellent work, @DrStevenGreer.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS Why say anything at all to/about NK? Make them think we forgot they exist.
My #political timeline is going well.  I've covered the #Russiainvestigation and #Clintonemail investigation.  So much happened last year.
@_LizNolan This cast is an insult to the game.
@deadskulltweets Can't blame Paul for playing the game so well at the same time the other HGs are absolutely terrible.
I'm on #Twitter WAY more than I'm on #Facebook.
Time for some #Dominos.
@EddieWill2518 @ThatsPrivate @politico And that's all you know.
@MarinaBills1 @DrStevenGreer You should check it out.  It's on Netflix.
I'm finally getting to watch @DrStevenGreer's #Unacknowledged.
So, if #BBRaven was to be on slop, would she be able to eat her boogers and scabs?  Serious question.  #BB19
I began my own #political timeline with a variety of sources.  I'm gonna catch me some contradictions somewhere dammit. #FakeNews
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr I understand she has the right to be anti-Trump, but this crosses the line.  Be civil about it.
@EvelDick I want one now.  He's beautiful.
@SouthernLivN @EvelDick Damn she went to town on that thing.
@TheJayRoy lol You'll be back soon, dude.
@rcapsalin Thank you. 😄
If @deadskulltweets were to be evicted, the other HGs would probably follow him out the door as if that's procedure.  Game's over.  #BB19
I'm not sure why I just made that my profile picture.  I don't think it attracts anything.
@Mr_GuyWise Thanks for the RT.
Thanks for the RT, @VeronicainTN
@TheJayRoy You'd think after 19 seasons, people would know what the game is about...I thought Raven was a superfan. Really just a supercunt.
@JackiexIsabel I try to look at the bright side of everything...At least she's not being wasteful.
@thejessicagraf He could probably send home a producer if he wanted to.
@politico You guys are right. He can absolutly be faulted. Trump should keep in shape. A gym membership wouldn't be too much for his budget.
@ThatsPrivate @politico Oh I wasn't saying older people can't be phyisical.  I'm saying Trump can't be physical.  Probably hasn't lifted over 50lbs his entire life.
@politico Not being a smartass here, but I don't think Trump is capable.  He's getting up there in age.  He really can't be faulted for that.
If you're gonna be thankful for what #Harvey didn't take, shouldn't you thank who/what is actually observable? #FirstResponders #CajunNavy
Seems disrespectful and selfish to thank god for being spared on a social media platform while others died.
I haven't played #Diablo3 since I was KFS and my hardcore died months ago. How can I play with confidence? Very unacceptable, @Blizzard_Ent.
"I'm going to bed." really means "I'm gonna lay in bed on my phone for two hours." #goodnight
@ShellyMooreBB13 @deadskulltweets @BB19KEVIN You probably heard wrong.  Paul doesn't say stuff like that in this house. 😐
@CameronHeard210 Your gameplay right now is better than the remaining houseguests.
C'mon, @verified.  Do some verifying. https://t.co/eIdzdDGaol
@TheJayRoy Thank you for your sacrifice.  You're entertaining.
@heydollkel @BB19KEVIN I wish it so bad.  I would pay money to see that.  He would automatically get AFP.
I wish @BB19KEVIN would interrupt them by throwing the chess set &amp; table off the balcony. Then walk off like nothing happened. #BB19
@LaNinaVida @BB19KEVIN I'll vote him or Cody.  Cody's mistake was just trying too hard too quick.  He was there to play, though.
@LaNinaVida @BB19KEVIN And he's lost hope for the younger generations.
@fholland91 @BB19KEVIN He probably feels like the smartest human on the planet right now.
I'm watching @BB19KEVIN watch the other six houseguests.  I wish I knew what was going through his head.  #BB19
@TheJayRoy I'll be honest and say the chainsmoking had me biased against you, but really your gameplay was great in my opinion.
#Somehashtagsaretoodamnlongfora140characterlimit
People worth over $1 billion are billionaires. Over $1 million are millionaires.  So, am I a hundredair?

@GovAbbott @tedcruz The people affected need actual help.  What will praying do?
@JessieClaire88 lol I see what you did there.
@CBSBigBrother This guy is one of the reasons you have a disclaimer on your live feeds.
RT @PennStateIFC: With the current devastation in Houston, we are pledging $0.15 for every RT this gets! Please forward this along to help…
@RogueSNRadvisor @OKTXmama @realDonaldTrump I think it's too soon to answer, but he certainly seems to be headed in the wrong direction.
@laurenbachman Same here.  I even feel guilty.  I need a rescue truck for the next time this happens.
@Shakespeare527 If you think about how horrible this batch of houseguests is, it may not be out of the realm of possibilities.
@Icynow I'm pretty sure they're rescuing people.
Have you seen #Irma's projected path in the Atlantic?  It may be falling directly into #Harvey's path.
Lots of helicopters flying over #NederlandTX right now. #Harvey
Playing some #Rummikub with the family during #Harvey.
@wespwood @SarahPalinUSA I have no qualms with you or anyone telling me that.  My original argument was for the families who lost loved ones.
I hope to have a truck and boat by next hurricane just so I can go help people get to safety. #HarveyStorm #Harvey
@wespwood @SarahPalinUSA I can't speak for all atheists. We're not all the same. I comfort by moving on and making the best out of what I do have.
@wespwood @SarahPalinUSA I can't accuse something that doesn't exist. I find it inappropriate to tell someone god is good if they just experienced a tragic loss.
@wespwood @SarahPalinUSA The ones spared?  I'm not sure the point is being seen here.
So many "Trends for me" have something to do with a show I've never seen or heard of.  How is that for me? #TrendingTopics
I don't hate wealthy people.  I hate wealthy people who get their money by being cons. #Osteen
@SarahPalinUSA God is good?  Tell that to the families of the people who died.
@miss_kreepshow @EvelDick @JoelOsteen I saw that too. Then I saw pictures of it flooded. One has to be from the past. I despise Olsteen, but I don't wanna spread fake news.
Can we get a @WholeFoods to the Beaumont/Port Arthur area?
@EvelDick @JoelOsteen I'm hearing conflicting stories about the church.  One says it's open.  Another says it's closed.  Has one story been proven?
@EvelDick Really don't know.  @CBSBigBrother cut the feeds like always.
Good job, @CBSBigBrother.  Cut the feeds when #BB19 gets good.
Is there an empire building game that isn't #paytoplay?  They all end up being pointless unless you have deep pockets.

@WestWingReport What's wrong with questioning someone in power?  They're the ones who should get questioned first.
Looks like I planned my vacation one damn week to late.
"No one is above the law" is one of the most false statements I hear repeated. #USA #Politics #
@EvelDick I wonder how they'll all try to justify their season-long dumb ass moves after its over.
@CalebReynolds I guess she thinks Mark is a big move.  What game is she playing?
@queendanibbott That's why I keep sugar-free gum in the car.
Why does this Wednesday feel so much like Thursday?
Haven't watched the #BB19 feeds in a couple days. Turned it on. They're still taking about @theejessicagraf and @BBCodyNickson.
@KayleighhConnor Especially when the formula is longer than the monitor.
I try to find any reason to create a #spreadsheet.
Give #jonjones the benefit of the doubt before jumping his ass. Wait until that second result comes in.
A reason many don't see that makes it impossible for a racist person to change. They love being racist. Why else would you choose to hate?
@EvelDick I'd vote Cody just for the priceless look on the other houseguest faces if he were to win.
RT @butterflykatten: FFS They are still talking about Cody #bb19  #BB19LiveFeeds VOTE CODY FOR AFP Give this cast the middle finger some of…
I just realized I don't know who #JerryLewis is.
@SarahPalinUSA Who?
@FFRF A requirement to holding office in Texas is to acknowledge that a god exists.  I have a big problem with that.
What's the worst thing that could happen if @CBSBigBrother doesn't cut out the feeds once every five minutes? #BB19
@JunDishes Oh man Brad Pitt was awesome in that film.
@GinaMarieZ Cody.  Hands down.  At least he played.  Matt is just...a matt.
@WestWingReport @realDonaldTrump His competence is probably hovering around the same level as @SarahPalinUSA.
@rhysam @ChurchofSatan God works in mysterious ways, dude...Oh, sorry, I misspelled fucked up.
There's absolutely no way that @SarahPalinUSA fairly earned any degree, certification, or reward she currently holds. #Politics
@butterflykatten I feel like he single handedly ruined this season.  Even if not deliberately.  His entry was a mistake.
@peplamb This doesn't prove anything.  Just words from an over interpreted book.
@peplamb @realDonaldTrump Well then, your god is a complete asshole.
#InScienceITrust
@EvelDick Wow, I didn't see the live feeds that season.  WAY worse than I thought.
I question a person's intelligence when I see them do all they can to avoid the number 666.
@EvelDick She still reminds me of Tommy Pickles from Rugrats.
Alex reminds me of Tommy Pickles from Rugrats. #BB19
@Hans62vdBerg @politico They made the choice to keep me.  Simple as that.
I'm wondering how #GamesOfThrones is going to be concluded in only two more episodes.
@politico Abortion is also good for population control.  Yes, I'm serious.
@TomiLahren Did you know #Democrats and #Republicans don't have to fight with each other?  Did you know that?  I thought you knew that?
@SarahPalinUSA Did you know #Democrats and #Republicans don't have to fight with each other?  Did you know that?  I thought you knew that?
@theejessicagraf Awesome.  I can't wait to see him active.  If he unlocks, I mean.
@theejessicagraf I'm glad you see how many people support you and Cody.  I was hoping for something to spin in your favor, but...
@NeeleyJonea Trump's position gives those assholes confidence.
@TomiLahren And what, exactly, do you do for this country besides complain, moan, and insult?  I'll wait.....
#IfIWereGodIWould be the first one ever.
@politico It says GOP backing.  That could be a single republican.  I hope.

@lucidlifedream Is this an expression of frustration towards estate agents? Or is this an announcement of a current action? It could easily be misconstrued.
I need to just sit and think about how good that food was that I just ate.
I forgot about time while I just sat with my #coffee and @Twitter feed at the table.
@realDonaldTrump You favored those same polls when they leaned in your direction.  Why the change of heart?
Last night's #GameOfThones was, IMO, the best episode of the series.
@Shakespeare527 I'm not sure about how I feel about anyone at this point. I think that big fight day just got me turned off of them for their immaturity.
What has @FLOTUS done while in her position?  Serious question.  I know there was that anti-bully campaign thing.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Isn't your wife supposed to be against cyber bullying? How do you explain your conduct to her? You deliver just as much fake news as anyone.
Time for some #GameOfThrones.
Each and every person I follow is on a #TwitterList.  They're all hidden, though.
@wendyjensencan Nope.  As a matter of fact, it's doing some storming outside my house right now...Hurricanes are also fun.

I think I may have used a semicolon correctly in my recent reply to @butterflykatten.  Someone please confirm.  This is very important.
@butterflykatten Not sure which is worse; Paul's sense of authority, or Josh's submission.
Paul has had two weeks of HOH bed.  He can't let Josh have one week for himself?  #BB19
@ClockworkHeart I went through that experience for about three weeks not long ago.  The humidity had me sticking to the bed sheets.
Why didn't @CBSBigBrother air the house bashing Cody with their assumption that he's not a Marine?  That's some important footage. #BB19
@morgan_willett Her and Raven need a pity party. #BB19

@SpencerBClawson @CBSBigBrother You forgot to add "going to be right back."
@DayDaVonne_ You misspelled Paul's Eviction Party.
@DayDaVonne_ You misspelled Paul.
@EvelDick And we hate the rest of the house.
@lucynowa Yep.  That's it.  That's exactly how I feel.
People are really entertained by #BB19 Josh?  I'm not sure how I feel about that.
Is something a #stereotype if it's true?
Most people that use the word, "racist," don't know what #racist means.

@forevermegatron @ChurchofSatan It doesn't count.  I don't see Baphomet anywhere.
@Shakespeare527 They should call it quits in the house, and try again once they're both out.  I'm sure no one is "themselves" in the #BB19 house.
I think Mark just wants this conversation to be over with. #BB19
Trends based on who I follow are nowhere near similar to who I follow. #TrendingTopics
Paul thinks Josh will be AFP?  I hope not.  Something is wrong with America if so.  #BB19

@queendanibbott Sounds like you need to notify the FBI.  Although, they may be curious as to how you know about a shooting that hasn't happened yet.
@marcorubio So all it takes is a spinning toy to bring down a nation?
@ABCPolitics @RandPaul @GMA More of the #blamegame.
If people can't agree on how the #Constitution should be interpreted, why don't they rewrite it to be more explanatory?
This #infomercial I'm seeing is kind of making me sick.
I think @realDonaldTrump would get more support if he would reply to his followers.  Is he allowed?
@realDonaldTrump So, you're saying it's ok to perform illegal activities if everyone else is?
@whitneyhogg I have a problem peeing in every set of clothes I wear. I hate how uncomfortable it is to walk around soaked.
@SarahPalinUSA You're proud of her because of what she wears? What has she done? Absolutely nothing. Has your account been hacked?
@aimeok @greysonsmom518 I'm thinking the same, and now I want him to get back into the house.
Stepped on a big ass water bug while I was barefoot in total darkness.  This is what #nightmares are made of.

How come #alcohol and #tobacco are still legal? So many deaths over them. Money is more important than lives. Only explanation.
@EvelDick Haha.  I felt pleasure from laughing at your ping pong ball comments.  Everyone has got a little Evel in them.
@CBSBigBrother C'mon guys. I don't pay for All Access to watch two HGs all summer. Did I make a mistake by subscribing?
@littlelizziev @kerathink I listened and looked for your profile immediately after. We need more positivity in the world like you, Lizzie.
@TeamCavuto Or at the very least, remove all interest from the loans.
Muscle keeps twitching near the knee.
EVERY computer mouse I own has something wrong with it.  Several different brands, too.
I'd watch the #BB19 live feeds more if they weren't always focused on Cody and/or Jessica.  Can we get some variety, @CBSBigBrother?
Quoting from the #bible does absolutely nothing to help anyone.  You can find life lessons in much better places.  In reality, for example.
@Shakespeare527 Pretty sure that was the best veto meeting ever. And it was the FIRST of the season! #BB19
Which also means I have to stay away from Twitter to avoid #BB19 #spoilers.
Can't watch #BB19 until the day after it airs. Live TV isn't available in my area on @CBSAllAccessTV
@JunDishes Jun was my favorite by the second week.
A thermometer on the next #iPhone would be great.
I've noticed the only time @realDonaldTrump says something impressive is when it's written by someone else. #AntiTrump
@realDonaldTrump Try acting your age this time.  No shoving, please.
Does @realDonaldTrump realize that most of what he says is categorized as #FakeNews?  I don't think he is aware.
. @Twitter needs to do some housekeeping.  Too many X year-old accounts with #zerotweets.
Hey, uh, can we please get the @CBSBigBrother live feeds off of Cody and Jessica? Pointless.  #BB19
@queendanibbott Maybe it's your intro music you didn't know about.

The speed at which the amount of replies @realDonaldTrump gets to his tweets is amusing...Just realized that sentence is hard to understand.
@politico What does #Syria have to gain from using #ChemicalWeapons on its own people?
Man, @JulieChen looked hot in those #BB3 outfits.  #BB19
I'm in serious need of some #IT #networking exposure. Professional stuff.  Some kind of #challenge.
Just go ahead and declare #MarshalLaw in #BeaumontTX. It would be a much safer place to live.
RT @WestWingReport: If Russia story's a "hoax" as President says, why not encourage a full, unfettered investigation? Let his enemies make…
@realDonaldTrump Can you please take the high road and ignore it if it isn't true? You fuel the fire. Don't you understand that?
@GlobalKnowledge How do I deal with "chicken or the egg" challenge?
@EvelDick @SheilaKennedy @PhilipAlanPhoto @notrlyscreaming Explains why it took so long for Julie to answer. We couldn't hear Julie saying "Are you fucking serious?"
I'm on @realDonaldTrump side when it comes to #golfing often.  All that responsibility would drive me crazy.
The word "like" should be limited on #BB19 to 3 times/hr. Twice in one sentence = automatic eviction.
@EvelDick I had one crawl into my underwear while they were at my ankles just to lie down.  Also, I was on the toilet.
Not much I hate more than a unanimous decision in #BigBrother #BB19
Got a #rainout today.  Can't say I'm upset about it.
@EvelDick Was the medicine called a restraining order?
@marcorubio So, you think it should stand? Even though it's unconstitutional? I'm a @marcorubio supporter, but I think you are wrong on this.
@MichelleMBB18 What?  I love having my opinions judged.  Not that it happens very often. ☹️
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I own my mistakes.
Observation: #Dems seem to argue with facts. #Reps seem to argue with insults. How long will it take for me to be proven right? #politics
When I decide not to wear my headphones into the #gym, I regret not wearing my headphones into the gym.  #GymTime
I tell my phone what to notify me of.  Then, I get mad at my phone for sending me too many notifications. #iPhone7Plus
I hope none of the #BB19 houseguests have any kind of relationship with a previous houseguest.
I love my #coffee in the morning. #GoodMorning
My 7 year old daughter just told me she would give me $999,999,999.  I'm waiting...
@coolcam101 I know this is fake, because his whiskers would have been pulled out.
This was my #FirstTweet ever. https://t.co/OQoWOYME3d
#LemonCookies
Just noticed how many dead bodies are in this house.  Some have been dead a long time.
Just finished #BB6. Only the first 5 seasons left. As I watch the seasons in reverse order, I notice the intro gets more corny. #BB19
I'm watching #BB6, and they bust out the VHS at the Jury House.  I thought VCRs died way before that.  #BB19
There's no way the #USA has an average #IQ of 100.  It has to be closer to 80.
@michellebb10 Still feels like an eternity.
The @CIA would be smart to hire someone with no relevant experience or qualifications.  Perfect cover.  (hint hint)
Man, I sure do hate nostril hair.
RT @RodneyDavis: https://t.co/F3wOYEIjew
@charliekirk11 @TomiLahren @HouseGOP The blame game does not help anything.  It's part of the problem.
Thank you @RodneyDavis for that interview on @FoxNews. We need to be united. #Alexandria
Parties already blaming each other for #Alexandria.  You're both at fault.
Why do people say to keep someone in your #thoughtsandprayers?  What difference is that going to make?
What else needs to happen to get #Reps and #Dems to work together?
I think #JeffSessions defended himself well.  That's all I have to say about that.
@BlizzardCS Is it a common occurrence for Hardcore players to die when kicked?
@CBSBigBrother @JulieChen I still think @JulieChen should be a houseguest in the ultimate #BigBrother twist.
I love everything @ChurchofSatan stands for: Pride, liberty, and individuality.  Hail Satan!
Watching the #SessionsTestimony.  So very exciting.
Gotta nice drive to #Louisiana this morning. I'll be listening to @NPR for most of the drive.
@realDonaldTrump What are your thoughts on @factcheckdotorg?  They catch you in one lie after another.
@SarahPalinUSA Can we please get some positivity from BOTH sides?  You "professionals" are like middle school kids.  My 7 year old twins act more mature.
I'm at #BB6 in my backwards @CBSBigBrother marathon.
Can we please have some good news about #Dems or #Reps without having to bash the other?
Found a strange device on my #LAN last night. A phone, in fact.  Time to set up an #accesslist.
And just that quick, I'm awake again. #GoodMorning
I shouldn't have taken that nap. #CantSleep
I'm so proud of my yard right after I mow it.
I think @realDonaldTrump should be a HG on #BB19
Looks like my weekend will be #relaxing and #productive at the same time.
The #Democrats and #Republicans will get opposite takes from the #ComeyTestimoney, and they will ignore the other party's arguments.
I figure people in #politics argue like middle school kids because they want to feel young again. That's my only theory.
I'm getting notifications from every news app on my phone about the #ComeyTestimony.
@politico Well, if he didn't know their plan, he does now. #ComeyTestimony
@kyledcheney @politico Sort of looks like a #political edition of #BattleBots. #ComeyTestimony
@EvelDick And digital evidence would possibly be wiped out if the plane was crashed. I say keep the fleshy pilots.
I read James Comey's statement.  I didn't see anything that would absolutely be incriminating. I would also like to add that I'm no expert.
To any #republican reading this, will you still support @realDonaldTrump IF he is guilty of a crime?  He seems to think so.
@JulieChen @GinaMarieZ @CBSBigBrother Does this mean @JulieChen will be a HouseGuest?
@bbbronte18 This picture is very good for my eye health.
@billoreilly Wouldn't this be a plus for the Obama admin? Please correct me if I'm wrong, and explain.
When the #Dems or #Reps take a stance on an issue, does the other party automatically oppose it?  That's always what I expect.
@GamingSaishi @TESOnline One of the best games to use for desktop backgrounds.
@EvelDick I agree.  Everyone know you're supposed to jack off in the POOL and PEE in the shower.  Duh!
Any #IT companies interested in helping me get my foot in the door?  Even a toe would be welcome.
#IWish I had my own planet.  #Religion would be the only banned idea.
@politico I'm excited for it, too.  No telling what's going to happen in this unpredictable #political world.
I'd like to put some truth serum into #America's most knowledgeable leaders. #questiontime
Why is @TigerWoods traffic problem important enough to be in the #news?  How is that news?  Who cares?  Do any of you care?
Watching #BB8 for the first time. Not quite understanding the hostility towards @JeniusLife. Someone explain.
How can I get #verified? I'm not sure what that means, but that's what I want to be.
@marcorubio @POTUS I've learned not to take an official position on an issue until all the facts are in.
The wifey being @megalins86.
The wifey is bringing me a Turkey Melt from @bucees.
@SarahPalinUSA I followed you for insights, but you tweet as though you've been hacked. You're the only person I follow in politics with useless tweets.
I love me some @DosEquis #DosEquisThursday
It's strange that Reps and Dems are happy with the appointing of #RobertMueller.
@Aaryn_Williams Hahah I can't stop watching.
Can we get a fix for the maxed out disk usage for #Windows10 please? No troubleshooting from @Microsoft has worked. Back at 100% in minutes.
I honestly wanted @realDonaldTrump to succeed. That would mean we succeed as a country. However, he makes a fool out of himself daily.
I'm watching #BigBrother10.  This house is rambunctious.
I guess @realDonaldTrump must have a #BILLIONAIRE friend who asked if he could be the #FBIDirector
Well, I was going to say something, but I forgot what it was.
#GoodMorningWorld
Anyone else remember #MonsterInMyPocket?  Those things were great.
When did "literally" become such a popular and overused word?
Why the hell would America vote for Brendon in #BB13?  He was as childish as Rachel.  Does America like that?  Really?
LOL @ #NorthKorea...again.
@REALCassiColvin Just watched your run on BB13.  You deserved to go farther.  Very respectful player.
I believe I may have drank a spider.
#BB13 was only 6 years ago, but it still looks borderline retro.
I've only been watching #bigbrother since halfway through season 13. I'm gonna start at 13 and go backwards through seasons.
@SarahPalinUSA You're "good book" condones persecution.  I figured you had read it.
Thank you, @CBSNews, for not requiring any subscription to watch your live broadcast.  I'm a big fan.
I see people accusing media of #fakenews while they insist the #bible is based on actual events.  😂😂😂
@ElissaReillyS Saw Oilers and thought football.  "What year is she tweeting from?"

Peanut butter is always a good late night snack.  Unless you have no milk.  I have 0 milk.
I'm like a little kid.  I don't wanna go to sleep when its time to go to sleep.
@queendanibbott They're wings.  Have them fly to you...And that is an example of a corny ass joke.
I'd bet that any nation we defeat in the future, the #US will immediately set up shop inside of to drill for #oil.  Right, @POTUS?
I can't help but watch #NCIS when my wife has it on @netflix
I didn't know #ClassicalMusic was so cheap on @amazonmusic.  I just downloaded a few hundred pieces for about $6.
Just #curious.  Why didn't the #god in the #bible just kill the pharaoh?
Pulled up behind someone a few minutes ago. Their turn signal was perfectly in sync with mine.  Been waiting for that to happen for years.
Don't act surprised now. We all knew something or somebody that isn't #ISIS was getting hit with some #missiles within the next four years.
I'm sure #aliens are losing interest in humans because of how ridiculous our musical entertainers look onstage.  Just #MyOpinion
No cheese in my scrambled eggs this morning, but that's alright.
#goodmorning
Two guys showed up to repair this broken a/c.  One started cursing and belittling his partner straight out of the van.
I've been too busy to read up on what happened with #SusanRice.  I'll make it a priority today.
Saw the word #bunker somewhere.  Now, all I can think about is building an underground bunker.
I sure wish #Scientology didn't sound so much like #science.
I'm seeing one dead water bug each morning.  They must be eating the roach bate.
However, big ass storms have been known to die just before hitting #SoutheastTexas.
Likely to get a #rainout today.  Can't say I'm upset about it.
@danigittsx Never heard of a dinosaur chicken.

Anyone know of a good #Excel class for free?  I've got skills with it, but I want to know everything.
@queendanibbott I have to squirt my wisdom tooth holes with salty water to clean out food.  I like the taste surprisingly.
I feel like ranting about something.  Is positive ranting real?
Wearing this pro @GovGaryJohnson shirt may not be a good idea for this meeting.  Too many @HillaryClinton and @realDonaldTrump supporters.
I wonder if people ever ask @mirandalambert if she's related to me.
Why can't I get a straight answer to the @Windows disk usage problem?  Is 100% really necessary so often?
You can't disprove something that's never been proven.  #godless
The biggest factor in @realDonaldTrump getting my #respect is admitting when he is wrong.  That's what a good president will do.
While #roadtripping I'll be getting alerts about #russiagate #wiretapping #terrorism #Trumpcare. I won't be able to watch any of it. ☹️
#roadTrip through #Arkansas and #Texas today.  Going back home.

TV ads during @JudgeJudy get WAY more air time than @JudgeJudy 🤔
@lucidlifedream Vote to kick.
@ShellyMooreBB13 @TGowdySC Seeing passion similar to his is rare.  I stop what I'm doing to hear what he has to say.
When watching #politics I always check their eyeglasses to see if there are lens in them.
I love watching @ConanOBrien.  I've never went laughless watching him.
I don't like tuning in to #political hearings after they've started.  I'm lost on this #GorsuchHearing

@SenTedCruz I honestly like most of your stances, but I can't get past where most Republicans insist on putting religion into politics.
I'd have brought supplies to detail my car if I would have know I'd be waiting this long.
@TheJayRoy They're looking for a rise out of you, bud.  That way they can tell their peers they got a rise out of The Great Jason Roy.
Lots of intolerance in this free country.
Oatmeal and a big ass spoonful of peanut butter for #breakfast.  Last dose of meds, too.
The food that gets stuck in my #wisdomtooth holes is good for a snack later.
Also, I downloaded @ClashofClans again.  My base isn't doing too bad.
I need/want a #computer tech job right now.
Should I let my coworkers know there's more to talk about than gangs and prison?
Don't ask why you're out of shape while chugging a soft drink for #breakfast.

@realDonaldTrump Congratulations on your win, Mr. Trump.
So...I took a test to see which candidate's views closest match mine.  Turned out to be @realDonaldTrump I can't argue with the truth.
This guy, @realDonaldTrump has actually been elected as candidate for president.  How?  Wtf?
I believe @realDonaldTrump needs to quit letting @HillaryClinton get under his skin.  It'll be best for the next #debate
Looks like Trump is preparing to pull out a shank and cut Hillary.  #debate
All overtime today.  Moving out of these craphole apartments next month.
@TheJayRoy Voting for you, bud.
I can't help but stare at @realDonaldTrump lips the entire time he is talking.

Going to see Transformers 3 with Rhys today.
Cops everywhere over here on Dowlen by Jason's Deli.  I heard a vehicle collision.
It's not easy to look cool with a booger hanging out of your nose.
I could have seen her everyday this week.
In a single shower, I got soap in my eye three times.
@Violet__Haze Eight hours of sleep is too much.  Six hours usually has me feeling the best.
This parking lot wastes way too much of my time.
More stressed than ever.  Life can be brutal.  I still want to live forever, though.

I fell asleep against my will last night.
Stuck between a chainsaw and a pool of acid.
I like how a medallion hanging from my neck will make a person walk away from me.  Probably wasn't worth my time anyway.

@Violet__Haze The only reason for the hardness of my skin is my indestructibleness.
Guess who was at Raceway again?  That's right.  The crackhead.  He ran out of gas for the third time in about a month.  Never seen his car.

My part of the project is done.  It's out of my hands now.  Feels pretty good.

Ramen Noodles make me sexy.
Way too much to drink last night.

I'm at Dixie Dance Hall (234 Crockett St, Beaumont) http://4sq.com/itA9wn
@jess_benton I'd have to look that up. Feels like at least a year.
@jess_benton I'm slightly addicted.  It's difficult to put my thoughts into words, though.
@jess_benton Because your neighbor hasn't shot at them yet.  Doing so may change things a little.
@guitarxheroine Mine too.  I've owned three.  I'll get the next one too.
@guitarxheroine YESSSS!
@MissMonica83 I can't remember the last time I had an early night.

@guitarxheroine He did, did he?...Alright.
