@Jack_Howland @Political_Beats Hi Jack - funny you say that.  During our review of "Summerteeth" I mention Wilco as "America's Radiohead" - but i meant it as a compliment!
As @EsotericCD says: parts of the doc are PAINFUL to watch, because you can tell Bennett has such adoration for Tweedy and fights to be understood and appreciated.
@jimtankersley @Political_Beats LOL. I will quote Rob Gordon from "High Fidelity" - "How can you be wrong for stating a personal preference?!"
There's a few mentions, yes. https://t.co/K40t4IIM4y
@michaelroypurdy we had universal agreement on this. I love Wilco's post-Bennett stuff, but the competitive tension's artistic effect is very apparent on Being There-&gt;YHF

Anyway, I hope you enjoy the Wilco discussion on @Political_Beats and let us know where you agree/disagree with our takes on the albums/fave songs...
I'm a HUGE fan of the documentary "I Am Trying To Break Your Heart" which dives deep into the Tweedy/Bennett tension. Here's a fascinating clip from the doc highlighting it:	https://t.co/wDzf69Mp3q
One theme that came up a lot was Jay Bennett's influence on Wilco's work and the Tweedy/Bennett dynamic.
First, it was SO much fun to talk music with these guys. We ran just over 2 hrs and 15 mins and could have done another hour. The Wilco catalogue is pretty well-covered, though...
So, just a few previews of the conversation on this week's episode of @Political_Beats w/ @ScotBertram and @EsotericCD on...WILCO
