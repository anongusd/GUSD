I hear people talk about a new civil war if Trump is impeached.  Trump supporters, as a whole, are not that ambitious.  Fear of death is a great deterrent.  Life is preferable.  Besides, everyone has firearms now, even the Liberals.

By routinely describing illegal immigrants as murderers and rapists, and telling conservatives that Muslims hate America and want to destroy it, Trump is systematically radicalizing them.
crux of the Donald Trump phenomenon:  By creating an atmosphere of existential fear, Trump causes his supporters to bolster their worldviews. In other words, they become more extreme Christians and Americans.
Trump and his cult: When a president is seen as a messiah who is infallible, democracy is at stake.  and the threat of authoritarianism becomes real. For the cult member, no position is too extreme. His supporters are victims. https://t.co/PokD1my5nF
