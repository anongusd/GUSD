American Indians don't look like the stereotypes seen on TV or seemingly believed in by many of the Acela Corridor political reporters. This goes double for Indians from Oklahoma.
But, critics say, how can she have believed that so easily, given she's  a blonde white woman? Either she lied, or she's gullible, the thinking goes. But here's the thing...
Warren grew up in Okla., where tribal members and whites have lived side-by-side since the 1800s and Indians are the biggest minority group. She's said she was told growing up she had a recent Native ancestor.
It seems to shorthand down to whether she's trustworthy but with implied callbacks to - putting it VERY charitably - ideas of what American Indians are "supposed" to look like.
With Elizabeth Warren's announcement today, it seems like a good time to review the "identity issue" political reporters seem intent on making her defining characteristic.

@JulieDiCaro Of the post-prequels, it's at the top, "Solo" just behind, then "Force Awakens," and way, way behind, like after some of trailers for the above, is "Last Jedi."
I should add I hope I'm wrong, but as we look at the landscape, it's wise to consider all the possibilities, as unpalatable as they may be.
But if the players in the game would rather play a pickup game without refs, and hope everyone calls their own fouls, we shouldn't wonder why there's a smaller market for refereeing.
In short, journalism's most useful function has been to referee the Discourse, to say what's spurious, what's important, call the occasional rhetorical foul.
(If that assessment is true, a journalist can no more ignore social media than a fish can ignore water.)
(This also gets into the question whether reporters should get off of Twitter more. One lesson of Covington is how social media drives the Discourse, not traditional media, which mostly ignored story for its first day.)
Curation is nice to have. A guided tour of a museum is always gonna be more informative than a random walk-thru. But how much will you pay for it? Especially if the museum is free?
This would mirror other aspects of life. You don't subscribe to Spotify for its curated playlists. You do it because you want as much music at fingertips as possible. Same for Netflix and its recommendations.
It's unclear yet - to me, at least - there's a big, sustainable, ad-supported market, aside from some established brands, for neutrally curated information compared with drinking from the firehose.
In other words, as traditional outlets like TV and papers are declining sources of news, social media is a rising one. But social media is just the fire hose of unfiltered information.
That can be expensive. And it's a different experience than turning on social media and trying to do many of those things yourself.
But such curation inherently depends on certain skills - the ability to explain things simply, to have field expertise or access to field expertise, ability to make fair judgments on the fly about the arguments involved.
"Proposition X is true, Proposition Y is not (or far less true), here are the implications for following a policy based on Proposition X or Y" is journalism at its most basic level.
How can that be, you say, with all those eyeballs on all those screens? Well, it helps to think of news as "curated information."
So while that thread on the lack of investment in news and desire for double-digit profit margins did in the news biz, there's another aspect we have to consider: maybe there's just less of a market for news itself.

So while the tax refund personnel have been called back and TSA agents kept on the job under the directive that says government will continue functions that protect "life and property," America's rural poor may find themselves again facing some tough choices.
To be sure, these examples are HYPOTHETICALS. WIthout data on WHERE the recertifications have been held up, we don't know if any rural sole SNAP retailers have been affected. But it also can't be ruled out ...
But that may be the choice a SNAP recipient could in theory face: no food or hope the car the family shade tree mechanic gas kept running will make it 30 minutes or more in each direction without risking an expensive repair....
Now, if you're poor enough to be on federal food assistance, there's also a good chance your car is not in that good of shape either. You may trust it enough to toodle around town, but an hourlong roundtrip on rural highways?

@CenterOnBudget has state maps with Dec. 2017 data showing SNAP retailer locations. It's not hard to find potential places where a SNAP recert delay could cause a half hour drive or more in some states (SD, ND, WY, OK, TX)...
(Those establishments, by the way, often appear to be Dollar General-type stores with limited selections or gas-and-beer convenience stores where it's harder to stretch the allowance...)
For Midwestern and Western states, there may only be one or two establishments in a small town that accept SNAP cards. If there's only one, and that one is caught up in the re-certification hold, the next closest store may be a half hour away....

Linear visual narrative has served humankind well since someone first decided to illustrate his stories by painting on the cave walls. Let's not toss it overboard, just yet, ok? End of rant.
All of which is to say, the old-fashioned, linear narrative was SO much better, 30-plus years on, than the gimmicky thing on Netflix. And we can discuss it without deep epistemological issues.
Yes, Alda's acting is a bit arch, but he's cashing in chatacter chips built up over years. And the farewells to the gang - Potter, Klinger, Hot Lips, Winchester, BJ - are a study in sticking a series finale landing.
And, dramatically, it still holds up. Running 2 hours vs a regular episode's 30 minutes, it's somewhat overstuffed and leisurely. But its beats are impeccable.
The finale was likely the high-water mark for network TV as a medium. Cable was still new, VCR recording of questionable legality til a year later. If you wanted to be able to talk at the water cooler the next day, you had to tune in.
Which brings me to "MASH." The series finale in 1983 drew 105.9 million viewers, a nominal record that wouldn't be broken until 2010, when there were a lot more TVs in use.
There's a reason we've never called linear narrative "storychoosing" or "storypicking" but instead "storyTELLING." Because it matters what the author is trying to say, even if we disagree over what they said.
There's always been a debate about authorial intent and interpretation of a work. But choose-your-own-adventure makes authorial intent a crapshoot.
And that's my beef. It's bad enough people experience music, news, TV and movies in their own silos, but to extend that to the actual artistic work itself ups the ante.
Worse, YOU can't tell ME if you liked it, either. The very nature of the choose-your-own-adventure format means we both experienced "Bandersnatch" differently. We can't even agree on what constituted the piece of art, much less its merits.
"Bandersnatch" is technologically and stylistically amazing. It is "Dragon's Lair," but seamless video, which is no mean feat. But I can't tell you if I liked it.
Watched "Bandersnatch," Netflix's possible starting gun for the end of linear narrative, and series finale of "MASH" this weekend. Folks, we're headed in the wrong direction.

I have zero doubt all these factors were vetted and weighed before the  decision was made. Which is why people may see it as a gutsy gamble. Or something else.
So, like the old joke about football coaches who hate passing plays because two of the three possible outcomes are bad, Trsy Sec'y market statements are dicey things.
Another outcome, avoiding a huge down day that you can't prove would have happened otherwise, would be only a moral victory. DC doesn't give credit for disasters averted.
Another explanation could be it was not Mnuchin's idea. But that would turn the question from one of judgment to one of independence, which would not be that much better.
By going to the well of liquidity/clearing when no one else had been talking about them, he risks the resulting price action being seen as a verdict on the statement. And spending down capital unwisely, making it harder to use later.
Was Mnuchin trying to get out ahead of some specific bad news that's not out yet? Or was he trying to pre-empt possible confidence-damaging rumor mongering? The latter would explain a lot, but is still a gamble.
That's why Mnuchin's timing is so puzzling. Without being in direct response to Friday's price action or a specific piece of news, the possible rationales are unclear.
The point is the statement timing was chosen precisely because it allowed ambiguity. If mkts crashed globally, US mkts would be said to be following Asia, Europe. If they didn't, people would see the statement as "Rubin Calming the Markets" (which they did).
I don't recall the numbers, except a general feeling Wall St. at least bounced back the next day, recouping some of the losses. Boom not over. (Side note: Rubin was such a mkts guy, he joked once about 40-pt drop blamed on a resignation rumor. "What am I? Chopped liver?")
He gave that televised statement at 4:30 or 5 pm, after US markets were closed for day, a few hours before Asian ones opened. No one knew what would happen.
He strode out to give a statement at Trsy's south entrance, with the statue of Andrew Hamilton behind him. As statements go, IIRC, it was relatively tame. Economic fundamentals sound, no serious problems with trades clearing, yada yada.
Arguably no one was better at this in the last 20+ years than Robert Rubin. Back when the Dow was in single-digit 1000s, there'd been 500- or so point midweek bloodbath on Wall St. All eyes looked to Trsy. Was this the end of '90s tech boom?
It means instilling a sense during non-crisis times that officialdom is up-to-date, paying attention, that they're a steady hand on the tiller. That also means picking and choosing when to deploy credibility capital.
So that leaves "moral suasion," aka jawboning. But to get freaked out traders to listen to Trsy/Fed officials when a market is plotzing means credibility must be built up beforehand and spent sparingly and deliberately.
There's not much government can do to both contain the effects of sell-side herd mentality and keep up the idea of free markets. Some things in place, like market circuit-breakers, can exacerbate fears of being last to leave a cratering market.
To give some perspective on the raised-eyebrows reaction to Mnuchin's statement, it helps to know a bit about Trsy and Fed jawboning. Traders are subject to occasional herd mentalities, like those gazelles in BBC specials when they spot a lion.

@senatorshoshana If one applauds Trump for naming judges with narrow, textual interpretations of law (as, it can be argued, libertarians do), for being more "rule of law," is it then hypocritical to "meh" on what critics say is possibly undermining said rule by canning Sessions?
@senatorshoshana "legal doctrine" there was shorthand for "judges who see Constitution as I see it," which was way more letters &amp; not meant to imply pro-Sessions. People can dislike Sessions stances and his being fired for difft reasons. But also be dramatic, true.
@senatorshoshana Never said you supported Sessions and can see why you wouldn't. Point was some of Sessions' supporters saw his AG/recusal = Mueller probe safe = rule of law. Your dismissal of that POV could be seen as trading the last for things you like (judges).
@senatorshoshana If you ignore what Sessions critics say is significance of his firing - that it will lead to Mueller probe demise - I can see that. But if they're right, that's akin to saying exec power without lawful check is NBD.

It was something we needed desperately to hear. And it's something I hope Pittsburgh will be told as well.
He told a hurting city it had not been forgotten. IIRC, he said, "you have not lost us, you have not lost America." There was not a dry eye in the House, including mine.
The other memory was Clinton's speech at the fairgrounds service the Sunday after the bombing. He went to a state he lost badly, some of whose elected lawmakers had engaged in "jack-booted thugs"-type rhetoric that radicalized McVeigh.
Side note: McVeigh drove several hours with a 2,000-lb bomb only feet away on his way to OKC. He could've stopped any time. And did not. Think about that.
"Enemies of all humankind." I had never heard the phrase before or knew any Latin. But the sentiment put into clear relief what we faced.
While the Murrah Building was in ruins, I think even before McVeigh was caught 3 days later, then-FBI Director Louis Freeh called the perpetrator "hostis humani generis."
Some of the things that stuck with me from the Okla. City bombing, aside from the day itself, were responses from the government.

For more on Oklahoma's tribes, legendary historian Angie Debo's works, which can be a bit dry, are the go-to.		Mvdo! (pronounced muh-do, Creek for 'thank you!')
For more on Oklahoma, where the Southwest, South and Midwest meet, read Michael Wallis' "Way Down Yonder in the Indian Nation" book of essays out in the '90s.
As for whether someone "looks" Indian, I can only say I had cousin with the same quantum as myself (trad'l dark hair, dark eyes) who was a sun-bleached blonde with blue eyes as a kid. Genes are weird, man, is only thing I can think of.
It's a bit like like having a last name made up of mostly consonants and growing up in Chicago. Who'd think you were lying about saying you're Polish, esp. in an area where that's common and isn't seen as anything special?
Anyway, hearing someone say they have a "Cherokee princess" in their background is not uncommon in Okla. Expecting them to prove it - given things like the Dawes rolls issues - is less common.
But there's either zero or only one reservation in Oklahoma, making OK Indians often more assimilated compared to those in states with reservations. I discovered years ago IHS at least used to track Okla. Indian health measures separately because of those differences.
Side note: allotment has generally been seen as hugely negative thing for the tribes and their members - tribal governments disbanded, Indians with allotment lands became targets for an early version of predatory lending.
So it's pretty common to see someone who "looks" fullblood be officially on the logs as only a half or a quarter Indian, because a grandparent or great-grandparent refused to sign up.
But the Dawes rolls were, at best, imperfect. Tribal members with long memories of removal weren't inclined to sign up for a government census, being among a variety of reasons.
Tired of dealing "the Indian Question" in the 1890s, the government decided to try to make farmers of the inhabitants of Indian Territory, by counting them and allotting them individual plots of land.  https://t.co/5T6qrGp2AE
How does one become a member of a tribe? It differs among tribes but for several in Okla., including mine, you have to trace your ancestry back to the Dawes rolls.
Recall also, the first tribes were sent  to Oklahoma in the 1830s, about 80 years before the Land Run seen as the kicking off white settlement in a big way. Oklahoma has 39 federally-recognized tribes.
Why would someone think they have Native ancestry? This is actually pretty common in Oklahoma, both in belief and reality. Recall Native Americans are the largest minority group in the state. https://t.co/CLbe5Loc6i
As an Okie and a tribe member, some unsolicited background about Oklahoma and American Indians that may be helpful.

@brianjameswalsh @michael_steel 'What she was doing?" Accepting family ethnic folklore as fact l, as most people do? Was it dumb to do it w/o a CDIB card? Probably. But being from Okla., she likely had no reason to doubt handed down history.
@michael_steel @brianjameswalsh In most white collar jobs like she's had, the formal application can often be the LAST step, after resume submission, interviews, selection. At that point, you can ID as part of a  class, if haven't already, to be truthful/give your co. a pleasant diversity surprise.

Not that an $845B deficit vs. last year's $665B gap will comfort deficit hawks. But numbers matter and an argument can be made no need to exaggerate for effect. Or laziness.
$895B - $50B = $845B total deficit for FY 2018. A bit off from April $804B forecast but presumably an Aug. forecast, had CBO done one, would've been closer.
CBO is saying now, with Aug., the to-date deficit thru Aug. was prob'ly about $895B, thanks to Aug.'s $211B deficit. Conservatively, let's guesstimate that means "only" a $50B surplus in Sept.
Last time this timing happened was in 2012, where Aug. posted $190.5B deficit and Sept. showed a $75.1B surplus.
But this Sept.'s notable in that its 1st is on - yep! - Saturday. That pushes much of its spending into August, inflating Aug.'s regular deficit AND Sept.'s regular surplus.
Which brings us to THIS September. Again, as a quarterly tax payment month, Sept.'s almost always a surplus and, with a healthy economy, should be again.
That timing shift happens occasionally and you should look at the 2 months in totality rather than draw conclusions from either.
Another factor is monthly recurring federal payments, some of which are due on 1st biz day. Those get shifted, tho, if 1st falls on a weekend. A Saturday 1st, for example, pushes those payments to  last Friday of month before.
Some months are almost always surplus months. Like April, where the government sees people ponying up if they owe taxes. But also months with quarterly personal or corporate income tax deadlines.
Treasury flows are, in technical econometric-speak, "lumpy." Some months are almost always deficit months. February, March, for example, when people get tax refunds. (Trsy borrows A LOT in those months to pay those - shhhhh...)
Nope - the budget deficit is NOT "topping $1 trillion two years earlier than CBO said." It'll likely be closer to CBO's April projection of $804 billion than $1 trillion. Here's why. https://t.co/miGHmBy0SS

@ibflorea Wait - that wasn't the job of the high-waisted pants?
@ibflorea I DID go in with pretty low expectations, which may have helped. Technically, one reason for this film is to fansplain that Lucas didn't screw up when used used parsecs instead of units of time in a throwaway line in "New Hope."
@ibflorea Also, the ending, Han talking about his next job, arguably adds some weight to end of "Force Awakens." Little did that optimistic Han know how that path would end.
@ibflorea It was basically a Force-free movie, which I think made it feel smaller. But that was better, IMHO. Disagree on Marauders storyline, which felt shoehorned; Clarke was fine.

@mis2127 I dunno. In retrospect, debate style choices that encouraged candidates' making subtle references to the size of their penises might explain a lot about Trump's winning the nom.
@mis2127 Each party tilts its process in its own way, like w/ superdelegates. Note that the Harwood-moderated GOP debate was the most substantive, policy-oriented one. After Trump did badly in it, it was proclaimed there'd be no more of that stuff again.
This ignores Bernie, arguably a left mirror version of Trump, but Bernie's failure to win also supports his point. https://t.co/fetpNPg6lV
