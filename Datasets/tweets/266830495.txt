Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) says on Fox he expects "a handful" of Republicans to defect on President Trump emergency declaration. If that means five, resolution of disapproval would pass even if Sen. Manchin (D-W. Va.) votes with the White House.

House Republicans fail to pass healthcare bill. What now? Will discuss on Bill O'Reilly show with Eric Bolling hosting.
Conservatives will undoubtedly call for a vote on 2015 healthcare bill that was vetoed by Obama.
Why the bill failed: rocky rollout, CBO score, Trump didn't initially embrace, GOP senators criticisms &amp; hard to take current benefits away.
Somewhere, John Boehner is enjoying a fine Merlot.
We will vote Thursday. We will vote Friday. We will vote at a later date. (Calling for a vote without the votes was always a bluff)

Great question to end the debate.
This question on religion is right in Pence's wheelhouse.
Kaine has started to land some blows and now Pence interrupting too much.
SNL skit this weekend: Kaine interrupting and Pence being asked question on X and answering about D.
Halfway through and Pence is up on points, ducking Kaine uppercuts and calmly punching back.
Just a hunch but imagine a fair amount of debate watchers are checking the Orioles-Blue Jays score on their phones.
Kaine has to be careful on interrupting too much. That's what Trump did way too much in the first debate.

Trump will soon be asked whether he wants Reince Priebus to remain RNC chairman. His likely answer: Yes.
Now, Trump will pivot completely to general election while Clinton has to deal with pesky Bernie Sanders for at least another month.
Trump supporters happy Cruz is out. Republican senators not so much as he will be returning to the Senate.
Conservatives like Mark Levin were hoping for Cruz, saying the party never nominates a true conservative. Those complaints will continue.
Addendum: If Trump wins all 57 (not 45) delegates tonight, this is the count over last 2 weeks:	Trump 257	Kasich 9	Cruz 2
Should Trump get all 45 delegates in Indiana, this would be the count over last couple weeks: 	Trump 290	Kasich 9	Cruz 2
They said Trump's ceiling was 30%, then 40%, then no way he could get 50%. He's cleared 50% in last six states and has 53% in Indiana now.

Mets!!!!
Today is the day. The Mets magic number is 1. @MattHarvey33 takes the mound this afternoon.
Would Kevin McCarthy, 50, be the youngest speaker? Not quite. 	Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia was elected speaker in1839 at the age of 30.
Will Kevin McCarthy replace Boehner as Speaker? Will discuss with @AlexWitt on MSNBC at 8:45 a.m.
Talking about Boehner's resignation now @POTUSPressPool
Boehner's legacy: Eliminating earmarks, fiscal fights inc. 2013 shutdown, Tea Party clashes and Pope Francis's address to Congress.
Speaker Boehner, one of the most genuine people in politics, credits his staff and family at emotional press conference.
Paul Ryan backed McCarthy in his majority leader race. Getting Ryan's endorsement in the Speaker race would be big (though likely).
Story from earlier this month: the right warms to possible McCarthy Speakership. http://t.co/xHahGCm8qX

There are many reasons, but reason No. 1 why Redskins fired Shanahan: 0-6 divisional record against the worst ever NFC East.
RT @KlausMarre: @BobCusack Flawless analysis. Let's see how the Steelers will do in the playoffs.
All Chargers have to do is not lose. If KC-SD ends in a tie, SD makes the playoffs.
Steelers, who started 0-4, are poised to make the playoffs. Everything went their way the last 2 weeks. Everything.
Packers should have gone for 2. Might regret that.
Likely AFC playoffs next week	SD at Cincy	KC at Indy
Rex Ryan has likely saved his job. No one -- no one -- predicted Jets would win 8 games this year.
Jets get payback and Squish the Fish. Steelers somehow still alive, need SD to lose to KC, which doesn't care about outcome.
Texans winning. Redskins losing. Unless that changes, Redskins (actually Rams) get first pick. #rg3ransom
Move over 1972 Dolphins. @JHerbTheHill going for perfect season in The Hill's fantasy league vs. @JTSTheHill. My record? No comment.
My Ravens buddies expressing their pleasantries and well wishes to my Jets today. I wonder why. #squishthefish
Jay Cutler 1-8 lifetime vs Packers. If he struggles today, will he be benched for McCown? Both QBs are free agents after this yr.

Snowden takes on Intell heads in Wash Post interview: Feinstein "asked softball questions." Mike Rogers "kept these programs hidden."
At Dick's Sporting Goods in Fairfax, slew of Bulls, Heat, Knicks, Lakers, Ok. City, Nets jerseys available. Wizards? Must be sold out.
"Duck Dynasty" is in the Congressional Record. Which 2 members have cited show in speeches on House/Senate floors? http://t.co/LZHGpVjL4c
Kyle Orton, the Cowboys starting QB on Sunday, has thrown 15 passes over the last 2 years.
If Ravens &amp; Fish win Sunday, Ravens will root for KC to beat SD to get in playoffs. Fish will root for SD. Game meaningless for SD/KC.

Everything Steelers needed to happen today has happened (assuming Ravens lose). If they beat Packers, their slim playoff chances live on.
@rschles good points. I also think he coddled Sanchez. But his career record is over .500 with Jets. So he's our Lombardi, which is sad.
Rex Ryan reportedly told team he expects to be fired. Jets were supposed to win 3 or 4 games. Now they have 7. Keep him.
"Famous Idaho Potato Bowl" is on. If you have to put "famous" in there &amp; title already has "potato" in it, your bowl sucks.

Jim Allen, a former colleague at The Hill, has gone to heaven. I am sure he is making people up there laugh. Rest in peace, friend.
So who won (or lost) the week? Phil Robertson or @samyoungman? I think people might have some opinions. Just a guess though.
