@RonWyden The concept of "net neutrality" is mislabeled. It should be called "federal government control grab; FGCG". This project was an effort by the deep state to take control of the internet in the USA. We dodged another effort to socialize the USA. Let freedom &amp; capitalist reign.
@ChrisMurphyCT Fake news over and over again.
Need to expunge Title4Chap3Sec72 Congress/Senate need focus on Constitutional duties #balancedbudget #draintheswamp #draindeepstate Having all Agen &amp; Dept HQs in DC too much fighting over power/expenditures. Rule 72 stands with #PTUS and #TedCruz Lead by example.
Why move? 1. Better employee pool to draw from. Every Agency and Department in DC competes for the same employees. New employees can not afford to live in DC unless make a big commute. More road miles = more pollution #tuckercarlson
#DrainTheSwamp #DeepState No distractions, red herrings, elections are over time to do the business of the Nation. Full fill promises #Republicans #Democrats Corps. move HQs due to high cost of living. Honeywell moving to Charlotte NC Move US Dept. &amp; Agency HQs out of DC high COL

Trump was GREAT last night. Hope it all makes my day great again on November 6th. #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheDeepState #rule72initiative.
Hearing about helping #Homeless another reason to move Federal Agency and Department HQs out of DC - How many homeless in DC? Move HUD or HHS out of DC to a city that has homeless first hand experience might help come up with sensible solutions. #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheDeepState
@roset1019 @BoBodling Thank you. Have you seen previous ones, recently?
I'm thinking that this page has been either blocked or some how reduced in reach. So I'm trying to see if any one sees my postings. If you do please let me know or I will think that there is no more interest in Rule 72 Initiative. #HillaryClinton #Obama #DrainTheSwamp
Just take a look at this #budgetsavings if Rule 72 is passed in congress expunging Title 4 Chapter 3 Section 72  for just the top 25 out of approx. 150 HQs Just expunge this part of the US Code then let Congress decide where to move the HQs #DrainTheDeepState @TuckerCarlson #USA https://t.co/RqHbOBQDsi
@lisamurkowski As a man who has taught his children and has also always respected the need for civil behavior, I am asking you to Vote yes for Judge Kavanaugh. Do not allow the left to intimidate you or follow false gender biases. Stand firm and defeat mob mentality and ideological ignorance.
Budget control. Guess what saved annually - just first 25 Agn, Depart. HQs moved out DC? Free hat to person calculates correctly +/- 10%. Avg. salary DC $112,000; COL (cost living adj) for 2018 29%. Savings reduce deficit. Est. devel. by R72I posted in a week. #DrainTheSwamp
Can you imaging a more compelling reason to #DrainTheSwamp then what we see today by #democrates in #SenateHearings - support Kavanaugh get the #administrativState under control move the HQs into the heart of out land @Ladies4Trump20

WE realize this is a nonpartisan issue. It's citizens vs administrative class. Dwellers vs Drainers. If a candidate committed to vote for a Bill to expunge Title 4, Chapter 3 Section 72, would this affect you decision to vote for them? Yes= vote for; No= vote for other candidate

In case you you'r wondering - yes the $25,756 is on top of the base salary. The nation can afford to move the employees out of DC. Can't imagine that cost would be in excess of $25,756 to move an employee and family. Then saving is every year there after.
In 2016 federal civilian workers (FCW) average wage $88,809, according to (BEA). By comparison, average wage 4 USA 114 million private-sector workers $59,458. We will save $25,754 for each FCW moved out of DC. Savings due to CLA factor of 29% 4 2018 that each FCW receives in DC
@GinaOrtizJones Do you support https://t.co/dRpDLA7OMe? Either a dweller or drainer - which one are you?

Its time to get serious. Send communications to all Congressional candidates, asking them if they support https://t.co/016TgR4KaJ When they reply, let us know and we will add them to the soon to be posted "Drainer" or "Dweller" list. It's time our reps. stood up and are counted.

@1stOfThe7th Yes &amp; make smaller. Disperse=divide and conquer. Think strategy with end goal - strengthen the Constitutional behavior of Govt. employees. Strategic maneuvers lead to small wins, lead to battle wins, lead to victory - stronger Constitutional Republic for the people by the people.
@1stOfThe7th Moves agencies and departs. out of the "swamp", relocate=draining.. They learn to live with the yous and mes. Reduces need for lobbyist, consultants, influence peddlers, puts them in a more view-able environment. Ultimately reduce number of employees. Harder to collude.
@1stOfThe7th Go to the web site and read a bit. https://t.co/TLvuzNbaEl #DrainTheSwamp

It will soon be time to take similar action domestically and start draining the swamp. Expunge Section 72 Title 4 of the US Code. This is the plug blocking the drain for the swamp.

#dwellersordrainers After yesterday we now have definitive understanding of who is a dweller and who is a drainer. Numbers to follow.

#NationalWalkoutDay I am sorry for all that lost their lives, innocence, were wounded. Something needs to change, its not the Constitution. Maybe better education, sense of self duty, responsibility. Stop blaming inanimate objects for your failures. Take some responsibility.
I think there is a point being missed by these students - it has been students killing students - perhaps they should look in and fix their own house first before they try to change the Constitution. There is a problem in the schools. What it is I'm not sure. #NationalWalkoutDay

@LOhlburg @SenatorCardin Net Neutrality is not neutral favors big government and control over content and the #freemarket, We need to preserve and protect our capitalistic economy and support the defeat of any #NetNeutrality efforts. Please read the details and go beyond  the heading - it is misleading

@RepTimRyan @TuckerCarlson Heard you comment with Congressman Ryan last night @timryan regarding moving agency employees and headquarters out of DC suggest you might look at https://t.co/cfClHBJBEz for some additional thoughts.

Rule 72 is about why we have The Seat of Government concentrated in DC - and why we should change that #DrainTheSwamp #DrainTheDeepState #movethemaxistsoutofDC
Rule72 on this page has nothing to do with finance.
What is rule 72 initiative? It is designed to bring the government closer to the citizens of the United States of America. How do you feel about this?
Now Muller is indicting Russians doesn't he realize that he is employed by US citizens and his focus should be on the USA and protecting our citizens here and that we are not the worlds police persons? Perhaps if he resided outside the DC area he would change his focus.
Perhaps if there were fewer distraction in DC our legislative branch would get their Constitutional mandated work done. #draintheswamp #rule72initiative
