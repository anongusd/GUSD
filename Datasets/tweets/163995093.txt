A draft of the resolution condemning anti-Semitism does NOT specifically mention Rep Ilhan Omar by name but it does spell out remarks she has said regarding Israel.
--&gt; https://t.co/rqYdUwEGKY
As a reminder, last month, House Republicans added language to the Yemen resolution stating that there is no place in America or our nation’s foreign affairs for anti-Semitism after Rep Omar's controversial comments regarding Israel - it passed 424-0 with 2 Rs voting present
House Dem leaders plan to hold a vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism on Wednesday following controversial remarks by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), per a senior democratic aide. This comes after Omar said Israel forces Americans to declare “allegiance to a foreign country"

Speaker Ryan returns from WH and avoids cameras. Did not answer what plan is to fund the government. “You know I don’t talk in the hallways,” he said.

THIS: @PresidentTrump called @SpeakerRyan during the House GOP conference, @kasie and I were told per two sources. One member in the room says Ryan has been gone from the meeting for 20-30 minutes. Unclear what topic but obviously many members are concerned re CR
So basically it seems President Trump needs to tweet that he is actually going to sign this CR to get House GOP members onboard to pass this thing.
That is the “million dollar question or I should say the $5billion dollar question” Rep Mo Brooks told @GarrettHaake when asked if have confidence the President will sign CR.
Departing Rep @carloslcurbelo leaves House GOP conference meeting saying he felt worse than when he went in about CR. No consensus from Rs and no guarantees from leadership that Trump will even sign the CR. Says next DAYS could be messy...
Freedom Caucus Chair Meadows told reporters while he wants Trump to veto the CR, he does NOT think the President actually will. And that while it will be “messy” the CR until Feb 8th will pass and the government won’t shutdown on Friday.

And that’s a wrap: @SpeakerRyan concludes his farewell address to Congress. https://t.co/0r9wUzCtAK
.@SpeakerRyan: “I knew when I took this job, I would become a polarizing figure. It comes with the territory. But one thing I leave most proud of is that I like to think I am the same person now that I was when I arrived.”
.@SpeakerRyan gives a shoutout to his former 2012 running mate @MittRomney calling him “this new fresh-faced guy from Utah…”
During farewell address, @SpeakerRyan hits on three topics that he says he wasn’t able to fix and hopes leaders continue to work on: lifting people out of poverty, entitlement reform, and immigration reform.
Adds: “All of this pulls on the threads of our common humanity, in what could be our unraveling. But nothing says it has to be this way.”
.@SpeakerRyan warning about current state of politics: We spend far more time trying to convict one another than we do developing our own convictions. Being against someone has more currency than being for anything.
.@SpeakerRyan touting his signature achievement: “after years of doubt, years of the cynics saying that it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years.”
.@SpeakerRyan: The people have spoken, and soon the House will become the care of a new majority, and what I know will be a spirited Republican minority. I wish our next leaders well.
After twenty years, @SpeakerRyan is saying goodbye to Congress. https://t.co/rEIhVZembf
An emotional Rep @TGowdySC on @SpeakerRyan: “If I had one pick as a modern day founding father or mother it would be you Paul, of all the people I know in politics, it would be you.”

Rep @TGowdySC introducing @SpeakerRyan at the Library of Congress recounts how Paul Ryan did not want to be Speaker says while “Paul has too much grace and too much class to say this but I do not: I wonder sometimes if we did him a favor when we drafted him to be Speaker.”

And if the government does shutdown after Friday, Meadows doesn’t “think it would open back up until those discussions happen in earnest on a bipartisan basis” in January when Dems take back control.
Meadows opposes another CR: “What makes January any better than December 21st? I’m willing to stay here through Christmas to get it done right on behalf of the American people. And we continue to punt - this is not to anybody’s surprise”
House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said while he thinks there are a number of ways to avoid a government shutdown Friday, he is “NOT very optimistic that Democrats are going to yield in providing $5billion in Wall funding.”
