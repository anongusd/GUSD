@liberalwhisper @bearzus @bigboater88 @RichAmericanDoc @DineshDSouza Don't care. Tyranny of the minority is worse for democracy. The EC will be one of the first things we get rid of after 2020. Count on it.
@liberalwhisper Maybe you are joking, maybe you aren't. This attitude is actually so common in OK that it's not really possible to satirize the situation.
@liberalwhisper Legislature should be scared. Don't care that they are annoyed. Teachers are doing what they believe is right. Too many in this state consider education nothing more than leftist indoctrination, those people should be ignored completely.
@liberalwhisper @bearzus @bigboater88 @RichAmericanDoc @DineshDSouza You are twisting the writing to fit your very modern narrative. Avoiding the tyranny of the majority does not equate to disenfranchising voters because they live in a city.

@BolingKenny Seriously, there's a little under a month left to file. I will immediately volunteer for whoever steps up to run. Someone has to do it. 	  Your whole profile looks like a tease of a potential candidacy. Hope I'm right.
@BolingKenny You should run against faught. He only won by 15 points in 2016.
@caracowanwatts This is interesting. I was born in Oklahoma and also have stories or family lore of Cherokee ancestry, but my family is not in the tribe. I always imagined that this would be fairly common for any family that lived in OK over generations.

@benfelder_okc @CathJSweeney @NewsOKPolitics I think Oklahoma Democrats are wasting a great opportunity this fall. There's really no excuse for these Republicans to be running unopposed, there's still time to recruit candidates. In my district 14, the Democrat only lost by 15 points in 2016.

@YesMomsCan @tribelaw @charlie_savage @DNC Thank you very much.
@YesMomsCan @tribelaw @charlie_savage I live in Muskogee Oklahoma and thank you. Truly appreciate it but this is not how this should work. Honestly, why isn't a volunteer option front and center on the @DNC website. What are they even doing? Am I misunderstanding the function of the @DNC?
@YesMomsCan @tribelaw @charlie_savage @TomPerez To me this is as frustrating as anything coming out of the WH. I know I can't be the only one looking for something, anything to do. So much opportunity being wasted. Wish @TomPerez would address this now. If this is the best the @DNC can do I don't think we stand a chance.
@YesMomsCan @tribelaw @charlie_savage It would be great if the DNC website had way to volunteer. If they do I couldn't find it. Go to the RNC website and it's right there. We should be having massive voter registration drives from now until November. What good is the DNC?
@munchies Brooklyn BBQ would not sell in Oklahoma. https://t.co/SVMsVWzf4E
I just compared the DNC's website to RNC's. I'm interested in volunteering in whatever capacity I can from now until November to help D candidates. It's disappointing to say the least. Why doesn't it seem like the DNC is doing enough?  It's as frustrating as anything else.

@Storment21 @alphabeattweet @Just_SomeChick What exactly is your point, are you seriously crying that what is going on is somehow unfair to the NRA.
@Storment21 @Just_SomeChick NRA itself claims it has five million members. I think it's debateable but fine, take them at their word and say five million. Honestly the numbers speak for themselves. There's over 200 million people of voting age in America.
@Storment21 @Just_SomeChick Some companies simply have the foresight to make the best decisions for their future, and some do not.
@Storment21 @Just_SomeChick It's kowtowing and I don't see it that way at all. This is a free market response to the actual economic realities. It's capitalism and democracy working as they should.

@fyvie2 Why do you think people call you racist anyway?
@fyvie2 When a person says they don't talk about politics to be polite and that same person also says that people call him racist it really isn't that hard to figure out what's going on.
@fyvie2 Probably because it looks like this https://t.co/0mHlrngUZ8
@fyvie2 Give me a break. You offered to discuss things with someone from the other side and a few simple questions later you are all, I don't owe you anything. Hahaha. Wow
@fyvie2 What are you afraid of
@fyvie2 The comment that politics isn't polite discussion material suggests that you are afraid to stand up for what you believe. I'm sure you have no problem discussing politics with people you agree with.
@fyvie2 Because you offered conversations with the other side, then you said people call you racist, then you refused to name or come up with any possible alternative to trump. You refuse any indication of what you believe.
@fyvie2 You seem afraid to stand up for what you believe in.
@fyvie2 I am not being rude and I don't expect to like the answers, I didn't think that was the point. I'm sincerely trying to understand what's going on, and you are the one that offered to have a discussion w/someone from the other side.
@fyvie2 Is there some other possible candidate that you would consider a better choice than trump?
@fyvie2 Ok, so I guess I am going to make some assumptions. Because I think it's curious that you didn't vote in 2016 but now will vote for trump in 2020. I'm guessing that you didn't think he could win? So you didn't bother?
@fyvie2 So you agree with his positions but chose not to vote in 2016? Were you not 18 yet? Just apathetic?
@fyvie2 Ok, I want to talk about something right now. I haven't looked to see, and I won't make assumptions, so I have to ask if you are a trump supporter.

@ASK_THE_BIBLE @williamlegate @SkidMarkiller @Reagan_Latina @mskjdrn @FoxNews I just pointed out a couple of historical empirical facts. Your tweet is the one with labels, not mine.
@ASK_THE_BIBLE @williamlegate @SkidMarkiller @Reagan_Latina @mskjdrn @FoxNews I never said it was my best argument, just that it should be remembered.
@ASK_THE_BIBLE @Reagan_Latina @williamlegate @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews Haven't even mentioned his name until now. And your own to tweet illustrates exactly the point I am making.
@ASK_THE_BIBLE @Reagan_Latina @williamlegate @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews I said the overwhelming majority of Nazi Germany was Christian. I said nothing about Hitler. Now who is lying?

@Reagan_Latina @livingbitter @williamlegate @pat_lee @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews My point is obvious to anyone that can see.
@livingbitter @williamlegate @Reagan_Latina @pat_lee @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews Important to remember that American slave owners were Christians as was the overwhelming majority of Nazi Germany.
@Reagan_Latina @williamlegate @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews I said Nazi Germany was overwhelmingly Christian, it's just a true fact. What Hitler may or may not have been into is not what I said and doesn't really matter. The people who carried out his plan were Christians. Where exactly did you get your degree from, trump u
@Reagan_Latina @williamlegate @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews Never met a right winger who actually knew their history. All of you are dumb non readers or master manipulators and propagandists. There is no in between. Wonder which one you are?
@Reagan_Latina @williamlegate @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @mskjdrn @FoxNews You are the one that needs a history lesson. Germany is now and was then overwhelmingly Christian Catholics. You pretending they were all occultist is intellectually dishonest, it's a lie.
@williamlegate @ASK_THE_BIBLE @SkidMarkiller @Reagan_Latina @mskjdrn @FoxNews Exactly. Slave owners were the conservatives and they called themselves Christians too. Nazi Germany also Christian. No difference between then and now, the same evil forces that animated the slave owners and Nazis is what animates the right wing of today.
@msccust @mattyglesias Were you even born when Dukakis ran? Pretty sure you weren't. I was, so I can pretty definitively say that Warren is nothing like Dukakis. Dukakis was too bookish and cold, closer to John Kerry in personality. Warren connects to people on a personal level.

@studiohq @peterdaou Like I said these attacks are as divisive and unhelpful as anything from the right. This is a losing proposition for Democrats
@peterdaou If you think trying to shame 13 million people into regretting being progressive is at all helpful you have much to learn. Not as smart as you think you are

@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP That's right, you can't. There is no reasonable explanation for it. You have apparently convinced yourself that it didn't happen?
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP So you think it's just perfectly normal for kushner to do what he did? You do understand that no one has denied it?
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP And you won't even try to answer the kushner question.
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP Why were so many meetings with  RU just conveniently forgotten about? Why the multiple retro registering as a foreign agent?

@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP It's hard to know where to even begin but the notion that there is no evidence of collusion is ridiculous.
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP And what about Roger Stone and his wikileaks back channel guccifer 2.0. There was obvious coordination between RU and the GOP.
@schestowitz @wikileaks @realDonaldTrump Why is it BS to believe that Russia and wikileaks are connected?
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP What exactly do you think kushner was trying to when he walked into the RU embassy and asked to use their gear?
@Mr_Cain_Thaler @20committee @GOP That's funny because they will still have a trial, doesn't matter how you feel about it.
