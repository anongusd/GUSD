Feeling more outraged by this each moment.He can certainly have his opinion.R citizens R free 2 express that because that freedom is preserved by those he disparages,but his ignorance &amp; his claims are baffling and wrong. And this guy teaches high school?Not right. https://t.co/aPSyCrCHMl
Such stupidity &amp; ignorance of this so called teacher in CA. regarding the intelligence of men &amp; women serving our country overseas. An outrageous insult to all who have served, including former presidents of the United States. Feeling sad for his students. https://t.co/QNOgXTHWpx
