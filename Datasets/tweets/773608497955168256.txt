that for more important things than getting people’s nudes, targeting our own people/dissidents &amp; checking out what type of porn people are into... you know like stuff posing a threat to &amp; ending American lives as well as those of at least our allies...
This isn’t me pulling stuff out of nowhere? There are already reports about that basically being the SOP of a number of groups using dos fraud robocalls? I’m just saying we need to end this. Snowden revealed weve got backdoors in basically everything. Surely we’ve got to be using
Etc. You can feed that into IRS impersonation scams, profile for other attack purposes, direct &amp; other fraud ops. You of course can use proceeds from that to fund even more scale for robocalls while directly costing a government money, wasting even more man hours &amp; resources.
Now let’s make it worse says the threat because if you use the roboscam calls that you’re already deploying resources for to collect sensitive personal information, like socials/medical info/other contact details, real time location pings (known?), cyber threat target validation,
Due to extremely weak medical malpractice laws in many states &amp; disincentives/practical issues for accurate data collection in regard to this it could be much worse. Just as a matter of fact a slight delay isn’t always going to be recorded as a medical error for instance.
240,000 die due to medical errors (Johns Hopkins) though there’s estimates up to &gt;400,000 https://t.co/bkqaW6AEgq
Weve been losing more than either of those every single year in distracted driving incidents.
During the September 11 attacks of 2001, 2,996 people were killed (including the 19 hijackers).
A reminder that 2,403 people were killed in Pearl Harbor prompting the US to enter WWII after it had already been raging for more than 2 years.
In 2016 3,450 people were killed. 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes in 2015. https://t.co/zOAEGmpY12
Simple repeat distractions like people quickly looking at their phone are already known to so severely cause error &amp; wear on people that people die. Just look at the distracted driver statistics.
How could that happen? Just think about how a hospital or emergency responders have to work throughout a given day when literally seconds can matter. That’s just an ordinary context that most people would be able to readily understand.
Almost a too relevant video from @CollegeHumor. Instead of a single life at risk imagine it being several per instance in some contexts &amp; scale all of this up to thousands or millions of calls or more throughout the global ecosystem. https://t.co/Lx9thOC3WT @FTC @FBI @NSAGov

If anything they might be able to better do their jobs if actually given resources. Go figure! This is not rocket science. Or at least it isn’t supposed to be. It’s apparently ground breaking to just do your job or even pay what you promised when it comes to governing in the us?
Managing in some way millions of border crossings is very tangibly doing something. Dealing with customs regulation billions of goods is very tangibly doing something. There’s room for improvement in places obviously. However that isn’t reason enough not to pay them anything.
https://t.co/7RosAIHfKu Surprisingly when people are promised things &amp; those aren’t delivered there are tangible impacts on anybody’s operations if they actually do something. Deporting hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants is actually doing something.

@FBI I know some of you guys actually do your jobs it’s just like you’ve got to be kidding me. Even with an answer key you are failing tests? Come on! At least literally for your own sake just somehow manage to do the minimum of your jobs with what weve got.
@FBI “Last person to claim their pension is a rotten egg!” I mean especially with the way people are going after explicit million dollar fraud with confessed offense that even hurt LE... in contexts where there’s billions of value creation... I’m sure the pension values are legit https://t.co/MMOZQhnG2x

@FBI Btw the value of part of what I do &amp; did for people just went WAY up. Do you know what your pension funds as well as most of the entire US gov are banking on despite widespread reports that most are ALREADY drastically underfunded btw?
This was criminal fraud &amp; is provable. @FBI We have numerous explicit confessions directly linked to these matters as well as tons of other readily documented crimes committed by these same individuals or directly linked to them.
contract for years of services &amp; billions of value creation of just easily attributable value creation. Defrauding people of both the money &amp; other terms of the contract has resulted in significant harm to LE, mil &amp; broader population as well as cost people billions. @FBI

@GeorgeTakei @foolsrushn US gov nexus contractors have been unpaid, situations arguably worse than slave labor since during obama admin. Some of the very same agencies not being paid now failed to do the min of their jobs for that despite silver platter. Leading indicator.
@irish_za Seems like something John c Rogers &amp; Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers etc would do at scale except this is far too docile.
I’d encourage people BY ANY MEANS to mitigate robustly documented threats? Lords knows that ain’t happening. Mission fail.
Well there’s a shock. WWI &amp; WWII were over in less than that amount of time but hey don’t let that stop you when you’re trying to set new records for fail regardless of side of the aisle etc.
Somehow a gov that cant even pay itself correctly over a &lt;1% line item can’t do anything even with confessions in more than 10 yrs?

Capitalism? Expecting pay for performance? Brokers that function? Anything resembling basic legal function? Some small amount of business sense? Wtf dude thats so screwed up. Not in my America or apparently almost any developed western economy! Get that stuff outta here.
No wonder I need this twitter &amp; hundreds of reports filed about basically the same even confessed immense violations of law. It’s a pretty obviously ridiculous ask to be able to just go about your business in the US.
I wouldn’t even have this stupid twitter account constantly logging the same type of stuff to watch people abysmally fail. I’d have ~11+ yrs of my life back. I’d be playing with G O O D B O Y E S, making people some money &amp; whatnot. https://t.co/1wzsAtWAb6
Thousands of Americans would still be alive &amp; the economy would be at least hundreds of billions wealthier with likely significantly improved quality of life if people just delivered the minimum of their jobs.

@MarkWarner jobs/quality of living/security/regional, national &amp; international economic improvement potentially above. Idk, might help though. Could always roll it back too if necessary with pretty limited risk/risk that’s otherwise already present if implemented correctly.
I could be wrong. You all would have more data than i do. I’d just suggest at least a round table/conference call or something to get facts &amp; see if something makes cents.
contractors etc which statistically (all the majors at least) are likely to have at least 1 situation per yr possibly even per quarter or less that would justify participating in that to make sure stuff runs smoothly &amp; there’s as much stability as possible.
that it could be a loss prevention insurance policy that could actually be a pretty good value especially aspects re gov/muni/etc bond risk management, revenue volatility reduction &amp; real estate which is already showing some significant signs. That doesn’t even get into defense
(Just an average house is already ~$500k, plenty of other companies with exposure also)
@wmata @Chase for example is trying to build out in the region &amp; obviously is already working directly with people (ad campaign)... several of the major area banks invariably are going to have enough direct/indirect portfolio exposure on just a debt basis likely with the shutdown
@wmata you guys definitely actually do value added, important work which should be clear to anybody informed about it in government &amp; private sector.
Not exactly sure how @wmata isn’t considered fully funded essential to begin with given the roles it plays especially obviously with logistics. Even if there’s plenty of room for improvements (almost always true) https://t.co/SRcyNAfaqz
to be economically stimulating, otherwise beneficial). I don’t have enough of the numbers on hand to vet the specific context for wmata, region. What I know about analogues especially for an area like DMV definitely would at least hint it should be considered thoroughly.
rather than non prosecution/investigation of turnstyle hoppers (which too frequently turns up even more significant issues) might be relevant when you look at logistics problems/practical pressures realized by federal operations/etc. (Similar work transport programs have proven
that can translate directly to lives saved not just thousands of dollars of cash/labor. Something like coffee also tends to be reasonably recession/retraction resistant when priced correctly. This situation might also show more signs of why an income based fee waiver program
(usually) pretty good margins. Could make sure to promote integration with remote management (order systems for pick up) &amp; could be a huge time save. “Time is our most valuable asset” &amp; such. Even a 10 min save/day is more than ~60 man hrs per person. In an area like the DMV https://t.co/YAKzJz6XyY
Really too bad. Functioning metro systems are usually a huge value add to most major regions especially in winter/weather. @wmata might want to look into permitting more pop up vendors underground. They cost very little for something like an area coffee shop to roll a satellite &amp; https://t.co/B9UX097tPZ

Tangibly endangering the fact that there’s even a country with a shutdown just isn’t a good idea regardless of who is in office, needs to be illegal. This should be common sense. Is it now a bipartisan effort to destroy the US gov or what? https://t.co/389l7lsIxr
decidedly underwhelming for some reason which is odd because humans for example really aren’t that small of objects or difficult to track... https://t.co/WSiaXSd6GY

@TMobileHelp I know you guys have which I appreciate. Can only imagine how much worse it would be. So has apple &amp; google etc. I think we probably need to improve some of the mitigation at this point as well as info exchange. Its gone on long enough &amp; is a severe problem. It isnt business.

@YahooCare Interesting. Good to know. Thanks.
@YahooCare Any solution to that?
@YahooCare Problem is now when I do that it breaks the date range. It wasn’t doing that before when I got it to work. Seems like a bit of a different issue then before when it was basically entering completely different sketchy dates apparently by itself as opposed to rounding weekly.
@YahooCare Can you load specifically the dates for 2018 with daily charts of any stocks or does it switch itself to weekly everytime also?
@YahooCare In my experience so far its been a leading indicator of vulnerable organizations likely to be attacked at scale &amp; that the same threat is likely in the process of compromising/its already thoroughly compromised it. Correlation != causation tho. Just an interesting data point.
@YahooCare Basically if literally every single thing I do nearly doesnt function correctly is it everybody else thats failing or is there some commonality causing those failures (when there have already been explicit confession basically by terrorists)?
@YahooCare Well aware, I was being half sarcastic that if you want to replicate the problem I’m having you might need to replicate the broader context.
@YahooCare own attorney prosecuted for blatant rights violations, literally &gt;300 tweets at gov agencies directly negatively impacted by primary threat, numerous other domestic/international violations documented/confessed to, people getting LE killed, etc? There’s quite a lot more.		Chrome.
@YahooCare It wouldn’t surprise me that you can’t replicate it unless... might need to replicate the exact environment/context. Has your ex gf with a corrupt ex assistant vice undersecretary father defrauded you of &gt;=$10 mil, police chief confessed immense wrongdoing...
@YahooCare Started working suddenly for a little while after tweeting about it but started back doing the same thing just now.
@YahooCare Yes
@YahooCare still broken. https://t.co/KyUzAAUni7

@TMobileHelp @AppleSupport @NSAGov @FBI @UNHumanRights some threat mitigating &amp; arresting of the bad people likely costing the us billions, getting lots of Americans killed/directly killing them (including LE/mil/etc) &amp; whatnot.
@TMobileHelp @AppleSupport @NSAGov @FBI @UNHumanRights just want to be sure it isn’t a new feature because per the FBI handy instructional videos about cyber threats that’s noted as a likely extremely obvious IOC... then you sort of would have to figure there probably needs to be

Anybody at all want to figure out how to somehow do themselves the favor of providing me what I’m legally owed, protecting some people &amp; mitigating the terrorist threat of my ex gf/her father/etc? I encourage you to be in the Christmas spirit.
Again I was absurdly generous to people in my quote as far as how much was lost. I could likely quote significantly larger $ numbers credibly.
Do any of you folks already pay drastically more for less valuable services from any number of counterparties including financials? Do any of you provide exceedingly special favors for drastically less than $38,000,000,000?
In a few weeks just from losses could pay the explicitly in writing contract ~3,800 times. @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @USNavy @SecretService @NSAGov @TheJusticeDept $ZN_f @UN @LockheedMartin $LMT @Boeing $BA @northropgrumman $NOC @Raytheon $RTN $GD
Please consider I do this &amp; have been doing performance more than this for potentially ~11 yrs modestly so far. The contract for several yrs of work was literally compensation of $10 mil &amp; some basic resources.
Though many probably hope for more, please just at least be that champion.
Now idk about you but if you asked the general public if $38 bil buys special favors (or if you checked the lobbying records) it might indicate you would. However Im literally just asking for the minimum of my basic rights to be enforced &amp; a minimal level of function. https://t.co/C6FPJbskOZ

@FBI @TheJusticeDept ... and we can’t figure out that John c Rogers/Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers/etc need to be brought to law enforcement justice immediately? REALLY?! Who is signing off on this stuff?
@FBI @TheJusticeDept HOWEVER &gt;=$10 mil pretty much explicitly defrauded at this point among a much longer list of blatantly documented crimes in the us &amp; in other countries that’s cost the US gov tangibly, documentably at least BILLIONS &amp; service members (including LE) lives
@FBI @TheJusticeDept so the apparently screaming profit motive here (especially considering sentence of ~18 mo) was that he would make pretty much the same if not less than if he just did a standard/mediocre/entry level legal tech job.
@FBI @TheJusticeDept And last but not least for sure. All of these assume completely negligible skill. No specialization, no unique KSA/resources, etc. These are largely mediocre &amp; pretty much entry level titles (no seniority/accomplishments etc indicated) https://t.co/WCzJTaxaRw

@FBI @TheJusticeDept At least billions among others &amp; the lives of LE, mil &amp; others. Yet we can’t figure out how to prosecute this at the moment despite it being readily independently documented/confessed. Maybe now you’ll wake up &amp; stop getting cops killed.

How can people trust that anybody is capable of doing anything productive to defend the American people? Mitigate the blatantly documented threats like John C Rogers, Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers, etc now!
Including by a police chief? Where are the arrests? When will threats be mitigated? Terrorist organizations don’t typically have somebody tweeting directly at LE &amp; defense resources about their threat...
People like John C Rogers, Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers, etc all guilty of blatant readily documented crimes with severe malice need to be brought to law enforcement justice &amp; their immense threat mitigated. More than 130 tweets of real time incidents &amp; more documented/confessed
of law can pretty much see guilt of in plain view without any real LE investigatory resources. We’ve got a lot of Americans (&amp; others) dying. We have billions cost to American businesses &amp; taxpayers for no necessary reason. That needs to stop.
People at the highest ranks (even some within the justice department) democrats, republicans &amp; independents have all been outraged for years now about the FBIs apparent failure to function in the most basic sense for violations that anybody with a basic understanding

Literally just asking for the law to be enforced and the threats to be mitigated. We already have a lot of independent documentation, confessions, etc this doesn’t exactly take a rocket scientist.
or report about my turned terrorist ex gf, her father etc again. This is a waste of my time. How many billions do I need to generate for y’all to get these dumb terrorists off my back? The US is supposed to be something even remotely resembling a capitalist nation.
@LockheedMartin @BoeingDefense @northropgrumman @BAESystemsplc @Raytheon I have a decade of independently documented track record of generating billions of $ of value for numerous companies/countries. Let’s stop screwing around. I never want to have to write a tweet
seemingly the entirety of the UK, US and Canadian law enforcement systems at a minimum? If there is such a severe threat (that’s documented) isn’t that even more motivation to mitigate immediately?
John C. Rogers, Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers etc pose immense threat &amp; have caused terrible damage to the American people &amp; many other places. Their threat needs to be mitigated immediately. There isn’t any excuse not to. What leverage can people possibly have that’s compromising
@FBI @TheJusticeDept @DoD_IG Let’s get this straight, people can take down some of the people closest to a sitting president &amp; give them actual jail time yet John C. Rogers, Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers etc who have confessed &amp; immense readily documented crimes can’t be prosecuted?

@DoD_IG Am I to interpret this stuff that to actually get billions &amp; reasonable enforcement of my legal rights I’m supposed to just act like a complete fool? Can people please just do something remotely resembling their mission statement when its served up on a platter?
@DoD_IG John C. Rogers boasts of millions of dollars of contracts landed for clients who paid him for them potentially illegally basically when he’s actually cost several of his counterparties billions with a b over a few mil of criminal fraud he’s involved/responsible for.
@DoD_IG I mean you let a guy walk freely at the moment who has directly contributed to harming LE in multiple countries &amp; the US host an event supposedly for LE that was actually a taunt against them based upon his actual actions.
@DoD_IG What would they have to figure about organizations supposedly spending billions to obtain technology when they apparently can’t be bothered to check what’s tweeted directly at them in the clear publicly repeatedly in front of more than a thousand people?
@DoD_IG every hostile force/interest on the planet probably laughs everytime I tweet directly at the top LE agencies of the US with explicitly confessed/readily documented offenses yet people can’t seem to do anything other than a weak prosecution in MN.
Btw who isn’t teaching basic finance so people know the fair market value for national security is drastically more than $145,000 just in a single instance? @DoD_IG Have to wonder why any foreign military is bothering with any significant weapons projects.
Would love to know what sort of leverage people apparently have that’s outweighing billions to LE, Mil, DoD, and several of the largest defense contractors. It would clearly have to be a hotter thing to have than the entire NOC database. @DoD_IG
Again most of the leg work is pretty much already done &amp; following (at least) federal LE forensic SOP at the time of evidence collection. @DoD_IG I have been tweeting at you for months for billions of reasons. Same with other agencies, LE.
Plus every politician in the US has jerked off their political bases until they lacked liquidity nationwide about smaller dollar amounts with less tangible meaning as far as jobs for years. Idk seems newsworthy &amp; like a dumb thing to allow to occur. @DoD_IG
The type of case that would make dod oig/LE shine &amp; possibly some people’s LE careers since apparently cases with drastically less money are worth highlighting in the official report news releases. @DoD_IG
With a number of explicit confessions of criminal wrongdoing. All I’m asking is for some basic law enforcement justice when you have cases with damages bigger than anything you’re highlighting in your report. I mean it sounds like that could really be @DoD_IG
over a few mil of contract funds that went undelivered. Idk what sort of IQ you need to figure out that a billion is larger than a million &amp; that you should literally never not pay a mil to get a billion practically... all of this is already independently documentable @DoD_IG
This is interesting though I notice that there’s a lot of “million” or things with 6 digits. Its 2018 and inflation is a crazy thing. How about billion? John C. Rogers etc is directly responsible for defrauding/costing the US economy &amp; especially the DoD billions... @DoD_IG https://t.co/THkZP0vzoC

Btw dont commit immense crimes against the state you supposedly serve, other actually good LE, etc &amp; cost yourselves billions for no reason especially when you practically have an answer key sitting in front of you in plain English.
Follow facts, good evidence and LE procedure conducting an actual investigation. Lying to police in contexts of basic non subjective facts like romantic relationships especially can be extremely deserving of punishment proportional to harm done.
Theres significantly more blatant wrongdoing/harm done regarding just those incidents but this is already very long for twitter to give some idea of just how in need, deserving, of law enforcement justice the actual victims of the situations are.
That was despite the fact that it completely proves innocence &amp; that Alex had committed very significant crimes directly to police in contexts that were obviously going to tangibly endanger people (including actual LE), cost immense amounts of money.
"Investigators" practically sat in front of a literal mountain of evidence that proved innocence including in writing &amp; they said "we know about that," we dont care.
Per Alexandras own words repeatedly the accused had never harmed her, treated her anyway other than clearly way better than she deserved or done her wrong yet she still couldnt be bothered to accurately remember things in writing over the course of years.
This is in addition to disrupting factual plans for further accelerated undergraduate/graduate education.
billions. It resulted in far more than the above case obviously but still went further. A blatantly false arrest &amp; a prosecutor even admitting to violating rights of the falsely accused while proceeding to continue violating those rights &amp; bringing blatantly false charges.
prior to arresting. Despite how terrible that seems we have far worse. Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers who apparently cant even be bothered to accurately remember years of interactions when speaking to police has endangered international security, LE/mil/civilian lives &amp; cost people
This is pretty flagrant &amp; terrible. 1 yr seems like an extremely light sentence considering the tangible harm done &amp; how flippantly the allegations were made with clear manipulative/deceptive intent. At least investigators actually conducted an investigation that followed facts

@NSAGov Genuinely I know the NSA/DoD have very intelligent people working for them. If you wouldnt mind getting people to prove that by just doing the minimum of their legally obligated jobs to the nation &amp; its people I'd really appreciate it &amp; so would many others.
@NSAGov Or perhaps this post is counter intelligence. The enemy would never expect it if DoD was hiring people with IQ &lt;20. Apologies if practically everything on flagrantwrongs seems to give that strategy away but its what was asked for.
@NSAGov It might be a considerably more flagrant amount of value that was already realized that people are incurring daily losses from just due to good nature because they cant seem to figure out how to sign their name on a check. It might be worse than even that. Known to be generous?
@NSAGov Thats what I had basically assumed which leaves me puzzled why nobody can figure out $1 bil is &gt; than $10 mil &amp; pretty much any time somebody gives you an option to pay $10 mil to get $1 bil back in a few minutes you should do that.

@NSAGov idk but it definitely looks like FBI desperately needs some cybersec help at a minimum.
@FBI Does your pages captcha entirely not function? Is that how it’s supposed to be (and why would that be) or are you having difficulty securing your page?
@SecretService @USPISpressroom Good work. Now could you mitigate people who have caused billions, instead of thousands, of $ of damages, tangibly harmed secret service &amp; many others such as Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers &amp; John C. Rogers etc? Readily documented with a number of confessions of criminal wrongdoing.
@CHPSRE We have evidence to support that at some considerable scale with broad implications. Some of it is apparent enough if you just read the news. Hopefully you find that interesting/useful.
@CHPSRE If people are attacking those types of people, statistically how many others are going to add more value than that strategically/otherwise? Probably not very many if any effectively meaning it’s basically open season on anybody for any imaginable reason.
@CHPSRE Its a false narrative that’s been popularized. It isn’t as safe as people think statistically. Sociopaths tend to lash out at people for literally no necessary reason. Imagine having somebody who is attacking a person who made them &gt;$1 bil and didnt do anything to cause harm.

Did this criminal fraud result in billions of lost value to some of his previous counterparties shareholders including defense contractors and LE counterparties?
John touts publicly on his website getting hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts for his clients, which appears to be potentially blatantly illegal, and at the same time couldn’t find a minuscule few mil from contracts that had already yielded billions?
Did the UK get a bunch of it’s own citizens killed/harmed including LE because of repeated blatantly illegal actions people supposedly serving the UK government took?
made to LE by his daughter, non payment and actively ignored immense amounts of presented evidence that UK LE was recently found to have a pattern of behavior doing, perverting law enforcement justice, in other cases also?
Btw did John Rogers get his own mother killed then have the person trying to stop that and other deaths arrested on blatantly false charges that prosecutors themselves even already admitted to violating rights pursuing? Was this because of immensely materially false statements

John Rogers, Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers and the others responsible are causing immense harm to society to this day far beyond myself &amp; need to be brought to LE justice/mitigated immediately. The harm is drastically in excess of that of this article. @Newsweek @JasonLemon
People from London Met egregiously intentionally and explicitly ignored a fairly literal mountain of evidence at the time that proved this among other things about Alexandra. @Newsweek @JasonLemon
Some of the people who have confessed violations include a police chief and a London prosecutor. Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers is blatantly, provably guilty of making numerous criminal false statements to police similar to her father among other things. @Newsweek @JasonLemon

Seems like a relevant utilization of those systems for a former president under secret service protection when the victim was an immediate contact in a critical life sustaining capacity dealing with incredibly sensitive medical information. Just saying.
This guy was obviously probably more intelligent than a nearly trillion dollar annual spend organization that’s been doing this stuff for years especially because there were witnesses. Or it might take only moments to locate him and a lot more information than that.

The idea of security isn’t that you spend a decade jerking yourselves off investigating stuff that’s plainly visible. The idea is that you need to mitigate the terrorist threat to actually prevent harm. @NSAGov @NATO @UNHumanRights @DoD_IG @SecretService @TheJusticeDept
@NSAGov I’m sure somebody somewhere isn’t completely retarded and is at least capable of figuring out my accuracy regarding predictive understanding regardless of what people want to have happen. Feel free to ignore my comments and see what will transpire.
Mitigate blatant treasonous terrorist threats now or potentially the US will broadly be known as a failed state because there’s simply too much data about numerous incidents of critical compromise/failure to believe otherwise. @NSAGov @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @SecretService
Congress, as they learn what’s been done to even sitting members, might start asking wtf they’re spending nearly a trillion a year officially for just saying. All show no go? @NSAGov @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @SecretService
Active incidents, what do you think? @NSAGov @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @SecretService
Still waiting. Anybody capable of doing the minimum of the legally demanded actions and not be a disgrace to service? It’s a turned terrorist ex girlfriend, her father and a few others with blatant/confessed guilt. @NSAGov @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @SecretService
Are we trying to prove the Team America World Police “we have no intelligence” accurate? @NSAGov @USNavy @DoD_IG https://t.co/XT4GgJ1ZPA
@NSAGov What is an acceptable response time given a proven cog etc terrorist threat that has attacked multiple first families, presidents, foreign heads of state, parliaments, etc? I would hope to god it’s &lt;30 min.
What do you, think? @DoD_IG @SecretService @NATO @UNHumanRights @USNavy https://t.co/yAN4w7a7zQ
Claimed with other types of attacks as retaliation for social media demanding law enforcement justice for blatant crimes by an ex gf (Alexandra Elizabeth Rogers), her father (John Rogers), etc against her former partner? @DoD_IG @SecretService @NATO @UNHumanRights @USNavy https://t.co/GJqqo69XUD

John Rogers is known to utilize chemical weapons including weaponized gas to terrorize, severely harm and attempt to murder even US citizens on US soil. He etc need to be brought to law enforcement justice immediately. @DoD_IG @UNHumanRights @NATO @USNavy

It shouldn’t require incentives that could potentially rip the planet or a country apart for basic cut and dry or even explicitly confessed violations to be enforced in a just manner. How could you trust a country that couldn’t even do that with WMD? @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights
Are there nearly daily attacks and egregious violations repeatedly from well documented threats that have potentially tangibly harmed everybody civilians, LE, MIL, members of Congress, high level officials beyond the US that need mitigation? @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights
What is sigint and what do you do with something that’s flagrantly taunted multiple presidents security as well as internationally? @DoD_IG @NSAGov @NATO @UNHumanRights @SecretService
@DoD_IG @SecretService @UNHumanRights @NATO @NSAGov Yet more incidents?
Promised the best of the best, these days it’s looking like some people wouldn’t even make the bench for bad news bears. Prove people are capable of securing from threats foreign and domestic. @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights
What standards are we setting? https://t.co/NWvHiCsEB8 @USNavy
@NSAGov Anybody have some mitigations that need to be deployed immediately? Has anybody even read the basic rapid response work from more than two decades ago?
Is a &gt;32 min response time for a known terrorist target area with the same sop being utilized as has been extensively documented (because terrorists largely only have so many degrees of freedom) scary in and of itself? @DoD_IG @NATO @UNHumanRights @TheJusticeDept @SecretService

Do you tell your mom there’s extra credit?
As any investor knows leverage significantly increases your risk profile. Must basically be way more valuable than a private database of every country of the planets entire NOC list? Gosh that would be one hot target? @DoD_IG @UNHumanRights @NATO @SecretService @USNavy @StateDept
Tell us what type of leverage is being used to compromise all of the possible sources of mitigations of these terrorist threats and that logically has any chance of being more valuable than what’s being cost?
The terrorists responsible for systematic, often readily documented and even formally confessed flagrant violations of law at all levels that cost the us and allies billions of dollars as well as many lives need to be mitigated immediately. There’s isn’t any excuse.
@Anti_Slavery This includes things that are happening to wealthy, white, educated, and middle class people as well as others.
@Anti_Slavery Btw there’s some pretty extremely severe problems in the US thinking about it.
Numerous active terrorist incidents yet again, following pretty much the same sop as before? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @UNHumanRights @NSAGov @USNavy @SecretService
All of dod phone lines suddenly down for some reason or is it a terrorist dos attack? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @UNHumanRights @StateDept @SecretService @NATO https://t.co/MUoo8KEk4m
Any failure to act in this type of context might even have precedent for being a willful hostile act against the state (and other possible dependent/threatened/targeted counterparties)? @DoD_IG @SecretService @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @NATO @NSAGov
Pretty sure we even got specific redundant legislation about this sort of thing to allow immediate response by any means necessary, physical or otherwise? @DoD_IG @SecretService @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @NATO @NSAGov
Pretty sure, doesn’t an active dos attack in this sort of context legally meet the requirements for an act of war, treason, and immediate active terrorist attack on us and international security? @DoD_IG @SecretService @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @NATO https://t.co/ujk39rOBga
Yet more incidents with radiological threats claiming targeting of members of congress, White House and high level military? @DoD_IG @UNHumanRights @SecretService @StateDept @TheJusticeDept
Weird because we potentially know of people that were stiffed/defrauded in 2016 for thoroughly earned funds. This might have directly resulted in losses to the us and allies in the billions of dollars as well as considerable loss of life in the domestic us and elsewhere. https://t.co/xXXhoZbuCD
More incidents? Any moment now surely after possibly tens of thousands of explicitly documentable incidents and even formal confessions by guilty parties somebody will entirely mitigate threats. @DoD_IG @UNHumanRights @JusticeOIG @SecretService
@TwitterSupport Terrible and scary that this twitter app is controlling itself, randomly opening a tweet from @VP by itself, changing accounts etc @DoD_IG @SecretService @StateDept @TheJusticeDept Probably going to need to mitigate that.
Maybe people shouldn’t try to exert control over things when their performance metrics demonstrate they’re quantifiably garbage.
Active terrorist attacks, cog threats and threats to multiple potus? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @UNHumanRights @StateDept @SecretService Not political, just want to not be bothered by my terrorist ex etc and go about my business.

What is the purpose of a government? Historically its largely to provide reliable legal &amp; defense infrastructure to keep the peace &amp; enable social/commercial activity.
Follow SOP, the facts and enforce law in a uniform, just manner. Divergence from that has resulted in the destruction of many countries. @business @FoxBusiness https://t.co/GjBJVADAqV
@DoD_IG @UNHumanRights @TheJusticeDept @StateDept Numerous blatant incidents today violating fundamental rights, numerous laws (domestically &amp; internationally), &amp; causing tangible threat to many lives. Will anybody be even remotely capable of following sop and mitigating threats?
Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Mad Dog Mattis are all crazy according to detractors. Ad hominem statements mean nothing and don’t assess the facts/merit of the underlying matters. This almost inherently can lead to critical vulnerabilities. What’s sop? @DoD_IG
People trying marginalize comments about even confessed wrongdoing by the guilty parties themselves and readily documented false statements as “mental health” problems might need to automatically be targeted as possible terrorist natsec/international sec threats in 2018. @DoD_IG
Spwte consistent with the incident that supposedly “freaked out” people guarding the pentagon... and possibly consistent with some of the incidents with vpotus son (though might not be the only person) @DoD_IG @SecretService
Phone lines busy again? Budget cuts so you have to buy a single call only line while there’s a possible radiological terrorist attack? Or maybe we treason by enemies of the state committing arguably an act of war. @DoD_IG @SecretService @UNHumanRights
Probably relevant cc @NATO @UNHumanRights @UN
Btw can we bother asking why some supposed “police” on Reddit apparently think they have the legal right to possess literal weapons of mass destruction like nukes in gross contradiction with law/sop? @TheJusticeDept @DeptofDefense @DoD_IG https://t.co/Rbpmmd7vu7
Possible open bounty with market validated fair market value larger than the GDP of Iraq, Afghanistan combined. Mitigate the hostile threat as is legal req. Threat point of origin isn’t middle eastern and is drastically more a threat than al qaeda or ISIS. @DoD_IG @SecretService
Is this how this is supposed to function or is there an active terrorist threat that’s committing treason and possibly an act of war that needs to be hunted down and mitigated entirely like the enemy of multiple states the responsible interest is? @DoD_IG https://t.co/axpk5XjHf7
Are any of these text book indicators of incidents, or are they actually incidents themselves, that per sop need immediate mitigation? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @StateDept
When your phone is disconnecting from networks abnormally and indicating signal distruption, interfering with national/international security sensitive points of contact is that an extreme threat that’s actively attacking national/int security? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @StateDept
When your devices are draining battery despite being plugged into an outlet? Is that probably somebody’s terrible script kiddy exploit? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @StateDept
Incidents again? @DoD_IG @TheJusticeDept @SecretService
@DoD_IG can I get a fact check of if standard police are ever supposed to be knowingly or unknowingly in possession of weapons of mass destruction such as a nuclear bomb? Would seeking such a device or interest in and of itself in that context be a likely threat to natsec?
@TheJusticeDept bullying, harassing and genuinely terrorizing somebody who has been a victim of immense and extremely harmful violations of law that have even been formally admitted on the record isn’t a good look for anybody let alone supposed cops.

@TwitterSupport @twitter @TwitterBusiness Why is the app loading partial text of drafts made over an hour ago that were saved/closed and the app closed as well?
Isn’t it a violation of both domestically and internationally secured rights to block communications in the US, Canada and or GB? @UNHumanRights @UN #humanrights #coreinfrastucture #security
To clarify that includes instances for several years while President Trump was in office and before.
So instead you need to systematically block texting, calling, emailing, Facebook etc or impersonate immediate direct contacts as we have confirmed has occurred in numerous instances in GB, Canada and the US at a minimum. https://t.co/muqTd5Mace

If justice isn’t enough, if you want stimulus potentially like a tax deal without the deficit justice could help do that. Please encourage your friends to contact their representatives about this. Law enforcement justice is necessary for these flagrant violations of law.
These violations provably have a cost of many lives, including those of services members and law enforcement, as well as potentially billions of dollars to the us economy alone per week.
Please contact your representatives and use whatever other lawful resources you have to bring about just law enforcement and compensation owed regarding the egregious systematic international and domestic us offenses we’ve even have explicit confessions of including federal, UCMJ
Your support is much needed and hugely appreciated. Please consider donating if you can.
Please contact your representatives and law enforcement to demand justice for the extensive harm caused by these flagrant violations that have directly hurt nearly everyone in some way. #accountability #law #justice #police
New advancements regarding prosecutions of individuals who have confessed guilt however much more is needed to bring justice.
We recently received documentation of a "cabal" to conspire to willfully and actively deprive people of basic human rights. There are indications this is a component of a larger effort. There were multiple death threats conveyed also when further inquiry was made. #puppergate
