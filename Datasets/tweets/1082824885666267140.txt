2/2. person's lack of life experience, education or plain ignorance is ineffective and often unfair. Is it Admiration vs condemnation? Educate and learn so the past does not remain our present.
1/2  We believe that the human race has indeed learned many things compared to 10 years ago, 20 or more years ago. What was done before without education, learning and experience would not bring us into today albeit a slow process. That was Then; This is now.
What has happened to Due process before ousting anyone from any position politically or in government  etc.? No reports, no evidence,  no arrests or arraignments, no trials, no sentencings so why should any one of us expect anyone to resign any positions without the right to dp.
The abortion card is politically played to create divide and for political gain. Remove the abortion card and you are left with what God has given to each person by free will choice, which is simply right or wrong  which is and should be between that person and God.
