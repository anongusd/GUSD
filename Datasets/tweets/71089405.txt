Food banks simply cannot make up for the loss of SNAP benefits. For every meal provided by the national network of food banks, SNAP provides 12. &gt;&gt;
We also know that our effort pales in comparison to the strength and breadth of federal nutrition programs—especially SNAP, or food stamps, which provides food to 615,000 Oregonians (and bolsters our local economies). &gt;&gt;
We will continue to serve the 260,000 Oregonians who count on us each month to help them have enough to eat to be healthy and successful. &gt;&gt;
The shutdown has highlighted what we have long known: that millions of Americans are literally one paycheck away from needing assistance to make ends meet. &gt;&gt;
We and our statewide network of food banks, partners and programs serving Oregon and Clark County, Washington are RELIEVED that President Trump and Congress are reaching a temporary agreement and reopening the government through February 15 – so that hunger doesn’t get worse. &gt;&gt;

Laws, policies, and practices that deny lived-experiences, identity, and humanity, such as those the administration has proposed, further marginalize communities, which in turn, increases food insecurity.  https://t.co/7qy9Wj7Si4 https://t.co/tpWubZsk7s

"By joining us here today you have stepped up, you have joined us &amp; you have taken action. By joining us here today, you are supporting our neighbors in need, lifting up your community. By joining us here today, you are doing something good and right."
"is hunger decreasing in Oregon? Yes! … but we still need you." #HungerActionDay
"What keeps me and everyone at Oregon Food Bank going is the vision that we’ll get to the point where no one needs food assistance, where hunger doesn’t exist."
"We are getting a massive influx of commodities from the US Government and we are excited but at the same time Congress is threatening to cut #SNAP. Most people on SNAP are children, seniors and people with disabilities."
"More people than ever are being screened for food insecurity by their healthcare provider, and offered resources at that point of care."
"More hungry people in Oregon now have access to healthy, nutrient-rich food. Fresh fruits and vegetables made up more than one third of the 100 million pounds of food we distributed to 1,200 partners and programs across the state last year."
"Oregon Food Bank is also officially and publicly opposing Measure 105. Measure 105 would give state and local law enforcement agencies the ability to stop, detain and interrogate any Oregonian solely on the basis to request proof of citizenship."
"Our data reveals a greater percentage of Latinx in Oregon are employed, yet they are more likely to live at or below the Federal Poverty Level – through our data collection, we see that an astounding 75% of Latinx households are living below the Federal Poverty Line."
"We have heard directly from our clients – that affordable housing is a critical step towards ensuring our neighbors don’t have to make the difficult decision between rent and food. We hope you will vote in favor of housing measures."  @YesForHousing
"but the number of people living at the Federal Poverty Level remains unchanged. And we haven't reached pre-recession levels."

We call on those who voted for the bill, @repgregwalden &amp; @HerreraBeutler, to reject proposals in 2018 &amp; beyond that cut food assistance, health coverage, &amp; other programs that would further hurt everyday Americans. /end
Last, it will lead to 13 million more people losing the protection of health insurance AND a 10 percent increase in health care premiums for those who participate in the individual market. /3
It could dramatically lower contributions to food banks &amp; similar charities—the very organizations that people who have lost assistance will be forced to turn to. /2
We are deeply troubled by the passage of the federal #taxbill. The bill will scarcely benefit those we serve. It raises the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion &amp; creates pressure to cut programs that are critical in the fight against #hunger. /1
