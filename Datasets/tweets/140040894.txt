@Margoandhow Will the lawyers still get paid at all if the govt takes everything under RICO? If they find that the real business of the Trump Organization is not building properties, but rather laundering money for the Russians, the Trumps will be fined all they have. #PleaDealForResignation

P.S. What would the implications be for Trump's kids? He really is a monster.
Clearly, he cannot actually end birthright citizenship. That‚Äôs not what this means. This means that he‚Äôs having some sort of a psychiatric event in which he believes he has achieved dictator status. It also means that he has no adviser who can make him STFU, even to save himself. https://t.co/vR2F9w0g0X
