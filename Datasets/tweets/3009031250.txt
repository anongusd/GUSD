@MichaelAvenatti @realDoanldTramp Michael Cohen wasn't just an Attorney at the Trump "Ponzie Scheme  Laundromat" Tower. He was Trump's personal Atty. One of the "good people," he hires. Trump's dumber than a 5th grader, seriously.
@Lawrence @MichaelAvenatti I guy name lindsey ain't got much credibility  @LindseyGrahamSC you are supporting a PRESIDENT that had Unprotected sex with a PORN STAR while his wife was at home with his newborn child. That's disgusting Lyndsey. The @GOP has hit rock bottom. You should be ashamed. #Disgusting
@Lawrence @MichaelAvenatti Buzzard face Lennzy Graham is a legend n his own mind. Word on the Hill is that he feels he's made enough money as a Senator, so he doesn't mind being sent home. Trumps promised him a Judgeship anyway. " I hope he brushes up on the law."

@DrChrisMetzler I think a mistake. The Senate should do its job. This is not a criminal trial. It looks like a setup. They will not even release the name of the Atty. They are stacking the deck.

@Rosemarie4311 @wmbienes @TheBeatWithAri @RealCandaceO @MichaelEDyson She was stating mis-truths. The Democratic Party before Pres. London B. Johnson sign the Civil Rights Act, it was the racist party. The 99.9% of the racist DixieCrats switched to Republican. Pres. Johnson knew it would happened &amp; said it prior to signing the law circa 1965.
