Their union told the Management they are forty drivers short. Train drivers can‚Äôt be held to blame because those who are being paid hundreds of thousands each year can‚Äôt manage.
@KateTraveller @bjstevenage @7NewsSydney @RTBUnion You‚Äôve only started? Ok. Good for you.  Thugs? Good for you. Genuinely, I hope you were inconvenienced today. That‚Äôs what your Liberal Party demigods have delivered for you.

@KateTraveller @bjstevenage @7NewsSydney @RTBUnion Wow. Sounds like you believe all the shit you hear. Short staffed of short staffed. They were 40 short before the timetable changes. I‚Äôm selling magic beans if you‚Äôre interested.

@KateTraveller @7NewsSydney @RTBUnion That fixes nothing. The issue was lack of planning. Trains have had to be brought of mothballs to keep this service running.

@iammarkcarnegie No doubt people do. The Macarena was also a dance craze for five minutes and then stopped. Plenty of Aussies danced the Macarena too. Sydney Ferries has a rich cultural history. Stupid names last for 30 years. And they didn‚Äôt name that ship Boaty McBoatFace in the end.
I‚Äôll say it. An absolute joke and an insult.
