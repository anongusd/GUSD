@jordanalipscomb I also fear that people will see Pres Pence (gulp!) as a return to rationality and will support him. I fear what he might be able to accomplish.
@jordanalipscomb I dearly hope you are right, but I fear that Pence really wants to be president and has just been biding his time.
NO! Pence is smarter and calmer than Trump (okay, who isn't?), but look what he did in Indiana. He would push his crazy evangelical ideas and have a better chance of getting them passed.
@EdKrassen I love two women who were happily pregnant and their fetuses died after the 20-week margin. They would have had to carry their dead children for weeks without the option of what is considered late-term abortion., 	This is cruel and benefits no one.

A woman I love was pregnant with a much-wanted baby who died in utero at 5 months. She had what counted as a late-term abortion, even though her baby was dead.
