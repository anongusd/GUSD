Immigrants' children had higher educational achievement, better salaries and, as a result, paid more in taxes than other native-born Americans. Read: https://t.co/kPvXRXjCw6 and https://t.co/o3VJgzruEb
Americans and prior immigrants who did not finish high school had lower wages because of competition for jobs. Immigrants also paid less in taxes. BUT
MINI Thread On the president's remark on Hispanics and African Americans: A National Academy of Sciences report found that immigration overall had a positive impact on economic growth in the United States. 		But the effect was uneven.
In his speech, Trump did not mention Jakeline, 7, or Felipe, 8, two Guatemalan children who died in Border Patrol custody last month -- or even that it happened. https://t.co/Ayzc2N1ju8
Some people agree that people are "gaming the system." (see below) But there is a process in place to handle asylum cases. People on both sides of the issue propose making that system work faster and better. https://t.co/q5rUA96Gy4
Some immigrants have committed crimes and many can be deported for that. 		This has been Trump's narrative and campaign promise.		But now the majority coming across the border are families. Two children -- aged 8 and 7 -- died crossing last month.
Most immigrants crossing the border (and the vast majority in the US) are not criminals, by Trump's own estimations.. Here's one recent report that examined border crossings and criminals in depth: https://t.co/2qePQ73JGK
Trump admin has demanded $5.7 billion for the wall -- which will NOT seal off the southern border. 		It wouldn't be over.		Now also seems like a good time to mention that the GAO has asked the government to develop metrics to see if walls contribute to border security.
POTUS just said they've requested more immigration judges, which people on both sides of the immigration debate have said is a good idea. Some Dems were just saying that yesterday in Alamogordo NM.
POTUS just said illegal immigration is uncontrolled. That is sometimes true.		But the majority NOW are family members who are surrendering to border agents. They are then booked &amp; fingerprinted. Many are put on electronic monitoring devices. Watch https://t.co/H8BpgnfxOT

Bottom line: We're never going to truly know how this works out. You'll have anecdotes and statistics. 		But unlike REAL courts and REAL police, these arrest and court records aren't public. There's no way to verify the full impact independently. thanks.
When you're running for your life, you run. Many migrants do not know the difference btw a "port of entry" and the border. When we were on the border recently, we met migrants who crossed illegally *near* a port of entry. https://t.co/c7ebAggVBI
Some claims are not valid, and all claims have soared in recent years. In many cases, migrants don't show up for court*. Read this explainer by @nickmiroff https://t.co/0WoSwk07JY		*Sometimes they are given wrong court dates or none at all. This is also a government problem.
Trump's new policies could jail migrants for long periods &amp; prevent them from staying permanently.		So, even if you are legitimately running for your life across a border, you won't get the protection the US normally offers.
THREAD		Here's what this is about: Tijuana is in the 9th Circuit court of appeals, which is more progressive &amp; has upheld protections for immigrants. Texas is closer, but in the more conservative 5th Circuit. 		Look for a lawsuit soon, like the travel ban. https://t.co/jLIuLtoI2n

Finally, is ICE pressuring parents to self-deport? Lawyers feared that, but had no evidence yesterday at PI. But immigrants have said for years that agents pressure them to leave. There's little public oversight because immigration arrests and court records are secret.
DHS language Saturday night saying Port Isabel would become a reunification and removal center is extremely vague. @crimmigration Seasoned lawyers,  who know the facility doesn't hold kids, couldn't be sure what would happen. Kids are in cages in other areas. Hard to predict.
