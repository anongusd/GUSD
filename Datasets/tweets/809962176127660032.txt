weighing 210 Lbs. Tonight does not make me feel so tough an obstacle in my life now.  Exercise and outdoor walking will be helpful and my activity online and using my Laptop computer will be writing and illustrating mostly sketching and drawing on paper.  Maybe they will sell?
my usefulness for working and helping but not becoming a tradesman on my own jobs was a cruel way to waste my early job experiences.  I am age 59 now, and my weight is about 210 Lbs. now.  235 Lbs. was the uppermost that my weight was.  On August 1, 2011, my weight was 198 Lbs.
In January of 1978 .. my oldest brother had hired me as a labourer just helping in general work.  I was not driving a vehicle but my availabilities allowed my brother to bring me to stay with him overnight.  My work was good, but my thoughts and my dreams were pulling me beyond /
competitive highschool races.  I thought the running could get my weight adjusted to perhaps 15 Lbs. lower or even 25 Lbs. lower by the graduating year.  I graduated with Ontario Secondary School Graduation Diploma (Grade 12) in June 1977.  I was failing miserably after that.
I had wanted to be a champion skuller on the highschool rowing team.  I went to apply when I was in 10th grade.  My weight was 145 Lbs.  so I was 10 Lbs. over the 135 Lbs. Top Weight Limit.  I decided my time would be put to excellent use by running in Long-distance.. see more
I did sing in the school mixed choir as a BASS since my voice was deep and I did learn to sing a number of contemporary songs and with the Choir I was competing to win many times in adjudicated competitions against choirs from schools across the Province of Ontario, in cities.
To Be Happy you need to have something like a yearround hobby or sport or perhaps training to run marathon running races.  When in my teenage years attending highschool in September 1973 until June 1977, see more

RT please?  @kanyewest my love of smartphones has nothing for me now.  My landline phone does well enough.  Many Cellphone Carriers rake the big monthly charges.  My laptop and my desk phone serve my needs.  Cable TV was discontinued too.  Life is Grand. https://t.co/BICbuRfdKK

Without Nikola Tesla our world would be governed as a global regime under NAZI GERMANY -- You Know This Is A Truth not because Hitler was best, but because The Science and War Technology they were creating was far advanced
Tesla was so much beyond a promoter of Physical Science and Technology Development.  Albert Einstein was a Theoretical Physicist.  The Experimenter Nikola Tesla did much greater than the others.
