The House just passed HR 1112, closing the Charleston Loophole. It is humbling to be a part of a Congress that, after over two decades, finally passed two major pieces of legislation (#HR8, #HR1112) to strengthen background checks that can lead to the reduction of gun violence.
Today, I will vote for #HR1112 to close the Charleston loophole. This bill will allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.

That is why we cannot prolong this shut down and we must open up the government immediately, get paychecks in people‚Äôs pockets, get over our party politics, and get serious about comprehensive immigration reform.
Any discussion about border security must be coupled with immigration reform that takes into account the option for our Dreamers, farmworkers, and recipients of TPS to earn their citizenship. However, such serious discussions take time, especially if done in a bipartisan manner
I strongly believe in bolstering the security on our borders, not with solutions from the 4th century, but with technology and infrastructure from the 21st century.
This week, Congress will vote on and pass legislation that will reopen Treasury and IRS, USDA, EPA and DOI.
Last week, Congress passed two bills to reopen government services, ensure workers get the paychecks they have earned, and restore certainty to the lives of the American people.  The bills also included provisions to provide back pay to federal employees.
Despite the President proudly prolonging the partial government shut down, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to reopen our government.
The ripple effect from this shut down will be felt far and beyond the people who rely on the federal government for employment and benefits, but also will be felt by every day Americans as some basic government services are stopped.
Nearly 800,000 federal workers, including 39,000 in California, have been furloughed and may soon not get paychecks.  Money for food stamps and federal housing may soon dry up.
.@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs decision to single handedly shut down a significant part of our government in order to fulfill a campaign promise by building an expensive and ineffective wall at our southern border is irresponsible, unprincipled, and is actually hurting Americans.
Tonight, President Donald Trump again made it clear how proud he is to put his petulance and politics over legitimate policy and the lives of the American people.

It is imperative that the President stop threatening the stability and prosperity of our country over an ill-conceived campaign promise and that Congress come together to responsibly identify a long-term budget solution to fund our government.
Despite the President's rejection of those proposals and his call for this shutdown, Democrats will continue to work with Republicans to come to an agreement to reopen our government.
Decisively, Congressional Democrats offered multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which included funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, not an ineffective and expensive wall.
Disappointingly, the federal government has partially shut down as of this morning.  Disturbingly, President Donald Trump called for this shutdown more than 25 times and now has gotten what he wanted.
Complete withdrawal from Syria. Major drawdown in Afghanistan. Is Korea next? President Trump, what is the strategy? Conducting national security policy without consultation, agreement, buy in, or intent is a danger and damaging to our values.

The health of our ocean is inherently tied to the culture &amp; economic health of the central coast of CA.I introduced the #NationalOceanPolicyAct to restore federal policies to promote ocean conservation, respond to climate change &amp; ocean acidification, &amp; advance marine stewardship
This action prioritized short-term economic gains over long-term strategic policies focused on the ecological health &amp; sustainability of our oceans &amp; Great Lakes. The Administration has also proposed a significant expansion in offshore oil drilling, including off the coast of CA.

Proposed changes will impact 23,000 active duty military households across the country enrolled in #SNAP. Our military families already sacrifice so much for our country. We should be reducing barriers to assistance for them, not making it more difficult to put food on the table.

The Administration‚Äôs announcement to end the critical #TPS designation for El Salvador will upend the lives of over 200k residents and their families who have lived in and contributed to our nation for years. Congress should pass the American Promise Act. https://t.co/7oD6LidG0o
@POTUS .@realDonaldTrump, tomorrow is the deadline to extend #TPS for 200k Salvadorans. They own businesses &amp; homes and pay taxes. W/o them, US would lose billions from GDP, Social Sec &amp; Medicare, and employers would pay millions in turnover costs. We are all relying on you to #SaveTPS
Tomorrow is the deadline for the Trump Administration to renew #TPS for the nearly 200k Salvadorans legally living and working in the United States, including 50k in CA. I held a press conference and roundtable on Friday to urge the @POTUS to #SaveTPS.  https://t.co/XQrixSbHSe

@HASCDemocrats President Trump‚Äôs discriminatory #transgender guidance happens to fall on the anniversary of Pres.Truman‚Äôs EO to desegregate our military.
@HASCDemocrats I urge the President to reverse his guidance, and to respect and support those who protect our country regardless of their gender identity.
As member of @HASCDemocrats and as a veteran, I value every American who is willing and able to join the U.S. military.
Last year, DOD implemented a policy to allow transgender troops to serve openly in the military. Today‚Äôs guidance is a huge step back.
Those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country should not face discrimination from anyone, let alone their Commander in Chief.
The President‚Äôs tweet attacking transgender service members is shameful and prejudiced.

This week, it was confirmed that the Senate's health care bill isn't just "mean," it can't even be passed by the Majority Party.

@sethmoulton Congratulations! Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness!
Congress must work together to make our health care system more accessible and affordable for all Americans.
This bill aims to cut taxes for the wealthiest by cutting programs that provide health care to poor and elderly Americans.
(6) Planned Parenthood would face a Medicaid funding freeze for a year.
(5) The individual mandate would be eliminated with no replacement to incentivize healthy people to get insurance.
(4) Insurers would be allowed to charge older Americans premiums that are up to five times higher than their younger counterparts.
(3) Cost-saving subsidies would be eliminated, making it harder for families to pay for coverage.
(2) Medicaid funding would dramatically decrease and its scope of eligibility would narrow.
The Senate majority's health care bill would: (1) Take health care away from millions of Americans by killing the expansion of Medicaid.
I know that the ACA is not perfect, but the Senate health care bill is cruel and unacceptable. My full statement: https://t.co/716Rg6Du7v

The new amendment for the AHCA does not address the loophole that strips tax credits from up to 7 million veterans. This is unacceptable.
