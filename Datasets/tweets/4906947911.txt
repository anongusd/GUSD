@MeetThePress @kasie Other wise known as democracy. In a democracy where people are loaded with stone and dumped out at sea and if they float to surface they’re innocent, YAY! Chalk one for our New Democrats/Marxian/Socialism government, bravissimo!!!! What say you?
@JillayneMC @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Here in lies The Marxian/Socialism strangle hold on The People, as long as the Democrats push this ridiculous belief. Democrats will continue to enslave The People with this brainwashing with the Help of The Chinese government who now control our school system, what say you?
@JillayneMC @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows That all Americans are all in favor of the rape of USC, I highly doubt it. When you all control the News you can tell us pigs fly, and who’s gonna refute it when your guns will be pointed at The People, when our right to arms is taken away and we better like it, what say you?
@JillayneMC @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows First thing y’all need to do is open a copy of USC, stroll down to Art IV, Sec IV, “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of government,” notice no guarantee of Democratic government. What say you?
@RealSaavedra Until Congress brings ethics charges against disorderly Representatives, these types of hate crimes will continue, what say you?
@thehill This is a narrative that all whom were aware of, are helping to continue this hoax at The People’s expense. Mean while back at Ranch, the silent coup goes straight on, No? Then how come Republicans present before daily news with a gag in mouth and manacled, while rape of USC?
@dbongino Yeah so what, but what are Republicans doing about it, instead of stepping up and actually doing something about. That’s how Republican government works. Stop whimpering and start speaking up and be heard! What say you?
@senatemajldr And what exactly are the Republicans going to do about. All I hear is this whimpering, and crocodile tears, and waiting to collect your pay checks every two weeks while The People being force fed a daily dose of democracy, that which is in contempt of USC, what say you?

@Lawrence There are no such things as Democrats or Republicans, just Representatives or Senators who will vote yea or nay. All this is, is showboating. These people elected to act in our stead, is to do the people’s business, not celebrity’s or royalty we are to pay to subjugate US for fun
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA And on Senate check by President
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA The checks on government. Legislature, Senate check on President. President checks on legislature, by way of the negative, the greatest power of head of state, power to prevent law, not the power to create law. Irrespective of powers granted to Pres by Congress, SCOTUS nulls Law.
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA You just answered my question. Changing United States Constitution requires Fed, States and We The People be on board for any Amendment Art V. Actually it’s the President who prevents unconstitutional Law. SCOTUS, is after the fact, which will rule yea or nay on constitution WSY?
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA During the ratification talks on USC, the use of descriptive word democracy was looked upon with contempt. USC We The People, Art IV, Sec IV, Republican government guarantees. Democracy’s are subjugating, of its people. What say you?
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA Lastly ye, whom thy be, have not made a plausible argument that shows that government has an indelible right to Amend USC, without Amending IAW USC, Art V. Nor has anyone shown the people by evidence that Amendment II, needs amending, what say you?
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA Jus so you know, we are not a democracy, we’re Republican form of government. I acknowledge that this is the narrative fed daily to We The People. In a democracy the government can be Marxian/Socialism, Fascism, any other tyrannical government without the people’s consent, WSY?
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA ...barriers at public courts, public buildings that are placed to protect the public servants from the people and public servants private property. This rush to dismantle Amendment II, is Socialism way of bringing back The Monarchy, this is a separate clause, referenced twice USC
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano @NRA The Russians want to protect our Amendment II, Rights, my wife just called for an ambulance, I’m syncopated. While we’re at it, IAW Amendment XIV, all these perquisites that some how permeates our legal system that creates, taxation for public servants to protect public servants
@jackshafer Is this like when your mother gives you that look, don’t do something wrong, and you do it anyway.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump 🤣🤣🤣🤣 hilarious and would make this theft of heroism, brought before the world
@ananavarro Finally, sense, what say you?
@DHThinkTank @ABCPolitics Here here!
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano That’s right! We do agree, the militia is “We The People,” Amendment II, our responsibly is to maintain a “free State,” we who empower government to act in our stead, not government that is empowered to subjugate The People, by way of “wag of the foot”, what say you?
@Lawrence Lawrence, that’s right. Politicians bashing our Constitution, by Representatives USC knowledge deficiency syndrome, quals for any Rep, Sen, President brevis, prevents extortion, what say you?
@ABCPolitics Good cop, bad scenario, what say you?
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano That’s right! Isn’t your question an assumption. And specifically Amendment IV, “the right of the people to be secure in their own person,” Mandates government to protect our privacy. Under Amendment XIII, subjugation for crimes, Amendment XIV, only can take away voting, not arms
Supreme Court to decide fate of 'Peace Cross' memorial in Maryland - TheBlaze... then every medal cross of valor must also be invalidated. No mention of any god or reference to god of any religious belief. Constitutional, what say you? https://t.co/LH7BxAEezZ
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano And Democrats, Radicals, enemies Foreign and domestic, lastly Marxian/Socialist, acutely know this. Strip citizens of any Republic or Democracy this right of evolution to protect oneself, amounts to government slavery,? What say you!
@pamlovesscuba @RepDean @gracenapolitano Three separate clauses, “being necessary to the security of a free State,” (operative words), “security of a free State,” followed by “right to bear arms,” power delegated to The People, Amendment X, the last line of defense for Freedom! Stripping this right null and voids USC...
@RepDean @gracenapolitano End the murder of babies in or out of womb, what say you?
@RepDean @gracenapolitano Unconstitutional, direct contravention of Amendment II, “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Written in stone, The People’s irrevocable trust, USC. Show where its even implied otherwise, what say you?
@AlanDersh We are at that terrible juncture. It is the new normal. Speaker Of House Nancy Pelosi held up a copy of USC beseeching Members to abide by their oath to USC. Now we’re told that only illegal immigrants may invoke rights under Amendment II, what say you? @FoxNews @nytimes @thehill
@DiamondandSilk Just because the Marxian/Socialist murder babies, doesn’t mean Americans have fall into slavery by government, what say you?
@DiamondandSilk Here here!
@radicalalert @AOC Not the boss of me. There is this clause Art I, No Titles of Nobility: definitive. Next thing after you write bills to confiscate our property, Tax slavery, and to prostrate before thy Nobles, what say you?

@cvpayne Yet problem not to sentence the people into prison slavery for a term of years. Man kills baby in womb, murder, MD, and mother murder baby, choice! And still it’s delivered as a right. Eventually the light of the heavens will come, what say you?
This amounts to overthrow of National Government. Democrats can’t get enough of circumventing USC, stoooop!! What say you?
16 States Sue to Stop Trump’s Use of Emergency Powers to Build Border Wall https://t.co/BAjRqQsZzh this is a compact IAW USC Art I, Sec X, para III, forbidden, requires prior consent from Congress, will be thrown out, unconstitutional, what say you?
@freddoso @dcexaminer Yeah, right? Freedom of the press, does not exonerate journalists as surely as Politicians are not immune from libelous speeches outside of Congress. What say you?
@CNNPolitics I have an idea @SenSanders show us how legislative misappropriation of The People’s worth is justified, by Congress. Just because you create a Bill that makes it okay to keep people under tax slavery irrespective of our irrevocable trust, USC, what say you?
@SpeakerPelosi Okay? What about the human trafficking IAW 18 USC. So what you’re saying is in-spite of child sexual slavery, human slavery, labor slavery coming over southern border is okay for Democrats. And nothing to worry about, I’m having trouble feeling good of what you say, what say you?
@dcexaminer Maybe this should be directed at McCabe, what say you?
@CNN IAW 18 USC adults who bring children whom are not their children over the border are humam trafficking, what say you?
@FoxNews @nytimes @marklevinshow @NBCNews @washingtonpost @CBSNews @ABC @nytimes https://t.co/Mih16ejxL3
@CNN Does it say or mean, when Democrats push for open boarders they really mean they are for human trafficking as defined 18 USC. Or maybe Democrats are not aware of these statuses, which is also shameful, what say you? https://t.co/Ih8hSckRT2

@dbongino Sanders talking about ending college tuition problem by giving college free tuition. How does this call for free tuition affect the 1.5 trillion dollars still to be paid. What kind of effect will this pardon of student loans plunge our economy in global depression, what say you?

@MagtathMaggie Thank you, it is when We the few amongst many are able to have discourse can we eventually unseat any and all public servants incompetent in fulfilling their constitutional duty to serve US, what say you?

@MagtathMaggie This logic is exactly 180 degrees from your first tweet. These shenanigans about, not my President, only Congress runs things or everyone should be sentenced to death and hung till dead on allegations is Marxian Socialism ideology, are you this, is that the question what say you?
@MagtathMaggie That’s right, in a democracy, that’s why America is a Republican form of government, what say you?

@Pontifex WADR your eminence. I’ve heard it be told. Debridement, is an excellent way to cleanse all infectious wounds. As silent as the night, in slumbers peace disturbs bambino’s nun,

@JonathanTurley According to your analysis. It would mean, States income taxes unconstitutional, agreed. Its that clause about uniformity, the monkey wrench. If the cap on income was raised to a reasonable amount, would resurrect MC, uniformity would be fair and balanced, what say you?

@RyanAFournier Another bag of nuts looking for publicity, what say you?

@IngrahamAngle this dynamic duo from Chicago, makes me wonder. Perfect timing for pushback on McCabe’s revelations. Sounds extremely suspect. What are the odds, he gets a hand smack, and a lucrative Hollywood deal. Investigative journalism is bye bye, what say you?

@GMA Reprehensible, and travesty of resources of justice. Now we are bombarded with smoke as government continues to rape USC on every level, as every news/media is used to maintain The People under Marxian/Socialism Stockholm Syndrome Psychosis, what say you?
@VanityFair Another publication jumping into the CoolAid, without knowing the flavor, and second guessing The President from an arm chair, what say you?
@BFT_Podcast @chuckwoolery Exactly how they have undermined Amendment IV. They are by hook or by crook forcing this Marxian/Socialism ideology down our throats. This way they can elevate, install any Martinet/Petty Tyrant to crush our Republic, what say you?

@jsolomonReports @SaraCarterDC Your news reporting is unequivocally exceptional. I thank you for getting to what matters, and making a difference!
@CNN @BernieSanders @wolfblitzer My question, how come crickets when @HillaryClinton pull the rug right under Sanders for President. Will The People vote for a former candidate who was unwilling to fight for this chicanery, what say you?
@thehill Doesn’t matter what color you paint a socialist they’re still a socialist, what say you?
@BreitbartNews Another Former President trying to become King,  by getting the wife elected. And when USC is amended, He or She may take the oath, what say you?
@CuomoPrimeTime The President questioned McCabe’s motives, and as he said  in 60 minutes interview and when he saw Candidate Trump was blame shaming McCabe’s wife he lost it,  “I was under stress,” McCabe kept saying, what say you?
@thehill Love that 1987 snippet by Sanders how Medicaid for all would bankrupt America. Another Socialism Despot trying to takeover and destroy our Constitutional Republic, what say you?
@usatodayDC This is chicanery and totally without merit. Only Congress may change the laws that The President faithfully executes. No court may interfere with The Office of The President. SCOTUS may uphold or strike down a law, and that is all, what say you?
@thehill When they get Congress, the States, and The People, to agree in accordance with Art V, USC, what say you?

@jimsciutto Petty Tyrant installed by sedition. You really should read The Federalists Papers, it’s a yawner for some. Pure enlightenment for me. Everything in its place. And most egregious, keeping all this quiet and secret from the President, and who is involved is the most telling, WSY?
@jimsciutto IAW USC, and is a fully transparent action. To investigate the President, is not mandated to FBI, CIA, NSA, DOJ unless it can be shown by evidence. Not investigations in search of crimes because the President questions your motives. Duly elected President, not a martinet and....
@jimsciutto See, that’s a really great question. Don’t know their thinking. Do know that no action is very telling. IAW Amendment VI, all accused to be presented with evidence, etc, doesn’t say with exception of President. And to investigate Presidency, must originate in the Hse of Rep....
@jowr_what @MZHemingway That’s right, it requires everyone in Amendment XXV, to come to open agreement and The People, to be on board. Not investigations looking for crimes, bc you hate him. That Congress knew and failed to tell the People of this, is direct rape of Amendment X, what say you?
@jowr_what @MZHemingway Amendment XXV, has a specific purpose. It has to do with disability of The President to do His job. Not a way to nullify a duly elected President. All it does is give clarity to Art II Sec I para 5. It is not to circumvent USC and it’s mandates, or to push sedition, what say you? https://t.co/00SetCuYP7

Most respectfully Mr President @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I would ask the powers of The President be invoked, the power to quell insurrection by Congress and lower departments of government and call upon DOJ to launch forthwith investigations of Usurpation “the powers not delegated”

@seanhannity Scary! And to top it off it was and still kept under wraps by Mueller who has the notes from MaCabe, and we have yet to hear or know that DAG and McCabe were interviewed about all things Russia, what say you?
@JudicialWatch Even though a sitting member may read out loud things that are secret during session, immunity is SOP, IAW USC, Art I, Sec VI, para I, what say you?
@60Minutes As I finish watching McCabe interview: 2 things. How come McCabe and Rosenstein did not take concerns to Congress. And how come SC Mueller did not apprise Congress of McCabe’s notes of this explosive news: Usurpation! Sirs/Madams, what say you?
@60Minutes If Mueller SC mandates to look at all things Russia. How come these individuals in DOJ/FBI were not questioned about their roles. Isn’t this the very meaning of justice for some and no justice for others. ACCOUNTABILITY Sirs/Madams, what say you?
It is unconstitutional to require President or Presidential candidates to bring forth tax filings, or that oversight grants Congress to construpate USC, as “Resist,” movement or create investigations looking for which is actually Usurpation without Amendment to USC, what say you?
@RealSaavedra The Berlin Wall was to keep people in, not out, what say you?
@dcexaminer With what a resolution. Is not legally binding on anyone. FYI, resolutions are unconstitutional! No mention of it in USC. This fake Thing was first used, ironically, to fight The war with Mexico 1846. It is no more a law, as saying a rule is a law. Only a Bill is! @USHouseofReps

@fujymo @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama The corrupt tiger, The Swamp. As you know that the greatest fear in the moulding of USC was intrigue and cabal which is pretty evident in our political system. The fear that a self proclaimed ruling class would take over, what say you?

@guardian Tired of blame shame,
@dcexaminer Congress creates law that empowers President to act under emergency. Now they have to investigate why He is using this power. So shouldn’t they have an emergency session to fix it if they truly believe that they erred in creation of the law to begin with, @USHouseofReps WSY?
@JudicialWatch Even though we now know a Administrative Junta did occur, no one has yet to come forward at the Congressional level and put a hold on Mueller probe until this is sorted out. Now that we know the investigation in search of crime is suspect, what say you?
@thehill Our children and loved ones who die everyday from heroine/opioids is like a 10year crying for an ice cream on a scorching 🥵 day is not a crisis. Killing breathing, feeling, thinking babies is a choice, but ripping our rights to install Marxian/Socialism government is, WSY?
@CNNTonight @CNN @ericswalwell Does implying The President committed a treasonous Act with aid of His press secretary by a sitting member of Congress libelous and not in the scope of, Art I, Sec VI, para I, Gravel v. United States, Hutchinson v. Proxmire (1979)? @USHouseofReps what say you?

@BumpItMcCarthy @tedlieu @VP @AlanDersh A boatload of Cabinet Members and 2/3rds Congress required to invoke Amendment XXV! No One in this Republic May Act in secret, and to do so requires accountability, what say you?
@BumpItMcCarthy That’s exactly right,
@chrislhayes when each and every nation gets on board. Unless we are prepared to build a dome. FYI, all planets swing by Sun 🌞 very closely every 200K years. Called Nature renewing itself, what say you?
Signing a Bill dedicated to tax payer subjugation, and then declaring a National Emergency is an oxymoron, and pointless! Bill is unconstitutional, and my next election vote will go to a Constitutionalist, @POTUS  WADR
@tedlieu @VP @AlanDersh I would side with Alan Dershowitz on this one. What I read in your tweet is Democrat rationalization. Tells me that there’s a boatload of coconspirators, involved in Administrative Junta, still to come before the Well, what say you?
@POTUS WADR Mr President, this new appropriations Bill is unconstitutional IAW USC, Congress cannot delegate it’s power to municipality as surely as it cannot delegate it’s power to lower Departments of Government. Amendment X, requires it, the powers not delegated, what say you?
@latimes Chalk one up for USC, what say you?

@thehill Who cares what bag of nuts say evermore, lastly, no one, what say you?
@POTUS WADR if the Bill for proposed border security has language that selectively excludes some States from it’s mandates. is unconstitutional. Every Bill for any appropriation must be for all or none. If you note concerns, as USC guides you, Democrats will come around,
@RepMattGaetz This was a well laid plan by many. Administrative Junta’s require a boat load of coconspirators, what say you?
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson The biggest clue that this was taking effect was when the three stooges arrived at Trump Tower to brief President Elect Trump, Moe and Curley convince Larry to Spill the beans, Jan, 2017, Administrative Junta did occur,
@Steffi_Cole I really enjoyed Human Action,
@VDHanson I define your concern for what has manacled an entire population, Stockholm Syndrome Psychosis, what say you?
@POTUS Sir, with deepest respect, the problem with US Immigration is the laws themselves. Putting a bandaid on a severed limb won’t help it heal. Congress must address this issue IAW USC. Whom does it serve to make law that removes the bandaid from the severed limb, what say you?
@KimStrassel By the way where is Representative Adam Schiff. Waiting to hear how Mueller needs to look into his investigations of Russia, what say you?

@NRO @charlescwcooke This is another Democrat/Marxian/Socialism tactic in order to maintain We The People under Tax Slavery, look at the promise of California high speed rail (too expensive). Doesn’t it mean The People will get more poor and whom will get richer this time with this hoax, WSY?
@ABCPolitics @rickklein @maryaliceparks Over blown, I understand that diversity hounds forget and fail to inform not only yourselves but others, O’Rorke, had to speak Spanish which brought a response from a big portion of audience. It is implied USC, English is our common language, what say you?
@brithume For example, say for instance, if Congress appropriated $500,000,000.00, say to Planned Parenthood and Planned Parenthood in turn spent $30,000,000.00 on midterm election 2018, would you consider this free speech or suspect, since USC mandates Congress regulate bus, what say you?
@brithume That’s right Brit, except that lobbyists no problem, as long as our Politicians do not benefit, not me, it’s a USC mandate, what say you?
@ABCPolitics @rickklein @maryaliceparks Totally overblown Fake News. When y’all finally wake up from The Stockholm Syndrome Psychosis spell, pretty sure your tweets will gain a little more impressions other than mine, what say you?
@RubinReport @Cernovich That’s right, abortion, unwanted rape, under age etc, then late term now, full term and breathing.

@JudicialWatch How does this work, really. A great travesty of justice, since in essence, Congress is in contempt of USC, when it has turned it’s back on the new Tax subjugated People. Corporate welfare, this is Tax slavery. Isn’t this the reason we must prostrate before Patriot Act, what say U
@WesLeyDoutCold @larryelder Don’t misundertake me, just a matter of semantics. The real issue.

@JackPosobiec Actually a Democrat/Socialism President Was in charge, what say you?

@JackPosobiec When every single American have a mind put to their will as One as we are of the Collective Will, there is nothing that prevents The People from changing our future into ultimate greatness, what say you?
@JackPosobiec Free speech is not usurpation. Democrats fail to distinguish when one of their party calls for unconstitutional behavior. Though hate speech is childish and unprofessional, unproductive, and benefits no one, certainly not illegal. Representatives should be above reproach, WSY?

@usatodayDC Great aerial pic’s, doesn’t address reasons against. It’s simple, a border like a ship on water, when you get a leak you patch it up, and during a storm you batten down the hatches, what say you?
@CNNPolitics This power granted under USC, what say you?
@trish_regan @KatTimpf Tell us more
@hardball @DonnaFEdwards I’m a little suspect of your analysis, I heard, not just wall as the basis, but also an eclectic approach. What say you?
@hardball @HardballChris Chris, Chris, two years have gone by and you spout beautiful words, and that itch in the back of your brain knowing that The President will come out smelling like roses and the chokers like skunk, what say you?
@ABCPolitics What the Presidential election of 2016 has surprisingly taught us, news has become truly evanescence, and with the help of mind bending social media,  what people will remember Schumer and Pelosi faces saying NO! What say you?
@bgamall @JonathanTurley @SenateFloor @USHouseofReps You’re absolutely correct, we’re being pushed into subjugation by inadequate immigration laws, that exonerate invaders and taxes it’s citizens into poverty, what say you?
@hughhewitt US Asylum Law grants anyone here illegally, when caught to invoke asylum. The Blackhole of Immigration, loopholed in Asylum Law, first paragraph, what say you?
@maria_risener @FrankPallone @HouseDemocrats Unions are a necessary component of labor. When the country had an abundance of unions the country prospered, as long as they don’t become Marxian/Socialism pockets of power, and are fair and balanced, what say you?
@SeanDol31765254 @RepAlGreen Asylum Law allows migrants to by pass this option. Law allows migrants to jump the line, all they have to do is cross our border and get caught, then released, and maybe they’ll show up to court. It’s loophole in Asylum Law, actually first paragraph, what say you?
@cknu22 @DorisMatsui Two guys who stopped at Home Depot, the ones strategically placed on the borders. Now picture this, thousands upon thousands of people just running through open borders, just like migrants crashed Europe, who’s going to stop them, with ray guns and cameras, what say you?
@ABC My question, how does your news coverage help Americans. As government forces The People into destitute and crime, and now the proposals for total enslavement by Socialism, nay nay thou say then how come y’all push subjugation ideologies, please explain your coverage, what say u?
@bennyjohnson Extraordinarily sad
@cultofbednar @SpeakerPelosi @RepYvetteClarke @SenSchumer My sentences are spot on, spinning and insults the tools of the unenlightened, what say you?
@cultofbednar @SpeakerPelosi @RepYvetteClarke @SenSchumer ??
@DorisMatsui Can you show us how exactly a wall doesn’t work, like with pictures, what say you?
@SpeakerPelosi @RepYvetteClarke @SenSchumer Can you show us the facts, The President is wrong and you are right. Show us what you say, and how does the border security Dems are proposing actually work, is it drones with ray guns, and loud speakers that say Alto, no pase, stuff like that, what say you?
@FrankPallone @HouseDemocrats I come to believe this recalcitrant refusal to protect Americans is not political. It’s an addiction to slave wages, eventually who will pay for freebies, until free loaders are unable to pay, bye bye rich, why else advocate abolition of Electoral College, what say you?
Kudos to you @IngrahamAngle it was great fun especially when you gave the elites a taste of their own medicine, we were rolling 🤣🤣🤣🤣 thanks,
@nytimes This Mind Control with manipulative wand of spinning a story, didn’t work for Chicken Little certainly not working for what used to  be All The News That’s Fit to Print,” and rebuttals by the two Cheerleaders at the morgue, if crisis fake indeed, show me don’t tell, what say you?
@seanhannity @GeraldoRivera Geraldo, we have Americans killing Americans, and how is it okay for foreigners invading our country and now killing us, what say you?
@dbongino This a red flag 🚩 on so many levels, what say you?
@thehill Any all Special Counsel, act at the pleasure of The President, why is this so, there is no or has there been a bill that mandates the investigation of duly elected President, prior to Office and upon taking Oath of Presidency, isn’t this the meaning of Administrative Junta, WSY?
@JonathanTurley When our country is faced with law that condones invasion by immigration, and state of denial, y’all might think that @SenateFloor @USHouseofReps would fix this egregious assault, to stop slavery, drug addiction and draining of our pockets for persons not ENTITLED, what say you?
@JaySekulow The Senate effectively nullifies a Bill by this unconstitutional Cloture rule. Every thing that is sent to Senate must be voted on. USC is adamant about Senate voting, “if they be equally divided,” don’t see unless cloture may deny, what say you?
@JaySekulow The Vice President, is The President of the Senate, who is required by USC mandate, to sit at Senate in session, he is their to table disorderly conduct by Senators, and tie breaker. There is no such Thing as Cloture, what say you?
@RyanAFournier Love this plan, except it should be two terms, 4 years total for Representative and one term, 6 years total for Senator. Lastly, before entering into office be competent in USC knowledge, what say you?
@TexasMexicoLaw Constitutional Counsel at Law, WADR love your banter and on spot understanding of USC, I like it!
@AC360 @RepStephenLynch Okay, let’s finally clear up, 2016 election for President. Sometimes popular vote elects President, sometimes the Small States elects The President, that’s how Electoral College works, “fair and balanced,” what say you?
@AC360 @RepStephenLynch Anderson, think about it, 12 billion more from our tax money from your pocket, to maintain failed policies, while sacrificing our house in the middle of your street, what say you?
@AC360 @CortesSteve @TheRickWilson The People get @CNN is absolutely spot on, it is more important to and un-American to deny Foreign population tax payer funds from American sweat money from the shirts 👚 off hour backs, all who protest @CNBC dictum must be eliminated, what say you?
Under Art II, USC @POTUS can and should convene both Houses, so members may account for these egregious tantrums, to explain to The People, that Speakership is the new Presidency, what say you? https://t.co/V40Z2kbrQN
@hardball The axiom “rich get richer and the poor condemned to impecuniosity,” what say you?
@hardball WADR the problems of today were created through the years from 1960’s till today. Not a single party issue. Illegals do depress wages, let’s be real, two show up to work, can’t speak English $1.00/hr, English speak 10.00/hr, who gets hired, what say you?
@JonathanTurley @SenateFloor  @USHouseofReps "I'm equal to the president,'@nytimes ' searching for crimes,' 'got insurance policy,' 'he lied to the @washingtonpost ,' 'we're going to impeach the motherfer,' 'extreme USC deficiency knowledge," the perfect prescription for CIVIL WAR! what say you?
@SenateFloor @USHouseofReps @nytimes @washingtonpost WADR Amendment XXV, unconstitutional, Congress cannot shirk It’s constitutional mandate, USC requires it, Art II, Sec I, para V. And it creates the very cabal and intrigue, Gave US Administrative Junta, 2016 till today, WSY?
@JonathanTurley Also, there is no such THING as speaker of the House of representatives. No mention of it in USC, rules are not Laws. It is a collection of representatives who act in the peoples stead. Nothing more. As you have adroitly pointed out, it is the parts that comprises the whole, WSY?
@thehill This is the what the FFs were totally adamant about, a Republic that paid it’s debt, this is how Representative government works. Representatives that understand that it’s about us, what say you?
@KBAndersen I’m not so sure, Pelosi becomes Speaker, The People want tuna that taste good, not tunas with good taste. Fresh ideas for times that are going to test our metal, and wasn’t it Pelosi, that gave US unconstitutional Affordable Care Act, what say you?
@mcmnadal @NBCNews @TODAYshow The FFs main concern with the Presidency, The Chief Magistrate, He was not a product of enemies foreign and domestic. “Only,” The House of Representatives is comprised with the powers to hold The Executive accountable with 2/3 vote, what say you?
@mcmnadal @NBCNews @TODAYshow Great question, Art. I, Sec. VI, para II, also defines this very question, as to the President it does not prevent Him from enjoying the fruits of his labor Art. II. It’s extra payments US or from the States, FFs were concerned with corruption of members of houses, what say you?
@hardball Senators do not create bills of appropriation, they concur or disagree with a Bill, and if they agree or disagree they send back to house with their changes . Cloture unconstitutional since this makes the Senate, President of US, what say you?
@MSNBC @maddow WADR so lovely when The kettle calls the frying pan black, what say you?
@NBCNews @TODAYshow WADR ask Representative Pelosi, if she understands that Titles of Nobility are strictly forbidden by USC, what say you?
@politico @SenateFloor @HouseFloor WADR the only sure way to get the politicians to go to their perspective wells and conduct the People’s business is to put permanent locks on their pockets, answer, don’t contribute to them. Watch how quick things get done, what say you?
@SenateDems @GOPLeader WADR as I reiterated repeatedly, there are no such thing as party whatsoever, jus yeas or naysayers, USC requires it. Party affiliations are the bane of caustic antics that cannot be presented by baffling us with brilliance, it is contempt of USC when y’all smoke us with mirrors
@hughhewitt @washingtonpost @SenateGOP There was a time when they all showed up to do the people’s business, but since The Senate created unconstitutional Cloture rule, they don’t have to anything, unless you talk to them in elevators, what say you?
@JonathanTurley That’s an oxymoron, Democrat Party has not changed since it’s inception, the flavor is different but they still make separate but equal by calling it diversity, slavery by a different name. Democrats are looking for a new way of packaging the same ideology, what say you?
@hardball @SusanPage Since when did The People give to it’s Representatives and Senators absolute dominion over our Republic, they create a Bill for appropriation of monies drawn from Treasury and bring it to President for yea or nay, not unconstitutional continuing resolutions, what say you?
@AnnCoulter We learned of this when it happened, cept, no one paid attention, the fake news were all to busy keeping their exploding heads glued together, what day you?
@NRO @nicholas_c_p Identity politics is a most effective way to keep the tribes corralled and control. It’s how Madison Ave, sells you anything, it’s how social media has such a grip on the country, what say you?
@JonathanTurley There is a thing in the UCMJ about Officers being in contempt of The President, retirees can be subject to recall, what say you?
@ChuziChips @thehill Fear not John Little, jus cause they make a Law doesn’t make it legal. It is by our will that any law claims dominion over you or me. If we as a people by our sovereign will deem any law usurpation, We The People are empowered to nullify any oppressive law, what say you?
@ChuziChips @thehill I understand your fear. IAW USC, and FF’s, the government derives it power with the blessings of The People. Government has no authority to tell the people how the people may bear arms, it is an ancient right, fortified IAW Amendment IX, what say you?
@ChuziChips @thehill Only if one person doesn’t pay, when everyone do not pay who can they make pay, what say you?
@CNNPolitics WADR Has any one told Senator Warren, that only “He,” make take the oath, what say you?

@ChuziChips @thehill What you say is true if We The People, didn’t have Amendment II, all branches answer to the first department of government, “We The People, what say you?
@guardian @FRANCE24 @Pontifex @nytimes WADR when We The People as one are the first Department of every government, the few or the one would argue not, what if We The People stopped working for one week, if all the people stop providing taxes, who wins, what say you?
@thehill One of the most important questions befalling Congress, whom do they serve, enemies foreign or domestic, or “We,” the very reason any government may serve The People, We whom make government, we who allow the public servant to serve it’s People, what say you?
@FoxNews Hillary Clinton calls 2018 'a dark time for our country' my response, can always tell who is out of touch with reality, 2018 Boon to USC, The People awoke from the spell of The Marxian/Socialism which gripped our country 4ages with the help of The Elite, what say you?
@ShannonBream Natural same as you day by day😘
@KatTimpf Keep dreaming, K
@OjEruiz Herę here
@SenateFloor @HouseFloor WADR the greatest threat to our Republic is a spendthrift Congress, who hold the people as piggy banks, so Congress instead of writing a budget by Law uses the unconstitutional “CONTINUING MARXIAN RESOLUTION,” to our subjugation, what say you?

@dbongino When we vote for politicians who swear they are for America, then turn around and create Title IX, Marxian/Socialism Law that takes control of State Law and  destroys Bill of Rights. Just bc they make it a Law doesn’t make it legal, or take it away “Amendment IX,” what say you?
First SUV, good all around American know how, what say you? https://t.co/wG5mad7jVn
@Rhona_Redtail @trish_regan Abundantly acceptable that “We The People,” IAW the Fryd, Amendment II absolute, gold and silver liquid wealth, in times of instability only fools carry hope, air and bitcoin, only the well prepared carry gold and silver as tender, what say you?
@Rhona_Redtail @trish_regan USC the contract is overwhelming clear those born entitled. USC doesn’t prevent our laws to eject noncitizen and to bring for adoption the born for a better life, what say you?
@SenateFloor @HouseFloor States whom construpate USC; specifically U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Law with contempt of Amendment X, The Powers not delegated, forfeiting any and all rights to Tax payer funds contrary and not withstanding to USC, Vets need US, what say you?
@Rhona_Redtail @trish_regan With all the monies spend on alien invaders, Congress would have enormous amounts of monies to care for the mentally crippled, what say you?
@Rhona_Redtail @trish_regan Glad y’all brought this question up, opioids have gripped our children with a vengeance and y’all act like the only thing that’s important is making sure Marxian/Socialism belief of our President; makes it justified to addict our children to opioids is perfect, what say you?
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump Think about it folks 10 years ago 1.2 billion Chinese now 1.6 billion with an Asylum Law that encourages invasion, tell me how Congress Democrats who woke up and found Jesus, listen to Pelosi and others, tell US we are now open arms to whomsoever wish to enslave US, what say you?
@Rhona_Redtail @trish_regan The rise in homelessness is due to our government left unchecked by its first Department “We The People,” our Republican form worked perfectly well until Marxian/Socialism said our labor is for the good of the Politburo and not for me who labors, what say you?
@NRO @KatTimpf Title IX, unconstitutional, violates Amendment I, VI, X(powers not delegated), Art I, Sec IX, para III(ex post facto). USC Art IV, Sec III, para II, claims pockets of eminent domain over any State, interferes w/state law by use of temp tax funds, does not apply to religious, WSY?
@CNNPolitics exactly site where in the UCMJ, that enlisted will be subject to a court marshal for your created offense or @potus offends y’all, @nytimes @washingtonpost what say you?
@MattMackowiak @WashTimes An Administrative Junta happened in our government, the response is called “blaming the victim,” there is a bombardment of animus to delude exactly what happened, what say you?
@USSenate @SenateFloor @HouseFloor @USHouseofReps WADR, Senators Harris and Hirono, are contemptuous of Amendment I, and “no religious test,” clause. It is most egregious. If y’all are really for total equality, amend USC Art II, to read “he or she” as President, What say you?
@ShannonBream the KOC narrative is unconstitutional, violates “no religious test,” clause, what say you?
@trish_regan Marxian/Socialism uses a very effective form of oppression, it demonizes a system that works, and pushes a narrative that abject poverty controlled by politburo is the light ever after, what say you?
@dbongino you and I know that the tool of Marxian/Socialists; turn a right into wrong is we say tomato, they rotten tomatoes, what say you?
@MLindfors3 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 8 U.S. Code § 1158 - Asylum	US Code	Notes	Authorities (CFR)	(a) Authority to apply for asylum	(1) In general	Any alien who is physically present in the United States... may apply for asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title, WSY?
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Like your very informative analogies
@AC360 @randikayeCNN @CNN Brainwashing takes many forms, journalist or equal in animas drones who lack knowledge of racism, saying it for oppression, it labels &amp; segregates the country, separate but equal, with caustic aggression, y’all say, “he’s a racist,” how does this make us equal, what say you?
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @seanhannity Can you address the loophole in Asylum Law and that this law must be rewritten, what say you?
@MLindfors3 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @POTUS In a perfect world, it’s the first clause of this Asylum Law, a physical deterrent a wall, must be in place, or strikeout this clause, in Asylum Law, what say you?
@MLindfors3 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump What is consistently clear is The @POTUS is empowered to keep them out, that is how the Asylum Law is written, if they jump the fence, they are allowed to stay and make their case. DHS in conjunction with AG, can prevent a lot, what say you?
@thehill This melding of Representative and Senator is unconstitutional, very very scary no longer separation of powers, what say you?
@AnnCoulter The problem is Asylum Law, it was created to cause exactly that which affronts any reasonable American, catch and release, read it and weep, what say you?
@RepAlGreen The @HouseDemocrats created this egregious Asylum Law, Dec. 1952.(Vetoed by Truman), then passed 2/3 houses. It causes deflation, artificial boon. What it creates is abject poverty, by draining the Treasury and prevents the Governments mandate of paying the bills, what say you?
@AC360 @randikayeCNN When political parties 🎉 Dems GOP Marxian/Socialists spouts we got impeachment ray gun for President. This is why y’all know they’re possessed with USC deficiency syndrome, The President may inquire, unconstitutional hush funds or the like, what say you?
@IngrahamAngle @DailyCaller 8 U.S. Code § 1158 - Asylum	US Code	Notes	Authorities (CFR)	(a) Authority to apply for asylum	(1) In general @nytimes 	Any alien who is physically present in the United States; (loophole) created to maintain slavery irrespective of Amendment XIII, &amp; punish birth, what say you?
@RepAlGreen WADR who created the asylum law, since it specifically authorizes invasion; "whom ever can invade successfully will be rewarded," Representative Green who created this Kobi Ashi Maru(this hopeless scenario) when will y'all fix this egregious loop hole in asylum law, what say you?
@USSenate @SenateFloor @USHouseFloor @USHouseofReps @POTUS @nytimes @washingtonpost @FoxNews @CNN WADR I would by my hand, invoke Amendment I, “or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to Petition the government for a redress of grievances.” contra bonos mores https://t.co/dbLbI6cpmu

@SenateFloor @HouseFloor @washingtonpost @FoxNews @nytimes @CNN WADR Senate has aggrieved me bc The Senate have created a Rouge Government specially “Mr President shut up and obey, we The Senate make policy and law now,” a power not delegated to me or The Senate, what say you?
The purpose of the VP, main function is to preside over the Senate, maintain order and cast the tie breaker. To be President when extraordinary circumstances require it. So filibuster and Cloture unconstitutional, everything in its place, what say you?
@wolfblitzer Welcome to the bright side
@SenateFloor @HouseFloor WADR No.69: Hamilton “One is that to secure at all times the possibility of a definitive resolution for the body,” VP the tie breaker. Filibuster &amp; Cloture unconstitutional @nytimes @washingtonpost @FoxNews @SenSchumer VP seat at Senate, what say you?

@SenateFloor @HouseFloor @USSupremeCourt @nytimes @washingtonpost WADR the reason filibuster and cloture rule are unconstitutional, it prevents the Vice President from fulfilling his constitutional obligation to brake the tie It is not about who controls the most Indians who wins
@hughhewitt The pattern of these narratives pushed by Democratic’s by rubbing mud in the faces of The People. When @CNN @nytimes @NBCNews @washingtonpost help to keep the public stupid about USC, these egregious abuses need to be addressed by Congress as disorderly conduct by members, WSY?
@hughhewitt This a violation of no religious test clause
@hughhewitt Extremely dangerous to the preservation of USC. WADR I would beseech @POTUS as Chief Enforcement Officer, to ask Congress to apply disorderly conduct hearings, to those whom construpate Amendment I, what say you?
@POTUS WADR Mr President, you Sir are the Chief Enforcement of The Laws of the United States, but the most important of them all, thou may call for a special session of Congress when extraordinary circumstances require it, this is defined Art II, Sec III, Our Laws is thou sword,
@JudgeJeanine ask Graham about this ridiculous 60 vote rule

Simply asking, where in USC, does it allow Congress or The Supreme Court to circumvent it’s mandate, and grant law enforcement exceptions. “Not to be compelled to be witness against self,” what say you?
@AlanDersh @SenateFloor @HouseFloor @nytimes WADR sorry the exception you grant to government employees, as to Amendment V Can ye direct me, where in Amendment V, in your learned opinion that grants this exceptional Dedimus potestatem to law enforcement, Henry VIII, yea USC nay,

@SenateFloor @HouseFloor WADR The Elite, a class of persons whom have hijacked our laws, schools, universities, and USC. A system of democracy, socialism, and communism bent on destruction of USC, by nobilitation, solidified by news jangle and prattle propaganda, what say you?
@Cookiesbouy @BernardKerik @GenFlynn @GeorgePapa19 @jerome_corsi I have no version. Let me ask, when was the Last time you read The Federalist Papers and The Anti-Federalist Papers.

@BernardKerik @GenFlynn @GeorgePapa19 @jerome_corsi Soon, lying to the teacher will be felony, since it is a felony to lie to the Shire-reef, because Congress deliberately rewrote USC without Amendment.

@USSupremeCourt WADR IAW USC, The purpose of “counsel” is to advise the accused. There is no prerequisite for Justice, anyone confirmed by Senate can be justice. I would TRUST a law from farmer Joe, rather then a law from Ivy League with USC deficiency syndrome, what say you?
@USSupremeCourt WADR Chief Justice as I peruse USC and Art III, help me here cause I know and pretty sure Congress can not only delegate it’s power as well as SCOTUS without Amendment. Only Congress May affect the President by vote. USC prevents ridiculous sycophantic rants, WSY?

@marklevinshow On the money Mark
@SenateFloor lower CT’s cannot compell @POTUS to rescind Executive Privilege, or interfere with Executive, Only Congress can interfere, rescind any or all Executive Orders with 2/3rds both houses. Doesn’t it say or mean even the traffic court can control President, what say you?
@SenateFloor WADR y’all were not in Session when DOJ, resigned, and interim ADOJ was appointed, which is constitutionally correct, @realDonaldTrump has mandate to appoint Art II, what say you?
@SenateFloor WADR how is it that our criminal justice system is now a business, y’all salivate at how y’all can further subjugate the People by taxation, instead of the use of taxation for the People’s business, FYI, communism/socialism was answer to Success of USC, what say you?
@Ocasio2018 USC stops no idea, or any kind of belief, it requires elected official no matter what you or others believe, to prevent its eradication. If you believe in fairness, eliminate in the state the several states, construpation  of Amendment XIV at all CT’s, what say you?

@SenateFloor WADR the investigation of a duly elected President w/o 2/3rds vote of both houses inappropriate upon President Trump as well it was done against President Carter USC allows resistance not usurpation, all &amp; any appropriation of taxes requires @POTUS sig, what say you?
@SenateFloor @nytimes WADR DOJ 1999 Reno Regs circumvents USC no mention of @POTUS investigation since only Congress 2/3rds vote can do. Mueller is disqualified since he is retired government, this isn’t witch-hunt it’s Administrative Junta accountability Sir/Madam, what say you?
@RoyalFamily Thank you
@SenateFloor WADR there are still holdovers whom voted for Line Item Veto legislation (making @POTUS  king) 1996, USC deficient Representatives and Senators, USC requires oath of mandamus, I ask for accountability for this egregious assault, what say you?
@JonathanTurley Due process thought, basically is as though Court is saying Jim Acosta works for White House, and fired, and the reason USC makes it clear, The President accountable 2/3rds both houses, to prevent Executive disruption and sycophantic lawsuits, what say you?

@Judgenap what I seem to hear you say the Branches of government may act autonomously, USC, mandates that all branches must concur concerning anything, and if The President vetoes, Congress can reverse with 2/3 vote, Mandamus, what say you?
@Judgenap today’s problems can be traced back to this chipping away of USC. USC is Supreme, that’s way it takes the Collective Will to change it. It is our Collective Contract, and under Amendment X, The People can and must  invoke mandamus, what say you?
@Judgenap I disagree with your analysis, power to appoint, simply, Art II, Sec II, para III, is absolute, Congress cannot write ANY THING that alters ANY ARTICLE or AMENDMENT, not IAW Art V, jus cause they find it outside their control, USC requires it, what say you?
@dbongino @SebGorka On the money, @dbongino
@SenateFloor WADR IAW USC, Amendment XIV, Sec II, that in The State, The Several States, and Contiguous Lands, only citizens can vote, and can be denied right to vote, “or other crimes,” so how is it that non-citizens or States whom circumvent USC, get away with it, what say you?

@SenateFloor WADR, IAW USC, Art II, Sec II, para III, The President has a constitutional mandate, neither branch may invoke autonomy, shadow investigations like all appropriation of taxes to pave any road of good intentions, must pass through all, USC, mandates it, what say you?
@NextRevFNC @SteveHiltonx Here, here, thank you Sir,
@AlanDersh IAW USC, Art I, Sec 7, para III, to prevent Administrative Junta’s Congress must present to @POTUS for concurrence every concern, if vetoed, then Congress can override 2/3 concurrence, like SC question, “powers not delegated,” what say you?
@SenateFloor WADR, IAW USC, Art I, Sec VII, para III, Special Counsel, not presented to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS for concurrence, is a “THING,” and all departments to act in agreement or as 2/3 of House and Senate may concur to prevent Administrative Junta,  what say you?

@SenateFloor No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, equal rights, as long as Citizens are not labeled, labeling implies persons, persons are not Citizens, hence opprobrious labels, what say you?
@TheFive Juan, IDK whatcha smoking, but your reasoning is out of this world, what say you?
@TheDemocrats you have perpetuated for 150 years that in order for The People to attaining equal rights we all must be separated by opprobrious labels, which created the very racism you keep harping we should end. Amendment XIV equal rights, requires we are citizens or persons,
@NextRevFNC Here, here!
@SenateFloor when I say no title of nobility, is clause in USC, which wouldn’t raise an eyebrow right. But what would you say, that what I’m really sayin, is, when tax payer money is used to give advantages to the few or the One, isn’t this just misappropriation, what say you
@SenateFloor I ask as to why in the twenty first century, ignorance is still bliss. Senate Confirmation hearings are job interviews, and the rights of man, don’t  apply. Heresy, treason, witchcraft, red scare, now RAPE. No Titles of Nobility, explain ur limo driver, what say you?
@USSenate you folks kill me, allegations by adult gang raped by under age HS boys, 10x’s, wouldn’t this be more effectively called child molestation by an adult, what say you?
@SenateFloor Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, IAW USC, Art II, Sec I, para VII, “He,” is not changed, or altered by Amendment XIV. Article II, requires an Amendment to read “he or she.” Until such time Article II is amended, a women cannot run for President, what say you?
@realDonaldTrump My brother thanks you,
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, IAW USC, use not party affiliations, since it might instill insurrection, unless insurrection is the purpose of using party affiliations. To which The President is mandated to quell, what say you?
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, IAW USC, throughout session, laws, acts, or the like, enacted not IAW English states laws. You enact USC, Supreme Law, are ye state legislature or are ye Constitutionalists as members, what say you?
@SenateFloor Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, IAW USC, there no parties in Session, only representatives of your state, or senators from your state, IAW Amendment X, I invoke my right, out of many One, redress to restore USC, and members use of party to be fined heavily?
@SenateFloor Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, IAW USC, in session there are no parties. How do the members redress sexual assault by sitting members,  or while certain members steal heroism from ghosts of wars past, what say you?

@USSenate Senator Booker, your reasoning, not persuasive, since y’all as your Constitutional obligation, circumvent US. As a member of committee go forth and investigate. What is as clear as the heavens, failure of due process by certain members, what say you?
@USSenate let me understand this reasoning, that intentional withholding of allegations and evidence, as we are being told by Senators, is how our Republican government functions, yes Mn Senator the The People did ordain, innocent until proven guilty, what say you?
@USSenate when y’all so passionately implore The People, that Senate beliefs are more important than USC, allegations proof, liken to prove innocence while the guillotine looms above your neck, and FBI should now be The National Police, you’re kidding right?
@USSenate as I listen, to yeas and nays of confirmation committee, does it now say or mean that that subjugation by labels is not enough, the powerful push to elevate the FBI, to National Police Force in the State, in the Several States and the Contiguous lands, what say you?
@senatemajldr the Accuser told the People, that Justice Kavanaugh, in her opinion was not worthy, hence the secret allegations to Senator Feinstein. USC, allegations are not secret, Amendment VI, jus askin?
@AC360 @David_Gergen This pretext or not is “A Clear and Present Danger,” this confirmation is not about allegations of Rape on a Citizen, This RAPE of USC, is what is going on, The Monarchy thinks it found the demise of USC, not even the amending USC, during Civil War, can revoke USC, what say you?
@AC360 @David_Gergen and don’t forget to bring a bale of hay for the Tiajuana donkey. The Rape, more and more looks very convincing, The Rape of USC, is being witnessed by The People whom are in turn being Raped, by The Monarchy and Fake News Media, what say you,

@haldysays @SenatorCollins It is extremely disparaging when Congress has resurrected The Lord Chancellor, above the law and accountable to no one, what say you?
@SenatorCollins Dear Senator, I am very much concerned that now Mr Rosenstein’s  use of public servants as limo driver and body guard, from tax payer dollars, these perquisites create separate but equal, what say you?
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, Brown v Board of ED, did not change separate but equal. Opprobrious labels are still used today. The reason Democratic’s don’twant The People to be identifiable as Citizens, it prevents slavery by Labels, Wht, Blk, Hispanic, etc.
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, isn’t this Democratic Assassination of Bret Kavanaugh, is to set precedent, so y’all can say see anyone can be assassinated when we want, “just call anyone rapist,” The Monarchy Tool Of Slavery, as opprobrious labels to prevent civil rights
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, Public Servants don’t pay taxes, tax money so Public Servants have armed guards and property protection, an Army of Tax Collectors to force us to keep y’all in the elite life y’all become accustom to from the shirts off our backs, HUMBUG!
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, there are no, I repeat no parties at Congress in session, there are Only Representatives or Senators, the use of party affiliation is in direct violation of USC, disorderly, and implies Usurpations, Please stop blaming the victim syndrome

@cher It’s so baffling that y’all Monarchy Elites use this self fulfilling prophecy, irrespective of the equal rights Amendment XIV. Using politically correct labels, white, black, etc, you are either a citizen or you are a person. Non immune to slavery propaganda elites have created
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, “shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Amendment IX, assassinating a Citizens livelihood over a unverified document like HRC dossier, &amp; Ford WAPO art is a setup for failure which includes your seat,
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress, the polygraph test and questions asked to attest to allegations from Accuser Ford must be made public so We The People, May determine the base of this allegation, and not suppressed child abuse? Jus askin?
@USSenate there is two types of Justice in America, equal protection of the laws for the Monarchy/Public Servants and the laws y’all have created to keep us all subjugated since The Deplorable and The DREGs deserves nothing less, as your Majesty’s pleases, what say you?

@FoxNews The President is the only Citizen given the power to pardon. States, Local government, Prosecutors or the Judiciary are not granted this power. When pardon by The President, is a final decree, The Document is Supreme, EVERYTHING IN ITS PLACE, Amendment X, jus sayin?
@USSenate let me understand this Act, irrespective of Amendment VI, Star Chamber is legal, cause you are from the government and you are here to help and protect us. What happens when we have 500 lawyers to Rep us 1/2 billion laws to protect y’all from “WE WHO GOVERN,” jus askin?

@USSenate I understand how y’all have created an arbitration clause for the sole purpose of waving enumerated rights, except the smoke y’all blow up our noses, does not negate Amendment IX, Americans citizens can’t wave rights, and can’t be made to do so,

@CindiTurchik @TomFitton What we have learned since this Kobayashi Maru, these hopeless scenarios, Reps and Sen, are using the unquestioned speeches clause USC, to usurp USC, 1. Lack of knowledge USC, and do or enact ANYTHING to construpate USC, we must vote these Borg out of office, failed oath to USC
@USSenate Dear Ladies and Gentlemen of The Senate, are ye in contempt of Amendment X, you have no power to judge or rule on any crime alleged to happen in a State, accuser is required by Amendment X, bring charges in State it happened. You can listen for advice and consent only
@TomFitton Yeah, NO! Senate cannot circumvent USC, and this is “Tom Foolery,” exactly what crime did Justice Kavanaugh commit, Senator Feinstein is withholding/failed to submit allegations to Committee, allegations are what is intended to be proved, WADR..is this incompetence or negligence

@SpeakerRyan respectfully, erase US Patriot Act, Congress cannot abdicate it's power to public servant, Republic Government requires it.
@SpeakerRyan Congress by Act or Law cannot abdicate Rights Amend IX, Reg of Ins, yes, create business no, create Ins competition yes,

@TuckerCarlson by trying to remove that already retained, Amend IX, I would ask the Oath Keepers, petition for redress, and recall elections
@TuckerCarlson Tanx, for interview w/gov of Texas, I fully understand, that the Democratic Monarchy would force US into subjugation
Fed, is not representatives of business making, rather they are representatives of regulating business for the good of the nation as a Whole

@marthamaccallum FBI works for President, President may require any department to account for its actions, USC

@seanhannity problem education, no mandatory understanding of language of Founders of USC!? Why!?

@billmaher Bill, you really believe the enumerated rights USC extends to non-citizens, Protect of laws, not enumerated rights, what say you?
Amendment XIV Sec. I, is for equal protection of the Laws, though virtually not existent several states, Doesn't mean Sanctuary City?
@seanhannity @GeraldoRivera Amendment X, powers not delegated, Immigration, Fed, States are to follow laws by Congress on immigration
So depressing for the people, since the teaching of the fundamental rights USC, no longer a part of grade school for decades, why?
The USC strictly prohibits titles of nobility, the addressing of former political positions as present position creates titles of nobility
Sorry, former political position, not entitlement to carry title of present position, word, former, previous, was must precede former title
@seanhannity the back bone of Law throughout the United States is USC, President is required under oath, "defend against all enemies"
@seanhannity you're pro-choice? what say you on the meaning on this choice?
Media take notice, present the truth, whole truth, by Oath and allegiance to Amendment I
Totally unacceptable for Americans to treat each other as less than first last and alway, we are Oath Keepers?
Last century and beginning of this, eradication of men, women, and babies thought to be okay by some, this ok, what say you?
I have lost my belief in the Media, can't tell if it's news fit to read, or view, or believe any longer, what happened to freedom of press?
Trump keeps promise, starts Draining the Swamp?
Pretty creepy when news worthy are not reported, instead who resigned at State Dept, is nothing I care about, free press no longer?
@SpeakerRyan can Congress by Law remedy the inscription entrance of SCOUS, I ask for this, I pray for this, please make this so
Abusive remarks, gestures and speeches by celebrities directed to POTUS are merely publicity stunts to prop up waning careers, non-event
@SpeakerRyan under the law implies people are beneath the law, of the laws completes connection with the laws
@SpeakerRyan the inscription at entrance USSC, not IAW Amendment XIV sec 1; "equal protection of the laws" not under the law?
Cabal, intrigue and corruption, founders greatest fear, so electoral vote was the best to prevent popularity and manipulation of President
People prevented the Founders greatest fear, cabal, intrigue and corruption, by way of electoral vote, Bingo!
I found Senator Schumers at POTUS Inauguration speech extremely inflammatory, inappropriate, and questionable since not said at Senate?
Politicians and Celebrities have the same thing in common, that their livelihood is determined by the People, retweet if you agree?
What we learned 2016, how the Press had been pulling the wool over eyes 👀 for far too long
@TheFive it warms me cockles, that this Inauguration, is about local boys, and women, not celebrities
@TheFive Bob is out of touch, as well as Hillary was, it's time to DTS, and POTUS is right on, as First member of the Collective Will
Hay Cali, your 55 electoral went to Dems, how come you should get more? Time to get to business
@TheFive Juan  p'd me off, in the end he made us smile, Bob.... nah
@SpeakerRyan can members of Congress write books 📚 for profit irrespective of Article VI, just asking?
@FaceTheNation tweeting neutralizes press to tell news as they think it not how it happened
@MeetThePress the Democratic Monarchy has people in 3 trillion per year ACA debt and would continue us in this subjugation, why?
@MeetThePress the Media told us everyday Hillary was president and all others go home. Responsibility of interference rest on the Press
@MeetThePress when did the Democratic Monarchy become royalty and demonizing our Constitutional way of life
Tweeting is instantaneous communications, I like it,
As long as the Democratic Monarchy think 💭 not concrete evidence, think is enough to prove point
@TuckerCarlson why American's now forced to apologize to the Democratic Monarchy because America maintains constitutional values
@TuckerCarlson this guy you just interviewed is one of the reasons why I voted for Trump, DTS
That a government is lead to greatness by the Collective Will, that the will of the people shall prevail first last and always
The People of the parchment, the Oath Keepers, invoked their rights so that others may know, it's about the needs of the many
Turn out the lights the Democratic Monarchy party party 🎉 is over, it's time for new prosperity
Freedom of speech whether by tweets or Golden Globes, is protected speech
Democratic Monarchy i.e. Created super predator law to protect themselves from Minorities; then call everyone else racist?
Washington Post fake news is tagged as a propaganda mill, more and more everyday the Media cannot be trusted with free press?
@TuckerCarlson Amendment 14 is misunderstood, rights of humanity as a person in a state cannot be denied, does not make you a citizen!
Senetor Paul, shouldn't insurance be based on catastrophic care when needed, cheap over all?
I would ask that to up hold Amendment 1, invocation of rights, up hold responsibility to the document USC or relinquish that right!
@BretBaier as for me the hacking is smoke, the Hammer 🔨 is on the money, intel needs revamping
@TheFive you folks are easy,
@FoxNews free speech great, knowing what pres-elect is thinking and we the people know instantly....priceless
Any dissemination that a dept of gov accountable to the people will exact tribute on whim, reeks of any THING to the Contrary
If the Commander in Chiel elect does not have confidence in intel community he can IAW USC revamp it under executive privilege, Press wacky
Under the emoluments clause Art 6 the purpose of Congress to do the people's business, how is it now writing books is the norm?
Can some explain to me that under the emoluments clause Art 6, that politicians can now write books in office on tax payer salary?
WOW! The greatest events in US history has happened, that people are again as ONE with USC "we the people" oh baby, baby 👶
If the street has created elation in the market to serve the Democratic Monarchy than Wall Street and people are the biggest losers?
The pres election is over, what we need to do to get people from under 20 Trillion ton💲debt and security is really more important
Democratic Monarchy lost election cause Republic united plurality "made it so!" Time to get over it.
The Democratic Monarchy today, their loss must be remedied by the violation of USC, and the president be given to the rabble demands
What's with all this pansy news from the Media, that America should grovel to other nations, can you all just stop?

@AC360 how can a rational man accept strong suggestion as truth, is all this reality hype to sell Media
@AC360 question, with all the fake news, how can daily pubs and media be trusted again with Amendment 1?

HRC WATER 💦 BALLOON ABOUT TO BURST; Why is she sequestered?
Another media/estabmt allegation that wiki leaks is cause of Ruski's, where's the evidence, when we see hard evidence emails about HRC
Is it an affront on freedom when unproven allegations are  made more crooked than corruption in our government to cause distraction?
CNN after 1st and 2nd debate used vote sample of mainly Democratic's and few Republicans  for poll how is that not rigged?
Are the Democratic's campaigning for HRC on their time and their money or are they using tax payer time and  funds?
When the Pres or VP campaign for HRC, do they use DNC money or tax payer money, use of tax funds an impeachable offense?

@realDonaldTrump wiki, wiki, wiki, defend you think you must, wiki, wiki, wiki, use it you must, win, win, you must
Believe NYT's will retract, since allegations of DJT, not substantiated, it is a Thing yet to be proved, irrespective he said
With all due Respect To HRC, does anything sanction to her rise to level of a misdemeanor, this would make her null and void
If no deleted emails why the flood of Clinton emails, if you have no knowledge of what your staff are doing who controls HRC, who is in pwr
Telling the people the Ruski's responsible for email hack, tells people government failure in domestic security 🚨
