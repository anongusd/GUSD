.@CNNOpinion roundup on challenging week for @realDonaldTrump.	https://t.co/LBaTNILK74
For those who missed my #AxeFiles on @CNN show with @ewarren tonight, or want to hear more of the conversation, the podcast is up at @#axefilespodcast.com! https://t.co/ZTINMCATQx
@VVeraldi Labradoodle
Here is mine. https://t.co/k6NczAncYU
.@ewarren on her ubiquitous companion, Bailey: “For me there's something about a dog that just kind of grounds you in life," she said. "And whatever today seems noisy and aggravating, it's a dog that brings you back." #AxeFiles on @CNN
What must Democrats do in 2020? "My view of this is that our job now for the next year is to make the case for how we can do better… I think that the politics of division are not working for us." -@ewarren on the #AxeFiles @CNN
The CFPB was once an idea in @ewarren's head and now is a real government watchdog. Despite attempts by @realDonaldTrump to curb it, she says, “The agency is still there. It's still a cop on the beat. It's still working." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Twist of history: If she’d been named director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau she helped create, @ewarren says she wouldn’t have run for Senate. “I'd have stayed... because that would have been the way that I could have made a difference.” #AxeFiles on @CNN
The controversy around @ewarren's claims to Native American heritage have dogged her since ‘12. Does she regret it? "It never had anything to do with my getting a job. Even so, I shouldn't have done it... I can't go back. All I can do is go forward." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Warren's father suffered a heart attack when she was 12. Her mom got a min wage job that "saved our house &amp; it saved our family. Now, for a long time I thought that was a story just about my mother. Then I came to understand it's the story of millions of families." #AxeFiles @CNN
Are @ewarren's bold policies realistic? She says "you don't have to have perfection but you also have to pay attention to where the people are. The Wealth Tax, for example...It's not only that Ds like it, that Independents like it — the majority of Rs say that's a sensible idea."
"Who actually is going to have the power in Washington? That's what I believe the election of 2020 is going to be all about... We have to build a foundation of people who are engaged in democracy again and it's happening out there." -@ewarren on what‘s at stake in 2020 #AxeFiles
Despite her relentless attacks on Wall Street, @ewarren says she isn't at odds with capitalism. "I support markets. ... But markets without rules… that's corruption, that's capture of our government by the richest and most powerful around us."
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; @ewarren say the system is “rigged.” “He did run on that &amp; then he got in and did a 180-degree turn," she says on the #AxeFiles. He "put enough Goldman Sachs bankers in his admin that they could open their own branch office…That is rigging the system."
@ananavarro All the best, my friend! xoxo
@AmericanCMR @CNN And let me know what you think!!
Please watch and see for yourself!  Tonight at 7 ET on @CNN! https://t.co/xhgjFXUHzy
Listening to @BernieSanders at outdoor rally thank the Weathermen.  Thought, at first, he was having some kind of ‘60s flashback but it turns out he was referring to the forecasters.
How will @ewarren handle @realdonaldtrump twitter bombs on the campaign trail? “You’ve got to push back. You never let bullies run over you.” 	Don’t miss the #AxeFiles TONIGHT 7pm ET on @CNN! https://t.co/EuvfMHpiJl
Remember how @realDonaldTrump used the Warmbier family as props at the 2018 State of the Union, where he went on at length about the murder of their son Otto and the brutality of Kim Jung Un?	That was then.  	This is now. https://t.co/x69lnMbATE
More to the point, no Democrat I know is particularly surprised.  	This is a future partnership rooted in shared values-or lack of them.	https://t.co/n9ITcVfcOz
He simply feels lying is justifiable when it suits his purposes.
Two different-but related-stories in the last 24 hours.	1) @realDonaldTrump lied about overruling Intel objections and ordering top secret security clearance for his son-in-law.	2) @realDonaldTrump embraced Kim’s outrageous lie about the heinous murder of Otto Warmbier.
In fairness, this scenario didn’t materialize.  @realDonaldTrump shockingly gave  Kim a pass on the murder of Otto Warmbier,  but no deal. https://t.co/ggD6BegZaP
He’s a legendary broadcast journalist and award-winning documentarian; the mellifluous narrator of the Anchorman movies and announcer for @waitwait on @NPR.  And an incomparable storyteller! 	My #AxeFiles convo with Bill Kurtis!	https://t.co/Wp6M0zWNdh https://t.co/e3Z9wcIFMw
I agree with this. @AOC asked incisive questions of Cohen on the tax and legal implications  of how Trump values his properties.   Real news.	https://t.co/XcCUW7bfPG
“But make no mistake: the Republicans on the oversight committee, who spent two years overlooking alleged wrongdoing by the president, would have been fine if Cohen had kept on lying on Trump's behalf.” https://t.co/9LPSDwaVjd
Wonder if Kim Jung Un is calculating that @realDonaldTrump will be looking for a bright shiny object for to turn the page on the Cohen hearing.  If so, the dictator may see this summit as a chance to grab a bargain.	Which is scary.
Just to be a finer point on this: @realDonaldTrump relied on Cohen for a decade to handle his most sensitive issues.   He was widely  known as Trump’s “fixer.”	Now the president’s defenders on the committee call the man Trump entrusted w/ his secrets a “pathological criminal.”
Jordan asks Cohen why he stayed in the employ of @realDonaldTrump for ten years, given all Cohen said today about him.	But isn’t it also fair to ask, given all that Trump has said about Cohen, why did he keep him close all those years?
Pretty brazen that @RepMattGaetz, who is not a member of the House Oversight Committee, flamboyantly sauntered through the committee room moments before the Cohen hearing, a day after flagrantly threatening Cohen via a disgusting salacious Tweet.
Useful that Jim Jordan spent his pre-political career in wrestling, as he appears determined to lock the committee in a clench.
Cohen’s statement would have had more power without the gratuitous barbs spiced throughout.  They detract from the genuine importance of some of his claims.  Whoever drafted it did him and the search for truth a real disservice.
.@GOP strategy around Cohen hearing is clear from the outset:  Gum up the works.  Depict it as a wholly political exercise.  Impeach Cohen as a liar.
Had a great #AxeFiles  conversation with @ewarren about her campaign, career and the life experiences that shaped them.  Join us Saturday at 7 EST on @CNN! https://t.co/abWlem9bVV
Chicago will have its first African-American woman mayor after April’s runoff election between former prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and County Board President Toni Preckwinkle.	 https://t.co/BXueTyryHy
“This is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas.”	@RepMattGaetz, after Tweeting and then deleting a menacing stink bomb implying stuff about Michael Cohen’s private life on the eve of his testimony to House Intel.	Pretty sleazy marketplace!
After all that’s transpired, how in the world could this guy possibly have run?	I’m sure that point was made clear to him by many Rs in NC.	https://t.co/F5F2ht0oR5
Chicago votes tomorrow and it’s like watching a turtle race.  The pace has been slow.  No one has made all that much progress.  Several of the 14 candidates could be among the two who cross the finish line and sneak into a runoff.  Crazy.
There is still lingering bitterness among some HRC supporters from 2016; questions about his age and the practicality-or even wisdom-of his ideas.  But, as he showed tonight, Bernie’s a feisty old bird, who isn’t going away.
Whatever you think about @BernieSanders, he’s unapologetically who he is, holds deeply held beliefs—and has held them for a long, long time!  In other words, authentic.	#CNNTownHall
In new Pew Poll, climate change falls to the bottom of concerns voters believe @realDonaldTrump and Congress should focus on in 2019.	It may be the greatest gap between public sentiment and the catastrophic stakes of inaction we’ve seen since the isolationism of the 1930s. https://t.co/jGqtqg0Z85
My #AxeFiles convo with the always blunt and incisive former Sen. Claire McCaskill, @clairecmc, on the political burden of experience, Dems in 2020 and what her old @GOP colleagues say about @realDonaldTrump behind closed doors. https://t.co/Wp6M0Aeo4P https://t.co/duYYLEaNYQ

The smart money says @PeteButtigieg, a 37-year-old; Midwestern mayor has absolutely no chance to be the Dem nominee.  But then there is this.	https://t.co/sDtTbJn0o2
Chicago police Supt. Eddie Johnson, who assigned a dozen detectives to investigate an alleged deplorable hate crime that turned out to be a disposable hoax: “I just wish that the families of gun violence in this city got this much attention.”
The exploitation of racism and homophobia for personal gain is cynical and abhorrent, whether the offender is a public official or a celebrity.	https://t.co/f3HqbTMFno
The @smerconish story is extraordinary, from young @GOP operative to Philly trial lawyer, columnist, national talk radio and TV host and author.  And he’s a hell of a story teller! #AxeFiles 	https://t.co/Wp6M0zWNdh https://t.co/tSaSPKPWDv
It will probably take well north of $100M just to navigate the first four Dem contests (plus CA.) That @BernieSanders raised $4 million online in the 12 hours after entering the race is no small thing.	Turns out you can raise millions flaying millionaires &amp; billionaires!

"I can pretty safely say this is the first time in my political career that I thought the essence of America was being debated."	.@senatemajldr dogs Left.  But not a peep about the steady assault from @POTUS on freedom of the press; the rule of law; U.S. alliances and values?
The scourge of violent crime in Chicago is of critical concern. That’s why @UChiPolitics, along w/the @HarrisSchool and the @UChicago Crime Lab, are inviting the finalists in next week’s election for a 3/13 forum to share their ideas.	 https://t.co/hUmooku74s 	(Via Sun-Times)
That is very fair commentary.  Presumably, given his account, there were other witnesses who could verify or dismiss McCabe’s account.  I bet Congress will be eager to hear from them, as this is explosive stuff! (No pun intended) https://t.co/Q7UWG61pJJ
“I don’t care. I believe Putin.”	Stunning words McCabe ascribes to @realDonaldTrump  when U.S. Intel chiefs briefed him on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
Thanks for the heads up.  I missed it but I’ll have to take a look! https://t.co/miFejizvC9
RT @MarkHertling: @davidaxelrod Interesting...received a note from an allied friend who attended the @MunSecConf and saw @LindseyGrahamSC…
@KPenniall @JussieSmollett Yes
The racist/homophobic attack @JussieSmollett alleged was horrific.	But if this story turns out to be a hoax, orchestrated by Smollett to boost his career, he  will have cynically betrayed supporters across the country and slandered a great city.	https://t.co/dt6rLG9NA7
Pretty sure John McCain would have been thundering against Trump’s unconstitutional order.  Wonder what advice he would have given his dear friend.
Watching @LindseyGrahamSC  defending the @realDonaldTrump dubious emergency order/raid on military funds, it’s mind-boggling how far He’s traveled from caustic Trump critic to outspoken acolyte.  But he’s made the calculation that this is what re-election in SC in 2020 requires.
In his early 20s, Pat Caddell was a pathbreaking prodigy in polling &amp; messaging.  But his life also was a parable about the dangers of flamboyant success at an early age.  You can spend the rest of your life frantically chasing your own legend. RIP	https://t.co/w6ezSDQiqE
I’ve said it before but it is sickening to think how “normal” mass shootings have become; how numbed we are to these stories.  It’s as if they are now so commonplace that we’re resigned to accept them and epidemic gun violence as an immutable fact of life.	https://t.co/jvl6NrUIWf
How would you like to be the government lawyer assigned to defend this litany of lies?	When it comes to his beloved  border wall, the truth is no boundary for @realDonaldTrump.	https://t.co/JkkEolOUm7
One thing we surely have learned by now, which was reenforced again today: @realDonaldTrump does not feel constrained by any  rules, norms, institutions or laws.	Dismaying in anyone.	Dangerous in a president!
I’ve said from the start that @realDonaldTrump would issue an emergency order, regardless of its foundation in law or fact.  He needs it for his base, and if the courts stop him—as they almost certainly will—he’ll have gone to the wall trying.
20 yrs ago, my valiant wife, Susan, founded Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy to save others from the pain our child has known.	She sat down with @CURE board member @KellyGC411 on @SeizingLifePod to talk about the mission &amp; the journey.	https://t.co/Aj81ZDNelY via @YouTube

Northam is persuasive about his evolution as a person and had he made those comments in the first place and left it there, he would be on firmer ground.	But it’s still confounding as to why he confessed to something so definitively that he categorically denied 24 hours later.
He burst on the scene in ‘08  by correctly calling 49 of 50 states. Today, political junkies &amp; sports nuts hang on his every forecast. But who IS @NateSilver538?

As a wise young man just said to me,  “When the question is ‘Were you the guy in black face or the guy in the hood,’ it’s hard to see any scenario under which this ends well for Northam.”	I’d add, “Or did you just admire the photo so much you decided to put it on your page?”

"Those of us lucky enough to come back, I think, bear the responsibility to lead a life of purpose. We survived when a lot of people didn't," @JohnKerry reflecting on the forthcoming 50th anniversary of the ambush in Vietnam for which he got the Silver Star. #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@JohnKerry on outspoken new generation of leaders: "I welcome (their) energy and honesty and readiness...to move the country...I get a sense that they just are incredulous at the idiocy of what is happening in Washington today.  They feel challenged by it." #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@JohnKerry went to prep schools abroad from an early age: "I first got dropped off at school in Switzerland…I didn't know where Switzerland was…I was not prepared for the abruptness &amp; my parents getting in a car &amp; driving off…but it opened my view to the world." #AxeFiles
.@JohnKerry on lessons learned from his '04 race and the false attacks on his military record: "One of the things I learned, I would never allow minutes to go by now without adequately putting to bed anything that you know to be untrue. You HAVE to do that." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Is @JohnKerry running for POTUS in '20? "I haven't taken anything off the table… I don't think it's important to be talking about who's in and who's out…. I'm going to be in the middle of the debate no matter what, period." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Former SecState @JohnKerry: "The fact that the President (@BarackObama) didn't wind up bombing (Syria)...did cost us in perception in the region and I spent a lot of time trying to address that." #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@SecPompeo recently rebuked Obama's foreign policy during a speech in Egypt. "Who's kidding who? Are you kidding me?" @JohnKerry said. "When a @POTUS…says 'I believe Putin, not my intel community... that's a moment of shame." #AxeFiles on @CNN https://t.co/ExnJZIrAAP
.@JohnKerry: "I think it's a mistake to have the word impeachment floating through the air right now, because it politicizes things...I think it would be a mistake for Democrats to sort of run headlong in without evidence. Let's see what Robert Mueller says." #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@JohnKerry: "If you have an email coming from a Russian operative who is saying 'We have dirt on Hillary Clinton' &amp; you have another email coming back from the son of the candidate saying 'Wow we love that. We want to meet. Can't wait for the meeting' That's collusion" #AxeFiles
.@JohnKerry: "I know from our trips to Russia, everything you do and say is being listened to and is being followed...(and) from...personnel I've talked to that there is huge credibility within the intel community to the so-called Steele dossier." #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@JohnKerry on "false presumption" of Trump's America First: "Every President puts America first, but they don't do it in the same way that Donald Trump has, where he's breaking things apart without any alternatives that makes us safer." #AxeFiles on @CNN now!

I was struck that one of the young Americans whose remains the @POTUS greeted this morning at Dover was a Syrian immigrant and naturalized citizen who was was working for the military as a translator.  I wonder if @realDonaldTrump thought about that?
Looks like it may be warmed over nothing to create illusion of movement.  A temp DACA reprieve-which is already in place-in exchange for funding for a wall that experts say is an extravagant waste.  The wall is a symbol.  It’s not security.  And what happened to Mexico paying?🤫
The details also are important.  What is he actually offering?

Here’s the question: If @realDonaldTrump feels he could shoot someone in broad daylight on 5th Avenue and his base would stick with him, why is he so fearful they would flee if he opened their government?
The torque this shutdown is putting on the economy and @POTUS approval ratings is gaining by the day.	Even with the tub-thumpers on the Right giving him “attaboys,” @realDonaldTrump is a ratings junkie and he has to know this isn’t good for him.	He needs a way out!

.@RahmEmanuel on his city: "There are 140 languages spoken in our...schools. People from every walk of life, every part of the city who have a kind of Chicago swagger. They're down to earth. They're grounded. And they're not scared to tell you what they think of you!" #AxeFiles

If you missed my #AxeFiles conversation with Justice Sonia Sotomayor on @CNN, or would like to hear more of it, the podcast is up now! https://t.co/6FqN9idg37
Justice Sotomayor on @TheJudge44 and her beloved @Yankees: "You know something very special about Aaron Judge and I? We share a similar number. His jersey number is 99. I'm the 99th associate justice of the Supreme Court." #AxeFiles on @CNN https://t.co/1lfgM5bD6O
Sotomayor delivered a powerful dissent in the travel ban case b/c "when we have people who believe they've been discriminated against, someone should speak their views and speak it with real feeling…it is at the foundation of this country that we don't discriminate" #AxeFiles
Sotomayor was a trial judge before she was a Supreme Court Justice. It was an invaluable experience b/c "you always have the defendant there. You can see their families…you're always aware of how these cases affect them… it's not theoretical. &amp; the impact is visible." #AxeFiles
On the burden of being a trailblazer, Justice Sotomayor said: "people come up to me and say things like 'you show my kids that their success can happen. We rely on you to continue showing them that.' That's a lot of pressure." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Sotomayor's dissent in the affirmative action case came from her own experience. During her confirmation process she said critics wrote "that I wasn't smart enough" &amp; "somehow a favoritism was being shown to me &amp; that somehow I didn't measure up to the other candidates" #AxeFiles
Sotomayor had a tumultuous childhood, but books became her salvation: "I started to read and I realized that it was a wonderful way to escape from gloom. And a wonderful way to travel the world." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Justice Sotomayor was diagnosed with diabetes as a young child. It taught her "to squeeze out of life every minute that I could, to make every moment in my life meaningful in some way" and "the fear of dying young taught me how precious life is." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Sotomayor on the importance of police/community relations: "I actually do think that we have to spend a lot more time seeing each other as human beings and not objects of our work or objects of our resistance… And I worry that we've created others of each other" #AxeFiles @CNN
The response in PR after the hurricane was personal for Sotomayor: "most Americans think of Puerto Ricans as foreigners...not realizing that we're citizens above all else...Maria &amp; its aftermath has left a lot of Qs as to whether people truly appreciate how American we are"
Is the #MeToo movement overdue? Sotomayor thinks "the fact that we're having a national discussion around and about this issue is always a good thing. If the convo stops one person from taking an action that could be questioned then it's worthwhile, isn't it?" #AxeFiles on @CNN
Justice Sotomayor on welcoming Kavanaugh: "When you're charged with working together for most of the remainder of your life, you have to create a relationship. The nine of us are now a family." The #AxeFiles on @CNN now
Justice Sotomayor on the makeup of the new Supreme Court: "Do I suspect that I might be dissenting a bit more? Possibly... but you know, let's see." Catch the #AxeFiles at 7pm ET TONIGHT on @CNN! https://t.co/0we6y8gLki

For those who missed the #AxeFiles on @CNN with @Schwarzenegger, or want to hear more, the podcast is up! https://t.co/IdpLvr0Ilr https://t.co/COV8JK1qXj
Would @schwarzenegger have run for president if he were constitutionally eligible to run? “I would've run. Because I never go...for something that is not going all the way.” #AxeFiles on @CNN
Another @schwarzenegger departure from @realDonaldTrump. "I'm a globalist…I don't have an enemy out there. There is no country or no continent that I look as bad, as evil, as anything like this...the more we make the globe a marketplace the more we can be successful in America.”
.@Schwarzenegger knew from an early age that sports, and bodybuilding in particular, was a way to escape austere life in post-war Austria: “I thought that will be my ticket to America. That's exactly what happened.” #AxeFiles on @CNN
Why has it been so hard to get us to care about climate change? "I think environmentalists have done a terrible job in selling this," @schwarzenegger said. They must talk about the immediate impact: "Every day, 19,000 people are dying because of pollution worldwide." #AxeFiles
@schwarzenegger: Gerrymandering has empowered extremes in both parties by making general elections uncompetitive. “Politicians should never feel safe in their seats. It should be just like any other job that if you don't perform well, you are out." #AxeFiles now on @CNN
Had prickly exchange w/@schwarzenegger re #MeToo &amp; his past behavior: "So based on what we have learned I have to say that I stepped sometimes over the line. I feel bad about that b/c that was not intentional… one has to just say look if I made a mistake sorry about that."
Do we need to make America great AGAIN? @Schwarzenegger says despite its problems, America is "still by far the best country in the world. None of the things that I've accomplished I would have been able to accomplish if it wasn't for America" The #AxeFiles on @CNN
I asked @schwarzenegger to put on his political hat for a moment to talk midterms. His response? “I have to say to you that I'm very little interested in politics, because it sucks.... I'm more interested in policy.” The #AxeFiles now on @CNN
.@Schwarzenegger on why he spurned @realDonaldTrump in ‘16: “Trump asked me to support him in the campaign.  And I said to him I won't because of the environmental stance. ‘I said, ‘Endorsing you...would mean I turn my back on all of this work that we've done in California.’”
.@Schwarzenegger, on whether he saw @realdonaldtrump victory in ‘16 coming: “I felt that it could have the same dynamics as my campaign...that people wanted someone from the outside, people were sick &amp; tired of what was going on in Washington...” #AxeFiles now on @CNN
.@Schwarzenegger on @realdonaldtrump celeb persona: "Well, that's what made him win. You know, I think that people really bought in to the books that he has written, they bought in to the show, the Celebrity Apprentice, the character that he was." The #AxeFiles on @CNN

“In these times we have to unify, we have to come together.”	-@realDonaldTrump 	True enough.  But the irony of those words, amid the hale of incendiary rhetoric he has offered  on a daily basis, is truly stunning.
We don’t know who sent the bombs.  We do know this.	Words of incitement do incite.	Words of encouragement for acts of violence lead to more violence.	Words matter.	This is not a game.
Interesting that the NYPD anticipated the possibility CNN would be a target and proactively had explosive experts on site.	Speaks volumes about their theory of the motivation of the bomber of bombers.
What tone will @realDonaldTrump take tonight at his rally in Wisconsin, given the serial bombs that were delivered to several of his favorite verbal targets?

Was watching rally in Texas  last night where @realDonaldTrump gleefully teed up the crowd for a raucous round of “Lock her up!” It left me scurrying to the dictionary to look up the definition of “radical” and “mob,” just to make sure I wasn’t missing anything.
You really have to acknowledge how diabolically audacious the WH has been in service of midterms. Kicking up the caravan and transgender issues; picking a timely fight with Russia over nukes.  	The base will need a cholesterol check after this steady infusion of red meat.

It’s a crazy world when @BuffyWicks, one do the most impactful progressive warriors I have ever known, is attacked from the Left!  Anyone who worked for @BarackObama, for whom she played an essential role, admires her and knows what a passionate, effective advocate she is.
Total crock.  His administration went to court to END protections for people with pre-existing conditions.	But the fact that @realDonaldTrump is Tweeting on this tells you that the @GOP is paying a price for their determined effort to gut the ACA and scrap those protections.
So let me get this straight: the Saudis, who originally denied everything,  just acknowledged that Khashoggi was, indeed, killed during a “fist fight” in their embassy?	This is the cover story they came up with after 17 days!?!
Full time mayor and part-time podcaster Rahm Emanuel just had an interesting convo with historian @BeschlossDC.  Worth a listen. https://t.co/jpRkaMYE9h
If there were not a caravan of refugees headed here from Central America, @realDonaldTrump would have paid for one.  As he told us last week, he thinks it’s a “great issue” for Republicans headed into the midterms.
All true, but @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care.  He says these things because it plays in the room and with his base and causes media and elites to light their hair on fire, creating a sideshow he deems useful. As I’ve said: He’s Pavlov. We’re the dogs. https://t.co/xNEOrUNAoF
What are the odds that the Saudi probe of the Khashoggi case, on which we are apparently hanging our hat,  will implicate the country’s autocratic rulers?

“We are not here to lecture.  We are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship.”	-@realDonaldTrump in Riyadh in ‘17.	This was widely interpreted as a signal that human rights was no longer a U.S. priority.	That message was heard.
Jamal Khashoggi’s final column for the @washingtonpost is an eloquent testament  to the importance of a free press and its role in holding governments to account, the cause for which he apparently died.  	We, as Americans, should never take it for granted.	https://t.co/9ziSFfiqJR
I don’t know what dealings the Trump Organization has had w/the Saudis. But just the fact that this is being raised, in light of @POTUS ‘s tepid reaction to the Khashoggi murder, speaks to why past presidents have released tax returns &amp; divorced themselves from biz  conflicts.

Can’t believe @realDonaldTrump would want to subject Ivanka to a senate confirmation that would necessarily delve into the workings, finances and global relationships of the Trump Organization.
What appears clear:	@nikkihaley is positioning herself for the post-Trump world, whenever that arrives.
Given the politics of the moment, @realDonaldTrump no doubt reveled in the mutual praise he exchanged with the most prominent women in a Cabinet that has relatively few.	And now one fewer.
“They’ve agreed to denuclearization.”	But they haven’t acted on it.	Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump canceled joint exercises w/South Korea, gave Kim Jung Un a meeting on the global stage and showered the world’s worst  human rights abuser w/praise.	Kim knows the Art of the Deal.
And there you have it.  An endorsement for @realDonaldTrump.
No one can accuse @NikkiHaley of not throwing enough bouquets to @realDonaldTrump.  Should dampen the spirits of those who hope she might emerge as a challenger.
There will be a big debate about whether the U.S. is more “respected” in the world today, as @NikkiHaley just asserted.  A lot of evidence suggests otherwise.
I had a conversation on stage with @NikkiHaley last winter at @UChiPolitics.  What was most interesting was how she navigated questions about @realDonaldTrump, supporting him on some things and demurring on others.  Here it is:	https://t.co/vFLo6YwIvn

But I don’t recall her offering a speech on the senate floor, such as yesterday’s, decrying the blatant violation of norms and decorum in denying Garland a vote.  Was there one? https://t.co/prUS6MwuvX
I hope someone stands up on the senate floor today to ask @SenatorCollins about why she didn’t offer any stirring orations about decorum and fairness when @SenMajLdr refused to give Judge Garland so much as a hearing.
This strikes me as an extraordinarily unhelpful thing to say, from the standpoint of Dem candidates.	https://t.co/Hf0DhOOqjN
Truth is, @SenatorCollins had not given one indication throughout this nominating battle that she would vote against Kavanaugh.  Not one.
What about the dark money spending FOR the nomination?  She does herself and the country a disservice by denouncing the politicization of the nominating process while training her guns on one side.
Not hard to read where Collins is going.

Some time after Kavanaugh is installed on the high court this weekend, the FBI Director will be asked under oath exactly what instructions the White House gave the agency that led them to question just nine people.
Maybe the headline should have been, “I WAS An Independent, Impartial Judge.”	When you delivered the most partisan, scorched earth statement ever offered by a nominee for the court, you lost all claim to that.	You very deliberately went tribal to win.	https://t.co/FAJy3SQhvt

The @SenMajLdr promised the base to deliver the Kavanaugh nomination before the midterms just as he made good on his promise to deny Garland a hearing for nearly a year.  And you can bet he will, regardless of ANY intervening questions.	Cold, hard politics. 	Period. End of story.

RT @MittRomney: I support the decision to re-open the FBI background investigation into the allegations made by Dr. Ford. It is my earnest…
.@JeffFlake deserves credit for hearing the women who confronted him and slowing this train down by demanding the FBI review @GOP leaders have resisted.
The refusal to call the one person Dr. Ford says witnessed the alleged assault or submit him to a thorough interview is impossible to justify or explain.	It is a willful act of disregard that will stain the process and Judge Kavanaugh for all time.
Rs quickly realized they couldn’t go after Ford yesterday so they instead shifted focus to the tangential issue of who leaked her story rather than the story itself.  They went tribal to rally the base and hem in the handful of @GOP members who might dissent.
The handful of senators who have not declared their support for Kavanaugh could play a really constructive role by insisting on a full F.B.I. vetting of charges before voting.	It’s the right thing to do for the women involved, the country, the senate and, yes, Kavanaugh himself.
Yesterday, Senate supporters of Judge Kavanaugh held the @ABAesq as the gold standard because they rated him “highly qualified.” So will they now heed the ABA’s sensible call for a delay and an FBI investigation?
As predicted here. https://t.co/AdeXnfoebw
The “fair-minded fact finding” Cruz speaks of is undermined by the fact that the committee refuses to call the one person who Ford said witnessed the alleged assault.
Word I hear from friends on Hill is that @SenMajLdr and WH plan to forge ahead with a committee vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow and floor vote at noon on Saturday.
You can now see the purpose of Mitchell’s final round of questions of Ford, laying he groundwork for Kavanaugh to claim that he is the victim of “grotesque and coordinated character assassination.”
“Frenzy on Left to come up with something, anything” to derail nomination.  	Strategy is clear.  Rally the base.
The first question will be, why not ask Judge to testify?
Sorry. Corrected:	Ford was utterly riveting, credible and authentic.	The senators, less so.  Too much speechifying.
After failing to impeach Ford’s account, Mitchell turned to questions that seemed calculated to portray her as the dupe of craven Democrats trying to derail Kavanaugh.	But what about the main question?  What did he do and is he telling the truth now?
I guess the inference here is that the “vast left-wing conspiracy” paid for the lie detector test?
And many woman-and men-will remember the exchange in which Ford tearfully described Kavanaugh and Judge laughing during the alleged assault.
The profound problem for Kavanaugh is that many women, including senators, will see themselves in Christine Blasey Ford.
Let me revise my point.  It was the better of bad choices to bring Mitchell in to do the questioning.  But in many ways, she has unwittingly made Ford a MORE credible and sympathetic witness.
Is there something that I’m missing about why it matters that Ford came from her grandmother’s funeral to take a polygraph test?
Clever of @SenBlumenthal to quote @LindseyGrahamSC book on courage it takes for victims of sexual assault to step forward.
.@LindseyGrahamSC may need  a seatbelt by the end of the day.
Mitchell is velvet hammer, trying in dulcet tones to shake Ford’s testimony. 	So far, to no great success.
.@chuckGrassley reading prepared retorts prepared by his staff defending committee’s handling of the matter—including settling for a statement to Republican staff from Judge, who they refuse to expose to questioning from committee or FBI.
The issue for Kavanaugh is not just Ford’s detailed account of this assault but that he has thoroughly denied it and presumably will again this afternoon under oath.	Yet the committee refuses to call Mark Judge, who was named as a participant.
Kavanaugh will get his turn at bat but I think I already see Amy Coney Barrett warming up in the bullpen.
100 percent.
Mitchell strategy is clear: Impeach Ford’s memory.  Tough though.  She continues to seem credible and ingenuous.
That train may be in the process of derailing before our eyes. https://t.co/yQl1uMhhUM
On why she didn’t come forward earlier: “I was worried  that I would be jumping in front of a train that was headed where it was going anyway and I would be annihilated.”
I mean, we’ll see.  But that was devastating testimony.
The political wisdom of the @GOP hiring a female surrogate to do the questioning is now even more clear.  This woman is extremely credible and sympathetic.	Can you imagine those guys interrogating her?
This is painful.
“Spur of the moment gathering” would speak to why such a party would not turn up on Kavanaugh’s calendar.
.@ChuckGrassley says judiciary will “consider other issues at other times.” Meaning additional charges against Kavanaugh.	When? They’ve scheduled a vote on the nomination for tomorrow!
Interesting to note that Feinstein was elected in ‘92, a year when outrage over the  Anita Hill hearing helped spur the candidacies and election of a record number of women to Congress.
I wonder how people watching process @SenFeinstein recitation of Ford’s lofty academic credentials.  If she were a car mechanic or homemaker, would she be less worthy of respect or attention?
After pledging to make witnesses “comfortable,” @ChuckGrassley opens with a broadside against @SenFeinstein and Dems and undercuts Ford’s testimony before she speaks.  	Off to a great start.

The challenge for Dems on judiciary, who will ask their own questions, is to treat this hearing with the sobriety it deserves.  No small task on the eve of midterm elections and w/several prospective presidential candidates on the panel.
.@realDonaldTrump says all charges against Kavanaugh are “false”  and	 a “con job” but he’ll listen to the testimony.	It’s like a judge striking his gavel at the beginning of a trial and saying, “Not guilty.  You may proceed with the witnesses.”	https://t.co/5qrHt7Q4Dl
And if you lie about one thing, how credible are you about the rest?
Whatever happens from here, Kavanaugh has handled the last week horribly.  By painting himself as a choir boy, he looks like a liar in the face of mounting evidence that, at a minimum, he was a quite a drinker back in the day.
I agree.  	The politics were that the Ds wanted to force the eleven, mostly old white guys to reprise the role some of them played at the Anita Hill hearing.  Rs were desperate to avoid it.	But, substantively, nothing wrong with this. https://t.co/cNsSUYUFim

Why in the world would Senate judiciary not call the one person who allegedly witnessed the assault? 	And if Mark Judge would offer exculpatory testimony, why wouldn’t Kavanaugh and the WH want to hear from him?
RT @NickKristof: Remember that an American dies every 15 minutes from a gun—suicide, murder or accident. That’s because the US has slightly…
And if this were on the level, wouldn’t Judiciary call the man Ford contends witnessed and   participated in the assault?  Or are they concerned that Mark Judge would be asked to elaborate on the drunken high school escapades he wrote about and give credence to Ford’s version?
Does Kavanaugh have a motivation to lie?  And if the answer is an unequivocal “it never happened, why has he been cloistered in the WH all week preparing for Monday’s hearing?
What motivation would Ford have to lie and expose herself to all of this?  And isn’t it relevant that she reported this sexual assault to her therapist SIX YEARS AGO?
So in the matter of Ford v. Kavanaugh, it’s pretty simple:	Someone is telling the truth and someone is lying.
No one hoping more that Ford is a no show than the Senate @GOP.  If she comes and is compelling, or is manhandled by the all-male Republican committee cohort	 (See Anita Hill), the political costs of jamming Kavanaugh through will climb.
With our without Ford testimony, @SenMajLdr is as determined to jam this SCOTUS nomination thru as he was to slow walk and smother the nomination of Merrick Garland.

My guess is that Merrick Garland would find it a little irksome to hear Judiciary Chair @ChuckGrassley called for “proper respect and decorum” for Kavanaugh nomination.
Even by @realDonaldTrump standards, this one is stunning—essentially demanding political favoritism for indicted congressmen who are his supporters.	He is hurtling toward a wall, and not the one on the border. https://t.co/K3WOgyNq3L

To state the obvious, denying federal workers a pay raise because you’ve lavished a trillion dollars of tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy, creating massive new deficits, is beyond outrageous.

No one in public life believed more deeply or spoke more passionately about the ideals of America than @JohnMcCain. He championed the cause of human rights, spoke for those who yearn for freedom and democracy around the world and abhorred the despots and tyrants who oppress them.

Which couple seemed more in need of therapy this week:	@realDonaldTrump and Jeff Sessions or @RepDuncanHunter and the wife he publicly threw under the bus after their indictment?
All of these probes are closing in on @realDonaldTrump.  He views this as a break glass moment, and he’s not going to follow directives from his lawyers or his staff.  He’ll do whatever it takes to stop the investigative process.
This is what he means by a “loyal” AG.  Someone who will put the  interests of @realDonaldTrump before the rule of law.
Folks, the future is revealing itself in the @realDonaldTrump  twitter feed.  One way or another, he’ll remove Sessions, relieve Rosenstein of control of Russia-related matters and try to strangle the Mueller probe and other actions he views as existential crises. https://t.co/uaJ3WaaUYr

But it is interesting how readily @realDonaldTrump folks like Bannon are talking inpeachment.  They are counting on it as a turnout tool in November.

Two years ago almost to the day, Paul Manafort resigned as Trump campaign chair.  MIchael Flynn was flying high after leading “lock her up” chants at the RNC.  And Michael Cohen was a cheeky presence on cable TV, throwing punches for his client, “Mr. Trump.”	And now...
This will be remembered as the day when the swamp overflowed.	https://t.co/t6O1gL0AIv

“For all of the emphasis on Donald Trump’s attacks on the press, I think the longest lasting and most impactful shift in journalism is the decline of local news. There are whole swaths of the country that aren’t covered...That’s a crisis." @deanbaquet.  #AxeFiles on @CNN
“The public is saying they want news instantly. They're all walking around with mobile phones and we're providing alerts. So the pressure on us to get things right is far greater than it was before because there's less time to verify things.”  @PostBaron. #AxeFiles on @CNN.
Thanks to @realdonaldtrump, the term "alternative facts" is part of our vocab. @deanbaquet said its usage is "part of an organized effort to undermine the institutions that have a role in not only trying to understand the facts but also in questioning power" #AxeFiles now on @CNN
“We can disagree about how to solve problems. We can disagree about the analysis of the situation but there are underlying facts...It's not...who has the biggest megaphone. There are actual facts in this world. There are truths in this world.”@PostBaron. #AxeFiles on @CNN
In the wake of the awful news out of PA this week about the decades of abuse by priests, I asked @postbaron to take us back to the initial @BostonGlobe investigation. He said he asked his team "couldn't we get at the truth?" That is the essence of journalism. #AxeFiles
Journalism is a very powerful tool. The #HarveyWeinstein story, which "opened up a whole debate about powerful men and their abuses of women, I think was a story that would not have happened if it weren't for the @nytimes, the @newyorker," said @deanbaquet on the #AxeFiles
In admitting what the media missed in 2016, @deanbaquet says: "I don't think we quite had a handle on how much anger there was in the country after the financial collapse of 2008… how much of a desire there was for change. How upset people were with the elites." #AxeFiles
“For all the attacks on the press... by this president, it’s got to say something that our audiences have gotten larger.” @NYTimes editor @Deanbaquet. #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@PostBaron on safety of reporters: “Certainly during the campaign there were an extraordinary # of threats...great concern about the security of our people who were covering the campaign. And now, even during the administration, there are similar concerns.” #AxeFiles on @CNN
“The president has sent a message to despots abroad that you can disrespect the press… that’s one of the most concerning things about this administration.” -@deanbaquet on the #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@Deanbaquet on Trump’s attack on Omarosa: “When somebody calls a black woman a dog, my visceral reaction as a black man is to feel this...pain and anger...  So here’s where journalism comes in: He actually calls everybody a dog.” #AxeFiles on @CNN now

Hard to understand this argument that tossing @PressSec is somehow “doing something” that will help elect Democrats, defeat Trump or change policy.	It won’t. Whatever the intent, it was a total political gift to @POTUS.
I have said it was wrong to eject @PressSec from a VA restaurant.  Not good or even effective.	But unless &amp; until @POTUS stops regularly insulting opponents &amp; inciting his supporters, Sanders lacks standing when she lectures others about the need for civility, as she did today.

“No matter how much outrage I or others express, (@POTUS) is  not going to change his behavior.  He is who he is, he was elected this way, that’s what voters voted on and he’s behaving today how he did on the campaign.” ⁦@marcorubio⁩	 on #AxeFiles on @CNN TONIGHT at 7 EST. https://t.co/TRiQlrFBMr
Billionaire Tom Steyer wasted no time in converting the sound of crying, immigrant children into the latest ad for his vanity project/impeachment campaign.
Historical note: The last time @POTUS advised on Twitter that someone was “wasting their time” was last fall, when he advised his own SecState that he was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” https://t.co/pk9op7z72n
He has has his ugly narrative: @realDonaldTrump as the Thin Blue Line, standing athwart a deluge of savage, marauding  illegals who threaten your homes and families. It made him president and, he believes, will hold the House. 	It’s what this is all about https://t.co/pk9op7z72n
I did a joint appearance with Charles Krauthammer shortly before he took ill with the cancer that would claim his life, and while we found plenty to debate, I thoroughly enjoyed the exchange.  A palpably brilliant man.	RIP
I’m much less concerned about the message on the back of the First Lady’s jacket than the babies taken from their mothers’s arms.
What began as the “zero tolerance policy” has become a horrendous story about zero competence or compassion.
I hope Americans are as insistent on the return of the 2300 kids separated from their parents as they have been against the policy of separation itself!  	This is truly a human rights issue.

Why do I have the feeling that this is going to be an extra special presentation?😳 https://t.co/xJ0wCpEwZU
And yes, hats off also to the photographer, John Moore, who proved again how powerful photojournalism can be.
This little girl may never know it but her tears, as much as any single thing, helped encapsulate for the world the hideousness of the family separation policy. 	She, not you, was a hero of this story, Mr. @POTUS.  You and your admin were the authors of a callous policy. https://t.co/RHrcCZsdU6
Exciting that @Atul_Gawande, who has so brilliantly written about the challenges to our health care system, will now lead an effort to find better answers! https://t.co/S1mZNIOAan
It turns out the abuse of little kids really bothers people.
But assuming it is legit, it does belie what he and his Homeland Security Director have been telling us for weeks about his inability to act on his own authority.
This could be like those phony Trump products he arrayed on a table for reporters during the campaign.  Handsome display.  Suspect contents.
Wonder what’s actually in that doc he signed?
.@POTUS takes full credit for heroically addressing the egregious crisis his policy created.
Seems like a big deal.	https://t.co/CbvmpczI8N
It’s also possible that this is another feint, like the gun control session for the cameras where he chided others for fearing the NRA. A day later, he folded like a cheap suit.
Not clear what is being proposed here, but I said on @CNN last night that @POTUS would never relent unless it was forced upon him.	Perhaps the enormity of the public outcry finally penetrated the fortress under that thatched mane.	https://t.co/17wllBweqR
The Blue Hen thing is a Red Herring! 	@SteveSchmidtSES appreciates what the American project is and what it requires.  As RFK said, “The future is not a gift.  It’s an achievement.”  And Steve, our friend and worthy campaign adversary knows, knows the same is true of democracy. https://t.co/Z8PfQJaFdE

How many times have we said,: “This time, he’s gone too far.  THIS time, he’s going to HAVE to back down.”	He’s not, folks.  He won’t.
Two-thirds of Americans disapprove, but @POTUS plays base politics with base policy of separating kids from parents at border.	All about turnout in Nov.	58% of GOP voters approve.	27% of independents	5% of Democrats 	https://t.co/Dlz4vlQEQz
Seems like more than a few Dems are raising money off of this tragedy at the border, and I’m sure it’s effective because the Trump administration policy is sickening.  But raising money off of it seems a little crass.

I read it and, yes, it could be merely a restatement of Administration policy.  But since @FLOTUS called for both adherence to law and “heart,” and nothing in law requires the separation of children from their parents, I interpreted it as a critique of the policy.	But maybe not.

For those who missed my #AxeFiles with @SallyQYates on @CNN tonight, or would like to hear more of the conversation, the podcast is up!	https://t.co/cCIgIoLlsj https://t.co/JPTOeFHZtZ
You have to wonder why WH reporters even show up for off-the-record briefings if @POTUS is going to turn around and deny what his own staff is telling them.	https://t.co/j020pJi8Fy
Her boss thought organized crime “would be too rough and tumble for me, so put me in white collar, which actually I ended up loving. This kind of thing that wouldn’t happen now today.” @sallyqyates on her career as a young woman in criminal prosecutions. #AxeFiles on @CNN
“...so she was a secretary to my grandfather, and then to my father and his uncles. I’ve ve often thought she was smarter than all of them and so it must have driven her crazy to be the one... typing their thoughts rather than her own.” #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@SallyQYates on why her grandmother who studied law, never practiced:	“This is rural Georgia, you know, back in the day, 30’s, 40’s, 50’s...and nobody is hiring a ‘lady lawyer, as they were known then... (1/2)
“That to the extent that people can recognize that with help they can lead a happy healthy life.  And, you know, not getting that help is -- is such a loss.”  @sallyqyates speaks powerfully about removing the stigma around mental health. #AxeFiles on @CNN
“It breaks my heart to think that had he been able to get some help, he could very well be alive today and know my son and, you know, his grandchildren.”  @sallyqyates speaks movingly about her father’s suicide. #AxeFiles on @CNN
“I think most people recognize that the lock them all up and throw away the key mentality of the 80’s and early 90’s is not only not the most effective law enforcement, but it also just simply is unjust.” @sallyqyates on criminal justice reform. #AxeFiles on @CNN
.@SallyQYates on Comey book tour in midst of probe: “I don’t want to pass judgment on somebody else’s decision of how they’re going to operate.  It’s not -- it wouldn’t have been my choice, but he had to make his own decision.”   #AxeFiles on @CNN now
Can't quibble with you priorities.	#goCubsgo https://t.co/GMiEnt5tK9
Contrary to critique of @POTUS allies, the Mueller probe has moved at a “lightning pace,” says @SallyQYates. “For an investigation as complex as this to have already produced the number of charges and guilty pleas that it has is really remarkable. #AxeFiles on @CNN now
“I prosecuted Democrats and Republicans....Prosecutors all over the country prosecute folks on both sides of the aisle, even though they most likely have a political preference themselves.” @sallyqyates on #AxeFiles on @CNN now
“None of us should be hoping that the president conspired with the Russians to impact the election...What we should all hope for and expect and demand is that Bob Mueller have the time and opportunity...to get to the bottom of it.”  @SallyQYates, #AxeFiles on @CNN now
“I was with DOJ for 27 years and I can tell you that...investigations there are done based on the facts and the law and not based on politics.  And I’m confident that that will be the result of this investigation as well.” @SallyQYates, #AxeFiles on @CNN now

My point is that with all our flaws, it is appalling to liken  the U.S. to Putin’s Russia.  To do so it is accept his cold-blooded predicate that there are no values, just interests.
Of course we’ve had our own history, publicly revealed because we have a free press and congressional oversight.  To compare that to Putin’s Russia is to miss the big point. We are a functioning democracy. Putin’s Russia is a murderous and corrupt kleptocracy—not to be emulated.
I think I just heard @mschlapp cynically suggest, without evidence, that the U.S. is guilty of the same tactics as Russia in subverting elections around the world.	This recalls the @POTUS declaration, “You think our country is so innocent?”	Appalling then and now.
Watching Larry Kudlow’s frenetic use of hands on the Sunday shows recalled magician David Copperfield. 	And when @GStephanopoulos pressed him on @POTUS moves against @Amazon and @washingtonpost owner @JeffBezos, Kudlow looked like he wanted to make HIMSELF disappear!

The @POTUS comment also underscores his belief that the first loyalty of an FBI Director is to the president rather than his or her oath of office.	It gives Comey’s testimony about their private meetings even more weight.
But these serial misstatement of facts is one reason why @POTUS lawyers are urging him not to sit down with Mueller.
This latest, erroneous @POTUS anti-Mueller screed, amplified by Trump’s apparatchiks on Fox and Capital Hill, is part of an increasingly frantic campaign designed to muddy the waters and mitigate any damaging findings of the special counsel as “political.”

As I’ve said, I knew Ronny Jackson in the WH and I personally found him to be responsible and professional.  But he plainly was not qualified to run a huge, complex and challenged agency and it was ludicrous to nominate him for that job.
@RonDeanKy I think Comey believed Clinton would win and wanted to protect himself and the FBI against the charge that surely would have come from Rs in Congress that he had suppressed information to help her. Not justifying it, but I get why he did it.
That said, as a central player, Comey should have waited for Mueller to finish his work and omitted the more personal attacks about @POTUS he justifies as literary flourishes. My view is that the timing &amp; tone of his reemergence may be cathartic but they just aren’t helpful.
Sometimes you Tweet too soon.😳	Upon reflection and in fairness, I don’t think Comey was motivated by the pot of gold. I believe he wanted to share the lessons of his journey, explain his controversial, election-year decisions and call out the current threat to the rule of law. https://t.co/YoJHHDYOZ8
But then don’t turn the decision to write it into another wrenching morality play.
Comey says he hadn’t planned to write a book but felt it would be “cowardly” not to.	Maybe he’s going to give it all proceeds to rule of law groups, but it also seems like he’s going to make a bundle, which may be another reason he wrote it.	Nothing wrong with that, but...
Remarkable to see the tape of @realDonaldTrump flaying a @HillaryClinton aide for taking the 5th during the ‘16 race, equating it with guilt.	Now that his own “lawyer”/fixer has taken the 5th in the Stormy Daniels case, good bet Trump will have nothing to say.	#CohenofSilence

How is at that all this stuff about Pruitt’s past dealings never surfaced at his original confirmation hearings?
Turns out Little Rocket Man “has been very open and, I think, very honorable.”	Wasn’t it just a few months ago that @POTUS hosted the parents of Otto Warmbier at the State of the Union and railed against Kim’s savagery?	#whiplash
As @POTUS all but sinks his ship, one can only assume that Admiral Jackson must wonder why he ever set sail on this VA mission.
And by the way, it’s harder to strike a deal with North Korea-or any country-if the suspicion is that you may reneg at a later date, even if they abide by the terms of the deal!
Here’s hoping @EmmanuelMacron can succeed in persuading @POTUS to honor the Iran nuclear agreement.  To abandon it would be dangerously destabilizing and would isolate the U.S. from longtime allies who are committed to the deal.

I’ve questioned the timing of Comey’s rentry.  His moral angst can be maddening.  His personal jibes-hair; hands-were silly and unnecessarily personal.	Yet, as he showed last night, he’s also compelling and credible— far more than a @POTUS with a clear penchant for lying.
I very much admire @GStephanopoulos for pressing Comey repeatedly.  Comey received a prime time platform but he didn’t get a lay down in return.
I question the timing of Comey’s book, A Higher Loyalty, as a matter of the public interest, adding, as it does, to the circus at a critical time in the probe.	But I have no doubt about its brilliance when it comes to book sales.	Maybe he should have called it Higher Royalties?

I agree that this an @NBA problem. Commissioner, change the screwed up incentive structure and give everyone in the draft and equal chance, so that no fans have to watch the kind of spectacle we are witnessing in Chicago tonight.	#notanking

“I do think rich people should pay more taxes, I’m blessed to be one of them. But I learned my lesson, I never complain about taxes.”  -Charles Barkley changed his mind on taxes after basketball great Bill Russell chewed him out! #AxeFiles on @CNN now
Charles Barkley: “I think what Colin Kaepernick did was amazing.”  Thinks @realdonaldTrump called him an SOB in Alabama “because he knew that was his red meat.  He placed his audience very well.” #AxeFiles on @CNN now.
“I voted Democrat for 55 straight years.  And first of all, I want to make clear, I don’t think the Republicans are better. But I think we as black people have not held Democrats accountable for taking our votes for all these years,” Charles Barkley says on the #AxeFiles now
“I can deal with the criticism. I’ll always support the cops because we need them.  That being said, I don’t ever want any unarmed black man getting killed or abused or anything like that.” – Charles Barkley on critics of his views on police shootings #AxeFiles on @CNN now
“Anybody who said race relations aren’t better, they’re just idiotic. Racism does exit, always has, and unfortunately always will.  But for people to say things aren’t better… that’s just ridiculous.” Charles Barkley #AxeFiles on @CNN now
Charles Barkley on what he told his friends the night @BarackObama won: “‘It’s just you guys don’t understand.  I’m from the South, and the notion that there – in my lifetime – there’s a black president, I’m in shock.’  I mean, I just couldn’t believe it.” #AxeFiles @CNN now

Two outstanding Dem vets—media strategist Mike Donilon and pollster Tom Kiley—lent their considerable talents to @ConorLambPA and helped forge a remarkable win!
Little-noted was that @ConorLambPA closed his campaign with an ad in SUPPORT of strengthened gun background checks.
Drew Miller, the Libertarian, has more votes than Lamb’s margin. 	He may have been the difference in the race.
Hard thing to do but Saccone doesn’t look like a guy with much hope.
Recount lawyers, better sit by your phones.  You may be needed.
Big question: Did one campaign do a better job than the other on absentee ballots, which is an organizational test?
Loved it so much I said “race” twice. Oops
If you love politics, you HAVE to love this race PA-18 race tonight.
Allegheny numbers have narrowed a bit with half in. https://t.co/WWPcbwnmpw
Still a long way to go.  But @ConorLambPA is running up about 60 percent of the vote in suburban Allegheny.  @realDonaldTrump carried that same area by 4.
Only 14 percent in from Greene County, a tiny rural sliver of PA-18.  But it shows a relatively close race between the D, Lamb, and the R, Saccone, in an era @realDonaldTrump carried with 70% of the vote.	Interesting.
Bottom line:	It’s easy to spin a race.	It’s hard to stop a wave.
.@ConorLambPA has been a superb candidate who reflects his district well.  His team ran a nearly perfect campaign.	But there is something larger going on in the country.
Plus this race reflects a trend that we’ve seen nationally since @POTUS was elected: D performance in virtually every special and regular election has been disproportionately high. Ds have turned 37 legislative seats, many in districts Trump carried overwhelmingly.
And @POTUS played a big Trump card with steel tariffs tailor-made to influence the PA-18 race in steel country.
Outside @GOP groups outspent Dems by five-to-one.
However the PA-18 race turns out, here’s what @GOP &amp; @POTUS should be concerned about tonight:	The @GOP tried to nationalize the race by injecting Pelosi as a target &amp; bringing Trump in TWICE.  And yet they’ve struggled in a district Trump WON BY 20 POINTS less than two yrs ago

For those who missed my #AxeFiles show with Sen. @JeffFlake tonight on @CNN or want to hear more of the conversation, the podcast is up! https://t.co/UxikEICoVl https://t.co/31Jkuv2VSQ
.@JeffFlake has a photo in his office w/ @BarackObama: "The last night he was in the White House...he called just to say that he enjoyed working with me. I certainly said the same. He didn't have to do that. It was very nice." #AxeFiles on @CNN now
Sen. @JeffFlake won't rule out 2020 run: "I wouldn't swear it off," thinks @realDonaldTrump "will have a challenge from the Republican Party." Also sees an "independent challenge, particularly if the democrats insist on putting somebody up from the far left." #AxeFiles on @CNN
Was @SenateMajLdr right to block Garland vote in '16? "Republicans may say 'Hey, we pulled a fast one here. We got a conservative on the court.' I'm a big fan of Judge Gorsuch. I'm glad he is where he is. But what goes around comes around." @JeffFlake on #AxeFiles, @CNN now
. @JeffFlake on DACA: "This needs to be fixed. It needs to be fixed on a permanent basis. These kids should be put on a path to citizenship. That's the ultimate solution." But for now he sees a temporary, short-term fix as only viable path. #AxeFiles on @CNN now
.@JeffFlake on migrants with whom he worked on family ranch: "it's tough to look at people who came across illegally as a criminal class. They were just trying to make life better for themselves and in turn, they've made life better for all of us." #AxeFiles on @CNN now
.@JeffFlake on gun control bills he’s backing now: “I grew up in a rural area and I don’t want to make criminals out of those who sell a .22 caliber rifle to their friend or something like that.”… “But we can have restrictions, We do have restrictions.” #AxeFiles, on @CNN now.
Have the #Parkland kids changed the gun debate? “Yes, you bet they have.  They're articulate, and they're committed and they have access to social media and that really has changed the game. And so I hope that they keep at it.” @JeffFlake on #AxeFiles, on @CNN now!
.@JeffFlake “couldn't see agreeing with some @realDonaldTrump positions and condoning his behavior, if that was the price to win re-election. I simply wasn't willing to pay it.”
Sen. @JeffFlake says @realDonaldTrump “certainly has a fondness for authoritarians around the world…I just don’t understand. I think a lot of people have a hard time understanding. It is not very healthy in terms of our position in the world.” #AxeFiles on @CNN now.
.@JeffFlake on whether @realDonaldTrump is a conservative: “Being a conservative is not just being conservative on policy.  It’s being conservative in comportment and demeanor and manners.  And we have anything but that in The White House right now.”  #AxeFiles, on @CNN now.

It is right to focus on the common elements of these mass murders, including the mental state of the assailants. But until our leaders acknowledge that the ready availability of assault weapons and our porous background check system also are problems, their words fall flat.

I love this paragraph from the @chicagotribune:	“Cook County Circuit Judge Jessica Arong O’Brien was convicted Thursday of a $1.4 million federal mortgage fraud scheme and will LIKELY be forced to resign from the bench.”	Likely?😳
Really excited about the roster of distinguished new @UChiPolitics board members we announced today! Bright, talented leaders all, from various fields across the political spectrum. See for yourself!	https://t.co/9F3Y2OXTp0
All true.  He should never have been able to purchase guns. But how about the ready availability of assault weapons that, time and again, enable efficient killing on a massive scale?  Are you not strong enough, Mr. @POTUS, to take THAT on? https://t.co/tXUv5ReJYo
It has become so formulaic: 	1) A mass shooting.	2) Politicians say it’s “disrespectful” to raise questions about the ready availability of weapons of war while people are grieving.	3) Times passes.	4) Nothing happens.	And then we do it all over again.	#madness	#sickening
With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.
Not nearly enough, Mr. @POTUS.  Mass shootings and school shootings have become epidemic in our country.  Ignoring this makes these expressions of grief ring hollow. https://t.co/s6O0EuUYEK

The FBI Director almost certainly reports on sensitive matters involving WH Staff to the WH counsel.  Based on today’s testimony, WH was informed and re-informed on Porter.  Did Counsel report to COS? To @POTUS? Who knew what, when? Is anyone accountable?
If, as the Intel Chiefs testified unanimously today, the Russians are proceeding apace to disrupt our elections, how does the WH justify its continued refusal to impose congressionally-approved sanctions?

@neeratanden No, not because he is troubled by the allegations, Neera.  @POTUS comments and Tweet speak to that.  He thinks PORTER is the victim here!	But @POTUS can’t be happy about having this story blow up on him.  THAT is what could do Kelly in.
And the handling of this just this week has been a textbook case of how not to deal with a bad situation, which he-and @POTUS-made exponentially worse.
Hard to see how Kelly survives. Best case-though highly improbable-defense is that he didn’t know what he clearly should have.  Likely truth, based on the timeline: He knew and looked the other way.
Ultimately, if the @POTUS doesn’t value or recognize institutions, rules, norms, even laws, that “grab whatever you can, wherever you can” worldview corrupts everything around it.

Kelly tells reporters that he fired Porter 40 minutes after learning that the allegations were “true.”	A discovery he apparently neglected to share with @POTUS. https://t.co/bKx7X8HXgj
Is Congress going to explore the potential breach of security this Porter case poses and explore the unusually large number of WH employees operating with temporary security clearances?
The president’s modular morality unit,  the @VP, is “appalled” and assures us that  a WH that sat on the Porter file for months has a “zero tolerance” policy on sexual abuse.  Yet the @POTUS himself buoys the alleged assailant and offers not a word of solicitude for the victims. https://t.co/mK1ikvWvg0
Nobody stares better than the @VP.   	There’s this “I know you’re back there but I am not going to look at you” stare; the impassive look he gives reporters as he prepares not to answer their questions; and the loving, rapturous gaze he reserves for his wife and @POTUS. https://t.co/liEt8u5t8P

Lots of kind words from @POTUS in Oval abouthis departed aide Porter.  Not a word for the women.
Here’s what Porter story looks like from the outside:	A circling of the wagons around a well-liked and highly valued aide that caused WH to willfully ignore a very dark and deplorable history of domestic abuse.
Will the @VP pull that old chestnut and stage another stadium walk out at the Olympics?
Hard to imagine being these DACA kids, Americans in every way, who face exile to countries they have never known.  It would be beyond tragic for them and the country if @POTUS and the politicians in Washington don’t “get off their asses” and find a good faith solution.

Awkward juxtaposition: @POTUS refusal to execute tough sanctions on Russia passed by a NEARLY UNANIMOUS Congress last year, despite his CIA Director’s warning that Russians will meddle again in ‘18.	Could it be the elusive WH midterm strategy?😉 https://t.co/stg6MFUQ3v
Plus, @POTUS will be speaking to Congress, urging bipartisanship, the day after the WH announced a decision to give Russia a pass on the tough sanctions that Congress passed in a rare, nearly unanimous vote! #mixedmessages
I’m bewildered as to why the WH wanted a Russia probe memo and McCabe to be the lead story on the morning of the State of the Union?
And for this reason,  @POTUS won’t authorize it’s release until AFTER the SOTU.  If the speech goes well, it will be Thursday or Friday. If not, Wednesday. https://t.co/G1o91mtDZi
@POTUS The irony is that the purging was done in the name of fighting the politicization of the FBI. What it really reflects is a @POTUS who believes that these agencies should be loyal to him, first, before the country, constitution or rule of law.
The great irony of the purging McCabe by @POTUS and his minions is that they now have thoroughly politicized the FBI, neutered the director and called into question the agency’s independence in the future.

Or at least writing ads! https://t.co/y8Bq22Nzqa
So, Mr. @POTUS, we’ve gone in days from the “Bill of Love” to these despicable ads?	Or is this one more thing your staff did without you?	https://t.co/hmtc7lgkhr
@POTUS @GOP I’m sure @SpeakerRyan and @SenateMajLdr are still haunted by the budget deal @POTUS cut with “Chuck and Nancy” last fall, which is what has given the Ds the leverage they have now.
Why is @POTUS not in the thick of these negotiations now? Because after several sessions in which he appeared willing to make a deal, only to be reeled in by his staff and @GOP leaders, NEITHER side trusts him to handle this.
RT @DanaBashCNN: Wanna know what happened yesterday ? Why no deal to keep the government running ?Read our story  https://t.co/KmmTUYURLs
@GOP And yes, there were similar pronouncements by Dems in , when the @GOP shut down the government to try and repeal and replace Obamacare.	The difference here is that everyone knew that was a symbolic protest.  Here both sides CLAIM they want to solve the DACA mess before deadline.
Was it less “risky, reckless and wrong” when the @GOP shut down the government in 2013?  This is why people are cynical about politics. https://t.co/FQe66Ocrh5
Watching the sea of humanity descending on downtown Chicago today, it occurred to me that one undeniable achievement of @realDonaldTrump is that he has ignited a determined movement that is likely to be the political story of 2018. https://t.co/yrwxjemg3H
@GOP Answer: Base won’t allow it, though more than 80 percent plus of Americans believe Dreamers should be allowed to stay.
.@GOP party line this morning is “we all want to solve the DACA problem.  No need to shut down the government.”	So the obvious question is, ok, so why not just DO IT?!?

Guess I should have added #annoyingshutdownhashtags
I hope this debacle ends soon, and with it the annoying shutdown hashtag battle to assess blame.
And given the constant chaos that has reigned, perhaps a government shutdown IS a predictable coda on the first year of @realDonaldTrump.
Any other @POTUS with a relatively robust economy would be sitting in a much stronger position. But his behavior seems so imbedded even pathological-that it is hard to see anything changing.
His pettiness, divisiveness and abject ignorance about and disdain for democratic institutions and norms are truly historic and have been very destructive, to him and the country.
@realDonaldTrump Whether you agree with his policies or not-and I don’t—@POTUS can claim achievements-tax cuts; very conservative judges; radical deregulation; rout of ISIS; withdrawal from global agreements, as promised. Yet all of this is obscured by the constant turmoil he stirs around him.

Really what’s at stake in this immigration debate is whether good faith compromise is even possible in the Age of Trump.

The last part is important. Mueller probe will determine what did and didn’t happen relative to @POTUS.

It may be that @GOP slobbering over @POTUS is because he has a voracious appetite for flattery.  It may be a play to the party base. It also may be the realization that if he’s sitting at 35% in November, they’re in huge trouble, so they hope to pump up his numbers, not just him.

Come on, gang.

Pretending that’s not consequential is crazy. https://t.co/6kV8rZldav
You certainly can argue whether the things this @POTUS has done have been good or bad, or in between. (I have my thoughts.) But you can’t argue that they haven’t been consequential.
I think the last time @GOP members of Congress celebrated like this at the WH was  last spring when the House came to the Rose Garden to celebrate passage of a health care bill @POTUS later called “mean.”

This story may lift the spirits of the Right over @POTUS deal with "Chuck and Nancy." 	And disturb many others.	https://t.co/GXOunfg5dI
We all remember where we were 16 years ago at this moment.  Remembering those who lost their lives and the heroes who tried to save them.

Wonder how @SpeakerRyan and @SenMajLdr are feeling tonight about the Art of Deal?
Heard @SteveKingIA on @CNN this A.M. declare Trump base opposed to ANY DACA action. But @POTUS voters say otherwise. https://t.co/6SuSf1DDk5
Shouldn't we start naming these repeated Storms-of-the-Century after key climate change deniers?	Hurricane Donald.	Hurricane Scott...
How does this square w/what his AG said today, when he called DACA "unconstitutional?" MY head is spinning. Imagine being one of these kids? https://t.co/68FaKCHsGy
Leaders of Congress should put Dream Act on floor THIS WEEK. Why allow this to fester?
What a terrible legacy for @realDonaldTrump if Joe Arpaio gets a pardon while 800,000 young people, who have done no wrong, get the boot!
Now it is up to Congress to act with "a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel."-@BarackObama https://t.co/x1Kp9EdYJW
As the son of an immigrant; as a believer in America's founding principle of liberty and justice for all, I #StandWithDreamers!
Having urged @POTUS NOT to end DACA, will @SpeakerRyan now allow Dream Act to reach House floor, where it would pass w/bipartisan support?
So generous of @POTUS to allow the AG to take center stage to announce the hugely-fraught end of DACA.  Always willing to share spotlight!

What wise and eloquent advice from one president to another. Sad how thoroughly @POTUS has disregarded it! https://t.co/35QSADOxm2
Flummoxed by the Korea that is menacing the world, @POTUS inexplicably goes after the Korea that is our ally! 😳https://t.co/5yeDfh4yEU
Ok, Mr. @POTUS.  While you're working on empathy, how about regret-- for your baseless charge against @BarackObama? https://t.co/uZ6E0arywS

I can't say enough about Chicago's @chancetherapper, a brilliant young artist &amp; even better person. Just donated $2.2 m to 20 city schools.
We are getting a lesson, minute-by-minute, about why government matters. https://t.co/ZKv3DBkORe
As @POTUS assures Texans everything is going "very well," the EPA he's dismantling apparently is AWOL amid a looming environmental crisis. https://t.co/Ie9Rer3IEX
Weird message, though. People are "really happy" with what government is doing. And what about the storm scene? "A lot of water." https://t.co/iXiN2FjqHG
Where's the gratitude? Jeesh. https://t.co/ATy4u4VNyh
Don't know what is being said but these are strong pictures.  I'm sure it is of some comfort to these storm victims that @POTUS is there.
And what are YOU wearing, @GlennThrush? Is it disaster appropriate? America is eager to know! https://t.co/TO6Eais6rK
This is a great aspiration, Mr. Speaker.  It would be great if Rs and Ds would work together to help make it a reality. https://t.co/6WbcEFzvk3

To be clear, I SUPPORT aid when disaster strikes ANY of our communities. That's an essential role of government. Just noting hypocrisy. https://t.co/NCiNv9Gn04
If nothing else, Harvey has demonstrated that disasters are non-partisan.  Now its Texas Republicans arguing for massive relief spending.

Wouldn't it be more time efficient to put together a list of Democrats who AREN'T running for president?
I hope I am wrong.  	It would be a foolish and heartless move. The Dreamers didn't conspire to come here and are an asset to nation! https://t.co/MTgKfdji5W
Call me cynical, but if @POTUS were to cut or scale back DACA, the Friday before Labor Day, amid all the Harvey coverage, might be the time.
Thanks, @rickklein! @MayorLandrieu is a compelling guy. It was fun to chat with him. https://t.co/byfY9uw4H6

Wondering  if Harvey might cause @POTUS to rethink his proposed 9 percent CUT in FEMA funding?
The lasting memory of Harvey is going to be the amazing, heroic response of so many good people.  It is incredibly inspiring!!
Maybe @POTUS should dedicate proceeds from sales of USA cap he was stylin' in Texas to victims of the flood instead of his campaign fund. https://t.co/ZSMNAYPBjR
It's not always about you, Mr. @POTUS!	https://t.co/8htRShk01y
Nope. Ends without a word of concern or empathy from @POTUS for the many, many Americans who are trapped in a watery hell. https://t.co/5cDpECdzW0
So intent on claiming credit and giving out pats on back that @POTUS manages not ONE WORD about the dead and displaced! Maybe on 2d pass?
@TheFive @realDonaldTrump @jessebwatters How can a president who flagrantly disregards the law and creates so much disorder call himself a "law and order" president?
.@POTUS said, at 85, Arpaio shouldn't have to serve term in prison. So, instead, he may bid for 6 years in Senate. 	https://t.co/J0DA7SVSs5

James Buchanan-heretofore viewed as the worst president in U.S. history-must be watching today from the Great Beyond in hopeful expectation.

The Arpaio pardon is more aligned with the Tuesday scorched earth message, not the Monday and Wednesday love and brotherhood message.
Under cover of Hurricane Harvey, @POTUS pardons Arpaio, Gorka's gone &amp; word Trump may dump Strange for even stranger. 	Friday night lights!

In a thinly-veiled attempt to make the Trump WH look stable, IL Gov @BruceRauner cleaned out senior staff for the second time in five weeks.
