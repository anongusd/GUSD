Politicians in Washington don‚Äôt realize that the answers we need aren‚Äôt based on one party being right and the other party being wrong. Frankly, Arizonans don‚Äôt care whether there‚Äôs an R or a D next to your name, as long as you get the job done. #SinemaSoTD
The way forward has never been more clear. We desperately need leaders who will put country ahead of party, stop the fighting, and work together to find common ground. #SinemaSoTD
I want to hear directly from you how we can bring more jobs to our state, and then work together to make it happen. #SinemaSoTD

We reauthorized the Export-Import Bank to help Arizona companies compete on a level playing field abroad. #SinemaSoTD

There are solutions in the House &amp; Senate to create a long-term budget, fund our military, secure our border &amp; protect Dreamers. There is now a commitment from leadership to make this happen. DC politicians who stand in the way of solutions should step aside &amp; let us get to work.
This shutdown was unnecessary and shameful. This is not the way to govern. I am glad a deal was reached to get the government running and ensure economic security for military members, veterans, and Arizona families; however, our work is far from over. (1/2)
RT @j_hollmann: @RepSinema I‚Äôm with you! Work TOGETHER.
Enough of the name calling and finger pointing. We need both parties together in a room to hash out our difference and work together on a solution. I‚Äôm working with anyone, Republican or Democrat, who has serious ideas to fix this.
I‚Äôve met - and will continue to meet - with my Republican colleagues to find a way out of this shutdown mess.
No question about it - if members of Congress can‚Äôt do their job and pass a budget, they should NOT be paid. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fighting for the #NoBudgetNoPay Act. https://t.co/1erxT1SKWf
@JeanneLes93 Hi Jeanne, we're working to re-open the government as soon as possible. After previous shutdowns, federal employees have received backpay. If you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call our office. Thanks! -Staff

We have extended hours in our Phoenix and Washington, D.C. offices. Our team is here to answer questions and help Arizonans affected by the government shutdown. https://t.co/O9xFy51tev
It‚Äôs Congress‚Äô responsibility to pass a budget and keep the government running. Congress didn‚Äôt do its job and members don‚Äôt deserve to be paid. That‚Äôs why I cosponsored the Hold Congress Accountable Act. https://t.co/mrMhNA1EWz
Arizonans know if you don‚Äôt do you job, you don‚Äôt get paid. The same should be true for Congress. Our legislation stops pay for members of Congress during the shutdown and ensures military members and first responders continue to get paid on time. https://t.co/wFWlVK7lXh
The government is shut down but active duty military members are still showing to work up to protect our country. I introduced the Military Pay Protection Act to ensure they get their pay checks on time. https://t.co/rPH0qnemIt
Washington politicians who put political gain over American progress and the pursuit of the American dream should stop and look at what they‚Äôre doing to our country. Our challenges are too important for these games.
This shutdown didn‚Äôt have to happen, but congressional leaders refused to bring our serious solutions up for a vote. We have bipartisan solutions to keep the government open, fund our military, reauthorize KidsCare, take care of Dreamers, and protect our border.
.@USArmy chief of staff: "Failure to pass a budget, in my view, as both an American citizen and the chief of staff of the United States Army, constitutes professional malpractice. I don‚Äôt think we should accept it as the new normal." https://t.co/jBcPrypxU5
Military members and first responders should continue to get paid during a government shutdown. Congress should not. We cosponsored legislation to make sure that happens: https://t.co/aKun1JEXfc
RT @SenJohnMcCain: Under a #continuingresolution, the military will be locked into outdated &amp; inadequate funding levels, training, maintena‚Ä¶
.@DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis: ‚ÄúLong term CRs impact the readiness of our force and their equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our force.‚Äù https://t.co/eOrlTxgImu
Reasonable members of Congress want to move forward and prevent a shutdown. More than fifty of them have cosponsored our bipartisan bill that provides a solution for Dreamers and secures our border. The #USAact is a responsible path forward. https://t.co/fbxUI0MCtp
Congressional leaders are focused on partisan games, not hardworking Arizona families. Congress needs to get to work and pass a long-term, fiscally-responsible budget, not another short-term patch. This is not the way to govern. https://t.co/b3unZKhYda
Our #USAact has more than FIFTY cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. This bipartisan path forward protects Dreamers, protects our border, and prevents a government shutdown. Speaker Ryan, let's vote on this now. https://t.co/5f1Ym0Wx6Q
@secnav76 @USNavy @DeptofDefense @ChiefPentSpox Our troops sacrifice everything for our safety and security. Congress must work together NOW on a bipartisan, long-term solution.
@secnav76 @USNavy This hurts the entire @DeptofDefense. @ChiefPentSpox says that governing by #ContinuingResolution is ‚Äúwasteful and destructive‚Äù. https://t.co/1g3GQEEd7Z
@secnav76 @USNavy .@SecNav76 also said that the *most important step* we can take to restore the health of the @USNavy is to provide stable and adequate funding. That means a responsible, long-term budget, not another temporary measure or half-fix. https://t.co/1TVC2zGm90
At a hearing yesterday, @SecNav76 said the last nine continuing resolutions have cost the @USNavy $4 BILLION. That‚Äôs taxpayer money that should be going to our support our sailors, ‚Äúin a trashcan, with lighter fluid, burn it‚Äù. https://t.co/jtW8ohEC45
Continuing to rely on a #ContinuingResolution is a horrible deal for our military. Here‚Äôs why: (THREAD)
A vote on our #USAact would prevent a government shutdown, protect Dreamers, and keep our border secure. We have one day. It‚Äôs time to get it done. https://t.co/GROhIjWNBu
These partisan games are shameful. This is beneath us, and it is not who we are as Americans. Washington politicians should stop acting like children and sit down together to solve our problems. Instead, they‚Äôre simply lurching from crisis to crisis. That‚Äôs not governing. https://t.co/kEzjcUfQom
Arizonans are sick of DC‚Äôs dysfunction-Congress‚Äô temporary budgets &amp; half-fixes are ridiculous. AZ knows the truth: Washington is broken, it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. It‚Äôs time to find long-term bipartisan answers to our country‚Äôs challenges. We can‚Äôt keep governing by crisis.

Congress‚Äô failure to reauthorize #CHIP jeopardizes the healthcare of 22,000 low-income Arizona children. We MUST pass a long-term reauthorization of CHIP and ensure that Arizona kids get to keep their #KidsCare.

Mueller's investigation must continue unimpeded. It would help if those involved start telling the truth, but Mueller will find it anyway /5
There is more coming, and like most Americans, I'm concerned about what Special Counsel Mueller will find in his quest for the truth. 4/5
Intent matters. When someone says the Russian government wants to help defeat your opponent, you call the FBI. You don't go to the mtg. 3/5
What's most concerning to me here is the claim that, bc the Russia mtg didn't deliver on its promise, nothing is wrong. 2/5
It's illegal for foreign governments to interfere in US elections, and it's illegal for Americans to collude with them. 1/5
