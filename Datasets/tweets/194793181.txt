@panininef Having a robust Left Wing shifts the conversation back. A tax rate of 80% on the rich sounds politically impossible but 60% suddenly seems near-mainstream.
@panininef Conservatives talk about the Overton Window a lot but we don't. 		The Republican Party effectively moved the definition of "mainstream" from Reagan to Gingrich to the Tea Party to Trump.
@panininef Bernie wants to "be the change" and that's admirable. But chances are pretty good that, like in 2016, the Party likes his ideas more than him. He's an influencer, which is a role he can embrace or bitch about.
If we're socialists, they're fascists.

@idkbloodboy Fools!
Trump can do a lot of things, like granting clearances. He's not allowed to lie about it.
Obama had a great, not perfect record. Remember where we were when W. left office.
CPAC is the GOP fyre festival. Dems need a conference with Tom Hanks and Oprah.
If they're going to falsely accuse Democrats of wanting to murder children, what ridiculous thing should we accuse Republicans of?
Ironic that the @GOP is so worried about being treated like minorities even though they can't get a majority of the vote in an election and they're the ones that treat minorities like crap.
@neeratanden The Republican party has tremendous power but in a democratic republic, they are the minority.
@daveweigel This can only end two ways: the Mueller report drops and we riot (metaphorically) until Trump is gone, or he has an opportunity to steal another election.

And there's one clear answer: we must pressure the Congress to remove him. We must put so much pressure on *all* of them that they vote Yes. Or they know they're being cast out in their next election.
No, that's foolish. It's just the story of an idiot that inherited and squandered great wealth and sold himself to the Russian mafia state to stay rich and powerful.
If you believe there is nothing to this scandal, that it's all a hoax, are the judges and juries in on it? Is it a grand deep state conspiracy?
That's a condensed version of the bare minimum we know. And it's damning.
And Trump meeting with Putin and destroying the record of it every time.
Trump firing or threatening to fire everyone senior that was investigating him. Dangling pardons to buy silence. Lying to the American people and getting caught time and time again.
Trump and his entire staff having an obligation to disclose meetings with Russians, causing Sessions to recuse himself.
Trump going out of his way to praise Russia, Putin, and discount that they had anything to do with the election. Believing Russia over our intelligence agencies time and time again.
Flynn communicating with the Russians and lying about it, coaching their response to Obama expelling their diplomats, explicitly reassuring them that Trump's policy would be better towards Russia.
Kushner trying to set up a Russian backchannel that out intelligence wouldn't have access to and working with sanctioned banks.
Trump himself begging Russia to hack and praising wikileaks dozens of times.
Don Jr. Kushner and Manafort meeting with a Russian spy explicitly to gain damaging info about Hillary. Later lying about by saying it was about adoptions (!) which is blatantly code for sanctions.
Papadapolous trying to create a backchannel to Russia and finding out the Russians had hacked materials months before it was public knowledge. Then getting so drunk he spilled it to an Australian diplomat.
Carter Page being so blatantly pro-Russian that the FBI thought he was a spy. Even Page himself acknowledged that the Russians wanted him to work for them.
Manafort working for Russia and owing them a sh-t ton.
So what are the threads that tie the conspiracy together?
So, what was the quid pro quo?	For Trump, mega deal and election help. For Putin, sanctions relief, friendly US policy, undermining US democracy, and embarassing Obama and Clinton.
Putin probably expected the same but hoped for a Trump win. Owning a US President was beyond his wildest dreams.
Trump probably didn't think he'd win the presidency, but running would allow him to impress Putin and embarass/undermine Hillary, so it was still a win.
If Trump told Putin to f-ck off, it would destroy Trump financially. That puts the entire country into a perilous position: Putin owns an ultimate veto over our policies.
Trump has had a thirty year public love affair with Russia because they've been stroking his ego, buying his shit at inflated prices, forgiving his debt, and promising him a Trump tower mega deal for thirty years.		All of this is kompromat, pee tape or no...
The thing about the 2016 election is that it's so multifaceted. Let's sum up.

@mrowlitor This is a good take. 		He would have to win the nom, pick a mainstream Dem as his VP,  and spend months healing the inevitable rift.
@panininef That's my analysis. Always open to your thoughts.
@panininef Last thing is baggage. With him, I think that boils down to age, "socialism", and his loyalty to the party. He could ameliorate that baggage or he could make it much worse (forget his wife's name, praise Maduro, criticize the Dem party establishment in a meanspirited way).
@panininef His ability to raise $ and mobilize support is unquestioned.
@panininef Authenticity is no problem. He is who he says he is and he doesn't come off as programmed.
@panininef Trustworthiness is hard for me, too. I'd like to hear him formally join the party and pledge that he won't jump ship as soon as he wins the nomination.		I'd also like to hear him say (yes, again) that he opposes foreign influence and will fight the same (even if it benefits him).
@panininef The ability to deliver is hard to quantify with Bernie. My concern is that he'll push for bold solutions and refuse to take the half loaf.
@panininef Ideologically, Bernie is close enough to me that I could vote for him.
@panininef It's a tricky question because I like at least 4 of the options and I'm withholding final judgment until the debates start.		To me it boils down to 6 things: ideology, the ability to deliver, authenticity, trustworthiness, the ability to mobilize $ and support, and baggage.
@panininef Do I need from Bernie you mean?
@PhilippeReines If he wants to run, he can run. No kid gloves though.

Socialism is a bogeyman but think about where we were in 1880. Child labor. Pregnant women working. 18 hour days for pennies a day from the company store. No safety standards. Think about what went into the sausage. No, wait, don't.
Employees are trapped, unhappy and underpaid but so worried about $ that they can't start a business, go back to school, invest in their community.
A business owner is constantly worried about $. So they hire as cheaply as possible, doesn't build up his/her employees, doesn't invest in the community, pays as little in taxes as possible.

@breachmuscles @dianelyssa Which part sounds daunting? We can unpack it.
@dianelyssa @breachmuscles We need a solid year of vetting to determine who can raise money, organize, debate effectively, and justify the skeletons in their closets.		We should stay positive, stick to the issues, and try our best to embrace the voter's choice (even if we have to hold our noses).

The government should set general parameters. They have to. Beyond that the woman and her doctor should work together to make the toughest medical choices.
And as you talk through other murky scenarios where abortion might be the right choice, they hopefully reach a conclusion: this is really complicated.

@tomwatson If politics were aligned in the 30s the way they are today, he would have a bare majority. Every Southern and Midwestern Democrat would be a Republican.
@tomwatson And who was in FDR's Congress? Lots of Southern Democrats that wouldn't have passed "socialist" programs if they helped POC.		It is a great analogy. Obama had huge momentum but was cautious. His *progressive* power was further limited by several very conservative Dem senators.
@tomwatson The best analogy is the ACA. A compromise further weakened by additional compromises. But we are vastly better off than what Hoover (or McCain) would have signed.

@panininef I don't know which is true, truthfully. So I allow myself to imagine a scenario where she wins the nomination. Would I fight for her? Would I volunteer for her?
@panininef ...then I have to give her a pass to a wide degree. She got caught up in the moment, became convinced he was going down in flames either way, and felt obligated to show leadership.
@panininef I've thought long and hard about that one. If I assume that she did it for craven political reasons, knowing she was running, then f-k her. If I instead assume she cares about #metoo on a deeply personal level...

@Playfulimp @KenDilanianNBC But Trump doesn't seek plausible deniability. He demands everyone - including his children- one-up each other with good news or intel on how someone else is screwing up.		And literally every on staff was incredibly careless with emails, texts, etc.
@Playfulimp @KenDilanianNBC While unsatisfying, that's a case for impeachment in the Nixon-Clinton tradition
@Playfulimp @KenDilanianNBC Mueller could say "Trump wanted a deal with Russia and didn't want the public to know but we can't prove quid pro quo or his explicit knowledge of the efforts ofnearly his entire staff."
@Playfulimp @KenDilanianNBC At a minimum there is perjury in his written answers, obstruction in firing Comey, McCabe, Sessions, and aborted firings of Rosenstein and Mueller.		If he had any awareness of other crimes, add conspiracy.		The question is why? Why would he participate in these kind of crimes?
@IJefTomI @DavidJollyFL Trump won within the two party system. Yes, his platform and style were unconventional but the only way he coule win is constant support from the RNC.		Your choices continue to be: win as an R or D *or* abolish the Electoral College &amp; adopt something akin to IRV.
@IJefTomI @DavidJollyFL I appreciate the struggle of independents trying to fit in a two party system designed to exclude them.		But their only goal should be changing the system to make it fair, not spoiling the outcome just to make a point.

Trump needs to understand that achieving anything requires a grand bargain. Dems have too much power to steamroll them and the Dem base demands "resistance".		To make a deal, you have to make it very sweet.
We need an amendment that forces bills to the floor of each house if they have a significant number of co-sponsors.
The Dem ticket I fear most is Sanders-Gabbard.
We need the harshest possible sanctions on Russia until Putin and Trump are completely out of power.

Trump wants 5 billion in a slush fund to spend as he wishes. I say give him 20 billion and earmark the shit out of it, down to the penny.		Billions for security but not one penny for a monument to hate.
And for Democrats to compromise is an admission of one/more of the following: Trump has a mandate, a massive wall is the right solution, paying ourselves is fine, xenophobia is an acceptable card to play in American politics, voters endorse a monument to fear.
The problem is that Trump sold the idea of a massive border wall that we wouldn't have to pay for with explicitly racist arguments. It became a monument to xenophobia, not security. 		Because he lacks a political mandate and can't deliver on his core promise, he can only fail.

@panininef The question is can just about any Democrat do as well as Hillary in 2016 as a baseline. I'd say yes.		Then you have to ask who can outperform her in OH, PA, MI, WI, NC, and FL.
@panininef America is about 5% more Dem than Texas. Beto lost by 2.

@mrowlitor For the record I like and will enthusiastically vote for any female candidate running against Trump
@mrowlitor Gillibrand was very moderate early but has shifted.	Klobuchar is so interesting	https://t.co/tDGSyUctAf
I wish there was a moderate female candidate running for president. I think she'd do better than the current options.
@panininef Too early to pick a ticket you like?		In my case it struck me as Clinton-Gore 2.0 - young red state Democrats who are a fairly diverse team ideologically.
@panininef Which part irks you?
Fascinating how much psychology goes into the Mueller investigation. They create enough anxiety in Trump that he makes unforced errors BUT not so much that he flips out and shuts everything down too early.

@mattyglesias Republicans don't hate taxes. They just hate collecting them from the top 25% of taxpayers, proportional to the resources &amp; opportunities those citizens take.
End the current power structure and change the hearts of men and women.
We still need a bottom-up movement that emphasizes the equality of all humans. That tears down barriers. That works to identify biases and counter them.
Overturning 40+ years of Republican policy is where you start.		But a mistake of the "radical" left is believing that economic inequality drives all the problems.
People are secure enough to leave their jobs to start their own businesses. That competition is great for the economy.
That workforce is desirable...businesses compete for them. Quality and innovation increase.
The irony is that Republican policies are terrible for business in the long run. 		The engine of growth is a well educated, healthy, economically secure and physically secure workforce.
Republicans used to harp on the dangers of "class warfare". Not because they really believe that anyone can succeed. Because it's not a dividing line they can win with.		They would rather you identify with your color - regardless of income / economic security / opportunity.
It's like getting a special discount at McDonald's but you're still not able to afford the dollar menu. Or that's all you can afford.
It is simultaeously true that most white people benefit from systemic racism and they lag in economic security because of 40+ years of policies that disadvantage them in favor of the very wealthy.

@witliftin Very accurate. Bernie thought that:		1. The system was rigged.	2. Hillary would move left after seeing how powerful his coalition was or suffer the consequences.	3. Regardless Trump wouldn't win.
Beto can raise about 100 million more than John Delaney. But sure, let's complain that they're judged differently.

If a party wins 60%, the 6 most popular candidates from their slate are elected.
Let's say a state is allocated 10 representatives. The primaries should determine 10 candidates per party, ranked by the votes they get. The general election in the House should be a vote for the slate.
If a party gets 60% of the votes in a state, they should get 60% of the seats.

@VABVOX Pelosi has been speaker and we supported her then. To say "support my candidate or you're evil" is the same shit Republicans do.
@artist4ever "progressive" took the place of "liberal" as the label for center-left captialists about 30 years ago, when Republicans smeared liberalism and made it a dirty word.
@artist4ever I'm a liberal Democrat with a number of unconventional positions. Ultimately I believe government exists to protect human life and freedoms and combat existential threats to both like poverty and hatred.

@drjilliantweiss Thank you for voting blue!

Limit of 2 NFL preseason games and increase the regular season to 18 games.
The dev league would be 12 games from May - July with a one playoff game championship.
The development league should adopt exactly the same rules and employ the same refs.
Then the development league: Jacksonville, San Diego, Portland, St. Louis, Toronto, London, Mexico City, and San Antonio.		That amends for past sins and opens new markets.
Then I suppose you have to realign. 5 teams per division and 3 divisions per conference.
But I'm guessing the Jaguars would be the best choice.		So, eliminate the Chargers and Jags and conduct a contraction draft with their players.

Congress people should be limited to 12 years. Don't care if they were first elected at age 30 or 70.

The Democratic Party should advocate for free, fair, secure elections with automatic registration.		Then they should advocate for direct democracy.		If politicians want to pass an awful bill, put it on the ballot during a Presidential election year and let the people vote.
