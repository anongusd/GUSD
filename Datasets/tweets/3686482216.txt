Fixing Obamacare: Non-discrimination against pre-existing conditions, more competition, fighting high drug prices, flexibility in Medicaid.
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. AZ went up 116% last year alone. IL avg. 44%, #IL18 avg. over 50%
"I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1T investment in the infrastructure of the United States." -@POTUS

"But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy" @POTUS #taxreform #Jointsession
"We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists." @POTUS
"I have further ordered @DHSgov to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation."
