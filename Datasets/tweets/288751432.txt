We’re not the only ones who oppose POTUS’ #FakeNationalEmergency. 58 national security officials issued a statement today in opposition to the declaration, &amp; 23 former GOP Members sent an open letter urging support for @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution: https://t.co/Cdm6ycTX7F
And as a reminder, these Americans join many members of @realDonaldTrump’s own party who disagree with his decision to declare a national emergency. Take a look here: https://t.co/m1NDJeqqoC
There’s a chorus of voices growing… and not in @POTUS’ favor. 2 recent polls show the American people strongly disapprove of his decision to declare a national emergency at the border, which violates the Constitution and makes America less safe. https://t.co/EouPJUGbXq
This #ValentinesDay, we find ourselves asking: what is true love? We didn’t have to look far to find the answer. There's no purer example than the GOP’s love of fiscally irresponsible policies like the #GOPTaxScam that added $1.9T to the deficit for tax breaks for the wealthy. https://t.co/2iVit0rkQf
We found this #ValentinesDay card in the Capitol addressed to the 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions &amp; signed with love from the GOP.  Dems, on the other hand, are committed to fighting the GOP’s attacks on protections for those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/PtvcLRxUZz
This aged well. https://t.co/2hKjPaGYFK
This #ValentinesDay, find someone who looks at you the way @HouseGOP looks at eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/vlUqusqwEv
Not only are millions of Americans expected to receive smaller tax refunds because of the #GOPTaxScam, @NYTimes reported today that the #TrumpShutdown means that a “shocking” number of taxpayer calls &amp; letters have gone unanswered. https://t.co/qAnDC3YjN2
And for those keeping track, here’s a look at the broken promises from the #GOPTaxScam: it didn’t lead to massive job growth and wage increases, it didn’t make filing taxes easier, it didn’t pay for itself, and it’s leading to *lower* tax refunds for millions of Americans.
It’s tax filing season, and the American people are seeing the impact of the #GOPTaxScam in the form of smaller tax refunds: https://t.co/7p74xCDA8w
With @POTUS threatening another #TrumpShutdown, don’t miss this warning from an article in today’s @WSJ: “Economists say a fresh government shutdown would take a toll on U.S. economic growth as well as business and consumer sentiment…” https://t.co/UPta2Fx4xb
Remember when Republicans said the #GOPTaxScam would simplify the tax code? Turns out that was another broken promise. The @WSJ points out that the law has made the tax code a lot more complicated.		So much for that postcard...  https://t.co/gyP48mWQ5C
.@POTUS said he wanted to work together in his #SOTU address, yet took a partisan, hardline stance on issues. That’s not how bipartisanship works. The headlines show the address was more of a divisive campaign speech to appeal to his base than a SOTU. https://t.co/X6xoCgzD5e
Happy #GroundhogDay! Being stuck in a time loop &amp; living the same day over &amp; over is a funny movie idea—but it’s no laughing matter when it comes to another #TrumpShutdown. Let’s hope @realDonaldTrump considers the damage that would come from a repeat shutdown. #1ShutdownTooMany https://t.co/TiPnt2O6vF
Republicans said the #GOPTaxScam would spark a wave of biz investment that would create jobs &amp; raise wages. 		But a new survey found the law is enriching CEOs who invested in stock buybacks instead of investing in equipment, creating jobs or raising wages. https://t.co/YNaUV4QDMP
Here’s your shockingly out of touch Republican comment of the day (but it’s still early!). Perhaps this is why Republicans have yet to show any urgency to reopen the government?  https://t.co/xCWjIhhYWC https://t.co/krSZTeeP7c
It is Day 33 of the #TrumpShutdown &amp; the impact is growing. The shutdown is undermining law enforcement efforts, delaying tax refunds, cutting off revenue for small biz, and putting Americans at risk of being evicted, among other consequences. Read more: https://t.co/BOcofYm9AV
In poll after poll, the American people hold @POTUS responsible for the month-long  #TrumpShutdown, and a recent @WashingtonPost article points out even his supporters are blaming him and urging him to re-open the government now. https://t.co/MiWheSkAbz
The economic damage from the #TrumpShutdown is “inflicting far greater damage” than previously estimated, per @WhiteHouse’s own economists. @NYTimes explains the Council of Economic Advisers’ analysis shows how a prolonged shutdown could cause a recession. https://t.co/hETpIFHtSZ
Don’t miss this @Politico article highlighting the wide-reaching impacts of the #TrumpShutdown across the federal govt: inspections &amp; investigations halted; tax refunds delayed; furloughed judges mean the immigration courts backlog is worsening; &amp; more. https://t.co/pnfMNacIMu

ICYMI, there’s a growing number of Senate Republicans calling on its leadership to reopen government while border security negotiations continue. They join Sens. Collins, Gardner, &amp; Murkowski who want to see action to end the #TrumpShutdown now. https://t.co/gSyPsNfYet
A look at the headlines over the weekend shows pressure is mounting on Senate Republicans to take up the House-passed Republican bills to reopen government and end the #TrumpShutdown, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Take a look: https://t.co/fhp35TUIqi
In case anyone needed more evidence that building a wall or a fence isn't a smart use of taxpayers' money, look no further: https://t.co/YsdRRJ6FLR

Ahead of today’s vote on a resolution to intervene in the GOP lawsuit on the #ACA, we wanted to be sure you saw highlights from a recent poll from @ppppolls. @HouseGOP should probably take it into consideration when they head to the Floor today… https://t.co/OGItvrwzto
Today’s headlines show pressure is building on @SenateMajLdr to bring House-passed legislation to reopen govt to the Floor for a vote while discussions on border security continue. As the harmful impact of the shutdown grows, GOP Senators are speaking out: https://t.co/QSuhAeIlrr
Who’s going to tell @SenateMajLdr another GOP Senator is calling for an end to the #TrumpShutdown?		Sen.Murkowski is absolutely right — we can reopen govt while we negotiate border security — that’s exactly what House Dems are urging McConnell to do. https://t.co/TNyz4D5lzq https://t.co/sTjAHD0YA1
.@SenateMajLdr in 2014: “Remember me? I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns...It's a failed policy.”		If McConnell is the guy that gets us out of shutdowns, then he should put the House-passed bills on the Senate Floor to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/ISybn16XrX
.@realDonaldTrump calls this #TrumpShutdown a “total winner,” but a new @TheHill-HarrisX poll highlights how it’s quite the opposite and a strong majority of Americans want the President to compromise &amp; reopen govt. https://t.co/xYlYdHNkRz
Ahead of the @realDonaldTrump’s address, here’s a reminder of who the American people are holding responsible for #TrumpShutdown, courtesy of @CNN. 		Spoiler alert: It’s @POTUS. https://t.co/AGHOrVrLXL
In the “shocking to no one” category, Republicans are struggling to convince Members to vote against ensuring taxpayers get their refunds, families can receive nutrition assistance, families won't be evicted, &amp; Americans can enjoy national parks. https://t.co/S3wJUHtcpo
As we bring additional bills reopening government to the Floor this week, it will be very clear who is for opening up the government and who wants to continue this #TrumpShutdown.
In case there was *ANY* question as to who wants to reopen the government and who wants to hold the government hostage, look no further: Republicans, including @VP Pence, are actively whipping against legislation to reopen the government: https://t.co/2P7UjADNiD
“It’s our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government…”	 	We couldn’t agree more, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick. Let’s reopen the government and we can continue to negotiate on border security. https://t.co/aOOT8xN3Ss
Who is going to ask @SenateMajLdr when he leaves today’s meeting whether he is going to take up the bills we passed last night and reopen government or if he is going to keep federal workers furloughed/working without pay while @VP and senior Admin officials get $10,000 raises? https://t.co/9fBbJesjvN
The House passed Senate GOP legislation to reopen govt &amp; it’s on @SenateMajLdr to take it up &amp; pass it now. A look at the headlines shows the pressure is on the Senate GOP to act – which really shouldn’t be hard because they’ve passed these bills before! https://t.co/KBkHgTQlip
Before the White House meeting, we wanted to make sure you saw that in addition to the House GOP members who voted w Dems to reopen government last night, Senate GOP members want @SenateMajLdr to bring those bills to the Floor &amp; end the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/OQcPsoUIka
It’s day 6 of the #TrumpShutdown, and the impact of the shutdown is becoming more apparent. A look at the headlines shows that service members, civil servants, &amp; contractors – and the American people they serve – are feeling the negative impact:  https://t.co/Mc0CTAaRZ4
This morning, @realDonaldTrump is gearing up to shut down the government over his costly, ineffective border wall that he knows cannot pass the Senate. A look at the headlines shows blame for this is going to land exactly where it belongs: https://t.co/tLtHAU5RG5 #TrumpShutdown
Instead of voting on the Senate-passed CR to prevent a #TrumpShutdown, GOP leaders are putting their CR/border wall funding bill on the Floor. But here’s a look at some responsible Republicans who don’t agree w their leadership that we should shut down:  https://t.co/VsQJrxsyQt
As @HouseGOP prepares to bring another #TaxScam to the Floor this week that benefits special interests and not working families, the Trump Administration is backing off their promise of a tax cut for the middle class: https://t.co/ugmbjO4ExS
Two days ago, President Trump said he would “have [border wall funding] passed in two seconds” in the House. But a look at this morning’s headlines shows that @HouseGOP leaders don’t actually have the votes…  https://t.co/tUOXFtDnnv
While we continue to wait and see if @realDonaldTrump is going to take one of Democrats’ two compromise offers or shut down the government over his border wall, here’s a reminder for President Trump of how the American people feel about it: https://t.co/GmwSxrOPKM

Remember when the GOP claimed their tax law would create jobs? That’s clearly not the case. 		And after Americans rejected the #GOPTaxScam in the midterms, the GOP is trying to pass yet another tax bill that does nothing for the middle class. https://t.co/s8569kuM2W https://t.co/2cxhQFQHRR

*Note for our friends across the aisle: These are the same protections the Trump Administration is putting at risk by refusing to defend the #ACA in court. Not exactly a winning strategy.

How out of touch is the @HouseGOP? 		Millionaire GOP Rep Vern Buchanan is Chair of the @WaysandMeansGOP Subcommittee on Tax Policy.  		On the same day he voted for the #GOPTaxScam that cut his own taxes at the expense of the middle class, he also bought himself a pretty big boat. https://t.co/SSk6VPvejO
Why wasn’t the mistake caught before the bill was signed into law? Because Republicans jammed it through Congress with no hearings, no witnesses, and no time for anyone to fully understand what was in it.
Another day, another story about a glitch in the #GOPTaxScam. @WSJ walks through how the #GOPTaxScam inadvertently prevents restaurants &amp; other small businesses from taking a popular deduction, making it harder for them to make needed renovations. https://t.co/WvKCwSuQN4

Here’s what @USAToday said about stock buybacks: “…Buybacks don't have much direct impact on the economy. … growth won’t happen if much of the windfall goes into a form of financial engineering that does not do much to increase wages, hire workers or build facilities.”
THREAD: At the @FinancialCmte hearing, we’re seeing the GOP argue again that stock buybacks from the #GOPTaxScam benefit everyone. Friendly reminder that is not the case—stock buybacks &amp; dividends enrich investors, while leaving the middle class behind.  https://t.co/rQtcjexb4r
And they promised that the #GOPTaxScam would make America more competitive, but companies are using their tax benefits to reward investors through dividend increases &amp; share buybacks instead of growing their businesses or hiring workers. https://t.co/akVyWky0IA

For anyone who believes @SpeakerRyan is setting up votes to solve the #DACA crisis: keep dreaming. Taking up the Goodlatte bill &amp; a GOP “compromise bill” that no one expects to pass is a not real attempt to #protectDREAMers. This is a sham. https://t.co/W7eBf4hgLE
Today’s GOP QOTD is from @SenateMajLdr: 	 	“Everybody I know in the Senate... is in favor of maintaining coverage for pre-existing conditions.”	 	McConnell voted for #TrumpCare, which allowed insurers to deny coverage for 133M Americans w pre-ex conditions, so to that we say: https://t.co/zpLYOgaEdy

If he really wants to get something done, as he claims, what’s the alternative? How about the discharge petition, which is only three signatures away from 218 and allows votes on multiple bills (including any bill the Speaker wants!)?
He has:	1.Spent months promising a measure that can be signed into law (&amp; never presented one) 	2.Pushed the Goodlatte bill, but it can’t get 218 votes	3.Presented “4 pillars” that we know won’t pass the Senate &amp; will never be law (so that’s not a real effort)
For any Republican who still believes @SpeakerRyan when he asks them to keep waiting to take action because he is going to present a consensus #DACA bill that can pass both chambers and be sent to @POTUS, let’s review what’s really happening.  https://t.co/psECa4Cprz
Ever try this excuse?		"Our new deadline is not to have a deadline" –@SpeakerRyan 		Didn’t think so. They've had months to address #DACA &amp; @HouseGOP leaders still don't have a bill. It's exactly why we ought to keep moving forward w the discharge petition. https://t.co/R4qbSUq6FK

Glad he’s consistent. https://t.co/LsvyDleAsj https://t.co/TgQUjyJ9n0
This is what happens when you hold hearings AFTER you pass a sweeping change to the tax code: at today’s @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, one witness admitted corporations can utilize new loopholes &amp; save billions in profits, but small businesses are left behind https://t.co/fCfBUsKXa8
At @WaysandMeansGOP hearing on the #GOPTaxScam, Chairman Brady suggested Dems are cherry-picking data when Ranking Member Neal pointed out 83% of the benefits of the law are going to top 1% by 2027. So we looked at other years: https://t.co/Alceb8JPQi 		Spoiler: they’re all bad.
As @HouseGOP leaders leave their conference meeting &amp; @WaysandMeansGOP gets started on their *first* hearing on the #GOPTaxScam—almost a full 6 months after the bill was signed into law—here are a few questions for GOP leaders: https://t.co/bsntTV0aRe
Before @WaysAndMeansGOP tries to tell you their #GOPTaxScam pays for itself at today’s hearing – the 1st hearing on H.R. 1 – here is a @PostOpinions piece by former @USCBO Dir. Holtz-Eakin, who is testifying today on how the law will explode the deficit: https://t.co/s3aEQBRakb
It’s infrastructure week… But @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP have nothing to tout on infrastructure. No legislation, no hearings or Committee mark-ups, no action on the Floor. @CQ highlights just how little progress the Admin has made on a proposal: https://t.co/KC2gDN86kA
RT @WaysMeansCmte: Nearly six months since its signing, the Republican tax law has spurred layoffs, higher health care costs, ballooning de…
The non-partisan @ConcordC has some harsh criticism of the GOP’s rescissions package, a political gimmick which @USCBO confirmed would amount to $1 billion in savings after Republicans exploded the deficit by $1.8 trillion w their #GOPTaxScam. Read here: https://t.co/78jV8xyvYV
Finally, @POTUS’ ever-changing, ham-handed trade policies are leaving American farmers w/o a market for soybean exports. Dave Walton, who tends soybeans in IA, said: “We’re going to see friends and neighbors go out of business….we ourselves won’t be able to sustain it.'"
Withdrawing from the Iran deal will also have consequences, including higher gas prices and Boeing losing contracts worth as much as $20 billion. @PowerPost points out those jobs are expected to go to other countries now, specifically Russia.
.@PowerPost also highlights how General Motors is cutting a shift at a plant outside Youngstown, OH, which could cost 1,500 jobs.
Small business owners are struggling under White House policies that make it harder to hire guest workers. Eddie Devine, who voted for @POTUS &amp; owns Devine Creations Landscaping, said: “I feel like I’ve been tricked by the devil.”
Important @PowerPost read this morning on ways that @RealDonaldTrump’s policies are doing more harm than good for American workers and leaving the U.S. economy worse off:  https://t.co/gSZJP6v6Xz
We aren’t buying the claims that Republicans are making about the economy &amp; the #GOPTaxScam, and economists aren’t either: https://t.co/Ah5dQ9f7ci
No surprise here: Republicans chose to jam a partisan bill through the House instead of working with Dems &amp; are now scrambling for votes. A look at the headlines shows Republicans are facing yet another intraparty fight over their #FarmBill: https://t.co/W3EcHHSEH5
Guess what Republicans are going to get done this year?	 	*drumroll please*	 	Nothing. https://t.co/BtijhgowdE
After passing a tax bill that gives 83% of tax cuts to the wealthiest in America and adds $1.8 trillion to the deficit, it’s no wonder that Republicans are having a hard time selling the #GOPTaxScam… https://t.co/U2fJkekPFz
You would think it would be pink and red starbursts.		https://t.co/dq5cE9zZlZ
Remember when @POTUS said he wanted “insurance for everybody” that would be “less expensive &amp; much better?” He’s done just the opposite since taking office. His efforts to sabotage the #ACA have resulted in higher health costs &amp; fewer Americans w coverage. https://t.co/5eYkqb2w0U
Republicans could have worked w Dems on a bipartisan #FarmBill, but instead they are doing what they do best: fighting over an unpopular, controversial bill that no one likes. These headlines can’t be making @ConawayTX11 feel too confident about the bill: https://t.co/FfqAnBqY1E
Over the weekend, @PostOpinions had some harsh criticism for the GOP over how their efforts to sabotage the #ACA are leaving millions of Americans uninsured and raising health care costs for millions more. https://t.co/wzfZuVOqAx
Today's #QOTD comes from Chet Burrell, CEO @CareFirst_News, who had some choice words for @RealDonaldTrump &amp; Congressional GOP about their actions to sabotage the #ACA. 	 	“Did [the ACA] work? Did the people who needed the coverage get it? Hell, yes.” https://t.co/MRsOnUrpty
Today’s can’t miss headline: U.S. Lifts Debt Sales as Deficit Grows, Plans 2-Month Bills		Translation: Treasury admits the #GOPTaxScam = more debt. https://t.co/8yBDWi25ax
Remember when we pointed out that GOP attempts to sabotage the #ACA would result in higher costs for consumers &amp; millions of Americans kicked off coverage? @Axios walks through how GOP sabotage has left nearly 4 million more Americans w/o coverage: https://t.co/pIiEjvuGYW
This can’t be what Republicans we’re hoping for, but it comes as no surprise given that the #GOPTaxScam gives 83% of the benefits to the top 1% of Americans: https://t.co/k0lDQbbAs3 https://t.co/T3SjOB9FD5
After the GOP jammed #GOPTaxScam through Congress to prevent the public from understanding what’s in it, a @NASEtweets survey shows an majority of small biz owners still don't understand how the law will impact them &amp; feel unprepared for the new system: https://t.co/cr4ATogLoA
A report released yesterday by @JCTgov is further proof of what we’ve been saying all along: the #GOPTaxScam is a giveaway to the wealthy. @RealDonaldTrump’s deduction for owners of “pass through” businesses will give 44% of the tax break to the top 1%: https://t.co/X7eteULTYl

A NBC/WSJ poll released this afternoon shows Americans’ opinion of the #GOPTaxScam is only getting worse &amp; a plurality of Americans agree that exploding the deficit to give tax cuts to the wealthy isn’t a good idea. https://t.co/T6nLHjFjqg
ICYMI: A Tax Policy Forecast Survey from Miller &amp; Chevalier Chartered &amp; @NFTC on the #GOPTaxScam shows the majority of executives aren’t planning on hiring American workers or handing out raises &amp; benefits to their employees like the GOP promised. https://t.co/W2VyS4pSYR
Another day, another story about how the #GOPTaxScam is a windfall for wealthy. @USAtoday shows that while shareholders are receiving billions in dividends &amp; benefiting from record stock buybacks, few corporations have shared tax benefits with workers. https://t.co/ffJZ9aMXOV https://t.co/2hfoEpCSGn
Months after Republicans enacted #GOPTaxScam, where is the wage growth that they promised? The @WashingtonPost examines how the tax law – which Republicans touted as rocket fuel for the economy – has failed to yield wage increases for working Americans. https://t.co/geNZXnporW

Remember when @POTUS was going to “get rid of” the national debt?		Well, so much for that. 		The Treasury Department posted its largest budget deficit since the recession as revenue declined by 9%, thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/rD9UP8X3HV
*cue surprised face*		Today, the @USATODAY editorial board detailed how 70% of the windfall from the #GOPtaxscam is going to shareholders – not working Americans, despite what Republicans are saying. https://t.co/Zk97Rv5SqG https://t.co/rl9HVlVdiv

.@NYTOpinion highlights how the real winners under the #GOPtaxscam are corporate shareholders: “Republicans chose a plan that rewards the rich at the expense of workers.” https://t.co/nMMoYIlGkT

.@MickMulvaneyOMB told the @housebudgetGOP the military parade requested by @POTUS would cost taxpayers up to $30M. Here’s a look at how that money could be put to use in serious efforts to strengthen the safety &amp; well-being of the American people: https://t.co/qZEAbROKG6
After promising to balance the budget while on the campaign trail, @RealDonaldTrump is continuing his reign as #KingOfTheDebt. His ineffective, irrational, &amp; irresponsible #TrumpBudget will add trillions to the debt. https://t.co/hN4gaXZnI1
Today, @NYTimes reports that experts are warning that POTUS &amp; Congressional Republicans are pursuing “exactly the wrong fiscal policy at the wrong time.” https://t.co/zPvI2jvGAZ
You can’t make it up. After shutting down the government once, @RealDonaldTrump is ready to hold our government hostage to his extreme demands once again. Let there be no doubt that if the government shuts down for a second time, POTUS is to blame. https://t.co/vUlsvgyJvV
Republicans argue that Americans will see the impact of their #GOPtaxscam law this month. They’re right, but not for the reasons they would hope: https://t.co/zrsLSsADm5
A look at news reports today shows both @RealDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP are putting partisan politics ahead of our country’s national security and the principles of justice and the rule of law: https://t.co/uMi7bH7M0a
Editorial boards have some harsh criticism for Republicans today regarding their egregious efforts to undermine rule of law in order to protect the President. Take a look at this morning’s editorials:  https://t.co/qIJj82lQTE
.@SenJohnThune cautions @HouseGOP on the Nunes memo: 	1. GOP on the Senate Intel have not seen memo;	2. GOP &amp; @WhiteHouse should heed “grave concerns” of @FBI &amp; @TheJusticeDept; &amp;	3. GOP ought to release the Dems’ memo as well. https://t.co/iwl68PRWTq
Anyone who has doubts about whether House Republicans are using the Nunes Memo as a way to undermine the Russia investigation and protect the President ought to take a look at this report from @CNN -&gt; https://t.co/GgNghEVUCn

.@WhipHoyer is speaking with @MikeAllen of @Axios about President Trump’s #SOTU. Tune in to the livestream here: https://t.co/1AIkOMr37m Follow along for updates with #Axios360.
Remember when President Trump promised to be a dealmaker? Yet, in the midst of a shutdown, Mr. Art of the Deal is nowhere to be found. You can’t deny this is a #TrumpShutdown when the President – the person who is supposed to lead –  is MIA: https://t.co/3aTqwG9TSd
.@SpeakerRyan on @FaceTheNation said “…If you want to get these problems solved, open up the government.”		By that logic, why not bring @WhipHoyer’s bill to reopen the government to the Floor? We’ve asked 10 times.	https://t.co/9F3B68HPaL
Watch: @MarcShort45 admits @RealDonaldTrump isn’t doing anything to end the #TrumpShutdown. As long as POTUS isn’t working to end the shutdown he created, he will have to own the full measure of its consequences.  https://t.co/qnpGRifrjT
#TrumpShutdown https://t.co/wddD6p7Xfz
Pro-tip: when you need to reach a bipartisan agreement to fund the government maybe you should, you know, talk to Democrats. Just a wild idea. cc: @HouseGOP, @SenateGOP, @RealDonaldTrump	 https://t.co/E8FnXPGbPq
One thing we’re guessing Republicans didn’t think through before they shut down the government: the IRS won’t be able to implement the #GOPTaxScam that they wasted so much time on instead of funding the government. https://t.co/hOazhnwSgj
Here’s just one example of the impact of the #TrumpShutdown: during a deadly flu season, 8,5000 CDC employees will be furloughed. 	https://t.co/xRTfmlLAo5
Remember when @SpeakerRyan believed Congress has a “moral — and legal — obligation to propose and pass budgets?” Oh how times have changed. Take a look at the latest indication that the GOP is unable to meet their basic responsibilities of governing: https://t.co/ECkYRJxAli
Here’s the latest example of @RealDonaldTrump undermining American security. Yesterday @WhiteHouse called this a critical national security tool to keep us safe. Today, he’s against it. Which one is it? https://t.co/L9qqdOh7CQ https://t.co/A8V6OufYmA
Children’s health care advocates on the need for a bipartisan, long term reauthorization of CHIP: “the greatest threat to children’s health care coverage is congressional inaction.” https://t.co/eZr6n9CmQS
We agree that Republicans’ fate is tied to the #GOPTaxScam – and Americans will remember that they chose tax cuts for the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class. 	https://t.co/n1m1xCGYI6
@HouseGOP’s failure to enact a comprehensive, bipartisan reauthorization of #CHIP means states are running out of money right now, putting 9 million children’s coverage at risk. And where is the GOP? At the White House celebrating their #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/JLpzOQVuGf
We’re going to take a minute this morning to clear something up for Speaker Ryan who said “nobody knows” if the #GOPTaxScam will pay for itself.	 	It’s. 👏🏻Not. 👏🏻Even. 👏🏻Close.👏🏻 https://t.co/tNHqCWhMaF https://t.co/ug9YOsjIm5
You forgot to mention that you’ll have to send it back to @HouseGOP for a re-vote because you guys didn’t read the bill and it doesn’t comply with Senate rules… #Whoops https://t.co/8EENDUZUOi
Republicans RN after they didn’t take them time to read their #GOPTaxScam, realized it violates Senate rules, and now have to vote on it… again. https://t.co/zusgsxYwri
TFW Republicans pat themselves on the back for passing a #GOPTaxScam, only to find out the bill they rushed to pass violates Senate rules and will need to be voted on again. https://t.co/PtF8Ffa3UF
Disapproval of the #GOPTaxScam has grown by 10 points in just a month. Maybe that’s because the bill cuts taxes on the wealthy &amp; corporations while raising taxes on millions of middle class families &amp; exploding the deficit by $1.5T. But that’s just a guess https://t.co/oloJJJ2OJI
.@TaxPolicyCenter has released analysis of the #GOPTaxScam conference report &amp; here's what you need to know: 	-83% of the tax cuts go to the top 1%	-86 million middle-class households will see a tax ↑, which is more than half of America’s middle class https://t.co/BAp6TsLB9W
Despite what Republicans say about middle-class families benefiting from their tax bill, it’s clear that their legislation would result in a tax increase on middle-class households in order to pay for tax cuts for corporations. #GOPTaxScam	https://t.co/L1ej7RKpXl https://t.co/syrSvoMgEz
Is it just us or does the polling on the #GOPtaxscam keep getting worse and worse? @MonmouthPoll shows only 26% of Americans support the bill.  https://t.co/D4LoDlU7dY
It’s been a busy week but do not miss this @WashingtonPost article about @RealDonaldTrump’s campaign to discredit intelligence proving Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and the troubling impact on national security. https://t.co/Gi3xEqYad2
It sounds like the #GOPTaxScam whip count isn’t going according to plan. The @WashingtonPost reports both Senators Rubio &amp; Lee have major concerns w the conference report (which none of us have seen)—so much so that Rubio is threatening to vote against it: https://t.co/DYWtxWlPXd

The @USAToday Editorial Board had some cautionary words for the GOP today on the unpopular #GOPTaxScam that raises taxes on 78 million Americans, takes health care away from 13 million, &amp; adds $1.7 trillion to the national debt. Read here: https://t.co/528AYjkeED
Today’s @WashingtonPost examines how the GOP’s breakneck pace on the #GOPTaxScam means no one actually knows what’s in the bill and it will be full of surprises – and errors – when the conference report is filed. Take a look: https://t.co/6A7kxuXsB7
It takes some nerve to vote to add $1.7 trillion to the national debt and then turn around and say we really need to get a handle on the debt and the deficit. But that’s exactly what Speaker Ryan did yesterday: https://t.co/DQmoNfbVSr https://t.co/U9PnmXTbWX
The government shuts down in two days. While @RealDonaldTrump is pointing fingers, we’d like to remind him that Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House and are responsible for keeping government open. https://t.co/hraP3WkyOM
Who are the #GOPTaxScam Winners? Trump &amp; Friends. It’s another broken promise to the American people from @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/BAcmqlAatK
This is what happens when you don’t know what’s in your bill before you pass it in the middle of the night: the #GOPTaxScam bill is “riddled with bugs, loopholes, and other potential problems.” From @Politico: https://t.co/6kDz5Jm3K6
It seems Republicans have returned to the same, tired playbook we’ve seen before: rail against the deficit, pass a #GOPTaxScam that doesn’t yield economic growth &amp; adds trillions of dollars to the debt, &amp; then demand cuts to Medicare &amp; Social Security -&gt; https://t.co/NE0VmRLpne
The American people can see right through Republican rhetoric on the #GOPTaxScam. @WashingtonPost highlights how middle-class families are skeptical that the bill will help them: https://t.co/O7HMpdAegk
This is astounding. #ReadTheBill https://t.co/Gm9Klb3n5J
Someone should let the GOP – you know, the self-proclaimed party of business – know that 1,500 of America’s small businesses oppose their #GOPTaxScam. https://t.co/FH4ofXScp1 https://t.co/RF0zuES4Ko
Right now, @SenateGOP claims they have the votes to pass their #GOPTaxScam. There’s just one thing missing: they still do not have a bill. https://t.co/dvFq7NBji9
.@powerpost points out that maybe @SenateGOP wouldn’t find themselves in such a debacle today if they had followed regular order and pursued bipartisan tax reform: https://t.co/l50FzMhLB1
Republicans have a habit of making promises they can’t keep, and the #GOPTaxScam is no different. Here’s a look at how 4 of the promises they made about the proposal fall short. From @NBCNews: https://t.co/6d5nCPHOO9
You would think that Republicans would’ve learned after their failed #TrumpCare vote that rushing a bill to the Floor that their own party hasn’t reached agreement on isn’t going to work out well for them. But here we are. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/ohGzkn3g3N
As @SenateGOP leaders rush to rewrite their #GOPTaxScam, take a look at how the dysfunction and disarray are playing out in the news: https://t.co/EgUK3aAz7N
Dynamic score or not, the #GOPTaxScam will not yield the economic growth Republicans promised &amp; will still explode the deficit by over $1 trillion. @pgpfoundation &amp; @BudgetHawks have some thoughts: https://t.co/CoIU442oP0
The #GOPTaxScam is historic — historically unpopular. Not only is it less popular than other tax bills that blew holes in the deficit, but – get ready for this – it’s also less popular than tax INCREASES. Take a look here: https://t.co/3TIqpwZIpF
Senator McCain, 2001:	 	“But I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle class Americans who most need tax relief."	 	Senator McCain, 2017:	 	Whatevs.	 	#GOPTaxScam
.@stevenmnuchin1’s economic analysis showing the #GOPTaxScam will for itself doesn’t exist – because tax cuts don’t pay for themselves. And a former GOP Treasury Secretary agrees: https://t.co/k0AWivYlRf
What do CEOs and economists think of the GOP claims about the #GOPTaxScam? “They Are Bonkers” https://t.co/FbZYick70q
