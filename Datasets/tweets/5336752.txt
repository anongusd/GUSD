Anyway, @CoachHuggs, you‚Äôre a legend and one of the greatest coaches of all-time. Thank you ‚Äî and thank you, Twitter, for following me on his brief but wondrous tour of Bob Huggins fashion history. (1,024/1,024) https://t.co/nYZJrT2Mhz
This was an unfortunate speed bump, though. https://t.co/63WBAUU5kT
He‚Äôs taken some risks, to be sure. The gold suit was iconic. But too much for Morgantown. This isn‚Äôt Atlantic City. (please note the cuffs here) https://t.co/8cJ8ht49kh
You could go swimming in that thing. Look at it! Incredible. Just incredible. https://t.co/0cJjWki6Ou
When Huggins finally came home to West Virginia, it seemed like he truly felt at home in his wardrobe too. You get to a certain age and stature and you don‚Äôt really care anymore. But that‚Äôs when genius happens. Here‚Äôs where the short sleeve windbreaker becomes his signature look. https://t.co/pf0Cjafjms
Gonna re-up this pic because of the pants. Take a gander there. https://t.co/nJGmnn5FCC
After Huggins left Cincinnati (still hate you, Nancy Zimpher), things got a little weird for two years at Kansas State. It was like the third Strokes album. Didn‚Äôt make sense. Also purple is not a great color for Bob. https://t.co/awL5y1FCLD
Bob seemed to like the roomy feel of these tops and stopped wearing jackets. This is where the pullover and windbreaker looks start to emerge. Huggins was wearing a pullover, in fact, during one of his all-time greatest wins ‚Äî over Duke in the ‚Äò98 Great Alaska Shootout. https://t.co/egGnLerOnX
Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. He largely abandoned the dress shirt as Cincinnati emerged as a perennial top 25 contender in the mid to late 90s. We still saw a suit jacket, yes, but accompanied by turtlenecks and button up sweaters. https://t.co/64e71pAOAw
Huggins‚Äô legendary career at Cincinnati marked the beginning of his groundbreaking work in the fashion space. You‚Äôll see here he started out with the suits, even dabbling for a time with a boxy three-piece, again with wide lapels. Every detail finely tuned. https://t.co/CtwTdhMZLt
Huggins then coached at Akron (go Zips!) and opted for trimmer lines and a fairly conventional 80s flow. Cool vintage photo, but an unremarkable look. https://t.co/ThEjB5pLao
But his dramatic fashion journey began humbly. Here is Bob with some very wide lapels and a fantastic bowl cut in the early 80s, when he coached at Walsh College in Ohio. His first gig. https://t.co/mzGUunjPvD
Huggs appears to have settled into this look as his preferred offseason vibe. Here he is celebrating @vanexel31‚Äôs induction into the Cincinnati Bearcats Hall of Fame in September. I imagine he has 8-10 of these shirts in his closet at the moment. Look at the smile. https://t.co/eydWYTq9IP

also Dems are laughably under-utilizing digital in down-ballot races. Rs fixed that problem; dominated non-presidential digital spend in '16
is the D base fully with Northam? Looks like they're with Ed, despite close call with Corey Stewart
Virginia Rs outperform on E-day. Cuccinelli '13 &amp; Gillespie '14 should have been huge warning signs for 2016 about polls and "hidden" voters
