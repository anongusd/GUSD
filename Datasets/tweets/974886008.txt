In New Orleans in 1860, 3000 free blacks owned slaves. That was 28% of the free blacks in the city.  Only 4.8% of white southerners owned slaves and only 1.6% of whites nation wide. When blacks prospered, they were far more likely to participate in slave ownership that whites.
Why have we decided to forget what Europeans went through to  establish this country? Only 1.6% of people owned slaves and not all slave owners were white. Native Americans and blacks owned many slaves.  White people suffered &amp; died to build America too. Millions of them. https://t.co/DASdoSaQpR

we could use a lot more healthy shame in America right now.  No more apologizing for what was not done or meant. This is America and we are still free to say and do what we want within the laws of the land.
You can’t have it both ways. If you put yourself in the limelight, expect comments. It’s not body shaming, which is a bogus bullshit term made up by liberals anyway, it’s an observation. No one can make you feel ashamed. Shame is something you do to yourself and frankly,
If you don’t want something critiqued, then don’t put it all out there.  Everyone is a critic, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you don’t want someone commenting on your naked body, then leave your clothes on. If you don’t care then I don’t either. https://t.co/sGmEhwJLBn
