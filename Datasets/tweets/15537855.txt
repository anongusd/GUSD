@rickungar I'll send you a bill for the cold remedies.
@rickungar It's great all the players involved in this behaved like grownups, but that only works when the party who was "insulted" is willing to take the high road. Conservatives in these big media situations do this b/c they don't have much choice b/c the media is usually against them.
@rickungar First off, as a result of that cold you gave me in the studio, no vacation for me. Second, I'm not ignoring the moment here, but I also know that when we see a situation like Megyn Kelly, for example, there's a call for her head, even when she tearfully apologizes.

Through Specter's questioning Anita Hill admitted she was Sched A Attorney (a career civil servant) and was not going to lose her job just b/c Thomas (her boss) left the Dept. of Ed to EEOC  as she previously said. https://t.co/DAKwYzZfpQ https://t.co/trybAMXbrY
Anita Hill even said she followed then-Judge Thomas from the dept of ed to the EEOC b/c of rumors that Reagan was going to abolish the dept of ed. Even Dem Sen. Deconcini found that to be non-credible at the time. https://t.co/DAKwYzZfpQ
Sen. Specter didn't "destroy" Anita Hill. But through his questioning, she admitted she never had to follow then Judge Thomas to EEOC to keep a job like she prev. said and later met with Thomas after she departed EEOC at a speech he gave even tho she said she left EEOC bc of him.

Oh wow! Gohmert went there on the wife issue with Strzok!
Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) to Peter Strzok: "If I could give you a purple heart I would b/c you deserve one." / Oh barf.
Interesting that Strzok is saying that one of his texts happened as a result of hearing a Trump speech abt whether or he wld honor the U.S. commitment to NATO--The timing of this reveal after Trump's Brussel's trip is too rich.
Strzok previously testified that he couldn't testify about the Russia investigation when Gowdy was questioning him but now he is answering questions about the Russia investigation when Cummings is doing the questioning. How convenient.
This is going to be like this for the rest of the hearing - disruptions and delays from Democrats thru procedure and roll call votes.
My God, this hearing is falling apart over procedure.
Goodlatte is threatening contempt charge against Strzok if he doesn't answer questions
