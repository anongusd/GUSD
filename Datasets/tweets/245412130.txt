@LukeRussert @granthpaulsen @funnydanny @BrendanDarr Alas, the RG III era is snuffed out and Lamar Jackson is coming back in
@pkcapitol Remember that Trump has acted rationally so far despite his bluster
So if there’s a shutdown Trump is going to end up looking bad and lose to Pelosi. That’s a bad narrative. He has not shut the government down yet despite several opportunities. There may be a shutdown next year, but it’d probably fizzle out before long
Also keep in mind that a clean CR is the position of Schumer and Pelosi, who lost a shutdown battle with Trump last year over DACA but are poised to emerge as the winners in this round.
Remember, too, that Trump, for all his bluster, can only sign or veto what the system can produce. Legislating is a common denominator business and in this case the denominator is a (mostly) clean CR.
Also remember that Pelosi’s default solution is to just pass clean CR after clean CR and that next year’s high-water mark for wall funding is likely to be not much more than the $1.6B that the Senate has already proposed.
Key fact: The people who spark shutdowns always lose them. To be sure, Clinton, Obama, and Trump (so far) haven’t tried this approach. But Democrats don’t fear Trump, who is politically weakened, so they’ll never cave.
Keep in mind too that that recent shutdowns have NEVER worked. Clinton and Newt papered over their differences in ’96 with a huge assist from Bob Dole. The Obamacare defunders lost 5 years ago and Dems lost on DACA last year.
In that case, the House GOP lame ducks are sure to revolt. Why would Denham, Mia Love, Frelinghuysen, Lance, Culberson and company want to stick around to do Trump’s bidding? They lost or are leaving b/c of him and THEY WANT TO GO HOME
However, if Ryan wants to end his speakership with a spectacular blunder he can try to keep the House in Washington for a closer-to-Christmas shutdown with all the accompanying drama and attention.
This is fine with Pelosi, who will reclaim the speakership and immediately project strength against Trump. She would then have the easiest job of all. Pass clean CRs and lob them to McConnell.
With the news of George H.W. Bush’s death comes the development that there will be a short-term continuing resolution. This will be seized as an excuse to punt the showdown into January and into Pelosi’s lap.
Still, the roster of Washington politicians who really want a shutdown is quite short and it doesn’t include McConnell, who doesn’t have time for it, especially now. Ryan is checked out I am sure
First, most of the government, the Pentagon in particular, is already funded so the stakes are not as great. That may go ignored by the media. And as @JakeSherman has noted, recent shutdowns haven’t had enduring political costs https://t.co/XAmNCf1vuT
A few thoughts on the looming deadline to avoid a government shutdown. I’m finishing up a sabbatical so I don’t have the benefit of any reporting but that should not really be a problem in this case.
"At least" is the key element here. Looking at the calendar, Jan. 11 looks like as good a date as any. The lame ducks are demanding to go home and they're going to end up with a clean CR anyway so what's the point? https://t.co/PDNW82r4aY

Or House Republicans will quickly fold if the Senate holds a show vote, then strips out wall funding and sends back a clean CR https://t.co/7MEf8Hyk9y
Keep in mind that the overwhelming impulse of a lame duck member of Congress is to go home. There are a lot of GOP lame ducks, mostly b/c of Trump.		Paul Ryan is a lame duck, too.		It is going to be hard for Donald Trump to get a kubuki CR w/wall $$$ thru the House
@jonallendc The Schumer shut down was pretty predictable well as well.
@seungminkim @burgessev @SenJohnKennedy Trent Lott used to rush home to catch JAG.
@jonallendc This one is more predictable than most. Any political danger is far less because the Pentagon is funded. A full year continuing resolution is an acceptable outcome and a CR punting into next year seems the most likely short-term resolution
.@JakeSherman on Morning Joe:		"There's not a ton of evidence that shutdowns hurt politically."		Yup.
@brendanmdunn I'm aware. I also believe that majority leaders, regardless of party, have incentive to accommodate the minority in such cases, MM maybe more so than usual now. I also believe the norms of the Senate are under great stress and that KH would be willing to test them in this case.

@AJentleson @seungminkim I didn't mean to imply it would come to that but it is an ultimate backstop. The recent tradition of the Senate is to increase the size of committees to deal with these types of situations and there is plenty of incentive to work it out quietly.

@JakeSherman Same
And a little known fact about this upcoming rescissions package is that it probably is subject to a democratic filibuster in the Senate because it would cut mandatory spending. Under a decades old legal interpretation this is not given filibuster free privilege
So these CHIP cuts in the rescissions plan really aren’t cuts to CHIP but rather to the upcoming Labor-HHS bill since it takes them off the table to be offsets. The omnibus has $6.8B in CHIP cuts and Schumer and Pelosi were all for them then

Suspension of debt limit through Dec. 8 means actual default date could come in Feb/March if that's when extraordinary measures run out 1/2
@DaviSusan McHenry?
@JakeSherman Yes, but a spending cap deal is probably less likely w/o the debt limit. Mnuchin probably meant cost as "drawback" not "price"

@CaptainPAYGO Although it's difficult to revise demand upward
@MEPFuller I am and I would like your support....
@jonlachman I know. This is complicated enough, though, and EVERYONE is calling it a supp not a budget amendment
@PaulPage CR/omni/Supp
12/If you’ve made it this far, thank you, and now let’s go ask precise questions, instead of, “What’s going on with the CR?”
11/This is important because when McCain, for instance, opposes a CR, he’s usually talking about opposing funding the Pentagon by formula
10/This is confusing, I know, but full-year CRs allow lawmakers to act like they’re not voting for things like the IRS or funding Obamacare
8/BUT there is a likelihood that some of the 11 bills will become full-year CRs while some may pass as detailed legislation in the omni
7/....prevent a government shutdown when the current CR expires at midnight on April 28
6/CRs usually keep the gov't running for a few weeks or months to buy time for more talks or to recess Congress. A CR MAY be needed to ....
5/A CR is a “continuing resolution” that continues funding for agencies whose full-year approps bills haven’t passed. It is NOT an omnibus
4/The “supp” is Trump’s request for $30B more for the Pentagon and $3B for border security - including $1B to construct border fencing/walls
3/The omnibus is a full-year spending bill to wrap up the 11 (of 12) unfinished annual appropriations bills for FY 2017, which began 10/1
2/If you’re calling it a CR you are being inaccurate and contributing to confusion. Let’s focus on 3 concepts: Omnibus, supplemental, and CR
To members of the DC bubble. As we all starting covering/opining on the omnibus, we need to use the same terminology to avoid confusion 1/

Ran into a Democrat today who was sure Clinton's veep pick with be Kaine. "It's 3rd and 1, not 3rd and 9."
I would also note that by waiving the 3-day rule, tea party conservatives voted on the Obamacare cuts without knowing they were fake
(2/2) So cutting the spending "authority" for the exchanges produces no "outlays" or real savings.
The reason the Obamacare "cut" isn't really a cut is that the exchanges in the territories were not and won't ever be built (1/2)
Oh look, the $543 million "cut" to Obamacare in the Zika bill (for exchanges in the territories) isn't a cut at all https://t.co/qXinmuLucE

CBO score of applicable sections of House reconciliation bill: https://t.co/MgF76qhG1w
...neutering the mandate would have an effect on the score of the bill -- less savings, which raises a whole new set of problems		 -30-
The idea is that it there are no penalties for not complying with the mandate, you'll effectively nullify it. However....
...is to change the penalties for not complying with the mandates. That has been done before thru reconciliation when law was enacted.
....is merely incidental to the underlying purpose or effect of repeal. What the Rs may do, and it's not clear they'll succeed....
Even though repealing the mandates would have a big budgetary impact (due to less incentive to seek Ocare benefits) that repeal ...

Dear Twitter -- Is it OK if I check back in like an hour or two?
2 weeks after the Sen GOP budget was reported from cmte and a week after passage, you still can't get a copy of the committee report.

@AJentleson unless paired with nondefense money backed by Reid and Obama
So @scf (Senate Conservatives Fund) attacks Senate GOP budget for keeping Obamacare taxes. So does the @RepublicanStudy budget.
Lastly, Graham had circulated language to effectively turn off the point of order; got the stiff-arm from @SenToomey
@SenMarkey Is "Special Interests" the overall #1 seed?
Too be clear, Enzi's OCO point of order applies against future legislation, not the current budget resolution.
@jamespmanley I doubt it. Everyone's Jonesin' for reconciliation.
@jamespmanley It's kind of like Graham has his cake and Enzi eats it....
Budget Chair Enzi wrote the point of order. It would apply against any provision to add OCO money above $58B. They left it in on purpose
BTW, Lindsey Graham's vaunted $38 billion add for the Pentagon would remain subject to a point of order requiring 60 votes to waive

As it happened, the media was so excited to have something interesting to watch it forgot that is was getting screwed. Never again.
If Reid or McConnell conspire again to hide live vote tallies from the public, I assure you that the press will call them out
I, along with the rest of the media, was slow on the uptake as to why the secrecy on the key Sen debt limit vote was so wrong...
The next step, for both House and Senate, would be to provide real-time accounting of roll call votes.
.. occasionally provided for senators" is tone deaf and arrogant, even if it came from above.
I like Reid spokesman @AJentleson but his response that ongoing, public announcements of Sen votes are "a convenience ...
House's  2008 vote on TARP played out in real time as the mkts were open. So did today's vote. Public was denied info it deserved.
@loriamontgomery @StevenTDennis Yup. and they did, without thinking throught the consequences.
@loriamontgomery @StevenTDennis // I believe it was because GOPers din't wan to get the blame for spooking the market.
I expect a public statement from Senate leaders or their offices within an appropriate window.
I fully expect (and have already asked) that the organizations representing the media of Capitol Hill will lodge an official protest.
This cannot happen again and the media must demand a public statement from Senate leaders that it won't
But it is not acceptable for investors to be denied information available to lawmakers and their staff.
It's impossible to be sure how senators vote if they don't make a gesture. So the public, in this case Wall St. couldn't be sure.
Instead, the only people who could see what was going on were Senate insiders and reporters watching the vote live.
Typically, vote tallys are announced publicly in real time on C-Span. This one wasn't, seemingly at the request of Republicans.
It's late, but I want to say something about the way Senate leaders handled a key vote about the debt limit today...
