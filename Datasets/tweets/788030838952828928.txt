@TightR1 @daveweigel Shaking things up by making people sick. You said it. Also - that it still shitty politics.
@TightR1 @daveweigel He has no sense of HOW to get things done. This is why he's had a 2 month political crisis. It's politics.
@TightR1 @daveweigel Yup. And taking money from the poor and working class to give tax cuts to the top is poor policy and worse morals.

@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon if you are so upset by me, why do you keep coming back?
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon and I can see why you've been suspended.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon As I chuckle to myself. Remember, all I did was all you to defend your statement. You are the one who couldn't.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon I merely asked a question. Each of my responses is met by a few of yours. Who's triggered?
@iHATEfakes610 Thanks for the string of hilarious gifs, but in what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 Do you really not understand the difference between opinion and fact? Guess that explains some things.
@iHATEfakes610 Not an opinion- "u said that banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire" opinion- He's a dick. See the difference?
@iHATEfakes610 No. I don't care about your opinion. I care about how you decided to express it. By planting words in your opponents mouth.
@iHATEfakes610 I'm not angry. I'm just waiting for you to apologize for lying about your conversation. @GabrielAlon is owed an apology.
@iHATEfakes610 and that was not an opinion. It was a false claim of fact.
@iHATEfakes610 I'm just responding to you now. I asked a question and you attacked me for it because you were wrong. I don't back down.
@iHATEfakes610 it wasn't an opinion. Opinions are fine. It was a lie about someone else's statements.
@iHATEfakes610 You are wrong. You are a liar. You know that it's true. And I'm merely throwing a tiny bit of the shit you fling back at you.
@iHATEfakes610 I answered your question. Now answer mine or just admit you're an asshole and give up.
@iHATEfakes610 I don't like liars and I don't like trolls. You are both.
@iHATEfakes610 You are wrong. I provided evidence. You denied and provided no evidence. You lose.
@iHATEfakes610 And you are a worthless troll, but you won't back down and won't admit guilt, so here we are...
@iHATEfakes610 My question: In what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 No. You keep saying that because you can't answer the question because you are wrong. It's all in writing. Easy enough.
@iHATEfakes610 You are wrong. You lied. I'll keep going if you will.
@iHATEfakes610 You keep responding, just off topic to deflect.
@iHATEfakes610 See - evidence. Really simple.
@iHATEfakes610 https://t.co/e93sfyEN0Q
@iHATEfakes610 https://t.co/LuaGq3VM10
@iHATEfakes610 My question: In what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 And that is precisely your problem. You aren't even willing to defend your own claims.
@iHATEfakes610 I believe it was you who melted down and refuse to answer this one simple question.
@iHATEfakes610 My question: In what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 all because you know you're wrong and won't admit it.
@iHATEfakes610 My question: In what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 you claimed this. It's not true. All the evidence is in writing in front of us. Admit you lied.
@iHATEfakes610 My question: In what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 Q: in what tweet did he say banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire?
@iHATEfakes610 No, you have not answered it even once. If you had, I would go away.
@iHATEfakes610 My point again. You accuse him of making the claim that banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire. He didn't.
@iHATEfakes610 that's the original (and only relevant) argument in this thread
@iHATEfakes610 Again. You accuse him of making the claim that banks used fake numbers to make Trump a billionaire. He didn't make that claim
@iHATEfakes610 I did. You are still merely deflecting. What's wrong? Can't answer the question?
@iHATEfakes610 Nope. I'm on the topic this started with, as you can see from the screenshot of my first tweet. Next accusation?
@iHATEfakes610 two instances in which you make the totally unsupported accusation. Again. I'm still in topic.
@iHATEfakes610 https://t.co/ya2y4hescT
@iHATEfakes610 https://t.co/iRSLM9tKtI
@iHATEfakes610 No. Again standard troll. No topic jumping. You claim he said Trump conspired with the banks to fake his wealth.
Again. Spinning an argument is not winning. I did provide a screenshot of your claim.
@iHATEfakes610 You could give me a screenshot and prove me wrong, but you won't. You'll insult me and try to spin the argmnt again.
@iHATEfakes610 There is still one simple fact that you are choosing not to disprove. You lied.
@iHATEfakes610 Just because you can make an argument go on circles does not mean you are winning
@iHATEfakes610 No lies are when you intentionally make false statements, like "he said x" when you know that to be false.
@iHATEfakes610 And ill keep trolling you, because it's a little less time you have to troll someone else.
@iHATEfakes610 I looked at your brief timeline. You exist to be a dick, so I'll treat you like one.
@iHATEfakes610 See. You had a debate in which you lied. Upon reading it, this was obvious. I pointed that out.
@iHATEfakes610 So sad when a troll can't handle a pointless argument. That is the whole reason you exist.
@iHATEfakes610 YOU made this claim, I showed you made this claim. Support it silly troll.
@iHATEfakes610 You can merely point out where he claimed Trump conspired with the banks to fake his income or say that you are wrong.
@iHATEfakes610 Read the whole thing. Again, you say are not providing any argument to defend yourself. I am stuck in a lab and have all day.
@iHATEfakes610 Next play from the troll book - "I wasn't serious!"  You are a whiny snowflake. Buck up or stop trolling.
@iHATEfakes610 See. I supported my argument with your actual words. Still waiting for anything from you.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree That supposed insinuation is bullshit, but you run with it and it works
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree your too tweet claims insinuation, then denied. You continue to attack. https://t.co/IEucGcROdD
@iHATEfakes610 Standard plays from the troll playbook. Right down to the nonsense rebuttals.
@iHATEfakes610 Let's see: straw man, false equivalency, ad hominen attack... You are a regular logic manual.
@iHATEfakes610 Since you list the original argument so thoroughly, now you claim that it has been going on too long so you win.
@iHATEfakes610 You simply have to point me to a single tweet that says what you claim, but you can't.
@iHATEfakes610 can't handle being trolled then don't be a troll. You still have not pointed to where he said it. Prove your original point.
@iHATEfakes610 I tweet under my own name because I am not a troll who hides behind a fake name and lessons from junior debate club.
@iHATEfakes610 You are a troll. This is what you do. Don't like it, stop doing it to others.
@iHATEfakes610 Yes, he wrote the words "fake math". That in no way supports your argument.
@iHATEfakes610 You are a troll with 8 followers who went looking for a fight. I am not starting it, just tagging in.
@iHATEfakes610 I'm just watching someone act poorly and pointing it out.
@iHATEfakes610 Point to where he said it then.  You attacked him for saying something he didn't say. Defend that.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks It's never too late to have an opinion.
@iHATEfakes610 That's the best you can do, go after timing. You are a sad little troll who can't defend his position.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree For someone who hates snowflakes, you sure do melt quickly.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree You succeeded in getting him to defend your straw man. Now defend yourself
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree I like to stand up for those being unjustly attacked. You lied, I stood up
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks no he didn't. Again, you state he insinuated because HE DIDN'T SAY IT. Again - poor ethics.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree Good debating. Poor ethics.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree read the whole thing and yes, you got him to defend a point he never made.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree You did a good job of steering the argument though.
@iHATEfakes610 @GabrielAlon @PaschalSacks @lauravh610 @rkfatheree Actually, read it again - you accused him, but he never said it.

@anotheroldchick @jenilynn1001 @IngrahamAngle firing all holdovers would shut down the govt and cost billions. It's a stupid trope.

@ChrisRa37133004 it's like looking at the field only to determine crowd size in a stadium.
@ChrisRa37133004 the focus on the mall misses the fact (ha) that the women's march filled a MUCH larger area.
@ChrisRa37133004 streets around the mall were largely empty on the inauguration, but very crowded during the march.
@ChrisRa37133004 the crowd at the main march site (again NOT THE MALL) was dangerously dense.
Everyone is looking at the mall for women's march numbers. It was overflow for the main march and crowds spread 4 blocks on every direction

@marcladewig @farandwee @timothycsimons @DMurphine that's not an inference. Read your first post. If that's not what you meant, fine.
@marcladewig @farandwee @timothycsimons @DMurphine celebrity culture does not delegitimize opinion. Yes, people need to think critically.
@marcladewig @farandwee @timothycsimons @DMurphine I agree with that, but that's not where this started - celebrities aren't real citizens?
@marcladewig @farandwee @timothycsimons @DMurphine What poor reasoning? The kind that says successful people need to shut up?
@mizlisa19 @timothycsimons sorry. Too literal for my own good.

@marcladewig @timothycsimons @DMurphine just celebrities, or anyone at all?
@marcladewig @timothycsimons @DMurphine after you stated that the best commentary comes from citizens (not celebrities obviously implied)
@marcladewig @timothycsimons @DMurphine and your point is what? If an individual is part of a subgroup they lose their rights? We all are
@tartanbobmckay @timothycsimons in case you missed it, trump is only PEOTUS because of his celebrity status
@mizlisa19 @timothycsimons and those that were are not entitled to the same rights and freedoms as the rest of us?

@MariaPinam27 @JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro why do you fucking shitheads think now is any different than any other migration
@MariaPinam27 @JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro why are people from south of the border incapable of assimilating?
@MariaPinam27 @JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro yes they did fuckwad. And they were all discriminated against when they came.
@MariaPinam27 @JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro seriously. What the fuck is wrong with you? Irish need not apply? Sound familiar?

@JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro so an italian with a flag is ok, a Mexican with a flag is not. You are running in circles.
@JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro take a walk through an Italian neighborhood sometime. You'll see a few flags. Guess they should go.
@JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro but waiving a Mexican flag means they should go back to Mexico? Ever been to Boston?
@JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro no you made the point about them not learning out language. Poor dear can't think straight?
@JamesMack_NFL @NickJFuentes @benshapiro like those ones working 3 jobs any one of which would reduce you to tears?

@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn I believe your prior tweet was a lame attempt at deflection.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn so, based on that. Data with LA is no good and data without LA is no good? Why bother?
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn so you see the inclusion of LA county as delegitimizing the data, but exclusion was not your intent. Logical.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn no you said that the problem with the popular vote data is that it includes LA County. Explain the difference?
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn it's not the removal, it is your clearly partisan directed selective removal with unsupportable conclusions.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn there are ample analyses that show Trumps victory coming down to a handful of swing state counties. Ignore those?
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn but does necessarily indicate weakness of either candidate.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn I can drop a couple of counties and hand Texas to Hillary, that says something about her silos of support
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn there's a big difference between studying county level results and dropping the ones you don't like.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn from people who screamed about skewed polls, this is really rich.
@ThumpForTrump @Nate_Cohn removing select counties to produce a desired result is not a legitimate practice. Don't try to defend it.

@kimrnee @j3mike @RedState so yo summarize. You claim that picture proves for a fact that she was assaulted by her family. Sad. Blocked
@j3mike @kimrnee @RedState no, it doesn't. THAT is not conjecture. To then say she is about to be honor killed by her terrorist parents is.
@kimrnee @RedState now an unrelated story. I don't think you understand what conjecture is.
@kimrnee @RedState but you don't stop there and neither does the article, that is your problem.
@funnfoto @johnburton2003 @HildegardP @Chalkarts @NPRinskeep yes, then took it to the next level. The tools are soooo much better now.
@kimrnee @RedState now an ad hominem attack because you can't defend your point?
@kimrnee @RedState I'm not apologizing for anything or anyone. She lied - fact, her head is shaved - ok, the rest is conjecture
Guess the liberals were being sore losers. And the MSM was making things up. Hopefully Alex Jones will be let in to tell the tale. https://t.co/CGuCmolsn5
@kimrnee @RedState it is still just assumptions and innuendo. I think those photos prove she had lice. Care to argue?
@kimrnee @RedState perhaps you've never had a relative shield you from the media? Look like an assault. Not to me.
@kimrnee @RedState so that means the head shave is Muslim ritual? No, you don't know.
@RedState a lot of assumptions and implications in this story. How about some evidence?
@BreitbartNews like trump did with Obama?
@BrittPettibone @sxdoc oh, and you don't mention the fact that it is most likely a spoof IP, as this is the only evidence
@BrittPettibone @sxdoc my question is why their voter db also includes data about company incorporations within the state

@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer at protests. I'm not going to sit back and say, yeah sorry, I was rude.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I'm done with political correctness. The man who refused to ever accept Obama now cries foul
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I'm over educated and was under involved. Guess I was complacent. Like the Republicans say...
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer no attacking us never ok, but I'm also through pulling punches.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer and delegitimized any reputable sources.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer problem is a portion of our media, both L &amp; R is propaganda and both sides have attacked...
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer yes, and these kinds of leaders often do great damage.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer that's crap. I'm through being told that not accepting racism and xenophobia is closed minded
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I hope you are right, but the Political Scientist in me says there's a lot of damage to be done
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I never claimed I did and I'm no victim, but don't tell me there's no problem.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer these are not ideas. These are representatives we elected saying that some of us aren't people.
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I will debate policy forever and will watch with interest as different ideas are tried...
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer maybe you truly believe it can't happen here, but I'm not ready to take that chance...
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer so bad, and I hope you are right. But a Pandora's box is open and this is how shit happens..
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer this is Trump's America. It may be easy for you to sit back and say - chill, relax, it's not ..
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer since the election. My daughter watched a full grown man punch a middle schooler in the face...
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I have had one hate crime occur TO my family, one in front of my daughter and one to a friend..
@Viridian_Gamer @sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I stand with whoever is willing to stand with me.
@GulagVorkuta @ThePopulist_1 @AmazonVideo I have already had one member of my family assaulted, so just FUCK YOU.

@sweetdeesez @AndrewQuackson even the people that write that shit don't believe it. I truly pity you and your little bubble.
@sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I support your right to stand with anyone and their right to say anything. But I can still say you're wrong.
@sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer then take responsibility for it. Or if you do stand with the white supremacists. Then just fuck you.

@sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer I only stated that you can't stand shoulder to shoulder with neo nazis and say they have nothing to do with you
@sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer if you are not a Trump supporter then my comment doesn't apply to you. If you are, guess what? Team=metaphor
@sweetdeesez @AndrewQuackson ohhh. You're only into the truth so you rely on Joe the plumber for your "facts". I like the way you think.
@sweetdeesez @ThePopulist_1 @FormerlyFormer I never let them claim my support. I can't withdraw what I never gave. That is your job.
@sweetdeesez @ThePopulist_1 @FormerlyFormer I am not the one they purport to speak for. Do they speak for you?
@sweetdeesez @FormerlyFormer you're on the same team. They say they speak for the team. Say it is not true or you are a collaborator.
@FormerlyFormer @ThePopulist_1 @stranahan you didn't vote for/ endorse the devil. Ya fucktard.

@ThePopulist_1 we are all responsible for standing up for the opressed or suffering the consequences which WILL occur.
@ThePopulist_1 that is the definition of tacit collaboration. We get the whole president, not just the pieces we like. As Americans...
@ThePopulist_1 I don't care if you agree with my opinions. I welcome debate. I care if you agree with my right to exist.
@ThePopulist_1 I can't tell them not all Trump supporters agree because I wasn't a supporter. They think you agree. Are you ok with that?
@ThePopulist_1 continue to believe they have the support of Trump and his supporters?
@ThePopulist_1 no. Its simple neo nazis believe they got your support, were emboldened, now a nationwide problem. Do you allow them to ...
@ThePopulist_1 wow. So you won't condemn neo nazis. Happy Thanksgiving collaborator.
...allows this fiction to continue and tacitly supports those who benefit (White Nationalists)
It's simple. White nationalists are emboldened because the feel Trump supporters agree with them. Anyone who does not speak up ...

@mattyglesias @paulkrugman whatever the intent. Jumping to election stealing makes you sound like Trump. This is bad, don't make it worse.
@mattyglesias @paulkrugman claiming intent of Comey to swing election is just a little over the top.
@Klibanophoros44 "independent reports" doesn't cut it in court. Illicitly obtained documents without any chain of custody? No chance.
@Matty_Higgins @NoahGrayCNN @jaketapper @evanperez so you are saying there IS an FBI investigation into the POTUS?
@Matty_Higgins @NoahGrayCNN @jaketapper @evanperez so why did you refer to her as POTUS?
@Klibanophoros44 @NoahGrayCNN @evanperez they can't prove providence. Wiki leaks would be tossed out immediately.
@Matty_Higgins @NoahGrayCNN @jaketapper @evanperez she's not president yet, unless there's an investigation into Obama I didn't hear about.

@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 now I'm laughing my ass off. Jackass. Bet you think oversampling is rigging as well
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 can't handle that a news organization did actual reporting
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 hmmm? No answer. Can't handle that I responded?
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 never answer a direct question. Ah yes. I'm just a troll. Have a nice day.
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 just too lazy?  I tweeted it. Child.

@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 yup. LYAO until 11/9. Reality has a way of forcing itself on people.
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 what if Hillary has rigged Trump himself!?  You better go investigate.
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 yup, Hillary infiltrated the Trump organization so they would give rigged interviews.
@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 I did.

@DeplorablyYours @cbn2 @gmfkms04 no, but Bloomberg Business had a wonderful discussion with his team. Try again.

Just in case you were in doubt, Trump doesn't live in the reality he has created for his supporters. https://t.co/uWgwT02t0P

@REOSTREETGANG @Trompem @thehill problem with that is you end up with an Israel type situation. End up supporting from abroad.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 anybody with significant experience at high levels of government would not say "bruh".  I guess I did question it!?
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 if response time depends on entities deployed than saying "as little as 4 minutes" is meaningless
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 and I didn't question then. From the pages I have gotten to so far. Response time depends on entities deployed
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 and I have a wife, 2 kids, and 3 dogs. What exactly does that prove?
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 you are still a douche for making claims without providing evidence and whining when confronted.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 this debate is being waged by people far more qualified than you or I and the question is unresolved amongst experts
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 my problem was that you refused to provide evidence. I accept now that you have provided said information
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 now he's calling me names. I think maybe he needs a nap.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 just precious. So cute.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 no. Just tired of your lame attempt at gaslighting. Next time don't tell your mark to read page 19 of 8. It's just sad.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 long ago. Right... No longer worth the effort. I'm not bored enough to entertain you.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 mentally weak, out of my depth. Just perused the 8 pages of your citation and it says nothing to support your argument
@jbn566 @Real_JMOOB @elyse4design yeah, but he never quits, no matter how wrong he is.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 @elyse4design full recap: made a claim, provides no evidence, is proven wrong, denies defeat, acts pompous. Hmm familiar
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 @elyse4design yes it does, and she revealed nothing that hasn't been widely reported. Just quit already.
@Real_JMOOB @jbn566 @elyse4design @KimLaCapria did you actually read, or just skim for something to clip. You obviously MISSED THE POINT
@Real_JMOOB @elyse4design @jbn566 @KimLaCapria She didn't make a point. She asked a question.
