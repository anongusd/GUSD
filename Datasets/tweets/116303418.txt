@ainsleyearhardt Do not forget the families of first responders.. My son is a dedicated policeman and his wife checks his bullet prove vest every morning when she kisses him goodby and prays that he will come home safe to his family. Families serve everyday too.
FWATCH this video that sums up the #TXSen race between @tedcruz and @betoorourke. I #ChooseCruz because I want to defend #2A and our freedom. #ComeAndTakeIt
@RJNewsflash Wonderfully strong beautiful lady
@DineshDSouza And he is a Drunk Driver
@JRubinBlogger You to check your rhetoric
@BellamyYoung I was 5 years old when I was attacted and knew it was wrong immediately  and told my Mother and she delted with the SOB right away.  You should NEVER let anyone victimize you for one minute let alone 35 years.
Senator @tedcruz helped lead the fight to pass bipartisan emergency tax relief for those hit by Hurricane Harvey. @BetoORourke? So irresponsible he even voted against Harvey tax relief. Houston media called it ‚Äúcompletely ridiculous‚Äù. #ChooseCruz #TXSen
#IStand with @tedcruz for the veterans like Tim Lee who lost both his legs fighting in South Vietnam. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ Tweet #IStand if you're proud to stand, too! #TXSen

@angiehinds @lewiscarla2 @XENAtheBA @realDonaldTrump He signed them. That's the way government works
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS You are the fake cause you know nothing about me and I really don't care what think and your advice is useless
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS I knew you would say that. I have had my doctor for a long time and is very trusted and respected. She is honest with me and is not political like you so it no shock that you don't trust doctors it's pretty clear where you are coming from.
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS Doctors won't change from Obama care drugs. We're stuck with that thanks to the history of Obamacare no matter how current government trys to change it. That's what all the doctors are telling me
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS I'm not paid by anyone like you sound like you are. I have been an independent thinker all my life. I can only hope other people do the same
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS Obamas care doctors have been prescribing those generic drugs for years and we are supposed to be grateful Really????
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS Obamas doctors have been prescribing those generic drugs for years now and he says it's great for all of us n we should be grateful.  Really????
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS Who's paying you????
@LessaT @Bayer @joncoopertweets @BethAshworth5 @LibertyMutual @IngrahamAngle @sleepnumber @ATT @Allstate @esurance @RocketMortgage @Arbys @BayerUS Bayer is not the only one that make aspirin
