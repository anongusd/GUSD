Flanagan: While in office, what is the one thing you worked on in a bipartisan manner that we benefitted from? #SEdebate
Now the candidates get to ask a question of each other. This should be good.  #SEdebate
Flanagan says we need funding for roads and bridges, argues the Legislature voted on the issue to counter "representation" claim. #SEdebate

Golnik going for a more thematic approach. Talking about worries of people in the district. Quotes Charles de Gaulle. #SEDebate
Tsongas touches on laundry list of accomplishments and her goals for next term. #SEDebate
Debate is almost over. On to closing statements. Night started off slow, but really picked up at the end. Crowd was into it. #SEDebate

Golnik says we can raise revenues without raising taxes by stimulating the economy. #SEDebate
The candidates get to ask each other questions. Tsongas asks Golnik if it's irresponsible to pledge to never raise taxes. #SEDebate
Golnik sad his pledge to not raise taxes was not to Norquist, it was to the people of the district. Big applause. #SEDebate

Tsongas says Golnik will be "irrelevant" in Washington, DC, because he supported the Norquist Pledge to never raise taxes. #SEDebate

Springfield was dead post-convention. Found a Fifties Diner off MassPike exit. Drinking a chocolate milkshake at counter. #demcon2012
Warren gets 95.77 percent. DeFranco fails to make ballot. #demcon2012
Many delegates voted and bounced. Those still here are growing antsy. Impatient guy yells, “Results!” again. #demcon2012
Dems now awarding internships to students. Angry guy in audience shouts, “Give us the votes!” #demcon2012
Big topic: One year anniversary of Springfield tornadoes. Touching video (set to godawful Josh Groban song) is being shown now. #demcon2012
The feeling among delegates I spoke to is DeFranco won’t make it. She needs a strong showing in the North Shore/Boston-area. #demcon2012
Ballot results supposedly coming soon... more than 2 hours later than scheduled. #demcon2012
There are 3,554 delegates in the house, meaning DeFranco needs 533 votes to get on primary ballot. #demcon2012
DeFranco has picked up only a handful of votes from those two regions, well short of the 15 percent threshold she must meet. #demcon2012
Not looking good for DeFranco based on Lowell-area and Fitchburg-area votes. #demcon2012

"Beam me up, Scotty!" #randpaul #ronpaul #nhprimary http://t.co/u5y5IRHy
Paul finished speaking. Kept it short and sweet. Left the crowd wanting more. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Ron Paul now on stage. Crowd is going bananas. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Rand is slamming Rick Santorum. Paul campaign must worry he's eating into their support. #NHprimary #ronpaul
If Obama wins re-election, expect to see Rand back in New Hampshire in four years. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Rand Paul, Ron's son and US Sen. from KY, now on stage. Wearing aqua v-neck sweater and brown turtleneck. Snazzy. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Rock show atmosphere at Ron Paul rally. Standing only. People packed in tight. Real buzz in the room. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Ton of media at Ron Paul rally. Every voter here is going to be quoted in a newspaper article or on TV news tonight. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Wrapping up this week's primary coverage w/ Ron Paul rally in Nashua. Big crowd. Young. #NHprimary #ronpaul
Santorum not shying away from the God talk, despite being in New Hampshire. "We always need a Jesus candidate." #nhprimary #santorum
...still no questions (or mentions by Santorun) on jobs or the economy. #santorum #nhprimary
Another question about online piracy. This one from a Windham H.S. kid. #nhprimary #santorum
Santorum literally just talked about baseline budgeting for ten minutes. Audience now asking questions. Let's hope they spice things up.
Santorum delivering long-winded, wonky answers. Has barely touched on the economy or jobs. Seems like he's blowing chance to win over crowd.
Santorum Q&A very scripted. Questions are coming from handpiked people. Odd topics, too. Agenda 21? Internet piracy? #santorum # nhprimary
Crowd just recited Pledge of Allegiance. Guy next to me added, "born and unborn," to the end of it. #santorum #nhprimary
There are at least 550 people here, according to fire chief. Mostly an older crowd. Middle-aged to retired folks. #santorum # nhprimary
Voters say they're here to find out what Santorum is all about; didn't pay attention to him at all until Iowa. #santorum #nhprimary
Auditorium is packed. Unlike yesterday's Romney/McCain crowd, which was stacked with high school kids, these people look like real voters.
Want a pocket U.S. Constitution? They're giving 'em away for free at this Santorum event. #nhprimary #santorum
Santorum taking stage in about 30 mins. inside beautiful auditorium at Windham High School. About 100 people on hand. #santorum #nhprimary
Romney, Gingrich hit Granite State running - Lowell Sun Online http://t.co/sSF46ELa #nhprimary #romney
Woman who grew up in Tuscon asks McCain if he'll be Mitt's VP. McCain doesn't answer. #nhprimary #romney
Chinese American woman just chewed Romney out for insulting China. Romney: "I hope I haven't put any Asians down." #nhprimary #romney
Romney/Mac now taking questions. First Q from Occupy guy who wanted Mitt to say corporations are not people, but abusive people. #romney
McCain trying his hardest to pump up crowd, but this group is lifeless. #nhprimary #romney
Why... that's John McCain's music! Arizona senator and NH favorite joins Romney on stage. #romney #nhprimary
Romney's stage is set up like a boxing ring. Voters on all sides. There are even two stools. "Yo, Anne, I did it!" #nhprimary #romney
Mayor of Manchester: "Bo knows football. Bo knows baseball. And Mitt... Mitt knows New Hampshire." #nhprimary #romney
Holy crap! Now INXS's "New Sensation"?!? If Romney doesn't become president he could become a bangin' DJ. #nhprimary #romney
Uh oh... Romney's rocking some Hall & Oates... "You Make My Dreams Come True." The crowd is getting PUMPED. #nhprimary #romney
Proably 200 voters here. Not bad. Nowhere close to the massive Obama/Hillary crowds from four years ago, though. #nhprimary #romney
Now we've got Motown/soul stuff going on, "higher and higher." Now that "you ain't seen nothing yet" song. I should know this. #romney
More country music at Romney event. Some song where a guy sings "Only in America" in the chorus. #nhprimary #romney
I know it's been said before, but it really is amazing how much Romney's logo looks like the Aquafresh toothpaste logo. #nhprimary #romney
Santorum did well in Iowa partly due a positive, upbeat campaign. Will GOP rivals do same in NH? Newt only attacked Obama today. #nhprimary
Some national TV news figures here. I'm sitting next to Chuck Todd and Gwen Ifill. #nhprimary
Idea: State with the highest turnout in prior presidential elction should get first in the nation primary. Reward democracy. #nhprimary
At Manchester High School gym for Mitt Romney event. Grander setting than Newt. First time I've described a H.S. gym as "grand." #nhprimary
...Newt disagreed. Said founding fathers would have dealt with drug users violently. #nhprimary
Newt has fielded 3 questions about drug legalization. One guy said Jefferson and Washington would have let people grow marjuana. #nhprimary
Newt wraps up speech w/o mentioning opponents. Speech focused on founding fathers and how liberals don't like US history. #nhprimary
Newt refused to say Mitt's name during last night's speech. I'm setting the line for this speech at 4.5 "Mitts." Over or under? #nhprimary
...and cue the country-western music. Shouldn't Newt be playing some Godsmack or Aerosmith? #nhprimary
Gingrich event now standing room only. Campaign workers are passing out campaign signs: NEWT2012: Rebuilding the America we love. #nhprimary
Gingrich event in cramped conference room at Holiday Inn in Concord, N.H. Nearly as many media members as voters. #nhprimary
Can Romney stop Santorum's momentum? Is Newt out to destroy Mitt at any cost? Can Huntsman pull a Santorum? Time to find out. #NHprimary
Heading to Concord Wednesday morning to cover Newt. Then driving to Manchester for a Romney event. See you there! #nhprimary

Huntsman: I'm not running as an independent.

Huntsman: Congressman Ron Paul is not electable at the end of the day. Let's be real about it.
Huntsman: Iowa will be forgotten about the next day. New Hampshire matters.
Huntsman: Winning the GOP primary starts in New Hampshire.
Huntsman: We will see the end of the American century by 2050 if we don't get our act together.

Huntsman's wife says he's a great guy behind closed doors, when the cameras aren't around.
Huntsman enters with wife. He's being introduced by a veteran.
Lots of people saying it's between Huntsman and Romney. If Huntsman is gaining traction they'll pick him. If not, then Romney.
