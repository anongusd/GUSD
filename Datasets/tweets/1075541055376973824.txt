@justicedems Most Americans have health care (check the metrics for yourself). The failure of @BarackObama care is 28 million never received it, plus many of those who had it couldn’t keep their doctor and paid a higher premium because of this centralized control of health care. Cut the BS !

@AOC @MylesMill That’s adorable. But the “man” you refer to is in Federal custody. Has no access to bail or freedom. So it’s a non-issue now. But, anything to stay relevant, right! 🙄😷 Here’s a weekend project for you. You should open a district office so voters in CD-14 can address concerns. https://t.co/kYQLB1MBtq
@atrupar @PeteHegseth @AOC ...but you’ve capped salaries at $80k. House ethics and leg branch will weigh in on that soon. You can do those things temporarily, especially when you don’t open any CD-14 district offices &amp; @RepAOC constituents aren’t being served. So, it’s easy to play politics then lead. 😉
@AOC What you aren’t talking about is that you have no district offices open or staffed in CD-14 which means there are no office costs &amp; constituents can’t speak to their member at home Cutting your staff to 18 &amp; not opening offices allows you to make cheap political points #GNDFyre🔥 https://t.co/a9YiJRs8qQ
