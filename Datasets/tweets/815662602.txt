@Surabees @POTUS was wise to not appoint .@MittRomney to a cabinet post.  If he had, Romney would be undermining him at every turn.  Mitt will now join Chuck Schumer as one of the biggest obstructionists to all good proposals in the Senate.   #BuildTheWall
@pahubb43 .@MittRomney IS a snake. 	If @POTUS had given him a cabinet position he'd be using the position to undermine @realDonaldTrump at every turn. 	He's jealous that Trump is President &amp; he's not.  His resentment leaks out everywhere!  He is replacing John McCain as Trump's arch enemy.
