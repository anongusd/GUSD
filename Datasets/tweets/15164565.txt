Leaving Neverland brings a Michael Jackson reckoning to the forefront. The artist likely won't disappear from our cultural imagination. Which means we'll continue to reckon with how to think about him, and our own moral instincts, for a long time to come. https://t.co/7fays0zGQT
This isn't the first time an MJ documentary shook the world, writes @SamuelAAdams. (Remember 2003's Living With Michael Jackson?) But Leaving Neverland focuses on his alleged victims—to get a clearer look at what he did, by stepping back from who he was. https://t.co/QFJyCAnAT8
Another of Leaving Neverland's major oversights? It ignores race, writes @jasonkingsays. The film offers up a racial spectacle—two white men accusing a black man—and then neglects to grapple with its historical dimensions. https://t.co/ncM93sXqEz
But the film also does a disservice to the subjects at the center of the film. Robson and Safechuck are almost certainly telling the truth, writes @c_cauterucci, but Leaving Neverland denies them the opportunity to dismantle doubts about their stories. https://t.co/TiRRZE9nRL
Leaving Neverland is a rare portrait of sexual abuse recovery. It took decades for the subjects to come to terms with what they say MJ did to them. Witnessing that recovery could change how we think about the aftermath of sexual assault, writes @inkookang. https://t.co/dvXFY9F3IL
Michael Jackson's legacy shouldn't even survive Leaving Neverland. And yet, writes @carlzoilus, it probably will. In an age of reckoning and moral outrage, it may be too late for the world to cancel MJ. https://t.co/7fays0zGQT
It's hard to watch Leaving Neverland without concluding that MJ molested children, writes @jack_hamilton. And it will be equally difficult to separate his obsession with children from his work. It's in his songs, his videos, even his philanthropy. https://t.co/VV1VhkUrGS
Leaving Neverland premieres this Sunday on HBO.

7/7 Each day, WHAT NEXT, hosted by @marysdesk, helps you contextualize the news and gives you insight into stories like this.  		Check out other episodes of the show via @ApplePodcasts, or wherever you listen. 🎧 https://t.co/NhLl4HOcPK https://t.co/nqur9xjdzo
6/ On the whole, @henrygrabar says the state didn’t do its due diligence in trying to get this project off the ground.		Now, a lot of Republicans point to California and say this is why the #GreenNewDeal can’t work. But there may be some problems with that theory. Listen. 🔊 https://t.co/qCILhOzXiA
5/ Last week, Gov. @GavinNewsom declared that much of this project was dead.		There are a few reasons for this, one being that after California voters approved a ballot measure for the high-speed rail, Congress and the Obama Administration pressured the state to move on this. https://t.co/vEyBZ38RF0
4/ California was going to try to solve their nightmarish transportation problems with high-speed rail. Back in 2008, Congress gave the state money for the project as part of the stimulus package. 		Listen to @henrygrabar quickly explain in less than 30 seconds. 🔊 https://t.co/aoq8KxxHu8
3/ Ok, so back to the story. It’s important to know that transportation is now our number one greenhouse gas problem.		“To me it’s kind of the elephant in the room and no one wants to address it,” says Slate’s @henrygrabar. https://t.co/AmZlhBmYVc
