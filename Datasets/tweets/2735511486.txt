@mitchellvii The truth is crooked Hillary was despised and rejected by voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, where she barely campaigned. America didn‚Äôt want a 3rd term Obama. They didn‚Äôt want sexual predator Bill living in the WH again either.
@mitchellvii Let‚Äôs not forget that Trump has given Putin a cold shoulder, severe sanctions, and won‚Äôt meet with Putin. That is your best evidence Trump never colluded with Putin or Russia.
@mitchellvii The best evidence that the Socialist Democrats won‚Äôt fix the alleged social problems is that they have been in charge for decades in managing many Blue Cities, with loads of money. But we see 3rd world conditions, opioids, gangs, and unsanitary conditions worse than ever before.
@mitchellvii All true. The Socialist Democrat Party always comes up with nonsensical,  contradictory, and inconsistent allegations that defy any sane rationale. But, they know their voters are too stupid to see that or just don‚Äôt care about such absurdities.
@mitchellvii Let‚Äôs not forget that the DNC and Hillary did nothing even approaching reasonable to protect their digital, computer equipment.  They were too busy in raising $1.3B for Hillary‚Äôs horrible campaign. A 13 year old kid could have hacked and stole everything they had stored.
@mitchellvii All true. That was one of Comey‚Äôs gravest violations of the public trust. He didn‚Äôt  seize the evidence at the crime scene, the server. He came up with a stupid, flimsy excuse he was given a copy of the server.
@beehive1027 @mitchellvii Cohen deserves 20-25 years in federal and state prison for his many crimes that weren‚Äôt even prosecuted against him, especially by NY state.
@beehive1027 @mitchellvii Given the great magnitude of Cohen‚Äôs many crimes, just as bad as Manafort‚Äòs tax evasions, Cohen got only 3 years, and will be free in 2 years. Plus, NY State is giving him a free pass for his state crimes.  America‚Äôs justice system really sucks with inequality of treatment.
@mitchellvii The Socialist Democrat Party is Racist, because they openly, blatantly, and brazenly solicit and pander for racial and ethnic based voters. They tell various identity groups that they will fix their alleged suffering or injustices, but they have had 50 years to fix that stuff.
@mitchellvii Rand is too damn theoretical at times. His job is to stop the invasion of illegals and phony asylum crossers. That is imperative. The Socialist Democrats used horrible and dishonest reasons to block border walls. Rand should therefore vote in ways to stop the horrible dishonesty!
@mitchellvii Rand isn‚Äôt saying their is not a border national emergency. He is saying he dislikes the 1970 decade law giving powers to the presidency. But he hasn‚Äôt filed a bill to repeal or scale down that National Emergency law. These guys never file laws to back up their TV talk.
@mitchellvii Rand likes to think we live or should live in a perfect world.  The Socialist Democrat Party is the exact opposite: violate the constitution, abuse power, conduct witch hunts, and want illegals to arrive into the USA and vote for their candidates.
