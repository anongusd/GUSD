It was amazing to listen to @PeteStauber ‚Äòs phone town hall, and have him talk about being shot in the head! And still pro 2 amendment. Who could argue with him?!
@TeamCavuto You should have grilled the attorney asking him why he took the case! No private attorney has to take any case! He chose to!!! If she comes back and does any harm it‚Äôs blood on his hands.

@Barnes_Law Yesss!!!!! Smart attorney!!!
@TomiLahren @hmarie52 @realDonaldTrump @foxnation We need to close the loopholes within the legal immigration system no one is talking about. Prosecutorial discretion of fraud??? Benefits for anyone who claims abuse whether false or not? Never ANY cross examinations or participation by interested parties? Etc.
As a Catholic @RaymondArroyo we are taught from birth that in the face of persecution for our beliefs we do NOT back down. Persecution for attending a pro life event included. It‚Äôs part of our Catholic culture/teaching. Where is the tolerance for our culture?
Denied due process. See VAWA in Ina denting usc ability to see or defend against false allegations. Ina says not to rely on accused evidence. AND privacy act violations, all bcuz USC and not aliens. USC forced into contracts w/out due process. Please talk to 1,000‚Äôs of victims!
@Barnes_Law please consider representing victims of immigration fraud who are denied any ability to participate in fed admin proceeding simply for being US Cotizens. And denied access to own documents bcuz USCIS refuses to maintain files on US Citizens placing in alien files.
@PeteStauber @tomemmer @RepRarick We love @RepRarick as Congressman! I hope when he becomes Senator we have a good replacement for Congress!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@USCIS Then why do you fail to review evidence from all parties involved?
@RaymondArroyo You should look at St. John‚Äôs in collegeville, mn. A whole lot of scandal there too and that‚Äôs only what is published. What I saw as a student and experienced was extremely disappointing. I lost all respect for the brothers there. Very sad. #stillcatholic #stillhopeful
@USCIS My sponsored alien was NEVER vetted, errors all over papers, fraud on docs while USCIS NEVER interviewed and no investigation after reported fraud. Instead I was retaliated against by the alien and USCIS did NOTHING! Watch Fed court of claims lawsuit coming up! #youaretheloophole
Biggest lie ever! MN HSI says not enough resources to investigate all cases and Obama mandate said prosecutorial discretion began as early as possible even before investigation. They approved the con who defrauded me and my patents without investigation!!!! #lies @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/s0ZIerZ6Ba
@USCIS HSI says they don‚Äôt have enough resources to investigate all cases and that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt investigate one sided marriage fraud. ASK MN HSI!!!
@USCIS 100% false!!! Look at Obama‚Äôs memo that said prosecutorial discretion begins at investigative stage and to NOT even investigate fraud if alien has a child. The retaliation and harassment of My daughter and I are the product of that policy! RE-OPEN THOSE CASES and INVESTIGATE!
@MNHypnosis @PeteStauber Not unless you are a constituent
Hurray!!! https://t.co/bqEubPDqXU

@KarinHousley Why not a bill against retaliation for ppl when they turn in illegal aliens and those who have committed immigration related crimes? There are no protections currently for Minnesotans who are then terrorized by the accused.

@DHSgov How about lying and defrauding sponsors to get them to sign an I-864 so you can get a green card? Is that considered suspicious because so far @DHSgov has never talked about prosecuted aliens for defrauding sponsors.
@ICEgov @DHSgov @POTUS Untrue. Ask all the I-864 contract holders who were defrauded into them if DHS has put Americans first? Are they protecting our borders by letting conmen and criminals in? I think not. And DOJ NEVER GETS cases of immigration marriage fraud so they are never prioritized!
@ImSchultz @PeteStauber Can‚Äôt wait!! Congressman Nolan already asked to send my case over! I hope we finally get out of this immigration fraud/witness retaliation hell we‚Äôve been in for the last 4 years!
@PeteStauber @ImSchultz Hurray!!! We need help ASAP! Many years of suffering without help!
@Jason2CD victims of immigration marriage fraud would like to speak with you! When can we meet to discuss all of the loopholes within the legal immigration system allowing criminals to enter our country ‚Äúlegally‚Äù through fraud?!
@Maggda_Lena @USCIS @ICEgov @TheJusticeDept Exactly! And they won‚Äôt do anything! @ICEgov @USCIS @DHSgov
USCIS wants you to report fraud but when you do, and get retaliated against they abandon you. Witness retaliation and tampering rampant! Ask the victims! 1,000‚Äôs across US! https://t.co/4OId4rCWl9
@USCIS If I say something PROTECT ME! Prosecute retaliation and tampering!!! Give witnesses rights and protections!!!
@USCIS And when you are retaliated against then what? I informed USCIS of fraud and my divorce prior to 2nd anniversary and he retaliated and tampered! @uscis St. Paul said they don‚Äôt ensure these violations are prosecuted!!! Fraud throughout USCIS proceedings! #youaretheloophole
@USCIS @ICEgov @TheJusticeDept Unless it‚Äôs one sided where the alien defrauds the US Citizen and sponsors. THAT USCIS refuses to recognize or prosecute even though ICE speaks of it in their brochure! #youaretheloophole
@MrJoeBlackwood @USCIS @ICEgov @doj The crime victim rights act doesn‚Äôt apply to administrative proceedings (ie. USCIS) do victims are retaliated against, harassed, death threats, financially destroyed while @DHSgov allied it claiming ‚Äúno policy‚Äù against witness tampering, retaliation or obstruction.
@MrJoeBlackwood @USCIS @ICEgov @doj And then there is the secondary issue of VAWA fraud, the easiest method to defraud the US and get a green card. Google it and you will understand. There are so many loopholes that aliens all know how to use. And no method to obtain justice for victims.
@MrJoeBlackwood @USCIS @ICEgov @doj There are 1000‚Äôs of these cases across the US and common contract laws apply as sponsors sign I-864‚Äôs with the Feds. Ultimately the Feds also engage in the fraud when they fail to vet the alien and then fail to enforce the law once fraud is discovered.
@MrJoeBlackwood @USCIS @ICEgov @doj That‚Äôs what fraud is. If you‚Äôre trying to say someone should never be defrauded then why have laws against it? Because unfortunately it does happen. And not to internet dates, these are ppl who have dated 4+ years, known their spouse since childhood (being immigrants themselves).
@USCIS @ICEgov @doj Unless it‚Äôs one sided where the alien defrauds the US Citizen and sponsors. THAT USCIS refuses to recognize or prosecute even though ICE speaks of it in their brochure! #youaretheloophole
@RaymondArroyo please meet with victims of immigration fraud and marriage fraud! We‚Äôve reached out through your website! We have a large group that wishes to tell you what is really going on inside the legal immigration system! The loopholes! Please let us tell you! üòä
@JessicaV_CIS Same has happened in MN and he was disciplined by the board but not criminally prosecuted, why?! We need those who aid and abet to be prosecuted just the same!
@Jason2CD You need to start looking at the loopholes within the legal immigration system that no one is talking about! It‚Äôs worse than the border crisis and we know the border crisis is horrible!
@RaymondArroyo @IngrahamAngle The wall is only a part of the problem. The loopholes within the legal immigration system are insane. Look up "vawa fraud" and you will start to see just a small sampling of the loopholes criminal immigrants use to remain in the US. Speak to the victims of FRAUD! We are Here!
@RaymondArroyo She was awesome!
@RaymondArroyo @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews There is also a legal immigration crisis, which is drenched in fraud and the feds are doing NOTHING about it. The 1000's of sponsors defrauded by immigrants are being denied any ability to void their contracts. The feds stick them with the bill while letting criminals stay.
@ICEgov I‚Äôve got a case with an attorney who ran an immigration fraud scheme and engaged in obstruction, witness tampering/retaliation. Who investigates these cases? ICE said they don‚Äôt investigate tampering, retaliation, obstruction etc.
@PeteStauber Congratulations!

Most prevalent in the family based immigration. And the victims of the fraud are being denied any rights and protections afforded all other federal crime victims.

@USCIS DHS removal priorities in 2014-15, when My EX was applying for immigration relief after having defrauded me and my parents into signing an I-864, said, if he files a civil suit against me, he can essentially be granted relief to stay. He was NEVER investigated, never interviewed.
@USCIS My ex filed a malicious, frivolous  proceeding against me, retaliating against me for providing information to USCIS, and USCIS said they don't ensure obstruction, retaliation/tampering is prosecuted. That "it's like going to the zoo and asking for a plane ticket." MN USCIS
@USCIS DHS 2 consider factors: extenuating circumstances offense of conviction; extended length of time since offense; length of time in US; military service; family or community ties in US; victim/witness/plaintiff in	civil or criminal proceedings; or compelling humanitarian factors.
@USCIS Obama Mandate: "Thus, DHS personnel are expected to exercise discretion and pursue these priorities at all stages of the enforcement process-from the earliest investigative stage" &lt;-- That's right, to NOT EVEN INVESTIGATE FRAUD! Read it yourself! ---&gt; https://t.co/Lc29rgVIoe

@NY1 YET, victims of immigration marriage fraud are FORCED to send their US CITIZEN children to go with the very alien who defrauded them and are merely using the child as an anchor baby, which is an OBAMA administration policy. But no one wants to talk about the VICTIMS of fraud.
@RepDavidEPrice why don't you include rights for victims &amp; witnesses in @USCIS administative proceedings. The Crime Victim Rights Act doesn't apply to admin proceedings, leaving victims and witnesses without ANY resources or protections. Do something for them! You have victims in your district!
@RollingStone it would be lovely if they helped victims of immigration-related crimes which are prosecuted by @USCIS because the CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT normally grants victims and witnesses rights and protections when prosecuted by DOJ. But becuase USCIS is administrative, they have NOTHING!

@TimothyBair @USCIS And given the fact that as soon as an alien claims a sponsor has abused or neglected them, the sponsor is considered a "prohibited source" and can no longer provide USCIS with evidence of fraud, we have a big problem.... FRAUD must be investigated as a separate issue than vawa.

@garryelliott11 @FAIRImmigration Technically yes since the illegal entry was done through FRAUD forcing into an unlawful I-864 contract, with litigation costs and other damages. This is the OTHER side no one tells you about. There are 1,000‚Äôs of fraud victims across the US.
@polytope124 @MimiSoltysik And there are always those who once in power change their mind from wanting the same as the low class. Humans are naturally selfish and giving them power reveals that. Hence why every soc gov lives well while ppl don‚Äôt.
@polytope124 @MimiSoltysik Because human psychology is averse to lack of goals, lack of ambition to grow, same work while others do less, all of which socialism is. a healthy person needs long term and short term goals and ability to get better. The only goal soc. allows is the hope to escape.
@EnufKapital @MimiSoltysik Why don‚Äôt you try an experiment on a smaller scale, a diverse community of ppl first. Soon human psychology is the ruler and you will see that there is always, ALWAYS, those who want more power and to live better. The US isn‚Äôt putting steaks on the plates of the Cuban gov.
@garryelliott11 @FAIRImmigration FRAUD, so yes. I-864 contract holders defrauded into signing the contract, and all other costs in between.

@TurnMNRed @Abolish_ICE_ @MNJeffJohnson Now we need to practice secure FRAUD! I-864 sponsors defrauded are begging for deportations.

@Mabelrose2 @MNJeffJohnson Tell that to all the fraud victims begging HSI/ICE to investigate and prosecute one-sided marriage fraud. ICE says not enough resources. ALL fraud victims want more ICE. Victims are immigrants too! No one ever thinks of us!

@RepMcSally Why aren‚Äôt you putting forth bills to protect those that see something and say something? 1000‚Äôs retaliated against while DHS says no policy to protect them! &amp; start protecting I-864 victims of fraud! Void those contracts from inception!

@SpoxDHS @DHSgov These are actual laws DHS is violating against Americans and placing our national security at risk. When will you finally talk to fraud victims who know the legal loopholes better than anyone!?!?!?
@SpoxDHS @DHSgov Yet DHS epically FAILS victims of fraud, even refusing to allow us our rights under the HSA, which require us to be notified as parties. We can‚Äôt even get a status of I-864 much less participate in the proceeding determining the outcome of it!!! Regulations need to be changed!
Indeed.... every day criminals go to prison and their kids don‚Äôt go with them... send those who committed marriage fraud home and give us back our freedom! The fraud is on paper for goodness sakes! https://t.co/IbnWI1qz5p
@SpoxDHS @SenFeinstein Right on! You better tell USCIS that reproduction isn‚Äôt a defense for benefit/contract fraud too. Let victims of fraud out of their I-864‚Äôs and deport them!
@RepMcSally @SpoxDHS Then why aren‚Äôt you putting forward anti-fraud laws for ALL apps?! Marriage fraud victims are begging for you to enforce contract laws and get us out of I-864‚Äôs we were defrauded into! Talk to the victims for once!!!

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump There are waivers for everything, including FRAUD. Loopholes?! It's all within the legal immigration system. USCIS allow aliens to say ANYTHING about YOU, then puts that in alien files and denies you access to view or correct it! Talk about FRAUD! everywhere! #Youaretheloophole

@WhiteHouse Why don‚Äôt you try including the victims of fraud in that round table! Those who know 1st hand how the system is abused?! #youaretheloophole
@DHSgov @SecNielsen @POTUS Why doesn‚Äôt this round table ever include the actual victims of fraud who know 1st hand how the system is abused?! Staying ignorant DHS... #youaretheloophole
@USCIS @TheJusticeDept @StateDept @DHSgov Really? Officer Escobar‚Äôs investigation consisted of only interviewing the victim. The alien who committed marriage fraud, NEVER interviewed during ANY of the process starting with k-1. How is that an investigation?
@RepMcSally @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @freedomcaucus Asking @USCIS to ensure aliens who engage in obstruction and tampering are prosecuted is likened to asking the "zoo for an airplane ticket" says @USICS St. Paul Field Office. ABSURD!!! This si happening ALL OVER the U.S., there are 1000's of victims. Why is this not included?! https://t.co/Rj16RuxDD9
@RepMcSally @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @freedomcaucus WHERE are your provisions for victims, witnesses &amp; informants?! Immigration proceedings are so beyond corrupt, they ARE the giant gaping loophole for criminals and terrorists to enter the U.S. Why don't you talk to the victims?! They know where the loopholes are! https://t.co/IYcZ90NFLu
@RepMcSally @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @freedomcaucus Why don't you have a clause allowing VICTIMS of I-864 fraud to void their contract from inception?! The Administrative Procedures Act doesn't grant victims/witnesses protections like the CVRA! WE need a VICTIM FOCUSED BILL! Fraud, marraige fraud, benefit fraud victims need help!
@RepMcSally @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @freedomcaucus Yes STILL the bill doesn't protect victims, witnesses or informants!!! Gangs can't retaliate against witnesses, but if not a gang member and retaliating during legal immigration proceeding, that's OKAY! No FRAUD protections for americans forced into I-864's! WTH?!
@RepGoodlatte @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Your bill does NEXT TO NOTHING to close the LEGAL IMMIGRATION LOOPHOLES which harm victims, witnesses and informants of immigration-related crimes and place our national security at risk. under APA, victims have ZERO RIGHTS or PROTECTIONS! WHY DON'T YOU CARE ENOUGH TO HELP?!?!!?
@RepGoodlatte @IngrahamAngle Your bill is a joke and fails to address ANY of the issues facing AMERICAN victims of immigration-related crimes. You make it deportable for GANG members to engage in obstruction, tampering, retaliation, but all others can? Because they ARE within legal proceedings!
So USCIS, who ONLY allows aliens to participate (when 1 spouse is in opposition - only supporting spouses can!) in proceeding which determines if marriage is valid is going to tell house/senate whether program has fraud?  @RepGoodlatte @RepMcSally @RepMcCaul @Raul_Labrador SMH
Goodlatte Bill, establishes review of fraud in programs: VAWA and Marriage, but WHO 2 INVESTIGATE THIS? SAME USCIS refusing US Citizens to review  info said about them and their own marriage? Who holds ex-parte proceedings? @RepGoodlatte @RepMcSally @RepMcCaul @Raul_Labrador
Legal Immigration System, will remain corrupt &amp; inept despite Goodlatte Bill, because it doesn't discuss ANY of the the 9 regulation loopholes which almost encourage fraud! @RepGoodlatte @RepMcSally @RepMcCaul @Raul_Labrador
Nothing in Goodlatte Bill for VICTIMS of FRAUD, being denied ability to participate in proceedings or AMERICANS who have info said about them, and held by USCIS, but denied access to own info. @RepGoodlatte @RepMcSally @RepMcCaul @Raul_Labrador The bill is a JOKE!
Goodlatte Bill, an EPIC FAILURE for all Victims, Witnesses &amp; Informants of immigration related crimes. @RepGoodlatte @RepMcSally @RepMcCaul @Raul_Labrador NOTHING to protect from retaliation, intimidation, obstruction unless alien is a GANG MEMBER! All others it's OKAY. SMH

I want FREEDOM.... that‚Äôs it. No more being shackled to an illegal alien who entered through fraud, who the Feds fail to prosecute. I want FREEDOM!
@AJDelgado13 Good Mothers are being dragged through family court in the same manner, by Immigrants who first defrauded them, then left them after they got the green card, but use the child as an anchor. The Government ALLOWS for WAIVERS that let them exploit children. It's a nightmare.
@OnBoardSerenity @AJDelgado13 @andylassner @JasonMillerinDC @CNN Now imagine the "other parent" is also an ALIEN, who DEFRAUDED YOU for a Green Card and is only using the child as an ANCHOR, while the FEDS refuse to enforce immigration laws, and instead allow him to remain in the US to continue the hell he is putting you through.

@USCIS why don't you take US Citizen complaints of one-sided marriage fraud seriously and allow them to expose the fraudulent statements made ABOUT THEMSELVES by the alien? How can you uncover fraud when the subject of the statement isn't allow to see or refute the false statements?!
@USCIS why don't you propose rules that reflect Congressional intent which affect victims of fraud?! not a single rule has been proposed which would rectify your current unlawful and inept policies which harm US Citizens, and deny them their basic constitutional rights.
@USCISMediaVT yet still ONLY 2-sided conspiracies are investigated and prosecuted. If you happen to be an ACTUAL VICTIM of the fraud, DHS refuses to investigate or prosecute, therefore forcing you into an unlawful I-864 contract, allowing them to EXTORT $ from you if the alien becomes a charge
@ICEgov @USCIS @EVerify So employers can check the status of the alien, but the SPONSOR still can't. WTF?! The employer gets access to the status of the "consideration" for the I-864 contract, yet the SPONSOR can't?! You should probably disclose that on the I-864 form PRIOR. @USCISSucks #GovFraud
@USCIS But you WON'T help U.S. Citizens who CONTRACTED WITH YOU, or protect THEM &amp; put THEIR ECONOMIC interests FIRST by combating and enforcing marriage/contract FRAUD! WTF?! You probably should have disclosed that PRIOR to the USC entering into the I-864. #USCISSucks #GovFraud
@ICEgov @USCIS @EVerify why don't you do the same for those defrauded into I-864's? Why don't you EVER give ANY services or support to US Citizen victims of immigration fraud? What is going on here?!?!
@USCIS And when it‚Äôs discovered the us Citizen has been defrauded, then what?! So far USCIS refuses to enforce common contract laws and instead forces us citizens into unlawful contracts failing to prosecute fraud. You talk a big talk, but that‚Äôs where it ends.
@USCISMediaPA @USCIS Because USCIS is only concerned with alien victims. Us Citizen victims of benefit and marriage fraud, however, are denied any protections, rights or services. Denied ability to even get copy of OWN info, incl own contract with Feds! #insane
@USCIS YOU are the immigration scam, claiming as soon as us Citizen applies for benefit on behalf of alien the ya Citizen application is placed in alien file so us Citizen needs alien permission to obtain copy much less provide info &amp; act as party, regarding being defrauded into it!
@USCIS Where‚Äôs the policy doc where you state as soon as a us Citizen is opposed to an immigration benefit you no longer include them in any proceedings &amp; they are denied access to own info?! As long as they support it however they can participate and receive info. Where‚Äôs that one?!

@realDonaldTrump get off the guns &amp; back to draining swamps! Law enforcement isn‚Äôt doing their job! Plain and simple! Ask 1000‚Äôs of victims of retaliation who said something when they saw something! Same story! Local law won‚Äôt do anything &amp; fbi won‚Äôt. So wait to die?! @FoxNews
It‚Äôs a start. Now they must realize Americans are applicants too and when they are defrauded their needs, protections and welfare must take priority over ANY alien who had defrauded them! https://t.co/ncTQoO0uNY
@CortesSteve This is a FAILED law enforcement policy issue starting with the FBI. Who fails victims of retaliation and intimidation when they see something and say something, every day! Ask the victims! The FBI # won‚Äôt even take the complaint!!!
@CBSNews @KellyannePolls Yet he refuses to speak with victims of immigration benefit and marriage fraud!!!
@USCISmediaTX This is untrue! 1000‚Äôs of fraud victims know that only co-conspiracy fraud is looked at. One-sided marriage fraud is let go! Never investigated. Easiest way to a green card is to dupe the USC!
@USCIS Unless you are a US Citizen applicant. That‚Äôs when the integrity ends. They are so happy for you to apply but won‚Äôt let you get out of a fraudulent contract.
@FoxNews the @FBI hotline attendants are INEPT! They tell witnesses &amp; informants of immigration crimes that retaliation/intimidation is not illegal. They don‚Äôt even know the laws &amp; so they don‚Äôt take all complaints and local field offices never get anything! We need a better way!
@USCIS So when the petitioner/applicant realizes they were defrauded how do they get that application voided? So far USCIS says you are stuck and hey can even grant a waiver if YOU bring defrauded.
@USCIS And it also ends when a US Citizen signs am I-864. After they are stuck in the contract USCIS fails to perform! Allows fraud, grants fraud waivers, &amp; denies USC‚Äôs a copy of their OWN form! Much less status info or ability to get out due to contract law violations. #corruption
