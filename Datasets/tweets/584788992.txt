@NBCNews What that parasite mob of Democrats are doing to @POTUS is criminal.  Theft of Service, aka, stealing from tax payers has 8 yr. prison sentence, + compensatory.
@politico Well it was obvious that the parasite mob Democrats in Congress wanted more attention than peace talks with North Korea.  However, what that mob is doing now to @POTUS  is criminal, Theft of Service, aka stealing from tax payers has 8 yr. prison sentence &amp; compensatory damages
@TomFitton Look in Political LAW, Revised Codes, Theft of Service has a prison sentence of 8 yrs., &amp; what Nadler &amp; the rest of that parasite mob are doing is stealing from the tax payers to attack @POTUS   Also carries huge fines as compensatory punishment.
@POTUSPress Well I would like a poverty stricken elderly new deal too, if BO the sicko would have instead of shoring up a lot of gov't worker retirements, given each person a part of his plan, many  of us could have risen above poverty.
@realDonaldTrump And they can be IMPEACHED too, can be indicted even for Theft of Service which carries an 8 yr. prison term.  They are using our tax money to abuse the power they have to harass our duly elected President.

@realDonaldTrump When I heard that, I knew immediately what you were doing.  However, you know I pay attention, am not jealous, am thankful you are working for the people not some criminal mob called the Democrat party, &amp; making our Nation GREAT again.
@realDonaldTrump Looks like that bunch of INSNE jealous Democrats in the House are sending out 60 subpoenas tomorrow on our dollar.  Tax payers are paying for their insanity.
@SarahPalinUSA BET NONE OF THEM HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BETTERING OUR NATION, just their INSANE hateful jealousy.
@senrobportman N. Korean leader said he did not know what they were doing to Otto.  Maybe he did not, do any of us know for sure, NO. &amp; now we are into a stinking week of this.  We all hurt for the family, &amp; what happened, but we also know BO the Sicko caused all of this, by doing NOTHING.

@Patrici15767099 In St. Petersburg, there is a grave of over 4 million Catholics exterminated by Hitler's henchmen.  And Poland so many were exterminated.  Believe 55 million people killed by Hitler in his camps, including the 6 million Jewish people.
@Patrici15767099 @POTUS brought the capital of Israel to Jerusalem, &amp; this evidently Jewish dumb moron compares him to Hitler, sadly a very stupid Jewish person.  She said Hitler was killing "her" people.  Hitler killed more Catholics than he did Jews, but Catholics did not say much about that.
@marklevinshow That is probably the little these very ignorant CNN vomit blabberers know.  Notice they think it is "shocking" to compare, when in truth most just sound limited &amp; ignorant in their knowledge.

@marklevinshow Since Rep. Gaetz attacked the cheating shyster, that is not good.  Don't want that practice recognized, how else can they keep that quiet?  Perhaps this Representative is truly honest.  What shyster do you know that is truly honest?  Not many.
@darreldrowland Jordon made it clear they had a pathological, arrogant, stupid shyster blabbing before them.  Another of millions of shysters running around looking for easy money, because most cannot make a living on their own.  Have to work for tax payers.  Easy money, can't be fired.
@carolmswain Well she is getting attention so she can run as a DemocRAT, &amp; get funding from abortion clinics so they can cut up new born babies for profit.  When abortion aka killing life was made legal, it was $400, now evidently $800.

@realDonaldTrump That thinking is back in our House of Representatives right now.  Frightening,.
@realDonaldTrump Given the ABUSE of POWER &amp; nonsense actions of the Democrats yesterday not permitting witness to answer, those moron idiots who either legally or illegally voted for that mess on that Committee should be psychiatric evaluated.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump And we are still paying for that shyster crap horrid expense about nothing pertaining to @POTUS. This ongoing harassment of our President is CRIMINAL.
@seanhannity @realDonaldTrump And @Ford does not owe the people of the United States BILLIONS of dollars as G. M. does.  EXCELLENT for our workers &amp; our economy
@Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @AdamSchiff All you had to do was listen to that garbage &amp; ABUSE of POWER yesterday levied upon AG @ActingWhitaker   What I want to know is who is paying for that crap we witnessed yesterday?  And why is that permitted in the people's house?
@axios It was definitely an ABUSE of Power by jealous, hateful in my opinion insane Democrats. They spent more time on their YES &amp; NO dictates than they did on asking questions, &amp; getting answers.  That was a fiasco.

@Roosterman82 @ImabitcSumtimes @RealCandaceO @RealCandaceO Candace Hitler was a FASCIST.  He had women in WHITE marching for him, so I would put all those women in WHITE at the SOTU as the FASCIST FEMS.	Hitler also was a psychopathic sociopath, but I think FASCIST FEMS to DEMS.

@SavingAmerica4U That was about women in workforce, &amp; she wanted @POTUS to see that was the only thing she really agreed about.  Everything else was following another's lead.
@Vicky4Trump @Dawn_DeMore1 @SpeakerPelosi PELOSI looked like she did not know what was happening, did you notice she followed @VP most of the time, it was strange.  Honestly believe she is into dimentia.
@jtd_gameon12 PELOSI looked like she had no clue as to what was happening, believe that was the President's speech she was attempting to read.  Did you notice she would look to @VP believe she is into extreme dimentia.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @inittowinit007 Listen to her, she is completely FAKE, not real, living a FACADE.
@correctthemedia @jakepalmieri The stupidity of this, did you notice all these women looking around to see if they were allowed to stand &amp; cheer for what is such a good thing for women.  Ridiculous

@SenTedCruz @sxdoc @senjudiciary Sadly, our Constitution states that clueless Cory a Democrat can ask ridiculous questions of educated, honorable nominees so the nominees can point out his question is ignorant given circumstances.  Agree Senator, You are correct.  Democrats creating a nightmare.
@chuckwoolery Are you talking about Clueless Cory, who asks @POTUS  nominees about things that nominees have never been in a position to do?
@henryrodgersdc @DailyCaller @FoxNews @TheFive Cory Booker is so unprepared, does not do the work he was elected to do, &amp; asks the most stupid of questions to the judicial nominees.  What an ignorant person Booker is.

@LadyRedWave As long as the Democrat criminal political consortium is permitted to prevail in this Nation, killing new born infants will soon be killing everyone over 65, even though a goodly percentage of people that age are working because young people cannot seem to do the jobs.
@realDonaldTrump The only name callers in this entire mess we have in D. C. are the ineffective &amp; sadly very ignorant Democrats.  We have been divided since WWII, &amp; it progressively gets worse through sadly extreme jealousy of your ability to make things better, which none of them have &amp; resent.
@realDonaldTrump What do these extremely ineffective Democrat politicians think a "white supremacist" is?  KKK that is Democrat, no Republicans have ever been members of the KKK.  Nazis, I thought we won WWII, but Democrats evidently don't know that, routine stupidity.
@realDonaldTrump Just now @WKBN Sherrod Brown stated he hoped you would not appeal to "white supremacists" &amp; not call names.  Brown is a political parasite has been for years, done very little for Ohio, but definitely is a name caller as evidenced above.
@WKBN Brown just said he hoped @POTUS would not appeal to "white supremacists".  That ignorant well paid Democrat does not want "name calling".  What did he just say?  What is a white supremacist, to him someone who is educated, because he is not?
@johnrobertsFox @CoryBooker Another stupid well paid Democrat.  Sherrod Brown just did a zinger on @WKBN .  Brown the dummy Senator from Ohio just said he hoped @POTUS would not appeal to white supremacists &amp; not call names. Democrats can't talk w/o calling names, too stupid.
@realDonaldTrump Wish they would stop the bull about Lyndon Johnson, if it were not for the Republican Congress at that time, no Democrat voted for that in Congress then.  Democrats are KKK
@realDonaldTrump Sadly both Schumer &amp; Pelosi are stuck on stupid, &amp; neither of them have any concern for the people of this Nation.  INVASION they are totally in agreement, &amp; now, infanticide, KILLING INFANTS at Birth.  EXPUNGE this criminal Democrat party.
@AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @BretBaier If stuck on stupid PELOSI makes any of her ugly childish faces, that will only come back on her like her non existent Biblical quotes.
@AmericaNewsroom To me, PELOSI is stuck on stupid.  I do not know her academic background, not honorary but actual.  She is one stubborn ignorant woman, caring little for the people of this Nation.
@senrobportman Mayor Tito Brown is a very fine man, know him, think the World of him.  Know his concerns are for the City of Youngstown.  Thank you for inviting him to @POTUS SOTU speech.  Good Senator.
@LizWFB She is Catholic, like all Democrats are Catholic, now Bishops are refusing to give communion to those who promote abortion.  That is nearly their entire congregations, hypocrites all, &amp; Pelosi has no clue as to what the Bible teaches or she would not be a Democrat.
@NevadaJack2 And got paid very well for doing that, is Cortex paying her to attend the SOTU.

@mr65gibson @grammy620 But this fine Justice did not want to kill babies after they were born, &amp; that is why this picture hit media.  How any medical doctor can condone killing a healthy baby to me perverts the practice of medicine.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I BELIEVE THESE MORONS DO THIS SO THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU WILL PUT THEIR UGLY MUGS on Twitter.  Who cares?  Frankly it will be all I can do to watch, because I think Pelosi is deliberately endangering all of us with her stubborn stupidity or dimentia.
@RealWayneRoot Democrats founded the KKK to kill the freed people of this Nation that my ancestors 2 died in the Civil War.  Democrats pushed abortion, now they kill babies when born, yet they all are Catholic.  Main thing they are, are hypocritical LIARS.
@KAG4All Catholics are mostly Democrat, thus they support abortion, if they vote Democrat, thus most of the congregation could not take communion.
@winstonCovfefe @sxdoc @NeonNettle How many times did he shoot himself to kill himself, as all the deaths around this pig Clinton are all suicides &amp; usually have to shoot themselves 2 or 3 times to kill themselves, like Vince Foster  twice.

@wvufanagent99a @Jamierodr10 IMPEACH PELOSI, she is endangering the people of the United States with here stubborn stupidity, putting all of us in jeopardy because she is what dimented or just plain stupid.  But deliberately endangering we the people is a HIGH CRIME.

@RedNationRising @SpeakerPelosi Well her dimented tweet should be too, is it true that Nancy takes more dimentia drugs than any other old fart in Congress?  Might ask pharmacist that, &amp; are we paying for her drugs?

@21WFMJ @TODAYshow Will you call this man on his fabrications.  Viet Nam NO.  Went in as a private, came out as a private, learned refrigerator mechanic.  Tried to invade Cathedral in D. C. today.  Who is threatening lives of people in Covington, Kentucky?  Today Show won't ask any of that.
@marklevinshow Dictator Mark, definitely &amp; she has no authority to block the President of the United States who is granted that authority to convene both houses of Congress for the SOTU or other reasons.  She is stupid, she never read the constitution, &amp; she does not belong as Speaker.
@trish_regan @VP She does not have that authority over the President.  Article 2 Section 3 Constitution which the drunk probably has never read let alone understood gives President full right to convene both Houses of Congress for SOTU &amp; other reasons if he wishes to address them.
@IngrahamAngle Great show last night, will be watching tonight.
@IngrahamAngle Pelosi does not have that authority over the President.  Article 2, Section 3 gives the President the right to convene both houses of Congress for the purpose of the SOTU speech.
RT @charliekirk11: In Los Angeles county 112% of the population is registered to vote		And the left says there is no voter fraud?		ü§î
@charliekirk11 OMG, does not anyone know that the total is always 100%, and the mean voting ratio is 30%  Here Youngstown, Ohio 14% vote Canfield, Ohio 83% vote, no where does even 100% vote.
@PeteHegseth Yep. Both wandered around there wherever it was.  It certainly was not Viet Nam.
@seanhannity Awful.  2013 more black babies aborted than born.  Genocide.
@ABC She does nopt have that authority over the President who under Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution has right to convene both houses of Congress.
@seanhannity I walked on that street.  Beautiful Poinsettia Trees lined the side streets.
@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Rep. @GOPLeader is bringing a Privilege Resolution tomorrow for VOTE.  Pelosi does not have this authority.  President Trump under Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution can convene the Congress, both Houses.
@GOPLeader Excellent, thank you Representative McCarthy.  This must not wallow in the swamp of deceit in D. C.  This is our Nation, our Heritage, our President.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @jcoralpark Putrid Kerry, the dill pickle heir.
@SteveScalise @JessieJaneDuff NOT pay or did they go home.  Reports were that Pelosi told them to go home, &amp; pulled that bill.  Pelosi is either wanting to be dictator or her alcohol soaked brain is into dimentia.  Her last trip $60,000+ tax payers paid for alcohol.  Wow.  A Rep. put that on Twitter earlier.
@seanhannity @PA4TAXPAYERS Definitely has right, Pelosi with her alcohol soaked brain does not have &amp; WHY did she pull the BILL today to pay workers &amp; I believe to fund the poor, &amp; told the Democrats to go home. WHAT is this drunk doing? Her last trip tax payers pd for $60,000+ alcohol.
@TomiLahren @Twhite4412 @realDonaldTrump He has to lift the the freeze on the liable laws too.
@TuckerCarlson https://t.co/HysmiccN74
@RobChristie11 @glennyork SO sweet.
@BreitbartNews @PatriotMarie Pelosi today pulled the BILL to pay them &amp; told Democrats to go home.  Who is doIng what here?  Either she wants to be dictator or her brain is soaked with all the alcohol tax payers pay for her expensive orgy drinking trips.  Last trip cost tax payers $350,000+, $60,000 alcohol.
@charliekirk11 @glennyork Ryan would be DEAD.
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews @seanhannity @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Hope you read Article 2, Section 3.  Dana Perino just said on @TuckerCarlson that Pelosi can do this.  Also why did Pelosi pull bills today to pay workers &amp; fund poor I believe &amp; told the Democrats to go home?
@TuckerCarlson Artic le 2 Section 3 of the Constitution give the power to the President to Convene both houses of Congress.  Pelosi has no power against the President, speaking to Congress.  Love @DanaPerino but read Constitution.
@sxdoc Phillips went in a private, came out a private, &amp; was a refrigerator mechanic, never had any connection to Viet Nam.
@smalltownandrew @AOC Wealthy already pay 80% of the taxes, this dumb idiot is so stupid, yet, people seem to be amazed by her position.  WHY, dumb morons like her have been elected to Congress for years.

@NBCNews Pelosi sent the Democrats home today, pulled the bill to pay the workers not being paid &amp; fund the poor, what is Pelosi attempting, to be our dictator or is her alcohol soaked brain into complete dimentia?  Tax payers got soaked $60,000+ for alcohol for one of her expensive trips
@marcorubio @jguaido @realDonaldTrump I walked on that street where all those poor people were running.  Pray Venezuela will become whole again, &amp; the people will be able to live &amp; have food.
@RepStevenSmith She either wants to be dictator, or her alcohol soaked brain that tax payers get shafted into paying $60,000 plus for her alcohol for her stupid expensive trips, her alcohol soaked brain is into dimentia.
@DavidLimbaugh The people are, &amp; we are disgusted with this waste of our tax dollars for dimented jerks to think they have power that they do not.
@Patrici15767099 These MSM morons have nothing else to do, they don't investigate, most stories gthey don't even do anything to know if it is true or not.
@DFBHarvard Pelosi unaware Article 2 Section 3 of our Constitution.  We know she does not know how to read, Remember BOCARE.  Now she either wants to be dictator as she sent Democrats home today without passing bill to pay workers, &amp; fund poor, or her alcohol soaked brain is into dimentia.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution gives complete authority to the President to convene both houses of Congress whenever he wants to do so.  She is either thinking of becoming our dictator, or her alcohol soaked brain that tax payers charged $60,000 is into dimentia.
@charliekirk11 @AOC Forgive that is funny what a mess she would make, &amp; they would probably kill her, because the people know how horrible what she is blabbing is.  They are nearly dying from it.
@HuntsmanAbby Why not they do what we are paying them to do.  Pelosi sent Democrats home today, pulled bill to pay the people not getting paid, &amp; fund the poor, &amp; what she attempted with @POTUS was against Article 2 Section 3 of our Constitution.  She either wants to rule or is into dimentia.
@wytv And ice on roads.
@BretBaier Tell that know it all speaking now that Pelosi is violating the Constituti9on, Article 2 Section 3, which for sure that ditz never read.  We do not see @realDonaldTrump A KING.  We see him as being able to run this horrible mess in D. C.

@DavidLimbaugh Pelosi just pulled the bill off the floor today that would pay the workers who are not getting paid, &amp; told the Democrats to go home.  What is she doing?  Taking over this Nation, she is already attempting to dictate to @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Why did Pelosi pull the Bill to pay the people not getting paid off the floor today &amp; send Democrats home.  What is she doing.  Does she want to take over our Nation?

@RobWittman @sisalgirl @SpeakerPelosi Those votes were on paying the workers.  Is she attempting to take over this Nation?
@DavidLimbaugh @POTUS has the constitutional right to convene both Houses of Congress, Article 2, Section 3.   Speaker has no authority.  We know she can't read, dumb as dirt, but this is horrible, &amp; so many ignorant attorneys have not read the Constitution like Judge Nap. &amp; blabber bull.
@RealJamesWoods Does not have to, Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution gives President right to convene both houses of Congress.  Speaker has no power under Constitution.  We know she does not read, ignorant as dirt is she not?
@BretBaier Glad you are well, &amp; back.  Bless you.
@BretBaier Democrats just voted down paying the employees that they were voting on today.  Who is kidding who here, &amp; @POTUS has Constitution Right to convene both houses of Congress Article 2, Section 3.  We know Pelosi does not read, thus, ignorance evidently is her excuse.

@realDonaldTrump Know you get @charliekirk11 tweets, but he is correct.  Article 2 Section 3 of Constitution allows President the right to convene both Chambers of Congress under our Constitution.  Judge Napolitano wrong again.  We know Pelosi does not read.
@GOPLeader Pelosi did not have the right to do what she pulled today.  Article 2 Section 3 of the Constitution blocks her from doing that.  We know she did not read BOCare, so it is probable she never looked at the Constitution.  Dummies doing the work of the people.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Pelosi is violating Article 2, Section 3 of our Constitution.  She does not have this right, that is why no one has ever done this, because they read the constitution.  That ditz never read BOCare, can't expect her to read the Constitution.
@seanhannity President already has the right to override this in Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution.  Pelosi is not working for we the people who are paying her, she is working for power, Democrat control freak nonsense, &amp; it has to stop.
@newtgingrich Article 2 Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution prevents this criminal control freak pandering to political parties rather than doing the work of ther people Speaker Pelosi from doing what she just did.  She is committing TREASON against the Constitution.
@LisaMarieBoothe PELOSI is violating the Constitution.  She has NO right to do that, read Article 2 Section 3, &amp; I am sure there are other citations in our Constitution that prevent this lying control freak Speaker from doing this.
@RCamposDuffy @AOC @SenSanders There is no food.  This is horrible.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Read the Constitution Article 2, Section 3.  She is violating our LAW &amp; should be cited for treason.
@seanhannity Article 2 Section 3 give the President the right to convene both houses of the CONGRESS.  ENOUGH of this, we did NOT elect that corrupt, criminal Democrat party to control this Nation.  We elected @realDonaldTrump as our President.
@seanhannity Pelosi does not have that authority over the President.  She should be brought up on IMPEACHMENT as she is basically with her buddy Cryin Schbumer harming this Nation,
@IvankaTrump I have walked on the street where all those poor people are running.  God Please Help these people.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump That Judge Nap is wrong as usual.  Pelosi does not have authority to do this.  This is a treasonous act.  She does not belong in our Congress, the People's House.  Don't have my books, but in my mind, as I studied Constitutional LAW, I knew Judge Napolitano was wrong.  Thank you.
@Jamierodr10 I know where they are, I've been there.  God please help these people.
@LisaMarieBoothe I think your short Judge Nap is wrong.  There is no precedent for this, as it has never happened before.  As usual he just blabbers to hear himself.  I do not think PELOSI has this power, but I have not researched this.  Believe Constitutional scholars are needed to answer this.
@johnrobertsFox @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump i THINK CONSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGEABLE LAWYERS should find where she has this right?   No way should one elected politician from a small district in the USA be able to do this to the President who was elected by over 63 million peiople.
@GOPLeader PELOSI the control freak jealous Speaker of our House that we pay for, DEFIES @POTUS ?  A hateful control freak in the Speaker's position CAN DO THIS?  This is HISTORIC in a horrible way, actually no way should an elected person from a District in USA, be able to do this.

@newtgingrich WHY, she hates &amp; is insanely jealous of @realDonaldTrump .  From listening to Democrats many seem to be thinking people, but PELOSI marches to the parasite drum.  She lives off us, she obstructs the work of our Government, &amp; sadly she remains.  WHAT does that tell you?

@charliekirk11 PELOSI &amp; SCHUMER.  That is the only ones so far to do this.  IMPEACH both of them.
@darreldrowland You are wrong, there is NO Defiance, @POTUS accepted Pelosi's invitation to give the State of the Union Speech on Tuesday.  Now if she has a fart caught cross wise, she can boycott the speech.  Rep. Denny Hoyer will do an excellent job replacing her.

@OutnumberedFNC That is a GREAT idea, have an EMPTY CHAIR behind the President.  Harpf has to chip in, &amp; I believe they are getting paid, check on that.  Harpf only knows the talking points.  Sorry, could not remember her name.
@OutnumberedFNC Big Mouth Blondie is not correct on the Supreme Court &amp; amnesty.
@OutnumberedFNC @HARRISFAULKNER Hoyer just said they have passed a bill that has 1.3 Billion in it to secure the border, that is not GOOD FAITH in any way shape or form.  That is stubborn control freak jealousy.
@OutnumberedFNC @POTUS did take the word "WALL" out, but is that not childish on the part of that Democrat bunch?  Certain areas need border security in walls that will hold back invaders.
@OutnumberedFNC Mr. Theismann is correct, Schumer as always lies, no offer has been made in BAD FAITH, but PELOSI is attempting to DICTATE.
@OutnumberedFNC What a wonderful man, &amp; you be careful @HARRISFAULKNER with those rings.

@GOPChairwoman @LadyRedWave @realDonaldTrump PELOSI performed an IMPEACHABLE act by dictating to @POTUS &amp; Schumer &amp; Pelosi pander to a jealous control freak political Democrat party, not to the work of the people who are paying them.  That should be expunged criminal Democrat party does not pay them.
@SebGorka That young teenager did not have to apologize to a man beating a drum in his face with vulgarities of horrid speech being shouted at him.  Believe all of the protesters were routine D.C. highly paid protesters, &amp; they get paid perks for showing up on TV.
@trish_regan The top 2% of the people wealth wise pay over 80% of taxes.  This dumb ditz that is getting so much attention does not know much about anything.

@AmericaNewsroom What is HOYER blabbing about, they are working, &amp; evidently pay checks are going out.  1.5 billion is NOT what @POTUS needs to secure border &amp; keep our people safe.  Democrats quit playing control freak political party crap games We elected &amp; pay people not party
@SenJohnKennedy No, Senator, Pelosi is DICTATING to @POTUS that is grounds for IMPEACHMENT.  She is paid by we the tax payers, not her stinking control freak political jealous Democrat party.  And she is blocking the work of the people to protect &amp; keep alive the people.  This is WRONG.

@ABC PELOSI is DICTATING to @POTUS That is an IMPEACHABLE ACT.  Pelosi should be under impeachment.  @GOPLeader is correct.  This is not the Democrat States of America, it is the United States of America, stop party control freaks.  We did not elect a party, we elected a person.

@realDonaldTrump @AnthemRespect How Hill &amp; her putrid political party orchestrated this was RICO law violations of MOB attempts to control the FBI.  This is the way factions destroy Nations.

@realDonaldTrump @AnthemRespect @FoxNews I believe this is what @jsolomonReports was reporting last evening on @seanhannity   Hillary had her MOB, &amp; this activity is MOB activity, &amp; RICO laws should be applicable.
@barmore27 @Jamierodr10 @CDNnow PELOSI dictating @POTUS either open government, or NO negotiations on the crises of invasion of crime &amp; death on our border, ? maybe. PELOSI should be brought up on IMPEACHEMENT.  Not doing the work of the people which the people pay her to do. NOT Democrat political party.
@realDonaldTrump @Gumball55668882 PELOSI should not be dictating to you, &amp; SCHUMER refusing to discuss this crises of invasion of crime &amp; death into our Nation.  Both should be brought up on IMPEACHMENT proceedings immediately.
RT @WRB1956: @POTUS20251 @BillDargel Go figure fucking Democrats https://t.co/7Lh9wBAibD
@rosedixontx @fortressfin PELOSI now thinks herself so powerful, she is a DICTATOR, demanding to open the government &amp; maybe they will discuss the invasion &amp; threats to our Nation at our Border, &amp; SCHUMER refuses to negotiate to resolve the crises.  Both not dong the work of the people.  IMPEACH BOTH.
@eavesdropann @Farberyanki @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Democrats have had free rides for lies for decades.  Now PELOSI thinks herself a DICTATOR, &amp; SCHUMER refuses to negotiate &amp; do the work of the people which both were elected to do.  IMPEACH BOTH SCHUMER &amp; PELOSI.
@GOPChairwoman @JaniceWeinstei3 @realDonaldTrump Political Parties do not GOVERN, the people voters elected CANDIDATES to Govern.  PELOSI thinks she is a dictator, &amp; SCHUMER refuses to work for the people.  Both should be IMPEACHED.
@John_KissMyBot Both should be IMPEACHED.  Enough, the House was elected to solve CRISES not to create them, &amp; this action on the part of Pelosi &amp; Schumer are creating a control freak by stubborn political party that no one elected to govern our Nation.  We do not elect political parties,
@senatemajldr  IMPEACH dictator PELOSI, just heard SCHUMER, not doing the work of the people by insulting you &amp; refusing to talk about invasion of our Nation, maybe IMPEACH him too.  Enough of this, it is not how this Nation was founded. Political Parties DO NOT GOVERN or CONTROL
@TrussElise @gatewaypundit They are going to @WhiteHouse  to meet @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump Hill;s mob gong to the FBI with made up &amp; orchestrated reports to the FBI.   RICO is definitely now applying, if they are doing this investigation properly.
@realDonaldTrump Did you hear @jsolomonReports on Hannity last night.  How Hillary &amp; her mob of criminals got those FISA reports to the Judges was bother the daylights out of the FBI so that the FBI would investigate what Steele was blabber, which was a lie paid for by Hill &amp; ...
@realDonaldTrump PELOSI should be IMPEACHED.  She is Speaker not DIctator.  Negotiations should be most important thing she does to resolve the conflict, but instead she blackmails, OPEN the Government &amp; maybe we will discuss the invasion of crime &amp; drugs into our Nation.  DICTATOR not Rep.
@BretBaier TRUE, #CountyourBlessings always, no matter what.  The Lord saw a good man with a beautiful family, &amp; brought angels on Earth to help.  That could have been tremendously worse.  So glad, &amp; THANK YOU DEAR LORD.
@DiamondandSilk That is good.  These young teenagers did nothing wrong, actually I am sure those who were hearing thise ugly threats were afraid.
@GovMikeHuckabee @PressSec @realDonaldTrump Governor you are correct, It is a waste of time for these press conferences, because the Press Secretary is besieged with the same question over &amp; over. Do these media morons not listen to what others are asking or are they so involved with their own EGO, no one else is there.
@EricTrump TRUE, ignorance fears change for the better, for sadly their negative, uninformed attitudes onlyi tell them it will get worse.
@LisaMarieBoothe Bigger lesson is to stop this ridiculous protesting, every lunatic in this Nation must have got on the payroll for protesting &amp; those young teenagers who were assaulted &amp; threatened by the lunatics &amp; MSM should be under arrest &amp; sued for trillions of dollars.
@POTUS   Pelosi should be IMPEACHED, she is demanding rather than negotiating.  That is a DICTATOR.  Hitler demanded, &amp; then killed you.  Typical control freak Democrat political party.  Not good. https://t.co/xBbfYKh4GE
@ABCPolitics PELOSI should be IMPEACHED.  She is demanding without negotiating, that makes her a DICTATOR.  That is what Hitler did.  You will do what I say &amp; then maybe we will talk about this.  SURE.

@RandPaul Find out how much that American Indian was being paid, Kavanaugh protestors were all paid some as high as $1,500.00 a day, this is beyond reprehensible, also shows how very stupid MEDIA is &amp; how little they do with regard to what they think is news worthy.

@LadyRedWave @gatewaypundit Never forget that many of those people in D. C. are paid up to $1500 a day to protest.  Those young people from the Catholic High School were there because they believed in Right to Life, how much was that  American Indian being paid?  &amp; what was he marching for, did he know?
@realDonaldTrump Don't care, Professional Football has turned into libtard nonsense, &amp; now evidently Gladys Knight is getting death threats because she is singing the Star Spangled Banner.  Don't care, will never watch again.

@realDonaldTrump This just happened.  Plow trucks have not plowed side streets, &amp; an elderly lady her car would not go thru the heavy snow, she was stuck.  People came out of their homes about 6 of them, one had a tow wrench, he hooked it up, got her out.  So Proud to be an American. Good People
@GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump Yes @POTUS definitely has, &amp; the people want a secure border, drugs stopped from permeating the entire Nation, and Walls where needed.  Too bad Pelosi &amp; Schumer think they can dictate their stubborn attitudes on we the people.
@marklevinshow @realDonaldTrump Pelosi &amp; Schumer are not in their moron mind PUBLIC SERVANTS.  They want to entrap @POTUS into calling a National Emergency, which is reprehensible on their part.  The people of this Nation want ther border secure, drugs not here, &amp; walls where needed.
@VP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I actually got angry at those questions Wallace was asking you.  Our Border must be secure, what @POTUS proposed is more than fair, &amp; will do the necessary job that must be done to protect our people.  You were wonderful on that show today.  Thank you Sir.
@senrobportman @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Rob Portman is an excellent public servant.  He is from my State of Ohio, many of us retweeted this, as it was excellent.  All who love our Nation must work as Senator Portman to bring this stalemate on the part of Democrat control freaks to an END.  Our Border must be SECURE.
@WKBN Will it be clear?  Secondly, people in my area are really good people.  An elderly lady was on the road, but the road had not been plowed yet in Austintown, she was really stuck.  People came out from their homes, helped her get straight, &amp; she went on her way.  That was so nice.
@realDonaldTrump Agree, MEDIA, Journalism, et al. are into POWER &amp; CONTROL where they do not belong.  Think their opinion more important that reporting actual news, which NOW is Democrat Party demanding CONTROL over we the people, &amp; Media facilitating this with their constant hammering of you.

@marklevinshow Special Counsel Mueller doing this, gave him more respect, because the people are so sick of this constant hammering our @POTUS with LEFTIST  lies, &amp; lunacy, as really the MSM is mental.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Leftist Lunatic Liars.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump I see Pelosi as attempting to push @POTUS into declaring a National Emergency.  The Wall where necessary will be built &amp; our border finally SECURE, but sadly none of the good will  happen for DACA, which is sad.  And this is typical control freak bully Democrat crap.
@JohnCornyn I love @DanaPerino but I see Pelosi who is probably very angry her drunken trip was canceled, as attempting to push our @POTUS into declaring a National Emergency.  Then nothing good will happen, but the Wall will be secured &amp; where necessary built. Typical Democrat CRAP
@JohnCornyn HATRED, &amp; thinking have regained POWER which the people of this Nation took away, &amp; then sadly did not pay attention, now we struggle with the control freak Democrats.  Control freaks are bullies, Hitlarian, "you will do what I say", &amp; they are obstructing as much as they can
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump If our borders secured, judges specific appointed to clear through these back logs of immigration cases, NO.  They won't be able to INVADE ILLEGALLY, as they have been.  @POTUS specifically set out excellent funding to stop this.
@seanhannity Honestly I see the drunk who spends thousands on alcohol for her trips on the tax payers, I see her forcing @POTUS to declare a National Emergency, which would allow the obstructionist Democrats to vomit their crap over &amp; over &amp; over again.
@seanhannity My sister buried Friday.  What I heard from people at the funeral was they did not like Trump, but they liked what he was doing.  I questioned what don't you like.  He is honest, he is successful, he knows how to run big operations, which all should be good for the USA. AGREED
@JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Good Show @JudgeJeanine .  You know Pelosi is attempting to push @POTUS into declaring a National Emergency so she can blabber more of her drunken stupidity.
@AnnaApp91838450 @BreitbartNews SNL no one watches except the most ignorant, &amp; probably by the time it is on most drunk.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Pelosi was vomiting she did not agree with @POTUS before he even spoke, she must have thought his going to meet our fallen was his speak.  Tells me she was too busy drinking.
@POTUSPress Pelosi wants a drunken vacation on the tax payers, while there are those who did not get the February food stamp allowance as reported, so our poor possibly elderly will go hungry.  Pelosi should be arrested for stealing from the poor.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, TRUE., Pelosi blocking your offer before you even spoke. She is NOT doing the work of the Speaker, she should not be paid. Her pay should go to those who did not get food stamps as reported for February, she wants drunken party on the TAX PAYERS, &amp; poor go hungry, next month
@realDonaldTrump Honestly, believe this old woman is bent on forcing you to declare a National Emergency.  GAMES do not belong in Government, &amp; TAX PAYERS should rescind those who do not attempt to solve &amp; only obstruct, RESCIND their wages.

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Media has to shut up with their opinion, this is an excellent law to completely secure our border, help our DACA completely, save many lives, &amp; eventually bring down the horrid expense.  Senators, Reps. &amp; @POTUS are who we pay to lead us, make our laws, &amp; only ones to resolve.
@senrobportman @POTUS But Democrat leaders &amp; MEDIA seem to be attempting to push @POTUS to declare an emergency.  Did you hear what Chuckie said.  How old is he? 2 or 100?
@LindseyGrahamSC Agree, but already Schumer is doing is laughing resistance bit.  It would be best if MEDIA shut their mouths.  Senator, Representatives &amp; @POTUS are the only people involved ion solving this.  MEDIA aggravates ridiculous power struggle.  Pushing President to emergency.
@cvpayne They are forcing the President to call an emergency, &amp; laughing about it.  That party should be EXPUNGED.  Formed the KKK to kill our slaves, when they lost the Civil War, &amp; now they will do their bit to show how much POWER they have.
@ABCPolitics @karentravers Hopefully your viewers heard what @POTUS said.  We are an educated Nation, do not need your interpretations sadly are very biased.    Senators, Representativers, &amp; our President are paid to do the work of the people., MEDIA opinions should be flushed.
@POTUSPress @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer You are saying that Democrats have no minds of their own, that they do not represent their people, whom I am sure many have been harmed by this southern border invasion we have suffered for years.  Political Hacks don't belong being paid by tgaxpayers.
@senrobportman @POTUS First of all Senator, the expense to our Nation, not only financxial but the lives of our young people.  This proposal calls for better screening of illegal drugs coming into our Nation.  Certainly many Democrats are Americans, not party hacks, &amp; will realize the horrid costs.
@seanhannity Media paying too much attention to this clown.  What @POTUS said has been said by that clown before.What on EARTH, Chuckie into dimentia, NOT scum POWER,  This is the lives of our children, our people, the drugs, the horrid expense, it is costing all of us.
@senrobportman And it would be wonderful if all those so called journalists would keep their opinion to themselves.  Let those we have el;ected solve this because none of them know what they are talking about.  WE know the problem.  It is up to whom we have elected to solve as soon as possible.
@realDonaldTrump Excellent.  What would be best is that those the people have elected Reps. Senators, &amp; you be the only people who voice opinions.  I am sick &amp; tired of this constant immediate criticism, like they know what they are talking about, which obviously they do not.

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Geraldo, this FAKE NEWS is treasonous.  Evidently for money, they promote TREASON.  FACTIONS of money think they can topple @POTUS through lies.  Comcast, &amp; Time Warner are evidently behind this.  Time to scream to have them eliminated from our cables.
@realDonaldTrump They are organization TREASON.
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Democrats formed the KKK, &amp; look what happened to Abraham Lincoln.  Then far fewer traitors as now, most on that level are so stupid they don't see that you are standing for we the people, not political parties, not special interests, or terrorist organizations like KKK.
@realDonaldTrump As I said buried my sister yesterday, this is TREASON.  Loved what @marklevinshow Levin said last night on @seanhannity.  Mark is a legal scholar.  Victoria Toensing's husband DeGenova I believe his name, he too is correct.  Mueller was told to clarify.

@realDonaldTrump When these drunken Democrats were claiming no terrorists are coming thru our unprotected border, saw this nightmare, frightening. Look what happened in Syria, they blow themselves up &amp; take us with them.  Also check expense of Democrat alcohol to tax payers.
@AmericaNewsroom @SpeakerPelosi @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox The drunk Pelosi wrote @POTUS to postpone, &amp; @POTUS rightly stated that our tax dollars could not be used for frivolous meet &amp; greet political trips, which recently posted Pelosi's last whatever this expensive nonsense is, the alcohol charge for that bunch was over $60,000.

@seanhannity @chilllingwithme Sean, NO WAY should tax payers be shackled with over a $60,000 bill for alxohol for Pelosi orgies.  NO WAY.  She is a horrid expense to tax payers, right now she &amp; her fellow orgy politicians are grounded, &amp; we save money.
@glennyork @MZHemingway @C_3C_3 @SteveScalise @IngrahamAngle @PeteHegseth @newtgingrich He is saving the tax payers over $50,000 just in their alcohol costs for this campaign meet &amp; greet.  Personally paying for Democrat orgies I do not think falls on the tax payers.  @POTUS his entire life has been bothered by politicians, he knows exactly what they do.  Love him.

@BlazeTV Did you see what Pelosi's last drunken orgy cost the tax payers just in alcohol cost, over $60,000.  Why are the tax payers shackled with her drunken orgy crap?  This is a political meet &amp; greet, that is a political expense of campaign committees, not of the tax payers. @POTUS
@nytimes You mean in NYC, DC &amp; Goofeywood , California, RIGHT?
@SebGorka Why are tax payers paying for drunken political meet &amp; greets, that is not what our tax dollars should be paying.  Pelosi's last so called meet &amp; greet just the alcohol cost was over $60,000.  How many drunks does she take on these nonsense expensive trips?
@jerome_corsi @gatewaypundit Well she sure spends our tax dollars on alcohol for her orgies.  Over $60,000 on her last political trip to meet &amp; greet on the tax payers.  Why should tax payers be paying for that?

@ABC I think it completely a waste of our tax dollars for the expense of these political meet &amp; greet trips.  Alcohol in Pelosi's last drunken orgy cost the tax payers $60,000.  Why do tax payers have to pay for their alcoholism?  @POTUS
@mschlapp That soundrd to me like a campaign meet &amp; greet trip, that we the taxpayers pay.  Pelosi's last alcohol bill to the tax payers on one of her so called 7 day on us trip with her alcoholic buddies just alcohol cost over $60,000.  WHY do taxpayers have to pay for this crap?

@SteveScalise What, they have no back bone, that a stupid ditz whom I believe is bordering on dimentia, like Pelosi keeps them from listening &amp; perhaps working to find a solution.  That is ridiculous,   This nation did not make Pelosi anything, fools elected her Speaker.  So WHAT?
@Sissy4Trump @HLAurora63 Too busy stealing our tax dollars doing NOTHING or spending our tax dollars on their stupid garbage trips to Puerto Rico with the medical supplies that we evidently shipped to that island also at tax payers expense.  Democrats are very EXPENSIVE to the tax payers.

@RepMarkMeadows Haven't you figured this out, Democrats don't care about the people, only their stinking divisionary political party.  And the party wants the CONTROL, so they now have it in our House, thus our Nation comes to a complete stop.
@seanhannity Another ignorant ideological moron.  You realize that only in N.Y,.C., D.C. &amp; Goofeywood California is this divisionary dogma preached to the evidently uneducated moron citizens of those three areas.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Self-named Obama put as many as he could, &amp; frankly if we never elected that whomever he was as our President, we would not be struggling right now.  That whomever caused this horrid divide, &amp; it is not by race, it is by ignorant ideology.
@KatrinaPierson Democrats believe have power to control, with no thought whatsoever for the people, the poor who will lose their food stamps for February if not compromised tomorrow,.  AGREE Democrats are the cause of this, as they concern themselves only for their stinking party.
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity @FoxNews I heard you.  Now what is going to happen, evidently food stamps will be discontinued tomorrow which is what Counties have been told.  Yes, a lot of illegals may not get their food stamps, but a lot of poor Americans too.  I know food stamps dropped, but not that much.
@SteveScalise Do whatever you can without the old control freaks.  Certainly there are elected Democrats that concern themselves with the wants of the people, not that political party that now thinks itself powerful enough to topple our President, because that is what they are doing.

@seanhannity Proved that this moron is extremely ignorant.  Unbelievable &amp; Acosta gets paid for his stupidity.  You realize that the COSTS invaders levy upon tax payers just taking care of their children would build a wall over &amp; over again.  Medical alone would build the wall.

@seanhannity Sean, horrid cost to take care of these children, that alone would pay for the wall over &amp; over again.  Also TB again, Polio again, &amp; other horrid infections that we make sure our children do not suffer.  EXPENSE is beyond belief, why don't you tell what cost to tax payers is?

@ABC Good, they should go &amp; clean it up, they are getting paid by the tax payers right now.  Is that beneath their stinking butts?  Are they too good to clean up trash?  Frankly these obstructionists if they do not agree to a wall where necessary &amp; border security should be IMPEACHED.
@RealJamesWoods ABSOLUTELY.  Without question.  Sick of tweedle dee, Schumer &amp; his lies, &amp; tweedle dimented dumb Pelosi who blabbers nonsense usually.  Frankly all Democrats who oppose securing our border with a Wall where needed should be IMPEACHED.  They are not doing the work of the people,.
@AmericaNewsroom @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @cvpayne @cvpayne is brilliant.  At least we have some intelligence on your station.  Some of your guests just blabber talking points saying nothing resulting in nothing.
@magagary687 @Dawn_DeMore1 @SenSchumer Schymer, tweedle dee with tweedle dimented dumb lied.  No one banged their fist on anything, Kruschev banged his show, but that was at the United Nations.
@JessieJaneDuff @Patrici15767099 Pelosi is a using, conniving, sadly now dimented dummy.
@senrobportman Yes, &amp; the spouse of a police officer murdered by an INVADING ILLEGAL, should also know that we will stop this criminal INVADERS from now on.  Build that WALL.
@IvankaTrump @POTUS Obviously Democrats have NO concern about our murdered police officers.  Democrats want their way or NO WAY.  That is not Government of the people.  IMPEACH every Democrat that does not have any concern for we the people, the tax payers, &amp; VICTIMS of these horrible INVASIONS..
@BarrettJim1 @TheRealSusanA1 They looked like tweedle dumb &amp; tweedle dee to me.  DEE Schumer lied immediately, &amp; DUMB dimented sounded like a drama queen.
@AmericaNewsroom No one trusts this man, which is sad.  &amp; the loner Mueller &amp; his minions continue, our Justice will be under horrible scrutiny.
@GovBrewer @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @realDonaldTrump Your law suit supports securing our Border.  Courts state it is the job of FEDERAL Government to secure, President wants it, &amp; we the tax payers want it, dump those idiot polls, no reason or sense to them.  The entire Nation including 2 parts of our Gov't want our border SECURE.
@AmericaNewsroom @robertwolf32 @BlakemanB @johncbussey @NYCMayor Hope NYC tax payers are ready to foot the bill for this.
@AmericaNewsroom Schumer wqho lied last night, &amp; Dimented Pelosi speaking with furloughed non essential tax paid workers, has little to do with the deaths of our police, our young people, &amp; horrid expense to tax payers.

@AmericaNewsroom @TomPerez @BillHemmer This was just more of the blabber Democrats vomit whenever any of you interview them.  Nothing NEW here at all, they are not only obstructionists but putrid stagnating elements in our government aka worthless that is why I call them parasites.
@seanspicer @UnTamedInSD @marcthiessen @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Schumer LIED, &amp; Pelosi as always a dimented drama queen with the women &amp; children, all of whom we take care of.  She too LIED.
@marklevinshow Moron Media LIE, blatantly  Surveys, all over 80% with 10s of thousands participating for Wall &amp; @POTUS .  Even Fox had a lie on with Survey.  That is hopeless as far as believing them, &amp; Schumer's first statement was a LIE last night..
@marklevinshow They blatantly LIE.  On those surveys, overwhelmingly people vote with @POT
@realDonaldTrump Where is moron media getting these surveys, everyone &amp; there have been many that I have answered all favor a Wall, &amp; your humanitarian way of stopping this horrible nightmare at our southern border.  They LIE.

@GenophiliaLoves @TheRealSusanA1 Not as bad as San Francisco.
@RepMarkMeadows @TheRealSusanA1 Democrats stagnate, they are very ignorant people.  One track minds, know nothing about the horrible problem, the horrid expense, &amp; how tax payers are being bankrupted by this.
@ABC She is so dumb, we are affording women &amp; children, an illegal child, cost of $70,000 to help, that expense is plus on the tax payers, women many pregnant, bigger expense on tax payers,all are cared for.  Pelosi so stupid, so dimented, thinks boohooing about children way to go.
@CharlieDaniels That is all these obstructionist parasites in our Congress have, because they certainly have no concern about the people of this Nation.

@NBCNews You do not want a WALL because all those hyperbolic messes you employ will have something to do.  Selfish, dangerous to we the people, &amp; outright ignorant.  The people want WALL.  Media, Lying, cheating Democrats, et al. need this for evidently their sick way of making a living.
@Scavino45 And it is time in our History to stop this horrible nearly bankrupting expense, &amp; killing that could be easily corrected by a barrier that stops this, yet, allows those who legally apply to come into our Nation.

@RepAOC VOTE to SECURE our BORDER with whatever needed to do so, not hyperbolic bull.  No one banked their fist, Schumer lied,as always TRUTH is buried through drama queens.  That worker will get their pay.  Compromise.  Influence Sanders to Vote to Secure Border with WALL where needed.

NO, that does not happen, the wealthy become the governing, still have the wealth, the people still starve
@realDonaldTrump Perhaps many in that IMPOTENT Congress did not know that, but when you announced, I knew you were correct.  You have GREAT power, &amp; you are using it for the people, no self serving in anything you do, which is pathetic that you have to endure such stupidity in DemocRATS.

@realDonaldTrump Frankly every stinking NEW DemocRAT that beat out a Republican, that election should be under investigation.  Voter Fraud is REAL, it has been used for a LONG TIME TO MAKE DemocRATS winners. Is there an HONEST police agency Federally?  Perhaps the Secret Service?
@michellemalkin @Jed42253333 @SpeakerPelosi House stands ALONE now.  No matter what, nothing is going to happen, unless they realize that the people of this Nation want that wall, &amp; are sick of the crap of the DemocRATS.  Enough

@POTUSPress Congress should not be paid until border security is funded.  No more sick children coming into our Nation bringing sickness, No more criminals, No more babies being born here.  ENOUGH.
@POTUSPress Pelosi sounded actually stupid I believe on NBC when she said border security was not a Wall.  A drone is good for what?  Keep tweeting, ignore the ignorance, &amp; know that the people will not permit much of this crap anymore.  Nikki Haley said as I did, Congress should NOT be paid
@SarahPalinUSA THIS woman is insane. She is obsessed with power, goofy.  Said "No Wall" at least 6 times.  As stupid as she is, she thinks that is not good border security, yet, she has one around that castle she lives in in San Francisco.  Aesthetic I guess.

@POTUSPress @realDonaldTrump You are correct, it certainly angers many of us, liars are the scum of the Earth, &amp; they for some reason think we are so ignorant that we believe them.  Merry Christmas, &amp; glad I follow POTUS Press, it is the BEST.

@WashTimes to me this is beyond an embarrassment as you state, it is criminal, &amp; Schumer should be held liable.  He not only KILLED his own baby, but the young woman carrying his baby.  Schumer is the sewer scum of the earth. https://t.co/py57NNLkoE
@WashTimes When Schumer has a young lover who gets pregnant, pays for her abortion, she kills herself, @POTUSPress , hope that slush fund for pervert parasites in our Congress was not used for the abortion, how could any of the riff raff be embarrassed???????
@JessieJaneDuff @sxdoc @harpersbazaarus There is NO comparison.  @FLOTUS Melania looks exquisite, Michelle looks like can't say it, but she is poured into that mess she has on.

@NBCNews @CNBC So, it is beyond anything thought possible right now.  What are they complaining about, can't make more billions????????????

@realDonaldTrump DemocRAT pandering parasites never believe in what they say, only in getting that tax paid pay check.  It is horrible,  That is not working for the WILL of their people, but for the damage some corrupt political party can push.
@realDonaldTrump Has been a "modus operandi" for decades, prior to your election.  We were being HAD so to speak, with smiling leaders shaking our hands &amp; stealing from us.  ENOUGH, we will always help if we can, but not to the demise of so many of our young fine people, or dwindling of our FUNDS
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan It would be to Turkey's advantage to do that, because this endless bickering, killing, swarming for thousands of years is harmful to the growth of strong people.  It keeps them in a constant weakened position.
@realDonaldTrump The  @SteveHiltonx Show is one of the BEST programs on Fox.  Could be his knowledge of World events is far superior to other commentators.   And @HeyTammyBruce is one of the most intelligent women on TV.
@realDonaldTrump Anyone with any intelligence at all, knows that.  Sadly, DemocRATS only know conrol freak POWER,  look at how they are tip toeing with that stupid Pelosi.  Wow, she must run our Legislature.  REALLY, than our votes for people to do our WIL:L were WASTED.
@realDonaldTrump Or EXPUNGE end forever that corrupt criminal cheating DemocRAT bunch who got us into the horrid messes you have been correcting.  TWO years is not that long, but great damage could be done.  DemocRATS began KKK, killed our freed black Americans, &amp; harmful regulations hurting USA.
@realDonaldTrump I worked for Nixon in D.C.  @senatemajldr is correct, these last two years, the work of the people is being done FINALLY.  Now we will suffer with TWO more years of crap, I would purge the Boards of Election.  The smart traders see we are going into that crap again.  No one wins,
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Very True.  WHY, when one faction overtook another, WHY would the USA step in, we are self sufficient, for a while we had to feed those gas hogs everyone was driving, so had to play their ruthless games, but not any more.  We love our Soldiers.
@realDonaldTrump @RandPaul Never ENDING, thousands of years,  beyond understanding, or belief.  Hymn: "Let there be PEACE on EARTH, &amp; let it begin with me."  Impossible when tribes squabbles will NEVER cease.  Afghanistan Mountains will full with tribes, Syria tribes continue fight.  USA HOME.
@realDonaldTrump It should be an honor &amp; privilege to serve, but in doing so, they should be serving the WILL of the people, not their personal opinions, which both Flake, &amp; Corker have done.  That is insurrection, &amp; does not help this Nation at all.
@RandPaul @Mrs_Malindo Senator:  First Merry Christmas.  &amp; Schumer made that perfectly clear, when his Hitler EGO stated to @POTUS "forget your Wall" THUS, it is Schumer's EGO that is preventing this Bill passing in the Senate.  That is HORRIBLE, that some little Caesar Schumer wants to CONTROL.
@_realBlackTrump @SEAAdams2 @realDonaldTrump Because they agree with what @realDoanldTramp states, only the insane &amp; idiots of our Nation comment as so few of them do, which is good.  The likes outweigh any of those moron comments.  Believe @POTUS wants us to know how very ignorant some are in our Nation.
@GOP @PressSec Caught 10 terrorists a week or two ago.  This is dangerous, &amp; SCHUMER is INSANE.  He is so egotistical that he no matter what will OVERPOWER our @POTUS .  This is horrible that we permit insane people in our government.
@MariaBartiromo Ceciline is wasting your valuable time, everything he is saying is absurd..  Ceciline "get more done" bull.
@RepMarkMeadows It is aimed at @POTUS .  Schumer is INSANE, bordering on extreme treatment for EGO similar to that of Adolph Hitler.
@MariaBartiromo Now you have a blabbering idiot on, routine verbiage blabbering bull.  No solutions at all as it is ambiguous what l.6 billion, what is he talking about?DemocRATS are so ignorant, &amp; sadly seem not to be able to think for themselves, more blabber.

@foxnewsalert I think @MickMulvaneyOMB correct.  Schumer in his INSANE EGO seems to have to OVERPOWER @POTUS , nothing to do with the need of this WALL, but Schumer's power over our President.  This is SICK.
@senorrinhatch Elected officials are stating on TV that Pelosi is pulling the strings with Schumer.  WHAT is the Senate attempting to do, combine the two houses in our Legislative Branch.  What does she have to do with the Senate, &amp; Schumer is insanely determined to overpower our @POTUS
@JohnCornyn Schumer's EGO &amp; Pelosi crap is out of control.  It is a Power Struggle,. &amp; how does Pelosi influence the Senate?  You have combined the houses of government in the legislature now.  What is going on?
@realDonaldTrump Not sure if they said the 10 our Border Patrol picked up were from Afghanistan or not, I seem to recall that was the Country.  As I said put our troops there actively.  That is how we will be attacked, through our borders, by Jihadists.
@TheDona01531168 So Good.  Your card may be a little late, told me at the Post Office as it did not bend, would be considered a package at $3.50.  I put three stamps on it, &amp; mailed it.  Merry Christmas, have a wonderful Christmas @WhiteHouse , when did the last President there for Christmas.
@realDonaldTrump Did they not pick up 10 terrorists coming through a week or two ago?  Schumer should be made to have a psychiatric evaluation.  He is POWER HUNGRY.
@AndrewCMcCarthy Wrong about Jihadists living there, evidently they are picking up same at our Southern Border, so they don't ALL live there, but I think if a threat to this Nation, this @POTUS WILL STRONGLY DEFEND.  As I said, we would have to blow up all those mountains.
@Tribe1954 Socialism began with FDR, &amp; yes DemocRATS have moved very FAR into empty thought process, if it sounds good blab it &amp; all the ignorant people will believe you., but sadly many of us are gaining useful intelligence.
@JudgeJeanine @EvaLB5 @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz Did you hear what Schumer said:  He threatened @POTUS telling him he would NEVER get his WALL.

@ABC Frankly he would not have to recuse himself from overseeing that out of control very expensive, obstructing justice, special counsel.  Anyone on your staff have any legal background of any consequence?  Mueller is milking the tax payers.  Allegedly lost all texts, obstruction&gt;
@ChuckGrassley @rossr122 This is a POWER struggle with an insane old man named Schumer.  He is bordering on Dictatorship, especially what Schumer said on @foxandfriends this morning.  Schumer told @POTUS "he will NEVER get his WALL".  Does Schumer think he is Adolph Hitler?  Is that how the SENATE works?
@GovMikeHuckabee @LVNancy @realDonaldTrump Nothing to do with the WALL.  It is a POWER STRUGGLE, by a very mentally ill old man named Schumer.  Did you hear his comment on @foxandfriends this morning.  Told @POTUS "you will NEVER get your WALL".  That is as Hitler would state.  WHY, Hitler was a dictator.
@AMike4761 Schumer should be evaluated on the sanity clause of the Constitution.  Schumer is POWER hungry, my word, Hitlerian, because that is how Schumer is acting.  Should be made to go through a psychiatric evaluation, he is flaming CRAZY.
@IngrahamAngle Obama fired Mattis, a good military man.  Should not defame General Mattis, but @POTUS believes rightfully that our soldiers have fought &amp; died long enough for other Nations.  Our Nation is paramount, &amp; frankly station them on our border, till Schumer resigns deemed INSANE..
@POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC That insane Schumer did say this, out of his stinking mouth.  Can't that clause be used to overthrow his term in the Senate, he is power hungry like Hitler.  My word was always Hitlerian, &amp; Schumer definitely is that. https://t.co/zq6Zzauxru
@LindseyGrahamSC @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Can the Senate request psychiatric evaluation for their elected power grabbing effete snobs, &amp; medically throw them out of the Senate.  Can that clause FBI was attempting to use on @POTUS be used on nut case Senators?
@LindseyGrahamSC @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Wait until @JudgeJeanine hears what that stinking sewer swamp dweller Schumer threatened.  "@POTUS you will NEVER build that Wall"  How about that.  Did we appoint Schumer DICTATOR?
@LindseyGrahamSC Close to 20 million has been collected from we the people so far, Schumer seeks POWER has nothing to do with WALL.  He wants POWER, he said this morning, @POTUS you will never get your WALL.  What does that tell you?
@AndrewCMcCarthy Andy, we would have to destroy all those mountains in Afghanistan as that is where they live.  That could blow the EARTH off its AXIS, &amp; now, our soldiers are being randomly killed in that hell hole.  Think about it.  Taliban will exist as long as those people surrender to them.
@JaniceDean @ShannonBream Happy Birthday, Janice.
@realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with the WALL that all of us want, it is a POWER PLAY by a stinking sewer scum floater named Schumer, that is so reprehensible that one plus whatever can deny the people what they truly want.  Special Election with ID to vote.
@realDonaldTrump Why?  Their work not done. When Law Clerk there would be Christmases, I worked researching stare' decisis to WIN a case, &amp; we did.  Senate must think they are better than all the rest of us.  That is effete snobbery.
@realDonaldTrump Schumer intends to keep this government shut for years, until perhaps you are up for re=election.  SHUT DOWN Government,  That's what Sewer Swamp Schumer wants.  He said it.  Said you will NEVER get your Wall.  Fox &amp; Friends 12/23   Nation wants Wall, but sewer gas Schumer NO.
@realDonaldTrump The WALL is important to we the legal citizens of this Nation, to not just protect our sadly stupid children that are getting hooked on drugs, I lived it, because drugs pour over that border, &amp; it harms those who work in lesser paying jobs, &amp; they are millions.
@realDonaldTrump All BO appointments should be gone.  They were not public servants they are members of a cult out to destroy conservatives &amp; the USA.  And the BIG STINKING sewer swamp dweller SCHUMER does not care about a WALL he now thinks he is in a Power Struggle with you, &amp; will win.
@RudyGiuliani This has nothing to do with the WALL, nor working for the voters, all citizens legally of the United States.  It is a stinking sewer swamp POWER PLAY by the biggest STINK Schumer.

@GOP @StacyLStiles @GOPChairwoman Schumer shut it down for his girlfriend Pelosi who HAS TO BE THE SPEAKER.  Wow  Did you watch Fox this morning.
@LindseyGrahamSC Pelosi evidently won't let that moron Schumer vote for this.  WHAT are you little guys doing in your little pea brains, thinking about some bimbo getting the Speaker's position being more important than we the people being protected.  WOW.  This was on Fox,.
@therealcornett @USVet_Realist Shepherd Smith is hateful too, very &amp; caustic.  Thinks he is so smart, it is obvious.
@marklevinshow Roberts has done this before.
@ChuckGrassley Evidently Pelosi won't let that moron Schumer talk to @POTUS   Is she the box of the Congress?  Just reported this on Fox.  Stop this crap.  Represent we the people not some goofy bimbo  sadly elected by moron voter , who must be Speaker.  That is swindling we the people.
@senatemajldr WHY is Pelosi controling that moron SCHUMER?  WHAT does her being speaker have to do with our tax dollars?  Does she contribute the extra to buy her position as Speaker with the extra tax dollars she is paid as Speaker?  That is SWINDLING, is it not?
@POTUSPress TRUST @LouisGohmert This entire fiasco in that Congress of chatterboxes with no results is horrible costly to we the tax payers.  Now Pelosi is controling that idiot Schumer.  WHAT?  Her being speaker is more important than we the people not being shafted for these criminals?
@gatewaypundit Too bad he does not have to pay for this.  Must never have had to pay for nonsense, just paid for it without regret.  Horrible choice for our SCOTUS, definitely does not think of we the people of this Nation &amp; the HORRID EXPENSE this is to us &amp; our children &amp; adds to our DEBT.
@GreggJarrett Best show I have seen.  You never talk about yourself, you are an excellent host.  Loved the show.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS @FoxNews @seanhannity That is correct.  DemocRATS have no concern about we the people only their PARASITE PAY as Control Freaks, &amp; sadly their only goal is to control, no matter how, through blackmail, intimidation, lies, &amp; garbage.  We are living their modus operandi right now.
@SebGorka @POTUSPress Sad that these bigot Obama bums have no love of our Nation.  They are only in love with themselves &amp; their parasite pay.
@larryelder @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @POTUS is right to want to not only protect us from what is happening on our Southern Border, but keep the horrible costs surrounding same away from us, so that we might be able to balance our budge again.  When was the last time we did tha? NIXON?  DemocRATS care less about that
@CharlieDaniels Once my Christmas Eve was like that, no longer.  My husband was able to do as he threatened with his millions of dollars, made me a "walking dead person"  completely solo sadistic life.  You have a Merry Christmas,
@POTUSPress @BreitbartNews Pelosi gets paid more as Speaker, does she donate the money tax payers pay her so she can buy her way into that position.  Schumer is protecting Pelosi evidently, so she gets the extra money as Speaker.
@cspan Only one person is doing this, &amp; his name is SCHUMER.  Protecting Pelosi so she gets the extra money as Speaker.  This is so connived &amp; not the duty of an elected official.
@JaniceDean As long as prejudice, bigotry &amp; bull is permitted to fester in our Nation, discrimination even when you life is at stake will bring out the bigots.
@kilmeade @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump BO was absurd.  He was ignorant, he scammed the people, &amp; all the libtards wanted a black President, but we did not have a black American president, we had a fraud.  He was given a pass on everything.   We have so many fine black people would have been so great as President.
@WKBN omg.  That poor baby.Thank Heaven the baby was found.  Prayers for this tiny little innocent baby.
@BillOReilly My Dad died from this, he smoked horrible.  Painful, so she is either sustaining extreme pain, or is drugged against pain.  Either or, not good.
@senatemajldr https://t.co/WLnD1XJFDw
@JoeConchaTV Corker is nuts.
@RealWayneRoot My Dad died of this, he smoked so very much.  it is very painful.  I am praying for this lady.  I agree she should retire, she is very  ill.  &amp; I know she is in pain, or drugged against the pain.  Either or, not good.
@POTUSPress @donlemon BO did FIRE General Mattis.  Only because most media including Fox is sewer scump swamp dweller sewage DemocRAT is there even any conversation about this, &amp; General Mattis was NOT fired by @POTUS he resigned.
@cspan @senatemajldr Flake did his normal pin-headed crap.  People of 	Arizona should be ashamed of him;
@OutnumberedOT You have a mumbling fool on, does he know what he is talking about?  Only Rep. is Flake.  blabber, blabber, blabber
@OAD_Studios @superyayadize WORST PRESIDENT in the History of our Land, &amp; some fool names a freeway after that.
@WKBN My Dad died of that, very painful.  Prayers for that Lady.  Peace &amp; happiness from now on for her.
@ericbolling My Dad died of that, very painful.  She needs prayers now.  Let Happiness be the rest of her Life.
@KAG4All Bull crap.  That will be overturned, what is that one of BOs boys on that bench.
@WashTimes Right now, that lady needs our prayers.  My Dad died of that, very painful.
@HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews @papermagazine @ShannonBream @BretBaier @BillHemmer @marthamaccallum Love all you picture including you.  Merry Christmas to all of you, pictured.
@HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews @papermagazine @ShannonBream @BretBaier @BillHemmer @marthamaccallum Jessica Tarlov is a bitter person isn't she?  She monopolizes Outnumbered, just listen.
@WashTimes This Schumer has the mentality of a 2 year old, he is treating @POTUS like he is a child.  Did schumer ever work in the private sector or has he always been a parasite?  Schumer is a control freak, bully who sounds ignorant most of the time.
@ABCPolitics My Dad died of that.  Painful.  Prayers for that lady.
@senatemajldr Schumer is treating @POTUS like he is a child.  Schumer elected by New York State is a control freak, a bully, a parasite old FART &amp; as one of 100 an acute minority in the Senate.
@Jim_Jordan Schumer is treating @POTUS like he is a child.  Schumer is a control freak parasite old FART.
@QuickenLoans All I want is the kitten.  Don't need a loan.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson DEFINITELY.
@sxdoc Not the time to think about that.  Cancer is horrible.
@TrussElise She is very ill, had surgery on two growths in her lung &amp; is in the hospital.  Cancer.
@ABCPolitics Does he have to go to the bathroom?  What is with the antics?
@LadyRedWave @speakupsal Schumer is a control freak that New York State Elected.  He treats @POTUS like a child.  Has he ever worked in the private sector or is he the typical DemocRAT parasite living off the tax payers.
@pinkk9lover @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ROCKONOHIO @BestBrownsFan @AppSame @LVNancy @AnnaApp91838450 @Jamierodr10 @jeepsuzih2 @KAG4All @starcrosswolf @grizzlemeister He is some control freak elected from New York State old parasite DemocRAT FART that is treating @POTUS like a child.   Has Schumer ever worked in the private sector, probably not, most DemocRATS are parasites.
@cspan @SenSchumer Schumer is a control freak, know it all, stubborn old fart.  He treats @POTUS like a child, who the hell is he? Some DemocRAT elected bum from New York State.  Has that man ever done anything of value in the private sector.?  Probably not, typical parasite DemocRAT
@SenatorCaveman What do you call your crap?  You are deliberately causing a shut down with your stubborn bull headed control freak actions.  Control Freaks are horrible people.  &amp; you obviously are a control freak or you would not treat @POTUS as a child.
@Patrici15767099 You know that hateful woman was disbarred for EXTORTION, her only income will be dumb morons who by her crap.
@realDonaldTrump I think you are too, because as someone who read a lot of History, these hordes will fight until they no longer exist, &amp; we are not into crushing peoples.  It is bad enough that our HORDES here are planned parenthood &amp; abortion.  Same results.  Extinction.
@realDonaldTrump These hordes in this part of the World have been fighting since Gighus Khan, 5,000 B.C.   Don't know date, but forever.  We have lost so many of our fine military,  Nothing will stop them.  Nothing, except complete destruction.  @marcthiessen thinks you are making BOs mistake.
@AmericaNewsroom @JulieBanderas @RepKinzinger 7,000 military in Syria, he is wrong on his amount.  We cannot continue to fight wars that have been going o0n for thousands of years, my GOD, Gingus Khan these people are not capable of establishing  Nations.  HORDES most of them.  Jungle laws, not civilized.
@AmericaNewsroom Believe there is 7,000 troops in 	Syria, your guest is mistaken.
@RealJamesWoods @glennyork @SecNielsen IGNORANT, RUDE &amp; UGLY, typical lying, stealing, conniving DemocRAT.
@100PercFEDUP @shesova My daughter in law wore boots like that at her wedding, she is a farmer, all American girl never disbarred for EXTORTION this this trash was.  Know she did not pay $4,000 for that crap.
@RealSaavedra This creep is a pig.  What does he know about Jesus Christ for one, secondly, rude, ignorant, &amp; definitely a DemocRAT.
@dbongino @seanhannity show super last night.  Great job, Dan Bongino.
@DailyCaller Did you read @realDonaldTrump last tweet thanking a Senator for suggesting this, why do you persist in blabbering lies.  @POTUS
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Mattis said he was resigning a long time ago,  Super man, done a good job, but now we must bring our troops home FINALLY after decades of worthless nonsense.  If we must SHUT DOWN our government because of control freak lying DemocRATS , so be it.  Time to EXPUNGE DemocRAT crap.
@PastorDScott There is 7,000 there, bring them out of that HELL HOLE.
@realDonaldTrump This is Columbus, Ohio Dispatch.  Amazing even those that are on Twitter, see your tweets, actually retweet them with their moron comments, evidently can't understand English.  Glad you are leaving Syria, know the wall will be built, https://t.co/rxBy9pX2JO
@WashTimes Wish I could get paid for doing your job, I might be able to buy a present or two, whi9ch I could not do this Christmas, but get your story STRAIGHT will you.  Sadly you wallow in that stinking sewer scum swamp rather than seek TRUTH. https://t.co/KuT9wb97WW
@WashTimes As usually you got this wrong.  One of the Senators called for this, blabbering idiots ALWAYS.  Don't want to break your idiot record.
@darreldrowland Mexico has said they will harbor these so called asylum seekers evidently domestic violence will get you asylum.  Could not get that in the 80s, those women just had to be made walking dead poeople.
@darreldrowland And that unch of parasites if they do not vote for the bill passed by the House, will SHUT DOWN the government, for a long long time.
@SecPompeo Always thought the longest night of the year was January 21st.,   Winter solstice?
