.@POTUS44 commuted over 1,700...not 2,000.
Our nation’s criminal justice system is in dire need of reform, and cases such as Alice’s highlight the harsh reality of our broken system.
Furthermore, Attorney General Jeff Sessions should reverse his so-called ‘tough on crime’ directive to prosecutors instructing them to levy the most serious charges, to include mandatory minimums, regardless of the circumstances of the case.
I also urge @POTUS to do the same for the 2,600 other federal prisoners who are serving similar draconian sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. He should also support the #SAFEJusticeAct, which focuses mandatory minimum sentences on drug kingpins, instead of people like Alice.
I commend @realDonaldTrump’s decision to commute the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a nonviolent, first time drug offender. This is the first sentence that he has commuted, while @POTUS44 commuted over 2,000 sentences under his clemency initiative. 	https://t.co/NMXpbJ6J9y

Simply put, the #CBCBudget is a better reflection of our nation’s goals and priorities.
The #CBCBudget reflects the needs of the middle class and works hard to help lift millions of families out of poverty.
The #CBCBudget makes the tax code more fair &amp; reduces the deficit by $2.5 trillion. https://t.co/6s1O3AHkKI
The #CBCBudget protects programs critical to our seniors and enhances Social Security benefits.
The #CBCBudget increases the Pell Grant by $1000 making college more affordable.
The #CBCBudget creates 2 million more jobs over the next decade. https://t.co/i8QJQKjFdZ
The #CBCBudget invests $300 billion over the next decade to eradicate poverty &amp; provide a basic standard of living for hardworking Americans
What do you get with the #CBCBudget? 		-Comprehensive jobs programs 	-Increased economic opportunities 	-Investments in education
As the Chief Architect of the #CBCBudget,working families deserve to have an honest &amp; straightforward budget that invests in our communities
The @OfficialCBC is again offering an alternative budget to the #GOPBudget.
The #GOPBudget highlights the wrong priorities and leaves working families out in the cold.
The #GOPBudget needs a #RealityCheck. America’s budget shouldn’t help the wealthy at the expense of working families.
The #GOPBudget claims unrealistic growth will pay for massive tax cuts. But in reality, @HouseGOP are planning to gut the social safety net.
Our budget should reflect our priorities. The #GOPBudget will only weaken the American economy.

Under the #GAINAct a family who makes up to $75K a year and has 3 or more kids could receive a $12,000 tax credit.
Under the #GAINAct someone with no children who makes up to $37K a year could receive a $3,000 tax credit.
That is why I am proud co-sponsor of the #GAINAct. It gives hardworking people the raise they deserve!
FACT: working families’ wages have stayed the same for 40 years. This is why I support the #GAINAct to strengthen the EITC.

Congress must protect #DREAMers and I urge my Republican colleagues to join me &amp; take action.  #ProtectDREAMers!
The economic impact of ending #DACA is devastating. In Virginia alone, we stand to lose more than $700 million in GDP/year.
Ending #DACA is both morally bankrupt and fiscally irresponsible. There is nothing to be gained by ending the #DACA program.
Nearly 800k #DACA recipients are able to live &amp; work in the U.S.  and their contributions help all of us; our society and our economy.
Ending #DACA punishes individuals who were brought here as children through no fault of their own and will pull apart families.
I am very disappointed by @realDonaldTrump’s decision to end the #DACA program. #DREAMers are hardworking members of our community.

Congress should be working to strengthen the middle class, not cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of hard-working families.
How do Republicans expect us to grow the economy while cutting our commitment to creating jobs? #GOPbudget

The educational potential of Modeling and Simulation technology is boundless!
By expanding &amp; enhancing M&amp;S programs at our local colleges and universities, America can maintain its rapid growth in this industry!
Congress is working to ensure America keeps its competitive advantage by investing in this growing industry.
M&amp;S is a critical industry to this nation. It helps us build &amp; develop regional evacuation plans or aerodynamics of an airplane.
Both @NASA_Langley &amp; the Virginia Modeling, Analysis &amp; Simulation Center play a vital role in the use of M&amp;S technology throughout Virginia.
Modeling &amp; Simulation is an important and growing sector of Virginia's economy.
Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) Expo encourages everyone to discuss &amp; explore the many ways our nation's modeling &amp; technologies can be used.

There is no way around it. #Trumpcare will ↑ health cost &amp; force families to pay higher premiums &amp; deductibles.

Judges need the ability to consider all of the facts, issues and circumstances before sentencing.
The Justice Safety Valve Act would give discretion back to federal judges, allowing them to tailor sentences on a case-by-case basis.
There is growing bipartisan consensus based on evidence &amp; research that mandatory minimums are ineffective, unjust, &amp; waste the taxpayers $$
AG Sessions’ new policy guidance calls for severe penalties &amp; mandatory minimums – this is a step in the wrong direction.

#HappeningNow: Joining @NancyPelosi, @WhipHoyer &amp; my fellow @HouseDemocrats colleagues at a press conference on the passage of #Trumpcare. https://t.co/qkrdHYBiA0
Simply put, #TrumpCare is unacceptable for the American people.
The American people have spoken. They don’t want higher costs, less protections, and loss of coverage.  #Trumpcare
#TrumpCare would kick 14 million Americans off of Medicaid – harming children, seniors &amp; people with disabilities.
Under #TrumpCare, insurers are able to discriminate against Americans with pre-exisiting conditions.
#BeforeTheACA, sick people who were placed in high-risk pools faced long waiting lists, coverage exclusions, and unaffordable insurance.
The revised #Trumpcare is even worse.Congress should be helping families have access to high quality &amp; affordable coverage not hurting them.
Thanks to the #ACA, expanded health insurance helped cut personal bankruptcy filings down by 50% !! Read more here: https://t.co/fFIPBBOWvo
#Trumpcare: 	Costs on #working families ↑	Number of people insured ↓	Quality of coverage ↓
.@HouseGOP promised no one would lose coverage under #TrumpCare, but nonpartisan @USCBO says 24 million Americans would lose coverage
.@HouseGOP are rushing to pass #Trumpcare.That means higher health costs, disruption in the ACA marketplace &amp; a tax cut for the wealthy.
Today’s #Trumpcare vote is another attempt by @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @HouseGOP to undermine protections for working families. #healthcare

Having a pre-existing condition shouldn’t prevent you from having access to high quality and affordable care.
Cutting off protections for pre-existing conditions will make it all but impossible for millions to afford the care they desperately need.
#Trumpcare would gut protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions &amp; drive up costs for millions.
.@HouseGOP are trying to rush #Trumpcare through Congress again.The American public was clear; they don’t want higher cost &amp; worse coverage.

In @POTUS first 100 days he and the @HouseGOP did nothing but try to weaken American families and give tax cuts to the wealthy.
Congress should be fighting for American families to have greater security, not rolling back protections Americans have come to enjoy.
Sadly, #TrumpCare doesn’t provide insurance for everybody. Instead, it forces millions of Americans to lose their coverage.
The @HouseGOP want to raise health costs for American families &amp; disrupt the ACA marketplaces w/ #TrumpCare. Americans deserve better!
It's almost the end of the #100Days, and @realDonaldTrump still doesn't understand why kicking 24 million off health care is bad.

For every $ a white man makes for doing the same job:	Black women make 63¢	Native American women make 58¢	Latina women make 54¢	#EqualPayDay
Disaggregated #AAPI data shows Southeast Asian American &amp; Pacific Islander women face significant wage disparities. #EqualPayDay
On #EqualPayDay, we recognize Black women must work an additional 8 months to earn the same amount as a white man in one year.
Even today, women only earn 80 cents for every $1 earned by men. Sadly, Virginia isn’t exempt. #EqualPay https://t.co/VAiCZQUBNr

#TrumpCare will increase out-of-pocket costs &amp; take away healthcare from 24 million working families.
#TrumpCare isn’t any better for seniors. It will force seniors to pay 5 times higher than others for health coverage.
Now let’s talk #MillenialPenalty: Young people get a 30% penalty for reenrolling after lapse in coverage under #TrumpCare.
#TrumpCare is a bad deal for Americans. It will force Americans to pay higher premiums and deductibles. #PayMoreForLess
ACA = more money in the pockets of our seniors! #ACA7
For 7 years, insurance companies have no longer been able to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. #ACA7
It’s important to remember, because of the #ACA, we’ve had 7 years of no annual or lifetime caps on care. #ACA7
#TrumpCare will impact every American–including 7 million people who will lose coverage they receive through their employer. #PayMoreForLess
Today, @HouseGOP may hold a vote on #TrumpCare—giving tax breaks to the wealthy while forcing older Americans to #PayMoreForLess

If Republicans continue their efforts to repeal the ACA, the benefits we all enjoy will be taken away without having a replacement ready.
Now, more than 3 million additional children have health insurance coverage because of the ACA.
Remember, the ACA affects everyone. Families who receive coverage through their jobs &amp; those who don’t, children, young adults, and seniors.
Right now, families are having an important conversation about the many benefits of the #ACA and what is at stake if the law is repealed.

Increased access to services, early detection, and treatment options are vital when addressing health disparities for African Americans.
The #ACA has increased health equity by requiring coverage of preventive care, which is critical to promoting positive health outcomes.
But very few know the connection between civil rights and our health care system. The #ACA has helped reduce health inequality in America.
Many Americans know the civil rights struggle of African Americans played out in voting, education, housing &amp; the criminal justice system.
