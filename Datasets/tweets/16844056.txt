@RowlandJordyn @CircleReader If they are convicted of domestic violence, it is illegal for them to own guns.
@Ocasio2018 No it just means you attached good sounding names to bad ideas.
@eyee_shah @kksteffany @CircleReader Right but so long as they are not causing problems they should be able to get out of the cold and leaf through a book the same as I can. What can be done to facilitate that?
@00AaronFernando @CircleReader Because people react when they feel better threatened. Want to sell a paper? Threaten the reader. Want them to glance and leave it behind? Tell the the world isn't about to end. Hellfire and damnation works. Until they tune you out.
@kksteffany @CircleReader I always wondered how feasible it would be to have showers and donated clothing available at City libraries so they and other oatrons can comfortably browse together.
@KhaledBeydoun @CircleReader Iranian Christians are projected to make up 10% of their population soon.
Yup. The rage induced adrenaline is like a drug. That and the traffic ridiculously polarizing stances bring. https://t.co/du59odRytu
If we keep saying fascism when we mean nationalism or populism or isolationism or any of a number of more accurate isms, it will lose it's meaning. The discussion turns from valid concerns to what is and isn't fascist.
@MattWalshBlog Yeah. Why is the most powerful shark called a Great White? It isn't even white. It should be the Great Half White. Or the  Great Gray.

@CircleReader Both sides have their fringe crazies. I miss Buckley's assault on the racists of the conservative movement. I think Trump is more populist than racist, but it excited the same people.
@CircleReader It's frequently more subtle. Anyone peddling conspiracy theories about bankers, the Rothschild's, etc., Is peddling antisemitism. Replace those words with "Jew" and you hear the 30s all over again.
@tulipgrrl Felt like that coming home from Germany. Was pregnant and rationed 100 grams meat per week there. All we could afford!
So that video from Colbert about the "German news anchor?" It's a 7 year old clip and she is talking about a slavic Easter egg tradition. That sounds pretty sexual when translated to German. That's what she's laughing about. Plus, she's Austrian. #TrumpNATO
@MaggieSimi Still no idea what you are talking about
@MaggieSimi I am not sure what you are referring to?

@CircleReader @iamfujimura @et_inarcadia Cool! Thanks. I always like interesting things. :)
@tulipgrrl My sister in law was a little surprised when she came here. She is Australian and had a definite conception of America's. Upon arrival in NYC, she said New Yorkers were the nicest people she'd ever met. I said, "Wait until you get to the Midwest."

@CircleReader And the only person who shows the least kindness throws an apple at him in her frustration. His shell is pierced by a symbol of the fruit of knowledge thrown by his own sister.
@CircleReader Wow, wow, wow. This is kind of the perfect illustration for any group who has worked their whole lives for the betterment of their community only to find themselves despised when in need. Veterans? The elderly?
We need a way to say, "No. Not on this ticket. You can't just call yourself a Republican when you are anything but." And how does a Nazi run unopposed, anyway? Surely some Republican could have run. Not like they were going to win https://t.co/OjijJfmifI
@TheMassHistoria The meaning of liberalism changed from something most conservatives would embrace to something far to loving of large government to be truly "liberal."
@CircleReader Now, if we attributed that to Tesla, people might think it was his forward thinking that allowed him to divine such knowledge. :)
@CircleReader Yes. The same could be said of any of the quotes attributed to our founding fathers. And the opposite is true when we attribute them to Hitler. And then there's my favorite. https://t.co/XNxyIlbIGL
@CircleReader Also, Einstein didn't have to say it for you to feel good doing it. If you value fairy tales, read them because you value them. Maybe we would all do better if we resisted the appeal to authority for every good idea.

@RadioFreeTom Or the US leads the world in accessibility. In Germany, you go to a separate school if disabled, even if it is just for physical disability. Pushing a stroller is horrible because there are steps everywhere and no ramps.
@AynRandPaulRyan So basically, the same argument everyone has always used, left or right. "They started it."
I miss Buckley, too. https://t.co/baBKK7OhDc
@realDonaldTrump Funny thing is, our laws say that if they are picked up within 100 miles of the border, they can immediately be deported. What exactly do you want to change?
@RadioFreeTom Because it really is not about liberty or tolerance of different ideas, is it?

@20committee @CircleReader No surprise. Trump was way premature saying, "North Korea is solved." I'm not upset he went, however. So long as we don't make concessions without proof of them holding to their end, I do not mind the attempt at a peaceful resolution.
@PolitiBunny It's extra illegal to murder them if you hate them and extra extra illegal if you hate them for the color of their skin or their choice in lovers. It's only just plain old illegal to murder people you like.

@oddlysaid Checked out my morning coffee already.
@shanevanderhart This new apologetics for violence taking over Twitter is going to backfire if it makes it off Twitter. Not so sure it wasn't the violence of protesters at end of campaign that pushed people to Trump.
@AstroKatie @CircleReader Nonviolent protest has a long and productive history. Violent opposition brought us Hitler, Mao, Stalin and those like them.

@PastorJimDrake @NancyAdamsHBJ One of the many definitions of conservatism involved defending the status quo. That usually is not a strictly Christian stance.
Where reason and emotion, the head and the heart, the law and love meet, you find compassion. They are not mutually exclusive.
@oddlysaid I think we have lost our way. I read an excellent article I think may hit a little too close for comfort about Christians in the GOP.
@oddlysaid @historyengland I fear I may know a few people who would cheer them on and blame the Democrats. Er. Opposing party.
@KatTimpf Yes. I have heard of creative solutions for nonviolent offenders in Germany. It was a long time ago, but they had minimum security facilities ran kind of like halfway houses that let children come and go while mothers served time.
@oddlysaid Yes. Right there with you. Except I do not think it is an issue by issue approach so much as a "when did everyone I thought I agreed with jump off the bus?" approach. My principles are crystal clear. It is the Republican Party that left principles for a series of issues.
Sigh. https://t.co/NmJl4PPUCl
@oddlysaid @historyengland No way is that at all relevant. 😃
@oddlysaid The legislative branch has been sort of idle recently, what with the president's twitter feed and all. So maybe he just got bored?
@Pink_About_it @Carolin17951107 I think that is at the heart of all party politics: find an issue and own it. If you sove it, you need a new issue and that's too much work.

@CircleReader I worry about the irreparable harm to the conscience of a nation who says, "But it's the law," with no compassion. I have compassion on the children of a murderer sent to jail. And when the parents are searching for a better life. Even if we send them back, do it with dignity.
@oddlysaid Haven't seen it but will add it to my list! Our family movie night was with our village, sitting in the tennis court watching Honey I Shrunk the Kids under the stars. :)

@justasechs That would be awesome! There was always more discussion here . . . until the schedulers took over!
@pamina_q Yes. Surprising how many homeschool abuse cases started in the public school. If there's a conviction, I have no problem with increased monitoring. With allegations, I think you have to be careful, but a family that disappears during an investigation should be a red flag.
@pamina_q For example: Our constitution will not allow police to enter your home looking for evidence of a crime unless they have probable cause. I do not think these basic constitutional provisions should be ignored because society is concerned about abuse.
@pamina_q I think family is the fundamental unit of society and parental rights are tied closely to any concept of liberty. Abuse is horrific and we need to protect children, but we have to be very careful how we formulate laws to catch something that is already illegal.
@pamina_q OTH, a large reason for homeschooling is a child not receiving what he or she needs in the public schools and parents that are concerned as they watch their child fall behind.
@pamina_q Every study shows that the number one factor in the educational success of children is parental involvement. Parental involvement is high in homeschooling. It is not surprising that their test scores tend to be higher.

@CircleReader @oddlysaid @tulipgrrl @JohnFea1 I think true influence comes from faithfulness.

@CircleReader @oddlysaid @tulipgrrl @JohnFea1 This is what I believe and rarely find: "Society ought to be influenced by the community of Christians from whom they will learn the greatest values, including freedom of worship, civility, and reforms of all kinds." (paraphrased from Eliot, Idea of a Christian Society).
@CircleReader @oddlysaid @tulipgrrl There are two things going on that are pushing the conversation. 1) Inflammatory and aggressive rhetoric is rewarded with traffic. 2) Algorithms increasingly push content in front of us so we see what the algorithm sets before us. Both drive discussion toward extremes.
@CircleReader @oddlysaid @tulipgrrl I think it is populism. It isn't all bad or all wrong, but populism almost by definition is without a solid foundation. It is reactionary rather than principled. I checked out for seven years, though, so it seems like a completely different landscape. Like poor Rip van Winkle.
@CircleReader @oddlysaid @tulipgrrl I think I was left back in the dark ages politically. I don't connect with anyone, really. None of the loud ones, anyway. I want William F. Buckley, jr., and all I find is Matt Walsh.

@NebraskaOdyssey You, too! Nice to have a face to the blog. :)
No. I want discussion. Not the force of law to impose my beliefs. Level of control = 0.
@MaxKolbeGroup @pdivision @EveKeneinan Rights are either inalienable, or they are nothing but privileges granted by those in power.
@MaxKolbeGroup @pdivision @EveKeneinan If you are arguing for limiting their rights based on beliefs, you have the same conception of rights as those you oppose.
@MaxKolbeGroup @RJWDowsett @EveKeneinan When an ideology rises to power, the danger is always the eradication of opposition. That's why I support a republic based on law &amp; rights.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan By controlling. :)
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan You are going to make me like Twitter again. I miss conversation here. But I have to get back to the Silk Road or my students will be upset.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Given the choice to convert or control, I'd take the chance to convert. My eternity is secured.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Spiritual, yes. Civil government is another matter.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan ? I don't unfollow people just because I disagree with them.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Persecution is our birthright and one of the few promises Christ gave us if we chose to follow Him.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan We need lots of public conversations like this. Dealing with princples, ideals and leaving out the anger. On both sides.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan I will contest that. 300 years ago (centuries) the American conception of rights was a pretty new idea. Nowhwere near the acceptance now.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan For real. We're openly working to convert them and their children to Christianity. Through radio, TV, internet, YouTube. We're everywhere.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan If my kid had an atheist teacher, I'd have a problem. I homeschool. :)
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Your reasoning goes down the same trail. "They deny our rights if in power, so we must first deny theirs." I see no difference.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan You don't have to be atheist to not understand what a right is. The most important conversation of our time, but too many cat videos.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Then don't vote for them. That's liberty. Denying them rights based on a belief (or lack thereof) is tyranny.
@MaxKolbeGroup @EveKeneinan Have you been to Germany? Do you know what state sponsored religion does to the church? Trust me. You want the government out of it.

@mrsmetaphor But they may not be able to compete in this new market being created by government regulations.
@mrsmetaphor But anyone trying to start a business? Farmer's markets and small, organic farmers represent everything I love about America.
@mrsmetaphor business. GE will never be hurt by increasing regs. Nor will Tyson chicken.
@mrsmetaphor We're trying to solve problems through regulation. The problems are real enough, but governmental solutions always favor big
@mrsmetaphor That's what I'm most frustrated with the most in the current political atmosphere. And I don't know that it's corruption per se
@mrsmetaphor Expanding something that is failing doesn't seem wise.
@mrsmetaphor Government programs haven't worked. So do we abandon them all?
@mrsmetaphor "Trickle down" isn't really something that "works." It is a popular label for an economic model.
@mrsmetaphor Yes. It took a revolution, though. That's what is sort of scary.
@mrsmetaphor What ought to be is a value question. There likely will never be agreement on that. :)
@mrsmetaphor We're the wealthiest nation in the world. I think maybe our thoughts on what "works" or doesn't may need refined.
@mrsmetaphor ever fixing anything. It just seems to cause more problems everywhere it meddles.
@mrsmetaphor I don't know that it is ever tried. Simply handing out money hasn't worked out so great. I'm not really aware of the government
@mrsmetaphor Whether the government or the wealthy are the employer, it is "trickle down." But the government doesn't actually produce.
@mrsmetaphor That's sort of the problem with the government growing out of control. Any step to get it under control will hurt short term.
@mrsmetaphor The theory is that less taxes promotes investment in business. It isn't an immediate thing.

@jeannegrantwebb A crochet project abandoned to the closet.
@Reformama Pregnant. Waiting for those first signs of labor.
@jamieworley :) The joys of twitter.
@jamieworley That's why I have unicorn hooves in the closet.
@rachelveronica Yeah. Seeing as our nearest neighbor is 1/4 mile away, I don't think we're getting anyone. :)
@rachelveronica @CCRconservative I didn't know there was anywhere too far for candy. :)
@jamieworley It is fun. And relaxing. :)
Message from Mouse that Faithfull is shaking. Labor? Or overenthusiastic Mouse? Going to go check . . .
@CCRconservative @rachelveronica I won't be here. I think I'll be hitting up our neighbors for donations to Tiggy's House. :)
@rachelveronica @CCRconservative Y'all would be happy with my husband. Or maybe not since y'all would fight over the dots. :)

@oddlysaid Yeah. Difficult in a different way. I've leveled off a bit and it isn't as intense as it was. Just always there.
@CCRconservative But it also includes a little more, I think. :)
@CCRconservative I'm totally cool with a bit of self-promotion. I want to know what people are up to & that includes posts & etsy, etc.
OK. Hubby wants a recipe. Can't complain about him making breakfast so I better get off!
@mrsmetaphor Anymore, the only people I follow back are those that say something directly to me first, otherwise I don't even notice.
@TheTadey Yeah. I only have one list. I may need to tweak it or expand. There's those I listen to and everyone else. :)
@Leslie_Wiggins I don't mind the links. But recently it seems that is most of it. But again, it could just be me. I haven't been too active.
@oddlysaid Doing ok. Sort of in a holding pattern I think.
@Bandawerner I used Twitter a lot before Tiggy died. Then FB just felt a little more sheltered. Now Twitter seems impersonal.
@mrsmetaphor I haven't followed anyone back in ages. Which is bad but I never think to check who has followed me recently.
@lynngg Yeah, but I really like these people. They just don't seem to really be here anymore. Kinda like me, probably. :)
Is it just me or is Twitter just an rss feed now? I used to really like Twitter, but I'm having trouble really connecting w/ it anymore.

@AddaPinch Yeah. What is with the shoes and socks littered about the yard?
@nolamom76 I hope you get it figured out. We haven't had much luck once it has started. None will do it around us, but one is persistent.
@nolamom76 or whatever will make your dog shake her head trying to get out of her mouth.
@nolamom76 I've heard rigging up things so empty cans come crashing down along with the food can work. & filling treats w/ hot sauce.
@nolamom76 not around. Mouse traps set in front of food is supposed to work because of the noise. Though obviously not always.
@nolamom76 countersurfing is tough because there's such a huge reward. Essentially you need to find a consequence that happens when you're
@nolamom76 We later found out she was the one stealing the food out of the mousetraps, not mice. So not much fear of the noise there.

@seasidetales The Audubon Center in Denton, NE is straw bale. So is the nature center in Kearney.

@seasidetales isn't the straw bale used as insulation? Standard construction doesn't offer much above ground, regardless. :(

@fourgreenis Yeah, no kidding. Ours is only a week before the state fair. By then school has started.
@fourgreenis :) We're still waiting for the county fair.
Oh dear children, "share" does not mean "give it to me." And mom is not your enforcer.
@fourgreenis I don't think so. Just when I logged on, I had 5 tweets about homeschool after hardly seeing much of any.
@thekytikat There's always a misfit in every crowd. :) (I actually prefer tea, but sometimes nothing but a good cup of coffee will do.)

Except @AmberOliver. She's talking about a world without coffee. I don't think homeschooling could occur in such a place.
Everyone seems to be talking about homeschooling this morning. That means fall is ahead, right?
@AmberOliver Don't speak such unspeakable horrors.

@zrecsmom This isn't where we got it, but it is very like our hive. http://thegardenhive.blogspot.com/
@zrecsmom We ordered it online. It's a top bar hive. A lot of them come with a window. Not sure about the langstroths, though.
@zrecsmom I think we're over it now, but it was no fun.
@zrecsmom We got a top bar hive with a window in the side so we can watch what's going on. The kids love it!
@zrecsmom I'm really enjoying it so far. The only sting we've had was the third bee my 6yo picked up by the wing.
@zrecsmom Were I an allergist who could do things like that. :)
@zrecsmom Yeah, that doesn't sound bad. Pinkeye blurred vision here. :) But with a reaction and a family history, *I* would test.
@zrecsmom Maybe they will now with a bad reaction to a sting?
@zrecsmom Interesting. I've never asked around for that. Just finished a bee class before we set up our hives, though.
@zrecsmom You can also look into immunotherapy, a series of shots over time that lessen or eliminate the allergic reaction.
@zrecsmom Benadryl will help unless there are breathing problems. Then you need an epipen.
@zrecsmom I get that. We're only 5 1/2 months from Tiggy's death. Everything makes me panic.
@zrecsmom But I'd watch it, maybe give Benadryl. You rarely have an allergic reaction to the first sting. It's the 2nd one that's a problem.
@zrecsmom the way up your arm and it is a "bad reaction." A sting on the finger that makes your mouth swell is an allergic reaction.
@zrecsmom possible breathing problems, heart palpitations. Involves other systems. You can get stung on the finger and have it swell all
@zrecsmom A bad reaction includes swelling contiguous with the sting. Can be extensive. Allergic reaction includes swelling elsewhere,
@andrea_r Donate it all to Tiggy's House and we'll list it! :) Except that probably still falls under giving it away, huh?

@Sonita_Lewis So, uh, may I ask why?
@minnemom (But ours is just a large personal garden, not a farm!)
@minnemom Took two days. Still have beans, squash and melons to go in, but I'm hoping for a big push to finish it off tomorrow.
@minnemom We finished planting corn today, too!
And the kitten Bug chose for her birthday present. Only 2 weeks old. http://on.fb.me/jdViHY Can't wait to bring her home!
@quazydellasue Aw, but it will come and it will melt your heart. :)
@MeghanTucker Just leave it on the counter for a few weeks. Bad eggs float, too. :)
My new inspiration for weeding the garden: http://on.fb.me/k3cl7s
@DonnaShenk playdough, finger paints, glue, scrap paper and extras of whatever manipulatives the big kids are using.
@celticmuse That doesn't sound promising. What happened?
Need to fins something more productive to do when I get up early, but I don't like going outside long when everyone's asleep.
@digibomb You have a few days left, just make them count.
@F5th Sounds like fun! :)
@F5th totally happy to. I don't usually notice new followers until they say something to me so I'm glad you did!
@reflective Happy Twitter to you and your family, my friend. :)
@sawickis I think the work is half the fun. I've never loved a shower wall like the one my husband and dad put in. :)
@sawickis Yup. It surprises me how many people can't see past a paint job to the space & what it would be w/ their own stuff.
@sawickis That's how we could afford this place. It wasn't a total wreck, but a lot needed done.
@sawickis Oh, that sounds so lovely! Loved dreaming about everything we'd do when we got this place. Still do a little, though it's harder.
@TheTadey dmed you. And how annoying. I wish more of those people got caught.
@sawickis How exciting! So I want to hear all the details. What is the house like? What are your plans for the property?
@TheTadey The police got a picture of her in her white escalade, but not clear enough to pursue further. Glad yours was held!
@TheTadey We didn't have to pay anything, but it still irks me she got a finch. I want a finch! Might have paid for the gas if she'd asked.
@TheTadey Yikes! I had a credit card stolen. Fortunately, they only got  a zebra finch and a tank of gas before the card was flagged.
@andrea_r Can we add to that a humble request to not disable right click when you're hosting a carnival?
@andrea_r we kind of got stuck on paypal and I'm not convinced I did it right since I've never set it up before.
@andrea_r @SmockLady I would have laughed. :) Do we have any new inspirations as to our paypal issue?
@andrea_r  For Lost: run to the beach, run to the forest, run to the beach . . . how many times did they just run back and forth?
@jamieworley Next step: buy your own peanuts and make your own peanut butter! Looking forward to our almonds, and eventual almond butter.
Almost made a call on a kitten and then looked at the clock. 7:30 may be a bit early even if it is for a farm kitten.
Our memory quilt. http://bit.ly/lDT058
@HappyHousewife A little of both. Especially at first. The hardest dollar not to spend is the one that makes things easier after a hard day.
@ChristineMMTTM Don't make me think about that. I have 6 more years before I have to have that kind of panic. AAAHHH!!!
@righteousbren Happy Birthday!
@thehomespunlife I haven't written about homeschooling in so long . . .
@nolamom76 :) I've heard those magic erasers work, but I don't know. Try some toothpaste. It worked on our table.
@nolamom76 Paint?
@heartandhome ooh. ouch.
@songofmyheart whole entries missing. Yeah. Blogger had issues.
If you read old books where everyone keeps getting diseases you've never heard of, this list can help. http://bit.ly/jJ6GwP
@amandaestone I love my orchard. And this Japanese flowering cherry sitting here waiting for my husband to plant.
@chaotic_barb Have fun. :)
@chaotic_barb Technically, it is copyrighted the moment it is created. You don't have to register it anywhere.
@sprittibee Finally, the world begins to recognize the true capabilities of those ornery grins.
@farmmom4him We sort of did that. Got up early then had a family snuggle in my bed because it was cold & we all fell back to sleep.
Join me for a virtual breakfast! http://bit.ly/mTGTBy
@rationaljenn Fun! I shouldn't have let Bug know it was birthday present. Then I could have given up. Now I have to stretch & grow. :)
@rationaljenn I'm crocheting. And remembering why I once decided to never try 3D objects again. But it's for my 5yo & she already knows . .
@thehomespunlife Hey, thanks!
RT @thehomespunlife: 3 Featured Bloggers for this weekend. http://ow.ly/4UMva
@Sonita_Lewis Oh wonderful!
@Sonita_Lewis Hoping he's taken water by now? A lot of dogs do that at first. Hoping he's lapping up the h2o by now!
@Sonita_Lewis He's such a beauty!
@Sonita_Lewis Aw, they're so beautiful. We had a malamute once upon a time and loved her.
@heartandhome Oh wow. I kinda missed that. Praying for you!
@maustan That's wonderful! Congratulations!
@Sonita_Lewis Oh fun! What kind of dog?
@celticmuse In thought and deed. I'm just overwhelmed.
@nolamom76 It's beautiful. And would you believe the woman who made it didn't know us before the accident?

@youngmommy No, I haven't. :)
@youngmommy :) My eldest did. & she talked early so she would ask for "night night" which meant nursing. :)
@youngmommy Hey, a 1yo can do that, and even the AAP recommends nursing that long. :)
Apparently, Twitter has become my instant messenger. Wondering if I should miss the days I spent chatting w/ everyone or be glad for time.
@JanelMessenger Thanks, Janel! :)
@reflective That's good. I wish I felt like I was able to figure it out. :(
Tiggy's House is on Facebook! Join for updates on our goal of funding one children's home for Tiny Hands http://on.fb.me/mMga6A
@reflective :) Now tell him to have a moment of inspiration to figure out our paypal issue. :)
@Madzmom1 Wow! That is a beautiful garden!
@fitmommy2012 It was sorta funny, but the hail didn't last long & now I have a dozen trees to plant!
UPS guy arrived as the hail hit. Stand off: Him in his truck, hubby on the porch, no one making the first move . . .
Best fundraiser I've ever been to & can't wait to do it for Tiggy's House: http://bit.ly/kanpqN
@rede5 Yeah! And congrats on your grades! That is wonderful!
@HipMarye I've read it depends on how you use it. The bee people I know who use it do so in a chicken coop. Bees don't hang around there.
@KJMartinson Thank you so much. Now I'm actually following you, too. Love finding all these new sisters I didn't know I had. :)
@SmockLady K. I'll send it on to Tiny Hands, then. :)
@SmockLady Oh. For a second I was thinking about the happy dance I so wanted to do.
@SmockLady so like, it's working?
@SmockLady I may have something set up wrong. But I need to go make noodles. Or my family might eat me.
@SmockLady Check spam? Who knows?
@SmockLady I'll get your dollar back to you or buy your test thing or something. Hoping for concentration time in an hour or two.
@SmockLady Yeah! I can make money without selling anything! Open a website and the money just starts pouring in . . .
@nolamom76 Why do I only think of how  many times that dress would likely need changed to get through one shoot?
@celticmuse How am I not following you? It seems we've chatted before? Gee, I'm really bad at at keeping up, aren't I? Fixed!
@SmockLady yours and hers.
@mrscchowds And I have a Micah, too. :) Here he is sleeping with his dragon: http://bit.ly/m1KyDy
@HandcuffedHeart @br3ntos @elisam34 @hsing3kinder @mrscchowds @beckysallinger Yeah to new friends!
@andrea_r @SmockLady  & I got the dollar. I don't suppose you ever got the download link?
Anyone else out there I'm not following? If you're a real person, just say hi & I'll follow ack.
@SmockLady All this time and I wasn't following you? &lt;blush&gt;
@DanielleBean I got six great ones. Can't imagine wanting anything but holding my baby in those first hours after delivery.

@JoPrincessW I totally agree. If only I could get my husband to agree.
@andrea_r & rae's failed, too. Not sure where to go from here.
@andrea_r Mine and Rae's are "processing"
@SmockLady cool. I'm in gmail right now. gottsegnetATgmail and all that.
@andrea_r Yeah, on the dashboard, it says it was a failed download.
@andrea_r May not be a good business model. Give me money and get nothing back.
@SmockLady whoops. didn't meant to dm you. Or maybe I should. I'm sure the whole world is keenly interested in this convo. :)
@andrea_r Yeah! Would you like a refund? I trust you got it delivered, too? It's already available free on my site. :)
@SmockLady Yeah, I'm not sure where that is. The link I sent is the only one I know that should be live.
@SmockLady here's my test.  http://bit.ly/kjj1gb
@SmockLady I set it live but it was paypal that gave me the message that I was logged in as seller & needed a different account.
@andrea_r Hey, it worked for me in college.
@andrea_r I can't make the purchase logged in as seller, but w/out another paypal, I can't go further.
@SmockLady OK, plugin seems to be working for me. I can't purchase as seller & I only have 1 paypal account, but seems to work.
@tiffsilverberg OH, so exciting! Thank you so much!
@tiffsilverberg No, I haven't. If you have a resource that could tell us where to start, we're all ears! :)
@Jerry_Wilson Thank you so much!
@oddlysaid If your area is half as windy as it is here, they probably don't remember which way up is.
@mommyundressed Thank you so much. It's a huge goal, but my mom (who's better at this kinda thing) has a few people excited!
@mommyundressed One of the things that drew us to Tiny Hands was their goal to become self-sufficient & not always need support.
@mommyundressed That's wonderful, too! Everyone is called to help in different ways and different places. God bless!
@oddlysaid Careful. The garden will be putting you on moderation soon.
@andrea_r @TaderDoodles @vikki77 Thanks for the RTs guys! Trying not to be nervous about this whole thing! :)
Would you consider helping support Tiggy's House, a children's home to reach the poor and orphans in southeast Asia? http://bit.ly/jB889S
@MckMama Yeah, pretty much. The carry back part is optional.
@MckMama I've heard they become invisible while birthing. Then you find them in impossible places.
@yolandamarie @lostcheerio Thanks! I now have a way for people to log in. Not sure anyone will want to, but thanks for helping!!!
@lostcheerio was afraid of that. I shall keep experimenting. Thanks!
Testing a chat thing on my blog. Would someone mind stopping by and saying hi? Thanks! http://bit.ly/9ob2t5

@HipHmschoolMoms Planning gardens. Maybe I should take them down to plant them today.
@oddlysaid They should have all had their passports out.
@haysters :) you're welcome.
@haysters And yet created in His image. That is where you fit in. :)
@thehomespunlife Funny thing is, he who would be first shall be last. :)

Wanna see my Mother's Day present? I bought it and decided later what it was for. http://on.fb.me/kFVodp
@oddlysaid I could imagine a language without chihuahuas, but not without chocolate.
@oddlysaid Geronimo's real name meant "one who yawns." Maybe we should just use his real name.
@oddlysaid Oh no. If we restrict the use of Geronimo, we may have to throw out chocolate and chihuahua as well.
@oddlysaid It's a Mexican word anyway. Maybe all the Jerome's of the world should be upset.
@sammyjwebb Mom, however, might need a little whipped cream to get through it all . . .
@scotters Fried potatoes, too, curiously enough. Well, eaten. Not looking forward to the day I'll require drinking them.
@Brandys_Brood :) I was just perusing through there.
@Brandys_Brood I'm sorry. :( But until you've had the experience, it is easy to fall for that stuff.
@Brandys_Brood Oops. A lot of people aren't happy with them. http://bit.ly/iXjrDj
@Brandys_Brood http://bit.ly/iXjrDj
@AmberOliver They're probably the same ones that were on the shelves back then. They made one big batch & took a holiday.
@AmberOliver Or I shall bring Twinkies with me to TX.
@AmberOliver You need to edumacate that child.
@Leighbra If they were that averse to human smell, I think they wouldn't nest in mailboxes. :)
@TaderDoodles in some bedding and hang it in a tree and mom will take care of it, even if it isn't in the original nest.
@TaderDoodles May have been pushed out. Do you know where the nest is? I've heard you can poke holes in the bottom of a butter dish, put
@TaderDoodles Or it may have been pushed out by an older sibling or a parasitic nestling.
@TaderDoodles Um, what kind of bird and how feathered? Mom will watch over a fledgling. If it doesn't have feathers, it may need put back.
The wind blew over our dog kennel. Maybe I should make sure it didn't blow my poultry away!
off to check on ducklings and maybe make jelly. and carrots for the baby. He's like that.
@andrea_r Yes. :) I think @reflective 's email puts us there. Scary all of a sudden.
@andrea_r But we're feeling . . . almost . . . ready.
@andrea_r That could be cool. I think @reflective has an email for you, too. Your favorite thing. :)
@andrea_r Feel like we're getting somewhere. Did you notice our pretty new colors, huh, huh, didya, didya? :)
@andrea_r They should keep those things fenced, huh? :)
@nolamom76 NO!
@reflective Mine didn't last year, either, but it makes good syrup. But floral jellies can take up to 2 weeks to gel properly.
@reflective Aw, fun!
@butterflysnbees I've been so thankful for my blog. So many of the pictures I do have are because I had a post in mind at the time.
@butterflysnbees That's what we moms tell ourselves when we've given it up.
@butterflysnbees Well, I'll try to keep up with photographing our projects for them. I'm bad about pictures of my children so we'll see.
@butterflysnbees Oh gross. But then, my son eats his. Not sure which is worse, actually . . .
@butterflysnbees That's nice prayer. :)
Thanks @BlogHer and whoever nominated my post for the spotlight! http://bit.ly/lu1ESl
@butterflysnbees And so cute on your ducks. I'll let you watch mine any time you want. :)
@butterflysnbees :) Or maybe :( I keep hoping maybe there is more help coming as they hit the teens, but maybe not?
Our ducklings arrived! A little bit of fluffy cuteness to start your day. http://bit.ly/mRJsjt
@RainyDayDiamond I'm just sayin'. My siamesish cat looks nothing like her tabby mom or supposed tabby dad.
@MckMama May need a few tests. A single litter can have multiple fathers.
@sprittibee Yeah, kids, appreciate me. :)
@andrea_r I could see that. But so many people don't draw the proper distinction. We can start calling all articles magazines.
@knittybob Thanks. I actually slept last night. Feeling a little better this morning.
@knittybob kinda feel like that's what I'm doing right now, though it is a different kind of storm. :(
Open the door and keep an eye on them. They'll go in at sundown.
@oddlysaid Yeah. I'm thinking of giving them a big cleaning chore. Then they can disappear for hours & I hear nothing from them.
Big plans for today. How much credit do you give for children entertaining themselves while mom tries to get some things done?
@Sonita_Lewis I voted. But I don't know if it counts because I voted for a bunch of people. :)
@mylittlesoapbox My ducks love the puddles!
@homeschool My husband tells me I have five helpers when I say things like that. I don't think he understands.
I want to remember. http://bit.ly/ia6giM

@Brandys_Brood Hmmm . . . I think I was being sarcastic, but I don't remember why.

@Brandys_Brood Oh, hey, that's a nice thought!

@oddlysaid 'cuz I don't go for that sort of thing. Watching my hubby hold the baby, or play ball w/ the kids , on the other hand . . .
@oddlysaid I checked w/ my cursor hovering over the stop button just in case there really was something. :)
@oddlysaid Shoulda warned you, but I'm not totally indiscriminate about posting links. :)

@reflective Thank you, Renae.
He is risen!
@HipHmschoolMoms Mp3's loaded with free downloads of librivox are nice.
@momofAJ Beautiful!
@FairlyOddMother Cooking for my hubby is so depressing. He loves mashed potatoes, fries and plain pasta. All else is "It's ok."
@TaderDoodles I don't have a lot of luck with seed starting, but I try every year. This year was OK. Last year, the herbicidal cat got em.
@TaderDoodles We're on year two, here, but I've done more to intentionally build the soil so hoping for at least moderate success!
@TaderDoodles I used to feel like that. Took three years to get a good garden then I read it takes 3 years to build good soil. :)
@jeffq73 Berliner weisse is a sour beer. Might be good. Not much alcohol in it. You mix it with raspberry syrup to drink. :)
@jeffq73 but you can't get either one here. And it wouldn't work w/ Berliner weisse, anyway. It's a light, summer drink. :)
@jeffq73 I haven't made beer bread before, but it sounds good. Redback and Berliner Weisse are the only beers I've ever liked . . .
@TaderDoodles Let's hope so. Last year, my garden yielded almost nothing for all the work. Trying to do it right this year.
@TaderDoodles Oh, good luck!
@jeffq73 That's the fun part. Experimenting. :)
@jeffq73 So, how was it?
Potatoes are in. Onions and shallots are next, then I'm done for the moment. Will resume Monday if the weather holds.

@my3boybarians um, getting ready to feed bees and plant strawberries and potatoes. Thinking about baking a cake tomorrow.
@tulipgrrl Actually, I am. Breakfast seemed to help. So glad to hear yours is gone!!!!
@TaderDoodles Well, started off with a picture of our chicks. I'll think of you when my ducks come and take lots of pictures. :)
Our chicks. http://on.fb.me/hbktU6
@TaderDoodles Aw, what a bummer. :( I'll be posting pictures of mine, if looking at other people's ducklings helps any.
@PoeticLotion :) They are fun. Our are domesticated so don't fly. They try, though and it looks hilarious.
@TaderDoodles Aw, I'm sorry. :( I love our ducks. Only have them cuz I totally caved to the begging. But we're getting more. :)
@TaderDoodles I'm getting my ducklings next week. What kind did you get? And do you still have them?
@modernjune So cute!
@HipHmschoolMoms More than I would have thought. Where did stop come from?
@HipHmschoolMoms More than I would have stop. There are five families within a couple miles & I live in the middle of a corn field.
@tulipgrrl I know from watching my dad's it's nothing like a migraine. Pray yours goes away quickly.

@andrea_r That might encourage us.
@oddlysaid @mylittlesoapbox Thanks. 51/2 hrs driving, a funeral, thinking about my little Tiggy and wound up children. Just tired.
Long day. Finally home. Not such a good day. Hope the kids fall asleep soon.

@andrea_r That is way cool. You're the coolest. Now I can quit my day job and . . . wait, I already did that.
@andrea_r maybe I just be faster than Pale Moon.
@andrea_r Ok. Maybe you can just come and fix my browser then. :)
@andrea_r Ok. Interesting, because everywhere else I'm getting them. Even here in tweetdeck. :)
@andrea_r Is there a spell check function for lp? Noticed I'm not getting the red squiggly lines for my multiple typos.

@_HMama Definitely! My daughter is working on a cute little busy book.
@alfecia The "I know only x% will repost this" or whatever get to me sometimes, but I dearly love a couple of people who do it so oh well.
@homegrown_mom Congratulations! :)
@mrsaddison Feeling it here, too. We have a tank twice as big as our old car. Mental health prescribes filling at 3/4 tank!
@homegrown_mom Maybe a little dressier if you're actually pitching to someone.
@homegrown_mom Business casual. Last year I felt overdressed in heels. Sweater ad slacks felt about right this year.
And we have bees! And stings! And fearless children. http://roscommonacres.com/2011/04/and-we-have-bees/
@mrsaddison Let me know if you find out. I'm getting them in Spanish.
@mylittlesoapbox We really want Pilgrims. I love them. Maybe we should go for something more aggressive, but I love them.
@mylittlesoapbox Pilgrims are known for low fertility. I now have two ganders and no goose. So sad. But there's always next year.
@mylittlesoapbox incubating, but not sure if they're even fertile yet.
@mylittlesoapbox We had a good size flock before a weasel got in the pen & killed five. A dog just got our goose. I have 4 of her eggs
@mylittlesoapbox My ducklings should be coming next week. :) Hoping to start a breeder flock & hoping it goes better than our goose flock.

@Leighbra I went back just to catch your genius and comment on it. Genius should never go unappreciated.
Coolest quote: ""We don't need no education" (Pink Floyd) - Yes you do, you just used a double negative."
@rationaljenn Yeah, probably. The rest of us have to go to your blog for the funny cleverness to laugh on purpose. :)
@matthewktabor Cool! My daughter wants to apply for a local scholarship to start her own hive. She installed the bees in one of ours. :)
@matthewktabor No but that does sound fascinating! I know you can keep them on apartment rooftops!

@reflective homeschooling, homesteading, child loss . . .what is my blog about?
@reflective Right now I'm just imagining it being all my posts and nothing else. Maybe I should think if there are things I'd actually share
@nolamom76 I get that. I post my blog stuff to my FB page.
@andrea_r well, yes. That's why it actually has a page for when we have something to write about. Because they wouldn't care about my bees.
@andrea_r about my blog and not care about the brush we cleared this morning.
@andrea_r Maybe I don't get it because my blog is a personal blog. Thus I don't understand why someone would want to subscribe to a page ...
@abitofearth Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. I don't care all that much about traffic. Just trying to figure out why everyone seems to do it
@nolamom76 Maybe I think too much that if anyone really wanted to read it, they would read it rather than subscribe to some other page?
@andrea_r But those are your to do lists! That man was wrong. :)
@marymakesmusic OK. I think that is what I'm asking. Because it seems to me like it would all be the same people.

@zrecsmom haven't done any of them, but kids want to do one a week. Maybe Friday since that is our easy day.
@zrecsmom the goal is to work through the daily cards each day and do one weekly card a day. Only have a couple monthly things.
@zrecsmom just keep drawing cards until the work is done.
@zrecsmom Divided it up into daily, weekly and monthly. When I want to tidy up, everyone takes an index card and does the job.

@andrea_r So I'm building them their own orchard over there, but of low growing hedge type plants.
@andrea_r Cool. I thought about putting in the orchard, but hubby wants them as far from the house as possible.
@andrea_r Except I don't want shade on my beehives. But that would be cool.
Ooh. Last thing I want to mow is an apiary. Thinking of turning under all the grass and replacing with lignonberry.
@andrea_r Something tells me you don't call everyone younger than you "honey," either.
Hey, cool. I just found out I can fit 16 hives in the space I set aside for an apiary. Two shouldn't be crowded.
@oddlysaid Tresures you will never know. Like currant and blueberry and can you even get raspberry that far south?
any ideas here for a bee friendly fruiting windbreak for zone 4/5?

@butterflysnbees Only when I think about it. When I wake up, I only know it was about him because of the way I feel. I can usually sort it
@butterflysnbees wow. I've heard of things like that. It always makes you wonder, doesn't it?
@butterflysnbees Yikes. That would be horrible.
@butterflysnbees Mostly I don't dream, though. At least nothing I remember. Perhaps related to the numbness in life? I don't know.
@butterflysnbees The ones about him are intense, he's just rarely there. At least not in a way I can see or touch or hear him.
@butterflysnbees Some people talk about intense, vivid dreams of their children. I wonder if there are commonalities or if it is all unique.

@butterflysnbees Wouldn't have been so bad if I had at least gotten to see him. His presence is soooo strong. But I don't get to see him.
@butterflysnbees I knew if they found out, they'd think I had gone insane and kidnapped some kid.
@butterflysnbees In one, I had him hidden in the basement & the entire dream was me consumed w/ not letting anyone know he had come back.
@butterflysnbees I have had some really strange dreams. REALLY strange. Often about Mattias, but he's never in them. Only symbolically.
@butterflysnbees I think babies are supposed to represent projects, goals, dreams becoming reality. Any changes on the horizon?

Hmm...don't know that it will showcase the egg, but custard sounds good: http://bit.ly/ffkvEi

@Leighbra Hard to do complicated, multi-step problems when you're still counting up what 8 + 4 is. :)
@Leighbra Cool! & she's doing better w/ her new math. The old stressed problem solving which she is good at but not memorization.
@Leighbra But now she seems to be understanding it better. We're doubling up a bit on lessons in hopes of catching up in a year.

@rationaljenn Usually. They always tell me, though, so you may want to ask the docotr.

@nolamom76 It's hard to talk to kids about that because you don't want them to be scared. Just safe.

@haysters Why did the dog chase his tail? He was trying to make ends meet!
@haysters & I tell you, I view my dogs differently since moving out here. They earn their keep, and that grants them some reprieve.
@haysters :) Mine are actually pretty good. A little too much rough housing in doors when first let in, but they settle down.
@haysters Gee, we now have four. One is in heat. The new one we took in is an intact male. The next bit shall be interesting.

Getting ready to go down to little Tiggy's grave. Been a long time and my emotions are a confused mess.
@froggygirletsy Oh yeah! I'm so happy that's going to work out!
@froggygirletsy Or try here. http://bit.ly/efxvld It's a delivery service for a number of restaurants in the area.
@froggygirletsy Good luck! Though I think you can order pizza without cheese. Don't know how good that would taste, though. :)
@froggygirletsy You can order pizza online now. Is it possible to work w/ a Pizza Hut or something?
@ChristineMMTTM Sounds exciting. And scary. And like a blog I could get addicted to if it works out for you guys. :)

@LucretiaPruitt Yeah. But I supposed it isn't entire foolishness. Because sometimes that actually works. :)
(because mostly I just kept hitting "print" hoping it would.)
Amazing how much better the printer works when you plug the computer cable in. & how many times I pushed print on this 1 doc b4 finding prob
@orschelnfmandhm Yes. That is me.  If only I had something to do with all the eggs we'd end up with. I need a pig to feed my leftovers to.

@teridenison Want it for honey for us and hoping to expand to a small side business!
@teridenison We have two hives, but no bees yet. Picking them up in April!
@oddlysaid Actually hope to. And eating more poultry.
@matthewktabor I like TFA. And think the fact that so many move on to different careers has a huge impact on education.
@oddlysaid We already ordered ducks. Just ordered guinea fowl. Hoping to hatch geese. DD12's starting chicks. My barn is FULL!
I'll HAVE 1000.
Orscheln's informed me their chicks are arriving next week. Must find other shopping destinations until chick days are over, or I'll 1000.
@SmockityFrocks Oh, I remember going through that with my goslings! So hard, that waiting.

@reflective Yippee!
@zrecsmom She woke up her normal self. Made herself a chart to make sure she drank enough. I think it scared her just as much as me!
@nolamom76 Playdough.
@nolamom76 Doing well, thankfully. A little over halfway through her water goals for today. :)
Cornbread with butter instead of oil is oh so good. May make them as a side more often!
@sixinthenw Yeah, they can be pesky that way. I need to block them from the strawberries before they start coming  up!
@oddlysaid Better doesn't necessarily have to mean good. Close your eyes. It tastes like chicken. Er, pig. :)
@jennhoots It has been months since they've been let out and they were happy!!!
Snow has turned to mud has turned to tired of cleaning the bathtub.
@oddlysaid Normal self and rebelling a bit against doctor's orders to stay quiet for today. She had IV fluids for two hours last night.
@oddlysaid Coffee always knocks mine out, which tells you something about my recent caffeine intake.
Herded the ducks and geese down to the garden for the first time this year. I have weeds already! Eat, geese, eat!!!
@fit40four Thanks!
@zrecsmom That seemed to be what they were thinking to begin w/. I felt better when she talked to me on the phone. Sounded normal.
& tests showed she was a bit dehydrated. Started on IV and feeling back to normal. Thanks everyone! Feeling much better here. :)
Waiting for bloodwork, but at the moment the dr. thinks it's flu combined with stress.
After we prayed, my son comforted his siblings with some of his Sparks verses. :)
@homewiththeboys But thank you. They're just getting her information now...
@homewiththeboys No. I'm getting ready to watch something to calm the little ones down. My husband took her in to be sure.
@ramblingreba She's 12. I am scared, but they're sure she's dying.
@oddlysaid Thanks. My kids are totally panicking. It's all feeling like a bit much right now. :)
My mouse is on the way to ER. Went from fine to shaking, difficulty breathing and nausea in about two minutes.
@oddlysaid Um, can we stick with the candy hearts?
Nursing the baby. Drinking coffee. Good thing he slept all night, cuz he may not be taking his nap!
@zrecsmom Thanks.
@zrecsmom Hey, you catch on fast!
@PeggySueCusses We won't know until we find out whose next.

@TaderDoodles Me! (I'd at least like to try!)
@butterflysnbees Maybe that's why I actually slept a bit last night. ;)
@scotters Too bad. I hear it's all the rage.
@scotters I'd say "shouldn't you e driving" but clearly you're not. :)
OK, I have everything I need to start my orchard notebook. Except the concentration to actually start.
@butterflysnbees Follow up is great, but every place we've been has called first. :)
@WHRanchDesign I cleaned up the clothes from the floor he normally naps on, so I guess he followed them to the basket. :)
@smockityfrocks Thanks!
Laundry is for the dogs.  http://yfrog.com/h35kqdyj
@smockityfrocks That's about all you need! We have brooded in cardboard boxes, an old dog kennel and a guinea pig cage. :)
@smockityfrocks (share as in post a ton of pictures)
@smockityfrocks Oh wonderful! You're going to share them, right? Cuz I love chickens. Do you have their brooder all set up?
Aw look. Google's celebrating my birthday with a lightbulb moment. http://bit.ly/bOAhub
@smockityfrocks My biggest piece of advice: join backyard chickens forum. They will answer any questions. http://bit.ly/ZoB8q
@smockityfrocks Oh, how fun!!! We're anxiously awaiting our ducklings. And I need to call about my daughter's chicks.
@FeelsLikeHome Congratulations!
OK, based on the spam that's making it through, I think Akismet must be on strike.
@CircleReader & here I've only ever known it as the day impeachment proceedings began against Nixon.

A year of life. (It's my birthday.) http://bit.ly/g5S8QT
Started leeks, egg plants and something else. Getting ready to start...some other stuff. Oh, where did I put that list?
@SeasideTales Hope you're feeling better soon. Little ones need their mommy all better!
@reflective My daughter started reading them already. :)
@Leighbra We got three, I think.
@reflective And thank you very much for the package. The kids loved it!
@reflective You'll get your after I learn to count. I need another envelope. Oops.
@Leighbra @cassie_d_ape The children loved making them!
Kids so much enjoyed the Valentine's that showed up today. They've fallen apart from being dragged around. Thanks @Leighbra!
@peahdotcom thank you. Prayers are always most appreciated. :)
More than words can say. http://bit.ly/ifBcoC
@jennhoots Yeah, it's been pretty nippy. Down to -8, but it is warming and it looks like we should be above freezing by tomorrow.
6:30 and the sun is brightening the horizon. I believe spring may be in our future.
Maybe I should stoke the fire and start some bread. Or wash the dishes. Wouldn't my Mouse be happy to awaken & find her chore done for her?
Think I'll have a cup of the instant Swiss mocha I created yesterday.
@msmama33 We should be able to do the sandbox this spring. And maybe the talking flowers. We'll see what happens beyond that. :)
Hey, well, I got as far as signing into my blog for this evening's writing goal. About time to wrap it up with zero words written.
Spot where I want to put our apricot tree looks to be a good one. It was the first patch of snow to melt.
@AmberOliver I'd happily pipe some of this excess heat your way...
@butterflysnbees Yum! Maybe I'll do that if I run out of chocolate for family. :)
The most adorablest do it yourself Valentine's ever. http://bit.ly/e5xeGg
@butterflysnbees I guess you know they like Ken Ham. :)
@SeasideTales Thank you for that. I think we've been carried by prayer for the last two months.
@butterflysnbees Makes for a close family. Unless you're on the outside.
@butterflysnbees one in their community & they really feel like they need to be there where they live.
@butterflysnbees Church problems are so hard. We have friends struggling because they feel shut out of their church but it's the only
@butterflysnbees Thank you. :)
@SeasideTales That's such a hard question to answer. :( OK. Baby steps forward with lots of falling down. But right now I'm kind of alright.
@SeasideTales :) Three of mine fell asleep on the couch, but I think they'll likely migrate to my bed later.
@butterflysnbees I was a little worried about that in a small town church. They've all grown up together. But they've been very welcoming.
@SeasideTales I bet a few. I woke up the other day with my husband, four children and two dogs.
@Greek_Momma I have always expressed myself through writing. It's sort of weird now though because so many people I know read my blog.
@butterflysnbees "...those doors, they're ours." They responded like family even though we were just beginning to get to know each other.
@butterflysnbees We don't either. & we just had started going to our church. But as one lady said to my mom, "When someone walks through...
@Greek_Momma There's always someone to talk to, at least. :)
@Greek_Momma Me too. :(
@Greek_Momma somehow should have been able to catch it.
@Greek_Momma She tried to catch the dresser & is probably the reason he lived for 5 hours, at least. I fear she feels guilty. Like she
@butterflysnbees Which may seem random, but it is good to see her really getting into something again.
@butterflysnbees Yeah. I'm glad she's finally talking a little, though. She's getting excited about her chicken flock.
@butterflysnbees and that she doesn't want anyone to cry at her funeral. She wants everyone to be happy she's going to heaven.
@butterflysnbees sometimes it's like it didn't happen. That none of it was real and Mattias wasn't real.
@butterflysnbees It was after Christmas before she said his name. The only thing she's said specifically about how she feels is that
@butterflysnbees He is sweet and sensitive. But I think that helps him a bit. He's very expressive. My eldest doesn't talk about it.
@Greek_Momma ...happened to him before his adoption.
@Greek_Momma My husband is like that, too. He avoids hurtful situations and it comes out as irritability. He doesn't really know what all...
@butterflysnbees moving forward.
@butterflysnbees But he seemed to move through that relatively quickly. I was still waiting to hear about some referrals when he started
@butterflysnbees My son rocking himself because he was afraid of night because that's when the thoughts started really scared me.
@butterflysnbees Yeah, it kind of makes you think of VietNam vets diving under tables, doesn't it?
@butterflysnbees I thought, "I just lost a child. I think that explains 100% of my emotional state just now."
@butterflysnbees I can understand that. Already had one person suggest to my husband to not forget the possibility of post partum.
@Greek_Momma symptoms & such.
@Greek_Momma This is Twitter, hardly a private conversation. :) & I'm trying not to diagnose myself. Just trying to keep an "eye" on
@butterflysnbees It's actually free. But of course we have to get there. & the rest of us need a place to stay. :)

@butterflysnbees Glad you found someone. We have a monthly support group thing the kids really enjoy. & I'm hoping the 2 older ones can
@butterflysnbees I wouldn't have really thought of it much except every Saturday & every time the wind picks up, I get physically ill.
@butterflysnbees No, an inability to handle much of any disruption with many small children is difficult, to say the least.
@butterflysnbees ...the more I seem to cry.
@butterflysnbees That's good. It's all generally getting better around here. At least for the children. The less they need me, however..
@butterflysnbees No one is having nightmares, though. I've had some weird dreams, but no nightmares.
@butterflysnbees ...we all struggle with all of that. & this weird nervous energy that never accomplishes anything.
@butterflysnbees irritability, insomnia, headaches, stomach aches, easily startled, difficulty w/ sounds that remind you of the event...
@butterflysnbees Yeah. I was reading about Post Traumatic Stress when my son was really struggling and it often goes along w/ child loss
@butterflysnbees a lot to do with it.
@butterflysnbees I don't know. It's all so surreal now. My parents had left and we were facing our first night alone. I think that had
@butterflysnbees We pretty much went where we were told to go and did what we were told to do so when we were invited we went. I guess.
@butterflysnbees such a thing. But I struggle so much each day to not snap over little things. I'm always on edge. I apologize over & over.
@butterflysnbees I hate the irritability that comes w/ all this, though. You would think you would be more the person you should be after
@butterflysnbees Their love is spontaneous, their joy is still present. & an older child can be put off. They aren't as needy.
@butterflysnbees I still can't believe we went Christmas caroling but the kids wanted to & there was only one reason not to. So we did.
@butterflysnbees ((I'm so sorry!)) & it is amazing what you can do for your children when you have to. Like Christmas caroling.
@butterflysnbees feeling dead inside. There was no future, no past. Micah flashed one of those smiles, and I couldn't help but smile back.
@butterflysnbees And those smiles. He just started really smiling the week before. I remember sitting on my bed the day Mattias died just
@butterflysnbees anything at all. Because it was that or let him cry.
@butterflysnbees because someone else was here to make sure it happened. The baby was the only one who could pull me out of it enough to do

@butterflysnbees Now he's pretty normal during the day and falls asleep on the couch listening to Odyssey or his mp3 player.
@butterflysnbees They eat fine. And the sleep issue is much better. Bear used to rock himself all day & cry himself to sleep at night.
@butterflysnbees like to join me when they wake up for snuggles. Not really sleep, but not very demanding. And super sweet.
@butterflysnbees It didn't used to. But they're having their own difficulties falling asleep, especially my two oldest. My two little girsl
@butterflysnbees I sleep really well between 4AM and 9AM. So what has been working is late bedtimes so the kids sleep in. :)
@butterflysnbees Trying to live on naps alone here. & trying not to get frustrated w/ insomnia. It only makes it worse.
@butterflysnbees Nope, first time. This is the first time I've done anything for V-Day w/ the kids besides buy clearance chocolate.
@butterflysnbees I bet it felt good at the time, though. :)
@Healthy_Child Organic is when applied to food, but not all the other things out there labeled "organic." Like pesticides. :0

@Leighbra That's cool. Unfortunately, I'm doing good to remember the milk I ran to the store for at the moment. :(
@Leighbra Ha! My husband had to take the SUV to work so we were carless for the last few days. But I think these'll be super cute.
@Leighbra Thanks! & we were able to get all our supplies today, but probably won't get them made until after the mailman comes tomorrow.
