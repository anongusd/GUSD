A common sense solution to reopen government &amp; #SecureOurBorder: 	$800M humanitarian assistance 	$805M detection equipment 	Over 2K new @CBP agents 	New judges to process cases 	New asylum procedures 	$5.7B for strategically placed barriers	3-year extension for DACA &amp; TPS https://t.co/xizS9VMpYK
Like I told @AmericaNewsroom yesterday, the American people are ready for a deal. @POTUS is showing true leadership offering an important deal that will #SecureOurBorder and protect DACA-TPS families. https://t.co/g6TFSCmQqB
.@realDonaldTrump is right: “Our immigration system should be the envy of the world, not a symbol of disunity &amp; disfunction."		@SpeakerPelosi &amp; @HouseDemocrats must come to the table to make a deal that reopens our government and keeps the American people safe!

Thanks in large part to @POTUS giving our servicemembers in combat the tools they need to get the job done, ISIS has been defeated as a caliphate. Now we need to defeat the movement. Would rather ISIS worry about where they’ll sleep at night than how to attack us here at home. https://t.co/gd2iTjiVEN
Instead of jetting off on luxury beach vacations like my Democratic colleagues did last weekend, Members of Congress should stay in Washington to work on a solution to reopen the government. Lock us all in a room until this shutdown gets resolved. https://t.co/E8qmCWYku8
Devastated to hear about the loss of fellow Green Beret, @USArmy Chief Warrant Officer Jonathan Farmer, who leaves behind his wife and 4 young children. Pray for them in this difficult time. 	https://t.co/R2d7tdPHaS

We cannot ignore the fundamental right of an unborn child to live. Abortion is one of the greater tragedies of our generation. And I believe future generations will look back at this era &amp; condemn us for the millions of children we allowed to be taken by it. #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/RJ5PSDfcIY
It’s been nearly 12 years since Bob Levinson was taken hostage in #Iran. We must continue making him &amp; all American hostages abroad a priority in our negotiations. Thankful to Doug &amp; Sarah for meeting with me to share the story of their father, @HelpBobLevinson. https://t.co/8WS4grKogZ

As a Special Forces operator, it always hits close to home when we lose Americans in pursuit of the mission. Thinking of the families of those we lost today. We must fight ISIS with all we have until their hateful ideology is FULLY extinguished. https://t.co/h3dYbD0lHj
