RT @JohnnyRocket113: Spent a little personal time #hiking the North Country Trail in Michigan.  @nctrail #PureMichigan https://t.co/snJrwhx…
@hikewithspike The re-route through there is great! Shooting is the club next door, no danger to the trail, but now they're all out hunting elsewhere!
@AroundMichigan @ThornappleTWP @PureMichigan Beautiful!
@hikewithspike @aliog24 Also in Calhoun County, check the Ott Biological Preserve and Kimball Pines County Park, might be non-hunting areas.
@hikewithspike @aliog24 Through Middleville, try the Paul Henry Thornapple Trail section. A different experience would also be all through Battle Creek.
@hikewithspike @aliog24 Good question! Wear bright orange, avoid early morning and dusk. Try the Trail in County parks, Fallsburgh, Townsend, Seidman in Kent cty
