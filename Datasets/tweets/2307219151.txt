@shawbraiden_ @Richshaw1985 He was not offered 'a couple contracts but decided he was too good for them.' That is false. The Broncos tried to trade for him but he declined when he was with the @49ers. Also he is not below average statistically. So no it is not facts.
@shawbraiden_ @Kaepernick7 While I disagree with the list you just provided it's not the point. The point is there are not 64 better quarterbacks in the NFL right now. @Kaepernick7 should have a job.
@shawbraiden_ @Kaepernick7 Outside of Nick Foles, Tyrod Taylor, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Lamar Jackson, Jacoby Brissett name any other backup quarterback position in the league in which the current seat-filler is better than Kaepernick, who remind you, led a team to a Super Bowl and was seconds away from winning
@shawbraiden_ So Mark Sanchez is a better option that @Kaepernick7 ? 72 career TD passes to 30 INTs and a 60% completion %? I'm sorry but even if you don't think he's a starting quarterback anymore he's still better than most of the backups in the NFL.

RT @69News: Hyman says he'll speak to city council, make case "abundantly clear" https://t.co/7GYip1GFQA
RT @69News: President of the local firefighters union Allentown 302 speaks out against #PTSD in first responders. 	https://t.co/Mu60swaO74
Hyman says he has lost well in excess of $1 million because of this fire. @69News
Hyman also wanted to remind me that he's one of Allentown's biggest taxpayers. "As a city taxpayer, I am very sensitive to our tax dollars being spent and it's no secret I was a mayoral candidate and I ran on the premise that our tax dollars have to be spent wisely." @69News
When asked how he feels about Allentown taxpayers paying $1.25 million for his building to be demolished, he said "I'm going to address that at City Council. I'm not going to address that now because I want the totality of my statement to come out." @69News
Hyman said he knew the risk he was barring, "I never, in a million years, imagined a scenario and frankly I've never heard of a scenario where a government authority, a municipality, a city would enter in to private property and then have to demolish a building." @69News
Hyman had an explanation for why he didn't get insurance. To get insurance on a building like that is vacant like that is near impossible or would cost more than the building itself because of exactly what happened." @69News
Hyman says he's given police a person of interest, motive and potential evidence of the crime. He wouldn't share with us his info citing an ongoing investigation. @69News
Hyman says the building had no electricity, running water, sewage or gas so the fire had to be set intentionally or someone broke in and set it on fire by mistake. "I do (know who may have done this) and I'm working with the police on who I think it is." @69News
Hyman says when he learned the extent of the damage, he was devastated but "to somehow have the Mayor of this city, the media and people on social media make me out to be the villain is absolutely unconscionable, outrageous, offensive and just downright wrong." @69News
Nat Hyman, who owns 418 N. Franklin St. which caught fire Sun., says "this has been an enormous tragedy for me. It has been an enormous tragedy for my company. It has been a huge financial loss. It has been very upsetting and I've never experienced this before." @69News https://t.co/ZXUErPrqSr
We ask first responders to run towards danger without a second thought. However, sometimes it stays with them long after the situation is over. The president of a local firefighters union wants something done about PTSD at the state level. More at 5 on @69News

Schmoyer &amp; Hallman were friends that were "in contact within the hour preceding the incident and immediately up to the incident." Also 4 letters went to family &amp; @AllentownPolice which indicated Schmoyer was to blame for explosion and he wanted to target Hallman, himself &amp; son.

The assistant DA says it will be up to the judge once the evidence is presented at trial which level of homicide Jensen will face whether its  1st, 2nd, 3rd, voluntary or involuntary manslaughter.​ I'll be live at 6 on @69News
A search warrant led to the discovery of the clothes &amp; weapon in his car. 	Jensen admitted to Det. James Bruchak with the Lehigh Co. Homicide Task Force he "had snorted a small line of meth" that morning" and had modified his weapon to make it fire easier.​ (cont) @69News
Investigators say Jensen left in his '03 @Toyota Celica and bought a change of clothes at @marshalls, changed at a Giant and purchased a prepaid cell phone at @verizon. He was later arrested at a @Walmart near Phillipsburg, NJ. (cont) @69News
When he picked her up, he described her right arm as "mush" because he discovered she was shot in the arm and then and it passed into her chest. 	She was taken to hospital where she later died. APD surrounded the house but Jensen was nowhere to be found. (cont) @69News
.@allentownpolice Officer Kyle French says when he arrived, he found Fenstermaker "covered in blood." He says she told him "she had been shot by her boyfriend and he was still in the house." French then had to drag her into an ambulance (cont) @69News
Fenstermaker collapsed outside the home. ​Jensen says he says he didn't want to touch her because he didn't want to cause further injury. Instead, he called a friend to call 911 because someone had been shot in his house.	Jensen then allegedly left. (cont) @69News
Jensen claimed she left in the middle of the night to buy cigarettes &amp; never returned. PD say Jensen admitted the 2 fought w/Jensen accusing Fenstermaker of cheating. But Jensen claims the gun fired accidentally as he was turning away from her to put the gun down. (cont) @69News
