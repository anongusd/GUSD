Key components of the MD Senate Republican tax plan will be heard in the Budget and Taxation Committee today. Senator Andrew Serafini spoke with reporters this morning about the plan and other budget issues Maryland is currently facing. https://t.co/j9HRY9wMEC

When you're dealing with voter integrity, the devil is in the details. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to take the time to do their research on SB 190 and work harder to protect our elections.
"What the bill says, is not what you're saying" @CassillyforMD34
The arguments in favor of SB 190 are not written directly in the bill. All bills should be written clearly, without room for creative interpretation, especially in regards to international election observers. #YouCantMakeThisStuffUp #WeNeedTrueTransparency
"Do you see a difference between, people going into another country to go in and learn about the democratic process, vs. people going into another country to make sure that people are following the democratic process" -@CassillyforMD34
On SB 190: "Where in the the bill does it say anything about federal background checks?" - @JBJenningsUSA  We have no room for any "May, or may not" when it comes to background checks of international election observers.

Thank you to everyone who followed along with our live tweet. Rest assured, we will continue to fight this bill on 3rd reading.
And with that, there are no further amendments. Bill is ordered printed for 3rd reading.
Roll call on Sen. @JustinReady's amendment: 20 yeas, 27 nays. Amendment fails.
Senator @JustinReady also has amendment. His exempts four felonies from the bill: 1st Deg. murder, 1st Deg. rape, agg. assault &amp; carjacking.
Roll call on Sen. Hershey's amendment: 19 yeas, 28 nays. Amendment fails.
Sen. Hershey defends his amendment by pointing out shielding petition from bill passed yesterday could not be submitted until P/P completed.
Sen. Hershey has amendment to revert the bill back to current law and fix the problem of Corrections not communicating w/ Board of Elections
Roll call vote on committee report: 31 yeas, 16 nays.
Sen. Ready says he's concerned about people on P/P who re-register to vote after release then violate and get sent back to prison.
Sen. Hough brings up the 2nd Amendment and asks whether those who support this bill would also support restoring gun rights at the same time
Sen. Raskin: Many rights are restored as soon as one is released from prison--freedom of speech and religion, for example.
Sen. Conway points out that so many are institutionalized and further penalized by losing their right to vote when they get out of prison.
Sen. Cassilly asks whether we are coming at this issue as a social policy change or a change solely for "administrative convenience."
Sen. Hough argues that felons have not fulfilled their debt to society while they are still on P/P--they are still serving their sentence.
Sen. Conway says there's a systemic problem preventing Corrections from communicating w/ the Board of Elections.
The Senate of Maryland has begun to debate a bill to allow ex-felons to vote while on parole/probation. We'll be live tweeting the process.
