Point is, the borders that are being secured, are being secured by people working for free. How is this shutdown about border security you have to ask at this point.		It's not. It's a cover that works.
Tunnels are under the border. The tunnels are for trafficking. The bigger drug dealers use planes. We know that with El Chapo. Water is another great way to get it here. Through it airports are great entries. /2
