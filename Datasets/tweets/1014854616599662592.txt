@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump You’re stupid
@MichaelRCaputo Agreed. Only conspiracy to defraud the USA, money laundering, campaign finance violations, bank fraud, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, emoluments violations, and... the best one of all - #RICO
@TomFitton Another drunk uncle classic. Wonder if the boys in the yard will find him as entertaining. #RICO
@HurdOnTheHill @treywareshow @ktsanews Still waiting for your contrition and apology for signing on with Nunes and his band of obstructionists. Admit you made a mistake and you may make it out of this without the same stain.
@AshaRangappa_ At what point will everyone realize they are all in on this grift? The entire GOP is a criminal enterprise. This is CC with Vanetik aka the guy who ripped off Pavel Fuchs at the Trump inauguration. And it’s from years ago. https://t.co/NHL1ueNbwP
@mschlapp @SidneyPowell1 Too bad most of the CPAC attendees can’t read. Just like your Dear Leader.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Huge growth in GOP criminal exposure. #RICO
@KenDilanianNBC Like your sources in the DOJ telling you things are wrapping up, these people are professional liars. Do better to trust but verify.
@mschlapp Did you have a black person stand on stage in the corner to prove you’re all not racist?
@MichaelRCaputo @dcvacco My take: The RICO moves forward and Trump org is toast. But Cohen did his job protecting the true bosses who don’t live in America. Lanny did his job protecting the family.
@IngrahamAngle @FoxNews That’s because Fox is the only State run news org.
@KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews There is a reason you’re hearing the term RICO more often. It’s going to be a legal dismemberment of the Trump org.
@mattgaetz Did Manafort pal, Yuri Vanetik, give you this information? #Honeypot https://t.co/gj6eT60Uem
@dbongino Another boatload of Hill Republicans are traitors to the USA. We’ll deal with them soon.
@mschlapp CPAC 2020 will need to get temporary release permission from the warden for half of the faculty.
@stphnfwlr @sendavidperdue He can also talk about supporting a Russian mafia owned POTUS. If you’re interested.
@KatyTurNBC This account shows Russian interference is alive and well. And the Russian mafia owned POTUS has done nothing about it.
@kilmeade More propaganda from RT? Hard pass.
@CRPolitical @RepMattGaetz You forgot the malware link, Andrey.
@RepMattGaetz When the mafia knows it is busted it attacks the investigators. GOP crime family is scared. It should be. #RICO
@ShimonPro Thought you knew everything? Guess you don’t.
@Jim_Jordan @OversightDems You scared? You sound scared.
@SecondLady Is that going to be offered along with your conversion therapy?
@MichaelRCaputo Did he smell the traitor on you?
@maggieNYT @jmartNYT Wait. You read old NYT reports? What? That would mean you knew Trump is Russian mafia, but didn’t report it. Hmmm
@SaraCarterDC @literaryeric Russian bots sure like you
@Melinda15858273 @mschlapp @LouDobbs Matt is a Putinbot? I agree.
@mschlapp @LouDobbs You had upper lip sweat. You know you’re in big trouble for showing the cards on the Barr plan. Yuri will be most upset.
@olgaNYC1211 These mobbed up a-holes go back a long time. Lots of laundry done along the way. https://t.co/GqGsOrD25j
@brianstelter @CNNPR She is not an insider, she is a propagandist. Learn the difference.
@mitchellreports @ChrisRuddyNMX Why do you allow people like Ruddy to lie unchecked? Seriously? What is wrong with you?
@SenatorIsakson @telegraphga https://t.co/7LNovzJHzT
@Rep_Hunter @kilmeade @foxnewsradio Looking forward to you going to jail.
@IvankaTrump Can you please stop embarrassing the United States? No one elected you and you should be in jail, not in government. #RICO
@NicolleDWallace When you interview McCabe can you ask him if he thinks Trump and his crew will get away with the crimes they have committed in broad daylight? Like lying on official forms? Thx.
@CynthiaWeston6 @ShimonPro The media has been letting these traitors distract them for over two years. Enough. This is not a joke or a drill. The country is in serious danger.
@KenDilanianNBC @nytimes Heard the gateway pundit has some great articles that may be more to your liking. I think he has the same sources.
@ShimonPro Glad you all think the death of democracy is so funny.
@KatyTurNBC @ckubeNBC Speaking of silence. Anyone heard from Dilanian after his triumphant shout out from Trump?
@RepLoudermilk The FBI has enough evidence to open a counterintelligence investigation into your Dear Leader. Think about that and your place in history supporting him.
@BorisEP @RichardGrenell @USUN Plahotniuc approved we see.
@dfriedman33 You’re welcome https://t.co/PSgwqpMVAm
@dfriedman33 Downing protected the ultra rich when he was a DOJ tax lawyer. Also Russian oligarchs. Go read Lucifer’s Bankers and you’ll know why Downing is involved.
@TrumpTweety He sure is. Scared of all the work he has to do since the Trump/GOP criminal enterprise committed so many crimes. #RICO
@Jim_Jordan You sound scared.
@SenJohnHoeven Coward
@IvankaTrump @usconsmunich @usbotschaft Orange is a good color for you. Need a different style though. Maybe a jumpsuit?
@mschlapp You screwed up yesterday, Matt. Giving away the GOP plan of having Barr take out Mueller implicates you. Care to explain how you know that?
@DonaldJTrumpJr He admitted to doing his job when he realized what you Russian mafia owned chumps were doing. Justice is coming. #RICO
@BorisEP @realDonaldTrump Have you hired a RICO lawyer yet? If not, better hurry before all good ones get taken.
@maggieNYT Who cares what McConnell feared. They own this mess and so do you.
@MuellerSheWrote And makes @KenDilanianNBC look enormously bad.
@RepMarthaRoby Still hoping to get that dirty Russian money from the NRA?
@ShimonPro How do you know it was never understood why? The Mueller team knows why. #MOB
@KenDilanianNBC Did someone hack your phone and turn you into a hack journalist?
@RepDougCollins Keep digging that traitor hole deeper. You are like Devin Nunes 2.0
@dbongino Did you get dropped on your head as a child?
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is from October 2017 chump
@TigerWoods @genesisopen @TGRFound Please tell us you wore a wire during your round with the Russian mafia asset in-Chief. If not, that is a really bad look.
@hughhewitt @SenatorBurr We already have loads of evidence in the public record. Burr needs this outcome because he, like you, are part of the GOP criminal enterprise. #RICO https://t.co/cR44Q49Q6j
@jaketapper @finneyk @BillKristol @kaitlancollins @JFKucinich @TheLeadCNN Hope no one was “stepping on my dick” during this reporting, Jake.
@NoelinSD @mkraju Tell me when this is winning https://t.co/uJOFqdTmBr
@maggieNYT You created this. You normalized this. You own this.
@blakebarron @mattgaetz The new Russian bot accounts seem a lot like the old ones. Where is your malware link though?
@mattgaetz We have a nice cool jail cell ready for you.
@ShimonPro @DanaBashCNN We wouldn’t have to do this if you did a better job holding these criminals to account. https://t.co/3tlpvap2Km
@RepDougCollins It saddens me that you went full traitor at the Whitaker hearing. But here we are.
@BorisEP @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @AOC Hey Boris, I would suggest hiring a good criminal defense lawyer with experience in RICO.
@swann2377 @MarMacUSPatriot @joann_wendlandt @RepDougCollins @Ilhan You’re right. You can’t prove any illegal money was poured into the GOP with a picture. We have subpoenas for that. The pics make it so they can’t lie. https://t.co/i6I6KbUki0
@MarMacUSPatriot @joann_wendlandt @RepDougCollins @Ilhan Sure. https://t.co/GzopKq5NMI
@joann_wendlandt @RepDougCollins @Ilhan Maybe a bot, maybe a concerned citizen bringing receipts? You decide. Doesn’t matter. Justice is coming. #RICO https://t.co/VZPwvvwBp5
@RepDougCollins The level of anti-American behavior being shown by you and the GOP is off the charts. Justice is coming. And neither Whitaker or Barr will save you.
@GOPLeader Republicans are going full traitor today in the Whitaker hearing
@RepDougCollins @TheJusticeDept Hey bud, you went full traitor. Never go full traitor.
@mattgaetz Have you hired good defense counsel yet? Probably need to find those with experience defending people who betrayed their country in service of a hostile foreign criminal organization.
@hughhewitt The ones you hope will keep you and the GOP criminal enterprise out of jail?
@AlanDersh @SethAbramson Why does Roger Stone make these accusations? https://t.co/0JN5ypDh74
@mattgaetz Sorry, Matt. She shouldn’t have said that. We’ll stick to asking you why your friend Yuri keeps getting in trouble with Trump’s friends like Elliott Broidy and Pavel Fuks. Why can’t the GOP crime family get along? https://t.co/cDS7riXbxM
@mschlapp Matt is Fuks up. Also - why did Yuri make Pavel sit so far away at Trump’s inauguration after taking $200K? https://t.co/be7ABlcVi1
@RepMattGaetz @KennedyNation @AOC Can you also talk about your upcoming indictment? Shoot, I don’t think I was supposed to tell you about that, but oh well.
@TheJusticeDept Does anyone at the Justice Department care that protecting Whitaker from telling the truth does immense and potentially irreversible damage to the rule of law? Or is that the intent of the Trump appointees?
@StephaniBaker Not sure if you realize how big a scoop the Vanetik connection is. He is a player in larger GOP circles. Well done. https://t.co/tUuWrTrfdb
@RandPaul @ZOA_National @MortonAKlein7 This is a much better picture https://t.co/ZzcIAoqaXL
@mattgaetz Heads up, Matt. This is not going to end well for you. Better hire a good criminal defense lawyer before all of your co-conspirators get all the best ones first. https://t.co/eyGEcMFV2z
@marcorubio Look Marco, your friend Yuri is in the news again. Good for him.		https://t.co/MD4Vx5DTpX
@TomFitton Sure about that Tommy? https://t.co/mWX5DqQXGZ
@GOPLeader Hey Kevin - can we have a word with you? https://t.co/BUa8akicbw
@olgaNYC1211 Rudy and Vanetik go way back as well. https://t.co/oXax1AVbO4
@WendySiegelman Once the MSM finds McClatchy’s articles on Vanetik and understand the scope of his GOP connections and influence this is going to get interesting. @maddow @MaddowBlog
@TheJusticeDept Just stop. Do you know how much damage you’re doing?
@costareports @AOC Notable that the MSM has failed this test so badly. It allowed propaganda to take over.
@KenDilanianNBC You actually care about fact checking?? That’s rich.
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump People in the military look appropriately disgusted by the GOP criminal enterprise.
@Omy19703647 @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/DzJsVObB23
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Victory is stopping the GOP crime family
@KenDilanianNBC A report does not end pending cases. Why is the entire MSM so ignorant to how court cases work? Someone has to see these cases through. No way Mueller just closes up shop. Stupid to even suggest it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr We’ve had about enough of you. Jail awaits.
@HurdOnTheHill We also need elected officials who won’t carry Devin Nunes water and put country over party. You failed that test, Will.
@IvankaTrump would you like a subpoena?
@jonkarl Weren’t you on TV a few weeks ago saying none of this has touched Trump or the campaign? You need to read more.
@RepMikeTurner @MSNBC @Morning_Joe Remember when you signed off on Devin Nunes “report”? We do. And it was an attempt at obstruction of justice. History will not be your friend.
@maggieNYT Makes you wonder why the entire GOP establishment is afraid of Mueller’s report. Probably because they are all crooks. #RICO
@seanhannity You?
@matthewamiller #RICO is coming for the GOP criminal enterprise
@jaketapper @CNN Is there an act that stops journalists from working with paid contributors to disseminate propaganda?
@MissAmerica1st @dbongino @seanhannity отлично
@NicolleDWallace @jheil That was awesome. Every journalist can learn from the way Heilman held him to account.
@dbongino @seanhannity Will your Russian bots be watching? You’re very popular with those.
@harrylitman CC: @matthewamiller @KenDilanianNBC @mattzap - this is what a smart take looks like. If you disagree, come with reasoning, not hunches and Trump affiliates sources.
@KenDilanianNBC @mattzap @11thHour People who have zero insight into Mueller agree with person who has zero insight into Mueller.
@brianstelter @GovMikeHuckabee @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews @TBN No mistake. Huckabee is a liar and taught his kids to lie as well.
@GovMikeHuckabee You’re still a moron
@GovMikeHuckabee You’re a moron
@MichaelRCaputo You may want to make sure you’re clean shaven on Thursday evenings for the next few weeks.
@dbongino Why is your website link consistently tweeted by Russian troll accounts?
@KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews So you take Wikileaks at its word and seriously doubt Buzzfeed. Hmmm...
@MichaelRCaputo @MichaelSteele Give him the Gusinsky treatment.
@WendySiegelman Good theory. That would explain why they are fighting it so hard. It may expose a large part of Russia’s network of operatives.
@mitchellreports No. Because they answer more to Deripaska than Trump. It’s not that complicated to see the Russian mob owns the GOP.
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Only by McClatchy and Buzzfeed.
@BLaukaitis @marklevinshow They may even have a version of this in Russian so you can read it in your native language. https://t.co/PKgIdK63xu
@marklevinshow He’s not a terrorist. He’s a Russian mafia owned criminal.
@PhilaPhans @KenDilanianNBC Totally agree. The MSM has allowed itself to get pushed around by professional propaganda peddlers.
@KenDilanianNBC This doesn’t really clear anything up. They need to be more specific as Buzzfeed is standing by its reporting.
@KThomasDC @SenGillibrand Iowa elected Chuck Grassley and Steve King. They are not smart enough to follow the Mueller probe. Also gave us that moron Matt Whitaker.
@JPTyra2 @ScottMStedman Pence is pals with Greitens and hired dark money specialist and now missing person Nick Ayers. Also, Pence was hand picked by Manafort. He’s part of the GOP crime family. President Pelosi is what needs to happen.
@JPTyra2 @ScottMStedman Not much to see there. Only a Russian running a major ad fraud scheme on the servers of the company named in the Steele Dossier (Webzilla) who has previously been defended by the same lawyers representing the company in the Buzzfeed case. All very normal...
@DonaldJTrumpJr We know you put mobbed up lawyer @LannyDavis out to do this sort of disinformation. And to use his lies in exactly this way.
@GlennThrush Who’s fault is that? Probably the media moths who’ve chased every shiny object these propaganda experts have tossed out.
@hughhewitt @axios @jonathanvswan @BuzzFeed John Dean told the truth. Unlike you, Hugh.
@KatyTurNBC Lanny Davis is a mafia lawyer. Media would be wise to treat him as such.
@emilyjanefox @DonaldJTrumpJr will be in jail very soon.
@ZoeTillman @KenDilanianNBC your sources are lying. Spend more time finding out why and less time spreading their propaganda.
@DevinNunes Did you act surprised when you were told Trump was a Russian asset? Did you let the @FBI know you are as well or did they find out when you started obstructing justice?
@mattharan @TheB_sKnees @jonkarl @ThisWeekABC Mueller has already laid out that Trump campaign officials worked with the Russians. Why is the MSM so bad at this? https://t.co/vT7wBqQrAI
@HurdOnTheHill @SenatorTimScott You also agreed with Devin Nunes. You don’t get to take that back unless you publicly state tomorrow that you made a mistake and support Schiff.
@marcorubio Still pushing Kremlin generated talking points, Little Marco? We’ll flag this for future use when taking to down the GOP criminal enterprise. #RICO
@SaraCarterDC #RICO is coming for #GOPtraitors
@MichaelRCaputo Here is a fact. You are going to jail
@MichaelRCaputo Why were Russian bots pushing for Trump? Oh, you know. You work for Russia
@MichaelRCaputo #RICO
@GOP @GOPLeader Kevin - we have some questions https://t.co/SiALl0SaYV
@ScottShaneNYT Nice story - missed a few. https://t.co/I9AMwU13dG
@KenDilanianNBC “Not just...” so you are using Toensing/Futerfas/Lowell/Rudy for sourcing? None are credible.
@dbongino Dotard’s propaganda fell flat. Move on to your next Kremlin pushed talking point.
@Rep_Hunter @dagenmcdowell @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness The only security you need to concern yourself with is maximum or minimum.
@SaraCarterDC @IWF Can you fill us in on what Trump was sniffing?
@TomFitton @DHSgov @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @JudicialWatch You’re a special interest tool.
@RepMoBrooks @VP @SecNielsen The GOP is the National Security threat. Your lies and corruption are about to be completely exposed.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump You’d think Republicans would put the USA over Russia, but the fact is they don’t.
@JaySekulow @ACLJ Jay - make sure you and the Raskins practice how to redact. You have many filings ahead of you. #Incoming #RICO
@GOP @VP The only crisis is having a criminal enterprise running the country. #RICO
@KenDilanianNBC Not done, Ken. Not even close. It takes a long time to put this many traitors in jail.
@Isikoff @YahooNews The Steele Dossier reads like a table of contents for the Trump Presidency. Kill TPP, damage NATO, weaken western alliances, etc. What in the hell are you talking about? You really need to see a pee tape before you understand Steele’s sourcing was solid?
@Isikoff @DavidCornDC @SkullduggeryPod You need to stop your lazy reporting that fuels this moron. Many specific allegations from the Dossier have been proven and more will be soon.
@Isikoff @GenFlynn Your lazy reporting caused you to become a pawn of a compromised Russian asset.
@simonamangiante @DeannaLorraine7 @RealOmarNavarro Omar’s pal Roger Stone couldn’t make it? Probably too busy admitting he is a liar and preparing to be indicted. https://t.co/0jfBxNkbS1

@mschlapp So you think you’re good on this? You are not.		https://t.co/sVQc1gPsPl
@brianstelter @GStephanopoulos Did the source tell you the reason SDNY laid the wood is because Cohen would flip on Trump but not on Russian mafia?
@maggieNYT Hint: It did
@kayleighmcenany @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox Was that paid for with inauguration money?
@GovMikeHuckabee @LasVegasNFR A better tribute to the military would be getting the Russian mafia owned tool out of the White House.
@MichaelRCaputo @GenFlynn Was that before or after he tried to assist the Turks in killing Gulen?
@jasoninthehouse @SebGorka @seanhannity @FoxNews Dumb and Dumber
@SecretaryPerry @masrour_barzani We know you’re crooked like the rest of this criminal enterprise in the Trump admin. We’ll get to you eventually.
@MittRomney His inability to hold the Russian stooge accountable is his only legacy. Will it be yours as well?
@KThomasDC Can we get this over with and drop the real hammer? #RICO
@wisecroneknows @stevenmnuchin1 @Paschald @OECD Laundering money by Mnuchin using US shell companies mostly through movies? For sure.
@stevenmnuchin1 @Paschald Talk about any Irish shell companies used to launder money?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Can you hear that? The sound of unsealing your indictment? Soon little guy, really soon.
@MichaelAvenatti @AlanDersh Roger Stone seems to know something. Claims Dersh joined in. https://t.co/dSrpS6GfFW
@JonLemire The Trump rubes won’t understand RICO either. They will understand the pile of ash left of the Trump Org when we finish.
@SecretaryRoss I’m thinking about taking my Euro Wagon to do some India Asset Recovery. Any advice from WLR?
@MichaelRCaputo Difference is Edwards didn’t launder money for Russian mafia, so we’ll add a little thing called RICO to the 20 other charges. Buckle up. This isn’t going to pleasant for the GOP crime family.
@dbongino Your bot game is strong, Dan. Might need @FBI to look into why that is.
@MichaelRCaputo @PamelaBrownCNN Don’t forget about this. #RICO 		See you and the rest of the “enterprise” really soon. https://t.co/GrfPfZxg08
@realDonaldTrump The percent chance your family and business are charged with Racketeering... 100%

@dbongino Rudy’s off his meds again.
@MichaelRCaputo Do you want to go to jail in Florida or New York?
@mschlapp So you think it’s OK to break the law as long as someone else broke the law? Hmmm... good to know.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump No, it’s a proper application of the rule of law in the United States of America. Move to Russia if you want a banana republic dictator. We are done with your nonsense.
@jasoninthehouse @seanhannity @FoxNews Just because you quit your job doesn’t mean we haven’t been investigating you. Crooked is crooked.
@justinjm1 This is the second bad take from you today. Feel free to take the rest of the day off to regroup and try again tomorrow.
@justinjm1 Not true. That could involve a National Security investigation and Mueller didn’t need it for this.
@realChristophS @MichaelRCaputo @SaraCarterDC @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump Why is he still doing it?
@replouiegohmert @davidwebbshow @SiriusXMPatriot You should talk about racketeering. And you should retain counsel for obstruction of justice.
@MichaelRCaputo @SaraCarterDC @KimStrassel @realDonaldTrump The FBI has had a file on you going back decades. That tends to happen when you work for a hostile foreign government. If you think most of the intel driving this investigation has only been collected since 2016 you’re a bigger moron than we previously thought.
@SpeakerRyan @pkcapitol @washingtonpost How about you get vets the money you owe them instead?
@mschlapp Kids today will be constitutional scholars when we get done taking down the GOP crime family. #RICO

@thomasafine @ivelinmarkovski @NatashaBertrand If you add Nastra to the search there are news articles about this but not much else. Still possible as the allegations are very similar to Methbot.
@ivelinmarkovski @NatashaBertrand Cool. Thank you
@ivelinmarkovski @NatashaBertrand Is Gukov or Zhukov proper translation?
@ivelinmarkovski @NatashaBertrand Good to know. Thanks
@NatashaBertrand “Alexander G.” AKA Alexej Gubarev??? Steele dossier tech firm has large presence in Dallas and tied to other ad fraud schemes.
@kaype86 @NatashaBertrand Tech company named in Steele dossier has large presence in Dallas and connected to other ad fraud schemes like Methbot.
@MichaelRCaputo I know someone else who lied under oath...
@MichaelRCaputo @MarcACaputo 8) Caputo goes to jail for conspiracy against the USA and lying to Congress.
@GOPLeader Are you thanking Americans or Russians when you say “our” - guessing Russia
@GovMikeHuckabee @HuckabeeOnTBN Did you doctor that video too?
@Olivianuzzi Probably Isgur Flores. She’s Claremont Institute alumni like a lot of other corrupt Trump crime family.
@brithume Yep. Don’t ever trust the Hill. Also, don’t trust Fox News. I think Gateway Pundit handles programming there.
@StopGridLockPgh @MarkMeadows Hmmm... so many choices. Probably start with Wilbur, Stone, Don Jr. and work from there. #RICO will be fun. https://t.co/BFVdUcHhAv

@ajs8050 @mattgaetz @LaraLeaTrump @PamBondi There should be no such thing as tourist hunting and we should spend our time, money and influence trying to protect animals. If you think it’s OK to kill some animals to protect others... ughhh
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Have you uncovered why DOJ gave Cohen a pass on everything except RICO? I would not want to be part of that criminal enterprise. #Scaife https://t.co/tEO0gtyzV2
@dbongino @seanhannity You guys should talk about RICO. You should also retain counsel familiar with defending those who are part of a criminal enterprise. https://t.co/At6IodLLoC
@LindseyGrahamSC You going to do that thing where you get all red and lie? What does Russia have on you anyway?
@ajs8050 @mattgaetz @LaraLeaTrump @PamBondi Start here and stop making excuses for murderers. If no one killed the animals and instead donated to protect them - problem solved. https://t.co/fCcbBnKsSq
@ajs8050 @mattgaetz @LaraLeaTrump @PamBondi You’re a disgusting human being. Seriously. Instead of killing animals how about make a donation and go home?

@Scavino45 This is such a great tweet from the GOP candidate for Lt. Governor https://t.co/UvIYyglloP
@labeast54 @TomFitton @FoxNews @JudicialWatch Wait for it... https://t.co/YlEdzQtXdM
@TomFitton @FoxNews @JudicialWatch Better hope he doesn’t start digging into you... go read his House testimony again. He knows all about GOP/Russian mafia ties. So does Mueller.
@emilyjanefox You missed an option. Cohen’s plea deal is sealed. #RICO
@MichaelRCaputo @AC360 @andersoncooper Has @CNN gotten to work on the disclaimer you worked for Putin? Seems like bad journalism if they don’t disclaim that. Would hate for more egg on their face like @ABCInvestigates and their awful Simona piece.
@Jim_Jordan Prosecute people like you, Gym Jordan? OK - we’re good with that.
@MichaelRCaputo Caputo doesn’t like when it’s pointed out that @CNN and @MSNBC should add a disclaimer to his appearances that he worked for Putin. And it seems he still does. https://t.co/LTorwzCPX5
@MichaelRCaputo Still Russia, we know corrupt Netanyahu works with Putin. Nice try, traitor. Only 38% of America is stupid enough to believe your nonsense.
@DanaBashCNN @jaketapper Instead of Santorum being on can you please just post Kremlin talking points on the CNN website? At least then we don’t have to listen to him.
@mschlapp @CarolLeonnig @FBI I really hope @CarolLeonnig saw this. DM me for more.	https://t.co/sVQc1gPsPl

@KenDilanianNBC Most honorable mob owned gambling addict ever.
@jimsciutto This is the GOP. They own this.
@BorisEP @nytimes @realDonaldTrump If you think this is the last report on Trump’s financial crimes you are a Russian asset. Oh wait, you are a Russian asset. Just get ready for the real deal. #RICO https://t.co/u7iBm84Ikm
@jonathanvswan I’d be really cautious about @jonathanvswan claims
@TomFitton Make sure you Boof
@KenDilanianNBC @realDonaldTrump And then consider what Mueller has...
@kilmeade @foxandfriends Ian Prior literally works for “Company A” in a Mueller indictment. FNC = state run media.
@MichaelRCaputo @maggieNYT Shut up, Putin puppet. https://t.co/GLMDwNecbt
@RepMattGaetz Interesting you’re beating this drum all of the sudden. Learn something on the yacht in Newport Beach?
@LindseyGrahamSC Trying to save yourself when it comes out that you took money from Russia and they have your emails? Good luck...
@brithume Right. The GOP should be called by their proper name: traitors

@LannyDavis @LindseyGrahamSC Lindsey is paid by Blavatnik and you’re paid by Firtash. No one should trust any statement either of you bad faith individuals make. #MuellerKnows
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump That’s not how FISA works, moron. Keep running your mouth though and we’ll keep locking up traitors.
@chucktodd @RepAdamSchiff @AlanDersh Can you ask Dersh why Roger Stone thinks he is part of Epstein’s crew? https://t.co/YybS6RNQNN

@stampsfaninsask @Bro_Pair @brianstelter Just prepare to hear a lot about RICO in the next year.
@stampsfaninsask @Bro_Pair @brianstelter I literally hashtagged the name of the documentary that lays it all out. JFC.
@MichaelRCaputo @CNNnewsroom Hope they ask you about your NDA and prior work for Putin! That would be real journalism.
@brianstelter How about breaking the news that Trump is an agent of Russia and is owned by the Russian mafia? #ActiveMeasures
@kenvogel @TheJusticeDept This is the aspect of the story the NYT decides to focus on... JFC, why not just change the name to NYRT.
@SteveKingIA How about we just stick with calling you what you definitely are: Traitors https://t.co/3svf5fEotK
@maggieNYT Have you watched Active Measures yet?
@dfriedman33 Agreed. @benjaminwittes makes a very stupid argument here. If Kavanaugh knowingly lied, it doesn’t matter if he is smart or stupid. Ben needs to learn how mafia handle people who owe them money for being bad at throwing dice.

@AshleyRParker @WSJ If the person who wrote it denies doing it the deal with NY Times should be off.
@hughhewitt @seungminkim @KamalaHarris Bizarre?? Wrong. It’s revealing. Clearly someone at Kasowitz talked to BK about how he’ll rule on the Mueller probe. Traitors gotta do what they do - like Hugh.

@SenatorRisch @SenJohnMcCain Do you wonder why McCain didn’t want the current President anywhere near his funeral services? He knows Trump is a traitor and so do you. But will you do something? Probably not, which also makes you a... traitor.
@dfriedman33 Can you ask Dersh why Roger Stone thinks he is a pedofile? Thanks. https://t.co/7RRx0HYGtw
@FBI Chris - we all know what the biggest threat is. Iron triangle has laid siege upon the United States. Hope you’re up for it.

@Jthomps27926399 @jdawsey1 @maggieNYT Just like with the Epstein case, there are some very rich and powerful people who are tied up in this. They’ll do anything to muddy the waters and keep the truth from coming out.
@jdawsey1 @maggieNYT Davis also said Cohen was never in Prague. Another piece of information not to take his word on.
@jdawsey1 @maggieNYT Some of us tried to warn you when this was announced. Davis is not on the up and up. https://t.co/R9O2sW7Jta
@jdawsey1 @thamburger @PostRoz We told you not to trust Lanny. He also said Cohen was never in Prague. Pretty clear he lied about that as well. Hope Mueller pops Davis too.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Let me get this straight. Lanny comes out and lies so you can call him a liar. @FBI This seems coordinated. Lanny must have also lied about Cohen not being in Prague. Glad we all agree he is a liar.

@dbongino Are you saying this because John was previously on the payroll? Seemed like he was. Any additional info on that will be appreciated. Let us know.

@maggieNYT How do you write this story and not mention Firtash. Disgraceful
