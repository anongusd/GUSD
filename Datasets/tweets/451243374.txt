@Olderwiser4 @NumbersMuncher If you really believe you can build a 234-mile wall in under a month, as your tweet clearly states, you are truly some combination of ignorant and delusional.  YOU get YOUR head out of YOUR ass!!
@Olderwiser4 The much larger, more pressing, actual/real emergency is the lack of sensible gun control in the US.  And I’m a gun owner.
@Olderwiser4 @realDonaldTrump Of course we need a level playing field! I never said otherwise! Tariffs on imported goods do get their attention by reducing demand for their products. It’s regrettable that lemmings like you believe the billions in tariffs are being paid by the Chinese. Think for yourself!

@PeterDawsonUSA @thehill So, @PeterDawsonUSA, are you suggesting Mueller and his team should reveal elements of an ongoing investigation as details unfold?  And I suppose the dozens of indictments of so many criminals in Trump’s circle are just Fake News items, huh?

@LASCSFT @senatemajldr @SenMajLdr Leader McConnell and Leader Pelosi have the votes to overturn a Trump veto. Leader Pelosi would clearly take the vote to the House. This leaves cowardly Leader McConnell, who won’t budge, because 1) he believes Trump’s lies and/or 2) he’s afraid Trump will call him nasty names!
@senatemajldr Dear Leader McConnell:  YOU know very well YOU have the votes to over-ride a Trump veto!  Please open the government now!  YOU are rapidly losing support in your own party!  YOU are hurting innocent Americans and risking our lives with this dangerous game you are playing!

@Yagtabkdingme8 @SenatorCollins Republican congress members are obviously very afraid of Trump.  Very few, if any, have the guts to stand up to him on this and other important, moral issues.  Are they abandoning basic human decency merely because they don’t want Trump to call them unpleasant names?

@ananavarro As difficult as it is at times, I think we should do our best to avoid stooping to Trump’s shockingly-low, in-the-gutter level.  The challenge will be taking the high road while not sounding self-righteous and holier-than-thou.  Seems to be a better way to maintain credibility.
@lsutigerzfan @moonshadow1900 @ABC I think I just hurt myself trying to think of one statement that was accurate.  Even his classic “I tell the truth when I can,” wasn’t true, since he’s told lies when he could easily have just told the truth.
@Tenayaway @ABC Too true — and extremely disturbing.
@ejls1 @ABC @realDonaldTrump He was lying way before he started his campaign.  All you need to do is ask his contractors and subcontractors.  And, in “The Art of the Deal,” didn’t he claim lying is an effective negotiation strategy?
@SaraEisen Thank you Sara.  I’ve been following you since your days with Bloomberg.  You’re obviously very smart — and you know your stuff.  I’ve always admired the way you can think on your feet.  Please keep up the great work!
