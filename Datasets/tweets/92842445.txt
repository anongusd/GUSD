Updated story on Althea Greene being appointed to the SCS school board. https://t.co/nuDR01l7KJ
Commission votes for ordinance on third reading. It will go to a fourth reading next month.
Now on the pre-k ordinance, the commission is likely going to make amendments to it meaning it will go to a fourth reading next month.
Initial story on her appointment. More to come. https://t.co/nuDR01l7KJ
The vote for Greene is unanimous.
Althea Greene is voted by the commissioners to be the next school board member.
Daniels withdraws from the appointment.
The four nominees are making their final cases to the commission before the vote.
Motion dies on a lack of second.
Morrison wants to defer the appointment to give Daniels more time to address his residency issues.
Sawyer joins him in that request.
Commissioner Lowery asks Daniels to step aside ‚Äúout of respect‚Äù to the work he‚Äôs done.
Commissioner Wright asks Daniels several times where he will sleep the next time in Memphis in reference to his multiple addresses. Daniels dodges the question.
Commissioner Brandon Morrison nominated Daniels.
Also, the address on the application isn‚Äôt within the district. Commissioners are also pointing out that he has voted outside of district 2 in prior elections with the address on the application.
He says his driver‚Äôs license address has an address within the district but his voter id has an address outside of the district. Says he owns multiple properties in the area.
Daniels was one of the six candidates disqualified because his residency was not in the district. He‚Äôs speaking to commissioners now.
Aubrey Howard, Charles McKinney, Althea Greene and Tyree Daniels (a new candidate) were all nominated by the commission.
Sawyer also speaks on the importance of the vote. She's one of three commissioners (Lowery and Brooks) whose district is part of the School Board District 2 seat.
Commissioners are speaking now. Billingsley praises all four candidates, and calls today's vote one of the most critical it'll have as a body.
Another speaks in support of McKinney, and the final speaker in support of Greene.
We've heard from five of the seven speakers for public comment so far. Four have been in support of Charles McKinney and the other in support of Althea Greene

The commission‚Äôs education committee will not recommend a nomination today. The commission will vote on the appointment Monday.
We‚Äôre hearing from commissioners now, Ford Jr. said he would like to see an educator as the next school board member because they‚Äôve been there and done that.
Asked who he considers the stakeholders in SCS, he says almost everyone should be that they are in one way or another.
The final candidate is Charles McKinney. He says if he‚Äôs appointed he will join ‚Äúin the beautiful struggle‚Äù of attempting to give a quality education to every child.
Aubrey Howard is the third candidate. He says he sees plenty of opportunity for the interim appointement to make a difference.
She also says it‚Äôs important the commission and the school board are on the same page moving forward.
Greene says it‚Äôs important to prepare students to enter the workforce.
Althea Greene is up next. She says Destination 2025 must become a reality, because graduation rates need to increase in the district.
He says three biggest issues facing SCS in the next few years are addressing inequity, charter school influx, and finding stability among top leadership following Hopson‚Äôs departure.
Erskine Gillespie is the first candidate up. He tells commissioners he has a proven track of working with and for youth.
The commission has started discussing appointing a new SCS school board member. Only 4 of the 10 who applied live in the district.
@hdreaves I‚Äôll have to check back on your first question. On your second one, there has been little discussion in committee about that beyond data from SCS showing 51 percent of students are ready for kindergarten and pre-k expansion is a remedy for that.

Here are the highlights of Mayor Harris' first State of the County address including economic development, his MATA plan and criminal justice reform. https://t.co/g20FvKXqD6
In closing, Harris says BHM shows anyone can be an agent of change and you don‚Äôt have to be an elected official to move things along.
Harris pushes for the next Youth Justice &amp; Education Center to have fewer beds than the current facility.
Harris highlights the Shelby County Youth Assessment Center pilot program, which the county commission and other stakeholders unanimously approved.
Harris says the county is moving away from detention for youth and more toward rehabilitation services.
Harris has spent the past few minutes talking about criminal justice reform. He says the county will soon unveil a public safety assessment tool.
More on his plan: he says it will be a phase-in approach. Look for the county‚Äôs investment in MATA to increase over time if it happens.
Harris again calls for more investment in MATA and says he will present a plan later this year that if approved will see the county invest in public transit for the first time.
Harris says his administration will push for more investment in the office of re-entry.
Harris on economic development: focus should shift from discussing tax incentives/breaks for private businesses to more investment in workforce development.
Harris highlights some of the county‚Äôs achievements since taking office including movement on countywide pre-k expansion and pushing for more public employees to be paid a living wage.
Harris calls Shelby County ‚ÄúThe Heart of America.‚Äù Says a lot of places throughout the country want to emulate the county.
The mayor also thanks all the commissioners individually for their efforts since taking office.
Harris starts his speech by thanking his family and county employees.
.@MayorLeeHarris is set to give his first State of the County address soon. I‚Äôll be tweeting updates through his speech.

RT @dailymemphian: The Shelby County Commission voted Monday against Memphis Stone &amp; Gravel's request to build a 173-acre mining site in Ro‚Ä¶
üëÄ https://t.co/3dqFlZuafB
The commission rejects the permit request 8-1. Milton the only commissioner to vote yes.
Morrison made a motion to refer this back to committee to get more info. It fails 9-2.
Commissioner Wright says on what he‚Äôs heard tonight he‚Äôd be for granting the permit, but he is likely to trust Mills and vote against it because it‚Äôs her district. Says he‚Äôs taking a leap of faith.
Now we‚Äôre hearing from the commission, Commissioner Mills says she‚Äôs been eating, breathing and living this discussion since she took office (the proposed mine is in her district). Says benefits do not outweigh the costs.
Former Commissioners Heidi Shafer and Terry Roland are back to voice their opposition for Memphis Stone &amp; Gravel Company‚Äôs request.
The argument for the opposition is largely their quality of life would be affected in addition to decreasing property values and traffic concerns.
Now we‚Äôre hearing from the opposition. Background is being given on Memphis Stone &amp; Gravel‚Äôs prior unsuccessful attempts to get the permit.
Jay Mayburn, who works at Memphis Stone &amp; Gravel, says if the permit isn‚Äôt approved the company may have to move to Mississippi, the county will lose that revenue and jobs there will be effected.
Office of planning and development, which recommended to approve the gravel mine, is making its case among other things that property values would not go down. Property values is a key concern for many of the Rosemark residents.
Now onto the gravel mine...
Joint county, city pre-k ordinance passes on second reading. 	https://t.co/4tg2QfKNNF
James Rout III has been appointed as the new historian for the next 6 years.
Since Wednesday the county has added William Patton as a candidate. James Rout III and Joseph Lowry are the other contenders.
Consent agenda is passed. Next up is the commission picking the county‚Äôs new historian.
Breathing techniques session is complete. Back to the meeting, there are 46 for the gravel mine. Turner decides to allow both sides 10 speakers for this item.
Before all that though, we‚Äôre starting this meeting off with a breathing session as part of the mayor‚Äôs healthyshelby19‚Äô initative.
There are 70 speaker cards for residents against the mine. Commission still waiting to see how many are for the mine.

@chipwilliamsjr Asensio or Isco would be great gets but I don‚Äôt think either would happen. I think Felipe Anderson would be a good replacement for Hazard.
@theRealHrdlicka @chipwilliamsjr I think that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre going after Hazard because there isn‚Äôt that obvious striker they can go after. His style of play isn‚Äôt perfect for RM, but I think they sell Bale and sign a striker this summer to try and make it work. Like you said though, idk who is really out there.
@chipwilliamsjr I agree apart from winning the UCL he‚Äôs done everything we could‚Äôve asked from him. I think they‚Äôll go for another young winger rather than a more experienced one.
@__adel11 I agree. I feel like the transfer fee is the only way they can screw this up.
@__adel11 I thought he would leave after we finished 10th tbh, so the fact we got three more seasons from him is enough for me.

Commission approves the $50 million loan for Union Row parking garages. Sawyer the lone abstention.
The commission votes 11-0 to allocate funding for the new center. Commissioners Ford and Sawyer were the two abstentions.
Harris making one last push for the center before the commission votes on funding. Says the vast majority of the youth who go to the center will return to society and the county needs to put them on a path to rehabilitation.
The commission votes 5-1 against adding detention to the name (on a temporary basis). There were six abstentions. The commission will soon vote on allocating the funding for the facility.
The commission is about to vote on further name changes. The name is now the Youth Justice and Education Center. Some commissioners want to add ‚Äúdetention‚Äù to the new name.
Commissioner Ford Jr. agrees with Sawyer‚Äôs stance that he‚Äôs not there yet as far as supporting a new facility.
Commissioner Sawyer says while the current facility‚Äôs conditions are deplorable she is not satisfied with the overall discussion on the systemic issues at juvenile court.
Change of plans. The commission will move up item 28 so they can vote on amending the budget and funding the center at the same time.
Memphis NAACP branch president Deidre Malone is speaking of her and the group‚Äôs support of Harris‚Äô request for a new center.
Chairman Van Turner said the commission will move down the item which is listed as no. 6 on the agenda so that it can be next to the vote on funding the center which is item 28.
The County Commission is now discussing transferring $1.3 million from its discontinued sewer system plan for the new Juvenile Justice and Education Center. The commission will vote on approving the funds later on.

The commission recommended allocating $1.3 million in capital improvement funding for the new detention facility. The commission will vote again on the resolution Monday.
Mayor Harris says he believes the county will pay, regardless of the cost, to eventually get the final two DOJ monitors reports. To this point, the county has received one report from monitor Sandra Simkins.
@winstondakid I spoke too soon on Michael he sent a letter to the commission ahead of time saying why he wouldn‚Äôt attend. https://t.co/v2A5o2EdRp
Also should note due to "scheduling conflicts" Judge Dan Michael and Shelby County DA Amy Weirich are not in attendance today.
Sheriff Floyd Bonner, who is also in attendance, says a new detention facility is a high priority.
Mayor Harris has highlighted several areas of focus during his first few months in office about juvenile court including proposing a hiring of a panel coordinator and key appointments to the countywide juvenile justice consortium.
The County Commission will shortly have its discussion with key stakeholders on finding a "programmatic plan" for the new juvenile justice and education facility. It's scheduled to last 45 minutes.
General gov't chairman Mark Billingsley sends the resolution without a recommendation to give commissioners more time to take in what they've just heard.  They will vote on Alexander's appointment Monday.
In the last committee meeting, the recommendation for Alexander was deferred after concerns from several past and present employees. Today the first three people to speak have all spoken favorably of Alexander.
The Commission is now discussing the appointment of Anthony Alexander as Director for the Division of Corrections. There are 14 people who have requested to speak on this item.
The County Commission has started the process of appointing an interim school board member to replace departing member Teresa Jones. The Commission will likely pass a resolution setting interviews for the position Feb. 6.

Correction the vote was 9-4. Turner, Bradford, Brooks and Wright voted against the delay.
The commission votes 10-3 to delay a vote on allocating $1.3 million for the new facility. Commissioners will discuss the item in committee next Wednesday.
Commissioner Wright says he understands the concerns of the commissioners but doesn‚Äôt understand what a delay does unless a new center isn‚Äôt needed.
Several commissioners are wanting to refer the resolution back to committee to analyze the county‚Äôs strategy on this.
Commissioner Sawyer says she believes they‚Äôre moving too fast and wants a better relationship with the commission, administration, DA‚Äôs office and juvenile court.
Chairman Turner is moving to add an amendment which would apply the new LOSB and MWBE ordinances changes to level the playing field because the RFQ for the project went out in November and the funds are just now being voted on.
Commissioner Morrison says that while a new facility may be the fiscal responsible choice she wants the new youth assessment center to take precedence over the new detention facility.
RT @bdriesdm: Politics Podcast: Billingsley and Sawyer talk juvenile justice reform. https://t.co/NKhoiB5TMV
Ford continues by saying his concerns at the moment will not allow him to vote for the initial funding.
Commissioner Ford said he is in support of the new facility but if the operations inside don‚Äôt change it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Earlier Commissioner Wright spoke in support of the new center after the mayor and sheriff‚Äôs office explained its importance to them. Asked if this would speed up the process of new juvenile court renovations as well. CAO Patrice Thomas said it would not.
Commissioner Billingsley says the new facility is a long time coming and asks every child in the new center get the best education they can.
The commission will discuss and vote on allocating $1.3 million for the design of a new juvenile justice and education center shortly.

As expected, Chairman Turner withdraws his resolution that would‚Äôve started the process of the commission appointing an interim state senator for District 32.
Billingsley withdraws a resolution that would have amended contracts submitted to the commission for approval from $50,000 to $100,000 after several commissioners speak out against it.
The commission committee recommends funding for the new facility. A full vote will take place on Monday.
Billingsley says it should be a goal not a requirement that all youth even ones who charged with more serious crimes need have the same access to the new facility, and for them not be transferred until they are adults.
Sawyer says wanting smaller beds is good but if practices don‚Äôt change they‚Äôre still be more kids than beds. She wants to make changes in both aspects simultaneously.
After three discussion items, the commission will now decide on whether to recommend $1.3 million for the new $25 million juvenile detention center. https://t.co/Gv4vnI91Xj
Commissioner Milton said he feels for the first time during his time on commission they‚Äôre moving on the right direction on juvenile court.
Chairman Turner says they need to look at ways to improve the structure for even after their terms end.
Commissioner Wright says there are no bad kids in Shelby County just kids who are involved in bad behavior. This was in reference to a comment from Simkins talking about her home state of New Jersey having bad kids.
Simkins on yesterday‚Äôs announcement: it could be a step in the right direction but encourages the commission to ask more questions as to what it will look like. Wants the commission to create some sort of oversight moving forward.
Simkins says Shelby County needs to look at other practices other cities throughout the state are doing in terms of transfer cases because the numbers are so much higher than the rest of the state.
Simkins: ‚ÄúThe report speaks for itself.‚Äù She says the issues discussed in the report are not new.
Harris says he‚Äôs open to more long-term solutions on other issues to address in terms of juvenile court.
The discussion has now shifted to what the mayor‚Äôs office hopes will address one of the concerns in the report. 	https://t.co/P1SH9LdHwf
At this point in the discussion, Commissioner Sawyer says she was hoping for more of a direct response to the report as opposed to an overview history of the agreement.
Disproportionate minority contact coordinator Jessica Indingaro is giving a presentation over the history of juvenile court and the DOJ agreement.  Vice-chair Mark Billingsley then points out the high number of transfer cases in Memphis compared to Nashville.
DOJ monitor Sandra Simkins who wrote the report on the due process procedures is on speakerphone for this discussion.

More than 5:30 hours later the Shelby County Commission has concluded its last meeting of 2018. Thanks for following along on this journey! https://t.co/IQ5UbX6jH0
The commission just also approved renaming the Shelby County Election Operations Center to the O.C. Pleasant  Jr. Election Operations Center in honor of the late Pleasant, who was a former chairman of the election commission.
As we enter hour 5 of this meeting, the county commission has unanimously approved making April 4 a holiday for county employees to honor MLK‚Äôs commitment to community service.
RT @tamisawyer: Today, Shelby County Commissioners Lowery, Turner, Brooks &amp; Sawyer signed a letter to Governor Haslam in support of Cyntoia‚Ä¶
The commission approves the TIF 12-0. Commissioner Milton abstained.
The motion to defer fails 10-2. Commissioners Sawyer and Milton were the only two to vote to defer.
Sawyer says equity matters and she wants those associated with future projects to know these same questions will come up again.
Commissioners Lowery and Billingsley reiterate their support for this project. Billingsley says deferring this is the same as killing it to him.
He says TIFs fall under the commission and whatever decision the commission makes he will support.
Mayor Harris says he has no intention of vetoing this resolution despite his concerns.
Also Commissioner Milton has moved to defer the resolution to allow the mayor‚Äôs office more time to study the project, but we have a few more people to hear from before we get to a vote.
Former Commissioner Walter Bailey is now speaking on behalf of the mayor and agrees with his decision to seek more time to study the proposal. He said for 44 years he‚Äôs heard developers say the sky would fall if they didn‚Äôt reach their deadline.
Oswalt says they can put things in the development contract regarding those assurances. Mayor Harris is speaking now and once again requests more time to study the project.
Commissioner @tamisawyer, who voiced concerns about the development in the committeee meeting, complemented Adams and Oswalt for the work done since then and wants to know what they can put in place to make sure the MWBE goals are met if the commission approves the TIF.
Developer Kevin Adams tells the commission they have a goal of 28 percent MWBE participation and 5-10 percent minority ownership in the project.
The commission will now discuss the Union Row TIF.
The commission is now voting on a resolution regarding extending the deadline for the inmate health services contract to incorporate the changes from the MWBE ordinance and additional mental health services. It‚Äôs unanimously approved.
The ordinance changes are approved 9-2. Commissioners Bradford and Mills voted no. Commissioner Morrison abstained.
Commissioner @tamisawyer highlighted a report that showed between July-September that the county spent 1 percent of 22 million dollars with MWBEs, zero percent with women owned businesses and 4 percent with locally small owned businesses. Says she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt see the momentum.
Commissioner Morrison said she is against the changes calling them cumbersome and controversial. Says she fears a lawsuit and the current ordinance suffices.
The county commission is discussing voting on several changes to the MWBE ordinance on third reading. The main one is amending it so the inmate medical services contract (one worth $100M over 5 years) have MWBE requirements.
The County Commission is voting on a $100 million TIF for Phase I of the $950 million Union Row project today. Mayor Lee Harris wants the vote delayed by 30 to 60 days because he is uncomfortable with the lack of vetting done on the project by the county. https://t.co/H6GsCyAOYh

More than 10 hours later the county commission has concluded its committee meetings. https://t.co/sm9yKDEqyB
The resolution has been deferred until the Jan. 9 committee meeting.
RT @bdriesdm: Shelby County Schools board names Dr. Joris Ray as interim supt on first ballot.
Harris said earlier his single mission with detained youth is rehabilitation and that a new center would give them more class instructor and let them know they‚Äôre not hardened criminals.
Mayor Harris says this project would take about 18 months if ‚Äúthey move as fast as humanly possible‚Äù on this.
The $1.3 million is to design and construct the center. The whole project is estimated to cost $25 million.
Now being discussed is a new $1.3 million juvenile justice center. Commissioner Sawyer wants to defer the resolution until the next committee meeting as the county digests the recent DOJ monitor‚Äôs report on due process in juvenile court.
The first item being discussed is a resolution that would encourage the state to focus on ‚Äúsuccessful and consistent‚Äù implementation of TN Ready. The committee unanimously recommends it.
@kendall_downing The county didn‚Äôt put an end time on its agenda today, so technically whenever they finish it won‚Äôt be way over time.
When I got to the county building this morning the sun was out. It is no longer out but the committee meetings still roll on. On to legislative affairs...
RT @dailymemphian: The recently formed Memphis and Shelby County ad hoc transportation/transit committee is still in 'research phase' on fi‚Ä¶
The motion fails 5-4. The commission recommends the Union Row TIF with 7 in favor, one abstaining (Sawyer) and one recusal (Bradford).
Officials with the Union Row project have argued delaying of recommendation/approval of the TIF could put the project in jeopardy.
We‚Äôre now in middle of a discussion about a resolution over authorizing a Union Row TIF. Commissioners Sawyer and Turner have both expressed concerns about MWBE involvement and gentrification. Sawyer has made a motion to defer the resolution until Jan. 9.
Commissioner @mgwhaley calls Hopson plan "a great start." Says the focus on long-term planning is very attractive.
Commissioner @tamisawyer asks Hopson what the plan is for community engagement regarding his plan, which she cites as a big concern. Hopson says the headlines about his plan should focus more on the schools being built in the inner city rather than the schools being closed.
Hopson says the proposal includes closing 28 schools and building 10 new schools over a 10-year period. The school board and county commission, the funding body for the district, would have to approve any plan before it moves forward.
Hopson says his plan puts 15,000 students in new facilities and eliminates $100 million of the $500 million the district currently faces in deferred maintenance.
Hopson begins his presentation by saying he prioritized putting underserved children in Memphis in new schools.
The education committee meeting is set to begin. SCS Superintendent Hopson is set to present his consolidation plan to the County Commission shortly.
The most likely resolution to this is the commission not appointing anyone and letting the special election run its course. Turner said he will withdraw the resolution if nothing changes between now and Jan. 9.
Back in committee, Turner is requesting to defer his resolution about the commission appointing an interim state senator for district 32. It‚Äôs deferred until Jan. 9.
The commission approves the ordinance on third reading with 10 in favor. It will be voted on for a fourth reading on Monday.
The contract is worth $20 million per year over 5 years and Chairman Turner wants to move on the ordinance changes so MWBE business can participate on one of the biggest contracts the county partakes in.
It was discussed at length in committee this morning and while additional changes will be made in the future, the main change today will be amending the ordinance to ensure the inmate medical services contract coming up will have to abide by MWBE rules.
The committee meeting has been suspended as there is a special called commission meeting to vote on changes to the MWBE ordinance on third reading. The commission will vote on it once again at Monday‚Äôs meeting.
The committee unanimously recommends the resolution.
Commission committee meetings are going all day today! Commissioner Eddie Jones is sponsoring a resolution that would add April 4 as a holiday for county employees to honor MLK‚Äôs commitment to community service. City of Memphis already recognizes April 4 as a holiday.

A resolution to add additional funding for the TBI to assist local law enforcement with officer involved shootings to the legislative agenda is approved 11-2. Mills and Morrison are the no votes.
Now discussion over establishing the Shelby County Government legislative agenda. The resolution to establish the agenda is unanimously approved.
The commission unanimously approves the resolution.
Commissioner Milton thanks Shafer for her efforts during the opioid litigation. ‚ÄúMy respect for you goes beyond words.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is actually how government is supposed work,‚Äù Shafer said.
Former Chairwoman Heidi Shafer is speaking before the commission now. Shafer thanks the commission for moving forward on the opioid litigation.
Next on the agenda	https://t.co/NP7Y5ii3Il
Also this was in the consent agenda so it‚Äôs official that all county commission meetings will start at 3:30 pm moving forward.
The contract is approved 8-4. Commissioners Ford, Sawyer, Jones and Lowery were the no votes.
Commissioner Brooks proposes the creation of an ad hoc committee regarding purchasing. Chairman Turner approves it.
Morrison says she will vote for the resolution. Jones will not. Billingsley calls this a difficult vote. ‚ÄúNo matter which way you vote you‚Äôre not throwing money out of the window,‚Äù he says.
The county‚Äôs administrating of purchasing Janice Holmes says she sees no issues with Aramark‚Äôs bid.
Commissioner @tamisawyer says the discussion today shows why this contract needs to go out for a rebid.
Representatives from Aramark and CBM have both gone before the commission arguing they have the lowest bid for the contract.
@bethbwilson901 @dailymemphian Thank you for reading!
The president of CBM is speaking now. Says the company did its best to provide the best bid for the contract.
Bonner says in response to Jones the from information he was provided shows Aramark had the lower bid.
Eddie Jones, the sole no vote on the contract approval in committee, says he believes CBM provides a better cost to the county than Aramark. ‚ÄúThe numbers just don‚Äôt add up for me.‚Äù
Bonner says he‚Äôs comfortable with the quality of food and consistency of food provided by Aramark. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to stay where we‚Äôre at.‚Äù
Sheriff Floyd Bonner is speaking on the Aramark contract. He apologized for the confusion between Commissioner Sawyer and his CAO last week. Says he‚Äôs ready to move forward with the contract with Aramark.

Commissioner Sawyer makes a motion to defer voting on this resolution to the next committee which is granted. She says she has a page full of questions and would really want them answered before voting.
Billingsley says he‚Äôs for this but is concerned because he wants to make sure the county gets this right.
Next on the agenda is a resolution to approve a contract with the University of TN Health Science Center for $500,000 to operate the clinical assessment and service coordination programming for the Shelby County Youth Assessment Center.
The committee recommends the resolution with three in favor, one against and five abstaining.
The commission will have an executive session at 2:45 pm Monday to discuss with attorneys about any possible litigation because of the contract.
CBM argues they couldn‚Äôt get it in a timely fashion because the county didn‚Äôt give them the information in a timely fashion.
CBM another vendor which placed a bid for the contract claims it protested but the county says they didn‚Äôt do it in a timely fashion.
The commission will soon vote on a recommending a contract with Aramark to provide food services at its three jail facilities.
The committee also recommended appropriating $6.45 million from the education fund balance for the purchase of science textbooks for about 94,000 students by Shelby County Schools.
The education committee recommended a $24 million budget amendment to the Shelby County Schools operating budget. It doesn‚Äôt increase the approved FY 19 funding from Shelby County Gov‚Äôt.
On the county commission‚Äôs and (now) mayor‚Äôs office joint legislative agenda. Highlights include requesting the General Assembly and Gov.-elect Lee to fund Pre-K for at-risk youth, fully fund BEP and request more TBI funding to assist with office involved shootings.
Developer Kevin Adams said the entire project could be completed in 6-8 years if all goes to plan.
Downtown Memphis Commission President Jennifer Oswalt said this project is adding a key piece of the downtown puzzle.
Next up on the agenda discussion about the Union Row project. https://t.co/AD4DQidg2r
The committee recommends the resolution with only Milton voting against it.
Commissioner Milton said everyone knew what the time the meetings would start when they were campaigning and inconveniences shouldn‚Äôt change that now. Added he‚Äôs built his schedule around the 3 pm meetings.
Commissioner Mick Wright said this will help citizen participation and Commissioner Eddie Jones, who sponsored the resolution, said this would help him spend a little more time with his family while balancing his two jobs.
Now discussion about the most part of this meeting whether the committee will recommend moving the start time of commission meetings from 3 to 3:30 pm.
The committee recommends the item but Turner added there are a few details to finalize and if it‚Äôs not ready by Monday‚Äôs Commission meeting they will defer the resolution one more time.
Commissioner Milton speaking on the relationship between the past commission and mayor says there was enough blame to go around and that they should‚Äôve found a way to improve the relationship.
Chairman Van Turner says this resolution would dismissed two of three lawsuits. One between the commission and county‚Äôs administration and a case in federal court.
At the Shelby County Commission committee meetings, a resolution is currently being discussed that would settle the state court civil actions between the county commission and the county‚Äôs administration. This dates back to the opioid litigation from last year.

Here are some takeaways from the transition team‚Äôs report tonight. https://t.co/PpJsdJTf5F
Harris said in local government it‚Äôs easy to ‚Äúget distracted‚Äù on issues that are not as relevant. Thanked the transition team for staying focused on their tasks.
Mayor Harris is now speaking. Harris thanks the County Commission for their work so far during his term.
Morris as he‚Äôs said before the transition team‚Äôs goal was to give advice to Mayor Harris. Recommendations aren‚Äôt consensus amongst task force members nor guaranteed to be accepted by Harris, Morris said.
Transition team co-chair Paul Morris thanks transition team executive director Danielle Inez for her work organizing the transition team.
One recommendation was for the county to create an office of accountability to measure the progress of initiatives in county government.
Last group to present is the government structure and metrics task force. Hollins said this is the group that will help make all the recommendations possible.
The economic development task force team is now presenting. Two areas they focused on were workforce development and increasing the revenue of MWBEs.
Another recommendation is to have a public awareness campaign about the importance of living a healthy lifestyle.
Now up the healthcare task force. One recommendation is for the county to appoint a healthcare liaison to reach out to the community and better understand its needs.
Should clarify he said adult jail population.
Spickler says another challenge issued was to reduce the prison population by 20 percent by 2020 which he says they can do.
Now the criminal justice task force. @joshspickler speaking on behalf of the task force says he wants the county to boost pre-trial services.
Next up the transportation task force committee. One of the recommendations is to accept the Memphis 3.0 plan in the next few weeks.
An emphasis on more internships to improve workforce development is one of the recommendations from the task force.
The education task force (one of six groups within the transition team) is giving its report now. Start off by praising Mayor Harris for pursing an education liaison.
I‚Äôll be tweeting updates from the presentation which is set to start shortly. https://t.co/gF3HXxFxSX

Story on tonight‚Äôs county commission meeting. 	https://t.co/VLg6VoetOA
The resolution is approved 9-1. Commissioner Mills is the sole no vote.
Last item on the agenda is a resolution supporting the mayor‚Äôs push to increase the minimum pay of county temporary workers to $15 an hour.
The resolution is approved 7-4. Commissioners Mills, Wright, Billingsley and Morrison were the no votes. Commissioner Brooks abstained.
Commissioner Mills says she doesn‚Äôt see the need for the resolution and all the parties involved are already doing what‚Äôs in the current agreement.
Commissioner Sawyer says after talking with the TBI, they would like to investigate all officer-involved shootings but the resolution needs to be requested at the state level so TBI can ask to increase its resources.
Commissioner Billingsley said while he agrees with part of the resolution, specifically the part about the Memphis Police Association, he will still be voting against it.
Another is critical injury will be defined by hospital personnel.
A couple of changes in the resolution: the commission asks the Memphis Police Association to reconsider its position telling officers to decline interviews with the TBI regarding officer-involved shootings.
Commissioner Sawyer says the goal is to improve transparency.
Next item on the agenda https://t.co/fZk76BTFGf
The resolution is approved 7-4. Commissioners Mills, Bradford, Morrison and Billingsley are the no votes. Commissioner Wright abstained.
Commissioner Jones says it was ‚Äúreally bad‚Äù before the DOJ arrived. Adds he‚Äôll support the resolution.
Commissioner Jones says the Commission has consistently wanted the DOJ to finish out the agreement contrary to the previous mayor and Judge Michael.
Commissioner Whaley says he‚Äôs disappointed was made ‚Äúin a hasty manner.‚Äù Adds he will support the resolution, and wants a long-term partnership with stakeholders moving forward.
Commissioner @tamisawyer (a co-sponsor of the resolution) says the resolution is only about the decision to end oversight, not against the progress that‚Äôs been made. Adds the additional year of monitoring is needed to help juvenile court not slip into old practices.
Commissioner Morrison says she will also be voting no on the resolution. Refers to Judge Dan Michael‚Äôs letter with his plans moving forward and has full confidence in him and Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner.
Commissioner Billingsley says he will vote against the resolution. Says the ‚Äúno confidence in the DOJ‚Äôs decision‚Äù wording is too strong for him. Adds he‚Äôs looking forward to working with his colleagues to be more proactive on juvenile court issues.
The County Commission will now take a vote on a resolution which if approved would proclaim ‚Äúa no confidence vote‚Äù regarding DOJ‚Äôs decision to end federal oversight over Shelby County Juvenile Court.

@chipwilliamsjr This is exactly what he needed to do today!
The Shelby County Commission will vote on a resolution Monday which would ask the DOJ to reconsider its decision to end federal oversight over juvenile court. https://t.co/YVvFVBvfw3
The resolution is recommended by the committee with a 5-3 vote.
Mayor Harris says after meeting with DOJ he expected oversight to continue. Says the decision was ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù with discussions he had with DOJ representatives.
‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre fighting for is the longevity of the improvements made in juvenile court and that they are sustainable,‚Äù Chairman Turner said.
Commissioner Milton said the commission will do everything they can to ‚Äúprotect young people.‚Äù
The updated resolution https://t.co/I3nTWl4EE9
Chairman Turner says he wants the resolution to be amended asking the DOJ to reconsider its decision.
The resolution to continue DOJ oversight over juvenile court is still being proposed even after Friday‚Äôs announcement that the DOJ was ending oversight.
Still at the commission meeting, next on the agenda is juvenile court.

On a timeline to acquire the new machines: Phillips said she would want them by the second quarter of next year and introduced and ready for the Arlington election in 2019.
Phillips added she didn‚Äôt think it would be a big issue since ‚Äúso few people use the enlarge print option.‚Äù
Phillips says she knew about the magnifying glass issue before early voting began and she should‚Äôve communicated that earlier. Said reason it wasn‚Äôt top of mind was because she was dealing with the death of her mother.
Also on the cost, Turner asked Phillips if the commission or the state would fund the new machines. Phillips says the bulk of funding would come from Shelby County.
Chairman Turner asks Phillips how the election commission would educate voters on the new voting machines. Phillips in response says they would have an extra poll worker or a demo video on the new machine.
Phillips says new equipment would cost between an estimated $10 to 14 million.
Administrator of Elections Linda Phillips says early voting has gone smoothly since the first day, which had several issues.
Commissioner Sawyer says it‚Äôs important for the election commission to have the public‚Äôs trust and adds they don‚Äôt right now.
Commissioner Sawyer says this discussion is designed to help find ways to help the election commission.
Now, the Shelby County Election Commission is before the Commission to talk about early voting.
The resolution of support to pay all full-time, part-time and temporary at least $15 an hour will be voted on Monday by the commission.
Commissioner Billingsley says he‚Äôs willing to propose a resolution to show the commission‚Äôs support. The MOU doesn‚Äôt require commission approval.
A temporary employee is defined by the county as someone who works for the county for less than a year.
Mayor Harris says the MOU represents a small step, and there is a lot of work to be done.
Commissioner Billingsley says it‚Äôs long overdue for temporary workers (and all workers) in Shelby County to be paid a living wage.
Next on the agenda. https://t.co/DZSd0IxpNr
The resolution is recommended by the committee with an 8-4 vote. Commissioners Mills, Morrison, Wright and Billingsley were the no votes.
Commissioner Eddie Jones says to leave the definition of critical injury to the medical professionals. Says it‚Äôs ‚Äúcommon sense.‚Äù
Commissioner @tamisawyer says she would like the language in the resolution for critical injury as to be defined by the TBI.
Commissioner Reginald Milton said if the commission doesn‚Äôt define what a critical injury is in the resolution the legislators in Nashville may define it for them and it may not be to their liking.
Now the discussion has shifted to how to define a ‚Äúcritical injury‚Äù which is one of the key additions in the resolution.

Commissioner Reginald Milton refers to move the resolution back to committee. Commissioner Billingsley seconds the motion. The TBI will speak before any vote is taken.

The committee recommends the resolution with a favorable recommendation. They‚Äôre 2 add-on items at the end of the meeting.
@_KCummings_ Imagine all the people who are gonna be like ‚ÄúIt was the President though‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
Chairman Van Turner urges the Commission to take this as far as they can fight. Says all they can do is make the request and ask.
Commission jokes about the President‚Äôs text to everyone which just came through a minute ago.
Commissioner Amber Mills raises a question Morrison brought up earlier about the potential cost and resources for the TBI to handle the extra work.
The resolution would add critical injuries in addition to the deaths.
Commissioner @tamisawyer, who chairs the law enforcement committee, said they‚Äôve seen no push back on the resolution yet.
The last item on the committee agenda is a joint resolution requesting state legislation on TBI involvement for all officer-involved shootings sponsored by Commissioners Saywer and Councilman Edmund Ford Jr.
The resolution is recommended by committee with an 8-4 vote. Commissioners Morrison, Wright, Mills and Billingsley voted against the item.
The DOJ‚Äôs visit is next week from Tuesday to Thursday and they will meet with all the commissioners, according to Commissioner Jones.
Turner says they‚Äôre open to something new being done and that they need to overturn Luttrell‚Äôs second letter because it doesn‚Äôt represent the new stakeholders in county government.
Billingsley says he was also upset with the letter and doesn‚Äôt remember a single commissioner at the time who was happy about the letter. Reiterates he wants a resolution that highlights the progress + the work that still needs to be done.
Commissioner Reginald Milton said the letter shouldn‚Äôt have gone out without the commission‚Äôs knowledge. Adds the Commission has the power to have input on this going forward.
Commissioner Mark Billingsley said a yes vote for the resolution is ignoring all of the work juvenile court has done in the past few years.
Chairman Van Turner says they‚Äôre asking to leave things in place now until the new body can engage on this issue.
Commissioner Eddie Jones says the DOJ oversight should stand until all the issues are resolved. They‚Äôre about 25 of the 120 issues remaining that haven‚Äôt been resolved.
Commissioner Brandon Morrison says if they end DOJ oversight they could potentially use that funding to help juvenile court programs that she believes could have a greater impact on those kids.
Commissioner @tamisawyer says the resolution isn‚Äôt an attack on the people of juvenile court. She says they‚Äôve made progress but the two letters were sent prematurely and they‚Äôre job isn‚Äôt done.
An amendment proposed by Commissioner Mick Wright to remove two paragraphs from the resolution failed by an 8-4 margin.
The commission will address this item shortly. A recommendation vote on the resolution was delayed two weeks ago to give commissioners more time to analyze it. https://t.co/gfsvQ9HCH1
There will also be an ad hoc committee formed in the near future for the county to explore how it can be more involved in funding MATA.
Highlights from the discussion include MATA CEO Rosenfels saying MATA has been underfunded by about $20 million per year for the past 2 decades. Several commissioners spoke in favor of finding a way for the county to become more involved in transit. https://t.co/Maq6USFpb9

@wendi_c_thomas FWIW, I don‚Äôt recall her mentioning him in her brief statements Wednesday or today. I‚Äôll have to get back to you on the second question though.
A late add on to override Mayor Luttrell‚Äôs veto over the housing development in unincorporated Shelby County near Collierville. The Commission has until Friday to override the veto. https://t.co/atLgntFnfH
Commissioners Ford Jr. and Sawyer abstained from the vote to approve Iverson.
Iverson is unanimously approved as county attorney. Chairman Van Turner said reservations he had about Iverson have been eased over past few days.
Next is the vote to approve Marlinee Iverson as county attorney.
The Commission unanimously approves the reappointment of Alisa Haushalter as director of the health department.
After a brief discussion, both positions are approved unanimously by the commission.
Next up, discussion over two newly created jobs in county government by Mayor Harris. The first an education liaison and the second a director of communications position.
Commission passes the meeting schedule for the 2018-19 year. They agree to discuss the idea of specially called meetings in committee.
Commissioner Billingsley brings up the possibility of having five or six ‚Äúlistening tour‚Äù meetings throughout Shelby County each year.
The Commission is now discussing the possibility of having several meetings start at 5:30 or 6 pm. Commissioner Jones said his concern is which meetings would you change the start time for. Mentions you could do it for ‚Äúhot-button‚Äù issues.
The amendment to have all Commission meetings start at 6 fails with only 1 yes vote (Commissioner Wright).
Commissioner @tamisawyer says she is in favor of potentially having quarterly special meetings start at 6.
Commissioner Wright responds by saying he put the amendment forward to allow those who have just finished work to be able to attend meetings.
Chairman @turnervan357, who also objects the change, said the current start time of 3 pm allows the community to come speak on issues and go back to work.
Commissioner Milton said everyone knew the schedule when they ran and opposes changing the schedule.
First item on the regular agenda, Commissioner @mickwright wants to change the start of the meetings from 3 to 6 p.m. @GermantownMarkB supports changing the time but only from 3 to 4.
The Shelby County Commission meeting is underway. I‚Äôll be tweeting updates throughout.

@wendi_c_thomas @lauriesans He certainly can (this is just my opinion) but he may wait until he knows he can get the signatures he wants on a potential letter to the DOJ.
@hdreaves Chairman Turner will appoint the attorney to represent the commission but like you said he or she won‚Äôt be independent of the county attorney and will have to work with her.
@wendi_c_thomas Because of the deferral, the earliest the commission can approve it in an actual meeting is Oct. 8 assuming it passes next committee meeting. We‚Äôll see how it plays out.
@hdreaves From what I‚Äôve been told, yes, but that might not always be the case.
Commissioner Brandon Morrison said she wants to defer to have more time to look at the resolution before voting. Chairman Turner agrees to defer a vote on the resolution until the next committee meeting Oct. 3.
Still at the committee meeting, a late on is a resolution that would oppose Mayor Luttrell‚Äôs second letter to the DOJ to end oversight of juvenile court.
Should add Ford Jr. is still a Memphis City Councilman which is important since this is a joint resolution.
This is in response to the officer-involved shooting in Memphis Monday. The commissioners expressed concern about the 24 hour delay in the requesting of TBI‚Äôs involvement in the case.
Commissioners @tamisawyer and Edmund Ford Jr. are sponsoring a joint resolution requesting TBI involvement for all officer-involved shootings. They will make the announcement at 3 p.m. in front of the county commission building.
Commissioner Michael Whaley asks the Mayor if the education committee will be involved in the hiring of the liaison. Harris says they can coordinate. Resolution is approved.
Chief Administrative Officer Patrice Thomas is asking the Commission to approve 2 newly created full time jobs in county government. One being an education liaison position.
The resolution has been approved unanimously. The county commission will now look for someone to fill that role.
Chairman Turner said he wants to appoint Marcy Ingram to this role.
A resolution to appoint a legislative director/assistant county attorney to the county commission is being discussed now. Mayor Lee Harris said he hopes this will resolve the commission‚Äôs desire of wanting its own legal counsel.
Iverson is approved with seven in favor and six abstaining. The commission will vote again to approve the resolution on Monday.
Pamela Moses is now speaking at the meeting regarding Iverson‚Äôs appointment.
Harris in response backs Iverson and said he has leaned on her for knowledge regarding Juvenile Court.
Chairman Turner and Commissioner Sawyer also expressed concerns about Iverson coming from Juvenile Court. Both reference the 2 letters from former Mayor Mark Luttrell requesting the federal oversight of juvenile court to end.
Next up is the appointment of County Attorney Marlinee Iverson. Commission Chairman Van Turner, who plans to vote for Iverson, expressed disappointment Marcy Ingram was passed over for the role twice now.
At the Shelby County Commission committee meeting this morning, a resolution to reappoint Alisa Haushalter as Director of the Shelby County Health Department was approved. The commission will vote on the item again Monday.

@G_Love24 @ManUtd @chipwilliamsjr I honestly don‚Äôt. He was really good the first half of last season, but in the second half he tailed off as Fabregas took his spot in the XI. I think Chelsea‚Äôs midfield needs a more dynamic playmaker alongside Kante and Matic was too close to Kante.
@G_Love24 @ManUtd @chipwilliamsjr I don‚Äôt miss Matic (I wanted him gone two years ago) even though the decision to send him to United was dumb. I never thought Chelsea would lose until Lingard scored but that‚Äôs how it goes sometimes.

@NotReallyAustin That‚Äôs the way it works now. By next week this story will feel ancient. So many questions moving forward though.
@NotReallyAustin Fair point. The fact this isn‚Äôt the craziest thing to happen in Tennessee sports in the last 24 hours is amazing to me...
@NotReallyAustin That‚Äôs true plus they‚Äôve gone through plenty of coaches lol. I still expected him to last the season before any decision on his future though.
@__adel11 I agree that the majority of the locker room probably wanted him gone lol. How did he lose you? I‚Äôm curious.
@ReynoldsRant Picking the 32-year-old aging star over your still relatively new coach is a great idea.

@G_Love24 KAT, Butler and Wiggins will be top 10 in minutes per game for sure lol.
@G_Love24 That sounds about right. Depth is my main concern with them right now.
@G_Love24 I haven't been this excited for a season in a long time. I think the Wolves should make the playoffs but it's not a guarantee in the West.
@G_Love24 I'd be surprised if he went anywhere else. Though seeing him in a rotation guy role will be interesting.
@G_Love24 I agree with you there. As long as IT stays healthy Cleveland will be in the finals again next year.
@G_Love24 Unless LeBron is staying in Cleveland longer than a year, I don't see that as a big problem for them moving forward.

Jim Campbell said the capital needs are a big concern which makes the timing of the decision worse.
Bob Alvey responded they will know more after speaking with legal counsel.
David Clifft said beyond having an opinion the school board may have little say in the matter and it's between the city and county.

Eric Jones was voted in as Jackson-Madison County Schools superintendent tonight. My recap here. https://t.co/ZBEBJ5zBHx via @JSunNews
The board agreed its best for Jones to start as soon as he can, which could be in the next 2-3 weeks.
For context, current superintendent Dr. Ruffin makes roughly the same amount now.
Bob Alvey said the discussion with Jones about his starting salary will start around $160,000.
The school board is now discussing the contract it will offer to Jones.
Bob Alvey confirms the board will go for Eric Jones as its next superintendent.
David Clifft said once again he wanted more than three finalists to interview, and pledges to be a supportive board member going forward.
Eight board members voted for Jones, and one abstained, David Clifft.
After 15 minutes of discussion, the school board is voting now.
Bob Alvey praised the connections Tammy Knipp has established with the community, particularly the Chamber.
Jim Campbell said he thought Knipp was a great candidate and he wishes they could hire both candidates.
Dave Bratcher said Tammy Knipp's best impact is as a teacher, and the further she is from the classroom, the less impact she could have.
The school board is now discussing the other finalist Tammy Knipp.
Janice Hampton said Jones has enough experience to lead the district forward.
Jim Campbell said the current cycle of having a new superintendent every 3 to 5 years needs to end.
Dave Bratcher said the fact 13 members of Jones' staff at JCM followed him to Huntsville, Alabama is noteworthy.
Alvey added it's key to put the right team around him or Tammy Knipp to succeed.
Bob Alvey praised Eric Jones' leadership ability and the only downside to him is he has not been a superintendent before.
George Neely also said he wants Jones as superintendent and wants Knipp in a key central office role.
Joe Mays said the board is looking for a superintendent who will provide stability and that Eric Jones could provide that stability.
School Board Chariman Bob Alvey wants the board the discuss the two candidates before going to a vote.
The JMCSS school board is holding a special meeting tonight to vote for its next superintendent. I'll be live tweeting tonight's meeting.

Going from sports to news will be an interesting change up, but my love for sports (and mediocre teams) will never go away.
I just want to thank everyone for the well wishes yesterday! It was a long search but I'm glad it's over and I'm excited for what's ahead.

The Wolves just completed the biggest comeback in the NBA this season because this game makes no sense.
@ReynoldsRant Exactly! It's not like Cleveland had a week off and just said screw it.
@ReynoldsRant There's always a risk that you won't see who you want when you buy the tickets. It sucks but that's life lol.
@BallFromGrace They were but the Wolves flipped the switch in the 2nd Qtr. Still enough time to revert back though.
@ReynoldsRant I'd be thrilled if the Cavs didn't bring their stars. I'd rather my team's chances to win the game go up but that's just me.

@NotTheLawyer I'm glad it's over lol. Hopefully the new kicker can at least make extra points on a consistent basis.
@JohnParie I think that's why they waited so long to part ways with him. That they could correct his woes like they did then.
@JohnParie He's still as talented as any kicker in the league in my opinion. In the right situation, he can figure it out again.
@G_Love24 He's missed 8 PAT's in the last two seasons plus other FGs. Had to go. Doubt the next kicker is much good though.
