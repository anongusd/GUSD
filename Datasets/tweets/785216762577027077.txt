@SomeProspective @ABPatriotWriter @rs32035 @kn_texas It's funny that most Dems aren't talking about it toooo much
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 Yeah and his opponent was ummm UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI LOLOLOLOL
@rs32035 @SomeProspective @kn_texas Adoring adoration from thousands of people, of course he likes them ü§£
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 He got his electoral college victory because Hillary was so awful at being a candidate and her truly terrible record. And Trump had history on his side
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 Fair enough. I'm just doubtful I suppose
@rs32035 They definitely are amusing I'll give you that I just don't think they help getting Rs elected in Nov
@J_Wade_Miller @bestnaniever @BE_1776 @tedcruz How many?
@SomeProspective @kn_texas @davealvord164 @KingBroly @rs32035 Makes two of us
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 Okay so lemme ask this. In the context of the upcoming midterm election do you think there are people going to these rallies, which again I don't have anything against, were not already planning to vote in Nov? Bc in the end that's all that matters
@IAmKrishanPatel That's hilarious and he's a fraud
@SomeProspective @kn_texas @davealvord164 @KingBroly @rs32035 "overwhelming answer" lol
@kn_texas @SomeProspective @davealvord164 @KingBroly @rs32035 ü§¶
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 Yeah probably some and early in the 2016 campaign definitely. But he's a known quantity now. You're either with him or against him. And these rallies are just for his supporters who ALREADY are engaged and going to vote definitely in Nov
@SomeProspective @davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @rs32035 But non Trump voters don't engage. Like people don't wake up and look at FB or the newspaper and say "Trump had a rally so I'm going to vote for Candidate X" See my point?
@davealvord164 @kn_texas @KingBroly @SomeProspective @rs32035 Trump got 62+ Million people to vote for him. These rallies with even 10-20K of completely supporting people who will vote are not really doing anything. Like there absolutely is nothing wrong with them but I don't see a point
@kn_texas @rs32035 Nobady going to a DT rally at this point is not already completely supporting Trump.
@SenhorRaposa Right? Like in the primary yeah they make sense but in the general?
@kn_texas @rs32035 But nobody goes who is not already completely all in to "MAGA" universe
@SenhorRaposa So...Why??
@kn_texas @rs32035 Explain that.
@rs32035 But nobody who goes to his rallies are either not already 100% with him and definitely going to vote.
@rs32035 Serious question. What is the point of these rallies?
@rs32035 Why?
#electiontwitter 	Serious question	What is the point of a political rally? Particularly in the final stage of a POTUS race?	I guess they generate some news coverage both locally and nationally but still.....

@daltonposse @ABPatriotWriter And so will the Dem ad makers and most people don't pay attention to the details and minutiae. Need, as a public servant running for office, to get on the record as not racist
@ABPatriotWriter You should at least throw a line in about "I absolutely didn't mean it in a racist way, ect" so when the Dem starts running ads about "him being racist here's the comment" you have a strong rebuttal
@IAmKrishanPatel @ForecasterEnten Stop being an idiot
@ABPatriotWriter Right but the fact that it CAN be taken out of context means he should apologise, clean up this little dust-up, and move on. And whatch what he says
@Polit_eur @rudnicknoah After he dropped out they did.
#ElectionTwitter https://t.co/rx9lP4xaeH

@zattack2016 @PositiveInt Steve Schimt brought John McCain back from the dead in '08 and Rove was the architect of the 2000, 2002 midterm and 2004 wins.

@ckieser13 @JesseGreen99 @michael__1776 But it wasn't all that different minus trade issues.
@michael__1776 @ckieser13 But he's right. Do you really think the electorate besides Trump's rabid base likes all the conspiracy theories and mongering coming from the House? Do you really think Jim Jordan can become Speaker? The answer is NO
@ckieser13 @JesseGreen99 @michael__1776 I dunno man, entitlements weren't really an issue. Is was a scandal laced campaign
@michael__1776 @ckieser13 How did he do that?
@ckieser13 @michael__1776 Exactly!
@ckieser13 @JesseGreen99 @michael__1776 The only reason Trump won is because nobody likes Hillary
@JesseGreen99 @ckieser13 @michael__1776 No it was more that they didn't expect low intensity voters, particularly WWC men and AA men to vote and yet they did because of Obama's superior ground game and effective ads portraying Romney as evil

@SHEPMJS That's one state and one poll don't read too much into it. Plus AA and Hispanics don't make up a large voting block in IN

@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa @joshreyes007 @IAmKrishanPatel @prevojon For the record I'm totally in agreement that everything that happened with Clinton or Obama before Jan 20 2017 is irrelevant. Though I think SOME of the scandal around Clinton was legit and should have been dealt with better when she lost THAT was the final verdict on her

@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit Yes very true I'm just concerned that the fundamentals favor them heavily	 maybe not enough for a wave but enough for them to take the House. I could be wrong though
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit True but the baseline mean us 6-7 and history says the party out of power does good in the office year.
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit Yep but it will give something for President Trump to fight against. Something real and concrete. A real war. Would really help him win again if he runs in 2020
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit I think it's highly likely we'll loose the House albeit narrowly
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit I say MO, ND, IN, WV, and maybe MT and OH and MAYBE WI but if we are winning that we are winning FL too so it would basically be a good year for the GOP which I think is unlikely
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit Which seats do you think the Republicans will flip overall?
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit No unfortunately. I REALLY REALLY REALLY want to be wrong but incumbency is strong and it's a Blue year in an already close state.  But the Dems will have to divert a ton of $$$ to it so that is good
@SenhorRaposa @KentonTilford Probably read her stuff just never attached her name to it. I'm bad about that. Do it all the time with Congress districts and their reps
@SenhorRaposa @KentonTilford Who?
@SenhorRaposa @KentonTilford I mean ideologically I'm pretty close but he's essentially given DT a free pass and Lazer focused on Hillery and Obama staff ect...all of which is a NON ISSUE BECAUSE SHE. LOST. THE. ELECTION. SO. IT DOESN'T.  MATTER.
@LovJerseygirl @Peoples_Pundit Yeah mid to high 50's wasn't always so however just recently after the Hurricane
@SenhorRaposa @KentonTilford The guy from the Federalist?
@JuliaGulia809 This is completely bankers. Trump has followed the GOP Congressional agenda on everything from OCare repeal to Tax Cut to Regulations cuts ect.. expect for the terrifs
@SteveDeaceShow That makes sorta sense because he only got ~63M compared to 60ishM for Romney but that doesn't quite match up with the 6M swing towards him from Obama 2012
@SteveDeaceShow So he lost 4-5M "Romney voters"? Serious question not trolling

@prevojon Yeah if he had won Iowa and NV........
@prevojon Ahhhh
@prevojon Bernie won Indiana
@prevojon I was the same way about the 2016 R Iowa Caucuses even got the spread almost exactly right unfortunately I was dead wrong about every single other race. May 3 2016 is one of the darkest days of my life
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa @prevojon Bill Nelson is a YES on Pompao
@burgermanofoz @Politics_Polls Stitt is a businessman. He has a lot of $$$ so that's why he's competitive

@prevojon @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @joshreyes007 A while back
@prevojon @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @joshreyes007 His rival in the primary dropped out and Trump endorsed Heller
@lousjourney @databyler @stephenfhayes He didn't say anything not true
@prevojon @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @joshreyes007 True but it's early and he still needs to rally Republicans around him while his opponent is still behind him. I guess I just think it could be much worse for Heller
@prevojon @politicsluo @SenhorRaposa @joshreyes007 Me too tbh
@SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @prevojon @joshreyes007 Why?
@SteveDeaceShow The generic ballot is at +5 for the Dems.

@ABPatriotWriter Hold your horses there, the margin was like six to eight points 	that's ridiculous close for a district that's like 25 plus points republican-leaning?

@databyler Thanks. Will be looking forward to your write up!
So why the apparent focus? Do you see this as a possible under the radar race that could become competitive?
1/2 @databyler Have you written on #wisen? I just read a NYT article about the massive amount of $$$ already dumped into it by both parties particularly the GOP and more is obviously forecasted. Why?? @RealClearNews has it at "Likely Dem" and no other outlet has it as "tossup"

@ABPatriotWriter The replies to his post are brutal
@SenhorRaposa @ForecasterEnten A shoe vs Trump would have won. My 1.5 year old nephew would have won
@mzbitca @ForecasterEnten Right but what exactly did he do to do those things? Particularly bring in the swing voters?
@mzbitca @ForecasterEnten He wasn't even that good of a candidate. His debates we're terrible from a human and Republican candidate perspective
@ForecasterEnten Clinton was a truly bad candidate. Trump was helped by the fundamentals but I will believe untill I die that the only reason we have Trump is because he was running against HRC

@NancyLRogers1 @michael__1776 There are two good conservative candidates @NickForVA and @ewjacksonsr plus Corey Stewart who im sure you know about.

@SHEPMJS @ABPatriotWriter @CillizzaCNN @Nate_Cohn Nationally?
@SHEPMJS @ABPatriotWriter @CillizzaCNN @Nate_Cohn Actually ABC/WaPo was really accurate. They had Clinton vs Trump final at 49%-46% which was the closest to the final result nationally. Agree with you completely Joseph about aggregates

@DylanDevenyi @prevojon @politicsluo @SenhorRaposa And Obama didn't really struggle in the race untill the end. Romney always was way down
