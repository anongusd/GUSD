@jtlarsen What Dems know: Republicans got destroyed for seeming cavalier about impeachment in 1998. That‚Äôs the political history they‚Äôre afraid of, rightly or not.
@daveweigel Impeachment process would necessarily begin much sooner than the 2020 election though. So if some Ds want to go into that with a political advantage,  these things could matter at this point in the calendar.
@tomscocca Dems I talk to essentially say they want to show persuadable members of the public that they‚Äôre taking the process seriously, that they‚Äôre not rushing headlong into something guaranteed to tear the country apart. That‚Äôs the mistake they think Republicans made that led to backlash
@tomscocca And it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre afraid of GOP criticism either. It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre aware of how badly the impeachment of Bill Clinton blew up for Republicans in 1998.
@tomscocca This is misdirection. Not sure anyone genuinely cares that she swore. It‚Äôs how she talked about impeachment that is bothering Dem leaders, who don‚Äôt want to give the impression they‚Äôre approaching impeachment out of spite and political animosity.

Amusing side note: Butina‚Äôs lawyers had subpoenaed American University for info about her time there.		The judge revealed she had gotten ‚Äùnumerous‚Äù pro se motions from students there asking her to quash the subpoena. She seemed bemused/annoyed by it.
Lastly: No sentencing date set. Lawyers agree to hold a status hearing on Feb. 12 to assess her cooperation and set a sentencing date then. Butina will remain imprisoned in her current conditions until then.
The Judge, Tanya Chutkan, warned Butina she could face deportation for her offense. In addition to five year jail term, she could also face $250,000 penalty and 3 years of supervised release ‚Äî if she‚Äôs allowed to stay in US. Actual sentence likely to be much less.

The charge she pleaded to carries a maximum sentence of 5 years, but prosecutors and Butina‚Äôs lawyers estimated that her cooperation and acceptance of guilt could bring the sentence down to 0-6 months.		A hearing on her cooperation set for Feb. 12.
Butina acknowledged acting at the direction of a Russian government official to ingratiate herself to senior Republican figures and gain entree to conferences and other events to transmit information back to Russia.

@alexburnsNYT Counterpoint: He‚Äôs not a DC fixture or career politician. He‚Äôs been a prosecutor on high profile civil rights cases (a la Doug Jones), he implemented the health law that inspired Obamacare and he‚Äôs got an Obamaesque brand of rhetoric that‚Äôs missing from this political moment.

Last 24 hours, Trump has:		-Suggested Clinton campaign emails may not have actually been stolen (a nod to Seth Rich conspiracy)	-Cited Jerome Corsi as a ‚Äúmajor player‚Äù whose word can be trusted over Mueler	-Accused his own deputy AG of treason

Without explanation, Trump ally Corey Lewandowski predicted on MSNBC last night that Jordan would lead Judiciary Republicans and Meadows would lead Oversight Republicans.
One more note: Jordan at Judiciary would clear the way for another Trump loyalist, Mark Meadows to become the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, another source of potential investigations into Trump.
One twist: Even if McCarthy agrees, it‚Äôs not up to him. It‚Äôs up to the GOP Steering Committee, a panel that won‚Äôt necessarily back Jordan even with a White House push.
McCarthy is about to beat Jordan, a longtime foe, in a race for minority leader. And the Judiciary post has long seemed destined to go to Rep. Doug Collins, who‚Äôs spent months angling for it.		But Trump‚Äôs intervention is a last-minute wildcard.

@bradheath Yes, some lawyers connected to this matter have been clear about this: just because the FBI severed its formal source relationship with Steele doesn't mean they were required not to listen when he passed info along. They routinely listen to far more unsavory characters than him.
@bradheath Right, it's far from clear that this is evidence of a politically motivated conspiracy. Rs also complain that Ohr continued to send tidbits from Steele to the FBI after the FBI severed its source relationship with Steele. But your point applies here as well.

@PoliticalShort All great questions.
@PoliticalShort There are two questions, though, that we don't have answers for:		1) Was this the start of a much broader effort that Facebook caught early?		2) Is this a sign that Russia still views election interference as a desirable strategy despite potential backlash?

RYAN REJECTS ROSENSTEIN IMPEACHMENT: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we should be cavalier with this process ... I don‚Äôt think this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.‚Äú		This puts him out of step with his potential successors, Scalise and McCarty, who refused to take a position.
Still, notably, neither man who would be the next speaker said whether they‚Äôd support or oppose the conservative push, despite repeated opportunities to weigh in.
MCCARTHY with some cold water for the Rosenstein impeachment effort, says it should go through the ‚Äúcommittee process,‚Äù a slower route than conservatives would like.
SCALISE refuses to say whether he‚Äôd support conservative efforts to impeach Rod Rosenstein. Says the House must use all tools to get documents from the Justice Department.
Rep. Jordan just said he‚Äôd ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù file a privileged version of the impeachment articles against Rosenstein today ‚Äî a move that could force a vote on the matter (though likely not until after the August recess).
DOJ checks in to prevent a frenzy: Yes, Rosenstein will be at the White House today. No, he‚Äôs not meeting with the president (who‚Äôs out of town). They‚Äôre previously scheduled meetings.

MEADOWS said on @IngrahamAngle tonight that he might file a "privileged" resolution on impeaching Rosenstein tomorrow, which would require a vote within two days.		But the House is leaving for recess tomorrow, unclear if they'd vote before returning in September.
@LauraAJarrett Yeah don‚Äôt ask me why. A couple of the non-primary backers of this effort seem to think Sessions has a role in Rosenstein‚Äôs fate.
IMPORTANT: There‚Äôs virtually no way impeachment could pass. It‚Äôs a long shot in the House and DOA in the Senate. But backers have told me they hope the effort encourages Trump/Sessions to act on their own.
DOJ officials say, despite the claims from the conservatives, they‚Äôve been able to accommodate or negotiate most GOP demands. This one is a non-starter.

In a weird way, this is what Democrats have been arguing: that they came for us in 2016, they could come for you in 2018. They won't like Trump's framing, but he's making the Democratic argument for why this should be a bipartisan issue.

@edkrayewski Only thing that would make it of note is if it was part of a quid pro quo or a signaling effort. The change itself was limited and the platform is a largely meaningless document.
@NJT_2015 @realDonaldTrump Lawmakers have talked to delegates, RNC staffers, Trump campaign staffers in the room when the change was made. No one had evidence the change was being directed by anyone outside the room. But it‚Äôs possible Mueller has some email/phone traffic they don‚Äôt from Manafort/Gates.
@codytfenwick @realDonaldTrump Lawmakers interviewed most of the key players and seemed fairly convinced the platform change was benign and reflected Trump‚Äôs very public thinking about Russia/Ukraine. Even Dems didn‚Äôt really touch this one publicly after awhile.
