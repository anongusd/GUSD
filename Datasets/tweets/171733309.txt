This Fourth of July, we celebrate America and rededicate ourselves to extending the promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to children across our nation. https://t.co/uXq9ZgMlP3
Happy Independence Day! Let us all work together to make sure that the freedoms and opportunities that have defined our great nation are available to all of America's children. https://t.co/rEIkCYkNdt
Use Independence Day for #SummerLearning. As Jefferson wrote about American freedom and the 4th of July: "For ourselves, let the annual return of this day forever refresh our recollections of these rights, and an undiminished devotion to them."https://t.co/075px3OfTi
John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were supposed to team up to write the Declaration of Independence. But Adams convinced Jefferson to write it alone. Discover why, in this article -- and use Independence Day as an opportunity for #summerlearning. https://t.co/MT5I4rbTIQ
Independence Day is a great time for picnics, fireworks, and spending time with family and friends. But more importantly, it is about celebrating America's commitment to freedom. This Fourth of July, remember to let children know the reasons we celebrate!

All children deserve a great education. A good education can inspire students to learn and achieve their dreams. There are a lot of different types of schools out there. #SchoolChoice is about making sure kids have access to the education environments that best meet their needs.

"Proclamations help raise even greater public awareness of the education options available to children and families," said Andrew Campanella, president of National School Choice Week. "We are grateful for the bipartisan interest in, and support for, our nonpartisan celebration."
National School Choice Week raises awareness of traditional public schools, public charter schools, public magnet schools, private schools, online academies, and homeschooling, shining a positive spotlight on these options in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and celebratory way.
BREAKING NEWS: President Donald Trump has issued an official proclamation recognizing January 21-27, 2018 as National School Choice Week. As of Monday, January 22, 31 US governors have issued proclamations recognizing School Choice Week in their states.
