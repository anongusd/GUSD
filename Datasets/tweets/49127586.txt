@stormyweatherz As leader of once most powerful nation on earth, obama didn't confront #NKorea but says Sony made mistake by not doing so

@Jenfidel You're missing the point. obama wants guns out of hands of citizens. He'll happily put gun makers out of biz anyway he can.
The Greatest Generation gave us a strong Republic. We're about to be asked to take it back or be the generation that sold out.
@Minutemanbob57 @libertyladyusa That much is certain.If they move as quickly as they say they are, resistance will also have to move quickly
@Jenfidel Not directly.If obama wants Immelt at GE to buy, say, Remington &amp; close down their gun/ammo manufacturing operation. What happens?

Is there an obama bias in the polls? http://t.co/uGhFPsYM Of course, everyone knows there is.
@TimZernack When obama dismantled NASA, I said look at the Moon and imagine Chinese astronauts looking down on you. http://t.co/VptjoMKm
If you want a preview of America after an obama 2nd term, you only have to look at California today. http://t.co/thMaiDHA

@lloydbgwells Further obama falls behind in polls, less likely election becomes. Fictitious claim of civil unrest will bring martial law.
RT @lloydbgwells: Be ready, if as I suspect, this election may very well never happen. And if it does happen it may not be like any other.

Folks, you need to be following a fellow Patriot @radwingdotcom
@Wmpear Thank you. I appreciate the #FF.
@MisterAK47 You're right about martial law. I firmly believe it's in obama's plans to be used if he really starts falling behind in polls.
@InsolentPuppy 3 teams supported each mission in 8 hour shifts. My team was not manning consoles when Apollo 11 landed. I watched on TV too.
@MisterAK47 I would be surprised if the pro-gun control folks would let a good crisis go to waste.
43 yrs ago today,2 American astronauts landed on Moon taken there by space vehicle made in America. Where's leadership that made it happen
Only the MSM would take a horrific incident &amp; politicize it. Then with evidence to the contrary,  try to link it to conservatives. Shameful!
@FindaFone4U Sorry, Chaps. I don't know the conversion rate for dollars to the British pound.
Drudge Report: 'Every document surrounding Obama plagued with problems'...==&gt; obama is a real life Manchurian Candidate.

@MittRomney Tell the MSM you'll provide your tax returns when obama unseals his various records
Socialists don't understand the law of diminishing returns. When everyone is on welfare, who's paying for it? Just keep printing that money

@gilrolling Thanks for RT. Romney must have VP with Allen West's don't-mess-with-my-country attitude because many of us have that attitude.
@JJsassypants BHO promised young voters the moon so they got their old childhood bedroom back in their parents’ house! &lt;=== Amen (twice)
@MittRomney Suggestions: 1) lose the slick hair look 2) pick a VP with some fire &amp; enthusiasm not afraid to take the gloves off with obama
@luvGodncountry Thank you for the #FF. Allen West would make a great VP.
@libertyladyusa Thank you, fellow Texan, for the #FF.

@ConsrvativeDiva Thank you for the Mention! T minus 112 days &amp; counting until we see how obama reacts to defeat. I think it won't be pretty
@okmaher Seriously, go back about a week or two and find the articles on the 1000s of lawyers obama is massing mostly in swing states.
RT @jjauthor: Apparently, we’re supposed to be more outraged by what Romney does with his money than by what Obama does with ours.
@jjauthor Thanks, Ruth. We all now have a death grip on the obvious.
@jasonhowell8888 @okmaher @briansikma Every day I wake up hoping it was a bad dream. I feel like Bill Murray's character in Groundhog Day
@jasonhowell8888 @okmaher @briansikma If it looks like it will be blowout,then obama trumps up martial law situation in SW &amp; delays election
