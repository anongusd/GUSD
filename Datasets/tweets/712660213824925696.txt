@DanielNies1 @JesseKellyDC Regulation being illegal is the first problem. Track the guns better. Actually the second amendment was written when we were at war,  and times are different now. We're only at war with children and our very own neighbors. Get updated.  This isn't the 1,700's. Times change.
@JesseKellyDC No military grade weapons,  no guns that can be modified,  keep gun owners in check and responsible for every firearm in their possession. Any gun stolen or lost to be reported immediately. Lock them up.  Now restrictions for guns in the home of children,  and veterans.
@JesseKellyDC That's why they need to have regular gun checks,  at police and sheriff's department, once every six mos,  fingerprint checks and no gun shows.  No modified weapons,  and two firearms only for each home. Regulations on safety and gun safety classes regularly. Track them.

@DanielNies1 @JesseKellyDC No more than two firearms in any home. No automatic or guns that be modified. No military firearms and weapons.
@DanielNies1 @JesseKellyDC Better background checks. No sale of firearms ay gun shows,  serial numbers that are traced to every firearm,  gun safety and regulated gun checks. Secure lock up and storage,  and hold the gun owner's responsible for a firearm in the home. Regular gun check ins @ sheriff dept.
@JesseKellyDC If these were your children, or your families,  or friends, you'd feel differently about the use of guns and gun safety,  and better, thorough checks on backgrounds. You'd advocate for this. Nobody wants to take your guns. This isn't the wild west. We have to protect our families

@Sentient_Hoodii @BraxtonKai @PatrickJolle @CountDankulaTV Oh,  isn't that what centrists are doing? Poking holes instead of standing up for what you believe in for the benefit of mankind? Isn't that for everyone's sake? Besides centrists are the most judgemental, to be such 'peacemakers'.
@PatrickJolle I'm very sorry you feel that way. But if nobody fights for it,  change will never happen. And that's reality. I love my country and I love the promise of a better future for my family. So I will always stand up to injustices.  Before they happen to me and to you and your family.

@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr This is one instance, of a considerably low amount of latino crime, legal immigrant or not, compared to a much higher degree of white natural born citizens, especially males.

@bduty47 @SenFeinstein Sounds to me, like she's trying to correct the problem and at least get it out on the table. I don't see any Republicans, or otherwise, showing much concern at all for all the shootings we've had in the past two years alone. Guns are a serious problem in this country.
@bduty47 @SenFeinstein There have been no provisions for bump stocks,  and high powered guns. There has not been any amendments in the constitution for safety measures until this has become out of control in the past two years. This is what needs to change. And enforcing background checks, and mental.

@Ga_guntoter @SenFeinstein The weapons were very different when the constitution was written,  it was written so that people could protect their land,  their homes and their property,  as well as for sport.  Not to collect arsenals and sell them to anyone who wants to buy one. We need reform. Now.
