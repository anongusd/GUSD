@Thooorin @Rockprincess818 I feel your pain bro. But it is not that drastic, is it? Those of us that love truth and justice must tell ourselves that failue is not an opiton. If intollerance and hatred of the other wins the day then our democracy fails. So what  are your ideas about how we can win?
I am with you Congress woman Maxine Waters. But, can you please reclaim the moral high ground?
Now is not the time for partisan bickering when the political foundations of this democracy are being systemattically dismantled. We say that America is excptional, prove it! Come together now. A house divided against itself wil not be able to stand.
The Supreme Court and the Congress have acquiesced to the bluster of the President's racialized popularism. Now, America only has one branch of government, the The Trump Branch.
#Roseanne is a tree that has grown up &amp; flourished in the soil of America. Remember that an intolerant tree or a racist tree can't flourish in the soil of justice. Something's wrong w/the soil. #RosanneBarr #acacianvillage

America is divided along racial, economic and ideolgical lines. At this moment in time we need a Uniter in Chief not a Divider in Chief. I respectfully implore you, Mr. President, to help us build bridges and not walls between our fellow Americans.
The Waffle House shooting was a hate crime and an act of terrorism. The shooter was a white male and the victims were all minorities: three African Americans and one Hispanic individual.  I'll be watching to see how this crime is prosecuted.
Weapons of war have no place in the hands of civilians. Killing people is not a sport and the AR15 is not a video controller. It is an instrument of death #saveourchlidrennow.

Its ironic that we have enough firepower to save the world but we can not/ will not save our own children.  Pox on our houses for this #Savethechildrennow.
The state of our union is deeply divided.
The greatest honor that we can give our veterans is to treasure this nation they gave everything to protect and to preserve. Waring with each other for inane reasons and divding ourselves into mindless partisan camps squanders the treasure of freedom purchased with their blood.
The greatest threat that we in 2018 is not North Korea, not China, not Russia, not even Isis, but rather it is us. We are the mortal threat that lurks within. 	We are too distrusting and too disrespectful of our fellow countrymen for no valid reason at all.
My New Years prayer: Dear Lord deliver us from partisan, racial and cultural blindness so that we may see each other as fellow human beings and fellow Americans and not as mere objects that we live to oppose. #uniteAmerica
2018 will be a critical year for America. Either we will defeat our  mindless addiction to political partisanship and rise together, or we will implode and crumble into the heap pile of history along with other past great empires
It does not take courage to stand up for the wrong thing.
2017 was the year that America declared war on itself. One thing is for certain if we don't end this foolishness  quickly all Americans will be big losers. #uniteAmerica
A proper blend of faith, family and friends are the key indgredients to a fulfilled life. All other pursuits and concerns have very little lasting value.
After every  national election this country has an opportunity to work together or to pull further apart. Lately we have done the latter and rejected the former. This story will not have a happy ending.

@BillOReilly I dont support everything that BLM does, However, a wise man once said that your enemy is not always wrong and your freinds are not always right. You are a very intelligent man. You know that there are times when BLM raise valid concerns but you are throwing red meat to your base
@BillOReilly I agree that Americans should not listen to partisan foolishness, but that means that we should not watch FOX or MSNBC. These are two extreme ends of the political spectrum. Both are pushing a partisan message. Neitehr is interested in getting to what is actually true.
@dreamon000 @BastrainStrain Christine try to see the world through something other than a partisan lens. Maybe you can try independent thought.There is nothing possitive that is accomplish by dividing Americans into two antithetical camps: liberals and conservatives.

Please study American history.  It is a historical fact that conservatives were once largely Democrats. At the time that the Repbulican party was formed the Democratic party was violently opposed to freeing African Americans from slavery. This is a historical fact. https://t.co/UZ8haDK9hi
