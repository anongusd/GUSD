@mitchellvii The crisis is that democracy is threatening to destroy our Union!	#EradicateDemocracy
@steph93065 Article IV, Section 4 is thus all of a piece. The Republican form of government it guarantees enables the protection against invasion and insurrection it affords.
@steph93065 The communist household is ‚Äúthe people‚Äù. It provides the inalienable assurance of place which enables a militia to be formed to protect a republic formed by such households. These militia are then called up to defend the States against invasion and (democratic) insurrection.
@steph93065 A Republican form of government requires a communist form of household. Sadly, the populace has believed the tripe of democratic propagandists in thinking communism is a foreign import and democracy is American, when the opposite is true.

@arothmanhistory @KevinMKruse Democrats were ticked that Long did away with the poll tax in Louisiana and was teaching the poor to read. Then they were alarmed by his ‚ÄúShare Our Wealth‚Äù program and that he managed to turn the Democratic Machine on its head. I cannot take the democratic apologetics seriously.
@asymmetricinfo Okay, so your argument is basically that you should be able to hot rod your lazy ass through any town you please and get subsidized for running over pedestrians, because that is your motorist democratic privilege. Then you claim efficiency based on one of your ignorant orifices.
@asymmetricinfo Actually, it is far more efficient to mix freight and passenger service in different proportions, depending on passenger demand, enabling greater frequencies. You are a complete ignoramus about transportation.
@asymmetricinfo The highway system is even MORE expensive and inefficient. Besides, it is garbage. The Romans built better roads! Zero out highway funding, close the highways, and the land will revert to its far more productive natural state within a decade. Local farming &amp; trains would return.
@asymmetricinfo Cars take convoluted routes all the time. The most direct route is ALWAYS to walk, but motorists are too lazy to get off their duffs to do that! There is NO reason for us pedestrians to subsidize YOUR LAZINESS. Let the highway system crumble! It has always been a complete WASTE!
@asymmetricinfo That is a false dichotomy. The choice is between a pedestrian neighborhood with no open roads and a bunch of highways through the heart of a town with motorists running people over, saying ‚Äúoops, I‚Äôm sorry, but why was your loved one walking in my way?‚Äù	KEEP YOUR CARS OUT OF HERE
@asymmetricinfo As a kid, I would hike for miles and LOVED it. That was serenity BECAUSE there were NO CARS for miles around. You can take your cars and your macadam and shove them up your rear.		Also, you motorists MURDER millions of us pedestrians. One of you murdered my neighbor‚Äôs daughter.
@asymmetricinfo I HATE cars. I would throw up EVERY TIME my family went on a car trip. We would pull out of a gas station and a couple of minutes down the road, I would throw up. I never did that with trains, boats, or trolleys. Only cars.

@troyjensen @susieblaise @IvankaTrump What an unconditional provision of the necessities does is monetize survival demand, providing local customers for local industry. That baseline of economic activity obviates economic growth. Instead, economic activity is right-sized and the present political economy stabilized.
@troyjensen @susieblaise @IvankaTrump That is why I say that a provision of the necessities conditioned on employment has always failed. A country can only be dominant for so long. Eventually, other countries gain their own industry, buy their own products, disrupting the mercantilist system of absolute advantage.
@troyjensen @susieblaise @IvankaTrump My objective is to end poverty, hence to bring liberty in and of the household. I find that making survival contingent on economic activity puts the cart before the horse, creating a dependence on jobs and profits, with all that entails: mercantilist imperialism and wars.

@GreyFox003 @Peggynoonannyc As for people are leaving NYC and New Jersey, that is because they are being pushed out through evictions and the consequences mortgage-based directed inflation in real estate prices. For Peggy and others amenable to reason, I will post an earlier article addressing this.

Conservatives know NOTHING about economics. I swear they must get their ideas from the back of a matchbook cover. I present a thorough qualitative analysis of Amazon, showing they bring NOTHING to NYC and they bring up irrelevant analogies about car manufacturers.
@RyanAFournier Unlike Amazon, Jeep actually manufactures something. The Jeep jobs are real and not the result of destroying other firms.
@GreyFox003 @Peggynoonannyc Your analogy is ignorant, as well. The automobile industry in the USA had been monopolized for decades when the foreign makes brought competition in the 1970‚Äôs on.
@GreyFox003 @Peggynoonannyc You are the dolt. Shipping and delivery produces NOTHING. The ONLY INDUSTRY that Amazon is in is book production and publishing, for which it would have to push aside LOCAL firms. Try reading for understanding instead of trying to defend your imbecile conservative line.
@GreyFox003 @Peggynoonannyc If you are unable to follow an argument, you could ask for help instead of pulling a ‚Äúsour grapes‚Äù shtick.		My point stands: Amazon was not going to provide new jobs.

One good example of this is the forced relocation of Chinese urbanites to farms under Mao. Though propagandized as "communism", it was in fact slavery on democratic plantations, indistinguishable from the importation of slaves to work on democratic plantations in the USA South.
Any attempt to coerce a physical communism ceases to be communism. An attempt to establish a national, physical communism is necessarily coercive, and is therefore not communism. Indeed, coercion IS rule and is therefore some form of democracy.

@lisapease Dorothy Day‚Äôs communitarianism was a synonym for that form of household organization, or oikos, emphasizing the Christian communism of Acts.		Communist republicanism builds republics upon those communist households. Each household is autonomous and its members possess the liberty
@lisapease Communist republicanism is classical or full republicanism. The household organization is communist in its original sense, protected and defined by a surrounding wall, within which the people hold the land and buildings within in common for the household and its posterity.
@StateDept @usaforamericans It might help to have a United States government, and governments of its several States, which cared more about the people in communities than about the destructive democratic ideology.
@lisapease The Atlantic has gone full democracy and are spewing hateful democratic propaganda. As a Communist Republican in the New England tradition, I am disgusted with their incitement of insurrection and their attempts to supplant the Electoral College and the Union with a democracy.
@RealJamesWoods Much simpler, James. The real war in this country, from back when my ancestors Richard Warren and John Howland came here, has been the war democrats have been waging against peaceful communists with the object of imposing democracy and its peculiar brand of slavery.
@AOC If I were to be elected to Congress, I would make an unconditional provision of the necessities to all a top priority. If the #1500DollarWeeklyStipend was enacted, congressional staffers would not have to worry about living off of their salaries. Ditto for everyone else.

People, do you not seeing what the democratic propaganda is doing?		It says "our democracy". It says "democracy dies" when something untoward is done. It says something "threatens democratic institutions".		This is done to brainwash you into thinking democracy is good, not evil.
Actually, that is precisely how democracy works: you put your friends in the "people/"demos" category, you put your enemies in the "not people"/"not demos" category, and you privilege the former and enslave the latter.	#EradicateDemocracy https://t.co/G7pQSqGjYX
@aliciaenvivo @NewsGuardRating It is only from the interplay of the local independent press, both domestic and abroad, that the citizen can be informed on current events. The national press is built on that foundation, as is the international press, as is the broadcast and interactive ("social") media.
@aliciaenvivo @NewsGuardRating Only then can there be a reliable body of news reporting for the country as a whole, from which any one locality can draw news from other localities within the country. Only then can there be many critical eyes scanning the foreign reports and offering many different analyses.
@aliciaenvivo @NewsGuardRating What fixes matters? What restores the press? Local newspapers, edited by local residents, read by local residents, printing letters from local residents, having advertising space for local businesses, and getting news reports from local reporters reporting on local events.
@aliciaenvivo @NewsGuardRating I am highly suspicious of monopolist firms such as Microsoft becoming censors of an already heavily monopolized broadcast industry. When that industry regularly issues propaganda of one kind or another, their reportage ceases to be "news", fake or otherwise.
@RepublicansNYC @AOC Her hypocrisy is more in that she protected local NYC businesses from  Amazon yet supports their subsidiary, Whole Foods, in DC.  She is taking the republican aspect of socialism in the former, but  taking the democratic aspect of socialism in the latter.

@MarkoKepi @RepublicansNYC @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @NewYorkGOP @RealMGrimm @TheBronxGOP @GOPStatenIsland @KingsCountyGOP @Manhattan_GOP For NYC Republicanism, a policy to abolish the mortgage is thus of critical importance. It is key to establishing a politic based on the consensus of communities, on republicanism.
@MarkoKepi @RepublicansNYC @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @NewYorkGOP @RealMGrimm @TheBronxGOP @GOPStatenIsland @KingsCountyGOP @Manhattan_GOP The mortgage also pushes commercial rentals far above what the local market can bear, driving local, small businesses out and replacing them with franchises of monopolistic firms. In this way, the mortgage supplants main street republicanism with democratic mercantilism.
@MarkoKepi @RepublicansNYC @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump @NewYorkGOP @RealMGrimm @TheBronxGOP @GOPStatenIsland @KingsCountyGOP @Manhattan_GOP My current policy campaign is to abolish the mortgage, which is the sole reason why real estate and rents are so unaffordable. The effect on housing rents, in particular, is endangers stable residence and thus citizenship and civic republicanism. https://t.co/bLGxhyJrNi

@B52Malmet @AOC The Democracy of the Right repeating the false claim of Amazon creating 25K jobs does not make it true. Their exercise of monopoly power would have transferred business and jobs away from NYC companies to the Amazon trust.	https://t.co/8UL12HFJXA
The so-called ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù are not currencies at all; they are commodities. Effectively, they are e-tulips aspiring to be gold, another commodity whose hoarders falsely claim to be currency and then money.		What is currency? It is money which runs through a local market.

@RealCandaceO @CoryBooker @KamalaHarris Amazon should be broken up. It is a democratic mercantilist trust restraining trade. My cousin‚Äôs Anti-Trust Act should be invoked against Amazon.

Vicarious rule has to be one of the biggest cons in history. You vote for somebody, you put them in power. Why would you think they would come knocking on your door after that election and more than a few months before the next? They are too busy democrating you in the meantime.
I never wanted the motorist democracy. An automobile is just a waste of money, and motorist sprawl is a poor excuse for a neighborhood.		Give me a communist household where I share the farm chores with hundreds of of my housemates, and I do not have to go work for a mercantilist.
@JamieBQuynn @lisapease None of the above. I have been thinking of running, myself.

Many claim that looking for employment is a full-time job. That is a lie. For all of the full-time work we job-seekers put into our efforts, we do not get paid a penny. It is a full-time charity to companies, helping them to find workers for free.
@simonesydnor1 @AOC @CollierLeBlanc For the larger question of whether we should be fighting over the scraps of this mercantilist system, arguing over who is facing more discrimination in whitewashing fences, I would refer you to my treatise on political economy:	https://t.co/JMO8bO0YHK
@simonesydnor1 @AOC @CollierLeBlanc I was excluded from jobs, well before I was a senior, BECAUSE of merit. The question was whether there was a meritocracy. My case is a clear counterexample of that.
Marriage in a democratic society is such a childish thing. The pair play at house, with wages which make them slaves in a bigger house. Their education certified as if it is unique, they plan the number of children they will have and the vacations they will take. Reality comes.
Communism is the Christian lifestyle. It replaces democracy and society as the lifestyle of religion. It says that faith is every day, not just in a temple on a Sabbath day. It says that faith is found in people living in communist households, growing their own food.
@foe_us Communism is the answer. Bringing farming back to the household, bringing back the communist household, will end the democratic mercantilist poisoning of our food.
@charliekirk11 @RynotheD And Robert Mueller was the bag man for the Uranium treason.
I am opposed to democracy. I do not want things put up for a vote because that only and always ends up with tyranny and oppression. I do not care which side wins an election, because I am not on any democratic side. I am on the side of the oppressed, the poor, and the imprisoned.

@peterreillycpa The higher marginal tax rate is therefore consonant with Republicanism, if anything from Eisenhower‚Äôs ideological framework. On the other hand, the democratic political and social culture had some influence in Eisenhower‚Äôs most anti-republican measure: the Highway Act.
@peterreillycpa Eisenhower came from the quasi-communist tradition of Americanism, where the communist household was merged with the republic in the American small-town civic republicanism. The notion of a ‚Äúhometown‚Äù is communist. That of the wealthy contributing to the civic weal is republican.

@pitbulldawg1 @WayneDupreeShow I am being serious. In fact, I propose liquidating the federal debt and show that it only produces a temporary inflation here:	https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU
@MelvinNudelman See https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU for how that can be done.		By the way, the mercantilist banks create ledger money for deposits with every loan they extend. What the Federal Reserve does is create quasi-fiscal currency for those banks to have on hand when deposits are withdrawn.
@MelvinNudelman I proposed a judicial bank for the United States during the Great Crash 2008, to adjudicate the mortgages into equity transfer agreements. That is what I see as replacing the Federal Reserve, but I would use the FR, in its role of central bank, to eliminate the federal debt.

@SoloLafan @seanhannity Works for me, as long as we call up the militia. The only military authorized by the Constitution. But that would require a Republican form of government, which would require communist households as the members of the local republics which would be supplying the militia.
It is not a matter of illegality, since immigration law is anti-Constitutional. It is much simpler than that.  Are people peacefully entering the United States, or are they invading?
@SoloLafan @seanhannity The wall can impede an invading horde and limit the troops needed to mostly snipers.
@seanhannity The United States is obligated to protect each State from invasion. Insofar as the caravan constitutes an invasion of the southwestern States, measures need to be taken to fulfill that obligation. That would include erecting fortifications (a wall) and calling up the militia.

@AOC Central to my political campaigns has been not taking any money, mercantilist or not. I have a theory that the pen is mightier than the purse.
I wrote my first AI program, a checkers-playing program in APL, when I was a high school senior, during the 1974-75 school year, working for BOCES.  My further work in AI was resisted by the commercial interests and furthered by the academic interests and the military. #FundNSF https://t.co/wdCgH84wlI
I never smoked pot. I never smoked anything else. Also, I have never been drunk. However, I do drink wine and stout in moderation. I never went to a rock concert. I am officially the least cool semi-public figure around.
Thus we have the Blackface scandal of Governor Northam being switched in when his late-term abortion remarks threatened to topple Planned Parenthood, which has a symbiotic relationship with the Democratic Machine.
A favorite political device of the mainstream democracy is the scandal switch. With Bill Clinton, Monica was switched in when Whitewater was getting hot. With Hillary Clinton, the E-mail scandal was switched in when the Benghazi and State Department for Sale scandals were hot.
I have never needed an incentive to work at my calling. Rather, the duress of having to pay for the necessities through wage employment has prevented me from working.		This is true for you, too.
@DoNotGiveUpHope The key to keeping people out of prison is twofold:		1. Removing the economic incentive by prohibiting prisoner labor; and		2. Removing the legal means by repealing laws which impose morality. (morality=judging people to be good or evil)		For crime, see https://t.co/JMO8bO0YHK
I have always thought that people are people. The only race of humans is the human race. The first time I saw the contrary view of racism exhibited, it was on television showing the police of the Solid Democratic South attacking protesters of darker skin. Democracy is racist.
@megxnhxrris Article IV, Section 4, Clause 2. Storming the borders of the southwestern States constitutes an invasion of those States. A wall is a fortification which helps to repel invasions. Clause 1 would provide the militia which is the other part of repelling invasions.
@LouDobbs @RealCandaceO ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù is more cultural democracy. Viewing citizens as ‚Äúworkers‚Äù is a democratic habit, instilled by the slaver view central to democracy.		Thus, Naziism is thoroughly democratic and is therefore thoroughly despicable.
@LouDobbs @RealCandaceO We Republicans are not Conservative Democrats. Rather, we oppose democracy.		The National Socialist German Worker‚Äôs Party was Democratic on several levels. The grab-bag name is democratically motivated, designed to get votes from many groups. Nationalism is cultural democracy.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino With free immigration, people entering the USA in peace should be allowed to reside with us in what should be a land of Liberty. The problem with doing this is that we have failed to make this a land of Liberty for the people already here. The remedy is eliminate all slavery.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino No. It means that making immigration selectively illegal:	1. prevents an Uniform Rule of Naturalization, and	2. Invalidates the Mayflower Compact and thus any successor body politic, including the United States of America.	It is a matter of the legal underpinnings of the USA.
I support neighborhood walls, village walls, and city walls, in addition to walls for a country. All of these walls would have gates and markets and transport. They would also have militia to defend them.		I also support free immigration AND liberty within the walls.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino Again, try reading what I wrote. I also favor the building of walls for neighborhoods, villages and cities. Such walls would prevent motorists from running down my neighbors. The question is: do you support walls which repel invasions of your neighborhood?
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino Try reading my tweets instead of sputtering out the Democratic nonsense. As a Communist Republican, I am strong supporter of defensive walls. That is encoded in the word ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino The wall has nothing to do with immigration. Rather, it is a fortification to help repel invasions, as part of Article IV, Section 4, of the Constitution. The other part of that plan was a Republican form of government for the States, from whence local Militia called up.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino I wrote my own poem and song about free immigration:	https://t.co/3bVGuKcbHc
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino Except that there is not, nor can there be ‚Äúillegal immigration‚Äù into the United States of America. The poem and the Statue signify something different about immigration: that immigrants into the country should be liberated, not enslaved. That policy defies both Left and Right.
@RBReich ‚ÄúSocialism for the rich‚Äù = ‚Äúmercantilism‚Äù
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino It was only ‚ÄúThe New Colossus‚Äù which gave a popular meaning to the Statue of Liberty, and that  after a space of many years. Also, the Chinese Exclusion Act established a new indentured servanthood in law, in clear violation of the Thirteenth Amendment; the hypocrisy was plain.
The Democratic RINOs and mainstream Democrats expose their support of wage slavery by having conniptions over providing the necessities to everyone, including those unwilling to work for mercantilists. It is only that unconditional provision which can create a free labor market.

@DineshDSouza The Constitution debunks the democratic notion that immigrants can be illegal. Immigration law, from the Chinese Exclusion Act on, prevents an Uniform Rule of Naturalization.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino The Constitution refutes the claim that immigrants can be illegal, as does the Mayflower Compact.		What the poem and its meaning convey to the Statue is the notion of a nurturing and liberating immigration. Otherwise, the statue is an emblem to hypocrisy.
@toddjstewart @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino My point is that the free immigration movement was active then and was was critical of the hypocrisy of erecting a statue for a liberty which did not exist for immigrants feeding the mercantilists‚Äô factories. It was key to popular support for the Statue.
@CNN ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù is a democratic category. Democrats like to cast their privilege in their own framework, in order to share and redirect the blame. There is only democratic privilege and democracy is racist.		By the way, there is only one human race.
@ShellyswedbergS Long before, when Nineveh Trump failed to heed my preaching here https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU, did he bring his movement down.

@Cakedaddy4ever @johncusack Outside of democracy, slaves were prisoners of war which could be exchanged with other states for their prisoners of war. It was the Attic Democracy which made permanent slavery on the basis of a categorization into people (Greek-speaking) and not-people (barbarians).
@Cakedaddy4ever @johncusack Racism, ethnic cleansing, and genocide are part and parcel of Democracy and Society. They only come in to Socialism, including the Socialism of Marx and Engels, through that ideology advocating Democracy and Society as the vehicle for Republican reforms.
@dbongino Socialism is the attempt to achieve Republicanism through Democratic means. The only problem with Socialism with Democracy. Democracy is a system of slavery, privilege and rule. Democracy is only viable when the people believe the Big Lie of ‚Äúvicarious rule‚Äù.	#EradicateDemocracy

@ShimshockAndAwe Broadcast media of any form is propaganda, not news. If you do not have a local paper with a Letters to the Editor section, there is no press in your town. The web has exacerbated this condition, with or without pay walls, because comments do not have their own section.
@Cakedaddy4ever @johncusack Marx and Engels were socialists who saw the eventual course of history resulting in a reversion to communism, but with the industrial means of production run by workers‚Äô communes. They saw the advancement of industrial mercantilism (mislabeled ‚ÄúCapitalism‚Äù) as a necessary step.
@Cakedaddy4ever @johncusack Actually, Stalin, as the ‚Äúethnicities problem‚Äù guy, was a Democrat. Fidel Castro was a Nationalist Democrat who adopted Stalinism. Mao was another supporter of democracy who forced urbanites onto ‚Äúcommunes‚Äù which were de facto democratic plantations.

Then, when I think of my early work in workspace languages and then in databases, I realize again how wrongheaded the algorithm tests and order notation of complexity are. Results are stored. Knowledge is stored as much as dumb data.		Yet to get a job, I have to act on stupidity.
Complexity theory assigns little Gauss the speed drill, make work task of adding the numbers from one to hundred, to keep him busy with 99 additiins. Creative software development is little Gauss deducing n(n+1)/2 and using n=100 to come up with the solution in three operations.
first grade, frustrated about the speed drills they were giving us, I remember anew. The speed of the algorithm is irrelevant when a formula can replace it. Complexity theory is quickly  adding the numbers from one to a hundred; mathematics is deducing a formula to replace it.
Then when I try to get a new job in software development, I am expected to accept as truth the sheer nonsense of complexity theory. Going through Aho, Hopcroft, and Ulman, now, I remember how it made me roll my eyes then. The story my Mom told me about Gauss when I came home from

@Noahpinion 16. Health insurance is a leveraging (Ponzi) scam and Medicare is simply the public version of it. We need to abolish health insurance and establish Municipal Medical Departments providing medical care free to the people. See (8).
@Noahpinion 15. The end of mercantilist imperialism, which had been driven by "working for a living" and "jobs, jobs, jobs" hysteria, will encourage local production and a Ricardian trade model. Goods, not people, will be transported across the globe, thus reducing air travel by choice.
@Noahpinion 13. Thus an unconditional provision will result, not in "the gubermint takin' ma cars", but in citizens saying "Take this car and shove it!"	14. Similarly, a restructuring of households based on affinity rather than commercialism will also reduce travel.
@Noahpinion 11. Thus, these citizens will only go to a job which pays them enough to make it worth it for them; citizens can decide to make things from home, so that the employer bears this opportunity cost.	12. Car commutes add another cost which a truly free labor market may not bear.
@Noahpinion 9. For a corroborating view, see Keynes and his pyramids, or Trump and his wall.	10. An unconditional provision of the necessities which truly provides the necessities will allow citizens to be citizens, rather than workers, consumers, or voters; they need not commute.
@Noahpinion 7. The question then becomes whether the provision of the necessities is conditional or not; sound economic reasoning removes arbitrary conditions such as employment.	8. The "cost" of fiscal spending is a fundamental fallacy, as is "taxpayer's money": https://t.co/e1XfuIGLom
@Noahpinion 5. What UBI does is to cover up the abysmal failure of "working for a living" and demand that any unconditional provision "work" by achieving the same degree of wage slavery.	6. We need to dispense with the UBI straw man and "working for a living" foolishness.
@Noahpinion 3. Our go-to provision is "working for a living", which has never worked. It failures is the fall of empires.	4. By eliminating the chains between working and living, we make life more sustainable; there is no need for imperialist shoving of products down foreign throats.
@Noahpinion 1. Universal Basic Income is a straw man to an unconditional provision of the necessities to all.	2. A provision of the necessities to all is a requirement for any political economy. I prove this in "Popular Capitalism" [https://t.co/JMO8bO0YHK]

@denise_kandra @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino Actually, the right exploited immigrants for their skills in order to reduce wages, generally and specifically, as they still do. The left exploited immigrants for their votes, as they still do. Nice try in absolving the right. It did not work.
@denise_kandra @steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino It is important to remember that Lazarus' views were not of the left or of the right. The nurturing mother in "The New Colossus" not only brings in immigrants, she liberates them. The right would exploit them for their skills, the left for their votes.

@SpeakerPelosi @GrinnellCollege Rep. Anderson spread that suggestion and warning, but was rejected by the motorist democracy, by the so-called ‚Äúlove affair with the automobile‚Äù. That is not love, but an addiction of the public to the drug of private driving.
@SpeakerPelosi That was in early 1979, in my senior year @GrinnellCollege, when John B. Anderson visited, to explore a bid for the Presidency, and gave a talk @HerrickChapel. Rep. Anderson recognized the wisdom of my suggestion and warning, commending me for that wisdom.
@SpeakerPelosi Morality is a lie. It is Love which tells us to be faithful stewards of Nature. From Love and its Wisdom did I, to Rep. John B. Anderson, both suggest a resource tax on petroleum products and warn of the destruction of Nature which would ensue if we were not weaned from oil.
@steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino @MrTrumpLA As a Republican, I share those free immigration views. On the occasion of the centennial of Statue of Liberty, I composed the song I recorded here:	https://t.co/MK34zs33vf
@steph93065 @SharNeal @dbongino @MrTrumpLA Technically, you are both right. The statue was a gift of the French in commemoration of our mutual love of liberty. The installation was funded through a campaign popularized by the Emma Lazarus poem, presenting her free immigration views.

@realDonaldTrump Actually, economies do not work like that. They are not a competition between countries. The wealth of nations, to paraphrase Adam Smith, is in the unique genius of their peoples.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC The peacefulness of communism is defended by Republicanism. Far too often, Republicans have had to revolt against the democratic oppressors of Communists. We would prefer for a Cromwell or a Robespierre not to be necessary  ‚Äì and not to be betrayed when they turn democrat.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Communism is peaceful. Society is violent. Democracy is murderous and oppressive. Of the three, I gladly choose Communism.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC The natural state of humanity is to prosper, not to mindlessly grow so that it can pay interest to a bunch of usurers or to enslave more humans as ‚Äúnot people‚Äù so that the democrats can give privileges to their ‚Äúpeople‚Äù. Heaven help us if democracy infects another planet!
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC ‚ÄúThose Separatists are not spinning straw into gold like the Spanish colonists are. Let‚Äôs blame it on their Christian communism rather than our unrealistic democratic mercantilist expectations of the eastern seaboard of North America. Besides we need to satisfy our lenders.‚Äù
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC What has never worked is democracy. Its system of mercantilist exploitation is systemically inconsistent. Then when the hierarchical structure of democratic mercantilism starts to collapse, democratic propagandists blame everything and everyone else.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Communism does not need to ‚Äúwork‚Äù. Communism is simply the natural form of household organization. It is what it is.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC By the way, I could solve Venezuela‚Äôs problems, but the IMF would not like that I helped get that country out of their clutches. By the way, I am not a socialist. Socialism is based on the erroneous belief that you can get to communism through democratic means.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Democratic mercantilists have robbed Venezuela of its natural resources and have put it under a regime of debt which the decline in global oil prices make the country unable to pay. Plus, Venezuelans were enticed into an addiction to private automobiles, thus motorist democracy.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC It is democracy which is godless. It has been so even before it was called ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Dorothy Day coined the word ‚Äúcommunitarian‚Äù because the democrats had so corrupted the usage of the word ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù. I am not willing to concede the democratic abuse of terminology. Rather, ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù deserves to be word associated with the evils of democracy.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC I am Hegelian, myself, and also a follower of the Way of the Christ Jesus. Marx‚Äô error was his belief in materialism. Hence the false attribution to capital (a physical entity) of the properties of loans (an abstract entity). ‚ÄúDas Wucher‚Äù should have been the title of his book.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Again, Communists are, like myself, advocates of a form of household. The form of government we naturally support is republican. Marx propounded a theory of how mercantilism will collapse and leave communist households with a bunch of machinery.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC The Bolsheviks, in a civil war, fought like they were in a war. Surprise! On top of that, the Democracy in Russia had destroyed the country for a war to protect J. P. Morgan‚Äôs loans to the British and French. For that latter point, see https://t.co/lyBuCIX6Hg
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC It is by mislabeling that the Democratic propagandists in the so-called ‚Äúpublic schools‚Äù indoctrinate the young into believing nonsense. There is no such thing as a ‚Äúcommunist government‚Äù. Yet, by mislabeling, you were led to misapply information.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC The Soviet Union never achieved Communism. It barely made a start before that Democrat, Stalin, purged the so-called ‚ÄúCommunist Party‚Äù of any actual Communists.		What you were told was that Stalinism was communist when it was, in fact, democratic.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC The Kings and Tsars were democrats, royal democrats. The Tsars were Caesarean Democrats; their name comes from the Caesars. Julius Caesar was the Great Democrat and showed what all democracies become, what they are designed to become: totalitarian empires.
@WilliamQuake1 Yet it is the communist household, the tribe, the ‚Äúcollege of extended families‚Äù as I call it in ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù, which retains wealth across generations, which does the only meaningful saving, and which could more ably build up the civic weak of its republic.
@WilliamQuake1 Communism does not fail; it is attacked. Indeed, all of us are attacked by democracy and its mercantilism, divided into nuclear and subatomic families, whose wealth dissipates from becoming empty nests and discarding homes like worn-out shoes.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC Not at all. The real threat to this country is democracy. The real defense of this country is in the formation of self-sufficient households holding their land and buildings in common and in perpetuity.		I realize that this flies in the face of everything you were told in school.
@WilliamQuake1 @AOC I would not attack communism at all. Democrats and their supporters attack communism because communist households would provide a sure defense against democracy and is the basis of a true Republicanism.		Communist households provide an assurance of place and thus of citizenship.

@AOC to water it down.	10. The Civil Rights of 1960, also passed during the Eisenhower administration, closed some of the loopholes which Democrats had put into the 1957 Act.	11. President Kennedy, a Liberal Democrat, made the Eisenhower program one of his goals, but was assassinated

@AOC 8. Against this backdrop, war hero Eisenhower, whose Republicanism was problematic, conceded the notion of democratic elections in the States, even though that went against Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution, and merely advocated the right of ‚Äúblacks‚Äù to vote in them.
@AOC the 1950‚Äôs was when Democratic RINO Joe McCarthy began his vicious attacks against Communism, which is the very basis of Republicanism, with the full support of Joe Kennedy, who sent his son, Robert, to assist Senator McCarthy in his anti-Republican, pro-Democracy purge.

@Noahpinion The only jobs which people believe valuable are the ones they do for themselves. The lack of an unconditional provision of the necessities prevent them from working on those jobs.
@Noahpinion @bopinion Given that there is no unconditional provision of the necessities, people are under duress and therefore incapable of walking away from positions which do not pay people what they think they are worth. Therefore, there is no basis for determining what they are really worth.
@RyanAFournier @cornelianeluta That, at least, makes sense. It is up to the State of Michigan to rectify this matter.

What the Christ Jesus conquers is Morality. The Word of God, Love Incarnate is the victor over Morality. For with Morality comes Power and Death but, with the Crucifixion, even with its worst tool of Power and Death, Morality could not kill the Love which is in Christ Jesus.
Please Retweet (RT) this:	https://t.co/lfmz5iPfvb	and follow @cpklapper.		The public needs to read this in this time of declarations of political candidacy and, it is quite clear from the public discourse, they have not read it.		Thank you.
I urge any who still have an open mind, who have not checked their brains at the door of their respective liberal and conservative faiths, to "follow" me in this medium of Twitter. You will always get an interesting and nuanced view from me. Also, I do not do morality.
My critique of the new "atheism" is in my book "The Fallacies of Atheism", not in anything @DineshDSouza has written. Since, in that book, I agree with the new "atheists" about some of the fallacies they point out, it should be clear that I offer a true critique, not a screed.
As a communist republican, I am neither a conservative nor a liberal. My political economy can be found in my book, "Popular Capitalism", not in any books or articles coming from liberals or conservatives. Ditto for my solution to the fiscal crises of today in "The Way Out..."

@cornelianeluta People fall the democratic pablum and vote for a bunch of politicians who want to rule, not serve, all because they think the vicarious rule of democracy is real. It is a con. Folks have been had. It is a fairy tale where the prince gives the kiss of death.
@cornelianeluta Democracy is a lie based on a categorization which is the very definition of racism. If someone is in the not-demos category, then they are enslaved or bred for slavery. People are then flattered by being put in the demos category, given privileges and vicarious ‚Äúrule‚Äù.
@cornelianeluta It is more insidious than that. We are bombarded with messages suggesting that democracy is good. We are told that something threatens ‚Äúour‚Äù democracy. The first time, I laughed. No, it is THEIR democracy and if it dies, I will cheer. By the three millionth time, I retch.
I am frustrated that the gibberish of the Democrats, both Conservative and Liberal, is worshipped, while my books are sitting on the shelves, unsold.		The $15/hr minimum wage will do nothing, at best. The tax cut is a joke. You will not get rich with either, nor even survive.

@jodiecongirl Some things are a matter of principle. Though I am opposed to elections, in general, I agree with those who favor elections on this general point: IF we are to have elections, THEN every eligible voter should be able to vote, free from the demands of employers on the voting day.
@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC 12. The unemployment statistics are therefore in dire need of updating, from a number of different angles, and their flaws are regularly exploited by politicians to falsely present a case of prosperity amid want.
@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC 10. Many companies will not bring on consultants these days, forcing many consultants to take on "permanent" jobs;	11. The employment status of independent consultants has always been problematic, the fees often going to smooth out spurts of shot-term contracts over a year;

@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC 7.

@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC 3. I had planned more than a year ago to move to NYC to focus on publishing my books and on some family issues, getting employment at my old rate being more of a back-up plan;	4.

@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC FYI:	1. I was employed in NYC 17 years ago with a six-figure income;	2. I was divorced 15 years ago, and lost my six-figure job in NYC shortly after and as a result of the divorce; [I was going to couples' counseling instead of protecting my job from a new middle manager.]
@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC When we add in the property tax on housing prices which have been grossly inflated by mortgage loans, the loss of unemployed residents can artificially lower the jobless rate through the denominator.
@flojonic1 @charliekirk11 @AOC Your claim that the jobless rate has declined since I left shows nothing. Jobs in New Jersey are notoriously low-paying and are only suitable for long-time home-owners with low mortgage payments. Many renters leave the State because they lose their jobs in NYC or Philly.

@wordlass1 @tannerstake I was talking about LBJ the Congressman, not LBJ the President. LBJ and Lady Bird became rich when he was a member of Congress. We were not talking about Presidents.
@wordlass1 @tannerstake The way in which you were switching the topic was in bringing up the President, who is in a different branch of government. We were talking about Congress.		And your ad hominem attacks against me were your insinuation that I am biased.

@oliverbeige In other words, currency is ‚Äúmoney as a medium of exchange‚Äù, while commodity is the discredited ‚Äúmoney as a store of value‚Äù. The error lies in a false history of money coming out of barter, which supposedly ended. Barter is still here in commodity for commodity transactions.
@oliverbeige Unfortunately, the terminology has been so muddled in recent years that we are speaking of different things. I am of the ‚Äúsoft money‚Äù school, which is rooted in money as currency. This is differentiated from ‚Äúhard money‚Äù which is rooted in the notion of money as commodity.
@oliverbeige That would be ‚Äúthe wealth of nations‚Äù rather than a currency. I am more in line with Adam Smith and David Ricardo in seeing the wealth of nations being ultimately in the genius of the people, reflected in their labor, but differ on democracy (nation-state) defining ‚Äúthe people‚Äù.
@oliverbeige Stability in a currency defies its mandate: that it be free flowing (currere, ‚Äúto run, hasten‚Äù) and thus to facilitate transactions. In that regard, a good counterfeit is as much a currency as the official issuance.
@DavidGibbons @oliverbeige @framboso The technology is blockchain. Its application to payment security awaits the end of its misguided use as a commodity and mercantilist currency. The crypto-commodity is effectively an e-tulip and crypto-currencies from different standards are effectively private bank notes.
@SenatorHassan Millions of us have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars during this Great Depression II due to underemployment and unemployment which softens us up for underemployment, however you racist, slaver Democrats care nothing for that or us. This is &gt; $200Billion lost because of you.
There is no such thing as a ‚Äúcommodity currency‚Äù. The term is an oxymoron. Either something is a commodity and has value which you barter for other commodities. Or it is a currency, which is created by being spent, running from hand to hand, until destroyed by being received.

@KPelos0 @BernieSanders Here in NYC, most people cannot afford a roof over their heads because of the mortgage loan hyperinflating real estate prices and that pushing rents up. As for investment savvy, the Street has lots of people who did not get that from schooling, if that is what you are suggesting.

@LevineJonathan Regardless, it is bad advice. I have spent the better part of my 44 years of software development writing programs which write code. If the only thing you learn to do with computers is write code, your job will be automated out of existence.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders I have addressed each of those schemes in the past, but my current focus -- aside from getting exposure for "Popular Capitalism" and "The Way Out..." -- is in abolishing the mortgage loan. That will be part of what I will be trying to convey to our legislators in Albany on 2/16.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders However, without an unconditional provision as policy, many will have no way of accumulating savings. The cost of living can easily outstrip wages, due, in part, to several Ponzi/leveraging schemes: mortgage loans, health insurance, and student loans.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders With an unconditional provision as policy, someone may choose to work a job to accumulate savings with which to invest. Then their research into companies will allow them to make wise choices for their investments, which may result in a great return in dividends.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders An unconditional provision of the necessities also removes the dependence on multiple revenue streams just to survive. What it does is allow the individual to decide what they are going to do with their life. All options are open, none are mandatory.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders If you want to learn about my work, you can read ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders It is quite the opposite. I am presenting to you a few conclusions of a lifelong study of the problem of poverty and you think that I should believe some nonsense somebody told you.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders The standard copout when you have lost an argument.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders An unconditional provision REMOVES the dependence on employment. The humorous acronym for job, as ‚Äújust over broke‚Äù, shows how people have correctly determined that employment is what makes them dependent and broke.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders I just said what it would be in the present economy: #1500DollarWeeklyStipend. The key words are ‚Äústipend‚Äù and ‚Äúweekly‚Äù. Removing the dependence on wages is essential, as is its parsing out week by week.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders 6. The measure of investment is the dividend, not the stock price.	7. Targeting stock prices leads to speculation, in which most people lose and the few winners gain by cashing out a fortune similar to your lottery winner.	8. Windfall winners are like kids in a candy store.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders 3. The point of education is to benefit others, not to amass fortunes.	4. The point of investing is to produce things which are needful. For this, wealth is risked, not retained.	5. Investment acumen is only one kind of wisdom one might gain from education; most might not.
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders 1. I personally know that education without an independent survival income prevents the acquisition of wealth. The reason is the inability to negotiate pay for what the education is worth, due to the duress of survival.	2. There is no need for wealth if there is regular income.
@realDonaldTrump Plus, we can start paying down the debt.	Plus, we can end #TheGreatDepressionII (or three if we count the Long Depression)
@realDonaldTrump The shutdown mechanism can be eliminated by taking ‚ÄúThe Way Out...‚Äù	https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU
@KPelos0 @BernieSanders False. Providing the necessities unconditionally to all liberates all from the duress of survival when negotiating for pay or when starting a business venture. Anything else people get is gravy. It also obviates retirement savings and investment savvy. #1500DollarWeeklyStipend.
@MavrelousMavrel @LilRodneyDanger @BernieSanders We have always needed an unconditional provision of the necessities. Making it conditioned on employment has led to disastrous military exploits to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù jobs.	https://t.co/jb0AotJT1I
@BernieSanders If we had an unconditional provision of the necessities, as I propose and expound upon in ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù, and as I express in my #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance and #1500DollarWeeklyStipend hashtags, we would not need retirement savings.	https://t.co/s7nec5pu6v
There is a reason why highways are associated with violent theft and murder, as in the word ‚Äúhighwayman‚Äù. On the road, one is without the protection of walls. The highway is one long bridge, invading the countryside, plundering and polluting the country and any hamlet in its way.
It is the lack of walls in the American frontier which branded that ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù and America, herself, as uncivilized. That she is, at this late date, still without walls for its cities and towns is an embarrassment, not a badge of honor.
Walls are more ancient than even those protecting medieval towns, which democratic apologists ignorantly mock. Yet the nomadic camps without walls, which are favored by democracies, are even more ancient and primitive than the walled city. The wall is the basis of civilization.
Bridges are tools of invasion. Either side of the span is invaded without a word of welcome.
A door or gate, set in the communist wall, is where visitors are welcomed into a communist household, a ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù in the true sense of that word. It has no purpose without the wall.		When the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp ‚Äúbeside the golden door‚Äù, there is a protecting wall.
Mr. Trump gave a succinct definition of ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù when he said ‚ÄúWe do not build walls because we hate the people on the outside, but because we love the people on the inside.‚Äù
The root meanings of ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù, and ‚Äúcommunion‚Äù are all derived from the Latin word ‚Äúcommunire‚Äù, meaning ‚Äúto build a defensive wall around‚Äù. Communism, community, and communion are ALL based on the protection of a wall. Inside the wall, Love can grow.
‚ÄúCommunism‚Äù is PRECISELY the word for the life lived together by neighbors, where ‚Äúmy home is your home‚Äù, where generosity and hospitality joins neighbors together in communal love, in ‚Äúcommunion‚Äù. ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù refers to one instance of communism. #CommunismIsGood
Democratic propaganda has so infected the minds of citizens that they hate the communism which saved the Union and live the democracy which tried to destroy it. #CommunismIsAmerican
@legodfw @pulte That is the LAST thing that should be done. The mercantilists, McDonald‚Äôs, Starbucks, Walmart, CVS, and the like have done enough damage to city neighborhoods as it is.
@beth2_k3a @WilliamQuake1 @ConDailyPost That is democracy and society at work AGAINST the communism of a family. It is similar to the home invasion of landlords asserting their private property rights over the communist life of tenant families. My family suffered the latter from a landlord trying to sell the building.
@blkberrycastle @BoonexPhilip Actually, no. The Electoral College was meant to give the small States a say in selecting the chief of the executive branch, while also giving the larger States a larger say, AND to select as the executive branch‚Äôs vote in &amp; president of the Senate the runner-up in that contest.

@charliekirk11 As for the so-called ‚Äúillegals‚Äù, they are the consequence of democracy and mercantilism.

@nowthisnews @AOC There is a more pernicious shibboleth infecting the minds of  the public, which I discuss here:	https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU
@nowthisnews @AOC Of course, it is a marginal tax rate. Chalk that up to the refusal to offer political economy in the public schools. At home, I read and critiqued Henry George's "Progress and Poverty" when I was 10, John Stuart Mill's "On Political Economy" when I was in Middle School.
@AOC The cities and the boroughs are the last hold-outs of the pedestrian and, consequently, of the independent journalism of local papers.
@AOC In the motorist democracy, neighbors are irrelevant, and so are local rags. If they read a newspaper other than the majors, it is some fake-local, Gannetized advertising sheet, with the high school sports teams switched into the national template. There are no letters, no forum.
@AOC Actually, democracy is the reason journalism is being monopolized. It is the motorist democracy, to be precise, which has people sneaking into their cars in sprawl, driving to some job in the middle of nowhere, their only civic activity being a vote for someone they see on TV.

@realDonaldTrump You can keep the government open, pay off the federal debt gradually, and bring a real prosperity to the country by taking ‚ÄúThe Way Out...‚Äù https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU		You can use the military budget to repel the invading hordes, by fortifications (wall) and troops.
@WhiteHouse Congress should fulfill its obligation to defend the States against invasion. One Golden Horde was repelled. Another has formed.
@hammetjohn Republicanism has been under attack my entire life, chiefly through the motorist democracy and its atomization and alienation of households. The so-called ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù Platform of 2016 was an endorsement of motorist democracy and its attack on Republicanism.
@hammetjohn In brief, Republicans adhere to Republicanism, which has a presumption of households which hold their land and buildings in common and in perpetuity. Such households are autonomous, its members are not beholden to external interests, and they send delegates to their republic.
@hammetjohn Conservatives are not Republicans, however much the Machine Democracy and their fellow Conservatives claim they are. The Machine Democracy is not Liberal; that is why we have Libertarians.
@realDerekUtley @realDonaldTrump Yet it is quite clear that this country has repelled one invading horde and that another is amassing. Actual refugees would stop at the first place they were offered succor. The caravan hordes have not. Actual refugees would not have automobiles and their own food and water.
@realDerekUtley @realDonaldTrump I am a Republican. I support nobody. The Constitution requires Congress to guarantee a republican form of government in the States and to defend the States against invasion. Congress has been derelict on both parts of Art. IV Sec. 4. The Machine Democrats are Invasion-Deniers.
@hammetjohn There are no Republicans now in Congress who went in as such. Lindsay Graham became a Republican during the Kavanaugh hearing. All the other incumbents are politicians, de facto Democrats.
@hammetjohn @SharNeal There are Republicans and then there are politicians. The Republicans stand on principle and present reforms of general benefit. The politicians get elected.

@Trump454545 @lucybaiers Tobin equivocated. He and the rest of them are worried about public perception, and they think that the public perception is wrong. They are still talking like the propagandists they are and will continue to be. The network heads control who goes on and who gets canned.
@realhublife @realDonaldTrump I would be in favor of a federal Union of North America, but that is not what the Democratic Party wants. They want a Democracy, a Dictatorial Democratic Empire like they had with The Great Democrat, Julius Caesar, and his successors in Rome after he overthrew the Republic.
@Trump454545 No. I left that nonsense behind when I moved back to my native New York.
On the other hand, if no such opportunity is afforded, my disappointment will not be for myself, but for this country. My goal remains to end poverty, and that means a sinecure of life for all more than any success for myself. That is simply the way I am made up.
If I am afforded the opportunity to serve this country for the greater good of all, I will take it. It matters not to me if I am declared evil; I have been declared good and have rejected that declaration. If I am set upon by society, it would not be the first or the 101st time.
We are all flawed human beings, so there is no merit in resisting any one in power. If someone as flawed as Mr. Trump can do a few good things in office, are we to prevent those good things? Yet that is the attitude of some of my friends, eager to impeach the good with the bad.
Another area of agreement is in Congress‚Äô Constitutional obligation to defend the States against invasions. There may be other areas of agreement, ones in the other direction since I sent Mr. Trump two of my books on political economic policy. I stand ready to assist in those.
So many of my friends have fallen down the rabbit hole of condemning the President as a person, falsely thinking that their outrage is a substitute for policy analysis. And though there are plenty of areas where I disagree with the President, peacemaking is not one of them.

@TomFitton @howard74 @realDonaldTrump 1. Laws about immigration are anti-Constitutional, preventing an uniform rule of naturalization.	2.

From the tribal communism of the indigenous tribes, from the Christian communism of the Separatist Puritans and the religious communism of dozens of other groups fleeing persecution, ...
@DonaldJTrumpJr @BradMoo08282326 @realDonaldTrump Do you not see? Democracy is vile, is theirs and is supported by their propaganda, not undermined. Democracy needs to be eradicated, not protected.
Walter Cronkite lied to us, yet we were told to trust him. Vapid pretty-heads replaced the journalists on the commercial network news broadcasts, and we were supposed to trust them. Would-be Cronkites populated PBS, and we were supposed to trust them.		Some of us never did.
@hughhewitt Someone like myself, who is loth to use vulgarity, rarely grows a sizable readership online, however estimable that readership may be. The vulgar and the profane encounter no such difficulty, Mr. Trump being only one such example. Quantity compensates for quality.

@RandPaul I have long noted, even before my run for Tompkins County (NY) Representative, in the 5th District, that the failure to establish an unconditional provision of the necessities places pregnant women under duress and compels them to seek abortions for purely economic reasons.

@dbongino It is, indeed, only a matter of time before our own sovereign debt becomes unpayable, thus producing hyper-inflation in the same way as did the German war reparations debt and, currently, Venezuela‚Äôs IMF debt. The effectual end to Breton Woods is when we are in the same boat.
@dbongino As for your analysis, it is based on a false premise: that deficits must be paid by borrowing money. That premise needlessly handcuffs a country, which has the sovereign power to create money. Worse, the sovereign debt so incurred and perpetuated can cause hyper-inflation.

@Intelligencia76 @lmramey @SenBillBrady @capitolfax @DanProft @MancowMuller @John_Kass @PoliticalEditor @MaryAnnAhernNBC @JohnHowellWLS Actually, New Jersey has one of the lower gasoline taxes in the country.
@Intelligencia76 @lmramey @SenBillBrady @capitolfax @DanProft @MancowMuller @John_Kass @PoliticalEditor @MaryAnnAhernNBC @JohnHowellWLS From an economic perspective, taxes are disincentives, with people and markets adjusting to those disincentives.

@realDonaldTrump The passive defense of a wall is necessary in the defense against invasion by the caravan hordes. It is not sufficient. We also need the militia, which can only come from a Republican form of government for the States in our Union. Article IV, Section 4, is all of a piece.
@dbongino The problem is the concentration of wealth in a few hands. All other things being equal, income inequality is needed to solve that problem. Chalk the inanity of attacking the solution up to the demagoguery of democracy.
@ProudResister Being male, myself, I resent being lectured to by the promoters of morality, society, and democracy. All three institutions are manifestly evil and vicious, because all three give some mortals power like god, defining themselves as good people and all others as evil people.
@dbongino Thus, the unconditional provision creates more opportunities for us to earn money by our industry AND induces a geometric series whose total is an asymptotic upper bound of ALL money which will remain from the unconditional throughout time, all with no changes to tax rates.
@dbongino An unconditional provision of the necessities monetizes new demand which generates new economic activity, hence new revenue AT EXISTING TAX RATES. What portion of this new money is not destroyed by becoming revenue in the first cycle then generates new economic activity, etc.

My position regarding firearms: https://t.co/OD0XnPsner
@mccaffreyr3 These militia, placed under the discipline established by Congress, are the well-regulated militia of the Second Amendment. Each communist household, being from whom such militia are drawn, is a people having a Constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
@mccaffreyr3 Local communist households can be formed and can build their walls, keeping motorists and their cars out. This makes the households defensible, leading to the formation of republics with their own walls, and then militia, defending the member communist households.
@mccaffreyr3 Consequently, such an unconditional provision can be established in fulfillment of the Article IV, Section 4, obligation to guarantee a republican form of government. This then moves the country away from the motorist democracy which has strangled it these many decades.
@mccaffreyr3 It is therefore a Republican reform to establish a systematic provision of the necessities, without condition or requirement, to each individual of each communist household, in order to ensure their virtue, i.e. their NOT being beholden to any would-be ruler. #PopularCapitalism
@mccaffreyr3 The communism of each ‚Äúgens‚Äù can only go so far in maintaining that virtue. Those in a poorer gens may become beholden to outside interests and rulers. Those within a prosperous gens may become beholden to those aspiring to rule there.
@mccaffreyr3 Those communist households are the essential building blocks of a republic. They are the autonomous units which send delegates to the seat of a republic to govern the public matter. It is crucial that delegates be their own men, be virtuous from ‚Äúvir‚Äù meaning ‚Äúman‚Äù.
@mccaffreyr3 The building of a defensive wall, ‚Äúmunire‚Äù, prefaced by ‚Äúcum‚Äù, meaning either together or thoroughly as in surrounding, is what defines a communist household or tribe. The aspect of sharing, of holding the land and the buildings in common, is rooted in life within the wall.
@mccaffreyr3 I consider Article IV, Section 4 to be pivotal to the Constitution. My understanding of a republican form of government was and is imbued with the principles of the Roman Republic. In that respect, my understanding of communism is rooted in its Latin etymology, from ‚Äúcommunire‚Äù.
@mccaffreyr3 I handled firearms in Boy Scout camp and have not since. I have never owned a gun.		On the other hand, I am a Sherman. The catechism in our family was that cousin Roger signed all four founding documents of the United States. The Constitution is a key part of my family heritage.

@Lead1225 Calling people arrogant is an attempt to dismiss an argument through ad hominem attacks which implicitly acknowledge the superior intellect of the person advancing that argument.
@AOC @CBSNews There is only one human race. That being said, there needs to be somebody on the reporting team who is intimately familiar with the Democratic Party‚Äôs enslavement of people of color, one who accepts no substitute for abolition. I nominate Max Parthas.

The fact that conservatives do not want to admit is that hyper-inflation is caused by trying to pay an unpayable debt, in Venezuela as in Weimar Germany.
@mcsantacaterina Not for me. Then they hounded me in my email box about ordering wine for them.
@w_terrence @realDonaldTrump He still hasn't prohibited prison labor. In other words, he still has not effectively abolished slavery. Since slavery is the linchpin of democracy, and since democratic categorization is what dehumanizes "black" people, he has not yet done the key thing.
By the logic of the Conservatives, the hyper-inflation of the Weimar Republic was caused by socialism.

The so-called "toxic masculinity" is actually the toxic effect of replacing the traditional communist household with society. I have seen this and commented frequently on it from my first experience with the same-age societies in my elementary school, after skipping kindergarten. https://t.co/MYEMeSu3Ap
@RickJSportPlays @MrWyattEarpLA The conservative Democrats, for that is what they are, might destroy their wing of the Democratic Party. If that happens, it will make the political organization called ‚ÄúThe Republican Party‚Äù again available to Republicans. Regrettably, it will not eradicate democracy.
@RickJSportPlays @MrWyattEarpLA Those were never republicans, as Nelson Rockefeller pointed out in 1964. What we saw in 2016 was a grand farce of mistaken identity. Not a single republican was on the stages; every last one of them was a right-wing democrat. They could not call Trump a poseur because they were.
@mitchellvii @SharNeal He has pledged to uphold the Constitution. He is under no obligation to uphold anti-Constitutional laws such as the immigration laws. An uniform rule of naturalization is prevented preemptively by immigration laws.
@MMTpodcast If there is an unconditional provision of the necessities, as I proposed in ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù as far back as its first edition in the 1980‚Äôs, there is no need for job guarantees, nor for minimum wage laws. That unconditional provision will create its own supply, then jobs.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey The democratic mercantilist blockchain commodities used as a basis for the proposed crypto-currencies are no different than the democratic mercantilist loan commodities used as a basis for ‚Äúfederal‚Äù reserve currency. Both are the same as silver and gold in their democratization.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey Since modern democracies are wholly dependent on their mercantilist economies, the more accurate term for the process referred to as ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù is ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey The notion of ‚Äúprivatization‚Äù is therefore a rhetorical dodge. What is actually being done is a democratic mercantilist raping and pillaging of the land which was once the home of communist households.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey The ‚Äúrugged individualist‚Äù myth has been associated with the word ‚Äúprivate‚Äù in order to deceive the public. The communist household proper and the quasi-communist household of a village are both private, indeed are the private counterparts to the public matter of the republic.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey Even the quasi-communist farms of the ‚Äúfarm family‚Äù has been de-communized by separating them from their quasi-communist housemates in the village. This has been accomplished through democratic mercantilist tract housing for the ‚Äúrugged individualist‚Äù motorist.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey If that be efficient, let us have the inefficient farms of the communist household! Of course, the alleged efficiency of the mercantilist farms is a myth. The massive yields from petroleum-based fertilizers have come at the expense of the natural balance, crippling future yields.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey What we have discovered, from the ‚Äúrugged individualist‚Äù farming of the mercantilists, is that the food produced is poisonous and has to sold to a pliable mass of ‚Äúrugged individualist‚Äù motorist households through electronic propaganda to their isolated, privatized houses.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey Roughly, the Democratic Mercantilist argument has been that communist households are archaic and that people ‚Äúneed‚Äù to be in democratic motorist households supplied by mercantilist farms, lest the world starve. In lieu of an argument, appeals are oft made the ‚Äúrugged individual‚Äù.
@citizensmediatv @jodiecongirl @thepublicmoney @rohangrey As a Communist Republican, i.e. a an actual Republican, I can predict what is said here. All of my previous public policy suggestions, going back to my 1979 suggestion to John Anderson for a resource tax on petroleum products, have been attacked by the Democratic mercantilists.
@jodiecongirl Though I first treat the perilous relationship between the mercantilist monetary policy and sovereign debt in "Popular Capitalism", I provide a more succinct exposition and a more explicit remedy in "The Way Out":	https://t.co/1YJIwjpOzU
@jodiecongirl My greater disagreement is with mercantilist monetary policy: that money creation and destruction needs to be routed through the private banks. This private bank debt money is inherently unstable, being rooted in lender confidence.
@jodiecongirl I agree with Chartalism: A sovereign government creates fiscal money by spending it into the economy and destroys it by receiving it as revenue. If MMT asserts something other than this, then I will have to say I disagree it.

@realDonaldTrump @wef Congress is not fulfilling its Constitutional obligations under Article IV, Section 4, particularly that of protecting the States from invasion. The guarantee of a Republican form of government would help man a wall with militia.
Article IV, Section 4 https://t.co/QPnfmr1xdn
@AOC Those are not Republicans. They do not even call themselves that. They call themselves ‚ÄúConservatives‚Äù. In point of fact, they are conservative Democrats. They call you ‚Äúliberal‚Äù because they need to distinguish between themselves and you, though they and you are all democrats.
@Alyssa_Milano The invasion IS a real crisis. Look to the people who funded the caravan horde if you want to find someone to blame for creating the crisis, and blame the Machine Democrats, Pelosi and Schumer, for their malfeasance in keeping Congress from fulfilling a Constitutional duty.
@Alyssa_Milano There was an attempted invasion of the southwestern States by a well-funded caravan horde. Under Article IV, Section 4, Clause i (the second part) of the Constitution, Congress is obligated to protect those States from invasion. What your ‚Äúno one‚Äù does not want is irrelevant.

@jjauthor Which is why, as somebody who grew up in Yorktown, I dispute Charlie Kirk‚Äôs characterization of Yorktowners as elite, affluent, spoiled folks.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC This is where we get to the crux of the matter, Charlie. These societies would rile up their members by calling their victims ‚Äúelite‚Äù. Whether for using words considered fancy, or for being good at math, or for being ‚Äúgood‚Äù, calling someone ‚Äúelite‚Äù is how social rule is imposed.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC The only adverse aspect there were the same-age societies which the social promotion/advancement policies created in the elementary schools. Those were every bit as vicious as the societies we see online, more so because the attacks were physical and direct.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC We knew we were not destitute, but neither were we affluent. The same goes for practically everybody I grew up with in Yorktown. Those who were prosperous were generous and civic-minded. There was no elite culture in Yorktown the whole time I was there.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC Growing up, we were grateful we had a roof over our heads, hand-me-down clothing and beds from the cousins. We enjoyed meat for dinner one or two days a week, for which we were grateful. ‚ÄúBarbecued‚Äù hot dogs were one such meat dinner. We did not eat out or go on vacation.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC I went to Grinnell College on virtually a full scholarship. My high school classmates who went to college either went to one of the cheaper schools or went on a scholarship. We used whatever income we could get from summer jobs to help pay for college. Many went into the service.
@charliekirk11 @jjauthor @AOC I also grew up in Yorktown, Charlie. My Dad‚Äôs peak income was about $26K. After he died from the cancer he got from serving in the CWS in New Guinea during WWII, my Mom worked as a secretary in the city. It was my brother in Brooklyn who kept her solvent &amp; moved her to the city.

@ndgc12dx A wall would be a great aid in repelling invasions. Yes, the eradication of democracy and its mercantilist empires would be a longer-term fix. However, a wall and some divisions of the US Army positioned near the point of attempted invasions will be effectual at repelling them.
@ndgc12dx This skirts the real issue and the real responsibility of Congress under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution: to protect the States from invasion. The caravan was a horde and another has been assembled, intending to invade the United States of America.
@ndgc12dx Thus, the racist, slaver democrats focus on the problematic legalisms of the conservative and nationalist democrats, claiming that a wall would be ineffectual in stopping so-called "illegal immigrants" now. Now that a real estate developer is President?
@ndgc12dx To claim that something is ineffectual, one must have a clearly stated effect of what is to be achieved. The racist, slaver democrats do not want to state what their real purpose is: the increase in wage slaves and the purchasing of votes by racist (democratic) categories.
@TimRunsHisMouth The problem is not socialism, which is an attempt to achieve a full republicanism through democratic-social means. Rather, the problem is democracy, which has always been a lie. The people can never rule. Under any system of rule, the people are the ones who are ruled.
@IngrahamAngle There is no such thing as an ‚Äúillegal alien‚Äù. What there is, however, is an obligation of Congress to protect each of the States from invasion. Congress should build a wall and man it with troops, because hordes are attempting invasion, not because of a cost-benefit analysis.
@PARISDENNARD @alphafluffy01 Congress is obligated to guarantee a Republican form of government for the States and to protect each of them from invasion. Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution for the United States of America. Read it some time.	By the caravan horde IS an attempted invasion.

All of the approaches of the ignorant materialist thus fall flat. It is a waste of my time to instruct each of these into the nature of my faith. They aim to convert me to their cult and will not listen. They will argue that materialism is not a cult, while acting like it is.
4. My faith, to reiterate, is based on the warm, white gleam of Love within me. Though it is unlikely that you will present some fresh insight into theology that I have not already considered, I would be happy to incorporate it. Yet, that insight cannot even dim the gleam.
3. (end) Hard physical evidence in favor of Scripture also means nothing. It does not change the meaning of the story, the poem, the element of justice in the legal code, but obscures it. I view Genesis as eternal, not initial. I see key allusions to Exodus in Matthew. And so on.
3. (cont.) It is safe to say that no person of faith cares about the physical accuracy of statements in the Bible, even if it was possible to conclusively verify them. Evidence suppression is a venerable art which is practiced up to the present day, so its absence proves nothing.
3. The Scriptures which have come down to us present different perspectives, different aspects, and different expressions of the totality of Existence. The objective of even the histories is not to give an exact description of physical facts, but to elucidate facets of Existence.
2. I present my thoughts the way I do in order to prove things logically and to give a more rounded and erudite exposition. If you are determined to be an uncultured clod, I neither can nor want to bother changing that. Show yourself the door.
The actuality shows them to be presumptuous as well as wrong:	1. I never sought approval from anybody, the spirit of Love being sufficient for me. Further, I was violently attacked by societies in elementary school and, ever since, societies have tried to dictate my friendships.
3. That my faith is based on believing all statements in the Scriptures to be physically true.	4. That my thoughts on any topic are based on such a ‚Äúbelief system‚Äù.
When I quote a Scripture which aptly describes a point I am trying to make, the ignorant materialist tries to browbeat me into their cult by assuming things about me which are simply untrue:	1. That I want to be smart in the eyes of society.	2. That I need to convince them.
When a materialist comes at me, insults a-blazing, impugning my wisdom as being, in their unexamined and arrogant view, based on arguing from the authority of ‚Äúfairy-tales‚Äù, I realize that they are too set in their comfortable ignorance to have any logical discussion.
Having had a direct experience with transcendent Love, the first things I questioned were physical senses and rules.
My study of Scripture and my interaction with the practice of Christian was from the perspective of that early experience. So also my interaction with the physical world. When I have had doubts, they were also doubts of what others consider hard evidence, a complete nihilism.
The originality and the wisdom goes back to my ‚ÄúSolomon‚Äù prayer after Granny read that story to me and I made that prayer as a toddler. Being taken up in a warm, white gleam and deciding to return to earth to solve the problem of poverty, was and is the foundation of my faith.
I have been an original thinker from my youth. When I first read in political economy, at age 10, it was in a critical reading of Henry George‚Äôs ‚ÄúProgress and Poverty‚Äù, during which I discovered some flaws in George‚Äôs reasoning. My original thinking preceded the reading.

@TheMarkPantano @luckymee22 @realDonaldTrump Actually, Congress is obligated to protect each State from invasion by Article IV, Section 4, as well as to guarantee the Republican form of government which would enable the formation of the Republican militia which could be called up to man the walls for such a defense.
@milesdowndeep @CaptMalcolm @bopinion No, UBI is a fraud whose sole purpose is to dismiss and scuttle an implementation of a provision of the necessities without conditions or requirements. The UBI fraud thus allows the perpetuation of a provision of the necessities conditioned on jobs, and thus imperialism.
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion 3. A maximum number of hours per day at the work location for all jobs set at the minimum daily wage or up to twice the minimum wage, and a maximum number of hours worked per day in any event.
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion There are three reforms that I advocate which will at least make the minimum wage honest:	1. The same minimum wage for everyone and wait staff keep the gratuities on top of their wages;	2. Make it a minimum daily wage, similar to contracts set at a professional day; and
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion Those are just the rhetorical deceits. There is also the use of tips as an excuse to set a lower minimum hourly wage for servers. If we are to continue a wrong-headed policy, we should at least be consistent.
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion There are two other problems with the minimum wage rhetoric:	1. That it is a minimum HOURLY wage is glossed over, so that paid hours can be set below what are needed to live for total wages; and	2. No maximum hours, including unpaid, for a day, that being the professional dodge.
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion The bottom line is that the political economy owes us all a provision of the necessities as the cost of its own sovereignty. I prove this, and that the most efficient provision is one without conditions or requirements, in ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù. It is not ‚Äúgovernment assistance‚Äù.
@CaptMalcolm @milesdowndeep @bopinion I am perhaps more cynical. Democracy is based on a hierarchy of despotism - privilege - slavery. Therefore, the democratic politics which predominates always seeks to further slavery under the illusion of privilege in order to enhance despotism.

@bopinion Meanwhile, the unpleasant and dangerous jobs come at a premium, once the #1500DollarWeeklyStipend is in effect. Miners can command million-dollar salaries until the mining company is forced to use robots to do the mining, replacing the miner jobs with video-miner positions.
@bopinion This ability of the local residents to work as cheaply as labor in poorer countries assures the continuance of local business in the face of foreign competition. That is the exact opposite of the effect of draconian minimum wage laws.
@bopinion Indeed, if the job is amenable, the proprietor nice, the location a pleasant walk from home, and with no projects of their own, an employee of a local merchant might accept $1/hour to supplement the $1500 they get every week for the provision of their necessities.
@bopinion This consistent income can then be used to buy from local shops run by your neighbors. Their employees, freed from the duress of having to get their survival income through wages, could command what salary they want and can. Perhaps that is more than $15 per hour; perhaps less.
@bopinion The worse effect of this apologia for the minimum wage is that it distracts from real solutions to the problem of poverty. The #1500DollarWeeklyStipend, which would be untaxed and which could be supplemented, would provide a survival income with certainty and consistency.
@CouchRambo @CaptMalcolm @bopinion It is a step backward, not forward. The quirky little restaurants which kept the local money in the local economy are pushed aside in favor of massive deep-pocketed chains which sell soulless, half-rate burgers while sucking money out of neighborhoods. Minimum wage is a disaster.

@charliekirk11 @lillianmcrowley Democrats get more people needing them by restricting the provision of the necessities to the employed.

@jjauthor Therefore beware the naysayers, the disparagers, and those who insist on deceitful substitutes, such as UBI, for the unconditional provision of the necessities. Their goal is your continued enslavement with them in democracy and its mercantilist system. #1500DollarWeeklyStipend
@jjauthor An unconditional provision of the necessities will liberate the citizenry. It will allow them to be free agents in the selling or not of their labor, will allow them time for domestic chores and business, and will allow them rest and enjoyment of life. #1500DollarWeeklyStipend
@jjauthor It is only when an entrepreneur succumbs to bonds, to loans, to finance their business, instead of a thorough-going commitment of co-owners in equity stocks, that the lords of democratic mercantilism are pleased.
@jjauthor The rhetoric of mercantilists being ‚Äújob creators‚Äù is part of this democratic mercantilist strategy of picking winners and losers. The sole proprietor is shamed for not creating jobs. Indeed, they removed themselves from their job and their winner-and-loser-picking boss.
@jjauthor Democratic mercantilism, however much it hides behind a supposed ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù, is entirely devoted to picking winners in the political economies it controls. The winners are not just in the economy, but in politics, as well. Having people beg for jobs picks election winners.
@jjauthor Indeed, the current provision of the necessities is conditioned, for most people, on employment, getting their provision in the form of wages. Those firms are mostly mercantilist, concerned with the selling of goods and financed with loans. The ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù is purely democratic.
@jjauthor That benefit can come from an avenue other than parental wealth, not just from a different source of that wealth. A government can establish an unconditional provision of the necessities without picking winners and losers. #1500DollarWeeklyStipend
Fred Trump also benefited from the central planning in housing projects. All mercantilists benefit from the banking syndicates which control democracies, whether they use central planning or not.

@jjauthor The essence of that parental benefit is the ability to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to non-family-members asking for their labor.

@jvgraz @CaptMalcolm @bopinion I have read in economics since the age of 10. There is no ignorance to hide.
In the lecture where I debunk the $15 minimum hourly wage, the most heavily retweeted tweet is one which falsely suggests that minimum wage is of benefit to the regular Americans. This is the problem with Twitter as a debate forum: a religious fervor for a false policy prevails.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion Then when the ‚ÄúFight for $15‚Äù became the rage, I added $40 per week to my provision/uniform rule of naturalization $4 per week given for every week of residence up to the 365th week, thus seventh year in allusion to Jacob, to come up with the homonym #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion So it was that, after I released my second and fully explicated edition of ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù, I set the moneyed value of the unconditional provision at a level sufficient to pay the one-person analog of mortgage debt in these parts: the rent on an one bedroom apartment.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion Moreover, real estate is an economic bad, a liability. Nonetheless, the couching of the mortgage in terms of an investment, and the statistics of it being the most significant one, indicates that the mortgage is the most significant debt Americans hold.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion However, I recognize that the most substantial personal debt in this country is the mortgage. It is the flip side of the claim that people‚Äôs homes are their greatest ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù. Of course, a home is a residence, so that it can never be an investment.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion To be more precise, I wanted a position where I could get paid to write economics articles and construct economic models, where I could walk to work, and paid sufficiently to pay current bills and past business and business-related debts. After a mishap, I avoided mortgage debt.
@CaptMalcolm @CouchRambo @bopinion Automation only happens when there is an economic reason for doing so. I should know.

@CouchRambo @CaptMalcolm @bopinion The aggregate income remains the same, at best. The higher manhour costs of labor is an incentive to automate the jobs out of existence, thus possibly leading to LESS aggregate income for low-skill work.		I find minimum wage to be ineffective, at best, mildly damaging at worst.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Another dodge is to lay off the hourly workers and give the work to the salaried professional employee.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Actual hours are increased by retailers while keeping PAID hours constant, through professionalization of the position.	A sales clerk paid for 8 hours can become a sales associate working 14 but only paid for 8.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Constant labor costs = constant money available for workers to spend
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion What people fail to realize is that the minimum HOURLY wage gives a degree of freedom to employers, namely the number of HOURS. If there was a minimum DAILY wage and a MAXIMUM daily HOURS, then employers would lose that avenue toward keeping labor costs constant.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion There is no influx into the hands of consumers from a higher minimum wage. The total labor cost is, at best, unchanged.
What is ABSOLUTELY NEEDED is an UNCONDITIONAL provision of the necessities.	#ScrapThe15Minimum #DemandThe1500DollarWeeklyAllowance
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion The raising of the minimum hourly wage CANNOT benefit the working class. For every job affected, the reaction of a price-taking employer would be to cut total PAID hours. They have no choice, but they can do this and increase productivity per PAID hour. Lay-offs &amp; professionals

@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump *Servian*	Thus, the clauses of Article IV, Section 4, are all of a piece. The States of the Union are defended against invasion by the same combination of wall and militia which defends the Republican governments within them.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump The interstitial land and buildings which are the physical public matter, republic, are held in common by its member gentes and protected by a defensive wall, though often this is natural, as was the Rubicon, or set around the seat of the Republic, as were the Serbian walls.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump A key component of the communist household is the defensive wall which it builds together, its definitive function communire. Within its wall, the gens holds its land and buildings in common, what is viewed as communist in general parlance. This concept extends to res publica.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump These communist households, or gentes, are the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù in the Constitution, the people from whom local republics form militia. Thus, after re-establishing the gentes, the militia must be formed and regulated. These well-regulated militia then assist in manning the wall.
@hughhewitt @realDonaldTrump It is about part of Congressional obligation under Article IV, Section 4. We had a Golden Horde attempting invasion. As I understand it, Genghis is assembling another horde.		The other part is the formation of the communist households which are the building blocks of republics.
@ConsWahoo To be more precise, when Americans paid taxes on the earnings they made instead of a Mexican who would otherwise had crossed the border and gotten the job, and on the earnings they made because of the economic activity generated by other Americans getting those jobs.
@ConsWahoo Bryan, he did not tell us how and when. You know what? I figured out how Mexico would pay: in the loss of taxes on economic activity generated by repatriated earnings of Mexicans who would have crossed the border, but for the wall. I figured out when: after the Wall was built.
@V_of_Europe @luckymee22 All of these democrats and celebrities accruing fortunes for themselves. Why are they surprised that the people they exploit resent their wealth?	If I got into office, I would strive to make sure everybody had a #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Yes, and good riddance to them. Also, every job-home combination which requires driving will be shunned, and commuting jobs will be disadvantaged. Say hello to the pedestrian neighborhood!
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Exactly. Pleasurable jobs will find extraordinarily cheap labor. Think Bloomberg taking a $1 salary for being Mayor of New York. Nasty jobs and dangerous ones will come at a premium; Million-dollar miners will drive mining automation.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion A livable wage is one strategy for a provision of the necessities. So is crime. The point is to cut out all of the unnecessary ligature to getting people a provision. Thus the #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance is given without conditions or requirements and you can still earn wages.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Where I differ is in the assertion that people need wages in order to survive. I point out that they need income, not wages. Read #PopularCapitalism for the full exposition.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion The magnanimity at issue here is that of democracy.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Agreed. Which brings me to my counter to my illustrious cousin Franklin: no political economy can long exist that fails to provide the necessities to its citizens, nor can it prosper if it makes employment a condition of that provision. We need a #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance.
@gibbs5th @jjauthor As long as I do not sound like a democrat. I am firmly opposed to democracy. Democracy is a racist system of slavery, privilege, and despotism.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion The monopolists are not the ones who need persuading. It is the roughly 95% of hourly workers who earn more than minimum wage who do. As to your attempt to divert the discussion toward "trickle-down" demagoguery, I will note that the minimum wage increases monopolization.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion The inflation-adjusted minimum wage has declined since 1968. At best, those changes were attempts to recoup the earlier "sharing of the love". As I recall, they were promoted in just those terms. My point stands: the public does not support a minimum wage which exceeds their own.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Hence minimum hour wage increases do not work for the masses. The primary way the minimum wage gets passed is that enough people consider their wages high enough to "pass the love" of a slightly higher wage to others, i.e. few people are below it anyway.
@gibbs5th @jjauthor Yes, by virtue of being a republican and also by virtue of being a Christian.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion I am a Republican, not a Conservative. Also, I am an economist. I was not preaching doom and gloom. I was noting that minimum wage has limited scope and, within that scope, is necessarily counterproductive. It is the mechanics.
@CaptMalcolm @bopinion Correlation is not causation. In this case, the causation is the opposite from what you imply. Minimum wage increases usually pass BECAUSE the economy is good. It is a ‚Äúpass the love‚Äù sort of thing.

@gibbs5th @jjauthor No. We are supposed to be a Union of States, each of which is supposed to have a Republican form of government. A republic is based on communist households.
@gibbs5th @jjauthor We have allowed a democracy to take over our country. We have perversely attacked communism, the very basis of republicanism. Instead of militia, we have democratic police and a democratic army.

@SebGorka @Ocasio2018 The Gospel of John is better understood by substituting ‚ÄúJewish democratic supporters‚Äù for ‚ÄúJews‚Äù and ‚ÄúJewish democrat Herod‚Äù for ‚ÄúKing Herod‚Äù. Those were the political roles in operation, and they bear much similarity to democratic politics today.

The rhetoric of day ‚Äì then as now manipulated by the proponents of democracy ‚Äì called the children of Abraham ‚ÄúJews‚Äù, in an attempt to make them complicit in the democracy. Many misconstrue John.
@SebGorka @Ocasio2018 It should also be noted that, though the the communist household (gens) was familiar to officials in the early Roman Empire, that empire‚Äôs governance was already democratic (Populares) and it used local democrats like King Herod to impose their democracy and taxes on the people.
@SebGorka @Ocasio2018 The return to the communist household (‚ÄúHouse of David‚Äù) would have also occurred at the Jubilee. The Holy Family were not refugees from a foreign land, were not well-heeled tourists either, but in Bethlehem for a mandatory homecoming, where folks were being put up wherever.

@seanhannity @SharNeal This general-budget approach would assure equitable school funding separate from the property tax, hence ending the dependence on mortgage-inflated real estate prices. Thus, a two-step reform:	1. Each enrolled student conveys to their public-eligible school a fixed total fee; and
@seanhannity @SharNeal Property taxes exacerbate the flight from NYC, but they do so only because mortgages hyper-inflate real estate prices and then assessed values. Where property taxes come into play is in school funding. When I lived in New Jersey, I proposed schools being funded through students.
@seanhannity @SharNeal There has not been a middle-Income class in NYC for awhile and the reason is not high income taxes. There is a multi-tier system of rents here, rent-controlled, rent-stabilized, and mortgage-inflated-real-estate-price-based-rent. Ergo, mortgages are why the middle-class leaves.

@Ocasio2018 The house of David was a communist household based in Bethlehem. During a Jubilee year, the Holy Family could be assured a home there. That made it a reasonable place to perform official acts, such as a tax census, also for Rome since a Roman gens was also a communist household.
@Ocasio2018 Merry Second Day of Christmas! The baby Jesus is still in the manger. The Roman tax census registrars are presumably doing their thing, though the Gospels make no further mention of that reason for Jesus being born in Bethlehem. The circumstance also references ancient communism.

@KClausing GDP includes these and other forms of waste because the private sector is as prone to Keynesian pyramid-building as the public sector. Some may blame this GDP padding on monopoly-power, but the root cause is more fundamental and has wider scope, even being the reason for GDP use.

@loupgarous @jjauthor One aspect of my MMD proposal which I mentioned in my column was that of extending the federal status and funding of the MMDs to other municipal departments. The trial lawyers could then no longer pick on physicians and hospitals, or on small towns, but the federal government.
@loupgarous @jjauthor The ambulance chasers are opportunists. They would not sue for malpractice if the money was not there. The money flowing into physicians and medical centers comes via health insurance.	The trial lawyers do the same thing to municipalities because of the massive treasuries.
@loupgarous @jjauthor One institutional twist is the medical school cartel concocted by the AMA using a bogus and racist report conducted under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation. This is why medical schooling and research is a key component of my (2009) Municipal Medical Department proposal.
@loupgarous @jjauthor The research factor prices are another case of cost backfilling. The money is flowing in from the demand side, from the insurers paying out on claims. Once again, abolish health insurance and the whole price structure implodes.
@loupgarous @jjauthor Health insurance leverages patient payments to hyper-inflate ALL medical fees it covers. This includes pharmaceuticals. The root driver is health insurance. Without it, Big Pharma could not charge more than the market can bear.

@troyjensen efforts at reform, and my publishing efforts, as well as to assist my children in their precarious young adulthood.		From the fateful $700 Billion Debt Increase of the Great Crash 2008, I have been seeing the progression of the GDII through the lens of a 79-year cycle. 1939-40
@troyjensen Election. Once again, I felt like a lonely voice in the wilderness. The wrong path was taken. My attempts at creating a line of business around the ‚ÄúSquare Real Estate Deal‚Äù came to naught, as were my other attempts at establishing an independent revenue stream to sustain my
@troyjensen of the investment banks. When the TARP approach was taken, instead, I warned that the $700 billion increase in debt would crowd out small business borrowing and precipitate a second (actually third if you count the Long Depression) Great Depression. This was just before the 2008
@troyjensen financing and a third, judicial bank of the United States to adjudicate the conversion of mortgages to percentage equity transfer agreements, but could not get any publicity for it. That was my alternative to TARP, and would have averted both the mass foreclosures and the bailout
@troyjensen That was when it all came together for me, in the fall of 2008, that we had a Titanic-style collapse, that the credit default swaps compromised the CMO tranches, moving default from higher risk to lower risk until the Great Ship went down.		I proposed an alternative to mortgage
@troyjensen Yet when O‚ÄôNeal came in, his ROE strategy made even the tranches problematic. It also made our SPS group problematic, resulting in our sale to FT Interactive Data. After my second divorce, I was viewing the CMO collapse from the sidelines. It was then that I learned of the CDSs.
@troyjensen Now Rogers was a fine humorist, but he was no economist. House prices do fall. In fact, mortgage-inflated house prices collapse because the mortgage creates speculative bubbles which burst from time to time.	Nonetheless, I thought the CMOs would be kept afloat by the tranches.
@troyjensen I was leery of the stability of the CMO/ABS apparatus at Merrill when our risk management guy explained to me that the only risk he considered was prepayment risk. When I asked him about default risk, of not getting enough on the bank sale, he repeated the Will Rogers line.

From an ideological standpoint, the chief complaint we republicans have against democracy has nothing to do with the quality of the voters or the rulers but rather with there being rulers at all. What we desire, instead, is to have autonomous communist households built on love.

@SlaveryPrison Therefore, prison slavery will only end when prisoner labor is PROHIBITED.  Let employers, including the prisons themselves, find workers on the outside or wait for prisoners to serve their term.
@SlaveryPrison The reason is that the employer of the prisoner can argue that the jobs in prison do not need decades of experience, just four to five years. Thus the "prevailing wage" on jobs needed in prison could be a fraction of what the individual could earn outside the prison walls.
@SlaveryPrison I take issue with point #2. ANY wage for prisoner labor is a slave wage, is slavery. All of the power is on the employer side. The "prevailing wage" for a software developer with 44 years of experience (moi) could easily be the same as for someone with a tenth of my experience.

@matt_knee @jodiecongirl Perhaps, but as a moral-social pariah who identifies with the human race, who places his masculinity in the context of an ethereal, romantic gender, rather than in a sexual gender, who is an aspirational communist for whom a communist household is the political unit, I am skewed.

@cspanwj @KeepitMadeinUSA @ScottPaulAAM Adam Smith's model is one of declining profits for each product, as new firms enter the market for a product by which a profit can be gained. Then firms seek and retool for other profitable product lines. Ideally, this "capitalism" resembles the Whack-A-Mole arcade game.
Civics	The political organization of the Republican Party in a town is itself as a republic of households.	The Communist Party has no political organization because communism is a form of household organization, the communist household. Traditionally, such a household is a tribe.

@RealBasedMAGA Actually, no. The stupid one here is Mark Dice. I debunked his tweet.
@MarkDice Just one additional note: introducing someone as ‚Äúthe dumbest person‚Äù only shows that you are incapable of proving that they are dumb. Given that I have easily debunked your claim in this case, you would be wise to leave the preemptive name-calling out, lest it be used on you.
@MarkDice As for her contention that a shift to renewables would promote racist (stet) justice, that might well be the case. Racism is democratic categorization, so that democratic privilege (racist injustice) is lessened when energy sources shift from cornered markets to open markets.
@MarkDice She said it would promote racial justice, not that it would end racism. In fact, racial justice presumes racism. If there is no racism, then nobody is categorized by ‚Äúrace‚Äù, no metric by ‚Äúrace‚Äù can be established, and no aggregated discrepancies or equality by ‚Äúrace‚Äù determined.
@Ocasio2018 However, my alternative would achieve an immediate positive improvement without the uncertainty and turmoil of a Proletarian Dictatorship.		Note: I first read and critiqued an economics text at age ten. However, my academic degrees are in Mathematics.
@Ocasio2018 The monopolies are then free to automate more of the jobs out of existence. This is counterproductive for the jobs affected by the minimum wage increase.		The only way this can be seen as an advance is in the Marxian sense of building the proletariat. That is cold comfort. [11]
@Ocasio2018 If the price-taking company cannot take these defensive measures, the price-setting firms can keep prices low to drive their price-taking competition out of business, then increase them after they have further monopolized their industries. [10]
@Ocasio2018 This can be achieved through various devices, among them being layoffs with increased workloads for the remaining employees, professional conversion such as sales clerks to sales associates, and automation with work by the customer, such as with ATMs and self-checkout. [9]
@Ocasio2018 Yet let us suppose that a minimum hourly wage increase gets ahead of current wage levels. How will employers react? Since it is an hourly rate, the first instinct is to cut the hours and increase productivity to the point where the total labor costs remain unchanged. [8]
@Ocasio2018 Businesses also like to be ahead of the game, being seen as the benefactors of their work force, and are willing to support a minimum hourly wage they are already paying their workers, but not above it.		Politically, better wages make minimum wage hikes possible. [7]
@Ocasio2018 The incidence of a minimum hourly wage is small, due to political support being limited to setting the minimum to a level well below the hourly wage for skilled work. People do not like their skilled labor to be compensated at the same rate as unskilled work. [6]
@Ocasio2018 Conversely, coal miners and roofers would be paid millions of dollars until their jobs are automated.		A minimum hourly wage would be as much of hindrance with an unconditional provision as it is self-defeating without it. [5]
@Ocasio2018 That free market in labor will then properly assign the price for different kinds of labor entered into it, even factoring in fun and leadership roles as compensation. CEOs working for a dollar a year and software developers (my day trade) for pizza, would be the norm. [4]
@Ocasio2018 The reason for that efficiency is that an unconditional provision frees the suppliers of labor from the duress of having to work for a living. In other words, an unconditional provision establishes a free market in labor.[3]
@Ocasio2018 There is no reason for the provision of the necessities to be conditioned on work. As I prove in ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù, the provision is the cost of sovereignty for a ‚Äúpower system‚Äù, i.e. a political economy, with an unconditional provision being its most efficient form. [2]
@Ocasio2018 Actually, businesses which are price-takers pay what the market dictates for other factors, whether those prices are high or low. The minimum hourly wage is a contrived unit price for labor, not a market price. Whether anybody whines about it or not, it is price setting. [1]
That would be federalism, Republicanism at the global level, to limit the purview of world government to the interstitial public matter, literally the ‚Äúres publica‚Äù.

@royfe However, it is clear that neither in China nor in Russia was there a concentration of production, nor was the State about to wither away. What both were left with were agrarian democracies highly susceptible to famine, and lacking the communist household organization of a gens.
@royfe A Marxian revolution today would be one where computer programmers would ally with the unemployed masses (proletariat) in commandeering industry to benefit the proletariat, skipping the middleman who owned the factories. I differ from Marx in the identification of that middleman.
@royfe The problem for those following the Marxian model was that countries like Russia and China were not industrialized when their revolutions took place, disqualifying them from being "Communist". Marx supposed a circumstance closer to the present day, where production is automated.
@royfe As the name suggests, China's "Great Leap Forward" was a disastrous democratic program similar to Stalin's brutal modernization effort a quarter-century prior. Urban Chinese were forced into contrived "communes", which most closely resembled antebellum Democratic plantations.

@Str8DonLemon @SharNeal Lincoln had to choose an Union Democrat, Andrew Johnson, as his Vice-Presidential running mate in the 1864 election. Thus the Democratic Party, in the North as well as the South, realized that if they lost the war militarily, they could still win it by assassination.
@Str8DonLemon @SharNeal We need to realize that supporters of Democracy in the Northern States created a two-front war for Lincoln. That is why there were draft riots in this city and why a Republican President had to rely on ‚ÄúUnion Democrats‚Äù to keep the northern front at bay. Tragically,

You and your neighbors could check your votes and the count for accuracy, to make sure your vote was not recorded and counted differently.
@AnthonyDelRey3 @FiveRights @alphafluffy01 The problem I have with voter ID is that it does not prevent ballot-tampering. Key to my proposal is that the balloting would be transparent. An officer of the court, or deputized postal worker, would come to your residence, present you with the ballot, witness and return it.
@AnthonyDelRey3 @FiveRights @alphafluffy01 Having homeless shelters as polling places would give greater access to the homeless. Many current polling places in public schools are in motorist sprawl, inaccessible to pedestrians and thus to homeless citizens.

@LindseyGrahamSC While we are repelling the invasion, we need to #ProhibitPrisonerLabor. Doing so will increase wages for the types of jobs in which prisoners are currently employed, as well as for other jobs in the economy. It will reduce crimes of necessity and hurt the criminal economy. #5

@jodiecongirl Just almost the best, close but no cigar, runner up...
@jodiecongirl Like peninsula, the pen- prefix in penultimate comes from the Latin paene, meaning ‚Äúalmost‚Äù. Thus, penultimate means ‚Äúalmost the best‚Äù, just as peninsula means ‚Äúalmost an island‚Äù.		A different meaning of ultimate, ‚Äúthe last‚Äù, gives penult its meaning of ‚Äúnext to last syllable‚Äù.

@stacyjanj @AstronomerAmber I have no doubt that he was condescending and had no business inquiring. What I am saying is that his behavior is rooted in the morality-society-democracy complex, not in his being a man.

@AstronomerAmber Thus, women of science are not considered people (demos) by society or democracy. Society ostracizes them and the business democracies disregard them. They are betwixt and between, with no interest in gossip and no investment in their studies. At least, that was my Mom‚Äôs life.
@AstronomerAmber Without getting into my case, I find that a morality which says that girls are evil if they are more interested in science than in personal matters, is enforced by society as a whole rather than by boys or men, and that democratic categorization extends this to political economy.
@AstronomerAmber Perhaps it is because I have been vilified, ostracized, and attacked by the forces of morality, society, and democracy from an early age, but I see the problem not as one of gender, but of those forces. Both of my parents were polymaths, as I am, so my reaction would be interest.

@JohnStossel @carolmswain Marxist socialism suffers from the same fate. For however fervent the hope for an eventual Republicanism, the accommodation with Democracy will always cause Socialism to fail. In other words, the failures of Socialism are all failures of Democracy. #EradicateDenocracy
@JohnStossel @carolmswain thereby hoping to bring about an end to poverty, albeit without Republicanism, the industrialist Robert Owen devised ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù and implemented some prototypes of his industrial societies. His socialism devolved into company towns following the model of democratic plantations.
@JohnStossel @carolmswain The difficulty in implementing this Republican reform has been the hegemony of democratic mercantilism and democratic elements in our governments. These form a resistance against any policy which would eliminate their rule.		To counter this resistance, while retaining democracy,
@JohnStossel @carolmswain Thus Democracy threatens to divide the communist household and thus to destroy Republicanism. The defense of Republicanism therefore requires a provision of the necessities to all in a republic without conditions or requirements. Such has been proposed but never implemented.
@JohnStossel @carolmswain There is a threat to Communism, to the communist household, and it is due to the some of the households becoming poor and their members thereby becoming beholden to outside interests, namely to democrats offering privilege only to those in their ‚Äúpeople‚Äù categories.
@JohnStossel @carolmswain Communist households therefore are autonomous private matters which can come together to govern a public matter, literally a republic, without having to seek their own interest. Instead, republican governance offers stewardship and it can only do so because of communism.
@JohnStossel @carolmswain Communism is an ideology of household organization. There cannot be a communist state; that term is an oxymoron.		Republicanism is based on Communism. Why? Because the communist household is large enough to be self-sustaining while retaining the affinity which obviates rule.

@howard74 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Returning to the economic consequences of prison slavery, it should be noted that the primary beneficiaries of that slave labor are the private prison companies and the mercantilist companies to whom they farm out that labor. Those companies are major political contributors.
@howard74 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Allowing prisoners to further their education through book-learning is a way for them to use their time without slavery. Penitential reflection is another way, indeed was the reform of Mrs. Fry which gave us the term ‚Äúpenitentiary‚Äù.
@howard74 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The lower cost of labor from this replacement then drives down wages throughout the labor market. The depression in wages caused by prisoner labor makes law-abiding less profitable and crime relatively more profitable. The prisoner whose time is up is thus incentivized to crime.
@howard74 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump The problem is that any work a prisoner does cannot be of their own volition and therefore is slavery. Then, like all slave labor, theirs replaces other labor at lesser expense. In other words, their labor takes jobs away from non-prisoners, away from ‚Äúlaw-abiding citizens‚Äù.

@SantanaAndres3 @nembotavy_0101 @ONUMujeres @CES_GSRN @ECPR_Gender @EJPGjournal One could argue that there is a loss of stewardship and of household efficiencies from the effective dissolution of the household.

@SantanaAndres3 @nembotavy_0101 @ONUMujeres @CES_GSRN @ECPR_Gender @EJPGjournal In the corruption of the American political economy by encroaching democracy, the role of the housewife in the enfeebled ‚Äúnuclear family‚Äù household was the last operational role. To have someone in that role run for office would debilitate that admittedly democratic household.
@SantanaAndres3 @nembotavy_0101 @ONUMujeres @CES_GSRN @ECPR_Gender @EJPGjournal self-interest prevails, under the cover of democratic categories, thereby losing the communist efficiencies of ‚Äúin-house‚Äù production, distribution, and consumption. This self-interest also loses the benefits of stewardship, which is the self-love of a republic by the households.
@SantanaAndres3 @nembotavy_0101 @ONUMujeres @CES_GSRN @ECPR_Gender @EJPGjournal The public cost is rather with individuals running rather than members of communist households being delegated. With delegates, the autonomy of households is preserved and a sense of stewardship prevails in governing the public matter. With individuals running, with politicians,

@cspanwj The Constitution sets forth, as its ONLY election, the deliberately republican election of the President and runner-up Vice-President by the STATES. The Democratic propaganda pushing for an end to the Electoral College is an attempt to overthrow our system of government.
@cspanwj Yet there it is, in Article IV, Section 4, and in the only suffrage mentioned being the equal suffrage of the States, as states, and in the only purpose of counting population being representation and apportionment of the States. Democratic elections are NOT mentioned.

@wpbf_terri @WPBF25News By in-home, I mean officers of the court for each county going door-to-door to present to and collect from each eligible voter, ballots for the mid-terms in their place of residence. The ballots would then be brought to the county court for counting.

The communist household unites, not just to a slightly extended family of a few aunts and uncles, but to a college of many, fully extended families of four generations. In #PopularCapitalism, I propose a pattern of 14 ppl for the inner generations and 14ppl total for the outer.
Likewise, a couple in a nuclear family might well present an united front, which is lost when they break apart into subatomic families. This is as the Democratic Party wants it, because it is to their advantage.
The Democratic Household is a fractured one. The more fractured, the better, because the appeal of separate votes is greater with domestic separation. While an extended family domiciled together might be of one accord among themselves, they will lose that unanimity if separated.

@hughhewitt @donlemon @HillaryClinton An objective observer can only conclude that people who are fanatical adherents to democracy, and thus of their particular democratic categorization, are the only perpetrators of ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù acts. In the slily abbreviated parlance of today, only extremists are terrorists.
@hughhewitt @donlemon @HillaryClinton The democratic categorization is at fault here. Though it affords and has afforded an opportunity for democrats and democratic sympathizers to shift the blame for violence away from themselves, the plethora of democratic categorizations has now made such blame-shifting ludicrous.

@jodiecongirl Alternatively, an unconditional provision of the necessities can be made to all, thus enabling a truly free press of people writing and reading about their own neighborhoods. Otherwise, people do not spend enough waking hours for this in their effectively bedroom developments.
@hyperplanes @jodiecongirl The problem which the rhetoric exposes is that the teaching of students and their grading are conjoined. The solution to this problem is to separate them, to keep teaching in one institution but to move certification of knowledge into a new and separate institution.
@hyperplanes @jodiecongirl Further, the rhetoric against standardized tests is institutionally motivated. That there might be an alternative to in-class grading by instructors is a threat to the certification authority and power of a school. That power, however, is rife with conflicts of interest.
@hyperplanes @jodiecongirl With standardized tests for grades (forms) or aptitude, that would be the problem. With course exams, however, the syllabus provides the baseline. This problem is thus with any generalized test or grading system, standardized or not.

@jaseattack @jodiecongirl Companies are not physical persons. Starvation does not present the same peril for them as it does to people. The legal term for the predicament of people having their survival income conditioned on employment is ‚Äúduress‚Äù.
@jodiecongirl It also suggests what really happens when people leave the work force, which is otherwise treated as some mythical place of economic purgatory.
@jodiecongirl In ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù, I prove that the provision of the necessities to its citizens is a requirement of any political economy and that an unconditional provision is its most efficient form, the only way to truly-free markets. Just saying.
@realDonaldTrump Illegal immigration is a myth.
@jodiecongirl There is a difference between work and drudgery. Most current employment is drudgery under duress. What people would do of their own volition, whilst getting their #1500DollarWeeklyAllowance as their provision of the necessities, would be their most meaningful and rewarding work.

@mchooyah @MikeJBarnes Actually, it is democratic mercantilism which insists that people negotiate their wages under duress by having them work for their mere survival. It is all part of the total control Democrats want to have over the populace, to benefit their merchant and usurer friends.
@ChuckCallesto @howard74 The root cause of the division is Democracy, which places people in democratic categories, so as to set them against each other.	#EradicateDemocracy
@leah_boustan The bottom line is whether the material is covered, in which case a course exam suffices. Why create an artificial need for a class when proficiency in the material can by tested independently from classes?
@leah_boustan Are we talking about the history of political economic thought, or political economic systems? In either case, is it not handled in passing?
As a scion of the Sherman family and an authentic Republican, my view is that naturalization applies both to those born into communist households or town civic republics here and to the immigrant. In other words, the Fourteenth Amendment failed to apply a Republican framework.
@cegriff3 @GTempton @hughhewitt @POTUS Then go through the amendment process to repeal it. That is the ONLY way the Constitution affords for changing itself. NOT by Act of Congress. NOT by Executive Order. NOT by Supreme Court Opinion.

@EllisonCampaign @BurtonBrown Health insurance is the ONLY reason medical fees and prescription prices are inflated at a multiple of what the market can bear. Medicare is health insurance.

@PassTheSalty @BurtonBrown @AndrewGillum The answers to these questions are all the same: Nothing. It is not just Mr. Gillum, but all Democrats. The reason is that democracy requires slavery, despite what is taught at an early age in the public schools, despite what is repeated in the broadcast media.#BoycottDemocrats
@PassTheSalty @BurtonBrown @AndrewGillum Here are the questions:		What has Mr. Gillum said about abolishing slavery? What has he said about millions of prisoners working at below minimum wage? What has he said about the depressing effect that has on wages? What has he said about the increase in mercantilist profits?
@PassTheSalty @BurtonBrown @AndrewGillum Mr. Trump set himself up as the ultimate political straw man.		Any fool can contradict him. Any fool can puff themselves up with pride by denouncing him. Thus, any fool thinks himself an expert on policy by resisting him, rather than presenting a coherent argument themselves.
@ItsNorbitPeters @jerzegurl @WayneDupreeShow @DiamondandSilk @RealCandaceO @cvpayne @TombStoneBub @ABC There is neither black nor white. Those are bogus, democratic categories, meant to divide us and set us against each other. Divide and conquer is the ancient political strategy of democracy.
@AndrewGillum @BurtonBrown @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes, ignore @realDonaldTrump and ask yourselves: What has any Democrat done to abolish slavery?		Zip. Nada. Nothing.		Then ask yourselves: What effect does millions of prisoners working at below minimum wage have on your own wage?		Reduces it.		#BoycottDemocrats
@marcorubio It is democracy, itself, which will be stopped, as that racist system of slavery, privilege, and rule is unsustainable. However, it can be stopped peaceably. See ‚ÄúPopular Capitalism‚Äù for the theory and the prescription.
The behavior of people is no concern of the republic. Instead, each communist household tends to the welfare and proclivities of its members, building each other up in Love.	(more)
From the Latin for ‚Äúpublic matter‚Äù, a republic is a union of communist households responsible for governing the public concerns which are beyond the purview of any of its communist households.	(more)
This assurance of place means that the communist household, not any member of it, can and should be the responsible party in deciding issues for the republic of which it is a part.		What is a republic?		(more)
Therefore, the land and buildings of a communist household are retained by the communist household in perpetuity, providing an assurance of place for its members. When someone leaves one communist household and cleaves to another their assurance changes, but is not lost. (more)
Communist households are households where the lands and buildings are held in common. As such, they cannot be alienated.		What is meant by alienated?		An item is alienated when its possession (holding) is transferred from within one household or state to outside of it.		(more)
Hatred is from morality, society, and democracy.		Its antidote is love, communism, and republicanism. https://t.co/ptiW8CBZ6j
This election is a referendum on democracy, as every election is until we #EradicateDemocracy.		What is the alternative, you ask?		Communist Republicanism.		What is that?		Republics built upon communist households.		What are communist households?		(more)
There is someone of a certain color; they are human.	There is someone of a certain faith; they are human.	There is someone of a certain gender; they are human.	There is someone of a certain stature; they are human.	There is someone of a certain language; they are human.

@juliaioffe 1. My grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity, so my religious heritage is mixed.	2. Many people are also mixed along these lines.	3. Your use of the word ‚ÄúGentile‚Äù is a vile democratic attempt to place those of us who are mixed into distinct categories.	(more)

@hughhewitt Sorry, Hugh, but a democracy untempered by a republican tradition produces these sorts of moralistic outburst. I could point out that morality, the knowledge of good and evil with the aim of applying it to people, is the original sin of all ages, but that will be dismissed.

@hughhewitt I am escaping from that world as I move stuff from New Jersey into New York City. My friends from motorist sprawl blather on about the Trumpbashians and the #EtTu movement, as if those amount to anything more than a hill of robusta coffee beans.
@hughhewitt It is in that experience that they learn their daily news. I am the oddball who seeks out the local newspaper and writes letters to it. Most people do not bother reading it. Indeed, the denizens of motorist sprawl do not bother reading anything on paper. History is being lost.
@hughhewitt After a generation or two, though, those neighborhoods became completely alienating. Nobody knows where anybody came from, and have no idea where anybody is going to. On the other hand, they know intimate details of the characters in their television or NetFlix shows.
@hughhewitt The saving grace in those years was that the adults who moved into the then-new motorist developments had lived previous lives in pedestrian neighborhoods, from which they brought a sense of community. Those showed me which was my grandparents‚Äô home after I rode my tricycle.
@hughhewitt I have seen this since the 1960‚Äôs, both in the ‚ÄúNew Mohansic Development‚Äù in Yorktown, where I grew up, and in the more thoroughly dystopian world of Hicksville, where my maternal grandparents lived in my early childhood.
@hughhewitt In many of these ‚Äúdevelopments‚Äù designed for the motorist lifestyle, there are not even sidewalks. The only people who ‚Äúcome over‚Äù are the motorists invited by the residents of the motorist dwelling, because the design treats neighbors like a security risk.
@hughhewitt The problem is that we have been divided from each other for so long that the division has become psychotic. The conversation you have had with Mr. Ellis is not available for people in motorist sprawl. Instead, of walking next door, people get into cars or watch electronics.

@jodiecongirl Pocket doors.
@jodiecongirl Also a reminder that you should never judge anyone. Instead, you should form expectations of your desired outcome and manage the risk of undesired outcomes. Thus it makes sense to bet against your team.
@cspanwj @NewsGuardRating @StevenBrill The labeling of reports as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù has, and is intended to have, a chilling effect on investigative journalism.		Who intends it? The broadcast media cartels.		How do we fix the problem? By breaking them up as combinations in restraint of the press.
What some economists see as a fallacy in #SunkCosts, I see as a misunderstanding of that concept. The costs are sunk because they cannot be reversed, not because the hope of a return from their outlay should be relinquished nor that more should not be spent on failed dreams.
@jodiecongirl There most certainly are in the game itself: the cost of getting runners on base in an inning is sunk when they are left on base at the end of the inning.
@mslis_belle @WajahatAli @Dodgers Some of us in New York City would like @TrolleyDodgers to come back home to Brooklyn.

@JackPosobiec @howard74 5. The choice is clear: 		A. nationalism and its democracy, where rancor and division beset a people fighting over who is American and who is not, or		B. communism and its republics, where the people grow up in loving large households, sending delegates to manage the civic weal.
@JackPosobiec @howard74 4. As such, nationalism perverts the cause of these United States of America. For we are a union of States, in each of which we seek a Republican form of government, which is to say the government of a union of tribes, of communist households, where each builds each other up.
@JackPosobiec @howard74 3. All such categorizations are democratic. They dehumanize people into the stereotype of the their assigned category, the better to bribe them with democratic privilege if the category is a ruling one, or the better to oppress them with democratic slavery if it is not.		(more)
@JackPosobiec @howard74 I disagree.		1. It is limiting to jam the eternity of one‚Äôs person into any category.		2. The category of nation is a false one, presuming one and only one mutual ancestor for every native of the supposed nation, with another for the next nation over.		(more)

@RealJamesWoods @howard74 The Democratic Party sought to violently overthrow the government of the United States in their Caesar‚Äôs Civil War.
Any incumbent who avoids implementing that policy HAS SHOWN THAT THEY SUPPORT SLAVERY AND MUST BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE.
Therefore, every incumbent can abolish slavery completely, for all prisons in their purview, with one simply policy:		1. Prohibit all labor by prisoners during the time of their imprisonment. https://t.co/VnqQ9UYr4N

@polishprincessh @howard74 The Constitutional term for her behavior is ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù.

@scholt7 @howard74 The greater threat is from the border-destroying highway system. They encourage daily invasions by private automobiles into pedestrian communities and neighborhoods. They destroyed the civic republics across this country and installed a motorist democracy with mercantilist malls.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes The Democrats engaged in a much more brutal seizure of Communist land in this country, but they did it under their own name.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes If there were any Communists in that experience, it would have been an existing tribe which was the hapless beneficiary of the Democrats‚Äô (people-rulers‚Äô) coercive seizure of your family‚Äôs land. More likely, no such tribe existed and the new residents were democratic cronies.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes I do not consider you irretrievably ignorant, but you have to be willing to concede that you and your family have been believing a lie about your family‚Äôs persecutors, a lie that was clearly in those persecutors‚Äô self-interest to tell about themselves.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes As I said at the outset, you know nothing about communism. You only know that the rulers of your old country told your family that they were Communists. I have patiently tried to explain to you that your family was told a blatant lie, that those rulers were de facto democrats.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes Ad hominem attacks do not constitute an argument.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes To reiterate, the brainwashing is in taking the Democratic propaganda about what Communism is as fact rather than fiction.
@hughhewitt 3. Create a new legal framework for civic republics which makes municipalities unions of communist households. Currently, the corporate model is applied to towns, whereas it is more suitable for communist households.
@hughhewitt 2. End the commercialization of prisons. Prisons have been used to suppress civic leaders. Ending prison commercialization would reduce the capacity to suppress these dissidents. It would also end slavery as it would require an end to all labor by prisoners.
@hughhewitt A suggestion from an old Communist Republican:		1. Allow communist households to be formed with the inalienable holding of land and buildings and with status as single civic units. This would end the greatest threat to civic participation: real estate as property.
@hughhewitt @RosenJeffrey My thoughts, too.		Cousin John‚Äôs Anti-Trust Act has been sorely underused in the industries which have overtaken civic functions: utilities, transportation, communications, and banking. Regulation of these monopolized, commercialized industries has never worked.
@troyjensen Ah, yes! The lessons of Executive Jet as yet unlearned.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes So, yes, I understand what it is like for my family and myself to be in mortal danger. I just dispute your characterization of your attackers. Communism is, despite the Democratic propaganda, a household organization, not a political one, and thus innocent of political oppression
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes My mistreatment was more palpable. I was hunted down by same-age societies after every day of the first several grades of elementary school. I view society and morality as parts of democracy, so I consider those vicious attacks to be also a form of democratic oppression.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes Joe McCarthy, a Democrat who ran as a Republican to destroy Republicanism, would have had us and many other families like ours in his sights had he gone on much longer. There was a great possibility of us losing everything in a Democratic ‚Äúpurge‚Äù of Communist Republicans.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes Although you chose to take an accusatory tone with me, I assure you that I commiserate with the plight of you and your family. My Dad was a Populist who met Huey Long on a Boy Scout trip to DC. My Mom was a Salvationist and Swedish Socialist. We were pariahs, to begin with.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes Only a democratic sympathizer would  insist that others be personally humbled. That belies your claim to being libertarian, because it is an attempt to control others.		In point of fact, I never needed to be humbled because I was never prideful. Instead, I have a mission.
Such is the consummate evil of Democracy that it shifts the blame for its murders onto innocent parties, institutions, and individuals. If you hear stories about Communists killing families, you can be sure Democrats killed the families because they were about to join a commune.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes The Virginia colonies, also known as ‚ÄúSouthern colonies‚Äù, were the approved form of colonization by the British Democracy, thus becoming democracies after the British model. Instead of having autonomous communist households or quasi-communist town-republics, the South had manors.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes the British Democracy also attacked the Virginia Democracies. This precipitated the American War of Independence. The British Democracy continued its attacks on this country until deciding to focus on India, instead. The Virginian democracies became the new threat.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes No sooner had the made this attempt at autonomy than Parliament (British Democrats) sent governors to take it from them.

@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes I have listened and read much of the Democratic propaganda, both against Republicans and against Communism, and it is ALL blame-shifting. It should not be necessary to bring up my own family‚Äôs history, but you have been too thoroughly brainwashed by the Democrats.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes The Democrats (people-rulers) in your country told their people they were Communists to shift the blame for their persecution of your family and others. This is a common ploy by Democrats. I have nothing to learn from your story, but you have much yet to learn from me.
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes There most certainly autonomy in Communism, the autonomy of a self-sufficient communal household. It is the only true autonomy.		You clearly know nothing about Communism, but are defensive about the crock of bull you have been fed by Democrats. Try thinking for once.
@ilkasblog1 Republicanism is based on Communism:	https://t.co/LRPUIudSQh
@quantum_liberty @CB618444 @MikeJBarnes A republic is literally the public matter. The private matters are autonomous households. The autonomy of a household depends on it holding its land in common (communism) lest members of the household alienate it to outside interests.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl It is therefore inconsequential whether socialists are employed or not. In fact, most do out of necessity. As a Republican, I am a far greater threat to the Democracy in America, yet I have worked much harder than most, in day jobs when I was too overqualified for IT positions.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl The logical inconsistencies of Democracy in America are being realized in the military disasters of Democratic Mercantilist Imperialism, the inability to compete with democracies which are military allies, and the highly contrived ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù used to maintain prison labor forces.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl Democracy‚Äôs global political economic system is Mercantilism, a convergence of commercialized merchants and private banks. Democratic Mercantilism was the ‚Äúsafety valve‚Äù of Democracy for centuries, giving jobs to its Privileged and exporting some Democratic Slavery overseas.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl The great flaw of Democracy is its reliance on its Democratic slaves to provide cheap labor to the Democratically privileged so that they vote for Democratic rulers in the Democratic elections. Subterfuges like the ‚Äúnearly people‚Äù Democratic categories cannot escape that flaw.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl The key institution of Democracy, the categorization of humans into ‚Äúpeople‚Äù and ‚Äúnot people‚Äù, is what drives its other institutions of Democratic Slavery, Democratic Privilege, and Democratic Rule through Democratic elections.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl What are the Democratic institutions? We know of the institution which Democratic propagandists once heralded as peculiar to it, namely its brand of slavery, and also of their attempts to shift the blame to other political systems which had servants. Both are disingenuous.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl In political economies which have been corrupted by Democracy and its attendant Commercialism, Socialism constitutes an attempt to have Republican reforms while retaining Democracy, its Institutions, and the Commercialism which feeds off of those institutions.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl Republican reforms have been attempts to remove the occasions for jealousy and possessiveness, thus to prevent Democracy and its pernicious institutions from being established.
@Lrihendry @jerzegurl Actually, it is Democracy which does not work. Communist Republicanism has worked for millennia. Democracy has arisen like the serpent through jealousy and possessiveness, yet its institutions are fundamentally flawed.
If you have read any of my works on political economy, you will know that I consider depression and debt the evils, not inflation nor deficits. and that I find the shibboleth of growth ludicrous. Indeed, in #TheWayOut, I prove that hyperinflation is caused by extreme debt alone.
@RetiredTeacherD Further, an unconditional provision of the necessities would stimulate the economy and increase later revenues. The geometric series of these expenditures and revenue produces an asymptotic TOTAL net deficit WITHOUT depressive effects upon the non-beneficiaries.
@RetiredTeacherD Of course, that is not the whole story. The social security tax which keeps the program from being a net deficit is depressive.	Nothing in the federal deficit need add to the federal debt. In fact, if federal expenditures are made with new money, they will not add to the debt.
@marklutchman @jerzegurl Democratic sympathizers hide behind benign words like ‚Äúliberal‚Äù. They love when you repeat their Democratic categorizations because it allows them to shift the blame from Democracy to the people the Democrats categorize as ‚Äúwhite‚Äù. Your conclusion, however, is spot on.

@ddwiese @jerzegurl Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army, initiating Caesar‚Äôs Civil War and allowing him to carry out his death threat against Republicans. This is the same strategy being employed by the Machine Wing of the Democratic Party in the United States. The ‚Äúresistance‚Äù is Civil War.
@ddwiese @jerzegurl Moreover, the ‚ÄúCommentary on the Gallic War‚Äù was a propagandistic book upon which the Great Democrat, Julius Caesar, built his myth as Military Governor of Gaul, the province immediately to the north of the Republic of Rome. The river forming the border was the Rubicon.
@ddwiese @jerzegurl That modern historians dispute that account, finding no independent proof that the priests of the Gauls, the Druids, ever engaged in the practice of burning people alive in a large basket in the shape of a man, lends credence to the view that it was always a death threat.
@ddwiese @jerzegurl The Machine Democracy thought Hillary could issue death threats against classically educated Republicans and get away with it. The ‚ÄúWicker Man‚Äù in Julius Caesar‚Äôs account of his campaigns in Gaul was a basket of deplorable people WHICH HAD TO BE FILLED IN WITH INNOCENTS.

@OfficeOfMike @MikeJBarnes The who?
@MarkRPellegrino @refinedmess @wilkes_kelley @charliekirk11 Our high medical prices are caused by health insurance, which is a highly leveraged Ponzi scheme, like the mortgage loan. Yes, that means that the high housing prices are caused by the mortgage loan. Eliminate both and prices in both markets will come down to what they can bear.
@charliekirk11 Technically, democratic voters are not democrats, though democrats will tell them that they are vicarious democrats. To have one‚Äôs thoughts determined by some majority, by some ruler‚Äôs contrivance, is perhaps the saddest aspect of their lives.
@MikeJBarnes More to the point, it is a flag of the southern democracies. If this person would recognize this, he would see that democracy is altogether abhorrent, whether practiced from the right or the left, and that it brings dishonor to Mr. Trump.
@realDonaldTrump 4. How are stock dividends? Otherwise, stock prices are pure speculation.	5. What about the fact that increased profits usually come from lower labor costs? If aggregate earned income is not down, then thank QE and/or higher lender confidence and/or increased real good exports.
@realDonaldTrump 1. Corp2Corps up/down? Losses in contract work could compensate in shift to wage employment.	2. At what salaries/wages? Replacement of retiring workers might be attempted at lower wages.	3. Compensation adjusted for housing prices? This is a key number in evaluating labor market.

For a Democratic legislator to claim indigenous benefits on the basis of DNA is akin to the apocryphal story of the child murdering his parents and then asking mercy from the court on the grounds of being an orphan.
The relevant measure of indigenous descent is not DNA, but tribal genealogy. The Democratic Party committed tribal slaughter, most notably by Democratic President Andrew Jackson, making such genealogy nearly impossible outside of survivors on a reservation and near relatives.

@MrVeritas @MsAvaArmstrong When democracy dies, everyone is called human. When society dies, people join in communist households, communities. And when morality dies, Love abides.

@TheRevAl As a Sherman, a cousin of Roger Sherman, I also do not take much stock in the ‚ÄúFounding Fathers‚Äù cult. Cousin Roger was more like a ‚ÄúFounding Brother‚Äù, eschewing the powder wig and fancy dress. My view is that the ratifiers are the authority and, since they are not present, ...
@TheRevAl I would suggest that the Republican mode of interpretation is one with which you are likely familiar: exegesis. For we see the Constitution as having the nature of a holy scripture, one by which a Union of the States is ordained and established, with authority by ratification.
@TheRevAl Many of us voted for #NotTheHillary, third-party, or not at all ‚Äì due to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs repeated paraphrases of Julius Caesar‚Äôs death threats against Republicans ‚Äì in 2016, but many have more options in the midterms. Moreover, originalism is not a Republican concept.
@TheRevAl Hugh Hewitt is presenting a well-reasoned, civil, yet still a right-wing democratic (Conservative) response to the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing. We Republicans have different takes on the proceedings. Here is mine:	https://t.co/jkBsJfWial

@jodiecongirl When Grant was given command over the area which included Vicksburg, he chose Sherman to serve under him. Their victory in Vicksburg led to Grant being promoted and thus facing and defeating the unbeatable Lee. Meanwhile, Cousin Cump took a little stroll through Georgia.
@jodiecongirl The title misstates even the abbreviated clip. I can see from the clip where Mr. Trump is going with this because I am a Sherman and I know that my cousin Cump was from Ohio, originally. We Shermans suffer from melancholia. Grant the drunk served under the insane Sherman, first.
They remember the case of Emmet Till. The Democrats try to forget that. https://t.co/vzl334nPK1
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump At this point, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer need to be asked whether they will repeat the racial slurs which Mr. Lemon uttered against Mr. West. If they seek to evade that question, they will have been shown to be racist slavers.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump with the ‚Äúleaders‚Äù they have appointed, say Mr. Lemon and company, using their alleged leadership to give themselves a pass for uttering democratic slurs.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump facts. When their democracy is exposed by those facts for the fraud that it is, the democratic propaganda then turns to kicking the presenter out of the category. When that fails, as it has with Mr. West, the mask comes off of democratic racism, yet only partially,
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump in those categories. Thus, when someone who meets the other criteria for inclusion in a democratic category, say Mr. West, asserts facts contrary to those presented by the ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù appointed by the Machine Democracy, those puppets are then instructed to deride those
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump and of their continued oppression of the people. The current categorizations favored by the Machine Wing of the Democratic Party include those which make the manufactured facts stated by their anointed ‚Äúleaders‚Äù of their ethnic categories a necessary precondition for membership
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump We have been subjected to ideological slanders by Democratic Mercantilists through their monopolization of the broadcast media and of the so-called public schools. Their fake ‚Äúdefinitions‚Äù serve to absolve the Democratic Party of their outright treason in the Civil War and
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump That blend is inconsistent with Democratic Mercantilism, as is seen in the Republican opposition to commercialism and to machine politics, as well as in the Democratic Party‚Äôs repeated attempts to impose its categorical (racist) slavery onto States with a Republican governance.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump Communism, the leaven of Communism and the experience with Republicanism created a unique blend of the two: American Republicanism, Americanism for short. This blend created a partial commonwealth, a communism of caring for neighbors in need, with civic Republican institutions.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump the Puritans were marked people. After years in Democratic prisons, the Puritans were given a chance to escape to the Americas, with a heavy price tag: indentured servitude under democratic mercantilist overlords. Though that price tag and later colonists destroyed their initial
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump The Puritans, guided by this purely Christian communism, were persecuted by the Royal Democracy in England. For a brief period, after the English Republican Revolution, they found protection from Oliver Cromwell as he sought to establish a republic. When that attempt failed,
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump There, in one verse, is a repudiation of the Democratic Mercantilist shibboleth of ‚Äúprivate property‚Äù and an assertion of the Communist principle of holding all things, especially and crucially land, in common.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump The household management, the economy, of the early and pure Church was described in Acts 4:32: ‚ÄúNow the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.‚Äù
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump Yet the ‚ÄúRoman Catholic Church‚Äù insists on calling its chief democrat ‚ÄúPope‚Äù. Read again the words of the Mandamus and see how directly contrary to the Christ Jesus are the politics of the Vatican. The cathedral-based democracy supplanted the Christian communist households.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump That pure Christian lifestyle is described in the Acts of the Apostles and conforms to the teachings of the Christ Jesus. The so-called ‚ÄúRoman Catholic Church‚Äù does not. Jesus said ‚ÄúCall no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.‚Äù [Matthew 23:9]
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump Mercantilism was and is the premier economic system of the European royal democracies. It was the prevailing economic system in the European democratic colonies, except for one group in the Americas: the Puritans. The purity of Puritans was chiefly that of the early church.
@MikeJBarnes @realDonaldTrump There is only one human race. 		The notion of distinct races is a myth created by European Democrats to serve as a means for democratic categorization. That categorization established the European Democratic Morality, of white being good and black being evil, for mercantilism.
@AHMalcolm Any damn fool can become President, and frequently does.
Democrats use liberalism as a cloak for democracy, which is their racist system of slavery, privilege, and rule. Conservatives do truth a disservice when they smear liberals out of deference to democracy and their right-wing Democratic allies in the RNC. #EradicateDemocracy

@TuckerCarlson @howard74 It is society which enforces that morality, which keeps people from visiting the outcast cast in prison. It is democracy which legislates the morality which dehumanizes people in the eyes of society, which builds the prisons, and which enslaves the prisoners through an exception.
@TuckerCarlson @howard74 The oppressive system seeking to overthrow the United States of America is based on morality, society, and democracy. It is morality, through its alchemy of converting sins into sinners, of converting crimes of which a person has been duly convicted into criminals, that enslaves.
@washingtonpost @BurtonBrown Democracy wins when people seek the chimera of success. The people fulfill their visions when nurtured by communist households.	#EradicateDemocracy

@contactfamilies A college of extended families would be able to provide that childcare, or allow you time with your children. But that would be communism, which the democrats and their minions viciously attack. #EradicateDemocracy
@gaye_gallops @howard74 The Democratic Party is racist slaver to the core. When the charade of their democratic categorization is exposed, they send their privileged tokens to make their racial slurs for them. Cowards! Let Schumer and Pelosi come out from behind the shadows.
@AntonioSabatoJr No qualifiers are needed. The Democratic Party is heinous enough on its own.
@PrisonPlanet @MikeJBarnes After all, you cannot eat a vote.
The democratic voter does not think; they meme.
@churchofengland @LMinghella I disagree.		1. The only way of ending this wholesale destruction of nature is to end the addiction to the private automobile.		2. The only way to end that addiction is to end the dependence on wages for survival.		My suggestion to John Anderson, 39 years ago, was to help w/ (2).

@BroBillRogers @CRTV @howard74 @MillerStream I would dispute that the people under democracy are ever free. Rather, the lie they are told is that they rule vicariously. The truth is that under any system of rule, the balance of the people are ruled and therefore not free.

@hughhewitt @Pontifex @JoshShapiroPA I dare say that Christ comes each day to the edifices of the Democratic Roman Catholic Imperial outposts, waiting to be invited to the communion table, and he is turned away by the functionaries of the ‚ÄúPope‚Äù.
@hughhewitt @Pontifex @JoshShapiroPA The democracy of bishops in the hegemony of Rome will forever be clueless about the consequences of its democratic power. The chief democrat, the ‚ÄúPope‚Äù, by virtue of his position, will be the most clueless about the need to allow each congregation its communion.
@hughhewitt @Pontifex Sorry, Hugh, but that is just another superficial move by the democratic administration of the ‚ÄúRoman Catholic‚Äù segment of the church.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Then there was the Caesar‚Äôs Civil War the Democratic Party waged against the United States of America, the bloodiest conflict of our country. 		The Democratic Party undertook that war to protect their democracy and the racist system of slavery which is peculiar to it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The Democratic Party sought to violently overthrow the federal government throughout its history in this country. Aaron Burr, its institutional founder, shot and killed a Founding Father, Alexander Hamilton. Burr‚Äôs political machine, Tammany Hall, was a nest of violence.
The Democratic demonization of Donald Trump does not jive with the facts, as Mike Love‚Äôs account shows.		The larger issue is whether we will let the temptation of the Garden, the moral superiority we feel over another human being, take over our minds and hearts and souls. https://t.co/DC1Oj0rWrd

@Fahrenthold The Democrat Ronald Reagan, running as a Republican as he did in California, commandeered  the Republican primary, forcing Rep. Anderson to run as an Independent with his Fifty-Cent gasoline tax formulation of my idea. The Democrats of both the Right and the Left RESISTED change.
@Fahrenthold In 1979, I offered a suggestion to John Anderson to end the oil crisis: place a resource tax on petroleum products to wean the American people off of oil. I then warned of the natural disasters which would result from failing to implement my suggestion.
@kristine_kenyon @Fahrenthold @Susan_Hennessey The Democratic Party depends on the motorist democracy, which fuels the American addiction to petroleum. So, whatever you do, NEVER vote for a Democrat. They will only feed your children to the automobile companies, the sprawl and mortgage companies, and the petroleum companies.

@AriFleischer There is a backstory to these sorts of cases. Anybody who really cared about Ms. Blasey would have investigated why she was a drunken slut. It may well be that she was raped by her father and that her mother was too afraid to confront him or to protect her daughter.
