@TimJenkins1962 @mighty_flynn @SABRPictorial It‚Äôs not. Turns out he switched to #22 in 1971 ST. I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs a Twins road uni and it‚Äôs Rick Renick
@SABRPictorial @mighty_flynn Like most of them in those days: in New York. Yankee Stadium. That‚Äôs the Bronx Courthouse on the left and the blue stripe is the back wall of the bleachers.
@HeavyJ28 The NL home run leader used to receive the Mel Ott Award. They let that slide some time in the ‚Äò60s, I think
@andyscheel58 @mighty_flynn @SABRPictorial What if it‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs road jersey AT Lakeland. A Tiger home shirt should show some signs of the neck piping (could be obscured by the angle).And the other guy who facially resembles this outfielder is Rick Renick, INF-OF of the 1968-72 Twins...who wore #10. https://t.co/JKrNkG2XWH
@andyscheel58 @mighty_flynn @SABRPictorial Yes. But I now don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Nagelson. This stuff was notoriously changeable in 1971 but the guides say Nagelson did get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù number: 21. And NO ONE wore 10 in the spring. One thing that struck me about this photo was: uni looks a little gray to be a Tigers home outfit

@andyscheel58 @mighty_flynn @SABRPictorial Not in 1971. Smith was fired after the 1970 season and Billy Martin was the manager. The Tigers didn‚Äôt get Tony Taylor from the Phillies until June -and they have him #10. Highly unusual to give a non-roster player a low number like 10. Highly usual to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù a vet‚Äôs # from 31
@mighty_flynn @SABRPictorial I‚Äôd have to dig up some research material to see if he wore #10 for them in his only Spring Training there (1971) but at first glance it sure looks like Russ ‚ÄúRusty‚Äù Nagelson from Ohio State https://t.co/Pzd5rXdE6Q

@MacroLit Bonds? Worked? His cheating was to get around actual work and the wear and tear on the body that steroids masked. That‚Äôs why outside of SF he is a pathetic joke.
@emmittfizhume But you‚Äôre ignoring all the advantages Ruth would have today: tiny ballparks, no foul territory, fresh baseballs, video, coaches, nutrition, night games, Coors Field, the DH. Allow any player from the past a month to adjust to these things and they‚Äôd improve on what they did then
@DanLoney36 Look, I think JR‚Äôs .297 in 1947 was more impressive than Williams hitting .406 because of the pressure. But Larry Doby only hit .300 twice and topped 26 homers three times. Nobody came in and blew the doors off all-white pitching.
@beilis_jay Agreed. Probably comes in around 725 for the career.
@mariolopezmal Dodger Stadium 2019:	LF 330	LCF 375	CF 395	RCF 375	RF 330	Foul territory: minimal 		Yankee Stadium 1927:	LF 301	LCF 400	Deep LCF 490	CF 480	Deep RCF 425	RCF 350	RF 295	Foul territory: immense 82 feet to backstop		Dodger Stadium would be a bandbox for Ruth. Now. Wanna try Coors?
@emmittfizhume So then by today‚Äôs ‚Äúsub hitting speed‚Äù theory, Ruth saw nothing but unhittable pitches and supplied all the power with the pitcher contributing none.
@Leadhsr Per game.
@tony_bicycle Spitballs were outlawed. And you may have noticed Gaylord Perry pitched until 1983. Whitey Ford scuffed baseballs until 1967. ‚ÄúIllegal‚Äù and ‚Äúdone anyway‚Äù co-existed then too
@TommyBoy_2024 But he‚Äôs proto-launch angle and would get a 100 on holding back then suddenly shifting his power through the zone. Also that stance let him adjust to any pitch including the defaced baseballs that did what cutters and similar do today.
@MichaelCreel Yeah that really sucks. Just the 80 ;-)
@jimmywal3 He had a superior throwing arm (probably something to do with his HOF-caliber pitching). He was certainly Bonds‚Äô equal defensively.
@patlyonsnyt Like they stopped pitching to Maris in 1961 with Mantle behind him? If we want to test this theory, Pat, it can‚Äôt be Ruth in a vacuum. He gets, say, Stanton or Gehrig begins him.
@PrideOfTheTide Never mind the foul pole! Imagine Ruth playing today with virtually no foul territory, and outfield fences 30-100 feet shorter except at the corners. And playing at anything but sea level.
@DanLoney36 But if the pre-integration pitching staffs were so bad, why didn‚Äôt the early African-American stars feast on the all-white pitching they faced? As I said: Ruth should‚Äôve faced integrated pitching. But the results might not have been significantly different.

More than 90 if he had access to video and training equipment, and realized how much damn money was on the table.

Sorry. Series 6 (it says it in the album page). 9 series of 24, 1 of 23, #106 printed with the 1934 cards.
Somewhere along the line the decision was made to double print a Ruth instead of publishing a #106. Might‚Äôve been inadvertent but the fact that the government made Goudey print a card and send it free to anybody who complained implies that was no clerical error ;-)

@WillHoenike @ThatBoy_GoodRS @NotMrTibbs @officialBBWAA And one Meta point. I believe in a tiered HOF: Immortals; General Population; and Special Cases: shortened careers, execs, scouts, commissioners, Marvin Miller, peak value, a place for Roger Maris and others. Maybe DHs go there.
@WillHoenike @ThatBoy_GoodRS @NotMrTibbs @officialBBWAA Last DH point. I would support one for the Hall if he achieved numbers or impact that eclipsed fulltime players. Martinez did not do that. Ortiz did not do that. Get a DH who hits .350 lifetime and I‚Äôll listen.
@WillHoenike @ThatBoy_GoodRS @NotMrTibbs @officialBBWAA And relievers do not and will not - as Martinez and other DH‚Äôs figuratively do - get a Get-Out-Of-The-Minors-Free-Pass and have somebody standing next to them doing their fielding for them.
@WillHoenike @ThatBoy_GoodRS @NotMrTibbs @officialBBWAA As the ‚Äúopener‚Äù premise is refined we will some day elect pitchers whose career IP are dwarfed by Rivera‚Äôs. And they will all be asked to do the same thing Firpo Marberry did in 1925 and Tommy Bond did in 1876: get critical outs.
@WillHoenike @ThatBoy_GoodRS @NotMrTibbs @officialBBWAA A pitcher is a pitcher; we‚Äôre now talking volume and use pattern and evolution that began in 1876. ~500 IP a season was expected until 1890; ~350 was stardom into the ‚Äò20s; ~300 was annual until 1980; we haven‚Äôt seen 250 since 2011.

@thorn_john @MarkArmour04 Absolutely agree on all fronts. But all that also obtains if we throw Ottavino back to 1927 instead of bringing Ruth here. He‚Äôd be a starter. He‚Äôd have no protection against injury. He‚Äôd be lucky if there was a pitching coach. The parks might victimize him. 1/4 the # of P spots!
@thorn_john The other imponderable is: what if Ruth had merely a Nautilus machine in 1923? ;-) Or what if managers walked him as they walked Bonds? Or if Ulysses S. Grant had cruise missiles? ;-)
Let us add in the true intangibles: the availability of training and diet, and the incentive of not $100,000 a year ($1.4m in 2018 terms) but $30,000,000. What would a cut, trained, marginally more disciplined Ruth do today? https://t.co/bckiHHqLSP

ALL stats are like that. ERA is based on individual choices made by sportswriters. Batting average once included walks. RBI was bitterly controversial. Stolen Bases used to include going from 1st to 3rd on a single. And the Triple Crown stats + wins DIDN‚ÄôT dominate the narrative? https://t.co/ffylUnvlZS
@commish625 @GlobeKPD The 1st edition of the SABR research journal described the history of, and called for the adoption of, a radical new wave stat called On Base Percentage. This was in 1973. 		ERA was new, controversial in 1913. The Sporting News wouldn‚Äôt publish the new pitchers‚Äô wins in the 1880s

In fact dating back to the 1884 World Series only a dozen teams have reached the Fall Classic with a 2nd Baseman 35 or older - and only five of them won.
And Frisch was player-manager so it‚Äôs not like somebody was going to keep him on the bench.
The Robinson Can√≥ stat I presented just now on @sportscenter: For him to lead the Mets to a World Series win he‚Äôd have to do it as the second oldest second baseman ever for a Series-winning team. He turns 37 as the Series begins. Frankie Frisch, ‚Äò34 Cards, was 37 years 24 days

@70sBaseball And the ‚Äú.300 hitter‚Äù last hit .300 in a full season in 2014, and has hit more than 23 homers in a season once since 2013.
@70sBaseball Oh and the $63,000,000 just spent already figures in getting rid of the bad contracts. If they are now planning to sign Bryce Harper and Manny Machado, the trade makes marginal sense. Otherwise it takes them out of contention TFN
@70sBaseball He‚Äôs 36. You are obligated to him until he‚Äôs 41. There‚Äôs no indication he can still play 2B. HE cheated to stay relevant THIS year. And ‚Äúthe old regime‚Äù drafted deGrom, Conforto, Nimmo, Rosario, Familia, Alonso, Gimenez, Harvey, Gsellman; traded for Syndergaard, Wheeler.

The man who pinch-hit for Vin Scully was Len Morreale, a power hitter who would become Fordham‚Äôs second baseman in 1948. He did not play professionally. 		The Yale shortstop whose homer won the ‚ÄúBush/Scully‚Äù game, Artie Moher, spent two years in the Tigers‚Äô farm system
For the record, the starting pitchers were both professionals within two years. Jim Arbucho of Fordham went into the Giants‚Äô system and Yale‚Äôs Frank Quinn got a huge bonus (possibly $75,000) to join the Red Sox and spent the entire 1949 season and part of 1950 with Boston

@BSmile @Bbl_Astrophyscs For years, the Dodgers media guide also claimED their franchise started in 1890 though the team merely moved from the AA to the NL that year. 		First rule of historical research is to use contemporary original documents, not later ones. 1916 World Series program reads DODGERS
@BSmile @Bbl_Astrophyscs You know Baseball-Reference isn‚Äôt, like, official or anything.
Gibson (1.12 ERA, 13 ShO, Cy) vs McLain (31 wins, 280 K, Cy) 1968. Kind of hard to compare anything to that. https://t.co/rum5n3bWr5
@Bbl_Astrophyscs @BSmile For God‚Äôs sake PLEASE stop saying the 1916 Brooklyn team was ‚Äúthe Robins‚Äù - the name didn‚Äôt come into wide use until the very late teens and early 20s https://t.co/SlVHLGpY0a
Bravo. https://t.co/EYnTLbC6iH
Let me correct this. I‚Äôve been making this mistake since about 1977. The Red Sox played the ‚Äò15 and ‚Äò16 World Series at Braves Field, but 1918 was back at Fenway (because it didn‚Äôt much matter - with WW1 and the flu - the three home games in ‚Äò18 didn‚Äôt come CLOSE to selling out)
They drew 43,620 to what is now (in part) the site of BU‚Äôs Nickerson Field at a time when Fenway fit about 34,365 (the Braves - naturally - had played the 1914 Series at Fenway because IT then had a larger capacity)
Another little reminder from history...tonight‚Äôs will be the FIRST Red Sox/Dodgers World Series Game at Fenway Park. 		Sox played the ‚Äò16 Series (as well as 1915 and 1918) at Braves Field because it had more seats to sell: https://t.co/EWjh074AxB

@davewa33 And is that the 28-year old Chris Taylor who has now had exactly two seasons of more than 151 plate appearances? And whose 2018 numbers all plummeted from 2017 - except for the extra double, the three triples, and the 21% jump in strikeouts? Oh ok.
@davewa33 That‚Äôs the 38-year old Rich Hill who debuted in 2005, has started only 143 games in the regular season and only 10 in eight playoff series, and has only started more than 16 games in one year four times? Oh, ok. LOL

Plus you can‚Äôt turn the stat on and off...if it speaks for Brees as #1 all time, then it speaks for Carson Palmer as 12th...and Joe Flacco as the 23rd. https://t.co/FXxkv7RcRu
The biggest part of the job is championships https://t.co/FXxkv7RcRu
Stan, it‚Äôs like claiming Pete Rose is THE greatest BB player of all time. Or even the greatest batter. 		Yardage = skill + longevity, both of which are factors. But if you apply them to Brees you must also apply them to the 12TH greatest* QB of all time: CARSON PALMER		*by yards https://t.co/9PIxSIKjvk
Oh Stan, no. Brees has played his life in a 16-game schedule. The NFL didn‚Äôt go to 14 until Starr was 27. 		If you‚Äôre judging by yardage, that makes Eli Manning the 6th all time greatest quarterback? https://t.co/MZeEkKaq8D
This - not to single out Tyler - is representative of the hysterical coverage here that has thus far neglected the obvious here: the Yankees scored ONE RUN LAST NIGHT. The last 14 Boston runs were pad. https://t.co/UU6Eqz8Oc7

See you on @sportscenter tonight on @espn at 6 PM EDT before the wild card game, the premise of which was to replicate the drama of Dent vs. Monster
I‚Äôd been at Yankee Stadium and flew up that AM. Eastern Shuttle guaranteed you a seat, even if they had to roll out a 2nd plane. There were 7 extra passengers and we got our own plane: me, AL President Lee MacPhail, Dick Schaap and his 9-year old, @JeremySchaap. Me? I was 19 ;-)
My friend, his wife, and I drove back to Ithaca NY that night. He did not say a word for eight hours until I guiltily hopped out of his car. He was convinced he caused it (probably because I spent all of Dent‚Äôs at bat warning him he had just caused it).
Tickets had only gone on sale 36 hours before, so there were only 100 NY fans at Fenway. As a cry of anguish rose along with Dent‚Äôs homer, we stood. Down in the front row I saw a high school classmate. Two rows in front I saw two witnesses to the ‚Äò48 playoff game burst into tears
DEEP TO LEFT...40 years ago Jim Spencer flied out with two on in the 7th.  My best friend, a Red Sox fan, sat back in our Fenway seats and said ‚ÄúThank goodness. Dent‚Äôs no home run threat.‚Äù I looked at him, jaw agape. ‚ÄúYou do realize what now MUST happen, right?‚Äù I was a NYY fan https://t.co/sgh5vCCcVp

Take back what I said before. THIS is the most #Mets thing ever. David Wright retirement night, with his highlight video and speech coming up after his farewell game...which is scoreless in the TOP OF THE 12TH #AndThenFireworks
This coach is a failure. Nothing - no tradition, no bullshit stupid macho credo, nothing - justifies this. If the school won‚Äôt fire him, he should be banned. https://t.co/ZqpgV8S0wv
Wright with an on-air shoutout to @Jay_HorwitzPR, Ethan Wilson and the late Shannon Forde of the #Mets‚Äô media staff. Class act start to last. Make him the GM. Hell, make him the team president.
Wright‚Äôs exit interview on @SNYtv is a reminder of the genuineness and effervescence he projects on TV. When I did MLB for Turner in ‚Äò13 I recommended 2 people to them: Wright and @45PedroMartinez. David laughed and gave me a big handshake and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just not me.‚Äù Our loss.
Mets broadcast just reported David Wright is ‚Äúin the elevator‚Äù on the way to their booth. Knowing the elevators at CitiField it‚Äôll take five minutes because they have to stop to pick up some guys with trash bags on the 2nd Floor and take him to the 4th.
The most #Mets thing ever. David Wright pulled after four innings and two at bats - rather than giving him a 3rd AB - despite not even looking rusty at the plate or in the field. I mean, What? Playing him two more innings would‚Äôve invalidated the race for last place? https://t.co/N1kX2S9Ffx
The phrase can mean many things to many people, but they‚Äôre all offensive. And by ignoring Sabathia‚Äôs indefensible use of it - he hasn‚Äôt even apologized, and is being lauded as a great teammate - @mlb just endorsed all of them
.@mlb suspends CC Sabathia for 5 games -next year, not in the playoffs- for deliberately retaliating against Jesus Sucre with an HBP.  A joke on its face. But there‚Äôs no punishment nor reference to him shouting the phobic phrase ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for you, bitch‚Äù towards the Rays dugout

After I quit WCVB-TV in Boston because I refused to stop the humor and opinion, the vindictive and petty Gen‚Äôl Manager said to my agent ‚ÄúHe will never again work in this business.‚Äù This was in 1984. He took early retirement in ‚Äò94. I‚Äôve outlasted him 24 years #ShareYourRejections

Small solace here. Another issue: did Mattingly know? Pitching coach Juan Nieves? The @marlins have long been an embarrassment to baseball and a running con job.

BTW if you think deGrom is a new or novel development: through 20 starts: 5 wins and a 1.71 ERA. In 1988, Joe Magrane led the NL with a 2.18 ERA, made 24 starts, and ended with 5 wins. The ‚Äúwin‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a good trophy stat, as long as you give a reliever the same W as a starter
It is amazing to watch Jacob deGrom, start after start, PROVE that the pitching win is not a useful evaluative statistic - while many of those covering him insist that for him to have a ‚Äúgood‚Äù season he must ‚Äúfind a way‚Äù to ‚Äúget some wins.‚Äù #ThisIsTheWholePoint

Just a note: With 19 now, @JoeyBats19 is fifth on the Mets in walks. The other guys on the top 10 all have at least twice as many plate appearances as he does. He‚Äôs also one way from cracking the NL‚Äôs Top 50. If he qualified, his OPS would be 25th in the NL.
This is why it was better for the world before the Cubs won the World Series. 		They are now expecting 162-0, forever. 		There‚Äôs another one of these from a self-identifying Cubs fan who says Maddon is a lousy ‚Äúcoach.‚Äù https://t.co/aoxQrqksQC

If the #Yankees tried this, the Steinbrenner Boys would be run out of town. The pleasantness of the Wilpon Family is no excuse for the kid-gloves treatment. The Madoff Whine is a decade old. 	1. Keep the pitchers	2. Sign Machado and others 	or	3. Get out; sell to professionals
For generations, locally and nationally, the #Mets have been permitted to get away with operating as if their market consisted solely of Flushing, NY - a neighborhood the size of Brandon Nimmo‚Äôs Cheyenne Wyoming. It‚Äôs timid, fearful commentary and analysis.
To hear the ‚ÄúTrade deGrom + Syndergaard‚Äù talk bleated without question on national TV is infuriating. #Mets may pretend otherwise but they are NOT a small market team. The solution to the ‚Äúdilemma‚Äù is not trades, it is spending $ on extant stars and free agents, or new ownership

1. It‚Äôs anti-historical too. These current shifts have been used off and on since the 1870‚Äôs	1a.
