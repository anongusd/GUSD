Corporations should only get a tax break if they keep jobs in the U.S. and pay their workers well. And if they pay so little that their employees are forced onto public assistance, they should have to reimburse taxpayers for subsidizing their wages.
One way we achieve the dignity of work is by passing the Patriot Corporation Act and the Corporate Freeloader Fee.

When we see a White House that looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives, we know that our fight is far from over.
It happened because people like you stood up &amp; demanded their government work for them. It was citizens &amp; workers, in union halls &amp; church basements. It was civil rights activists &amp; child advocates who took on powerful special interests &amp; changed this country for the better.
Progress didn‚Äôt‚Äîand still doesn't‚Äîhappen on its own.
Throughout the 20th century, we changed that. We passed worker safety laws and overtime pay. We banned child labor. We passed clean air and safe drinking water laws. We enacted Social Security and Medicare, and workers‚Äô rights and women‚Äôs rights and civil rights.
In the early days of the 20th century coal miners took a canary down into the mines with them to warn them of poisonous gases. Those workers didn‚Äôt have a union strong enough or a government that cared enough to protect them.
It represents the role of government to support the middle class, and those who aspire to the middle class.		It represents the progress we have made ‚Äì and the society we continue to fight for every day.
The canary pin was given to me two decades ago by a Lorain steelworker at a Workers Memorial Day rally. I wear the canary instead of the official Senate pin because it represents all of us.
I proudly wear suits made by union workers ten miles from my house in Cleveland, and on the lapel of those suits, I wear a pin depicting a canary in a birdcage. Here's the story:
We had our first Iowa event in Cresco. It's a community filled with people who work hard‚Äîpeople who have been overlooked by Washington and overlooked by Wall Street.		Their voices need to be heard and their stories deserve action in Washington. So, we chose to come here. https://t.co/rUO7wOC6uM
Our financial system is controlled by large banks that don‚Äôt serve the real economy‚Äîthey redirect wealth created by workers to CEO bonuses. That's just wrong.		We need to break up the power large banks have over our financial system and reward investments in communities and jobs.
Thank you to the hundreds of people who braved record low temperatures in Cleveland‚Äîand joined us virtually from around the country‚Äîto stand up for the dignity of work. 		I'm so inspired by your activism as we hit the road for the Dignity of Work tour. Onward. https://t.co/WzB0hKsgX8

I‚Äôve said it before and I say it again to you tonight: 		This is our America. And we will never give up the hallowed ground of patriotism to the extremists ‚Äì not at the Statehouse and not in the White House.
And that fight is what this tour is all about. https://t.co/TjzYNebORv
My friend Rita Lewis told me they feel like they are invisible. They are not invisible to us. We fight for them &amp; for all workers. 		We fight for the construction worker in Manchester. The physical therapist in Reno. The restaurant worker in Florence. The teacher in Iowa City.
Even folks with pensions are under attack. Across Ohio and across the country, hundreds of thousands of Teamsters, miners, and others are living in fear of losing the pensions they earned over a lifetime of work.
And we know it‚Äôs even worse for women and people of color. They face the same challenges, on top of sexism and racism that make it even harder to get ahead, no matter how hard they work. https://t.co/TieXth7RF8
All across the country, hard work isn‚Äôt paying off like it should.		Corporate profits have soared. Executive compensation has exploded. Workers are producing more than ever before. But their wages are flat.
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. taught us, ‚Äúall labor has dignity,‚Äù and no job is really menial if it pays adequate wages.
She‚Äôs right. And we‚Äôre going to fight like hell to keep GM in Lordstown and save those jobs. https://t.co/AUlGW8jViy
Last week I was in Lordstown meeting with workers who have been pushed aside by GM. One woman said to me: ‚ÄúAll we want is to get up &amp; work hard, support our families, build a nest egg, &amp; have decent healthcare &amp; retirement. But those jobs are getting harder &amp; harder to come by.‚Äù
We fight for our progressive values. We fight for the dignity of work. It‚Äôs who we are. It‚Äôs how we govern. 		It‚Äôs how we won. And it‚Äôs how we‚Äôll win in 2020.
But we still have more work to do. And every time the Affordable Care Act is under attack, you step up. You‚Äôve called and written and marched and shared your stories. And the law still stands today because of your work.
When I first ran for Congress, I promised to refuse Congressional health insurance &amp; pay for my own until we passed affordable healthcare for everyone. I paid my own insurance until we passed Obamacare. Today, Connie &amp; I are on the same exchange system available to all Americans.
Together, we‚Äôve fought for workers‚Äô rights &amp; voting rights &amp; civil rights, &amp; women‚Äôs rights &amp; LGBTQ rights. With your support, I voted against NAFTA &amp; the misnamed Defense of Marriage Act &amp; the Iraq War. I‚Äôve stood up to Wall Street &amp; the gun lobby. And you‚Äôve stood with me.

Apprehensions of illegal crossings at the border are at a historic low. It's down nearly 80% since 2000.		The only ‚Äústate of emergency‚Äù is in @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs head. #FactsMatter
President Trump has a habit of not telling the truth. But #FactsMatter, so as @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs speaks tonight I will be sharing the real facts of how the Trump shutdown is impacting people in Ohio and across the country.

That is the message coming out of Ohio in 2018, and that is the blueprint for our nation in 2020.
Let our country‚Äîour nation‚Äôs citizens, our Democratic Party, my fellow elected officials all over the country‚Äîlet them all cast their eyes toward the heartland, to the industrial Midwest, to our Great Lakes state.   		Let them hear what we say.		Let them see what we do.
I drive a Jeep made by union workers in Toledo. My suit is made by union workers less than 10 miles from our home in Cleveland. I wear this canary pin because it represents all of us in Ohio.

We love this country. We fight for the people who make it work. And we will‚Äîthanks to all of you‚Äîcontinue that fight for another six years.
We do not appeal to some by pushing down others.  We do not lie. We do not engage in hate speech. And we do not rip babies from their families at the border.
When we fight for workers, we fight for all people, whether they punch a clock or swipe a badge, earn a salary or make tips. Whether they are raising children or caring for an aging parent.
Tonight, Ohio, you showed the country that by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work, we can carry a state Donald Trump won by nearly 10 points.

Ohioans have seen years of trade and tax policy that shut down production in Lordstown and moved it overseas.		They see a tax bill jammed through Congress by the wealthiest 1%.		In 21 days, we fight back.
Just awful.		We should be making it easier for struggling Americans to get ahead. Plans like these will do the opposite.		https://t.co/GE2nXKFE8g
By working hard and showing up on days like this, we will make change in Cincinnati, in Columbus, and in Washington.		Great to be on the trail with @AftabPureval today! https://t.co/WlmkaP17r0
This year, we're going to change this country‚Äîbecause of you.		21 days. Let's keep working. https://t.co/8ti3L6HetL

Two years ago, I stood with Vice President Biden to announce a plan that would have given 130,000 hardworking Ohioans a raise by making them eligible for overtime pay.		But because of this administration, most Ohioans never got that raise.		This is why we need to win in 3 weeks.
It doesn't get much better than this‚Äîwhat an honor to spend time with @Madeleine and @CoryBooker on the trail. https://t.co/3WjQJDxZ4b

To pay for the $1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the wealthiest 1%, @RepJimRenacci wants to cut funding for:		‚Ä¢ Social Security	‚Ä¢ Medicare	‚Ä¢ Medicaid		Ridiculous. #OHSenDebate https://t.co/QlYKMdN2HU
Sherrod is committed to ensuring all Ohioans, and all Americans, have the right to vote. 		As Ohio‚Äôs Secretary of State, he convinced @McDonalds to put voter registration applications on tray liners to make it more accessible for people to register. https://t.co/MQbC65AvLR
When thousands of children were being separated from their families at the border, @RepJimRenacci refused to speak out, despite widespread condemnation from both parties.		His inability to criticize the policy shows he can‚Äôt be trusted to stand up for Ohio. #OHSenDebate

We could go on about @RepJimRenacci‚Äôs shady ways, but this all adds up to one thing: 		Congressman Renacci only looks out for himself.
One more thing: @RepJimRenacci has a long relationship with convicted felon Ben Suarez.		The two exchanged more than 40 phone calls in the time surrounding an FBI investigation into Suarez‚Äôs shady campaign contributions.
Don‚Äôt forget that @RepJimRenacci was a registered lobbyist WHILE serving in Congress.		He was the only registered lobbyist in the 112th Congress. https://t.co/sBUf4XLv5H

The Supreme Court's decision in #JanusvsAFSCME is a strike against workers' rights to advocate for themselves, guaranteed by statute and the First Amendment. 		This decision will cut wages and benefits for millions of workers. It's a major step backwards.

Every time you give $26, you're not just supporting me and this campaign. You're supporting our values. You're demonstrating your commitment to priorities like access to healthcare, protecting Medicare, and the fight for equality.
Today is one of my favorite days of the month: the 26th. It's special to me and my campaign because it represents what our grassroots army is built on: one $26 contribution at a time.
Three years ago today, thanks to the courage of Jim Obergefell‚Äîand so many Americans‚Äîour country became a little more equal, as the Supreme Court ruled that #LoveIsLove.		Today, we celebrate, and recognize the work ahead to ensure full civil rights for the LGBTQ community.
