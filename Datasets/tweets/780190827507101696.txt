@hoosier820 @Kajuncook519 @mitchellvii @GOP And Dems have gone 100% Evil. Spreading hate and discontent.
@AOC Dems are the party of open borders against the will of the American People. Dems are the party of illegals, drug smugglers, and child sex traffickers. Dems are NOT the party of America or the American People.
@RepAdamSchiff Why is this worthless clown schiff hell bent on wasting taxpayer money? Just because schiff the clown hates President Trump?? Too funny.. Need to vote clowns like schiff out. His time has passed.
