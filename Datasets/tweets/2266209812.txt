@JayLouis @TheBigBadDub @jaketapper Democrats, in their zeal to get Trump and republicans, abandoned respect for due process, presumption of innocence, charity, and mercy. 		Who signed up for this nonsense besides democrats? There’s your answer for why you are only seeing your own getting devoured.

@robbystarbuck I remember Hillary defending late term abortion in the debates. Medicalized the killing a near-born. On national television.	I was horrified. I’ve wondered many times if her losing the election had something to do with horrifying a great many ppl that night.
@mitchellvii I think flattering themselves is their core. I can’t think of anything they say/do that cant be reduced to complimenting or flattering themselves		They use Trump as vehicle to give themselves compliments		“We’re better than this” is a fitting slogan for a party full of themselves
RT @kingsquest88: @PattyMurray It's our wall. Americans voted for it.
@lp398vc @brithume @rolandsmartin @FoxNews @tombrokaw Attributing a racist sentiment to republicans that Brokaw claims, without evidence, that he pressed seemed malicious to me.		And as a segue to make a point about assimilation, like “I’ll cushion this point here by crediting repubs with super racism here” is some craftiness.
@dbongino He “thinks” it is. 		He may as well say “we’re closer now than ever” to it coming to an end. About as meaningless.

@KerwinFranks @nytimes @jimrutenberg Or powerful ppl, who want to flood the country with cheap labor so they don’t have to fulfill the duty of paying Americans a fair wage, and export American jobs for the same reason, will happily kick Americans again by calling anyone who objects to it a “racist.”		Useful idiot.

@realdawnhoward @FuriosaSK @BrentHBaker @tombrokaw Or maybe, like all racists, he has a racist thought and the urge to express it.

@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Border barrier construction? 		Geez, thats a very convoluted, marbles-in-your-mouth, way of saying “wall.”
@NRO @DavidAFrench What’s your argument? That mostly innocuous encounters and dealings with Russians, and Roger Stone being a notorious mischievous character, is ... unseemly?		As usual, French doesn’t tackle substance or veracity. What matters is the grannies at the country club will be alarmed.
@rkylesmith @NRO It’s a really entertaining documentary. I’ve watched it several times.
@townhallcom Trumps media mouthpieces are already using the term “border security” as the thing Dems won’t agree to. Not “wall.”		Looks to me like they’re gearing up to pretend that democrats “finally agreeing” to a “border security” bill with no wall (I.e. status quo) is a win.
@SteveScalise Stop saying border security. Say the wall. They’re refusing to fund the wall.		Do you think we won’t notice when they agree to fund “border security” I.e. keep the status quo? You are really gearing up to spin keeping the status quo as a win for Trump. 		Say “wall” if I’m wrong.
@MatchforR @ScottAdamsSays Democrats have been firm that they will never give funding for a wall.		“Border security” is the status quo. I.e. no wall.

@McAllisterDen @brianduncan1102 I’m sure the world will come to see it that way when they take a gander over to right wing media.
@SenJohnBarrasso @POTUS Why would democrats do that? Their tactics just paid off. Republicans have reinforced the same lesson that democrats learned a long time ago: the republicans are yellow-bellied chumps.
@RogerGrm @lawdog515 @dbongino Except democrats have been clear there will be no negotiating for the wall. 		Why are republicans acting like the Dems have said anything different? 		“Border security” in Demspeak is not the wall.
@lawdog515 @dbongino Not really, now Trump is being faulted for shutting govt down and making ppl suffer for no reason.		“No reason” indeed. He got nothing out of this. How are the optics of Dems cheering and his base being either furious or deflated or, worst of all, spinning this loss as a ‘win’?
@dbongino Ridiculous headline.
@BreakingNLive @JackPosobiec That’s what was said before the shutdown. How many more chances is he gonna give democrats who have been crystal clear they are not agreeing to a wall?
@alexanderbruz @RyanAFournier Oh? Is that why both Trump and his mouthpieces are now using the democrats language of “border security” instead of “wall”?		Like we just wouldn’t notice.
@KatiePavlich He’s being consistent. Democrats have been crystal clear.		Why aren’t republicans listening??? Why are they giving democrats the benefit of the doubt about things dems never said and have been clear they never will?
@mitchellvii I’ll add again it might not be a bad idea to abandon Trump whenever he abandons the wall. 		Let him and democrats know it’s not Trump the democrats are fighting, and that Trump is there to fight for the will of his constituents that got him there.
@mitchellvii I’ll add it’s not one-issue. The wall is also deeply linked to Trumps economic message about fighting depressed wages due to illegal immigration.
@mitchellvii My bet is they’ll check out.		I won’t. But I get it. I checked out during Bush, and Obama when republicans put up 2 pussy-hats to run against him.
@DonaldUS2020 @toofatshakur @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump I thought this shutdown was supposed to be the final move before declaring national emergency. 		A few more chances and the democrats are gonna start to think that republicans are all bark. And chumps.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Hard to see Trumps genius watching democrats cheer about how Pelosi cleaned the “weak republicans” clocks, that trump is “finished” and that they will win 2020.
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump “Border security.”		Using democrats terms now like a chump. 		It’s called “the wall” @SebGorka
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Don’t GAF about state of the union. Build the wall!
@SebGorka @realDonaldTrump Democrats have been loud and clear they’re not ever agreeing to the wall.		This argument isn’t about border security, it’s about the wall.		This is ridiculous, the democrats are being crystal clear what their intentions are and you’re still being charitable?
@aeg0717 @RyanAFournier It’s not like it was leaked to Jake Tapper. If CNN got a tip from Mueller’s team, it came via Obama’s CIA/FBI whom CNN has on their payroll to deliver intelligence propaganda to their audience.
@cory_ida @RyanAFournier “Real journalism” that employs Obama’s CIA/FBI.

@katywh20 @brianduncan1102 @WilliamSilaghi @RepCloakroom The democrats are leveraging too. They voted against ppl getting paid during shutdown for the second time.		So, let’s stop the bs of pretending democrats are the caring ones. Their words about how much they care are useless.
@brianduncan1102 @katywh20 @WilliamSilaghi @RepCloakroom Trump presented an offer and Dems not only rejected it before presented, but they couldn’t even put forth a counter offer.		Instead they want Trump to just figure out what they want.
