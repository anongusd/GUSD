@AFNtelevision @danawhite The UFC ESPN prelims started at 10am JKT. AFN does not carry ESPN prelim fights.
@AFNtelevision @danawhite I have been told by AFN that you all do not have the rights to air UFC fights that are on ESPN
@AFNtelevision @danawhite Yes, I can watch the  #UFC235 main card pay per view portion, but not the prelim fights that are on ESPN.
@danawhite, hey boss, did you know the troops stationed overseas can‚Äôt watch the fights that air on ESPN?  Armed Forces Network (AFN) doesn‚Äôt have rights to air ESPN UFC fights which is a huge bummer, especially on day of monster card like #UFC235 Can you help fix that please???

Rooting for @ColbyCovMMA tonight!!! Bring it home baby!!!! #usnavy #maga @realDonaldTrump
I am the biggest @TheNotoriousMMA fan! BUT, I hate to say that I don‚Äôt think he can withstand or last against @TeamKhabib. @TeamKhabib is truly a phenom. #UFC
RT @bokamotoESPN: Wonderboy flew to a 25-year-old's backyard who was ranked lower than him, watched him miss weight, beat him (IMO), watche‚Ä¶
Terrible decision. @WonderboyMMA Clearly won that fight, goes to show you can‚Äôt leave it in the judges hands #UFCLiverpool #UFCFightNight
@GilbertMelendez This is terrible... TOO MANY PLATFORMS. They know people will pay up for UFC so that‚Äôs why they do this crap. I am a major UFC FAN, but I say BOYCOTT!!!
RT @IamTheImmortal: Training is king, nutrition is queen, your body is the kingdom. What would that make the @ufc octagon?
