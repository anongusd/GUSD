@SenGillibrand I wholeheartedly agree with your confidence in the abilities of women, however this is a completely sexist statement as you imply men don't get things done.  For the record I am not easily offended by a silly statement, just want to point out the blatant sexism. https://t.co/uNJG4VdKB3
Amazing how far we've come since Trump was called un-american for joking about only accepting the results of the election...if he won! 🤣🤣🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/NGXzZ8DgJE

What a MEATHEAD! He sure doesn't speak for me! https://t.co/36kzt0kHjP
Hey, it's MEATHEAD with TRUMP Derangement Syndrome in full effect! These comments are hysterical...Pence will be indicated too?!?!  Pence isn't even being accused of or investigated for anything!  Trump &amp; Pence EASILY on route to a 2020 win! https://t.co/h8lVTIuZpT
@amflyboys @PeteHegseth You clearly didnt watch the event! The president answered all 4 of Acostas questions and if he didnt want to answer Acostas easily predictable questions, he could have just as easily not called on Acosta in the 1st place. Acostas immature/unprofessional behavior is the issue!
RT @PeteHegseth: WH is ready... https://t.co/jUEYEvULnA
@PiercespDavis @CoryBooker Way too many assumptions!  The investigation has cost over $17 mil already...are the investigators that bad that it would take all this time &amp; money and still nothing?!? Again, all Trump assoc charges have nothing to do with the investigation! I see that as textbook witch hunt!

@secupp High fives definitely not called for, but the ridiculous double standard and irony absolutely must be highlighted!  Where are all the #BelieveAllWomen talking heads now?!? Where are @KamalaHarris &amp; @maziehirono (among many others) now? #Civililty1st
@CoryBooker You are purposely misleading your followers and constituents.  NONE of the actual charges have anything to do with Trump collusion or obstruction. I think you know all too well that an investigation into anyone will turn up something on someone! That's exactly where we are here!
@grahamu64 @JeffFlake The House flip was a check on Trump and another drastic shift in the beliefs of Dem candidates.  However, can't ignore Trump's show of support with majority R Senators winning where he campaigned for them.
@TheJordanRachel 🤣🤣🤣🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/drhobqYJpp
@LexyRoam @msaether21 @CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon @Acosta 🤣🤣🤣  Another great example of CNN's "journalism"...	https://t.co/lxOxcpyKVY
@msaether21 @CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon 🤔 if it weren't for "chaos in the WH", I'm not sure CNN would ever have anything to report on...that's why they send @Acosta to create chaos!
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Let's also point out @realDonaldTrump answered the question + 3 more!  Jim told him he was wrong! Could've said "respectfully disagree" but even that would just be argumentative...not reporting! Jim's problem isnt press access, it's just plain disagreement, like every other Dem!
@RepSwalwell Guess you weren't paying attention when @secdef said his department doesn't do stunts!  	🇺🇸🤣🇺🇸🤣🇺🇸🤣

@mdornic @Acosta @Judgenap CNN has not lost any access here at all! Only Acosta and deservingly so! If Acosta wins back access, 300 million Americans will be able to use that legal precedent to gain access to the White House to act like immature children! Sounds like a great idea! 🤣🇺🇸🤣🇺🇸 #Civility1st

@DoriMarlin @MikeTobinFox @Acosta @realDonaldTrump Try to view it without politics. Every politician interrupts and gets some questions friendlier than others. That's not what this is about. Jim got answers to 4 questions and...POTUS does not have to continue picking on him to ask questions, but he does.	#Civility1st
@benshapiro I agree with most things you say but in this case, what were you watching??? Acosta's actions have no relation to 1st A or Gov't accountability and no have no place in the WH under ANY POTUS! If I behaved like that in the course of doing my job, I would be fired! #Civility1st
This should be the scene across the USA every time an innocent family loses someone doing a service/job where they fully understand that this can happen at any time!  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #ThankYouForYourService Sgt. Helus https://t.co/d9qzeyrTwW
@LarrySabato @FoxNews @CNN Very surprised at your statement. Extremely few act like Jim does regularly! I am not at all worried about John Roberts or any other @FoxNews reporter ever disrespecting a Dem president or acting like Jim Acosta! BTW, no issue with Jim's ?'s,  just his behavior! Unacceptable!
@JoeConchaTV @dbongino They think its OK to wait until someone gets hurt and then MAYBE issue an apology.
A lifetime ban would be too good for him! https://t.co/0LnGSo12Ho
Lifetime WH ban for Acosta would be too good! https://t.co/3HPrbiguoL
@GeraldoRivera @megynkelly Probably the same people out defending Jim Acosta's actions today and complaining that POTUS talks too tough! 	We need civility! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
@RealSaavedra @DonaldJTrumpJr Let's also point out @realDonaldTrump answered the question + 3 more!  Jim told him he was wrong! Couldve said "respectfully disagree" but even that would just be argumentative...not reporting! Jim's problem isnt press access, it's just plain disagreement, like any other Dem!
@ArthurSchwartz @DonaldJTrumpJr 🤣🤣🤣
@BillOReilly I dont see how anyone can see this any other way. Jim was given answers to 4 questions!!! The problem only began when @Acosta told the President that his answer was wrong and then refused to allow the event to move on! If WH guests cannot agree to civility, they should be banned!
@MikeTobinFox @Acosta So if every person invited to attend WH press events wants to act like @Acosta did today, that should be acceptable? There were reporters in the room that were not given any questions. @realDonaldTrump gave Jim the opportunity and had no problem with his choice of question.
