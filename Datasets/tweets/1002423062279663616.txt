@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ These same Dems voted for 25b funding &amp; 350 miles of border fencing a few yrs a go claiming a border crisis.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ Along with tech upgrades.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ 250 miles of barrier fencing is what we need at high traffic areas requested by security professionals.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ https://t.co/AfEuVzavS8
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ It is an invasion. An organized invasion.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ We have had over 25k new illegal migrants at our Southern Border since Oct 2018 per border agents.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ We on on our 5th huge organized caravan in 1 1/2 yrs.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ We have over 800k back logged illegal alien cases clogging our immigration court system.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ Here‚Äôs the deal. Dems have no interest in listening to President Trump, DHS, Border agents, or Angel Families.
@RepFredUpton @RepDebDingell @CStokesWXYZ I heard you on my local radio station. You voted against the barriers our DHS requested? You said Trump action is unConstitutional?
