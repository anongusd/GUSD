.@NSAGov surveyed 126 tactical cyber operators about stress as they complete their missions, and found that as an operator's frustraton goes up, self assessment of performance goes down -- but is not impacted by fatigue, time, effort, or mental or physical demand. #BlackHat2018

We’re hearing from Allan Friedman, director of cyber security with @CommerceGov about the “software bill of materials” #BlackHat2018 https://t.co/LtOLMRLmLH

For her HTTPS project, that involved an #infosecHaiku team activity. Yup.
Then, when pursuing long intensive projects, strategically pick milestones, communicate those milestones and maintain energy by celebrating progress along the way, says @laparisa #BlackHat2018
To truly create a defense from cyberthreats and stop playing wack-a-mole, we need to start with identifying the root cause of the problems uncovered, and not just be satisfied with isolated fixes, says @laparisa #BlackHat2018
If there’s one thing @laparisa wants us to take away from her talk, it’s that “blockchain is not going to solve all our security problems” 😂

Beyond the governmentwide approach, @VP calls on industry and partnerships for a nationwide approach #DHSCyberSummit
We can’t prevent every attack in the digital sphere...but “our government will continue to ensure the resiliency of our critical infrastructure” so when these breaches do occur, we come back fast, @VP says #DHSCyberSummit
Our adversaries increasingly use the digital world to manipulate, @VP says, and America needs a central hub for cybersecurity — a new agency under DHS: Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency #DHSCyberSummit

Side note, @ENERGY’s Menezes said the financial sector has been setting some key cybersecurity standards and best practices for government to watch &amp; learn from #DHSCyberSummit
According to Scott DePasquale, president and CEO of #FSARC, the sectors have to do their part as operators and holders of the critical info needed to “secure the bigger system of systems” and prioritize those sector vulnerabilities for govt #DHSCyberSummit  #informationsharing
Information sharing is important, but also identifying the threats and developing the tech necessary to ensure the energy system at large is operational, says @ENERGY undersecretary Mark Menezes #DHSCyberSummit

On resiliency: "Our ability to defend needs to scale. In order for it to scale, humans need to do things they're best at and machines need to do things they're best at," says John Donovan, CEO @ATT, "We're going to take advantage of what machines can do." #DHSCyberSummit

In fact, the @DHSgov NPPD is kicking of the National Risk Management Initiative to move beyond information and into risk management in a cross-sector, government-industry manner, according to Krebs.
But we need to move past basic information sharing, and work cross-sector on integrated risk assessment, integrated strategic planning and integrated risk mitigation strategies, according to @DHSgov Krebs #electionsecurity
Flagging foreign actor-influenced social media sites, propaganda, disinformation online, etc. is a government/industry partnership and collaboration. "We have social media companies working with government to identify information or flag it or take it down," @DHSgov Krebs said.
Right now, @DHSgov Krebs isn't seeing #hacking threats to election systems for 2018 #Midterms, but rather disinformation operations from foreign actors. #electionsecurity

"[DHS] should be managing risk in an unclassified manner that's informed by threat intelligence," said @DHSgov Christopher Krebs, under secretary for National Protection and Programs Directorate #electionsecurity
But to effectively share info, @DHSgov Krebs said he largely aims to operate in an unclassified space, so that the products pushes out are immediately accessible to a broader community.

Do citizens need digital bill of rights? We need a “Digital norm of responsibility,” @SecNielsen says. Everyone has a role and respobsility, she stresses #RSAC
“We need to continue moving forward and do more” with election security, @SecNielsen says #RSAC
.@SecNielsen gets asked, going into the 2018 midterms, are we secure? “We’ll continue to do everything to secure election infrastructure,” she says #RSAC
.@SecNielsen says she’s seen “monumental partnerships” to bolster #cyber. Says DHS will work more with allies to combat threats. “We will quickly call out nefarious activity.”#RSAC https://t.co/fyEljPTET3
“We need to be more agile, more holistic” in approaching cybersecurity, says @SecNielsen #RSAC
.@SecNielsen We must punish cyber assailants. We won’t stand on the sidelines when attackers target the nation. “Those who try to attack our democracy, I have a simple word of warning: don’t!” Asks for industry help to help DHS bolster cybersecurity. #RSAC
.@SecNielsen brings up Russia’s role in election meddling and propaganda campaigns. “We cannot let it happen again.” #RSAC
.@SecNielsen: We need to educate consumers to be more security conscious. Consumers must demand products that are cyber secure. When systems fail, “they fail gracefully.” #RSAC
“We need to rethink the federal role in cybersecurity,” @SecNielsen says. #RSAC
There’s a weakest link problem, everyone is cyber vulnerable. “We’re all on the frontlines of the #cyber battlefield,” says @SecNielsen. #RSAC
.@SecNielsen says many efforts to address systematic risk across government. Asks everyone to help DHS to identify systematic risks #RSAC
Foreign govs are committing cyber crime to fund their  regimes, @SecNielsen says. Digital realm fair game for nefarious activity, these adversaries think. #RSAC
“Digital threats are multiplying faster than we can keep up with,” @SecNielsen says. Last year, half of all Americans’ info was compromised. IoT make lives easier and fun, but easier to attacks us. Hackers today are bolder. #RSAC
.@SecNielsen cyber used to be an IT problem, now it’s a real-time problem for EVERYONE. All sectors targeted. “Cybersecurity is everyone’s problem.” #RSAC
