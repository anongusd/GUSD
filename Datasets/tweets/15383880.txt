Claire McCaskill joins MSNBC, claims to have crossed to the 'other' side and Mika acts like she has an ally against @JoeNBC Republican ways. The BS is too deep.
Mika and Joe S bragging that it is beneath her to watch Gone With the Wind, Wedding Crashers etc is just too much. Bragging that you are above GWTW? C'mon.

@TheDalyPlanet My son's friend died in Theater Shooting. One of those nuts interrupted closing arguments and I believe that's why no Death Penalty.
@JennaFryer JR told TJ to tell someone payback would be hell. Do you know who that was?

@Tark31 I am worried about the SOMEthing.
@sistertoldjah Agreed. The media won't talk about Obama dividing the country but he intentionally did all of this women as victims nonsense.
@GayPatriot Do you or John know any good restaurants or things to do in Charleston or Savannah? Thanks!
@GayPatriot He played right into their hands. He has to make it all about him. I've tweeted more today than in the last year or two. I'm conservative!
@kpcc6s Yes, lol. I am not a liberal but I detest him. He is so humiliating, a liar, delusional, thinks short people suck, ugly people suck etc.
@EdgeofSports @lldubs @lldubs Would you do me a favor &amp; read @BenSasse tweets today? Trump wants to divide us. This is intentional. I am not a liberal.Dislike DT
@th3j35t3r I want someone to check out that crazy ass Doctor that gave him the physical. He doesn't know reality or decency.
@th3j35t3r Very scary! The only good thing is that I was worried that my tweets were federal record. We may not survive that long.
@_KCummings_ Thank you for your trial coverage. Do you know if the jurors spoke to the prosecutors or defense (or even media)? Thanks again!
@BenSasse Trump went to that odd doctor for a reason. Is there a committee that could check that out? Doesn't know truth/lies,lies etc
Exactly. https://t.co/dt2HEoPChD
@realDonaldTrump Public opinion was pro standing for the Anthem. You have made it 'all about you' AGAIN! You changed the momentum against the military. SAD!!
@GeorgeBrauchler I wish that I knew if that jury would have voted DP if that woman hadn't interrupted your closing. The guy from Ohio was known by my family
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Did you get to vacation at Mar-a-Lago like most of the reporters/commentators etc?
@Dawn4Soaptown What is going to happen on GH and leaving/going? What about Jason and Jason? :)
@ananavarro Why has no one checked out DT Dr? He was very odd. DT chose him for a reason. Something is wrong with his offensive lying self
Trump seems incapable of knowing	truth from fiction. Lives in la la land.  Offends everyone. Mueller should check out DT doctor for sure.
Why did Trump have his 'check-up' with the very odd doctor? Mueller needs to check that out b/c DT is hiding a health/mental issue.
@bruu_truu13 I tweeted the Prez that he was a little man for tweeting that. But, on behalf of my Marine friend that came home in body pieces, do better.

Heartbreaking. My thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and the CPD. https://t.co/RrPp3IjMBt
@sallykohn Aurora trial is going on now. The shooter stated that he wanted the glory of knowing that 100 yrs from now that he would be known
@sallykohn One more thing. These shooters want the infamy of mass killing. We should all avoid their name and photo...they want that.
@sallykohn Fox News prime time repeatedly said the guy is racist. They described his patches etc. Why are you giving out wrong information?
@GreggDoyelStar Completed! Thanks
@RidingWithDale It's great to know that you are ok!
@RidingWithDale How are you surviving with all the weather etc? Take care! Thanks for all you do!!!
I thought CNN fired Piers Morgan in large part due to his trolling on Twitter.  Why does Chris Cuomo troll the internet in the same manner?
@megynkelly Cuomo must not like something that you have said because he started tweeting about you again. lol
@ChrisCuomo @WelchDad That response is bs. You stated hate speech was not allowed.
@CBWJazzExaminer My kids in Ohio had the portables and no time to eat. They also didn't receive actual class books. Teachers copied pages.
@thegoldpatrol Thanks. I have been watching as much as possible on Gold Patrol even Spreecast. I was just wanting to FF thru boring parts.:)
@TheGoldPatrol Is there a list of what days the victims testify? I am on the East Coast and I have missed a lot of victim testimony. Thanks
@CBWJazzExaminer Oops. It should've said sorry to hear that.
@CBWJazzExaminer I am sorry to heat that. I went to ER Friday night...herniated disc. xoxo
@CBWJazzExaminer It's great that he is OK.
@CBWJazzExaminer I am so sorry.  Thoughts and prayers.

Why is Trump on @FoxNews so often?  He is on Fox more often than some/most Fox consultants.
@thegoldpatrol Do you know what the Defense Atty meant by objecting due to 'profiling'?
Woohoo! @DaleJr congrats!
@AdamBaldwin They are equally disgusting since Manny is a Pro-Life Christian per HuffPo and TNR
Trump just RT'd someone that has 'only' tweeted him for the past 6 months and they can't spell. Laughing at him or an idiot? Hmmm.
@Slublog One of the media sites had an article about it.  His co-workers don't like it at all.

@jerrywilson_7 Do you remember talking to me in the past? I was just curious what happened?

Christian's do not want to pay for abortions because they don't believe it per their faith.  Obama forces us to pay for it.
The Islamic Extremist Terrorist is ok because that is their faith.  WTH IS this double standard with Obama? They murder us and it's ok?
Liberals are confusing tho. They cut out groups to be Special and they are not subject to any rules.
Liberals live a great life.  They trust that evil people/countries will do good if they are just nice to them.  #LiberalFairyland
WTH. Joe Biden (wrong on every foreign policy decision) was placed in charge of Iraq on Day 1 of Obama? (per @edhenryTV on O'Reilly)
I need the $ 2500 'savings' Obama promised to make up for the extremely high new deductible that we have 'per person'. I am in the red now!
Where is the $ 2500 savings on my insurance policy that Obama promised?  Why aren't the people asking? #Retribution?

trauma a year ago vs a year from now.  Employers (small and large) will be dumping employees by the end of 2015. Ask hospital employees.
the feeder hospitals. This breaks the bank and greatly reduces your chances of surviving Trauma. Thank God my husbands life-threatening
The Level 1 Trauma Center in the greater Cincinnati area (covers S Ohio, N KY, E Indiana) isn't covered by the Gov't Platinum Plan not or
The Oncologist is not in the Platinum Plan either.
It would cost $ 12,000 more than I currently pay. The deductible, prescription costs, co-pay, co-pay max OOP would substantially increase
My OB-GYN not a provider.  It looks like they only cover government Communty Centers and Planned Parenthood excluding regular OB-GYN's.
The Paramedics do not take patients to this 'hospital'. There are major actual hospitals here but the Platinum coverage doesn't cover those
I live in a county of 335,000 people. The only hospital listed is on MY OWN road and I have never heard of this 10 bed surgical facility.
Thank goodness that we haven't been dropped from our insurance YET. The Platinum Plan of our provider is a bad joke.

@jaybusbee in to the Chase when their organization laid down to change the race results. I am a Bowyer fan but that was BS.
@jaybusbee I am not a Gordon fan. MWR crossed the line and cheated him out of his spot in the Chase. The bigger ? is why NASCAR let MWR 1/2
@NASCAR_WXMAN @JeffGordonWeb NASCAR made the correct decision in adding Jeff to the Chase IMO.
@JennaFryer Would Truex have been in the Chase if MWR hadn't cheated? No..but Jeff would have been. I still feel bad for Truex tho..
@lindsayczarniak I feel bad for Truex. He wouldn't have been in if MWR hadn't cheated. Jeff would have been in if MWR/Penske hadn't cheated
@ClaireBLang I agree w/decision. Jeff Gordon was cheated out of being in the Chase. Jeff is not 'my' driver.
@DiecastDude I don't understand why the NASCAR reporters think this is wrong and that MTJ should be in the Chase instead of JG.
@jaketapper My guess is that my DVR will not tape your show as it has in the past. I tape the show..the guide changes later on &amp; won't tape
@JennaFryer Oncologist face pressure. This is unethical. @JeffGordonWeb should be in the Chase. If NASCAR is always rigged then not for me
@JeffGordonWeb I hope that you give your opinion on the new info from RaceHub. They claim to have proof Logano cheated to get in the Chase.

@GOPfashionista  I think Obama implied that the ppl on the right don't care about Syria murdering kids. Did you notice that?
Obama tells nation that people on the right do not care if children are killed. Let's talk about his record on helping born babies survive
@GlennThrush This is the same President that would not vote to give medical care to babies born alive. They were just medical waste.

Obama talks about courage?  The guy is afraid to even invite the first black Senator because he is Republican. Shameful.
@TheFix But he can't work with or 'invite' the first black senator because he is Republican.
@ron_fournier A 'teacher' would have invited the first black Senator even tho he is Republican, would help move forward instead of the same.

There is one thing worse than congress...emergency room doctors.  Bad enough already then add in Obamacare it is a disaster.
Obama is a tax and spend President. He sold out small business and gave tax breaks to large companies so they would comply (SELL OUT).
Obama lied. He did raise the taxes on people making &lt; $ 250k. He is signing a bill that raises your taxes so look at your smaller paycheck.
Does Barack Obama now think the 'Rich' are paying their 'Fair Share' that he 'asked' for?  Is he still going to demonize them?

He is paralyzed now SPECIFICALLY because the HCR law PREVENTED him from being DIAGNOSED. according to at least 5 of his  Doctors.  ObamaTax
A fully capable man was not allowed to be admitted to the hospital and every single Dr said their hands were tied due to Obamacare/Tax
If ObamaTax is so great then why couldn't a Dr admit my Dad to a hospital when he was becoming a quadriplegic?  He was too old to treat???

@KSUpurple I would be surprised if Frank went to USC.  It was like a home game for UK this past year.  It was odd.
@darrenrovell B
@WillieGeist1 Or a funeral?  That was shocking.
@WestCoastGal88 I voted today.  Thanks for the reminder.
@JoeNBC I know that you try.  But this so far (todays eppy) has been non-stop putdowns of every R.   It doesn't look good for your show IMO.
@JoeNBC Will you be back tomorrow? I can't watch this show anymore when most everyone says they think all R's are to be laughed at w/glee.
Another day trip from Ohio to KY/TN border to visit my dad.  Why do we need the time change anyway? It's an unnecessary PITA, IMO.
Life is what it is and it is silly and petty for grown 'well known' men to complain on Twitter about a Danica Patrick interview. #danica
The media always want to talk about Peyton instead of Eli.  It has been that way for years. #danicapatrick
The media wanted to talk about Peyton Manning, not Eli Manning, during Super Bowl week #danicapatrick

@SoapZoneCoggie How was the basketball party?  I've been missing the news, twitter etc.
My elderly dad won't listen.  I am worried sick about his safety and clueless on how to fix it.  This IS worse than having a wild teenager
@dish_answers What account information do you need? Thx
@dish_answers The Picture on TV#1 is much better but TV#2 runs off the dual DVR and it is horrible.  Do you have a fix for that? Thanks
@dish_answers It said "Off Air" but the 2nd one says 480p.  We bought the TV 15 months ago & it had the best picture quality at Best Buy.
@dish_answers Third option is correct but what should the first 2 items say?
@dish_answers I appreciate your response.  Someone from Dish needs to make a service call.  My HD channels are not even close to quality.

@KSUpurple The last time gas prices surged my husband's company had to cut employees, cut pay, etc and the pay cut is still in effect.
@KSUpurple I just paid $ 70 to fill up my Ford Fusion and that has to matter (I hope).   Why Santorum???  :-(
@KSUpurple Santorum seems to be homophobic too.  I think Romney can pull it out if the maps I am looking at in Ohio are right.
@KSUpurple The election needs to be about Obama for the R's to even possibly win.  It won't be if it's anyone but Romney.
@KSUpurple spent the last few months trashing Romney instead of Obama.  Romney's the best of the ones running IMO.
@KSUpurple It is mind boggling to me that Santorum could win Ohio.  The Republicans committed suicide and most conservative bloggers have
@freddoso If you look at the Ohio numbers by county, I don't think Romney can make up that number.

@BillHemmer I want Huntsman to explain his conservative record. #foxnewsdebate @bret_baier
@GPollowitz Did anyone hit 'Like' on that FB post?  I am surprised by how often his 'Like' on death notices.

@Ben_Jones88 IU won a great game against UK Saturday...deservedly so.  But, the out of control after celebration was dangerous IMHO.
@WestCoastGal88 If you see her once, then she looks the same exact way every single time.  Her hair doesn't move.  It's her hair/clothes.
Newt's wife is 45 y/o.  I would have guessed late 50's or early 60's.  Why does she make herself look so old? It has to be on purpose.
@WestCoastGal88 If not Ozzy, then I want Albert.  Hopefully, it's not Coach or Brandon b/c then I would probably just cry. :)
@WestCoastGal88 The contestants lack personality and fun this season....except for Ozzy.
@WestCoastGal88 It makes sense but I hope Ozzy wins.
@WestCoastGal88 It would be awesome!

@SoapZoneCoggie The story with Robin is very sad but the interaction w/her & Jason is incredible but heartbreaking.  #GH
@WestCoastGal88 KY Speedway bought more land for parking. State paid 4 easier access.  ALL contractors pay $$$ penalties if not done 5/12.
@WestCoastGal88 I think that we are receiving Hospitality tix to Ky race again this year.  I will be WISE this time..Driver pictures 4 sure
@WestCoastGal88 I know!  My husband didn't even get it til someone at the table mentioned it.  I'll have to DM you the restaurant name.

@GeoffreyMiller I haven't read their site today but they make me lol.  Comic Sans is BAD.  It was a GREAT game.  IU had the best Fans ever.
@GeoffreyMiller Picking on @KentuckySportsRadio?  You have gone too far now!  ;-)  It was ONE point. IU Won. We lost.  #WeAreUK #BBN
@GPollowitz Stunning that polling has BHO leading Newt and Romney in SC.  I am skeered.
@kilmeade Q for Romney...How does he think he can win when the election is about jobs? His history is killing jobs and mandating HC.
@GoodmanCBS Another thing that was overlooked is the UC players have to earn their way back on the team.
@SethDavisHoops Why didn't you RT @tsnmike article that states ALL of Mick Cronin's requirements for the students to play again?  Be Fair!
@KSUpurple My dad said that Frank actually cursed more than Huggins.   I didn't think it was possible.
@KSUpurple I watched part of the K State and WVU game.  I still like Huggins and Frank was really nice to my dad.  Wanted both to win.
@KSUpurple Tim Tebow has a lot of haters tho.  I feel bad for him.  Congrats on the KState win.
@seg700wlw Seg, It has sucked to be a UC, UK and Bengals fan these last 2 days.
@DanWetzel Well, I could tell you where to watch the game on-line.
@DanWolken tsnmike says he has more details about the suspensions.

@jim_utter Would Kurt have been better off by not going to the banquet?  Or maybe, it didn't matter at that point.
@KSUpurple It appears its LSU Alabama.  T Boone Pickens said that have an investigation if Ok State weren't in it.  Hope he does!!!
RT @DannySheridan1: sorry misunderstd, source said Michigan-VaTech in Sugar NOT K.State.  Ala-LSU rematch set, didn't misunderstand that one
@KSUpurple Hopefully, it's them.  Didn't they just have one bad game after the CBB coaches were killed?
@KSUpurple I agree.  What team should it be in your opinion?  The Ala fans have lobbied for 2 wks that it HAS to be them.  :-)
@KSUpurple I don't think Alabama should be in the title game.  LSU beat them once plus Alabama rested yesterday while LSU played.
@WhitlockJason It should never be joked about.  It's hurtful @ revictimizes victims. Ppl have no idea what victims have to deal with in life
@TheDalyPlanet I agree.  ESPN helping Victim #1 to contact Victim #3 prior to the police was wrong & it could hurt the police case.
@TheDalyPlanet We need PSA's and Educate people (without Fine or Paterno) on child sex abuse.
@TheDalyPlanet Your probably correct.  My issue is that all of this will prevent Fine/Sandusky victims from going forward.
@TheDalyPlanet I missed Rel Sources but I've been following @JasonWhitlock take on the situation (Plus podcast w/Victim 3) What do u think?

@WestCoastGal88 I think they are running late with everything.

@KSUpurple Yeah, I know.  I grew up in a small town.  No privacy about anything.
@KSUpurple I think they all knew as well.  I'm sure their wives knew.  Small towns gossip and I think many outsiders had at least heard it.
@allahpundit I think he had a 100k bail but he didn't have to secure it.  Why isn't he a threat to society tho?  He belongs in jail.

Damn straight. RT @amandacarpenter: Anyone who has been sexually victimized has got to be disgusted watching this scene tonight. #PSU
The Paterno Legend is that he enabled a Child Rapist for at least a decade. That's all that matters.
Unfortunately, I am not surprised at all.  RT @DanWolken: "There should be a new board" WTF, Penn St?
Penn State peeps worried about Paterno SHOULD be thinking about helping ALL of the 10 year old boys that were RAPED.  They need support.
THIS. RT @willbrinson: Are these reporters who sound uber accusatory? Because nothing about this seems press-conference appropriate.
@tubecute88 Good for you!
@greggdoyelcbs Hope you know that he didn't just start w/kids in his mid 50's.  He would have been doing this for decades.  Zero cure rate

@evowoman88 @tbayne21 should admit that he was wrong and not lie about it.  It isn't enough to feel remose. He should tell the truth.
@evowoman88 Then he lied to Jeff's face about it in the garage & blamed it on Ford and Rouch.  Matt, Ford, Rousch all deny ordering it.
@evowoman88 Then he should have said no when Jeff asked & jeff could have found someone else. He didn't tell JG that he was switching either
@dustinlong Is it too late to complete the survey?  Thanks
@DNewtonespn Why proud?  It would have taken @tbayne1 1 second to say "No, I can't push you", then he left JG & then lied to Jeff's face.
Sorry he lied. RT @JeffGordonWeb: Talladega http://t.co/v8yzB2jg -"If somebody is going 2 screw U, you'd lk them 2 say it 2 yr face U know?"

@jtidwell808 Do you think the Colts may actually want to lose the rest of their so they can draft the Luck kid?  (JMO after the NYT article)
@DiecastDude As you know from my FB, this is not a good weekend.  Right now, I think he lied then did the wrong thing, he misled him.
@DiecastDude I haven't heard any comments from him.  Maybe he did but when you give someone your word/they are relying on you that's wrong.
@RyanMcGeeESPN I am with RCR.  It's a shameful way to race and waste fans money.
@jim_utter I am shocked.  I agree with you about @tbayne21.   I didn't think that he would lie tho.
@jeff_gluck Why didn't they red-flag the race? @odsteve
@WestCoastGal88 I hope that @dustinlong asks how fans felt about no red flag in tonights survey.
@88angel Thank you!  I am one of those people that actually like to see the points as they run.

The only jobs that Obama is aware of is road construction. Why not offer tax credits for machine tool purchases, etc? #tcot #teaparty

@PaulAzinger Does he golf too fast tho? Talking about Rickie.  Thanks!
@PaulAzinger What is your opinion of how Rickie Fowler will be as a golfer in 3 years?  He seems to me (outsider) as a nice, solid young man

@KSUpurple My Cincy Bell home service went out lately. They asked for my cell# and I asked if they were selling it/they said yes/I said no.
@KSUpurple Agreed.We had to change our 25 yr old phone# last year b/c  I donated $ to a politician and they sold my number to everyone. :(
@WestCoastGal88 Voted! Thanks
@KSUpurple Agreed.  I also frown on businesses that have automated calling to my phone and you can't speak back.  That's all!  :-)
@davidevertsen That's true.  I'll watch it for the next few races and see who I thinks receives the most coverage.
@davidevertsen It seems ESPN covers a few drivers constantly.  I would just like for them to tell us what position the drivers are in.
@jimmiebjr Thanks!  It's a non-narcotic migraine drug.  I may have to visit Boehner's office re that & light bulbs.
@jimmiebjr  Do you know how I can find out if HHS has new rules re a prescription drug.  I've taken for 10 years , now insurance won't cover

@edhenryTV  The President was attending a Private, Respectful Ceremony at Dover?  IMO, this photo is insulting.  http://flic.kr/p/abzLKZ
