@Delta But it’s evident that they don’t want to deal with this: I was directed to that “customer service” phone area - and calls from there or my own phone went unanswered or the feedback was circular.
@Delta All this said, and though I really do hope you address that issue, I do want to commend you for allowing service members to board first.
@Delta But this was your customer service desk at the time and no one on the phone said they could help. Regardless - how would @Delta have fixed this problem? Look: pitching a hotel sale to people stuck due to interrupted travel is bad customer service. https://t.co/z8JOkAzCFH

A @delta story for you. I hung up after five minutes and decided it would be better to send a @bbb_us complaint. Which is too bad because @delta is otherwise alright in an industry that is quickly getting awfully close to the second oldest profession.
I took that picture of the @delta customer service desk after another passenger hung up after being on hold for 20 minutes or more.
I arrive at @delta customer service at gate D11. This is it: https://t.co/8r6ECmlaEB
So I go to Atlanta gate D16. The @Delta agent tells me that customer service is at gate D11.
The lady calls back 57 minutes later. I let her know why I don’t appreciate a sales pitch for whatever partnership @Delta has with Howard Johnson. She tells me she is “not trained” to deal with this problem. She says I must talk to @Delta at the airport.
So I call @Delta customer service and the greeting says the wait is 57 minutes so I select to get a call back.
