THE DAILY SHOW meets THE NEWSROOM tonight. Bravo, John Oliver.
Yes, enjoyed GGs last night. Regardless of who makes a speech, in the end it's a celebration of a lot of great work by a lot of artists.
Ran into SF Giants fan @jheil today. His berating of my Detroit Tigers continues without mercy. I want cold blooded revenge.

Two Scenarios: Bats wake up and Max &amp; JV pull us back to 3-2, we steal Game 6 and force an "anything can happen" Game 7. Or we get swept.
Tweet-less conditions at Stadium. 43,000 cell phones jamming it up. Going to Game 4 tonight. Bringing my bat in case I'm needed. Which I am.

Okay. Let's Role Play. We'll be the Cardinals and you pretend you're the Nationals. It's the 9th inning of the final game...
Yes, Tim. The Giants have done so much right over the last 5 games. And we've done everything wrong for two. And done it very, very well.
"Reach and hope"...and hit it. #stillonedge
Tacos For America.
Make that 9th Inning Vengeance... #stillonedge
That's two hits on our heads. No mercy! Cue 8th Inning Vengeance!
And it...stays...fair. Now they're "making their breaks."
Foul. Not a DP. Yup. Exactly.
0-0. Two great SP WS outings. The only thing Baumgardner's not done that Fister has is pitch after being hit in the head. Great game, Doug.
@kevinpollak Panda's cardio-less fitness program is OBVIOUSLY WORKING FOR HIM SO DON'T SAY IT!! #stillonedge
"7. Shutout. Innings." Just. Like. Fister. #stillonedge
Toothless.
Way low, SFers.
3-4-5. Right the hell now.
Doug Fister now has permission to father my next child.
Thanks, Kenny. What kind of BBQ? #stillonedge
This Just In: Panda hits single because he doesn't do cardio.
McCarver: "These umpires are honed in." Cut to five shots of umps standing there like they're all waiting for Bingo to start.

Brad Pitt's Chanel No. 5 commercial is on again and I haven't showered today.
Dear God: Please arrange @kevinpollak to feel some of my pain. Amen.
12.00 ERA in playoffs, hasn't pitched in months, and now he's Koufax. Yeah, I'm on edge. About to throw something. Like the dog.
Thanks for the college football update...
Okay. I'm over the team greatness testimonials from the dugout.
Time for McCarty&amp;Lemieux. Don't know it? Google it. Hint: Prince HBP and Fister hit in head.
Can he still feel his hand?
My wife just yelled at the TV, "Someone do something!"
Less enamored with the non-DH thing.
Tiger GM Dave Dombrowski seen on his phone activating Al Kaline.
Right now, I am a big fan of the N.L. not having a DH.
Squeezed.
Unbelievable. And he stays in. That hurt me.
"Fister looks good," he said, with not quite 3 outs yet.
Love all the first timers SCREAMING...at a routine fly ball to CF. Was @kevinpollak one of them?
Had to be a perfect cut off throw. And was.
A game changing play that almost was.
Baumgardner lives to see another day when Prince decides not to charge the mound.
Panda makes an out proving he's human for a bear.
Scutaro is one 0-5 game away from being nicknamed Scooter.
Sit down, Mr. Intensity.

Breaking News: Tonight's Giants-Tigers game will be played without a third base bag.
@kevinpollak @SFGiants @MLB No Way, San Jose. 1-1 and bringin' it back to the D.
Yes, I will be chirpin' my Tigers to a Game 2 Win or - with all due respect to Mail Carriers everywhere - be going postal.
If you want me, I'll be having a nightmare about a Panda.
Wait! 8-3! Paging Al Gore! Retracting my concession!
Congrats to @kevinpollak and all of SF on your Game 1 Win. I couldn't possibly be any happier for you than I could possibly be
8-1. For the Tigers, this makes Game 2 a plus size.
This looks like the team that trailed the White Sox all year.
If @kevinpollak isn't hammered by now, I'm gonna start drinking for him.
And the dog just kicked me.
7-1. Valverde is getting hit, my wife's swearing like a sailor, and that bear is up again.
It's come to this: when Sandoval arrives in Detroit for Games 3&amp;4, he'll be met at the airport by the guys who know where Hoffa's buried.
Papa Grande's pitching. I'm wide awake. Knee jerk reaction.
GBA nicely rendered.
Did I mention we swept the Yankees?
Springsteen underneath Thursday's Probables. That helps.
Now they're just loins.
That stirring in my loins is hope. 6-1.
I see us coming back if we hit and Bochy decides to sit The Bear.
S^2C well done.
Where's that rain now...?
I just vomited.
To change my mojo, I am now wearing Chanel No. 5
All right I'm back. Oh, look. Zito not only hits like Mays, he's throwing like Marichal.
JV yanked. I'm switching to the Debate.
@kevinpollak Yes, Zito's RBI and the Kardashians having more children.
Cy Young just rolled over in his grave.
@kevinpollak Six jokes MLB won't approve just went through my head, but, of course, "Kate Upton" explains it. Quick. Tweet McCarver.
We HAVE been on base every inning which isn't the same as scoring but it's all I got right now.
Down 4-0 in the 3rd. JV rocked by a bear. I went to kick the dog and he bit me.
@jheil Obviously, this is not actually happening.
Was it something Pitching Coach Jeff Jones said?
I'll never go to a zoo again.
"What are you doing out here?" is the clean version.
Somewhere, Raul Ibanez is nodding.
Twice...
3-2 hit this smoke. Fouls it off.
Really. Off the actual third base itself? Wait, in a good sportsmanship gesture, Bochy apologies and asks to not count it.
Hmm. A Closeup of Zito talking to himself. There's hope.
Joe, it does sound like sucking up. Get back behind your podium.
He caught Cabby's liner but I still see it bouncing past him all the way to the wall and here comes Jackson around 3B...oh, never mind.
Hang something, Zito.
@jheil Just trying to time his BP Fastball.
I don't want to say I'm in a panic, but if I don't get a baserunner ASAP I'm going to eat my couch.
I just saw Brad Pitt's Chanel No. 5 commercial while wearing Brut.
For a 1st AB in a WS, I'm just glad Garcia didn't run it out to 3B...
@jheil Panda hit that into Nevada.
Sandoval hit a pitcher's pitch that I believe bounced off the Golden Gate Bridge. Still only counts as 1 Run.
Boom. Powie. Ouch.
Don't review that!!
His curve just dropped off the table. No, cliff.
JV opens with 5 FBs.
And exhale.
Delmon can hurt your feelings.
Good pitch on 3-2
Omar. Now up: best hitter Al Kaline's ever seen.
CF's ball...hmm.
"Steal one base, everyone in America gets a free taco." Okay, I have now heard everything.
Had the A.L. won the All Star Game, Games 1&amp;2 would be in Detroit where we are basking in Indian Summer. Weekend Forecast? Um, not that...
Avisail "5 Tools" Garcia starting in RF. Only Tiger who looked like he might trip over top dugout step during Intros = we look relaxed.
Okay. I'm sorry, but Joe Buck is on the field behind a podium on a platform like he's the Keynote Speaker at your local Rotary Club.
Note to SF fans considering traveling to Detroit for Games 3 &amp; 4: Leave the Panda Land Thing behind.
@jheil It be on.
Glued to MLB Network. Fascinated by Leyland hitting grounders. He looks focused. Nice, easy swing. Pinch hitting option.
Okay. Then make your brother do it. He's coat tailin'.
If Kevin Pollak were a true Giants Fan, he would walk over and kiss Willie McCovey right on the lips. Show your SF love, KP!

Craig Ferguson is delightfully insane, flat out funny, smart as hell, and instantly feels like a friend. That said, he should be committed.

The Detroit Tigers open their Grapefruit League Schedule today vs. the Atlanta Braves. A Must Win.
Check out Jack White on SNL this week with MI's own Dominic John on Bass from one of my favorite bands of pure musicians, STEPPIN' IN IT.
Just like in a Hitchcock film, Twitter is where you can be followed while you're following someone else.
RT @PGATOUR: Tiger Woods in red numbers after a birdie on No. 10, where he hit it to inside 3 feet from 185 yards to get to 1 under.
@umjazzfiddle Your Profile photo is a classic.
@AliMann22 That's right. I twit.

@NellieDaniels When we both were mere children.
@umjazzfiddle Just shot SUNSHINE in front of 30 "party goers" & cast. Think GRAPEVINE only standing. Oh, well, it's just a career...
@NellieDaniels Try JEREMIAH JOHNSON. A heart warming tale about a wanderer lost in the Rockies, chased by Indians, and left for dead.
Also loving new Carolina Chocolate Drops CD, LEAVING EDEN.
@LyleLovett Love RELEASE ME.
Look for a surprising new acoustic guitar model from C.F. Martin & Co. sometime this Spring/Early Summer. Hint: Not since Gene Autry...
@NellieDaniels @official_tigers I'm on it like Blade on a bed.
No doubts re: Miggy @ 3B. His improved and at times Inge-esque glove work at 1B in '11 was proof.
