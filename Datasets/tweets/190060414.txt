There is a notion that only the rich can adopt. It just isn't true. The truth is that the issue isn't about money. It is about convincing women with unplanned pregnancies that their baby deserves a chance. There are thousands of families with the money to adopt.
Technically, the government funds foster families with WIC, Medicaid, etc and then adoptions are usually very low cost. There is a $13,810 tax credit for adoptions. The problem isn't with funding. It is with willing families saying yes. https://t.co/NSfPXM9YmY

I've seen generations serve together. Parents and kids, siblings, etc. It can be a great way to serve your country and your local community. Happy birthday National Guard!
One of the most important benefits of national guard units is that many people stay in the same unit for years. Active Duty changes stations every few years but many people stay in the same guard units for their entire career.
The National Guard was established in 1636 as citizen soldiers and continues today with evolving mission sets like UAVs and cyber security.
Guard units deploy worldwide and possibly down the street in times of disaster. Some guard members are full time but most have civilian careers.
Guard units both army and air may do exercises with these countries and develop relationships that last years. Guard units also support other active duty exercises and state readiness exercises.
In honor of the #nationalguard birthday, here's some stuff you may not know: Each state has a nation around the world they partner with. This program promotes stability and interoperability. https://t.co/OOG5FF30CA
