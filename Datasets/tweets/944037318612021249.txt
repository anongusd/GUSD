When I finally snap and take a hammer to this computer in a fit of math induced rage, can I write off the purchase of a new one on my taxes? #newtaxlaws #justcurious

@AnnaKendrick47 Is he your hero?
@whineandpopcorn @AnnaKendrick47 Fucking same!
Getting rid of net neutrality is allowing big business to strangle out small businesses so no one can see their content. You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or an economist) to know that small businesses are the backbone of our economy, what harms them, harms our economy.
@realDonaldTrump Sorry @StephenAtHome guess you didn't make the cut.
All I know is that Patrick Heatly and I both have great hair. #GoogleArts https://t.co/tbediw3NVW
This guy in my communications class, during his speech, said that his relationship with his service dog was marital in nature. Ummm....
If big brother really is watching he's probably confused. Given my proclivities, there's really no reason I should be googling creamy meat pocket.
Me: Sees everyone else rushing to complete their pre lab that was due at the very beginning of class.	Me: Adjusts my lab sheet so the professor can see I already did it. 		#teacherspet
Almond milk has officially ruined cereal for me.
I would recommend that any college student ask their parents to get them a @Costco card for Christmas. When you're broke you can buy your instant noodles in bulk and have the added benefit of supplementing your diet with free samples.
Studying in the library between classes, just saw a girl get overly frustrated trying to open a banana. Don't worry girl we're all on the same page. #winterterm #unforgivingprofessors #lbcc
I certainly hope so, I haven't had dairy in 5 days. This process is reminding me of when I quit smoking. https://t.co/xdagePiO62
@jk_rowling I can't take all these rumors! Is Netflix going to be doing Harry Potter in 2020?!? Please put my mind at ease so I can go back to my studies!
I haven't drank anything besides water and coffee this year. I've been to the doctor to get a checkup. I'm currently planning a road trip to Canada, and I've exercised everyday of 2018. #2018 #slowlybutsurely #motivateme

The heart of my hometown is best experienced from the mountain tops surrounding it. @Express_Medical https://t.co/7XRecRojSt
@realDonaldTrump You're one to talk about the squandering of a countries wealth. Hope you're enjoying your golf games.
Story of my life lol https://t.co/zbQBnaDKm8
@realDonaldTrump I can't even right now. You need to Google climate change, because you obviously don't understand it.
@selfmusing_ Quitting smoking was hands down the hardest thing I've ever done. Once you have done it though, you get the sense that anything is possible. I'm all about self improvement now, since I know anything is possible with enough detirmination.
@CocaCola @waketowear I shared a coke with my truck the other day, cleaned the battery terminals right up!
If anyone needs me, I'll be off in search of beauty and adventure  https://t.co/vZiZRPP8dy
It's not that bad! Making a difference this Wednesday! Starting the new years off with a donation! @RedCross https://t.co/oOtO97DiJy
I see a nap in my near future. It doesn't take very long, and it's a great way to start out the new year. #makeadonation @RedCross https://t.co/ZLJ510lSLW
2016 saw the end of my smoking. 2017 saw the end of my drinking, and my enrollment in college. 2018 is my year for a healthier happier me. https://t.co/PHyCJktDPz
My school shopping is complete! All set for winter term. Now all I need is to get my gear for another Alaskan Summer adventure and I'm set! #lbcc #businessmajor #winterterm #alaskansummer #salmonrun #salmonprocessing #agirlwithaplan
@JetDivots @SenJeffMerkley 45 in Albany. Glad to hear we aren't the only ones skipping all that.
@14truth @SenJeffMerkley How about snow is white and night is black, so what is the point of pretending otherwise?
@timkaine Tarot cards? Oh no.... HE'S A WITCH!!!
@CoryBooker This imteraction has definitely put you on my radar. The democrats need a rally point. I will be researching and finding out more about if you plan on running. I am a moderate, but my state forces me to choose. My views align closer with the left, so I'm registered as a Democrat.
It's Christmas morning 2017, I have snuck downstairs to play the Sega genesis before my brother can. It feels like the 90s up in here. #timemachine #nerdcity #blastfromthepast
@realDonaldTrump Doug Jones already did.
@poe_flyboy *Rey and I
@JohnPaul_USA @realDonaldTrump Why because Russia will make it happen?
@realDonaldTrump Are you going to call fox news, fake news now too??? https://t.co/ZWGNxRAOj1
@heartdraco @jk_rowling @EmmaWatson @lumos I find it rather repulsive that you are commenting on a thread about starving Haitian children about your pool.
@TDP312 @Oregonian @TheWalkingDead Sadly, that is most places you go. Especially the big cities. Seattle is a lot worse. Drugs are a big problem in our country in general.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump I'm talking to Ron not emperor dumpus.
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump I've been rather impressed with you during this investigation. You'll have my vote when the time comes.
@RepKevinBrady @realDonaldTrump Why does your head remind me of a penis?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Doesn't matter if you build a wall. People will still tunnel under it. Some might even tunnel under it just to spite emperor dumpus
@TDP312 @Oregonian Have you ever even been to Portland? I would hardly call it the whitest city in America.
I met the nicest cat in the @Walmart parking lot today.
@KelseaBallerini @amazonprimenow Thank you Amazon prime for making sure my toy suitcase is full of "back massagers". They help me stay calm during the stressful holiday season!
@realDonaldTrump This just in! The sun is bright!
@TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump What does it matter?
@RepMcKinley Nobody wants him to fail, it's just hard to ignore the glaringly obvious signs that he's going to. Merry Christmas to you and the other bags of garbage running our country.
@Talkietina7 @TMobile Amen sister.
@TMobile A bunch of my friends were considering this offer. I gave them all my Netflix password sent them to @verizon
@TMobileHelp @JohnLegere That was ten years ago, your slutty money will not bridge the chasm between us.
@JohnLegere 10 years ago I was in the Army living in Kansas. I wanted something that would work there and at home. I knew @verizon would, but your deals were better at the time. I was assured that it would be refunded if not. When it didnt, I was refused a refund. I will never forgive you.
RT @marwilliamson: Only when we have looked darkness clearly in the eye does the light behind it begin to appear.
@_Justin_T_A I agree 100% if you're not willing to try an d change it, I don't want to hear about it.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you're unhappy then vote. If you don't agree vote. Don't belly ache if you don't exercise your right to VOTE. https://t.co/FsklbYWWf1
@_Justin_T_A Some things you just can't ignore.
The only good thing to come out of last year is that I suddenly am concerned enough to follow politics.
@_Justin_T_A @SenFeinstein @mrswhiteraven @GOP They only care about unborn children. After birth they can be forced to suffer with the rest of us. Sad thing is children haven't done anything to deserve the suffering yet.
