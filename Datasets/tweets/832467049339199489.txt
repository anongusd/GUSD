@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Cohen admitted to working with Russian government officials on a real estate deal for Trump, and doing so well into the presidential campaign. Cohen also admitted to briefing Trump and his family repeatedly about the status of the Trump Tower Moscow project. -Feinstein
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Applied
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats That‚Äôs a statement taken out of context and you know it. Also adversely applies in this case....ü§®
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Typically, yes, if the DA agrees to a plea deal, the court will USUALLY go for it....true
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats It is completed‚Äîbut the entire premise of it was FRAUD.....I mean the university itself-it was to defraud all of its paying customers.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Trump literally is defined as Deceit.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I mean, cmon, trump university...hahaha
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Of all people in the world, trump@is the person who will divert responsibility, avoid blame and consistently lie, throwing anyone under the bus he needs too....so consider the source(s). Cohen vs trump...I‚Äôd trust the tapes.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I‚Äôm not quite sure it works like that....I certainly don‚Äôt believe that many courts will lessen a mandatory minimum without due process when it comes to dealing with a proven criminal....especially when the He in this case happens to be Trump - though he is a proven habitual liar
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I also believe that criminals often have to change everything about their lives to find success, and that once out of the system, success or lasting change can only be attained by the cognizant person-which means considering those you have offended + taking pure choice to change
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Other than just ‚Äúserving their time‚Äù or jumping through the hoops. I believe that people can change and criminals can reform themselves. Granted‚Äînot all court programs are by any means perfect nor without due reform, but, severe consequences demand severe practice of rehab..
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Now, I do believe in the system...if people would put efforts into realizing the nature as well as the effect of their crimes, more people might take penalization (jail) as well as rehabilitation efforts and resources offered by the system with more sincerity ...
@kaosum @btwoodward @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I said 8000. My mistake....as of Sept 13, the number was just 5000. My bad.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Shell
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Paying off people, she‚Äôll corporations to hide the nature of funds, etc
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Cohen wasn‚Äôt facing a 5-10 yr sentence...he, like Manafort will or would have likely died in jail....imo
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Further, I believe the implementation and severity of penalties for financial and politically driven crimes should be enhanced. White collar crime often has far more victims‚Äî-I say that with no intention of minimizing any victim, violent related or not.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats But when it comes to politics and financial crimes‚Äîwithout plea deals, the corruption and especially the willingness to enter into shady agreements would be with far less fear of being caught I suppose.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I agree when it comes to violent crimes, plea deals should be illegal without vast amounts of info which protects the public, ie- El Chapo....
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats But, the tapes are not He said -he said....they are fairly concrete-I suppose if some are vague, one could claim interpreted misunderstanding or miscommunication, but tapes are tapes......Lordy, I hope there are tapes.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Hmmmm......there‚Äôs just too many types of plea deal to fully agree or disagree....that‚Äôs very broad.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats But....trumpndidnt divest himself either-this only further opens himself to the leverage of business dealings or blatant pay to play- Trump International for one...trump Tower and Mar a Lago for others....
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats No...that‚Äôs not what I meant. Business deals can transcend years.
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats A favorite movie. But not really comparable....I see your point, but without public divulgence of Cohens known taped conversations, there is only one or two known direct orders from trump to Cohen‚ÄîI believe it is fair to assume there are more or the agreed path of illegality
@btwoodward @kaosum @dutch5163 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats He was the head of the FBI.....but what‚Äôs your point?

@Steveinist @RigatoniMeatbal @willjones8210 @KristieLyon @h8Wankmaggot45 @CoffeeL48396139 I could use a lazy boy‚Äîhaven‚Äôt slept in a bed in 4 years due to nerve and joint issues- the floor sucks, the couch is better, but a lazy boy is almost perfect. Maybe it‚Äôs only only money to you‚Äîit‚Äôs not to the candidates your votes condemned. You threw your voice down the drain.
@Steveinist @RigatoniMeatbal @KristieLyon @h8Wankmaggot45 @CoffeeL48396139 You‚Äôre missing the point entirely. If even ONE green candidate had won tonight, I‚Äôd say you were onto something....but nope. Not one. So your point above (which is without merit, relevance, or specificity and instead just theoretically based on truth) STILL DOESNT GET CHANGED.
@willjones8210 @Steveinist @RigatoniMeatbal @KristieLyon @h8Wankmaggot45 @CoffeeL48396139 And frankly‚Äîhas the green votes been blue votes‚Äî-THE DEMS WOULD HAVE WON THE SEAT.....so no, they‚Äôre not half votes.
@SharonCoryell3 @TrumpEra_2017 @leeleeb50 #DonaldTrumpOverdrive begins in T-minus 3hours.....division and fear mongering misogyny combined with threats of war and terrorism while blowing more whistles and blaming everybody but those responsible.....sooooo, basic narcissism carries on.
