@NeilPer25396830 @LoriTrahanMA Where the GOP Senate refuses to take up their own bill, put forward by Mitch McConnell and voted for by every Republican on the first pass. As far as Trump campaign promise wasn’t Mexico paying part of the promise? Por Favor!
@NeilPer25396830 @LoriTrahanMA Sorry Neil. Just like the Senate bill that Trump had signed off on (100-0 bipartisan compromise)the offer of $1.6b was made by Administration, and then pulled back by Trump. The original REPUBLICAN bill has been sent back to Senate by House....
@NeilPer25396830 @LoriTrahanMA There was a compromise. The Senate voted 100-0 to move an appropriation bill to keep government open. That was a bipartisan compromise. Then Trump changed his mind and announced he was closing government. And the Dems are responsible for that? Please.
@NeilPer25396830 @LoriTrahanMA No, both parties are not to blame. The President told us that he would shut it down proudly. He has done just that. Refusing to open government until the other party gives you what you want is not governance, it is hostage taking. And that is a recklessly low standard.
