Ahwazis ask  the United Nations, the international  community &amp; human rights orgs. to condemn the arbitrary arrests in Ahwaz. More than 600 Ahwazis are detained, including political &amp; cultural activists  plus a number of women &amp;ordinary citizens.#Free600AhwaziDetainees https://t.co/05h2L8wv6G
Ahwaz sees  arbitrary arrests and crackdown .  Iran's regime denying  Ahwazi prisoners' basic  rights, like making phone calls, receiving visitors, and accessing adequate medical care.  we ask netizens to support  hundreds of Ahwazi political prisoners.  #Free600AhwaziDetainees https://t.co/wuNkDMdrlX
Iranian regime sees Ahwazis as sub-humans  based on their  ethnicity &amp; desire for freedom. Ahwazi daily life is tainted by racism . Any Arab requesting equality, freedom  is  marked an enemy of the state.  Ahwaz is  a giant prison – an Orwellian hell. #Free600AhwaziDetainees https://t.co/RU863awk4D
Due to  security environment in Ahwaz, with ongoing threats 2  families of Ahwazi  prisoners &amp;  accompaniment of  heavily censored Persian media , the blackout on abuses inflicted upon Ahwazis has become an excuse 2 Iranian rights orgs to ignore Ahwazis. #Free600AhwaziDetainees https://t.co/WK3FXL1O4s
#Humanrightswatch &amp; #Amnestyinternational organisation 2 show  their honorable position in defense of  Ahwazi political  &amp;cultural prisoners.They  should support the rights &amp; freedoms of Ahwazis esp Ahwazi prisoners under oppression&amp; discrimination. #Free600AhwaziDetainees. https://t.co/nQ2Ks63aFe

@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library we call on the US, the other policymakers to listen to the voices, demands of Arab people of Ahwaz and not to confine dialogue to the Persian forces , their allies unless they recognize the legitimate rights of other non-Persian peoples, eps the right of self-determination.
@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library The Arab people of Ahwaz and the other non-Persian people have lost confidence in the Persian opposition forces who are only concerned about toppling the regime and installing a government of a sectarian and ultra-nationalist nature.
@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library This comes after the regime stole the Ahwazis' waters by diverting courses of rivers to the other cities where Persian people are settling. This chauvinist policy is aimed at uprooting the Arab people of Ahwaz.
@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library These crimes have recently triggered protests in the Arab region of Ahwaz, who protested against the severe water pollution and the people's inability to get access to healthy drinking water.
@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library Your Excellency US secretary of state #MikePompeo	  There a single passing day without seeing a crime being committed against the activists of non-Persian peoples in Iran. The regime has always been devising ways to humiliate the people and restrict freedoms.
@SecPompeo @Reagan_Library Your Excellency US secretary of state #MikePompeo		As you surely know, crimes of the Iranian regime against the non-Persian peoples, the regional countries and even the interests of other countries have never stopped since this terrorist regime seized power in 1979.
