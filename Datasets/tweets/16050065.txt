Islamophobes and Republicans parse every word you say, use more precision and say exactly what you mean.
Talk about anti-Semitic! Anyway, they have more influence. And it's not dual loyalty, it's cowardice in the face of pressure from Evangelicals &amp; AIPAC, focus on lobbyists, not the group as a whole. Many Jews do not support Israeli policy. You know that. Express yourself with care
I remember walking out of church in college when the pastor told us during the sermon that we must support Israel not as she is, but Greater Israel, when she takes ownership of all her historical territory and the Jews all return because Jesus will return and cast them into hell
Dear @IlhanMN, your criticism of Israel having too much and detrimental influence on US policy is correct, but before criticizing Jews, you should criticize the more powerful lobby, the Evangelicals who push for complete obeisance to Israel's policies in search of The Rapture

Who is a reporter who covers hinky campaign finance stuff?
Because Shaun King is associated with this and his ethics are dubious at best, it seems likely they plant to use this money for IE for Bernie. It makes no sense they would be banking it all otherwise.
They could do public education and lobbying for accountability, add their endorsements, and not have the reporting requirements of a PAC. Also, thre is no need for a FEDERAL PAC for LOCAL races. It does not relieve them of local reporting requirements of independent expenditures.
They made endorsements, but didn't spend money. And why do they need a federal PAC for local elections? Shouldn't they be a c4, which is allowed to do electioneering so long as it's not their main focus? As a c4, they could endorse.
And I know I may seem like a broken record talking about the need for local action to tackle bad prosecutors, but to find an organization raising $3.6 million for that effort and banking it for unknown reasons is bizarre.	https://t.co/15SOJ1DnyI
Surely someone somewhere in the entire country was worthy of their support. I know for damn sure there were plenty worthy of removal. So why did they do nothing but collect money?
and I am puzzled how an organization dedicated to "Elect prosecutors who will fix our broken criminal justice system." spent not one dime in the last election. They now are an unauthorized PAC because misc PACs must donate to a minimum number of candidates https://t.co/Ywd6wlqhNF
that will look at their plea offers to white vs. Black defendants, who will look at how they stack up charges and look at their differential treatment. No factor in our justice system is more responsible for racial disparity &amp; over-incarceration, BUT I looked at their FEC report
I went to the website of @RealJusticePAC and it is about exactly the problem I have been talking about for ages. We need to "elect prosecutors who will fix our broken criminal justice system." We need a system of accountability that will track prosecutors &amp; hold them accountable
@bbond @RealJusticePAC @Mayor_Steinberg RealJustice PAC had $3.6 million and sat this one out.
@RealJusticePAC Why didn't you support a challenge to Sacramento DA? You had $3.6 million. What are you saving it for? If you're trying to figure out how to cash in on it, just form an LLC and pay it for consulting. https://t.co/SkgCNZ3G3f
@RealJusticePAC @OsopePatrisse How come you raised $3.6 million for the 2018 campaign cycle and didn't spend any of it? Are you saving it to do independent expenditures for Bernie? Do your donors know you are now an unauthorized PAC because you failed to meet minimum expenditures?
@RealJusticePAC Why didn't you spend one dime on campaigns in 2018? You had over $3 million and not one candidate seemed like a good choice to support for real justice?
Remember, Bernie benefited from lots of PAC spending in 2016, from Rose DeMoro's group, from Republicans. Is that the plan again? This reeks.
Such as why did they raise over $3 million for the 2018 election and not spend a penny? This makes them an unauthorized PAC as they are required to spend. Did they save this to make independent expenditures for Bernie? https://t.co/IQ2F8ShXzn
who employ him would continue to employ someone with so little integrity as misrepresenting photos, but I see he writes for the Intercept where ethics are frowned upon. But speaking of ethics, as co-founder of Real Justice PAC, perhaps he could answer some questions.

Bernie on the day he announced said not to vote for someone because they are a woman, a person of color or LGBTIQ. He never once said don't vote for someone because they're a man or white.

@BernieSanders You said you never voted until you were 40, you liar.
I was poor, but grew up with no idea golfing was for rich people. Oh, I forgot, the town built tennis courts too.
If you don't understand what I am talking about, think of the good bills and real legislation that someone effective could have done in place of Bernie these 30 years.
So the district drifts rightward...
But Petersen nearly lost to a REpublican because he's a nonentity.
The town where I went to high school owned a radio station, an airport, a golf course, a swimming pool, and any other amenity no small town could support as a private enterprise. The local municipal and city-owned power, garbage, etc paid for local government include 2 cops.
MN7 is as close to social democracy as it gets. Most towns own the utilities or they are co-ops. That includes the telephone co-op. In some towns, even Cable is a co-op or run by the town. People get checks back at the end of the year
I didn't think the D who replaced him, Mike Kopetski was anyone to write home about. And the guy who replaced Stangeland is a DINO, Collin Petersen. Petersen is the best evidence that bad representatives ruin districts.
I lived for a time in OR-5. Denny Smith, could not wrap his head around the idea that if taxes pay for health care, you don't have to pay health insurance premiums. He could not grasp it. He would say "They go down?"
I had the experience of being represented by incompetents twice in my life. In MN's 7th, I had Arlen Stangeland who named post offices &amp; introduced a bill to fund flame-throwing ships to melt the ice on Lake Superior for year-round shipping.
I have no problem with primarying Democrats in safe districts (REALLY SAFE) because there is an opportunity cost to having an incompetent. I know it seems fine they vote the way they should, but all the things a competent legislator could do are lost.

@TheObamanista I got mad at Bernie in 2009-10 - his anti-Obama stuff was ridiculous, including joining in with Ed Schultz and Michael Moore in the punish Democrats in the mid-terms bullshit.
@TheObamanista Incidentally, a lot of people admire Sen Wyden but he was the senator who circulated the secret "Dear Colleague" letter asking people to sign to oppose the single-payer option. But it could have been added later.
@TheObamanista Then, working to pass the Health Security Act, Bernie was among those who worked to kill it. I thought, along with many others, that it was imperfect, but something that would allow evolution to single (50) payer over time as it originally allowed for single payer state options.
@TheObamanista He did not give details because he was ethical, but when I offered to try to find him something else, he was adamant that he would never work for another politician ever again. Too bad, because not all are bad bosses.

@SomeGirlinSoCal @LisaTalmadge But all of you, from Shaun King to you, are telling people to listen to you, not Bernie. Bernie is the one saying abortion rights are a distraction from the "important issues" and don't vote for people who are representative of marginalized Americans, vote for my and my ideas.
@SomeGirlinSoCal @LisaTalmadge Bernie's entire argument is CLASS matters and identity politics is a loser, so why are you trying to pretend he has some human rights agenda. He doesn't. He is about economic justice, good for him. I think that is the wrong approach.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones I am not going to provide you links to all the times Sanders has mocked  human rights as identity politics and mocked candidates who are women, gay, or of color as saying vote for me I'm X. There are too many instances to bother, and pretending you don't know is bad faith
@SomeGirlinSoCal @LisaTalmadge She sponsored 2 civil rights bills in 8 years, he did 0 in 30. 	Give it up. He is not interested in Civil Rights. He had a brief foray in thee 60s and decided it was not for him. Lost all interest.
@SomeGirlinSoCal Yeah, go check @LisaTalmadge who has all the receipts on who is the real ally on gay rights. There is a reason Hillary was endorsed by the gay rights organizaitons and it's because she led. Do I have to track down the marriage is a man/woman proclamation he signed?
@SomeGirlinSoCal Way to miss the point, but it shows you are not looking at the issue of racial justice seriously. Just like you think passing a bunch of VA amendment proves something while he does nothing on racial justice.

@Johnsmith_sr @Head_Sanford @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe And yes, there are many Black people in the South but the money goes to the county for economic investment. How much do you think will go to invest in Black business development?
@Johnsmith_sr @Head_Sanford @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe But then he said, instead of reparations, he supports Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan which he presents as the realistic form. Here is where he 10-20-30 money would go based the American Community Survey. So, a plan he proffers as reparations-lite is mostly for white people https://t.co/A8Gs8VugHk
@Johnsmith_sr @Head_Sanford @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe Reparations is a great issue to see how fundamentally Sanders fails to see Black Americans. He sees reparations as some poverty program as though every Black person in America is hovering near the poverty line which is one reason while he fails to see them as working/middle class
@SomeGirlinSoCal Reading can be very hard if you do not understand the topic is Civil Rights. I already pulled his list of 5 bills into law as a co-sponsor (not a sponsor), not one pertaining to African American issues, by the way.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones opposed to women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, or trans rights but because he just doesn't care enough to advocate or lead.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones That is absolutely not true. For example, look at Bernie. He is not to the left of run of the mill Democrats.

@Johnsmith_sr @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe As to neoliberal, that just exposes you don't know your terms.
@Johnsmith_sr @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe There are not enough anti-racist whites. There are anti-racist whites so long as they feel no pinch. If some black person gets a job they want, let's see how anti-racist they are. Also, have you seen the resurgence of white nationalism?
@Johnsmith_sr @nhannahjones @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe See, nobody is saying MLK left class issues behind or moved on from class. Other than Republicans, most acknowledge he was anti-Vietnam War, pro-economic justice and pro-Civil Rights. But you're saying he left civil rights behind.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones For example, working for universal health care is great, but include in the framing the need to address disparate outcomes, to require transparency in treatment and outcomes by race, etc. Access to health care is not as transformative if the health care kills you for being black
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones I have no objection to working on economic justice, but it should never be pursued without a racial justice framing. Since racism cannot be legislated away, every issue should be pursued within the racial justice frame to ensure policy does not exacerbate racial inequality
RT @nhannahjones: @Cajsa @Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe Yeah, that whole argument is ludicrous. In his last months alive he…
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones You have repeatedly claimed MLK "moved on" or "left" civil rights. That is bullshit deeper then the Marianas Trench.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones You have repeatedly said MLK left civil rights for economic rights. He was always about both and he never left civil rights. Memphis was about civil rights, yes, unions, but on behalf of BLACK sanitation workers.
@admiralmpj @PFan62 @Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @BernieSanders @janeosanders My bad, they could have gone to the march on Washington - no idea if they did. Either way, they sure didn't do as much as Bernie did in Chicago. Shaun King tells us so.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones So your pernicious and racist lies about MLK are just more of the same, elevating policies to help "all Americans" with full knowledge that these policies often exacerbate race disparities because they do not address racism
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones Like Bernie, they were big on federalism so the racists in power could exclude Blacks from benefits under Farm Bill &amp; GI Bill. The New Deal created the middle class, but it also created the enormous wealth disparity between white &amp; Black America &amp; deliberately left Blacks behind
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones But there are always a certain kind of progressive that rush to dump Black people, like those who went along with the Dixiecrat demand to leave Black occupations out of Wage &amp; Hour, Unemployment, Minimum Wage, and Social Security.
@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones You are lying about MLK to make an argument he never made. Black people know economic security of the white man does not reduce his racism otherwise the 50s and 60s would have been the greatest era of racial harmony.
@admiralmpj @PFan62 @Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @BernieSanders @janeosanders I've never heard that Goodman or Schwerner were at Selma, though maybe they were.

@Johnsmith_sr @Unknwnstuntman @stacysongkehoe @nhannahjones I've read Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community. You are a lying buzzard. Also, Sanders is a creep for trying to make his book seem like the sequel.
Then Bernie quickly hired a Black staffer, paraded her around for press interviews to clean up, before forgetting her name. It's amazing that Seattle is presented as some racial justice grace note rather than thee fuckfest it was.
There was huge backlash against Bernie for being an asshole and canceling the rally because of 3 Black women. BROs turned on Black people, see Salon comments about the rally. They were claiming Black people don't matter because they're 12% of the population, who cares?
I think the ultimate in BernieBro Gaslighting was Killer Mike's rewrite of #BlackLivesMatter and Bernie in Seattle where BS got mad &amp; stomped off, not even giving the speech people came to hear.

@Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @admiralmpj In all four people were murdered, hundreds beaten and abused. That is why it is so offensive to exploit a photo of someone else at Selma. It's sacred ground.
@Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @admiralmpj This led to nationwide protests and galvanized support and urgency for voting rights. Two days later, King led a second march and James Reeb was beaten to death that night. The third march was protected by the national guard and they marched from Selma to Montgomery.
@Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @admiralmpj It was huge. But it was also broader than civil rights, addressing economic rights for all people as well. Selma, though, is very different. Have you heard of Bloody Sunday? That was the first March to Selma. The police beat them. Amelia Boynton was beaten so badly she passed out
@Auntiemels @RiskyLiberal @eclecticbrotha @admiralmpj A lot of people see the 1963 March on DC as the most significant event of the Civil Rights Movement, perhaps because it was the March for Jobs and Freedom that included demands for a minimum wage and public works investment and was endorsed by unions.

@SomeGirlinSoCal Also, Hillary did not start the birther myth, but you do you.
@SomeGirlinSoCal While Bernie was stealing electricity and loafing on unemployment, Clinton was going undercover to expose school segregation, registering Latino voters in Texas, and fighting already against school to prison, for children's rights.

@mikeweinstein @eclecticbrotha That is also not true. Clinton had a plan to improve on ObamaCare, bringing it closer to Germany. Bernie has set universal coverage back by misinforming people so they conflate universal health care with single payer.

@Sethisuwan @armandodkos Way to miss the fucking point. The point is that in 30 years, this is all he managed to do on civil rights, co-sponsor a few bills that other people did the work on. For 30 years, that's tepid, ineffectual, and inexcusable for someone claiming to be a civil rights leader.
@Sethisuwan @armandodkos The bill is an amendment to a bill that passed in 88, in 92, they came back to amend it

@mikeweinstein @eclecticbrotha His health care plan would be as good as the best blue state plan and as bad as the worst red state plan, because he resists federal mandates. He then abandons Black people and Latinos to the racists of the GOP in red states and the neglect of Blue states
@mikeweinstein @eclecticbrotha And he is a Federalist more than anything else. It's his defense for his pro-gun votes, but it is also how he planned to carry out his free college and single payer plans. Federalism is the enemy of civil rights and equality. So, his free college was free in blue America.
@mikeweinstein @eclecticbrotha Also, he's not a socialist, he's a Social Democrat. He is not advocating that the government take over the banks but that they split them up. He wants to redress th flaws of capitalism and that is laudable, but he hasn't the policy chops to do it effectively
@mikeweinstein @eclecticbrotha What did he do to advance civil rights? Did he introduce voting rights or bills to restore felon voting rights? What did he do? What did he achieve? What is the opportunity cost of an ineffectual gadfly? What could an effective senator have done?

@JSapp_AR Bernie really showed how bad he is when asked about reparations at the Town Hall. He said he supported Rep. Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 Amendment. That directs 10% of fed $ for specific programs to counties with 20% of the people in poverty over 30 years. 	https://t.co/4azKpdlEjR

@SomewhereinATX @VanityFair that only increases mass incarceration and ignores that people age out of violence. If Sanders cared about mass incarceration, he would look at public prison guard unions, but that doesn't fit his ideology.
@SomewhereinATX @VanityFair racist parole and bail algorithms, but Bernie read an article in "The Nation" and wants to craft policy without doing the research required to not make a bad situation worse. Too often we trade lighter sentences for drugs for stiffer sentences for "violent crimes" ignoring that
@SomewhereinATX @VanityFair And of course, Bernie has the most shallow take. Private prisons are not the cause of mass incarceration, public employee unions of prison guards are a bigger factor by far. The biggest factor is prosecutorial incentives &amp; disparities arise from prosecutorial discretion and
@SomewhereinATX @VanityFair This is a reflection of Bernie and his followers lack of connection.

RT @xiane1: @Cajsa @Neighbors @Nextdoor I'm fairly certain that is the de facto purpose of Nextdoor.
Have you considered how your app, @Neighbors, like @Nextdoor are ways to reinforce de facto segregation by making neighborhoods feel unsafe to Black people? To put them at risk of murder by police, their safety dependent on the judgment of an entire network of white people?
And if your @Ring alerts go straight to police, what does that mean? Will police see the picture of the Black person and rush in to arrest/kill them? Will they wait for the @Neighbors to say, hey, that's my brother-in-law?
Are you training your @Ring responders to filter out racist reporting? I bet not.
By the way, including people of many different ethnicities, including a Black man in your advertising does nothing to protect Black people from the racist effect of your app.
RT @mezbourian: @Cajsa @ring @Neighbors What is this, the help-it's-a-black-person app?!?
If nothing, I sure hope the family of the first victim of your recklessness ends up owning your company.
Of course not, because no one could download it and you would not profit. It seems to me you will get people killed. What are you doing now, proactively to keep that from happening?
Tamir Rice was killed by a 911 call and racist cops. John Crawford was killed by a malicious 911 call &amp; a racist cop. Trayvon Martin was killed by a "Neighborhood Watch" racist. It is reasonable to expect your App to be used by racists. Do they have to pass an implicit bias test?
Dear @Ring @Neighbors, What steps have you taken proactively to protect Black and brown folks from the racism of your app users? Have you even considered what might happen if some Black man is innocently snapped by your app, shared with the neighbors, and then someone calls 911?
And then does the family of the people murdered by the fecklessness of this company get to sue them into bankruptcy? @Neighbors
Does the world need an app to spread the opportunity to call 911 on more Black people from one to the whole neighborhood? Does this not seem like a technological form of segregation? Jim Crow on your smart phone? @Neighbors
When you look at how @Nextdoor is infected by racist reports of a suspicious Black man walking by his house in the morning and afternoon at the same time every day, for example. Memorable because his race incapacitates the person reporting from recognizing someone going to work
So I am seeing these ads by @Neighbors by @ring &amp; how police depts are joining in this "Neighborhood Watch" and I wonder how long it will before someone shares a pic with the neighbors and the neighborhood racist calls the cops to come shoot the Black Girl Scout selling cookies?

I did not plan to get wet, but we got hung up on a tree that was just enough above the river to pull the canoe under it, tipping us out. Then at the end of the river, we had
@obbiecole @notcapnamerica i've never gone ice-swimming but I have swum in 40° water. If you keep moving, you adjust and it's very refreshing and invigorating, but you need to be able to warm up and get in dry clothes immediately after.

I get being angry with Amazon for tax avoidance, but avoidance is legal. Tax evasion is illegal and $450 billion could bring down or debt or buy a hell of a lot of health care. This, by the way, is why Republicans keep cutting the IRS budget &amp; attacking IRS.
But what Manafort, Cohen, and Gates tell me is we need to triple the staff at the IRS and beef up white collar criminal investigation because every person they look at is cheating the taxpayers, cheating us. The IRS estimates that tax evasion costs us $450 billion/year.
I appreciate @MichaelCohen212 being candid and believe he regrets what he has done. I understand forceful personalities can drive people to cross boundaries. I even understand how crossing the line for Trump made it easier to cross the line for himself.
I also don't think @MichaelCohen212 understands that a bank can be fully repaid and not lose a dime, even make money, and still be defrauded by false documents. The false documents are fraud. They matter because risk matters, not only to bank, but insurers, and taxpayers.

@TeddiMellencamp Didn't you see the season before that when she lied about Kim attacking her? Rinna has been on season after season and I am sure the only reason she is on the show is because she has no bottom, no nadir to which she will not sink to get 15 seconds of screentime.

That is Bernie being glib, shallow, and deceptive in the certainty that his followers could not reason their way out of a one-way street.
If you think his followers are not ignorant, look at his confident assumption they will buy his 10-20-30 money for distressed communities as reparations or accept he really still does not have the last 10 years of taxes done.
And if you think Walker Bragman is not ignorant because he has a gig at Jacobin, just look at his defense of the Nazis.
They are both anti-intellectualism and if you doubt that about Bernie, look to his response to the Nobel-winning economists on the left whom he dismissed. Both think they know everything and their followers do too. They really are appealing to our worst and most ignorant
Both are anti-media and both tolerate and encourage a sense of persecution and grievance in their supporters. It is the authoritarian tendency, expressed in their anger and their own abusive form of communication.
Both sides are drawn to someone who asserts they are the ONLY ONE who can do this or that desired thing. They both offer easy answers that require nothing of their voters but their support, both promise the OTHER/the ENEMY will pay for the promised reward
While I think the Horseshoe theory is of limited utility as it applies more to tolerance of dissent and embrace of authoritarianism more than to values, I do think the popularity of Trump on the far right and Bernie on the far (US) left is a reflection of the need for a LEADER

He is still light on details, angry and angrier, contemptuous of anyone who questions him in any way, still ranting and waving his arms, and acting in a way that no other candidate can get away with except this personality twin Trump
Sanders has still not learned to handle questions from the press or public with grace. He acts as though its an imposition to ask him to explain himself. His response on sexual harassment was anger and deflection about his revolution and lying to say his "busy" was out of context
Reparations are not an anti-poverty program. Reparations are an unpaid debt that is long overdue. By deflecting to an anti-poverty investment in distressed communities, Sanders erases the Black working class and middle class.
He's learned less than nothing on racial justice. Again he appoints a few token Black people for outreach. On reparations, he cites Clyburn's 10-20-30, a good investment in distressed communities, black and white. Reparations are not just for poor Black people.

@tomwatson It's a reflection of his personality which makes him the other side of Trump's coin. They are the same in character while opposites ideologically. Hell, they are even both deep into nepotism.
@briebriejoy Funny how he targets Amazon, Trump's own obsession, rather than many other companies who don't pay taxes. It's like he trying to appeal to the Trump racists
@KyleKulinski How can we trust him when he takes such obvious pleasure in their harassment and cult-like adoration and does so little to address it?
@DigitalLeft @BernieSanders That is pretty much the Democratic Party platform but continue the farce that only Bernie cares about humanity.
@OFB2020 and Bernie is the last person able to change that because he is ineffectual
@KFILE When Bernie's former staff attack Dems in the media, they are just sources or even writers who fail to disclose their conflicts (Sirota) but sure.
@KFILE Bernie would not let any Clinton supporters speak at his rallies "for Clinton" and his speeches did not vary from his primary speeches. His effort was to glorify himself.

@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC @BilldeBlasio a really, really bad joke
@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC @BilldeBlasio The idea of @BillDeBlasio running is a joke.
@slhamlet @T_FisherKing @jaketapper @chrislhayes lol, didn't even notice.
@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC The center is where Solomon's baby is cut in half and divided between two claimants. Issue by issue, who has good ideas may vary. That I have not heard good ideas from the right in a long while is because they have forsaken policy-making and governance for power-seeking.
@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC That is nothing close to what I said. On one axis the l/r axis trend toward authoritarianism. On other axes, they will never intersect. The center is not best. On some issues the left has better answers. On others, a right that is not the one we have now may have better answers.
@thehill This shit is why I don't follow The Hill. It is about heat, not light, promoting Bernie at the expense of our democracy.
Funny, when I hear someone say make the moral choice, choose love not hate, and do the right thing, my first thought would never be, "Wait, he's talking shit about me" @RealDonaldTrump 	I think Trump had a moment of rare self-knowledge
@LilacsxGirl Thanks, though I never consider anything I write using the word idiot as well-articulated. If I am honest, I should find a single word that encompasses willful ignorance married to belligerent arrogance. Idiot is what I come up with, but I need a word that is less ableist.
@realDonaldTrump Nice to see you admit you are not the moral choice, that those who vote for you are doing the wrong thing. Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump Retirement is not getting thrown out. Being followed by a Democratic Senator @SenCortezMasto is an affirmation of his service. You ninny.

@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC It's a measure of how much they tolerate and embrace authoritarianism, not how their ideology comes together
@ShirlsAdams @CHURCHLADY320 @SenFeinstein @AOC The horseshoe theory is more about tolerance dissent, not so much economic ideology. At the extremes of the left &amp; right, dissent is not tolerated &amp; personal freedom of expression is suppressed, but the right does not embrace health care and the left does not embrace Wall Street
@adamkotsko How did that work out? Fighting those who have aggressive proposals that aren't your own is stupidity.
@adamkotsko We did not lose the Health Security Act because of Republicans. There were enough Dems to pass it. We lost to Democrats supporting three different options, one more conservative and one more liberal, abandoning it. The left arguing we could pass a better bill if it died.
@adamkotsko It is worse, but if this is an argument to attack those who have a good record and have been fighting to fight climate change for years because they can't magically put 60 Ds in the Senate, I'm not here for that kind of stupidity.
Not shocking, not unbelievable, but very much troubling. Putinism uses the tools of democracy to subvert democracy to move it to authoritarianism. Why? The desire for democracy overthrew the Soviet Union, so he seeks to degrade democracy's value in the eyes of the world. https://t.co/3IVFWTBoly

It is true @AOC can get attention, but bills are not passed by playing to the margins while disparaging those who should be allies. She needs to be primaried by someone who knows how to pass a bill. Here's a clue: it's not by wishing on a star

@sahilkapur The policy differences were relatively minor despite the Sanders idiots who thought the difference between $12 or 15 minimum wage with a Congress who won't pass $10 was a hill to die on. Sanders miseducated a generation, suggestind laws passes by fiat, despite his dismal record

So credits are refundable, almost a negative income tax....but if you don't have the upfront money to pay for the desired environmental improvements? or the money to rent in the first place? so do homeless people get it?
@jkfecke @KamalaHarris But if you qualify for EITC or are on disability and pay no income taxes?
For example, insulate your home, get a tax credit. Go solar, get a tax credit. But...what if you don't have the up-front money? What if you don't pay taxes, poor enough to qualify for EITC? Tax credits for child care are meaningless, too, if you have to wait until year end.
Thanks to the demonization of the poor by Republicans, even Democrats who want to address economic injustice focus on tax policy, not on tangible assistance. It's not just this example. There are several environmental tax credits at the state level...
I am liking @KamalaHarris a lot, but if her affordable housing is a tax credit, how does that help the working poor and the disabled who pay no federal income tax? Credits alone are good for the middle class, but not helpful for working poor.

@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not Bernie is temperamentally unfit and has an appallingly ineffective career that suggests he would be a disaster. Then he does not even come close to understand the issues of race and gender. I can think of a few hundred Democrats I prefer, right down to my precinct chair. https://t.co/O2NPa7TLIz
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not That is so untrue. He is not alone in talking about Citizens United I doubt there is a single candidate who does not want to undo Citizens United.
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not No, the public financing lost in Oregon. We have our own problems with unlimited campaign contributions after our SC nullified contribution limits. I would be happy with public financing with a $20-25 contribution requirement, more than what you give a street busker.
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not https://t.co/1Ecfs8sP4j
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not You're unaware of what's wrong with Arizona? Public financing --&gt; SB 1070 "Show Me Your Papers" It's sad, A friend ran the public financing campaign there, I was on our state's MIP campaign committee, but seeing what it did to AZ, I am glad we lost because we did $5 too
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not So someone in AZ collects a specific number of $5 contribtutions, they get public financing to run for office, The number of donations varies by office. It lowers the barrier to running too far, so they elect people who think cancer is a fungus.
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not donation, preferring something like $25, simply because Arizona's experience with the low threshold to access public financing has crazified their politics. A few yahoos sit in a mega-church parking lot on one Sunday and they have public financing. People have to think about $25
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not I agree money in politics is an issue. I would like Citizens United overturned but oppose the call for a constitutional convention where we could lose the entire bill of rights considering the states choose who attends. I support public financing but want more than the nominal $5
@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not Justice Dems is staffed by former Bernie staffers who make good money perpetuating a fraud all organized for the pecuniary benefit of the ultimate grifter, Cenk Uyger whose WOLF-PAC is implicated in forging Voter's Pamphlet in our state.

@justinbhickman @notcapnamerica @Here4Not Feinstein was the sponsor of 2 important environmental bills that became law. Sanders was the sponsor of not one. As a co-sponsor, she also outperformed Sanders 19 to 13. This is looking just at bills that became law, because that's what counts. So take your purist B.S.

Instead, she engaged them as citizens capable of understanding the legislative process and the current reality, not as toddlers who get handed a lollipop. It was not @SenFeinstein who disrespected the children, it was @sunrisemvmt
For @sunrisemvmt the kids were a human shield to mask the organizer's rudeness and provocation, a weapon to use to bully the senator. She refused to treat them as infantile and stupid. She could have lied, said thank you so much, I will look into this, and walked away.
What offends me most about the brouhaha with @SenFeinstein is that she is being criticized for treating children as though they can think, reason, and understand something more difficult than "We Want a GND and we want it now." She did not pander. @sunrisemvmt exploited them
@davidhogg111 @SenFeinstein She has a 100% rating for the last session, a lifetime rating of 90% on environmental issues. But sure, vote her out because she didn't pander to children but treated them as though they are thinking, rational people.

Now I am going back to avoiding listening to him, it just makes me hate him more simply because his voice disgusts me and his always angry abusive belittling tone makes me think of someone who beats women.
OK, I listened to his awful interview. He is as awful as I remember and worse on TV than on paper. He's such an egoist that he really cannot believe in democracy, no one with that ego is satisfied with a role in government, they all want to be dictators.
95% of Americans want gun reform, but fucking Bernie Sanders "if the people stand up and demand" does a damn good job of ignoring them.
I hope he loses resoundingly early in the primaries because my digestion cannot handle listening to his spit-mouth phlegm. It grosses me out and makes me feel like gagging.
I support many of his ends, but I despise how he thinks it's something he can just do because he's got magic phlegm.
Now Bernie is pretty much quoting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, those economic rights are listed in that agreement, and FDRs Four Economic Freedoms, but pretending no one else works or believes in that .
He criticizes Trump for supporting authoritarian kleptocrats, but he supports Maduro. 	ah, he's gonna change the world with his magic phlegm, human rights, democracy, economic justice all over the world
Then Mr. Phleghm says he will pass everything because they have to. Because presto-changeo he's Mr. Magic
He seems to erase SEIU, Jobs With Justice, Families USA and every single advocacy organization that ever existed because Mr. Phelegm is the only person who ever mattered in the last 40 years.
Fucking @BernieSanders claiming ownership of Medicare for All and single payer as if John Conyers and John Dingell never existed.

@OhNoSheTwitnt @Satiricali Because there was an arson, should we disband the fire department? Of course not, it's only those who are motivated by hate who will use this to discount hate crimes. After all, look at Hasson today with his list of people to kill.
@paulelvis0807 @OhNoSheTwitnt Actually that is not how it works. Everyone reports home invasions, fires, attacks, and all sorts of crimes before the perpetrators are apprehended and the indictments are in and the verdict handed down. So few people make false allegations that police are supposed to investigate
@OhNoSheTwitnt @Satiricali The simple truth is that if Smollett's fraud makes people not believe LGBT and POC reports of hate crimes, then they were already disposed not to believe them. There are false reports of robberies, break-ins, stolen cars, etc, but we still keep hiring cops.

Hensman is a Marxist and comes out of the same ideological background (which makes the introduction a chore) but she is not someone who gave up her moral center to enforce a singular anti-American stance
but his worse impulses are still constrained somewhat while Putin, Assad, Duterte, and so many others are absolute authoritarian despots who get inexplicable support from the morally corrupt Jacobite left.
So really, they are not anti-imperialism, they are only anti-American imperialism and imperialism by Russia, China, Saudia Arabia are fine. They don't like Trump but embrace Putin and Assad. Seriously, Putin and Assad are worse than Trump. I think he is a disgrace and dangerous.
It's one thing to be anti-imperialist. I would classify myself as an anti-imperialist and think we were wrong to go to war in Iraq, for example, but then I think Russia is wrong to invade the Ukraine and SA is wrong to invade Yemen. But those are okay with the purist uber-left

@happyangie @CynderIm Yes, they are. Bernie is the only one too corrupt to reveal his taxes. I suspect it's the money Jane was paid while serving on the hazardous waste board. After all, the kickbacks were revealed in FEC files.
@CynderIm The other primary candidates disclosed their tax returns. His refusal gave Trump cover for refusing. Why did he refuse? I mean if Clinton was so corrupt and revealed 30 years, how come oh-so-clean Bernie could not even do a full release of one year? He is hiding something,

@SeriouslyJr @JustAGurLnSwedn @stelladennard @tomwatson I think she wanted something from Hillary, like some leading role in the campaign. Hillary and Bill both raised money for her and campaigned for her and she lost. I think she could have been a small fish in a big pond with Clinton campaign as they had many POC working for them

a big middle finger. He is also showing his contempt for African Americans, thinking he can assuage their concerns about his mockery of civil rights as a distraction by appointing a Black woman, as though Black people are interchangeable widgets.
Nina Turner as his campaign chair showed two things about Bernie, he is unapologetic about this role in electing Trump and benefiting from Putin's help. He appointed the avatar of ratfucking, Nina Turner who advocated voting for Jill Stein. He's giving the entire Democratic Party
The hypocrisy of Sanders complaining the SDs were fixing the primary when he was the only one who asked them to overturn the will of the voters is monumental. The gall of choosing Nina Turner (vote for Jill Stein) shows he has no intention of running a positive campaign

@SDargitz @Didikatz @agraybee and issued a press release claiming he was vindicated. He was not, he just lied and you have to search to find the truth under the blizzard of reports parroting his false press release. That was when I realized he was nothing but a lying cheat.
@SDargitz @Didikatz @agraybee When really, he was just too full of himself to return phone calls from DNC. Starts fundraising, creating agita among followers with his lies. Then he sues.

@SDargitz @Didikatz @agraybee Yes, he was dishonest from top to bottom. The DNC tried to reach him for days but he did not return calls &amp; guilty party did not come forward. So after he was warned repeatedly, they closed access to the VAN. They run to the press claiming sabotage.

Bernie is getting vetted this time, but the sheer awfulness of Trump has made Bernie's sort of graft and corruption penny ante skimming with nepotistic jobs for his family. Ho hum, but he's still awful, will still lose, and cannot overcome GOP redbaiting
What @JulianCastro @CoryBooker @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris @ewarren @SherrodBrown @JoeBiden &amp; @SenGillibrand must do is bow out quickly if they don't catch fire with the public in order to not divide Bernie vote. They must give delegates to not-Bernie when they bow out.

@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 and of course, there are the independent expenditures of the Internet Research Agency on behalf of Sanders that he failed to disclose on his FEC forms, probably because they were illegal, but which he said he knew about.
@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 Then there is Mr. I take no PAC money getting the support of superpacs who plowed millions into supporting him and then Sanders himself founding a hidden-money "dark" money group to hide his financial supporters.
@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 Then there is the mystery vendor that received millions from the campaign but didn't even have an office, run out of a friend's house...where did that money go?
@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 Then there is the problem with Sanders asking for one extension after another to file with FEC and then saying "ah well, the campaign's over" and not filing...he has a lot to clear up in terms of violations, excess contributions, and undisclosed information
@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 The FEC listing of excess contributions to Sanders campaign was book-length. Then there was the $10 million unexplained donation. I think it might have been an aggregate from Act Blue, but if so, why not answer that question instead of never explaining &amp; stonewalling
@Wholockian_15 @thatssocute @GrassrootsSpeak @Earwig360 It's true they verify donations, but most campaigns track aggregate contributions and prevent you from contributing over the limit. If your weekly or monthly donation reached the legal limit, most campaigns stop taking your money. Sanders did not and it's unclear they refunded
@Sisterray63 @slutcracker @Xytiel Seriously, if the conwoman Jill Stein who is still paying herself from the money people donated for a recount most closely aligns with your values, I wouldn't admit it.
@Sisterray63 @slutcracker @Xytiel You do know she was supposed to be in WI when the Pulse massacre happened and she cancelled all events like any decent human being, unlike you, obviously.
They lie so brazenly because the fish rots from the head and Bernie is grifter who still has not cleaned up his 2016 FEC cheating and violations.

And now the entire @GOP is in the business of defending treason and conspiracy, in the business of defending money laundering, cheating, and mobocracy. Not a single American patriot to stand up and tell the truth. Donald Trump is a crook and a traitor. &amp; None of you will say it.
None of @realDonaldTrump's children were American enough to turn down the Russians or the Saudis. None of his lawyers, none of his campaign staff. They were corrupt to the last man and woman. Not an American among them - not at heart.
Whoever thought a political campaign would be so deeply baked in corruption that every person the Russians contacted conspired with the Russians and not one person was patriot enough to go to the @FBI. Not one person close to Trump was a decent American with average values.

@420nitrousbleep The real precedent is 2008, where Clinton didn't linger weeks after CA primary waiting for some mystery mail-in ballots to go strong for Obama. Her supporters did not boo him or his supporters at the DNC and stage a walk-out thanks to his whining about being robbed.

@heathertanchuck @DrCatsby This is real. My cat was diagnosed with anorexia and took mirtazapine for years. $30/month for that plus another 45/2 months for Paxil to reduce his anxiety from mirtazapine. Now he takes nothing, just eats off shallow bowls.
@B_Academy_Vet My cat's anorexia was addressed by using those tiny bowls they put spics in on cooking shows, too shallow for his whiskers to touch the bowl. Before trying that, years of mirtazapine and screaming.
@CatFacts4You My cat has taken mirtazapine to address his anorexia, with all the awful screaming side effects, but I discovered that he was not eating because his whiskers touched the bowl. Food in those tiny tasting bowl, too shallow for his whisker to touch - end of anorexia.
My cat also has this bloodcurdling shriek that has me wondering why no one has called SWAT. It's loud, so angry, I don't know what a banshee sounds like, but I bet it is pretty close. It's a side effect of his mirtazapine for anorexia
By properly, he means leaving room for him to crawl under the covers
My cat has this huge repertoire of meows and howls. Today he's sounding like a Muslim call to prayer, with a long ululation ending in an ullah, u not a, but then the real calls to pray sound more like a u. This meow means I have not made my bed properly.

The only difference between them is which side of the aisle they push their populism from, but they both promote ignorance and division in order to enrich themselves and their family.
They both fail to read past the headlines. They both embrace Russia. They both benefited from Putin's troll farms and do nothing to prevent that happening again. They both chose to employ agents of Russia in their campaigns.
They are both abusive to their staff. They both avoided hiring POC until pushed into it by scrutiny. They both think nearly all black people are criminals and drug users who live in poverty. They both attack Wall Street without any real plan for regulating Wall Street
Bernie and Trump disrespect the media, walking out when questioned about anything serious. They both lie to attack the Democrats. They both claim they are victims of conspiracy. They are both paranoid conspiracy-mongers who benefit from alt-right and alt-left racism.
Neither of them know how their policy ideas will function nor can they explain them. For them, policy is always a bumper sticker slogan. They both enriched themselves with their campaign money. They are both angry and and abusive men.
@JulieJo11494780 @realDonaldTrump @BernieSanders Read the thread. i know he's not a Dem but he plans to run for hte nomination
They are both anti-immigrant though Bernie lies to pretend otherwise now. They are both bigots, only recognizing stereotypes of Black people, one with hate, the other with pity &amp; condescension. They are both intellectually lazy &amp; not interested in policy details
They are both grifters counting on personality cult promotion and ignorance to lift them up. They are both creatures of the media. They both are nepotists who abuse their power to pay family. They are both liars. They both have a questionable connect to Russia
If Democrats want to elect their own @RealDonaldTrump, they would choose @BernieSanders who is similar in character and temperament. Their ideologies differ in they each have their own monomania coupled with belligerent ignorance.

@sarahfdavis280 But vaccines aren't a conspiracy, neither is fluoride or climate science. Fast and furious was not a conspiracy. I believe in Hanlon's Law. Most things aren't conspiracies. Trump's campaign became involved in conspiracy because he is corrupt &amp; hired corrupt people.
@sarahfdavis280 Clearly, Putin conspired with people in Trump's campaign to interfere in the election. That is a real conspiracy. We can surmise Trump knew because why wouldn't the multitudes of folks involved tell him, but we don't know yet.
@sarahfdavis280 I want my crime shows to be stand along episodes with at most 2 or 3 part longer stories. Not entire season. I also hate the big conspiracies that involve gov't, etc. it feeds into stupidity and conspiratorial thinking. Sure, there are conspiracies, but not everything is one
@sarahfdavis280 Like NCIS NO, always some long conspiracy to get Pryde. There are single episodes, but then there we are back to the conspiracy. Blacklist, always some blacklister, but also lately a big conspiracy behind the scenes.

I double checked. It's still the law. You can't vote on probation. So, are they trying to entrap Black voters? My friend is a Black woman and she had every intention of voting, but got an extra shift at work that day.
aren't you on probation? Yes, she is. But she said they registered her to vote when she got out of prison, when she was being set up with probation, etc. I told her about Crystal Mason who got 5 years for voting while on probation.
I talked to a friend of mine who moved to TX a few years back. She's been in prison and got out last year. During our conversation, we talked about 2016 election (which she missed because in jail) then she said she felt so bad about not voting in 2018. So I asked...

I mean, if you cannot be equal before the law, you cannot be equal anywhere. This is, I think, where we get at the root of structural racism. So I think Bryan Stevenson is doing the work of making America a little bit closer to what it claims it is. Too bad America works so hard
With systemic racism creating disparities in employment, education, health care, environmental quality, voting rights, and in criminal justice, it's hard to know where to start, but I feel such urgency on criminal justice, I suppose because it is fundamental to our idea of gov't

You meet the stupidest people on Twitter.
Rep. Omar said something anti-Semitic. She recognized it and apologized for it. The people calling on her to resign have said far worse and their supporters kill Jews and AIPAC routinely sides with Trump and McCarthy and the GOP, so they are embracing the worst anti-Semites.
I would argue that AIPAC is treading on dangerous ground claiming they alone represent the Jewish voice in America or in the world. They are the ones erasing the opinions of untold numbers of Jews. They are the ones portraying Jews as a monolith of homogenous thought and opinion
Under AIPAC (and DC) rules, any criticism of Netanyahu, AIPAC, and the Israel lobby is anti-Semitic. That's untrue, and in fact, flattens the heterogeneous character of Jews in America, erasing all Jews who are not supportive of illegal settlements, the occupation, or Netanyahu.
It does not help that no one was ever harmed by doing @AIPAC's dirty work. Like the NRA, AIPAC is at the top of the power lobby mountain and politicians and journalists carry their water all the time. There are few willing to challenge them because they slander their critics.
I wonder if the sustained angry scrutiny of Rep. Omar and Tlaib is precipitated less by what they say than by what they represent.

@1StrongBlack1 @IlhanMN They are no different from the NRA - and it's a form of force, extorting votes through threats of voter mobilization or buying them through contributions.
I am disgusted that @AIPAC has pushed the unconstitutional Anti-BDS bill and even more disgusted than one of my senators @RonWyden voted for it. It is not good for Israel to push such an unpopular and unconstitutional bill on the American people.
And seriously, if you support Israel, you would oppose @AIPAC for its belligerent support of illegal settlements and its maximalist support of the corrupt and vicious Netanyahu and his endless illegal expansion of the Occupation.
I am glad @IlhanMN apologized, but if she had tweeted "It's all about AIPAC" sh would have nothing to apologize for. They, like the NRA, consistently force Congress to act against the interests of the United States and the will of the people.

The @GOP will never hold their own racists accountable because it would cost them votes. Without white supremacists they have no base at all.
I note Republicans are not calling for the GOP member who edited the racist yearbook or the GOP guy in Florida who insists blackface is not racist to resign. They only demand resignations of Democrats and embrace their racists because racists are their base.

I know there is probably no singular consensus on liking/RTing things we agree with even though they use in-group language that being out-group, I should not use, but maybe a sense of the room?
So, is liking or retweeting something I could never appropriately say as a white person kind of like saying it? Sometimes it feels like a transgression, but then I like to respond to people who reply to me...and don't want to ignore them.
I frequently face a dilemma on Twitter when an African American uses a word or phrase that is perfectly fine for them to use but wrong for a white person. I mean terms for Black people who use their Blackness on behalf of white supremacy, people like Candace Owens, etc.

Dingell was not a purist who would rather have no health care reform if he couldn't get his exact idea. He was a real leader.
It's the history of Democrats like Dingell and John Conyers who both led the struggle for health care for all, who both fostered the Medicare for All concept and who never wavered that makes me so irritated with people who claim their credit without the work
Rep @JohnDingell lived a long life of service. His father before him served the same district &amp; introduced a Single Payer bill back in the 30s as part of the New Deal. When Dingell ran for his father's seat in the 50s, he introduced single payer-his father's own bill each session

@mrcz032308 @rgay We cannot be innocent of white supremacy so long as the society we allow to exist oppresses Black people. The society is our creation. It is our guilt.
@mrcz032308 @rgay as long as Black people are perceived as less than white people and as long as social mores and the law are used to maintain White supremacy, we must assume collective responsibility for the society we allow to exist.
@mrcz032308 @rgay but I surely must. White supremacy is a fundamental organizing principle of European civilization and we are all implicated. But it's more than that. Many of us claim we have no collective guilt for slavery, perhaps because our ancestors immigrated after the Civil War, but
@mrcz032308 @rgay If I deny Black people's reaction to events, suggesting they are seeing it through a racialized lens rather than seeing reality, that's racism. If I tell Black people their issues are less important than issues that affect more people, that's racism. I try not to do those things
@mrcz032308 @rgay Once I recognize that racism is simply indoctrinated bias plus belonging to the privileged group that sets the rules in society, I must also recognize that I am a racist. When I note how well someone defies a stereotype of Black people, that's not a compliment, that's racism.
@mrcz032308 @rgay I am white. While I try hard to reject white privilege and combat racism, I realize I cannot grow up in a white supremacist society without being affected by that indoctrination. I cannot swim in this racist pool without getting wet. I see my job, then, to stop pretending I can

This matters because most reforms will make the problem worse. If we trade shorter sentences on drug crimes for longer sentences on other crimes, we are making the problem worse.

@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing State and local policy drives over-incarceration. The real problem with proposals that decrease sentences for drug crimes is that they trade it for longer sentences for violent crimes even though most people AGE OUT of violence. https://t.co/FwTzA2DayX
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing Yeah, but decriminalizing drugs is an easy answer NOW because white people are getting hurt. It is, however, the answer of someone who does not invest real time in the issue. The main reason for over-incarceration of Black peopleis not drug penalties. It's prosecutor discretion.
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing Criminal justice reform matters, too, in large part because the system is very much designed to maintain white supremacy, but the reforms that are needed must address prosecutors' moral hazard,
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing Black people care about criminal justice reform, but they also care about voting rights, health disparities, and many other issues. IT's jumping straight to criminal justice just like Sanders - the whole Blacks=Criminals thing
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing I would argue that your jump to criminal justice reform as proof he is not racist is due to your association of Blackness with criminality. Why not voting rights? Why not health disparities? Why not maternal mortality? Why not housing or health care of education?
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing Sanders sees Black people in a binary way. There are the celebrities he courts and the poor/criminal/"underprivileged" he pities. He does not recognize the normalcy of many Black people lives. When he thinks middle class, he doesn't think Black.

@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing White people use drugs to the same degree as Black people. They are more likely to sell drugs, but Black people are overrepresented. Not because Black people are more likely to use drugs but because of police and prosecutor bias.
@Alexredna @PollyAndry @notcapnamerica @DebraMessing I think prima facie evidence is your own association of Blackness with pathology, just as Sanders does. Criminal justice reform is not needed because Black people are criminals but because we criminalize Blackness.

It might be useful to examine what #Northam is doing for racial justice. Is he doing anything? After all, Robert Byrd moved from being a Klan officer to a 100% rating from NAACP &amp; being honored by them. That photo is overt racism long past the "good old days" they MAGAs long for.

could melt, trickles of icy water seeping through a shirt or pants, depending on where he was sitting. He was a pretty clever cat. He knew how to parkour from wall to wall in the hallway so he could go through the transoms! But the freezing was a true repeat idiocy his whole life
This meant whoever went to let him in had to kneel down on the ground, hold their hands around his front paws (rear paws never froze) and warm them up so they came loose. Then, he would run inside and jump on any handy human so those little chunks of ice still stuck to his paws
When I was growing up I had a cat who loved to roam the woods for hours no matter how cold it was. But when he came home he would sit in one spot and howl to be let in. Because he didn't move, a few times every winter, his feet froze to the cement step on really cold days.

James Chasse was not hurting anyone when someone called 911 and then the police beat him to death. The police were wrong, but the people who called 911 were wrong, too. Sure, public urination is a nuisance, but nuisances should not be capital crimes.
Mejia Poot is dead because a racist asshole bus driver didn't let him one when he was short 15 cents. I have seen many white people let on short money., allowed to ask for change, people have offered to chip in. For 15 cents, he's dead.
Portland Police have been held harmless in far too many deaths of unarmed citizens for me to ever trust them and I advise people to think 10 times before ever calling the police for anything not life or death, because too many people end up dead.

@JacobaHollander @sporen_weber @IndOgburn @SistahScholar @rolandsmartin @mike47441781 @KillerMike This only applies to companies of over 500 employees. This is not a minimum wage requirement.

@stephasavale A waitress who refused to apologize for spilling on someone because she didn't intend to would be fired the first time it happened. So, would Lala say stop pulling the customer card, I'm not anti-customer! No, she would say, I'm sorry.

@daveweigel The goal must be universal healthcare and it can still be more easily achieved by adding a public option to ACA and amending it to language that negates the really stretching-it rationale the court used to declare the individual mandate unconstitutional.
@daveweigel leads to purists who sabotage real progress to universal health care so they can get the critique of capitalism that single payer satisfies. Canada's system costs more than the rest, has equivalent to poorer outcomes, but is held up as the model because of miseducation.
@daveweigel Or French, Italian, or one of the many multi-payer/public/private systems in the world. Sanders damaged reform by linking it so tightly to single payer which is one of the rarer kinds of universal health care. Most countries do not have single-payer. His miseducation...
@daveweigel But the real problem, as we found out and CA found out, is that people are afraid of losing what they have. The shitty, expensive, and irritating present is better than the unknown future. ObamaCare was a huge leap and smart reformers would build on that to make a German system
@daveweigel Now, I think we made strategic mistakes. I think our bill was too long, too detailed and should have been "The legislature shall create a health care system that pays for all necessary medical care through an equitable premium tax" since every sentence gives opponents something.
@daveweigel When we did a single payer initiative in Oregon it polled well past the minimum of 60% that you really need because folks are conditioned to vote "no" because status quo is less scary. It's been several years so Iam fuzzy on numbers, but I think it was near 70.

@DianaCorbitt @aurabogado @notUnitePink Well, one time I was interviewed on the Health Security Act and accidentally said 40 billion Americans were uninsured...
There was a good banking reform proposal called S.A.F.E. banking act, to grab attention on that issue he introduced his "too big to exist" bill that was a joke. Not even he could explain how to carry it out
And don't get me started on Bernie steal the work of legislators who are Black or women or Black women. His new college plan is cribbed from Hilliary, his Rx import from Cory Booker, M4All from Conyers, &amp; bail bill from Kamala Harris. Someday we should research his entire agenda
He allowed his surrogates to call women vagina voters. Well if more vagina voters elected more vagina legislators, there would not be a sales tax on tampons. Representation MATTERS not because of color or orientation, because of EXPERIENCE https://t.co/aeuBhDcwth
He mocks and disparages representation, yet his own proposals reveal how hindered and hobbled he is by lack of representation in his own office - unaware that people lost jobs, homes, and opportunity for lack of $500 in cash bail for example. Thinking most drug dealers are Black!
So he can propose a free college program that defunds HBCUs (he fixed most of that after criticism) and not propose anything on child care of universal pre-K. He can talk about the working class as though it exclusive white men rather than majority women and POC
And please, on Blackness? He sees Black people as a pathology, not as a varied group of people from working class to middle class to upper income. Nope, they are drug dealers and the nonworking poor and a few celebrities who made it out of the ghetto. (his word)
Because Bernie is not a woman nor is he gay, he is glib and dismissive of abortion rights and gay rights as distractions from the real issues. But if women were the majority in power, abortion would not be under threat. More gays, no transgender ban &amp; ENDA would pass
Oregon became a sanctuary state in 1987 because a Latino lawyer named Rocky Barilla ran for the state legislature, introduced the bill, and it passed easily with bipartisan support. Representation matters. Barillo knew of cops who harassed Latinos with deportation threats.
Bernie does not understand the power of representation or how having African Americans, immigrants, LGBTIQ, people who have experience poverty, Native American, and women in elected office making, interpreting, and executing the law. That is why he is so glib about representation
You get the point, he says don't vote for them "just" because they are from a marginalized group that does not have equal access to power. Vote for me because I am white and my agenda has scraps for them. Real power? No, just condescension masked as compassion

Health care for all, progressive taxation, pre-K and debt-free college are not coastal positions. Folks in Roseburg, Medford, and Grants Pass, Oregon support that. So do folks in Weizer and Burns, ID or in Tacoma and White Center, WA
If that Republican yahoo on @TheRevAl had ever canvassed, he would know the midwest and inner mountain folk want the same things. They might believe in different ways to achieve them, but they have the same goals. Speaking to common aspirations is not "coastal"
I think canvassing is a great start for anyone who wants to do politics or organizing. I've canvassed in OR, WA, ID, and people want the same things, even if they vote differently. They want affordable health care for all. They want good schools. They want fair taxes.

@AngryBlackLady That sure worked well, didn't it? Folks don't understand that presidents need organizations support to move policy and the funding for health care organizing shrank to a trickle. Health care reform died.
@AngryBlackLady I have tweeted about this before. In 93, after Clinton won, my organization closed 3 offices and laid off several organizers because contributions dried up from the public &amp; foundations. Everyone said Clinton was going to pass health care so they didn't need to fund the work

@SenTedCruz You are trying to stand on water, Mr. Shutdown. You did a shutdown all by yourself because you are that anti-American that your vanity mattered more than the country.

@SunflowerSoul71 @barbprindle @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton But their protests were legal according to the Constitution. Direct action is taken because it is legal. They protested illegal practices by the states with legal direct action according to the constitution.
@barbprindle @SunflowerSoul71 @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton I would love it too
@SunflowerSoul71 @barbprindle @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton The media still treats Hillary like shit. She is too much of a patriot, I think, to run when we need to defeat Trump. If she runs, people who vote  D will have to admit they made a mistake. If someone else runs, they can vote D without having to admit their stupidity
@SunflowerSoul71 @barbprindle @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton I do not think Hillary will run in 2020 because the media has not learned one damn thing and she knows they will not be better, they will be worse if she runs again. They will, perhaps, do better with a new woman candidate.
@SunflowerSoul71 @barbprindle @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton There is no constitutional way to put Hillary in the WH even though Trump cheated and conspired with Russia. I won't support any extraconstitutional remedy as that could be used against us in the future.
@SunflowerSoul71 @barbprindle @RebelRNStudent @RogueRachael @Old_Hippie56 @ManMet80 @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton Here's the thing. The only way any Democrat is in the WH in 2019 is if Trump and Pence are simultaneously eliminated, perhaps in an terrorist attack. That Democrat would be Pelosi. If Trump is impeached, Pence will immediately appoint a GOP VP who will be approved by Senate.
@Patrickesque Here's the thing. Bernie Sanders is just like Trump and thinks he is the best of everything and anything and incapable of self-assessment or reflection. He, too, is a walking Dunning-Kruger personality sketch.

@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders I could go on and on and on...but talking about Bernie is tedious. He is a grifter who has accomplished as little as anyone possibly could in forty years and the only reason he is taken seriously is white male privilege &amp; media inflation of anyone vs Hillary.
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders I think arguing that primaries in the South should not count because they tend to vote Red is evil, and you might notice he never said any such thing about Idaho or Nebraska who vote RED more loyally than the South. I guess white Red states should count...
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders I use this because there was an essay from a receptionist whose contribution was included as proof Hillary was a GS (sexist epithet deleted). They are doing this to Beto now. Wasn't it wrong to discount the South?
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders Wasn't it wrong to present the aggregate of individual donors who work for any kind of industry as though they were from corporations or industry lobbies? A receptionist at Goldman Sachs does not share interests with the CEO, but Bernie uses their contributions as though they do.
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders Wasn't it wrong to say Hillary was not qualified to be president? Wasn't it disqualifying for any candidate to rush off to spout off angry about a headline without reading the actual news story to see the headline was wrong?
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders Wasn't it corrupt to vote to indemnify the gun industry, protecting them from liability? Wasn't it wrong to snarl "No! I don't owe them an apology!" when asked about Sandy Hook families.
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders Isn't it wrong to lie and say he didn't know about the sexual harassment when he had to know about $30K settlements paid to victims? Wasn't it wrong for him to endorse one of the worst offenders? Wasn't it wrong for his campaign to punish the women?
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders In the past he diverted campaign funds to his wife, she was paid a % of media buys. In 2016, a mysterious company got those millions, most people believe that was the same thing, but more cleverly hidden.
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders She got $5K in 2014 as an emeritus member. So how much as an active member? We will never know because he refused to show his taxes - helping Trump by the way. We also don't know all his FEC filings because he asked for extensions and extensions and then was out so didn't file.
@ArdentFox @FakeOliviaPope @BernieSanders I am saying he is corrupt. Whether his corruption amounts to evil is up to you. He never released his full taxes, only the intro to one year, that hid all the years his wife was paid to serve on the board he voted to create
He pretends he never knew about sexual harassment in his campaign but his campaign paid out big settlements for sexual harassment and he endorsed one of the worse offenders and invited him to the Sanders Institute recently. Sure, he never knew...and if you believe that....
Kamala introduces bail reform. Bernie "I never knew" Sanders rushes to introduce bail reform even though he has not cared until Kamala introduced. He's a cheating fraud who hires family, a nepotist like Trump who practices character assassination.
He never gave a damn until it cost him and now he pretends to care, but can't educate himself or listen to his few Black supporters so he still face plants with "aren't most drug dealers AA?"
after 40 years of elected disinterest and disregard. Bernie could not even fake caring enough to hire a single person of color until he ran for Prez. He could not spend a penny of political capital for Kiah Morris. He thinks AA are drug dealers and criminals.
The only reason for Bernie to run is to rake in more money from the deluded BROs. There are plenty of progressive candidates who aren't tainted with his racist condescension for African Americans best exemplified their persistent belief that getting arrested over 50 years matters
