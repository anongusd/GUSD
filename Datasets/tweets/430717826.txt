@Nupe117 @tthomaslew76 @cspanwj The question is &amp; has been - do you?
@karenbuc1 @tthomaslew76 @EPWVLaw @cspanwj Please tell me precisely what you view of what I've said as "hatred". That is really strong &amp; hurtful &amp; I think very unfair
@karenbuc1 @tthomaslew76 @EPWVLaw @cspanwj Because I said "vote your conscience"?
@Nupe117 @tthomaslew76 @cspanwj Amazing that the Democratic Party was inept enough to let that happen, couldn't make it clear it had something better to offer. A lot of us lifelong Democrats, who were so thrilled to have Bernie to vote for, felt personally slighted by what happened. Want us back?
@karenbuc1 @EPWVLaw @tthomaslew76 @cspanwj My goodness, all I said was I agreed that, yes, it seems many anti-Bernie people are more emotional than factual. But, any reason that a person wants to vote for someone is valid &amp; their right. Vote your conscience. Tell me why you LIKE your choice
@tthomaslew76 @EPWVLaw @cspanwj Well, anyway, we have been, with links &amp; graphics, stats &amp; graphs &amp; everything
@Nupe117 @cspanwj Believe that is ALL it was &amp; lose again
@Nupe117 @tthomaslew76 @cspanwj Also. People want to forget how many NEW &amp; YOUNG voters @BernieSanders brought in, who were so excited to have a candidate to vote for, who really were hurt &amp; shocked to see what happened &amp; were turned off to the process. They aren't an "auto-on" demographic
@Nupe117 @tthomaslew76 @cspanwj You, &amp; everyone else, underestimate how values still matter to people, especially in the South. Moral people don't reward cheaters. You don't consider how many hurt, disappointed people just stayed home
@Nupe117 @cspanwj With the help of a media blackout, especially the first 6 months &amp; after she &amp; the DNC cheated openly during the primaries, depriving people of their voice. Her campaign was so "brilliant" she had 3 mil more votes &amp; still lost to a vile pile of bigoted fat
@tthomaslew76 @EPWVLaw @cspanwj It does, but everyone should vote their conscience
I love my Socialist roads, public schools, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, public universities, public parks, etc. @cspanwj
@EPWVLaw @cspanwj Well, we KNOW that Bernie Sanders will NEVER get your vote no how, so, no shock there
Look at the difference in effectiveness between someone who really believes in the @SenSanders platform &amp; really works hard to realize it, like @AOC &amp; someone like @SenKamalaHarris, who is just parroting some things about it to get votes @cspanwj
Too late, @SenKamalaHarris is already running on the Bernie Sanders Democratic Socialist platform, we see that, even if she wants to pretend otherwise @cspanwj
