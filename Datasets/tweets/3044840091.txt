.@staceyabrams alluding to Ralph Northam? "We continue to confront racism from our past and in our present – which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds – and call racism what it is. Wrong."
.@staceyabrams defines "free and fair elections" as "voters pick[ing] their leaders," not politicians "pick[ing] their voters."
.@staceyabrams: "Voter suppression is real. From making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy."

Trump says tolerating illegal immigration is "very cruel," not compassionate
"No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration," Trump says. "Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards." #SOTU
Trump calls immigration a "moral issue." "Tonight," he says, "I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country."
Trump notes Congress has another government funding deadline approaching: "Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers and human traffickers out of business."
Trump says Rs and Ds worked together on criminal justice reform. Now he's challenging them to come together on an immigration deal
Trump warns that "foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations" can stop America's "economic miracle." "If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation," he says. "It just doesn't work that way!"
"We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction," Trump tells a joint session of Congress. "Tonight, I ask you to choose greatness." #SOTU

More Coons on Flake: “What I think has real value is that there was an additional FBI investigation into the allegations in front of the committee. That we have different views of its thoroughness, I can live with. I will continue to speak with him about this.”
Coons on Flake: “Senator Flake is genuinely a conservative and would like a conservative court. I am not, and I would not. We went into this with different views.”
Coons: “I am still grateful to my friend, Senator Flake, for having taken a step to ensure there was an additional FBI background investigation, although it did not meet the scope and thoroughness that I called for.”
Coons says the FBI report “did not answer all of the questions that I have, and in some ways I am left with more questions than answers.”
Merkley says the FBI investigation was “extremely superficial and limited”: “It appears that the White House completely circumscribed the investigation to try to make it meaningless, and they succeeded.”
Quote-machine Kennedy, asked if it’s weird that only one copy of the report is available to all senators: “I think Washington, D.C., is weird. I think this whole place is weird. When I go back home to Louisiana, I celebrate being able to return to America.”

Kavanaugh interrupting Feinstein: "You're interviewing me. You're interviewing me. You're doing it, senator. I'm sorry to interrupt. But you're doing it."
KAVANAUGH IS STILL YELLING AT UNITED STATES SENATORS
Kavanaugh calls Judge a "funny guy." In Ford's testimony, she said laughter is her strongest memory of that night:		"They were laughing with each other. I was, you know, underneath one of them while the two laughed. Two friends having a really good time with one another."

Kavanaugh's conclusion: "I swear today under oath before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge."
Kavanaugh and his wife "knew this process would be challenging. We never expected that it would devolve into this. Explaining this to our daughters has been about the worst experience of our lives."
RT @gabrielsherman: The crying has unnerved some White House aides, source says. “People don’t know why he is crying.”
Kavanaugh has surprisingly been much more emotional than Ford, who had to recount a traumatizing experience -- that some won't even believe -- in front of the entire country
AWKWARD moment for Kavanaugh and all of us: "As to sex, this is not a topic I ever imagined would come up at a judicial confirmation hearing."
Coca-Cola and beer getting plugs at the Ford-Kavanaugh hearings
Kavanaugh on the calendar he kept: "Some have noticed that I didn't have church on Sundays on my calendars. I also didn't list brushing my teeth, and for me, going to church on Sundays was like brushing my teeth -- automatic. Still is."
Kavanaugh broke down a bit when recalling his young daughter saying they should pray for Dr. Ford. "That's a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old. We mean--" he began as his voice broke and he composed himself. "We mean no ill will."
Kavanaugh is GOING IN: "This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. ... What goes around comes around."
His tone doesn't seem helpful to his cause, but maybe this is what Trump wanted to see
Kavanaugh is ANGRY https://t.co/Kr4vrQfp9d
Imagine how hours of an angry, defiant Kavanaugh yelling will play out versus how Ford conducted herself
A forceful Kavanaugh is apparently reading a new opening statement: " I wrote it myself yesterday afternoon and evening," he told the committee. "No one has seen a draft or it, except for one of my former law clerks. This is my statement."
Part 2
Graham post-hearing says he's "really upset" about how Feinstein handled this. "That's a bunch of bull. ... Their goal is to win the Senate and never allow Trump to fill the seat. ... The friends on the other side set it up to be just the way it is. I feel ambushed."
Rachel Mitchell's closing argument was: "Would you believe me if I told you that there’s no study that says that this setting in five-minute increments is the best way to [interview victims of trauma]?"
Grassley: "Let's just be nice to her."
Harris to Ford: "You have passed a polygraph and submitted the results to this committee. Judge Kavanaugh has not."

Ford says she arrived to D.C. by plane despite reports that she has a fear of flying: "I was hoping they would come to me, but I realized that was an unrealistic request."

McBath says her support overwhelmingly came from voters in white communities, not historically minority communities. "Over and over again people [in minority communities] kept saying they didn’t know I was running for office."
McBath says she's viewed as the mother of Jordan Davis, who was shot and killed in 2012. He was 17. McBath says people assume, "She can speak about gun violence but can she speak about Social Security [and other issues]?"
