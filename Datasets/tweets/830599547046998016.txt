we agree with @EvanBayh and @StevenOlikara  on @smerconish. We need more progress, less #partisanship. #Millennials can make that happen.
@smerconish Millennials are disgusted and disheartened by everything you're describing. We need change, and term limits for congress.
@smerconish #Millennials are the largest living generation, and largest workforce population, but less than 4% of congress are millennials.
@smerconish but you can't talk about this stuff without positioning CNN. You're not a non-factor or bystander. So what role does CNN play?
@smerconish are you claiming that CNN is not polarized? Would you not agree, to a degree, CNN is "liberal media"?
@smerconish that was the best segment I've ever seen on CNN. Great job sir.

#millennials aren't a can of soup. So don't try to label them. But you can study the things that shaped their generation glean some things.
Why does everything gotta be #Liberal or #Conservative? Maybe real #progress is in the pragmatic middle ground of dialogue and respect.
