@realDonaldTrump is not fooling around he knows all the angles to play with an amateur Congress! He knows our way of life is at stake and he is sworn to uphold our constitutional government. #MAGA
@SenSchumer Thanks for refusing nominations to crucial offices in the @POTUS GOV this does not help America!
Part 2: jumping the border entering illegally using fake ID’s is not going to make an alien a long term citizen. Causes crime costing the US money
Part 1: If Aliens wanted to be fair and enjoy our freedoms they would come here sign up legally, wait their turn, learn English, learn what we are about to become a law abiding citizen!
Funds sent from illegals should be seized to pay for wall https://t.co/vvS8ESzrY1
Illegals have fake ID’s so they can vote to raise taxes because it doesn’t affect them
@TeamPelosi Corporal Singh’s blood on your hands #BUILDTHEWALL the majority of people in CA do not want to pay for illegal immigration.
