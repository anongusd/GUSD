Government doesn't just regulate business, Honeywell's Cote says. They enable business. And that's part of America's success.
"From a business perspective, you don't want government running like a business" -- you need governments to be sustainable, Cote says.
Also, Public vs Private Conversations, Speed/Sense of Urgency, Who/What/When, Think/Say/Do, and Fear of Voters #BudgetFail

Enzi expresses frustration at vote-less mark-up. "By avoiding votes we've been avoiding solutions."
Sessions uses the past tense. Says Simpson-Bowles included proposals that "should have" been included in a deficit reduction plan.
Sessions instead directs his ire to Reid and "Democratic leadership" for "systematic plan for several years" to avoid votes on a #budget.

Of course, there are some issues with that bet... i.e. one party may believe it has won and has a mandate for its position (i.e. 2010).
