Will be interesting if an whether the lack of testing continues to be cited as an achievement coming out of this summit.
“Speed is not that important to me,” Trump says again. “I am in no rush,” elevating “no testing” to a major achievement. His team, meanwhile, has been trying to establish an actual timeline for NK denuclearization.
Turning North Korea into an “economic powerhouse,” per Trump just now, was and continues to be the theme of this summit.
Judge Jeanine was on hand for the opening of the American embassy in Israel, selling packages complete w tours of “hotspots.” Cost for a “gold” package: $3,295. Platinum: $3,995. For an extra $500, guests could “enjoy a private dinner w Judge Jeanine &amp; invited guest PM Netanyahu”
Per @markknoller, as 2/21 Trump had done 45 interviews w Fox News since taking office. Seven of those went to Hannity, more than the number of sitdowns POTUS has done w every other network. Second to Fox, Trump has done 5 interviews each with NBC &amp; CBS - https://t.co/t3CXoL1p3i

Recall: Kelly was once considered somebody who could be a restraint on the president. Ayers came to admin having run lots of GOP campaigns and told donors a purge of anti-Trump Republican lawmakers might be nice - https://t.co/wCGTArQx5p https://t.co/68Jp6SSlNk
Not much likely to change. Under Ayers, person close to WH predicted a “melee of backstabbing.” Lots is speculation Jared/Ivanka used Ayers to push Kelly out, questions about how long they stick with him. https://t.co/pj5Fz8LlTr
Among other things, Kelly knocked Kushner for trying to play a sort of “boy secretary of state,” according to a former WH official, and looked down on the first daughter for what he perceived were efforts to burnish her image at the expense of the WH -  https://t.co/wCGTArQx5p
Kelly’s exit will end the battle between him &amp; Javanka — each wanted the other out, and they recently blamed him for fanning the flames of Ivanka’s private e-mail scandal — but Ayers’ potential ascent has already started another feud over personnel - https://t.co/wCGTArQx5p
Kelly brought no political experience to the role, was knocked for being politically tone deaf. Ayers is a political animal. COS shakeup comes as Bill Stepien, political director, and Justin Clark, head of OPL, head to campaign. Stepien deputy Brian Jack likely to replace him - https://t.co/68Jp6SSlNk

And interestingly, those interviewed say the arc of the past year for Kelly wasn’t “a lot of influence” to “a little influence” but an attempt to impose changes that never quite took at the top and a White House generally better managed beneath - https://t.co/xVMY53Tnrb
“The president, probably because of his business background, seems to prefer a flatter organization for his White House staff than do most presidents. That’s his prerogative, of course, and Gen. Kelly has effectively managed to it,” Sen. Tom Cotton told me.
Kelly’s supporters and defenders say doing things like meeting with Putin alone, making calls the chief doesn’t know about, etc. are the president’s right. Kelly has to manage to it. But he hasn’t been able to convince Trump to do otherwise.

Pompeo’s most important message seemed to be this won’t be a tit-for-tat negotiation, a North Korean nuke in exchange for a U.S. economic one: “Until we get the outcome that we’re demanding, economic relief is not coming.”
"There are always irritants in relationships," Pompeo says of Navarro's remark about there being a "special place in hell" for PM Trudeau. Declines to comment on whether he agrees with the statement.
"The 'v' matters," Pompeo says of 'verifiable' in CVID. "We are going to ensure that we set up a system sufficiently robust that we are going to be able to verify these outcomes," likening to Reagan's "Trust but verify."

@KurtSchlichter The existence of the event is not classified. The details are classified. Or, that is what a White House spokesman employed by the president said when asked to comment on the president’s remarks.
@KurtSchlichter Yep, the NYT published the first account of the battle last week, which is referenced in the story.

Per pool, POTUS says "we'll have to see" whether Singapore summit will happen. Meanwhile, WH advisers roundly say he's unfazed by the latest threats.
Of even low-level George W. Bush administration negotiations with the DPRK "without preconditions," Bolton wrote in 2007, "With any luck, the DPRK would have rejected this approach, thus saving us from ourselves."
"DPRK has followed this game plan successfully many times, and it has every reason to believe it will continue to succeed in the future...NK's policies have often been more sensible than our own, where the hope of the High Minded seems always to triumph over contrary experience." https://t.co/lT92BpRnsE
For a hint as to where John Bolton stands and what he's telling POTUS, here he is in 2007 book: "The Democratic People’s Republican of Korea (DPRK) will never give up nuclear weapons voluntarily. It often promises to do so...It will even more readily bargain over that promise..."
