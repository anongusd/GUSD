Donald Trump promised to nominate judges who would "automatically" overturn abortion law in the United States. Brett Kavanaugh would threaten women's reproductive rights and has shown an open hostility to health care protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

AG Sessions just said we need to enforce the laws on the books today to keep guns away from criminals. We need to CHANGE laws like the one that allowed an 18yr old mentally unstable kid to legally buy an AR15 semi automatic weapon and kill 17 people.
I stand with my community and our families and ask all Americans to keep the victims and their loved ones in their prayers this evening. No American should have to feel the pain that Broward County is feeling tonight. We cannot allow this epidemic of gun violence to continue.
I am closely monitoring the developing situation at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Broward County. The victims are weighing heavy in my heart as is the courage of the first responders on the scene. This senseless violence must end.
Congratulations Representative-Elect @GoodforFlorida! 		It's now more clear than ever that voters in Florida and across the nation are eager to accept bold Democratic proposals to protect our clean air and water, expand access to health care, and empower the middle class.
The #TrumpBudget makes room to give handouts to giant corporations, while making it harder for students to pursue higher education. https://t.co/BjEWEgmlDB
A budget is a reflection of our values and the #TrumpBudget makes it clear @realDonaldTrump values tax cuts for giant corporations more than health care for seniors and the most vulnerable among us.

Last night, Trump made it perfectly clear that he views family reunification as a larger threat than income inequality or climate change. That’s a threat to our union. #SOTU
Donald Trump taking credit for economic conditions he didn’t create brings a whole new meaning to the phrase “alternative facts.”
Donald Trump pretends to champion hardworking Americans, but he has sided with giant corporations every chance he gets. #GOPTaxScam
After an hour and a half of empty promises and pandering, Trump’s main focus for the new year is apparently infrastructure. So why did he propose slashing infrastructure funding by $55 billion last year?
At tonight’s #SOTU Trump will do what he does best: take credit for economic conditions he didn’t create, and blame others for a DACA crisis he started.
Nicolas Perez is a South Florida small business owner, a DREAMer, and my #SOTU guest. When Trump looks into the crowd tomorrow night, I hope he thinks about people like Nicolas who came here through no fault of their own and contribute so much to our community.
It's just another example of Trump siding with corporate special interests over hardworking Americans.		Clearly, we still have a lot of work to do, but on this special anniversary I am especially motivated to keep fighting for what we know is right.
Equal pay for equal work shouldn't be a partisan issue, but months ago the Trump Administration took a step in the wrong direction by reversing the requirement that large corporations report accurate information about employee salaries.
Nine years ago today, @BarackObama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. While signing it, he spoke of hoping for his daughters "to grow up in a nation that values their contributions, where there are no limits to their dreams."

After failing to restrict access to health care, Trump's voter suppression commission is trying to restrict access to the ballot box.
Mr. President, these states are fighting your voter suppression effort. Your tax returns and White House visitor logs, on the other hand... https://t.co/Q3Gkw5ySXK
The new GOP effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement is totally irresponsible, and yet not at all surprising.
To every GOP Senator who refused to speak out against this cruel bill while it was still being considered: your silence speaks volumes.
I'm all for encouraging more companies to make their products in America - and I think we should start with Donald Trump's.
As @JoeBiden writes, "by denying that all Americans have a right to health care" the cruel GOP bill is "fundamentally flawed." https://t.co/CvFwgbX5qH
Happy birthday @RosLehtinen!! Hope this year will be your best one yet.
Trumpcare is cruel at its core. Somehow, the latest version is even worse than the previous one.
Republican politicians are keeping Affordable Care Act protections for themselves, and gutting them for everyone else. https://t.co/8HoFuolW3L
Under the ACA, Congress buys insurance on the ACA exchanges. Trumpcare is so cruel, GOP Senators are exempting themselves from it. https://t.co/NOeJaungkk

These guys say Dems are extremists on abortion. If allowing a woman's choice to truly be hers makes us extreme—we'll take it #GOPDebate
Pot meet kettle @marcorubio: You are one to talk about extremism on abortion, opposing it even for rape and incest.
@marcorubio Anyone notice that he didn't answer the question on whether he would allow waterboarding again? #youcantscriptthepresidency
"Once we have economic growth"? We are at 71 straight months of job growth and unemployment is below 5%. We're already there. #GOPDebate
RT @TheDemocrats: And everyone on stage wants to repeal the law. #GOPDebate https://t.co/2K65oR9ict
W/o the ACA, I'd have trouble getting insured (cancer survivor=preexisting condition). Those at the #GOPDebate would turn back progress.

.@TheDemocrats debates set viewer records. Both parties' broadcast network debates on wknds. Replies to SuperBowl #GOPdebate make my point.
