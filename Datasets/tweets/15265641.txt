@PoliticoCharlie @politico @BernieSanders Thanks for engaging. I thought I was clear in quoting facts directly from Politico...to say this story shouldn‚Äôt have been published as is. Not 1 fact undercut Sanders camp assertion. Better headline: Clinton camp still bitter at Sanders. Makes scurrilous claims to undermine him.
RT @danielmarans: Thread critical of Politico's story on Bernie's charter flights. https://t.co/FPCBVqv3Ap
RT @cenkuygur: Please read whole thread here to see how establishment media works hand in hand with establishment politcians to target @Sen‚Ä¶
P.S. Fun fact, using Politico Playbook parlance. SPOTTED: @BernieSanders on commercial flight recently flying coach to major @NAACP speech in South Carolina. https://t.co/7C7L7uPAKN
So @Politico should be honest. The REAL (legit for publication) story is some Clinton people are still bitter enough to try to undermine @BernieSanders in this moment. Anti-unity. But it can be reported in the context of debunking their petty snipes. Instead, #BadMediaPrecedent.
Was also hypocrisy argument: How could someone fighting climate change &amp; inequality fly CHARTER? Yet ‚ÄúThe Clinton campaign itself spent a total of $15.9 million on jet charter‚Äù and nobody, including reporter, raised hypocrisy. Can Bernie not order a book on @Amazon either?
Further buttressing Sanders, the piece grants that in the entire 2017-2018 cycle, ‚Äúhis Senate campaign committee spent $342,000 on Apollo Jets...primarily to pay for a nine-day, nine-state tour to support Democratic candidates." So‚Ä¶the entire rest of the two years, no charters.
There's also innuendo Sanders spent other people's money extraneously. But Sanders camp gave DNC $100,000 to defray his participation in their 2017 unity tour &amp; spent $342,000 mostly on a 9-day tour helping 2018 candidates. Seems like very real skin in the game...helping others.
In the part of the story where you‚Äôd expect a rebuttal from Clinton camp, it was this (petty) nonsequiter: ‚ÄúTo the Clinton staff, however, the issue of the senator and the private jets became so cumbersome that it turned into ‚Äòa running joke in the office.‚Äô" So...what...
Not 1 fact undercutting @RaniaBatrice: ‚ÄúAt no point did I ever say ‚Äòhe has to have a private plane for the sake of [it]‚Ä¶requests for a charter only came after the schedules were put in front of us. If a less rigorous schedule were put in front of us, [no charter needed]."
Was there any a single fact in the entire story that undercut the idea that he only traveled private when commercial wasn't doable? One example saying ‚ÄúThe campaign said X, but actually Y flight was easily available.‚Äù No. Seriously, not a single one. And it was a long story!
The instances in @DLippman‚Äôs story when a private jet was used were all seemingly rigorous trips: ‚Äú39 rallies in 13 states on behalf of Clinton‚Äôs campaign" 17 events in final week. 2017 DNC unity tour several states, several days. 2018: ‚Äúnine-day, nine-state tour‚Äù for candidates.
Clinton person agreed: ‚Äúour working assumption was that 90% of the time it would be commercial...If he was trying to hop from city to city in a particular state and [commercial] didn‚Äôt work, we were open‚Äù to chartering. So if NOBODY alleges commercial was doable, no story, right?
Next, let‚Äôs be clear on the the campaign‚Äôs core assertion via @AriannaiJones and @RaniaBatrice: If commercial was doable, they did it. If an ambitious campaign tour was scheduled that didn‚Äôt make commercial doable, they fly private. That only makes‚Ä¶all the sense in the world.
First, let me put my biases out on the table. I support @ewarren. And I respect writer @Dlippman professionally. I know there are tough calls journalistically sometimes. My concern here is less this one piece than the #BadMediaPrecedent for #2020Election coverage going forward.
This @Politico @Dlippman piece about @BernieSander‚Äôs flights is a concerning #BadMediaPrecedent: Someone can float a story, the facts get investigated, the campaign‚Äôs side is plausible and UNCONTESTED, &amp; the hit piece publishes anyway. More in thread ... https://t.co/VfsadE8ZhC

A gas tax is regressive by definition. If you want to fix roads or address climate, why not tax big polluters who profit off externalities?

@Tomtracyv 17) @NYCTSubway didn't respond to my Tweets asking if assaulter was captured and generally has been non-transparent with public. #Done
@Tomtracyv 16) They said nobody was injured. 100% inaccurate. Any implication of no physical violence = inaccurate.
@Tomtracyv 15) Gave my number. They never called. Then said people running had no idea what happened. Really outrageous.
@Tomtracyv 14) I called 911. Told them it happened in front of me &amp; details.
@Tomtracyv 13) Overall, hundred or hundreds of people ran out. Likely dozens hurt. In addition to person who was pushed and person in actual tussle.
@Tomtracyv 12) People yelled out people like, "There are kids!" -- meaning they were among people getting trampled.
@Tomtracyv 11) I helped lady in front of me up and she kept running. The fact that ambulance didn't see her when they arrive much later is irrelevant.
@Tomtracyv 10) People absolutely got hurt. One lady fell right in front of me and hit her head on a trash can. People fell and got trampled on.
@Tomtracyv 9) When I was in a new car a few down, I noticed a few people run by. Then more. And more. Eventually my entire car started running out.
@Tomtracyv 8) My guess is she did not have a gun or knife, but rather a sharp object. I would have noticed something shiny.
@Tomtracyv 7) I didn't see the fight close up. Or how it resolved. But it was physical, zero doubt. I hope nobody was hurt.
@Tomtracyv 6) As I was stepping out, I looked right. She was in a scuffle with someone. Critical mass of crowd was crowding in near her.
@Tomtracyv 5) She then walked the other way down the car. Train pulled to next stop. Bunch of people in my area started leaving to get in new car.
@Tomtracyv 4) Two ladies sitting in front of me said, "She had a weapon." I was surprised, hadn't looked at her left hand, but that's where it would be
@Tomtracyv 3) She then turned to me and said, "Repeat that. Repeat that. R-E-P-E-A-T." I didn't. She said, "I thought so" and turned in other direction
@Tomtracyv 2) That guy looked stunned. She got in his face and likely pushed again. I said, "Whoa! Whoa!"

.@kmthurman @creynoldsnc The word insider is irrelevant. The point is One candidate will be more effective than the other at winning.
.@kmthurman @creynoldsnc you are missing the point. One is establishment pick. One can connect the DNC to the grassroots.

@mikel1814 @kmthurman K. Good night, guys. Kevin, you're a good person. Mike...I'm sure you are too. :)
Sanders was making a broad point. A legit critique. Clinton can say she's like Obama, not Wellstone. Leave him out. https://t.co/ejCPsLnqny
Obama sided w/ corporations many times. Fair to question him. Fair of Clinton to say she's like Obama. Not Wellstone https://t.co/kPXo9uOwjC
.@mikel1814 @kmthurman She (and you) are using a hypertechnicality to debunk a real concern -- and politicizing Wellstone. Not. Ok.
.@mikel1814 @kmthurman But invoking Wellstone to imply it's crazy to question Obama and Clinton (extensive pattern) of decisions is not ok.
.@mikel1814 @kmthurman, you are missing the big point here. If she wants to say Sanders broad critique would apply to Obama too, ok.

.@mikel1814 It's simply not ok to lump Obama, whose 1st term had many deals with big corporations, with Paul Wellstone - the gold standard.
.@mikel1814, @HillaryClinton implied that Obama &amp; Wellstone could both be called non-progressive. True for Obama. 100% false for Wellstone.
Not ok that @HillaryClinton said Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive by some straw man definition. Do. Not. Go. There. #DemTownHall

The state of our union includes big issues that went without mention -- from Black Lives Matter to abortion care to mass deportations. #SOTU
...expanding Social Security benefits, and major Wall Street accountability. #SOTU

.@dbernstein @laurenm &amp; yeah, Russ should not explain himself to someone clueless. Again, amusing seeing reporters confused by basics.
.@dbernstein @laurenm you discredit urself if you say it was to keep staff paid. These are talented people w/ job options. They organize.
.@dbernstein how about you look into what the DNC and other party committees spend on mail and staff? And direct donations.
.@laurenm @dbernstein right. Having someone who has no idea what they are talking about write stuff and say "let readers decide" = lazy.
@dbernstein @laurenm yes. It was wrong. It failed to even mention issue advocacy. $ spent to win &amp; change the debate also helps candidates.
.@dbernstein, @DanielBice uses old-school expectation of PAC as a PO Box. Times changed. Entire organizations with full staffs are PACS.
@dbernstein read my tweets.
BIG: @JournalSentinel customers thought they paid for newspaper. But money went to ads ABOUT the newspaper &amp; a guy named @DanielBice. #WiSen
Funny when ignorant reporters like @DanielBice have no idea how the Internet works. Feingold used "portal" called ActBlue #SoComplicated !
.@DanielBice is so quick w/ shoddy gotcha reporting that he was offered the opportunity to talk with informed people, and he refused. #WiSen
By @DanielBice's logic, groups that want to organize regular people should A) Form as something less transparent than a PAC. B) Hire nobody.
.@DanielBice ignored that @ProgressivesUtd did issue advocacy, vital organizing to help change the national debate. That's not "landing pad"

@davehill77 Great. He said fair vote. Nothing is wrong with pushing for more. See my earlier Tweets about most strategic move.
@davehill77 changed your argument. U criticized talking about collective bargaining. I asked if @WeGotEd calling for fair vote is on topic?
@davehill77 if he said he supports workers in all workplaces having a fair vote would that cover it?
@davidsirota @MikeElk Yup. Agreed. Onward. (Ok I really gotta go. Happy to continue another time. I hope someone seizes this and maximizes.)
@davidsirota @MikeElk You're talking about effective pressure. I'm saying keep going. If other 4 match Ed, this fight is more on the radar.
@JOBarrois I hear you. There are legit critiques. My narrow point is that this is an organizing opportunity. This is leverage with other 4.

@davidsirota I hear you. Not defending that. I'm making a narrow point. If all 5 hosts say what Ed said, that's good. It's an opportunity.
@davidsirota @MikeElk @WeGotEd See prior Tweet. Lot of unfortunate shots. Question is whether that is your focus or union is your focus.
@MikeElk @davidsirota @WeGotEd Maybe it's too late &amp; the insult will prevail. On the substance, if all 5 hosts say what Ed said, helps union
@MikeElk @DavidSirota @WeGotEd -- knowing all 3 of you, I wish any personal credibility insults were not part of this. It's clouding things.
@MikeElk think that is full clip. Was opening. Might want to check website of show on that date for anything else. PS Hi, Mike. :)
@davidsirota We are alligned on principle. As an organizer, I see leverage. If all 5 hosts say what Ed said, that helps workers.
@KirkM0rris @davidsirota @MikeElk @AFLCIO see my Tweet to Sirota. 2 separate issues. For any organizer, Ed's statement is leverage. Use it!
@davidsirota Point taken, but separate issue. I don't forget Schwartz's positions on some issues when thanking her for leverage vs Third Way
@TyHealey you will be getting an email today from the point on this. Thanks for getting in touch!
@JOBarrois What?

Great news that @BarackObama is seeking congressional approval for military action. Great down payment on norms and order being restored.
