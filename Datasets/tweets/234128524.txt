On October 30, Secretaries Mattis &amp; Pompeo called for a ceasefire in 30 days. Deadline was November 29. Yet, Saudi airstrikes continue. It is not in our national security interests to do nothing when Riyadh clearly and directly ignores our Secretaries of Defense and State.
Today in #SFRC, the administration’s nominee to serve as Ambassador to Yemen said the civil war has exacerbated the world’s largest food security emergency, created power vacuums that terrorists have exploited, facilitated Iran’s ambitions, and complicated our CT efforts.

Based on that history and those facts — as well as our national security interests and our humanitarian principles – I plan to support the Sanders/Lee resolution (SJRES 54) today.
Unfortunately, the administration has failed to fully utilize the leverage I have provided, and today’s briefing raised more questions than it answered.
Since March of 2017, I have worked to give the administration leverage with the Saudis to accomplish these outcomes. We must use all of that leverage immediately.
I have studied the situation in Yemen as closely as anyone in the Senate, &amp; I believe the best way to oppose Iran in Yemen &amp; stop ballistic missile attacks on our partners is to bring all parties to the negotiating table, end the civil war, &amp; address the humanitarian crisis.
I’m heading to the @SenateFloor shortly to discuss my reaction to today’s #Yemen briefing with Secretaries Pompeo and Mattis. https://t.co/EaaHtjFqg3

We need to use all available leverage to compel both sides to pursue good faith and urgent diplomatic efforts to end the civil war in Yemen.
The administration’s NDAA Section 1290 certification is not consistent with these facts:  https://t.co/DApUvEd9U7.  I look forward to responses from the administration to our letter: 	https://t.co/f05j1JoakM
He says, “The parties to the conflict continue to violate international humanitarian law. Since late May, more than 5,000 separate violations have been recorded, including mass civilian casualties and destruction or damage to critical civilian infrastructure…”

I applaud the decision by @stevenmnuchin1 to skip the Future Investment Initiative summit in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh will struggle to achieve their economic &amp; investment goals if they don’t end their pattern of reckless &amp; immoral foreign policy actions (e.g. Khashoggi &amp; Yemen). https://t.co/95ZvSzwSnt
The Khashoggi murder and actions in Yemen are both part of a pattern of immoral and reckless behavior by Saudi Arabia. Here's an op-ed that I published on this topic with @SenatorShaheen in the @WashingtonPost last month:  https://t.co/XavTA4lGIM

If the administration cannot credibly make the NDAA Section 1290 certification, it is time to end U.S. refueling of Saudi coalition aircraft engaged in the civil war in Yemen.
I look forward to Secretary Pompeo’s response to my October 10 letter, clarifying his certification in response to the provision I and @SenatorShaheen included in the defense bill: https://t.co/f05j1JoakM
America’s basic and fundamental values demand a suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I continue to believe that Secretary Mnuchin should not attend the investment conference in Riyadh next week.
We have seen a pattern of reckless behavior by the Saudi Crown Prince, including in Yemen where Saudi Arabia has engaged in gross violations of human rights and helped cause the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
ICYMI: Last night, I discussed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the humanitarian crisis in Yemen with @CNN’s @JakeTapper. The murder of Khashoggi is absolutely outrageous. The American people will not stand by idly as journalists are murdered. https://t.co/5VIZzSBoQe

I do hope the press attends in order to discern which stakeholders are there who seem oblivious to Riyadh's actions in Yemen and alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi. #FII2018

John will be remembered for many things. His quick wit, his great passion, &amp; showing that often times we need to be inspired by people who are prepared to set politics aside and do the right thing, at the right time, for the right reasons – That’s John McCain.
Americans and millions of individuals around the world are safer and more free because Senator McCain rightly pushed successive administrations of both parties to lead and engage on the world stage from a position of strength and principle.
Having served with John is one of the great honors of my life. He embodied what the Naval Academy is all about: “Not self, but country.”

In addition to being a highly respected jurist and an eminently qualified legal scholar, Judge Kavanaugh is also a devoted husband, father and coach of his two daughters’ basketball team.
When I sat down with Judge Kavanaugh last month he struck me as a man of great character and integrity. He answered questions directly, spoke forthrightly, and demonstrated a strong intellect and a deep humility.

If the war continues, millions of additional Yemenis may find themselves on the verge of famine, creating fertile ground for terrorist recruitment. I look forward to this provision becoming law and carefully monitoring compliance.
The #NDAA sent to @POTUS includes the important Yemen provision I worked to include along with @SenatorShaheen (Section 1290). It will provide the administration additional leverage and will hold our security partners accountable to their commitments.
Our national security interests and humanitarian principles demand that we press the combatants in Yemen to engage in urgent &amp; good faith negotiations to end the conflict that has helped create the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

Sen. Donnelly is a nice guy.  But as one of his constituents, I urge him to reconsider his position and allow debate on House bill.
He also said he's frustrated Congress isn't doing its job on immigration...but yet still votes to block Congressional debate on immigration.
In November, Sen. Donnelly said President didn't have that authority. http://t.co/5zbCmNjp7Z

Overall, disappointed the President stuck to the old familiar script and missed the mark once again #SOTU
The #ObamaCare29ers provision is causing millions of hourly workers across the country to see their hours and wages cut.
The President should offer new solutions to improve current policies which are failing American, such as the 30-hour provision in #Obamacare
The President needs to embrace the bipartisan approach to #taxreform, not just reforms to the corporate code #SOTU

A modern tax code means #smallbiz to large companies can expand, hire &amp; increase take-home pay for American workers
We need #TaxReform so we can lower tax rates for American families &amp; grow the economy #SOTU
Policies that will lead to more jobs &amp; higher wages: #TaxReform and #TPA4USJobs
The President should focus on how to strengthen the economy &amp; create jobs for Americans #SOTU
Issues that need addressed: #Obamacare, our national debt, jobs &amp; unemployment, #taxreform, and our economic recovery. #SOTU
The President needs to embrace this opportunity to reach across the aisle #SOTU
We need the President’s specific solutions to challenges facing our country, not the same old rhetoric #SOTU
I’m looking forward to the President’s #SOTU, hoping that he will give the American people the answers they deserve.

@JNSammons today I voted to express the need to allow furloughed military chaplains to provide religious services during the gov’t shutdown
I also voted to express the need to allow furloughed military chaplains to provide religious services during the gov’t shutdown
Some of you may disagree, but please keep comments civil out of respect for fellow Hoosiers &amp; their families who are furloughed currently.
Proud of the unanimous vote to pay furloughed workers, and I hope to see the Senate act quickly on this measure
Our furloughed federal workers didn’t ask not to come into work this week, and they shouldn’t have to worry about missing a paycheck
The measure passed today will help folks at places like the Census Bureau in Jeffersonville and civilian DOD employees at Crane

What does a partial government shutdown mean?  Our FAQ: http://t.co/SoRWrx5iKg
Plenty in this resolution that members of both parties can support, and I hope we see more bipartisanship than we’ve seen in recent days.
As a matter of fairness, the package also ensures members of Congress aren’t given special treatment when it comes to purchasing health ins.
This time, package includes a one-year delay of the individual mandate tax. This is identical to a bill I authored and House passed in July.
For 3rd time in just over a week, I will vote for proposal to avoid a shutdown and keep the government funded at a responsible level.
