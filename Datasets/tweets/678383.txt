Nojeim (#patriotact event): If an NSL is used to get data about you, it doesn't go to you. The people it goes to have no incentive to act.
Nojeim (#patriotact event): we don't tell people that to speak you ahve to wait a year.
we don't tell people that to speak you ahve to wait a year.
McNeil (#patriotact event): Gag orders: We don't knock on the terrorists door and tell them that "Hey, we're surveiling you".
McNeil (#patriotact event): We're still in danger and that's my point in bring up all these threats.
audience (#patriotact event): What a snowstorm! "Shoe bomber"? "Printing boarding passes in library"? Not relevant.
Samp (#patriotact event): points out that the FISA Amendment act di add judicial oversight. I hope you will join me in applauding
Samp (#patriotact event): latest version of the law has a special provision to make it impossible to do any library investigations.
Samp (#patriotact event): People want to get rid of the whole thing are the ones calling sec 215 the library provision
Samp (#patriotact event): People don't want to try to use a law & fail cause it will look bad. That's why they didn't use the existing laws.
McNeil (#patriotact event): We don't use the Pres's Nuclear Football. Not using something says nothing about importance.
McNeil (#patriotact event): The USA PATRIOT act is a good framework. It has adequate safeguards, and they'd do it anyway w/o it
McNeil (#patriotact event): I have a problem when the people who say "we just want to improve it" also hate it & want it gone
Nojeim (not Samp) (#patriotact event): There is a whole document about mistrust of the gov't. It's called the Constitution. That's the point
Samp (#patriotact event): There is a whole document about mistrust of the gov't. It's called the Constitution. That's the point.
Samp (#patriotact event): Sneak and peek number don't bear out the need for new laws for terror. 99.5% of sneak peek not used for terrorism!
@normative (#patriotact event): You cannot meaningfully oversee a quarter million NSLs. You cannot count on backend oversight.
@normative (#patriotact event): serious enough threat without level of inflation we get in some of these discussions
@normative (#patriotact event): USA PATRIOT Act would not have improved the visual accuity of the people who saw sum1 lighting his shoe.
@normative (#patriotact event): why in Mousavi would they have used "Lone Wolf" when they didn't use the powers that they then had.
@normative (#patriotact event): Mousavi, the issue wasn't a lack of laws. FISA could have been used a crimnal warrant could 2.
Samp (event): fact is that sneak and peek provision has been in place long before the #patriotact was adopted. SCOTUS in Dalia said its OK
Samp (#patriotact event): if you provide support for Hamas, even designated for their humanitarian activiites it frees resources for terror
Samp (#patriotact event): important to have discussions of this sort. If we pass the law as currently proposed, will be sunsetted
Samp (#patriotact event): The Feingold law would hamstring the material support provision. It is a very important part of that law.
Samp (#patriotact event): The Dept. of Justice is in favor of renewal without these additional limitations, and they know the secret stuff
Samp (#patriotact event): There are already a lot of safeguards and the support of the Obama administraion is evidence that they suffice
Samp (#patriotact event): Lone wolf would have allowed fater access to the records of Mousavi
Samp @Catoinstitute #patriotact event: potential 4 abuse doesnt require layers of bureaucracy 2 slow down LE & invest, perhaps dangerously.
McNeil @Catoinstitute event: The cost of tinkering #patriotact is that it changes the law and confuses or demoralizes law enforcement
McNeil @Catoinstitute event: claims that many #patriotact processes have more limits than what is required in a criminal setting
McNeil #patriotact event: judiciary signifanct source of oversight. All sorts of provisiosn to make sure these things aren't blank checks
McNeil @Catoinstitute #patriotact event: lone wolf lack of use is evidence that lawmakers aren't overusing.
McNeil @Catoinstitute #patriotact event: claims that FIS requires "probable cause".
Mcneil @Catoinstitute #patriotact event: section 215, business records provision, helps track day to day actions of terroirst networks
