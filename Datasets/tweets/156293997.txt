I don't know if I agree, but it's a refreshing perspective. Football is a tough game to sell in a modern, knowledge-filled world. There's still a ton that's unknown about the brain, but still SO MUCH that we know today compared to 10, 20, or 30 years ago.
The big takeaway was the optimism. It wasn't negativity. Dr. Anderson said he thinks the game will change, evolve, and at the end of the day it will likely survive.

Clinton St. in Seneca Falls has been shut down near the Fall St. intersection due to falling bricks from the Women's Interfaith Institute. There was a fire there several years ago, and a group has been fighting for funding to restore the property. https://t.co/EGEfjFmCbQ
In the past, Seneca County has been overshadowed by larger ones. A platform like this could turn the tables and level the playing field - so communities in rural, economically depressed places get their fair share of funding and opportunities to fix the problem.
It's called ODMAP, and allows for real-time reporting of overdoses by first responders, public health officials, law enforcement, and other authorized individuals who are 'on the ground'. It's a game changer for small communities that have struggled to accumulate data.
I don't often get to work on multi-part pieces like this one, but when the chance presents itself - I take it. Happy that it was to talk about an issue as important as these. The third part is the most-exciting. It dives into a program that could be making its way to Seneca.

Because the goal posts are constantly moving. And being successful doesn't mean a 2 or 4 year degree anymore. It hasn't for a while. A lot of higher education needs to be reimagined, especially in places where economic forces are having an impact.
Supporters say it would ensure there'd be no money owed if no money was earned. Opponents of the proposal call it 'mandatory wage garnishment'. Yet we're still not going to talk about the cost of higher education, and the actual value of that education in the long-term.

It's worth noting that the Board of Supervisors has struggled mightily to come to any agreement on this front. Now though their hand will be forced. I'll be reaching out to Supervisors today. Will share their takes as they arrive in my inbox.
My story on what these reports and DEC investigation uncovered: https://t.co/l2rbwFrqe0
Fines could reach $37,000 per day, if the County does not follow proper protocol moving forward in responding quickly to what the DEC characterizes as serious safety/water quality issues.
Damning report from the DEC re: two sewer districts, and the proposed consolidation of them in Seneca County. Sewer moratorium imposed until further notice in Sewer District #1 and #2. Response from Seneca is due to DEC by end of March. https://t.co/fy5OcyfDu3

I was also the DD. So I was 100% sober for the entire experience, which was interesting - for reasons I did not expect.
Oh, and going back to whatever they did last year. Two people we were with this year had been last, and said it was MUCH better then. Fewer attendees, more venders, better organization seemed to be the three components that made last year better from their perspective.
Six of us arrived at 5:45 and stayed until 9:30. We waited in line for 80-85 percent of that total time spent there. Most people I noticed who weren't waiting in line looked lost and confused. Refunds for this 'festival' would probably be appropriate. https://t.co/xXnSFnGgr3

There has been some great reporting, and great action out of the communities that would be impacted by the closure of that PY unit. But, that doesn't change the fact that as a region we need to do better. Collectively, we just need to do better.
My column in the @FLTimes addressed one concern I have with proposed closure of PY unit. They say underutilization is the main issue. Well, why is it when something is underutilized we ask "Why do we do this?" instead of "Why is this underutilized?" https://t.co/qkmO22RHcf
And that's in addition to continued expansion of services offered by the County and Margaret's department. They're doing so much with so little; and people genuinely don't realize how much of an impact they're having. In 2018, they treated thousands. Had over 10,000 appointments.
We talked about efforts to remove stigma, but the biggest takeaway from the conversation was that systemic change is necessary to deal with issues connected to it like transportation, quality affordable housing, etc.
Caught up this week with Margaret Morse, Director of Community Services for Seneca County. We talked about the proposed closure of a behavioral health unit in Penn Yan owned by Finger Lakes Health, latest data re: suicide/substance use disorders, and more. https://t.co/qxLJPW24fK

@RobertHarding Agreed. Been commuting from Brighton (46) to Seneca Falls (41) for almost two years; and it's amazing how fast things change west of 46. I'm sure trucking companies would not approve of that 'complete' policy, though. Even though it makes complete sense for unique situations.
@RobertHarding @m_jfrench Sounds like the nuclear option. Seems reasonable though. Could also try physical barriers. Keep hearing people say it's the only way to maintain safety.
@RobertHarding @m_jfrench Agreed. Can't imagine it'll get any easier when they take the human element completely out of the Thruway (via cashless toll). Might be able to track violators easier that way, but to prevent accidents ... could just get harder to enforce without having lots of police.

@RobertHarding @m_jfrench My thought was that most were coming from well-outside the ‘closed’ portion. They probably should’ve had a state trooper, or several, posted up at the 46 off-ramp, so those that continued beyond that point could be stopped (and presumably ticketed).

@themariaeliz Fair point. Small businesses doing it in good faith is much different than massive corporations using it as a recruiting/advertising tool.
@themariaeliz Is that the case across all spectrums of work? LinkedIn comes to mind. Really it's become a form of 'free' advertising for employers. And if that's the benefit the company sees from forcing employees to be 'on' all the time - then is pulling the plug on social the only fix?
Great points here. Especially important given that the process to unravel this issue may be more difficult than just fixing the problem. https://t.co/x18vR2PubD
@themariaeliz That's a GREAT point. Now the big question: Can it be fixed?! How does that process even BEGIN?
@themariaeliz Social media may make it worse! But, I'm genuinely curious: Do you feel it's more directly tied to specific work environment, or the 'whole' of a job/career?
After some additional thought, maybe this piece is a little too dark. Perhaps more of a 'work environment' issue. https://t.co/h1kfYn1BfL
Awesome! No understating how important this conversation will be. It's an issue in small, rural communities, too.

Some post-podcast thoughts on this whole topic, program at SFCSD, and more. https://t.co/Jf7cpNZb9m
Students are more engaged, more ready, and more knowledgeable about the world around them than they're given credit. These kids understand what's at stake, and they're ready to take the steps necessary to be part of the solution by being PREPARED for those steps.
This program at @SenecaFallsCSD has been widely supported by students, parents, and faculty alike. It's interesting because it goes against the notion that young people are less mature, or less ready to wrestle with tough, big topics than previous generations.
One interesting piece of feedback I received after recording this was the idea that through this program - faculty are not allowing "kids to be kids." With all of the data and information students are encountering on a daily basis - online and offline - they're into it.
For me, the real takeaway here is the prospect of engaging students with the daunting "What's next?" question BEFORE they're a senior in high school, or freshman at college. Letting students work with that question EARLIER in the process is CRUCIAL. This program proves it.

@Allovimo You're so right. Many times I've searched on various news sites, and struggled to find the thing I was looking for. Personally, I feel like I gravitate toward 'feed' style sites. Just easier to process and navigate.
@Allovimo Appreciate that. I will say, your point about experience is incredibly important. Sometimes I even wonder if content strength is second to it. People want a quick, smooth experience, and some traditional newspapers just don't get it (or choose to overlook it)
@Allovimo Also, not sure how I feel about the notion that 'websites' are dying. We've seen double-digit traffic growth, and significant gains in native traffic (not from FB) showing us that some readers are choosing website over social. (3/3)
@Allovimo To that end, newspapers who do digital at all - need to focus on user experience. Crappy, outdated websites aren't going to get traffic, and posting a minimum number of stories on that site won't  help growth either. (2/3)
@Allovimo Seems like all news organizations need to have a clear vision of what they're trying to accomplish. Simply 'doing everything' by printing and publishing online doesn't work. One of those products will always suffer. (1/3)
"I would've called a new vote had the resolution been defeated," Lazzaro said today. Noted that he just wants Town Employees, particularly department heads - to take their responsibility and 'the process' seriously.
The ball drop is still happening, the board voted 4-1 in favor of the resolution accepting the application from the owners; and Supervisor Lazzaro said his intent was never to prevent the ball drop from happening. "I wouldn't have let that happen," he told me.
Lazzaro says that's up to the police chief, and parks and rec director to sort out when organizers go through this process. The Town Board simply votes on the final product, which should include the application (clearly, neatly submitted) as well as insurance information.
Here's the application the Town Board voted on yesterday. Again, Supervisor Lazzaro has his detractors - but these documents, in his opinion, do not pass the eye test, and show a lack of care from department heads who are responsible for the process. https://t.co/YCLxA5EiwU
Now, some will call this petty. However, the application also lacked any proof of insurance. There was a sign-off that insurance existed for the event. But documentation of that was supposed to be filed with the Town; and still has not.
The application had 'issues' per Supervisor Lazzaro. He showed me the documents this morning, which were competed in multiple different types of ink, had a plethora of scribble marks on them, and for 'official' documents - just didn't pass a basic eye test.
The Board held their final meeting of 2018 yesterday. Two big issues, highlighted in this story, came out of it, but were ultimately passed. An application for the annual ball drop held downtown, as well as funds moving from the general fund to cover a shortfall in parks &amp; rec.

Seems like employees are now looking for ROI in their own work-life. Just like employers who seek out the next best thing each day. Not knocking it — but when people start to mirror their institutions — we shouldn’t blame people. They’re simply doing what’s necessary.
Especially when it means employees don’t feel a level of respect/cordial formality being returned to them.
This feels like it misses an important point. Maybe the job market is hot — but bigger issue seems to be relationship between employer/employees. When employees feel expendable they aren’t as likely to care about formal considerations. https://t.co/j7v8JFELaX

The big question is that if it burns into next year, will it have an impact on elections - for supervisors that might see terms ending in 2019, and the possibility of re-election.
Officials in Seneca believe they're now on the right path. Folks in Wayne should probably hope for a similar resolution, because this became one of the biggest stories last year.
The irony is that the 'slow pace' of these negotiations and raises is ultimately due to the negotiation process involving union(s) and a board that may only meet officially once, or twice a month. The process, like anything in government, happens at a snails-pace.
Here's the story from April 2017 when the same types of things were being discussed. Seneca was losing employees to other counties - who were, per county officials, outbidding them for personnel. The supervisors are still dealing with this problem. https://t.co/SzuEKOj8lN

This is where we are in politics and life. Polarization is encouraged, extreme views from the right and left are expected/mandatory, and most readers only want to experience an echo chamber when they read a newspaper or consume news/information in any format.
Also, isn’t it hilarious that he mashes all those writers together? If you’ve ever read any of their work - we collectively RARELY agree. Speaking for myself, I find ideological alignment with one of them, MAYBE, every few months.
Hate to break it to this guy, but I’ve been searching for those voices for longer than he has - because I do this for a living.

Turned the entire budget debate into 'Landfill vs. No Landfill' and not about dollars-and-cents of services, which are not typically offered by 'Towns'. The only communities with comparable services are local cities and villages, which both have significantly higher tax rates.
In short: The tax rate will stay approx. the same ($8.71 per $1,000 assessed), but the Town didn't make any meaningful cuts to the budget - and didn't accept a significant offer from Seneca Meadows Landfill (worth $100M) - thus creating a vacuum on the board.

It introduces a new world of problems for that community, which could take years to correct; and cost an exceptional amount of money to fix. (10/10)
We had been hearing reports from Town employees and officials, off the record, and on the record - that core documents/records that auditors were requesting could not be found at the time. If the formation of those committees were not filed, or recorded properly (9/10)
But for those keeping score at home: This is about SO MUCH MORE than preservation of an old building now. This is about the Town's management, again, which is important because the Town is STILL under an audit from the NYS Comptroller's Office. (8/10)
TO AND FROM the Town itself - DO NOT have legal standing, then it opens a can of worms this community, and others, might not have ever seen. Town Attorney Foster painted a very bleak picture, and later I'll be editing down a highlight reel of his comments from yesterday. (7/10)
The Town of Seneca Falls is viewed as 'having problems' now given the fight that's happening legally and 'on the ground' over a landfill, property taxes, and future direction. But, if a court finds that the core committees that have driven business (6/10)
But one of the items laid out in the Article 78, is the accusation (which seems to be backed up by the Town's lack of documentation on the matter) that the HPC (and other committees - like planning and zoning) may not have been legally filed when the Village dissolved. (5/10)
If you want to know about the personality conflicts, I suggest watching the video at the earlier shared link. There are lots of officials who disagree on the future use of the building, perceived/real conflicts of interest, and much more. (4/10)
Everyone has a different opinion on that matter re: the former Peter Koch Chrysler building on Fall St. It's either an exceptional piece of history, or a run down, defeated eyesore. Circle K has plans to demolish it after purchase from Koch, who filed the Article 78 (3/10)
Judge Doyle ruled that the Town Board need to seek outside legal counsel for the HPC, so that they can be appropriately represented in the Article 78, which involves an 'historic' building that is either near condemnation, or ripe for historic, economic development. (2/10)
SENECA FALLS THREAD: The Town Board met on Friday in a special session to respond to a court order, involving an Article 78. Essentially the Heritage Preservation Commission, which serves at the pleasure of the Town Board, denied representation from the Town's Attorney. (1/10)

The Town is expected to vote on the 2019 budget, and another tax increase for property taxpayers on November 14 at 3:30 pm.
As I've reported, the Town is spending beyond its means; using landfill money as a way to keep 'the ship' afloat. Whether the landfill closes in 2025, or 2038 - it will eventually close - and for those worried about the future - this is where the rubber meets the road.
Of course, this all partly tied to the debate around Seneca Meadows Landfill. Some trying to make it black-and-white, but there is plenty of nuance. The Town has a spending problem, which is separate of the concerns around a new host agreement with Seneca Meadows.
The Seneca Falls Town Board didn't vote on a budget, but the room was at capacity when our videographer arrived. The public hearing was packed with residents voicing concerns about taxes. https://t.co/naCu349DkW

Until I have good confirmation on the details, and we hear back on a couple FOIL requests - I won't be naming names. But, for those who are concerned about local government, transparency, and doing things right - this is being looked at closely. #StayTuned! (4/4)
Some who have applied for positions in the recent past in Seneca Falls say the process is being skipped over to favor the contractor, who has done work for individual Town Board members. One board member in particular has been named. (3/4)
Several readers with knowledge of the internal workings of the Town say that a 'pay to play' situation is happening. A contractor is being 'offered' a job, or work, which is subject to civil service.. (2/4)
Interesting situation playing out in Seneca Falls; and since it's been a while that I've addressed the Town, and Election Day is passed - I'll jump on the opportunity. It seems there are some questions about civil service exams being circumvented by the Town Board. (1/4)

@snowcones Beyond the obvious differences politically between NY and TX; it seems really interesting that the net result (poor turnout) is an issue that clearly crosses party lines, but is regularly tied to one, or the other - depending on the listening/viewing audience.
through this batch of information and report - but it seems genuinely interesting. Especially with all of the talk about the LLC loophole. (2/2)
This one feels most-interesting to me. NY ranked among the highest, per-adult contributors to political campaigns - but in all other rankings, is among the lowest for actual involvement (read: voting). There are probably factors I'm not thinking about right now glazing (1/2) https://t.co/pO1Mq51n3Z
https://t.co/kdFQRXJm2O
It probably shouldn't be surprising, but does raise some real questions about our electoral process, especially as folks discuss popular vote vs. the electoral college. Seems to be a reasonable assumption that these folks don't feel their vote 'matters' in states like NY, TX, CA.
@helensmomma @wallethub Yeah, it's interesting. I'm not surprised by the ranking (44) at all. We see poor turnout year-after-year, and local elections are even worse. You know, those races with 3-7K people living there; and only a few dozen turning out to vote for something like, mayor.
NY ranks #44 on the list. Scores based on a variety of factors, like voter registration, past turnout, etc. Seems particularly interesting that three of the largest states in the U.S. ranked in the bottom 4, for turnout in #Decision2016.

Says situation made department recognize 'weaknesses' in detention systems. "We have come up with some preventative measures to keep this from happening again and will be modifying our restraint systems."
On officer safety in a situation like this: "As you can imagine a cornfield in Fall is an Officer Safety nightmare because of the limited visibility and endless blind corners."
Cleere says the drone that investigators used was a 'major asset'. "We have several people trained and certified to fly the drone so there's almost always someone who can fly it. We were told that a helicopter was unavailable because of high winds."
"A situation like this is extremely volatile. The suspect was a dangerous violent felony offender and the risk to the public was on the back of everyone's mind.  The area that was secured was fairly large being a cornfield that borders Rt 96, Rt 414 and Bromka Road."
He notes that E-911 had begun the Hyper-Reach process to warn local residents, but ultimately the suspect was taken into custody before it went live.
Referring to 911 Center staff: "They also can be key in keeping the scene organized--similar to what an air traffic controller would do. They often get overlooked in the important role they play."
"These are also the types of situations where you see the benefit of all the ongoing training. Sheriff Luce is huge on training and has increased our training hours significantly since being elected."
"Everyone worked together under the direction of our Criminal Investigation Unit Lt. Tim Thompson. [He] is an experienced commander and established a Command Post and perimeter within minutes. In these situations having an experienced Commander on scene makes all the difference."
Undersheriff Cleere: "I am amazed and proud at how fast and professional our officers were bringing this under control. Every officer dropped what they were doing and responded."
Just received a lengthy update from Undersheriff John Cleere on today's incident. Here's a mugshot. https://t.co/koKeOFZ9wp
Wilson was apprehended a second time, during which he violently resisted - but was taken into custody and is being held at the County Jail.
The scene on Green St. in the former village was brought under control, and about an hour later at the Seneca County Correctional Facility - Wilson broke his hands/wrist to escape handcuffs. He fled the jail and wound up in a nearby cornfield.
Robert Wilson, 43, of the Elmira area was first sought in Ovid, which led to investigators making their way to Seneca Falls - where he was thought to be. When they arrived there Wilson jumped from a second story window and violently resisted arrest.

And when young people see elected officials winning races in rural communities where maybe only a few dozen people cast a vote - the reaction isn't ever "OMG I SEE THE VALUE IN MY VOTE / POWER TO MAKE CHANGE!" It's ALMOST ALWAYS skepticism about that institutional structure.
Young people feel it in politics. They (elected leaders) want 20-something's money, time, and property tax dollars (if they own a home) - but when it comes to allowing for engagement in politics - they're often 'iced out'.
Our 'institutions' are not very good at engaging young people. Especially in non-urban areas. Pretty sad but a local, rural IDA just scheduled workshops to address (among other things) young people living, and engaging in the local economy.

Here's my recap from the night's meeting. Obviously the big news is that the host agreement items were ripped right off of the agenda, last minute, at the direction of the Supervisor. Will be interesting to see where things go now. https://t.co/XmjmdSwzY8
@racheljweil I think it's just the way he talks, but the optics of it aren't ideal.
Supervisor Lazzaro advised that his attorney said to remove all landfill related items from the agenda. And that motion was seconded and unanimously passed. So ... no host agreement vote or discussion will happen now.
Takeaway from the session is that residents want more information on the Hazard Mitigation Plan. Particularly they seem interested about how it could be related to issues like sewer expansion or the landfill.
Speakers are talking about SMI and host agreement; not the mitigation plan, and Supervisor Lazzaro says the next speaker to do so will be asked to sit down.
Supervisor Lazzaro is running late, so Deputy Supervisor Ferrara started the meeting..

The 2017 books were never closed out properly/correctly; and as result - it's going to cost taxpayers in Seneca County upwards of $140,000 for an audit that never should've been necessary. That's reality here. The supervisors said they're looking for a cover up.
Speaking of that audit: Ways &amp; Means determined that it's cost taxpayers $68,000 more than the original price tag to 'make things right' for Seneca County. Things were so bad that numbers weren't even being plugged into the appropriate places on balance sheets.
Those two officials are former County Manager John Sheppard and former Finance Director Brandi Deeds. The supervisors openly spoke of malfeasance, and noted that this will go well-beyond the existing financial audit that's taking place; and costing taxpayers dearly.
So this is easily the biggest story to come out of the Seneca County BOS meeting tonight. The Ways &amp; Means Committee voted unanimously to form a special committee to investigate two former officials. https://t.co/tNgltz3LlU
If it passes the full board, the resolution and a letter will be sent to state legislators - such as @PhilPalmesano @GOPLdrBrianKolb and @SenatorHelming.
Both said something needed to be done. Lazzaro called it “selling” their training, paid for by NYS, to an “illegal police force,” which they believe should not exist.
The resolution passed unanimously. Now will go before the full board at their next session in Ovid. Supervisors Hayssen and Lazzaro led the charge on the resolution.
The Indian Affairs Committee just passed a surprise resolution requesting that any retired state police working for the CIN’s newly formed security force have their pensions revoked by NYS.

The @RedCrossWCNY will be opening a shelter up in Ovid this morning. Details still being sorted out, but will help those impacted by intense flooding in South Seneca.
The Red Cross is working on a temporary shelter. Dispatchers suggesting that it might be in Ovid-area. Will keep updating here.
We've got water rescue crews/equipment working from Border City, Romulus, the Sheriff's Office, and now Trumansburg. Sheriff's Office is getting visual lead from lake for crews 'on shore'.
Trumansburg Water Rescue is being requested, but their route to impacted area will be difficult, per dispatchers. Special instructions being given to get those first responders in.
First responders are now requesting water rescue equipment from Tompkins County to Sheldrake Point.

New reports now coming in for people trapped on top of a camper. Trying to get location pinned down. Romulus Zodiak 2 heading to 'just south of the Point' for another rescue.
County Road 131 and Combs Road - standing water, reported 'minor' flooding. Again, avoid the entire South Seneca area unless absolutely necessary.
That person has a 'serious laceration' to the arm. First responders are coordinating routes to get that person to the hospital.
They got to the patient, who was apparently inside a camper that was swept away earlier by moving water. She is conscious but has lacerations.
That ambulance is going to Lodi State Park. Trying to decipher how they will get there. The ambulance is coming from Lodi.
Ambulance being called out now for person in the water. Unclear what the circumstances are but the first responder just called for the ambulance to 'arrive as quick as possible'.
Several people were just rescued off of the roof of a camper, which was reportedly 'coming apart'. Couldn't get a precise location on that report, but those folks are safe. Most of the action right now seems to be focused in Sheldrake Point area.
State Route 89 is completely impassable, per dispatchers.
Let's add County Road 141 to that list, as well, in Interlaken. And first responders are now saying State Route 89 is 'under water' in South Seneca. Couldn't get a precise location on that one.
County Road 150 is closed/impassable. State Route 414 is closed for the next several hours. Essentially any roadway that has a running creek/body of water near/adjacent to it in South Seneca is flooded, closed, or impassable.
Flooding situation in Southern Seneca County is life threatening. Culverts are washed out, people are stuck in cottages/campers, and first responders are spread incredibly thin. https://t.co/r1A0lMEjRX

It's also important to note that the criticisms of the finance department have been real. For essentially as long as the department has existed, supervisors, employees, and others have been concerned about its leadership.
Taylor alleges that the investigation into her began after sitting passenger side of a vehicle that drove by Deeds' home in June. She handled grant writing for Seneca Co., and had to work with the finance department extensively.
Context is important here: She was involved, to some degree, in the recent-investigation into former Emergency Management Director Melissa Taylor, who was placed on administrative leave, then resigned, and now is asking to be reinstated by the BOS under their lead.

No clear reason given for the dismissal, but the investigation appears to have been going for about 4-5 days. Supervisors believe it’s connected to finance department. That’s not confirmed but would be the least surprising scenario here.

A member of the Town Board’s assessment of yesterday’s story and my choice of words. So I guess the Town Board isn’t owed, or even desires an apology, as much as the Town Supervisor does. https://t.co/Wjf73pilxy
RT @BrewCuse: @FLXJosh Seneca County has always acted like a fiefdom unto itself. Fight the good fight!
@ToddHallidy Well, three hours for one executive session, without clarification or appropriate/complete reason for entering is problematic for starters. And then, when attorneys for an unrelated matter enter the executive session - it morphs into a vague, unethical mess.
This isn't the first time I've had this type of interaction with the Town Supervisor, for those who haven't followed along. It's happened before, and I'm sure, it will happen again, because we won't substitute truth and honesty for 'conjecture'.
I do not believe that the Town Board stuck to the two items initially placed on the docket for executive session, and since I was there, can state with certainty that they had ONLY two reasons to go into executive session. And they were really, really vague.
The only fact I'm left with after yesterday's session, was that they spent three hours in executive session, only to decide that they would honor 'years of service' acquired by village employees prior to the dissolution.
@snowcones Hope you saw the second response.

RT @TheSpazman: @FLXJosh https://t.co/6ERdwmwERb
UPDATE: I will not be apologizing to our Town Board for using the words 'ramble on' to describe that session.
Yesterday I opted to use the words ‘ramble on’ to describe an executive session within a special meeting that lasted OVER three hours in Seneca Falls. They took no breaks, and possibly discussed a topic that wasn’t actually included in their original scope for exec session. https://t.co/hwN9zcXmIJ
Here we are, nearly two hours since the meeting and executive session began - still in executive session. It appears as though the board has moved onto a third, non-agenda’d item in that session.
Lawyers from the firm representing the SFPD were here, as well as representative of Barclay Damon.
Supervisor Lazzaro said there could be action taken after the exec session ends. Remains to be seen.
Here at the Seneca Falls Town Board meeting. It’s a special session. They’ve been in executive session for an hour and twenty minutes. Discussing personnel matter and contract negotiations for law enforcement.

@VinnieEsposito @NYGovCuomo @FLXFWD @STSoaring @CNYRising @I_LOVE_NY @tasteny @LocateFLX This is a tough discussion to have over Twitter. Feel free to make the journey down to our studio in Seneca Falls for a discussion on the topic. Always interested in talking 'economic development' on #InsideTheFLX.
@VinnieEsposito @NYGovCuomo @FLXFWD @STSoaring @CNYRising @I_LOVE_NY @tasteny In all, I'd agree to disagree with the broad brush you're painting with; but reserve that some good has come from the efforts (see: Geneva). @FLXFWD is a great initiative, so is @LocateFLX, but community needs must be met if real, long-term change is going to be seen.
@VinnieEsposito @NYGovCuomo @FLXFWD @STSoaring @CNYRising @I_LOVE_NY @tasteny There also needs to be an improved focus on retaining young people, which means working better with schools to evolve. It means more focus on basic trades that allow for people to start businesses, and grow as individuals in these rural settings.
@VinnieEsposito @NYGovCuomo @FLXFWD @STSoaring @CNYRising @I_LOVE_NY @tasteny The FLX may be moving forward, but individual communities are being left behind. Economic development is as simple as providing funding for infrastructure in rural communities (within the FLX) that desperately need water, sewer, and other basics to entice economic development.

The 'unsettling' postings were investigated by the school resource officer, Yates County Sheriff's Office, and school officials. The person responsible has not been identified.
Parents are concerned about the timing. The message suggests that the matter was investigated before students began getting on the bus this morning. However, a call to parents about an increased police presence wasn't made until 8:19 am.

“The time for sensible, practical action on gun violence is long overdue.” -Charles Whalen, of Geneva.
Maggie Sciria, a senior at Auburn HS talked extensively about suicide and gun laws. Pointed to the extensive number of gun deaths that are suicide.
Charles Whalen, former candidate for #NY23 is speaking now. Touching on the young children impacted by mass shootings at schools.
“We are the future of this country. And we need to fill the voice and be the change.”
“Shooting after shooting and nothing is changing.” -Kate Equinozzi, Geneva HS Junior.
A junior at Geneva High School talks about changing procedures for visitors, active shooter situations, etc. Students were instructed to stand in ultra-specific locations. “Our school was preparing for battle. A battle we should not have to prepare for.” https://t.co/Rceb5Salub

was the first speaker in favor of the Trail path.
“To me we need the infrastructure. The Ludovico Trail is a no brained,” says Paul Kronenwetter, at-large Supervisor for Seneca Falls. He
Attorney asserts that the Town Board passed a resolution on a date when a meeting didn’t happen.
Attorney representing the trail says ‘mistakes were made’ and the ‘clock needs to be turned back’. https://t.co/qZlzgIwW1d

Margaret Pusmucans, daughter of the Ludovico Trail founder says pipeline down the trail would be a ‘huge mistake’.
We have our first delay of the night. Peter Baker had to back up, and re-start on the prior slide because some in attendance couldn’t hear him. The audience member also said Baker was talking ‘too fast’.

Per Peter Baker of B&amp;L the Fall Street (5&amp;20) option was not even really considered due to State DOT ownership, how busy it is, and infrastructure there. https://t.co/LQ00WlBMUL

Opponents point out that both Fall and Bayard streets have sewer lines currently, and will likely need to be upgraded in coming years regardless. “Why introduce a third variable if the other two can be upgraded and fixed?” one resident asked at a forum on the subject in February.
Supporters of going down Ludovico say it’d be less expensive and have less of an impact on traffic with Bayard and Fall streets being the other two options for this sewage line.
Tonight I’ll be covering the public hearing on eminent domain in Seneca Falls. Turnout will be interesting. Subject is a stretch of property known as the Ludovico Sculpture Trail, and the Town would like to place a sewer line beneath it.

There is also no mention of any communities that would be impacted downwind of the proposed facility. Cayuga Lake is also effectively ignored, despite being set directly between both Seneca and Cayuga lakes.
The 'Reveille Between the Lakes' ACTUALLY serves as the 'official' newspaper of most other communities in the area. If you were looking for evidence that Circular enerG doesn't know the communities they'd be impacting - here it is.. https://t.co/zK8Fi2mRK4
I'd also like to take a moment to point out this blatant omission. @FingerLakes1 has been one of the only orgs covering this item from the start. We were NOT included in the public notice portion of the PIP. Furthermore, they wrongly identify the @FLTimes as a 'weekly' pub. https://t.co/UpjRB6gTXK

@amadufus The Five Points WWTP. The state contracted with the County years ago to manage it, but did not offload ownership.
His argument was based on an error in reporting by the Finger Lakes Times, which originally said that our website would host a proposed odor complaint system, when in fact, that is not the case. FL1 would be developing the program FOR the Town of Seneca Falls’ website.
Public speakers are finished for tonight’s meeting. Lots of discussion about incinerator, and one speaker (a regular) took an unchecked shot at FL1. Claimed the company is anti-landfill, and has exhibited a number of signs showing bias. I’ll #FactCheck this later.
Oh, and on a separate note - I'm going to be digging back into Seneca Falls. It appears as though there are some significant, outstanding issues that need to be reported. Can't let too many details out this second, but in the coming week - there will be more.
They could go back to the table and re-dream the plan, but it seems unlikely that it will happen. The theory, as much as it could be gathered, was that the wastewater from those facilities would be moved elsewhere in Seneca Co.
There was a plan being debated about possibly consolidating the three WWTP's in Central/South Seneca, but it appears as though one of them is NOT owned by Seneca Co. It also appears as though no official in Seneca Co. was aware of that fact. That facility is owned by NYS.
Tonight I'll be at the Seneca County Board of Supervisors monthly meeting. Resolution opposing incinerator on the table tonight for full-board consideration; as well as some possible debate about sewer in South Seneca.

@gewithers Clearly we'll have to continue this debate sometime on the podcast. 🤣
@gewithers It'll be fascinating to watch it play out, because if Democrats ever had an opportunity to win a tough seat -- this would be the year!
@gewithers Actual policy positions, interviews with various news outlets, events held in the district, etc.? Like what's been happening already throughout #NY23. The issue is the impact the endorsement has whether it's reported on in traditional media or not.
@gewithers It's possible. But will the environment being fostered now create the 'landslide' necessary to overcome the numbers deficit democrats face in #NY23? I mean, every candidate I interviewed admitted that winning Democrats was not going to be enough to win the general.
@gewithers Primary season shouldn't be about 'who' has endorsed a candidate. When you have a strong elected leader like @SvanteMyrick some voters will undoubtedly, blindly follow without doing their own 'due diligence' or making their own choice.
As a neutral observer of politics -- I'm also sold on allowing a process (the party agreed on) to play out. https://t.co/7l1tvIu9Sv
@gewithers And when I say you, I mean you, as an individual -- not representing what multiple Democrats have told me personally. Lol.
@gewithers You're sold on an idea then. That's not a candidate.
Frankly, I might even put together a column for the @FLTimes this coming Tuesday on the topic. There's a lot of concerning factors at play here.
Look for a story on this topic in the coming week on @FingerLakes1. Also, listen to my sit down interviews with @RickforNY23, @GoldenforNY23, @DellaPiaForNY23, AND @MitranoForNY23 here: https://t.co/puM1E8hw5A
My thought: #TrustTheProcess don't #ForceTheResult 🧐

Looks like total attendance will be well-below the max capacity of 49 since the space has seen reductions.

Explosive debate tonight re: two Environemental issues during Ag &amp; Enviro committee. First re: the incinerator, and the second re: an odor complaint headline.
Will cost around $114K if accepted as presented. https://t.co/L5hHPvA3ie
A lot of the upgrades are really updates and fixes. Definitely necessary if the County is serious about having the responsibility of the structure.
They’re saying it would take around three months to accomplish. https://t.co/Sl94XBOt43
I’m seeing unfamiliar faces, which means this is going to be a long session. At least 3-4 presentations. If I’m out before 10 pm I’ll consider myself spared.
And of course, the Ways &amp; Means committee will consider a motion to transfer upwards of 8 properties to the Finger Lakes Regional Land Bank Corporation. The blighted properties would be part of the orgs rehab efforts on behalf of Seneca County.
The Public Works Committee will discuss the possibility of constructing a new porch and sidewalk at the Three Bears complex in Ovid. This comes after last month's 'debate' around the future of the site.
State budget funding will be supported, most-likely, through a resolution advocating for the $12.8M to pay for substance use disorder services at the county jail.
The Ag &amp; Enviro Affairs Committee will consider introducing a local law to prohibit the waste-to-energy incinerator proposed by Circular enerG. That law would be largely symbolic, even if passed, because local law trumps 'County' law, as it would be here.
It'll be the first under the new 'committee structure' which was unveiled earlier this month. Here's the rundown on assignments and committees:  https://t.co/C2xzOGutS0

At any rate, March 22nd at the Seneca Falls Community Center looks like the destination for the session. Although a specific time has not been given yet.
To go through all of that, just to learn that the newspaper you use as your 'official' publication never printed the notice in the first place should make the Town reevaluate that distinction.
Of course, this happened after the meeting was scheduled, threatened to be moved, then a bizarre 'recess' option was debated and advertised with other news outlets (like ours) before the cancellation.
Supervisor Lazzaro says the Town's 'official' newspaper, which is only printed weekly, did not get the notice in last week's paper, as originally thought, which means the public hearing couldn't be legally held on March 6th. https://t.co/tenfozdD6m

To make matters worse, the Town already has a 'challenged' relationship with the community. Tomorrow I will be visiting the municipal building along with some other press getting an 'update' on the situation.
That room, which has been reduced to mere 49 person capacity is where Town meetings are held. Typically they've been drawing upwards of 80-90.
However, the very nature of the claims laid out today -- that the contractor is using a laptop valued at $150 as a 'tool' to get upwards of $3800 out of the Town definitely makes it 'sound' political.
This is interesting because that former-contractor is also a former-supervisor in Seneca County who Town Supervisor Lazzaro had PLENTY of heated differences with. Lazzaro says it's NOT political, and he doesn't want it to become such.
So due to a dispute between the Town of Seneca Falls and a former-IT contractor - the Fire Marshal has reduced the max occupancy of the Town Courtroom (where meetings are held) from 80-something to 49. (thread)

He says that there are staffing issues at play (he only has a staff of 6) and the policy needs to be followed and enforced. Peterson says it would take more staff to 'clear' downtown more further than it's being cleared presently.
He also says there a number of factors at play, as to why the snow removal process isn't as simple as it might seem on the surface. He says SF has more space to clear than other towns like Waterloo and Phelps.
He says his crews checked downtown storefronts for days before businesses and property owners had snow cleared to the curb, which is required for them to 'clear' it the rest of the way.
Will have another follow-up story to this one coming tonight or tomorrow. Finally spoke with SF Highway Superintendent Jim Peterson, who says that the 'policy' for snow removal is 'clear and works' when the community works together. https://t.co/hLQdK2CQ0E

“The world is electronic now,” that person continued. Asks for information to be conveyed in new ways that fit modern world.
“I have a tax and water bill that I can’t afford, I don’t buy a newspaper. I shouldn’t be considered ignorant because I don’t buy a newspaper,” said one audience member, who is frustrated about hearing that the Town is investing in a number of projects.
Properties have to be watched as well, per engineers. They say there are properties In town where roof drains and other (illegal) private outflows are connected to the sanitary sewer. Required policy change, per engineers.
Past grants weren’t won for these types of infrastructure issues because the treatment plant runs well, median income is too high, and the Town was not “prioritized” per the state. That’s how engineers say it goes down annually.
Audience member: “Are we just gonna keep having crap in our basements?” A lot of those in attendance tonight are frustrated because they’re living this daily.
“There’s a lot of pipes in the ground that just leak,” engineers add. Person in the audience asks if these issues are going to be addressed.
Joe Tullo, who heads water and sewer department in SF says they went from a 1M to 10M gallon outflow in an hour on Friday. Engineers say that can shift, significantly in both directions.
DEC had issued multiple alerts on Friday that there was excessive outflows from the sewer system. The EQ tank needs to be replaced and it will cost at least $3.5M.
Talking about last Friday’s weather and how that impacted and stressed the system. “It wasn’t just I Seneca Falls. That was all over New York,” engineers said.
Someone in the audience just asked how many of the projects they’re going through are budgeted this year. It won’t come out of the general fund, per engineers. It’ll come directly out of water and sewer service collection.
They’re looking to extend interconnects for emergency situations. Will improve the overall system. https://t.co/DSDLhLGpSt
Talking about some of the pipes in the system, which are upwards of 100-120 years old. https://t.co/7jB27LeyWW
Both of these projects are completed. They were worked on over the summer. https://t.co/DmNATar0UY
“We’ve had to switch some things up with treatment but that’s all.”
Blue-green algae is starting to become an issue, B&amp;L points out. They said that SF has a shallow water intake, and yet despite that our water treatment facility is in good shape.
Two public hearings scheduled for Feb. 6 Meeting. A third might be scheduled, but it’s unclear. Will depend on availability of the Towns official newspaper getting it in their publication ahead of the 10 day deadline.
And we’re underway. https://t.co/KTUusEY3uV
Now that the special meeting has been scrapped those in attendance are waiting to hear about Infrastructure. That will kickoff at 6 pm. https://t.co/WyJPKiFt8d
Foster said that meeting COULD be moved to a larger venue since there COULD be multiple hearings. Foster says that isn’t his call though. But wouldn’t be unprecedented.
There will now be upwards of three public hearings at February’s regularly scheduled meeting.
The meeting was going to be for a bond resolution on the sewer rehabilitation project. It’s a $3M project and there is a grant and bond that go hand-in-hand, per engineers.
Town Attorney David Foster says now that the meeting is being cancelled. The presentation will still take place at 6 pm.
So maybe they’re just not gonna start until 6, or they’ve scrapped the meeting altogether. At this point neither would shock me.
Still waiting for something to happen. Right now we’re 8 minutes behind schedule or I was given the wrong time by Supervisor Lazzaro earlier today. Attendance is up from the earlier ghost town we were experiencing.

@snowcones Usually typos drive me crazy. But in this situation — it was the least of my concerns.
@snowcones We need more involvement! If this prompts someone to get out and get involved — that’s a win from an otherwise sad situation.
@snowcones I’m sitting there like “wait can I only be a news person OR resident?” 🤔
RT @snowcones: .@FingerLakes1 just got "fake news"-ed https://t.co/ouTWEmJ60G
@Trapper51 In their defense (yes I’m still defending them) there are a TON of things on the policy side that need to change.
@snowcones Bold response, no?
@Trapper51 There is a business association downtown that could presumably, work together with all of the biz owners to come up with a third-party solution IF it were necessary.
@Trapper51 Yeah, don't get me wrong -- I've already spoke with three other councilors who are seriously worried about this -- and weren't aware of the policy issue. Not saying that's a resolution to the problem, BUT it's a lot better than the Supervisor's response to me.
@Trapper51 The policy, technically speaking, is "Push it to the curb" and the "Town will get to it when they can." And I realize that leaves a ton of gray area in executing the policy. But that's basically where it sits.

Collected my thoughts, and it seems Seneca Falls needs a better policy on snow removal in the downtown setting, or at the very least taxpayers need to know what the policy is so they are not left in the dark again. https://t.co/kvystWNahS https://t.co/OuCIaGeNCw
@WGRZ_SteveBrown Thanks, Steve. Appreciate the kind words. Remarkably, these little issues (with easy fixes) seem to be the hardest for policy makers to move on locally. Your words though are spot on: This region is great!

RT @snowcones: @FLXJosh "Welcome to Seneca Falls." --Albert Uticone, lifelong Seneca Falls resident, skeptic &amp; former business owner
@snowcones That prime piece of downtown property, which I believe, has sat empty since it closed last year. Imagine, a corner on a state highway, in a downtown setting -- sitting vacant for a period of a year. Sad state of affairs here.
@WGRZ_SteveBrown Property taxes just increased dramatically. I can understand the Town trying to cut costs or do things efficiently as possible. This doesn't seem like an effort in that direction, though. The Town has the resources, and it would take a couple hours, max. This isn't NYC.

Downtown parking is difficult. Parkers was taken care of in front of the restaurant, but if you didn't get a spot directly in front of the biz you had to walk on the road, or plow through a thigh-high snow bank. https://t.co/ORhpbPI7py
@snowcones "Shovel it into the roads and they'll get to it when they can," I believe, was the precise language used. Visited a bakery, which is remarkable and a MUST TRY if in the area, and that biz was the ONLY storefront cleared on the south side of downtown I could find.
@WGRZ_SteveBrown Agreed. Even harder when you're asking those shop owners (armed with shovels) to compete with state DOT plows singing down Fall St. (5&amp;20).

.@snowcones this has been the morning headache here. Does anything seem off about this situation? https://t.co/hXx9CcWx9Z
Crosswalks aren’t accessible and the shop owners have to compete with state trucks plowing snow BACK onto their sidewalks. “Shovel it into the roadway,” isn’t a good enough answer from the Town, and taxpayers deserve better.
I have a lot to say about this but with the backdrop of taxes more than doubling, the Town needs to do better when exceptional winter events take place. It would take a snow removal employee a max of 3 hours to clear the sidewalks downtown.
Downtown businesses in Seneca Falls are still not accessible more than a day removed from the winter storm. One biz was told “shovel it into the road” and they’ll get to it when they can because it’s a holiday weekend. https://t.co/7rVfPvqnU7

@dmscannell Haaa! I see what you did there.
In other words, the only reason why it was, was due to the BOS dragging it out this long.
But the supervisors marveled and quipped at how shady it was that it is happening so “last minute.”
Supervisors had a crack at this earlier in the year, BUT opted to change some salaries, which meant it came against the wire at the end of the year.
Needed 375 votes to pass — but a weighted 271 were absent, which meant they counted as “nays.”
The Seneca County BOS just voted down approx. 12 salaries for 2018 essentially for no other reason than too many supervisors left and/or didn’t show up for the meeting.

Some residents are frustrated with the process, but beyond a future decision from the RPC to say 'no' to the project -- there aren't a lot of options. It could, possibly get to referendum vote -- but that would be a long-shot.
He wants to 'trust the process' and let the planning committee make their decision.
The Town Board, in theory, could 'make' the decision for the Planning Board, and say no to the proposal, as many residents have asked, but that seems very, very unlikely given Supervisor Kaiser's position.
