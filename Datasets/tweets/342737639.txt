@LastOldCowpoke Only the political elite, leftist activist, and their minions in the media support that. You go to the average American and tell them they're car would be banned.... There would be an uproar
Just a short list of products that would be banned because they're made from oil under @AOC #GreenNewDeal #GreenNewDisaster https://t.co/GfCGPEIE1X
@henry_in_poc @AOC No she does not because she's a moron. Honestly Boston college should lose their accreditation for giving her a degree
The #GreenNewDeal should be tied to all Democrats necks to show the lunacy they're supporting 2020 is going to be a cake walk with that platform #GreenNewDisaster
This #GreenNewDisaster needs to be plastered everywhere. Cuz I can tell you the American people aren't going to go for banning cars, airplanes, and electricity #GreenNewDeal
RT @TaxReformExpert: If white privilege exists, why did Elizabeth Warren have to lie and pretend to be Native American?
So the #Democrat platform in 2020:	Infanticide 	No cars	No planes	No electricity	All modern amenities gone since oil is banned 	Basically going back to the Dark ages		Please keep running on this platform cuz 2020 will be a landslide #GreenNewDisaster #GreenNewDeal

@MattWalshBlog @AOC I'm sure that we will no longer see @AOC  ride in cars, planes, or use electricity anymore #sarc
Question if there is no electricity or cars than how can there be jobs. Well we have to go back to trades like black smithing... What an idiot @AOC #GreenNewDisaster
#GreenNewDisaster 😂😂😂 https://t.co/Oi1li17Igb
So I don't want to see @AOC ride in a car, use electricity, use anything to do with oil like plastics, electronics, computers etc , can't have those things without oil and no plane flights. Better get your walking shoes #GreenNewDeal
So @AOC plan is to take us back to the dark ages where life expectancy was early 30's and the majority of the population was starving 😂😂😂 #GreenNewDisaster

@AndyMSchneider Obama used it when he blocked visas 4 Iraqi refugees for 6 months in 2011 Jimmy Carter even used it 2 block Iran visas during hostage crisis

@JP_shirley @helganaddaf Don't know what religion she's following but I believe your suppose to stand up 4 victims who can't speak 4 themselves not ignore them

@helganaddaf Because he's a Muslim plant that's why. He takes up for Muslims while his Christian brethren are being slaughtered he's disgraceful
@helganaddaf Guess who released the leader of ISIS that's right Obama he was in a prison camp in Iraq and Obama released him
@helganaddaf Wide open for the taking. After he helped ISIS grow by taking Gadaffi out with "rebels" who ended up being terrorist
@helganaddaf And I didn't even agree with the Iraq war but at least Bush sent a force there to where it could be stabilized unlike Obama leaving it
@helganaddaf There wasn't the mass killings that are now going on in Iraq, Libya, and Syria until Obama came to office that's a #fact
@helganaddaf Obama created this mess when he destabilised the region by taking out Gadaffi &amp; trying to fight a proxy war against Assad him and him alone
@helganaddaf No it wasn't there was not a massive exodus like is going on now to Europe that only started 4 or 5 years ago so sorry can't rewrite history
@helganaddaf Then they took out Gadaffi and armed the same "rebels" that are now massacring people.
@helganaddaf So sad they went from voting to being killed by a group Obama help create and let fester https://t.co/2QdqwlQc4n
@helganaddaf Ugh under Bush it was stabilized dear there was no refugee crisis when he was in office if course Obama fucked they up

@TBRescueLady @StateDept There is no denying that those countries have terrorism problems. No denying it
@TBRescueLady @StateDept Cuz they don't want to let in terrorist elements that will cause problems in their country
@TBRescueLady @StateDept I'm pretty sure that those countries don't need the state Dept telling them whose a risk and who isn't #Fact they don't let them in

@helganaddaf @ChuckNellis What it wasn't enforced. Obama's was a travel warning and the reason why.... Cuz these countries harbor terrorist &amp; export terrorism #fact
Question if there is no risk then why does Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, &amp; Egypt even refuse to take these people #wakeup https://t.co/evmNzNWxeL
So sorry I put Americans lives first over unnecessary risk so that things like the Boston Bombing, NY bombing, Orlando shooting don't happen https://t.co/evmNzNWxeL

@SarniamakChris @StefanMolyneux @USArmy Just asked Marcus Latrell about trying to get the man who helped him escape a visa over here
@SarniamakChris @StefanMolyneux @USArmy That has already been fixed. But let's not forget that Obama blocked many people who helped our forces from getting visas
Just remember it is the @StateDept &amp; Hillary Clinton who is responsible for the mess in the Middle East &amp; helping arm ISIS #MuslimBan
Honestly it's been long over do that the @StateDept be cleaned out of the anti-American rabble who works there #MuslimBan

@chrisjlatimer https://t.co/0Mz6Wo5G2Z
@briantopping @theshoebart I sure am. No shame here
@chrisjlatimer Also Obama put a hold on Iraq also yet you said nothing https://t.co/hkPOKBqKkG

@briantopping @theshoebart Yeah my ancestors came here legally and had to go through Ellis Island and quarantine way harder than it is now....
@chrisjlatimer Yes it is where were you when Obama blocked Christian refugees from Syria..... That's right no where to be found
@briantopping @theshoebart So I guess they must be filled with hate also or they're just protecting their citizens but yet it's wrong for us to do the same
@briantopping @theshoebart I don't see you protesting middle East countries who won't even take in refugees from these countries
@briantopping @theshoebart I wonder if you'd feel different if you lost somebody in 9/11, Boston Marathon bombing, Orlando shooting, NY bombing, San Bernardino, etc
@briantopping @theshoebart No if wanting to protect my country and Americans is hateful then I fell sorry for you
