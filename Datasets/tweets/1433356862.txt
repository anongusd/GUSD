@MarcusReports @SAICinc Moraco said there was collaboration with Silicon Valley, but "I do think we‚Äôve tried to reinstill that there is innovation here on the East Coast."
@MarcusReports @SAICinc On markets: "We do see in state and local [governments] that they are a little more risk tolerant and they‚Äôre early adopters for technology,‚Äù Moraco said. "We can use state and local as a test point."
@MarcusReports @SAICinc On the government shutdown: "I don‚Äôt think the customers and strategic plans are going to change... I think there will be continuity of mission,‚Äù Moraco said, adding he doesn‚Äôt foresee a shift in their portfolio strategy.
@MarcusReports @SAICinc On personnel, Moraco highlighted an "openness for a more dispersed workforce in one way to counter the competitive challenge.‚Äù
@MarcusReports @SAICinc "The government needs to further educate the acquisition people ‚Ä¶ demonstrate that you can take those risks,‚Äù Moraco added. "Industry is trying to do our part to show we can mitigate those risks."
@MarcusReports @SAICinc On innovation at the Pentagon: "Given the mission and the risks and the demand for mission capability, the customers are all in line for what they need and what they want,‚Äù Moraco said. ‚ÄúHow they get it is up to them."

@peterwsinger @DefTechPat "If we want to get to the source of the problem, then education is key,‚Äù Vseviov says. ‚ÄúIf we do not teach the next generations how to think critically, then it doesn‚Äôt matter what the media or government does. If we lose that, we‚Äôre done.‚Äù

@peterwsinger @DefTechPat Kimmage says we're getting better at addressing these threats: "What has changed over the past year and a half is that we‚Äôre better resourced.‚Äù This is to the tune of $40 million directed to combat state actors, and as to who they‚Äôre countering, Kimmage says ‚ÄúRussia looms large.‚Äù
@peterwsinger @DefTechPat Vseviov on how to combat misinformation: "We need to stand up, point our finger at the people, organization, and regimes who are doing this and over time by publicizing the attacks, we will make our societies immune.‚Äù #DefOneSummit

@DefenseBaron ‚ÄúWe have a lot of security challenges in Europe [besides Russia],‚Äù Araud says. His list: terrorism and migration.
@DefenseBaron On Russia: "Russia is a geopolitical problem. We have to react. But we have to also look at the reality ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not going to be overwhelmed by Soviet attacks,‚Äù says Araud.
@DefenseBaron Ferguson: "European nations do have to step up. We have seen a significant increase in European defense spending. It‚Äôs starting to bear fruit, and that‚Äôs a good thing."
@DefenseBaron "For the UK, NATO is the cornerstone of security. We do see room for different types of groupings that can make a positive contribution to the collective, which from our perspective has to be NATO,‚Äù Ferguson says. "We see that NATO has never been more relevant than now.‚Äù

@CSIS @Georgetown @dandeluce Terry to Mediros: "How much is China linking its trade thing with the U.S. to North Korea?‚Äù	Medeiros: "The prospect of the U.S. reaching out to North Korea really freaked the Chinese out. So they pulled a 180, or 160, to try to pull North Korea closer."
