@larthallor Yes, I did. I adore and trust Maddow, but all I‚Äôm asking is for this question to be brought up. When you hear gop spouting, word for word these religious views from this religious org., I don‚Äôt think my worry is baseless.
@larthallor Some of our past presidents &amp; some congress members go to the Prayer Breakfasts and that‚Äôs all they do, others are introduced to people, who are basically lobbyists among other things. I just want Amy to be asked about the sponsors &amp; how she views them. That‚Äôs not divisive.
@larthallor Unfortunately, I never heard of this org. before last year. I viewed these Prayer Breakfasts as harmless until I heard that Pence was meeting w/Russian religious leaders. I looked some names up &amp; with all the misinformation, I made sure to check sources.
@larthallor https://t.co/FeRM7nB24w
@larthallor And here is Maddow‚Äôs interview with Jeff Sharlet on ‚ÄúThe Family‚Äù who sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast.
@larthallor We have enough problems with the Evangelicals who are obsessed with 45 and his supposed god like qualities.
@larthallor Read the transcript, you don‚Äôt have to believe me. I didn‚Äôt vote for 45 and I won‚Äôt vote for someone who won‚Äôt talk about who sponsors the National Prayer Breakfast she attends every year. There is absolutely no transparency in ‚ÄúThe Family‚Äù which is a religious org. in DC.
@SteveKornacki @amyklobuchar Butina and the NRA worked the Prayer Breakfast like pros. Then there is Grassley &amp; Cotton. According to Jeff‚Äôs book, they believe god picks people in power &amp; if they are not good people, that‚Äôs ok bc God placed them in power. Sounds a lot like the GOP Freedom Crew.
