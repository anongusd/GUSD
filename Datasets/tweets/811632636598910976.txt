Great job getting the word out! Thanks for a great discussion! #CollegeByTheNumbers https://t.co/4Y4vuBgkQc
@ThirdWayEDU @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis It will help colleges and universities recognize success and areas of needed improvement.  #CollegeByTheNumbers
@ThirdWayEDU @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis It benefits prospective students by giving them more relevant information to ease the college decision-making process #CollegeByTheNumbers
@LanaeErickson @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @jaredpolis Spread the word! We all understand the need for students &amp; families. Let's keep the discussion going. #CollegeByTheNumbers

@ThirdWayEDU @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis Students, investing in their future, deserve the benefit of more information before taking on a major financial burden #CollegeByTheNumbers
@ThirdWayEDU @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis Taxpayers invest $150 billion annually in higher ed. They deserve to know if these funds are being used effectively. #CollegeByTheNumbers
@LanaeErickson I'm also a father of 6. Having been through the college decision making process, I know it can be better. CTA will help #CollegeByTheNumbers

@ThirdWayEDU The #CollegeTransparencyAct will fill in the gaps to provide an accurate picture of how colleges are serving students #CollegeByTheNumbers
@ThirdWayEDU Currently, those who drop out and return to school, or follow non-traditional paths, are left out of the picture. #CollegeByTheNumbers
@leoniehaimson @SenWhitehouse @Parents4Privacy @cherkies @ThirdWayEDU CTA also explicitly prohibits sharing and selling of information. #CollegeByTheNumbers
@leoniehaimson @SenWhitehouse @Parents4Privacy @cherkies @ThirdWayEDU CTA collects no new information.  It explicitly prohibits collection of the most sensitive personal information #CollegeByTheNumbers
@ThirdWayEDU @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis The federal government is the only entity with comprehensive, nationwide data on employment and earnings.  #CollegeByTheNumbers
@LanaeErickson @ThirdWayEDU @APLU_GovAffairs @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis 2/2 There isn't a simple one-stop place for students, families, and the public to find information #CollegeByTheNumbers
@LanaeErickson @ThirdWayEDU @APLU_GovAffairs @senorrinhatch @SenWhitehouse @RepJaredPolis 1/2 Institutions &amp; states don't have access to employment information. Alumni surveys are unreliable with response bias #CollegeByTheNumbers
