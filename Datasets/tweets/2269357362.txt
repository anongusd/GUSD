@cFidd @DNC @FoxNews Then another part of me says don't give them a damn thing because they going to bash these  Democratic candidates after every debate they have anyway calling them all kinds of nasty things and framing them as socialists anyway. In 2020 @FoxNews will be the home of Trump campaign.
@cFidd I think the @DNC should give them a debate we all know that @FoxNews is in the tank for Trump and his White House. But Democrats need to reach as many people as possible including some of Trump sycophantic supporters. See how the network treat the Democratic candidates.

@imillhiser @SamWangPhD What's the point of Dems winning WH, HOR, but don't pick up Senate in 2020 because not very many competitive seats Democrats can pick up. Dems can build on their state legislature gains, governor gains, if they lose the WH in 2020.
@imillhiser @SamWangPhD Sometimes I think it would be better if Trump win reelection in 2020 because Democrats can pick up seats in House, Senate, State Legislature chambers, Governorships. Party out of power always does good in midterms. But then Trump can nominate more right wing judges if reelected.
@MaeveReston @amyklobuchar @CNN All the scandals engulfed in Trump's administration it would be a shame to nominate someone who can't win and have to go through 4 more years of Trump. Democrats calling for free four year college, medical for all, is not being realistic how would we pay for that.
@MaeveReston @amyklobuchar @CNN @amyklobuchar is telling it like it is and not giving out false promises. There is no one in their right mind believe that college can be free for four years it would be nice but let's be real. Dems need to stop trying to be like Bernie Sanders and say everything can be free.

@MikeDelMoro Always a tweet from this man. Hypocrisy Commander in Chief President.
@DougHeye This will happen and when it does when a new Democratic President is elected there nothing the @GOP can say because they support it being done now. What goes around comes around.
@SenhorRaposa Virginia will stay blue because it doesn't want to go back to the old @VA_GOP days.
@SenhorRaposa The @VA_GOP is dreaming they not going to win the Senate race in 2020 also they know they going to lose both chambers of the state legislature in November 2019. They know this that is why they are trying to weaponize these scandals the Democrats are in right now.
@ChazNuttycombe I voted for her but she was not that good of a candidate. I was not going to vote for the GOP candidate. We need a stronger candidate to beat the GOP candidate.
@ChazNuttycombe @JennMcClellanVA Okay thanks for that information. Then that should happen immediately. Fairfax resign and Northam appoint her as the new LG and then he resign and she becomes governor. Excellent!! Please guys take responsibility and do it for the party.
@ChazNuttycombe @JennMcClellanVA Is Jennifer McClellan district a reliable blue district because we can not afford the GOP to get this district in a special election.
@LarrySabato Completely agree @LarrySabato
@OldKentuckyHome @LarrySabato @GOP I agree as well with what you said.
@pjsykes That's what I say should happen what is so hard about that Democrats still will controlled the state stop making Dems so vunlerable in not winning the house and Senate in 2019. Resign Fairfax and have Northam appoint new LG and then he resign later. It what the @GOP would do.
@SenhorRaposa The so call MSM media always play into the GOP hands all the time. Always talking about the Democrats moving to far to the left. As you stated that you out never heard @FoxNews  saying the GOP moving to far to the right. So one sided coverage of Democrats.
@LarrySabato If this were three GOP GOV, LG, AG in scandals and a Dem House/ Senate legislature. Do you actually think the @GOP would be calling for them to resign and lose the state to the Democrats. Hell No!! Look at all the racist and horrible things Trump said the GOP still support him.
@ck1971 @Bencjacobs There not being reported on anymore. Also, the media has other Trump scandals to report on now that can bring him down now.
@LarrySabato Fairfax should resign and have Northam replace him with new Democratic LG. Northam resign and Fairfax become governor and he appoint new LG. Either scieniro will work to keep Democrats control of the state. It's what the GOP would do if they were in this situation.
@LarrySabato I think that in the end Northam and Fairfax should both resign but I don't think Fairfax should because these allegations against him can not be proven in a court it's he said she said. But if Democrats want to keep hold of the state and hold the high ground. In the end I think
@Bencjacobs Fairfax should not resign because of these two allegations why didn't all this not come out when he was running for office in 2017. Now all of a sudden they want to come forward are they being paid or what by GOP operatives Trump still POTUS and 14 women accused him of misconduct
@thehill Not surprised it's a Trump SOTU address his supporters only watch propogranda @FoxNews the only channel that's in the tank for this President.
@GOPChairwoman Instead of calling for people to resign there should be a rule in each state that in case of controversial like this or anything each party should hold a recall election and let the people decided instead of political operatives, political commentators, and political hacks.
@GOPChairwoman @GOPChairwoman Worry about your own party and stop calling for Northam to resign or any other Democrat. When you start looking at your own party and call for your people to resign like Steve King, Donald Trump, or anyone else then you can talk about Democratic resignations.
@thehill These low income GOP voters that live in these rural areas in deep red states like Utah and many others that want these things like medicaid expansion, higher minimum wage, why do you people vote Republican when they don't care about these things even if voters vote for them.

@ryanobles @RalphNortham I know this was long ago and @GovernorVA has changed and is a good governor I voted for him but stuff like this will not go away. It's an election year and the @VA_GOP will drag this on for whole year they know they going to lose one or both of state legislature chambers.
@ryanobles @RalphNortham This yearbook photo is not very good but in today's politics and media climate this story want go away. Why is Democrats not coming out against this they have a Democratic LG as back up they don't have to worry about a Republican being governor. LG offices is important.
@aseitzwald @VA_GOP @GOP does on everything possible because they say Virginia has no place for racism but then last year run a candidate for Senate Corey Stewart who was the king of racism.
@aseitzwald @VA_GOP @GOP https://t.co/IRv4eOHI9C I think he needs to resign because it's what best for party if Democrats want to recapture the General Assembly this fall 2019. If this was a Republican Democrats would be calling for him or her resign. Can have it both ways and show hypocrisy like the GOP
@aseitzwald @VA_GOP When it comes to the issue of racism the @GOP and the @VA_GOP has no business telling anyone anything. Their party is the party of racism when you had a man running for Senate in 2018 who was the king of racism. Gov. Northam needs to explain this picture and do what's right.
@gmoomaw @gmoomaw If the governor do have to resign because of this yearbook picture which is not very good @FairfaxJustin become the second ever African American governor in the history of our country. Would he have to run again in 2019 for a full term how will that work.

@RRHElections Of course he want win reelection Virginia governorship is one term and if he could run again he would win because he's been a good governor. What do the @GOP has to offer nothing but radical right-wing racists like Corey Stewart. Democrats will keep the Governor Mansion come 2021

@FLGovScott @The_RGA State Officials and Florida law enforcement says there are not evidence of voter fraud in Florida it shows the GOP is desperate so they will say or do anything.
@FLGovScott @The_RGA Why don't you people want every vote in Florida to be counted in the Governor and Senate races. I know why you afraid you going to lose so claim fraud and say nonsense stuff like Democrats trying to steal an election the only people doing that is Republicans with lawsuits. SAD!!!

@marceelias It's the New GOP PLAYBOOK in the age of Trump whenever they lose an election throw out accusations of voter fraud and Democrats stealing elections like Trump does which is false. Rick Scott knows he may lose this election if every single vote is counted so he issue lawsuits. Sad
@NBCPolitics When that doesn't work and they still lose elections they then claim voter fraud that has been wired into Republicans for years by GOP politicians and don't forget @FoxNews so Democrats better fight and make sure every US citizen vote is counted forget about GOP lawless lawsuits.
@NBCPolitics Republicans have been saying this for years this is nothing new. They been whining about voter fraud every since Obama got elected that the reason for all these hardcore voter ID laws. The GOP knows country demographics is changing so they limited people to vote so they can win.

@stevemorris__ Typical @foxandfriends when ever the news is bad for Trump they do want their leader Trump does deflect and go to their favorite punching bag and attack Democrats like Trump do.
@JRubinBlogger Republicans do not care about this allegation aganist Brett Kavanaugh all they care about is putting this right winger on the court and cementing their power on the Supreme Court for decades to come. The @GOP only cares about power they don"t care about decency or moral vaules.
@burgessev @politico I am not surprised this man would do anything to keep power and keep Democrats from campaigning because he knows he might lose his little thin majority that he has. If this man would go a whole year with any hearings or meetings with Obama SC Justice this man would do anything.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews This man only cares about people kissing his backside and saying how wonderful he is this man does not care about being President of the United States and governing he only cares about getting up every morning watch Trump state run TV (@FoxNews/@FoxBusiness) and dividing country.
@SenateMajLdr @FoxNewsSunday The @GOP knows exactly why they doing they can fund the military and make sure our brave men and women get paid during the #TrumpShutdown like they did in 2013 they want to use it as a bargaining chip like CHIP to get Dems to clean up their mess.		https://t.co/EduDyjl5uf

@kayleighmcenany It's shameful that this GOP Congress would try to now hold children's healthcare as leverage over Democrats to try and fund the government CHIP could have been renewed long time ago it shows the GOP will do anything to get Democrats to clean up their mess and fund the government.
@kayleighmcenany Its pathetic for this Trump sycophant @kayleighmcenany to try to put the children's healthcare funding over Democrats when this ineffective GOP Congress let it expire in the first place last year so to now put it on Democrats not going to work the GOP will be blame for shutdown.

@kylegriffin1 You can believe @FoxNews want be talking about this poll much on their channel it does not favored the GOP so they will buried it like the last one about Trump's low approval rating.
@JoeConchaTV Typical conservatives and people on the right loves to bash Democrats when a story comes out about them like this one but the ongoing Roy Moore scandal they been silent have not said nothing buch of hypocrites all sides should be treated the same when comes to sexual harassment.
@FoxNews @JoeConchaTV @realDonaldTrump He want to set the narrative for @FoxNews and @FoxBusiness his favorite bias channels who kiss up to him and strokes his ego.
@CNN Don't feel sorry for them at all hope the Democrats wipe them out at all levels next year in these races these Republicans governor's destroying our States with these racist voter suppression laws and many other important issues.
@brianefallon Could you imagine what these @FoxNews conservative Trump hacks would be doing if Clinton really was POTUS they probably woul be calling for the GOP to impeach her but all the mess Trump have done so far still they kiss his ass imagine if Obama did what Trump been doing past year.
@RawStory @brianstelter the media guy for @CNN don't you think you guys at @CNN should be covering this could you imagine if the rolls were reverse how @FoxNews be bashing @CNN with story like this. This is evidence the Clinton Uranium is a made up conspiracy theory by @FoxNews.
@RawStory One thing about @FoxNews they love to invent these false made up narratives then their misinformed conservative viewers believe them and go along with it then when someone like a real news journalist like @ShepNewsTeam come along with truth they get mad and want him fired.
@RawStory Its shows that the @FoxNews conservative audience been living in a alternate reality which is what @FoxNews is a place well conservatives go to feel good about voting for Trump I call it the Trump bubble at FNC and @ShepNewsTeam come with real news they can't handle the truth.
@IngrahamAngle @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @FoxNews It's amazing you watch this trash which is @FoxNews these people on this channel live in a alternate reality maybe one day they will live in the real world this narrative of needing a special prosecutor to investigation Clinton is deflection from talking about Trump and Russia.
@FoxNews This is what I'm talking about why is this Trump sicophant @IngrahamAngle bringing up this lady from years ago in Clinton years. It's amazing when ever a conservative is accused of sexual assault this dumb channel goes back to Bill Clinton just more deflection and idiotic. SAD!!
@Cwilliams52 @Mediaite It never was fair and balance its been using that fake slogan for years and people needs to realize in the age of Trump it has gotten more bias and just pure propogranda for the Trump White House.
@Mediaite Its to be expected not surprised when news come out about the Trump Russia probe deflect and talk about stupid things like what he did tonight this channel is a disgrace to real journalism. #FoxNews Channel #TrumpNews Channel.
@FoxNews It the same old crap with these hacks at @FoxNews bash Obama anyway they can prop up their guy Trump its sad and people starting to see the crap this state run channel is promoting just look at this past weeks election's people tired of Trump lies and Fox promoting them.
@BarbaraComstock You forgot @realDonaldTrump and @BillOReilly
@washingtonpost The GOP know that and they doing all they can to keep on doing it that is why they want these radical GOP judges Trump nominated in the courts so they want rule them down when they go to court for these racist gerrymander districts its shameful they can't win the right way.
@RawStory This goes to show that when these Trump networks like @FoxNews  @FoxBusiness always whinnies about liberal media bias when they in return are conservative media bias these two networks only job is to bash Democrats anyway possible, and kiss Trump ass and stroke his ego daily.

@Evan_McMullin The hypocrisy of the deadbeat party known as the GOP they don't care if Russia help Trump as long as Clinton did not win just shameful.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @POTUS One reason why Trump bash the media so much is because @FoxNews does it constantly so they want have to talk about Trump failures as POTUS.

@TuckerCarlson @HillaryClinton @FoxNews So what the people at @FoxNews says means nothing they have no credibility when it comes to the issue of women being sexual harassed.

@washingtonpost Some of this black Republicans who you think would condemned Trump for his sad press conference are not to mad about it which is sad.

@FoxNews @HeyTammyBruce You have @FoxNews fearmongering now they criticize @CNN for doing when they show a bunker in Hawaii in case of a attack. Hypocrisy.
@soullesschimney @mattmfm I agree if not for the creation of BLM what would they compare this to attack Obama and Democrats just stupidity on @FoxNews it's fake news
@mattmfm @mmfa Because their ratings will go down and they can't have that and make Trump look bad on their air just sad and despicable and shameful.
@mattmfm @mmfa @FoxNews can't call out racist white supremacy becuase most of them is the Trump base which is their viewership they can't call them out.
@mattmfm @mmfa Its just sad and people knows @FoxNews gameplay here this is what they always do when Trump faces pressure from all sides deflect and pivot.
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke @POTUS @SheriffClarke The conservative media couldn't control themselves they could not resist the opportunity to bash Obama on any ISIS attack.

@DanaPerino @TheFive One thing about @FoxNews they love to talk about the Democrats problems but when it comes to GOP and Trump failures silent nothing to say.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Trump could never do a two hour townhall on healthcare he know nothing about it all he would do is repeat himself on every question he gets.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS Trump knows nothing about healthcare all he want to do is get rid of Obamacare because it's a Obama accomplishment he so jealous of Obama.
@dcexaminer @ByronYork Simple. The election of Donald Trump brought in more people from the alt-right that is giving money to the RNC that didn't in the past.
@JudgeJeanine @KellyannePolls Two Trumpocrats who would say or do anything to protect Donald Trump and who both believe in fake news and alternative facts that all on FNC
@thehill One reason why the feckless GOP criticized Obama daily 24/7 is because they were mad a black man beat to white men in two election cycles.
@TheFive I though that @DanaPerino was fair and in the middle but she gotten so she just like @jessebwatters @kimguilfoyle @greggutfeld a Trumpocrat.
@TheFive Can you send @jessebwatters on vacation for like for ever he so bias and in the tank for the Trump WH replace with a Dem how it fair 4-1.
@mattwilstein @TuckerCarlson @realDonaldTrump Who going to believe it nothing but a act he stills kisses Trump behind every night so play him no mind just talking out side of his mouth.
@TheFive @kimguilfoyle @TheJuanWilliams @jessebwatters @DanaPerino @ChrisStirewalt Who going to watch that trash known as @TheFive its failing in the ratings because they all think alike say the same bias stuff except Juan.
@KFILE This is what they do over there Trump state run TV they brainwash their viewers on the Trump Russia probe and deflect to Clinton. SAD!
@thehill Why am I not surprised typical Trump people going to their safe space which is the bias trashy show known as Hannity.
@abbydphillip Could you imagine if this was Hillary doing these things pardon herself over the emails @FoxNews be outrage and Trump want to do it nothing.
@dcexaminer If he does that we know he guilty and he should be impeached and get out of the oval office he is nothing but an embrassment to the country.
@dcexaminer @emilyjashinsky Its not a problem Trump using his reelection campaign money to pay for his legal fees in the Russia probe report that @dcexaminer.
@FoxNews No one even listens to @seanhannity anymore he keeps beating his drums and kissing up to the Trump administration so sad and shameful.
@thehill Just speak about the issues of middle class families and ways to make their lives better and leave Russia probe to Robert Mueller.
RT @RepAdamSchiff: Mueller has authority to investigate any ties Trump family has to Russia, including financial, and anything that arises.…

@KFILE Just sad @FoxNews has lost their mind in the Trump era no wonder they doing terrible in the ratings just sad and pitiful they live on Mars.
@KFILE @brianstelter I don't know why @seanhannity repeats the same garbage every night he talking to the same old white conservatives every night no new viewers
@KFILE @brianstelter And @seanhannity is just a stupid as they comes he is so obsessed with Clinton and Obama hopefully one day he will find peace and move on.
@KFILE @brianstelter Its just sad that @FoxNews lives in a alternative universe when it comes to Trump and the Russian probe telling their viewers lies so sad.
@FoxNews How sad it is for these feckless Republicans to always blame Democrats for their failures on healthcare they did not want the Dems help.
https://t.co/bqZfPHoTDr		This is just so shameful and disgusting that someone will say that about someone will @FoxNews cover it doubtful.
@seanhannity @MonicaCrowley This dumbo known as @seanhannity is such a hypocrite did he talk about the hatred directed at Obama of course not he was one of the haters.
@seanhannity @JaySekulow The media is not talking about this because its not a story only corrupt conservative media outlets like @FoxNews talking about it for Trump
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Is she a real judge because I think she is a fake judge for TV purposes to kiss up to Trump administration and boy she does a good job of it
@thehill This is the only Republican senator I like and listens to when GOP try to pass these radical right wing bills favoring the rich with tax cut

@LeanneNaramore At least somebody telling the truth and not brainwashing the viewers that watch this trash @FoxNews the only two real journalists they have.
@seanhannity @ErinBurnett @CNN People tired of watch @FoxNews and that is why Fox is decline in ratings all they do is police the media and not report actual real news.
@seanhannity @ErinBurnett @CNN The only thing is fake news is @FoxNews primetime lineup what a joke it is not the powerful lineup it once was. 		https://t.co/PsJDtp4Ads
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @TomKludt I also love the @ReliableSources media newsletter so informative on the days news keep up the good work @CNN and ignore Trump stooges at WH.
@Mediaite No one barely listens to him people probably mute his monologue until they saw DT Jr. because he says the same trash every night.
@yashar This woman is so awkward instead of she counseling Trump someone needs to couselor her and her crazy alternative facts theories. SAD!!!
@seanhannity @JoeNBC Why is this man @seanhannity so obsessed with @JoeNBC.
@GSorensen @andersoncooper @SebGorka Why do @CNN continue to have on these Trump stooges who is not going to answer any questions except deflect and bash CNN for covering it.
@thehill Well at least Ralph Peters told the truth about @TuckerCarlson he is so sympathetic to Russia trying to help Trump and his stooges.
@Bencjacobs This man nothing but a joke and a bum it would be a disgrace to the senate for this man to be elected no experiences of any kind.
@MelissaAFrancis Talk to your collegeaus from @FoxNews and @FoxBusiness @MelissaAFrancis you all are the ones saying it to cover for Trump and make him happy
@ericgeller I do not NO why @seanhannity was not the right person to do this interview he is in his safe space and Sean just went along and pander. SAD!
@FoxNews @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump What a SAD excuse for a interview in his safe space on @seanhannity him and his father love to go on Hannity when the heat is on.
@TheJuanWilliams @TheFive @FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams how do you do it sat there every night outnumbered @TheFive and listen to these Trump sicophants kiss up to him daily.
@arappeport The only people overpiad and lazy are the conservative stooges that kiss up to Trump and kisses his ass on @FoxNews that pander to him daily
@arappeport Its nothing new this sad man @seanhannity is always mad trying to protect this unfit man in the WH and get mad at MSM for reporting news.
@jeffzeleny @POTUS This man is getting to old to go 24 hours a day 7 days a week he so mad about Russian prove he getting even more gray hairs.
The only reason Donald Trump Jr release his emails because NYT had copies and he did not want to be outdone by the NYT so he release them.
If the NYT did not have copies of Donald Trump Jr. emails do you think he would have released them all for the sake of transparency. NO!!!!
@PeteButtigieg Tom Perez has not platform as DNC chair he ran because the establishment want him to he have no plan for Dems to win big in 2018.
@PeteButtigieg @PeteButtigieg I hope you had won the DNC chairman race you had a good platform to run on and you were part of younger generation.
@fordm Good Reporting NYT the only reason why Trump and his stooges hate CNN and NYT the most because they dig up what they try to hide typical.
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr We all know the Trump family is in power because of Russia and hope Robert Muller figure it out how Russia help the crime family take power.
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr The media is doing their job reporting the news and these Trump sicophants can find a way to spin this story to make this idoit look good.
@ToddPiro @ffweekend @foxandfriends Who will watch it will be a soft interview with no substance just want @FoxNews does with Trump people they have not credibility on probe.
@yashar Why! He not a real journalist to ask him tough questions on this big story of course him and his father goes to their safe space on Hannity.
@brianstelter @HillaryClinton I am surprise the Murdock's son have not fire him yet they more reliable then there Trump loving father Rupert people know @FoxNews is fake.
@brianstelter @HillaryClinton This is what this pathetic excuse of TV host @seanhannity do when a Trump story about Russia comes out he pivot and talk about Clinton. SAD!
@thehill Not surprised he going to go to his safe space where him and that nutjob @seanhannity can spin the story and talk about Democrats and MSM.
@kylegriffin1 You can tell what network is covering up the Russian probe to their viewers @FoxNews is doing disservice to their Audience by lying to them.
@thehill This is nothing but a tactic these unfit Trump stooges used to discredit @CNN so when they report on Trump and Russia no one believes it.
@FoxNews @AriFleischer Its the hypocrisy you hear on this trashy network known as @FoxNews they kiss Trump ass NO matter what he does just sad and shameful.
@FoxNews @AriFleischer On @FoxNews if Clinton was President and her daughter meet with a Russian lawyer during the campaign for Opp Research @FoxNews would blow up
@FoxNews @AriFleischer Translation: Trump and his family can meet with anyone and not be a problem during the campaign in 2016 if you listen to the trash you hear
@thehill This woman has no creditability she lives on alternative facts and you wonder why she never book on @MSNBC she lies constantly @CNN  do same

@thehill You would hope the first family would act better then this set example for the country but of course it the Trumps what would you expect.
@thehill This man is just like his old man that nutjob in the White House always trying to encourage violence against CNN just sad and shameful.
@thehill @FoxNews loves to take about voter fraud why they not talking about this let me guess because its a Trump supporter and not a Democrat.
Unsubscribe from unwanted emails and combine the rest into a single daily digest with @Unrollme https://t.co/kX8mAvTcKp
@dailykos Its just a dam shame that a major political party is trying to limit people the right to vote you would think they want more to vote not GOP
@dailykos This is a plan to limit blacks from voting because GOP knows demographics in Texas is changing and it will become Democratic state one day.
@Noel_zeek @thehill @FoxNews Of course they won't report it do the story make liberals look bad no its the reverse so they want report it such bias.
@thehill You go @KatyTurNBC someone needs to tell these dumb Trump folks a thing or two these people get stupider everyday trying to lie for Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Do this man has anything better to do then attack @CNN  on twitter constantly its just sad and unbecoming of a POTUS but he a fake POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN The only reason why @realDonaldTrump  is attacking @CNN @NBCNews is because they want praise him and kiss his ass like @FoxNews does. SAD!!!
@realDonaldTrump The reason Trump wants this information is to purge voters from the rolls that did not vote for him so he can easily win reelection 2020.

@Thesanelib @TuckerCarlson My point is why is that @FoxNews so interested in illegal immigration but not trying to combat gun control you Fox News people one sided.
@TuckerCarlson You can see where @FoxNews mission is at help Trump promote his radical right wing agenda and kiss his ass and protect him at any means.
@TuckerCarlson Did FOX bring on the grieving families of Newtown Connecticut shooting of little children to help promote Obama mission of gun control. NO!
@TuckerCarlson Its amazing that @FoxNews bring on these grieving families whose kids been killed by illegals to prop up Trump illegal immigration policies.

@thehill And those people that actually watch it and not piggyback of rightwing trash you hear on @FoxNews know how reliable @CNN is and will watch.
@thehill People that watch CNN and not people that hop on the bandwagon to criticism like @FoxNews does just to trash them know how honest they are.
@PressSec @WhiteHouse Just hope its not fake news just to prop up the President and make him look good on things that is just not true. NO Alternative Facts!!!
@HuffPostPol I am surprised they speaking up about this nasty mouth idiot of a President we got its the first I have heard them speak out in 6 months.
@TomKludt What a sad old 70 year old President that America elected. We should all be ashamed of having this nasty mouth unfit man represent us aboard
@cnnbrk It not news look at @FoxNews no liberal hosts so why should @MSNBC hire @FoxNews hosts when you know they soft on Trump and the GOP.

@BeauWillimon But since its about Trump everything is fine and the investigation should be over buch of dam hypocrites and wonder why people hate @FoxNews
@BeauWillimon The hypocrisy of the right could you imagine if this Russia probe was about Clinton and she was President it would be a 24-7 story on Fox.
@seanhannity Here come the hack known as @seanhannity retweeting fake news to make Obama look bad and make Trump his savior look legitimate.
@AMLwhere @foxandfriends People know that @foxandfriends is not a real news show its just propogranda for the Trump White House to make him look good for his voters.
@thehill Of course Fox News would have criticism of @Acosta they have no real reporters they all Trumpocrats kissing his behind and stroking his ego.

@seanhannity @CNN @NBCNews Fake News shows : @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends @jessebwatters @JudgeJeanine @OutnumberedFNC @TheFive all trash.
@seanhannity @CNN The only fake news in America today is @FoxNews @FoxBusiness @BreitbartNews whose only sole job is kiss Trump behind and cover for him.
@realDonaldTrump Trump please shut up because if Obama had acted and it cause you the election because he favor Clinton you be crying about it for years.
@Trump @MariaBartiromo @EricTrump @FoxNews Its amazing how much kiss up the Trump family and White House does to Fox News to get them to treat them fairly and protect them in media.
@rolandsmartin @TGowdySC @realDonaldTrump I am not shocked one bit these feckless Republicans never seems to amaze me imagine if Clinton was President and rolls were reverse.
@tweettruth2me @HARRISFAULKNER @HARRISFAULKNER claims to be a journalist she is nothing more than a right wing Trump hack Fox has no credible journalists its state run TV.
@tweettruth2me @HARRISFAULKNER I sometimes wonder why Dems go on Fox News the propogranda network they always get treated unfairly because they all in tank for Trump.
@tweettruth2me @HARRISFAULKNER I agree one thing about Fox they hire these weak liberals and let these ring wing hacks school them because they want hire strong liberals.
@billoreilly Fox News is state run TV they been carrying water for the Republican Party for decades it has gotten worse under Trump its a love fest now.
@billoreilly Why not @FoxNews been attacking @CNN @MSNBC constantly even you did it @billoreilly but now they hit back can't take it want be victims. SAD
@seanhannity @NBCNews @CNN Did they report on any of his accomplishments when the feckless GOP obstructed him the past 8 years I love how this nutjob forgets history.
@seanhannity @NBCNews @CNN Why would they report it nothing but rolling back Obama regulations nothing to report on I can say the same about @FoxNews about Obama.
@seanhannity You should be asking yourself that question you are one sad and pathetic excuse for a cable news host with all your conspiracy theories. SAD
@JoyAnnReid Another reason why Dems can't win is some too far to the left like Bernie Sanders can not win elections in south with far left candidates.
@JoyAnnReid She is the problem we Democrats need new young leaders look at the leaders all mostly all over 70 in coastal states we need new faces.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @HillaryClinton But got some nerve to say that @CNN and @MSNBC obsessed with Trump they cover him fairly and accurate more then I can say FNC cover Obama.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @HillaryClinton Its amazing this trash know as @FoxNews loves to report every negative story they can on Obama and Clinton every single day obsessed much.
@trish_regan But no going to work because their ratings are up across the board covering this disaster of a WH we got today in America. SAD/SHAMEFUL!
@trish_regan Because he knows they cover for his failures and prop him up and bash Democrats and media so they want have creditability to tell the truth.
@trish_regan I don't blame @CNN @MSNBC @CNBC I go to regular program as well he aint talking about nothing kissing up @FoxNews @FoxBusiness why watch it.
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @ainsleyearhardt @POTUS @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump No thanks I pass its going be nothing but a suck up session on the most bias propogranda show in cable news kissing up no hard Q"s just bias
@FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @NancyPelosi I agree that it is time for new Democratic leadership in the House Pelosi and other on leadership are older and out of touch need fresh.
@FoxNews @SandraSmithFox @NancyPelosi The people at Fox News love it when Dems lose elections because it's good for them to prop up their agenda of right wing radical policies.
@thehill Of course they do don't you not watch @FoxNews and @FoxBusiness just bias and who lot of Trump backside kissing.
@rollcall What obstruction look at the Republican obstruction under Obama the last 8 years  and Trump was not tweeting about that now was he.Hypocrite
@aravosis @MalcolmNance The Democrats need to find a Republican bogeyman to attack constantly like they attack Pelosi instead of Trump all the time find new target.
@michellemalkin If the Democrat @JonOssoff had won the GA-6 election you would have been a downward dog @michellemalkin and the other feckless conservatives
@thehill When these Trump voters have no healthcare and the old Republicans have no Medicaid and Medicare don't come crying you get what you vote.
@thehill I do not understand why these people voted for her anyway she is nothing but a rubber stamp for the hard right Trump agenda.
Here comes all the feckless bandwagons in the GOP happy that Karen Handel won GA-6 election if she had lost they be silent and say nothing.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Why is the President thanking a network for a win they have nothing to do with wonder why they soft on Trump in his  coverage kissing up.
@IngrahamAngle @TGowdySC @realDonaldTrump We talking about the feckless Republican @TGowdySC who use the Benghazi investigation to go after Clinton to bring down her poll numbers.
@jpodhoretz @EWErickson The Dems control the House for decades they will get it back again its going to be hard with the GOP racist gerrymandering it how they wins.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @CNN @MSNBC Not really to tell you the truth I would rather have younger new leadership represents the party and get all these old leaders out.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @maddow @TheFive I agree let Muller do his job and do the investigation Fox News just trying to undermined it they would not be do it if a D was in the WH.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @CNN @MSNBC They to have it both ways because a R in WH its wrong and their viewersneed to no the reality and not the fake news they hear on @FoxNews.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @CNN @MSNBC Imagine if it was other way they want be calling for Clinton to end special counsel if she was POTUS and she was being investigated. Right
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @CNN @MSNBC All they do is throw red meat to their hard core Trump audience because they know this is a serious investigation but they want tell them.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @maddow @TheFive I agree with you on that point that is what all three networks should be talking about and let the investigation play out but @FoxNews want.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @maddow @TheFive If the Russia probe was reverse and was about Clinton or Obama @FoxNews would be talking it non stop 24-7 so why they critical of others.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @maddow @TheFive She talks about the Russian probe because it important to know if Trump colluded with Russia to win our election its a big story.
@PistolPeat187 @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle So why Fox News act all high and mighty when @CNN @MSNBC is bias and partisan when they are to but only talks about them and not themselves.
@politico Hope she win one step closer for Dems to control the house again with all this racist Republican gerrymandering only way they won in 2010.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle They report no news except police the media in what they say and do no wonder they are no longer number 1 in the demo no more keep it up.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle You watch @FoxNews they think that they smarter than other news organizations but in reality people knows Fox not a real news outlet.
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle No wonder @maddow beat this dumb bias show every night known as the @TheFive they talk about nothing except what liberals say keep it up.
@realDonaldTrump This man has nothing to say but the same old crap everytime there is an special election the GOP only care for the rich so vote D tomorrow.
@thehill Instead of trying to preach to the left on what to say they need to be looking at themselves imagine a Democrat said that it be on @FoxNews
@thehill Amazing that these feckless conservative preach about nasty redderick and blames the left for it look at this conservative using hate speech
@FoxNews BIAS ALERT: Fox News primetime lineup is so bias and radical for their CEO Trump no wonder they drop the fake slogan Fair &amp; Balance.

@HowardKurtz @KatiePavlich @ErinMcPike @mtomasky What a stupid tweet Howard the media in my opinion should not even cover it let Fox News just cover it the Trump White House Channel.
The only reasons why Trump made up the wire tap story is to take attention off Russia story and you watch Fox they of course took the bait.
@PressSec @ThisWeekABC @POTUS Because the courts decided that there really was evidence to have his phones tapped because he really was saying inappropriate stuff. Mole.
@PressSec @ThisWeekABC @POTUS He must had been granted a warrant by the courts to do it and they should be covering that part of the story that part more important.
@PressSec @ThisWeekABC @POTUS The conservative media and Trump aides are so stupid to further this story because if Obama did had the FBI tap Trump tower or his phones.
@TrishIntel @JoeConchaTV @POTUS What I don't understand is conservatives mad Trump get bad coverage look at how FNC/FBN cover Obama last 8 years just the hypocrisy on right

@ericbolling @realDonaldTrump Conservatives trying to blame Trump failures on Obama typical conservatives take responsibility for yourselves and stop blaming Obama.
@LouDobbs @POTUS You and Hannity always complain about everything always trying to push Trump agenda you job is news not being biased and pushing Trump.
@trish_regan @briansflood @TheWrap Stop glotting Trish it does look good FBN and FNC love to brag about their viewership just report news and stop bragging no one else does it

Oh let me guess why you can't and what your supporters would say you under audit if so release old tax returns that are not.
What I don't understand if Trump  has no ties to Russia just be a big boy and released your tax returns and that will solved it.
When it comes to talking about Russia and election the conservatives and Fox News are so out of touch and stupid when it comes to it.
@greta @TGowdySC @MSNBC Oh please Trey you were in a hurry to investigate Benghazi but this Russia investigation is different just shut up you have no credibility.
@ericbolling @kimguilfoyle Since its your birthday today you need to retire from the five with your radical righ wing views and never come back please.

@foxandfriends Typical Fox News bringing on people who agree with there radical views and kissing up to Trump its very shameful and sad.
@oreillyfactor Always trying to make Trump look good and the Republicans and always putting down Democrats typical Fox News personality sad.
@FoxNews You happy now Fox News y'all got what you want now shut up for a moment and report on the real story the Russians and Trump.

@valleystreamgal @foxnewspolitics @FoxNews @AdamShawNY During that moment everyone stand up did you even watch the speech.
@Major_GBad @greta You need to stop watch Fox it is brainwashing you and lot of other people sample other news instead of slanted fox news.
@Major_GBad @greta Of there right wing racist rhetoric and people no that fox news not a real news organization just a Republican news net.
@Major_GBad @greta Fox News loves to stir the pot and bait issues that make them look good they the reason the country so divided because
@Major_GBad @greta The GOP depends on Fox News because that there channel they go on the most and the channel loves kissing Trump backside.
@Major_GBad @greta Fox News is more divisive than MSNBC they always cut off Democratic guests when on that bias channel and cater to right.
@politico Typical Republican talk and wonder why they get called the things they arw called by the other side becausw its true.
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Of course fox news will report it they always report any little thing the left does but ignored the right.
@valleystreamgal @foxnewspolitics @FoxNews @AdamShawNY Oh please that one idot does not represent the entire left wake up stop watching FOX.
Did they spend that much time wondering if Republicans clapped for Obama when he gave speech to Congress hell no because they did not care.
Why is the conservative media being so childish and petty in talking about whether the Dems clap for Trump or not does it matter.
@Major_GBad @greta And if Gerta does not like what going on at MSNBC no ask her to come over should have stayed at the right wing bias Fox.
@Major_GBad @greta Nobody is not asking you to watch you can go and watch swamp channel Fox News you love Trump so much and stop complaints.
@OutnumberedFNC @SandraSmithFox @CharlesHurt Of course who wouldn't lot of Trump ass kissing on the show today you can best believe that.
@cvpayne Let's be clear Charles you biased everyday on your right-wing show always Trump ass kissers on and you one to and no Dems on sad.
@cvpayne See how biased the conservative media is and got nerve to complain and wine about liberal media toward Trump so much hypocrisy sad.
What get me is these right-wing extremist Republicans mad that Dems did not stand give me a break look the past SOTU addresses under Obama.
@SenatorDurbin @SenateDems		 So true and right on point.
You no the Fox News people routine kiss up to Trump and say best speech ever and put down Dems for not clapping for him typical Fox News.
The speech was nothing but a hoax trying to fake unite us and tomorrow morning be the first to attack someone on Twitter.
@kayleighmcenany Did you say the same thing when Obama was trying to unite our country while Republicans obstructed him the past eight years
@greta And Greta if you going to bring your Fox News tactics to MSNBC you could stayed over there question the intergity of these women.
@greta A strong statement to this bigot of a President we have if you can't see it you been under a rock the pass few weeks.
This speech to Congress tonight will take about what he has done and what he is going to do but in reality what has he done so far nothing.
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr @POTUS Of course he would say that his wife works for the President and he will do what ever Trump wants.
@politico Why is these spineless R"s always block everything when it comes to getting to the bottom of this Russia situation they scared.
@jessebwatters Is show is not news its just racist baiting when he does these stupid segments and kissing Trump backside just a pundit guys.
@chitowntilidie @julieroginsky @etr1956 @SandraSmithFox @HARRISFAULKNER You mean Meghan McCain

@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Of course he goes on there for interview all three are Trump ass kissers so it will be a softball interview.
And of course the Democrats that work there the rest are all in the tank for Trump its amazing how foxnews it most watched report out lies.
The only real journalist on Fox News is Shepard Smith the only fair and only one to called out the lies of the man in the White House.
Its a shame the way Fox News loves it when Trump bashes the media when in reality they the media to right I forgot not a real news network.
https://t.co/wDlyc9vwTE See what I mean Republicans has no backbone when it comes to Trump they are scared of him its very sad and pathetic
will always be in power look at the House through gerrymandering they will have the house until next maps are drawn in 2020 Dems wake up.
One thing is the Dems need to wake up and start getting back to winning elections because if they don't those spineless Republicans
The only thing they know is to piggyback of everything that Trump says and adds more garbage to it to make it news Fox does not know nothing
You watch Fox News they always say Hollywood and the Dems are out of touch with the American people they don't know what America want
See why people don't trust government if this was Hillary Republican Party and Fox News would be outrage. Hypocrisy	https://t.co/XZ9f3ULKbE
See why Fox News is fake news it would do anything for Trump to make him look good for their viewers even if it lie.	https://t.co/UOTC74QO42
@POTUS You keep saying its fake news because you got something to hide typical Trump when truth hits h and yell fake news very sad for POTUS
@PeteButtigieg @TomPerez Congrats to Tom but I was hoping that Pete had won race for DNC I hope you consider to run for higher office.
@michellemalkin Who cares what these right wing biased conservativea say instead of worrying about DNC worry bout that right wing RNC chair.
@mmfa You watch Fox not a real news network just a propogranda outlet for conservatives and the Republican Party and now campaign for Trump.
@mmfa It is just hypocrisy at its finest when the right does it okay but left does it is wrong it is just pathetic how much of a turnaround.
RT @mmfa: Fox News had a slightly different take on protests before Trump was president. https://t.co/koWCKAAF7G
@thehill I would after all the disrespect they should not go instead of wasting time at boring dinner keep investigating his Russian ties.
@Varneyco @davidwebbshow The Republicana are on a dangerous path too when they can't stand up to Trump they have no backbone very sad.
@CNNTonight @MMFlint @CNN I really hope he does not win he is too liberal we need a new young face such as Pete Buttigeg so vote for Pete.
CPAC is this week when all these radical rights wingers think of new ways to destroy our country and limit voting and talk trash about Dems.
It's a shame Hannity talks about the left-wing media being fake when he and his show share fake news. Sad	https://t.co/kIycRQYofw
@seanhannity Terrible It has been a disaster he needs to resigned and stop destroying the dignity of the office he is acting like a TV prez.
@FoxBusiness @michellemalkin How about we clean up the so call Fox News and Fox Business Trump butt kissing swap the one sided bias channels
@seanhannity @THEHermanCain The only snowflake I see is Hannity who bitch the last 8 years of Obama now Trump in he kiss his ass every night
You watch Fox News during primetime you wonder why the country the way it is with these right wing methodology hosts destroying the country.
@Doreenjesse1 @seanhannity Well good luck with that.
@cvpayne It got worse during Obama Years with Fox News and Fox Business spatting racial things about our President it made the country bad.
@Doreenjesse1 @seanhannity He lies every night so I guest he is wasting your time you every thought of that. Hannity not a news person.
@EllisonCampaign I do not want him to win he is too far to left I hope Pete  Buttigeg win and not have a war between Perez side and Keith.
@FoxNews It is nothing but a painting you snowflakes over at Fox News needs to get over it. Just because they wanted it down the GOP jumped.
@seanhannity One thing about Hannity he has on the same old radical right wing guests to stroke his ego have guest from other side of aisle.
@lgerk He always calls out CNN because they report real hard professional journalism and facts on him and he can't take it so he lashes out.
@lgerk The same goes for Trump as well as you conservatives called it the MSM calls him out because he lies all the time and Fox can't do it
@lgerk @greta He should act like a President and stop complaining about mainstream media everyday Obama didn't and look how Fox treated him.
@lgerk @greta I watch these radical right wing guest every day on Fox News and they do not surprise me let me ask do you only watch Fox.
@lgerk @greta And no I do not judge a show based on color I just pointed out that there is no diversity at fox News look at its primetime.
@lgerk @greta Yes watch Fox News, CNN and MSNBC I like to watch all sides and sometimes Fox acts like a campaign arm of Trumps White House.
@seanhannity You and your monologues get crazy and more sad each night you complain more than Trump let's be real your biased as well.
@lgerk @greta We all know Fox News can't talk about other networks being biased when they practice what they preach no weekday host of color
@lgerk @greta If you watch Fox instead of MSNBC because its slanted Fox News is just as slanted because we all know Fox is not real news.
Fox News is losing its creditability when reporting on false immigration stories to help promote Trump immigration order very sad.
@thehill Fox News just embrassed themselves always calling out fake news in mainstream media but report fake news all the time very sad.
@ritacolleen @thehill @FoxNews @TCBGP @Paula_Dockery Fox News getting the shout out from the President for reporting fake news.
Fox News is fake news trying to tell stories they know are fake but have nerve to call CNN, MSNBC fake news.	https://t.co/UczblN8d16
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Stop watching Fox News for your information your the President you got real info and stop getting bias info on FNC
@FoxNews @rushlimbaugh This man needs to retire from radio with his racist ass language no wonder our country divided people listen to him.
@NBCNews Hope it is not one of these two from Clinton and Sanders wing of party need someone new like Pete Buttigieg for the future of party
@FoxNews @POTUS When the President lies to people the media will report and never let the President get away with it.
All Democrats support Pete Buttigieg for DNC chair we need new young leadership to take back power in DC and in the states.
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke Of course Clarke would say those nice things about him he is the black version of a Steve Bannon.
One thing I can say is John McCain is the only Republican right now with a back born who is standing up to this dictator of a President
@thehill The Republicans are the party of David Duke.
@TheWrap I don't blame her they going to come on the air and say racist and false things I cut him off too more talk shows needs to do it.
@FoxNews @GenFlynn Of course Fox News like that let it had been someone in the Clinton White House they be wanting charges the hypocrisy.
@trish_regan So they are the mainstream media as well or should they be call the Trump media or a campaign arm of the Trump White House.
@trish_regan What gets me is that FNC and FBN always talk about mainstream and bashing them aren't they on cable news too like CNN, MSNBC.
@SheriffClarke Another Trump bigot who only cares about themselves and spatting false and inaccurate information on Fox News which is biased
@cvpayne All right wingers and no liberal opinion and always complain about liberal media being biased get your show fix with being balance.
@BrentBozell @cnsnews The biased conservative media has no sway on the American people neither they never will.
One thing about Trump supporters they can't handle someone telling the truth about Trump look at Shepard Smith on Fox got heat for truth.
@HARRISFAULKNER He is the best journalist fox news got tells the truth and don't kiss Trump ass like everyone else on Fox does.
@foxandfriends @FoxNews One thing about Fox they love to report when conservatives protest but when liberals do it the sky is falling sad.
@FoxBusiness As you can see no one once to work for this inexperienced so called President Trump get it to his biggest fans Hannity or Dobbs
You no what hypocrisy is when conservative media talks about liberal mainstream media bias toward Trump when they did the same to Obama.
@trish_regan Your show and your network is the fake news that exist and Fox News not CNN, MSNBC, they tell truth you slant to make him happy
@JoyAnnReid This man has no business being our President he don't even act or talk or perform like a real President so sad we got 4 years.
The world is watching this press conference and they saying he is so unhinged and he nothing but embrassment to our country just so sad.
This press conference is so bad this man is so upredictable always complaning about CNN trying to undermine them it not going to work.
When it comes to Fox News they so great to Trump because they kiss his ass CNN not going to they going to report what Fox scared to tell.
You watch the conservative media they mad about what going on talking about media undermine Trump wake up call they did the same to Obama.

@seanhannity They not being dishonest they telling the American people the truth not the slanted truth you are telling to cover for Trump.
@ZAmandalee @Altrightparty @OutFrontCNN @SenJeffMerkley @CNN Because he brainwash the people that did vote for him telling them lies.
@FoxNews Conservative media is so stupid and shameful these days more dispicable and nasty when Obama was President now they protect Trump.
@FoxNews @piersmorgan Every time someone says something mean about Trump Hannity does what he always does blame the liberal media and bitch.
The conservative media mainly fox news saying the Flynn scandal is being blown out of porpotion they blow the email scandal and Benghazi.
@thehill Of course they only want Trump people to only go on Fox because they soft on them when interviewed and never challenge them sad.
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor Typical O'Reilly and Hannity and Fox News always trying to cover for Trump biased pathetic and sad.
@MelissaAFrancis How stupid can these fox news and business people get trying to play down this scandal trying to protect their man Trump.
@FoxBusiness Where is Deirdre Bolton she need s to come back for her show on FBN Liz is ruining her show with her extreme right wing bias.

@WWE @HEELZiggler This man is nothing but a cocky sore loser who can't win a match as a face or heel just ridiculous and should not be on TV
@FoxBusiness @LouDobbs It is amazing how these lame spineless guteless conservatives view things when it comes to trying to spin stories.
@OutFrontCNN @SenJeffMerkley @CNN Trump has been working with the Russians from the beginning that is how he became President.
@greggutfeld They could not because they had to report and correct fake news that Fox News was saying about Obama the last 8 years.
@mmfa Typical conservative media always blaming Obama for everything well he is gone now find new talking point just ridiculous and sad.
Now these radical conservatives on Fox News trying to change the narrative about Flynn and Russia so sad trying to make Trump look good.
@thehill I agree Trump knew what was going on all along let's be real. Nothing gets pass him you can best believe that.
@thehill Such hypocrites the Republican are when it come to investigation Trump administration imagine if this was Clinton administration.
@ericbolling Now Eric blame Obama admin if Trump would get his people in place then it want be a problem still over 600 spots left to fill.
@ericbolling Look how mad he is over this you can imagine how Hannity will react to the news about Flynn resign.
We are witnessing the first scandal of the Trump White House in just the beginning of his adminstration so sad.
Happy Valentine's Day!
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor @FoxNewsInsider All Fox News talks about is biased media towards Trump look at how they cover Obama such hypocrites.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @FoxNewsInsider When something does not go conservatives way they wine and complain and blame liberals it's gets old.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @FoxNewsInsider This man is losing his mind he needs to get off TV with his radical right wing ideology.
@seanhannity No, Let"s ask you a question would you ever stop pandering and kissing Trump ass and start criticizing Trump you did Obama.
@seanhannity You always say you have a message for us liberals and the media they never listens to Trumps sidekick so stop please.

@FoxNews @RCamposDuffy The Republican Party always has been the racist party and their counterpart is the king of race baiting Fox News.
@FoxNews @tedcruz This why America is so divided these feckless Republicans come on this biased network and say stuff like this so typical.
@HEELZiggler The only said is this execuse of this so called wrestler that loses all the time now that is sad.
@thehill What she said was very true and at least she got a backborn to tell the truth about Sessions which these feckless GOP can't
@realDonaldTrump And stop complaining all the time and winning it is unbecoming of a President.
@realDonaldTrump You should pick experience people and not a bunch of millionaires and billionaires with no experience.
@godislove524 @FoxNews @RealDrGina Obama did not divide America the racist conservatives / Fox News did they could handle a black president
@FoxNews It amazing Fox picks up on anythinf when it concerns Democrats but the channel say nothing when Trump says something inappropriate
@TheMattWilstein @thedailybeast @TuckerCarlson @HamiltonMusical When something does not go conservatives way all they do is complain.
Let"s be real Fox News is not fair and balance all they care about is making Trump happy it's Trump all day long and bashing the Democrats.
@thehill Good keep her lying butt off TV always lying all the time just like her boss Trump and the entire White House.
What a rigged Super Bowl game from the beginning.
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/BdhAybEr8r
@mmfa I agree they did not do Obama like that in his early weeks as President espically of Fox News typical biased but they say fair/balance
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This is going to be a soft interview because they are friends and of course because its Fox News.
@ericbolling So typical of Bolling he look like that the past 8 years under the Obama administration when something did not go his way.
@FoxNews @POTUS This game is going to be rigged so Patriots can win to make Trump look good as President.
@brianstelter Of course Trump sidekick Hannity not going to cover it makes him look bad typical Hannity.
@seanhannity I really don't care hope the Falcons beat Trump favorite Tom Brady Patriots and watch halftime show with Lady Gaga on Trump.

@realDonaldTrump Every time he does not get his way he start name calling like a child no wonder bullying on the rise in schools today
@realDonaldTrump The mess is you out of touch and racist adminstration with no experience how to run the White House that is a mess.
The GOP control Congress to coward to step up to Trump becuse he would end their careers it is just pathetic there is no check on his admin.
@thehill You and Hannity can defend him all you want the damage has been done you idiots tearing up families for Trump and Fox ideology.
You watch Fox News its pathetic they way they try to defend Trump on these racist exective orders because in reality they agree but want say
@joshketball @seanhannity @newtgingrich Why are conservatives so racist and dumb they not even relevant in America today never will be.
@seanhannity @newtgingrich You watch Hannity on Fox News this man is so stupid when it comes to defending Trump say the most stupid things.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich This man will never be a real President he is just playing the part of it acting like on from a TV show.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Trump is abusing his authority as President acting like a child when something does not go his way. Typical Reps
@FoxNews Of course when he does get his way he lashes out like a child in this instant he fires someone typical Trump you happy now Fox News
@realDonaldTrump You can wait as long as it takes to get this people confirm these people is unqualified for these jobs they need vetting.
@FoxNews @Nigel_Farage This man needs to stay off TV with his radical agenda brainwashing Trump and the Fox News auidence.
I agree what protecting our country from terrorism but do it the right way through Congress with approval from both sides.
It's amazing that Fox News would cover for Trump after this bad executive order they would do and say anything to make him look good.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls This woman suppose to be counselor to President Trump she needs counseling herself sometimes saying stupid things.
https://t.co/FdxyxgMoke
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @repjohnlewis @WattersWorld Jesse nothing but a race baiter he is not a real journalist he is a comedy act for Fox.
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke People that watch Hannity gets stupider after listening to people that always agrees with him it is so one sided.
@FoxNews @THEHermanCain @POTUS Fox News need to drain the swamp with these stupid right-	 wingers saying stuff all the time that is not true
@seanhannity It was a lame interview lot of ass kissing the ABC News one was better and tougher not soft as this one with Trump biggest fan.
@thehill This should not be a surprise to anyone he is Trump biggest ass kisser. But the very first interview as president went to ABCNews.
You watch Fox News it is all Trump ass kissing all day no wonder he likes them so much they never challenge him or call out his lies.
@MSNBC They were going to vote for him from the beginning they scare of Trump they have no backbone hopefully Marco Rubio votes no.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump You can imagine Hannity will be in there 24/7 and Eric, Kimberly, and everyone at Fox News.
@Pigeonface_face @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Trust me the only media allow anytime is Fox News and his sidekick Hannity.
@ericbolling @SHO_Homeland @realDonaldTrump Who's the biggest Trump ass kisser on Fox News Eric Bolling or Sean Hannity.
@FoxNews @newtgingrich What Newt is saying is the same thing Republicans being doing the past 8 years when Dems do it Fox get outrage.
@thehill I hope someone leaks them so Republicans can fill what Democrats feel this past election what goes around comes around.
@FoxNews @FrankLuntz Luntz need to shut up was it out of control when they meet in 2009 with a plan to obstructe Obama the past 8 years.
@FoxNews @FrankLuntz America remember how Fox News acted when Obama was elected in 2008 like whinny brats espically Sean Hannity and so on.
@JDThomas760 @IlladelphAC @gabrielsherman Fox News has no journalists they all Trump puppets except the Dems that work there and Shep.
@brianstelter @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine She knew what she said the first time she just as erratic and stupid as Trump.
@OutFrontCNN This is going to be one the most unfit and most stupid press secertary we had in a while kinda like the president we have now.
After 8 years of Fox News dividing the country to make Obama look bad will it continue under their chosen leader Donald Trump.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @FoxNewsInsider Hannity and Fox News will be pandering to Trump the next four years.
@seanhannity That he is going to resigned as president and that he is not fit to hold the higest office in the land.
@FLOTUS Thank You for the last eight years you have been the greatest first lady we ever had thank for you service to this country https://t.co/b0WcBaCD8q
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You can expect him all the time to give interviews on Fox when President because they never challenge him.
But wait till Trump get in to the White House they will never challenge him or criticize him and he can do no wrong in their biased view.
You watch the dishonest biased media on Fox News all they do is bitch and complain about everything Obama do it's pathetic and shameful.
@DolcettDoug @777sjr @joey_girardi @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You were a child voting for this child to become President.
@FoxNews I don't blame them for not going I would not want to go and see a racist bigot being swearing in as our president neither.
@seanhannity Why did you go back to this racist baiting biased dump. Should stayed at fair and balance CNN not go back to Trump News Network
@seanhannity @IngrahamAngle Hannity were the same way when Obama won in 2008 and 2012 he a meltdown every night on his biased show.
@SandraSmithFox @FoxNewsInsider Nobody gonna want to watch Trump on Superbowl night. This about football not all about Trump on that night.
@FoxBusiness @GovMikeHuckabee Because at least they got a backbone to stand up to this bigot the conservative media don't they pander to him
@FoxBusiness @GovMikeHuckabee Democrats not going because he is not fit for the office and the conservative media can complain all they want
@FoxNews We Cowboys had a good season and maybe we make it to Superbowl next year #CowboysNation
@FoxNews @michellemalkin Good luck to Fox News they need to shut down that fake basied non news organization.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine All she do is complain about Trump being attack if she cant handle the attacks get off the air and go home.
@FoxNews @ericbolling This man needs all the help he can get and more than that he is not fit to lead this country.
@thehill Why am I not surprise. We all knew that was coming going to see his master because he is nothing but his puppet.
@FoxNews Good for her.
@cvpayne Time for Charles Payne to retire his biased show on FBN always having on conservatives talking about issues that favor Trump.
@cvpayne John Lewis is saying what mostly everyone else thinks that he is not legitimate and has no business being our President he is unfit
@FoxNews It is amazing how the conservative biased media got all up in arms over a painting when things don't fit their ideology they bitch.
@MtRushmore2016 This statement nothing but a fox news and hannity talking point get something more original and truthful.
@FoxNews @Scaramucci You not Eric and Hannity are the biggest Trump ass kissing on fox accept the channel itself.
You know Fox News always talking about hypocrisy this is it and what they did the past 8 years to Obama https://t.co/NZJH0sgr6P
@OutFrontCNN @CNNPolitics You need to step up your game on Trump and stop kissing his ass and grow a backbone.
@DolcettDoug @777sjr @joey_girardi @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump People like you are the ones he brainwashed to vote for him.
@seanhannity You are the reason why the media trust is the way it is today you talk out both sides of your mouth on certain issues.
@joey_girardi @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump We don't want it to come he ain't fit to be President.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump He ain't mad is he the other fake news out there righr now is Fox News and Trump every time he speaks.
@TawneeCowan @jessebwatters You made a typo next four years you mean right he will not be a two term president he might get impeached.
@jessebwatters And when someone attack FOX News you people can't handle it get over yourselves and start being a real news network.
@jessebwatters That is correct because no one cares about biased right-wing FOX News y'all attack other networks every single day and Dems.
@TrishIntel @BoDietl These stupid conservatives and Republicans need to shut up about this painting it is not that bad stop winning grow up.
@CNN @BernieSanders People complaining about Bernie on CNN again for town hall don't watch it then these town halls on CNN are very good.
@wedinsky @bikedb06 @greta @MSNBC Me too needs different analysis not just watching one channel I sample CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News.
@wedinsky @bikedb06 @greta @MSNBC Should we call Fox News Channel the Trump News Channel I think yes it the most biased network on TV.
@wedinsky @bikedb06 @greta @MSNBC All these Trump people calling CNN by that stupid nickname is very shameful.
@wedinsky @bikedb06 @greta @MSNBC No CNN and MSNBC are very fair and balance networks cover both sides unlike Fox its one sided favoring R's
@greta @MSNBC All these cry babies saying they not going to watch Greta on MSNBC grow up the channel is very  balanced and fair unlike FOX.
@bikedb06 @greta @MSNBC The only place that report false news is FoxNewsChannel aka FalseNewsChannel
@seanhannity I'll take Obama over Trump any day Trump has no business being President and Hannity has no business being on TV he's terrible.
@CNN You have made me proud Michelle Obama for being greatest first lady we had in a very long time. You will be miss you and the President.
@greta @MSNBC Yes Greta I will watch your show on MSNBC better network than Fox News biased right wing Trump ass kissing network.
@FoxNews You get over it snowflake you fail to become President twice you no better then Cilinton losing twice at least she made it further.
@FoxNewsInsider @KellyannePolls @oreillyfactor @ericbolling This woman needs to stop coming on TV saying these stupid things stay off.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Anyone needs to leave on 1/20 should be Trump resigning as President he is not fit for the job.
@thehill He needs to grow up and stop acting like a fool he is the President now grow up and stop your temper tantrums and lead the country.
@FoxNews @jessebwatters @IvankaTrump I agree with this man don't talk to this so called stupid racist journalist he is nothing but comedy.

@seanhannity No, Anyone playing politics is Hannity sucking up to Trump by telling his viewers lies every time he speaks.
@LouDobbs @petehoekstra It's amazing how you have these old guests on every night who says the most one sided right wing comments. #SoBiased
@seanhannity No because people need healthcare and conservatives and Republicans are stupid to repeal it.
@TuckerCarlson @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews We do not need right-wing conservative bigots teaching our young generations like you Tucker.
@Rushluver @TrishIntel @FoxNews  No way she is biased on FBN at 2pm we do not need her in primetime.
@SenSanders We all know this man is a big liar it is nothing we already don't know
@cvpayne Why did you not report on Republican obstructionism when Obama was elected in 2009 till 2016 now Dems do it to Trump its a problem
@seanhannity Obama and Clinton not Hannity and Assange brainwashing 	people to help out Trump just pathetic and bad journalism.
@FoxBusiness Why are you now reporting on this story when this been going on for a while smells political to me. But of course its Fox.
@foxandfriends @TomFitton You and biased Fox News just hating on Obama and his accomplishments get a life and start reporting honestly.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS The best White House we had in a long time going to miss Obama whitehouse now we have this liar taking the oath of office
Happy New Year"s Twitter
I like to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas.
@FoxBusiness @JudgeJeanine She needs to retire from her show because she is nothing but a lousy and biased host who kisses up to Trump.
@brickwahl1 @seanhannity @wikileaks I agree Fox News is a extension of the RNC, and you watch the channel it's nothing but Trump ass kissing
It's amazing how Fox News was all up in arms over Jill/Hillary recount effort but you never saw them report  on what the GOP doing in NC.
@ericbolling @FoxNews Please stop guest hosting The Factor you are a terrible biased host even on your other show The Five. #Leave
@seanhannity @larryelder @realDonaldTrump It's not different to what Hannity did the last eight years bashing Obama every single night.
@FoxNews In 2018 this majority will disappear so enjoy it while it lasts because Democrats will take back the Senate and the House.
It's amazing how Fox News report false stories about Hillary Clinton getting indicted to get Trump elected that is just wrong and biased
You wonder why the trust in media at a all time low Fox News is to blame for these one sided stories they cover every day in favoring Trump.
It's amazing how biased and one sided Fox News has been in the last week of this campaign they trying to get Trump elected at all costs.
It's amazing how Trump and the Republican party and FOX News blast  FBI Comey before now reopen investigation they kissing his ass. Typical!
You notice after every debate the Trump campaign goes to Fox News about how the debate goes very telling they go where they get easy 	Q&amp;A.
We all know Hillary won last debate but you watch Fox News you hear a different story that there guy Trump won when anybody knows he was bad
It's amazing how @FoxNews criticize CNN and MSNBC and other mainstream media are for Clinton when FOX News and FOX Business are for Trump.
I think @HillaryClinton should skip next debate the moderator will be biased towards her he from FOX News and he going to try and help Trump
#debate This Trump campaign senior adviser @BorisEP is so stupid when he is on TV say the same thing every time he is interview.
#debate @realDonaldTrump has the most stupid campaign I have every seen in politics. If this man is elected we will have a pervert in WH.
VOTE Hillary or this country will fall like Lego blocks because Trump does not know what he talking about he be stupid president.  #debate
@realDonaldTrump was terrible at debate all he did was lie every time never answer any question he would be terrible as presient.#debate
It's amazing that we have a pervert running for president in Trump and Fox News doing all they can to get him elected just pathetic.
@NBCNews Of course he is not going to extend voter registration he supports Trump and he know if he extends it he would be hurting Trump.
It's amazing how Fox News will say or do anything to get Trump to be our next president. They report on Clinton every 5 min but not Trump.
Why do people watch @FoxNews they always talking about liberal media bias when they are part of the Trump campaign think tank that is bias.
@seanhannity @mike_pence So you can suck up to him and kiss his ass about how great he was last night so typical biased deplorable Hannity.
@TwitterMoments He does these stupid racist segments every week to bash Hillary and Obama and kiss Trump ass and promote him. #SoBiased
It's amazing how @FoxNews complains about Tim Kane interrupts Mike Pence but at last president debate Trump did it to Hillary it was fine.
You talk about biased media watch @FoxNews they promote Trump campaign every day and they have nerve to talk about mainstream liberal media.
The Trump campaign knows he was terrible last night at the debate they already saying skip next debate. #Shameful coming from own campaign.
One show on @FoxNews thought Trump did maleficent last night and we all know that show Trump Kiss Ass @seanhannity number 1 fan.

@FoxBusiness @HillaryClinton 	It is a shame Fox News and Fox Business used this woman all the time for political points. #Shame on FOX
@JebBush 	The only thing that failed America was your brother's lying to America about weapons of mass destruction.
@FoxNews @deneenborelli @HillaryClinton 	You are wrong Fox News all about power and no shred of principle. #biasfoxnews # Trump Media
@FoxNews @HowardKurtz 	Do you think if Trump had a bad week they would recap that. #No #BiasFoxNews
@thehill Anything for a photo op. Donald Trump only went to make Obama look bad and for #FNC aka #Republican News Channel to talk shit.
