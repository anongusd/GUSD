“For Trump, this is what loyalty looks like: subservience. Putting federal law enforcement under his personal, political control would be a danger to the constitutional order.” https://t.co/NsFVYdlCYv
“Trump’s enablers in politics and the media are reducing the political cost of undemocratic rhetoric and behavior. They are hurting the country in sad and lasting ways. “ https://t.co/NsFVYdlCYv
“If Trump were a typical politician, other Republicans could keep their heads down and wait for the storm to pass. If his ambitions are autocratic, the cowardice of elected Republicans is indefensible and near to unforgivable.” https://t.co/NsFVYdlCYv
“Much about the future of American politics — and the historical judgment that will be visited on those associated with it — depends on the answer to one question: Is President Trump an instinctual demagogue or an instinctual authoritarian?” https://t.co/NsFVYdlCYv

Could be a big day for the president: Perhaps he will fire Assad and send missiles at Mueller. Or vise versa. Who the hell knows.
“It’s hard to call an investigation a ‘witch hunt’ when it has already resulted in 19 individuals being charged with crimes, including 5 who pleaded guilty and one who’s been sentenced to jail (for 30 days). That’s quite a rap sheet for an ongoing probe.” https://t.co/6n0mlg25Le
BIll Clinton would have had the same feelings as Trump. But I bet that his “reaction” would not have been a snarling, unhinged, repetitive, partially-incoherent public tantrum in the Cabinet Room claiming the pursuit of an FBI investigation to be “an attack on our country.” https://t.co/XUtCeZnGGH
“There are problems when politics ceases to be the realm of partial agreement and becomes a conflict of social movements... Opponents are dehumanized and viewed as enemies. The cruel and intemperate come to dominate our political life.” https://t.co/OGdL7FWwDJ
“If the response to Trump is a general radicalization of American politics, the damage will last generations. Somehow, in the midst of so much fanaticism, moderation must find a passion of its own.” https://t.co/OGdL7FWwDJ
“Trump’s extremism — his misogyny and nativism — has encouraged ideological ambition in his opponents. His vulnerability is taken, not as an opportunity to build a broad political coalition against Trumpism, but as a chance to win without compromise.” https://t.co/OGdL7FWwDJ

“Because Trump lacks grounding, the content of his instincts often seems determined by the last person who captures his attention. The rootless are easily shifted, as everyone from the leaders of China to the hosts of ‘Fox &amp; Friends’ has discovered.” https://t.co/IhlpNqn3Gq

The Oval Office deserves better than Trump https://t.co/N5pH8JNjf0
"He describes himself in terms that would have embarrassed King Louis XIV. He conducts himself with the decorum of a spoiled and nasty child — elevating lackeys, treating professionals at the FBI or CIA like minions, blurting out obvious lies." https://t.co/N5pH8JNjf0
“He is vandalizing the one house he cannot buy or own.” https://t.co/4c1IkPyqNX
“This president has abandoned even lip service to these ideals, conducting himself like the chief executive of a shady casino company seeking to build his fortune and destroy his competition. Which is exactly what Trump has always been.” https://t.co/4c1IkPyqNX
“By even the most generous standards, Trump is a figure of monumental smallness.” https://t.co/4c1IkPyqNX

And when a president endorses anti-Muslim propaganda, he is defaming millions of Muslim Americans, encouraging hate crimes, alienating Muslim allies in the war against terrorism, and increasing the risk to American military forces fighting beside those allies.
It should go without saying – though in the Trump era many ethical rules seem to require resaying – but when a president uses the power of his office, even in a tweet, to attack a private citizen who he regards as an enemy, he is engaged in a serious abuse of power.

"Protection lead to prosperity." Won't "impose our way of life." So much for conservative economics and democracy. Lindbergh returns.
With malice toward many. And charity is for losers.
If you are disposed to fear executive power, the speech only fed your concerns. "The hour of action" has an ominous, threatening feel.
Trump brought the culture war to the solemn, center stage of American democracy, and cheapened the office and the moment.
It is truly shocking how disconnected this speech was from inaugural history. An inaugural for red American alone.
Trump has only one style of leadership -- amplify resentments to intimidate opponents and force change.
There was the "New Deal," the "New Frontier." We have been treated to the "American Carnage" speech.
