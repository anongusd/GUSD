#Whatcom Cnty Council has made a final decision on the #GPT/CH2M Hill contract. Check this week's Northern Light for full story.
Cnty council meeting still going on. #GPT/CH2M Hill contract changes approved; complete contract not yet approved.
Both amendments to #GPT/CH2M Hill contract passed; conflict o' interest strengthened and scoping comment period expanded to 120 days.
2 changes to contract w/ CH2M Hill offered: one strengthens conflict of interest language, other expands comment period to 120 days.
Council meeting starting back up now. Just an item or two before #GPT environmental review contract presentation.
Still some #GPT interested folks waiting around now. Council in the middle of 5 minute recess.
Council chambers practically emptied after open session. Were they not aware council discussion still to be had on #GPT contract?
And... open session just ended. Still presentation on #GPT environmental study contract to be given by county staff.
"120 days" seems to be main concern for #GPT environmental review. Current scoping period is set at 30 days, not 60 as previously reported.
Sorry for the delay. Signal was wonky. @WWU student speaking now; wants #GPT scoping period 120 for students' sake.
#Bham resident Dan McShane: How the council proceeds with contract, scoping period will reflect council's values on public involvement #GPT
Current #GPT enviro study scoping session, figuring out what will be studied, is set at 60 days. Many people want longer than 60 days.
Duane Jager, #Bham resident: "60 days? (for #GPT enviro. study). I scoped my kitchen remodel for 60 days."
Former Bham Technical College surveying prof thinks CH2M Hill, firm floated to perform #GPT enviro. study, is an "exemplary firm."
County resident Jim Groves RE #GPT environmental study: "I think this thing has been talked to death."  Would like to see action.
Resident commented that contract for #GPT environmental study is not adequate in public disclosure, amount of public comment period aspects
Here's tonight's county council agenda for reference: http://t.co/VIPbB2ax #GPT
After first comment was #GatewayPacificTerminal related, county council chair said #GPT comments can only be on the two GPT items on agenda
Open session coming up at #Whatcom Cnty Council. If anyone wants to talk about #GatewayPacificTerminal, this would be the time. #GPT
At start of #Whatcom Cnty Council meeting, the council chambers are hardly packed. #GPT
Seem to be a few pro #GatewayPacificTerminal residents trickling in. #GPT
There are two video cameras at #Whatcom Cnty Council meeting tonight, up from the normal one. #GPT
Rumor is strong anti-coal contigent may turn up at tonight's #Whatcom Cnty Council meeting for #GPT discussion meeting. Nothing of note yet.

#CherryPoint Recovery: Container is about 20 feet above the water now. Carrier barge is now moving into place.
#CherryPoint Recovery: Container looks to be completely out of the water now. No damage seen.
#CherryPoint Recovery: Crane crews do not think the container is full of water, based on its weight. Container puncture was a concern.
