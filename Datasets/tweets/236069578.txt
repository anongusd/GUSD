At the hearing, prosecutor declined to pursue misdemeanor reckless driving charges and traffic citations. The felony moves forward, though.
Officer testified he saw Derek Wilder pop a wheelie. Wilder was wearing a GoPro on his helmet, according to officer's testimony.
At a preliminary hearing today in Chesapeake, a judge found probable cause on the felony and sent the charges forward to the grand jury.
Felony eluding case against ODU linebacker Derek Wilder and former player Aquante Thornton moving forward to Circuit Court.

Mayor Alan Krasnoff and Sgt. Jason Banks of the Chesapeake Police Department each led a prayer.
At tonight's service, congregants prayed for the community and for police. They prayed against racism. For love over violence. For unity.
All planned before recent police shootings, Bishop Brown says.
The church hosted a meal yesterday for members of the sheriff's office and their families. Will do same for police and probation officers.
"I believe prayer is the foundation of being able to heal our nation."

Defense attorney: "Ms. Slaton loved Quincy."
Prosecutor said the manner of his death is "inconsistent with natural death."
He disappeared in '04 but was never reported missing. A state trooper found his body in the trunk of Slaton's car in June.
Slaton was arraigned this morning in Hampton Circuit Court on a charge of  2nd-degree murder in Quincy Davis' death.
Tonya Slaton's attorney said he hasn't seen any evidence that indicates she killed her son, Quincy, "or even that a homicide occurred."
