@markhealey I do know that it was serving as a creative outlet (sometimes falsely so?), and those forms of expression are important to me. The mindless scrolling I could do without, though.
@markhealey 👏 Nice! One thought in back of my mind, mostly irrational, is the feeling that by not sharing there I am somehow going to be forgotten by, or less-relevant to that group of people. But who am I trying to impress or what am I trying to accomplish?
But living vicariously through other’s experiences (including those you don’t know personally), and sharing what cool thing you’re doing is addicting. I still find myself thinking “I should add this to my Story”.
I dropped Instagram from my phone almost a week ago as a temporary break, but it’s feeling good. Saving design inspiration is probably what I miss most, as my family photo sharing happens on Notabli.

.@Intercom is truly a great product, and @intercombrandtm is fun to keep up — love seeing their work make its way into the marketing and product, but I’d love to see @eoghan and team be more accommodating to companies with different business models and/or smaller budgets.
To be fair, they do offer an early-stage company plan, but you need to apply and it comes with quite a few restrictions, including only allowing for 250 users (not really helpful for a freemium model product with many more users — most who don't pay).
But pricing per number of all tracked users adds up too quickly. What about charging per active users, or better yet a flat rate based on products needed and number of team members with access?
At Notabli, Intercom is our largest "non-essential" (as in the product would function without it) expense. Maybe early-stage companies with more users than revenue, just aren't their target audience.
I really dislike that @intercom sends email updates about how much money they've raised. I'm sure it's exciting for their team and will go towards improving their already great products, but it feels wrong when it's so expensive to use.

@benthompson @drbarnard Seems likely we could see ability to switch sides in a software update, as there seems to be no reason for side other than preference.
Ideal phone, for me, would be the iPhone 7 form factor with full screen and Face ID. No reason to ever go back to a home button.
Would gladly skip wireless charging for a non-glass back (less to break and weight savings).
Went on my first run without a phone in a while. Too heavy for a pocket, not great to hold. (Apple would runners to have the Watch anyway.)
Slightly larger and thicker than the iPhone 7 and some 37g heavier, it’s more difficult to handle with confidence.
iPhone X is very good: Hardware – software harmony, Face ID ✨, screen, cameras, gesture-based navigation. Primary drawback: it’s heavy.
