Per usual, BGOV readers can read more about student veterans housing rate and underpayment reimbursements here: https://t.co/vKVZFQIW3H		And remember: VA's new new deadline for implementing requirements under the Forever GI Bill is Dec. 1, 2019
Cashour also said "VA will issue an additional payment to GI Bill students who were underpaid for applicable terms.  Future terms will be processed at the current academic year rates."
VA Spokesman Curt Cashour told me today that additional payment will cover whatever amount VA may have underpaid a student for the Fall 2018 term in order to make them whole. Important bc the VA was tasked with recalculating the student housing stipends in a couple of ways.
This underpayment correction is in line with what multiple VA officials have told lawmakers, staff, press etc. recently. They've also said that student veterans who were overpaid will not have to pay the VA back.
As a part of changes announced today, the VA will pay student veterans housing stipends at the DOD basic housing allowance rate by the end of 2018. The VA also said it will "correct retroactively any underpayments resulting from section 107 and 501 implementation problems."
Lots of questions about the VA potentially going back on its promise to retroactively correct underpayments to student veterans &amp; its likely Under Secretary for Benefits Paul Lawrence will have to field questions about this at a House hearing tomorrow morning.		In the meantime...
