President Trump, why don‚Äôt you take an afternoon trip to the border - Tijuana - and meet the children in that ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù you‚Äôre so fretted up about? Why don‚Äôt you do that?
That standoff along the southern border - there are small children involved. Families that fled to find safety, freedom, a better life for the children. Who are we now, here in the land of freedom dreamed of by our own immigrant ancestors?
It‚Äôs not looking good for the sanctuary seekers along the southern border. U.S. government officials say there‚Äôs no room at the inn - that is, sorry, centers are full. How long have they known these folks were coming??
Congratulations, candidate Painter. I‚Äôm always impressed by your knowledge of the legal and ethical requirements to our elected government positions. Well-spoken, plain spoken, you always look out for the well-being of our democracy, for all of us. https://t.co/mEoLlOwr3p
@RWPUSA Cheers! Great news, Richard Painter! Principled. Ethical. Intelligent. Plain spoken. We need you in the Senate, without a doubt.
Keep the weary, hopeful travelers in mind at the southern border, asking for sanctuary as they flee untenable, dangerous conditions we can hardly imagine. Providing sanctuary is a legitimate function of the U.S. Are you really Nobel worthy, Mr. President?
