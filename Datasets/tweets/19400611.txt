The most profound moment from President Trump at CPAC was recounting his trip to Iraq.  The numbers, which didn't include death toll of American troops currently 4,566 (3 in 2019).  	20 years	$7.0 trillion	0 landing lights	Sobering moment we must all ponder for future decisions.

@KamalaHarris with all due respect those talking points are doing more harm than good and masking the fact the American promise of full employment and higher wages is rapidly re-establishing itself.

Time to fix immigration issue from security to legal loopholes to dealing with the Dreamers.  If everyone negotiates in good faith an honest deal can be achieved.
President Trump did the right thing on Friday because too many Americans were being hurt. He will always lose the media-driven blame game so that should be irrelevant in his decision-making. By the same token he should be looking for a wins for all Americans.
When those policies, are creating jobs and higher wages, wider prosperity and optimism it's a win for America not a person or party. Oddly that narrative has been nonexistent the last two years and those "wins" hardly reported.
When the media frames President Trump reopening government as a "win" for Pelosi it underscores the true source of division and divisiness in the country.  Government should always be seeking policies that benefit the nation.

That's when someone tapped me on the back.  I turned and it was the woman, standing there with tears in her eyes.  She reached out hug me and told me she could buy her medicine.  Her emotions were so powerful and I hugged her back as I shed a couple tears, too.
Today I was rushing home walking through Time Square when I had to stop for traffic.  There was a homeless women sitting under the sign with her head down. I slipped $50 bill into the hat she was using to collect any donations.  I turn back and waited for the light to change.

Saying financial markets got weak in the beginning of the fourth because of concerns US economy was slowing down but not mentioning his Oct 3 snafu a little specious.
Other than that I don't see what else Powell might have been said or not said - He described a Goldilocks US economy and seems proud of the economy. Saying he wants to keep it going.
This dovetails with the warning from Fitch yesterday that if the debt ceiling isn't raised America's economic standing will be hit hard (and their rating lowered from AAA).  This makes the shutdown a bigger deal the longer it goes on.
Powell Interview	When Rubenstein recalled how Powell shot to prominence in DC circles when he was at the Bipartisan Policy Center and pushed Congress to raise the debt ceiling in 2011.  He talked about incoming bills to bolster his case not hiking the ceiling would be a disaster.

After a decade without any rate hikes and $4.5 trillion in printed money the onslaught of rate hikes is a BIG DEAL especially as $50.0 billion a month in former accommodation is being removed as well.

One day the nation will heal itself but that doesn't mean it might not get worse before it gets better.
There are sick people in our society for sure and career criminals whose sins we should never ascribe to others.  That said the article in the @TheAtlantic that blames criticism and legitimate worry over the migrant caravan for Saturday's massacre is itself an evil piece of work.
This weekend 34 shot in (3 fatally) in Chicago and media calls it "gun violence" never Bloods killing Crips and never blaming elected officials other than those in favor of the 2nd Amendment. Disingenuous reporting reporting has enabled the slaughter of inner city youth for years
I'm an eternal optimist but realize there is too much media/elitist animosity toward Trump to see any real healing.  I agree the Commander in Chief has to lead and when he does it should be reported without whataboutism currently used to mitigate every effort and accomplishment.
