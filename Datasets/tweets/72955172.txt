@AlenciaJohnson So we're clear: @PPFA has fought to enable abortions up until birth (even including partial birth abortion, but y'all lost that fight).

@21stintheUSA Really? How many women died "breaking the law"? Women still die, today, with LEGAL abortion. Are you saying that there were more abortions BEFORE Roe? And, are you saying that there is no billion-dollar abortion industry? It seems you're unfamiliar with what "industry" means.
@rieth_damon @PPFA is given half a billion tax-dollars each year, and they kill over 320,000 humans each year. (Shhhhh, don't tell anyone but that funding is "Big Government"). Our tax-dollars funding the nation's largest abortion chain and funding abortions through #Medicaid IS our business.

More #fakenews from @PolitiFact as it cites only pro-abortion sources to defend extremism of NY's #ReproductiveHealthAct. @ciaraorourke lacks knowledge of #Roe &amp; #Doe rulings ("health"=any reason). It's why Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act had to be passed. https://t.co/CAcAnMCnci

Pro-abortion Liam Neeson's racism ain't got nothin' on this. Pro-infanticide Dem-in-blackface-or-KKK-garb @GovernorVA might be replaced by equally pro-abortion @LGJustinFairfax.

Fred Korematsu's fight against the injustice of internment (as a Japanese-American) reminds us of how supremely wrong #SCOTUS can be. Dred v Sandford. Plessy v Ferguson. Minor v Happersett. Roe v Wade. Doe v Bolton. And many more. #ChecksAndBalances #LegalDoesntMeanMoral https://t.co/vKyApS5yfl
@dbtclctor2 @billwowdotcom @andrewcuomo @GovernorVA @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @NYGovCuomo Sure. And no one who fought to protect and expand slavery was PRO-SLAVERY.

Because abortion kills and harms.

@ravenwolf68 @LeahNTorres @marygribbin809 Tell that to our adopted children. What a lazy liberal canard. You can't justify slaughtering innocent human life so you go with a desperate and laughable accusation. We hate violence, whether perpetrated by those with guns or those with forceps. https://t.co/iPcHlrApe7
Fannie Lou Hamer considered abortion to be genocide. (Jesse Jackson did, too, until politics replaced his principles.) We‚Äôre sick and tired of being sick and tired of the fatal systemic racism of the abortion industry. All #blacklivesmatter. https://t.co/qvlnmxfFa8

Do all #blacklivesmatter? If they don't matter when they're most vulnerable, most marginalized, most powerless, do they really matter? Abortion is #1 killer in black community. "Injustice anywhere (including the womb) is a threat to justice everywhere." https://t.co/N5QQdaCCLQ https://t.co/Wz2bBHjQPf
@Heather_mom43 @illumin8rr @theladykatie @bacchus13104 @NYGovCuomo @cessilyersmith @NWFproTX If by "safe" you mean the unborn child is brutally killed and the mother is often emotionally, physically, and mentally harmed...sure.

@LeahNTorres @marygribbin809 There should always be a stigma attached to deliberately killing innocent human beings. And you do it for profit. Even you can escape your own callousness and self-delusion. There are many ex-abortionists who finally saw abortion for the violence it is. Violence doesn't empower. https://t.co/wczb3nZYyx
@LeahNTorres @marygribbin809 I was conceived in rape, had a birthmom who chose adoption over violence of abortion, grew up in multiracial family of 13 kids (10 adopted), am an adoptive dad, &amp; raise millions for pregnancy centers that care for mother &amp; child. An abortionist, like you, can't grasp my purpose. https://t.co/dSsIoVz0TG
@marygribbin809 @LeahNTorres So you're a parasite? If once a parasite, always a parasite. We're sorry an abortionist killed your child.

.@PPFA says black people who oppose abortion aren't really black people--they're "hoteps". Abortion is not a straight, white, evangelical male issue. It's a violent human issue. #Prolife Dr. Mildred Jefferson recognized that, @AlenciaJohnson. #NegroProject #Eugenics #Racism https://t.co/Tj2z5L6yLn
Dear @AlenciaJohnson &amp; any others who participate in @PPFA's Negro Project 2.0, you're aiding and abetting a billion $$$ biz birthed in racism. #PlannedParenthood's DNA never changed.

@kelseysportsman You're not "disappointed". You're uninformed. THIS is white supremacy??? https://t.co/rlK9dalbT1 (one of our initiatives to deal with what Fannie Lou Hamer called "black genocide")? Takes nothing to tweet ignorance. Sometimes takes centuries to overcome it.
@kelseysportsman I'm as black as Obama, so there's that. Real genocide is when humans are killed by the millions via abortions (61+ million since 1973). Preventing the unborn from being killed &amp; cherishing motherhood doesn't buttress white supremacy. Defending the weak always buttresses humanity.
Today should be a reminder that genocide against any group of humans is wrong. Dead wrong. Today, the billion-dollar abortion industry--mostly via @PPFA--marginalizes and mutilates the most vulnerable in what should be their rightful place--the womb. #IndigenousPeoplesDay2018 https://t.co/cRXuPqjCQV
@BitterGriff The #MeToo movement is an idol. Allegiance to a political party that will do anything to destroy someone is an idol. Pretending that someone's baseless testimony has any truth to it is an idol. Kavanaugh isn't God. Neither political party is our Savior. Jesus is. John 14:6.

@vanreuter @LilaGraceRose @LiveAction @TheAtlantic You got it all twisted.

Accusations are forever...true or not. Just putting this out there for those who care about getting facts straight. Here's what the sex-crimes prosecutor, who questioned Dr. Ford, thinks about her allegations. https://t.co/M2yz9Q1rhU #KavanaughHearings #KavanaughFord
@LookBckMveFrwrd I was one of those who allegedly would "not be loved or cared for" but was adopted and loved instead, along with nine of my other 12 siblings. I'm an adoptive father. There's no such thing as unwanted. https://t.co/fxiMRCJv0o
@LookBckMveFrwrd An embryo is an unborn child, btw, as definitions go. If being neglected is a qualification for being killed, then why not kill those at any stage of human development? Societies should always be concerned about the killing of any innocent human life. It's not a "women's" issue.
@LookBckMveFrwrd Yes. And you missed point one--we're dedicated to the truth. We're not abandoning an incredibly qualified &amp; highly praised judge bcs of an 11th hour desperate political attack. We expect the FBI investigation will only reaffirm the current uncorroborated nature of the accusation.
Great and surprising news! CA Governor @JerryBrownGov unexpectedly vetoed a radical pro-abortion bill that required all CA public universities to provide (taxpayer-funded) abortion drugs (up to 10 weeks). Students need education, not human elimination. https://t.co/tA2MXFeCVU
@LookBckMveFrwrd Irony alert: You say in your bio that "Life is about love, laughter and helping others." Killing innocent humans (aka "unwanted fetuses") isn't loving, isn't funny, and never helps the child or the mother harmed by such an act of violence.
@LookBckMveFrwrd One. We're dedicated to the truth. Two. We're dedicated to ending the violence of abortion. Three. We're tired of politicians &amp; activists exploiting sexual assault (it's how we got #Roe in the first place...Jane Roe falsely claimed she had been raped). https://t.co/YOe2klU6CK

Found it compelling that during the #KavanaughHearings, Prosecutor Mitchell ascertained that Dr. Ford didn't pursue counseling methods to better her memory recall. She lawyered up and went to the press instead. Very telling. Pray for healing all around. Lives have been destroyed.
@KiraBarman You obviously didn't read the article. Yes. Sometimes men ARE the victims. Sometimes women are the victims. Are you suggesting that modern women don't lie? Duke? Asia Argento? This is the problem w/ modern feminism and all of its misandry. It doesn't matter who the lie destroys.

The @DNC was once the Party of slavery, the KKK, lynching and Jim Crow. It has reached into its roots to try to politically lynch Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Yes, @SenBooker. There is a culture of sexual assault in this country. And it's led by a billion-dollar abortion biz that YOU support, that enables and empowers predators by refusing to report rape. #KavanaughHearings #IAmSpartacus https://t.co/oKjMQ8V5W1

@angell2ooo @HumanDefenseINI Interesting. Pregnancy centers are the only ones that encourage women to see their ultrasounds. They're the only ones who don't hide that info.

@moonpieluva So...where is there a right to kill an innocent human in the Constitution? The creation of a life involves both woman &amp; man.

@SuzanneFLCPA It's exactly because we care about the poor that we constantly call out @PPFA. If you read anything we've written, you'd know that. #PlannedParenthood has defrauded @MedicaidGov of millions, stealing from the poor, yet they're still part of program.

@Asola320 @PPFA @CNN @Beyonce @serenawilliams Sure. We'll stop coming at you w/ history and facts. ü§£ You apparently missed the part where Sanger advocated forced sterilizations up until WWII.

@Asola320 @PPFA @CNN @Beyonce @serenawilliams This is why history and reading matter. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Planned Parenthood was birthed in eugenics. Sanger was a leading eugenicist. "Birth control and abortion are turning out to be great eugenic advances of our time"--Frederick Osborn, founder of the American Eugenics Society https://t.co/fXJECVyYNG
@Asola320 @PPFA @CNN @Beyonce @serenawilliams Also...this conclusion by that study: "No surveillance system captures abortion-related morbidity...Furthermore, complication rates are underestimated by low follow-up rates...Published complication rates are considered incomplete...". Hmm, bcs there's no law requiring reporting.
@Asola320 @PPFA @CNN @Beyonce @serenawilliams Did you see the photo of the mutilated aborted baby? No study changes the reality of that violence. You seem to confuse "violence" with pro-abortion researchers assessment of "safety" to the mother. On both counts, they're wrong, hence https://t.co/lTivB56yze. (Plenty of links.)

@co0lslut_ @SBAList Most sources put miscarriage of pregnancies at 10-20%, so there's that. More importantly, people die all the time. Some by natural causes, some by murder. Should we not have laws about murder? Induced abortion is not a natural cause. So...what's your point?

@KratosLiving @PaulBois39 @realDailyWire @instagram @PPFA Hi Miranda. We will post our Fall schedule in the next week.
@GeorgeGmitro @StudentsforLife @SBAList Awesome. We are aware of her. A #prolife Democrat and passionate advocate for the poor. We will be making a series of memes featuring her powerful words! Thank you!
"As a single mom &amp; woman of color, I‚Äôve known a thing or two about discrimination over the years. But I have never known vindictive religious discrimination like this."--Sharon Fulton, foster mom of 40+ kiddos, who worked through Catholic Social Services.  https://t.co/3gnjPRbj7W https://t.co/kmxgvoQdsW
When pro-abortion Dems talk about corporate corruption, they never go after @PPFA for defrauding #Medicaid &amp; other taxpayer-funded programs of over $132 million. It's just too hard to bite the hand that feeds you. Big Abortion. Corrupt. No Matter What. https://t.co/X2YBba13Qy https://t.co/Adx7ISfRCr
Thx @PaulBois39 @realDailyWire for covering @Instagram's censorship of our content calling out the evil of racial violence, no matter the era. Those offended by invoking the KKK &amp; @PPFA in same meme simply don't know #PlannedParenthood's history. https://t.co/3qd9JIYhaH #Eugenics
The @NAACP--formed to stop racial violence--radically supports violence of #abortion &amp; @PPFA. The #civilrights org even sued us for calling them the Nat'l Association for the Abortion of Colored People. They lost. Turns out #freespeech is a civil right. https://t.co/ojfjFJ7tfs https://t.co/HB1xclwj9A

@C_j_me_9000 @michelleisawolf No evidence? It's called science--human embryology. Human life begins at fertilization, not when a heartbeat can be detected. The lives of both mother and unborn child are equally important. Abortion values neither life. https://t.co/E1tUQzMjRU https://t.co/aUoOSzCULq

Faith-based agencies were caring for vulnerable children, through #adoption and #fostercare, looooooooong before #LGBT orgs ever existed.

@NARAL Funny. Seven men in black robes gave us the violence of #Roe. But thx for your gender animus. Nothing like a little misandry mixed in with pro-abortion zealotry.

@nakshatradevi @michelleisawolf Violence is ripping a human apart limb from limb. A 6 yr old is not "wholly formed", btw. You clearly need some prenatal human development 101 (as evidenced by your whole anti-science, #prochoice 'clump of cells' mantra). Learn here: https://t.co/sHuFN2YbHr

The #Constitution was designed to be revised. But not by the judicial branch.

@jesseawayne1 @riseandresistny @PPFA One. The topic is not "concentration camps". Don't trivialize millions of deaths by pretending that an illegal immigration policy (separating families) that you disagree with (as we do) is akin to the Holocaust. Two. You've responded numerous times, "wasting time" on my opinions.
@jesseawayne1 @riseandresistny @PPFA You clearly didn't read the article. If you're referring to this vid https://t.co/QtEnnnqQhX, that's ME giving an informed opinion as an adoptee w/ an adoptive sister who was a refugee. Why is reading before tweeting sooooo hard?

@TrumpocalypseN Love when pro-abortion folks show their disdain for other humans. Never grew up in trailer. Those who do are just as valuable. Everyone in this pic is very educated, btw, with Masters, Ph.D.s, and S.H.K.s. Degrees are not the pinnacle. Compassion &amp; kindness toward the weak is.
@TrumpocalypseN Not that your tweet is worth responding to, but we love to educate. There are no two examples in American jurisprudence more closely tied than slavery &amp; abortion. Both #Dred &amp; #Roe rulings, 7-2, determined certain humans were not persons &amp; could be bought, sold &amp; killed at will.
Abortion is healthcare? Sure. And slavery was job security. https://t.co/rlK9dalbT1 #4thofJuly2018 #Freedom #CreatedEqual https://t.co/VsnQBER9dj
@DrWillieParker No. Evangelicals don't "forget" that Joseph, who adopted Jesus, fled from a murderous tyrant (King Herod) who slaughtered babies in an attempt to kill the Messiah. You're an abortionist who has slaughtered thousands in the name of religion. So, we're thinking you have zero cred. https://t.co/wqFpgY5jV9
@KamalaHarris This is a parody site, right? You receive campaign $$$ from a global abortion org that daily rips babies from their mothers...for profit. Speaking of transnational criminal organizations, did you prosecute corrupt @PPFA for #Medicaid #TitleX fraud in CA? https://t.co/QoSxOhgDdL https://t.co/q50XLvCejm
@SgtElzetta We hear ya, but we're less concerned about their religious affiliation than their Constitutional dedication. When they flagrantly ignore the Law of the Land (like Sotomayor, Breyer, Kagan, &amp; Ginsburg), it's not their religion that makes them unfit...it's their judicial activism.
Conservatives and/or Christians need to understand the nature of progressive "tolerance". It's not a street, so it can never be two-way. It's a single-edged sword. And it's meant to wound. https://t.co/YEL6GIUnqx
@thevelvetbrick1 @rachelheldevans Too many Evangelical influencers like Rachel, have no use for the facts. Such an illustration of Eph 4:14. As Christians, we know that Truth sets us free in the spiritual realm, but many (like Rachel) seem to have no use for truths that set us free in this physical one.
So when "progressives" try to compare #LGBT activism with the blood-bought #civilrights struggle of black Americans, ask yourself--which MLK event was corporate-sponsored? Which fire trucks flew "Black is Beautiful" flags? No comparison. At all. https://t.co/uVM7c0WnDC https://t.co/ruNRjIN0bj
What do you do when you have no argument against the violence of abortion? You call pro-lifers "racist" and accuse them of being "oppressors". When liberal "Christians", like @RachelHeldEvans, parrot #PlannedParenthood's talking points...  https://t.co/ZeoH57ZDsf https://t.co/FCfkYh183i

@MershMersh Calling someone 'pro-birth' is like accusing someone of being pro-breathing. Both are natural biological processes necessary for every human life. Helps to watch vid or read the article. Words have meaning. You're confusing Pro-life cause with the entire call of Christianity.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 should've been the #GOP's Civil Rights Act of 1875, which the supremely wrong #SCOTUS (e.g. #Dred, #Plessy, #Korematsu, #Roe) ruled unconstitutional.

The @Blklivesmatter mov't partners w/ #1 killer of black lives--@PPFA. You've sacrificed millions of black babies bcs you don't believe they're equal.

@404UserNotFond Adoption is only part of answer. Elevating human dignity is a multi-faceted approach. We'll keep doing what the #prolife mov't has been doing. Church should play a much bigger role. Stop pretending that killing the "unwanted" is healthcare or a solution. Every life has purpose.
@404UserNotFond So...let's wipe out all of those who need to be fed, housed and cared for. Who needs that burden, right? Love the compassion of pro-abortion folks.

üëèNot. üëèOn. üëèOur. üëèWatch. Liberals, who identify as "Christian", defend the violent injustice of #RoevWade.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 is 54 yrs old today. We may have lost a champion, but we still have the truth. We are all created equal. And we're one human race.

@priskaneely Great thread. Missing this, though. Abortion kills black babies at rates up to 4.5x higher than white babies. Previous induced abortions are "known immutable medical risk factors" in preterm births which account for 22% of post-birth infant mortality. https://t.co/N5QQdaCCLQ
@Sol_Smilez Corrected statement: Abortion kills black babies at rates up to 4.5x higher than white babies. Previous induced abortions are "known immutable medical risk factors" in preterm births which account for 22% of post-birth infant mortality. https://t.co/N5QQdaCCLQ #UglyStatistics
No amount of justice will undo the evil and cowardice of terrorism that took 5 precious lives at the #CapitalGazette. So many want something politically easy to blame...an easy solution. Overcoming evil is never easy. Our hearts are heavy for the families of those slain.

@ErdrickStorm Ahhh, the former @PPFA-created &amp; funded @Guttmacher. Their stats are always dubious. They claimed 2008 unintended pregnancy rate was 51% (see https://t.co/EQZXeO9J1z). So, after rising from 49% to 51% from '95-2008, it miraculously dropped 54% to 45% in 3 yrs. Right. We call BS.
@ErdrickStorm Spoken like a true slavery advocate. Wonder what it feels like to pretend you can be the arbiter of human value. Every human being is a person. But since you deny basic science, you're going to deny basic language, too. Hopefully, the next confirmed #SCOTUS justice won't.
@ErdrickStorm ...as access to contraception &amp; "education" increased. That pretty much shreds your lil' theory. Less abortions happen when people make more responsible choices, especially youth. Homicide is illegal, &amp; it still happens. Domestic abuse is illegal, &amp; it still happens. Still evil. https://t.co/Q9KIWSd2sO
@ErdrickStorm Didn't use the word 'person', although every human being is a person. Racists tried that nonsense with people of my complexion during the last several centuries. They were wrong, too. You keep moving those goal posts. Unintended pregnancy rose from 1995 to 2008 (49% to 51%)...

@ErdrickStorm By "bullsh*t", of course, you mean science. Human embryology isn't going to change b/c you tweet. You are the typical pro-abortion, science-denying type aren't ya? When you want some actual and accurate science of human development, go for it here: https://t.co/E1tUQzMjRU
@emjb Did you cite your sources? Haha. Just kidding. We know you have none. But here's the link to our article that has hyperlinks to both statistics from the CDC and Guttmacher. https://t.co/99EOd5PH2D. Bad analogy. Fire extinguishers can help put out a fire. They don't prevent them.
@KaeleyT .@Essence, and many other pro-abortion media sources have been partnering with @PPFA for a long time. They're no different than @NAACP-ousted W.E.B. Du Bois who shilled for Margaret Sanger.

@ErdrickStorm 67% of abortions are committed within 8 weeks gestation. That's when the unborn child has 4,000 of an adult's 4,500 body parts.

@nycbubbles Which facts? The facts of my own life or on those nebulous ones you haven't refuted? üòè
@BlogOfTheirOwn That's about as insulting as calling someone pro-breathing. Both birth and breathing are natural biological actions. The violence of induced abortion, not so much. Yes. We're pro-birth. And pro-breathing. And pro-eating. And pro-seeing. And pro-walking...
@ErdrickStorm Guess the floating doctor's hand objectifies the medical profession, too. Or...it could be an illustrated drawing meant to focus on the action of dismemberment. Yes. Pro-abortion activists advocate abortion until birth (including partial birth abortion). So, there's that.
@BlogOfTheirOwn Funny. That's what the entire article is about. It's easier to tweet your ignorance than to take a few minutes and allow yourself to be educated. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@nycbubbles Takeaway: Pro-abortion folks can't handle having their nonsense shredded.
@emjb We've had more BC access than ever before in human history yet b/t 1995 &amp; 2008 the nat'l unintended pregnancy rate rose from 49% to 51%. Self-control by guys &amp; gals reduces abortion, not birth control. Babies are natural result of beautiful act of sex/procreation, not punishment.
@nycbubbles My sister was a refugee. Legal=lawful. Illegal=unlawful. Doesn't always denote 'moral'. My parents adopted 10 kids. I've adopted 2. Your "don't care about children" is a tired mantra. We don't support the killing of unborn humans. Yes. We're #prolife. Hope that cleared things up.
@robinmarty @frfrankpavone His response isn't the same as ours. We respect his take. Our meme &amp; tweet aren't the totality of our message which is why the URL is promoted on both. Just calling out the liberal hypocrisy &amp; attempt to redefine #prolife by those advocating harmful illegal immigration.
@robinmarty Since the response IS the article, you don't have to make up an "official line". Read it, and feel free to quote our actual lines (and no, we don't speak for the entire movement). Apparently, you missed the whole #KeepFamiliesTogether #Stop #Exploiting #Children theme.

It's a fave mantra of the pro-abortion Left, but birth control (pushed by @PPFA founder, Sanger, as a way to "prevent the birth of defectives or of those who will become defective") hasn't reduced abortion. https://t.co/OVMqEIPyl3
.@RachelHeldEvans is what happens when you give Scripture reassignment surgery &amp; then regurgitate every pro-abortion talking point about keeping the violence of abortion legal. High on feelings, low on stats &amp; context. It's always "the poor NEEEED abortion!" Sure. Got ya. #EndRoe https://t.co/lHy5zTNcmb
#ResultsHaveShown that Roe v Wade and the nation's leading abortion chain (@PPFA) have made abortion the #1 killer in the black community. If #blacklivesmatter, they need to matter IN and out of the womb. https://t.co/N5QQdaCCLQ #ThursdayThoughts https://t.co/3mJpj80ne1
Just wanna see #PlannedParenthood's business go down the drain, like the millions they've aborted over the years. The Supreme Court made up a right to kill certain humans. #SCOTUS has corrected many of its wrongs like #DredScott, #MinorVHappersett, #Plessy &amp; #Korematsu. Now #Roe. https://t.co/PTdywpsbPB
.@MSNBC's Chris Matthews, who advocated gay marriage as a solution to inner-city fatherlessness (yeah, that worked wonders), has little to offer when it comes to social remedies. Ahhhh, obstructionism. That's unique. Elections have benefits. Ending Roe v Wade will be one of them. https://t.co/GGZzfmX2iH
Roe v Wade was based on a lie. The late Norma McCorvey (Roe) was never raped, but that's the lie that got the case started. Thankfully, she became #prolife. Her baby was adopted. Norma longed for the day there would be #RoeNoMore. https://t.co/BP21x5vXho #SupremeCourt #EndRoe https://t.co/wecgU5PU8z
Fake feminism is going to be on serious roids over these next few months. Justice Kennedy's retirement (he's been on bench since 1975) is nearly 60 million lives too late. Get ready for the Roe v Wade rumble. The Patriarchy Theater has already commenced. #SupremeCourt https://t.co/caGfgnm7j1
@pixelprotectors @_morganmeadows @RoseLaoutaris @ryanbomberger We're biased. We think all humans are created equal &amp; no innocent human being should be ripped apart limb from limb. We're also incredibly accurate. Pro-abortion folks don't even WANT to look at @PPFA's own numbers. You can lead them to the links, but ya can't make 'em click 'em.
These midterm elections are now more crucial than ever! The evil injustice of abortion could finally meet a constitutionalist justice who isn't willing to sacrifice our posterity for a made-up "right". Justice Kennedy retiring from #SCOTUS is historic. #VoteProlife #TheSenate https://t.co/Eqe1vq76Kg
Wow. Wow. Just wow. Pro-Roe Justice Kennedy announces his retirement...effective July 31st! Could this be the turning point #prolife advocates have been waiting, praying and peacefully fighting for? https://t.co/vxYbATYgny
.@NAACP proves they are #civilrights gone wrong by partnering w/ #1 killer of black lives.

The Dem Party (w/ the exception of a handful of #prolife https://t.co/WdXnazYAd1) has chosen to be the Party of Abortion. @PPFA is only biz mentioned by name in their party platform where they declared they'll defend PP, no matter what.

@MonteAJP23 @LadyLecondoliak @PPFA Abortion brings in 80% of PP's "health services revenue". No one needs #PlannedParenthood. People need real care and support. Thankfully, there are thousands of free pregnancy centers and 13,000+ taxpayer-funded health centers (https://t.co/9wgB7GapbR). https://t.co/2MGdTwgyWV
@MonteAJP23 @LadyLecondoliak @PPFA First...that meme is meaningless. Most abortions happen in urban areas that are run by @Democrats. Politifact examines this rehashed meme: https://t.co/pb2K5qAgEu. You confuse PP's bogus 3% claim (shredded by @WashingtonPost here: https://t.co/LGVmEjWFGa).
.@PPFA claims killing an unborn child (aka abortion) is like having a tooth pulled.

@LadyLecondoliak Planned Parenthood claims an abortion is like having a tooth pulled. They deny the preponderance of peer-reviewed studies that induced abortion increases risk of triple-negative breast cancer, preterm births &amp; negative psychological consequences. @PPFA=#fakehealth. #Truth

#FreeSpeech baby! The Supreme Court rules that pregnancy care centers (which provide free services for mothers and their children) can't be forced by the state of California to promote the violence of abortion. #LifeWins #GiveFreeSpeechLife #ProLife #ProWoman https://t.co/cP1ksoVb48
Dear pro-abortion lawmakers/activists...It really is this simple. Free speech is #freespeech. You can't abort it. There's no America without it. Thankfully, the constitutionalists in the Supreme Court ruled the factless #FACTAct is unconstitutional. #SCOTUS #GiveFreeSpeechLife https://t.co/Io8CBFG5jU
#SCOTUS: "...the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech." In narrow 5-4 win (all 4 dissenting justices are pro-abortion), @NIFLA prevails at Supreme Court over CA's effort to silence their #prolife #prowoman #propregnancy speech. #GiveFreeSpeechLife https://t.co/Ywng57Px7a https://t.co/odPnC7hq5g
One of our most powerful acts in this constitutional Republic is to vote. The remedy is never apathy. Part of the cure to injustice, poor political policies and out-of-control government is to exercise that blood-bought right. #ElectionDay #PowerToThePeople https://t.co/7Fn4FuceZT
@gregmk12 We cringe at some of his remarks as well and have written about that. Liberalism repeatedly shows its intolerance to a different opinion. Hello, Twitter. We've experienced this in protests on campus &amp; many other events, some violent. Just pointing out hypocrisy of "inclusivity".

@bwoodruf Michelle Goldberg never spewed this hyperbole when the Obama administration engaged in the same actions. We're tired of children being exploited by any politician or "journalist". https://t.co/5MltxJMzmc
@bwoodruf Read it. Nothing like a pro-abortion fake feminist's screed about democracy when she supports judicial activism (Roe, Obergefell, FactAct,...). Problem is far-leftists want to shout or shut everybody else down. Facts be damned. That's why we have a crisis of democracy.
@motherglover1 Thank you for proving the point of the meme. So a white liberal woman is calling a black man a "racist idiot" who's illegally involved in torturing children with white nationalists, no less. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Read. Learn. Then tweet. https://t.co/5MltxJMzmc #LessActivism #MoreFactivism
@bwoodruf Which article are you referring to? Inciting altercations and intense harassment b/c of ideological differences? ‚ÄúThe people are going to turn on them, they are gonna protest, they are gonna absolutely harass them..."--Maxine Waters. Nope. Didn't read past anything.
@bwoodruf No. This is our experience on campuses, online, and at events. Liberal/progressive activists protest (sometimes violently) against anything that doesn't conform to their opinion. They succeed at shutting down vital discourse and are now encouraged to harass/intimidate even more.
@CNBC Now that's rich. @Apple, which boasted of giving one million dollars to far-left, hate-spewing @splcenter last year, is simply going to meddle in our elections like the rest of Big Tech. Gee, wonder which way they'll slant?
@plucas1000 That was no display of conservatism, but fringe racist groups that have zero ties with any mainstream conservative group. Much more akin to the antics of far-left groups like #Antifa. But nice try. https://t.co/5sWQ3nJKso https://t.co/lDbAULM7In
We have a Crisis of Democracy when libs, like Maxine Waters, respond to lost elections by doing what anarchists do best--attack &amp; divide. Funny how "inclusivity" has zero tolerance. Of all the deficits America faces, a deficit of #civility is all some politicians have to offer. https://t.co/dKdgs2GL7T
Did you know about the German-led holocaust in Southwest Africa that was the prelude to the far wider-scale NAZI Holocaust? The "scientist" who led it was part of @PPFA's founder's leadership team in her first 'World Population Conference'. https://t.co/kiW2UISplz #Eugenics https://t.co/1ZgtaTTSjr
Sadly, some liberal @vicksburgcomsch students, parents &amp; administrators showed zero interest in #civility as they slandered &amp; libeled The Radiance Foundation for delivering an approved, apolitical presentation on how every human life has purpose. https://t.co/82DzVaKqLb https://t.co/ib2B3bezEH

Majority of women become moms. In U.S. 86% of women, by 44yrs old, have given birth. @PPFA claims to be "leading women's healthcare provider" yet prenatal care--healthcare for moms--is less than 0.1% of their services. And how many maternity homes do they run? Zero. #FakeFeminism https://t.co/Uuky0TnYs9
#SCOTUS pretends to be legislative branch, redefines marriage, then acts inconsistently in identical cases.

In 2004, the @NAACP's President, the late Julian Bond, declared that the "right" to abortion was as "basic" as sitting at a lunch counter. The pro-abortion #NAACP is part of the reason more black babies are aborted than born alive in NYC. https://t.co/h0xWNTqiKF #FlashbackFriday
Predatory businesses like @PPFA depend on communities made vulnerable by fatherlessness. Nowhere is this impact more widespread than in the black community. Our newest billboard campaign w/ @AR_RTL speaks the painful truth: Abortion is lost fatherhood. https://t.co/rlK9dalbT1.

Welcome to America! Recently @MSNBC @AliVelshi got all "religious" to defend illegal immigration, invoking a verse about the "shedding of innocent blood." The Left celebrates the shedding of innocent blood--2,500 times a day--via the violence of abortion. https://t.co/MllNmL9Yvj

Funny how @PPFA claims to be for #BorderChildren. This, from an org whose founder pushed racist immigration policy. This from an org that kills millions inside the borders of the womb violently separating them, permanently, from their families. #WorldRefugeeDay https://t.co/Nb6FCdn3Yi
The Flores v Reno case is an example of judicial activists pretending to be legislators. It's mainly why (in addition to Congressional inaction) that our unequal immigration laws are a mess. Judges do have a history of enabling separate and unequal. https://t.co/5MltxJMzmc
The #prolife mov't fights to protect the unborn while caring for all 3 lives involved. If every mov't is a ship, this one's sinking. It seems to be the only one that must take on the cargo of every single issue that exists in order to validate its mission. https://t.co/5MltxK4adK
Separating children from families IS harsh (&amp; avoidable) consequence of crossing illegally. Americans who commit felonies or parent who neglects/abuses a child (hence #fostercare) risk it too. Don't hear political protests about those separations. #StopExploiting #BorderChildren
No, @secupp, you don't have to solve all the world's problems to be #prolife. A word forced to mean everything means nothing. (Don't recall you ever supporting #adoption &amp; #fostercare, btw, which are inextricably tied to #prolife advocacy). https://t.co/ap3lUg1jx2 #BorderChildren
@hera646 @beckyfs22 These are my parents. And I'm also an adoptive parent. And so are several of my siblings and their children. At the Radiance Foundation, we work with thousands of #prolife adoptive families every year. But thanks for your lame response.

@TayAnderson2019 @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 Mark 12:31 has nothing to do with homosexuality. Loving thy neighbor, however, is exactly what happened last Saturday.

@TayAnderson2019 @RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 So you aren't self-supporting? Hate is such a lazy pejorative used by those who can't argue substance.

@OuttaPancakeMix No. Not just 'paid service'. Helps to actually read the bill.

@yoydoitwit2 @coolkaza @alex5898167 @PPFA We know numbers are not a #prochoice strongpoint. Medical services started plummeting long before TX defunded corrupt #PlannedParenthood. You can see for yourself in PPFA's own annual reports. Start with 2006. Less clients. Less services. More taxpayer funding. Higher salaries.
@yoydoitwit2 @coolkaza @alex5898167 @PPFA Love when pro-abortion folks ignore stats. PP was defunded in Texas in 2011. Abortion rates dropped significantly from 13.5 to 9.8 from 2011 to 2014 in Texas (see https://t.co/VYLwjyQJU2). PP "settled" bcs they would've lost in court. Even the Obama DOJ blasted the fraud.
@LiberalElite45 @PPFA @SisterSong_WOC And yes, taxpayer dollars fund abortions in many instances through Obamacare and federally-funded state Medicaid programs like Medi-Cal...which funds over 90,000 abortions a year with taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/4YLSKnSnfW
@LiberalElite45 @PPFA @SisterSong_WOC You don't seem to be arguing the same thing. You claim taxpayer funding was drastically cut. It was drastically increased. You bring up the false argument that taxpayer dollars don't pay for abortions. That half a billion pays for their buildings &amp; their abortionists salaries.
@yoydoitwit2 @coolkaza @alex5898167 @PPFA The truth...Planned Parenthood offers far less healthcare than other taxpayer-funded providers. Keep in mind one main reason @PPFA was kicked out of program was bcs it defrauded Medicaid (filing false claims for non-existent patients/services) &amp; had to pay back $4.3 million. https://t.co/4qPC0tYpCT
@LiberalElite45 @PPFA @SisterSong_WOC Great question. Did you read the infographic? The answer's in the first paragraph. Despite serving 700,000 less clients per year from 2006-2016, Planned Parenthood's annual taxpayer funding INCREASED from $336.6 million to $543.7 million. Their focus is abortion, not healthcare.
@RWLS1 @Joseph984 Yes. White. Black. And every hue in between.

The infamous #DredScott case (March 6, 161 years ago) showed how judges can often be supremely wrong.

@saammmoooonnnnn @SiddonsDan Your logic--killing innocent life doesn't make women equal but DECIDING to kill human life does. Nope. Still no equality.

@FantaAutoma @WmTWaterman @UN @Unwomen The argument is true, especially as it applies to those celebrating sheros who've changed the world. Of course the prerequisite is being born.

@RandyRh14812712 @SiddonsDan @thebradfordfile Here's the quote in context. It was about MORE religious liberty.

@GraphiteYT @NRA @PPFA You seem to be confused about your point. A gun left on the table also requires human involvement to cause an action. So you mock the "guns don't kill people" mantra, but validate it with your clueless tweet.
@GraphiteYT @NRA @PPFA Well, you need to compare the right terms. Abortion is the act of killing a human life, of terminating a pregnancy. A gun is not the act of killing a human life. It can be used to do so. Perhaps you mean "If guns don't kill people, then forceps don't kill people."
The @NRA never killed anyone and receives ZERO tax dollars.

@prophetRonald @LiveAction @ryanbomberger @FRCdc Discussing genesis of Planned Parenthood &amp; its disproportionate targeting of the black community w/ eugenic propaganda is "blaming others"?

@SatiricusRex @LiveAction @ryanbomberger @FRCdc @PPFA You seem to be confused. We're anti-abortion. @PPFA is pro-abortion. Why wouldn't we make that comparison?

@AndreaMewhinney @LiveAction @ryanbomberger @FRCdc There have been 297 victims tragically killed in school shootings since 1980.

Killing is never the solution to life that is unplanned.
@dogland4 @LilaGraceRose @JimLovesMB What's safe about greatly increased risks of preterm births (which lead to CP, higher infant mortality)?

Even the @UN declared in 1959/1989: "the child, by reason of his physical &amp; mental immaturity, needs special safeguards, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth." Abortion is not a human right. It's a violent human wrong. #WorldChildrensDay https://t.co/iWxUDhTW48

@theori No. The replies were meant for you. You're black. I'm black. And we started out as human beings at the moment of conception. #Personhood
@theori Our slogan: Life has purpose. (In and out of the womb.) You obviously know nothing about us. https://t.co/e4uA3PIKYX

@diasporaspear That's been debunked. This black Harvard economist found NO racial difference in likelihood of being shot. https://t.co/vyP3zkBgkO
@theori By killing over 300,000 humans per year? Sure. And in other liberal logic, slavemasters provided millions of jobs for a booming economy.
