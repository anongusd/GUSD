The American people understand these facts. They know my common sense #concealedcarry reciprocity bill #HR38 is simply about enabling law-abiding citizens to exercise their right to self-defense when they cross their state‚Äôs lines.
#HR38 doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to buy a gun. It has nothing to do with the purchase of guns, it would not alter access to guns, and it would not change the federal law requiring background checks before purchasing guns.
Under federal law, it's illegal for criminals convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 yr to buy and possess a firearm. It's illegal for criminals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to buy and possess a firearm. #HR38 doesn't change that.
The facts simply don't bear out critics' claims. HR 38 will not arm criminals. In fact, there is a provision in my bill that excludes any individual who is prohibited by federal law from ‚Äúpossessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm.‚Äù https://t.co/lX18SPift1 https://t.co/PJClUJZWSH
