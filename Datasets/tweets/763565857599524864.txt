Intrepid @WTEnews state gov. reporter @RamseyWyoming said it took over an hour of discussion and a last-minute appropriation cut to get it through.
The #wyleg passed a bill to allow community colleges to offer BAS degrees in the final hour(s) of the session. That bill, SF 111, had huge support from industry folks, while UW reps spoke against it numerous times. Here’s a story I wrote on it when it was in committee. https://t.co/zWd2WJC0Vs

Linked story is from first day of trial. Story on trial’s conclusion forthcoming.
After a 4 day trial and 7-hour deliberation, the jury ruled Sanderson, the Plaintiff, was demoted bc of her gender but that the Hwy Patrol would ultimately have demoted her regardless. Awarded costs and attorney’s fees but no additional damages. Yet to make appeal decisions. https://t.co/6s1Pc2COBp
Of course, everyone should read the story in its entirety, and then read all of Rick Barrett and the @journalsentinel's prior reporting on the issue.
"Federal court data shows that western Wisconsin had the highest number of Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies in the nation in 2017."
"The amount farmers are paid for their milk varies monthly based on the USDA price, individual contracts, quality and other factors. Some farmers say they've been getting around $15 for every hundred pounds of milk they produce, roughly 12 gallons. Their costs: $20 or higher."
"By then, however, the market had turned and many dairy farmers were having trouble breaking even on their new investments."
"In 2012, Wis. Gov. Scott Walker announced an incentive program to produce, as a state, 30 billion pounds of milk a year by 2020...Dairy farmers not only met the challenge, they reached 30 billion pounds in 2016 — four years ahead of schedule."
"Wisconsin farmers are getting about $10 million in payments from Trump’s farm bailout program announced late last year...A 55-cow dairy farm would receive a one-time payment of $725...but stood to lose between $36,000 and $48,000 in income last year from low milk prices..."
Farmers take on huge debt and struggle to turn a profit: "Nearly every dollar the Spauldings have earned from their milk the last few years has gone toward their debts and farm insurance...Their milk checks, after deductions are taken out, come imprinted: 'Void.'"
"Wisconsin lost almost 700 dairy farms in 2018, an unprecedented rate of nearly two a day."

The gaps have tended toward double digits over the years, though not always. Anyway, read the story for all the figures.
Overall Wyo grad rate for 2018: 81.7% 	Free/reduced eligibile student rate: 70.2	White student rate: 83.7	Hispanic student rate: 75.4 	Black student rate: 76.8	American Indian student rate: 58.8
American Indian, Hispanic, homeless and free/reduced eligible students each had the highest grad rate in 2018 since at least 2011. Black student grad rate is up, but not an all-time high. There are still big gaps between these groups and the overall state rate.
The state grad rate is up again, but there are still some pretty significant gaps in achievement between student groups. A brief thread of relevant data: https://t.co/Hq4DrRGl2X

Really all of LOTR is just painfully bittersweet
Anyway, Sméagol’s death represents a failure of goodness- a true tragedy considering that all of LOTR is about how important it is that goodness prevails.
And ofc Sam saw Gollum the villain, while Frodo saw Sméagol the lost soul. Frodo HAD to believe in Sméagol’s ability to reclaim himself, because if Sméagol couldn’t do that, then maybe that meant he (Frodo) wouldn’t be able to either. Frodo understood the battle within Sméagol.
Sméagol is really the most sympathetic character in LOTR. And I DO NOT subscribe to the theory that Sméagol was a sociopath/psychopath pre finding the ring. Maybe he had a weak constitution, but the ring corrupted Isildur in like 5 seconds too.
Okay, as an addendum, yes, Sméagol was easily corrupted because he wasn’t, like, a wonderful guy before finding the ring. But I think it’s safe to say by the time he met Frodo, who genuinely believed in Sméagol’s potential for redemption, he WANTED to be better, to be saved.
Honestly only true LOTR fans understand that Gollum’s death is actually tragic and not a victory because Sméagol was truly pure/only wanted love, but was obv. Just corrupted, understandably, by The Ring, but Gollum’s greed was stronger than Sméagol’s purity. TRAGIC.

@jabrilfaraj And I think that not addressing the shoddy reporting makes it seem that we are willing to accept a lesser standard of work when it makes Trump look bad, where we wouldn't accept it otherwise.
@jabrilfaraj You're right. And I'm not saying to disregard the entire story (Though, like you said, we already knew a lot of this). But I think the book should be thoroughly fact checked, and his credibility be questioned.
@jabrilfaraj If his aim is some gonzo-style entertainment journalism, then maybe not(though I still think yes), but if he's arguing that his account of things is unequivocally correct, then little details should effect his credibility. The same way they would for an NYT or WSJ reporter.
@jabrilfaraj I think that if someone calls themselves a journalist, calls their work journalism, they should care about the details. I don't doubt that much of the book is accurate, but I don't think it should be held to a lower standard of reporting just because of the subject matter.
@jabrilfaraj Responses from reputable journalists, like those reported in this and similar articles, make me skeptical of the accuracy of Wolff's account. https://t.co/WecMbu54XO
@rharrington63 I know it's shoddily reported. I wouldn't be reading it thinking it's accurate. But I still want to read it bc of the attention it's received. To be "in the know" lmao
