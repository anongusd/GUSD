@MichaelMAGAUSN he wouldn't
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump that was when Louisiana was having deadly flooding.  Trump and Pence we not in the white house yet and went to Louisiana to donate a supply truck (a semi).  Hillary was also campaining, but at this particular time stayed home nad painted her finger nails.

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump It is very horrible and racist when I seen an interview of where she basically said "All black people look alike".  She said Eric Holder and Cory Booker look alike.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump what laws is Trump breaking?  There are no laws prohibiting the pissing off of democrats
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Even though I did not and would not vote for Bernie, the thing Debbie and Hillary did to make him lose is very messed up.

@DAUM4Congress I seen a 20/20 special of where they interviewed a secret service agent that worked for both hillary and mrs. Bush.  The agent complained for 10 minutes anout Hillary and gave praises for five minutes on how selfless Mrs. Bush was
@DAUM4Congress fact #11 --Melania is fluent in French and can speak well with African children	fact #12 --Melania make for a better first lady than Bill Clinton (of which there was physical forensic science evidence proving him a liar)
@DAUM4Congress fact #9- he has negotiated with Vietnam to buy billions of dollars in air crafts	fact #10 - Melania is prettier than Bill
@DAUM4Congress fact #7 - he helped in the release of Otto	fact #8- he convinced the president of China to released the UCLA basketball students that went to China and shoplifted (which is a VERY serious crime their, but not here)
@DAUM4Congress fact #4- Trump banned bump stocks, earler presidents have done nothing	fact #5 -Trump had a black female CEO eorking for him, but now she works for Ben Carson	fact #6- he was invited by the prsident of China to eat in the "Forbidden City" --no other president has
@DAUM4Congress fact #3.  Trump is first in charge, Pence is second, and Nancy Pelosi is third
@DAUM4Congress not gullible when I look at the facts:	fact #1- Trump won more state and counties than Hillary.	fact #2- Trump confessed to us that he did do locker room talk, said he was not proud he did it, and appologized to teh American people.	....

@DAUM4Congress if California seceded from the union Trump would win popular vote too ...can you rebut that?  show some stats
@RyanAFournier we live in a democracy, not a monarchy.  Trump at one time used to be a democrat.  A raped woman can use emergency plan B birth control and not abort a baby or adopt it out.
@DAUM4Congress so that means hillary when she said "I didn't know what (c) meant".  She fails the security test and is a LIAR
@BreitbartNews encourage California to secede and you can be their queen

@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 Trump is actually more "all ears" about gun control.  No abolishing 2A.  Trump has been the only president to ban bump stocks
@Inverness011 @NevadaJack2 yes, there should be some regulations... but I do not side with the far left when they say abolish 2A.  Moderate dems say leave 2A alone, far lefties say abolish 2A.  i agree more with the moderates
@Inverness011 @NevadaJack2 It is not an American issue
@Inverness011 @NevadaJack2 the recnt Florisa High School shooter went to McDonalds to order a meal after killing 19 people.  The Aurora Movie theater shooter called his psych very shrtly before rampaging.  This type of thing has happened in Norway, with unfortunately more deaths.
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 focus on if California seceded from the union, Trump would have won popular vote too
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 rebut the notion that Beto lost to Cruz and there was no electoral college.  FOCUS on that

@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 if Russia could hack things up, don't you think they would have hacked things up so Nancy Pelosi would not come speaker of the house?  she is third in line to be president.
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 no whenHRC said "at this point in time, what difference does it make"?  Do you think she would have asked that if it was her beloved Chelsea that was massacred in Benghazi.  Russia had nothing to do with election interfering.  Debbie did

@NevadaJack2 we do need funds to go towards mental health.  The Aurora Movie Shooter of Colorado, shortly before he went on his rampage, telephoned his psychiatrist, the psychiatrist was too busy helping other clients before James went on his rampage ...
@KamalaHarris dental too ... why dies it cost $1400 in Mexico to get a full mouth denture impant, and here in the U.S. it costs $14,000.  They do that with medical things too
@KamalaHarris lower medical charges
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump is California seceded from the union, Trump would win popular vote too
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 If California seceded from the union, Trump would win popular vote too
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 There are Primaries.  The 5 territories we have are allowed to vote in our Primaries and not the general election.  Beto was in a senate race against Cruz.  Beto lost and there was no electoral college
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter (every democratic president in the past) won because of the EC
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 I mean is all 4 voted for Trump and just California voted for Hillary,  Hillary would win
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 if any party should be complaining about the EC it is the republicans.  California is a solid blue state.  They get 55 ec votes.  more than the four corner states and Montana, combined.  If all 4 corner states and Montanta voted for Hillary ...

@NevadaJack2 she lives in her own world
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump I don't want California and New York be the ones to select my president
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump if every state and every territory had the exact same poulation, i would agree the electoral college needs to be abolished and Trump impeached.  Populations in the states are not the same.  In Senate races, where Beto lost to Cruz,  there is no electoral college
@BernieSanders classes would be overcrowded and the teachers will not have time to grade papers.  We are not robots
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Trump would never be impeached
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump not even going to come down to that... if for some rare event that happened wthout any crimes committed, other than pissing the dems off, Pence would pardon him.  Trump would not be eldgible to be reassigned as president, but Pence could pardon him.   Nixon did not go to jail
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Trump won more counties and states than did Hillary just like Obama won more states and counties than did McCain or Romney.  That's how you win a presidency-- California and  New York do have a say in it,  but it is not ALL  up to them
@Education4Libs shit, can you imagine watching pair ice skaters.  A trans wearing a dress and being thrown into the air.

@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 the elrctoral college was created to protect democrats too.
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 Betp lost to Trd Cruz, probably bacause he said he wants to impeach Trump, and in Texas senate races there is no electoral college.
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS44 if there was the same amount and exact population in every state (50) and territory (5).  I would defintely supprt abolishing the electoral college and would definately say Trump cheated, it is not.

@Education4Libs remember, Operah believes in guilty until proven innocent and even if you are prooven innocent, you are still guilty.
@SpeakerPelosi i am thinking Trump will work with you somewhat on gun control.  he will not, nor should he, work on abolishing 2A.  Trump has already banned bump stocks and Obama has done nothing.  Trump used to be a democrat and has some, suprisingly, still left in him.
@RedRideCA @KamalaHarris it does not snow much in California or Hawaii.  You have to go atop of the telepscope observatiry on Maui to see snow and i heard there is a place you can snow ski on the big island.  it only snows in northern California

does anyone have any information or an idea of what i can do so I do not have to pay the credit card company an annual fee, a monthly fee, and interest charge fee (there might be some kind of fee I forgot to mention).

it seems like I used $1500 from the credit card, but by the time I have made payments to all the monthly charges, yearly charges, and interest rate ... i will end up paying $6,000
does anyone know of a program where I have only 1500 in debt and would like to pay it off in one lump sum because on the credit card i use there is a monthly fee, a yearly fee, and interest charges.

@BreitbartNews he has a black female CEO working for him, he has Ben Carson defending him, he has David Clark defending hin, at one time Jesee Jackson awarded Trump, Trump's ex said she wanted to divorce Trump for many reasons, she said "but Trump is far from being racist"

@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump and trying to keep women out
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump If the Honduran caravan was fleeing from the opression Honduras gives to them, why does the front of the line carry the national Honduras flag?
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump they have a security wall to protect their ugly asses
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump you right their dude, we will need to hire security guards to stop people from using ladders.  The unemployment rate will decrease even more
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump Let's ask Pope Francis if it is alright for Chelsea and Hillary not to just visit the Vatican, but to move their
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump what about the wall that is around the Clinton's house, Obama's house, and Nancy Pelosi's house?  The Vatican has one for the Pope too.
@alfolart @marcorubio @jguaido @unidadvenezuela i just know that some nations do not require you to be born in the country you want to be the president, like North Korea.   Kim Il Sung was born in Russia.
@NevadaJack2 people need rags
@marcorubio Do you have to be born in Venezuela to be their president?  You should run.
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren they should deport them and their entire family to desolate parts of Canada so they can redevelope desolate parts of Canada -where only the moose live

@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren a wall is more of a psycological barrier.  We know people wil bypass it with a ladder, but not everyone will be able to.  You can contain a mighty elephant with just a mere rope
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren metal in conductive .. you electrify a panel in the west coast, by the speed of light, a panel in the east coast is electrfied
@drobpix @KamalaHarris i would rather live in a barn than in a place where a rapist or killer was chasing me
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren not enough amps to kill, just enough to shock ... farmers used to do it to keep cattle from escaping.  Does not cost much
@marcorubio @Ivanr_HD shit dude, you screwed up my plans
@drobpix @KamalaHarris they will be reunited with their family, in desolate parts of Canada
@spartacus90210 @Powaycalgal doubt it, it gives the dems something to complain about
@drobpix @KamalaHarris what is wrong or unfair about sending assylum seeker to desolate parts of Canada where killer or rapers that might be chasing them now, will not follow them to desolate parts of Canada and they can develope the desolate part of Canada
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Go Fund Me is always an option
@Breaking911 they ought to kill his character, i have seen people from both sides of the aisle disappointed
@Fuctupmind when was this picture taken?  i think many of the dems are pissed off at Smolette as well.  Smolette is giving them a very terrible name.  But then there are some pure butt holes like Maxine Waters (who probably funded Smolette to do it)
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren that is why we ought to electrify the wall
@drobpix @KamalaHarris if Trump was all alone and we lived in a monarchy, (we live in a democracy) yet if we lived in a monarchy, Trump would be on my shit list too.  That and he has many supporters that I like and know how to keep him held accountable
@drobpix @KamalaHarris the last rare instance, the repubs were in for more than two terms.  Bush junior only served one term.  McCain was told he was another term for Bush junior.  Hillary was a third term for Obama
@drobpix @KamalaHarris not always, but most of the time ...presidencies are cyclable.  Every two terms that a president serves, the president the next time is of the opposing party.  Obama and the dems served two terms, it was time for the repubs to take over.  Not always, but most of the timw
@drobpix @KamalaHarris Trump used to be a democrat.  Trump does listen to what ohers say, so instead of just bashing him --decently rebutt
@Powaycalgal @ScottPresler @EmpireFOX it's not just meant to be a meme.  Think about it seriously.
@marcorubio i think you ought to let only the ambassedors worry about Venezuela (not a senator's job)
@DAUM4Congress @POTUS @SteveSchmidtSES @TheDemocrats nope, Debbie should not had done what she did.  That was one of the reasons Hillary lost.  The biggest reason is that nobody wanted to give Obama or the democratic party a virtual (not actual) but virtual third term.
@Powaycalgal @ScottPresler @EmpireFOX https://t.co/mx5mKtNT3V
@drobpix @KamalaHarris that is on topic, send assylum seekers to desolate parts of Canada and Trump will not be able to kidnap them and put them into cages, following the practice Obama started
@DAUM4Congress @SteveSchmidtSES @TomPerez @TomSteyer @billmaher https://t.co/vIUBeUgRvP
@DAUM4Congress @GOP i don't recall Trump saying that he inteded to tax anyone.  Trump at one time was a democrat, but i don't think he is thrilled about taxing anyone, like the democrats are
@ChuckCallesto https://t.co/TlxVb6g3Vi
@Breaking911 Trump could pardon him and the left would still push for the impeachment of Trump
@GeraldoRivera you too
@maxdunn send the assylum seekers to desolate parts of Canada, where the killers will not follow the assylum seekers
@drobpix @KamalaHarris killers posing a threat to assylum seekers will not follow the assylum seekers to desolate parts of Canada
@drobpix @KamalaHarris every assylum seeker ages 1 month - 120 should be sent to desolate parts of Canada to develope it and make it not desolate anymore
@w_terrence glad that nothing worse happened to you
@realDonaldTrump don't forget to hire guards to stop the people with ladders
@w_terrence are you okay now?
@KamalaHarris Russia can not hack computerized elections, unless they are held online
@Fuctupmind @AOL Hillary had no claim.  Obama was the first U.S. woman president.
@Fuctupmind no
@Education4Libs it was supposed to be a nation wide thing, yet it failed in California alone
@Education4Libs that bullet train idea was dead the day after obama mentioned it

@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris i hope that Dornish woman does survive and kills Cersie
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris yes, if he didn't let PRIDE get to him, he would have killed the mountain.  he just needed to leave that spear in the mountain a couple more minutes
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris there are some things in Game of Thrones that are against what my beleifs are, but I just ignore those things.  For example, the incest that goes on.  I ignore it
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris I think John and Danny should have flown the two dragons to winterfell.  But in the last episode of season 7, John and Danny opted to sail
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris they showed a trailor of season 8.  John Snow, Arya, and Sansa are down in the crypt.  A rush of fog comes in, that usually means the white walkers are attacking
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris i think it is going to be the Dornish lady or Arya Stark wearing Peter Baelish'es face that kills Cersie.  The Dornish woman is resposible for one of Cersie's child's death, but Cersie and Euron Greyjoy is responsible for three of the Dornish woman's children's deaths
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump are they all blue states and soar that Hillary lost and Obama was denied a third virtual term, just like how Bush was denied a third virtual term via McCain?
@6foot5tom @JennaBushHager @kathyireland watch the whole 5 minute clip and "wait for it".     https://t.co/wz89QFgavk
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris i am a firm believer that music captures attention.  that is why i think Game Of Thrones is so popular without even thinking it's the music.   Their intro song and background music in various scenes is epic
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris they just need to kill hte night king and all the white walkers instantsly die when the night king dies
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris i think Cersie should fashion a harpoon made of dragon glass and have Bron shoot the ice dragon, using that harpoon shooter he shot Danny's favorite dragon with, they can soot ice giants with dragon glass harpoons as well.
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris John Snow hanged that guy that stabbed him
@CptLibertarian @KamalaHarris capital punishment, where they give people a lethal injection is a louzy deterrent, but hangings (not lynchings) --but hangings are a deterrent
@KamalaHarris we need tp reinstate hanging as a deterent.  One must undoubtedy be guilty of multiple deaths.   A person that shoots one or two other people shall not be hanged.  People like Nicholas Cruz need to be hanged
@AmericanVoterUS @realDonaldTrump someone from Texas told me that the greatest way to show love to a woman is by kissing her hand
@WayneDupreeShow i think he should move to Cuba
@funder @cookiebandit44 Not
@RepMaxineWaters @cookiebandit44 you said "If you see anyone from that administration, you push back and tell them that they are not welcome".  Even Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer call you out on that one.
@RepMaxineWaters @cookiebandit44 Grow up, little violent girl
@Jackie71126643 @GmanFan45 They should have made people that voted for Hillary go to work at the post office today, since Trump is not their president.
Trump really-really needs to do this https://t.co/YeKeayhxNB
remember the three eyed Raven told Bran that he will never walk again, but he will fly ... maybe if Danny brings her two dragons to Winterfell, Bran will be able to fly on one --then again maybe not

@cranky_yankee McCain lost back in 2008 because people did not want Bush junior to have  an additional term via McCain
@cranky_yankee AND, not all of the time, but most of the time.  Presidencies are "cyclable".  Most of the time, every eight years the party of the president take turns.  Not always, but most of the time
@cranky_yankee we live in a democracy and not a monarchy.  Trump is not king, he does not always show it, but he knows it
@cranky_yankee If Trump was all alone and did not have supporters like Ben Carson, Mia Love, Condoleeza Rice, David Clark, Melania Trump, Barron Trump, Ivanka Trump and many others Trump would be on my shit list too.

@Devinwitte @AP yes, the baby boomers do listen to generation X now, because they know that we grew up.  Now it is the millennials turn to "grow up".
@Devinwitte @AP i am from generation X.  When people from generation X were your age, we were told we were outspoken and should shut up until we grow up by baby boomers.  Today do you think baby boomers listen to generation X?
@davidsiders @NYCNavid @politico If Beto could not beat Ted Cruz, how does he think he will beat Trump
@ScrewedHumans @JanetB95072538 Bush Junior was put under the same amount, if not more.  Social Media was not a part of daily life though
@Devinwitte @AP your timeline indicates that you are a millennial, grow up first

@Devinwitte @AP The world's finest nuts come from California.  Both kinds!
@Devinwitte @AP when Marijuana was illegal in California and legal in Colorado, many Californians moved to Colorado.  Now that it is legal in California, hopefully they will move back and rental prices will be normal again.
@Devinwitte @AP so according to your data, the other 49 states and 5 territoies comprise 17 trillion dollars into the 19.4 trillion GDP?  We would definitely survive and probably thrive if California seceded

@CBSNews the same doctor that evaluated Obama
@TomiLahren all of them
@KamalaHarris the over killing on the prices of dental implants is pretty serious
@BrodyLogan @9NEWS ?
@gatewaypundit that bullet train idea was dead the day after Obama told us about it
@NevadaJack2 that high speed train idea was dead the day after Obama told us about it
@KamalaHarris ABSOLUTELY!!!  Lynchings must be eliminated!!!  Hangings need to be reinstated for people like Nicholaus Cruz
@1776Stonewall we should take Ted Cruz' idea to the bank
@DiamondandSilk @POTUS @realDonaldTrump AND then let GoFundMe and El Chapo pay the rest
@KamalaHarris it should not cost into the thousands of dollars to repair a broken pinkey and 500 dollars just to walk into the ER
@KamalaHarris You are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.  Women that lie deserve to go to jail though, like Mrs. Ford.
@CStamper_ The reason Beto lost in Texas is because he has said that he wants and will work diligently to impeach Trump.  There is and was no "electoral college" when Beto lost
@realDonaldTrump That electric train idea was stupid.  How would it bring benefit to the people that do not live close to rail lines (like the Hawaiians and other mainland states).  When a passanger gets to their destination, they must rent a car to get around (not worth it).
@NevadaJack2 Illegal things and illegal crossings, DO NOT HAPPEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT
@NevadaJack2 Jim Acosta showed us a video at the of him walking at the  U.S./Mexico boarder and how nothing is going on and how we should not worry because everything is tranquil.  The most obvious and foolish error of his video is, when he filmed it, it was BROAD DAYLIGHT.
@charliekirk11 is El Chapo in U.S. custody?
@charliekirk11 is El Chapo in U.S. custodya
@RealDrGina @NevadaJack2 Only my ultimate boss knows.  My boss is the boss of Trump too
@charliekirk11 @NevadaJack2 High Speed Trains is dead and has been dead the day after Obama mentioned it.  They were going to use the existing rail ways.  The existing rail ways do not go through every state and impossible for Hawaii.  How would had, high speed trains boost the USA?
@NevadaJack2 It happened to Beto in Texas because he said he wants to impeach Trump and in Senate races there are no electoral colleges
@fixurheart2016 global warming
@mikebwonder Michelle .... she is missing those free expensive vacations
@MichaelSkolnik @nuckingfutz33 Beto's senate loss is most likely because he has said that he wants to impeach Trump
@MichaelSkolnik @nuckingfutz33 why didn't Beto win the senate race?  You can't blame the electoral college on that loss
@1776Stonewall they are only "black face" shoes because she pointed it out.  She is the racist one
@Reallypatti If that was the case, Beto would have won the senate seat.  Beto did not, and you can't blame the electoral college on that loss.
@kylegriffin1 last year, but i don't think so this year
@kylegriffin1 are you Kathy's biological brother?
@Acosta do you think illegal activity happens in broad daylight?   I seen your video at the border, it was broad daylight!  Nothing will happen in broad daylight!
@DAUM4Congress tell me what would happen if the elections were only held in 5 states?  The four corner states and California.  Let'd pretend all 4 ,four corner states voted for Trump and just California voted for Hillary.  That is technically 4 to 1, but according to the e.c.  Hillary wins
@MatthewJshow @NBCNews @KenDilanianNBC we all knew
@1776Stonewall @DonaldJTrumpJr increasing the price of meat will only encourage more people to go hunting

@KamalaHarris we needed them when Bill Clinton and Obama were in office
@KamalaHarris that is the one and only thing that I agree with you on
@TimRunsHisMouth was the crowd calpping for ten minutes and Beto saying over and over "Thank You, Thank You, your so kind for the first ten minutes?  That is how all democrat rebuttals start out.  VERY aggrevating!!

@Acosta you showed us a video of the activities at the US/Mexico boarder.  You are correct!  You showed us nothing happening.  The problem, you DUNCE!!!  You showed us a video that was taken in broad daylight.  Do you think illegal actvity takes place in broad daylight?

@DAUM4Congress @GOP @TomPerez If Putin was a ruthless dictator, he never would have allowed Medlev to be president in between the years that Putin has been president

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump like I said, if you asked me about Donald Trump ALONE, Trump would most certainly be on the shit list --but he is not alone
@brycetache @cookiebandit44 you just will never get over the FACT that Hillary lost and Obama was denied a third virtual term
@treasonstickers @cookiebandit44 Lynne Patton is a black female CEO that says Trump is an honor to call friend
@SteffaniElsey nice thinking
@treasonstickers @cookiebandit44 the out stretching of wreaths was a commemoration ceremony for many of the veterans at a cemetary, they placed wreaths on veteran graves
@treasonstickers @cookiebandit44 nope, why is it that when Trump invited that young boy who placed the flags on all those veterans' graves, everyone stood up and gave a standing ovation except for Nancy Pelosi and her supporters?  (they did not even clap) and Trump participated in the out stretching of wreaths

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Melania can speak fluent french.  She can and has done wonderful things with the African children, that can only communicate to us in Frech.  Bill Clionton does not know how to do that
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump If Trump did not have Malani as a wife and Barron as a son, Trump would be on my shit list.  If Trump did not have Ben Carson on his side, Trump would be on my shit list.  If Trump did not have many of the people that support him, he would be on my shit list.  Trump is not alone
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump it is not Trump alone that I support
@nuckingfutz33 what we will  do is build a wall and bring higher employment by hiring guards that make sure nobody tries to use a ladder and bypass the wall

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump the government has been shut down during Christmas before.  It is called a vacation for them
@Fuctupmind Hey Kathy, why is it that when Trump invited and publically recognized on television the boy that placed flags on all those veteran headstones, and everybody stood and gave a standing ovation, except the people sitting with Nancy Pelosi (who remained seated and did not even clap)
@Chris_78704 @AppleSupport Let's be real!  They are not going to do that.
@Education4Libs there is also a section of it that will prevent Mexican and American toddlers from drowning in the Rio Grande River.

@Ram_Seaside @brandxit Great Britain, at no charge to their diplomats, sent in battleships for theirs.
@Ram_Seaside @brandxit it is evident to me that when Gadaffi was still alive and went on a rampage,  our diplomats needed to be eacuated.  Hillary sent fairy boats and made the diplomats sign agreements that they, the diplomats are responsible to pay for the fairy boats.
@stucam7771 @brandxit we all knew and understand why he did it (ie hillary).  We just were not happy that he said he did not
@stucam7771 @brandxit Clinton did go through impeachment proceedings, but was NEVER removed from office.  Nobody cared that he got a bj from Monica.  We care that he starred everyone in the eye on world wide television and said he did not.
@chuckwoolery he is CORRECT!  that is why that Guatemalan 7 year old girl died.  She died from thirst and starvation because her parent bought her acrossed the Mexican desert without ample food and water.  ICE was then blamed.
@K_JeanPierre @cookiebandit44 If Russia could hack our elections so the dems would lose, why is the next speaker of the house, third in line to be president, the democrat queen Nancy Pelosi?
@joncoopertweets @cookiebandit44 very highly doubt it
@chuckwoolery at this point in time, what difference does it make?
@HuguesWallitte @nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Learn to lose like the GOP did in 2008.  Nobody or no political afilliation wins 100 percent of the time
@HuguesWallitte @nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Nancy, on Jan 1st will be third in charge after Mike Pence.  The dems will do everything possible to take both Trump and Pence out.   They do no know how to take turns.  Putin or Russia, if they could hack elections, would not let that happen.
@marishan0611 @nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Hillary was a "virtual" third term for Obama, just like McCain was a "virtual" thrid term for Bush
@marishan0611 @nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump not always, but most of the time, the president is either democrat or republican and is in office as president for 8 years and then the opposing political party takes over.  Not always, but frequently.  The last time a rare occurance happened, the GOP was in for more than 8 years
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Trump is not the saviour, neither is Obama
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump if the Russians or Putin could hack our elections, they would not have let Nancy Pelosi win speaker of the house a month ago

@G64Joann @JoshDoss24 @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren that and the fact that what Debbie Schultz did to ensure Hillary would defeat Bernie (even though Bernie is not on my list to vote for) ..the thing Debbie and Hillary did to Bernie was screwed up

@JoshDoss24 @G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren not all the time, but most of the time .... the president is either democrat or republican for 8 years (two tems) then they switch, like I said not always.  Obama had just finished two terms and was denied a third "VIRTUAL" (not actual) but was denied a third virtual term
@JoshDoss24 @G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren Melania does have an accent, but it is very foolish to say she speaks English as well as Bill speaks French
@JoshDoss24 @G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren Melania speaks fluent English, otherwise Barron would be SCREWED

@G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren Trump alone is not why i voted for Trump.  I also voted, just to name a few, for Melania, Trump's family, Ben Carson (who safely and successfull seperated siamese twins joined together at the head).  For crying out loud, i remember Trump was a millionaire and then claimed bkrtcy
@G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren not always,  but most of the time, the two major political parties take 8 year turns as president
@G64Joann @nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren saying "there are good people on both sides" is not callous.  There are good republicans and there are good democrats ... Hillary is not one of them.  Especially after saying Eric Holder, Corrie Booker, and all black people look alike

@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren i heard that from her own lips .... Russia had nothing to do with Hillary's loss ..Twitter and the fact she asked "at this point in time, what difference does it make"? and the fact that it was the repuiblicans turn as president.  that is why she lost
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren i also am very repulsed that she said Corie Booker, Eric Holder, and all black people look alike.  That is what she said.
@nuckingfutz33 @TomiLahren no, i spend a lot of time thinking how hillary had the tenacity to say "at this point, what difference does it make"?  if it was Chelsea slaughtered in Benghazi, it should have made a difference, but with hillary, i don't know

@goatapp sorry, but i do not buy anything from anything named GOAT
@DeplorableChoir @bn81159 it is dangerous for your kids too.  they are not getting any attention from the person watching them.
@DeplorableChoir @bn81159 there is your answer.  Phones you can text on.  Tell the baby sitter she must not bring her phone and can only use your phone if there is a medical emergency.  or else she does not get hired
@KAG4All i seriously think desert heat messes people up.  Arizona is a desert.  Look at John McCain. Look at Jeff Flake.   Look at the peoples of southern California.  Look at the Arabs and the Middle East..
@NBCNews @cookiebandit44 @NBCNewsTHINK Trump has not erased any tapes of evidence, Nixon did.  Trump did not have the IRS illegally target certain peoples of the opposing ploitical afilliation, Nixon and Obama did, but Obama got away with it
@EricTrump @TrumpStore cool
@TWPundit @alfolart none of them .... they are ALL full of shit
@OliverMcGee @RyanAFournier @BillClinton @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS so is Mia Love, Condoleeza Rice, Ben Carson (who safely abd successfully sperated siamese twins joined together at the head), David Clark Junior, the list goes on an on
@RealJamesWoods @augustyn_jamie that is because the liberals took the word "boy", from boy scouts
@w_terrence do they realize, what goes up, must come down?  that is selfish shooting bullets into the sky
@ChuckCallesto does she know that she is not queen?  i have even read an article for, i think it was CNN, i know it was some media outlet and it was definitely not BIASED Fox, there are 16 democrat women that will oppose Nancy when she becomes speaker.
@TimRunsHisMouth to show humility
@RealJamesWoods she's going to apply to work for "The View"?
@ChuckCallesto i don't think the Californians know that they are not the only people in the world

@KamalaHarris Even Schumer and Pelosi brke down yesterday and said YES our borders need secured.  Are you going to secure them by banning straws?
@chuckwoolery I would pay, in MONOPOLY money

@Education4Libs at the very moment i would hand them 50 thousand dollars .... in MONOPOLY monet

@parrthetic @ryan_a_bell @realDonaldTrump I agree, California should secede.

@nuckingfutz33 far left democrats want to and we do need to match or even surpass what the bad guys have.  Do you like team word chums?
@DianaHinzman @GayRepublicSwag the Hondurans are accustomed to tropical weather, year round.  In the USA it is tropical year round only in Hawaii, Florida, southern California, southern Arizona and southern Texas
@ryan_a_bell @realDonaldTrump if we sold California to Mexico, we woud win and so would they.  We would have funds to build a wall and they would have disneyland and we call also sell them disney movie making rights
@realDonaldTrump Wrong!, when Obama and the dems gave Iran that money, they hate us and Israel even more.
@tedcruz i don't know how publicised this info is.  But right after the dems won the house.  Many democratic women (26 if I remember right), yes-democratic women, have vowed not to confirm Nancy as speaker.
@mmpadellan @cookiebandit44 @NancyPelosi since she is the next speaker of the house on January first, it should be evident that Russia can not "hack" elections, otherwise Nancy would have lost

@WayneDupreeShow do they slap each other?
@nuckingfutz33 it does not matter how many bullets go into a clip, the shooter goes --thunk, thunk and the gun is reloaded.  The "thunk-thunk" is not enough time to "rush" the shooter.
@nuckingfutz33 there are far lefties, that want all guns banned --even they want the lazor guns from Star Wars banned
@nuckingfutz33 if we could invent a gun that instantly (the key word, instantly) cause the target to sleep, that would be great.  It may sound far fetched, but the 3D printer sounded far fetched 30 years ago and it takes only 15 seconds for the venom of a black mamba snake to kill someone
@nuckingfutz33 the problem is, if you do not have the same power of gun the bad guy has, or a more powerful gun --you will lose and so will others that you do not want to lose
@nuckingfutz33 the hero that shot the Texas Church shooter was a certified NRA instructor armed with an AR-15.  If you ban guns, it sounds like a good idea, but remember we tries to ban drugs.  It encouraged people to get them.
@Education4Libs very cool
@politvidchannel @lostint07245298 those suggestions and rules sucked big time anyways
@DogginTrump @cookiebandit44 It was not Russian collusion, it was when Hillary asked "At this point, what difference does it make?"

@UmiSmith1 @RubieSweet @w_terrence I accepted it when McCain was told that he was a third term for Bush, you need to accept it that Hillary was a third term for Obama.  Did the Denver Broncos win the super bowl last year and the year before that.  NO they did not.  That is LIFE.  Suck it up

@realDonaldTrFan @cookiebandit44 there is no blue check mark next to the picture of Trump
@UmiSmith1 @RubieSweet @w_terrence It is rare though.  McCain was a third virtual term for Bush junior and the GOP.  Hillary was a thrid virtual term for Obama and the democrat party.
@UmiSmith1 @RubieSweet @w_terrence NOT ALWAYS, but most of the time.  Any of the two MAJOR political parties, is not in the White House more tham 8 years.  A few times in history a certain poiltical party had held presidency more than 8 years and a couple times the president was neither republican or democrat.

@UmiSmith1 @w_terrence Hillary lost in 2008 and 2016
@UmiSmith1 @RubieSweet @w_terrence It is racist to say Eric Holder, Corey Booker, and all black people lok alike.  Queen Hillary said that, not anyone from the GOP.
@UmiSmith1 @w_terrence John McCain lost in 2008, and the GOP was told that John McCain would be a virtual (not actual, but virtual) third term for Bush junior.  Hillary was a virtual third term for Obama and probably would have won presedency if Obama would not have endorsed her.

@ChuckCallesto did she promise?
@cookiebandit44 she is a outspoken millennial.  Generation X said outspoken thins and were shunned by the baby boomers.  Now it is Generation X's turn to shun the millennials  https://t.co/F0Afz9mAhp
@WildIsTheAsh A CNN reporter asked hillary, "what do you think when Coorie Booker said to kick republicans in the knee".  Hillary said, it was Eric Holder [Eric Holder and Coorie Booker are both black] qupte-unquote she said, they all look alike.  She is the racist one
@WildIsTheAsh Not all the time, but most of the time ... presidencies are cylable.  NOT ALWAYS ....but this time it was.  It was in 2008, when Obama won.  McCain was told that he would be a virtual third term for Bush.  HENCE  Hillary was a virtual third term for Obama

@lisastark351 @cookiebandit44 Hillary lost in 2016 and when she said "they all look alike" when talking about Cory Booker and Eric Holder, she proved to be the racist one

@DogginTrump @cookiebandit44 Hillary and the democratic party lost in 2016 and Obama was denied a this term.  In 2008, the republican party lost and Bush and the republican party was denied a third term.  Not always, but most the time --the parties take turns

@dbongino @JanetB95072538 tear gas does way less damage than rocks
@SarahPalinUSA it is because she is not being threatened.  Who in that caravan will replace her job (which requires you to be beautiful and speak perfect English).  Other people could and would be replaced becuase they would do the same jobs at a lower wage
@ChuckCallesto if mustard gas was used it would be terrorism.  Tear gas was used.  If we used water canons, she still says it would had been terror
@kgrandia do the people behind that woman look like nursing females?
@kgrandia look at all those people behinde that woman, do they look like niusing females ?
@kgrandia i have seen pictures of bloodiy attacked Mexican police officers too.  5 percent of that caravan are women and children that need escorted to sinny california.  The 95 percent millennial male punks need to be escorted to the ski slopes and told to clear the roads
@WendyFry_ @cookiebandit44 the 5% of the caravan needs to be escorted to warm, safe, California.  The 95 percent of millennial male punks need to be escorted to clear the roads at the ski slopes.
@Skeletor80 @cookiebandit44 what gives them the right to throw rocks at agents?  Tear gas is less lehtal than having rocks thrown at you
@davidmweissman @cookiebandit44 the majority of the caracan are milleniual male punks.  we out to extract the women and chilrdren under the age o 12 and escort them to California.  Escort the millennial male punks to the ski slopes
@HillaryClinton @cookiebandit44 shut up you racist
@stucam7771 @cookiebandit44 there is no argument.  I have seen media (and it was not fox news or CNN) but news outlets that showed live videos of the caravan and YES there were nursing women (only about 5%), the other 95% of the caravan were millennial male thugs.
@chuckwoolery then water canons and then the left will still bitch
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump send the little girl, her sister and her mother to sunny California.  Send the other 95 percent of the caravan to the ski slopes to clear the roads and see how warm they can be in their measily tents
@GeraldoRivera @TheFive Mexico offered them sanctuary.  The Hondurans declined.  Mexico is the 14th richest nation in the world

@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews use water canons
@Jali_Cat @JanetB95072538 @PSYCH_HYPE 95% of the caravan look like millennial male punks.  It is biologically impossible for a male human to have babies.  They are not seahorses.  Send the 5% females to summy california.  The males can go here https://t.co/c5wry39RQ8

@csdowner @cookiebandit44 @krassenstein just like McCain (since he was from the GOP) he was a third "virtual" term for Bush.  Hillary was a third "virtual" term for Obama.

@csdowner @cookiebandit44 @krassenstein we are not stupid, we have not been fooled, we know that Doanld Trump is not perfect, nor is any man, woman, or child.  We did not hire him becuase we thought he was perfect.  We hired him to protect us and he has.

@Blacklace40 @cookiebandit44 Trump doesn't.  Trump would not be running alone and running for king.

@nuckingfutz33 if it happened in California, everything makes sense
@nuckingfutz33 if you have any unwanted items at your house, just put them inside of an Amazon box and put the box out on your porch
@nuckingfutz33 not all officers are like that.  About a month ago i seen a post of a white police officer going to the aid of a black woman and her breathless baby.  The white officer recussitated the black baby back to life.
If you have some unwanted items this Christmas, put them inside an Amazon box and put the box outside on your porch
@nuckingfutz33 you got to realize though, the police do not know the people handing out the food and now a days there are crazy people that might be handing out poison

@DonaldJTrumpJr @TMZ If he offers another MMA fight with you ...Just say no

@AP just try it!  it will not extinguish everything.  It will help though.  Turn on your garden sprinklers and leave them on.  Your shower too
@ChuckCallesto yes, many people elected Obama to "proove" they were not racist
@SarahPalinUSA Give him a week, he'll top it off.
@AP does that mean Jeff Flake has been dethroned?  I can't tell you how devestating that is
@SarahPalinUSA they should remove more than just a press pass from mic hogs

@nuckingfutz33 we need to offer more than enough, free, mental health.  The Aurora Movie Theater shorly telephones his psychiatrist before the rampage, the psychiatrist was too busy to return the phone call before James went on his rampage

@RealTT2020 @JanetB95072538 Obama was born in Kenya, yet that does not matter.  Look at Ted Cruz.  Ted born in Canada, Ted's mother born in USA.  A federal jusge deemed him qualified to run against Trump in the 2016 Primaries.  Obama did fabricate a fake Hawaiian certificate and simply printed it out
@CheriJacobus @cookiebandit44 if the Russians had the capability of interfering or hacking the elections, the dems would not have won the house during midterms

@cookiebandit44 must be because Russia "hacked things", right?
@cookiebandit44 If the Russians had capabilities of hacking an election, why did the dems win the house ?
@marcorubio my question is, if the Russians had the capabilities of hacking an election, why did the dems win and take over the house?
@grizzlemeister the victories the dems got was becuase of that women superiority march madonna took  part of, the repubs took victories last night too tho
@NateMFNelson @AMAction @AM_National @WI_Majority both sides took victories last night
I gotta be honest, i don't know how safe i feel that a woman that said "if you see anyone from that administration you push back and tell them that they are not welcome".  She if the new secretary of finances?
@kathygriffin Congratsulations, both sides win and lose, it is just the right side is better at "sucking it up" when they loose
@ChuckCallesto in California
@Natalie38707913 Fox News has conservative employees and they have snowflake employyes.  Fox News as a whole is becoming more and more liberal each day.  I wonder if a snowflake employee at Fox said that?
@gatewaypundit @barrygartman it is going to be very strange seeing Trump give a state of the union, with Pence sitting to Trump's right and Pelosi sitting on Trump's left, but maybe that is what we need
@gatewaypundit @barrygartman probably becuase of the democratic victories in California
@hrenee80 @IsraelUSAforevr I am not a citicen of Texas, but am very glad Cruz won.  I knew Beto had just a good a chance of winning Texas as Trump does at winning in California
@hrenee80 @IsraelUSAforevr Fox is becoming more and more liberal and anti-Trump by the day
@mitchellvii @EintheD1 The far left, yes .... moderate democrats, no
@nuckingfutz33 Good news for you tho.   Fox has projected that the dems will flip the house and Nancy Pelosi will  become speaker
@nuckingfutz33 Beto lost, if Trump was running for California senator, he would lose.  If Cruz was running for California senator, he would lose.  Beto is all for impeaching Trump.  Do you really think a very conservative state (where the Bush family is from) would elect a snowflake?
@DAUM4Congress @GOP it is alright if it is a single use room, but a community room, no,  i have had to do a #2 and the only open bathroom was a woman's single, lockable bathroom.  So instead of pooping my pants, I went right in
@DAUM4Congress @GOP some republicans are against standard birth control.  the group of republicans Trump is in with, is not against standard birth control.  I am against having a transexxual be in the same bathroom as my mom at the same time.  Trump is actually okay with it.
@DAUM4Congress @GOP evrything is complex man.  There are far rights, moderates, far lefts, moderates not against having an abortion due to rape, moderates pro birth control, repubs against abortion, i even know some democratic Christians
@LauraLoomer Fox is becoming more and more liberal each day
@nuckingfutz33 @seanhannity Bill Clinton is not back in the house as frst lady https://t.co/kzXT4zMyXB
@seanhannity she was 100 percent sure Hillary would win in 2016 too
@CollectivePAC @staceyabrams we know https://t.co/Nl7yxnmUXK
@brandxit people now a days use twitter and facebook
@DAUM4Congress @GOP Actually a far right repub would probably ban emergency birth control, but Trump is more of a moderate conservative and that is why the Bush family is not to fond of Trump.  Eailer on in life, Trump was a democrat.
@ScottPresler @Tia6sc maybe they went home ... have not heard a word about them lately
@ben_marines @NYCNavid very glad i shaved yesterday
@NevadaJack2 not if you early vote

@DAUM4Congress well I have a heridatory disease and get SSDI.  Trump has been president almost two years,  Obama was president 8 years.  With Obama, I got a 4 dollar per month increase on my SSDI in all of the 8 yrs he was in.  With Trump, so far ..I got a 14 dollar per month increase on SSDI

@tonyposnanski @cookiebandit44 if the democrats did not ban hangings as a deterrent (not lynichings -- lynchings are evil) but hangings and set deterents.  Hangings would be good.  Like Nicholas Cruz, obviously he did kill ...but the democrats have shunned hangings

I watched the video of where she says "If you see anyone from that administration, you push back and tell them that they are not welcome".  Even Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer condemned her
@Fuctupmind I can't wait until you try
@FoxNews @SecNielsen AND  if you go anywhere north of Arizona this time of year and since everyone in the caravan is dressed for the beach, your going to freeze to death
@CNN not me, i encourage Trump to keep telling us that CNN sucks
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump what do you have to say about this?  Can you refute this fact?  I really want to hear what you have to say. https://t.co/aJsL2YddXf
@McFaul @lostint07245298 https://t.co/zEUfLRm9Yy
@robreiner @lostint07245298 What about Maxine Waters?
@TheRevAl why haven't you been arrested for tax evasion,  Al Capone was
@ChuckCallesto cool
@LauraLoomer cool
@SarahPalinUSA as I understand, Mexico did not refuse becuase they wanted to defy Trump.  They refused because the Honduran caravan was vicious https://t.co/yY8KNzrHMm
@LauraLoomer go out and get a massage
@NevadaJack2 i encourage Trump to continue telling us to chant, "CNN sucks"
@grizzlemeister The Lord, my boss and Trumps boss too, does not want anyone going anywhere illegally and killing others, so by all means build walls
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Recently, I seen a video of where families from North Korea and South Korea were reuniting and hugging each other.  Like I said Trump, the president of China, and Dennis Rodman, all three, deserve a Nobel
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump they spoke no Englsih.  Through an interpreter, I asked them if they had any dearly missed relatives that lived in North Korea and they are not allowed to see them.  They answered YES.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump i went to school at Hawaii Pacific University.  It is a school with the highest amount of internatinal students in this nation.  There was one time we hosted students from South Korea on a summer trip.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump what is a PR manager?  what is PR an abbreviation for?
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump you just said the he was ruthless and rich.  How does that confirm what you just said?
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/IprtXRhItl
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump when did Trump or anyone from his administration, declare nuclear war?  The president of China, Donald Trump, and Dennis Rodman, all three deserve a Nobel for convincing Kim to denuke
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump did you see this video what Trump did 16 years ago?  https://t.co/D05GjQbXhD
@nuckingfutz33 @rieb6611 @realDonaldTrump wish guns were never invented.  but they have been and not all people adhere to laws.  The police are not omnipresent and unfortunately, some (not all), but some, of the police are only out for themselves and we need guns to protect ourselves
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Trump's ex also said, Trump did many things to convince me to divorce him, but and this is a big but, she said, "Trump is far from being a racist".
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump we need to present things to Trump instead of just bitching about Trump.  Trump is more of a moderate conservative and that is why the Bush family is not too fond of Trump.  At one time, Trump used to be a democrat.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump we need to have more free mental health and the psychiatrists should be able to return a phone call instantly
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump The Sandy Hook Shooter has Asperger's.  The Gab Gifford's shooter, sadly looks and acts like uncle festor from the Adam's Family.  The Florida High School Shooter, immediately after he shot the people and before the police caught him, went to McDonalds/Subway and ordered a meal
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump do you know the Aurora Movie Theater shooter, shortly before his rampage, telephones his psychiatrist, but the psychiatrist was too busy to return the phone call before James went on his rampage?

@charliekirk11 Al Capone was busted for tax evasion, so should Al Sharpton

@Fuctupmind i don't wonder
@LauraLoomer https://t.co/Gul56XFkwP
@NevadaJack2 so should Nicholas Cruz and Sheriff Israel
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Don't you remember?  we tried banning and outlawing drugs.  Do you think it stopped or encouraged bad people from getting them?
@grizzlemeister kind of like that democratic Kennedy dude that bashed Trump after Trump's state of the union.  Kennedy said, "Thank you, Thank You, Thank you, Thank you, Thank You, Thank you, yo hablo espanol" and that's about it

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump my wife became a U.S. citizen based on merit
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump i am familiar of the process of making a non-citizen a citizen.  I am a us citizen and my wife has dual citizenship from Taiwan and hte USA.  She needed to find SPONSORS.  Sponsors can not be family members.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump ne she and her parents waited in line, got U.S. sponsors, and paid the fees to legally become US citizens

@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump hypothetically, if all four corner states voted for Trump and just California voted for Hillary, Hillary would win.
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Obmama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, all the democrat presidents won because of the electoral college as well.  California gets 55 votes, the four corner states get less than half of 55 (when they are combined).
@nuckingfutz33 @realDonaldTrump Trump by himself is evil ... Trump is not alone though and there are many that support him.  A major reason that I like Trump is because of Melania
@MichaelAvenatti @cookiebandit44 @ChuckGrassley how dare you challenge Don Junior to an MMA fight.  YOU have had years experience training in to and know elbow blows are allowed in MMA and fighter forfeight the right to blame death on the opponent.

@MericaIsSoGreat if they go north of Arizona when they get here if they get here.  Hopefully the troops that went there stop the ones from doing this and the women and children are sent home.  water cannons, pepper spray, and stun guns will stop the ones doing thist https://t.co/HtMfcmk4xd

@HLAurora63 @JanetB95072538 did you see when he rebutted Trump's state of the union.  Kennedy said "Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, yo hablo epsanol" and that is about it
@DiamondandSilk nation wide
@Gregythehorse @jonswaine thanks for the warning bitch
@JJWatt holy ghost, holy ghost ..whoever eats the fastest eats the most
@Trump454545 @JanetB95072538 even if the employer is pro-hillary.  they usually do not like seeing that behavior, unless the empolyer is Maxine Waters
@Trump454545 @JanetB95072538 most employers do not like to see their employees treating anyone like that
@Trump454545 @JanetB95072538 i bet you #10 will be unemployed tomorrow
@SarahPalinUSA people just wanted to see how they were going to kill off Roseanne.  Next episode, viewership will decrease even more
@brandxit at this point in time, what difference does it make?
@grizzlemeister Laura Loomer is cool!!! she pointed out the most obvious question.  Why did none of the packages have post marks?
@FoxNews cool
@jonswaine add David Elsey to the list
@DonaldJTrumpJr AND Maxine Waters
@NevadaJack2 i would officially refer Avenatti to hell
@robreiner @cookiebandit44 donald trump alone is that, donald trump is not alone
@Breaking911 @hillbillygnan i hope someone recognizes who that white guy was and gives him karma
@BernieSanders what do you think the population at those universities will be?  how will any student get devoted attention to their work?
@Fuctupmind @Winterbaby129 Laura Lommer posed the greatest question of all ... why were there no postmarks on the packages?
@GartrellLinda @IsraelUSAforevr @FoxNews she is strange.  before Donald was elected she was talking hate.  Last week she sounded pro-Trump
@DRUDGE_REPORT @CatholicLady055 ya, because they were FAKE
@mud6767 @1776Stonewall real ammo can be used on the guys of the caravan, the women and children the weeker stuff (actually none for them)
@LauraLoomer very good question, very glad to follow you

@GreenPeaches2 @VABVOX @cookiebandit44 @ElectoralCollge https://t.co/ZIdkei1G0T
@GreenPeaches2 @VABVOX @cookiebandit44 @ElectoralCollge California gets 55 electoral college votes.  About tice as more the four corner state get combined.  Hypothetically speaking, if AZ, CO, NM, and Utah all voted Trump (is not what really happened, but this is hypothetical) and only California voted for hillary, hillary would win
@GreenPeaches2 @VABVOX @cookiebandit44 @ElectoralCollge the electoral college is the reason Obama, Bill Clinton, every democratic president won too
@ChuckCallesto hope they are equipped with lots and lots of pepper spray and rubber bullets https://t.co/fHJi0pYPiu

@dtxErgaOmnes @cookiebandit44 @tedcruz its hard to respect a woman that asks "at this point, what difference does it make"  and it's hard to respect a man that flees from police officers that are about to give him a DWAI and also says Texas police officers still value Jim Crow
@ProudResister @cookiebandit44 https://t.co/VEAw4QyAe9
@michaelschweitz @cookiebandit44 i early voted --all red.  i usually vote a mixed bag, but the left really pissed me off by condemmning Kavenaugh based on mere here say and their hate for Trump
@DavidCornDC @brandxit @realDonaldTrump was there anything discouraging hillary from asking "at this point in time, what difference does it make"?
@Fuctupmind who in the hell would put a return address on a bomb?
@DLoesch If a spider has a red spot on it, worry about it.  If it is a trantula the pet store sells, don't worry about it.
@_SJPeace_ @brandxit yep we do
@VABVOX @cookiebandit44 Most Californians voted for Hillary.  California is in North America, but is not the whole USA

@ProudResister @cookiebandit44 i hope it snows and snows hard when the caravan arrives
@lacerci65 @JanetB95072538 @ILMFOrg yep,  it was a hint
@ProudResister @cookiebandit44 AND hillary asked on CNN live coverage television "At this point in time, what difference does it make"?  Hmmmmmm, if it was Chelsea massacred in Benghaci would it had made a difference?  Then again, with Hillary ---probably not

@ChuckCallesto what are they going to do if they arrive here and it is snowing?  there MUST be some vicious people in the caravan if they defeated the Mexican police
@charliekirk11 @shylohg it's a ploy

@OMJason @cnni to make people believe it was the republicans the did this, when it was really the dems that sent duds that would not explode, but looks real

@President1Trump @KamalaHarris the crowd that she did draw, strangely looks like all caucasion
@AP they can share 1 million dollars with 1600 different people
@FoxNews what are they going to do if it snows when they get here?
they should just send pink pussy hats to keep the caravan warm
@ahal79 @FoxNews @foxnewsnight no, there is a hurricaine there.  it does snow north of Mexico, there headed there
@cyndisauter @ahal79 @FoxNews @foxnewsnight i bet they did not go up into the mountains wearing shorts and flip flops
@derekcarrqb brother, it is not a "popular" thing to be a part of any NFL team, but we  know who you are dude,
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight what are they going to do if it snows?  They are already facing a hurricaine
@FoxNews @foxnewsnight what are they going to do if it snows
@CB618444 @JanetB95072538 when the mid terms are over and colder weather sets in, they will be going home
@TheNoahRing @JanetB95072538 "If you like your plan, you can keep it"?
@chuckwoolery there looks to be only caucasions
@marcorubio @POTUS I seen videos of the caravan.  They do not look prepared for a hurricaine  and if the hurricaine veers to the north and a cold front comes in, we will have a blizzard
@AP the winner can share one million dollars with about 1600 different people
@LaylaAlisha11 @JanetB95072538 i am pro-Trump, yet that is hard to believe.  Most every place will serve anyone as long as they have $
@goldendoekd hey, maybe we can nominate them to go on a trip to experiment living on Mars
@EricTrump https://t.co/QsyruoDXAW
@JackPosobiec @JanetB95072538 all of them are wearing short sleeve shirts ... some of them are even wearing shorts and flip flops ... has anyone here ever ventured outside in the snow wearing their attire?
@goldendoekd deport them to desolate parts of Canada.  they don't look prepared for a hurricaine that is making landfall in Mexico right now, and they are up shit creek if a cold front comes in
@gatewaypundit deport them to desolate parts of Canada.  they don't look prepared for a hurricaine that is making landfall in Mexico right now, and they are up shit creek if a cold front comes in
@w_terrence they don't look prepared for a cold front ... they are already facing a hurricaine right now ...i don't think they will like snow
@CLPine @lovenot29206248 @tradermark017 @jaketapper @redsteeze @BarackObama it was taken the same time Louisiana was having flooding.  This picture is not beffitting of a president
@rumpldtrumpskin @kwilli1046 yep --seeing how Bill Clinton was found guilty with forensic science evidence
@CountryJazz4 about thirty years ago i played a computer game at school called "The Oregan Trail", I live in Colorado.  I learned that if you do not have shelter and warm clothes or even a car, do not go to Colorado, Northern Arizona, or New Mexico this time of year
https://t.co/BMgOfLO92y
@RealJoeKarni @grizzlemeister @gatewaypundit the people in the caravan the viciously attacked the Mexican police officers, making them bleed profusively, i hope the attackers do freeze to death  BUT I have also seen babies in diapers and short sleeve shirts ..they should not suffer because of their idiotic parents
@FoxNews @HawleyMO @POTUS @AmericaNewsroom if that caravan does not turn aroung, they are going to get an abrupt introducation to deathly cold weather and most of them are wearing shorts
@CountryJazz4 i have seen picture of women in shorts pushing their carriages of children in nothing but diapers.  Suicide for people who know nothing of tempratures below 70 degrees F
@yeshua_porvida @unashamedojesus i don't know who told them to come now.  if that caravan marches north of Arizona they are going to get frost bite and even die.  The Hondurans know nothing about cold
@perlmutations @pherlicious think about how crazy it is for a Homduran to travel to where it snows, they have no guarantees shelter and they know nothing about surviving in the cold.  Wearing shorts and flip flops and marching north of Arizona this time of year is not very smart
@chuckwoolery ?
@grizzlemeister @gatewaypundit it is becuase of their weak clothing and no coats, that when a cold front comes in, they are going to freeze, get frost bite, and some of the weaker will sadly die.  They need to turn around now.  They are already headed to a hurricaine.
@CNN the president of China seems to be okay with Trump .... you are bullshitting us again
@RealSaavedra @GladysKravitz9 they did
@CNN it's a warlock hunt
@WayneDupreeShow Don't they know, Obama is not president anymore and we will not give them any handouts
@DrThomasFish @Winterbaby129 i seen that on the weather channel
@RNcat50 @Lmc30807732 i hope a severe snow storm hits them and hits them hard
@GartrellLinda i seen the Texas ralley tonight.  Beto ought to flee, like he fled when officers were going to give him a DWAI
@RealJamesWoods that was cheesy
@Walmart what in the world?  why assume everone is a Dodger fan?  Go Red Sox, the series is not even started yet
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews umm correct me if i am wrong, but you usually do not burn the flag of a country you are supposedely seeking assylum to.  that looks more like an act of war
@NevadaJack2 Trump is more delicate with words.  I say she is a SLUT
@6foot5tom @TheDemocrats interesting how it is that only two feminists were in that commercial
@6foot5tom @TheDemocrats Puerto Ricans, people from Guam, people from the US Virgin Isands, people from the Mariana islands, and people from American Samoa are only allowed to VOTE in our primaries
@Fuctupmind she allowed a dude to get her pregnate?
@Fuctupmind right now
@Education4Libs not to worry dude, it is cool right now north of Arizona, it is going to be deathly cold in a week or tw  50 degrees is cold to a Honduran, what they going to do when it gets 30, 20, 10, 0 or even below zero without a house and heater?
@DonaldJTrumpJr that thought has crossed my mind, i am wondering if those people are none other than George Soros
@SarahPalinUSA did anybody told him yet that when he says something like that, he will actually encourage more women to support Trump
@Pamperpros @Winterbaby129 @RealJamesWoods if you left when it was summer in New York, you woul reach Colorado or Wyoming in mid winter and when it is mid-winter in Wyoming and Colorado, things are quite brutal
@Pamperpros @Winterbaby129 @RealJamesWoods but if we don't shelter tehm, Hondurans know nothing about the cold.  i remember as a child playing Oregan Trail.  The best time to leave New York to California when walking is when it is mid-winter in New York.  By the time you get to Colorado or Wyoming, it will be Spring
@Fuctupmind send them all some free smart phones with youtube downloaded.  then send them all this link  https://t.co/4OrPkWxqXY

@chuckwoolery you are the reason I like scrabble so much,  i already early voted.  to tell you the truth, i usually vote a mixed bag.  BUT the left really pissed me off by convicting Kavenaugh on just mere here say.  AND when the FBI and Ford shunned herself, the libs kept on convicting Kav..
@Fuctupmind we know
@ChuckCallesto FABULOUS
@Fuctupmind @gatewaypundit some candidates fom the blue will win (with the exception of Nancy Pelosi, the Californians will win, like unfortunately Maxine Waters will win) but there will be no blue wave.  and Beto has just as much a chance of winning Texas as Trump has winning California --(NONE)

@grizzlemeister @SKYRIDER4538 @LeahR77 @IsraelUSAforevr @mike_Zollo @bbusa617 @Megan4MAGA @ArizonaKayte @starcrosswolf @carrieksada i don't go to the polls, i early vote.  i normally vote a mixed bag, but this time around the left really pissed me off by convicting Kavenaugh on mere here say and even after the FBI concluded NOTHING, they still convicted him.  i early voted pure red.
@SarahPalinUSA is, he is racist, he is a New England Patriot now https://t.co/Dyl6XI3Cje
@marcorubio @POTUS https://t.co/I9zYEOjUQ7
@SarahPalinUSA the cold weather will
@Education4Libs i wonder if they are starting to notice, the weather at night is getting colder than they are used to
@Fuctupmind huge
i bet the Hondurans will be begging to be flown home for free once a cold front comes in
@realDonaldTrump they will freeze in their tracks this time of year
@realDonaldTrump not to worry, the cold weather they will encounter when going north of Arizona and New Mexico and even parts of ARizona and New Mexico will have them begging to be flon home for free.  Hondurnas don't know cold
@grizzlemeister they are going to be begging to be flown home for free when a cold front comes through
@freedom_moates yes, their hair is usually dyed  --well you asked
@Robert_Martin72 @cookiebandit44 where the same clothes and speak the same language

@SarahPalinUSA they are going to freeze to death, not exaggerating
@SarahPalinUSA they are going to literally freeze to death
@ChuckCallesto Steven King has a morbid mind.  If that caravan goes north of Arizona, they are going to see frost bite for the very first time and some may even die.  Hondurans don't know cold
@Fuctupmind they are accustomed to heat waves (even in the winter) ... they are going to be begging to go home when a cold front comes in and this time of year they will be coming soon .... it has already snowed here in Colorado, it usually does not start until October 31st.  its early
https://t.co/99M4Q1BpRC
@marcorubio you know this, your often in Florida, but you are also often in Washington DC ... if that caravan travels anywhere north of Arizona and by the looks of their clothes, when a cold front comes in, they are literally going to  to freeze to death.
@SarahPalinUSA about a month ago i seen a story of where there was a white officer that aided a blck woman and her breathless baby.  The white officer recussitated the black baby back to life. https://t.co/SdZHL45Ide

@THEHermanCain if they march north of Arizona or march to New Mexico, this time of the year and since they all have summer clothing and no winter clothing ... since it does not snow in Honduras, when a cold front hits, they will literally freeze to death

@AP they don't look dressed for any cold fronts
@AP if they travel north of Arizona and most parts in New Mexico, they are actually going to freeze to death ...Hondurans do not know cold.  Right now it is cool and soon to be colder
@IsraelUSAforevr that is all she knows how to do ....nod in agreement
@Natalie38707913 if hte Honduran caravan travels north of Arizona or even parts of Northern New Mexico, they are not going to be just cold, but many of them will actually freeze to death ...Hondurans don't know cold ..right now it is cool and soon to be colder

@peterpride37 @JanetB95072538 @DCClothesline when a cold front comes in, they will be begging to go home
@cookiebandit44 they should have seated the black lady in first class and then seated the stubborn dork in the seat she left
@Pamperpros @Winterbaby129 @RealJamesWoods they will be begging to go back, once a winter cold front comes in
@NevadaJack2 if they travel north of Arizona or even parts of northern New Mexcio, they are going to freeze to death.  Hondurans do not know cold
@grizzlemeister the hit probably activated a nerve in his brain

@Portosj81 do you know, in the Muslim culture, the largest insult is to show the bottom of your shoes.  When Obama was president Obama propped up his shoes so the cameraman would film the bottom of his shoes while talking on the phone to the prime minister of Israel. https://t.co/FRtcvemoBB
@DontMockMyTypos i know, they should not even try --if they are seeking assylum --Mexico would be better becasue Mexico has warm weather and speak the same language as Honduras
@Fuctupmind @nypost if they go anywhere north of Arizona, this time of year they will freeze to death (not joking)

@FoxNews @SenatorDurbin Republicans won presidency
@ButchWal @USAF77David @jakepalmieri @gaye_gallops If they were seeking assylum from Honduras than Mexico would be the safest place for them.  Mexico speaks the same language as Honduras.  If they go anywhere north of Aricona during this time of year, they will freeze to death (no joke)

@theresasarcasm @Emmett_Stone @marcorubio Marco does do things that are good in the eyes of many.  To the people who live in Texas, the NRA is good.

@Miamidelphia @SteffiChupein @marcorubio this is twitter, not the state of Florida government website
@SteffiChupein @marcorubio It is twiiter, not the state of Florida government website
@TeaPainUSA @cookiebandit44 not convinced with your bullshit ... the reason i voted for Trump and it was an early by mail vote, was because i seen the CNN video of hillary asking "at this point in time, what difference does it make"?  gee, if it was Chelsea in Benghazi, i am betting at that point it would.
@FoxNews Pope Francis should be x-communicated.  I am not catholic, but have heard from many catholics that he should.  Francis has shocked many of the catholics by saying that there is no hell.  Jean Paul, if alive today, would ne repulsed by Francis
@ROHLL5 @JanetB95072538 If I was a Californian, I would vote for her opponent, but the way California is set mided, she will win.  There is a very slim chance Beto will win in Texas, for a similar reason on the opposite end of the spectrum
@grizzlemeister do they realize they would be losing a huge advantedge, especially when you see how many vites California gets and how many the surrounding states get.  The four corner states get less than California when combined.  The electoral college is how every democrat president has won
@JulianSvendsen @1acemadsen1 @realDonaldTrump i usually vote a mixed bag, but this time the liberals really pissed me off by convicring Kaveaugh on mere "here say", even after the FBI shunned them.

@Gomez_Iroc when i seen a news story about three weeks ago and in the video a white officer came to the aid of a black woman and her breathless baby.  The white officer recussitated the black baby back to life.  We should kneel when they make a touch down.
@BetteMidler @cookiebandit44 A higher minimum wage?  if the minimum wage goes up, there is nothing stopping the landlord from rasing the rent.  There is nothing stopping the managers at Wendy's from hiking the prices
@RonaldKlain @cookiebandit44 your a hideous idiot

@leeleeb50 @cookiebandit44 i am pretty sure the votes from the military installations is what gave Trump a huge advantedge in 2016
@leeleeb50 @cookiebandit44 oh and i early voted by mail, like I did with Trump.  I know absolutely for sure Russia can't hack mail in votes
@leeleeb50 @cookiebandit44 guess what I early voted today,  i marked all republican candidates, usually I early voes and it's a mixture of democrats and republicans.  Not this time, the libs really pissed me off by blaming Kavenaugh on mere "here say"
@ChuckCallesto i still would like to see a report from the mormon geneolgy library in Salt Lake City
@bbusa617 she has prooven that her great, great, grandfather was a native american, got drunk and banged her great, great, grandmother
@HLAurora63 @Patriot_Mom_17 Trump used to de democrat, not far left, but a moderate democrat
@KMGGaryde @Boyd_2650 it is more important to me that others are better off
@ScottFrazier19 @pherlicious had to?  Elizabeth Warren did not have to.  It would have actually been better for her if she did not.  We all know about Trump's finances and how he was unfair.  At one time he was a millionaire and claimed bankruptcy.  Oh well!
@MaxBoot @cookiebandit44 villifies the FBI?  The FBI handed down Feinstein's ass and there was no villifying the FBI.  Your other rants are also pure bullshit
@sahluwal @pherlicious what about the video is seen last month, in the video there was a white police officer that aided a black woman and her breathless baby.  The white police officer resussitated the black baby back to life.

@chaumes21 @CNNPolitics can she share any stories about Native American heritage or even speak any of the Native American languages.  There are many tribes
@chaumes21 @CNNPolitics i honestly think a hillary supporter and elizabeth warren friend, simply added the minute percentage into the report

@charliekirk11 Stormy can always borrow money from Peter Pan https://t.co/GujWgnK52C
@realDonaldTrump you can't rely on those DNA tests.  The Mormon Church rarely lies.  Have them do a geneology research in the records library at the temple in Salt Lake City
@real_farmacist @cookiebandit44 there has to be a hand shake too
@SarahPalinUSA Trump forgot to say "your highness"
@chaumes21 @CNNPolitics and we don't know that for sure.  what is stopping a hillary supporter from just adding that informatin into the report?
@Fuctupmind @realDonaldTrump there were no hand shakes
@SarahPalinUSA not convinced because the people who run those tests are very liberal.  If there is a geneolgy study from the mormon church and Salt Lake City then I would be convinced.
@Fuctupmind @realDonaldTrump DNA tests are not full proof.  She needs to have a mormon librarian search geneology records in Slat Lake City
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelAvenatti @POTUS Stormy (aka Tinker Bell) can always borrow money from Peter Pan https://t.co/eT4QkS4386

@hdmartin88 a screen shot of Obama like this, should have never been taken anyhwere from 2008-2016. VERY Unprofessional of a president
@CBSNews https://t.co/TwnmwaGqYw
@ChrisLoesch @EintheD1 i see Beto winning in Texas, just as much as i see Trump winning in California and CNN
@JJWatt sorry younger brother, the NFL is not as poular as it used to be
@MrsRabbitResist @cookiebandit44 robots can pick them
@FoxNews i honestly never heard of them before
@CNN that is a way to make people believe in a lie, mix in a little TRUTH.  It is true Trump will more that likely be granted a second term, thanks to the president of North Korea and his willing to negotiate with the USA, to which I believe Dennis Rodman started
@HaileyWheelgun @cookiebandit44 @GOP there are idiots on both sides of the aisle, just more of them on the left
@MckieShane @ScottRickhoff It was not an abuse of power!  it was an escape from HER
@stucam7771 @pherlicious https://t.co/eNKRYsaNmT
@stucam7771 @pherlicious did you also see the second debate Trump had with Hillary.  Trump did what his boss instruced us to do.  Trump told us he did "locker room talk", was not proud he did, and appologized.
@WayneDupreeShow @SassCBrown she is saying that becuase Bill and Monica were adults
@NevadaJack2 we should kneel when they make a touchdown
@dbongino @DykstraDame we know, brudder
@NTKNet @RyanAFournier most presidents (not all), but most serve two terms, with the positive things he and Dennis Rodman did with North Korea, Trump will be granted two terms

@gr8tjude he is really horrible.  He wants to fight with Don Junior in the MMA.  The MMA is a style of martial arts where they use martial arts offensively.  Martial arts is defense.  In the MMA, you forfeish the right to blame death on an opponent.  I think he wants to legally kill

@ChuckCallesto that was awsome
@6foot5tom @TheDemocrats when hillary was recorded on video asking "At this point, what difference does it make"  She lost my vote and Russia had nothing to do with it.  i think if it was Chelsea slaughtered and burned in 	Benghazi, hillary NEVER would ask such a disheartening question ... (then again)?
@ChuckCallesto it would not be a good idea
@SarahPalinUSA It is not too late, bring her back

@Sunrise51052 @EintheD1 evidnce, Ford needed that.  She did not get it.
@LauraLoomer @keithellison oh, he is guilty by evidence and not here say or the fact the Hillary lost the 2016 presedential elections?
@RealJamesWoods isn't the resemblence uncanny? https://t.co/kYxdMDD1hn
@ConservaMomUSA @EintheD1 i thought so, as soon as Kavenaugh was confirmed I honestly thought they were getting out their cauldrons and brewing up something
@FoxNews why doesn't she go and fight with the Taliban?
@ChuckCallesto that is a minor detail
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr his name is Spartacus
@PoliticallyRYT @Jali_Cat Obama won because of the electoral college
@PoliticallyRYT @Jali_Cat that would be a huge loss for California.  The electoral college is the same system that gave victory to all the democratic preidents too
@Thomas1774Paine @BlessPres45 as of last week they were planning to kill of Roseanne in the spin-off because of an opioid overdose.  They could just scrap that and let Roseanne live and come back.
@theresagiudice @marcorubio the hero that shot the Texas Church shooter, was a certified NRA instructor armed with an AR-15.  If the hero would not have shot the shooter, the shooter would have killed more people.
@Fuctupmind When Tebow kneeled when he made a touchdown was not impressive.  If he knelt when the NFL players that kneel during the national anthem and did not point to the sky, now that would be impressive
@Fuctupmind when Tebow's mother was pregnant and Tim was the baby, Tim's mother was asked by her doc to have an abortion --she declined ... also what is impressive is Tim took a girl with cerebal pulsie to her prom.
@Fuctupmind when Tim Tebow, kneels and points to the sky after making a touch down, it is not impressive.  Tim being living proof that doctors are full of it when they say a woman may need an abortion for medical reasons, now that is impressive
@chuckwoolery if Trump did something like that he could be legally and legitimately impeached.   One can not impeach a president or supreme court justicle without evidence of a crime committed
@LEBassett @cookiebandit44 there are idiots on both sides of the aisle, just more of them on the left
@glenn87027633 it is becuase during the second debate he had with Hillary when talking about locker room tald, Trump did what we believe God told us to do, confess that we did something wrong, tell people that you are not proud you did, and applogize ... Trump did that  https://t.co/eNKRYsaNmT
@ChuckCallesto the very first thing I look at when I see a picture of hillary, i notice her eyes go wacko without photoshop ...anyone else?

@myserenity69 @cookiebandit44 is it rude to defeat hillary?
@Fuctupmind we know
@Natalie38707913 @ChuckCallesto it was quite vicious when Bush junior was president (sometimes even more than it is now).  Bush didn't use twitter that much, but it was still brutal
@Fuctupmind @BreitbartNews that shoul be just a "starter"
@AuthNJMcConnell https://t.co/PIPx4xqxZP
@Fuctupmind serious, no joke, she shouuld be required to have her tubes tied --many people who may be pro-choice are probably repulsed
@AP was it the Russians?
@LauraLoomer cool, i hope he goes to court and is hanged as an accessory to the crime
@SarahPalinUSA ABC should scrap the spin off, bring back Roseanne and don't kill her off with opioids.
@sikverchic @marcorubio then there will be rich people sharing their money with Cuba, not a bad idea
@sikverchic @marcorubio https://t.co/4MgzPeJeQm
@glenn87027633 Nancy would be sitting on Trump's left and Pence would be sitting on his right.  I also do not think Beto will take Texas, but i do think some of the dems will win.  Beto winning Texas would be like Trump winning California
@glenn87027633  i honestly think some of the democrats will win.  it makes sense.  when Obama was president and at midterms some of the conservatives won at midterm.  But I am not fond of Nancy Pelosi and think it would be very weird seein Trump give a state of the union

@DonaldJTrumpJr this is important for women and children that may be attaked, the fastes and most affective way to protect yourself is to hit that attacker with your elbow.  Avenatti wants to use martial arts as an offense and in MMA it is legal to attack with your elbow
@DonaldJTrumpJr In the MMA you forfeight placing blame of death
@DonaldJTrumpJr not shocked dude ... hire lawyers to read anything beifre you sign and fight Avenatti, even if he says "it is for charity".  I think Avenatti wants to legally kill you and you can legally kill someone in the MMA.  If there is a death, ...

@RightHook99 @GrayceEnmerci he gives a bad reputation to Charlie Brown's dog
@marcjohnson0002 it is the less painless option
@SenCoryGardner it is because the democratic party was kicked out of the white house in 2016, well the G.O.P. was kicked out in 2008, and the dems kicked out in 2000.  Not always, but most of the time ..ever 8 years political parties take turns as president
@NevadaJack2 that is impeachable
@6foot5tom @piersmorgan especially since there was physical forensic science evidence
@CNNPolitics if you are sexually assaulted just scream "stop, i have AIDS"
@DeplorableChoir @hilda_brand $
@johnnaaaaaaaa @piersmorgan https://t.co/k9z0RAgcua
@piersmorgan first person ever recorded.  i am sure Obama said that EVERYDAY when he was president
@DonaldJTrumpJr Avenatti wants to legally kill you and with the MMA he can.
@DonaldJTrumpJr be sure to have lawyers read anything if you decide to sign anything when doing anything with Avenatti.  Avenatti may say it is just for charity, but when you look at what he does, who he defends, and he just looks like the devil's spawn.

@cookiebandit44 I know, she or her family was probably given a death threat
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Ms. Ford needs to appollogize for "tricking" the polygraph people and having people believe her bogus story when there are true sexual assault victims
@ChuckCallesto In MMA they use martial arts offensively.  Martial arts is for defense.
@ChuckCallesto I did not know what MMA even was until I used FireFox to find out (i don't like Googe and they ought to be banned), Avenatti want to physically fight Trump's kid?  PATHETIC !!!!
@PatsyResists @brandxit @FoxNews Fox News is as bad as CNN and sometimes (not always), but at times, they even bash our president
@glenn87027633 i am looking forward to having someone of American Indian heritage and not Pocahontus as a president
@realAliTweets @pherlicious 70% of Ford's go gond me funds should be redistibuted to charities that take care of actual assaulted women, men, and children.  The other 30% to Kavenaugh for reimbursement.

@justgivemesun @LadyFr8 @mitchellvii @d_bogatay the proverb also says and its good to know when not to be silent.  Bill Clinton  was found guilty, not because Kavenaugh the republicans hated the Clintons, because of physical forensic science evidence.  Ford does not have that nor any credible witnesses, just a hatred of Trump
@VinceEustace you are gullible
@LadyFr8 @justgivemesun @mitchellvii @d_bogatay exactly, they also could watch the hearing on video, over and over.   In their minds, finite as they are, they believe Kavenaugh is guilty because Hillary lost the 2016 elections
@justgivemesun @LadyFr8 @mitchellvii @d_bogatay the FBI evaluated by watching the hearing over and over
@justgivemesun @LadyFr8 @mitchellvii @d_bogatay don't you think the F.B.I. watched the hearing over and over, you know the one where the female asking both Kavenaugh and Ford said that the case would not hold water in a court of law
@ChuckCallesto it is not a matter of them losing, it is a matter that Ford was humiliated for lying
@DiamondandSilk i actually hope so, they will humiliate themselves big time

@CHIZMAGA @USAF77David If Nancy Pelosi becomes third in charge, impeechment attempts will be made three times as much as they are now of both Trump and Pence (even though there have been no laws broekn by Trump or Pence), their effort will triple
@CHIZMAGA @USAF77David yes, Nancy Pelosi must not take over Paul Ryan's jon.  Envision this --Trump gives a state of he union adress with Pence and Pelosi on his right and left.  Horrible thought
@RhinoluvsUSA @JanetB95072538 @WashTimes I agree !!!  Keith is guilty, Brett is not

@MsFarRight @JanetB95072538 electrify the door
@FoxNews take a knee when he makes a touch down
@SarahPalinUSA i think the FBI needs to post a copy of their report on Twitter
@VinceEustace Kavenaugh was not a judge, he was the one being accused
@VinceEustace In the case with Bill Clinton, there was evidence.  Forenisc science evidence.  In the case with Kavenaugh there was mere "here say", she said, he said.  The hearing with Ford and Kavenaugh was not a job interview. it was a hearing of where Kav was being accused.
@LauraLoomer @JohnKasich at this point Ford could come right on out and say "i am sorry, i lied" and the far left wouls till say Kavebaugh is gulty

@BOB0101RLC @cookiebandit44 i would be hugely depressed if and only if Kavenaugh was guilty of sexual abuse and of the FBI found him guilty.  Kavenaugh is and was found to be innocent, so i am pretty stoked

@VinceEustace the only reason these anti-Kavenaugh people are calling U.S. senators and giving them death threats is because hillary lost the 2016 presednital elction.  There was an FBI report indicating Kav is innocent https://t.co/9KeXBCiHca
@AuthNJMcConnell the absolute only reason you believe Ford (even after the FBI investigation) please rebutt this argument, the only reason Kavenaugh is guilty is because Hillary lost
@Fuctupmind @gatewaypundit how did hillary supporters get their numbers?

@chuckwoolery since it is not in prison, why does not it move to Amsterdam where there are more its
@chuckwoolery at that paticular point in time, he was not the judge, he was the accused
@cristinapada @pinkish_plague @Luke03942566 @RodStryker @WSAcanuck @phyounge @mrbromwich seems to me and a lot and i mean a lot of people (republican and democrat).  That Kavenaugh only seems to be guilty because Hillary lost
@cristinapada @pinkish_plague @Luke03942566 @RodStryker @WSAcanuck @phyounge @mrbromwich we will see tommorow.

@SarahPalinUSA our boss, whom is Trump's boss too, has better plans for Kavenaugh anyways

@pinkish_plague @Luke03942566 @RodStryker @WSAcanuck @phyounge @mrbromwich Ford said she had a phobia of flying in airplanes and could not make it to DC from California on a following Monday to testify.  She flew to DC that Thursday.  She also admitted to flying to Hawaii (which is 7 islands in the middle of the Pacific ocean)
@AuthNJMcConnell i think in 2024, a majority of the people will become fed up again with republicans and the president will be democratic.  Then in 2032, people will once again become fed up with the democrats and the president will be republican

@pinkish_plague @Luke03942566 @RodStryker @WSAcanuck @phyounge @mrbromwich Bill Clinton was prooven guilty.  There, at one time was only the accusation that he had oral sex with Monica.

@cookiebandit44 someone named Simar sent you a tweet to shame a white woman that called the police supposedly because she was racist and seen a hispanic woman in the car.  Let's shame the hispanic woman for leaving her baby in a locked car with the sun beating down on the baby.
@sahluwal @cookiebandit44 if you watch the video you see that the older white woman calls the police because she seen a baby in a car with the car locked and the sun beating down on the child.
