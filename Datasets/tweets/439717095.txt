Texas' property average property tax rate is one of nation's highest, 2-plus percent, and more than twice as high as California's, but average homeowner tax bills are virtually equal. https://t.co/dkIhGdV6K2 https://t.co/MHdW1OMvyb
I took an in-depth look at California's overall taxes a few weeks ago. https://t.co/N9cvaiGqS7 https://t.co/Akoueolta2
Nor should one look at property taxes in a vacuum, but rather as one component of a system. Californians are now paying about $300B in local and state taxes each year, or about 12% of personal income, among the nation's five highest relative burdens. https://t.co/Akoueolta2
But with California's uber-high property values, Californians' overall property tax burden is more or less average as portion of personal income. That's why the 11-fold increase, equaling or surpassing growth in sales and income taxes, is not obscure but in fact very pertinent. https://t.co/Akoueolta2
Even at 1% turnover, that would be big reassessment effect over 39 years. Purchases of new homes are also a form of turnover from builder. Regardless of factors, 11-fold increase in revenue speaks for itself https://t.co/ZCbc8l8bd8

Custom software was also on disks or other media when loophole was punched, and often still is https://t.co/RinkfwHlHT
Not unless they are integral to the final physical - and taxable - product. That's the law. But a cogent argument can be made for taxing services like physical goods, and lowering the overall rate of taxation accordingly. https://t.co/0Ru9IVWawT
This is why custom software needed special loophole: https://t.co/sIiip9LwVQ https://t.co/VLSVLYY5cs
By that logic, any physical product should be taxed only on the value of its raw materials, not services that went into the final product, such as clothing that's cut and sewn. That would include off-the-shelf software which, as you know, is fully taxed. Thus it is a loophole. https://t.co/VLSVLYY5cs
