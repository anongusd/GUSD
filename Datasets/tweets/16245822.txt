That's a wrap for me. Thanks for joining! Studying ancient creatures like sharks helps us understand how organisms develop and change over time, and resources like @PaleoDigAtlas provide researchers with data they couldn't otherwise access.  #takeovernsf #FossilFriday https://t.co/1rghrptcK1
My favorite Cretaceous #shark is Ptychodus, because it was so large and it‚Äôs so weird. It looked like a normal shark, but its teeth aren‚Äôt anything like what you‚Äôd expect. It was like the whale shark. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/0LA6rnVGgG
Overall, the Cretaceous was a greenhouse climate compared to today. The oceans were probably a bit warmer. #takeoverNSF
There were pterosaurs in the sky and hadrosaurs on the shore, and then T. Rex and Triceratops around at this time. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/2E5q7fhj6p
You had several different species of birds, and they actually had teeth. #takeoverNSF
The Cretaceous was an interesting time. You had mosasaurs, these giant marine reptiles (some the size of a school bus). You also had giant turtles the size of Volkswagen Bugs. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/83lIS9p3DS
With Ptychodus, you can sometimes find a whole palate of these nubby teeth preserved. That gives you a very nice idea of the size of the head, because you get an idea of the size of the whole upper or lower jaw. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/ZUQgzdVzst
This is really rare, but you can also sometimes get impressions of skin, spines, and in some cases an outline of a whole body. #takeoverNSF
The majority of evidence left by #sharks, because they have no bones, is teeth. If you have fairly good preservation, you can also get vertebrae that can sometimes be preserved.  #takeoverNSF https://t.co/fmMqGQIgwP
You also had sharks that were more like rays ‚Äì the Ptychodus, which grew to 36 feet, had teeth that looked like knuckles üëáüèΩand they primarily ate shellfish. They scavenged the bottom of the ocean. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/yUBbpullSg
The Cretaceous is the very first time that you had serrated teeth show up in the #fossil record for sharks that were scavenging food and tearing it as opposed to just gulping it down. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/3W6auAtH9d
There were relatives of great white #sharks available in the Cretaceous that look very much like modern great white sharks, although a little bigger ‚Äì Cretoxyrhina, for example, was a very charismatic #shark. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/YQ0aEss0Zp
That long cylindrical body with a pointy nose and pointy fins and big teeth was well established by the Cretaceous. #takeoverNSF
Shark evolution started hundreds of millions of years before the Cretaceous. Cretaceous #sharks would have the basic body plans, the morphology, of modern sharks. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/9aMAhe8uqT
This are hundreds of years of found specimens. It‚Äôs data that‚Äôs already paid for. It‚Äôs just a matter of making it accessible. #takeoverNSF
A resource like this is extremely important to researchers. It‚Äôs very hard to find specimens, and even when you go out and look, you‚Äôre not guaranteed to find any. https://t.co/WOsWd6BxYf #takeoverNSF #fossils

RT @DeepMicrobe: Check out this awesome talk by  @archaearama on these weird microbes - https://t.co/lBtS9oWsts https://t.co/wnYqaZoaZz
Thanks for having us today! If you want to learn more about #microbes in the #ocean and @deepbiosphere, please follow us at @DeepMicrobe of @BigelowLab and @JulesDeep @whoi to learn much more about our amazing oceans.  #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/tcq3Oa9DA9
[BO] Somehow, without sunlight, without oxygen, without obvious sources of food, microscopic life forms manage to exist below the #seafloor. #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay
[BO] @deepbiosphere scientists have found no limit to microbial life in the deep sediment of the #ocean‚Äôs ‚Äúdeadest‚Äù region, with little carbon or energy. How do they do it? https://t.co/XlzCQ1YhSd #takeoverNSF https://t.co/LOyyVXpwWj
[BO] A giant group of #octopus moms was discovered in the #deepsea by @deepbiosphere scientists looking for new sites of hydrothermal venting. https://t.co/DJNsoAQ1yS #takeoverNSF #ICYMI https://t.co/532zTnnGez
[JH] Microbes beneath the seafloor in fluids under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ‚Äúchow down‚Äù on #carbon https://t.co/OGxlQkF4Kk #takeoverNSF https://t.co/bi8ube7Bh1
[BO] Microbes can eat the iron in the rocks of the #ocean crust. That activity can change the #chemistry of the oceans! #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/nQjgr4gxjW
[BO] Even 7 miles beneath the surface in the deepest part of the #ocean of the Mariana trench, microbial life survives in sediments! @deepbiosphere scientists like @subsurface_life &amp; @rleonzay are learning how through #DNA sequencing https://t.co/dqLy89duO3 #takeoverNSF
[BO] Did you know that microscopic life found on the #seafloor can help us for the search for life in outer space? Mud at the bottom of the ocean has the second largest reservoir of water on #Earth. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/yXJkDznxDz
[JH] 70% of volcanism on #Earth occurs in the ocean and even when #volcanoes erupt, microbes can feast on the energy sources released in those fluids!  https://t.co/wF85ZetD59 #takeoverNSF https://t.co/Ex4yzV4195
290,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 microbes‚Äî one of the largest habitats on Earth! #takeoverNSF
[JH] About one trillion bacteria can fit on the head of pin. How many microbes do you think are at the bottom of the ocean? #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/s6KZz2Sets
[JH] Microbes have been found more than 1 kilometer below the seafloor. @deepbiosphere scientists have traveled around the globe in search of the limit to how far life reaches into the Earth. https://t.co/wDjrhHLWFN #takeoverNSF
[JH] There are tons of microscopic organisms, aka microbes, living below the seafloor. #NSFfunded C-DEBI @deepbiosphere scientists go on voyages with @IODP to drill holes into the seafloor to find them. #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/QZDCYyJbWG

[JH] Did you know that water moves UNDER the seafloor? @deepbiosphere scientists use tracers to follow the water. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/dy2AK5vloD
[JH] In many places in the #deepsea, animal life would not be possible without microbes. https://t.co/Oh1othmdkV #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay https://t.co/D6Siu2oId1
[JH] Scientists use biology, chemistry, physics &amp; engineering to study microbes in the #ocean. PLUS we get to adventure into the #ocean &amp; explore our planet! Check out this video w/ Beth @deepmicrobe to see what that looks like https://t.co/7RFyqT1rf0 #takeoverNSF #WorldOceansDay

Ultralightweight magnesium and aluminum alloys will eventually replace heavier steel parts in the transportation sector leading to more efficient travel. #takeoverNSF #Hulk https://t.co/07kkPAEOW6

#Basicresearch into materials science and engineering make objects like this possible. https://t.co/XzTBKjuB7i #takeoverNSF
Those ‚Äúmemory metal‚Äù eyeglass frames you may be wearing?

91 of the 118 known elements on the periodic table are metals. If a ‚Äúnew‚Äù metallic element was brought into existence, it would: (a) likely be unstable, (b) be VERY heavy, (c) be radioactive (sorry‚Ä¶ not Hulk-making radiation) #takeoverNSF #vibranium https://t.co/RGfXi6fJyT

One of our #NRAO Jansky Fellows, @NRAO scientist Kunal Mooley says that the gradual brightening of the radio signal indicates we are seeing a wide-angle outflow of material that is traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light. #takeoverNSF #STEM https://t.co/SKbP4ZiVTG
@WheresMooMoo @NSF_MPS Both LIGO and VIRGO systems detected the gravitational waves.  Fortunately, the overlap of the possible sky positions from each system was small in this case, allowing rapid identification of the likely source. #takeoverNSF
Scientists are calling this "multi-messenger" astronomy, considering the different types of waves to be different "messengers," each bring unique information. #takeoverNSF
@GhostfaceKHZ When a star‚Äôs core implodes, the bulk of the star‚Äôs material is crushed inside so tightly that atoms cease to be atoms- their orbiting electrons smash onto their central protons to become neutrons &amp; then smash on past that to become, well, honestly, we don‚Äôt know #takeoverNSF
@GhostfaceKHZ A stellar black hole is actually the superdense remains of a very big star that imploded, violently collapsing in on itself, during a supernova. (1/2) #takeoverNSF
Those two types of waves provided different information about the merger, giving us a more complete picture of what happened than we would have gotten with only one type of wave. #takeoverNSF #scicomm
#Gravitationalwaves are ripples or distortions in the fabric of space-time caused by extremely violent cosmic events. Electromagnetic waves are oscillating, electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. #takeoverNSF #SciFest #SciFestNSF https://t.co/E2dBWxpYVQ
It‚Äôs the first time any astronomical object had been seen with both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves. #takeoverNSF
The gravitational waves were followed by outbursts of gamma rays, X-rays, and visible light from the event. The #VLA detected the first radio waves on September 2, 2017. #takeoverNSF
The gravitational waves were followed by outbursts of gamma rays, X-rays, &amp; visible light from the event. The #VLA detected the first radio waves on September 2, 2017. #takeoverNSF
It was the first confirmed detection of such a merger and only the fifth direct detection ever of gravitational waves, predicted more than a century ago by Albert Einstein. #takeoverNSF #scicomm
On August 17, 2017, #NSFfunded @LIGO and @VIRGO gravitational wave observatories combined to pinpoint the faint ripples in space-time caused by the merger of two superdense neutron stars. #takeoverNSF #SciFest #SciFestNSF https://t.co/9ONWAvClpz
What holds them together? Unlike most everyday matter which is held together by electromagnetic forces, neutron stars are held together by their immense #gravity.   #takeoverNSF
A neutron star radius is only around 10km, so the #Earth scale equivalent would be a hill that is only 2.5m tall. #takeoverNSF
Another neat fact about neutron #stars is that they are incredibly smooth. Their immense gravity keep surface irregularities to only a few mm in height before they break apart.  #takeoverNSF https://t.co/4mWv3Kx8Nl
The immense pressure involved in the core collapse of a neutron star is astounding. The entirety of humanity could be compressed down to a sugar cube-sized piece of #neutronstar material. #resistancewouldbefutile #takeoverNSF https://t.co/TjKbubdf1x
Neutron stars are made almost entirely of neutrons and crushed together by gravity #takeoverNSF
The rapidly spinning disk generated a pair of narrow, superfast jets of material that flow outward from its poles. #takeoverNSF
Radio ‚Äúeyes‚Äù unlock the secrets of colliding neutron stars. When a pair of superdense neutron stars collided they may have formed a black hole in a galaxy 130 million light-years from Earth. #takeoverNSF

[DS] There is nothing like getting hands-on experience, so seek out research opportunities wherever you can find them. It helps narrow down what you are most interested in, and you will pick up valuable skills along the way. #takeoverNSF #STEM
@margagual Thanks for following! #takeoverNSF
[DS] If young people are interested in doing this kind of work, science and math classes are key. So is learning to write clearly. #takeoverNSF #WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/XHbzygHfvU
[DJ] Humpback whale feeding rates are greatest when their prey ‚Äì krill - is shallowest, &amp; feeding rates decrease with increasing dive depth. This strategy is consistent w/ theories &amp; previous models of how air-breathing diving animals optimize foraging efficiency. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/eDPLh2Yz2T
[DJ] There is considerable overlap between humpback whale foraging regions and krill fishery catch effort. Understanding these overlaps can help solve conflicts with the fishery if they arise. #takeoverNSF
[DJ] The skin of humpback whales sampled by the #PalmerLTER has a very different community of microbes on it than in other places of the world. This community ‚Äì often referred to as a microbiome ‚Äì also appears to change from summer to fall. #takeoverNSF
[DJ] Humpback whales and minke #whales have very different movement and foraging patterns associated with ice conditions. Minke whales appear to forage close to sea ice and under it, whereas humpback whales forage in more open waters. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/0iqVddZC75
@DoodlebugKRY [HD] My first reaction is that people find it hard to understand that what happens in Antarctica affects the whole planet. It‚Äôs such a remote place, but it‚Äôs integral to how ocean circulation works.  #takeoverNSF
[DJ] The long-distance migrations of humpback #whales are amazing. Satellite tagging studies have shown that many feed near the Western Antarctic Peninsula during the austral summer, then migrate over 7,000 km to breeding grounds in the Gulf of Panama for the winter. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/tBUTipZL8G
minke*
[DJ] Researchers use photography, satellite tags, video tags, hydrophones, drones and biopsy samples to whale biology and ecology, their movements, foraging and feeding, population biology, reproductive biology, and body size and condition. #takeoverNSF #DroneAntartica https://t.co/GbI7cFoD6V
[DJ] Whales are important animals to study because most species were depleted by commercial whaling, and many are now recovering. #PalmerLTER wants to understand the ecological roles of recovering whale populations, and how climate shapes these roles. #takeoverNSF
[DJ] They feed on krill. Penguins and seals also are an important part of the ecosystem. Killer whales and leopard seals are the apex predators. #takeoverNSF
@girlpathologist @VIMS_News Zooplankton do ultimately link to people, as zooplankton feed the fish that feed people all over our planet. #takeoverNSF
[DJ] At the other end of the food web are humpback and mince whales are amongst the largest which are important predators in the marine ecosystem. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/wm38GRbBRb
[DS] Sinking of krill poop is an important way in which organic matter is exported to the deep #ocean. #takeoverNSF üëáactual krill poopüëá https://t.co/I7F9J5DXxG
[DS] Scientists have found out that the amount of phytoplankton affects yearly differences in abundance of for some species zooplankton, while in other species the extent of sea ice cover is important. #takeoverNSF
[DS] Researchers tow fine mesh nets behind boats and ships to collect zooplankton. They use microscopes to identify &amp; count them &amp; they measure their feeding &amp; metabolic rates. One challenge is to keep the small &amp; often delicate animals in good shape for observation #takeoverNSF https://t.co/0Cd6KCrtYi
[DS] All zooplankton are important nutrient recyclers and they are mostly at the mercy of the ocean currents‚Äì zooplankton literally means ‚Äúanimal drifter‚Äù ‚Äìas opposed to whales and fish that can swim against a current. #takeoverNSF
[DS] I study zooplankton, animals at the bottom of the food chain: many are only about the size of a grain of rice, krill are shrimp sized. All are a link between the phytoplankton- microscopic plants‚Äîand higher predators, penguins, fish, whales. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/02w5WjV83B
[DS] The #PalmerLTER has a handle on what species are there, and partly why one species is more abundant in a given year or region than another. But much to be learned about how species distributions will change as oceans warm.  #takeoverNSF #Antarctica https://t.co/FXTNxuzPNV
[HD] #Antarctic ecosystems are relatively simple compared to other systems at lower latitudes, and because the changes there are large and rapid, scientists can understand the rules of ecosystem change more easily. #takeoverNSF
@DoodlebugKRY @Columbia @DukeU @VIMS_News @MarineUAS Great to have you here! #takeoverNSF
[HD] Researchers with the #PalmerLTER share information with the McMurdo Dry Valleys LTER and have found they both harbor ecosystems that are responding to some of the same climate variations and in similar ways. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/DkRTjfvZ9E

[ID] Ideas don‚Äôt occur to just one person. They occur to a community. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here taking over @NSF Twitter! To get new ideas. The U.S. is really full of people who care about these emerging technologies. #takeoverNSF
But we don‚Äôt have a crystal ball. The most exciting projects are the ones that completely surprise you. So we try to encourage a diversity of ideas and let the best ones have a shot. #takeoverNSF #TuesdayThoughts
[JB] In our research programs we want to see everything. We don‚Äôt want to get stuck on just one vision of the future. I‚Äôm as susceptible to the lure of the Tricorder as anyone. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/kq0xblVecV
The beauty of fundamental #research is that we get ideas with different solutions to the same problem. And when you look 20, 50 years out, you don‚Äôt know which one is gonna be the answer. We welcome that debate. What do others think? #takeoverNSF
[ID] #Robots allow us to do more with less energy quicker. Right now the focus is on separate tasks, but I think it will eventually all come together to change our environment. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/NcjWJr0Lp8
Its intelligence could be spread across a flock of robo-birds. It could be a car that drives itself. It could be a tiny nanobot floating in your bloodstream, making you feel 20 years younger. #takeoverNSF
[JB] One robot #myth I‚Äôd like to change is that robots look like metal people. People have to do lots of different things with their bodies. A robot can be specialized to do one thing. It‚Äôll be shaped however it needs to be. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/4R3PTeJ3Ww
[ID] Soft #robots are definitely a part of that. The idea of a soft robot is you don‚Äôt have to be too super careful around people. Because if the thing clunks you, you‚Äôre not dead. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/egPf9PtMNJ
[JB] When people hear ‚Äúcyborg,‚Äù they might think of The #Terminator, but for a while anyway a cyborg will be more like a robot-augmented version of yourself. #Exoskeletons help people accomplish tasks in new ways. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/aimySadLZn
A fly can figure out what‚Äôs lunch, but can it figure out if a person is badly hurt? So then we‚Äôre trying to do something nature doesn‚Äôt do. There‚Äôs no example anymore. #takeoverNSF
[JB] A lot of #engineers look at nature for ‚Äúproofs of existence‚Äù ‚Äì we know something this small can fly autonomously because insects do it. But maybe flies can‚Äôt do what want a search &amp; rescue robo-fly to do. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/URGyv9E2qI
For example, Stickybot has feet covered with gecko-inspired, directional-adhesive material that allows it to climb smooth surfaces. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/inT2UnItjg
[JB] That‚Äôs the fun part of the future. We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs really going to look like, right? We use nature to inspire robotics but we don‚Äôt really know. #takeoverNSF #TuesdayThoughts
[ID] You don‚Äôt want to have to put out special refueling stops. You want it to harvest chemical energy from its environment. And it doesn‚Äôt have to even look like an ant or a fly or a bee üêù. We don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôll look like. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/sk2zfhfe26
[JB] One challenge: How to power them. So, how do you get energy from your environment? Eat it. That‚Äôs what real insects do. Any guesses as to what a robo-ant might eat to power itself? #takeoverNSF https://t.co/MkotXCClRJ
[ID] Robot termites! [JB] Absolutely, yes. Any other ideas out there? #takeoverNSF https://t.co/YTvAhmaOiB
[JB] It‚Äôs very hard to predict what tech will look like. They might not look like a flying robo-ant. They may look like flying ‚Ä¶  #takeoverNSF
[JB] This is a pic of tech 50 yrs from now -- or, at least, it's a projection of how some of the projects that we support now may combine in 20-50 yrs. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/hbtwGq2w4N

@MontereyAq @MBARI_News Ppl had wondered what would eat a hagfish. A #citsci, spotted an elephant seal eating 1 on vid at almost 900 meters depth. üòÆ #takeoverNSF
@MontereyAq @MBARI_News They feed on carcasses that fall to the sea floor. They swarm all over carcasses of fish and whales. #takeoverNSF https://t.co/gxvizmaO53
@MontereyAq @MBARI_News They can also tie themselves in a knot, then work the knot down through their tails ‚Äì it‚Äôs how they can get out of their slime #takeoverNSF
@keithsunderlan3 @MontereyAq @MBARI_News Researchers have seen them feeding by sucking the fluids out of creatures like corals and anemones.
@MontereyAq @MBARI_News If you have a 5-gallon bucket with a startled hagfish in it, you‚Äôll have 5 gallons of slime. #takeoverNSF

@MontereyAq @MBARI_News ‚Ä¶but these are animals that have moved away from that herbivorous lifestyle &amp; they‚Äôre carnivores. That‚Äôs very interesting. #takeoverNSF
