It's not surprising he's silent as thousands of people try to make their way into our country illegally.
Phil Bredesen is too liberal to protect Tennessee families and uphold the rule of law, and if he‚Äôs elected to the U.S. Senate, he‚Äôll help bring sanctuary cities to Tennessee because he‚Äôll vote with Chuck Schumer and the 'abolish ICE' open border Democrats.
He opposes President Trump's travel ban and thinks building the wall is 'political theater.'
My opponent doesn't even think that immigration is a 'top ten' issue.  If Phil Bredesen had his way, he would be at the border, handing them all state-issued, taxpayer-funded drivers' certificates. He probably thinks they ought to use those certificates to vote too.

A vote for Phil Bredesen is a vote to take the HELP committee gavel away from @LamarAlexander and give it to Sen. Murray who supports government run, single-payer healthcare.

Last year, the Senate failed on its promise to the American people when it refused to repeal Obamacare in its entirety. Marsha remains committed to returning healthcare to a patient-centered system so we can use solutions that work.
To reform healthcare we need to:	- Expand health savings accounts	- Broaden association health plans	- Allow Americans to purchase healthcare across state lines
Obamacare doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs driving up the cost of health insurance for Tennesseans and forcing many of them to pay a penalty. Marsha‚Äôs committed to increasing access to AFFORDABLE healthcare for Tennesseans.

And Chuck Schumer, who has bought and paid for Phil Bredesen‚Äôs campaign, won‚Äôt let him support Judge Kavanaugh.  Eighty-five days is more than enough, Phil Bredesen should be honest with Tennesseans - that's what leaders do. #ConfirmKavanaugh
He won‚Äôt tell Tennesseans how he‚Äôd vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination because his past record of shredding evidence of sexual harassment is too shameful and embarrassing to take a stand.
Tennesseans are very clear: they want their next senator to confirm good constitutionalist judges and justices, and they support Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Phil Bredesen, under Chuck Schumer's direction, has stayed neutral as long as he can.

Marsha wants to reform healthcare by 	- Expanding health savings accounts	- Broadening association health plans	- Allowing Americans to purchase healthcare across state lines
Tennessee is already bearing the brunt of Obamacare. Health care premiums in Tennesseans have risen by 277 percent. Now Bredesen wants to raise taxes by 19% on middle class families to take Obamacare even further? Our state can‚Äôt afford Phil‚Äôs socialist health care plans.
‚ÄúSingle-payer, the federal government collecting the money and then turning it over, I mean that‚Äôs what I think actually we should do.‚Äù - Phil Bredesen https://t.co/GFqbkc5TWi
Marsha knows that Obamacare doesn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs costing Tennesseans their hard-earned dollars by driving up the cost of health insurance and forcing many of them to pay a penalty. She‚Äôs committed to increasing access to AFFORDABLE healthcare for Tennesseans.
Marsha has never shied away from challenging the status quo to do the right thing for Tennessee. The state income tax battle is a perfect example: she led that fight &amp; Tennesseans from all 95 counties joined her. #StandwithMarsha https://t.co/WubETNZyfC
As a wife and mother, Marsha knows that extra money at the end of the month means families don‚Äôt have to choose between new clothes and paying bills.
The tax cuts were not ‚Äúcrumbs‚Äù for Tennesseans. They were water heaters, savings for college or even rainy day funds.
RT @RonRamsey: As the #TNSenateDebate begins, make clear you #StandWithMarsha. Let's  send Marsha to the U.S. Senate to fight for Tennessee‚Ä¶
Marsha knows that the #TaxCuts were not ‚Äúcrumbs.‚Äù Rather, they were a solution that has yielded tremendous economic impacts for families across Tennessee.
While Phil Bredesen is trying to convince Tennesseans that he will be a ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Democrat in the Senate, Tennesseans know the truth: he‚Äôs bought and paid for by Chuck Schumer. #SchumersPuppet https://t.co/nfkh2Jpb4E
Phil Bredesen criticized last years‚Äô tax cut benefits, calling them ‚Äúcrumbs,‚Äù but Marsha knows that an additional $1,700 a month is real money for Tennesseans.
Phil Bredesen said he would have opposed last year‚Äôs historic tax reform. He criticized its benefits, calling them ‚Äúcrumbs,‚Äù just like Nancy Pelosi and Cory Booker. https://t.co/al4QNT23u5
Marsha Blackburn is a committed fiscal conservative. Beginning with her time as a State Senator, where she led the opposition to the state income tax to her time in the House, she has been a deficit hawk, and she‚Äôll take that same commitment to the U.S. Senate.
Marsha has three immediate priorities for restoring fiscal sanity:		‚òëÔ∏èPass a Balanced Budget amendment	‚òëÔ∏èReduce federal spending across the board and reform entitlements	‚òëÔ∏èMake #TaxCuts Permanent
