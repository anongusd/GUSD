@sarahbellumd There is a bizarro old Sarah in Orlando. Just FYI.

@itsonlywords What I was getting at is the the internet has allowed everyone to find their own "facts."
@itsonlywords Welcome to the internet. Sigh. It's all lies.
@itsonlywords Conservatives whined about how much the press liked Obama for nearly a decade. The result was that he was never challenged.
@itsonlywords They're not supposed to be a team. I don't get why people are all anxious about this.
Why are we confused when the media refuses to kiss the ring of our politicians? That's the way it was designed.
I have no problem with a hostile media, tbh. Ask hard questions. Dig deeper. I wish this would have been going on all along.

@kreal Real freedom doesn't come from reparations and rights are not something given to you, they are something you have and should protect.
@kreal Sorry, that's the wrong approach. The answer is not "give us stuff."
@kreal What kind of action do you propose?
@kreal That's bullshit and a ridiculously broad stroke. What you just said to me is racist in it's own way. You're not helping.
@kreal But that doesn't mean looting and rioting or tear gassing people. I refuse to believe that those are the options. We aren't animals.
@kreal ... media. We have a chance to have a real conversation right now, and its being overshadowed by looting and police incompetence.
@kreal ... ignore that, but the response is ineffective. It's heartbreaking to watch people weave their agendas because they've got the...
@kreal See, that's just an ignorant approach. Why this hill to die on? Black men are murdered all the time. I'm not saying that we should...
So anyway. &lt;/rant&gt;
Right now, I pray that this remains an isolated incident. If anything, it's shown me how quickly we dissolve into chaos.
What the hell did they think was going to happen? When you train groups of people to blame each other for their misfortune, they'll act out.
There are a lot of "activists" and race baiters and people in high elected office that been stoking these fires for a long time.
The only thing that I know right now is that tensions are so high, every bullet has the potential to start a riot and that's terrifying.
I feel like most people have no idea what they're talking about and it's become a platform for people to push whatever agenda they can.
So, I've intentionally been really quiet on the Ferguson stuff, mainly because we've been so slow to get info.

@techsavvy79 @TopSouthern Calling tampons a "whiny progressive thing" is ridiculously ignorant. Women need them.
@Gavin0503 I wasn't political in college so I didn't care. We haven't been friends in years.
These leftists live in such a state of perpetual childhood. There is no concept of where free stuff actually comes from. It's astounding.
I actually had a friend in college who argued that tampons should be subsidized. Where do you draw the line?
@TopSouthern Which is exactly what I said. But putting it in the category of "whiny progressive things" is ridiculously ignorant.
@TopSouthern Uh, tampons don't exactly fall into that category. They're sort of a necessity.

It is not a matter of rooting for failure. This is a matter of "I told you so." They spent years of our time, and trillions of our dollars.
The word glitch can no longer apply to the Obamacare rollout. It is an abject failure. Period.
Glitch (n.): A minor malfunction, mishap, or technical problem. If the problem goes on for A FLIPPING MONTH it is not a "minor malfunction."

The real tragedy is that we're so bloated that we have this many non-essential workers. That is the fault of the people in charge.

@jaseliberty I couldn't have even told you what sport it was. So not into it. :)
@VodkaPundit Just Irish up your coffee. It'll help.
