(4/8) On March 6, 2014, the shooter applied to purchase a handgun from a local gun dealer in Aurora and PASSED a background check. On March 11, 2014, after waiting the 72 hours required by #Illinois, the shooter took possession of the handgun. #facts
(3/8) In January of 2014, the prohibited shooter was issued a firearms license (Firearm Owner‚Äôs Identification Card - FOID) by the state of #Illinois. #facts
