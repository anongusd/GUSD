@LaPurpleReign @LamarWhiteJr But u seem to give @DocAbraham a pass over abruptly changing his campaign promise. When did a campaign promise end at a term. A Pro Life campaign promise, a no new tax campaign promise, a pro Israel campaign promise. Is it not in perpetuity up and till u tell ur flock u pivoted?
