@HacksawBuggin @latinarants @LiteScott @AriFleischer Infants didn't have rocks, neither did the journalist that was killed or the 2 medics. Did you also try &amp; justify National guards, when they shot college students?
@latinarants @HacksawBuggin @LiteScott @AriFleischer That's a lie, as you know they also killed a journalist &amp; 2 medics.
@NancyKimbell @gabrielroth You've been misinformed. The Palestinians have no such charter. Hamas is the political party in Gaza, they're platform &amp; Constitution is on line)
@latinarants @HacksawBuggin @LiteScott @AriFleischer Small rocks in their hands doesn't warrent a sniper with a scoped rifle to kill them at 1/4 mile away.
@HacksawBuggin @latinarants @LiteScott @AriFleischer Your comment is a total lie.
@mehixter2 @latinarants @AriFleischer They meaning the IDF. You're right. The Israelis killed over 200 US servicemen in 1967 (USS Liberty) &amp; 90 British soldiers, when they bombed The King David Hotel.
@Nickarama1 @latinarants @AriFleischer Nice fake meme. Why do you use memes to get your information?
@RealGuitar7 @latinarants @AriFleischer There were no bombs, except the ones the Israeli drones dropped.
@Philassie @latinarants @AriFleischer 61 dead (7 of which were children), 2,767 wounded. Indeed Israel regularly kills unarmed Palestinians. They use the term "mowing the lawn".
@DesmondEgan1 @latinarants @AriFleischer That's a lie. No Palestinian had explosives.
@HacksawBuggin @latinarants @LiteScott @AriFleischer Absolutely false.
