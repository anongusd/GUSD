@Acosta Don't be a dolt. Did you expect a welcome from the real illegals? They are hiding! In Phoenix, the children play a game called "La Migra." One person is the immigration office who calls out "La Migra" while the other children run and hide. It is a game!
@DineshDSouza @WilliamDarrah8 @realDonaldTrump @acosta Did you actually expect the #Illegals to be out welcoming you? Here in #Phoenix, the children play a game called "La Migra." Like hide and go seek, one person yells out, "La Migra," and the other children run and hide while "La Migra" looks for them. It is all a big game.
