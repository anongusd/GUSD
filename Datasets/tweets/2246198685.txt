@affiliatecurve @tictoc @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Mueller hasn’t alleged that Trump conspired with Russia to impact the election. Other focuses of Mueller’s investigation — such as potential obstruction of justiceby the Trump administration — have also not resulted in any indictments.
@affiliatecurve @tictoc @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump He said no such thing. Not on the clip I posted. He said he didnt have reason not to believe either party. This means further investigation. 		Post a clip of him saying he trusted Russia over our intel. That's plain and simple truth. Proceed with caution until reason is proven.

@affiliatecurve @tictoc @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Trump claims credit for shutting down the government. With the Democrats refusal to discuss border security funding, they now own its continuance. When has Trump lied? What has he done to be a traitor? Let's look a those claims and sort this out, find facts to back them.
@tictoc @SenSchumer Democrat theology is to accuse others of the very thing they are guilty of. This is a perfect example. Border security needs funded. Stand firm @realDonaldTrump. Get the funding and secure our southern border.
RT @GOP: THIS IS IMMORAL — RT if you AGREE! https://t.co/xjlkoPKxHB
@SenSchumer @SenatorCarper @realDonaldTrump He takes the credit for shutting down government, it's up to you to open it. Fund border security and you'll get the ball rolling to reopen government. Mr. Schumer, why are you against border security?
@No1RealWolfy @loramurns @sdsu04life @ABC @KennieBassWCHS Tear gas was used by American border protection officials before. Tear gas has been fired near the southern border with Mexico at least 126 times since 2012, according to data shared by Customs and Border Protection, meaning these incidents go back well into Obamas administration

Was this done? You cant just come and say, I WANT ASYLUM when you get here
@DaveManGB @KMAKJ11 @sdsu04life @ABC @KennieBassWCHS 300k taken from 2018 Border Patrol reports. Your percentages are made up. Facts are peculiar things. The report goes on to say the majority are OTM, meaning Other Than Mexican. The chart taken from https://t.co/RJYEwlICW8 show the lbs of drugs captured at each border. https://t.co/ZysONzEdmO
@No1RealWolfy @loramurns @sdsu04life @ABC @KennieBassWCHS It is not illegal to protect your border, it a right. Mexico has been accomidating, offering citizenship and they refused. Mexico needs to keep their immigrants at bay, ie. Stay a distance from border until this calms down. With Trump, we will protect our border!
@DaveManGB @KMAKJ11 @sdsu04life @ABC @KennieBassWCHS The security of our nation that concerns me. There are twelve countries south of Mexico sending drugs, human trafficing, and entering illegally. Over 300,000 arrests in 2018. The northern border only had a little over 3,000. What about open borders is appealing to you?
@RepJohnLarson So you voted for funding border security?
@sdsu04life @KMAKJ11 @DaveManGB @ABC @KennieBassWCHS Just my point, if you can get around the existing barrier, it needs upgraded to the new design. What areas of the current immigration system would you make better?
@sdsu04life @KMAKJ11 @DaveManGB @ABC @KennieBassWCHS Mexico offered to give asylum, why would they not accept?

@KMAKJ11 @DaveManGB @sdsu04life @ABC @KennieBassWCHS There are areas of the border that drastically need upgrades. This may be one of those areas. If a wall is not a good solution for you and your not for open borders, what is your solution?

@Stormcloud2000 @realDonaldTrump Watch!	https://t.co/zNQ5wT1L1r		I'm pretty sure the majority of Americans want a barrier securing our southern border. Made up statistics are meaningless.		The shutdown expresses the urgency of border security and the need to negotiate a solution. Dems refuse even discuss it.
@janschakowsky @HouseDemocrats Border security needs to be the top priority. Drugs, human trafficing, illegal aliens, and foreign caravans believing they can enter are all major problems that a barrier would stop. Would you please explain to me why an open border keeps our nation safe?
@KenCalvert If Trump had the cure for cancer and wanted to give it away, liberals would be against it simply because @RealDonaldTrump is not a part of their global liberal socialist agenda. Simply put, it doesnt matter what @RealDonaldTrump does, the Democrats will oppose him.

@ABC @KennieBassWCHS Some areas of the border the barrier is inadequate and will need to be rebuilt to a standard that the rest of the new barrier will be built. Why are you against border protection? What are the advantages of open borders?	What should be the process for legal entry?
@janschakowsky @realDonaldTrump We the people want border security, a barrier is needed on our southern border to prevent drugs, illegal aliens, human trafficing and etc. Fund border security
@ABC @KennieBassWCHS Glad to see the border patrol using the tools provided to them to keep our border safe. All the more reason a barrier is needed between us and Mexico. Congress needs to fund the building of this barrier.

@SenBobCasey Need to build the wall! Keep the illegals out, they're not migrants, they're illegal aliens. For a parent to put a child in such a dangerous position by illegally crossing the border should be criminal and auto deport. 1st time No Asylum, 2nd time No legal entry, 3rd lifetime ban
