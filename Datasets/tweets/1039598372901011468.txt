It's time for a new approach to lobbying and public affairs. Please check out our new video that explains UBI’s DATA DRIVEN approach to turning gridlock into legislative success. View video here: https://t.co/6STrEY9V17
Momentum builds for the GAIIN Act, which has CBC and Freedom Caucus support. UBI thanks @JobCreatorsUSA for highlighting the bipartisan co-sponsors of GAIIN @LacyClayMO1 @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepWilson @MikeKellyPA @RepTedBudd @WarrenDavidson @RepAlexMooney https://t.co/wrW6sxRyOJ
@rollcall ‘People to Watch In 2019’ article featuring UBI partner, Mike Williams where he highlighted our innovative business plan “If you can get those three disparate caucuses to work together, you can get a majority in the House, at a minimum.” https://t.co/3KVwsrDUDf
Check out our analysis on the makeup of the 116th Congress. The most diverse Congress in history demands new strategies. https://t.co/sSsl9YzlT4
"Diversity remains an unfulfilled promised in a variety of elite industries, including tech &amp; finance as well as at big media companies like The New York Times." To read more, check out @noamscheiber &amp; @jeligon article in @nytimes https://t.co/slA6jhunhy
Congrats @SenatorTimScott, diversity in leadership on Capitol Hill matters. Scott has one of the most diverse staffs, he is one of two senators with a black chief of staff and his aides are from many different nationalities and an array of ideologies https://t.co/TfwS513KZ2
The two institutions tasked with explaining Congress to the outside world look nothing like the members they cover. In a survey done last year by the American Society of News Editors, they found 83% of the workforce at the country’s daily print and online media outlets were white
@UBI__dc recently conducted an analysis of @thehill list of Top Lobbyists in 2018 that highlighted the staggering need for firms like ours, of 409 lobbyists only 10.7% (44/409) were minorities. https://t.co/7Qv3Dhgl99
Check out @theodoricmeyer @politico article covering the @UBI__dc Welcome Back Reception last night "SPOTTED: At a party held by United by Interest... according to a PI tipster: @LacyClayMO1 , @Jim_Jordan @WarrenDavidson and @RepTedBudd" https://t.co/d3VzwKDhy7 https://t.co/EQOPrY52ln
Check out @ReedSusanE article in the @washingtonpost on how companies use women and minorities as a window dressing. "In fact, the board frequently serves as a smokescreen to conceal just how white a company’s leaders (the CEO and his team) are." https://t.co/stIKu0lfwV
Congratulations to Fabrice Coles, a top aide to the @OfficialCBC, for joining @bankpolicy as Vice President of Government Affairs. @bankpolicy serves the interest of bank customers, bringing the best innovative ideas to the banking industry @bpolitics https://t.co/czL73CUlmx

Labes = Perspectives. Perspectives matter because people matter so #LabelsMatter @samstein @lachlan @thedailybeast https://t.co/fyURPqQUUu
UBI would like to be one of the first to congratulate @RepJeffries on his election to Democratic Caucus chairman. @heatherscope @BresPolitico https://t.co/qXgfT0ti30
Google trend analysis shows white men &amp; women hugely overrepresented in newsrooms. K Street has same problem. @UBI_DC was formed to bridge this divide with diverse perspectives &amp; united strategies that reflect diversity in Congress. https://t.co/xvcUP9Knu9 https://t.co/WC0RupWOPN
For those questioning whether Dems and Republicans can work together on infrastructure - they already are. The GAIIN Act endorsed by @GOPLeader and cosponsored by CBC and Conservatives @pkcapitol @washingtonpost @DomenicoNPR https://t.co/lbqztC1yKe https://t.co/Ks4bGGxoh3
@UBI_dc partner Mike Williams on Washington's anti-PAC movement “It does put a premium on personal contributions, even from a corporate lobbyist perspective". Click below to read @kackleyZ whole article on @RollCall https://t.co/1lT3LBoHXv
Narrow and increasingly diverse Dem majority + shrinking yet more conservative GOP minority = new plan. We are the first minority-majority owned bipartisan firm in Washington #WeRespectTheStats https://t.co/a1kU90OR17 https://t.co/POlAaQsBAV @MZanona
Is your Gov Affairs team ready for this new power dynamic? UBI is. We are built on diversity and meaningful relationships with Tri-Caucus as well as conservatives who are ascendant in the GOP. https://t.co/BdN96d2k3q https://t.co/J5rDmQSh1R
Moderate white men &amp; women have an outsized voice in Washington's media &amp; lobbying sectors. The bases of both parties got stronger in 18. @OfficialCBC, @HispanicCaucus, @freedomcaucus, @RepublicanStudy. Business (and media) need a new plan. UBI has one. https://t.co/UPzUgsppXo https://t.co/BGRMAt5SU2
Business should be looking for K St firms that reflect this dynamic. UBI is the first and only bipartisan majority-minority owned lobbying and public affairs firm in DC. @MarcusMaceMason @rodell @jarviscstewart @paulbrathwaite https://t.co/Kk8G2FKpfX https://t.co/ycDEaBZx0O
UBI congratulates the diverse co-sponsors of the GAIIN Act for winning last night. Not many bills unite the base of both parties. There's more common ground when you think differently. @MikeKellyPA @LacyClayMO1 @RepTedBudd @RepWilson @RepAlexMooney @JacksonLeeTX18 @WarrenDavidson
UBI is proud to roll out our new website, https://t.co/6STrEY9V17, designed and built by small business entrepreneur Dionna Dorsey. Thank you @dionnadorsey! https://t.co/sLI7F1Gkif
GAIIN Act gains momentum with @GOPLeader endorsement. "The GAIIN Act is an example of an alternative solution that deserves consideration to achieve...better American infrastructure in our communities most in need.” https://t.co/u7xKtByTT0 @pkcapitol @NeilBradleyDC
Be smart. Democrats have record diversity except in leadership, their staff, and the Senate. Republicans, the lobbying sector, and media have comparable diversity stats. https://t.co/QgoUqLISxc Our report: https://t.co/wxWo02pKl1 @mikeallen @soledadobrien @deanbaquet @HowardKurtz
Respecting each party's base? That’s different than what the Washington DC industrial complex has been doing. UBI (minority-majority owned) is committed to trying it. #stopgroupthink #labelsmatter @ninaturner @charliekirk11 @chucktodd @billmaher https://t.co/bOgn8NzsiJ https://t.co/qbMwNnF6KM
United by Interest is the first bi-partisan minority-majority owned lobbying and public affairs firm in Washington, DC. Our approach is different. #labelsmatter #stopgroupthink #respectthestatistics https://t.co/6TW6950dBE

The lack of diversity on K Street &amp; in media creates a monolithic echo chamber that shuns diverse perspectives, destroys creativity, and produces ineffective strategies. #stopgroupthink #labelsmatter @theodoricmeyer @marianne_levine https://t.co/x9P26PQQtR
