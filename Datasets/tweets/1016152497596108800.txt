@FLMel69 @Megan4MAGA @maziehirono @SenFeinstein @DNC @GOP They all knew. Some reporters were contacting the accuser for a statement before allegations were even made public.  This is a huge smear campaign. 		https://t.co/g2Axn6tdih
@SenFeinstein Why were you holding onto this letter so long? According to Buzzfeed they learned about the allegations and the accusers name earlier this month.  I'm really confused on why it was held back if it was already leaked to the press.		https://t.co/g2Axn6tdih
@senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Senator Hatch, do you know how Buzzfeed was able to learn about these allegations prior to them becoming public?  They tried getting a statement from Ms. Ford earlier this month, according to their article.		https://t.co/g2Axn6tdih
@FoxNews @SenFeinstein How did Buzzfeed know prior to the allegations being made public??		https://t.co/g2Axn6tdih
@chrisgeidner How did Buzzfeed learn of these allegations before they became public?		From paragraph 6 in the news article above:		 "Ford declined to comment on the incident to BuzzFeed News earlier this month, before the allegation was made public."
What??  Paragraph 6:		 "Ford declined to comment on the incident to BuzzFeed News earlier this month, before the allegation was made public."		 How did Buzzfeed know before the allegation was made public?		This whole ordeal just reeks. https://t.co/8EUSwAPtfs
