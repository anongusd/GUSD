President Trump and Republican leadership may not think a missed paycheck is important, but this is taking a real toll on hundreds of thousands of public servants this holiday season in the #TrumpShutdown. Enough.
Today, House Democrats once again offered a path forward to end the #TrumpShutdown to parts of his own Administration. This is a bill to fund the government, identical to that unanimously approved by the Senate‚Äîyet Republicans blocked it.
As a personal friend since our work together decades ago in the Texas Legislature, I am saddened by his sudden passing. Let‚Äôs remember Paul by renewing our own commitment to continue building a community that advances opportunity for all.

With an alarming increase in bankruptcy among older Americans, it is more important than ever to protect Social Security. On this 83rdanniversary, we must recommit to ensuring the solvency of this critical economic security program. https://t.co/eAgHVfaWBw
After 83 years of successfully protecting our seniors from poverty, too many Republicans would still prefer to weaken Social Security. The recent Republican tax law adds trillions to the national debt, jeopardizing our ability to preserve Social Security for future generations.
In 2016 alone, Social Security lifted over half a million Texas women out of poverty. Without Social Security, the poverty rate of elderly Texas women would have increased by fourfold.
For 83 years, Social Security has provided millions of Texans economic security to enjoy their senior years with dignity.  And it provides valuable disability and survivor‚Äôs protection.

Trump blames California wildfires on ‚Äúbad environmental laws‚Äù but science says otherwise. Where there is smoke there is fire‚Äîthe smoke at the White House is Trump‚Äôs commitment to bailing out the coal industry, clouding his judgement &amp; smothering our planet.https://t.co/xVVM7urjsh
As we work to confront deep racial divides in our country and violence against African-American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian communities, it is imperative that we have leaders committed to equality and follow the example of my friend John Lewis in ‚Äúmaking good trouble.‚Äù
1yr ago a young woman peacefully protesting a white supremacist rally was killed in Charlottesville. After initially defending neo-Nazis &amp; KKK members shouting racist &amp; anti-Jewish slurs as ‚Äúvery fine people,‚Äù Trump has continued 2 support racist candidates, nominees, &amp; policies.
After tweeting he was looking into 3D printed guns, Trump surrendered to the NRA‚Äôs agenda &amp; had a spokeperson mimic their response‚Äîa response touting undetectable, untraceable guns. To make our communities safer, we need new leaders not owned by the NRA.https://t.co/QvGXn54r3A

This entire Trump tariff exclusion process is unfair to American businesses. It lends itself to crony capitalism and corruption.
Since I exposed this special treatment for a key member of Putin‚Äôs criminal gang, Trump @CommerceGov has offered doubletalk, delay, &amp; belatedly reversed itself. That, with Trump‚Äôs eagerness to please Putin &amp; to ignore US sanctions, suggests that, yet again, Putin was in control.
Trump Admin granted this tariff exclusion, certifying no national security concerns, to a sanctioned subsidiary owned by a sanctioned Russian aluminum company a mere 3 days after Trump‚Äôs surrender in Helsinki.
Why did Trump give a favor to a sanctioned Putin buddy ahead of &gt;28,000 requests from mostly American companies? As I shared with @nytimes, I secured the evidence of this troubling, preferential approval &amp; raised it last month at a Ways &amp; Means hearing. https://t.co/0G69sWsmtf

What is it that Trump talked to Putin about that he refused to permit even his closest aides to hear?  We still don‚Äôt know. If we ever learn, it will probably be from something that leaks out of Moscow.

It will take more than blustery tweets to show that Trump is much more than a Putin pawn.
Until Trump wrongfully terminated it, we had an agreement that was working to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon with the type of verification and intrusive inspections that Trump has failed to secure with North Korea.
Exposing his weakness by capitulating to Putin &amp; achieving so little w N Korea, Trump seeks to change subjects by appearing strong w renewed threats against Iran. This type of dangerous threat could lead into the type of war w Iran that some in the Middle East have long promoted.

A Fox &amp; Friends host on Trump Network said, "Like it or not, these aren't our kids. Show them compassion, but it's not like he is doing this to the people of Idaho or Texas." No. We will only progress as a Nation when we see our own children &amp; grandchildren in every child‚Äôs eyes.

GOP works to make it harder for people w/ pre-existing conditions to afford insurance. If AG Paxton‚Äôs dangerous lawsuit to dismantle ACA succeeds, millions of Texans may be charged higher premiums or denied insurance b/c they have a pre-existing condition. https://t.co/oTt09Q2XJN

Instead of a bill to build Trump‚Äôs wall, GOP needs to build a mirror to see what they have become‚Äîwilling accomplices to his wrongdoing. Mexico would probably even pay for that. But these children deserve so much better. View my House floor speech here. https://t.co/yyHJuQdP0n
I am about to speak on the House floor Republican on the immigration bill. Tune in.
The crying, distraught children we heard are still crying and distraught. Trump has produced no plan nor a timetable for their reunification.
How nice that that while at least temporarily reversing his family separation policy Trump dispatched his wife, a mother, to visit detained children. They don‚Äôt want to see ‚Äúa‚Äù mother. They want THEIR mother.

They most certainly are. Trump Admin uses parents‚Äô love for their children as a weapon in their war on immigrants.

Nor does Speaker Ryan‚Äôs alternative represent moderation. A leaked draft shows it holds Dreamers‚Äî&amp; now little detained children‚Äîhostage for anti-immigrant provisions. Neither bill appears to do anything to end the cruel Trump policy of tearing children f/ asylum-seeking mothers.
2 anti-immigrant bills are up for House Floor action this week. As @washingtonpost Editorial Board says about the bill authored by Reps. McCaul &amp; Goodlatte, known as the Steve Bannon Bill, it ‚Äúis anti-immigrant fervor distilled into reactionary policy.‚Äù https://t.co/YayomBPBR5

I'm seeking to restore our compliance w/ Refugee Convention, long ago ratified by the US. The treaty states: ‚Äúthe unity of the family...is an essential right of the refugee." It recommends ‚Äúgovernments to take the necessary measures for the protection of the refugee‚Äôs family."

But, six years later, Speaker Ryan continues to block consideration of the DREAM Act. Instead, he's pushing us to vote on Trump-endorsed anti-immigrant measures. After years of success and challenges, we need the #DreamActNow.
This month marks a 6th anniversary of the successful DACA program‚Äîwhich provided a way for Dreamers to keep studying, working, &amp; contributing to their communities. In his Rose Garden speech announcing DACA, President Obama lauded the bipartisan DREAM Act &amp; urged Congress to act.
I‚Äôm working to reunite separated families in our area &amp; pursuing every legislative option to block Trump‚Äôs policy. We people of good faith to come together, to stand to Trump up on behalf of these little ones. We must end this un-American abuse of asylum-seekers.
The scripture cited by Mr. Sessions, to justify tearing children from their mothers, is the kind that‚Äôs been twisted by authoritarian governments throughout the ages to justify shameful abuses of power. #FamiliesBelongTogether
‚ÄúI‚Äôd just have to say that Jeff Sessions didn‚Äôt attend the Sunday School that I did.‚Äù Just now, I joined @CNNnewsroom to discuss the cruelty of Trump‚Äôs new family separation policy. Our Nation‚Äôs shame. https://t.co/9FWMNI3zFb
15 MIN: I invite you to tune into @CNNnewsroom with @FWhitfield at noon CST today. I will be speaking out against the Trump Administration's horrible new policy of separating asylum-seeking children and their mothers‚Äîand what we can do to end this human rights abuse.
It‚Äôs almost as if Trump admired the ‚Äútough guy,‚Äù rather than deploring the dictator's abusive tactics. That includes imprisoning an estimated 120,000 in wretched prison camps. https://t.co/C4ZPECMytG
First Trump salutes the North Korean general, &amp; responds to a journalist asking about Kim Jong-un‚Äôs brutal executions with, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a tough guy.‚Äù
Shamefully, Trump may be seizing these children to use them like he has used our Dreamers as hostages for building his wall. We must confront the core of the atrocity: the Trump Administration‚Äôs systematic war on immigrants.
GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham gave the game away today: Contrary to Trump‚Äôs lie that Democrats made him do it, Trump could end his family separation policy w/ a phone call. But he won‚Äôt because‚Äîas he also admits‚Äîit was put in place to intimidate asylum-seekers. https://t.co/k3N0fHBXj0

Astounding. While it's good news that the potential for President Trump to start a nuclear war has been reduced, there has been no progress toward verifiable North Korean denuclearization‚Äîno removals, no plan for inspections or even promise of inspections. https://t.co/Ne3OygLpmN
The father accepted deportation so that he could be with his child. But the child remains in government custody. Now for 4 months, the family video calls with their baby, detained by a foreign government.  https://t.co/SyzS6N98Z9
There is no way around this: The United States government is violating human rights. @RAICEStexas, one of our community partners, reported that the Trump Admin tore a 4 month old child from their father‚Äôs arms &amp; held them in detention.
If words, if speeches, if Trump‚Äôs tweets could resolve the drug pricing crisis, we would be celebrating a ‚Äòyuge‚Äô victory. But instead, Americans are left with sky-high prices that just keep soaring despite Trump‚Äôs many promises and declarations. https://t.co/vqf3Zuy6i3

In the 2 yrs since the #Pulse massacre, there have been HUNDREDS of mass shootings, yet GOP has allowed ZERO votes on reasonable #gunsafety action. We must act to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks &amp; a ban on military-style assault weapons. https://t.co/gImjhGtDls
Talking is better than shooting. But Trump yielded much to a brutal tyrant for little more than the unverified promises we‚Äôve been offered for years.
Meanwhile, North Korea displayed to the world its flag beside ours and its cruel leader as an equal on the international stage, while achieving a reduction in U.S. military exercises and an effective easing of economic sanctions.
What‚Äôs missing is even one of the essential steps to ensure verified North Korean denuclearization‚Äîno declarations of nuclear materials, sites, commitment to remove materials, no plan for inspections or even a promise of inspections.
THREAD: Better handshakes with North Korean tyrant than guns blazing, missiles flying, and so many dying. Yet so far, Trump appears to have actually accomplished little more than the global attention he craves.
Trump: A hawk on Canada, a dove on North Korea. And Republicans seeking reelection too chicken to speak out.
The same day that Trump called for Russia to be reinstated as a member of the G-7, American intelligence director urged allies in France to combat Russia‚Äôs attempts to divide us. What a sharp, sad contrast between American values‚Äî&amp; Trumpian, Putin values.  https://t.co/GgxYkm228b

Following our urging an investigation into illegal politicization of immigration judicial applicants, the Trump Administration has hastily appointed six of the judges in question.
Gov. Abbott‚Äôs roundtable wasn‚Äôt very round‚Äîhe excluded our leading advocates. And so his recommendations on "gun violence" in our schools largely omit the ‚Äúgun‚Äù part. Real change demands open conversation &amp; courage to stand up to the NRA. #EnoughisEnough	https://t.co/oUlZWsx2Vc

Trump chose to end #DACA. No one's stopping him from extending it to #ProtectDREAMers. Speaker Ryan refuses a House vote on bipartisan proposals to resolve it. Yesterday, House Rs blocked a  #DREAMAct vote for the 26th time. Trump's claim is as error-ridden &amp; phony as his tweets.
After years of fending off terrible attacks from those who would repeal and take away health care access, we must continue to resist efforts by the Trump Republicans to erode the coverage so vital to so many.
8 yrs ago we expanded health insurance to millions of Americans, ensured plans cover essential services, &amp; ended discriminatory practices that charged seniors, women, &amp; those w/ pre-existing conditions more. These are a few of the landmark achievements since passage of the #ACA.
A seasoned warmonger, Bolton promoted the invasion of Iraq, continues to defend the invasion after its failure became clear, urged bombing Iran, and last month set forth a legal basis for attacking North Korea. More dangerous days lie ahead. https://t.co/U5LQZKIXlj
Trump risks Americans‚Äô safety &amp; global security. By replacing H.R. McMaster, a distinguished 3-star general, with John Bolton as his National Security Adviser, Trump takes us closer to military conflict &amp; endangers our families' safety. Bolton really is Trump‚Äôs Dr. Strangelove.

Today, I questioned U.S. Trade Rep Robert Lighthizer in a Ways &amp; Means hearing on the public health impacts of current NAFTA negotiations. We must not let private interests, like Big Tobacco,  Big Pharma &amp; the Obesity Lobby  subvert public health through such agreements.
An immense thank you to all of those at APD, the FBI, and ATF for working around the clock to protect us. While the investigation continues to ensure nobody else was involved and no other bombs have been circulated, our immediate nightmare has ended with the bomber‚Äôs death.
Amidst the fear &amp; uncertainty in Austin, I am encouraged by the efforts of local &amp; federal law enforcement working together to do everything possible to respond to these bombings &amp; protect our community. In the meantime, please remain alert &amp; vigilant. https://t.co/nBI6Fr8HbU

#Trumpbudget is a reverse Robin Hood, taking from Medicare, Medicaid, student assistance to pay for his #taxscam giving billions in tax breaks to the wealthiest few &amp; large multinational corporations.
There have been 376 mass shootings since the beginning of 2017. Instead of moments of silence, Congress must have moments of action. Let‚Äôs call for a moment of action beginning w at least at least 1 day when the GOP majority allows us to consider common-sense gun safety leg.
Time and again, short moments of silence are followed by long moments of Republican inaction. Enough! This horrible, unending loss of precious lives must not be ignored by this Republican-controlled Congress, owned lock, stock, and barrel by the NRA.
The #Parkland massacre marks the 18th school shooting &amp; 30th mass shooting this year. In the past 5 months, 3 of the 10 deadliest shootings in US history occurred.  Our deepest sympathy to those whose lives were brutally taken from them, the injured, &amp; their families.
Another day, another shooting, indeed, multiple shootings today, while Congress sits in the grip of the NRA, incapable of making the slightest gesture toward reasonable gun safety.
Trump once said he had a ‚Äúlove‚Äù for #DREAMERS but threatening communities &amp; separating families is not love. This #ValentinesDay, let‚Äôs show some for our Dreamers who are our teachers, students, parents &amp; coworkers. Pass the #DreamAct.	https://t.co/GYCQsQfEoL

Apparently the real Trump goal is to privatize public works by starving cities of funding unless they rely upon private ownership. His original plan relied almost exclusively on tax breaks for tollways, and his budget actually cut federal transportation funding.
His claim that he would ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù $1.5 trillion for infrastructure apparently involves at most $150 billion in federal funding for all US cities over 10 yrs. He offered no way to pay for this fund, which would be open for roadways, &amp; public structures like sewers &amp; airports.
At a time when we need more resources to address our mobility crisis, Trump refuses to lead. Don‚Äôt count on swift federal help on I-35 or elsewhere. After more than a year of inaction on this high priority, his #SOTU remarks re: infrastructure were among his most misleading.
