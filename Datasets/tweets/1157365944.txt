What an amazing morning! Thank you to all of our panelists and speakers! #NYCJusticeCorps
"If you think New York will be successful without these young people being present, you're wrong. Look at 1970-1979." #NYCJusticeCorps
"We still have a system that doesn't value these young people as young people - as New Yorkers." #NYCJusticeCorps
"I was surprised by how receptive the young people were. They accepted us as part of their family." #NYCJusticeCorps
"We have to help our young people so they can take their place in the community." #NYCJusticeCorps
"Justice Corps gave me a newfound dignity. I made myself into a new human being. It gave me a sense of pride." #NYCJusticeCorps
"I'd obtained eight jobs, but was let go after background checks." #NYCJusticeCorps
"Now that I've been through the program, I'm more confident. I didn't have a GED, now I do."
"Going to Justice Corps put me on the right track - the staff was amazing and helped me to figure out my role."

Panel 2!! Response to report: Program alumni and hosts of community benefit projects. https://t.co/inVJ24Tyln
Let's hear from our Corps members and host sites! #NYCJusticeCorps
(This is all coming from a NYS DOCCS judge.)
Thread on over policing #NYCJusticeCorps https://t.co/8wTnoaNkFh
"I have yet to see that happen. I have seen lots of meetings and I believe they're sincere. But it doesn't address the over policing."
"Requires focused, clear conversations then community boards &amp; police departments with a real commitment to address that issue."
"It's a direct relationship with the policing. It's a pipeline. How we modulate that policing - need for it, and need to stop it..."
"Statistics still show that most prisoners come from 7-8% of the community. How do we address that?" #NYCJusticeCorps
RT @arrant_annarchy: @danstageman "Why is there not a critical mass of folks? Society doesn't care as much about Black and Brown kids." #NY‚Ä¶
"We shouldn't send fourteen year olds to facilities. There's gotta be a different way. That's what we should advocate for." #NYCJusticeCorps
"Obvious correlations between police activity and neighborhoods. Responding to the community. (But which community?)" #NYCJusticeCorps

Corps members come to view themselves as contributors to the vibrant fabric of their neighborhoods #NYCJusticeCorps
Bring out something that's already there. A potential bridging between the young people and the communities. #NYCJusticeCorps
"Not just fixing broken people, but broken relationships. This is how they 'earn' their way back." #NYCJusticeCorps
"In Justice Corps, there is an actual understanding of how justice works. These are the restoration projects." #NYCJusticeCorps
RT @PhippsNY: 1 Fact from the report: #NYCJusticeCorps members have completed over 160 community benefit projects = 326,475 working hours &amp;‚Ä¶
Internalize "this is who I am; I must really be an offender." Internalize the *stigma*. (And therein lies low recidivism)
Re-naming: Commit a crime and are given a new title - offender. It's a retrospective term &amp; one that presumes the future.
"When people move from one status to the next, it's an invisible move. We have to symbolize it with rites of passage." (Marriage, prison...)

In 2016, there were 210 young people enrolled, and 146 placements made. Academic, vocational, and more! #NYCJusticeCorps
"The critical focus for us is soft skills. This is the overlap that reduces recidivism and strengthens goals." #NYCJusticeCorps
"Our clients are mostly men of color. 59% have some high school experience, but no degree." #NYCJusticeCorps
"If young people drop out, we make our services available for when they're ready to come back." #NYCJusticeCorps
"We provide high levels of support - a 'pre-bridge' model. We adapt based on what our young people need to thrive."
"It's not what we do, it's how we do it. We use a developmental approach that gives opportunities for leadership and contribution."
"Justice Corps enrolls about 200 young people a year, serves alumni, and operates out of four different locations." #NYCJusticeCorps
"The report tells the story with the description of 160+ community benefit projects completed since 2008." #NYCJusticeCorps

Reduce the # of #womeninprison with pre-trial reform that meets the needs of cj-involved women. https://t.co/WOT2RaYeYP
@OsborneNY research shows that children are harmed when parents are incarcerated even for short periods and recommends bail alternatives.
Gender-responsive reentry programs, like @CCFEducates and others supported by @NYWomensFdn, need resources to serve more women.
Yes! And #banthebox and end discrimination in housing against people and #WomenInPrison with criminal records. @ccf_ny
Let's divert women from the justice system! More education, employment, and housing opportunities for women b4 they are #womeninprison
Yes! More data about #womeninprison can change #cjreform convos. @BeyondReentry
We should focus on meeting individual need, which includes attention to gender.  Women need gender-specific programs like @ccf_ny @GSW_Inc
We need more gender-specific programing--like @CANY_1844 @STEPStoendFV @courtinnovation-- to reduce the # of #womeninprison
Women returning home from prison need a home to return to! Transitional, supportive, affordable housing all needed. @cshinfo @thefortunesoc
We are excited to be participating in @CCFEducates town hall on #womeninprison.
Women are invisible in the criminal justice system. There's a lack of data and attention in reform. #womeninprison

#Pretrial detainees are at 3x greater risk of suicide than those who have been convicted - who are already at a greater than avg risk.
Martin Schoenteich: The poor are held more often because they can't afford the 3 B's of intl #pretrial: bail, a barrister, or a bribe.
Martin Schoenteich: Poorer countries have greater %age of prisoners awaiting #pretrial - even if their incarceration rate is relatively low.

"The CJ policies that got us into this mess have seen only minimal change, and it's all come from the judiciary" @RonaldFDay @thefortunesoc
Communities are underpoliced in that they don't feel protected, and overpoliced in that their young men are constantly stopped and searched.
.@JumaaneWilliams: Community policing is not a beat cop or a special program. It's a philosophy that has to be adopted from the top down.
RT @TheHOPEProgram: Great discussion at panel The Growth of Incarceration in the US @JohnJayPRI this morning with @BronxDefenders @etcnyorg‚Ä¶
Todd Clear: one huge problem is the way that community service providers are pitted against each other to compete for the same paltry funds
Julio Medina @etcnyorg brings up the faith community's opportunity to plan a role in neighborhood-level effects http://t.co/4KtfmrevxT
.@JumaaneWilliams: it doesn't have to be police who fix the broken windows. (Amen!)
Todd Clear: the solutions to the mass incarceration problem have to be place-based.
.@JumaaneWilliams: We have the research to know what works and doesn't work. The question now is why we're not applying it.
.@JumaaneWilliams City depts need to work together. Why doesn't the dept of mental health look at the same data as the nypd?
"The design of the CJ system is rooted in racist thinking - and it won't change until we acknowledge it for what it is." @JumaaneWilliams
.@JumaaneWilliams: the country and the CJ system works the way it was designed to work. We choose this dysfunction. http://t.co/8PmamG0IqZ
Repairing our communities means talking about 53,000 people who are living in conditions that send them home with serious trauma @etcnyorg
Julio Medina @etcnyorg talks about hearing two 8 year olds on Ogden Avenue comparing what their dads are in prison for.
Julio Medina from @etcnyorg talks about folks navigating daily deprivation and a system structured for failure http://t.co/1sytp32nXj
."@BronxDefenders don't say "collateral consequences". We talk about "enmeshed penalties" b/c they are too devastating to be collateral"
Kate Rubin: Communities don't just need evidence-based services. They need political advocacy and economic development.
Kate Rubin: what would the data show about short-stay jail cycling? Great question @BronxDefenders
Kate Rubin explains how @BronxDefenders works to deal with the devastating consequences of arrest http://t.co/FM2vzw766V
Data shows that incarceration increases lead to crime increases in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Tallahassee, Boston, and Trenton.
Geert Dhondt: In Tallahassee the crime rate in black neighborhoods is 1.5x the average, but the incarceration rate is 9x the average.
Gerry Dhondt: Much more overlap between concentrated disadvantage and prison admission than between prison admission and crime
Todd Clear: With community incarceration rates there's a "tipping point", after which incarceration rates actually increases crime.
Dr Clear: Incarceration matters, and it matters differently to different communities. Place matters.

Patricia Warth @CCA_NY: okay, the fines are meant to be punitive. But who are we punishing with #CJdebt? Most of the time, it's families.

Neal: Racist police practices on their own were not enough to account for the boom. 75% of the boom was policy.
Derek Neal: This is our first paper on crime and incarceration. We're just getting started.
Derek Neal: I say what I can put a confidence interval around and if I don't have a data set I stay silent.
Neal: consider who stands to benefit from prison growth. This system can't get bigger without their political support.
Ann Jacobs: Neal seems to be implying that there was no change in police practices resulting in greater arrests of people of color.
PRI Director Ann Jacobs: I don't understand how we can have this conversation without considering racially biased police practices.

Andrea Anderson-Hamilton: Even colorblind policies have a racially disproportionate impact. To me that's the punchline of this story.
Michelle Holder: Neal's analysis would be more complete if he included the background of how CJ policies became more punitive to blacks
Neal: Our claim is that the change that led to the prison growth was not a change that was targeted at one racial group.
Neal: We at no place in our paper say that criminal justice policy is executed in a colorblind way. I actually don't believe that's true.
