If you are represented by a Republican in the House, please respectfully reach out via email or call and ask them to uphold the will of the voters and share why Medicaid Expansion is important to you.
I’m unable to be at the Capitol tomorrow morning, I’ll be at work. If you can make it, please join others as they gather to show support for #MedicaidExpansion at 10:15 am near the Rotunda area. The House vote will be between 11 &amp; 12:15. #UtahDecided #utpol

Thanks to all who joined for our Prop 2 &amp; Sentencing Reform Town Hall. I will never stop talking about #CriminalJusticeReform and public policy that makes our societies healthier and safer. Special thanks to @SimGillDA and @weldon_angelos for joining me! #ShireenTownHalls https://t.co/o9jHAF4EPd
@SimGillDA adds, “I applaud faith-based groups that are making this effort, but we as a society have failed to recognize that back end work and implement more holistic solutions on a policy level.” #ShireenTownHalls
Q: “How can I help recently released members who come to my church access affordable counseling and job placement services?” 👉🏼 There are many organizations making that effort individually, like @GoToOtherSide. #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Can I vote for you even if I have a felony on my record? 👉🏼 YES. You can! Utah is one of few states that recognizes that you have served your time and your voice matters. Please spread the word. #YourVoteCounts #ShireenTownHalls
From @weldon_angelos, “Locking people up for small offenses is expensive and perpetuates cycles of poverty.” Every taxpayer should be invested in #CriminalJusticeReform and an end to #MandatoryMinimums. #ShireenTownHalls https://t.co/cMZveslgdr
Q: What federal measures would ensure medical cannabis is accessible to patients &amp; safely distributed? 👉🏼 Re-categorizing cannabis from a Schedule I to Schedule II substance means it could be delivered to patients in pharmacies instead of dispensaries. #ShireenTownHalls #YesOn2
@SimGillDA speaks about #patientsnotcriminals, and the families he has met who have faced judicial obstruction against access to medical cannabis. “Prop 2 ballot initiative exists b/c of the legislature’s continued failure to respond to constituents’ voices.” #ShireenTownHalls https://t.co/jXBTTq3rXp

Thank you to every one who joined us for our #Healthcare Town Hall. No family should be on the verge of bankruptcy due to a pre-existing condition or single hosptial visit. #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Cost of prescriptions? 👉🏼 If we do not stop electing reps who are funded by big pharma, we will not see positive change in our national #healthcare crisis. Our campaign has not taken a single dollar from corporate PACs. #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Can UT Legislature tinker with Medicaid Expansion if it passes? 👉🏼 Kinda...it could be amended or rescinded. So your #vote is critical to sending a message with a large margin win! #yeson3 #ShireenTownHalls #healthcare
Just learned in our #healthcare town hall that *if we pass Medicaid Expansion (prop 3)*, 22,500 Utah children will be able to enroll in healthcare and gain coverage. #ShireenTownHalls
Follow up: There exists no current GOP bill that decreases the cost and increases access. And the GOP has set their sights - again - on repealing the ACA which would leave us with nothing, and no protections for pre-existing conditions. #healthcare #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Do you support a single-payer system? 👉🏼 Our current healthcare system costs us $3.3 trillion, the proposal for #MedicareForAll will cost $1.38 trillion. If we expand healthcare to everyone through a single-payer system, we can drive down the cost. #ShireenTownHalls

Q: Political polarization? 👉🏼 What I’m hearing at doorsteps is that there is far more that unites us than divides us. Polarization is an excuse we are being sold by reps who don’t want to do the productive work of listening and finding solutions. #utpol #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Rural schools? 👉🏼 We must guarantee that kids in Delta, Boulder have access to the same opportunities as young people along the Wasatch front. This requires fierce local, state, federal advocates for the resources ALL schools need. #uted #ShireenTownHalls
@derekkitchen says #YesOn1 is a start, but we need to get creative and look even beyond that to secure the futures of young Utahns.
Follow up: What would those resources look like? 👉🏼 A federal, state, local intersection. We need fierce advocates in our legislatures who are serious about education funding. #uted #ShireenTownHalls
Q: Are Utah students being adequately prepared for real careers in high school? 👉🏼 We are cutting back vocational training programs in public schools and need to revisit those resources. Let’s prepare students for the jobs that are in demand now. #uted #ShireenTownHalls
Q: The cost of education - what can we do? 👉🏼 ✅ Driving down interest rates on student loans to the lowest % possible ✅ Free tuition to vocational schools/technical colleges ✅ Student loan forgiveness programs #uted #ShireenTownHalls
Guaranteeing #mentalhealthcare parity in our healthcare system will build safer communities. Access to mental healthcare for young people ranges from school counselors to coverage that allows families to access care for their children. #uted #ShireenTownHalls

@CodySearleVG @JennyWilsonUT Yep.
That voter offered me a warm empanada, it was delicious, and an apple from her mother’s apple tree. I’m not going to forget about her and her family. We could fix immigration if we had the political will. I do. /*
I support a pathway to citizenship for dreamers. I’ve met many Utahns who agree. /10
We can do better. Families do not need to live in fear. We simply have a Congress that will not act. /9
He has his papers, but the system is incredibly difficult to navigate and they are trying to do it all by the books. It’s nearly impossible for families to navigate. /8
She told me she and her partner were terrified. He’s Mexican. He’s been working here for years. They are working to get his citizenship- but -and hear me now - there is no line. /7
Felt like a win, so I headed to the next door. She popped back out of her house and said, “I have one more question and I’m likely to get emotional.” (It’s cool, I cry frequently on the trail). /6
We chatted about a few other topics. I asked for her vote. She said she’d consider it and she was leaning towards supporting me. /5
I told her, as the daughter and now wife of a teacher, education is critically important to me and I’m committed to working on early childhood education and will work to reduce students loan debt. /4
Last night, I was knocking on doors in Magna. I knocked on the door of a young woman, her first question was about education. /3
I just heard Mitt say that #dreamers can get in line and wait their turn. I also heard @JennyWilsonUT argue for compassionate immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for dreamers and policies that do not rip families apart.
This is an apple and an empanada. I’m currently watching @JennyWilsonUT and @MittRomney debate and I need to tell you a story about last night. #utdebates /1 https://t.co/YQnOYdLJhk

@davidfking Accurate.
Can someone in the Republican Party explain to me what exactly is fiscally responsible about this decision? Immigration reform may not be as politically advantageous as the checks you receive from for profit detention centers, but at some point you’ll get around to it, right? /*
In the words of @JoeBiden - “Show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value.” It is costing us millions to lock up children. That money is coming out of programs that help keep people healthy or help us lead the world in science and innovation. /5
Oh, and $9.8 million from #Medicare and #Medicaid program ops. $13.3 mill from @theNCI - the National Cancer Institute and $87.3 from the National Institutes of Health. /4
So where are they taking the money from? $16.7 million from @HeadStartgov - from Head Start. $3.8 million from HIV prevention. $16.7 mill from @CDCgov. $2.2 million from maternal and child health programs (an area where we are not doing so hot.) /3
Please also remember that @HHSGov once again could 👏🏼not👏🏼locate👏🏼 1,500 children they released over a three month period. /2
13,000 children are in custody and instead of meaningful immigration reform this administration is doing two things: 1) Change the rules so the US can detain children indefinitely. 2) Take $260 million out of critical programs (see below) /1 #utpol https://t.co/DAjubHR40G

@RobDavis22884 Lastly, you'll see that many requests are for additional help with technology and computers in classrooms. Computer literacy is an essential skill for all families. Federal grants are one way to help these educators adequately resources their classrooms.
@RobDavis22884 There are also a number of special education teachers asking for help. I fully support the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and would work to ensure adequate funding for schools working to meet the needs of children with disabilities.
@RobDavis22884 Another concern I have is that this administration put a person in charge of the Dept. of Education who does not seem qualified. I believe agendas that work to prioritize the privatization of education are dangerous.
@RobDavis22884 You'll notice that a number of these requests are coming from teachers at Title 1 schools. Much of the K-12 funding decisions are decided at the state level. However, Title 1 schools rely more on fed funding. I would be pushing for increased resources for these schools.

“Estimates of increased tourism revenue, analyses that existing restrictions had not hurt fishing operators and agency reports that less vandalism occurred as a result of monument designations were all set aside.” /3
“The inadvertently released documents show that department officials dismissed some evidence that contradicted the administration’s push to revise national monument designations, which are made under the 1906 American #AntiquitiesAct.” /2
“The new documents show that as #Zinke conducted his four-month review, Interior officials rejected material that would justify keeping protections in place and sought out evidence that could buttress the case for unraveling them.” /1 https://t.co/EFkgPWsBpP

Families live freer and with a greater sense of dignity when we have healthcare. Profit and insurers can not be in the driver seat on the future of healthcare in this country. /8
People with #PreExistingConditions need access to affordable healthcare. Everyone needs access to affordable healthcare. We need #Medicare and #Medicaid to be able to negotiate drug prices at the federal level. We have to address the rising cost in healthcare administration. /7
40% of households in America do not make enough to cover a monthly budget of the basics - rent, childcare, gas, food, utilities. Where are families going to find the resources for a Health Savings Account? /6
Here is a stark difference between me and my opponent. I believe we need to tackle the cost and create stability in our system. There are many ways we can improve healthcare. The incumbent says: let the market fix it and has suggested Health Savings Accounts as a solution. /5
I spoke with a young mother this weekend. She has an 8 week old and a three year old. She’s also suffering from a kidney infection. She doesn’t want to go in because her monthly premium is already over $600 a month and her deductible is very high. /4

And now they are going after #PreExistingConditions, working to guy #Medicare and #Medicaid. Unacceptable. #ProtectOurCare

It also ensures that children can still visit and contact each other while the parent is detained. But, @RepChrisStewart,  I don’t see your name as a sponsor or co-sponsor on a single bill related to immigration this year. /5
The work of @RepRoybalAllard essentially gives detained parents more leeway to make arrangements for their children to be cared for by another family member while they are detained. Sounds rather humane, no? /4
I support the Help Separated Families Act sponsored by @RepRoybalAllard /4
So @thomaswburr, you didn’t ask, but I am happy to answer. Ripping families apart, especially those seeking asylum at our border, reflects a deep moral failing from the leadership in our country. We can and we must do better. /3

Having taught at institutions of higher education for seven years, as the daughter and wife of educators - I know this to be true and will always support funding for and access to quality education. #utpol /*
“The classroom, with all its limitations, remains a location of possibility.”  - bell hooks. And in the words of bell, education is the practice of freedom. /11
We should also continue to support those who seek education after high school through trade programs or other certifications. Unions have long served an important role in our communities when it comes to educating workers. Let’s keep them strong. /10
I also support public service student loan forgiveness programs. The bureaucracy and paper work around that program needs to be simple and clear.  https://t.co/U9ey8UA1EZ	/9
We could drop the federal student loan interest rate to the lowest possible rate. We could allow those with existing loans to refinance at that lower rate. I support work study programs and Pell Grants to help people come out of college with less debt. /8
College education could be paid for through partnerships with businesses seeking talent and through partnerships at the federal and state level. /7
So what’s to be done. 1 - We could start by making college free or at a very low cost in fields where we need talent. In Utah, two examples are job needs in healthcare and the tech industry. We could do this. We just need to make it a priority.  /6
https://t.co/Ideh3YDr2o
Undergrads will pay 5.04% in interest on new Stafford loans instead of the current 4.45 percent. Grad students will see Direct loans climb from 6% to 6.59%. And parents who take on federal debt to help their children pursue a degree will pay 7.59% instead of 7%. /5
I personally benefited from low interest loans from the @BankofND as an undergrad. My student loan rate was 2.3%. Federal student loan rates are set to increase for the second year in a row. /4
This has a real impact on working families. Homeownership among young Americans in their 20s is at a three-decade low. Personally, I’ve talked to young professional who can’t break into the housing market because of their #StudentLoanDebt /3
Over 44 million Americans carry the burden of over $1.4 trillion in student debt. It is the second largest consumer debt in the U.S., trailing only home mortgage debt. Student loan debt exceeds credit card and auto loans. /2

That’s because our healthcare system is not about health OR care. It’s about profit. We need a shift in priorities if we are going to get to the solutions we need. /7
Ultimately the solution will need to be much bigger than piecemeal cost cutting measures. We have the most expensive healthcare system on Earth and still millions of people do not have access. /6
We can start by cutting costs. Medicare and Medicaid should be able to negotiate drug prices at the federal level, but that’s not even on the table with this administration’s drug plan - that means we all pay more. /5
I will not stop. I will keep working for every day Utahns. I know that fear. I know we need leadership and solutions for the over 30 million Americans without healthcare insurance. /4
I got in this race because of my own family’s experience with #healthcare - I stay in because of her story and countless others. We live freer and with a greater sense of dignity when we know we have access to care. /3
A woman jumped out of the crowd, grabbed me and said, “Thank you. I almost died two years ago because I didn’t have access.” And she asked for my lawn sign. I happily handed her the one I had in my hand. /2

@UtahPigBus What are your thoughts on increasing the federal minimum wage? A living wage in Salt Lake City is now typically considered to by just shy of $12 an hour.
@UtahPigBus A recent example is a bill that just made it out of the House that supports Small Business Investment Companies to help businesses get off the ground in urban &amp; rural areas of the country. Tax reform that prioritizes working families &amp; small business is something else I support.
@UtahPigBus I’m a strong advocate for worker training and education programs. For many generations, unions fulfilled that role in communities. They still invest heavily in training and advancement. I would also support legislation to encourage the growth of small businesses.

She lives in pain. She works hard and can not get the care. That’s not ok with me. She needs a person in Washington sitting with her story every time a vote on access or affordability comes up. We need leadership. We need solutions #

When she was 9, she had Leukemia. She works three jobs, has kids she is raising, and she does not have employer based healthcare.  Our state rejected Medicaid expansion. So she is without the care she needs. /5

There is a simple answer - we need to move to a universal healthcare system. It would help provide stability to families, help small business to grow, and would add jobs across our communities. /3

Many conditions, even very serious ones, if caught early are much easier to manage and that helps to avoid costly catastrophes and huge medical bills down the road. /2

For example, we allow the VA to negotiate drug prices at the federal level, the same is not true for Medicare and Medicaid. That means we, as tax payers, are already all paying more. We can change that. /1

The person I am working to unseat proudly voted against the ACA 40 times and is taking votes regularly to further reduce access to healthcare with no solutions for working families. #

It was a short conversation because of Medicare. She was only 68, but it was there for us when we needed it. /3

I am an only child, raised by a single mom. She was a teacher her whole life in a private school for many years and we didn’t have healthcare - she didn’t have the power of a teacher’s union to rely on. /2

I am very concerned that the President’s actions today have not made our country any safer or more secure. I don’t think the JCPOA was ideal - however, ripping it up is a “solution” a toddler would come up with. I know. I have one. https://t.co/Mfxz1jWP9B
👇🏼 I have an idea about something we can replace this November. (It’s the person who currently holds this congressional seat.) The GOP needs to stop the attacks on access to affordable healthcare. https://t.co/358q3vYfBR

8 out of the 10 poorest counties in Utah are here in the 2nd District. Programs like #SNAP and #CHIP offer some stability to families trying to make ends meet. I will work tirelessly to support these programs. Families living in or near poverty need someone on their side.
I’ll be calling @RepChrisStewart to say #HandsOffSNAP 	SNAP makes families stronger and healthier, helps kids focus on school instead of hunger, and improves the financial stability of families. It’s simple. This is a very low cost program that works - it should be strengthened. https://t.co/LPHCwnqW0F
