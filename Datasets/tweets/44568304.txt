Final note on the #GoldenGlobes before I shut it down for tonight. Are you shocked Matthew McConaughey accepted the award with his shirt on?
Seeing the real Philomena at the #GoldenGlobes gave me as Leonardo Dicaprio mis-pronounced it "Philo-mania"
The Globes can be silly, but overall pleased 12 Years-Best Pic, McCon&amp;Leo for actor, Amy Adams for actress, Her for writing &amp; of course BrBa
