ICYMI: Here‚Äôs my response to the Governor‚Äôs State of the State address‚Ä¶ https://t.co/l4LJbqYCuA
I want you to join me in fighting for a better future for our state. Take action now at https://t.co/WLaIg3YmyY. https://t.co/aH5A6qnOJR
‚ÄúWe are all in this together and we share this time, and I know our past does not have to be our future.‚Äù
‚ÄúI want to speak to each South Carolinian within the sound of my voice: it is when we understand our shared aspirations for ourselves and our families, then can we focus on common challenges, because in the end, SC cannot succeed if we are willing to leave some behind.‚Äù
‚ÄúWomen work for South Carolina, but South Carolina does not yet work for women. South Carolina is one of only four states without an equal pay law and it is past time the legislature act and pass equal pay for equal work.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe need a deliberate focus on rural economic development to ensure the building blocks for economic opportunity are present: a high-quality education, infrastructure, availability of health care, and our natural resources preserved.‚Äù
‚ÄúSome say there is a forgotten South Carolina. But in our South Carolina, no one and no place can be forgotten.‚Äù
‚ÄúToo many hardworking families in South Carolina do not have access to health care simply because they live here. Look, every South Carolinian should know that by not accepting our Federal funding ‚Äì your tax dollars ‚Äì we are only paying for the health care in other states.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur economy is not working for everyone and too many hard-working South Carolinians are finding it harder to make ends meet. Improving our education and training is the way to bridge the gap.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll of the legislature should speak with one voice and say: ‚Äúthere will be no drilling off South Carolina‚Äôs coast.‚Äù The billions of dollars and thousands of jobs generated from tourism should not be placed at such a risk.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe must have an independent, accountable consumer advocate to protect the interest of rate-payers. And we cannot consider energy reform complete if we do not make advancement in solar power and efficiency programs.‚Äù
‚ÄúTo think that she and generations to come are now compelled to pay for a nuclear power plant that will never generate a kilowatt of power is an injustice that must be corrected.‚Äù
‚ÄúFirst, clear and transparent action must be taken to restore public trust in the state house. Ethics reform should be on the legislature‚Äôs agenda every year.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe, as South Carolinians, are a proud people and the rankings do not reflect the love and pride we have in our state. I, along with members of the Democratic caucus in the House and Senate, are ready to tackle the important issues facing our state.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is absolutely nothing, nothing you have just heard from the Governor‚Äôs version of the State of the State that will change that. The State of the State should be about our future, not the Governor‚Äôs political future.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am tired of seeing South Carolina on the bottom of every list we want to be on the top of, and on the top of every list we want to be on the bottom of. And I know you are, too.‚Äù

Elect me as your next SC Governor and I will be accountable to the citizens of SC ‚Äî accountable to you.  Now let‚Äôs do this!!
Elect me as your next SC Gov and we will move SC forward- in jobs, healthcare, education, ethics, equal rights, and energy
Join me!  Get your family, friends, neighbors, co workers on board!
It is up to each of us to take ownership of this effort to improve SC- it‚Äôs not up to someone else.  It‚Äôs up to us.  It all starts here!
If we keep putting the same people in power, we will keep getting the same results. This campaign is your campaign.
We need a governor who will Care more about doing the job than keeping the job- I am ready to be that governor
We need a governor who will serve all of the people of this state- that can unify our state
We need leaders we can be proud of!   Republicans, democrats, independents - across the political spectrum-we are all sick and tired of it
SC can‚Äôt accept being at the bottom of every list we want to be on top of and the top of every list we want to be on the bottom of
We can create an energy plan that serves the ppl and not special interests; VC Summer Plant failure makes clear the need for change in SC
SC was recently ranked 47th in Nation in terms of women‚Äôs equality- that doesn‚Äôt reflect our values as South Carolinians
The rights and dignity of every human being should be respected and we should expect no less
The people of SC deserve better.  SC can and must do better.  We need leaders with the political will to get it done.
We are fed up w/ lobbyists and special interests running our govt.  We deserve better than the culture of corruption.
Why not a real energy plan that protects ratepayers? Why not a govt that is transparent, accountable, and that serves ppl first and always?
Why not access to quality healthcare - healthcare for everyone? Why not a SC where everyone‚Äôs constitutional rights are protected?
I see SC as she can be and ask, Why not? Why not an economy that works for all of us? Why not more than a minimally adequate education?
I‚Äôm so proud to formally announce that I am running for Governor of South Carolina!
