@AmySeeksTruth Guns don’t make us safer! We are sad &amp; sorry that you don’t feel safe. We are working with @CAGVNews to make Connecticut safer &amp; all our national &amp; state allies in the Gun Violence Prevention movement to make America safer.
@AmySeeksTruth @CAGVNews @SUPGVNetwork @JoyceFdn @GiffordsCourage Good point. America has too many guns to sell. It seems Connecticut’s strong gun laws do not prevent law-abiding gun owners from buying guns. Congress must pass the laws we passed in Connecticut and more-on the federal level.
5) In Connecticut, before anyone can obtain a gun permit, they must sit for an interview with law enforcement officials who have the power to reject their application. https://t.co/6TdEkHcqs4
4) After 4 were killled by a co-worker in the CT Lottery headquarters in 1998,  1000s of guns were seized under the risk-warrant program, which allows neighbors, employers, health care providers &amp; family to ask local police to interview those who might harm themselves or others.
3) In Connecticut, even people who want to buy ammunition must have a firearms permit!
2) Sales or importation of military-style weapons &amp; large-capacity ammunition magazines were prohibited after the 2012 Newtown school massacre. Owners of semi-automatic weapons, such as the AR-15, who bought them prior to the #SandyHook school shooting had to register them.
1) Connecticut has 1 of the lowest gun death rates in the nation due to our strong gun laws that make it difficult for individuals who are a threat to themselves or others to purchase/own firearms. https://t.co/FPGnGwXsQo @CAGVNews @SUPGVNetwork @JoyceFdn  @GiffordsCourage
Background checks are not enough. Handgun permitting/licensing/training/registration is one of our 26 federal policy priorities! We hope @SenBlumenthal @ChrisMurphyCT @RepJahanaHayes &amp; others in Congress will look into introducing a federal law soon. https://t.co/tpWc48Kvzu
Recent research found that in large, urban counties where firearm homicide tends to concentrate, purchaser licensing laws were associated with an 11% reduction in	firearm homicide.
In 2007, Missouri repealed its purchaser licensing law. Prior to repeal, handgun purchasers had to apply in-person thru the sheriff’s office &amp; the license was good for 30 days. After the repeal, studies show ⬆️ gun homicide rates of 17% to 27% &amp; ⬆️ in gun suicide rates of 16%.
Connecticut’s purchaser licensing law include an in-person application/fingerprinting/safety training &amp; upon approval, a license duration of 5 yrs. This law was associated	w/ a 40% ⬇️ in firearm homicide during the first 10 yrs the law was in place &amp; a 15% ⬇️ in firearm suicide.
After the #AuroraShooting, @JoyceFdn @JohnsHopkins Center for Gun Policy &amp; Research issued a report, “Policies to Reduce Gun Violence in Illinois”. It’s clear background checks are not enough. All states must pass Connecticut’s purchaser licensing law. https://t.co/0O07GdFhOp https://t.co/AsZXo5oeiJ

@muscadyne @ProjChildSafe We would like to see a REAL gun safety organization pass out these free gun locks that have been subsidized by our tax $. The NSSF spent $18M since Sandy Hook to fight all gun laws. NSSF must support universal background checks &amp; unrestrictive/life-saving safe storage laws.
@muscadyne @ProjChildSafe The NSSF @ProjChildSafe program is a smokescreen. 2017 gun deaths rise to highest level in 50 yrs.

Suicides by firearms in Ohio have been rising since 2009. In 2016, Ohio had over 50% more suicides involving a firearm than homicides.
Nearly 75% of Ohio homicides were committed with a gun and 1 out of 5 guns bought in Ohio is recovered from a crime scene within two years. Ohio is not a good neighbor to other states – Ohio ranks near the top in having the guns bought there used in a crime in another state.
Gubernatorial candidate @RichCordray has proposed a comprehensive sensible plan to reduce gun deaths &amp; injuries in Ohio. Since 1999, firearm deaths in Ohio have risen 58%. In 2016, over 1500 Ohioans were killed by a gun. https://t.co/CpHn98uIrg

We implore Donald Trump and Congress to reject NRA money and influence and begin passing common sense proposals to reduce gun homicides, gun suicides, unintentional shootings, and mass shootings in our towns and cities across the nation.
Since the Sandy Hook tragedy, annual gun deaths and injuries have increased and the federal government has failed to pass any substantive gun safety bills to protect all Americans.
By micro-focusing on arming teachers after the heartbreaking Parkland school shooting tragedy, the Trump Administration has once again deflected from the critical issue of unfettered access to guns in America.
It's delusional to think that a teacher with little to no training with a gun would be able to stop a gunman with an AR-15 and high capacity magazines during a terrifying chaotic school shooting incident. #SandyHook #Parkland
According to @VPCinfo Violence Policy Center, even "trained law enforcement officials have only an average of 20 percent hit ratio in armed confrontations, meaning that only 20 percent of shots fired hit the intended target."
In an effort to boost gun sales, the gun lobby has been pushing the arms race between those who wish to do harm &amp; those who wish to protect. With nearly 140k schools in America, the gun industry would profit immensely from arming teachers in our nation.

The Crime Gun Tracing Modernization Act, cosponsored by Florida @SenBillNelson, would require the tracing center &amp; federally licensed firearm retailers to digitize records currently stored on paper and to compile a searchable database.
The NRA law, the 1986 Firearms Owners’ Protection Act, resulted from a marriage of ideological rigidity and political cowardice. It expressly prohibits “any system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions.”
The agents pursue crime gun tracing in the most inefficient, wasteful &amp; time-consuming manner imaginable, manually searching records — about 800 million of them — because the NRA federal law purportedly prevents the center from organizing them into a searchable digital database.
When law-enforcement agents seek information on crime guns, they call the firearms tracing center of the @ATFHQ. The agents pursue the gun’s serial #, manufacturer, distributor &amp; retailer manually. https://t.co/h63mRuiFy7
