We need better ways of discerning violent behaviors &amp; challenging abuse in our communities. Survivors aren‚Äôt crime scenes, they are people.
What does it mean for survivors that often ppl want undeniable, graphic, bloody ‚Äúevidence‚Äù in order to believe them?
Survivors so often aren‚Äôt believed about abuse until it escalates into extreme physical violence or murder. And even then‚Äîvictim blaming.
Emotional abuse is the context for escalation like physical assault. And physical assault is also emotional abuse. #StandWithNanHui
#DV is not a a mere repetition of escalated incidents. Abuse also happens outside the moments of high conflict or physical violence.
Some say Nan-Hui didn‚Äôt experience ‚Äúreal‚Äù #domesticviolence because a ‚Äúdomestic violence incident‚Äù only happened once.
Emotional abuse, manipulation, constant put downs, condescension, threats, can be part of a pattern of abuse.
Violence can look many ways in an intimate relationship. The bar is set so high for ‚Äúproof‚Äù for survivors to be believed.
Intimate partner violence impacts all of our communities, and can cut across race, gender, class, sexuality, ability.

Do not underestimate the State's ability to constantly shift, morph, and adapt to tactics developed by activists. See: #BaltimoreUprising

Campaign organizers met for hours yesterday, strategizing about potential ICE actions and next steps #StandWithNanHui #SleepDeprived
We are not grateful for or relieved abt indefinite detention (that usu leads to deportation). This is still a crisis. Nan-Hui must be free.
5) Her detention is part of process twds deportation. May not get deported right away, but jail is still isolating, dehumanizing, painful.
4) ‚ÄúICE detention‚Äù means jail. Just bc she has been incarcerated for 9 months doesnt mean more imprisonment is ok or not urgent.
2) ICE shldnt b allowed 2 deport yet bc she has immigration hearing scheduled 4 summer. But 3) When do we trust ICE to follow its own rules?
We will have more updates soon on Nan-Hui‚Äôs situation. In meantime, clarifications: 1) Nan-Hui is not in deportation proceedings yet.
Situation not looking good. Need support, more details to come later. NEED PRESSURE ON ICE. CALL NOW http://t.co/uQhYBgoFfZ #StandWithNanHui

THANKYOU to of NH‚Äôs supporters 4 making calls, RTing, sharing media, donating, everything. We know it is challenging w/ the daily changes.
From start, multiple DHS agencies have been involved in her immig. case, incl in Honolulu. We will keep everyone posted as best as we can.
Little while ago she was taken into custody by ANOTHER DHS agency‚Ä¶ NOT ICE. The twists and turns are endless... http://t.co/uT5JWGYMyo
They dropped her off, said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be back tomorrow,‚Äù and left. No one clearly explained where she was, what wld happen next. For hours.
NH spent last night at Yuba County Jail, where she spent 3+ hrs in a ‚Äúwaiting room‚Äù of sorts for booking w/o being told what was happening.
Both are dehumanizing. Both always demand evidence &amp; burden of proof. Survivors are every day people. #StandWithNanHui
Ppl often know only how to relate to survivors in 2 ways: BLAME/MINIMIZE; SAVE/HOLD UP AS SYMBOL. #StandWithNanHui
All our communities, including Korean comm, need to learn &amp; practice the hard work of supporting survivors like Nan-Hui Jo. #StandWithNanHui
Donating http://t.co/y865XWLrWO &amp; Pressuring ICE http://t.co/lMXdavtX14 #StandWithNanHui are obvious answers, but...
Yesterday, we were asked, ‚ÄúWhat can the Korean community do to #StandWithNanHui?‚Äù
CALL @ICEgov to remind them to RELEASE her. Yesterday they had over 138 voicemails before 3pm http://t.co/lMXdavtX14 #StandWithNanHui
AKA, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt say if we‚Äôll detain her until we detain her‚Äù... Well now she‚Äôs with @ICEgov and we still want her FREE. #StandWithNanHui

Another possibility is the motion is denied, NH is released w/ a conviction, detained by ICE, deported &amp; permanently separated from daughter
Another possibility is the motion is granted, the DA does motion for a new trial and NH is denied bail, stays incarcerated during new trial
One possibility today is the motion to set aside verdict is granted, the DA doesn‚Äôt motion for new trial &amp; NH is released w/ no charges

We gotta put lots of pressure on ICE because they and the Yolo County DA's office have made abundantly clear that they're out to get Nan-Hui
What we're asking from ICE is that they not use their immigration hold to detain her tomorrow if she's released #StandWithNanHui
Nan-Hui has an immigration hearing later this year which means that ICE can't deport her right now, but they CAN detain her #StandWithNanHui
@ICEgov and @CustomsBorder will tell you there is no hold, that they have no authority, that you should call someone else, etc. BUT THEY DO.

Meanwhile, all our movements need to seriously contend with epidemic rates of domestic and sexual violence.
Mainstream #DV work often ignores issues of criminalization, incarceration, immigrtn violence, lang access. Yes, this is about DV &amp; race.
Visibility/organizing of #StandWithNanHui made possible largely by hard work of #FreeMarissa. We hope our work will have larger impacts too.

Good morning &amp; happy Sunday! Some of yall asking how to pronounce Nan-Hui‚Äôs name. Thx for asking! It‚Äôs said nAHn-Hee. #StandWithNanHui
In #StandWithNanHui case, criminalization + xenophobia + racism + misogyny + classism all present.
Anti-violence work has to be intersectional bc most/all survivors facing larger forms of violence simultaneously.
Oppressive conditions facilitate abuse. Isolation happens thru poverty, racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, lang access, etc
Survival is complex. Safety isn‚Äôt guaranteed after leaving. DV advocates often call it ‚Äúmost dangerous time‚Äù in abusive relationship.
Leaving abuse &amp; healing happen in ways/timelines tht often don‚Äôt make sense to outsiders looking in. &amp; Sometimes people don‚Äôt leave, period.
Demanding some1 leave when they aren‚Äôt ready, or putting them down when they don‚Äôt leave, is unhelpful. Sustain connection &amp; patience.
Friends/fam oftn have best intentions‚Äîno1 wants to see their loved one harmed. But the support is sometimes unsustainable or conditional.
Not all survivors see/label themselves as victims or survivors. They shouldn‚Äôt need to 4 us to recognize abuse &amp; listen/support/love.
Friends&amp;fam are usu first responders to DV. When shelters/police involved, usu at a much later stage. How can we better support each other?
#ICYMI Nan-Hui‚Äôs new sentencing date is on April 28th, in 10 days. Will you #standwithnanhui? http://t.co/f74b6agoYv
We appreciate all of you doing hard work of supporting survivors like Nan-Hui. Breaking thru isolation for even 1 person is meaningful.
Survivors judged &amp; persecuted/prosecuted by systems &amp; communities alike when they stay. Judged, persecuted/prosecuted when they leave.
That is - if the abuse is even acknowledged as such. See: Marissa Alexander. Nan-Hui Jo. Kelly Savage.
Victim-blaming runs deep in our legal system. Survivors are so often already judged as unsympathetic victims that cause their own abuse.

How can we be accountable for "culture" of isolation + invisibility the U.S. creates around immg #DV survivors? #StandWithNanHui
If you mean the "culture" of #patriarchy, misogyny, devaluing of femininity, then we should probably begin by talking abt the U.S.

41‚Äì61% of Asian women report experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner during lifetime (@APIIDV) #StandWithNanHui
Lack of requests 4 help doesn't mean #Asian #DV survivors do not exist. It means systems have failed them too many times #StandWithNanHui

Immigrants are more than an economic boost, a higher profit margin, easily exploitable &amp; extractable labor #Not1More #StandWithNanHui
Our movement must always center the humanity of immigrants. Hold the dignity &amp; BEAUTY of fierce survivors like Nan-Hui #StandWithNanHui

We are our parents' old school dance moves, the type of laughter that rings out frm depths of pain &amp; survival (2/2) #StandWithNanHui
We are our heartfelt music, our take-over-the-fridge-kind-of-smell kimchi recipes, our "well, during the war" bedtime stories (1/2)
Too often #immigrationreform is justified by pointing at the economic benefits of immigrants. We are not only our labor #StandWithNanHui
Amid the legal strategy + hurried rallies &amp; actions, we recognize the importance of art, music, and creation in our mvmvnts #StandWithNanHui

"Violence perpetrated against women/girls can put them at risk for incarceration..." (1/2)
(3/3) Not only do survivors get criminalized, but the legal system can actively become part of the abuse survivors face. #StandWithNanHui
(2/3) Systems that are "supposed" to help create safety often collude with abusive dynamics + criminalize survivors #StandWithNanHui
(1/3) The criminal-legal syst punishes survivors, separates children from primary caregivers, &amp; worsens impacts of #DV. #StandWithNanHui
We need systems that support survivors in creating safer lives for themselves &amp; their children + loved ones. #StandWithNanHui
