@Biglyness @RepLowenthal The article can say whatever it wants. It's not all that rare for Presidential staff. Trump is an idiot to lie about stuff he doesn't need to lie about. The media just usually doesn't pay attention. Same stuff happened with Obama and Ben Rhodes.

@Biglyness @RepLowenthal Yea the staff was divided and the president made the call? What's your point? He's allowed to do that.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal If that's your takeaway then good luck with that.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal It doesn't matter. Focusing on this is a complete waste of time.
@Biglyness @RepLowenthal That doesn't really matter because the power was ceded to the executive; you can hate on it all you want but that's how business is done in DC. Anyone who was silent when the Clintons and Obamas played this game has no credibility on it now.

It really ought to be questioned why Robert Mueller is permitting Michael Cohen to engage in this shit show. 	He is doing nothing more than speculating and slinging mud.	If he was a cooperative witness for Mueller, what exactly is the point of this?
@AaronBlake This shouldn't be about "connecting dots", either Cohen has something or he doesn't, otherwise this is a clown show.	Or is it that Mueller is incompetent and didn't get this out of Cohen already?
It's starting to look like Lanny Davis royally screwed Michael Cohen by convincing him this was a good idea.	Not surprising given the stupid ideas he also injected into Clinton world over the years.
Michael Cohen's weird fixation on the Forbes rich list like it matters is pretty demonstrative of the extent to which this whole thing has lost the plot.
One thing that has become abundantly clear over the past 16 years is that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump surrounded themselves with remarkably mediocre sycophants. #CohenTestimony
Why does Michael Cohen keep talking about the Forbes rich list like it's some kind of legal document or holy scripture? Nobody cares if Trump bullshitted his way on to it.
Nah, the media isn't biased at all. https://t.co/NFeRT8f57I
So far the Michael Cohen hearing is absolutely nothing new, just Cohen slinging mud at Trump in an effort to beef up his own act of contrition.	This should be embarassing for Democrats but the Press already marketed it as the second coming so they're gonna double down.
@apalmerdc You guys don't have to fan girl so hard for this hearing you know. 	Most people don't care and this is nothing new.

I have no idea what the point of Michael Cohen's testimony is.	This opening statement is just a rehashing of 2015 allegations, combined with Cohen claiming evidence of his wrongdoing is also evidence of Trump's wrongdoing because Cohen says so.	@TheDemocrats should be embarrassed
Why was it so hard to just let Michael Cohen go away? 	Democrats didn't have to latch on to him and claim he's no longer a liar.

@Jeminai2 @CNNPolitics A lot of that is happeningnaturally because I think people do realize the environment should be cared for. The left keeps saying if we don't do "X" now we'll all be dead in 10 years, that is the stuff I object to when the same people then hop on a private jet.

@Jeminai2 @CNNPolitics So the politicians who say climate change must be stopped by, among other things, eliminating jet travel, should be allowed to travel in jets without being called out? Hypocrisy and/or negligence is a nothingburger?

Democrat policy is that if you're pregnant you're allowed to break the law without consequence and babies can be killed after birth as long as someone called "abortion" beforehand.	Seems odd you can use the child as an excuse then decide it's not really a child. https://t.co/80d5Usgr9H

@nbcwashington Yea shame on Americans for not understanding a joke in Xhosa.
@Miguel_M1GS @CNNPolitics I think the simple minded one would be the person unwilling to just admit Joe Biden is a creep. Trump's character has long been laid bare.
@GuyMasson @Alpine_Joy It's obvious a huge number of people didn't think it through, most damningly those in government who were supposed to plan for these things. The EU holding the UK hostage is also unconscionable. A new referendum just magnifies failure though and undermines trust in government.

@eastof_ordinary @ltthompso If you think you need a .gov email to access a google calendar you're the one that doesn't understand how email systems work. Also, you're a rando, too, so that's an odd line of attack.
@rrnusa @ltthompso What does this have to do with AOC hooking her power bottom up with government email?
@Irizarry45 @ltthompso Dude, you're a Socialist and you're lecturing someone else about taking an "L"? 	I guess that's because you're a proponent of a system that fails every time it's tried?
@colbyklaus I don't work for the taxpayers. See the word "former"? That's a word with a meaning, I thought you were a writer? Also, you're not a self-starter if you're asking for handouts.
@EWWWYUCKY @ltthompso Your profile picture is you with anime facial features, candy on your head, and you self-describe as a Marxist-Leninist, men who's ideas led to millions of deaths. Way to capture the high ground before calling someone a creep for pointing out something problematic about AOC.
@eastof_ordinary @ltthompso The issue isn't whether he's paying her power bottom it's the fact she gave him a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb email account for an unknown reason.
@GandalfTheFresh @ltthompso Ahh yet another brilliant troll piling on to something they don't understand because they blindly follow people like AOC.
@IPM_HQ @ltthompso You're advocating for socialism on Twitter using mass-produced free market candy as a meme. Do you realize how absolutely absurd your existence is?
@colbyklaus @ltthompso You work for a publication that begs for handouts on Patreon to survive.
@Jgarside4 @ltthompso Using the phrase "owned" to connote something bad happening to someone is disrespectful to the memory and  legacy of the ongoing negative effects of African-American slavery in the United States.
@Proteinevo @ltthompso Using white-collar to represent high-paying office jobs is racial-normative and biased.
@Blastgurl69 @SIippery_Slope @ltthompso Do you want a wave or do you want resistance? That's not how physics works.	You're a racist.
@eastof_ordinary @ltthompso How is this a valid response to evidence AOC is up to something?
@sothenkatiesays @ltthompso Your use of corn as an insult is degrading to the Native Americans who gave us corn as a peace offering. You should apologize.
@GandalfTheFresh @ltthompso In what way wizard?
@Bwanamaisha @ltthompso @AOC He's a ginger, doesn't matter how tall he is, he ain't cool.
AOC's excuse for giving her boyfriend a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb email account is that she wanted him to be able to see her Google calendar.	The #GreenNewDeal debacle now makes so much more sense.
@kimoco @ltthompso Luke's actually a pretty nice guy. He doesn't need to "CYA" since the phone number is public but you do you. I hope you women get your equal rights some day.
@Cryptoterra @ltthompso If one of your tweets causes someone to do something you don't want are you responsible?
@GeorgeTakei Better put this brilliance on a t-shirt and make a profit George!
@kimoco @ltthompso 1. He's not lying.	2. He asked people not to call.
@DRO_oDR @ltthompso Why did she call it a google calendar?
@nickeedee1 @DustinGinsberg @JStein_WaPo I literally worked there last year in the IT department (CAO), you can connect anything you want to it because members refuse to follow policy.
@DRO_oDR @ltthompso The only people who are tech illiterate are the ones that think you need a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb account to access a google calendar.
@kimoco @ltthompso https://t.co/xG5kv4LTQx	It's public information.
@sug_knight @ltthompso It's public information.
@nickeedee1 @DustinGinsberg @JStein_WaPo You just completely made this up. They use the same Outlook that anyone else uses, and they have BYOD policies so it doesn't have to be a special phone or computer at all.

@khandel84 @FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul @AOC Dude, you took a selfie with a baby changing table and used it as your avi. https://t.co/lA9M1m2wZf
@mattravis @ltthompso Ah just like Trump and his hotels is a non story because all politicians get rich off their offices. Awesome logic man.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC Yep, you got it. Enjoy helping AOC crusade against the evil Jewish capitalists.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC The ones you don't care about so I'm not going to waste my time googling them all and pasting them here for you. AOC is wrong and she knows it that's why she's lying about what she did.
@ProofByAccident @ltthompso What vetting process? Individual member offices can give email to whoever they want, it's a major security issue at House.
@mattravis @ltthompso Ahh so since it's common it's okay. Got it.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC Yea because I'm sure citing multiple House IT policies and regulations on nepotism and ethics would cause you to change your mind about AOC. Small D is right.
I thought the media's job was to speak truth to power, so why does it so often feel the need to defend politicians they like when they start spouting bullshit? https://t.co/sOw5RJmF2m
@mattravis @ltthompso So you don't care if Big Ginger has a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb account you only care if he's also getting paid to be her stud?
@ProofByAccident @ltthompso Ahh so she's undermining the https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb security controls. Cool story bro.
@ArcanePyro @ltthompso @dinovopj So AOC is just like the white supremacists? Is this supposed to make me like her more?
@NotMyLinkedIn @ltthompso It's common hill practice to give your power bottom a House email so he can check your Google calendar?
@Woodsy1069 @ltthompso Bigot.
@ProofByAccident @ltthompso Why would a .gov address be needed for a Google calendar?
@RealAnalysis_ @ltthompso You chose a bird with a cup on its head to represent yourself.
@Nightstokker @ltthompso Just because you spank it to a greasy haired high schooler doesn't mean Luke does. You're the one that had that gif ready to go sporto.
@ArcanePyro @ltthompso @dinovopj I'm not the one that doesn't understand technology if you think a .gov account is required to access a google calendar.
@FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul Yea I mean I still can't get over the fact that I'm getting tweeted at by a talking Fox.
@mattravis @ltthompso You're right man we should ignore potential wrongdoing by AOC until we can figure out if everyone else is wrong too.
@NotMyLinkedIn @ltthompso What does he not understand? That AOC's Ginger consort has a House email account for an unknown reason is beyond dispute.
@gideonjoe_nahh @ltthompso Oh LOL you so horny for Jared.
"Big Ginger needs a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb account to access a Gmail calendar" is a staggering level of ignorance of how this shit works. https://t.co/GtWzOQMEW1
@FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul Sure if it owns the libs in the long run.
@FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul @AOC How is it slimy? Congress doesn't answer to the people? If AOC is abusing her privileges and being a hypocrite she should have to answer for it.
@ArcanePyro @ltthompso In what way is he wrong? The nonsense you made up above is even more incoherent than her excuse.
@_smallstories @ltthompso Given the fact that she dates a big goofy ginger who clearly gets pegged she's not Luke's type.
@pangeranningrat @ltthompso You're like 5 feet tall and like horses and MMA, I'd say you know a lot about taking the L. https://t.co/DOOxhjwRP8
@DustinGinsberg @JStein_WaPo So you think https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb uses google calendars? How is Microsoft software running google web interfacing? Are you suggesting the House uses their House emails to register for Google calendars?
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC So first you advocate it's better he has a government email than a Gmail, now you say it doesn't matter and don't understand why it's a big deal. You're probably the kind of person who uses the same password on all their accounts and thinks the Russians hacked the election.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC Aww you called me a dummy. Your name is Hildawg genius. But I see you're also an Ilhan Omar fan. No accounting for taste.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC Well I mean AOC's defense was that she is letting him access a Google calendar, which implies she is conducting official business on Google if you want to go there. But she's lying so you're okay with a person with no government job haven't government email?
@AlexThomasDC The idiot here would the person choosing to ignore clear evidence that AOC's boyfriend is in the House Outlook server.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC Of course a Hillary support wouldn't understand the significance of government email access.
@DustinGinsberg @JStein_WaPo Why does he need a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb email address to access a Google calendar? If you believe her lie you're as loose with facts as she is.
@FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul So you're totally chill with AOC giving her boyfriend a government email account for...we don't know what reason?
@JStein_WaPo So your defense is her boyfriend having House network access is irreleveant because you didn't put it in your story?
@JStein_WaPo Why does an "aide for orientation" (which IS NOT  a thing) need a House email address?
@libbycwatson So are all the libs writing erotic fiction about Donald Trump and Ivanka horny for them?
@sabrina_acct @ltthompso Your avi is a teenage girl pretending to be a witch.
@FoxhartCapital @ltthompso @RandPaul In what way has AOC granting her boyfriend House network access been refuted?
@jtvrdik @ltthompso @AOC Reaching for what exactly? AOC's integrity? Because no one can find that so far. Whenever she is confronted with her BS she just lies more and attacks the person asking questions.
@hildawg2023 @ltthompso @AOC It doesn't matter if he's being paid, he walked in off the street and was given a https://t.co/cVusW3TVwb email address. And she's lying about it, so something's off here.

@Unpersuaded112 He knows the insane proposals in the GND won't play well with independent voters in swing states so he's forcing Democrats to commit to stupid ideas they were only pretending to support to impress donors before the primary.

@iadevaia16 @ltthompso You know you can do both. The media never admits any wrongdoing despite being woefully lopsided in how it covers politics. This is less about the politicos (Whitaker and Clinton both stonewalling for their own reasons) than the way the media spins their behavior.

@_maxvalley_ Ah yes the CFPB. I'm sure you're aware that the CFPB is an unaccountable executive branch agency that's lack of transparency means its effectiveness can't be measured? So much for the "millions" she's saved people. Or do you mean the self help books she pitched with Dr. Phil?
Periodic reminder that the British empire destroyed native language proficiency so completely in some places that the BBC publishes news in broken English for the people of West Africa.	https://t.co/KbgrPWjDQn
@_maxvalley_ When she gives away the portion of her fortune she doesn't need, sure she can stop being a hypocrite.	Also, the cute rhetorical tropes don't really advance your argument. Liz Warren is a bad candidate and a hypocrite. Period. She also lied about her ethnic background.
On a day of dumb things, this is one of the dumbest.	If I use the word bagels more often I am still gonna eat bacon. 	I also want to see the "pineapple leather" that will last my as long as my cowhide leather does. https://t.co/tVoodxCXfv
I love it. Criticize Liz Warren's hypocrisy and suddenly you hate the poor. 	Interesting logical path there. https://t.co/Gz5EAs7J2z
@_maxvalley_ I have never once dismissed someone without money's opinion, but I do dismiss someone with money when they're a hypocrite. Warren doesn't want people to become as rich as her, she wants those that aren't rich to be dependent and the rich she doesn't like to be penalized.

@jmhooksline @RWPUSA Trump being an ass is irrelevant. She did far more than just go with the family story (claiming Cherokee for employment, etc). Why feel the need to defend Warren's lies just because you hate Trump?
