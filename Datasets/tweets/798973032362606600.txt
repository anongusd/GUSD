As a law enforcement officer, I’ve stood at crime scenes and thought about families who had no idea that they would never see their loved one again. 		Background checks keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them.	https://t.co/VuYt5hpRsQ
Closing background check loopholes is so obvious, so uncontroversial (over 90% of public supports it), yet it took an historic Democratic majority to even get a vote. Says a lot about the power of the gun lobby...but it also proves they can be beaten. #ElectionsMatter
Over 90% of Americans (including gun owners) support #BackgroundChecks. Why? Because they WORK.		Since 1994 over 3 million dangerous people have been blocked from buying guns because of background checks. Simple. Effective. Fix the loopholes! #HR8 #EndGunViolence
The #Cohen hearings today are riveting and important (I'll have my own hearing with him tomorrow). But to change topics for a moment -- right now we're passing new, significant legislation to prevent gun violence by closing #BackgroundCheck loopholes. Huge news. #EndGunViolence

Real solutions are needed on the border—humane ones, worthy of a great country. Not tearing children from parents. Not a wall. #SOTU
The wall is a public-relations ploy that would not improve our safety, be easy to circumvent, require tens of billions of dollars, damage our reputation and moral authority, and require stealing land from American landowners. It’s yet another scam.
A wall is useless without people to guard it. Yet thousands of law enforcement officers were forced to work without pay during the shutdown.		The president shut down the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Coast Guard.
Most drugs are smuggled into the U.S. through legal ports of entry. Nearly 90% of the heroin, cocaine, meth, and fentanyl smuggled into the country comes through ports of entry (which are understaffed by the administration).
According to the Washington Post, as of July 2017, the State Department said there was “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.”
The “caravans” discussed by the President are families presenting themselves for asylum (which they have the legal right to do) at ports of entry, not crossing the desert.		More undocumented people are leaving the United States than entering it.
The President’s administration has chosen to not spend huge quantities of border security funding already allocated by Congress. There are thousands of officer vacancies at U.S. Ports of Entry.
President Trump’s descriptions of the border have completely lost touch with reality. #SOTU		A thread:
Congress has already passed bills to fund our government and secure our border. The president wanted a shutdown instead and he got one. I hope he learned his lesson from that mistake.
Sorry Mr. President, the investigations into your administration and campaign are a measured and careful response to what may have been illegal activity. This is exactly what Congress is supposed to do: hold the executive branch accountable. #SOTU
I’m glad to hear President Trump speak about the middle class but so far we’ve seen little but broken promises—rising healthcare costs, a tax break for the wealthy, and a shutdown that hurt working families. The American people need results, not more promises. #SOTU
Nearly 100 years after women earned the right to vote, more than 100 women are serving in Congress. Tonight the @HouseDemWomen are wearing suffragette white to remind the president that we—and the rights our ancestors fought for—aren't going anywhere. #SOTU #SOTU2019 https://t.co/ZkFDdj5YxV

Today @HouseJudiciary discussed #HR1, the #ForThePeople act to restore the promise of our democracy and protect the fundamental American right to vote, for ALL people. I hope that Congress will pass this bill soon, and restore to us a government for the people, by the people.
And so if we're serious about America being the greatest country in the world, then we all should play a role in making it easier for our citizens—regardless of their race, sexual orientation, gender—to exercise their basic right.
The men and women who passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 didn't do so because there WASN'T a problem. And when we talk about "that was old" and "that's in the past"—no. That was in my lifetime. And it was in the lifetimes of several of the members of the Judiciary Committee.
How long will we have to still—as we sit here in 2019—continue to have to defend a person's right to cast their vote?
Let me remind you about black and brown people who simply wanted to exercise their right to vote. Many of them were the victims of hangings, beatings, burnings, bombings, dismemberments, disfigurements—all for wanting to exercise their basic right.	https://t.co/MVjCkD3BZ4

The Democratic Congress has already voted to extend immediately back-pay to everyone who was denied their paychecks. We must not put them in this position ever again. #ForThePeople
This shutdown has proven that our country relies every day on the vital work of our federal employees. They keep our food and skies safe, prevent crime and terrorism, and provide life-and-death services upon which millions of Americans rely.
Today’s deal is the short-term extension that Democrats have already passed, and that I have voted for. The Senate unanimously passed the same plan before the President changed his mind and rejected it, saying ‘I’m proud to shut down the government.’
The President just agreed to the same bipartisan deal he originally rejected when he shut down the government. Put simply, he caved. 		This whole reckless shutdown could have been avoided. Now we need to make sure that American families never have to go through this again.

The blight of white supremacy on our great country has tainted our history, taken the lives of our loved ones, and threatens our future. It is, as Dr. King said, a 'thing that matters.' We will not be silent. Not today, not ever.	 	Happy birthday to a true King.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., born 90 years ago today, said that "our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter." Today the House voted to formally condemn white nationalism and its resident defender, Steve King.
Today is Dr. King's birthday. He called on all of us to "enlist in a crusade finally to make the race question an ugly relic of a dark past." If we are great nation, we all must exercise our power, and take a stand so strong that even the white supremacists can't ignore it. https://t.co/bqXfx0busW

The community has provided help, but it's not enough. Money is running out, and they're starting to worry about what comes next. Hundreds of thousands of families are in the same situation as Ralph's. They all deserve better. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/ve9Njyw4pQ
Ralph told my office that their family is triaging bills, delaying whatever they can to protect the essentials – food, water, light. He's reached out to their mortgage company and other creditors to try to ask for delays until he's paid again, but so far everyone has said no. https://t.co/trPHS5K7Gz
Ralph is an 11-year @USArmy vet who has spent 5 years keeping us safe at @MCO. Now, because of the #TrumpShutdown, he’s working without pay. They have a son in the 4th grade, one in college, and one with special needs. His family is struggling to make ends meet. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/iegLWhMeO5
Confused about the government shutdown? That's ok! Here are the facts: House Democrats have voted seven times and counting to reopen the government and make sure it works #ForThePeople.		Let's review the timeline of the #TrumpShutdown: https://t.co/DTuagJgijv
The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government. The Senate previously passed bipartisan funding legislation but now @SenateGOP refuses. The problem is Trump. This shutdown is having a real impact on working families, like Brandon's. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/DNH8DiiH8o
Here's Doug's message to President Trump and to Congress: "these are safety-related positions, and the added stress has a real impact. Please find a resolution soon. My family is counting on it." https://t.co/jt30if9fl2
Their daughter is going to college soon. They want to throw an 18th birthday party this month, but finances are shaky. If the shutdown drags on and the local training facility remains closed, Doug might be forced to travel for work, forcing him to miss her high school graduation.
Doug's mother has schizophrenia, and he helps take care of her. They've also got the same expenses as millions of other families - a mortgage, car payments, and the daily expenses that pile up all too quickly. https://t.co/pgUUCdURxN
Doug keeps over 300 pieces of sensitive equipment operational for @MCO, including the auto-pilot landing systems. He's no stranger to stress after five years in the @USMC, but the #TrumpShutdown means he's working without a paycheck, "adding to the stress of an stressful job." https://t.co/78Ack3R8q1

I will continue working to reopen the government and restore pay to America’s hardworking federal employees. I will also continue working for smart, effective, and compassionate border security.
With the money President Trump would waste on a monument to his broken promise, we could double federal money for high-quality child care. We could pay for universal pre-k education for every family &amp; invest in school safety and security. We could triple grants for job training.
The GOP, which has controlled Congress for the past two years, chose not to fund the border wall. I think they did not believe the President was serious. Plus, “the deal” never included taxpayers dollars, but President Trump said that “Mexico is going to pay for the wall.”
Congress has already allocated significant funding for border security, which the administration has chosen NOT TO SPEND! There are currently over 2,100 UNFILLED jobs at border crossings and airports.
The only crisis on the border is the one that President Trump has created by falsifying reports to instill fear, imprisoning children and separating families, and failing to hire enough officers to do the job.
Critical federal services have stopped, including airplane &amp; food safety inspections, and the processing of tax refunds. National parks are filling up with trash. Millions of families could be evicted from their homes. Food assistance for needy children is running out of money.
As a result of the #TrumpShutdown, paychecks for over 800,000 Americans will not go out today. Families living paycheck-to-paycheck will struggle to pay their mortgages and make ends meet. Many families will go into debt. Local businesses have been impacted.
Some thoughts on the #TrumpShutdown, which is hurting millions of American families.		21 days ago, President Trump shut down the government when he refused to sign bipartisan legislation, saying “I am proud to shut down the government” and “I will be the one to shut it down.”

Congress has already agreed on a bipartisan deal to fund the government. Trump rejected it, opting to govern by temper tantrum. It’s time for the president to stop holding the American people hostage. Families deserve real bipartisan solutions to get our country working again.
The President couldn’t get Mexico to pay for his wall. He couldn’t get Congress to pick the pockets of the American people. The GOP, which could have passed wall funding at any time over the past two years, knew it was an unreasonable idea.
The only crisis on the border is the one that President Trump has created by falsifying reports to instill fear, imprisoning children and separating families, and failing to hire enough officers to staff ports of entry.
While the government remains shut down and hundreds of thousands of American families worry about making ends meet without a paycheck, President Trump tonight offered nothing new, only more fear-mongering and the continuation of a self-inflicted crisis.

This kind of high-stakes political game is unacceptable. We're here to serve the American people, not use children's healthcare as a bargaining chip. That can never happen again. /end
Third, I must also call out my GOP colleagues in Congress, who this year allowed CHIP (children's healthcare for low/middle-income families) to lapse for 114 days as a negotiating ploy, causing many families to drop out of the program.
Second, Florida MUST expand Medicaid. Our state is losing $5 billion per year in federal funds to expand healthcare for 750,000 Floridians. Instead, our tax dollars are going to other states!
First, we need to make it easier to sign up for health insurance, not harder. The administration's sabotage of the ACA needs to end.
The number of children in Florida without health insurance just shot up. Please forgive a long thread, but this issue is hugely important:		https://t.co/ffccEzZBHN

More than anything, we need a return to unity around shared values, responsible leadership, &amp; ethical politics which discourages violence as a means to resolve our differences. In troubled times Americans look to the Oval Office for leadership, but sadly the President is missing.
President Trump has encouraged, excused, and alluded to violence repeatedly, including against the specific people targeted this week. Trump’s refusal to take responsibility or stop the use of violent rhetoric is inexcusable and dangerous.
Bombings and violence of any kind are unacceptable. We all know this. Whomever sent these bombs will be found and brought to justice.		The ultimate guilt lies with the bomber. But there is a sickness in our politics that goes beyond this string of attacks.

If appointed, Kavanaugh has indicated that he will protect President Trump against the Russia investigation. This is self-serving corruption all around. https://t.co/I6veX2hD6b
Actions speak louder than words. The GOP effort to ram through Kavanaugh in the face of credible sexual assault allegations, without investigation or expert witnesses, speaks for itself. #KavanuaghHearings https://t.co/W0hwk1jPms
Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is not just about men and women. It's about wealth and status, &amp; certain people thinking they can get away with anything. Well, no one is above the law and with the strength of the  #MeToo movement, women’s voices are more powerful than ever.

President Trump is feeling the heat and there is no doubt that he will do anything in his power to save himself. His personal lawyer, Campaign Manager, Deputy Campaign Manager, National Security Adviser, and a top aide have all pleaded guilty to federal crimes. Congress must act.

We're in a search for the truth. Five members of President Trump's inner circle have already pleaded guilty to federal crimes. He's feeling the pressure. The Mueller investigation - which has been independent, fair, and effective - must continue without interference.
Whether or not Deputy AG Rosenstein supported using the 25th Amendment, he doesn't have the power to do so. That's up to the Vice President and the Cabinet. So the question is, what does Vice President Pence think?
Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein denies the new claims about the 25th Amendment. I don't know if he said it or not. Neither does President Trump. The President cannot use this as an excuse to disrupt Mueller's Russia investigation.

Americans don't deserve for their premiums to go up, and people with pre-existing conditions don't deserve to face astronomical out-of-pocket costs. #Trumpcare would have used its “savings” to give tax breaks to the richest in America. https://t.co/Z5rSitUfmu
Health care should be a right for all, not a privilege for some. The Republican Party has ignored the voices of millions of Americans by attempting to push through a disastrous bill would have caused 24 million people to lose coverage.

Yesterday’s White House statement, written three weeks ago, is a clear distraction, but will cause real damage. President Trump’s purges and punishments of his political critics are undemocratic and un-American.
His attack on a career public servant, however, takes the President’s maliciousness to a new level and will do lasting harm to our country’s freedom and security.
And let’s not forget he called a breastfeeding mother ‘disgusting,’ said that women who complained about his sexual harassment were not attractive enough for him, referred to a U.S. Secretary of State as a “nasty woman,” and bragged about grabbing women by their genitals.

Workers deserve fair pay, decent benefits, and the freedom to retire with dignity. That’s why I support the Workers’ Freedom to Negotiate Act. #ABetterDeal #ProtectWorkers https://t.co/Cs5fClKmRJ

So please, don't preach to the American people about "qualifications" when Judge Garland, one of the most qualified judicial nominees in American history, was not even awarded the respect of a hearing. #ScotusPick
In 2016, Judge Kavanaugh himself called Judge Garland "supremely qualified" for the Supreme Court. https://t.co/o91jCmpZWg
During Garland's hearings in 1997, one Republican Senator said, "I believe Mr. Garland is a fine nominee. I know him personally, I know of his integrity, I know of his legal ability, I know of his honesty, I know of his acumen...In fact, I would place him at the top of the list."
The American Bar Association wrote that Garland "is considered a model lawyer, judge and person," that his "outstanding professional competence is exceptional," and that "he meets the highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament." https://t.co/xVsZexx3jw
Merrick Garland graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law. He joined the D.C. Circuit Court in 1997 (the same the court Brett Kavanaugh joined 9 years later), and is its Chief Judge. In 20 years and over 350 lead opinions, his decisions were never once overturned as incorrect.

On #NationalPostalWorkerDay, I want to acknowledge, Ms. Joan Kelsey, a @USPS associate in the Longworth House Office Building. She has served in the United States Post Service for nearly 25 years, including working in the mail center at the White House. https://t.co/nxqdJ7YPt2
It was converted into a post office in 1953, after a fire which destroyed Ochopee's previous post office located in the Gaunt Company Store. The post office is currently fully functional, serving the surrounding populations of Miccosukee and Seminole Indians.
#NationalPostalWorkerDay: The Ochopee Post Office is the smallest post office in the United States. It is a tiny shed on U.S. Route 41 near Ochopee, #Florida. The building used to be a storage facility for irrigation pipes of an adjacent tomato farm. @USPS https://t.co/PAj1VJUYiY
This is the America I know and believe in. More than 700 marches, from immigrant-friendly cities like NY and LA to conservative Appalachia and Wyoming came together to say  #FamiiesBelongTogether and #FamilySeperation is immoral and unAmerican.

Families are living in motels from NY to FL. They have been cooking makeshift meals in microwaves, doing homework in hotel lobbies and figuring out how to survive afterwards. We need to continue to find ways to help these families, not rush to evict them after losing everything. https://t.co/YnNar6gZ8d

When asked where the girls and toddlers are being held, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen didn’t know. She should know. The number of girls under the age of 18 apprehended at the border this fiscal year was 13,008 compared to last year’s 7,339. Where are they?	#FamilesBelongTogether
Many of the migrant girls came to the U.S. to flee the violence back home. Tearing them away from their families exacerbates their trauma. 		Furthermore, None of the images of detained migrant children pictured girls. Is there something to hide? 		#FamiliesBelongTogether
Where are the children? Is there a log for where they are and who are their parents? What are the conditions and required training/background checks for those with access to the children? Americans deserve an answer. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Children do not belong in cages, nor detention centers. Parents don’t deserve to not be aware of where their children are. That is why this weekend’s #FamiliesBelongTogether march matters. 		We must begin reuniting families. Stop #FamilySeparation.
The families at our border need help, we have must continue to take a stand for the hundreds of children who were cruelly ripped away from their parents. #FamiliesBelongTogether.
#CentralFL, I hear you. I've received several calls asking how many of you can help the separated families beyond giving. Here is a sampling of volunteer opportunities for those who wish to help w/ families separation at the Border. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/7ZS7BLkHKo
It’s appalling that this administration tore thousands of children from their parents without a single thought of how to reunite them. So much damage has already been done. But we can prevent more. Family reunification must begin immediately. #FamilesBelongTogetherMarch
The American people are marching for the soul of our country, and Congress must listen. It’s just a first step to say “this is wrong.” We need immediate action to reunite families and stop incarcerating children. #FamiliesBelongTogetherMarch

If working people can’t retire in security, if a health crisis bankrupts your family, if you have to work until the day you die, then we have abandoned the American Dream.
When healthcare is more expensive, when #Medicare and #Medicaid are cut, it will cause preventable deaths and bankrupt families.
The average FL family – working ppl are paying an increase in their healthcare costs nearly four times larger than their meager tax cut. Now, after gutting our healthcare system to line their pockets, the GOP is doubling down, proposing shocking cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.
But the GOP tax plan is making it harder to support your family, raising your healthcare costs, putting your right to manage your own health further out of reach, and threatening millions of families with insurmountable debt and bankruptcy.

97% of Americans support that idea, yet Congress has done nothing. We have not implemented universal waiting periods, which 83% of Americans support, because we know that if someone needs a gun at once, it probably means trouble. #PulseOrlando #PulseRemembranceDay
Our job as legislators is to create laws which allow Americans to live their lives in safety and security. Two years after Pulse, we have not done that job. We have not closed the loopholes which allow disturbed people to buy a gun with no background check. #PulseOrlando
Every American should have the right to go to school, or church, or a mall or a movie theater – or a nightclub – without being brutally murdered or wounded by someone with a gun. #PulseOrlando
To watch: https://t.co/dwq7D78cyW https://t.co/fpnaxbF6q4
We will not forget those who lost their lives. We will not forget our neighbors and friends still recovering from devastating injuries, whether mental or physical. We will grieve, we will remember, and we will strengthen the ties that bind our community into one family.
Today, we can transform our sorrow into love and progress. We can protect and promote true safe spaces for the LGBTQ and Latinx population. We can work to prevent any more gun violence in our community. #PulseOrlando
Orlando lost 49 lives that night. We lost 49 lives that night. Many others had their lives forever changed. After the attack, we saw our community come together. We donated blood together, raised money together, mourned together. #PulseOrlando
They were living their lives, taking refuge in song and dance and joy, celebrating their common humanity at a time when the common humanity of LGBTQ Americans was not, and it still not, universally recognized in our country. #PulseOrlando #OrlandoStrong
This is what I want to emphasize: The victims at Pulse, like every other mass shooting, were not in ‘the wrong place at the wrong time.’ They were exactly where they were supposed to be. #PulseOrlando #OrlandoStrong
For the men and women at Pulse two years ago, the nightclub was a refuge. It was a haven for our LGBTQ community, and particularly the Latinx LGBTQ community as they gathered to celebrate Latin Night. It was a place for what my Bishop likes to call late-night fellowship.
The Pulse attacks was the second-worst mass shooting in modern American history, the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11, and the worst attack against the LGBTQ population in our history. #PulseOrlando
I am speaking on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives right now to honor the victims of the #Pulse shooting. As the world’s most powerful legislative body, we have to take action. #OrlandoStrong

Guns in the wrong hands kill innocent people. We cannot be satisfied with simply remembering the victims of mass shootings. We must work to prevent mass shootings, period.
I was honored to invite first responder Officer Adam Gruler and his wife Jaimi as my guests to the State of the Union earlier this year. I am proud to have worked on legislation to support enhanced mental health treatment and prevent future mass shootings.
The pain is overwhelming, but we must learn to transform it into love, progress and action. We were blessed to have a Pulse survivor as an intern in my office last year.
Two years after our community was devastated by the Pulse shooting, I believe more strongly than ever that love will win. I want to say to all of the survivors and families that we are with you, we support you, and we will never forget you.

Yesterday, The @CDCgov reported suicide rates in the U.S. are on the rise. Nearly 45,000 Americans age 10 or older died by suicide in 2016, making it the 10th leading cause of death. We have to take a comprehensive public health approach to suicide prevention.
More police officers die by suicide than in the line of duty. In 2017 there were an estimated 140 law enforcement suicides. We cannot ask our officers to do this dangerous and stressful work without also helping them live through the consequences.

Enough is enough. Students shouldn't have to live w/ the idea of being gunned down. We must protect students from #gunviolence. Below is a list of elementary, middle &amp;high schools resulted in fatalities, from 1927 to the present. This list is long! There shouldn't even be a list!
We have a choice as consumers of media to promote messages of tolerance or of prejudice. In these divisive times we can all use a little more love and less hate. Never give racist behavior a pass. https://t.co/QzsvrOZlhN
#OnThisDay: Sojourner Truth's most famous, improvised speech on racial inequalities "Ain't I A Woman?" was delivered in 1851 at a Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. https://t.co/GuCJoUXCHS

The threat of Kremlin-orchestrated aggression is present: 13 Russians and three companies have been indicted for interfering w/ the 2016 election, and Russia has continued its campaigns of disinformation, propaganda, and political &amp;military pressure against U.S. allies/interests.
Russia has attacked our democracy, and those of our allies, and we’re not going to sit on our hands and wait for it to happen again. I’m glad that two provisions from our bipartisan bill have been added to the NDAA, one step closer to becoming law.
Last week, I introduced the bipartisan ‘Defend Against Russian Disinformation Act.’ Many of my colleagues and I voted to include two provisions from that bill as bipartisan amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

Fast forward, 50 years later, social discord is still dividing the country. From hostility between law enforcement and black/brown communities, to tension toward immigrant groups, to distrust of the media by rural and marginalized communities - the country is much divided.
#Media is the most influential source of news and entertainment for most Americans, and controls how our society views and treats one another. In 1968, the Kerner Commission Report highlighted media’s role in worsening social discord, and recommended increased diversity.

At a time when social cohesion and active citizenship is so needed, we have to encourage media diversity. When we don't, a lack of diversity harms us as a nation, in particular, further isolates marginalized communities - threatening the democracy our framers sought to achieve.
At the heart of this experiment, we call the United States are the inalienable rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Active citizenship serves as the glue that binds individuals of different races and cultures together into a functioning democracy. #Media #Diversity
The absence of small independent and multicultural media outlets means less community and civic engagement. What dispirits us is their combined negative impact on self-perception, which can lead to the decay of one's ability to thrive economically, socially or politically. #Media

Without law enforcement, our society would break down. We cannot tolerate the brutal murder of police officers. I support this bill, and other efforts to keep our officers safe.
I support the Protect and Serve Act because I am concerned by the number of ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers we've seen this year. Law enforcement is a thin blue line. There's only handful of folks willing to do a very tough job.
I am extremely disappointed that the Judiciary Committee has chosen to do absolutely nothing to address hiring guidelines, community policing strategies, training, and use of force standards. High standards for law enforcement protect both our officers and our citizens.
I am keenly aware of troubling incidents involving the use of force by some officers around the county. The overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties admirably under the toughest of circumstances. But not all do, and we have a duty to hold them accountable.
Yesterday, I urged my colleagues to support the Protect and Serve Act. I spent 27 years in law enforcement and had the honor of serving as Orlando’s Chief of Police. I love my prior profession and adore the men and women in blue who do a very tough job.

6,400 workers in FL are Honduran TPS holders. In the two decades that they have lived in the United States, they've contributed to our nation. Hondurans deserve to find peace and security, especially after being impacted by a natural disaster. They don't deserve to be shut out. https://t.co/HaHlqkNNOe
There are 7,800 Hondurans in FL who are TPS holders, many of them have lived in the United States for an average of 23 years. As many as 5,100 have U.S.-born children. No child deserves to be torn a part from their parents, especially after a natural disaster.
If you're being impacted by Sec. Kristjen's decision to not extend TPS, keep in mind that you have one last chance to apply for TPS for 18 months. Sadly, you will lose your protections on January 5, 2020, which means you will not be able to work in the US as of that date.
60,000 Honduran working people just had their Temporary Protected Status taken away. Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen's bad decision to extend TPS to families in the wake of humanitarian disasters in their home countries is inhumane. Of that 60K, 57K have been living in the US for 20 years.

A student panelist said, "a text book fell down and one of her classmates immediately dropped to the floor, put her hands behind her head and assumed a non-threatening positioning." Students should not have to live w/ the fear of mass destruction. #GunViolence #RepDemingsTownHall
We asked #FL10 students what would make them feel safe at school? They all said that there should be a level of consistency when it comes to making sure that there are laws in place to protect them. I agree. #GunViolence #RepDemingsTownHall

On Friday, our community shared their experiences at a town hall meeting on gun violence. On Saturday, we marched in the #MarchForOurLives. Now it’s time for Congress to act. Read my new op-ed here: https://t.co/8lT9iWIRZT
Every American has the right to be safe going out to a nightclub, to a restaurant, to a concert or movie theater or a park. It's vital that we protect our children and our schools. But #GunSafety is about so much more. It's about building safe communities. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/AVIkQVVzcc
Yesterday I attended the #MarchForOurLives rally and stood with my fellow Americans to call for action on gun safety. We do not have to live and die as if #GunViolence is unavoidable. #AmericansAgree: we can do something about it. https://t.co/LpYfGEK5RN
Gun Violence Restraining Orders would empower law enforcement to work with families to retrieve guns from loves ones threatening violence against themselves or others. I’ve cosponsored a bill to expand these programs. #AmericansAgree on common sense solutions like this.

Today I attended the #MarchForOurLives. We want change. We want #GunSafety. We want to protect our communities from #GunViolence. #AmericansAgree on fundamental solutions. https://t.co/iPHBvbUUIm
As a former law enforcement officer, our job was to enforce laws to protect the innocent. As representatives of the American people, our job is to create laws to protect the innocent. It’s time for Congress to act. #AmericansAgree #MarchForOurLives
187,000 America children have experienced a #SchoolShooting. The #Parkland survivors have asked the important question: why should we live—and die—as if this was normal? #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/rbrDJRhsKt
Americans are taking the issue of gun violence into their own hands. The truth is, when we strip away all the politics, Americans agree on gun safety. We want to see Congress and the President act. https://t.co/KV8KlmuTkj
Orlando has felt the pain of mass shootings. I am proud of the work the #Pulse survivors have done to keep this issue alive. They and the #Parkland survivors are going to change the world. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/zBzHDLWgnj
Giving guns to teachers to stop school shootings is preposterous. This would lead to taxpayer-sponsored shootouts by out-skilled and out-gunned teachers, with children in the crossfire. See my speech on this issue here. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/gE7YuEOy68
67% of Americans support an assault weapons ban. We can also ban modifications like ‘bump stocks’ and silencers which make guns deadlier in mass-shooting situations. #AmericansAgree #MarchForOurLives
83% of Americans support waiting periods for gun purchases, because we know that if someone needs a gun at once, it probably means trouble. #AmericansAgree #MarchForOurLives
#AmericansAgree on #GunSafety: 97% of us support closing the loopholes that allow disturbed people to buy a gun with no background check. Every gun sale should have a background check. #MarchForOurLives
The men, women, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters gunned down in our country deserve remembrance. They also deserve courage from their leaders. They deserve action from their leaders. #AmericansAgree #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/XYzL341ZcU
Last night, before the #MarchForOurLives, I held a #GunTownHall meeting to hear from our neighbors. I heard over and over that our families deserve action. I agree. #AmericansAgree
Our town hall on #GunViolence/#GunSafety is about to begin at @valenciacollege. Tune in live at 7:00pm on my Facebook page to hear from both sides as we seek solutions: https://t.co/6Dswqx7vGn https://t.co/B1HmwU0UWs
Instead of responding to mass shootings, we should prevent them. As a chief of police, my goal was to stop #GunViolence from occurring in the first place. #AmericansAgree: our goal as a country should be the same.
We don’t have to end gun violence overnight. As President Reagan, a shooting survivor, said: “if the passage of [a bill] were to result in a reduction of only 10 or 15 percent [of gun deaths], it would be well worth making it the law of the land.” https://t.co/OP5DaqpoMy

I'm glad @marcorubio has come out in support of #GVRO, now we need to take the next steps and get it done. I urge him to put his words into action and push his GOP colleagues to bring this lifesaving proposal up for a vote. https://t.co/K0SrwpkxpR
@Brettwilson_6 Brett, I appreciate your thoughtful comments.
@Brettwilson_6 Thoughts and prayers are necessary, and the world could use more of both. I prayed for the victims and their families. But that's not enough. What we need now is action.
Don’t let the #NRA tell you there is no way to prevent school shootings. The #GVRO Act could let law enforcement act on warning signs to save lives. It’s time to act. #NeverAgain #HonorWithAction https://t.co/OGjpqh1jl8

The best gift we can give our teachers and students is to pass legislation that keeps deadly guns out of the hands of bad people. Thoughts and Prayers are good. I am told God will order our steps but we have to move our feet!
Doing so only shifts OUR responsibility to them as well as the hurt, pain, and guilt, and possibly liability when they find themselves out skilled and outgunned in active shooter situations.
A Message to Lawmakers-	What happened in Parkland was a horrible tragedy. But I ask you to please not even entertain any ridiculous legislation like arming our Principals and Teachers.

Then, in 1993, she became one of the first class of black members of Congress from Florida since reconstruction. She advocated fiercely for her constituents, helped rebuild after Hurricane Andrew, and led lasting changes for her community and her country.
She came back, and worked at Miami-Dade Community College, where she helped lead the effort to finally integrate the school. Then, she defeated 12 other candidates to be elected to the Florida Legislature. She would become the first black woman in the Florida Senate.
The daughter of sharecroppers and granddaughter of slaves, she was the youngest of 12 children. She supported her family, went to college, then had to leave the state for graduate school because Florida had banned black students.

In the midst of a national drug crisis it is shameful that the GOP Congress has failed to fund these vital priorities. https://t.co/RAi8Iy3K3P
82% of Community Health Centers, including Orange Blossom, offer mental health or substance abuse treatment. Orange Blossom has helped over 300 people with opioid addiction, and provides vital psychotropic drug therapy.
Community Health Centers save the healthcare system billions of dollars every year, and are often the only source of care for low-income families. 75% of Orange Blossom's patients lack health insurance. 90% of Florida’s CHC patients are low-income.
Those patients will clog emergency rooms or wind up in jail after experiencing a mental health episode from lack of medication. 1.4 million Floridians and 27 million Americans are at risk because of Congress' inaction.
In September, the GOP in Congress let funding run out for community health centers like at Orange Blossom Family Health. Without Orange Blossom, 15,000 Central Floridians could lose healthcare.

As a Police Chief, I balanced budgets, but I also knew that the purpose of the budget was to ensure security for families. The question when considering deficit spending is: what is non-negotiable? Children's healthcare? Non-negotiable. Tax cuts for huge corporations? No way.
The #GOPTaxScam explodes the deficit to help billionaires and huge corporations. Well, if the GOP doesn’t actually care about the deficit (as they like to claim), I know how else we can spend that money: by helping working people instead.
Let me clear this up for my Republican colleagues: if you’re going to flip-flop on deficit spending, try to flip flop in the direction of working families, not the obscenely wealthy.
Call me old school, but if we’re going to spend trillions of dollars, it should be on something that helps working families and the middle class. If it worked for FDR, it can work for us. #GOPTaxScam #TaxCutsandJobsAct
Next year, the Republicans will try to cut Social Security and Medicare “because of the deficit.” They will leave out the fact that they’re voting today for $1.5 trillion in deficit spending to line the pockets of themselves and their donors. It's dishonest and wrong. #GOPTaxScam

My statement on the passage of the Senate Tax Scam: https://t.co/XFWJjhLF3x
There’s a reason the Republicans passed it in the middle of the night: they were embarrassed, and they should be.		This outrage won't go unanswered. We will fight back for working families.
Early this morning, Senate Republicans voted to give over a trillion dollars to the super rich at the expense of students, seniors, and families. This bill will cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and it will raise your healthcare costs.
