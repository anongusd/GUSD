Why do we hate people who make money? They aren’t stealing it from anyone but we know Obama and the other hacks are pushing how immoral being rich is and how it’s so unfair and we need all this “fairness”

Constitutional conservatives do not fall on the right-left political spectrum. Following the constitution should not be a left-right issue. Classic liberal constitutionalism is stronger than any ideology
@DailyCaller That doesn’t infringe on anything
Faux News Sunday is an embarrassment to conservatives. The show just trots along with the liberal narrative. Chris Wallace has no independent thought

@ShyamPrasadRao1 @vi7jay @spectatorindex Agreed. They should have taken tactics and grand strategy into this list. Which I think makes or breaks ones military. Remember when everyone was so afraid of Saddam’s military?
@Ozkok_ Pathetic
@vi7jay @spectatorindex I get what you’re saying. India’s air forces is clearly organized differently compared to the French. But I’d take the Rafale over any SU-30s and MIGs that the Indians have.
@PoliticalShort I’m starting to wonder what routes congress can take to limit the ability and freedom of operation some of these foreign media organizations use to influence and propagandize our system
@BrakeOli @spectatorindex Yeah, no it’s obviously not scientific or a using a complex formulation of criteria to judge these nations.
Tired of amateur revisionist historians running around twitter. The primary sources and official accounts are out there. Go read a book.
@HenDoxs @SohrabAhmari Go read a book and get off your horse
@spectatorindex India should be behind France. No way their AirPower can match French AirPower
Europeans hate American for the most part. They think America is the problem in the world. Not the domination of socialism and government centric policies that crush the individual’s liberty and ability to choose their own outcomes. So it is Europeans who need to re-evaluate.
