The report also reaffirms what scientists have been saying for decades: Climate change will continue to put people‚Äôs health at risk. Respiratory illnesses will become more severe. Extreme heat will threaten the most vulnerable. And the economic burden will be catastrophic.
The report emphasizes that the faster we reduce emissions by transitioning to clean energy, the less risk we face. But the Trump admin. has doubled down on its support of the fossil fuel industry, and work to roll back some of our country's most ambitious climate policies.
The findings stand in sharp contrast to the administration‚Äôs rollback agenda and repeated denial of climate change. The message of the report is clear: human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, is causing climate change.

This is no time to hand polluters the keys to our natural resources. We recently learned that we have a decade to correct our path of climate change - now is not the time to expand drilling operations.
No matter how precautious, where you drill, you spill. Hilcorp Energy, the private company pushing for this approval, has a terrible track record with spills and leaks.
This is a major operation likely to disturb the environment for future generations - including the creation of a 9-acre gravel island to sync up with drilling operations.
Secretary Zinke approved drilling operations in the Arctic with great fanfare last week. Here's why that's a terrible idea:
