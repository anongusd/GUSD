@rep_stevewomack https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC did you speak on behalf of the 64,000 military Widows being robbed every month? No wait. You spoke out AGAINST them in House budget committee markup. A ret colonel 30 yrs can receive $7,500 a mo You spoke against $606 being given to mil surviving spouses
@rep_stevewomack https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC the wealthy are only wealthy because of those willing to fight for and die for freedom.  you find $ for them and not those that gave their life? Rich are richer 💰 and military surviving spouses continue to be robbed. Shame on you
@rep_stevewomack https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC my husband earned his mili retired pay same as you. What makes him less worthy? Unlike you he was 100% service disabled and not able to hold another job and enjoy life. Approx 7500.00 mo retired pay to you and you say no to $606 to widows
https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC the funding for this amendment would be taking back some of the tax cuts for the wealthy and giving it to Gold Star Families and military surviving spouses. Wealthy are only wealthy because of freedom fought and died for.

$606 a month per military surviving spouses is what they are being robbed of every month. A congressman makes that in a day and a half. What have they given in the name of freedom? https://t.co/7gxlySZV8y
@NancyPelosi https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC this needs the attention of the House Minority Leader. Congressman Yarmuth is trying to do good work and he needs help from his party! Especially the Party leader!  This isn’t supposed to be a partisan issue!
@mjhegar https://t.co/9AaAZOLNW5 this negatively affected over 700 offset widows in Texas District 31. Texas has the largest number of offset widows in the United States. Over 8% of the 64,000 live in Texas and neither Senator will cosponsor legislation that ends it.
@RepDianeBlack https://t.co/9AaAZOLNW5 reaching out to the people of TN to make sure they see this article.
@RepWesterman https://t.co/9AaAZOLNW5  military widows/ers aren’t going to continue to be treated this way.  Fists are SWINGING!  Our spouses were warriors...WARRIORS!  We can be too!
@rep_stevewomack https://t.co/9AaAZOLNW5 didn’t take long for the fighting widows to make it known to people in Arkansas.
@nj11forchange https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC this is beyond anything I’ve ever seen. Choosing the Wealthy over  the ones dying for this country and making that wealth possible.
@RepJimRenacci @housebudgetGOP https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC  but you voted against the amendment that would allow Gold Star Families to receive what it rightfully theirs. Wealthy over fighters for freedom. They are only wealthy because of the ones fighting and dying for freedom.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC this is what happened when the dems on the house budget committee offered up a funding source to give Gold Star Families what is owed to them. Funding source: take back some of the tax cuts the wealthy received.
@SenDonnelly https://t.co/u4HrToflSo this is directly linked to the SBP-DIC offset. He is Being forced to pay for an insurance annuity (SBP) that his surviving spouse will never collect because it is LEGALLY prohibited from paying out because his death will be service connected!
@SenDonnelly https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC an interesting read. Funding source would have been taking back some of the tax break from the wealthiest. Choosing the wealthy over the widows of dead soldiers. Widows of dead soldiers can’t make campaign contributions.

@rep_stevewomack https://t.co/Pq8y9rVuNC I get that voting yes on this amendment would have taken money from the rich and given to widows of the ones that make it possible for the rich to get rich. Could you have come up with an alternative source of funding?

@RepThomasMassie What does Congress plan on doing? Legislate it out of them??
@ukn96 @RepJohnYarmuth @housebudgetGOP In 2008 SSIA was created to slowly phase out the offset. It increased to $310 (took 10 yrs) which is a fourth of what it should be. They permanently extended it and capped it at $310 with each year a COLA. They wanted to say this “fixed” it. Not even close.

@virginiavfw @MarkWarner @timkaine https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN why do they not consider stopping this theft of a purchased income annuity important? It’s Purchased by those we “honor” on Memorial Day. Why is this ok with Senators Kaine and Warner?   They Will not cosponsor S 339 to end it.
@CNN @CNNOpinion https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN we honor them and then steal from their widows. No more parades. No more flags on graves. Show true honor and respect for their sacrifice by ending this disgraceful “widows tax”
@AmericanLegion @RepKinzinger https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN there is no honor for them as long as the theft of their purchased insurance annuity continues. Our nation STEALS from the most vulnerable...Widows of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Disgraceful.
@timkaine https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Many contacts to your office have gone unanswered on why you allow this theft of a purchased insurance annuity. You have 4,051 in your state you’re responsible for. Are you going to help them? Cosponsor         S 339 to stop this DISGRACE.
@timkaine https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN the scripture is also very clear about the treatment of widows Exodus 22:22 “Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child” KJV. That means you shall not HARM them. Stealing from them must hit a whole nother level. Cosponsor S 339
@FrankPallone https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN have you cosponsored HR 846 to end the theft of the earned and purchased insurance annuity done to Military Surviving Spouses? There is nothing but dishonor being done with this shameful practice.
@FoxNews @POTUS https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN Arlington is full of those who met their obligation to die for their country. While Congress doesn’t meet its obligation to honor the insurance annuity earned and purchased by them.  It’s an abomination.
@kusmer @senrobportman @SenateFloor https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN and this happens to their surviving spouses when they make the ultimate sacrifice in these wars. It’s a Shameful abomination. Send them to fight and then steal from their spouses when they die. Disgraceful.
@senrobportman @SenateFloor https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN you spoke?  Speaking is NOT enough. Parades aren’t enough. Little flags on graves aren’t enough. You refuse to cosponsor S 339 to end this abomination. Calls, emails, meetings and you continue to DISHONOR those making the ultimate sacrifice.

@SenateGOP @SenCapito https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN there is NO appreciation for those who have lost their lives as long as Congress allows this THEFT to continue. Why does she refuse to cosponsor S 339 to end it?? Calls...emails...meetings...I’ve done it all with them.  Honor is an action!
@SenSchumer I guess the “young and beautiful lives” are really all that matter since (and others) gets a cursory mention.  They must be an after thought like...oh yeah they are worthy of a mention...but it’s really all about the young and beautiful with Trump.  🤨
@SenateGOP @SenJohnThune https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN there is no honor for those that made the ultimate sacrifice when you ROB their surviving spouse of their earned and PURCHASED benefit. Keep your parades. Keep your little flags on graves. Show true honor and stop this ABOMINATION!

@charliekirk11 https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN Memorial Day is to honor those that have made the ultimate sacrifice. Then our “grateful” nation does this to their surviving spouse. You are not a cosponsor of HR 846 to end it. Why is this ok with you?

@GOPLeader Thank You for your support to end the SBP-DIC offset aka Military Widows Tax. Our policy makes support legislation that allows them concurrent receipt. But strips retirement from those who gave their life for this country. How’s that for gratitude.
our Policymakers in Congress should be subject to FULL Disclosure of all federal banks of monies they collect. Mil Retirement + VA Disability + CRSC+ Social Security + Cong Pay (already public knowledge) After serving 5 years They get another retirement when we vote them out.
@SenJohnMcCain it’s  outrageous that a military retiree in Congress can collect Mil Retirement, VA disability, Social Security, and congressional pay (qualifying for another retirement after one senatorial term) yet REFUSES $606 a month to military widows
@SenDuckworth it’s outrageous that a military retiree in Congress can collect Military Retirement, VA disability, CRSC,and congressional pay (qualifying for another retirement after one senatorial term) REFUSES $606 a month to military widows

@Military_Update @Militarydotcom It’s egregious that the group of people who have paid the most, lose the most. Retirees purchase, in good faith, this insurance annuity. Contract is signed. Premiums are paid. Then it is stolen from their surviving spouse.  Outrageous!

@FoxNews That is just an hour drive from where a gunman killed a woman, both her parents, and her 8 year old son. Her husband managed to escape with the 2 year old. It happened in Lawrence County OHIO maybe 5 or 6 months ago.
@FredLGibsonJr @MarkMcCaslin @BBenniton @kausmickey @AnnCoulter If I remember correctly (from management classes) Henry Ford was known for his reign  of terror. “Enforcers” carrying those big clubs doesn’t a good work environment make.
@RepTomSuozzi https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Respect for veterans that have given their life for this country starts with legislation to STOP this treatment of their surviving spouses. Yet, you do not cosponsor HR 846 to stop it. Can we count on you to add your name to this bill?
@NancyPelosi https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. We are dreamers too. We dream of the day that Congress stops this shameful practice. We ALL enjoy freedom because of the brave soldiers willing to give their lives.
@Call_Me_Dutch @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN.  This should not be happening to the widows of the ones who gave their life in service to our nation.
@RepShimkus https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Orphan? Widow??  You really want to quote THAT scripture while Congress refuses to fix this!  You don’t even cosponsor HR 846 that would end this.  Widows are being robbed of earned and purchased benefits and that’s your sermon today. Unflaming real. 😡
@RepBuddyCarter https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN they will give their life without hesitation or reservation and this happens to the spouse they leave behind. Financially penalizing their families is a disgrace.  You are not a cosponsor of HR 846 to end it.
@HouseGOP https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN there are 65,000 everyday Americans who happen to be Military Surviving Spouses that this is happening to. Are they a priority too?
@geolson68 @repcleaver @realDonaldTrump He see the military as his own personal little toy soldiers.  Line them all up. So he can play war later.  Scary.
@RoKhanna https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN it would also be better spent helping to repeal this disgrace.
@RepEspaillat https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN who is protecting military surviving spouses from being robbed of earned and purchased benefits?
@mattmfm https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Who is going to stand up and defend the very people that have given the most for freedom?  Who?
@NancyPelosi https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN why are you not helping to end this?  Why is your driving force DACA?  Who has made freedom possible for ALL of us?  You couldn’t care less about us Ms. Pelosi. Couldn’t. Care. Less.
@RepDLamborn How sad that she cares more about this group of people than she cares about the people that make freedom possible for ALL of us.  She has no desire to help Military Surviving Spouses. Refuses to help repeal this “widows tax”. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@SenDougJones thank you so much for cosponsoring S339 to repeal the unjust SBP-DIC offset that financially penalizes Military surviving spouses. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@EleanorNorton https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Military Surviving Spouses are never a consideration. Why is that?  Why are we relegated to the lowest rung of the food chain and we have already lost the most?
@TeamPelosi https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN these are some of the ones not making  ends meet because they are being denied earned and purchased benefits. But you do not cosponsor legislation to end it. Why not?
@RepStephMurphy @VFWHQ @iava @studentvets @MActionProject @RepCurbelo @RepSinema @RepJackBergman https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN are you willing to fight to end this?  Cosponsor HR 846 to end mistreatment of Military Surviving Spouses.

@RepEvanJenkins @POTUS Please remember military surviving spouses when talking about supporting our military. We have lost so much already and continue to lose as long as this continues. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@HouseDemocrats @RepJoeKennedy What about the promise of SBP to Military Surviving Families?  https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@SpeakerRyan Congress needs to stand by PROMISE of paying Survivor Benefit Plan to their families. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@SenateGOP Repeal of the SBP-DIC offset aka “Military Widows Tax” should be added to that list. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@CNN Cardi who?
@RepStephMurphy @RepJackyRosen @RepStefanik Is it ok for Military Surviving spouses to live on the streets?  It’s happening because the DoD is robbing them of benefits. You can end it. Cosponsor HR 846. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@RepStephMurphy @RepJackyRosen Excuse me, https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN his making some Military Surviving Spouses homeless because they are being robbed of earned and purchased benefits. Where are you?  They need your help.
@RepStephMurphy @RepJackyRosen @RepStefanik @RepWesterman Do you realize that some Military Surviving Spouses are homeless because DoD persuaded the retiree to purchase an insurance annuity that is legally PROHIBITED from paying out?  https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@RepStephMurphy https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN this should not be happening. Disgraceful.  Please cosponsor  HR846 to end it.
@RepEvanJenkins https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN.  The President has the power to end this treatment of 64,000 Military Surviving Spouses.  It has happened for 17 years. If anyone can end it, He is the one
@SenBillNelson @SenBillNelson thank you so much for taking the time to be on our conference call about the SBP-DIC offset. It means the world to us to know you want this offset to be repealed as much as we do.
@RepAdamSmith The entire military family serves this nation, just in different ways!  Stop this treatment of Military Surviving Spouses. End The SBP-DIC offset. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN

@LindseyGrahamSC https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN  evidently the Military Surviving Spouses of those that gave their lives mean nothing to you. You won’t cosponsor S 339 to end it.
@SenDuckworth @SenateGOP NO!!  This is shameful. Award it for KIA and then take it away because they are KIA. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@kylegriffin1 https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Surviving spouses are robbed on a monthly basis, shutdown or not.

@MJ07111963 @realDonaldTrump And Military Surviving Spouses should receive what has been earned and purchased. People really need to read this story to see what is happening. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@Cannadablissed @realDonaldTrump Money is needed to end this atrocity perpetrated on Military Surviving Spouses. Being robbed of earned and purchased benefits is criminal! https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN

@jamiejmcintyre   https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN we desperately need someone to champion this cause for us. Press releases are saying it's been "done away with" but that is not true. It still exists. Can you help?

@RepJoeWilson https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN as a military surviving spouse affected by this, it saddens me and is greatly disappointing that you report that this has been "done away with". You need to let DOD know so they can pay us.
@SenGillibrand https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. The resolution of 64,000 Military Surviving Spouses is to find one...just 1....member of Congress willing to make ending this their priority.  Are you that person?
@RepShimkus https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Arlington National Cemetery is full of those that took an oath. And you let this happen to their surviving spouse.
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP Why has this not been a priority?  Robbing military surviving spouses of earned and purchased benefits is disgraceful. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@SenateGOP https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. This should be another accomplishment to add to that list. When will this ever end?
@nathanfletcher @jaketapper @votevets @wwp @HeadstrongProj @TeamRWB @missioncontinue @us_navyseals Military Surviving Spouses need veterans willing to stand up for what is right. We need someone to stand in and be our hero. We have lost ours. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN

@RepJimmyPanetta As a veteran you should do all you can to stop this , yet you do not cosponsor HR 846 that would. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@Dunham_Chania @LouBoutinLov3r @12StrongMovie Post 9/11 Congress created SBP for widows/ers of those KIA and promptly took it away  https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@RepBarbaraLee Sharing a bit of truth myself. Why do neither of you cosponsor HR 846 that would end this? https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@OfficialCBC @RepWilson She has another constituent that will be subjected to this Widows Tax &amp; ignores requests for help to end it. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@MeemsKaso @RepRobinKelly @RepWilson https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. So how is she going to explain her nonsupport to end this to a newly widowed constituent?!
@RepWilson https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN Ignore, verb, ignored, ignoring. To refrain from noticing or recognizing. THIS is what you ignore.
@AnnCoulter make yourself useful and expose this robbing of  Gold Star families. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@IngrahamAngle https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN  Gold Star families being robbed of earned benefits. Bring this out of the dark

@SusaMorgan @TanyaMarhefka @speechboy71 He certainly  didn't sign up for his family to be robbed of SBP that was awarded to those KIA post 9/11. https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN
@davidschroff @joshledermanAP https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN No respect given to Gold Star families by any member of Congress with this shameful practice
@SenDuckworth Who is keeping the promise Congress made to Gold Star families of receiving SBP benefit. I don't see YOUR name on S 339.
@brianstelter https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. Would love for media pressure to get this shameful practice against Gold Star families stopped
@CNN https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN. This should leave the entire nation "stunned" that Gold Star families are treated this way
@davidfrum @JohnJHarwood https://t.co/3NmEE6LjqN this certainly is not forged. Families of fallen soldiers being denied earned  benefits
