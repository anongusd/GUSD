@DanFosterType @Zigmanfreud I don't think they were doing badly before, either.
@BoucheTimothy @EPoe187 Usually yes, but they can work well sometimes. Also, I think that TV series, properly done, have the potential to be considerably superior to films in character and story development (especially now that TV can offer film-quality visuals)
@BoucheTimothy @EPoe187 Also, I've always thought that it's much harder to create a truly "great" film/TV show than a great book. It takes only one brilliant person to write a book. OTOH, one miscast actor in an important role can ruin an otherwise excellent movie.
@BoucheTimothy @EPoe187 Generally speaking of course!
@BoucheTimothy @EPoe187 I recently watched the series "Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell." Liked it a lot, but am reading the novel now and there is just no comparison.	At the risk of sounding, ahem, elitist, one reason movies have a larger audience is that they're less mentally taxing. üòâ

@simonbchen @HotlineJosh Huh--they deleted their tweet.
Profoundly depressing article.	I can understand that "colorblindness" can lead to overlooking injustice (though I don't think it was ever meant to be used in that sense). But to see people speak of constant "race consciousness" as the right approach is pretty scary. https://t.co/Z7dhfTCFnh

@Scientific_Bird @HeatherEHeying @RealYeyoZa @SwipeWright @amyalkon And even in more modern agricultural societies! I recall reading a 19th Century French short story whose main character is a young peasant woman, &amp; the guy who courts her explicitly says being a "strong girl" is among her assets since he needs a wife to help run the farm.
@Scientific_Bird @HeatherEHeying @RealYeyoZa @SwipeWright @amyalkon Hmm, I seriously doubt that that would be the case in pre-civilizational environments where physical fitness would matter a lot for the survival of women (&amp; their children).
@RealYeyoZa @HeatherEHeying @Scientific_Bird @SwipeWright @amyalkon Right, of course. I'm wondering about the mechanism by which this works for traits other than anatomical sexual characteristics.
@HeatherEHeying @RealYeyoZa @Scientific_Bird @SwipeWright @amyalkon That's what I thought. But in that case why would male occupations associated with upper body strength lead to the evolution of more upper body strength in males only?
@barrydeutsch @NRO @KatTimpf True. I will say, in defense of conservatives in this case, that I don't think there's any mass conservative outrage at the alleged "charcoal mask is blackface" outrage! :p 	(Yes, we're at the "outrage over outrage" stage.)
@HeatherEHeying @RealYeyoZa @Scientific_Bird @SwipeWright @amyalkon OK, ignorant question: What determines which traits are selected for in sex rather than species? I mean, genes are obvs passed on to both sons &amp; daughters (&amp; some, e.g. hemophilia, passed on from females to males w/out manifesting in females).
@RealYeyoZa @HeatherEHeying @Scientific_Bird @SwipeWright @amyalkon Interesting. Could *that* be partly due to lifestyle? Has anyone looked into cultural variations in m/f muscle/fat ratios (say with agricultural economies where women routinely do heavy physical labor)?
@HeatherEHeying @Scientific_Bird @SwipeWright @RealYeyoZa @amyalkon Don't humans have basically the same degree of sexual dimorphism as chimpanzees? (and much less than some other primates such as gorillas, where males are about twice the size of females)

Also, while she hasn't worked for pay since she quit her tech job, she has been doing tons of unpaid/volunteer stuff that is much more in tune with her real interests. So the idea that her husband turned her into his handmaid is pretty ludicrous.
I personally know one woman who worked in tech &amp; quit after (1) baby No. 3 &amp; (2) husband's career really took off. He'll readily say she's the more talented of the 2. BUT: she never liked tech (she wanted to work in humanities but figured she'd need the money).

@kathykattenburg @DavidAFrench I didn't say I was pro-presumption of innocence "in certain cases." I said that you people regard the presumption of innocence as "right-wing" in certain cases.
@SurrealDonaldTr @DavidAFrench If any religious group engages in public shaming of gays, "promiscuous" women, etc., I'll speak up against that. Right now though, the argument seems to be (1) Christian churches need to actively affirm pro-gay positions &amp; (2) their members can be publicly shamed if they don't
@SurrealDonaldTr @DavidAFrench I totally agree that sometimes they do, and I've written about religious conservatives playing victim (e.g. the whole "War on Christmas" thing). But here I see David's point.
@kathykattenburg @DavidAFrench Really? I'm pro-choice, anti-censorship, pro-immigration, pro-gay rights. I assume that in your world being pro-presumption of innocence in certain cases makes one "conservative," but that's not how it works in the real world.

@razibkhan @sonyaellenmann Not to mention that right now "multiple gender identities" seem to be a reiteration of stereotypes. You're a "demigirl" if you have a vag but love sports and power tools, that sort of nonsense
@sonyaellenmann @razibkhan Seems to me the way we deal with parenthood is a good model. Fundamentally, "mother" &amp; "father" means "the people who combine their egg &amp; sperm to produce the child." We also recognize adoptive parents are parents. But no one demands that the phrase "biological parent" be banned
@sonyaellenmann @razibkhan I kinda think "censoring reality to make people feel better" *is* the downside. Slippery slope is slippery.
@razibkhan @sonyaellenmann N/p referring to Caitlyn Jenner as "Caitlyn" &amp; "she." But if someone thinks it's "hurtful" to say that CJ is not a biological woman, my response to that is not gonna be very polite.
@razibkhan @sonyaellenmann I'm not particularly interested in "gatekeeping womanhood," &amp; a lot of the radfem arguments frankly make my eyes roll. But I have issues with "reality is whatever I say it is."

@girlband777 It's interesting that I'm getting both replies like this and "no, her claims were valid" replies.	FWIW, @razibkhan, who is as far from an SJW as anyone, thinks DNA shows she had a valid claim.
@k1ug3 There was a case in NJ in which a piano teacher went to jail for being behind on CS. The judge assessed what she owed by taking her hourly rate &amp; assuming that she would be teaching 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. That's insane.

@Real_Jorg @EricRWeinstein @jdmarr2017 Thanks, Eric. I can only say that I had some private as well as public dealings with Candace during the Social Autopsy fiasco, and her level of trustworthiness is basically zero.
I won't link to the video here, but there's a link in my article. That any sane person would support her after this is beyond me.
That video was actually *worse* than anything I expected. It was Owens *giggling* about how dumb it is to expect her to care about the events in Charlottesville. (Where, let's not forget, somebody was KILLED.) 		Once again, the only charitable explanation is that she's an idiot.
A quick addendum.	When I was researching this, I came across an @NBCNews article saying that Owens called concern about white nationalism after Charlottesville "stupid," w/link to her video.	I thought, ok, sometimes people's arguments get misrepresented. I'll watch for myself. https://t.co/0etF16m8lz

@emma_c_williams Massachusetts law has no "incitement of suicide" provision, hence the issue
@Stop_Anime_ @catfitz It's not an exact equivalent, no. I'm just saying that the law makes distinctions between permissible speech and incitement to violence (basically if there's imminent danger that exhortation to violence will be carried out, it's incitement). So we can make them for suicide too.
@Gurdur Yikes! just lost all appetite for sushi....
@Stop_Anime_ Well, the law makes those distinctions when it comes to incitement of violence. If you tweet "Kill all the  Jews," it's protected speech under the 1st Amendment. If you make the same statement to an armed mob, it's not.
@Stop_Anime_ There's a huge difference between saying that to some random stranger on the Internet and repeatedly badgering someone in an intimate conversation who you know is actually considering it.

@RealPCDonaldT @BlackGriffin0 (Which isn't to say that colonial America wasn't patriarchal, to be sure -- only that I don't think the Salam trials fit neatly into that framework.)
@RealPCDonaldT @matthewasears True. I'll avoid the temptation in the future.
@StephanDeWinter Yup. Probably the most barbaric of all the Salem executions.
@RealPCDonaldT @BlackGriffin0 That said, I'm quite certainly that his use of "women," in contrasting victims of "the patriarchy" to supposed victims of "SJWs," was far from incidental. "People" just doesn't pack the same punch.
@RealPCDonaldT @BlackGriffin0 So? My issue wasn't with Sears's main point. I just thought the blatantly false claim that all the victim of the Salem witch-hunts were women was a pretty solid illustration of the fact-free bullshit of the identity-based approach to history.
@matthewasears * Who's 	Also, I'm sure you are. So are most of the people you lot cyber-mob for "mansplaining."
@JCTXS If you only count those who are actually executed, men made up slightly over 1/3 (7 out of 20). But one more woman was convicted and died in prison.
