The one thing Alexander doesn't factor in as he seeks to provide alternatives/warnings to the National Emergency Declaration: it's a fight the WH seems to very much want to have.
No firm yes or no on the resolution to terminate the National Emergency from Alexander, but fair to take that as a brushback pitch directed toward the Administration
Alexander lays out a way, through plussing up Admin effort to pull funds from DOD drug interdiction funds, he believes would provide the full $5.7 billion requested on the wall. 	Says if he's analysis is wrong, he hopes the President's lawyers will tell him.
Alexander: "I support what the President wants to do on border security, but I do not support the way he has been advised to do. It's unnecessary and unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis."
Sen. Lamar Alexander says on the Senate floor he wants Pres. Trump to go back to his lawyers about the authority to build a border wall without using the National Emergency Declaration

President Trump intends to sign border deal to avoid another shutdown, @DanaBashCNN reports 	 https://t.co/EcluPXA4Vu
@LPDonovan staffer(s) who pulled that number to have handy for the call tonight deserve an award of some kind if/when the deal gets across the finish line
in other news, perhaps GOP leaders just need to have Sen. Shelby serve as the point person on briefing Pres. Trump on all the things from here on out.
Shelby told us he stressed to Pres. Trump the agreement contained $22.543 billion in overall funding and the concept that it was a downpayment for border barriers. That number/concet appears to have resonated with the President.
And now President Trump seconds what Shelby says he told him on their call this evening: https://t.co/reyTsXHO8N
"I can assure you that any goodwill that might have existed in the committee with Michael Cohen is now gone," Senate Intelligence Chair Richard Burr told reporters https://t.co/v6iQHwDnHK
Shelby on call w/ President Trump: 	“I thought the tone of the president sounded reasonable. He’s going to look at the details and go from there. I said that’s what you ought to do.”
More Shelby on call w/ POTUS: "Well he was not exuberant about the numbers, but he knew that they had come up from what the Speaker said - which was nothing. We have a negotiated, I think, a lot better bill than we had."
Shelby also said he stressed to POTUS that the bill was "a good downpayment." 	"I know you would want more, but we got some things out of this that we think you can get started with."
Asked if the President will accept the deal, Shelby: "I can't answer that." But notes his briefing of the Senate GOP conference today received a "good reception" and that "generally bodes well for things."
Shelby said he focused on the 55 new miles of border barrier, its location in the Rio Grande, detention bed funding and discretionary authority to do more contained in the agreement
Senate Approps Chair Richard Shelby tells reporters he just got off the phone with President Trump. 	Briefed him on the details of the agreement, said POTUS didn’t make any commitments one way or the other, but said he would study the agreement

Just for point of explanation, under CAATSA Congress can halt any decision by the Trump Admin to relax sanctions. Basically lawmakers have a 30-day window to reject the plan if they believe it undermines US economic and national security interests. 	They're in that window now.

The U.S. Senate, 57-42, has voted to proceed to the resolution of disapproval re: the Trump Admin's plan to ease sanctions on three companies with ties to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. 	It will take 60 to end debate and actually pass the resolution.

10 Republicans voted with Democrats to reject the effort to table the resolution of disapproval re: the sanctions relief.
Once they get on the bill, it will require 60 votes to actually get the resolution across the finish line, so more to come on this. 	But Admin has been working hard behind the scenes to kill this, w/ a visit from Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin to meet w/ Senate Rs today
Basic gist: Push is from Senate Dems is to reverse the Trump administration's plan to ease sanctions on three companies with ties to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. 		the motion to proceed will take a simple majority, which they look well on their way to having.
The U.S. Senate, 42-57, does not agree to table the motion to proceed to the resolution of disapproval re: specific Russia sanctions	The vote to proceed to the resolution happening now. 	Background here: https://t.co/ajZSm3dgES

noting what Sen. Richard Shelby, for Banking Committee chair and still member of that panel, told reporters re: reports POTUS is bringing up firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell: “I’d be very careful doing that. The Federal Reserve is set up to be independent of the President."
McConnell tells reporters “if an agreement is reached, we’ll come back and pass it.”		But senators, those who were still here, are heading home for then holidays.
McConnell announces on the floor after the Senate adjourns today, the Senate will next meet in pro forma on Monday, then not back in session til Thursday.	Merry Christmas.
Shelby says POTUS “seemed to be exuberant at lunch.”
Shelby, who was in the WH meeting with the President and conservatives, on if a deal is coming together: “Not imminently.”
Shelby, returning from the WH, when asked if the meeting participants who traditionally don’t get to yes, were advocating for the president to keep fighting/maintain the shut down. 	“Probably mixed. Not probably. Mixed.”
The Vice President has arrived at the Capitol
When Pence does arrive, he will meet with Sen. Schumer, a meeting the WH requested, per Schumer spox. 	He’s expected to give a readout or the WH meeting and Schumer plans to reiterate any proposal w/ wall funding won’t pass the Senare.

I believe McConnell is currently wearing his traditional pre-Christmas press conference red sweater on the floor

Kinda been clear for a bit now, as even if a deal comes together, turning it into text/voting, pinging it across the Capitol etc. takes time. 		Bigger Q is what the actual parameters would need to be for a deal to come together that POTUS would agree to/stick behind.
House is out til tomorrow. 		Senators told no more votes tonight/24 hour notice before any next vote. 		There will be a government shut down.
Question, at this point, is not will there be a shut down, but will it be a short one as negotiators try to secure a still elusive deal https://t.co/E905yrKwoV
Corker says crux of the agreement is that the next vote on anything in the Senate will be on a deal to keep the government open. No test votes, no procedure votes, no symbolic votes. 		Now we’ll see if a deal is possible.
Schumer says Democrats are “willing to continue the discussions” on the three proposals currently on the table - all stop gap bills.
McConnell says the Senate has voted to move forward on the bill in order to preserve “maximum flexibility” for Democratic negotiations with the White House on a shut down solution.	Once that agreement is reached, if it is reached, it will be voted on.

Schumer says the bipartisan Senate DHS approps bill, which had $1.6 billion for border security, can't pass the House.

Schumer, after going after Pres. Trump post-meeting, brings McConnell into it: "He can no longer sit on the sidelines. He's got to persuade President Trump to take one of the two options we offered."
and to clarify - by plays out, i mean final text and the amendment process. then he'll make up his mind.
McConnell says he still hasn't decided whether he will support the First Step Act - wants to see how process plays out first
McConnell, on Pres. Trump saying he'd take full responsibility for a shutdown: "I hope that’s not where we end up. I understand that it was a rather spirited meeting that we all watched, but I’d still like to see a smooth ending" - says he's still hopeful for one

McConnell on decision to bring up CJR, which has seemed unlikely given the time crunch/GOP opposition: “At the request of the President and following improvements to the legislation that have been secured by several members, the Senate will take up the recently revised” bill
McConnell says given the workload (Farm, funding, CJR, noms, Yemen etc), Senators need to be prepared to work the week between Christmas and New Years. There’s a way around that - consent by all members to speed the process. The Leader is using the holidays to push for that
McConnell: “Members should either prepare to cooperate and work together or prepare for a very, very long month.”

@lisamurkowski Murkowski: 	"The good news at this point in time is we have not been made aware of a serious injury or casualty beyond the property casualty. But again, we are just hours after a very significant earthquake, the after shocks are still continuing."
Sen. @lisamurkowski on the Alaska earthquake: "Preliminary is that there has been extensive damage to roads, to infrastructure, and we’re worried about access to power. It’s winter, it’s cold, it’s dark and we’re not sure what that power situation is."

For some context: 5 Republicans voted to move forward on this resolution in March, which went down. 	14 Republicans did today. 	And all Dems voted in favor today. https://t.co/Gv3q2Ol8X1
The Senate, 63-37, voted to advance the Sanders-Lee resolution to cut off U.S. military assistance to the Saudi war in Yemen. 	Still a ways to go in the Senate, no immediate future in the House, but quite something to see actual movement on this, and quite a Trump admin rebuke
Sen. Lindsey Graham just switched his vote on the motion to discharge the Yemen resolution to "yes." Then gave @ChrisMurphyCT a big handshake.
Senate is voting now on the motion to discharge the Sanders-Lee resolution (SJRes 54) from committee and put it on the Senate calendar. 	Seems pretty clear supporters will have the votes, which would set up next week for vote to proceed to resolution, then debate/amendments
Corker on if MBS was aware of the Khashoggi killing: "It's my belief that he was. It's my belief that he ordered it. I don't have a smoking gun."

Murkowksi says she will vote “present” tomorrow, even though she is a “no” on Kavanaugh. She is paring with Daines so nobody will be the lone deciding vote.	The final vote will be 50-48
Murkowski: “It is not something that we say we’ll get to tomorrow. We’ve heard those voices. And I hope that we have all learned something. That we owe it to the victims of sexual assault to do more. And to do better.”
Murkowski: “There is an emotion that really has been unleashed in recent weeks. And these are discussions we need to have as a country.”
Murkowski calls the decision “agonizing.”	“I hope and I pray that we don’t find ourselves in this situation again, but I’m worried.”
Murkowski: “I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. A good man. But in my conscience, I could not conclude that he is the right person for this court at this time.”
Murkowski: “It is so critical that we have that public confidence in at least one branch of our government.”
Murkowksi: “We are at a time when many of this country have lost faith in the executive branch, and it’s not just in this administration. And here in Congress many around the country have just given up on us”	But there’s some small shred of hope that remains with the Judiciary.”
Murkowski: “After the hearing that we all watched last week, it became clear to me, or was becoming clearer, that that appearance of impropriety was becoming unavoidable.”
Murkowksi: “I have a very high standard. I have a very high bar for any nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States.”
Murkowski also says that she doesn't believe Kavanaugh will be a threat to Alaska natives
Murkowski: "I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh will be a vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. And I also join with her in saying that I do not think that protections for pre-existing conditions will be under threat."
Murkowski: "I was truly leaning towards supporting Judge Kavanaugh in his nomination as I looked to that record."
Murkowski: "We all moved from focusing on the issues, to a discussion that none of us thought we'd be having when it came to the confirmation process for the highest court in the land."

Full @Sen_JoeManchin statement on his decision to vote YES on Kavanaugh: https://t.co/5PadetIrqt
.@Sen_JoeManchin announces he is a YES on confirmation. 	Brett Kavanaugh has 51 votes in support of his nomination.	He will be confirmed Saturday. https://t.co/wBNxsOTAfy
At this moment, Brett Kavanaugh has 50 votes committed to support his nomination. 	Manchin hasn’t declared his final vote yet. 	Flake says he’s a yes barring some significant change.	Collins is a yes.	Brett Kavanaugh currently has the votes to be confirmed.
Sen. Susan Collins: “Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh.”
Collin: My fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions of the Supreme Court.”
Collins defends Feinstein, also defends how Grassley has conducted the process of the past few weeks
Collins on Ford: “Watching her, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of her nomination did not care for her wellbeing.”
Collins: “The #metoo movement is real. It matters. It is needed and it is long overdue.”
Collins: “Fairness would dictate that the claims should at least meet a threshold of more likely than not....the allegations failed to meet the more likely than not standard.”
Collins now basically going through a point by point rebuttal of Ford’s allegations
Colllins calls Ford’s testimony “sincere, painful and compelling”		“I believe that she is a survivor of sexual assault.”		But says other alleged witnesses did not back up her account as it pertained to Kavanaugh
Collins very angry about the Swetnick allegations. Calls them “outlandish” and says they are “a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained”
Collins: “I worry that departing from this presumption...would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.”
Collins: “We will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting as it may be.”
Collins now addressing assault allegations
(Have long wondered what Kavanaugh told Collins and Murkowski behind closed doors to comvince them to be so comfortable w his views on Roe. We’re hearing that now.)
Collins says Kavanaugh told her he did not view the fact that 5 justices thought a decision was wrongly decided as grounds to overturn precedent
Collins right now confirming what we’ve reported - that pre-assault allegations, she was very comfortable with Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination based on her read on his record. 	We’ll see what happens when she gets to the post-allegations piece of her remarks
Collins, on the idea Kavanaugh would be open to undoing the pre-ex rules in ACA: I disagree with this contention.”
Collins says 19 attorneys briefed her weekly on Kavanaugh’s record after he was selected
Collins now notes she’s voted for every SCOTUS nominee during her time in office, regardless of the party of the president who picked them
Collins now decrying how quickly Dems announce opposition to Kavanaugh - including Sen. Casey’s decision to announce opposition before Kavanaugh was named
Collins says the Kavanaugh process has been “more like a caricature of a gutter level political campaign than a solemn occasion”
Collins is speaking NOW

Murkowksi, to reporters, via @jeremyherb, on Kavanaugh:  “He’s not the right man for the court at this time.”

FINAL TALLY: The U.S. Senate, 51-49, votes to advance Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court.	Manchin, Flake and Collins all voted YES on the procedural vote.	Murkowski voted NO.
Vote is still open, but vote sits at 51-48. Kavanaugh’s nomination needs a simple majority to advance to final confirmation vote.
Rare these days to see Senators sit at their desk and vote as the roll is called, but that’s what’s happening. Each present senator standing and declaring their vote, yes or no, as the clerk calls their name
Manchin: YES https://t.co/5TQe97RSVy
Undecided votes on cloture so far:	Collins: Yes	Flake: Yes	Murkowski: No	Manchin: TBD
Sen. Collins enters the chamber and takes her seat next to Murkowski. The two start whispering to one another and Collins chuckles. Now watching McConnell.	Most of the GOP conference seated and listening to McConnell.	Majority of Dem senators still haven’t filed into chamber
Schumer on the floor talking Kavanaugh now.	McConnell to follow.	Then the vote.
...it is absolutely a senator's prerogative
difference here, of course, is that a nom is isn't a bill - people can vote to advance a bill and point to potential future amendment process or conference committee. not the case on a nom. Y on procedure, N on final and person gets confirmed is...complicated to explain. But...
@DemFromCT bingo. mccain almost as a rule voted Y on procedural votes for leadership. didn't dictate his final vote.
others have covered this - but for clarity: a senators can vote yes on cloture and vote no later on the nom. 	historically, senators have voted yes to advance a bill or nom for leadership, then made up their mind to go another way later

The Statement: https://t.co/IgsqLMH8P2
@burgessev sorry. meant to cc		cc: @burgessev
Once the FBI completes its interviews/investigation, it sends it back to the WH, which then puts it into the background file. Once added to the file, then senators would be able to look at it.
For those wondering about FBI  background investigations, a supplemental BI is essentially the reopening of a closed BI to interview people in light of new info. The WH would technically have to make the ask.
Sen. John Cornyn says the agreement is a supplemental background check for no more than a week. 	Vote on the motion to proceed to Kavanaugh nomination still at noon tomorrow (could be a voice vote.)
Mark Judge, Kavanaugh’s friend, would cooperate with an FBI interview request, per his lawyer (which he’s essentially said in his letters to the committee.) https://t.co/sNCtKi7UD5

Graham: “Am I mad at Jeff? No. Am I in a different place? Yes.”
Graham says he just spoke to Flake and the two of them plan to meet with Sen. McConnell
A cliffs notes explainer on whether or not this will happen: it depends on the math.	If Sens. Collins and Murkowski endorse Flake’s position, R leaders probably won’t have a choice but to do it.	If they have the votes without Flake, entirely possible they move forward.
So here’s the deal:	-Kavanaugh’s nomination has been APPROVED by the committee	-Sen. Flake will only vote for him on the FLOOR with a one week delay/FBI investigation	-Flake, it appears, does NOT have McConnell’s agreement to delay a vote
Flake now adds some clarity: says he will only vote for the nomination on the floor with a delay/FBI investigation
Graham: “I love this committee but we’re not the majority leader.”		Flake notes that the floor schedule is, indeed, up to Senate Majority Leader McConnell
NEWS: The Judiciary Committee approves Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination 11-10.		There is, per Sen. Jeff Flake, a one week delay on floor action for an FBI investigation.
Flake describes agreement as a limited, one week FBI investigation into allegations
Flake says he will vote to advance the nomination to the floor IF the floor vote is delayed a week/FBI investigation into allegations is commenced
Flake says he’s been speaking to Dems “I think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week” for an FBI investigation
Sen. Flake will speak now
