@AspenInstitute @AspenCitizen @facinghistory @Allstate We agree wholeheartedly, @AspenInstitute! That’s why we started The America Unity Project - a chat application for people from both sides of the aisle to come together and have civil political discussions. https://t.co/erN6yn94xF
We have added the ability to like points made by your conversation partner! Tap the +1 if you like what they say, and let them know their comments are being heard! https://t.co/erN6yn94xF #america #americaunityproject #politics #politicaldiscourse #unity #bettertogether https://t.co/MUEMDla94a
@BigTentNation We noticed this, too! That's why we're starting The America Unity Project - trying to promote civil discourse between people from the different parties across the aisle. Give our app a look and let us know what you think!  https://t.co/erN6yn94xF

Great point @theobertram . We’re helping people break out of this “us vs them” mentality with civil 1:1 discussions in search of common ground. Check out the https://t.co/erN6yn94xF chat application to start communicating with Americans on the other side https://t.co/DmcJI66qWt
Could not agree more! @MoElleithee  great message! https://t.co/iwjIkgmb7c
This kind of rhetoric is toxic. By calling the other side “morons” you concede any ability to change anyone’s mind. The only impact of statements like this is to make both sides angrier at each other. Check out https://t.co/erN6yn94xF for discourse without the name calling. https://t.co/5kjIqu7tab
@USConvoProject @PearceGodwin Hey @USConvoProject ! We found the invite and will DM You shortly. ☺️ Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving!
#Thanksgiving is upon us, and everyone has at least one family member who loves to talk politics. Why not practice now for that discussion, before sitting at the dinner table? Head on over to https://t.co/erN6yn94xF and get talking! #america #americaunityproject #politics
