Next Sat is this young man‚Äôs Senior Night and anybody who‚Äôs ever loved Memphis Tigers basketball/understood what it means to this town should be there to applaud Jeremiah for what he gave. Even in down times, Jeremiah gave Memphis his best. Turned into one helluva player, too. https://t.co/ueSaNmv2NZ
Jeremiah Martin got too much heart.
Houston missed 12 FTs (12-of-24) in that 69-64 loss to UCF today. Cincy missed 8 FTs (10-of-18) in first half and it‚Äôs helped keep Memphis in it. Antwann Jones‚Äô playmaking changed game. Tyler‚Äôs 2 3-ptrs/Maurice‚Äôs 10pts huge w/ Kyvon/Parks/Brewton/Raynere doing zip first 20 mins.
Antwann Jones can be a beast on both ends when he wants to be.

@MartySullivan10 Can hope Temple drops. Unlikely. W/ way UCF playin counting on them to lose feelin now like exercise in futility. If UCF dropped last 2/Memphis won out, I believe our tiebrkr scenario still applies. Hou win doesn‚Äôt affect UCF/Mphs tiebrkr. Still need WSU win out, USF to lose one.
Memphis Express yo‚Äôself?
@AamirRahman And you for Memphis?
Props to UCF. It earned this one. Thought Knights were about to fold. Dawkins didn‚Äôt let them. First Quad 1 win, and you do it at Top 10 Houston team had won 33 straight at home. Impressive. Still don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt hack Tacko every time inside and make him shoot FTs.
@Wehall95 Need UCF to lose out (not cooperating right now); Wichita State to win out and USF to lose one of its remaining three. That‚Äôs so Memphis can finish top 4 with a loss today/win vs Tulsa, yes.

@julie63pbc Thank you, Julie. All mom as you know.
@LEGION4IAMANY Playing at an All-American level, for real.
Final: Memphis 81, Temple 73. Jeremiah Martin continues to look like best player in the conference, scoring game-high 30 points on 11-of-16 FGs. His Feb has been nothing short of remarkable. Penny hasn‚Äôt lost to same AAC team twice yet. We‚Äôll see if that holds up Sat at Cincy.
@brent38139 Have a request in for Zach as I type.
This 30-piece for Jeremiah Martin has him now tied with Doom Haynes for 12th place on Memphis‚Äô all-time scoring list with 1,479 career points. Man closing in on Top 10 (CDR 10th at 1,545; Kelly Wise 11th at 1,487). Tonight fifth time he‚Äôs hit 30 or more in last eight games.
Alex Lomax won‚Äôt have huge numbers in box score. But his defensive energy/talking on that end has absolutely helped change game in second half. Oh, and Jeremiah Martin still on üî•. He‚Äôs now 10-of-15 for 27 points. 72-60, Memphis. 3:38.
@Puser24 Defense, yep.
@RodneyHigdon That Pierre-Louis 3 did, but Temple only has five second chance points. Memphis has 14.
Memphis winning this second half so far with defense. Tigers have scored nine of their 19 points so far this half off (5) Temple turnovers. Owls 3-of-14 from field, just nine points first 9:10 of second half.  52-47, Memphis.

Final: No. 25 Cincinnati 69, Memphis 64. Jeremiah Martin w/ 26; Parks with 11pts/9rebs. But not enough against a Bearcats team that pretty much outworked/outhustled Memphis everywhere in 2nd half. Memphis not mentally tough/disciplined enough right now to win Quad 1 games (0-7).
This Memphis team so Jekyll and Hyde it ain‚Äôt even funny. 17 points this half. Just 3 assists. 36.8 percent shooting. That‚Äôs after a first half that it shot 50 percent (14-of-28) and had nine assists. Better wake up or it‚Äôll be 0-7 vs Quad 1 this season. 58-52, Cincy. 3:20.
Jeremiah Martin makes his sixth 3-pointer. He‚Äôs got 18 of Tigers‚Äô 52.
That was just the second foul on Cincy this half and just sixth of the half for both teams. Tigers have been to free-throw line four times. Gotta get Parks in there and involved. His offensive rebounding some of the team‚Äôs best offense. 49-46, Memphis. 7:34.
@lmatlock85 They don‚Äôt want none.
We weak as hell physically on the front line. https://t.co/mKiRortg3g
@Apollo3_M3 Gone help ‚Äòem make it three in a row, Brother Burns. And tell Horace I said wassup! Nice seats.
Looked like clean block. Cincinnati gonna go into halftime having missed its last 13 field-goal attempts to end half. Nasty. Memphis closes out first half on 11-3 run and takes a 35-29 lead into locker room over No. 25 Cincinnati. Tigers 0-6 so far in these Quad 1 games.
@_2Liveee_ Thank you bro.
Memphis has picked it up defensively. Leads to a Kyvon Davenport 3 and a Cincinnati timeout. 30-26, Memphis. 4:07. Bearcats have missed last seven shots and Memphis has turned 9 Cincy turnovers into 8 points. Jeremiah Martin 9 pts. Jenifer 9 to lead Cincy.
CINCY WONT STOP BOMBING ITS FIRST SIX FIELD GOALS HAVE BEEN 3s MEMPHIS MIGHT WANNA GET OUT THERE. 18-18.
Jeremiah Martin going matrix again. Four 3-pointers, a steal and now an assist for him. 16-15, Memphis.
Jeremiah Martin seemingly picking up where he left off at USF. Has made his first three shots - all 3-pointers - and scored 9 of Tigers‚Äô first 11 points. Bearcats 4-of-5 from 3 to start this game. 12-11, Cincinnati. Tyler Harris and Antwann Jones about to check in.

Memphis (13-7, 5-2 AAC) moves up 21 spots to No. 70 at KenPom after 20-pt home win over previously No. 47 UCF. UCF drops to No. 52. Highest Mphs got 2 seasons under Tubby was No. 65 after 15-5/5-2 start his first year in ‚Äò16-17, w/ Lawsons. Not a knock. Just facts. Penny workin‚Äô.
Big win for Memphis. Different team at FedExForum (11-1). Could be trouble down stretch in AAC race and definitely in conference tournament (at FedExForum), especially if it get a top-four seed (which earns first-round bye).
Downhill/attacking/playmaking Jeremiah Martin &gt; stepback Jeremiah Martin. When he‚Äôs the first one, he‚Äôs AAC Player of the Year material.
@MemphisMicah Bar lowering. I‚Äôm sorry, Micah.
@KyLaw68 Trending upward. They‚Äôve cleaned it up. Were good there in the loss at Temple and win here over SMU. Only 8 offensive rebounds for UCF today. Major improvement since Houston-ECU-Tulane.
Tyler Harris three 3-pointers today (against a big-time opponent); 50 3s on the season. Only Dajuan Wagner (66), Sean Banks (62), Elliot Perry (53) and Willie Kemp (51) have made more 3s as freshman in a Memphis uniform. Harris probably getting that record.
Penny determined to get something out of junior big man Isaiah Maurice (whom he must have started in part to pull Tacko out of lane as decent 3-point threat) and I‚Äôll be damned if he isn‚Äôt getting it out of him. Good use of his four fouls to go w/ 5pts/5rebs/2blks #Coaching
I asked Penny at presser Fri if he might try ‚ÄúHack-a-Tacko‚Äù (b/c Tacko Fall shooting 27.8% from FT line on season) and it sounded so silly coming out of my mouth the question was laughed at. I was dumb to word it that way but I thought b/c he played w/ Shaq ... #QuestionsThatFail

Final Memphis (State) 83, SMU 61: Tigers improve to 12-6, 4-1 in AAC play. Right in thick of things in AAC race heading into big one at Temple next week. Brewton 20 points, Harris 14, Davenport 12 and Parks/Thornton with 11 apiece. Mphs held SMU to 36.2% FGs, 5 second-chance pts.

Guys, with throwback theme today, some of us media nerds/Tigers‚Äô statisticians trying to remember who scored the first bucket for Memphis at The Pyramid. Have had couple guess Marcus Nolan? But I wanna say it was Ernest Smith. Anyone remember for sure?
Memphis State beating the mess out of Southern Methodist University in basketball today.
Most complete effort of season so far by Memphis, which is doing nice job on Jahmal McMurray, AAC‚Äôs fourth-leading scorer (4 pts on 1-of-8 shooting). Tigers have mixed up defenses, held SMU to 28% shooting/4 second-chance pts. Offensively, 19 assists on 24 made FGs. 59-32, Mphs.
Memphis runs its lead to 22 points (49-27) on nice pass from Martin to Antwann Jones in transition. Jones‚Äô first bucket of game (also has 4rebs/5assts/1blk/1steal). Martin‚Äôs eighth assist. SMU shooting just 26% for game and has missed its last seven shots. 16:15 left.
@moharriman @geoff_calkins Jordan Wilmore. 7-4 junior center from Whitehaven.
@ChipLaw67 He‚Äôs gotten better.
@Bjorn2Hula Can‚Äôt say. Teammates (so you‚Äôd think decently close) but didn‚Äôt grow up together or anything. Wilmore from Baltimore. Kid is coming on. Had big game against Oakhaven recently, I wanna say.
@T_jay5 @thewingguru You doing it so right, bro.
@latilleon Was a dude at Oakhaven few years ago. Wanna say his name was Sam Edwards? He might not be most recent one (or even born in Memphis), but he‚Äôs last one I can remember, off top of my head.
Half: Memphis State 40, SMU 23. Kareem Brewton on üî• first half from long range (15pts on 5-of-7 from 3). Parks 8pts. Best sign for Mphs: Tigers had given up 56 offensive rebounds over last 3 gms. First half of this one: 4 for SMU (which came in 6th in nation in offensive reb%).
@latilleon Baltimore.
RT @CourtneyHoops90: Had a talk with Whitehaven head coach Faragi Phillips. He mentioned Memphis is very, very, very interested in 7-foot-4‚Ä¶
@tigersgrizz07 NET also says there‚Äôs a world of difference between Memphis (74) and SMU (114), which I‚Äôm not sure I buy at this point. We‚Äôre still trying to figure out what NET‚Äôs exact formula is. Until we do, my go-to remains KenPom.

SMU and Memphis tip off this game ranked 97th and 98th at KenPom. Tigers want to separate themselves from middle of pack in AAC standings, have to protect homecourt and win games like these (particularly w/ Foster out). Winning on road in AAC tougher than ever. 5-0, Memphis.
@KellyHinesTW Yeah. Bet he decided ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go before they get defense set,‚Äù which I get. But with way it played out, Frank gonna be kicking himself for that one, I‚Äôm thinking. Tough.
@KellyHinesTW Didn‚Äôt Tulsa have one timeout left? Or am I wrong, Kelly?
@Lesley72301 Like you‚Äôre taking calls on Marc. And I love me some MMonk. But I need either a first-rndr (which doubt they can get at this pt) or something else involving picks. Grizz close to having big cap space. In your scenario, I‚Äôm locked up $$ again til Parsons/Mike off b/c BB opting in.
@tigersgrizz07 More like KJ there. His dad will tell you same thing so that‚Äôs not an opinion/take. Definitely has to mature in that dept. But talent there. Can play point-forward but probably natural 3 in college w/ way he‚Äôs grown. You‚Äôre right: Rose good, but he can‚Äôt shoot. Gotta play off him
@tigersgrizz07 All-around game, like his brothers. I‚Äôve watched him come up as a guard and IMO he‚Äôs ahead of them as ballhandler/playmaker. Vocal, comfy leading.

@Ben_Hill2 Your eyes not wrong. Opp‚Äôs getting crazy # extra shots last 3 gms b/c offensive rebs Mphs allowing (18-19-19 last 3). Yes, no real shot blocker so lots easy buckets. Yes, the guards gamble. Hurts but helps at times b/c they do force to‚Äôs (lead AAC). Alex best on-ball defender.
@orlandoenomo Sad, but very true. And a good point. Think he‚Äôs fourth, for real. Rebounding about attitude, toughness. This team only has 3, 4 guys that will do it regularly.
@jay_256 Could. Will come down to whether they can figure something out and slow SMU on glass. Mustangs 6th in country in offensive rbdg%. Bad matchup. Temple hasn‚Äôt lost at home, period, so tough for anybody and, yep, then you gotta hope you can ride big home crowd vs UCF. Tough stretch.
@RScootman Was on ESPNU today. SMU game next Saturday on ESPNU.
@orlandoenomo Yep. That‚Äôs biggest issue right now. This team just not gonna be efficient dfnsvly. Not this season. But can be better than 18-19-19 offensive rebounds allowed in last three games. Wichita St had 7. Tennessee had 11, LSU 13, OKSt 6 and Yale 10 in OT. Point is, can shore it up.
Final: Memphis 83, Tulane 79. Road win, yes, but too close and Tigers‚Äô rebounding/defensive problems continue. Martin with 27pts/5rebs/3assts/3stls/2nlks/4to‚Äôs in 34 mins. Tigers give up 19 offensive rebounds; 25 pts to dude named Zhang (who was avg 6.5ppg coming in). SMU next.
Correction: Martin now with 4 this half. Had 21 at halftime. 79-76, Memphis.
Memphis sleep-walking lot of this second half (while everyone was watching end of Philly-New Orleans) and it‚Äôs come back to cost it. 77-74, Tigers trying to hold off Tulane. 49.8 left. Memphis ball. Martin scoreless second half. Opponents continue to kill Memphis on off glass.
WTH, Kyvon?
Jeremiah Martin getting his groove back. Since Tennessee loss (in which he had 8 pts on 2-of-12 FGs), Tigers senior G/preseason AAC first-teamer avg 16.9pts on 50.7% shooting (35-of-69); 46.4% from 3-pt range (13-of-28). Good sign for Mphs w/top 100 SMU, Temple and UCF coming up.
@SirMemphisGSlam Agreed.
@mrmiles86 Penny for now because he can get five-star talent to Memphis. Clearly, though, Kermit a seasoned coach who knows his stuff/how to draw the most out of guys. Kermit keeps having weeks like he has this week, he‚Äôs gonna have it rolling down there.

Final: Memphis 85, Wichita State 74. Gregg Marshall wraps this one up by telling Bank of Bartlett/Memphis Rebounders president Harold Byrd that he needs to spend some money on his face. I mean, it‚Äôs like Huggins is back in Memphis, giving it to Tigers fans again. Davenport 25 pts
@kappasigmd41 I don‚Äôt think you can complain about Wichita State getting away with fouls tonight when they‚Äôve shot five free throws to your 29. If anything, this one probably been slanted more Memphis‚Äô way. Surprised Marshall hasn‚Äôt been on the officials more about the discrepancy, frankly.
Good to see Tyler Harris still contributing with his shot not falling (2 point on 1 of 6 shooting). Gets steal top of defense and turns it into pair of free throws. Memphis 27 FTA‚Äôs to Wichita State‚Äôs two. Davenport 3 gives him team-high 18 pts. 68-58, Memphis.
@kappasigmd41 Started game calling everything. Stopped calling anything for couple mins here in second half. And now they‚Äôre blowing whistles again. Also, Wichita State has shot two free throws to Memphis‚Äô 24.
Gregg Marshall to Harold Byrd (Bank of Bartlett president/heckle king sitting in front row): ‚ÄúI hope your bank account is as big as your mouth.‚Äù 		Harold Byrd: ‚ÄúThank you, Gregg. Now call a play.‚Äù
How many slow starts this team gonna get off to before Davenport in starting lineup? I get bringing him off bench if you‚Äôre not getting off to slow starts without him. Bring him off, then he‚Äôs gotta warm up, then the team warms up. What am I missing?
@dnelljr75 @Iam1Cent No doubt about it. He gives them a different dimension.
@dawson_zach @memphishutch Yep. Zach gotcha covered.
They were giving away a free pizza and 7-foot signee James Wiseman stood up in the front row here at FedExForum, waving his arms for the free pizza, and he was rewarded with the free pizza. $5.99 violation. Report it, Kentucky.
@JohnMartin929 @929espn Straight hater. These my Garrett Temples, fool.
Lot to like about Antwann Jones. His 10 pts (on 4 of 4 FGs) lead a Memphis squad that outscored Wichita St 26-12 over final 7:15 of first half. Tigers lead Shockers 44-32 at break. ALo 6pts/4assts. Davenport 8pts/4rebs. Parks with a really nice 12 mins (6pts/3rebs/2blks/3steals).
ALo ALo ALo.
Tigers need this Mike Parks rest of season and they could do some things.
Man. Tyler tried to EuroStep and got it smacked back to USA.
Memphian, former Cordova High standout Rod Brown enters the game for Wichita State. Penny telling team ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get Kyvon involved.‚Äù Davenport zero field-goal attempts in first seven minutes of this one. 10-9, Wichita State.
Look at Alex Lomax get a steal on a big, push the ball upcourt and convert the layup. Kid gonna be just fine.
Wichita State second-lowest scoring team in AAC (70.1 pot) in what‚Äôs clearly a rebuild year for Gregg Marshall. Be nice to see Memphis keep these guys under 80 tonight and continue the defensive improvement against a higher-quality opponent than what they‚Äôve seen last few games.

Penny said Tigers had a couple of team meetings after giving up 89 points in win over Little Rock on Wednesday - one with him, one players-only (that he encouraged). Told players in his meeting w/ team "You have to earn everything. No more wasted minutes. No more excuses."
Freshman Antwann Jones productive again in his second start replacing Alex Lomax with 11pts/6rebs/5assts/2steals in 21:26. Did have four turnovers (Martin's 5 led team). Lomax had 6pts/3rebs/5assts/0turnovers in 22:30.
Final: Memphis 99, TSU 41. Martin's 14 points lead six Tigers in double figures. Memphis shot 60% from floor (30-of-50), made 34-of-45 FTA's (76%) in a game that had 56 fouls. I Maurice 13pts. Tigers need to clean up the 47 turnovers last two games (26 today). That's too sloppy.
@brad0024 Doesn't make any sense.

@TTime118 I think he was pressing early in year offnsvly. Nine shots each of first 3 games. Then, trying to adjust, think he pulled back too much. So he‚Äôs lost little confidence, looks like, trying to find that line. He‚Äôll be fine. There‚Äôs reason Penny trusts him. Has to develop a shot tho
Final: Memphis 99, Little Rock 89. Jeremiah Martin scores 22 (to go w/ 6 rebs/5assts) and Kyvon Davenport has 15 and career-high 15 rebs to help Tigers improve to 6-5. Jones 13pts/6assts starting in place of Lomax (4pts/5rebs/6assts). Brewton 15. Harris 14. Gotta tighten up D.
Little Rock came into game at Memphis ranked 274th nationally in offensive efficiency - so not good - and Trojans have 85 points on 53.6% shooting w/ 3:52 left. Defense continues to be biggest problem for this Memphis team. Opponents shooting 47% on Tigers this season. 85-84, LR.
@ADatewithGod @EasterwoodKeith That story was about Tyler, with quotes from Tony about his cousin. Good try, though. https://t.co/ID9w1oFjph
Half. Memphis 48, Little Rock 39: The 19-4 run for Memphis late in first half started w/ defense (Martin bucket off the press). Antwann Jones impressive in first start w/ 8pts/2assts (3-of-3 FGs). Martin 11 points. Memphis gotta tighten up its perimeter D (LR was 8-of-14 from 3).

@TheGIJoeShow Man, Frank sitting in those seats, having time of his life watching Tyler have time of his life. You don‚Äôt question the timing? Vilifying a man 21 yrs later who‚Äôs done more good for Mphs youth than Tony/Keith/me/you combined? Now u wanna be heard/make him villain, w/ Tyler there?
@EasterwoodKeith @Hairpie10 @lutherpowers The backlash was against his uncle, who you‚Äôve been after for years and Tony doesn‚Äôt talk to. So why‚Äôs that a risk for Tony?		Book potential, so Tony could potentially help others who‚Äôve been ‚Äúsold,‚Äù was discussed during the podcast, though, no?
@lutherpowers @EasterwoodKeith
@lutherpowers They bringing this stuff back trying to get a book, sounded like. Easterwood been after Frank for years on this. Those are facts. Can‚Äôt say Tony lying b/c I wasn‚Äôt there.

@Carolyn00989215 Thank you!
A rivalry was reborn Saturday before the second-largest crowd for a Tigers basketball game in FedExForum history. Admiral Schofield made sure Round 1 went to Tennessee (and let Memphis fans know about it). https://t.co/6ze3r9PpdM https://t.co/lJsruxv725
In the renewal of a great basketball rivalry that looks like it's going to get heated again over the next two seasons, Tennessee and Memphis picked up right where they left off - this time with the No. 3 Vols dominating from start to finish. STORY: https://t.co/6ze3r9PpdM
Tennessee fans whining about the Tigers flopping for calls in my mentions after the No. 3-ranked Vols shot 24 more free throws than the home team in a 10-point road win against the not-even-close-to-being-ranked Tigers is why I love this rivalry and it should always be played.
@GCarverFX Amen.
Penny says he‚Äôll now consider starting Kyvon Davenport again. Davenport had career-high 31 points (12-of-17, FGs, including 4-of-5 from 3), 11 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 blocks, 1 turnover in 25 minutes and 34 seconds of play against one of the best front lines in the nation.
@ChaseMTreadway Hopefully you‚Äôll get a like or retweet off that.
Penny: ‚ÄúWe worked all week to be ready to hit first ... but that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre ranked No. 3 in the nation. When you give up 102 points on your own home floor, not gonna win too many of those.‚Äù
Admiral Schofield: ‚ÄúThe (Tennessee-Memphis) rivalry is definitely renewed.‚Äù
RT @FrankMurtaugh: Today‚Äôs crowd (18,528) is second largest for Tiger game at FEF. Georgetown game on 12-22-07: 18,864.
24 more. Tweeting and walking don‚Äôt mix. https://t.co/RpFZpokwQ7
Pretty remarkable actually Tigers scored 92 and lost by just 10 points to No. 3-ranked team in country with Harris (3-of-12), Lomax (2-of-8) and Martin (2-of-13) combining to go 7-of-33 from field and Vols shooting 22 more FTs (46 for Tennessee to 22 for Memphis).
Final: No. 3 Tennessee 102, Memphis 92. Vols just too big, too good. Admiral Schofield 29 points/11rebs. Grant Williams 19pts for Vols, which shot 52% and looked like an efficient machine offensively. Davenport a stud today with career-high 31pts/11rebs. About what we expected.
So Jeremiah got a Class A technical foul and Lomax and Bone got double techs. Weird.
James Wiseman gets chant from student section as he and fellow 2019 Memphis signee Malcolm Dandridge make their way up through the crowd and to the exits. And now Admiral Scholfield in Tigers‚Äô huddle and Penny hot. Tech called. Refs sorting it out. 98-89. 47.8 left.
Tyler (and Memphis) needed that 3. His plus-minus today was minus-23 before that bucket. 95-84, Vols.
@1scottgreen1 Garner, too, I wanna say.
Foul count: Memphis 29, Tennessee 21	FTs: Memphis 16-of-22, Tennessee 28-of-34.		This half FTs: Memphis 3-of-6. Tennessee 14-of-17.		Tennessee leads Memphis 89-76 with 3:55 to play and Bone on line for two more.
Davenport looking like anything but the ‚ÄúJUCO player‚Äù people love calling him. He‚Äôs keeping Memphis in this game (21pts, 7 rebs). Penny has about had it with these refs. If they didn‚Äôt call that one, boy. SMH. 76-64, Vols.
Top blown off. Jones deep 2. 63-56, Vols.
13:09. Memphis has cut deficit to single digits, and now draws a charge on Tennessee and this crowd is all in. 63-54. Jeremiah turns it over, but Tigers get it back and now have chance to cut to six or seven. Tyler misses 3. Good look. Building would‚Äôve exploded. 12:08.
RT @MedcalfByESPN: Tennessee is on a different level. No surprise here. But these Memphis Tigers are playing with an energy that will eleva‚Ä¶
Half: Tennessee 50, Memphis 35. Penny walked to locker room visibly frustrated. Waved hand in direction of official. Mphs called for 15 fouls/Tenn 11. FTs: Tenn 17 attempts/Mphs 16. Vols‚Äô 15-pt lead more about their efficiency (51.7% FG) and Tigers‚Äô woeful 27% shooting from field
Opponents, including Tennessee just now, just leave ALo open. Even on midrange shots. Will be story of his career at college level unless he can develop consistent jump shot or floater.
Memphis‚Äô Tyler Harris, Alex Lomax, Jeremiah Martin and Antwann Jones (so most of its backcourt) a combined 0-of-13 from field (Brewton 2-of-3, but out with 3 fouls). Bad formula for Memphis. Vols shining. 43-25. 3:40 left in first half.
Chris Paul got a good seat for Tennessee-Memphis. Rockets vs Grizz tonight. Kareem Brewton 3 pulls Tigers within 9 (23-14). Looks like Paul pulling for Penny even tho he‚Äôs sitting beside a Tennessee dude (Paul clapped on made Memphis FT). Now 25-18, Tennessee, and crowd back in. https://t.co/YHbINY8ArB
Tennessee playing grown man basketball right now. So far been everything we thought it would be - a mismatch physically, in experience and just about every other facet of the game. 19-5, Vols. 14:38.
Tennessee putting on a clinic right now, up 15-5 just 3:43 into this one. Penny forced to call timeout after Scholfield (with Jeremiah Martin on him) buries 3 from top of key. Vols 5-of-5 from floor to start, including 3-of-3 from 3. Memphis 1-of-6 from floor.

This sophomore guard for South Dakota State. David Jenkins. Has 7 turnovers, yes, but on a night Mike Daum hasn‚Äôt given them much, Jenkins‚Äô 28 points (6 of 9 from deep) have carried Jackrabbits. Raynere 3-point play. Makes FT. 77-66, Memphis. 2:25. Time to close one out, Memphis.

@BidnessSquare Will check it out, bro.
@iflychris Good to have learned some lessons playing against good teams.
Daum to bench with three fouls. This where Memphis needs to put this team away. Isaiah Maurice our here being a defensive presence tonight against Jackrabbits. 57-45. Timeout. 11:46.
Here comes professional shot maker Mike Daum. Back-to-back 3s from him to cut Memphis lead to seven (52-45). Daum with 13 now. Isaiah Maurice on other end, and now a Daum Miss from deep. Antwann Jones 3 and its back to 12-point lead for Memphis (57-45).
Don‚Äôt look now but ALo, Tyler and Jeremiah all shining together right now for Memphis.
@FluoxaTeen Yep. Literally just tweeted that. Good eye.
@TravisRbrtsn I‚Äôd agree. Like how he‚Äôs playing passing lanes better, using his speed to get in them late and create transition chances.
@jay_256 https://t.co/i4R2DaLZND
Half. Memphis 40, South Dakota St 32: SDSU turnover machine with 16 in first half. Memphis turned them into 19 points and that‚Äôs been difference so far. Mike Daum 7 points (3 of 6 shooting); was in foul trouble, but finishes half with just two. Harris 12pts/Martin 11. Jenkins 16.
@Nick_the502 Clever.
Big second foul for South Dakota State star Mike Daum. He‚Äôs off to slow start with just five point and now good chance he‚Äôll sit at least most of rest of this first half at Memphis. Tigers leading 23-15. 8:59.
@RobMcCraw Yessir.
@jimmyslim31 Memphis isn't losing recruiting battles to Vandy. Kids know they're not winning a national championship there. And UT can still claim that's what they're working to get back to, yes. Alabama. Georgia, LSU, yes.

@JROMSMITH @JohnMartin929 Bro, you‚Äôre completely missing my point. I‚Äôm telling you I believe they changed the story of his background for the movie b/c they knew Michael couldn‚Äôt pull off the accent. John just said Michael B‚Äôs character originally from Wakanda. Why do you think they changed it for movie?
@JROMSMITH @JohnMartin929 See? John looked it up and in the comics dude is from Wakanda.
@JROMSMITH @JohnMartin929 Yeah, my point is if it was like that in the comics, you gotta point. In that case, OK you‚Äôre right. If that was done in the backstory they wrote for movie - after they‚Äôve already cast Michael B - b/c they knew he wasn‚Äôt gonna been able to pull of accent, then I‚Äôm right/you wrong
@TJfromTWlTTER @JohnMartin929 Right. This point I‚Äôm just praying for Dillon to get back.

@mr9399 Thanks, bro. Fly Bears Fly! You gave us your blessing and it‚Äôs working!
Poor showing for Mphs. 20-point loss to a team picked to finish last in Big 12. Of course will be growing pains w/ young team, but Raynere 23 mins (some at center)? Parks 4? If Parks healthy, something clearly up there. Get nothing offensively in halfcourt w/o him. Canisius tmrw.

Davenport fouled with Memphis trailing Yale 96-95 in OT with 3.8 left. He‚Äôll shoot a pair. Everyone in FedExForum standing. Misses first. Crowd groans. Yale timeout. Still 96-95, Yale. One more for Davenport.
Lot of heart and guts in that 5-9, 150-pound body of Tyler Harris‚Äô. Ties game with three FTs with 2.9 left vs Yale. Memphis shouldn‚Äôt be relying on freshmen, but it‚Äôs having to tonight.
Makes second.
Lot of pressure on Tyler Harris, to step up there and make three FTs with his team trailing 83-80 with 2.9 seconds left. Tough spot. Makes first.
Halftime. Memphis 47, Yale 45		Good: Tigers forced 11 turnovers; out-rebounded Yale 20-18; shot 47% from field.		Bad: Tigers scored just 9 pts off those Yale turnovers; allowed Yale to make 7-of-15 from 3; looked lost offensively couple possessions in first half (just 3 assists).

Memphis 76, Tenn Tech 61. Still waiting on players/Penny. Good first half for Mphs, but some weaknesses exposed 2nd half. Tigers don‚Äôt have a big that will rebound right now other than Kyvon Davenport (30pts,10rebs). Shot just 38.2% 2nd half. Harris/Wingett combined 0of10 from 3.

Memphis had been outscored 10-9 over first 8:28 of second half before Kyvon Davenport converted a layup. He and Martin 14-of-23 for 37 points. Rest of team 9-of-35 for 22 points. Yikes. Tyler Harris scoreless (0 of 6). 59-46, Memphis. Wingett misses another open 3 (0 of 4).

@tigerteddy1 All I said is he got loose with some throws, which he did. Not killing the guy. He hasn‚Äôt been the issue tonight. Tackling and this defense has. That and Norvell dang near helping them score calling that timeout with 55 seconds left first half. Lucky all they got was FG.

@iammrswallace @CMetcalf77 @JohnMartin929 @BennettDoyle @929espn You solve the double standard in tennis AFTER THE MATCH. Yes, ump deserved to get gone off on. And that‚Äôs it. Then you move on, you maintain your composure and possibly win the match. Serena a champion. You win like one and you lose like one. Completely took shine off Osaka.
This has to be considered great news for Memphis. Matter of fact, I don‚Äôt know how you come away from that interview with Jeffries‚Äô dad not feeling like Memphis still the favorite. https://t.co/k0k22NaOvk
@CMetcalf77 @JohnMartin929 @BennettDoyle @929espn She can go off on umpire. He deserved it. But it went on too long and she lost her composure. Can fix tennis after the match.

@JROMSMITH @LCAmarketing @929espn I appreciate you listening, Brother Smith, and I appreciate you letting me know how you feel about it. Real talk.
@LCAmarketing @929espn Ex: White soro on video says N-word to Kanye. Unacceptable? Yes. My level of anger: Let‚Äôs just say I get over that quicker than I could Clay calling me the n-word, or Clay telling me when he can/can‚Äôt use it. Now that‚Äôs evil. When assessing how bad the vio, some context required.
@LCAmarketing @929espn Really appreciate you listenin‚Äô. What Clay said after John read it was that it wasn‚Äôt OK. The context comes in in determining how severe it is, right? While ALWAYS UNACCEPTABLE FOR WHITES TO SAY (and Clay acknowledges that, sayin‚Äô he‚Äôd never use it), there ARE levels to it. (1/2)
@WayneWooReview @wojespn And the player‚Äôs decent! Can shoot it. God is good, bro!
@bencolar To the upper room, bruh.
@LCAmarketing @929espn Was listening to Clay just like you were, waiting for him to say some dumb ish like what Hogan said ‚ÄúIS OK.‚Äù John read it and Clay said wasn‚Äôt OK, so what attack from me were you looking for? Context applies when you‚Äôre deciding how mad you wanna be about it. Never OK to use it.

Man we got kids getting shot in schools. Lot more to worry ‚Äòbout than forgiving Hogan/PapaJohn‚Äôs.
@JROMSMITH @last_rep @JohnMartin929 I know you didn‚Äôt. That part was for Brother Rutherford.
@last_rep @JROMSMITH @JohnMartin929 We gonna keep letting Hogan call us the n-word? Heck no. And before you say ‚Äúbut others will think they can say it, apologize and get spot back‚Äù (which still true too often), you gotta admit as much as it‚Äôs on whites to respect us and not use the word it‚Äôs on us to stop using it.
@JROMSMITH @last_rep @JohnMartin929 I don‚Äôt disagree with any of that.
@JROMSMITH @last_rep @JohnMartin929 Him not working for WWE and saying he forgives Hulk, to me, makes him more credible b/c he‚Äôs not saying he accepts Hulk‚Äôs apology just to keep job. Man has history w/Hulk and speaking from his exp w/him. My point is even if u can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt forgive him, can‚Äôt be mad at those who do.
@last_rep @JROMSMITH @JohnMartin929 Not debating whether apology genuine. Said what I did to ask u if 1 black person has forgiven Hulk, does that make that person - like DaBlackPope or me should I chose to forgive him - a sellout or any less black? God teaches us to forgive my point. What‚Äôs your line? True apology?
@JROMSMITH @last_rep @JohnMartin929 Appreciate heads-up on Titus, Brother Smith. I was clearly told wrong on his stance. That said, Brother Rutherford gotta ? for u: Do you believe in forgiveness, b/c I know u saw this. Either way, let‚Äôs not act like 0 black folk are cool w/ it. Ever needed to be forgiven? I have. https://t.co/MTlPhLNsd3

@bayou Y‚Äôall told me the same thing about Piscotty.
@bayou Your defense has been complete crap since he left, tho. Guy‚Äôs more than just an average bat, too. Leader in clubhouse, but I get you guys don‚Äôt wanna hear that now. Matters though. And, yes, signing Fowler was foolish. More evidence that STL‚Äôs problems go above just Matheny.
@1Putt4Me üòÇü§£
@Dedsports Definitely need to add some pieces before playoffs (bullpen help; Yu coming back healthy/effective would be nice but have my doubts on him; maybe another veteran bat) but we‚Äôll be ready. Don‚Äôt do that stuff, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre beating the AL. Maybe not even Dodgers on our side.
@Dedsports Brewers gonna Brewer. Appear to be doing it right now, in fact (L in 5 straight). We own them this year anyway. Won 8 of 11 so far. Like I said, our division. Deep down you know that as well as I do.
@Dedsports Thanks, man! Really appreciate that. Have followed you a looooooong time and the admiration‚Äôs mutual!
@1Putt4Me You always keep me and my Cubs grounded, Eric. üòâ
@bayou Fair. But he was good for Cardinals (.293 in 2015) when we took him from them and Cards fans have been pointing to his BA ever since as justification for losing him. You‚Äôll give me that, yes?
@Dedsports I understand that Cardinal fans‚Äô default button is to go to WS titles - my best friend is a STL fan - but it‚Äôs certainly our division for the foreseeable future (though you guys have been good against us this yr for whatever reason) and as a Cubs man I‚Äôm perfectly fine with that.
@PaulyP68 Cards have sucked since we took him from them. Been worth every penny.

@SKSqueeky Agreed. Gotta personnel problem.

@AllyMsOldWallet I was referring to free agency.
@1Putt4Me @thewingguru Only when it comes to Cubs-Cardinals. üòâ
@AllyMsOldWallet Yep. Uppity.
@AllyMsOldWallet I‚Äôm sorry, was arguing with my uppity Cards buddy and took it out on you. https://t.co/RpM46N7Lgk
@1Putt4Me No. And you should come get those wings Friday at @thewingguru opening in Bartlett. Can‚Äôt even remember how you won those from me as thoroughly as my Cubs owned y‚Äôall last year.
@AllyMsOldWallet How about we talk about now and the strong possibility of y‚Äôall not making the playoffs for a third straight year? You guys do uppity, with your rings, can‚Äôt even see the mediocrity right in front of you. +7 run diff thru 68 games? Go home.
Sit down, Cardinals.
@mikefromemphis Length of this deal is the key. Hopefully they didn‚Äôt lock in too long. We‚Äôll see.
@mikefromemphis Deal‚Äôs up this year, was my understanding. Not sure when negotiations started, but the timing seems unfortunate, for sure. Would‚Äôve liked to have had Penny as bargaining chip in those negotiations. Would‚Äôve had more leverage then. A Tubby/Norvell deal &lt; Penny/Norvell, you figure.
OK, Addison!
@MemphisMan76 @jabtiger50 Nah, wasn‚Äôt until that Feb overtime loss at ECU according to Giannotto that Rudd started making moves to fire Tubby.
@jabtiger50 Probably thought at that point they were riding it out with Tubby.
That - on a smaller scale - is what I‚Äôd hoped might be a possibility now w/Penny in the fold. But would appear it‚Äôs just gonna take a lot more winning - basketball and football - before Memphis gets one of those monster deals. https://t.co/GDzZlRu81x
I‚Äôm told Memphis‚Äô athletic dept inked new deal w/Nike sometime last yr. So that $$ fig (which I don‚Äôt have at this point) was locked in b4 Penny hiring. Nike will work separate deal 4 Penny/men‚Äôs üèÄ, hopefully w/lots of bells/whistles. Will help but not magic fix for entire dept. https://t.co/3FxLvCXbWl
@lafelton And I picked up a nice player at No. 22, I‚Äôm assuming, like DiVincenzo? I‚Äôd do it, but Grizz aren‚Äôt trading Gasol before they learn for themselves that this ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre-playoff-bound-so-long-as-we-have-healthy-Mike-n-Marc‚Äù approach no longer realistic.

@_CoachFly @BriggsSpeed OK, so if George Hill choked (and we ain‚Äôt talkin‚Äô two missed free throws, we‚Äôre talking one), what did JR do? What would you call that? Why are you seemingly dismissing JR‚Äôs foolishness?
Mike Conley feeling that new Kanye. Looks like 2 Chainz in the background, too? Conductor gonna come back next season and drop a single. https://t.co/FxgccV1flg
@_CoachFly @BriggsSpeed I said all day you can blame Hill for miss if you want. But there‚Äôs reason everyone in country talking about JR and not Hill: b/c JR‚Äôs MENTAL mistake easily trumped missed FT. Heck, Cavs lose and no OT if Hill doesn‚Äôt MAKE first. If he misses 2, OK, see your point. Not this tho.
@BriggsSpeed @_CoachFly George Hill is a professional. Professionals miss free throws all the time, especially in spots like that. JR did something a second-grader would do and has a history of similarly boneheaded plays. He‚Äôs a 14-year vet. That‚Äôs the difference. Time and score. Basics.

@TJfromTWlTTER Sure did. My bad.
Cleveland - because of LeBron Raymone James Sr. - had chance to steal Game 1 of Finals on road against one of greatest teams ever assembled. And JR Smith took that chance, rolled it up and smoked it. Good play to get rebound, yeah, but you‚Äôre a 14-year vet. Know time and score.

@JROMSMITH Pippen played 11 seasons for Bulls before he left. He supposed to carry franchise in yr 12? At 33? He did, however, almost get us to East finals in 94. And if Rodman was specialist, so was Ray at that stage of career. This narrative that Mike won by himself, no. Pippen was Robin.
@JROMSMITH Not comparing legacies. Just pointing out that you just picked out one of Mike‚Äôs greatest performances ever. Lol. But, please, let‚Äôs not act like Mike didn‚Äôt win those six with another top-50 player by his side for all of ‚Äòem and some damn good ones in Grant/Rodman/Kukoc.
@JROMSMITH Just real. I hate it - promise you it feels dirty to say it - but dude the best. Once he takes over leading scorer all-time (will do it in 4 more yrs), it‚Äôs really done. Still haven‚Äôt brought myself to tell my son tho. He still thinks Jordan king b/c that‚Äôs how I taught him. Sad.
@JROMSMITH Bro I love Mike and I know his career like the back of my hand. That‚Äôs one game. Mike didn‚Äôt win big ‚Äòtil Scottie was ready and he had good Grant/Rodman. And that 29 from Pippen and Luc in that one game five more points than Cavs‚Äô FOUR other starters scored combined tonight (24).
@JROMSMITH He‚Äôs averaging 32, 7 and 9 this series bro. If you can criticize him for anything this series/playoffs, it‚Äôs for having organization hold onto burnouts like Smith, Tristan Thompson. He‚Äôs got fingerprints on this roster. That you can get him on.
@Tigerblueblood Them four-leafs? üö¨
@JROMSMITH Yes he‚Äôs tired. Tired of carrying this team on his back. One other player scored in double figures. Bron was sloppy tonight. Maybe even folded a bit. But save for Love and a little Korver, he‚Äôs getting 0 help. Looked to me like a guy realizing it might be hopeless, esp in Boston.
We know at least for this series the one in Boston sucks: 6 points in three games/0-of-11 from 3. That‚Äôs dang near a crime. https://t.co/tpSGXZ27up

@ChrisRowland9 @Jon_Roser @tdonovan010 @Isaac_Rivals Wouldn‚Äôt take a deal for two first-round picks outside lottery. That‚Äôs a given. But to your point about the second of those picks and finding someone outside lottery: Draymond, Capela, Rozier, Korver. Only one all-star there, but quality players. They‚Äôre there.
@Jon_Roser @tdonovan010 @Isaac_Rivals I‚Äôd rather trade back for two 1st-rdrs than draft a guy b/c I think his bust chance lower than others. Draft our only chance at all-star. Give me Doncic, Bagley or Porter (if he clears med) or 2 swings at finding one later in 1st round. Better positioned for inevitable rebuild.
@tdonovan010 @Jon_Roser @Isaac_Rivals Three of those four at home. Can a brother get a wing (which this franchise has needed for years) or something other than a project big man?

@dinohull @coachthorpe Was excellent in first half. Matter of fact, thought he might be on his way to a career-defining game tonight. To me, he shies away during star time down stretch. Didn‚Äôt do anything to change that perception tonight. Chris Paul did it for him.
@BigSim50 @Isaac_Rivals Doncic for Grizzlies (tho I fear he won‚Äôt be there). I want to be in love with Michael Porter Jr. but I‚Äôm scared.
@Isaac_Rivals Don‚Äôt.
Tip of the cap to @coachthorpe. He called this one - Houston - today on the show. Tip of the cap as well to Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, PJ Tucker and Trevor Ariza for saving James Harden‚Äôs tail for that pitiful second half. Those dudes showed monster heart in impossible place to win
CALL A DAMN TRAVEL FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE, NBA.
They hit you with the best shooter in the world. Then they hit you with the second-best player in the world. Then they hit you with second-best shooter in the world (when he‚Äôs right). It‚Äôs stupid. Hope KD is happy with all these damn rings he‚Äôs gonna win. #GoGrizz

I‚Äôm sorry DeMar DeRozan but you gotta be able to get a shot off w/time winding down in Game 1 at hm and Tristan Thompson switched out on you above 3-point line. Great D by Tristan and all but DeRozan gets $27.7 mill per to take those shots. VanVleet 2nd year dude making $1.3. SMH

@TheDHolt @D1Circuit Saw that. Gotta admit I was surprised when they reported he was headed back to Bluff City Legends (Team Penny). He‚Äôs been doing own thing for awhile now, having left East for Tenn Prep and TP for CP3 (last summer). Doubt it hurts Memphis‚Äô chances w/ him tho.

@SansCheese Yes. I said early Penny needs all 3 assts w/ D1 exp. Logical. Then, we learn Mike connected to at least 3 top-20ish ‚Äò19 kids. Oh. Then, I think, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs better than most 3s get you.‚Äù Then, Windhorst tells us NBA folks want him. Then, I say ‚ÄúHECK YES HIRE MIKE!!!‚Äù
@SansCheese Mike? He‚Äôs bringing players! Windhorst just basically said dude could have his pick of NBA benches/front offices. If he brings 1 of those prospects - w/ what Penny can bring(?) - worth it because I promise you team will be so loaded you won‚Äôt remember this discussion.
@SansCheese I was attempting to answer the last one! Lol. You‚Äôre intense, man.
@SansCheese With you on responsibility part. On ALo, I like him too, but you like him to an extreme, like you work at East and he‚Äôs your favorite student. With Jayden, it‚Äôs exact opp. So just forget waiting to see if he improved at IMG? Just lookin for some middle ground from you
@SansCheese Penny doing lot ($$) for program right now. Think it‚Äôs OK to give his son a scholly, but willing to criticize it when/if it becomes issue. Doing it before then silly. Think your larger beef/concern is that no one going to hold Penny accountable. Simply not the case.

@SansCheese I think it will be IF he plays kid and he‚Äôs terrible and Penny continues to play him over others. If he doesn‚Äôt play, what‚Äôs the issue? You and I both know at some point soon team gonna be loaded. Jayden having scholly doesn‚Äôt prevent that, does it?
@SansCheese And I still say he needs that.

@SirMemphisGSlam ü§£üòÇ Bro, let me know when the show is at Chuckles. I‚Äôll be there. Comedy club-level stuff right there. Real talk.

This battle for James Wiseman between Memphis(!) and Kentucky is going to be epic. Penny vs. Cal. Round 1.
@JROMSMITH @NevinKash @JohnMartin929 Not gonna argue w/you there. I‚Äôm not in ‚ÄúMike has to be an asst‚Äù boat. Like I‚Äôve said, concerns me 2 of the 4 coaches would have 0 D1 exp. But if he‚Äôs delivering guys like that? HAVE to consider. Watford alone more than what most 3rd assts do.
@JROMSMITH @NevinKash @JohnMartin929 Jermaine, I like you. Always have. So I need you to look up Trendon Watford. No. 9 player in Class of 2019 at 247.

@NevinKash @JohnMartin929 Wrong on the latter, bro. Miller does have strong recruiting ties. He sponsors an AAU program.

@thewingguru @kelly_lackey Would be happy to. And when you hear the part where I make you say, ‚Äúfor Tubby Smith,‚Äù - because I stopped you and made you repeat it - you‚Äôre gonna be like ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It was a set-up, Bill.
@kelly_lackey @thewingguru I‚Äôm sorry, Kelly. But he owes me. The bet was that Tyler Harris would play for Tubby Smith. I said he would not. Billy knows the deal. Jason&amp;John weren‚Äôt taking another L to Billy. üòâ
