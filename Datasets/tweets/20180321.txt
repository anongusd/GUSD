@RiggsforAZ @azcopinions @joannaallhands I am not a member of the editorial board, @RiggsforAz and I don't see your age as a disqualifying factor.  Your temper, perhaps, but not your age.  A comparison of a young political novice taking on and defeating an old political hand is a fair point.
@RiggsforAZ I also mentioned the age of the candidate who beat you, Frank. I also contrasted your political resumes. It wasn‚Äôt just a gratuitous reference to your age, as i imagine you already know if you read the column.

@BluePointAZ Well, that's the rub, isn't it?  How will she now go about making an impact on education?   Will she seize the bully pulpit or is she content with the role of glorified administrator?  Lots of interest in public ed, right now.
@BluePointAZ No power, correct. But that doesn't mean she couldn't have influence.  Douglas had none but Douglas was clueless as to how to have an impact.

@CaptainsLogAz @TopherSpiro Standing by silently as he is elected by acclamation -- thus, with your approval -- is no different than casting a vote. I'm surprised and a little disappointed that Sen-elect Sinema would make that distinction.

@JSnodgers @azcentral Ducey must, by law, appoint a Republican.  But I do understand your point.  Even if he could appoint Sinema, now way he would.
@CaptainsLogAz Why is it ridiculous to point out that Sinema said she would oppose Schumer's election and then didn't? Huge deal? No. Worth noting? Yep.  As for the rest of your rant, clearly you haven't read much that I've written about this year's Senate campaign.

@erfleuncuffed @chrisherstam True, Julie.  And there is the message for hard-right Republican voters.  Your candidate can win the primary but if you want to win the seat, you've got to choose someone with broader appeal.
@NPederson @JimSmall @dougducey I was actually thinking of her previous position on immigration, when as a congresswoman she co-sponsored a bill seeking a path to citizenship for DACA students.  She worked across the aisle on that one.
@DonnaDiva @azcentral @TucsonStar I still see Ducey as keeping at arm's length from Trump's more hysterical nativist urges whereas McSally gambled that that was a winning proposition. Oops..
@JimSmall @dougducey You could.  But it wouldn't be anyone who has demonstrated she had the support of more than one million Arizona voters.
@chrisherstam Ha!  She ran a terrible campaign. But I don't think that's who she is. I think it's who she thought she had to be.  Kissing up to Trump was a bad strategy. But what if we instead saw the return of the Martha who represented the state's most competitive congressional district?
@JimSmall @dougducey I understand that and I knocked her for it at the time.   But respectfully, this is Arizona's seat.  McSally's campaign was a disaster area. I continue to believe (hope?) she would return to her more moderate roots.

@DB_Mitchell If she'd lost badly, I'd agree and would criticize @dougducey if he appointed @RepMcSally. But the state is just about evenly divided.  Who else, other than @kyrstensinema , can say that more than a million Arizona voters wanted them to have a Senate seat?

@noprezzie2012 @charrisazrep @TeamDucey @azcentral The problem with your theory: I wasn't the one whispering to reporters what the vote was and for good reason. I had no idea what the vote was. Didn't know until today, in fact. It was Ducey's aide telling reporters details about the confidential vote. But ... nice deflection!
@jaybarbuto @dougducey To be clear, I've not seen any suggestion that they knew when the results would drop. But it is curious that within 24 hours of the ruling, a Ducey aide was telling reporters the vote was 5-2. 58 days later, we know he was right.

@matthewladner @kurland23 @azcentral But these recruiters work for the school, not the student. They get paid if they can convince a kid's parents to enroll him/her in that school.

@AndersonDrew @dougducey @azdemparty True.   But whatever the ,OT I‚Äôve (and it‚Äôs certainly political), it‚Äôs still a decent pay raise.
@djquinlan @dougducey @azcentral Certainly, Dems should keep the heat on. He caved because of #RedforEd. But decrying g a 19% pay raise is not a winning strategy....unless he takes the money from kids or some other vital program.
@kenclarkforaz @AndersonDrew @dougducey He says greater than expected revenues and ‚Äúefficiencies‚Äù in the budget.  If he takes it from kids programs, etc., then that would certainly change things.

@TJShopeforAZ @azcentral @nytimes @USDA There are states that tax soft drinks. Nothing to stop Arizona from doing it.   Everybody says they want to raise teacher pay but nobody seems willing to find a way to do it.
@TJShopeforAZ @azcentral @nytimes True. The state doesn't tax food. But is Diet Coke food? Peas and carrots, I understand you wouldn't tax. Water, I understand you wouldn't tax. But soft drinks? Sounds like an exemption carved out by lobbyist for the cola companies.
@TJShopeforAZ @azcentral @nytimes I agree. Your bill only blocks cities from imposing a tax on soda if they don't tax other groceries.  But it got me to wondering why the state has long exempted soft drinks sold in grocery stores from the state sales tax. How does that make sense?
@TJShopeforAZ @azcentral @nytimes Fair enough. But why exempt soda sold in grocery stores from the state sales tax? We exempt food because it's needed to live. Despite my own habits, Diet Coke is not a food staple. So why not tax it and raise some badly needed funds for schools?

@matthewladner @azfec I've talked with several teachers who got certified via the alternative program.   They know their subject matter (math, science) but they don't know how to manage a classroom of 30 or 35 young teens. They don't get enough help with lesson plans, etc.  They tell me they're lost.
@matthewladner @azfec So, you are satisfied with today's level of funding for Arizona's public schools? 48th is good enough?
@azfec @matthewladner So, the less we spend, the better our schools will be? I get that there are states that spend more and perform poorly.  But there are also states that invest more and reap benefits from that investment.
@matthewladner @azfec Just think how much better our scores might be if we funded our schools at something better than 48th in the country?  We might even be able to hire qualified teachers to fill all those empty classrooms.

@billyscheel @dg4az @azcopinions But how does that pay for the program on Day 1? He must have a plan for funding at the onset. Is it to repeal tax cuts? Raise taxes? What?
@billyscheel @dg4az @azcopinions Yes, but how will he fund it Day One?  He's been pushing the plan for awhile but never been specific about its funding source.
@billyscheel @dg4az @azcopinions Ending vouchers won't provide more $.  So he's proposing an immediate rollback of corp tax breaks to fund free college? What'll that raise?
@billyscheel @dg4az @azcopinions Maybe over the long haul but how do you pay for it in year 1?
