@RepDanKildee How about you offer something besides higher taxes and more welfare.
@RepDanKildee What are your ideas? Let's give all the cuts and money to the poor? Is that your idea of equality Dan? If we're going to be equal, let's be equally miserable in poverty? No wonder the west side of the state is doing so well.
@dankildee I like @realDonaldTrump and his #TaxReformBill. Maybe you should really look at what it does for the poor. I like the idea of no #Obamacare mandate. I like the idea of not paying on my first $12,000 of income. That's more money in my pocket. #TrumpTrain
Really triggered a #liberal today defending @realDonaldTrump and #TaxReformBill and rejoicing at repeal of #ObamaCare mandate. I like my freedom!
@marcorubio No, that’s not it. You hate @realDonaldTrump “Little Marco.” You’re mad you’re not president.

@RepDanKildee Breaking news, your good friend, the Senator from MN, @alfranken has been accused of sexual harassment. With a photo as proof. Do you have anything other than welfare to offer?
@RepDanKildee Again, speaking to a district on welfare, Medicaid and Section 8. And dominated by unions.
@RepDanKildee You live in a district full of people on food stamps, section 8, and Medicaid. Saginaw and Flint especially. Wonder why people leave?

I also just want to pray for our leaders and that our nation, that we may once again be a godly and prosperous land.
This President now closes 21 embassies around the world just as NSA and other "phony scandals" may come back to bite him in the rear end!
I just want to thank God for an awesome week at Patriot Academy 2013, and I look forward to next year's session as a 2nd year Representative
Amazing time here at Patriot Academy in Austin, TX. My Bill, HB 16, passed out of committee by a final vote of 12-1 with 1 absent!
I just want to say, I thank God and Jesus Christ that I am an American, and I also say God bless America! God bless the GOP, those who serve

#THANKGODFORUSA Is there anyone who still thanks God for being an American?
#WENEEDGODLYFAMILIES We need leaders who will truly promote families and individuals worth. We need moral leaders.
#GODFORUSAISRIGHT   This is the one thought that we as Christians, and particularly to my Independent Fundamental Baptists need to spread!
@DrJaysonGodsey Thank you for following me Dr. Godsey, God bless you and your ministry.
Are there any Americans who are tired of politicians of both parties committing treason? #SNOWDENISBETTERTHANMCCAINANDSHUMER!
If this country thinks that things will change without repentance toward God and Jesus Christ, they are in for a big wakeup call! #GODINUSA!
I am a Christian and a college student, do I go for a law degree and run for office, or do I serve God in full time ministry? #BIGDECISIONS!
@SenTedCruz  Senator Cruz, thank you for all the work that you are doing. We need more Christian men and women like you in DC. #GOAMERICA
Senator Ted Cruz reveals that the Gang of Eight Bill promotes hiring illegals over citizens, what BS by our leadership in Washington!
Are we willing to truly stand and fight for our lives and families and for this country that God gave us? If you are type #GOAMERICA

@DRUDGE_REPORT  How about we stop arming these rebels in Syria and just let Israel do what they want? They apparently don't need us!
What gives America the right to strike Iran and arm Al Qaeda rebels in Syria?

Sensible is your favorite word. Prove to me it's sensible. Burden of proof is on you.
@HarlanGT To continue what I said, to get their way. This is more than politics, what part of "shall not be infringed" don't libs get?
@HarlanGT No, Senate Republicans should be proud of themselves for not allowing Liberals to use emotions and psychological manipulation.
I won that debate of course!
If anyone wants to see a gun control debate by average college students, head over to my page and look at Senate Republicans Uphold 2nd Am.
Senate Republicans uphold the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and forbid expanded background checks! AMEN! PRAISE GOD

@CarmenBarnes 	What part of "shall not be infringed" do you not understand? The only way you can advance your cause is to play of emotions!!
Republicans in the Senate cannot filibuster obviously, blatant unconstitutional malarkey! Please tell me I am in a horrible dream!!
